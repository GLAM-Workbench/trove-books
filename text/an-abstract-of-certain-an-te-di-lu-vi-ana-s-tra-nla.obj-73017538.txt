YF ANA?S


G. f. GOBLE respectfully wishes to announce to the Austra-
lian public that the time is come for Mm to expose and expoimd
the secrets of the PAST world, also the present state of the
living world, and its future RE-GE-NE-RATIONS.
And as some small proof to the doubtful, let them call upon
us and then they may see and hear such uncontrovertible TRUTH
as to prove we have some valid reasons for making such bold
assertions as we do.
At present, the upper room of the Workman?s Harr, Lonsdale
Street, Melbourne, hath been opened for the inspection of Cartoons,
Models, &c., every day from 8 to 8 p.m.
ADMITTANCE, ONE SHILLING.
For private families or special parties any morning, as per
agreement.


G. F. GOBLE?S
ANIEDILUVIANAS, &c.
An abbreviated catalogue of the ancient cartoons and other works
we alone enjoyed the celeste honor to decipher, after above seven years
of physical energy, during dangers, difficulties and privations few can
conceive ; yet throughout the whole of such mental and manual exer-
tions we never despaired, or regretted the prime of our life so seemingly
wasted in transcribing apparently useless documents that probably
no other mortal would have had heart, brains, and soul enough to
accomplish, had they not, like ourselves, been spiritedly encouraged by
divine instigations or what not.
In fact, our compeers actually gave up all faith and hope of ever being
able to make anything out of such mazes of unknown TALC that
T A L K?D about no other than the most incontrovertible truisms when
truly comprehended, nevermore before we learned the mystic keys to
unlock, and prove the most sacred of all secrets. We sometimes seemed
puzzled to foresee whether our own children might ever receive any
worldly satisfaction from the immense task we had so firmly set our
incarnated soul to fully understand, so as to faithfully publish at the
time appointed.
However, to prove that we have succeeded single-handed in silent
endurance beyond our most sanguine expectations or that of our friends,
at the risk of starvation and death, it was our irremediable fate to be
spiritually aided by those immortal souls MI-TE* man either doubt, deny,
or treat as mythological beings, whereas there is nought in nature but what
must be under the SUPE R-V ISI ON of the all seeing eye of heaven and
its celestial MIN I-S TARS (such as Jupiter, Neptune, Mars, Mercury,
&c.), so much so that all what living mankind can know is through their
eternal agencies; hence what is now known must have been known
before even the very subjects of these self-same TALC?S now under
investigation hath all been plainly shown to the living world, hence will
be AL?L EARNED, A-G AIN, since what hath been is now before
you, altho? by their dates they appear to have been sacredly deposited
above 1400 years ago, as some such antique treasure in one of those
STONE high-dolls that were overthrown by the English and French
at the destruction of the Emperor of China?s summer P A-G 0 D-A.
From which idle idol WE had both heavenly and earthly per-mission to
abstract from its C-0 L D marble chest certain sybil-line leaves dictated
by 0 M-N I-S CI ENC E, among which WE discovered the originals of
the following ICONS depicted with etherial gold on very thin plates of
duly prepared TALC, mostly in characters, words, and definitions, then
known as the ANG E?L ANG?AGE?angels land-guage, consequently
from being the first spoken on this earth it will be the last and most
universal, so that the first will be last, and last first, whether uttered by
Angels, Angles, Americans, Australians, Africans, Asians, or what not.
? Bead such words as they sound.


ICON and TALC. ?No. 0 on TIME.?The cartoon we found
numbered 0 was intended to depict T I M E, in the nature of a series of
endless circles having centres on their circum-spheres and circums
cutting through their diams to denote E-TURN-ALL time. The
next circles or cycles within the eternal 0 are termed planet-airy, to
show that each planet rules its daily time by its own evolutions. Then
follows local time, as what?s o-clox?some-thing to know Y ('ll) OUR
daily time Sy-and-bye.
From time not being tangible, or of any governable nature, there re-
quires no God to rule-over it since it cannot be over-ruled, because time
ever was and ever will be, no matter what GOD, gods, d?evils, or men
exist, absolute time itself cannot be X-C H A N G E D, ?in fact the name
itself and its sense says?
T I?M E if you can, or T RI-M E, if you can?t, or find an
ITEM my equal, or smaller or larger from any other.
MET I-physical source, or any term that can
EMIT such MI-T E changes as
ME.
M=loo. E=loo, I=l all throughout these works when used in
words as numerical letters.
Now, as we have several worldly pictures before us pretending to
represent SATURN as the God, or Father of TIME with wings or
what not, as tempus fugit, &c., not one of the earthly authors seems to
know its natural meaning, else why do they so confound the different
terms ofCICLE, CYCLE, CIRCLE, SEIC L E, SYCKLE,
SCYTHE, &c., or 0R A gold with HORA, or HOARY=age,
O?E R=over again, &c. The same with the sands of the ground with
SANDS of time, whereas in our irrefutable plates it simply
shows Saturn as the god of husbandry, with a S I?K L E or
SCYTHE in one hand as emblematical of his godhead, and CYCLE
of the year as the name for house-bonding the grain, &c., hence he is de-
picted with a barrel of ale by his side with an ora=o R O=A U R A=
gold goblet in his left hand, using certain gestures and words with no
other reference to time than its time to drink bAoys drink.
The hora is up, to take your cup, and rest till the horn,
Warn thee to rise, while OUR warm S CIE S shine, to SI C?L B
the corn.
TALC No. 1 on SP A C E.?Cartoon deux alludes to eternal space
as U N?C IRC L E without any circum-sphere, it is therefore
classed as BE-IN-G IN FINITE and INFINITE, and what
space is infinite takes its SENT-OR from the SOL-OR ORB to
where its solor influence can reach, which said S P?A C E extends to the
B?A C (S) E of the fix'd stars, whose exact numbers mean distances, and
every matter connected with them can be seen in other works; not so
beyond the finite world, where infinity reigns under the quiet D 0-
MINION of Quietus, the god of C H A O S, whose KIN G-D 0 0 M is
therefore immaterial to the P RE-SENT material W (H) ORL D,
whose original major term and number was first wrote in the ENGELS
speech=lol.
SPACE and minor sum=A-R E-A.
P A C E=a definite and indefinite word, as to go A P A C E, A P A C E
A C E=one, to show ethereal space ever was and ever will be.
C E=this or that?C A?as ca et la, etc.
E=loo, as a numerical letter.
A-R E-A being the special term for the universal area of space it was
so D E (I) SIG N E D to signify by the change of its three letters.


A=the AlphA of All Almighty Articles, A, A N, fee.,
R E=over A-G A I N, sometimes signifies K I N-G.
R B A=Queen, or moreover D E A, as I-U NO the goddess of
A E R?whose air ye all breathe, hence cannot do without.
A R E=thou art, airs thee hath also?yet in the
R B A R of true godliness, thee live and die when compared to the
RARE souls that ARE in the RARE A B R thee live and move
and have your B E-I N-G.
* Then again from AREA being an original godly name, it follows
that since A=one, and E one hundred, while R counts nought, it shows
that by the simplest of algebraical formulas that Ax R E x A=lo2
A?R E x A x R E x A= 100, so that it follows figuratively
speaking the divine A?R E?A can never exceed its primitive ARE A==
102, and only smallest when the two AlphA?s are subtracted to leave 99,
because its everlasting AREA cannot be multiplied, or divided.
See the whole nature of time and space in our other works, where it
will be most scientifically shown that time and space were the first and
will be the last co-existant, co-equal, co-eternals in nature, since they
existed long before any G O (0) D an D?evil became so antagonistic,
and which was not until after the nucleus or spirits of C?O L D and
CALORIC were spontaneously created, C?O L D being the OLD-est,
strongest, and most durable, because F R I-GI DOS at only 66 � above
the freezing point will prevent any matter from corruptness so long as
it is enclosed air tight within its frigid powers, while heat at only 66 �
above zero will eventually oxidise or decompose any earthly matter save
4 substances. If then the principle of FR 01 D is so positive at 66 �
B. Z., what would it be at 666 � but more positive still , and yet we can
show the greatest cold of the immaterial world equal 6666 � below this
petty planets, ZerO. Then, pray, Mr. Philo, how long would it take the
principles of SOL-0 R-H EA T, whose extreme warmth can never
exceed 6666 � A. Z., to negative the positive hold of Master Freddo.
Even granted that SOL is the S0 L O-S O (U) L of T-HIS UNI-
VERS, it will not always remain so, since every godly astronomer
ought to know the annual ratio each and all the planets are being
FORCED towards their C R E-AT-0 R (not attracted'). Even then,
neither time nor space will be annihilated, though all creation RE-
Y E R T to chaos as shown in the next Icons.
ICON, No. 3 on C H A 0 S==X A O Z.?Comprised talc cartoons re-
presenting this UNI-VER S (=one-vers), at the time when Holy
Writ says, ?GOD said let there be light, and there was light,? and
which glimmering was no sooner rendered visible than it was pronounced
G O (O) D ; hence was therefrom called DEI, and darkness D I E, so
that the conjoint terms were wrote DIE M=24 eaithly hours, while the
SAME F?O U R letters transposed to D B I-M=looo terrestrial years.
Thus there was one D B I-M between each E V E-I N-G and MORN-
I N-G equal to a space of time measured by 1000 orbicular rounds of
THIS planet, so that with the gods one celestial D E I-M (1000 years)
is but as one earthly DIEM. Nevertheless, it naturally followed that
when the O M N I-P O T E N T spirit of G (O) O D overcame QUIETUS,
the MOST POTENT D?E VIL of darkness, &c., then J E-0 Y A
became the irresistible S O (U) L of light, life, motion, and libration,
while the D?evil?s remained the IN-F ERNAL De-M ON of darkness,
death, and damnation. These talcs also plainly set forth the natural
modus operandi in which TIME, SPACE, MATERIALITY,
and MOTION were originated, and that without any such insane
ideas as to suppose GOD made himself, S A-T A N and all creation out
of nothing. If so, heaven, hell, and the earth must all be nothing,
since an old proverb says, nothing ventured, nothing had.
After all, how can it be expected that the wisest of H E-ARTS can
ever of themselves truly comprehend that which is above the mental


capacity of the most enlivened dust to duly ascertain, since men are not
gods that they know the workings of heaven. Neither are they devils
enough to under-stewZ the real nature of hell before entering the con-
fines of Pluto?s KIN G-D OO M. They may then have spirits sufficient
to see, hear, and FEELthe follies of their own ignorance.
N.B.?We have the pleasure of informing the outer world the greater
portion of the above quoted antediluvianas are at hand duly translated
sufficient for several lectures or books when the public are williug to
hear them, but which can never be so long as they are so bigoted as to
seriously believe the Almighty did actually perform all his created
works at so much per DIE Mof 24 hours, in the room of aDE IM=
1000 years,' and which was well known to all the wise fathers, or why
doth your own sacred Scriptures in 11 Peter say ?? But beloved, be not
ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand
years, and a thousand years as one day.?
Now to show the term D EIM and its rotes were penned by the
wisdom of gods and not of men, we herewith transcribe a portion to
show everything of consequence that pertains to the same is included,
as?
D=soo?D E=of?this, that, or, from, any.
D E I=D BIT Y=day, power, &c.
D E I?M=God x M=looo?hence 1000 years.
DI E?M=loo0 ?M INI, parts,?before 1440 was used.
DEM I=half, as a dei or die
100 E 1
DIM B= in letters ? =
1000 M 10
MI D=middle. D I M=dull, obscure, &c.
ICON 4, ON CREATION of the earth, &c.?These talc?s depict
this mundane SP-HERE, during the second deivi of creative energy
after the G L O?W IN G GLOB E had cooled sufficient to allow certain
terra-jirmA to be seen in the midst of its waters, so that GOD
divided the waters that were under the firmA from the waters above it,
&c., then pray, Mr. Science, doth not such divine F?A C T S (first acts)
absolutely prove that the spirit of G O (O) D well knew the roundness of
his own handiwork (whether a few ignorant Grecians believed it or not),
else why was it Scriptified that H E measured the waters in the hollow
of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended
the dust of the earth. * * * * Then again, ? Have ye not known ?
Have ye not heard ? Hath it not been told you from the beginning ;
have ye not understood from the S T-A R T of the world who is H E
that sitteth upon the CI RC L B of the earth where the inhabitants
thereof as are grasshoppers and besides, what did I-S A?-I AH (I say
God) mean when he said, ? The earth shall reel to and fro like a drun-
kard, and shall be removed like a cottage,? were it not globular, else
how could hell from beneath thee be moved at T H Y com?in?, when it
stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth, * *
As some first proof there was to be such an internal place of TO R-
M B N T we have ICONS representing this GEO?S, GEOLOGICAL
conformation, mean thickness of the earthy S-Hell that envelopes the
igni-potent S P-H ERE before any serious surface descriptions occurred.
In our studious years we often used to waste hours pondering over
the varied theories of sublunary bipeds, and yet never found any two
authorities that actually agreed upon any natural abstruse subject. But
since it hath been our good fate to be allowed to peer into the divine
secrets of infallibility, we do not envy the presumption of Popes and
other pretenders, as we cannot but feel amused at the vagaries, ignor-
ance, and pretension of mortals in assuming to D E-M O N-S T R A (I) T B
how this, that, and the other occurred, yea even how the crookedness of
certain terrestrial stratification have been formed, chrystalized, baked,


or what not, by some maintaining it is D U E to igneous fusions or by
liquid con-fusions which they are pleased to denominate Neptunic or
Plutonic actions, and that without seriously believing in the supernatural
powers of either the God of water or of fire, and yet they are the two
most antagonistical spirits in nature, as the DEUCE always begins
HI S-SIN Gat every contact between fire and water, because he knows
that water is at present his master, yet will not always remain so.
ICON 5 on DEIM 3rd.?Exhibits the deim when this earth was
bringing forth its first vegetation from the primitial grasses to sublime
forest trees, and also showing that the greenest or grayest of grasshoppers
with all their cleving, cleverness, and break-jaw no-men-clatter
canever pro-po -get any other distinct genus of plants than what wise-
doom primarily planted on this planet for the S O L (E) U S-A G E S of
P R O-V ID E-H ENCE, simply because nature ordained every plant of
the field before it was on the earth, and every herb of the field before it
grew, for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and
there was not a man to till the G?R 0 U N D, until after the Deities em-
hodyed themselves and began to form their sacred garden eastward of
Eden.
It was at this deim that the whole uncooled earth may be likened to
some universal hot-house, where the sun itself was obscured, and the
earth below just warm enough to force the rising of vegetation, with
nothing to prevent verdure from increasing unobstructed for a DEIM,
as shown in the next Icons.
ICON 6 on the 4th DEI M.?lncludes a series of talcose leaves of
such natural facts as to convey to the human mind the deim when and
how the SOL-OR-ORB LUNAR phenomenas, SIDE-REAL
heavens, &c., were created, and-by what simple OMNI-SCIENCE
those heavenly lights were rendered visible enough to reproduce alter-
nate days and nights, through the ever-lasting motions of planet-airy
evolutions. These cartoons also define the actual formation of the
enlightened side of uncreated eternity and its mean distance from the
SEN T-0 R of finite space as well as the original number of the C?O L D
stars, both floating and fixed, that stare so de-light-full at the moving
worlds beneath them, and whose twinkling emanations arise from
solar reflection, simply because there ever must be two opposite points
and opposing powers in nature, such as between GOD and DEVIL,
cold and heat, light and darkness, life and death, fire and water, &c.
Then as S 0 L is the SOLE magi-zine of nature?s light, heat, and
life, so must the extremes be the abode of eternal darkness, cold, and
death. Thus it must naturally follow that as the sun can only extend
its almighty powers as far as it can shine, and as such transmitted light
caunot be absorbed (like heat), it must naturally reverberate, so that
ethereal space can only exist in one continuous state of aerial motions
and commotions, from the aerial heat trying to melt or burst the cold
nitrogenic stars to maintain the natural materiality of nature?s require-
ments, whereas the spirit of cold and darkness is always striving to
regain the end it was driven from, when GOD said Let the air be
light,? and the dark air became light therefrom. For further particulars
see our works and cartoons.
However, it was during the latter part of this DEIM that a great
portion of the warm, moist, rapid grown herbage, &c., that begun to
spring up the last DEIM were first suddenly overthrown, and finally
converted into what is now termed COAL, CULM, SHALE,
BITUMEN, or LIGNEOUS products, &c. Now as we have at
command most of this deim?s transactions duly transcribed, it will soon
be shown how futile it is for any earth-tick or lunatick to tick down
the workings of natural causes and effects, not only as regards the
origin, generation, and intended application of earthy FUEL, which
was not ordained for the SOLE use of a PEU(HB)L bound


S0 U L?S, but most for the purposes that will be shown elsewhere. In
the meantime, it may be as well to assert that we have the most divine
authority for saying that it was during this eventful period the solid
earth was so D E (I) RA N G E D as to change its polar axis of rotation
about 22* degrees, thereby suddenly changing the quiescent levels of
seas (there being then no lakes, rivers, or rain water), to one universal
scene of D I S-ruption, as rivers, lakes, hills, dales, coal beds, mineral
deposits, or what not, now truly testify, so as to prepare its geo-logical
conformations and geo-graphical exterior to become more suitable for
the reception of the present constitution of fishes, birds, animals, and
those svb-se-qwent animas known as you-men-K IND, whose KIND-
RED blood is perhaps the most xm.-kind to T?H E I R own hind than any
other hind of KI NE or full grown ani-mal-culce. Oh proud, M I-T E
man, what are ye out of your own conceit, did thee but truly ?KNOW
THYSELF,? and for what agreed purpose thou wert created a
LT N K ?twixt GOD an-Devil, Then since ye are but a M (E) A N
?tween the P-AI R why not try and keep thy earthy body and heavenly
(given) soul travelling in the M E-DI-U M path so as to be contented in
that station of life your Lord hath placed you, and not be travailing or
squabbling about things the wisest among you can't prove, which, witch,
is wich : or will the most lying medium clairvoyant, spirit-rapper, table
mover, or other pretender to unnatural powers, dare to declare to us in
the face of heaven that he, she, or they can exhibit greater supernatural
wisdom in the most occult science than their O-B E-D lE-N T servant,
G. F. GOBLE.
ICON 7 on sth DEI M.?These cartoons most simply describe how
the waters of life first brought forth every living creature from the
largest W-Hale down to the smallest Y E R-M E N, including the lowest
winged insects up to the highest flyers, also in the most simplest manner
proving that what are now termed HENS were MAID long before
EGGS, since it shows that the female of every natural specie
EGGSISTED and were matured years before any males began
T?H E I R R E-creations to bring forth each speciality after their own
unchangeable natures, forms, colors, voices, instincts, and other co-
eternal inheritances, beyond the power of any DEU S E to seriously
disarrange their pre-de-termined organisations. Be pleased to remember
it was during this deim that most every existing specie on earth was
created, but only the females of every KIND, and that they
were then universally produced irrespective of climate, and yet were all
destroyed, the gods did not deem meet to make the male after the
respective kind they wished to propagate with mortal lives, whereas
the first B?A TC H had no natural term of death D E (I) SI G N ED,
so that wherever any antediluvian skeleton (previous to Adam) is found,
such could only have been of the impregnatable female class, for reasons
shown in our irrefutable leaves which we defy not only man, but the
Devil himself to D I S-P ROVE, since we have OUR God?s words for
its truth.
There were varied S H (E) ADE S of A-B-0 R I-G IN Sin various
parts of the earth long before Adam, and afterwards, from the mer-maid
(but no mer-men), fairy ELVES, down to_ your unfair SELVES;
in short, the divine sense of ahorigins speaks its own nature plain enough
for sensible souls to comprehend, no matter what their prejudices were,
as it says ?
A=A L P H A=first, as one.
B=the next, as the verb 2-B, ?to be.
A B=A B-B A==papa, father, teacher, or what not.
O R I=hoary, old, original.
GI N=females, man-traps, yet there were no men, or wo (mb) men until
after some godly agreement was made to make man after their own


image, and so that in point of actual fact A-B?-O RIG IN can only
be truly applied to A-B (lack) ORIGIN.
ICON 8 on 6th DEI M.?Represents this planet after a space equal
to 5000 earthly years hath rolled over, and when the spirit of eternal
life made the beast and cattle after their kine prior to making man after
their own likeness, See.
These sybiline leaves truly explain how animation of every kind
came to grow so diversified and immutable to their past, present, and
future unchangeableness, and that without any other system of grada-
tion than of gradual development, with the exception of the Devil-hope-
ment of the genus Homo, whose art-full genius is more derived from
written geniologies than from any inborn pro-pen-city.
In fact, you-men-nature is no other than a M 0 N-grel REA (R)-R E D
blooded animal, made by and with special under-standing so as to be
endowed with the knowledge how to subdue all other creatures, and yet
have the wisest mortals ever truly shown by what efficient means their
fellow creatures are able to subdue other earthlings ? It is not from any
superhuman strength, superior sagacity, long life, or inherent wisdom,
but merely by the AID of the spirit of HADES (their spirit-you-all
instigator), else what would all mankind?s boasted knowledge and ART-
FUEL applications be, did not the god of fire allow his F RI-E N D S
to use and abuse his special hell-he-meant to suit their own SIN-IS-T E R
purposes. Only take away the knowledge how to maintain fires that
are no more absolutely necessary for the R E-production of men than for
monkeys or other bi-pe-dial lives, so that were domineering man to only
loose the free use of F E U (L) how much less F E U-D would there be
in every sense, and how soon would the GEN I-U S of the greatest
6ENI become less in-geni-ous'and far less geni-culated in every way.
There were times and places where lived a race of the fair daughters of
men that knew not the nature of SIN-GING, only SING-1 N-G,
consequently the god of fire had no claim upon them for their past
deeds, neither was it till after his pro-to-type Cain during his va-ga-
bond-age began to L?earn certain A-B-0 RI-GIN S the presumed
bles-SINQS of fire, and which foolish men then began to transpose
their own name of SIN GE*toIG N E S, A-D IE U-R AT IO NS, and
yet how much more truly happy and godly would the living world have
grown had the pro-geni of Cain did as the other P?Apes did, bid adieu to
such god?s rations. However, whether it signifies a-dieu-ration, adder-
ration, or A-D O-ration, it is now too late to bid adieu to fire since it
hath become such A-D 0 as to please its instigator, and also to become
the dividing L?ink ?twixt man and the brute creation, but so long as
present ignorance is bliss its perhaps folly to prate of future blisters.
ICON 9 on T H E-O-G 0N y, &c.?Commence with THE-O-gony
THE-O-crasy, and true source of THE-O-LOGY concerning those
selfsame Gods that were wont to talk and walk about their gardens east-
ward of Eden above, a DE I?M before A-Dom was created to MAN-
URE and keep it in 0 R-D U R E, &c.
These sacred talc?s also actually D E (I)-scribe when, where, and how
the Dei-ties themselves were em-bo-died', and for what specific intent
each of the immortals were incarnated, and how they had supernatural
powers to cause their mortal parts to decay, die, change, or re-embody
their own celeste soul, as well as stating the various PER 1-0 D S each
PERI remained visible to earthites, with every matter pertaining to
the real nature of Gods, and from whence their I-S 0 L-ated spirits
came, and why such deities CON-DESCENDED to leave their own
spheres to visit this dirty terri-tory of * * * to assist
making A-D A M of dust, &c.
? French word for ape.


Now to prove that our divine TA L C is right, and the talk of mortal
divines wrong, we are perfectly willing to publicly meet any body or
soul of any SEX, SECT, or SECTION, whether mini-stars of God,
the Devil, or of men, since it is only for them to show by their earthly
wisdom that such poor illiterate fellows as U S are more ignorant than
our disputants on the purest of theological subjects, or on any '
or verse, in either their own S A-C EEEDBI-B LB, TEST AME NT,
TAL?MUD, ALCORAN, or what not, down to the end of this sin-
full world. So that faith-full minds may glean from our innocent
logical logomachy who can write right RITES for man to believe.
Ye would like to meet the Pope himself or any of his pretensious in-
fallibles, if only to show that his holiness hath wilfully condemned his
own soul in the eyes of 0 U R G OD, first in professing to stay the
ingress of certain souls from entering a HOLEY place that he cannot
as much as prevent his own from going there to be purified, even
granted the purest of all mankind went there and back in three days,
how long might it take an old sinner to obtain similar purification .
Secondly, how can any Pope profess to claim infallibility when their
own C � N-S CIB NC E knows their own H E-A RTS are not so.
Thirdly, the present Pope hath vainly fulminated impotent threats on a
society in which himself was once a member, therefore committed
perjury. Lastly, we have no objections to go to logger-heading with
those ugly animals who publicly declare that their great-G OD-
FATHER was as ignorant as themselves, only rather more hairy.
Then as our old adverse-hairy is sometimes styled Old Harry, and was
once a devil among Za-dies, perhaps it is from this vile hairy father his
youngest sons take after. See more on this subject anon.
ICON 10 on Garden of Eden. ?This series of plates delineates the
shape, height, and size of the sacred garden, and how the God of water
pro-pa-gated certain PIS CE S in the River PI S0 N, and how the
God of wine and his inspired ass first grew and pruned grapes, thereby
producing that godly liquor for man?s use and not for mankind to make
asses of themselves by A-B-U S E (a-bad-use;, showing also the area o
land set apart for Saturn, the god of husbandly, for the benign CE RE S,
the goddess of corn, and how she fully perfected the grain W (H) E-E A i
to its utmost weight per bushel, above which no mortal can realize, as
shown in other places as well as the history of Vesta, the goddess of
verdure, the goddess of flowers, the goddess of fruits, &c.
The same IC 0 N?S also plainly depict the actual size and appearance
of the man-sion where the celeste deities dwelt (while in paradise), with
every minutiaj respecting Eden; thereby proving what non-sense
mortals have written and exhibited about paradise and its inhabitants,
when at the same time they neither knew where it was situated, what it
grew, and for what past or future purpose it was D E (I) bIG N E I),
or even why no mortal hath since been allowed to see it and live (to
talk about it. for since holy writ states good gold abounded at A-villa,
and man?s earthly GO D is 60(L)D with hell in it, did but the
impious know where that rich auriferous spot could be found, who
could stay their sacriligious hands but the all potent gods, for the devil
would not, as he would be only too happy to see such sacred deposits
brought forth for his interest.
However, although many persons have ere now been close upon the
sacred inland isle, none knew it or thought of it when seen then as the
deities left their H (E) AV E N near Eden (to go to Mount Olympus
and Mount Ida, where ourselves have often seen good gold), and the
times are close at hand for the most ancient of all generations to be
publicly known, therefore should the gods but allow Living stone to see
and note it to live and reach your-hope all will be well; if not it will


become our imperative duty ere we leave this world to describe its
whereabout in F?O U R words. In the meanwhile we will exhibit
complete models and photos for the inspection of (D I S) believers.
ICON 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, on GE-ANTS. ?Gives out four
superb views describing certain evil G E-AN T S in the very act of being
overthrown (by the irresistible deities) while the sinners were vainly
attempting to scale the earthy H (E) AY E N of the celestials. These if
properly enlarged on about 3 or 400 square feet of canvas will perhaps
attract more visitors when publicly exhibited than any other set of
antediluvianas, simply because it demands no great sense to appreciate
and acknowledge their divine originality, and to perceive how the
boisterous mortals deceived themselves by presuming to attack uncon-
querable immortality, who in only one D I E?M cut off every living soul
of that infernal race of gigantic monsters, none scarce less than ten
English feet high, with muscular powers in proportion. But what is
brute force against invulnerability ? Th\B first B A T-H ELL between
Gods and men took place 127 years before A.M., that is, before AdaM?
-5873 after creation of the earth itself, as can be truly shown elsewhere,
and was also the cause of the text where it states ? There were giants
on the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God (s)
came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children unto them,
the same became mighty men, which mere of old men of renown, * *
ICON 15th, GIANT?S TRlAL.?These sheets give out the real
trial of the four conspirators, that being all the lives that were spared
for that purpose, although nearly smashed to pieces, but being born of
an immortal parent could not easily die ; nevermore, they were each
duly arraigned, condemned, bound in chains, and dropped alive into the
bottomless pit at the very same time that their cunning arch-angel and
originator was sent out of the same HAVEN for conspiracy, blasphemy,
lying, and immorality. But had not the D?evil been his own LAW-
HERE perhaps he might have been less punished, but by adding lies
and blasphemy to the actual crime, it was all added to his sentence. At
any rate it evidently proves that as the evil god was sent-hence to
remain in his own H B L L-H E-M BANT for one D E I?M he could
not in per-SIN have been in the garden of' Eden to D?ce-E V E A-D A M,
or to T H I?E V E himself, nevertheless a pro-to-type of the D?evil did
so, as will be shown presently.
In the interim we cannot help remarking that no matter seems more
unnatural to our simple brains than for those mortal souls who style
themselves god?s creatures, to deny the pre-existence of those immortal
spirits who were the actual originators of every matter on earth, heaven,
or hell. Now if such is seriously the case, is it not high time a complete
X-A NG E of gods, angels, men, and manners take place, so that the
promised thousand gross of pure dealers may begin to buy and sell us
de novo. Whether or no, will not 144 Mof pure M E-R IN OS be rather
difficult to obtain, unless very young LAMBS of the God whose
mystical number is six hundred three score and six. For the correct
solution of the above serious D?R E A M S see our series of R B A M S on
the due fulfilment of OUR GO D?S pro-phets-eyes.
CARTOON 16 on Vulcan.?Fully explains the terrestrial birth
and berthe of Volxan, the divine architext god of smithery, &c., who was
800 years old when his SIRE was THR-OWN into his OWN
INTERNAL SP-HERE to stay at home to mind his OWN
BUSV-NEST.
However, the who-le life and good actions of this wise deity fills a
goodly volume, also showing how a living soul incarnated (by even the
devil incarnate), may live by good conduct and virtuous precepts, as to
become companions of the very highest powers (on earth) since we will
prove that Vulcan?s sire was no other than the god of fire, from which
Inherency his son grew so expert at smithery, &c., while his mother


Pomana was buried alive in the sacred G?rounds for breaking her vestal
vows of chastity, and yet although deities were all endowed with divine
wisdom there may be trials and deceptions that even the most virtuous
can scarce resist; in short, we feel satisfied that whoever hears the
unfortunate history of the first PO-M AN-A, and how the evil one
deceived her while walking by herself in the garden of Eden (on the
Hiddekel below the Pison and Gihon) on a bitter cold day. when she was
kindly asked by a handsome looking man to sit down and warm herself
comfortably ; so far there was no H?ARM-D ONE, it was
when pressed to S?WALLOW a wee drop of the CRAiER,
without knowing from what infernal CRAT B R the V lAL spirit
was BR E W?D, or how she might mallow in sin afterwards. However,
having once tasted the infernal lie-queer abd lost her chastity, she could
no longer sit with the pure immortals. Nevertheless, although heaven
could not revoke its own laws, her BIER was followed by all the
deities, in the manner we will truly show.
Please recollect that Satan is no D E I-T Y, but the god of DIE,
DI A-bolus, DI A-vola, &c.
Now, although there hath been so much silly nonsense written about
Satan and Vulcan being cast out of some imaginary heaven, it was not
until 2000 years after the god of fire was sent into the lower regions
that the good old Vulcan was hurled by the unconquerable arm of
JB-0 V A from Mount Olympus for making iron fetters to manacle his
own Lord and master, and for siding with his foster-mother Juno, and
yet he afterwards took his seat as before among the happy celestials,
although crippled by falling a few fathoms from a spot we have our-
selves often seen, and also saw the exact place he had his forges when
he made the invulnerable armour for the gods, Achilles, &c., true photos
of which can be had from us.
It was Vulcan that founded Thebes when he erected such a brass
foundry as to cast 100 brazen gates for his city, aS IT B that celestial
architect began (soon after men began to call upon the Lord), with no
other mortal aid than the ordinary A-B-original sons and daughters ot
MEN from the N I-G E R, and which N I G-B R serves he so taught to
work and study that by the tenth generation they had not only forgot
all the primitive habits of their ancestors, but became the cleverest men
then on earth, until they grew so vain, presumptuous, knowing, rich,
luxurious, profligate, and effeminate, that soon after their divine patron
left them to rejoin his almighty Lord Jove to go to Olympus, and then
the most beautiful city on earth was destroyed, and hath never risen
since. Such is the fate of cities and empires. Soon as they grow rich
and powerful they forget their own origin and the living God that
worked with their forefathers for their sons ulterior benefit.
ICON on CUPID or ERO S. ?This cartoon offers correct versions
how the deceitful Cupid was R E A-R ED, and the real of
B?E AU S and EROS, which last four letters transpose toKUbEb,
SORES, ERRORS, &c., thereby explaining why so many sore
things are so often D?O N E under the rose, and why there are no (such)
roses without T?H ORN S. Giving out also the dividing CHORDS
between love and lust, as well as the origin of M A-T RI-M ONE Y,
P A-T R I-MONEY, HONEYMOON, and other similar expressions
from the fickle minded deuce of hearts whose foster-mother was Venus,
the goddess of B?E A U-T Y, while his spiritual M A-T E R R A was once
the goddess Flora, who like her sister Pomana was buried alive tor
allowing her sworn chastity 2 B C Deuced by the blax dense in the
same BADas he did the goddess of fruit. In the first place the word
CUPID signified cupid-ity, so that from his arch ways he had no lack
of lows, therefore deemed the most useless of all the terrestrial deities,
and was not admitted into the upper circle of paradise any higher than
the Gihon, in fact his name of CUP ID got reversed to DI-P UO, to


mean a kind of D I -dholic sprite, therefore was never in the first "onset
considered of any value until silly poets (after the flood) began to use
his name ; consequently, since he hath become such a general favorite
with modem ladies we can supply them with copies from the original
carte de risite of the little blax-heart for their albums, or what not; at
the same time feel bound to remind purchasers that the naked rascal
with his bows and arrows is only an arch sprite but no archer, because
the above terms first alluded to certain boughs and errors, while'the
word now wrote darts implied D?arts=D?evil?s arts=D?H EART, &c.,
as shown in the cartoon ; in fact, when the little cupid fellow grew up
to maturity he had always plenty of silly sweet-hearts willing to lay in
C?LOYER * * *
However, he only lived his D EIM as Cupid and no more, we say
HIS, hiss would be more appropriate for such a sneak in the grass,
because in reality from not being born or had any other birth than a
snug herth in the C U S?P of a rose, and from which he, she, or it was
termed a R O-S E chub, and yet lovers do not now seem to know that it
was a blax-rose the impotent purblind mophrodite was B?R E D and
because the lovely Venus found the foundling some malicious puc gave
out it was the goddess of beauty?s own fond-ling after she became
the RUD-B baby foster-mother. Then again mythological scribes
pretended to make out that the R O-S E Yenus herself A-R O S E from
the F?ROTH of the sea and similar frothy stuff ?mere sham, to
mystify the future world, and yet it?s true that the RO-SE Cupid
A-R 0S E from AROSE that arose with other roses 9 moons after
the Goddess of Roses was buried alive, and from being immortal only
her earthly parts could decay, while her eternal spirit underwent re-
in-carnation in the cusp of a blax carnation colou�ED ROSE.
There are no less than 12 cartoons that pourtray the exact likeness,
height, size, shape, nature, and special endowments pertaining to a
dozen deities, from the blax-heart Satan the god of fire to the Lord
Jeovathe God of air, &c. Now just to prove the greatest scholars on
earth are born and brought up in as great ignorance of any absolute
truism as their more illiterate fellows, it is only for truth to simply ask
from what sort of ideas was the Greek Eta subsequently introduced
within the body of J E (H) OVA (H) when omniscience wrote J E-0 V A
or A-J OV E, and as some divine proof that glory-us deity is not only
the eternal spirit of ethereal space in which ye all live, move, and have
your being, but is also the originator and god of speech, since no pure
word in the Engel?s tongue could be pronounced without using at least
one of the vowels ye are pleased to sequent as A E I O U, which are
no other than what transposes to I E O Y A, as A I 0 V E, the father of
gods and ruler of men. Why then deny your GOD, FATHER,
simply because he hath several names. By Jove, ye swear ; by Jehovah
ye lie; since Jove, a-li-as Jehova, is but NIX-naming your own
eternal God ye cannot live without, no matter of what sex, sect, or
section of earth-ticks or lunaticks ye belong unto. Secondly, will the
most learned theologian truly set forth who and what was the living
God of the Hebrews that met the man Moses, and called himself lam
that high (H) AM, but was not known by the name of Jehovah, i.e.,
Jupiter, or Japeth, and whose disincarnated spirit again became the god
of the air, when Ham the Cham of the royal ark reverted to his own
element as Neptune the God of the sea, while the D?A R K SE M
eventually became the S E M-PI T-ernal spirit of the lower world, as
PLUT O S, which if transposed shows SOULS, because he is DEI
JU RE the supreme, ruler of souls in HadeS. As other cartoons will
evidently testify beyond the most godly or ungodly to disprove, there-
fore we
Let them laugh that lose while they can,
We are sure to win, in spite of man.


Nevertheless, we wish it to be seriously understood that OUR
LORD JEOYA, the father of gods and ruler of men, hath no more to
do DI E U with the ethereal C R E-AT-0 R than other mini-stars hath
to do with their respective sovereigns than to irrevocably obey the
orders given them to execute ; such and no more were those immortal
living gods that visited this earth from the self created Jove down to the
last DIEU that begat himself as the son of man called Je-sus the
X-RIST whose history weAL?GNE have a faith-ful copy thereof,
&c., &c.
Among the immortals the widest contrast in every way is between
the virtuous, honest, stout, light skinned Neptune, and the immoral
dark skinned Satan, and as they were when on earth in visible shapes
contrary in body, so are they in spirit, being in every sense as antago-
nistic as water and fire can be, always hissing whenever they meet.
Yet though water at present is the earthy master of earthly fires it will
not always be so. Nevermore, through the agency of fire water is made
to slave for the mercenary benefit of mankind, yet it no sooner escapes
from its persecutor (heat) than it soars heavenwards to replenish the
earth as before. Not so fire, for whatever is entirely B?U ENED is
like its ould master, lost for ever.
The embodied life and worldly departure of Neptune to embrace all
his actions from the deim he created fishes to when he became C-Ham
of Noah?s ark, and afterwards built the first walls of the Trojan citadel
down to his burial place would fill a very large and pleasant volume,
without going into the history of his grandson A L B-I ON, the first
royal personage that ruled HAM SH?A RE in your-hope from South-
HAM-town to North-H A M-town, while Japeth and his descendants
took possession of what is now termed Wales, on which lived his son
GOMER on that same mountain now known as Mont-Gomery, no
matter how it hath got subsequently re-named the same.
The actions and transactions of Satan are beyond expression, if it
were to begin from the time he was first turned out of paradise to when
he used to walk to and fro the earth in the days of Job and Christ, down
to the deim when he was chained up near a thousand years ago, so that
he will very soon be entitled to receive a T.L. as a sort of Ticket to
Leave hell for a little season or seizing, so come when he may he will
have his hands full, more particularly now the living world is so full of
SI N-ners preparing their souls for SIN-ders, more particularly them
that deny or deride those immortal spirits that were actually
living deities on this planet, and when they said let us make man after
OUR likeness, &c., and then soon after repented, whereas it was men
that ought to repent, particularly the white SKINS, for are not the
Europeans, like the Egyptians, men, and not gods, and their horses flesh
and not spirit, so that when the L-0 R-D shall smite with his hand both
he that helpeth and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they shall all
fall together, for thus hath the gods spoken unto me. * *
? Whether true or not, a short time will verify. In the meanwhile
where are they ? Where are tty wise men ? Let them tell thee now ,
and let them know what the L 0 R D of hosts hath proposed.? * *
But if ye have uot so much faith in any heavenly prophecy as in your
own earthly profits-high, then our prophets-eye will not be heeded, for
whether any fancy we are merely playing upon words ?or the W-or-D
upon us is of little consequence to the seek-well, or seek-hell, if it sounds
better than SE-QUELL.
At any rate Shakespeare stated that he believed everything was
couched in an original name, which wise assertion we will duly prove,
since the whole GLOBE can be made to Co-I N SID E of the
original GOBLE.

London, 7th April, 1865.
Having carefully examined the mechanical drawings of " Noah?s
Ark,? I have no hesitation in stating that they are harmoniously scien-
tific, and so much in advance of ordinary ideas in shipbuilding that I
trust a few gentlemen of original turn of mind may be induced to
inspect that which will ultimately prove that the art of shipbuilding at
the time that Noah?s Ark was built was based upon the true principles
of geometry as an axiom.
JOHN GLARE, Junk,,
The Inventor and Patentee of H.M, Iron Steam Frigate ? Warrior.? 1
The following is from the Mining Journal :?
Ancient Shipbuilding in advance of Modern. ?Capt. G. F.
Goble has during the past week submitted tb us an elaborate series of
working drawings connected with wood and iron shipbuilding, copied
from original diagrams found in the Summer Palace of the Emperor of
China, and supposed to be many thousands of years old. The construc-
tion of the vessel is in every way remarkable, especially considering the
great antiquity claimed for it; the hull, masts, sails, screws, &c., being
either of a character equal to the most approved arrangement of the
present time, or considerably in advance of them. Capt. Goble is
seeking the co-operation of a few antiquarians, or others interested in
the subject, in order that a working model of the vessel may be built,
and there appears to be no doubt that many very material advantages
will be gained as compared with any ship at present afloat. Not only
are the several portions of the ship itself of the highly efficient character
described, but even the chain cables are apparently superior to those now
in use, though totally different in construction ; they are said to be
capable of bearing a strain of 10,000 tons.
