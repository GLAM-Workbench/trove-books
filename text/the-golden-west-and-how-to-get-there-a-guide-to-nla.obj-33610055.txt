OUTES
OVERLAND ROUTE TO COOLGARDIE.
Sm John 1 orrest, Premier of West Australia, and an experienced
explorer and bushman, referring to the various routes to Cool-
gardie, says :?? The only safe route is by railway to Doodlekine,
which is situated 154 miles from the port of Fremantle, and
362 miles from the port of Albany. From Doodlekine it is
94 miles to Southern Cross, and thence to Coolgardie, 120 miles,
along a good, cleared road, on which the Government has
expended, and is expending, large sums on water supply, and
on which route there are plenty of carriers and food supply.
It is most unwise for anyone to go by Esperance Bay or any
other route tnan that from either Fremantle or Albany by
railway, as above stated. Only trouble and disaster may be
anticipated if my advice is not taken.? Since the above was
written the railway line has been completed, and opened through
to Southern Cross.
Mr. David Lindsay, the explorer, who has a wide experience
of the country south and east of Coolgardie, says <? There is no
doubt about the route ; the nearest and the best route at present
is from Northam, by railway, to Southern Cross.?
COOLGARDIE,
the centre of the Yilgarn field, is situated about 352 miles from Perth.
Ihe quickest to gain access to this place from Perth is to
travel from Perth to Southern Cross by rail?about 236 miles.
Through cheap steamer fares, including rail tickets, via
Aloany lo Northam, Southern Cross, Perth, and Fremantle.
Living is much cheaper on Coolgardie than it was, owing to
the competition between the storekeepers and carriers.

the TRUSTY? otto-cycle OIL ENGINE
Is the CHEAPEST, SIMPLEST,* SAFEST, and altogether THE MOST
SATISFACTORY ENGINE FOR THE GOLD FIELDS, because it CONSUMES
NO WATER, requires NO WOOD, NO COAL, NO BOILER, NO FURNACE
NO ELECTRICITY, NO CONNECTIONS, NO STOKER, NO DRIVER NO
ATTENTION. Ordinary KEROSENE is used, and it consumes only about
HALF-A-PINT of Kerosene PER HORSE POWER PER HOUR.

AS will be seen from the above illustration, there are no complicated
parts to get out of order, and the most inexperienced man can start the
engine in Ten Minutes, When once started, it will run all day without
requiring any further attention. The Engines are made in all sizes from
i-horse power upwards, and as each machine is tested before leaving the works,
we guarantee each machine to give satisfaction.
For Reliability, Economy, Convenience, Safety, and Simplicity, the
?Trusty ? is unequalled.
A Melbourne Syndicate have just purchased one of our ?TRUSTY?
Oil Engines for Coolgardie, to drive Panklast Crusher and Berdan Pans;
and their mining expert selected our engine after having seen all other
makes, and after having put the ? Trusty ? Otto-Cycle to the most
exhaustive tests.

plain, covered with low scrub and spinifex. This is the worst
stage of the road between Southern Cross and Coolgardie, being
totally destitute of both grass and water. Hunt?s Well here has
4t feet of water. On towards Woolgangee, poor soil for five miles.
After this forest country entered, and soil in places is rich and

ROAD GUIDE. ?GERALDTON TO CUE.
Giles? Hotel, 8 miles ; Davis? Store, 23 miles ; River Greenock
(hotel), 35 miles; Cockatea, 55 miles; sandy plain between
Greenock and Cockatea ?a well at 59 miles. Mullewa, 69 miles ;
Danderoo, 77 miles ; Bindoo, 85 miles ; Carlo, 93 miles ; Bumbi-
noo, 103 miles (here there is both store and hotel); Coorora,
114 miles; Long Pool, 126 miles; Gabyon, 134 miles; Bieling,
144 miles (a well); Pindathoona, 159 miles (store and hotel).
There are two tracks from here, and it would be advisable to take
the left-hand one, as it is the best, and the distance by either is
about equal. Warrawarra, 165 miles; Congo, 172 miles (well on
open flat ground). Here the two tracks rejoin. Chinerly, 177
miles (creek, water quite salt); Gulgara, 185 miles (well in creek,
good water) ; Yowli, 201 miles (water good); Wheelara, 215 miles
(old huts occupied by kangaroo hunters) ?creek and well, good
water, 223 miles; Woolgerong, 231 miles; Walgo, 237 miles
(water); Townsend, 241 miles (well); Dead Finish, 257 miles;
Cue, 267 miles. This is the terminus of coach line, and from this
point any part of the Murchison can be reached.
Freight by team from Geraldton to Cue is per ton, but as
the worst part of the road lies between Geraldton and Mullewa, we
have no doubt arrangements could be made with the contractor
to take goods to Mullewa by rail, and thus reduce the cost of transit.
THE ISLAND OF GOLD?LAKE AUSTIN.
A correspondent of the Register thus describes this wonderful
island :?? The island is situated about 18 miles in a southerly
direction from Cue, being as near as possible lat. 27 degs. 26 min.
S., long. 118 degs. 5 min. E. It is towards the northern end of
the lake. Leaving Geraldton, the shortest and most expeditious
way is to take rail to Mingenew, a distance of 80 miles ; thence per
team or buggy to Gorna Well, 7 miles; Nannakine Station, n
miles ; Little Mingenew, 3J miles ; Warraminnie, 4 miles ; Murray,
30 miles ; Gullewa Garden Well, 3 miles ; Edargo, 12 miles

? The island is about three miles long and two miles wide,
being hilly, with here and there undulations to break the altitude.
Several well-defined reefs exist, running almost parallel, and
trending north-east by south-west, with a westerly dip. These
reefs, in places, outcrop to the extent of from about 12 to 20 feet,
and in almost every part where the trying pick has been used,
strong evidence of their gold-bearing nature is clearly distinguish-
able. It much resembles Mount Morgan in its auriferous
character and ferruginous nature with well-defined slates.?

Australasian United Steam Navigation Company Ltd,
INFORMATION AND GENERAL
REGULATIONS.
PASSENGERS.
The Company?s steamers carry first and second class passengers, and the
fares include table and attendance, bedding, linen, and cabin furniture,
baths, etc.
Wines and liquors can be had on board at moderate prices. Passengers are
not allowed to take on board their own wines and spirits.
Each of the steamers carries a stewardess, whose attendance is given free of
charge.
Smoking is prohibited in the saloons, cabins, or between decks, and is
permitted only on such parts of the deck where it may not inconvenience other
passengers.
As it is the Company?s desire to study the comfort and convenience of the
travelling public as far as practicable, any communication to Head Office at
Brisbane, embodying suggestions in that direction, will receive attention, and
any well-grounded complaints will be promptly inquired into.
BOOKING RULES.
All passage money is payable in advance.
Passengers not embarking after engaging passage are liable to forfeit the full
amount of passage money paid.
In case, however, of a passenger being unavoidably prevented from availing
of a passage at the period for which it was taken, a transfer to a subsequent
steamer can be effected on notice being given, without forfeiture, and accommo-
dation will be allotted as similar as circumstances will permit.
No berth or cabin is to be occupied by a passenger without application to
the agent on shore, and it is to be understood that a passenger occupying a
cabin, of two or more berths, on the departure of the vessel (unless he shall have
paid an additional sum for its exclusive occupation) is not to object to the vacant
berth or berths being filled at the intermediate ports, if required. A cabin
containing two berths can be reserved for one passenger on paying the reserved
rate of 50 per cent, additional fare.
Passage tickets issued on board by ship?s officers are charged ss. extra. It
is therefore advisable that all arrangements as to tickets should be completed
before embarking. The other terms on which tickets are issued by the
Company?s steamers are endorsed on each ticket, and these are commended to
the attention of passengers.
CHILDREN.
Children under two years of age, free; no berth provided. Between two
and five years, quarter fare ; between five and twelve years, half fare.
BAGGAGE.
Each first-class adult passenger is allowed 20 cubic feet of personal baggage
free. Second class and servants, 10 cubic feet; children paying half-fares, half
this space. Commercial travellers are allowed 40 cubic feet. Extra luggage
charged according to rates of freight.

General Information.
The cost of living at Coolgardie under canvas may be esti-
mated at from �2 io �2 10s. per week.
The climate of Coolgardie is very fine; the days are often
hot, but there is generally a cool breeze at night. Mosquitoes are
unknown. Considering that there is no attempt at sanitation, the
township is remarkably healthy. Typhoid is, we think, the chief
disease that Coolgardie has to fear. The telegraph line extends
from Perth to Southern Cross.
THE MURCHISON.
Miner?s wages at the Murchison run from �3 10s. to �\ per
week, and living costs about 355. per week ; Geraldton the nearest
port.
I his field, taken as a whole, is exceedingly rich, and will, in
all probability, be found to extend for a great distance to the east-
ward ; but there is no prospect of it extending far to the westward,
owing to the belt of granite country.
Water is abundant and at shallow depths, the Murchison
district being celebrated for this.
Ihe lack of good timber for mining purposes is perhaps the
principal drawback, for, except at the north end of the field, there
is nothing but scrubby mulga and snakewood, which latter is too
crooked even to burn.
Everything considered, this field has probably a brighter out-
look than any other in the colony, owing to the fact that it lias
neither the distance of Kimberley nor the salt water of Yilgarn to
contend with. The water supply being uniformly good, near the
Salt Lakes, if a well is sunk a short distance away the water is
lound fresh, 1 ilbarra and the Ashburton have not as yet proved
to be large reefing districts, so need not be mentioned.

?The
(Miners?
Friend.?
The above cut represents the " Miners? Friend? Gold-Saving Machine?the
simplest and most perfect machine for saving gold by dry process yet invented.
Some of its advantages over all others are
That it saves with certainty all kinds of gold from the finest flour gold
to nuggets.
It is strongly made, and complete within itself, and can be placed in
working order within 15 minutes.
Its construction is extremely simple, having neither bellows, fans, nor
artificial blast of any description, and no gearing to get out of
order and break down.
The daily trials prove its capacity to treat auriferous material at the rate of
three tons per hour, and recover more gold than any other dry process machine
(see Press Reports).
It stands about 3 ft. 6 in. high ; 28 in. diameter ; weight 40 lbs. ; stand extra.
Through the simple motion required, anyone can at once work it without previous
gold-mining experience.
For Price and Further Particulars Apply to

60 to 70 Queen Street, Melbourne .


Two town sites have been laid out by the Government on the
Murchison goldfield, namely, at Nannine and Cue, and lots at
both places are put up to auction at an upset price of �2O each.
Owing to the locale of the first gold discovered, at Lake
Annean, the Warden?s Court and Office have always been situated
there. Subsequent discoveries, however, now make it apparent
that this is by no means the most central position. These
discoveries have extended along the eastern and southern boun-
daries. Thus, gold has been discovered, and workings are now
being carried on, at Abbot?s find, 45 miles north ; at Gardner?s
find (Yagahong), 20 miles east ; at Cue, 50 miles south-west ; at
the Island and the Mainland, in Lake Austin, 70 miles south-west ;
?
at Mount Magnet, 100 miles south-west; and at Yalgoo, some
200 miles west-south-west from the working at Lake Annean.
The roads throughout the district are admirable bush roads.
The distances by them to the different centres of operations are :
To Yalgoo, from railway station at Minginew, about 100 miles ;
to Mount Magnet, from ditto, about 200 miles ; to Cue, from
? *
Geraldton ?the port for the goldfield?about 260 miles; and to
Annean, from ditto, about 310 miles.

Schedule No. 8 hereto annexed, and upon payment of the pre-
scribed fee of two shillings and sixpence, have such area registered
as exempt from the condition of occupation for any peiiod not
exceeding twelve months. Such registration may be renewed
upon payment of a like fee.
Part lII.?PROTECTION AREAS.
11. A miner desirous of prospecting may mark off and hold a
protection area of the following dimensions, viz.:?
Beyond the limits of a proclaimed goldfield, 400 yards by 400
yards.
Within the limits of a proclaimed goldfield and more than
three miles from the nearest gold workings, 300 yards by

marking with at least half the number of miners whose names
appear on the notice as the holders of the area or share therein.
Any area or share not so worked shall be liable to forfeiture. Any
work other than bond fide prospecting shall render such protection
area or share therein liable to forfeiture.
14. Within seven clear days after the finding of gold in
apparently payable quantities within any protection area, the
holder shall report the said finding at the Warden s office under
pain of forfeiture of such area. The Warden shall then proceed
to the ground, and if sufficient gold has been found to warrant it,
he shall allot the prospectors a reward claim in addition to the
number of ordinary claims to which the} T would otherwise be
entitled.
Part IV.?CLAIMS.
15. A miner may take up and w r ork any unoccupied Crown
land as a claim by fixing firmly in the ground, at each corner

deep along each boundary line, such posts to be kept at all times
uncovered : Provided that when registration is required such
miner shall, within ten days after such marking, make application,
in the form of Schedule No. 4 hereto annexed, to the Warden.
The Warden shall thereupon deliver to the applicant a certificate
in the form of Schedule No. 5 hereto annexed, who shall cause it
to be posted on some conspicuous part of the ground applied for,
and a copy thereof at the Warden?s Office, for a period of six clear
working days. If no objection be lodged against such application

Quartz Reef Claims.
19. The term ?reef? shall be taken to mean gold-seam or
quartz or any substance containing gold other than alluvial.
20. The reward claim which shall be given for the discovery
of gold in apparently payable quantities on any new reef, or the
re-discovery of the same on any reef previously occupied and

distance to be on the surface of the ground by the nearest prac-
ticable route. Claims to be measured on the horizontal plane.
21. The extent allowed for each miner in any ordinary quartz
claim shall be 75 feet along the supposed line of reef by a width ol
400 feet. The width of all quartz claims must be marked off at
right angles to the base line, but the whole or any part of such
width may be marked on either side of such line at the option of
the shareholders.
22. All quartz claims must be registered in the manner
prescribed in Clauses 15 and 74 of these regulations, and the names
of the shareholders, together with the dates and numbers of their
miners? rights under which the claim is held, as also the name of
the reef upon which it is situated, and the number of the claim,
must be registered in a book to be kept by the Warden, and a copy
of the entry must always be kept posted at or as near as possible
to the working shaft.


2 3? one-half the number of miners to whom any quartz
claim has been allotted need be employed thereon until it has been
proved payable. W hen payable the whole number must be
employed ; when it ceases to be payable again only one-half the
number of miners need be employed. The onus of proof that the
claim is not payable shall rest upon the shareholders.
24. A claim on a quartz reef shall be deemed to be payable on
notice from the W T arden that he so considers it, such notice to be
posted at the Warden?s Office and on some conspicuous part of the
said claim.
74. The holders of all claims or other authorized mining tene-
ments for which registration is required must apply to the Warden
for registration of the same within ten clear working days from the
date of their being entitled to such registration: Provided thac
non-registration within the prescribed time shall not be deemed a
breach of these Regulations if good cause be shown for such dela} r
to the satisfaction of the W r arden, nor shall any penalty be inflicted
for the non-performance within the prescribed time of any act
required by these Regulations to be done by the holder of any
such claim or mining tenement, if such holder can prove that the
non-performance as aforesaid was caused by the neglect or default
of the Mining Registrar or Warden, or from any circumstance over
which he had no control.
The Schedule forms quoted in above Regulations can be
obtained at the Warden?s Office.
MACHINERY.
As regards mining machinery, we would recommend inspec-
tion of the following:?The ?Trusty? Otto Cycle Oil Engine,
which is most suitable for driving Panklast Crushers. One great
advantage in this engine is that it consumes no water nor fuel, is
perfectly safe, requires no driver when started. Ordinary kerosene
is the motive power ; and, we understand, half a pint per hour
gives off one horse-power per hour. Messrs. Baker & Sons, 317
Flinders Lane, are the Victorian agents. Messrs. Northey,
Siddeley & Co., of 334 Queen Street, are large suppliers of mining
machinery of all kinds, and have lately executed several orders for
Western Australia, and their extensive show-rooms should

certainly be inspected. Messrs. Robinson Bros. Limited, of
Normanby Road, South Melbourne, are agents for an improved
oil engine, by Hornsby & Sons Limited. This works with
ordinary mineral oil, or paraffin oil, and requires no attention
when started, further than keeping up the oil supply in the reser-

the industry has hitherto been neglected in Western Australia,
but, we presume, now that population is increasing so fast, some
attention will be paid to this, followed by the establishment of
jam factories similar to Messrs. Hoadley & Co.?s, of Melbourne,
whose jams (the ?Rising Sun? brand), in addition to holding a
leading position in the Colonial markets, are largely exported to
the United Kingdom.

certainly be inspected. Messrs. Robinson Bros. Limited, of

oil engine, by Hornsby & Sons Limited. This works with
ordinary mineral oil, or paraffin oil, and requires no attention
when started, further than keeping up the oil supply in the reser-

understand, their cost does not exceed half per horse-power per
hour.
A very efficient dry process machine has been patented by
Mr. T. W. Clarke, and can be seen at work daily, at 214 Queen
Street. The Argus of March 26th says of this machine, ?It is
light, strong, and simple, yet very ingenious, and in all respects
worthy the name of ?The Miner?s briend,? under which it has
been patented. At a trial, a quantity of the finest flour gold was
put through and recovered, and all present expressed their
complete satisfaction with its working. The machine is a very
valuable substitute for dry blowing where water is scarce and gold
free, and the cost is within reach of all, and it can be worked
with ease by one man.?
Miners intending to prospect for gold-bearing reefs cannot
do better than inspect the ? Panklast Crusher,? which for testing
quartz is a most complete and handy little machine. Messrs.
Guthridge & Co., 482 Collins Street, are the agents.
Messrs. Grindrod & Carter, no Victoria Street, Carlton,
have also for sale an improved hand-power crusher, which is well
worth inspection.
FRUIT GROWING.
Though possessing such a suitable climate for fruit growing,
the industry has hitherto been neglected in Western Australia,
but, we presume, now that population is increasing so fast, some
attention will be paid to this, followed by the establishment of
jam factories similar to Messrs. Hoadley & Co.?s, of Melbourne,
whose jams (the ?Rising Sun? brand), in addition to holding a
leading position in the Colonial markets, are largely exported to
the United Kingdom.

Outfits.
The most articles to be provided are, first, a good
tent][(say|B by 10) with fly, for every two men ?the tent should be
of light but strong material; enamelled plates and cups, sheath
knife '/and on no account forgetting a pocket compass the latter
to be carried in the pocket of a leather belt, in fact the belt should
hold a large leathern pouch for general purposes, a sheath for the
knife, a pocket for the compass, and another for the watch. It
would also be advisable to take two or three pack and ordinary
saddles, such as supplied by Stranaghan, 43 Eastern Market,
Melbourne; a shot gun will be found very useful on occasions, as
pigeons are fairly plentiful round the soaks ; a revolver is not
necessary, but we think it would be a wise provision. \\ e would
strongly recommend purchasing all the principal items required
for equipment before leaving port of departure. As regards
tools, each party should be provided with a hammer, cold chisels,
cutters, soldering iron, and the usual mining tools ; including a
wire sieve, which, if not provided before leaving, will be most
expensive to purchase on the field ; a suitable one can be obtained
at P. Yonng?s, Wire Works, 263 Little Lonsdale Street, Melbourne.
Amongst the latter we would most strongly recommend miners to
provide themselves with a ? Camm ? patent pick. This most useful
and portable tool requires only one handle to twelve removable points,
the latter not taking up more room or making more weight than as
many ordinary chisels. This pick is, without doubt, the handiest
and most convenient prospector?s tool yet invented ; and can be
used either as a single or double end pick. Messrs. Alfred Shaw
and Co., Little Collins Street, are the Victorian agents ; and we
would strongly advise inspection.


A is a necessity ; and there are several good and
portable ones in the market, notably those manufactured by
Robison Bros., Yarra Bank, which are made of copper, and weigh
only 9 lbs., capacity up to 12 pints per hour, the whole forming a
very handy and compact article. Another good and light one, weigh-
ing about 10 lbs., with a capacity of 7 pints per hour, is manu-
factured by the South Melbourne Copper Works, 60 City Road,
South Melbourne; also Messrs. Reid, Morgan, Reid & Charlton,
of South Melbourne, are manufacturing a light copper condenser,
8 lbs., which fits together within a very small compass, being
i�2 inches in diameter and 71 inches deep when folded-
in fact, no laiger than a fair sized billy?and has a capacity
up to 12 pints per hour. The bottom portion of these
conuensers can he used as buckets or for boiling water for tea ?
saving carrying a billy. The above-mentioned firms have also on
nand condensers of a much higher capacity ; but those specified by
us can be easily carried by hand. As regards clothing, it would
be advisable to be provided with trousers of twilled Khakee and
shirts of twilled cotton, woollen ones catching too much dust. The
largest, sponge that can be procured is also a very necessary
adjunct.
On arrival in Western Australia, pack-horses should be
procured, also camels. The value of the latter is becoming
generally recognised, for in the summer time a party would come
to a standstill without them, and all who have the means to get
them should do so. Returning to the matter of equipment, we
must not omit to mention a very necessary article, viz,, a small
case with hypodermic syringe and strychnine, to be used in case
of snake-bite.
