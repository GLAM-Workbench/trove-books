Now friends if you?ll attention pay, and list to what I?ll
state,
I?m certain you will pity feel, for my unhappy fate,
I have no flock in Austral?s hush to dodge from tree to tree,
But a Mandarin from China to keep company with me.
Ye gods; to think that one whose sires in honours cause
have bled,
Must now associate daily with a pagan born and bred;
From the dear old ? land o? cakes ? I hail, while from the
realms of tea,
Comes the Mandarin from China to keep company with me.
In shape his lovely frontispiece resembles much the moon,
His mouth is like the ? Cove of Cork,? his nose is like a
spoon,
A liver-coloured, whity-brown, maj enta skin has he,
The Mandarin from China that keeps company with me.


Our cabin from its look was built soon after Noah?s ark,
Roof, sides, and gable ends composed of rotten sheets of
bark,
On rainy days the heavy wet comes pouring down quite free,
On the Mandarin from China, but alas ! likewise on me.
His lingo is most horrible, to listen gives me pain,
So we?ve a code of signals framed, our meaning to explain.
My English puzzles him no doubt, God knows his puzzles
mo,
"Which makes this man from China most indifferent
company.
The place of his nativity I?m sure I cannot tell,
Its no great loss, for if I knew the name I could not spell,
Some crack-jaw words, you may depend are in the pedigree,
Of the Mandarin from China that keeps company with me.
As soon as supper?s cleared away he tumbles on his bunk,
And there his cursed opium puffs until he?s three parts
drunk.
Its whisky I get fuddled on, but it?s smoke sets on the spree,
The Mandarin from China that keeps company with me.
Yet still he has redeeming points, as who on earth has not,
Celestial is the way he works the frying pan and pot;
A first-rate feed he can produce while I?d be counting three,
The Mandarin from China that keeps company with me.
To hump the wood and water too, he never will refuse,
But yet if I could have my way, another mate I?d choose,
With whom I feel quite confident I better could agree,
Than the Mandarin from China, that keeps company with


There breathed a few months ago in a small town on this mighty-
continent, a man whose nameTwas Thomas Jones, who was by trade
a maker and mender of boots, &c. This Tom, poor fellow, had the
misfortune to be born a cripple ; notwithstanding which he lived to
? earn a reputation, for he was as fine a soler and heeler ? as ever
whacked lapstone. For a number of years, and till within a few
months of his death, Tom had been a fervent worshipper of
? Bacchus,? a land of fish, only that he preferred the flavour of brandy
to that of salt. On hearing of Tom?s love for brandy, whiskey, &c.,
a good ?? Templar ? sought him out, andso carried away was this poor
cripple by the persuasive eloquence of the ? Templar ? that Tom was
induced to enrol himself under the banner of the 1.0.G.T.?5. Tem-
plarism evidently did not agree with him, for after three months
persistency, Thomas succumbed to ? temperate habits,? at least so
said more than one M.D. Well done Tom ! Thou shalt be immortalized
for thy persistency.
Par away down below, in the regions of woe,
They?re roasting poor Tom Jones the cripple ;
Bad luck did he see, since the 1.0. G.T.,
Got the fool to abandon his tipple.

Being a sketch of an eventful married life. Twelve
after marriage.
Jessemah to Garlossa.
Gome husband sit by me a while,
And heed what I?ve to say,
?Tis just twelve months Garlossa since
I gave myself away.
I did not dream one year ago
Your love so soon would fade ;
Have you forgot Garlossa dear,
The sacred vow you made ?
Your honey?d words I did believe,
I saw no cause for fear,
My life it seem?d a paradise
When you, Carloss, were near.
I?ve loved you with a woman?s love,
I?ve been a faithful wife,
I?ve honour?d and obeyed, Carloss,
And will do while I?ve life.


Garlussa.
My own, my wee, my gentle wife,
Why all these phantom fears ?
How have I err?d ? What have I dono
To bring the scalding tears ?
Jessemah.
You ask what you have done Oarloss,
To start the bitter tear,
Your cold neglect and venom?d words
Have fill?d my soul with fear.
Dare you say I love another ?
My God ! how can it be ?
The world to me?s a wilderness,
Oarloss, I live for thee.
Believe me, husband, do believe,
And curb thy fitful heart,
Ere the poison?d dart of jealousy
Shall pang thee with its smart.
Have you so soon forgot the day
You claimed me for your wife ?
Did you not vow a thousand times
You loved me more than life ?
Carlossa.
Enough dear wife, now dry thy tears,
And wear a sunny smile ;
Let love and concord, Jessemah,
Our future days beguile.


Jessemah sings.
Ihou star of my path, shed thy soft light o?er me
And steer my frail bark to the haven of rest ?
� ? s f eet was tlle music that once fill?d my soul
But angmsh has now found a home in my breast.
Mournlu! are the days and gloomy the nights,
No hope of relief for the morrow,
And keen are the darts plunged into my soul
Uer weary I?m bow?d down with sorrow. ?
Iho his faults are countless as sands on the shore,
tlle heart where aff ection should dwell
TmnH the �. torm ra g es m ding to the mast,
HU <j o a in his mercy the savage waves quell.
u ? tJi at my soul may in rapture repose ;
Lord make me resign?d to thy will,
Ihen serenely I?ll glide o?er life?s troubl?d sea
brokenhearted?l love him still.
Carlossa.
Come pledge with me my noble wife,
So long as life shall last,
Ne?er, ne?er to wake, fair Jessemah,
Drear mem?ries of the past.
Carlossa sings.
The Hawthorn tree is blooming love,
0 ! say wilt thou be mine;
Soft summer clouds are looming love,
Say fondly thou?lt be mine,
Whisper?l?ll be tbine.
Whisper, whisper,
Whisper?l?ll be thine.


When life?s autumn leaves are falling,
Loved one wilt thou be mine ;
When aloud chill winter?s calling,
Say softly thou?lt be mine,
Whisper?l?ll be thine.
Whisper, whisper,
Whisper?l?ll be thine.
When old friends upon me frown, love,
0 ! then wilt thou be mine;
When decay shall bow me down, love,
Say fondly thou?lt be mine,
Whisper?l?ll be thine.
Whisper, whisper,
Whisper?l?ll be thine.
Wilt thou be mine for ever, love,
_ 0 ! say wilt thou be mine,
Till death the bond shall sever, love,
Once more say thoul?t be mine,
Whisper?l?ll be thine.
Whisper, whisper.
Whisper?l?ll be thine.
Jessemah.
Well said, Oarloss, your troubled wife
Will strive to do her part;
But 0 ! root out the jealous friend
That lives within our heart.


(Two years after marriage.)
Jessamah.
A mournful thought o?er-crowds my brain,
My tortur?d mind can find no rest,
My soul?s borne down with grief and pain,
And darts of anguish pierce my breast.
I loved him with a fond wife?s pride,
When grim temptation came.
And bore him onward in his tide
Without remorse or shame.
Coldheartedness had ta?en the place
Where affection once did dwell,
While folly with deceptive grace
Had bound him with her spell.
Soft flattery, by ruin?s desire,
Strove hard to gain the prize
For lust; who, with his wanton fire,
Tried virtue by surprise.
Dame Wisdom with her mother hand,
With prudence well behaved,
Preserved him from the ruffian band,
Thank God : Carloss was saved.
Carlossa.
Thou eans?t not boast a spotless breast,
If a lying tongue be virtue?s test;
Too often have I felt the pangs
Of thy envenom?d adder fangs.


?Twas not thy winning smiles that moved
My soul thy love to prize ;
?Twas not thy dainty form I woo?d,
?Twas not thy loveful eyes,
?Twas more than honey?d words I sought
To soothe love?s hitter smart;
?Twas for a heavenly prize I fought?
An ever faithful heart.
Jessamah.
Intemp?rance now has pinn?d him fast,
My God ! Oarloss, this cannot last.
I rather would a beggar be
Than live this hateful life with thee.
Carlossa.
Thou?rt ever ready to unfold
"W hat sages long ago have told,
Before thou maim?st the sinful halt
First find thyself without a fault.
But come, come my fretful little wife,
Once more dry thy tearful eyes,
The big pearly drops remind me of
Stars glittering in the skies.
Carlossa sings.
Thy eyes, thy soul-enrapturing eyes,
Like di?monds set in eth?real skies,
Sparkling and glittering, 0 ! how rare ;
Trifle with those priceless gems who dare ?
Naughty eyes, those wicked eyes.
0 ! such a bewitching prize.


Thy e yes, thy language whispering eyes
E?en the wing?d hoy?s magic dart defies,
Sparkling and glittering, 0 ! how rare,
Trifle with those priceless gems who dare.
Naughty eyes, those wicked eyes,
0 ! such a bewitching prize.
Jessemah.
And dare you think a coward heart,
Can to a wounded soul impart
A j�y-
Carlossa.
Mouth pouting, pouting, pouting,
From morning until night,
Tongue scolding, scolding, scolding,
E?er anxious for the fight.
Jessemah.
Shame, husband ! shame ! your conduct,
Is not that of a man,
Your villain heart Carlossa will
Yet prove to you a ban.
I?ll away this night, Carloss,
List to yon turret bell,
Ringing out in doleful melody,
A long and last farewell.
Carlossa sings.
Farewell to this billow-dash?d shore,
Adieu to the one I adore,


Tho? thy folly and madness
Has fill?d me with sadness.
I?ll think of thee fondly,
Loved one evermore.
Then farewell darling,
Pride of my lone heart,
Since Fate as decree?d,
As friends let us part.
Farewell to the land of thy birth,
The dearest spot to me on earth,
Where Natalia?s wild flowers,
Bedeck Nature?s bowers,
And zephyrs sigh softly
Eequiems of lore.
Then farewell darling,
Pride of my lone heart,
Since Fate has decree?d,
As friends let us part.
Farewell to the valleys and hills,
The lily-lined streamlets and rills,
May thy heart beat with gladness,
While I in my sadness,
Will think of thee fondly,
Loved one evermore.
Then farewell darling,
Pride of my lone heart,
Since Fate has decree?d
As friends let us part.
Farewell to my once happy home,
Deserted I?m destined to roam,
But not until my last breath
Shall be silenced in death


Will I cease to think fondly
Of thee I adore.
Then farewell darling,
Pride of my lone heart,
Since Pate lias decree?d,
As friends let us part.
Four Years after Marriage.
Jessemah laments.
No repose have I found since the gloomisome night,
I saw my ?Daisy?s ? dainty form dressed in snowy white.
And the tiny tuft of hair that overhung its lily brow,
My darling angel-haby, methinks I see it now.
As I clasp?d my lifeless child, and press?d it to my heart,
The how of bitter anguish sent through my soul a dart;
I fondly caress?d its pretty limbs, and kiss?d its pearl-like
brow,
My heaven-gone angel-baby, methinks I see it now.
They took my saintly baby and bore it far away,
And laid it in an icy bed and cover?d it with clay.
O?er its tomb the weeping willow bends its solemn form,
To shield the sacred little spot from the ruthless storm.
Ah, me ! my long-lost baby, hads?t thou been spared to me,
I ne?er should have felt the fiercer throe?s of misery,
But soon my lovely child, soon on a better shore,
We shall meet my angel-baby, ne?er to part no more.


How I long for the day, and how I pray for the night,
AVhen my famish?d spirit shall take its heayenward flight,
My soul is growing weary, soon, soon it will he free,
I?m coming angel-baby to live in bliss with thee.
Carlossa.
Ah ! sadly I remember dear,
The cheerless pitchy night,
I saw the little spotless soul
Wing its heayenward flight.
But let us not complain, poor wife,
?Twas merciful of God,
To cull the pretty budding flower
From tbis corrupted sod.
Jessemdh sings.
My angel baby?s gone to rest,
Sweet slumb?ring on her Saviour?s breast.
0! bow joyful.
Soon will end my earthly sorrow;
Bright will beam the coming morrow,
0 ! how joyful.
Joyful, joyful, 0! how joyful,
What a glorious time ?twill be,
When my captive soul is free.
Soon this poor heart no more will feel,
The braggart?s dirk, and coward?s steel,
0 ! how joyful.
AVhen the angels whispering say ?
Come from this icy world away,
O! how joyful,


Joyful, joyful, 0! how joyful,
What a glorious time ?twill he,
When my Saviour calleth me.
Carlossa
I know poor wife, no tongue can tell,
The pangs that rend a mother?s breast,
When th? darling babe she loves so well
Is call?d to its eternal rest.
Jessemah.
Ah me ! why did I live to see
This woeful bitter day;
Ere the fairest flow?er on earth had bloom?d
It droop?d and pass?d away.
0 God! this grief I cannot bear,
Is there no hand to save ?
Since happiness I am denied,
Send me an early grave.
Carlossa.
On the stormy sea of life, man is toss?d to and fro
Like a ship upon the ocean, when savage winds blow
? Man is born to trouble.?
Jessemah raves and in her excitement falls to
ground a corpse, her last words being?My child-
child?my child.


Jessemah.
Merciful Heaven !
Can it be ? It is ! it is ! my long lost babe,
fepare me! ye devils, one moment spare me ;
-Uaisy . Daisy ! 0 ! heaven sent messenger,
Hast thou come to mock thy mother?s mis?ry.
Hracious God ! gone! Could it have been a dream ?
no, no, it was my own darling child.
e . fiGnds of hell let loose to destroy me,
Drmk ye ! drink ye of my blood; drain my veins
lo the last drop, but 0 ! give me my child,
My child?my child?my child.
Carlossa terrified by the sudden death of Jessemah
exclaims my God! dead! and immediately expires by the
side of his lifeless wife. J


One morn in bleak December,
Sadly I remember,
An old man leaning on a staff
Came tapping at my door;
His look was worn and haggard,
As to the door he stagger?d ;
His faint-like voice it uttered,
Have pity I implore.
What brought you here, aged sire,
I ventured to inquire,
Is it love for early rambling,
Or is it something more ?
My heart it fluttered madly,
As his tale so sadly,
Fill?d my soul with anguish ;
For bread ho did implore.
Tears trickled down his furrow?d cheek,
As tenderly and meek
He spoke of a little girl,
Whom his soul did adore ;
Her young spirit long had fled,
She slumber?d with the dead ;
He stood homeless, a wreck
On life?s too troubled shore.
His clothes were scant and tatter?d
His feeble frame was shatter?d,
And his wrinkl?d face bore traces
Of suffering galore.
While he prayed that the morrow
Might end his earthly sorrow,
From his Father above he
Did forgiveness implore.

Dear little birdie, come sing while I weep,
Sing softly birdie, disturb,not her sleep,
Sing feather?d beauty, 0 ! sing a sweet lay,
Her dear little life is fast ebbing away.
Hush! gentle birdie, cease chanting thy lay,
Angels are bearing her young soul away,
She?s going to dwell with my baby boy,
Where eternally reigns, love, peace, and joy.
Sing pretty birdie, the storm is now o?er,
King Death has silenced the hurricane?s roar,
The dear little flow?ret that bloom?d yesterday,
Has droop?d its fair head and pass?d to decay.

And could I mortal passions rule,

Farewell! Thou lofty monarch,
Prince of the forest glade,
Many are the happy hours
I?ve spent beneath thy shade.


I loved to hear thy branches
Soft singing to the breeze.
And gaze upon thy noble form,
Tow?ring in stately ease.
?Neath thy massive boughs I sat
Deep musing o?er the past,
And praised thy fragrant blossoms,
Gone from my view at last.
Mighty giant of nature,
My pen shall some day tell
The wonders of thy greatness ;
Honoured friend?farewell.

Tell me, is all hope departed,
Has her spirit flown away ?
Has she left me broken-hearted ?
Tell me, mother, do I pray.
Tell me, did the lovely maiden
Pine her gentle soul away ?
Was her heart with grief o?erladen ?
Tell me, mother, do, I pray.
Tell me, mother, softly tell me,
Has the rose gone to decay ?
Is there nought but sorrow left me ?
Tell me, mother, do, I pray.
Mother.
Alas ! my son, brood not o?er sorrow,
Heaven will light your lonesome way;
Presh hope will crown the coming morrow,
Tho? clouds o?erhang your head to day.

The ploughman rises with the lark,
And hastens to his daily toil,
He labours hard from dawn till dark,
To earn his bread and till the soil.
The rose blooms on his ruddy cheek,
No tear of sorrow damps his eye,
He pursues his task, week to week,
Without a murmur or a sigh.
O?er furrowed fields at ev?ning?s close,
The happy ploughman wends his way,
And homeward steers to seek repose,
Prom toilsome duties of the day.
His good housewife and only child
With kind words greet him at the gate.
And love him with hearts undefiled ;
Such is the ploughman?s happy state.
Within his cot dwells peace of mind
Sweet contentment, love, and joy,
His thoughts are of the purest kind.
His greatest pride?s his wife and boy.
The following lines were sent with a ?gift ? to Mrs,
Take this gift?revere it,
And let it a token be,
That you ne?er tread beyond
The bounds of modesty.
If you cannot wear it,
Return the jewel to me,
And time will you reward
For cruel dishonesty.


ftfifll samlg tfci�k of me.
Cruel fate has decreed,
For ever we must part;
My love give back the gem
You stole from my poor heart.
?Tis now late in the day,
And from bonds you are free,
But in all your heavy trials
You?ll surely think of me.
A choice flow?r in my garden grew,
It spread its fragrance all around
My soul; till some inhuman wretch
Laid it waste upon the ground.
My garden now is overgrown
With the bramble and the thorn,
?Tis moisten?d with keen mis?ry?s tears,
All future hope?s forlorn.
The wretch who pluck?d my precious flow?r
May he meet a villain?s fate,
Let his future be the depths of h-11.
The hottest fire his mate.
0 God ! protect the mother plant,
Tho? its roots on earth be cleaven;
Nourish it with thy tender care,
That it may bloom in heaven.


The following stanzas are intended for Mrs. J. 8., a ladg
famed for her caprice
When the cold clammy hand of King Death
Shall grasp and shall bear me away,
To a region unknown to my eyes,
Drop a tear o?er my cold bed of clay.
When I?m gone if your heart should grow warmer
Since ?twere better to kill than to save,
Tho? heeding the voice of a charmer
Pray plant a wild brier o?er my grave.
Addressed to Miss E. 8., whose ? sweet delight is to coin
and utter falsehoods :
Ungenerous face-proud silly maid,
You?re highly skill?d in the lying trade ;
When your ?prenticeship?s expired, I vow,
You?ll not be more skilful then than now.
In ev?ry branch of the dev?lish trade,
Your reputation?s firmly made.
The author respectfully suggests that all who read the four
following lines, on ? Bad Temperwould make a copy, and
post it in a conspicuous place in their homes :?-
Bad temper is an odious thing;
Deny it if you can,
It mars the peace of happy homes
And makes a beast of man.

If fickle man in countless ills
Would consult old ? Common Sense,?
He?d secure the best physician
At little or no expense.
Whether sought for a preventive
Or consulted as to cure,
His remedies are genuine,
Their healing powers are sure.
Frail humankind is nothing more
Than dust upon the 'ground,
A puff of wind will blow away
Man, no more to he found.
When King Death shall summon us,
We must obey his call;
For as by sin man was raised,
So by sin he must fall.
?Tis wisdom in this troubl?d life
To do all we can ;
To serve 0-od with righteousness,
And not injure man.

Forward brothers ; cross the river,
Why its raging torrent fear ;
If we would our souls deliver
Brothers we must persevere,
Brothers strive, let nothing daunt
Till we reach the wished for shore,
Sin, our deadly foe, pursues us,
Threat?ning hard to whelm us o?er.
Brothers, Jesus will receive us,
On the glorious sands of i mo,
Through the valley lie will lead n<?
To a rich and beaut?ous clime.
Forward brothers ; cross the river,
Why its turbid waters fear ;
If wo would our souls deliver,
Brothers, come let?s persevere.

Thou demon in an insect?s form,
Worse than famine, plague, or storm,
Why darest thou on me intrude
And banquet nightly on my blood ?
Thou vilest insect in creation ;
Worse than the lice which caused vexation
To the old Egyptian nation.
Thee could I but catch,
Thoud?st find thy match.
Could I but catch thee in thy rambles,
This bed should be to thee thy shambles,
And soon would cease thy bloody gambols ;
But all my efforts thou deftest,
And on my flesh thou snugly liest.
But still, poor insect, why should man
Pronounce on thee so dire a ban
Since blood he sucks much as he can ?
Not only from his open foes,
But yet from friends if they oppose,
Nor pauses in his mad career
Till he has made for each a bier.


On the evening of the 31st December, 1877, I, with two friends,
agreed not to retire to rest till after the birth of the new year. It
was also understood that we should honour the event with a ? feu de
joie;? but, alas 1 friendly agreemants, like national treaties, are
made to be broken, for, about 10 p.m., a third friend dropped in,
bringing with him a ? big treat,? to wit, one dozen of real good beer ;
and, as was natural on so auspicious an occasion, we uncorked and
drank till a sense of drowsiness stole o?er our sensitive feelings,
causing us to seek our beds, forgetting the ? fair promises ? we had
made till the following day, about 11 a.m., when I remembered, and
felt somewhat annoyed at Bacchus for his audacity, and consoled my
wounded feelings by offering the following apology to the newly-born
year :
Pardon, eighteen seventy-eight,
My compliments, tho? rather late,
Are none the less sincere;
Old Bacchus with majestic pomp
Would have me join in merry romp
With right good bottled beer ;
Therefore I pray thee be not hard
Upon thy evil-doing bard.
Prosper?ty be the tok?n;
Then throughout thy twelvemonths? reign
Nought will I do that is profane.
?Tis my tongue that?s spoken.

A FAITHFUL PICTURE, DRAWS FROM LIFE.
T\vas wJi.-u the .Summer?s bloom had filled
The mind with pleasing calms,
Aiid sammer winds were whisp?r?ing low
Their everlasting psalms ;
And sweet perfumes from tender blooms
bent, up their fragrant balms.
And children?s voices could be heard
binging in merry throngs,
As though the mirth of all the earth
Was centred in their songs.
And every tongue spoke out a joy,
And none for human wrongs.


When upwards thro? the street there came
A man whose very mien
Bore all the signs that he had shunned
The road to virtue?s sheen ;
Whose form and look at once partook
Of that that was unclean.
He had that wild and haggard look,
As though he was accursed ;
That subtle craving after drink,
That morbid devilish thirst,
That aim of soul to drain the howl,
Which virtue never nursed.
That pale, unsteady, wretched gaze
Of one who was unfed,
As though his soul was haunted still
By some great nameless dread.
The look of all within the thrall,
Of that which is not bread.
There was a tremor in his gait,
A movement never still,
A fear of some impending shock,
That drink would never kill;
A certain sign of want of force,
And feebleness of will.
The very children as they passed
Ban by, like startled rooks,
Then parted into little throngs,
And clung unto their books.


As though, each mind, to fear inclined,
Was haunted by his looks.
And as he passed from out the crowd,
And left the city hum,
He begged a shilling ?just to buy
Him food ?he needed some.
Then went into the next canteen,
And spent it all in Hum.
And so he drank, from day to day,
Though ruin followed fast,
While not one thought of future joy
Was o?er his spirit cast
But just one link on ruin?s brink,
To bind him to the past.
And that was of an early love,
One sad sweet epitome,
Of one fair scene in beauty?s sheen
Set in a village home.
Like some bright star serenely set
above a princely dome.
Now through the morning?s gentle breeze
There came a solemn knell,
Of shattered hopes and buried joys,
His spirit could not quell;
When from her side ho parted wide,
And said his last farewell!
He heard the Sabbath bells ring out,
With most melodious sound,


As if in all their silver peals
All other tones wore bound.
As though the fair surrounding air
With melody was crowned.
He saw the crowd go into church,
He saw them all disperse,
With all their smiles of happiness,
That made his vice look worse.
And with its stain he walked like Cain,,
And seemed to hear the curse.
He heard the women?s voices ring
In trebles from the choir,
And all their hymns with fervor glowed,
And tremulous desire ;
They seemed to roll all through his soul,.
In tones of living fire.
It made him think of long ago,
When love brought sweet reward
When as a boy he smiled with joy,
When bounding o?er the sward,
And sung within the village church,
In praises to the Lord.
But now what was he ?shunned by all,
A thing ; and not a name ;
A living emblem of the ills
That drunkenness can frame ;
A wretched brute who boro no fruit,
But only weeds of shame.


And as the music rose and fell,
Its sweet tones did unlock
The rusty flood-gates of his soul,
As light reveals the rook,
Each tender strain ran through his brain
Like some galvanic shock.
And like a flash from star to star,
His life leap?d up to view
Ihe virtues that lie might have known,
The vices that he knew ;
From busy schemes and idle dreams,
Leap?d out the false and true.
Just then a shadow wrapt his brain,
A shadow weird and grim,
That rose from all the vicious ways
In which he seemed to swim,
That bid farewell to every spell
Of happiness to him.
There clear before him lay the life
That he had so caress?d,
The drunken and ignoble ways
Of all his sad unrest?
Oh God ; he gasp?d, had I but clasp?d
One virtue to my, breast.
I might have been like other men,
Who pass me night and morn,
And not a ragged drunken sot,
A wretched thing of scorn,
I wonder why I did not die
The dav that I was born.


And so each mind of morbid tone
Dwells not on beauty?s g'low,
But on the gloom where shadows loom,
And miseries ebb and flow,
As though each nerve had started out
And pointed to a woe.
And so he thought of stranded ships
And all the wreck of life,
And yet he lived who caused the wreck
Of name and hopes, and wife,
It seemed to dart through brain and heart,
And pierce him like a knife.
His wife sleeps low within the tomb?
His children ! where are they ?
One little girl whose sweet caress
Still haunts him night and day,
Whose sweet face gleams through all his dreams.
With resplendent ray.
She met him once with looks of doubt
And anguish on her brow ;
Was that her father meanly clad,
To whom she used to bow,
She turned with dread and swiftly fled,
She did not know him now.
Again his craving drives him back
To where the drunkards tread,
And begs a glass, he is so faint
And dizzy in his head,
And drinks the rum to drive him dumb.
Without an ounce of bread.


And now lie haunts the canteen bar
In mean and ragged suit,
And mixes with the drunken scum,
The low and dissolute,
Por virtue?s foe clings to the low,
As brute clings unto brute.
And there he sat with haggard face,
And dim and vacant stare ;
And spell?d within his morbid mind
The words so framed with care,
That shone from flask and painted cask,
And many a bottle there.
And in the spelling of the ? Rum,?
The ? red ? to him recurred,
And so he spelt them backwards both,
And Murder was the word ;
Then with a sudden fear and dread
His very soul was stirred.
?Twas then he thought of horrid deeds,
How men but seldom pause,
When mad with drink they leap th? brink
Of Providential laws;
And mix up in some savage deed,
With red Rum as the cause.
And what was this ? self-murder too,
How long could he now last ;
Drinking like rain?that which has slain


Its millions in the past;
Delirium now was near his brow,
To bind its fibres fast.
Just then he laid him down and dreamt
Those dreams which are the worst,
The phantoms of a flagging brain
Which drinking long had nursed,
Those fevered links which haunt the sinks
That rum has so accursed.
He dreamt of wrecks upon a sea,
Where he was all afloat,
A sea of Hum and phantom ships
Yet not a sail or boat,
On every side an ocean wide,
And one parched human throat.
And horrid snakes coiled round his limbs
The black, the green, the brown,
They fastened round his neck and face,
And tried to drag him down ;
The power to swim forsook each limb,
And yet he could not drown.
The phantom ships drove near him fast,
With crowds for ever dumb,
With gloomy flags that bore the words :
? Behold the drunkard?s come.
?We are the dead, the drunken dead,
? That sold our souls for ? Rum. ? ?


And though an ocean spread around,
A seal was on his lips ;
Oh, how he longed hut just to taste
His usual drunken' sips,?
While all the snakes did hiss and bite,
And scourge him worse than whips.
Just then there came a blinding flash,.
The sea was all in flame ;
And every burning billow burst
And scorched him as it came,
And then he cursed the raging? thirst
That paralysed his frame.
And then the ocean faded out,
But yet the flame was there,
And millions scorched and writhed
In its strong and sulphurous glare,.
A fetid smell that spoke of hell,
But not a breath of air.
And far above where angels stood,
He saw his little girl,
Whose tender eyes with sweet surprise
Shone lustrous as a pearl;
And then he woke with sudden start,
His brain all in a whirl.
And so he rose and staggered forth,
And babbled filthy lore ;
A frenzied broken human soul


That no one could adore.
A shattered harp that would not give
A melody no more.
And so they found him pale and wan,
And prematurely grey,
With all the signs and furrowed lines
That tell of quick decay ;
A worn out and battered wreck
That drink had cast away.
So one fair and beauteous morn,
When spring had bloomed again,
The drunkard?helpless as a child,
Yet free from ache or pain
Was carried to a gloomy cell
With fetters on his brain.
And there he stalks from day to day,
Dressed in a pauper?s suit,
The parent eye might him decry,
Would scarcely know the fruit,
So low as he sunk down and formed
A level with the brute.
Yes, there he dwells, a warning sign
To all of those who nurse
That fatal bowl that drugs the soul
And bids its joys disperse.
A certain and unerring mark
Of drink?s perpetual curse.


Oh, that this -warning could engrave
Some new and golden rule,
To write its chart upon each heart,
In life?s too busy school;
Ere there shall surge o?er ruin?s verge,
The tempter and his tool.
Then let your firm resolves stand firm,
To shun the Hum?s abuse,
And not with moderation play
The reins both fast and loose,
And shun the sips that scorch the lips
Ere you perish in the use.


Jmmtam at fealty
?Old as the everlasting hills
And richer than their wealth,
Is that pure stream which gently fills
The fountain of our health ;
True as the shadow to the sun
It points to sunny goals,
Whose treasures may be grasp?d and won
By firm and temperate souls.
The fount that thousands seek in vain,
That hope so oft embowers,
That drops as sweetly as the rain
Does on summer flowers.
That fountain is not far to seek,
?Tis traced on Wisdom?s chart,
It blooms upon a maiden?s cheek,
And leaps from heart to heart.
It has a beauty of its own.
A mirth that never dies,
When all its springs are kept in tone
By temperate supplies.
It has the melody of song
Whose music never jars,
But floats above all human wrong,
And mingles with the stars.


We wish for riches, and would keep
A guard upon our wealth,
Forgetting that we cannot reap
Without the grasp of health ;
Until Intemperance firmly pinned
Has blurred us with its stain,
We find that we have sown the wind.
To reap the hurricane.
See pampered John, beguiled by use,
Feeds highly, day by day;
And drinks the strong fermented juice.
Of that which brings decay.
And just as he begins to scout
His heritage of woe,
John dies some day, and leaves his gout
A legacy to Joe.
Poor Bill is drunk, James is sick,
And Jane begins to bawl,
And troubles seem to loom as fast
As shadows on the wall.
Go ! trace it to intemperate hurt,
A mild ancestral treat,
As sure a thing in life?s desert,
As pudding after meat.
The husband, happy with his wife,
Must own the fountain?s truth,
For he is cheerful all his life,
And she wears well her youth ;
While all her children bloom around


Their mother and their sire,
And share with them the healthy round,
And temperate desire.
So Truth and Love must be combined,
And have a temperate aim,
Then shall we have a healthy mind
Linked to a healthy frame.
Our children?s voices then will bless
The homes that gave them birth,
And mingle with each fond caress
Their melodies of mirth.
Oh! may this crystal fountain tide
Be used by all the world,
Its portals will be always wide,
Its banner never furled.
Go, seek it in the ? Templar ? cause
And learn to shun the bowl
Which so infringes Nature?s laws,
And sears the human soul.
Then pledge with me this noble theme,
And may its pleasures bless
The thousands who float down th? stream
Of misery and distress ;
And may the ?Templars ? be a guide
To those who seek for health,
And live to be their country?s pride,
A nation?s truest wealth.

?Twas when Winter?s winds were howling,.
With mournful deaf ning sound ;
And Jack frost had spread his carpet .
Upon the frozen ground,
That a Pedlar went forth to tramp
A dreary round.
With pack on bac4; and limping tread,
Despising fortune?s frown";
Greeting the dawn with cheerful song,
He left the sleeping town,
Hoping to earn a golden coin
Before sundown.
The Pedlar had not travelled far,
When,from'the blinding sleet;
At a Parson?s house hard by he sought,
And found a safe retreat, *
Where he could rest awhile, and ease his
Chilblainetbfeet.
Like other religions strategists,
Learned Parson McCann,
By his simple flock was held to be
A faultless Christian man ;
Orthodox as is the Pope to his
Devoted clan.


The Pedlar had no soonerr reached
The Prelate?s mansion door,
Than his thundering rat-fa tat-tat
Echoed from roof to floor,
For the pangs of cold wejre gnawing hard,
At his heart's core.
? Mine Gott! mine Gott!?? the traveller cried.
? Help ! help ! or I shall die
For no longer could the hapless Jew,
The elements defy.
But sank to the ground exhausted, with
A moaning cry.
The Parson quickly discovered
The Jew?s unhappy state ;
And soothed the ? lowly stranger ? with
A grand discourse on fate,
Enlarging on the follies of those
Of low estate.
The Pedlar soon regain?d consciousness,
To the Parson?s surprise,
Who thought the ill-starred sinner?s soul
Was winging to the skies ;
But the One on whom all things depend
? Will?d otherwise.?
Now the Parson looked bewildered,
And scarce knew what to do ;
When the ? lowly stranger ? proved to be
A ? heathen pedlar Jew.?
Who wished to sell ? at less than cost ?
? A vatch or two.?


? Yould you like to buy a vatch, Sir ??
Tlie eager Pedlar cried ;
? I have von here I?ll varrant vill
Keep time vith any tide ;
I bought it from a nobleman
Yho met a gambler?s fate,
And thro? backing losing horses
He now lives on the State.?
Vill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy
Like an earnest Christian hero
Little Parson McCann
Buckl?d on the sword of Truth, and
Attack?d the heathen man.
Parson.
Have you never heard of Jesus,
The great, the good, the brave,
Who fought and bled on Calvary,
Poor wretched souls to save ;
And gave His holy body to
Be nailed to a tree,
That with His precious blood He might
Set captive sinner free.
Pedlar.
Avast, my friend, I left my home,
This cold and cheerless day,
To try to sell my jewellery,
And not to hear you pray.
Your intentions may be good, as


The love of God is pure ;
But advice vithdut medicine
Yill hardly vork a cure.
Vill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy ?
Parson.
May God, whose mighty power
Proclaims His name supreme,
Arouse thee, sleeping sinner,
Prom thy deluding dream ;
And may He in His mercy
Put forth His saving hand,
Preserve thee from Satan and
His cruel bloody band.
Pedlar.
Vith aU my heart I thank you sir,
Por all your kind vishes ;
But vhy offer a hungry man
Nought but empty dishes ?
Pray buy this splendid lever vatch;
Vith this artistic guard;
You may be sure such a vise act
Vould bring its own revard
ViU you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy ?
Parson.
May God root out the cankerous weed
Sin planted in thy breast,
That thy soul may yield in righteousness


The fruit he loveth best.
Jesus is the sinner?s only shield.
In Him put all thy trust;
For thro? faith a righteous soul shall live
When man is gone to dust.
Pedlar.
Tray say vhere is the poor man?s friend,
There is he to be found
Yho vould help a vay-vorn brother
If he saw von aground ;
And tell me if the man you preach,
Yhilst living on this sod,
Yorked for big money vages
Or for the love of God ?
Yill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy ?
Parson.
Jesus is the poor man?s friend,
In Him mercy will be found;
He will help the wanderer,
If in sin he gets aground.
Tarry not another moment,
Seek at once the Sinner?s Friend ;
He will receive thee kindly,
And to all thy wants attend.
Pedlar.
If a vorthy low-born brother,
Is cast by Fate?s cold frown


Into a sea of misery,
He?s cruelly left to drown ;
But should a high-born wicious rake
Thro? folly tumble down,
To prop him up a yearly sum
Is granted by the Crown.
Till you buy, Mr. Parson, yill you buy ?
Adown the Parson?s face
Big drops of sweat did flow,
As he stagger?d ?neath the
Weight of the Jew?s last blow.
Parsom.
Jesus is waiting at the riiver
To see thee safely o?er ;
Go, sinner, where thy famish?d soul
Shall never thirst no imore.
He?ll take thee to His Pmther?s house
And tend thee day by day,
And feed thee with the Bread of Life,
And cast thy grief away.
Pedlar.
My good friend, you?d gather more
Stray sheep to the fold
If man?s breathing depended
On other than gold ;
Bare necessity creates
Countless sinful hearts},


For vhat saint could endure cold
Poverty?s keen darts ?
Yill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy ?
Parson
Poor sinner, tlio? poverty
To crime may be akin,
And tho? destitution oft
Hath tempted man to sin ;
According as man soweth,
He assuredly shall reap,
For while the righteous rejoice
The ungodly shall weep !
Go to Jesus, poor sinner,
Go to Him while ?tis day;
Go, ere eternal darkness
Shall bar the peaceful way.
Pedlar.
There?s not a day goes o?er our heads
But countless helpless poor,
Thro? cruel neglect and hunger,
Are gasping at death?s door ?
Yhy don?t you tell me how it is,
For I can?t understand,
Yhy so many thousands die of thirst
In this vell-vater?d land '?
Vill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy?
Parson.
May thy conscience reprove thee
With Remorse?s chast?ning rod,


That thy sin-burdened soul may
Be safely brought to Q-od.
How insignificant the world
Compared to one lost soul!
0, pray seek the Great Physician,
And let him make thee whole.
Pedlar.
Be not o?er proud to take a hint from
Yon vho appears a fool,
For a Simple Simon oft has gained
A prize at Yisdom?s sehiool.
Yhen you find a needy fellow-vorm
Crush?d by misfortune?s curse,
Unbutton a sympathising heart,
And open vide your purse.
Yill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy
Parson.
Poor infidel, I?m much afraid
A mine of sin is in thee laid ;
Satan, with his infernal band,
Awaits thy wreck on Mis?ry?s strand,
Faith with works alone can save
Thee from damnation?s fiery grave.
Pedlar.
?Tis time I had done some business,
Not sold a thing all day ;


And vasting precious time like this
I?m sure vill never pay.
Come buy this antiquated cup,
By Hiram it vas made,
And carried from Jerusalem
Time of Richard?s crusade.
Vill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy ?
Parson.
I will not buy thy much-prized ware,
Nor in thy curs?d unbelief take share ;
The gold and silver thou lovest so well
Cannot save thy sinful soul from hell.
When thy Master calls thee, thou must go.
And leave all thy idols here below ;
Go seek, poor soul, for heavenly treasure,
Seek the Giver of eternal pleasure.
Pedlar.
?Pon my undoubted vord of honor,
You Parsons seem to think
All who ventures near a precipice
Must tumble o?er the brink.
The best-made lamp ne?er gave a light
Yithout it had the oil,
And vater if it hasn?t the heat
I?m sure vill never boil.
Till you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy ?


Parson.
Harden?d unbeliever,
Take thy woe to the Lord,
He is no deceiver :
Build thou upon His Word,
He will ne?er forsake thee,
But take thee for His breast;
Sinner, I implore thee,
Go seek eternal rest.
Tho? the earnest little Pacrson
Returned blow for blow,
He was no match for the* Pedlar,
As the sequel will show.
Pedlar..
In the name of patience von?t you buy
This rare Diamond ring,
Long an idol of the Chinese Prince,
Ching-a-Ang, Ching-a-Sing ;
That gem sparkled in a Royal crown,
Two thousand years or more,
And is equally as lustrous as
The famous ?Koh-I-Noor.?
Yill you buy, Mr. Parson, vill you buy
Parson.
Benighted child of Israel,
Thou art as one that?s dead ;


Thy case looks doubtful?o, my soul.
All hope of cure seems fled.
Eeturn sin-loving wanderer ;
Why would?st thou farther go
Along the road that leads to death
And everlasting woe ?
Pedlar.
The sun has run his daily round,
And darkness clos?d the day ;
From my lov?d vife and little vones
I can no longer stay.
May God vatch o?er you alvays vith
A tender father?s care,
That tlie devil by his cunning
Mayn?t catch you in his snare.
Good-bye, Mr. Parson, good-bye.
Parson.
May the grace of God be with thee
Where?er thou may?st go ;
May plenty be thy coldest friend
And peace thy hottest foe.
And when thy pilgrimage is o?er
God grant that thou may?st be
A faithful servant of the Lord?s
To all eternity.
