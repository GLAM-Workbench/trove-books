Ralph Harrison (1748-1810) was a minister at Cross
Street, Manchester, when this work was published. Later
(1786) 'he taught classics and belles lettres at Manchester
Academy. His grammar quickly became popular, and was
printed at Philadelphia in 1787, under the title Rudiments
of English Grammar. Other American editions appeared at
Wilmington (1788?), Philadelphia, (1792, 1795, 1798 bis,
1800, 1801, 1802, 1804, 1809, 1812), Whitehall (1801),
Petersburg (1801), and Baltimore (1806). English editions
appeared at London in 1784, 1788, 1790, 1792,1794, 1801,
and 1805. Copies of all editions are rare, this first edition
surviving in only three copies. For a contemporary review

THE
PREFACE.
ZHE defign of this little traS is to compriu
the rudiments of Englifh Grammar, in a
plain, concife, and regular form, failed to
the fcholajlic method of inflrußion. For this
purpofe, / have judged it of importance to avoid
hard technical words, and long fen fences, as unfit
for the capacities of children. The minuter ob-
fervations are thrown into the form of notes; and
the inflections of Nouns, Verbs, See. in/lead of
being prcuioujly drfcribed by words, are chiefly
delineated in their examples. I have endeavoured
to render the definitions philofophical, as well as
plain, and to conform fir icily to the fimplicity of
the Englifli Language, retaining however, for
oln ious rcafons, as many of the common terms of
grammar, as were admijfible into my Plan.
a a The


PREFACE.
The catechetical form of in/lruHion, though
accompanied with fome advantages, is ufually
attended with this inconvenience, that the young
fcholar commits the anfwers to memory, without
being at the trouble of under/landing the quef-
tions, whereby the Jenfe is left imperfeH. I
would rather recommend this method to be ufed
at the difcretion of the majler, by way of exami-
nation, when it may be ufeful to depart from the
written form. Trijling as thefe arrangements
may appear, they are neverthelefs to be confidered
of importance, if they produce any praHical ad-
vantage to children, and their inflruHors.
Little originality is to be expccled in a work
of this nature. In what relates to Pronouns,
however, I have chofen to depart from the com-
mon plan, having noticed under this clajs, thofc
onlr that herve the nature of Subflantnes. The
vfital dijlrihution of them into pofleflive, rela-
tive, demon fixative, and diflributivc, feems
unneceffary at leajl, if not without foundation.
Mv, thv, our, and the like, are with more pro-
priety termed Adjc Hives derived from Pronouns.
The words this, that, each, the fame, be. arc
rather to be called AdjeHives, whofe Subflantives
are frequently underflcod. They are no more en-
titled to the appellation of Pronouns, than the
£ood, the wife, Adji Hives of Number, and
many

many others which it would he thought ahjurd to
rank under this clajs.
If an apology he required for adding to the
numerous publications on this fubjeS, it is the
following—-That our bejl Grammarians have con-
feffedly written to perfons of maturity and re-
flection, without any view to the early part of
education—That others have engaged in the pre-
fent plan with very confiderable merit, but often
with fome material defeft, which the judicious
fchoolmajler would wifh to have fupplicd. Faults
of this nature are a general want of accuracy t
an inattention to the fimplicity of our own lan-
guage, and parlitularly an imperfect Syntax; as
alfo the adopting 100 many of the terms and di-
vipor.s of the Latin grammar. Tkefe the author
of the following treatife hath endeavoured to
avoid, and to unite perfpicuity of exprefjion with
a eomprehenpve brevity: How far he hath fuc-
cerdrd in the attempt, it is not for him to deter-
mine.

ENGLISH GRAMMAR, 6c.
PART L
Of the different Kinds and Changes *>f
WORDS.
WORDS may be conveniently arranged
under the following ClaHcs; NOUN,
PRONOUN, ADJECTIVE, VEKB, PARTICIPLE,
ARTICLE, ADVERB, CONJUNCTION, PREPOSI-
TION, and INTERJECTION.
Of NOUNS.
A NOUN or SUBSTANTIVE, is the name of
whatever we diflin&ly perceive, under-
Hand,


(land, or difcourfe of;+ as a man, a tree,
goodnejs, truth.
Nouns may be divided into COMMON and
PROPER.
A Noun common belongs to a whole kind;
as, a man, a city, a river.
A Noun proper is the name of an indivi-
dual of a kind, as, Julius Ca/ar, London,
the Danube.
The terminations or endings of Nouns are
changed on account of NUMBER, CASE, and
GENDER.
Of NUMBER
THERE are two NUMBERS, the SIN-
GULAR, and the PLURAL.!
The
T DIRECTION. If therefore we prefix the words,
•* 1 fpeak of'-——whatever word com pi eats the fenfc
is a Noun; as I fpeak of— virtue, toi/dom, gold. The
young fcholar may be ufefully cxercifed in thus re-
citing a number of fubftantives.
J Some words want the Angular number; as ajhes,
lungs, &c. Some have no plural; as, the names of
VIRTUES and VICES, jujlice, temperance, &c. of
METALS; as, brafs,gold, See. and all PROPER NAMES.
In others the Angular and plural terminations are
alike; as, Jheep, deer. Some words taken from fo-
reign languages, retain their original plurals; as cherub,
cberubim\ ferapb, feraphimi erratum, errata; pheno-
menon, phenomena ; radius, radii; beau, beaux, &C.


The fingular Number fpeaketh but of one;
as, a Jong.
The plural number exprefleth mote than
one; as Jongs.
The plural number is generally formed,
by adding s, or es, t to the lingular; as river,
rivers ; Jfh, JiJhes.J
But many plurals are formed irregularly;
as, man, men; foot, feet.||
If the lingular end in j, preceded by a
confonant, the plural fhall end in res; as,
beauty, beauties.
Of CASE
THERE are two CASES, the NOMINA-
TIVE, and the POSSESSIVE.
The Nominative cafe is the name itCelf; as,
George.
The PoJfeJfwe denotes Property, or Poflcf-
Con; as, George's book.
B Of
f Es is added, where / could not othcrwile he
founded, viz. after cb, s, Jb, x, and x/ as, /wrl,
torches; m\, meet.
X Many words ending in f, make their plural in
vet i at, calf, calves t knife, knives t hot others fol-
low the general rule; as, grief, griefst cliff, cliffs.
H To which may be added, women, moment MM,
children s hretber, brethren; ex, oxen; as alio, die,
dice\ lonfe, lice i snonfe, mice; gtfe,geefe | Jew, /mine;
t**ny, fence; teeth, teeth.


The Pofleffive is formed by adding i, with
an apoftrophe before it, the
But to a Plural ending in J u «r a Singular
in Jf, the apoftrophe only is added; as, the
Jcldicrs valour; for righteoujttefs lake.
Xotc. The poflcflive Plural is fcldom ufed.
Of GE.NDER,
NOUNS have properly two GENDERS;
the MASCULINE, to denote the male
kind ; and the FEMININE, to denote the female.J
When there is no diftin&ion of fcx, a
Noun is faid to be of the NEUTER Gender.
The feminine Gender is fometimes exprefled
by
f When ffveral names are coopled together in the
Poflrffivc Cafe, the apoftrophe with / may be joined
to the laft of them, and underftood to the reft; as,
John, James, and Robert 's Horfe.
If the term denoting property or pofleffion confift
of feveral words, the apoftrophe is ufually fnbjoined
to the laft of them; as, tie king of Great-Britain *
army.
J When perfontfied, the following words are con-
fidered as Mafculine; /an, time, death, Jleef, love,
the feafont.
Virtue, vice , with their fpcctes; the earth, the
moen, the church, religion, nature, fortune, Jhip, veffel,
gun, the names of countries and cities are feminine.

lionejs ; but generally without regard to rule.*

Of PRONOUNS.
A PRONOUN is a word ufcd inftead of a
Noun; as, I, for my name; he, for his
name.
Pronouns, like unto Nouns, are infle&ed
wfth NUMBER and CASE.
Some Pronouns have a Cafe peculiar to
thcmfclves, which is called the objective , and
follows Verbs and Prcpohtions.

CHAP. 111.
Of ADJECTIVES.
AN ADJECTIVE cxprcffeth fome quality or
property of a Noun, to which it re-
quires to be united; as, gnat, wife, good.
Adjc&ives change their termination only on
account of COMPARISON.
Except this plural thefe ; and that pi. thofe.
There are three Degrees of comparifon;
the POSITIVE, the COMPARATIVE, and the
SUPERLATIVE.
DIRECTION An Adjective will admit the word
thing after it; as, a good thin%. Moft Adje&ives alio
may be compared; as, fair, fairer, fairefi.
It will greatly aflill the young fcholar, if he be re-
quired to find Adjedives to a given Subftanthre; as for
example, to the word COLD; yellow gold, freeioue
gold, fine golJ. On the other hand, he may find Sub-
liantives to a given Adjedive; as for example, to the
word HIGH; high tree, high mountain, high tower,
&c. Afterwards let him compare the Adjedives, and
ir.fied the Subftantives, by which he will learn to dif-
tinguifh their grammatical properties.
The


The Pofitive exprefleth the fimpie quality;
is, hard.
The Comparative fomewhat incrcafeth the
(ignification of the Pofitive ; as harder.
The Superlative exprefleth the quality in
the higheft degree; as f kardejl.
Example of the comparifon of Adjc&ives.
Pofitive. Comparative. Superlative.
Hard harder! hardest
Wife wifcr wife/2
The following Adjedives are compared ir-
regularly, viz.
PoJ. Comp. Superl,
Good, better, bell.
Bad, worfe.J word.
Little, lcfs+ lead.
Much, mote, mod.
Near, nearer, nearell and next.
Late, later, lated and lad.
Adje&ives whofe Signification cannot be
encrcafed, do not admit of comparifon; as,
oil, every, fee.

ENGLISH GRAMMAR,
Many Adjefiives, and efpecially thole that
confift of feveral Syllables, are compared by'
the help of Particles; as, extraordinary, more
extraordinary, mojl extraordinary.
Some Adjc&ives are derived from Pronouns;
as, my, thy, our, your , Bcc. others frequently
have their Subflantives underflood; as, each,
either , &c. alfo which, what, whether, that and
//IF /AME, are called RELATIVES.
When which, what, and whether are ufed to
afk queflions, they are called INTERROCATIVES.

CHAP. IV.
Of VERBS and PARTICIPLES.
A VERB affirmeth fomcwhat of a Noun;
and betokcncth to do, to be, or to be in
fome Jlatc; as, die bird jlies ; John is diligent;
Peter peps.
The Noun concerning which it affirms, is
called the SUBJECT! of the Verb.
There arc two kinds of Verbs, TRANSITIVE,
and INTRANSITIVE.
A Verb is called Tranfitive , when its mean-
ing pafles from the fubjeft to an OBJECT,* or
following Noun ; as Hannibal defeated the
Romans.
DIRECTION. Whatever word makes a complete
fentence with a Noun, is a Vsrb. It may alfo be
diilinguiihed by admitting the perfooal Pronouns before
it: as, / love, thon loveft , See. It is called a VERB
or WORD, at being the chief word in every fcntence.
f The i'ubject ot the Verb is the word that anfwer-
eth to the queltion Who or What before the Verb ; as.
The bird fiiet. What diet? A of. The bird.
$ The object anfwers to the queftion Whom or What
after the Verb; as, Hannibal defeated rxbznt Anf.
the Romans.
A Verb


A Verb is called intranjitive, or neuter, when
its meaning doth not require an objed or fol-
lowing Noun; as, they laugh; we rejoice.
A Verb is infleOed with NUMBER, PERSON,
TIME, and MODE.
Of NUMBER and PERSON.
THERE are TWO NUMBEBS, the Singular,
and the Plural ; and THREE PERSONS in
each Number.
A Verb is of the JirJl perfon, when preceded
by lor We ; of the Jccond per Jon, when pre-
ceded by thou or ye ; when any other Noun
or Pronoun becomes the fubje& of the Verb,
it is of the third perfon.
So alfo with refpeft to Verbs, I and we are
of the JirJl perfon; thou and ye of the Jccond;
and every other Noun and Pronoun, of the
third perfon.
EXCEPTION. When a Sub flan live is fpoken
to, it becomes of the fecond perfon.
Of TENSES or TIMES.
THERE are two TENSES or TIMES; the
prejent, and the preterite or pojl.
C 2


Of MODES.
A VERB htth rout MODES ; the indicative,
the imperative , the fubjunßive, and the
infinitive.
The indicative Mode declareth fomewhat;
as, thou lovejl; or afketh a queflion; as,
lovfjl thou ?
The imperative biddeth or commandcth;
as, love thou.
The fubjunßive is ufed to exprefs doubt, or
uncertainty! after the words although, if,
whomfoever, unlcfs,s Bcc. as, unlefs he love.
The infinitive Mode, being the Verb itfelf,
without reference to Number or Perfon, hath
commonly the fign to before it, and in figni-
fication is like unto a Noun; -as, boys love
to play; i. e. boys love plaj.
Of PARTICIPLES.
A PARTICIPLE is an Adjeflive, derived from
a Verb, and retaining its fignification.
A Verb hath TWO PARTICIPLES ; one of
the prefent, and another of the preterite Tenfe.
Inflexion
t For if no uncertainty be implied after the words
although, if, &c. the Verb retains the indicative Mode.

CHAP. V.
Of ARTICLES, ADVERBS, CONJUNCTIONS, PRE-
POSITIONS, and INTERJECTIONS.
Of ARTICLES
ARTICLES arc the words a and the, ufed
before Nouns.
A relates to one of a kind, but not one in
particular; as, Have you fecn a fhip?
Hence it is called the indejinile Article.
The fignifies that a particular perfon or
thing is reterrcd to; as, Did you fee the Ship?
Kcntc it is called the drjinite Article.
„\e/r. A becomes an when followed bv a
Vowel, or h not founded.
Of ADVERBS.
ADVERBS are contra&ions of Sentences,
or parts of a Sentence, generally fer-
Note. Adverbs are commonly diftributed into many
kinds, which it would be tedious to enumerate The
principal
ving


ving to denote fome circumfiance or manner
of an a&ion.
They are frequently added to Verbs and
Adjectives ; as, he reads well; be is very di-
ligent.
Many Adverbs end in ly; as, wifely, hap-
pily.
Some Adverbs are compared; as, often,
oftener, e/Unrfl.
Of CONJUNCTIONS.
\ CONJUNCTION joincth Sentences together;
JLJL as, Peter, John, and± James jrun.
Of
principal divisions are thofe of times **. none, often,
Jometimei, to-day, then, ever, never. &c. Of places
as, ivbcre, here, bet.ee, thence, tkither, See. Of num-
ber ; as, or.ee, ttuice, thrice, See. Of affirming and de-
nying ; as, jet, no, truly, not. See. and of quality,
which are Tery numerous, and ufoally end in as,
mercifully, jufily.
t Which may be refolded into three fentences, viz.
Peter runt. John runt. James tunt.
Note. The principal Corjjr.Sioos are, and, albeit,
aifo, although, bccauj.both, but. either, except, for,
if, indeed, neither, neverthefe/t, nor, nefwi/bjtanding,
or, feeing, Jincc, fo, that, therefore, though, <atherefore,
whether.


Of Conjunctions fame are copulative, and
fome are disjunctive.
A Conjunction copulative continues the
fame fenfc; as, and, aljo.
A dijjunflivc cxprefles an oppofition of
meaning; as, but, although, unlefs.
Of PREPOSITIONS.
A PROPOSITION is ufed to fhew the rela-
tion of words to each other; as. He
went jrom Mancheflcr, through Derby, to
London.

t»on; as, to overtake. There are alfo certain Particles
of this nature, which are combined with Verbs, but
hare no feparate exiftence in our language; as, be,
mit, See. in the words befal, tn if apply, See. Prepofi-
tions are frequently fubjoined to Verbs; in which cafe
they aflame the nature of the Adverb, and confidera-

Concord


Concord is, when words are required to be
in like Number, Cafe, Gender, or Perfon.
Government is, when one word caufes ano-
ther to be in fome Cafe 01 Form.
Pofuion is the proper arrangement of words.
RULES of CONCORD.
I. 9 I 'HE Verb agrees with its fubjecl in
X Number and Perfon.
Example/!* / learn. Thou improvejl. He
reads. We perceive. Ye underjland. They
write. The roje withers. Thou laugiiedjl. Peter
wept. Ye did play. He hath been diligent.

11. Two or more fubjecls of the fingular
Number, with a copulative Conjunflion be-
tween them, require a Verb plural.
England and Scotland arc feparaled br the
Tweed.
f Examples of this nature may at firft view appear
trifling and uonecdLiry; but perhaps experience will
fujw them to be ot ufe. In the Latin language it is
common to exemplify particular rules, before we pro-
ceed to refolve long and complicated fentences. And

RULES of POSITION.
XXV. The fubjed of affirmation ufually
precedes the Verb; as, Jirc burns; the bird
flits.
XXVI. But when a qucflion is alked, the
fubjed cither follows the Verb ; as, lovejl
thou ? or comes between the Auxiliary and the
Verb; as, doft thou love ?
XXVII. In like manner after the Verb im-
perative Mode, and the Adverbs here, there;
as, love thou ; there was a man.i
XXVIII. The
f The Verb nenter is fometioies followed by its
fubjed; as, at tbe end of which bung her pip*. The
rcalon is plain, that as the Verb neuter does not ad-
mit an object after it, the meaning is not liable to any
ambiguity.
The fubjed follows the Verb in fuch phrafis; as,
clarnt be ever fo *xijetj; bad be performed bit promifet
which feem elliptical, and put for, though he eharrt
ever fo wifely ; if be bad perforated hit prcmift.


XXVIII. The Adje&ive ufuallv precedes
the Noun, with which it is connected; as, a
worthy tium.f
XXIX. But if feme circumflance depend
upon the Adjc&ivc, it follows the Noun; as,
a man worthy to he praijed.
A good horje. A horje good for travelling.
A merciful man. A man merciful to the poor.
Give me convenient food. Give me food con-
venient for me.
XXX. A tranfitive Verb is followed by its
object; as. Alexander killed Clytus,
XXXI. The Relatives who, which, and that,
follow their antecedents.
The man, whom you ejleem. The horfe,
which runs. The bird, that flies.
XXXII. Adverbs ufually precede the Ad-
jectives, and follow the Verbs, with which
they are connected.
Deference is the moll elegant of all compli-
ments. A wife man will defire no more, than
what he may get jullly, ufe fobcrly, dijlrihute
chearfullv. and live upon contentedly.
XXXIII. But if the Verb have an Aux-
iliary, the Adverb may be placed between the
Auxiliary and the Verb.
Who
+ The Verb ts he, frequently come* between the
AHje&trc and the Noun; as, bUfedis tie m*mt h*ft/
is he.


Who is he, that hath not offended with his
tongue ? You have often deceived me. The time
is now come. It hath frequently happened.
XXXIV. Prcpofitions ufually come before
the words to which they relate; as, He went
from Dover to Calais.
XXXV. The Prepofition is frequently fe-
paraied from the Relative which it governs,
and placed at the end of a claufe or fentence.
Whom do you live with? Whom Jhall I
give the book to ? What will you play for ?
GENERAL DIRECTION.
In arranging the parts of a fentence, we
ought principally to aim at perfpicuity. In
general we may obferve, that words conneded
in fenfe, fliould be placed as near each other
as poflible—that circumflanccs fhould be
joined to thofe parts of a fentence on which
they are dependent—and the order of words
f orrefpond with the order of our ideas.

Remarks


Remarks on fome GRAMMATICAL FIGURES
Of ELLIPSIS.
ELLIPSIS is thcomiflionof one or more
words which the conftru&ion requires to
be fupplied, for the fake of brevity and ele-
gance. There arc few compound fentcnces,
which are not in fome degree elliptical: Syn-
tax therefore cannot be perfeflly taught, or
underftood, without a particular attention to
this figure. It will be an cxercife of advan-
tage to the fcholar in many refpeds, to point
out the various inflances of Ellipfis that oc-
cur: For example:
ill. The ellipfis of the NOUN; as, It is
better to receive than to do injury, i. e. It is
belter to receive injury, than to do injury. When
you come to St. Pouts, turn to the left. i. e.
When you come to St. Pouts church, turn to
the left hand.
adiv. Of the Adje&ivc; as, muck rain and
fnow; i. e. Much rain, and much /now.
3<lly. Of the RELATIVE; as, the horfe, you
bought is lame ; i. c. The horfe, which you
bought is lame.
4thly. Of the VERB ; as, What am /, and
from whence ? i. c. What am I, and from whence
am I ? So [aid, fo done; i. c. So it was faid,
fo it was done.
jthly.


sthly. Of the AKTICLE, ADVEKB, CONJUNC-
TION, and PaerosiTioN; as, The bow and or-*
rows are broken; i. e. The bow f and the arrows
are broken. He /peaks and writes well; i. e.
He /peaks well, and writes well. He is a very
agreeable, worthy man; i. c. He is a very agree-
able, and a very worthy man. I gave it to
your brother and Ji/ler; i. t. 1 gave it to your
brother, and to your fifier. I defire, you will
be more diligent; i. e. I defire , that you will be
more diligent.
They compliment, they fit, they chat,
Talk o'er the wars, re/orm the fiate,
A thou [and knotty points they dear,
'Till /upper and my wife appear. Prior,
i. e. They compliment, and they fit, and they
chat, &c.
Laftly; Of a confidcrable part of a fen-
tence; as, Nature has given to animals, one
time to aft, another to refi; i. e. Nature has
given to animals one time to aB; Nature has
given to animals another time to refi.
Of TRANSPOSITION.
TRANSPOSITION is the placing of words
out of their natural order, for the fake
of fome fu peri or beauty. It is feldom of ad-
vantage to invert the ftyle, except in poetic
language, and therefore the beft profe writers
G a have


have the feweft in fiances of tranfpofition. In
poetry alfo this figure is to be condemned, if
it endanger perfpicuity, or add not to the
beauty and harmony of the verfc. The Eng-
lifh language admits of confiderable liberty
in the arrangement of a word or claufe de-
noting fome circu inflance, which may be va-
rioufly placed without inconvenience, but is
ufually to be preferred at the beginning of a
fentence. It would be difficult, and perhaps
ufelefs to lay down rules comprehending every
allowable inflance of tranfpofition. The bell
in fir u&ion that can be given, is to attend to
the pra&ice of the inofl approved writers,
and always to preferve perfpicuity. It will
be an ufeful exercife to the fcholar to refolve
a iranfpofed fentence into its natural arrange-
ment; as for inflance, the beginning of Mil-
ton's Paradife Loft:
Of Mans jirjl difobedience, and tht fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whofe mortal tajle
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,
117//; Icfs of Eden, till one greater man
RfjU re us, and regain the blifsful feat,
Smz heavenly mufe.
The natural order of the foregoing fentence
is, Heavenly mufe, Jing of man s JirJl dif obedi-
ence, and the fruit, &c.


So jpake tK omnipotent, and with his words
AU Jeemd well pleas d; all feenCd, but were not
ell. Par. loft, b. 5.
i. c. So the omnipotent Jpake, and 4// feernd
well pleas'd with his words; all Jeem'd, but all
were not.
Of the Transformation of WOKDS.
IT fometiraes happens from particular cir-
cumftances, that a word lofes its common
fignification, and acquires the diftinguilhing
property of another part of fpeech.
Thus for in fiance; the Pojfejfwe Cafe of a
Noun, is equivalent to an Adjeftive; as, man's
life is jltort; i. c. human life is Jhort.
When two Nouns arc compounded together,
and joined with a hyphen, the firft of them
has ufually the fignification of an Adjective;
as, a bud-cngr, an z\t-houJe, a mzn-fervant, a
maid-/<n ant; and fomctimcs when the hy-
phen is omitted; as, a gold ring % a London
ma chant, a China orange, the noon-tide hour,
the mid-day fun.
An Adydive, when its Subflantive is un-
dcrflood, acquires the nature of a Noun; as,
The wife jit nil inhuit glory. Who will Jhew
us any good?f
f Atjiflhn are fo.nclioiet very improperly »fc«l
aaAcai


A Verb in the infinitive Mode, has generally
the fignification of a Noun; as, to err is hu-
man; i. e. error is human.
A Participle , when it has no refpe& to
time, becomes a mecr AdjeHive; as, a learned
man t a fpotted garment, a fi filing rod, a
pruning hook,
A Participle is fometimes converted into a
Noun; as, Hunting is a healthful excrcije.
She is fond of finging and dancing.
An Adverb , when it conne&s fcntences, may
be confidered as a Conjunction; as. He is angry
at you , not at me. Tou are very car clefs , alfo
very idle.
Some Adverbs have the ufc and conflrudion
of Pronouns; as, hereof hereby, wherein, where-
unto, &c.
A Conjunction , when it ceafes to conned
fcntenccs, is changed into an Adverb; as, I
think othcrwifc. He was then reading Cafars
commentaries.
A Prepofition fometimes afTumes the nature
of the Adverb , fometimes of the Conjunction;
as, He went before, J followed after. Think , be-
fore you fpeak. After you have fupped, you
may. walk if yev pleqfe.
EXER-
mftead of Adverbt; as, a remarkable wife man; be
•lied agreeable to bit pro wife: For, a remarkably
mtife man; be a fled igrcrably to bit fromi/e.

EXAMPLES of ENGLISH COMPOSITION,
Chiefly fclc&cd from the moll celebrated Au-
thors.
A Contented mind, and a good conference,
will make a man happy in all conditions.
Profperity gains friends, and adverfity tries
them.
Complaifance renders a fu peri or amiable,
an equal agreeable, and an inferior acceptable.
Without a friend, the world is but a wil-
dcrnefs.
By others* faults, wife men corrcd their
own.
Pitch upon that courfc of life, which is
moil plcafant, and cuilom will render it the
moil delightful.
Anger may glance into the bread of a wife
man, but reds only in the bofom of fools.
He that is truly polite, knows how to con-
tradift with refpccl, and to pleafe without
adulation ; and is equally remote from an
infipid complaifance, and low familiarity.
Honor thy father with thy whole ncart,
and forget not the forrows of thy mother:
How cand thou rccompenfe them the things
tbey have done for thee?
Truth is always confident with itfclf, and
needs nothing to help it out; whereas a lie
is


is troublefome, and fcts a man's invention on
the rack, and one trick needs a great many
more to make it good.
Many men have been capable of doing a
wife thing, more a conning thing, but very
few a generous thing.
If gratitude is due from man to man, how
much more from man to his creator? The
fupremc being does not only confer upon us
thofe bounties, which proceed more immedi-
ately from liis hand, but even thofe benefits,
which arc conveyed to us by others. Evay
blefling we enjoy, by what means focver it
may be derived upon us, is the gift of him,
who is the great author of good, and father
of mercies.
When Socrates was told that his judges
had fcntenced him to death; And hath not
nature (faid he) paficd the fame fcntence
upon them ?
He, who fwears, tdls us his bare word is
not to be credited.
True mode fly is afliamed of every thing
that is criminal; falfc modefly of every thing,
that is unfalhionable.
Nothing can be honorable, wliich is not
virtuous: Among the Romans, the entrance
to the temple of honor always lay through
the temple of virtue.
H * A


A man truly model! is as much fo when
alone, as in company, and as fubjeft to a
blufh in his clofet, as when the eyes of mul-
titudes are upon him.
The envious man is in pain, upon all
occafions which ought to give him pleafure.
The rclifti of his life is inverted, and the
objccls which adminifter the higheft fatisfac-
tion to thofe who are exempt from this paf-
fion, give the quickcfl pangs to thofe who
arc fubjeft to it. All the perfections of their
fcUow-crcaturcs are odious: Youth, beauty,
valour and wifdom, arc provocations of their
difplcafure. hut if we confider the envious
man in delight, it is like reading the feat of
a giant in romance; the magnificence of his
houfc confifts in the many limbs of men,
whom he has flain.
Zealous men arc ever difplaving to you
the llrcng.h of their belief, while judicious
men are ihewing you the grounds of it.
Avarice is the mod oppofite of all charac-
ters to that of God Almighty; whofc alone
it is to give, and not receive.
Harmony of period, and melody of ftile,
have greater weight than is generally imagined
in the judgment, we pafs upon writing and
writers. As a proof of this, let us rcflcd,
what texts of fcripturc, what lines in poetry,


or what periods, we mod remember, and
quote, either in verfe or profe, and we
find them to be only mufical ones.
Whoever thinks a faullUfs piece to fee,
Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er Jhall be.
In evry work regard the writer s end,
Since none can cowpafs more than they intend.
And if the means be jujl, the conduß true,
Applaufe, in Jpite of trivial faults, is due.
Pope, EC on Crit.
A little learning is a dangerous thing;
Drink deep, or tajle not the Pierian fpring:
There jhallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
And drinking largely fobers us again. Ditto.
Now fhicld with fhield, helmet with helmet clos'd.
To armour armour, lance to lance oppos'd,
Hofl againjl hojl, with fuadowy fquadrons drew f
The founding darts in iron tempejls flew,
Viclors and vanquifh'd join promifcuous cries,
And Jhrilling fuouts and dying groans arife;
With Jlreamiug blood, the flippery fields are dy d,
And Jlaughter d heroes fiuell the dreadful tide.
Pope's Homer.
Now forming fury rofe.
And clamour, fiich as heard in heav n till now
IF<« never, arms on armour clajhing hrayd
Horrible dif cord, and the madding wheels


Of braicn chariots rag'd; dire was the noife
Of confliS; over-head the difmal hifs
Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew.
And flying, vaulted either hofl with f re.
So under fiery cope together rufh'd
Both battles main, with furious affault
And incxtinguifhable rage; all heaven
Refounded, and had earth bun there, all earth
Had to her centre fhook. Par. Loft.
EPITAPH on Mr. GAY
Of manners gentle, of affc&ions mild;
In wit a man; fimplicitj a child:
With native humour tempt ing virtuous rage,
Found to delight at once, and lafh the age:
Above temptation in a low eflate,
And uncorrupted evn among the great:
A fafe companion, and an eafy friend,
Unblamd through life, lamented in thy end.
Thefe are thy honours ! not that here thy bujl
is mixd with heroes, or with kings thy dufl;
But that the worthy and the good fhall fay.
Striking their penfive bofoms —Here lies GAY.
ELEGY to the Memory of an unfortunate
LADY. V. 47.
What can alone (ch ever injur'd fhade!)
Thr fate unpitfd, and thy rites unpaid ?


No frictufs complaint , wo kind domeflie tear
Picas d thy pale ghojl, or grae'd thy mournful bier;
By foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd,
By foreign hands thy decent limbs compos d,
By foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd,
Byflrangers honord, and by flrangers mourn d!
What tho' no friends in fable weeds appear,
Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,
And bear about the mockery of woe
To midnight dances, and the public Jhow?
What tho' no weeping loves thy ajhes grace,
Nor poliJKd marble emulate thy facet
What tho' no facred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb ?
Yet Jhall thy grave with fifing fiow'rs be drefi,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy brtqjl:
There Jhall the morn her earliefl tears be/low.
There the Jirfl rofes of the year Jhall blow;
While angels with their filver wings o'erjhade
The ground now facred by thy relics made.
So peaceful rcjls without a flone a name,
What once had beauty t titles, wealth and fame.
How lov'd, how honor d once, avails thee not,
To whom related, or by whom begot;
A heap of dufl alone remains of thee,
*77s all thou art, and all the proud fhall be!
Poets themfelves mujl fall like thofe they fung.
Deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue.
Evh


Evn he whofe foul now melts in mournful lap,
Shall fhortly want the genrous tear he pap;
Then from his clofing eyes thy form fhall part.
And the lajl pang fhall tear thee from his heart.
Lifts idle busnefs at one gafp be oar,
The mufe forgot, and thou belovd no morel
Pope.
Prefumptuousman! the reafon WOUISLJI thou find.
Why formd fo weak, fo little, and fo blind?
Firjl if thou canfl, the harder reafon guefs.
Why formd no weaker, blinder, and no lefs?
Afli of thy mother earth, why oaks are made
Taller or flronger than the weeds they Jhade ?
Or ajk of yonder argait fields above.
Why Jones fatellites are lefs than Jove?
Ditto.
