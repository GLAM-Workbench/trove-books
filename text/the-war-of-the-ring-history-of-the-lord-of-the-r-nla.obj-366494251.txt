The True story
of the Beginning of the
Artesian Water Supply
of Australia.
THIRTY years ago the pastoralists of West-
ern Queensland were struggling with a
devastating drought. The Government
had appointed an Hydraulic Engineer to
take charge of operations for the conser-
vation of water, and under his direction
dams were being built and tanks excavated,
in order to keep the main stock routes open
and to supply the inland townships; but at
times the settlers were put to such sore straits
that it seemed as if their holdings must be
abandoned. Well-sinking had been tried,
with but little success. In 1882 four boring
machines were secured, and an attempt was made
to probe still deeper beneath the surface of the


earth, in the hope of tapping a subterranean
supply of water.* At Winton, in Central
Queensland, expectations were so far realised
that water was found at a depth of 336 feet; but
it had to be raised to the surface by pumping or
baling, and was by no means adequate for the
purpose of supplying the needs of the township.
In January, 1884, Winton was only saved from a
water famine by trains of tanks mounted on
waggons being hauled there by the traction
engines used in connection with steam scoops for
excavating reservoirs.!
All this time there lay beneath the drought-
stricken districts a vast body of clear, fresh water
under a sufficient pressure to make it gush forth
from the subterranean depths as soon as an out-
let should be provided. The discovery of this
supply was left to private enterprise; and it is my
purpose In this pamphlet to place on record the

facts connected therewith, from the point of view
of intimate personal knowledge.
In the early eighties, my brother-in-law, the
late Mr. William Collins, of Queensland, one of
the owners of a property on M‘Kinley Creek, a
tributary of the Flinders, had described to me
some very remarkable mounds of sand—appar-
ently caused by springs—which had been dis-
covered on the property, and a few years later I
visited the place in company with Mr. Collins.
In these mounds, which occurred in several places,
and rose in some instances to a height of 10 or 12
feet, with a diameter of perhaps 20 feet, the per-
petual movement of almost infinitesimal particles
of sand gave evidence of the slow upward per-
colation of water. In my youth I had read with
avidity tales of the discovery of artesian water in
France and elsewhere. On hearing of these
movements it appeared to me likely that in this
direction lay the explanation of the phenomenon.
In this way I was imbued with the idea that an
artesian supply might yet be found to spread its
benefits over the thirsty pastures of Western
Queensland; and not many years were to elapse
before the idea bore practical fruit.

About the beginning of 1882 I had been asso-
ciated with several other gentlemen in the forma-
tion of the Squatting Investment Company 1 in
Melbourne; and in 1886 we held the lease of the
Thurulgoona run, in Southern Queensland, where
the effects of the then existing drought conditions
were being felt to a disastrous extent. At this
juncture I met in Sydney Mr. J. S. Loughead, a
Canadian well-borer, who had come to Australia
with a plant by means of which he hoped to be
able to locate petroleum deposits. Meeting
with no encouragement from the New South
Wales Government, he found himself in a some-
what difficult position, and was more than
inclined to lend a favourable ear to private pro-
posals. My interest in boring operations being
stimulated by the pressing necessities of the
Squatting Investment Company’s holding, I
determined to seize the opportunity thus offered.
Loughead was brought to Melbourne, and on
June 9th, 1886, he signed an agreement to bore
for water “in such place or places as the Com-
pany . . . may direct,” to an aggregate
depth of 5,000 feet, in five or more wells.
Some delay was occasioned by the necessity of

importing more plant from America; but in a few
months Longhead was on the road from Bourke
to Thurulgoona with his men and equipment, the
sight of the novel American waggons which con-
veyed the machinery creating quite a sensation in
the districts through which they passed. On
December 17th, 1886, the sinking of the first bore
was commenced in the “Cotton-bush Paddock,”
about thirty miles from the township of Cunna-
mulla, Queensland. At this time the Hydraulic
Engineer’s Department was prosecuting boring
operations by means of “Tiffin machines,
“Water Augers,” and other appliances, progress
with which was slow and unsatisfactory; but
Loughead’s undertaking was carried out by
means of a “Canadian Pole Tool” plant, the first
of its kind introduced to Australia. In six
weeks he had reached the depth of 1,000 feet, and
had not gone much further when he found water
rising in the bore and overflowing from the tub-
ing at the surface of the ground. This event
happened in February, 1887, and was the begin-
ning of the artesian water supply of Australia.
Elated by his success, Loughead reported to
our manager that he had struck an abundant
supply of water; and the news having been tele-

graphed to headquarters in Melbourne, instruc-
tions were given that sheep should be put into the
paddock. I myself immediately set out for
Thurulgoona, and found the water flowing as
described, and a second bore in progress. There
was no mistaking the fact that artesian water had
been struck; but to my dismay, on measuring the
supply I found that it only amounted to about
3,000 gallons a day—a mere trickle for stock-
watering purposes. Subsequent events proved
that the actual supply available had hardly been
broached, for the sinking of the same bore
another 100 feet increased the flow to 80,000
gallons per diem; while the second bore, which at
1,241 feet gave 1,000 gallons, on being deepened
to 1,682 feet, was made to yield 576,000 gallons
in twenty-four hours.
There is much of mystery about the origin
of this artesian water; but it seems clear
enough that its ultimate source is to be
found in the rainfall which for century
after century has been pouring upon the
plateaux and ridges of the Great Dividing
Range of Queensland. In these elevated areas
the strata of the earth’s crust have been up-
heaved and mingled by some great primeval dis-

turbance and in this way there have been exposed
those absorbent sands and gravels which else-
where are covered by impermeable rocks. With
an “intake” at these high altitudes, the water, as
it passes underground, always has a tendency to
rise to the level at which it was first received; and
it needs but the piercing of the overlying rock
to give outlet to a gushing jet which will some-
times rise to a height of many feet above the
surface of the ground. It is almost invariably
of crystalline clearness, and frequently has a
temperature of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit;
while the introduction of delicate instruments into
bores has demonstrated the fact that it has a
constant “set” or current, tending mostly in a
south-west direction.
Immediately upon hearing of the success which
had attended our operations, Mr. Henderson, the
Hydraulic Engineer, urged upon his Ministerial
head the desirability of making investigations,
and telegraphed to the Squatting Investment
Company for permission to inspect the bores,
which was readily given. The immediate out-
come of his visit was the opening of negotiations
with Loughead for the sinking of bores for the

Government. The matter is thus referred to in
the report of the Hydraulic Engineer for the
year ending June 30th, 1887: —
“During the year the Department has been
“in communication with many Canadian and
“American well drillers . . . and after
“much correspondence on the subject generally,
“it is satisfactory to report that Mr. Loughead
“tendered to bore within four years an aggre-
gate of 7,500 feet in not less than three bores of
“2,500 feet; . . .
“By direction of the late Treasurer, in April
“last I visited Thurulgoona Station, on the New
“South Wales border, where, before completing
“negotiations with Mr. Loughead, I carefully
“inspected boring operations in progress under a
“contract that gentleman has with the Squatting
“Investment Company of Melbourne. There I
“found that Mr. Loughead had successfully com-
“pleted one bore to a depth of about 1,079
“by means of the ‘Canadian Pole Tool’ boring
“machinery, and that a second bore I then saw
“in progress had reached a depth of about 500
“feet. In the first bore a very good supply of
“really excellent fresh water had been tapped, I
“was informed, at a depth of about 1,009 feet,

“the water overflowing in my presence to a
“height of about 20 inches over the surface of
“the ground, the results obtained being, in my
“opinion, most satisfactory.”*
The wording of the preceding paragraphs
tends to obscure the fact that it was the success
of the “Canadian Pole Tool” at Thurulgoona
which first drew Departmental attention to the
work of Loughead’s party; yet such was un-
doubtedly the case. As the official history of
Queensland, issued in 1909, puts it, “This was
apparently the first artesian water Mr. Hender-
son had seen In Queensland,”! and from the sink-
ing of this bore at Thurulgoona dates the begin-
ning of the whole great artesian well system of
Australia, the record henceforth being one of
remarkable successes instead of failures.

The first bore put down by Longhead for the
Government was commenced on 16th November,
1887, at Barcaldine, in Central Queensland.
Here, after a month’s work, artesian water was
tapped at a depth of 645 feet, and in a little time
a flow of over 175,000 gallons a day was
obtained. About the same time another “Cana-
dian Pole Tool” was got to work on the bore at
Blackall, an undertaking which had had rather a
curious history. Commenced in December,
1885, it was taken over in October, 1886, by an
American well-driller named Arnold, who got to
work on it with a “Pennsylvania Walking Beam
Oil Rig;” but much delay was occasioned by the
jamming of the tubing in the bore, and a depth
of 1,039 f eet having been reached without
artesian water being struck, Arnold threw up the
job in September, 1887, and the bore was
plugged “pending further consideration.” In
January, 1888, work was resumed upon it with
a “Canadian Pole Tool;” and, this machine suc-
ceeding where others had failed, “an abundant
supply of overflowing, sparkling, fresh artesian
water” was tapped on April 26th, at a depth of
12

1,645 feet, the rate A° w being estimated at
300,000 gallons per day.*
The fact that the “Canadian Pole Tool” was
the only form of machine adapted for deep well-
boring in Australia having thus been demon-
strated, the “water auger,” “walking beam,”
“Tiffin” and other styles of apparatus were soon
discarded, and from the Hydraulic Engineer’s
report for 1888-9 we learn that—“ The com-
paratively light machines the Department used
until recently . . . were set aside as the
works on which they were employed were sus-
pended or completed.” By the use of the
“Canadian Pole Tool,” which has maintained its
supremacy to the present day, the artesian system
was expanded with marvellous rapidity, and six
or seven years later bores were numbered in hun-
dreds. By 1909 the total flow of artesian water
in Queensland was estimated at nearly 500 mil-
lion gallons per day—truly a remarkable growth
from that one little well in the cotton-bush pad-
dock at Thurulgoona.

To gain some idea of the results which have
accrued from the bestowal of this magnificent
boon upon a drought-stricken country, one has
merely to turn to comparative statistics. The
live stock of Queensland, sheep and cattle, which
were estimated to number 13! millions in 1884,
by 1896 had risen to 26 millions; while the annual
value of beasts exported, which from 1872 to
1884 had only increased from £366,000 to
£572,000, in the succeeding twelve years rose to
£859,000, and by 1908 was nearly double that
sum. The meat export trade, which between
1872 and 1884 was worth only £60,000 or
£70,000, by 1896 had leapt up to the enormous
figure of £898,500; and in the same period the
amount received from the export of wool had
increased by more than a million sterling.* Much
of this marvellous progress is to be credited to
the development of the artesian water system, the
true facts concerning the beginning of which are
now for the first time placed on record.

history of Queensland before quoted.
