BARBARA LEARNS TO KNIT
Why don t you go for a swim
with us, Mummy? asked Barbara
one day.
Mother was sitting on the beach
while Barbara and Brian ran about
the sand and in and out of the
water, splashing each other and
laughing merrily. Then they would
build a jolly sand castle near the
water s edge and clap their hands
each time a little wave would come
along and wash it away.
"Because I must finish this knit-
ting," answered Mother,

"But why are you always knitting?
asked Barbara.
"I knit during the lovely summer
days/' said Mummy "so that you
will have nice warm clothes to
wear in the winter time.
"Look, this will be a lovely warm
jumper for you, Barbara/' Mummy
said, holding it up again to show
them. "When I have finished this,
I shall make a pair of socks for little
Brian. Then, here is some nfce soft
wool for a little coat for Baby," and
Mummy smiled.
"And don't forget Daddy," she
went on "he must have warm
jumpers too."
Barbara thought of her family of

dollies that had to be dressed
every morning, and undressed and
put to bed each night. I wonder
if my dolls will be cold when winter
comes," she said "Perhaps I should
learn to knit too, so that they can
have nice woolly jumpers and
socks and gloves and things, then
when we go out on cold days they
be just as warm as I'll be. Would
you teach me to knit, please
Mummy?" "Certainly, my dear,
replied Mother, and while Brian
built more sand castles and romped
around. Mother took a skein o
wool from her bag and held it while
Barbara wound it into a big ball.
Then Mother showed Barbara how
to hold her knitting needles and


began teaching her to knit that
very day.
Barbara was a very bright little
girl and learned very quickly. Soon
she was making all kinds of lovely
woolly things for her dollies.
When winter came the big doll
Patsie had a lovely warm jumper
and scarf to match Barbara s new
one that Mummy had made. Also,
Golliwog had a beautiful red scarf
and gloves to keep out the coldest
winds.
Barbara was a very proud little
girl as she took her dollies walking,
everyone admired their new
woollies and said what a clever
little girl Barbara was.
