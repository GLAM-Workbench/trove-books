HISTORY OF
St. GEORGE’S CHURCH,
CASTLEREAGH STREET, SYDNEY,
In connection with the Presbyterian Church of
Eastern A ustralia.
fHE Kirk Session of St. George’s Church, Sydney, having
resolved that the final liquidation of the long-standing
debt on the Church was a fitting opportunity for reviewing its
past history, and presenting an outline of the circumstances in
which it originated, and the experiences through which it has
passed, till the present time, appointed the Senior Elder,
Mr. E. A. Rennie, long and intimately acquainted with its
whole history, to prepare the same. This he has done, and the
record having been submitted to the Session and congregation,
and approved of, it is now printed in a revised and somewhat
abridged form, for the benefit of the present congregation, and of
those who come after.
In the year 1842, when the population of Sydney scarcely
reached 25,000, there were but three Presbyterian Churches in
the city, viz., —Dr. Lang’s, Scots’ Church, Church Hill; Dr.
McGarvie’s, St. Andrew’s ; and Dr. Fullerton’s, Scots’ Church,
Pitt Street South. These, with a few country congregations,
were all included under the description of the Synod of Aus-
tralia in connection with the Established Church of Scotland,
and thus all the Presbyterians in the colony were reckoned as
belonging to the Established Church of Scotland, to whatever
Presbyterian Church they may have belonged before they reached
the colony.


For certain reasons, in the year referred to, the Rev. Dr.
Lang was deposed from the ministry, and the Rev. Wm.
Mclntyre was appointed to preach his church vacant. This he
was not allowed to do by the Scots’ Church congregation, as
indeed had been expected. The appointed service was never-
theless conducted in a large room, which had been secured in
Macquarie Place —then used as the Sydney Exchange, and now
occupied as the Shipping Master’s offices. To that room the
Rev. Mr. Mclntyre was escorted by a number of the Scots’
Church congregation, who thereafter continued to assemble from
Sabbath to Sabbath under the sanction of the Presbytery, which
provided supply of ministrations. At the first Communion
observed in that room a short time afterwards, the Rev. Mr.
Tait, of Parramatta, presiding, there were found 22 persons who
had been members of Dr. Lang’s congregation—some of whom
are still living, two being on the Communion Roll of this Church.
These twenty-two Communicants, with their families, and a
proportion of adherents, continued as a congregation (or, as nick-
named by Dr. Lang and his friends, the “Conventicle ”) but without
a settled minister, during the remainder of 1842 in the Exchange
Room, and afterwards, during part of 1843 and 1844, in the
school room of the College High School, in Castlereagh Street—
now No. 156, occupied as the Star Hotel.
In the latter year the Rev. Robert Wylde, M.A., one of the
professors in the Australian College, who had officiated for the
congregation with acceptance for some time regularly, found it
necessary to retire to his station in the interior. The congre-
gation, however, kept up a fitful existence till the end of 1845,
when they, along with others, succeeded in inducing the Rev.
Thomas Mowbray to leave the district of Port Phillip, where he
was settled, to become pastor of a fourth congregation in Sydney.
A building opposite the Mint (previously a Wesleyan Chapel)
was secured for the purpose, and a flourishing congregation was
soon gathered within its walls, embracing a considerable number
of influential Presbyterians of the city. In the following year,
however, (1846) the question as to whether the Synod of Aus-
tralia should adopt the position taken by the Free Church of
Scotland in 1843, came to a final issue—the result being that
only three of the then ministers —and neither of them a city
Minister —adhered to a previous resolution of the Synod to take
the side of the Free Church. Those ministers, viz., the Rev.
Wm. Mclntyre, of W. Maitland, Rev. Colin Stewart, of Yale of
Clwydd, and the Rev. John Tait, of Parramatta, with Elders Dr.
Hill and Mr. Samuel Martin, then, on 18th October, 1846,
formed themselves into a separate Synod under the designation
of the Synod of Eastern Australia. The Rev. Mr. Mowbray also
separated from the Synod of Australia, having sought to occupy


a middle position. In consequence of this, and in conjunction
with other circumstances, several of his office bearers, and of the
families of his congregation who had espoused the cause of the
Free Church, separated from him at the disruption of the Synod,
and formed a new congregation under the auspices of the Synod
of Eastern Australia.
For this new congregation a building in Pitt Street, then
recently vacated by the Congregationalists for their larger Church
on the opposite side of the street, was purchased from them at a
cost, including interest, of .£1471, payable over a period of three
years, the purchase money being provided by bills given by the
Rev. Wm. Mclntyre, Dr. Menzies, of Kiama, and Mr. Wm.
Buyers, of Sydney, with collateral security given by Mr. W. E.
Mclntosh, then of the firm of Mclntosh, Hirst, and Co.,
merchants, of Sydney. Shortly after this the Rev. Mr. Mowbray
fell ill, and was unable to continue preaching except at great risk
to his life. The congregation consisting, as it did, of heterogeneous
elements, and distracted with recent conflicts as to the Free
Church question and other causes, became disorganized, and
finally broke up in July, 1847, with the loss to the Presbyterian
Church of several influential families.
The new Free Church congregation in Pitt street having no
minister of their own, were supplied as could be arranged by the
three ministers already named, but for the most part by the Rev.
Colin Stewart. On vacant Sabbaths at least a morning service
was kept up, sermons being read by the nominal Elders of the
congregation, Messrs. Peter Stewart, Wm. Buyers, Henry L.
Black, and John Little, each of them, as it happened, represent-
ing a different section of the Church in the mother country.
This state of things continued for about two years and a half,
correspondence going on in the meantime with the Colonial
Committee of the Free Church of Scotland as to sending out a
minister duly qualified to take a leading position in the metro-
polis of the Colony—then including the now separated colonies of
Victoria and Queensland.
In March, 1849, the Rev. George Mackie arrived with cre-
dentials from the Colonial Committee, but the Church here were
informed that he was not the man they intended to send for
Sydney in compliance with the call which had been virtually
placed in their hands by the Sydney congregation. Mr. Mackie
however —an enthusiastic young man, full of fire and energy—
very soon won the affections of most of the people, and increased
the attendance. With only 35 male communicants —who at that
time were alone allowed to vote—Mr. Mackie proceeded, under
the sanction of the Synod, to the election of a Kirk Session and a
Deacons’ Court, the first court of the kind established in the


colony. The following document was printed and circulated in
reference to that election :
Free Church, Pitt Street,
Sydney, 23rd May, 1849.
On which night, pursuant to notice from the Pulpit on the previous
Sabbath, the pro tem Session met, and after being constituted the follow-
ing resolutions were unanimously agreed to, viz. :
First—“ That in accordance with the resolution of last Synod, an
election of Elders and Deacons be proceeded with according to the
Act of 1842, of the Church of Scotland.”
Second —“ That the number of Elders be four, the Deacons six.” And
Third—“ That the following list of male adherents be recognized, in
the meantime, as bona,fide Communicants,” viz. :
Billerwell, John
Black, Henry L.
Buyers, William
Cargo, William
Dumble, John

The result was the election of Messrs. Peter Stewart, Wm.
Buyers, John Little, and John McDonald, to the Eldership, and
Messrs. Alex. Learmonth, E. A. Rennie, James G. Wilson,
Henry L. Black, Peter McLaren, and James Reynolds, to the
Deaconship.
While waiting for the arrival of Mr. Mackie a singular
incident occurred. One morning the passenger list of arrivals
contained the name of the Rev. Wm. Mackee. Expecting that
this must be the new minister, he was immediately waited upon.
It turned out, however, that Mr. Mackee was from the Presby-
terian Church of Ireland. He expressed his sympathy with the
Free Church, and having no engagement, he said he might as well
cast in his lot with the Free Church here, and so he was engaged
to preach for a while. He very soon, however, found another
sphere of usefulness under the Synod of Australia. His career
was not encouraging, and his end was a very sad one.
On the arrival six months afterwards, in September, 1849,
of the Rev. Alexander Salmon, from Barrhead, appointed by the
Colonial Committee of the Free Church, the congregation were, of
course, bound to accept him as their minister, although loathe to
part with Mr. Mackie. Many families who had stood aloof, and
had afforded neither aid nor encouragement in any way to the
Free Church, now immediately joined the congregation, on finding


so acceptable a preacher, as Mr. Salmon was, settled over them.
But the circumstance that a Kirk Session and Deacons’ Court had
already been elected occasioned great dissatisfaction, for two
reasons, first, because there were included among the office-bearers
certain parties who had by their antecedent procedure in the
Church rendered themselves more or less obnoxious to them ; and
second, because the election from so small a membership had
prevented all the acceding families from being represented by
office-bearers of their own choosing.
This dissatisfaction revived a movement begun in 1847, by-
Mr. Mowbray’s congregation, for the translation of the Rev. Mr.
Tait, then of Parramatta, to Sydney. Mr. Gilbert Elliot, Police
Magistrate at Parramatta, was one of Mr. Tait’s chief supporters,
but that gentleman removed to Sydney, in December, 1849, on his
appointment as Sheriff of the Colony, and several others of
Mr. Tait’s congregation also came to Sydney about the same time.
Thus it happened that Mr. Tait advocated his own translation,
but it was strongly opposed by Mr. MTntyre, and pamphlets were
published setting forth the reasons on both sides, pro and con , and
forming very interesting historical documents. The Synod held
that the fostering of the one congregation in Sydney was the
preferable course, but it led to the transference of Mr. Tait’s
services to the Church at Port Phillip, and the final alienation of
certain parties from the Presbyterian Church.
But the disposal of Mr. Tait and his friends did not leave
matters quiet for any length of time. The expansion of Mr.
Salmon’s congregation did not necessarily imply an extension of
the Free Church interest, but it did involve what might be termed
a dilution of influence of a certain section of the nominally Free
Church congregation in Pitt-street. Hence a casus belli soon arose,
and in this way. There being about the year 1852 no High School
in Sydney, or indeed in the Colony, a movement was set on foot
to establish a Grammar School in the City, and another in
Maitland, with Presbyterian, and especially with Free Church,
proclivities in their management, &c. From whatever cause
arising, the parties sought and obtained the active co-operation of
the Rev. Mr. MTntyre, of West Maitland, in the accomplishment
of their designs, and ignored the Free Church minister of Sydney,
the Rev. Alex. Salmon. How, one of the qualifications which had
great weight in the appointment of Mr. Salmon as the colonial
representative of the Free Church interest, was his possession of
experience and abilities eminently suitable for organising and
establishing such educational institutions of a high order, as
opportunity might give in connection with the Free Church in
Sydney. The action taken in this matter within Mr. Salmon’s
congregation, but without his own concurrence, and without the
sanction of his Session and Deacons’ Court, led to a paper war


between Mr. Salmon and Mr. M‘lntyre, and to a deadlock in the
Kirk Session of the Pitt-street congregation, requiring the inter-
position of the Presbytery of Sydney, and resulting in the removal
of the obstructive parties from the Kirk Session on the petition of
the congregation. That occurred some time during the year 1853,
by which time the congregation considered it advisable to provide a
larger building for their accommodation, and entered upon arrange-
ments which resulted in the sale of the old Church and their
transference to the Iron Church in Macquarie-street, in 1855.
The Trustees of the Church in Pitt-street endeavoured, by means
of a not very creditable character, to prevent the sale of it, with a
view to its preservation for a second congregation, then begun to
be contemplated by the disaffected parties, and this occasioned, as
ascertained at the time, a loss of at least £IOOO in the price
realised for it.
While the Pitt-street congregation were struggling with
financial difficulties, arising out of the Iron Church enterprise,
somebody started the idea of calling the Rev. Dr. Mackay, then
of Melbourne, to Sydney, to form a new congregation. Dr.
Mackay had paid a visit to Sydney, and had, of course, been heard
in the Pitt-street Church, and appreciated by those who understood
him. He had been some short time in Victoria, and had, it was
understood, got a church built for him there at a great expense,
and much beyond the means of his congregation to pay. It was
supposed that he would be willing to come if asked, and accord-
ingly at the very close of the year 1854 a deputation proceeded to
Melbourne on that errand, backed by about 150 names of persons
who, in the usual terms, proposed to become his congregation.
The deputation were not successful, but by the lapse of another
twelve months the parties interested in the movement got advice,
somehow, that a second application to Dr. Mackay would probably
meet with a favourable response. Accordingly action was taken,
the Synod’s sanction obtained, and a new call, with a reduced roll
of 100 names only adhibited to it, was presented, and in due form
accepted early in the year 1856, Dr. Mackay’s former scruples
having in the meantime given way.
From an entry in the Kirk Session records, it appears that
shortly after Dr. Mackay’s induction a Kirk Session was formed,
consisting of William Buyers, merchant, Sydney, Peter Stewart,
builder, Sydney, John M‘Donald, clothier, Sydney, and John
Moon, surgeon, Sydney; and some time afterwards a Deacons’
Court was formed, the Deacons being Messrs. Robert Campbell,
John L. Sherriff, John Tait, James Cameron, sen., James Cameron,
jun., Hugh M‘Master, James W. Waugh, and William Munro.
Great efforts were made to give as much eclat as possible to the
settlement of Dr. Mackay. A public breakfast was devised and
given to him on the 12th May, 1856, two days after his induction.


The Herald report says that about fifty or sixty gentlemen were
present, including a large number of ministers from the country,
and that the speakers on the occasion were the Revs. W. M‘lntyre,
and George Mackie, of the Free Presbyterian Church, the Rev.
Dr. Ross, of the Congregational Church, Pitt-street, and the Rev.
James Voller, of the Baptist Church in Bathurst-street.
The chair was occupied by Mr. Gilbert Elliot, already
mentioned, who, by that time, had been appointed Chief Com-
missioner of the city of Sydney, on the abolition of the old
Corporation in 1853.
The chairman considered “ that the gentleman who had cast
in his lot among us was one of the brightest ornaments of the
Presbyterian Church, and wished that some one had been chosen
to occupy the chair more identified with the Free Church, but as
a member of the Church of Scotland—of the Presbyterian Church
in its widest sense —he had great pleasure in being present to
welcome their venerable and revered friend, Dr. Mackay, believing
from his conciliatory disposition, and vast experience, that he may
be the means in the hands of Divine Providence of extending the
cause of Presbyterianism in this colony, and of effecting a happy
union between the members of the whole Presbyterian body, an
object very much to be desired by all who have the welfare of the
Presbyterian Church at heart.”
Mr. D. McAlpine, the Secretary to the Committee of Callers,
after a brief narrative of the proceedings up to this meeting,
spoke in glowing terms of their bright prospects from the great
and varied gifts of the minister now called, and of their expec-
tations in gathering in outside and lapsed Presbyterians, of whom
in all there were estimated to be 12,000 in and about Sydney,
and accommodation for 5000 only.* From such remarks it would
appear that the object of the call to Dr. Mackay was to provide
ministrations for Presbyterians outside of those already provided
for by the existing ministry of the city, in the expectation that
all the stray Presbyterians of every class and of every shade of
opinion would at once flock to a minister possessing such gifts
and graces as were attributed to Dr. Mackay.
When Dr. Mackay arrived there was, of course, no Church
for him, but his congregation met in a building rented at £2OO
a year, at the back of the east side of George Street, near Hunter
Street, and were under obligations to provide him with a stipend
of £6OO per annum. The small success which attended his
ministrations in this place, was attributed—not to Dr. Mackay’s
unsuitableness to the circumstances, notwithstanding his learning

and experience—but to the want of a fine church, which, it was
supposed, would make up for all deficiencies, draw to it the higher
classes of the community, and raise the respectability of the
Church at large. * * *
* * * * *
In the meantime Dr. Mackay’s congregation were going
hopelessly into debt, irrespectively of the enormous liabilities
they were incurring for the new church, and their numbers
and means were dwindling away until, in 1861, after occupy-
ing this building for about twelve months, his Deacons’ Court
were obliged to tell him they could no longer undertake to
continue his stipend of £6OO, and could only offer him the
Sustentation Fund dividend, with such additions as they might
be able to make to it, hoping that it would not be less than
£4OO a year. On this, of course, Dr. Mackay resigned his
charge, after a ministry of about five years, leaving his congrega-
tion, in April, 1861, with a debt of over £12,000. Of this sum
about £2OOO represented the deficit on the income for current
expenses, and the remainder, the balance unsubscribed for the
building, say £lO,OOO. At this same time the deficit was going
on at the rate of £B5O per annum, with a diminishing income
from a decreasing congregation. The annual cost of interest
alone amounted to £903 10s.
This hopeless condition of indebtedness forced the congrega-
tion to invoke the advice of the Synod. At a pro re nata meet-
ing, called to consider the case, the Synod condemned the erection
of a building so costly, and beyond the means of the congregation,
but recommended its people to contribute to the wiping off of the
sum of £5,500, which was not covered by a mortgage, in the
hope that the congregation, by such aid, would surmount their
difficulties.*
In November, 1861, Mr. Mclntyre reported £4,800 as
subscribed, but at the following Synod in November, 1862, his
report was that £4OOO only had been paid, leaving still £l5OO
of floating debt, or a total of £BOOO.
With an income insufficient to meet the annual charge for
interest alone the congregation were of course not in a position
to offer a stipend to a minister, and the Macquarie Street charge
having become vacant by the resignation, in 1860, of the Ilev.
Mr. Salmon, overtures were made to that congregation with a
view to an amalgamation of interests. But the Macquarie Street
congregation had their own burdens to meet, and were indisposed
to incur the risk of a renewal of complications, such as had arisen
* A full account of the congregation’s proposals, and of the Synod’s
resolutions, can be seen in a pamphlet entitled “An Appeal to the Pres-
byterians of New South Wales in behalf of St. George’s Church, Sydney,”
a copy of which is filed in the Free Public Library.


before—not to speak of the formidable debt on St. George’s
Church. So, for about nine or ten months after Dr. Mackay’s
resignation, the congregation had to be content with such tem-
porary ministrations as could be arranged for. At length, in
February, 1862, after more than one effort made in that direction,
the Rev. Wm. Mclntyre, of W. Maitland, consented to take the
oversight of St. George’s congregation without stipend, and con-
tinued to do so until his death in 1870, about eight years in all.
It should be observed by the way that the transference of
Mr. Mclntyre to Sydney led to the loss of the W. Maitland
congregation to the Free Church however it may have served
to save St. George’s Church from passing out of its interest.
Matters mended a little after Mr. Mclntyre’s settlement, for
he was a most devoted and faithful minister to his people, and a
most instructive teacher although strangers to him required
some little time to apprehend and appreciate his line of doctrine.
Hence his congregation was slow in gaining accessions. He had
besides to contend—so to speak —against more popular ministra-
tions elsewhere, which attracted many who might have reaped
greater advantage from his Scriptural and solid instruction.
As helps to illustrate the position of the church it may be
worth while to notice that in the year 1855-6 —the year of
Dr. Mackay’s call to Sydney—the foundation stones were laid
of Chalmers’ Church, Redfern, an enterprise begun by the Mac-
quarie Street congregation, whose new iron church was finished
and opened in the same year, and of the Phillip Street Church in
the interest of the United Presbyterians, whose minister, the
Rev. Hugh Darling, officiated in the Supreme Court, King
Street, for a while. The year 1856 was also remarkable for the
arrival of the present Bishop of the Episcopalian Church, and
also of the late Governor Sir Wm, T. Denison—both distin-
guished from their predecessors, the one for his evangelical
teaching, and the other for his active encouragement of every-
thing tending to raise the moral character of the community.
In the year 1855 was proclaimed the present constitution of the
colony.
Now in 1862, when Mr. Mclntyre came to St. George’s,
Dr. Mackay had returned to Scotland. The United Presby-
terian Church was flourishing under the ministrations of the late
Adam Thomson, who had recently arrived to succeed Mr.
Darling, and in June, 1862, Dr. Steel arrived to take charge of
Macquarie Street Church, then vacant for nearly two years.
Both these ministers acquired at once considerable popularity and
influence, not the less for their being free from the old disturbing
elements ; but unfortunately, as some think, they united their
efforts, first in emancipating Dr. Lang from his anomalous
position, occupying the oldest church in Sydney, and having a


separate Synod of his own creation, and secondly, in bringing
about a Union between the four divisions of the Presbyterian
Church of the colony, viz., the Church of Scotland, as repre-
sented by the Synod of Australia, the Presbyterian Church of
Eastern Australia, the United Presbyterians, and Dr. Lang’s Synod
of New South Wales, an incorporation of exceedingly diverse
and heterogeneous elements, that could not be called in any proper
sense of the term a union in spirit and in sentiment and designs—
however well it may look in statistics. The accomplishment of that
union, towards which it is true that Mr. Mclntyre contributed by
the course he took, and as he afterwards acknowledged unwisely
took, had an important bearing upon the position of this Church
and congregation. Singularly enough, the preliminary union of
the Synod of Eastern Australia and Dr. Lang’s Synod, —with also
two unattached ministers, the Rev. R. S. Paterson, and the Rev.
Wm. Boag,—took place within these walls on the 18th November,
1864. That transaction at once lowered the standard of the hitherto
successful and progressive Presbyterian Church of Eastern Australia
in the eyes of the general Christian public. It was quite understood
at the time that the Synod of Australia would on no account take
into their body Dr. Lang and his Synod, but it was intimated that if
the Synod of Eastern Australia arranged a union with the
Synod of New South Wales, its changed condition would not be
held as a bar to the general union already agreed to between the
three legitimate Churches. At this point the agreed union was
felt by a part of the Synod of Eastern Australia to be as yet
premature, and that by the avowal of the uniting parties that
they still held the same separate views which they had hitherto
held, it was manifest the proposed union was nothing more than
an incorporation of discordant elements, which could hardly com-
mand the respect or the affections of any who really cared for
their principles. Thus it happened that at the last moment, the
Revs. Wm. Mclntyre, S. F. MacKenzie, J. McCulloch, C. R.
Greig, and J. L. McSkimming, refused to abandon their position as
a distinct Church. The Rev. W. S. Donald, then officiating at
Newtown, declined a call to Chalmers’ Church, and subsequently
cast in his lot with the Synod of Eastern Australia, as also the
Rev. Allan Mclntyre, of the Manning River.
From the date of this disruption of the Synod of Eastern
Australia, (1864), the congregation of St. George’s Church acquired
a new character, having thenceforward a distinct testimony to
maintain in favor of unity of spirit, without compromise of prin-
ciple,—in favor of purity of doctrine and simplicity of worship.
Some families saw their way to leave forthwith, and join the
Union Church, and some saw their way to the opposite course,
and thus the composition of the congregation was in some measure
altered, and has since been altering in the same direction, —it is


hoped for the greater advantage of the cause of true religion in
the land by the increasing numbers that see and feel the impor-
tance of faithfulness to principle, and to the sacred trust which is
imposed upon all who receive the truth in the love of it.
* * * *
Thus no important change occurred in the congregation, either
numerically or financially, during the remaining years of Mr.
Mclntyre’s ministry, till his death in 1870.
The correspondence that ensued with friends in Scotland, and
elsewhere, as to procuring a successor, finally failed, after many
tantalizing hopes were raised as to one and another suitable
minister being found willing to come. Many causes could be
assigned for this, but probably the chief might be found in the
active misrepresentations sent home from the Union Church here,
whose interests were strongly upheld by the leading members of
the Colonial Committee of the Free Church.
At length, in 1872, the congregation were led to invite the
present pastor, then minister of the first Church at Dunedin,
New Zealand, and after the usual preliminaries, the Rev. George
Sutherland was inducted into the charge of the congregation on
the 4th November, 1872, since which date the congregation has
seen considerable further changes, but has steadily increased,
until it has fully quadrupled its membership, notwithstanding
the many confident predictions of an early collapse into the Union
Church, so soon as Mr. Mclntyre should be removed by death.
The Cost of the Church and the Liquidation of the Debt.
This history would not be complete without a few figures and
explanations. The accounts shew that the first year of Dr.
Mackay’s ministry closed with a debt of £460, and that from
May, 1857, to the opening of the Church* on 9th March, 1860, the
debt for the current expenses of the congregation had increased
to £1,147, the receipts for the whole period being £2,383, and
the expenditure £3,530. At the same date the expenditure
incurred in connection with the building of the Church had
reached the enormous sum of £14,697, which was expended thus—

officiated during part of Dr. Mackay’s absence in Europe, in 1859,
on a mission to raise £2OOO towards the building fund. The
produce of his effort was only £Bl6, however, or deducting the
whole expense of his visit, a net sum of £246, which was hardly
worth the time and labour involved in it. The Rev. P. Simpson
was peculiarly successful as a missionary, and before the Church
was finished had the Session-house frequently filled with blind
and other people, which he and his excellent wife succeeded in
collecting to hear the glad tidings of salvation. At the termina-
tion of his engagement an effort was made by friends unconnected
with St. George’s, to secure him as a city missionary, and a stipend
of £3OO was guaranteed to him, but from the peculiar state of the
ecclesiastical atmosphere at the time, he considered it preferable
to accept a call to a congregation at Portland, on the south coast
of Victoria.
Of the total cost of the building, £4168 only had been con-
tributed, showing a debt on the Building account of £10,429, or
a total debt at the opening of the Church of £11,576. This was
covered at the time in the following way, viz :
Mortgage on the building ... ... . £6,500
Draft on cash credit with the E.S. and A.C. Bank 1,721
Bills of Committee of Management ... ... 800
Advances by Treasurer ... ... ... 747
Unpaid accounts ... ... .... 1,808
£11,576
From the opening of the Church to Dr. Mackay’s resignation,
or about fourteen months after, the receipts were £9Bl, and the
expenses £1,982, thus adding £l,OOO to the general debt; but
as a set off to this a visit of Dr. Mackay to Victoria produced
about £4OO in reduction of the Building debt, but leaving the
total at over £12,000.
The effort made under the Synod’s minute, already referred to,
seems to have produced the following subscriptions, as recorded in
the accounts, viz :
William Manson ... ... ... £1,500
James Dickson ... ... ... 1,000
Buyers & Learmonth (off their account) ... 600
Bev. Wm. Mclntyre ... ... ... 500
J. L. Sherriff... ... ... .. 250

£4,457


Notwithstanding this relief, and the cessation of the annual
charge of £6OO for a minister’s stipend, a debt of £1,500 was
still left floating, and of course bearing heavy interest. In
January, 1863, the Deacons’ Court reported that sum as subscribed
for, payable over a period of two years, but the growing interest
on Bank overdrafts, and the discount on bills which had to be
repeatedly renewed, seems to have absorbed nearly all the
advantages offered by those subscriptions, for in the following year,
1864, the debt was reported as still £7,200, and an annual deficit
in income of £264.
On the Ist August, 1864, Mr. Darvall’s mortgage of £6,500
had to be met. Mrs. Burdekin agreed to take a mortgage for
£5OOO, at 8 per cent. Mr. Mclntyre and Mr. Manson each
advanced £5OO by Bills, and £465 was subscribed in cash, as
follows:
Rev. Wm. Mclntyre ... ... £137 10 0
Mr. W. Manson ... ... ... 137 10 0
Mr. Wm. Buyers ... ... ... 50 0 0
Mr. Robert Campbell ... ... 50 0 0
Mr. Wm. Nash .. ... ... 50 0 0

Mr. Isaac Stevenson ... ... 5 0 0
Mr. J. McDonald ... ... ... 5 0 0
Mr. J. B. Darvall ... ... ... 5 0 0
£465 0 0
The next difficulty occurred early in 1866, when the Oriental
Bank called up the cash credit with their Bank, then standing at
£1459 7s. 3d. This was discharged by Bills given by
Rev. Wm. Mclntyre ... ... ... £922 8 9
William Manson ... ... ... 319 9 10
Robert Campbell ... ... ... 217 8 8
£1,459 7 3
The floating debt being now £2500, an effort was made to
get it subscribed for. A list was headed
Rev. Wm. Mclntyre ... ... ... £750
William Manson ... ... ... ... 750
Robert Campbell ... ... ... ... 100
And twenty-two other subscribers were obtained for a total of
£221 11s., mostly for small sums payable in monthly instalments.
The effort therefore did not cover the whole debt, and thus the
quarterly struggle to pay the interest on the mortgage continued,
Mr. Mclntyre, Mr. Manson, and Mr. Robert Campbell, being
the principal sufferers or contributors.
The death of Mr. Manson, in February, 1868, deprived the
congregation of their best helper in their monetary difficulties,
but he provided by his will for liquidating one moiety of the
mortgage or £2500, provided the minister and the congregation


subscribed the remainder, also £IOOO in trust, to provide an
annual sum of £SO towards the stipend of the minister of this
Church.
In July, 1870, the congregation suffered a further and more
severe loss, by the death of Mr. Mclntyre, whose liberality, along
with Mr. Manson’s, had mainly contributed to keep them afloat
for about eight years. The debt then was little more than the
mortgage, but no interest could be paid beyond the Ist August,
1870. Thus, on the 21st January, 1873, shortly after Mr.
Sutherland had fairly begun his ministry, the mortgage debt had
been increased by the addition of years interest to £5850.
Mrs. Mclntyre having died about the same time, also most
liberally bequeathed ,£lOOO towards the debt; thus, with Mr.
Manson’s legacy, £3500 were provided out of the £5850 due.
There was also available the value of an allotment of land in
Harrington Street, granted by the Government as a site. As these
assets, however, could not be immediately realised, the interest
was going on at the rate of £4OO a year, and creating still an
annual deficit.
Early in 1873, however, a reduction in the rate of interest
from 8 to 6|- per cent, was effected by a transfer of the mortgage to
the Hon. John Frazer, on condition that the whole mortgage and
interest he paid off by the end of 1874, with liberty to reduce by
instalments as funds might be raised. The land was soon after-
wards sold, and realized about £SOO, which was at once paid over;
and in February, 1874, a further sum of over £SOO (specially
collected by Mr. Sutherland, the pastor, and Mr. Jas. Ewan),
was paid off the mortgage.
It was found impracticable to fulfil the engagement to Mr.
Frazer, or even to keep the interest paid. Thus it happened that
on the Ist February, 1875, upwards of £4OO was due for interest,
and there was no alternative but to obtain the amount in advance
on a cash credit. The executors of Mr. Manson’s will were firm
against paying his bequest, except on the mortgage being absolutely
cancelled and the building entirely freed from all liability.
After paying up the interest, the mortgage debt was reduced in
all to £4,910 11s. The problem was how to raise £2410 11s.
to hand to Mr. Frazer, and so claim the Manson bequest for the
remainder. After numerous and anxious discussions at the
Deacons’ Court, as well as correspondence with Mr. Manson’s
executors and others, the way was at length made clear. With
the co-operation of the Rev. D. K. Mclntyre, Mrs. Mclntyre’s
executor, in assuring the legacy of £IOOO as soon as payable; a
cash credit for £I,OOO on the personal security of the Trustees
and office bearers jointly and severally was obtained at 9 per cent,
from the City Bank. Mr. Sutherland, the Pastor, informed the
Deacons’ Court that he had waited on the Hon. John Frazer,


who was both mortgagee and executor of Mr. Manson’s will, and
found him most willing to aid the Deacons’ Court in their efforts.
Indeed, without his considerateness and kind co-operation, it
would have been an exceedingly hard task to have overcome the
difficulties which arose at almost every turn. Mr. Frazer most
handsomely promised Mr. Sutherland a second subscription of
£SO towards the sum required, and further agreed, at his request,
to accept a promissory note at four months date for £2OO, if
signed by four persons belonging to the congregation, and also
intimated to him that on his receiving the balance of the mortgage
over Mr. Manson’s bequest, and interest to date of discharge, that
bequest should at once be made available. The Moderator of the
Deacons’ Court had also obtained promises from members of the
congregation and others, to take up debentures of three years
currency, at 6 per cent., to the amount of £450, while another
member, Mr. E. A. Rennie, had secured in the same way £250,
making in all the amount of £7OO. The Court had also a con-
tingent promise of a subscription of £IOO from the Rev. D. K.
Mclntyre.
On the 15th April, 1875, the Deacons’ Court, at a special
meeting, found that they had actually on hand or available, what
would meet the demand for £4910 11s., the whole sum required,
excepting £IOO, which was expected next day. It was then
agreed that a deputation should the next day wait on Mr. Frazer,
consisting of the moderator, and Messrs. E. A. Rennie, Wm.
Halley, and Joseph Knox, for the settlement of the mortgage and
the legacy. At the last moment an unexpected difficulty arose
from not obtaining the £IOO that had been anticipated. In this
emergency, Mr. Halley, one of the deputation, came most generously
to the rescue, and gave his own cheque for the £IOO, on condition
of his being recouped out of the first subscriptions to be collected.
The deputation then completed their mission, signed the pro-
missory note of £2OO in favor of Mr. Frazer, and obtained a
discharge in full for £4910 11s. In the good providence of
God, it happened that soon after, a zealous Christian lady, since
deceased, Mrs. Connor, canvassed the Clarence River district for
contributions towards the debt on St. George’s Church, and
remitted to the treasurer in all no less than £ll6 12s. 7d.; and
thus the Deacons’ Court were enabled to repay Mr. Halley’s
opportune advance very soon after.
It will be seen that the final settlement was not effected without
very great difficulty and tantalizing delays, involving continual
expense. After all there had to be left a floating debt of upwards
of £lOOO. This was, however, gradually reduced, and finally
subscribed for and paid between the 16th April, 1875, and the
31st December, 1879, besides an extra expense of some £l5O for
renovating the interior and the roof of the Church.


During the seven years, 1873 to 1879, the debt had augmented
from £5850 to £6231 15s. 10d., and was finally disposed of by
Mr. Manson’s legacy ... ... £2,500 0 0
Mrs. Mclntyre’s legacy ... ... 1,000 0 0
Sale of land ... ... ... 484 18 7
Contributions, 1873 to 1879 ... ... 2,246 17 3
£6,231 15 10
The whole expenditure from 1856 to 1872 was for
Building account ... ... ... £14,697 8 10
Current expenses, inclusive of interest ... 13,465 15 0
£28,163 3 10
While the whole income during the same period was: —
Subscriptions to Building Fund, inclusive
of £1465 towards the mortgage
already mentioned ... ... 10,674 3 8
Ordinary income from seat rents, collections, &c. 9,470 1 10
Special contributions towards the liquid-
ation of cash credits, by Messrs.
Wm. Mclntyre, W. Manson, and
Robt. Campbell ... ... 2,180 14 1
£22,324 19 7
Balance of Debt, 31st December, 1872 ... £5,838 4 3
An analysis of these figures shows that if no interest had
been incurred for borrowed money, the ordinary income during
Mr. Mclntyre’s pastorate would have allowed him a stipend of
£4OO a year during the whole of his eight years’ gratuitous
ministry.
For the seven subsequent years of Mr. Sutherland’s ministry,
1873 to 1879, the income was in all £4,553 ss. 9d.; and, exclusive
of interest, the expenditure was £3,778 3s. Id., showing a
balance of £775 2s. Bd., and showing thereby that but for the
interest the income would have allowed £lOO a year for rent of a
manse, as contemplated when the minister was called.
It is startling to find that out of a total expenditure of
£31,941 from 1856 to 1879, no less a sum than £9,318 was consumed
in paying interest, —a lesson that should not he lost on those who
contemplate the erection of churches with limited resources. The
prosperous exit from these long continued difficulties called forth
profound and sincere thanksgiving to Almighty God, the author
of all our mercies. There are no figures, however, by which to
measure the grace or the displeasure of God towards the worship-
pers within these walls during all these past twenty-three years.
For the days to come it must not be expected that the congregation
can be free from the ordinary causes of weakness through the infirm-
ities of human nature, and although freed from a long and crushing


burden of debt, it can never be free from obligation to give heed
to the apostolic injunction, to “ owe no man anything, but love one
another” —“to provoke unto love and to good works.” In such
a spirit we may hope to command the respect, the sympathy, and
the co-operation of the general family of God outside our own
borders; to maintain the standard of our Presbyterian reading of
Christian doctrine, practice, and government; exerting thus a
strong and salutary influence on our neighbours, and lastly by a
cheerful, liberal, and sustained support of our home pastors
and teachers, and foreign missionary agencies, we may confidently
expect the Divine blessing on the congregation as a whole, and on
each family and individual apart, and so prove the Lord as to
the fulfilling of His gracious promises in pouring out a blessing
until there shall not be room to receive it.

St. George's Mutual Improvement Association.
—The annual meeting of the Mutual Improvement Asso-
ciation in connection with St. George’s Presbyterian
Church, Castlereagh-street, was held on Tuesday evening, in
the church. The chair was occupied by the Rev. Dr.
Geadie, from Aneiteum, and the attendance was numerous,
the building being conveniently filled. The Rev. Mr.
MTntyre commenced the proceedings by prayer, after
which the chairman made a few remarks on the objects of
the meeting, and called upon Mr. M. M. Campbell to read
the annual'report. That gentleman said that he now took
upon him the duties of their secretary, Mr. R. M.
M'Bonald, as he had lately been suffering from ill health,
of which he had not yet been able to get perfectly rid.
The report, which was the fifth annual one, showed that
from the establishment of the association, it had been
favoured with increased prosperity in all the_ matters in con-
nection therewith wherein prosperity was desirable, although
in the commencement they had met with some difficulties.
Committee meetings had been equally well attended
with the others. None of the meetings of the year had to
be adjourned for want of a quorum, and considerable vital-
ity was imparted to the proceedings on the evenings
on which the members met by the presence of a number of
ladies. . From the date of inauguration the members had
gradually continued to increase, and they were now eighty-
five in number. The president of the association (the
Rev. Mr. MTntyre), by his weekly presence at their meet-
ings, had conduced greatly to their success. For the pur-
poses of a library, a vote of £lO had been received from the
funds, which had been and would be supplemented by sub-
scriptions. It appeared trom the report that the various
classes for discussion, &c., had been very successful, and
that numerous important questions had been debated, to
the great benefit of those who took part therein. They hid
tried in vain to get lectures given by gentlemen outside of the
association, but three lectures had been delivered by mem-
bers—two on* “ Phrenology,” and one on the “ Life of Mr.
Gough, the Temperance'lecturer'.” A large number of
essays on various subjects had been read by members, and
many readings and recitations had been given. A class for
psalmody had' been established, under the leadership of
Mr. Spence, but somehow or other the attendance had lately
slightly diminished. The secretary pro tern, also read the
treasurer’s report, which showed a balance in hand of £l6
Is, Mr. John M'Denald, jun., moved the adoption of the
report, and, in so doing, said that although he had been
connected with half-a-dozen kindred societies in Sydney,
he had never seen one so well conducted. Mr. E. K.
MTntyre seconded the resolution in appropriate terms, and
it was put to the meeting and carried. After the rev.
president had addressed the meeting on Mutual Improve-
ment Societies as a means of self-improvement, Mr.
Robert Campbell moved a vote of thanks in his favour
for the interest he had evinced in the working of the_ asso-
ciation, trusting, as he did so, that he (the president)
might soon be restored to health. The motion, after being
seconded by Mr. J. G. Wilson, was unanimously carried.
On the motion, of Mr. Rennie, seconded by Mr. M. M.
Campbell, a vote of thanks was awarded to the chairman
of the evening, Dr. Geddie, who related some of his mis-
sionary experience of the New Hebrides, and the msetisg
was brought to a close with the Penedicti9B»
