The Battlefields of Anzac
A deeply interesting and historical series of views depi&ing the heroism of our gallant
Anzac boys on the field of battle
By THE WAR CORRESPONDENT OF THE "AGE"
AN APPRECIATION
Through the courtesy of the Commander-
in - Chief of the Dardanelles Expedition,
General Sir lan Hamilton, I, as the repre-
sentative of the Melbourne "Age" with the
Expeditionary Forces from Australasia, was
permitted to visit Anzac front and the scene
of operations on Gallipoli. Realising that the
narratives and descriptions of the trench life
and battlefields would be brought more
vividly before the public mind, I set about
collecting views. Many soldiers gladly gave me
what assistance they could, and to these men
I am deeply grateful, and tender my thanks.

Y the fame of her army, Australasia won in a day, a position which a century of peace could not have
brought her. The 25th April, 1915, will ever be recorded as the day on which she became a nation—
the nation of the Southern Seas. Whatever were the results of the Gallipoli campaign, whatever the criticism
offered as to its commencement, continuance, and final abandonment, the deeds of the Australasian army
there will stand out as one of the most stirring chapters in the great war.
Sunday, 25th April, Midnight. The moon dropping behind the islands of Mudros, Imbros, and Symothrace in the
murky JEgean ; the shore line of Gallipoli fading to an indefinite violet. Just between the last hours of the night and
dawn —the very stillest hours they have been called—crept along the fleet of transports. On the decks the Australasians
waited the signal that would release them on the " job" (as they termed it) that they had come out to do. Battleships,
cruisers, destroyers, pinnaces, trawlers, and scores of smaller craft were with that fleet ready to ferry the men to the
shore —an entrenched, forbidding shore. And as they went, so did the British and French troops, too, in other ships,
steam forth down to Cape Helles and Kum Kale (at the very entrance to the Dardanelles) to play their part in the
great landing operation directed by General Sir lan Hamilton.
" Impshee Yallah," shouted the Australasians as the first boat's nose grated on the shingly shore—a sort of challenge
for the Turks to get out —and yelling other Egyptian words, calling to one another, the army landed in the face of
a searching machine-gun fire. What few hundred Turks resisted soon fled over the hills, hotly pursued by the 3rd
Infantry Brigade under Brigadier-General Sinclair Maclagan. Up the slopes of holly-covered hills, several hundred feet
high, down into a valley—the Valley of the Shadow of Death as it was first called —and up a further slope to the
top of the second ridge, the troops charged; while the enemy, adjusting their artillery, dropped shrapnel up and down
the gorge with fearful effect. Brigade followed brigade over the hills and stormed the second and third ridges, and
cleared them and swept the Turks almost back to their camp at Koadjere. For three days the battle raged, and the
Australasians hung on. They kept what they had won (and a bit more as well), straightening out their line; and they
paid. For days there was calm. On 19th-20th May, they killed 4,000 Turks who tried to "push the Australasians into
the sea"—l am giving you the words of the Turkish leader, General Liman Sanders. The enemy had to sue for an
armistice to bury their dead. During June and July, the war on the peninsula became a trench fight, the hills echoing
with the everlasting " psinging" of the bullets as they sped overhead and dropped thousands of yards away in the sea
or just down on the cove, and the thumping and thunder of bombs and shells.
Anzac changed from hills shrouded with green bushes and wildflowers to bare slopes covered with holes —" funk
holes" or dugouts—and glistening with the disused tins that caught the rays of the sun. It was like a huge mining
camp with engineers working in the gullies, sinking wells, digging tunnels, and, on the hills, setting mines. The narrow
beach became a busy cove on to which, under cover of darkness, was landed millions of rounds of ammunition, shells,

Shaded portion represents Anzac —the extended dotted line the ground gained in the August operations


stores, equipment, and all the innumerable materials of an army encamped. Soon a steady stream of men, broken by
the stress of war, wounded and sick, left the peninsula, and were placed on the white hospital ships. Men, stern and
fit, came in from gray transports and took their place in the firing line.
General Sir lan Hamilton made no error when he singled out the Divisions at Anzac to bait the Turks. He
was confident that they would hold what they had won, or die to a man. He knew that it needed but his command
to set them free to challenge the Turkish army snug behind the covered trenches; so, while the Australasians fought the
Turks for a day and a night, the Commander-in-Chief flung ashore a new army at Suvla Bay, with the intention of
attacking the heart of the Turkish position, cutting their lines of communication by land, and, in an advance,
attack their rear. Between the onslaughts of the Australasians, the New Zealanders, and Indians, and the New Army,
the Turks were to be destroyed or driven pell-mell on to the shores of the Narrows at Bogali or Maidos. The Allied
forces would then have straddled the peninsula.
This terrible battle began on 6th August, when, at a cost of 3,000 men, Australasia —represented by the Ist
Infantry Brigade under General Walker captured Lone Pine trenches from the Turks the pride and boast of
their position.
With this wedge driven into their side, the Turks, as was anticipated, quickly called up reinforcements in great
numbers to the Anzac position. After Lone Pine had been fought and won, came the attempted advance by the 6th
Infantry Brigade under Lieut.-Colonel Bennett, the sorties from Quinn's Post and Pope's Hill, and the final charge
and magnificent heroism of the Bth and 10th Light-horse, under Col. White, 400 of whom dashed boldly to glory and their fate.
On the north, beyond the heart of Anzac, the New Zealanders under General Godley, and the 4th Infantry Brigade under
Brigadier - General Monash, began the fighting in the foothills that led up to the main Sari Bair ridge; they were
sweeping the Turks before them; they gained three square miles of territory. Before the Turks could recover from
the first shock of this terrific clash of arms they were confronted by the New Army landing at Suvla Bay. Here
was a new menace on to which the Turks looked down from their high, strongly held trenches. For four days and nights
they resisted the fiercest endeavors to dislodge them from the heights. The New Zealanders won the ridge of Chunak
Bair, but, overwhelmed by the Turkish reserves now hurried up, they had to retire. Dawn and the second day
came, and yet the British troops had not been able to push inland ; they were held up in the marsh land at Suvla
Bay. Still, what the Australasians won, they kept; but the ultimate and complete success of the new plan miscarried,
owing to the delays after the new landing.
It was the last great offensive on the Peninsula. As winter storms swept Anzac it became more and more
untenable. The linking of the Turco-German forces through Bulgaria was the warning for the evacuation. Lord
Kitchener himself, after a personal visit to the lines, gave the signal.
But Anzac, be its shores deserted and the graves of the warriors untended, will remain in the minds of all
throughout the ages, to the glory of the Young Army that won its first laurels and tasted its first - fruits of bitter
victory in a feat of arms that is without parallel in the annals of warfare,
