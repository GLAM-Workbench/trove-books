and gladdened his last moments. The brave, the *n?or-
tal Nelson, had performed at sea what his noble friend had
subsequently achieved on land, and as long world
existed so long would the immortal rtetones of Trafelgin'
and Waterloo be handed down to, and be gratefully remem-
bered by the latest posterity. , .
? The memory of the immortal Nelson was drunk in
solemn silence. In proposing it the Gallant President wa�
deeply affected, in whose feelings the noble duke seemed
cordially to participate.
Sir G. Cockbum then rose, and spoke as follows .?1
bee to propose to your notice a toast which I feel sure you
will all drink with the greatest satisfaction; it is Ilw
health of the Militia of the United Kingdom.? Gentlemen,
this branch of the public service has been of the most
essential benefit to the country at large; nor aught we to
forget that towards the close of the war the militia volun-
teered their services to any part of the world. The toast
was enthusiastically received, and
Colonel Sibthorp, of the Lincolnshire Militia returned
thanks in a brief but neat speech, congratulating himself
on having had the good fortune to serve under the illustri-
ous duke during a portion of the Peninsular war.
About eleven o?clock the noble duke retired from the
festive board, accompanied by Lord Hill, Lord Ross jn,
and other distinguished guests, and, the chair having been
: vacated by Sir George Cookbum, Captain Boldcro, M.P.,
: was unanimously called to it. A few congenial souls kept
' up the merry scene till twelve o?clock, when the party
? broke up. It is impossible to close this account without
; paying a tribute of praise to the admirable arrangements
of the committee of management, to whose exertions are to
be attributed the order with which everything was con-
; ducted, and a higher compliment cannot be paid them
than the perfect approbation with which the noble duke

grand banquet to the duke op
WELLINGTON. cxisl
The arand dinner which was given by the members of
the Junior United Service Club to the Duke of W cll ?S?� n b erc
on the 13th instant, at their club-house, m Charlcs-street,
St James?s-square, was on the most magnificent scale Pre- ?
parations had been making for many days previously, and
the whole management was entrusted torfhe skill
of Mr. Gunter, ot Berkeley-square The picture of the g
gallant duke, painted expressly for the members of the club, beg
was purposely placed in the grand drawmg-room on this wiH
occasion, as well as the portraits of his heal
jesty and the immortal Nelson, which occupied a, prominent
pi ace in the centre of the room, behind the chair of the gal-
Lit President, Sir George Cockbum. Large parties of ladies, forg
friends of the members of the club, wore admitted to view teg]
the preparations during the day, and the inner a was
after they wore laid out, who expressed themselves de- (
ligiitcd with the tout ensemble. The hour of dinner was tha
fixed at half-past seven, at which time punctually the I ,
noble duke arrived in his state carriage, and was received
at the entrance hall by the committee of management, who ,
conducted his Grace to the drawing-room, where he was (
most enthusiastically received by many of us old compa-
nions in arms. The duke was soon after followed by Lord y&c
Hill, the Commander-in-Chief, Earl Rosslyn, and several ! &
other general officers. About eight o?clock dinner was up
announced, mid the chair was taken by Admiral Sir George ]jr<
Cockbum, G.C.B. On bis right was placed the noble duke,
and on his loft Lord Rosslyn. The banquet, of which 110 of j
officers partook, consisted of venison, turtle, and every be
other delicacy of the season. The tables were most ap- du
propriately ornamented with various military devices, and t)| ,
the whole presented a most interesting coup danl, winch
will be long remembered by those who were present.
Champagne, burgundy, and every other sort of wine were
provided in abundance, and the dessert was equal in splen-
dour to the dinner, consisting of the choicest pines and
other fruits of the rarest production. The duke _ was in
most excellent spirits, and seemed much to enjoy the , el]
animating scone around him. After the cloth was removed - j c
the Chairman gave ?The King,? to which other loyal toasts p 0
succeeded, which it is unnecessary to state were drank
with great applause. dh
Sir G. Cockbum then rose and said?lt is now ray gio
pleasing duty to propose a toast which I am confident you
will all drink with rapture. It is hardly necessary for me
to say that it is ? the health of our illustrious guest, the
Duke of Wellington,? whs has this day done us the ho- w

his name from his first victory in India down to that glo-
rious day on the field of Waterloo, on which lie surpassed aa
all his former exploits, and added another, and the most
brilliant, indeed, to those with which his wreathed brow ;tg
was previously entwined. When we consider the effects de
on Europe at large of that signal victory, we want words, I
indeed, to express our admiration of an achievement which I
eclipsed all his former deeds ; and which, whilst it restored da
peace to Europe, immortalised the British arms. Gen-

(From the Clonmel Advertiser.')
Among the numerowi illustrious names which adorn th�
Conservative cause, none shine more proudly conspicuous
than that which appears at the head of this article?
nor did the noble house to which it pertains ever (among
its most distinguished ancestry) number one more calcu-
lated to add to its fame, than the nobleman who at pre-
sent enjoys it. Whether we consider Lord Stanley as
the politician, the landlord, the Christian, or the gen-
tleman, we find equal ground for the profoundest senti-
ments of admiration and respect. His political career is
fraught with proof of his sagacity and high principle, and
with cutting rebuke to his former degenerate colleagues,
who (unlike his lordship) have continued in that course,
the destructive tendency of which withdrew 7 him from
their ranks, and retaining power at the expense of prin-
ciple, have fallen irretrievably in public estimation.
While his lordship considered that reform was confined
within its legitimate bounds, lie was found among its most
distinguished advocates \ but the moment that he dis-
covered the real designs of his colleagues?the moment
that he found them bent on the perversion of our civic
institutions into schools of agitation, and plundering the
revenues of our Church, he hesitated no longer in the
course to be pursued, but from being their only ornament
? and support, assumed his legitimate position, and became
the most zealous and effective of their opponents.
If Lord Stanley had no other claim on our admiration
1 and gratitude, his able and frequent castigations of the
pestiferous demagogue, wdiose charletanry is the bane of
: this unhappy country, w?ould elicit the approbation of
( every Conservative w 7 ho justly considers that the man who
, counteracts the designs of that person confers a heavy
? obligation on society. The moral courage with which
, his lordship, although a very young man, first bearded
t the lion, and the consistent intrepidity with which he has
[ continued ?unawed by his menaces, unsubdued by bis
[ smiles?his uncompromising and powerful antagonist, arc
. beyond all praise, and form a strong and [to them] wi-
} thcring contrast with the conduct of those men w T ho have
[ ?forgetful of their respectability as gentlemen, and their
: duty as public servants?entered into an unholy compact
f with the traduccrs of themselves and their order, and
merged all sense of public spirit or personal respect m
r their affection for that place of which his dear-bought sup-
. port gives them, at present, a feeble tenure.
But the catalogue of Lord Stanley?s virtues is not yet
2 full. As a landlord he has been always distinguished for
. his liberality in the county of Tipperary?however, it were
r superfluous to dilate on his merits in that capacity ; they
s too well known to require our testimony, and are fully
_ recorded in the hearts of his obliged and grateful tenantry.
We are induced to make these observations by the visit
e of the noble lord to his estates in this neighbourhood, and
- we think that amidst the monotony of fustian addresses
, and green-branch processions, with which the priests and
q the priest-ridden are constantly beslavering their idol, a
, r pleasing contrast might be afforded by a tribute from this
q great and respectable county to real merit and exalted
o- rank. The nobleman would thus have an opportunity of
paying a compliment to the ornament of his order?the*
, r Conservative would be honouring the advocate of his prin-
ciples?the farmer could pay his meed of applause to
, e the kind and benevolent landlord?and, above all, tho
j. Christian could record his testimony in favour of the zeal-
ous defender of the Church. We trust that such an op-
portunity of exhibiting Conservative gratitude and Coit-
... servative strength will not be passed over, but that his
? s lordship?s arrival in this country will be greeted by a eor-
I dial, suitable, and numerously signed address.
THE PARLIAMENTARY SESSION.
(From the Ulster Times.)
At no period during the progress of the parliamentary
session now terminated could the Conservative body of
the nation?that heart and core of the population of these
kingdoms, which comprises the religious principle, loyal
feeling, clear judgment, virtue, intelligence, property, and
industry of society?have anticipated a termination of th�
legislative year, so triumphantly favourable to their hopes-
and prayers, as that which we this day commemorate. The
records of debate afford no parallel to the victory achieved,
by Lord Lyndhurst in bis resume of the history of th�
session, his contrast of ministerial promise with minis-
terial performance, and his award of the respective share�
of responsibility incurred by the antagonist parties in th�
state, from the frustration of the ministerial policy. Th�
demonstration given by the noble and learned lord of th�
contemptible weakness and incompetcncy of the cabal wht*
now 7 affect to hold the view 7 s of government, was equalled,
only by the graceful irony, the cutting sarcasm, the calm
but irresistible stream of eloquence in which he rolled
back on the devoted heads of their authors the accusations
and invective which have been so long aimod at the Lords,
by the doting jesters of Whiggery, and the ministerial heroes
of the boudoir. The effect produced in the immediate
scene of its delivery was sufficiently attested by the convul-
sions into which it threw Lords Melbourne and Hol-
land. The latter old gentleman strove to be facetious?
has he forgotten his friend Peter Plymlcy?s description of
the melaneholious mirthfulness of a superannuated ow r l??*
Wc may remind Lord Holland that the last lingering a<e*-
complishment of a gladiator was honeste decombere ; that
the fall even of a Cajsar was decorously veiled from the
vulgar gaze; and his lordship may be assured that tho
veteran never lags so ? superfluous on the stage,? as when*
with the rheumy eyes and toothless gums of decrepitude*
he struggles to emulate the antics of Scaramouch. Th�
effect produced by the speech of Lord Lyndhurst in th�
house, however, is as nothing compared w T ith the influence
it is calculated to exercise on public opinion, out of doors.
It should be read in every cottage, and distributed in every
village throughout the empire ; because by a distinci reca-
pitulation of facts?undenied because undeniable by his
opponents?the noble lord proves the hollowmess, th�
incapacity, and the falsehood of those self-styled Reformers
who have misled a portion of the population, and who labour
to bring our fundamental institutions into contempt and
odium.
What will be the course of events during the recess ?
To judgo by the language of the ministerial press, it would
seem that the faction hope to retrieve their broken fortune�
by the seditious agitation set on foot in Ireland ; and pos-
sibly some of the scribbling slaves of the cabal may bo
plunged in an ignorance so brutish of the state of society
here, as to imagine this a winning card. Their masters aro
not so foolish. Lord Mulgravc knows better. The Viscount
Morpeth is not so deluded. Lieutenant Drummond cal-
culates the drift of public opinion on less fallacious data.
These worthies see?and, dissembling, rejoice to sec?that
the occupation of the mendicant is gone ; that the better
order of those who were once his dupes, are alive to hia
knavery and his impostures ; that in spite of the influence
of one or two egregious geese, trained as decoys, the Ge-
neral Association is a general failure ; and that the time is
fast approaching when this mischievous maniac, who has so
long distracted the peace of Ireland, will find u none so
poor to do him reverence.? We conclude by congra-
tulating the Conservatives of the empire on the mode in
which the session has come to a conclusion. Better dayat
are dawning.

and natural protector.
The aide- man?s clerk suggested that the worthy alderman
was bound to act under the new law.
Alderman Farebrother said he had a high respect for the
judgment of that gentleman; but in this case he would not
give up his opinion unless the subject were carried into the
superior courts. As to the act itself, it was tiie greatest piece
of legal inhumanity which had ever been framed.
The matter was terminated by a summons being issued for
the attendance of the putative father.
Union-halt.?The Case of Maria Harvey
Maria Harvey, the woman who was charged, a few days
ago, with having obtained the sum of 5/. from a young man
named Dawes, under false representations, by an attempt to
make him believe that she was his mother, was brought up
for re-examination on the charge. The prisoner said that
she acknowledged now that she had practised the imposition
of attempting to make young Dawes believe that she was his
mother in consequence of her unfortunate situation, and that
it was her intention to have paid him back whatever money
he might have thought proper to advance for her defence
when she was acquitted. She was then remanded again until
Monday.
Hatton-gabden. ?On Friday, between 60 and 70 in-
habitants of the parish ot St. Andrew, Holborn, appeared
before Messrs. Benett and Laing to explain why they had
not paid up the poor-rates duo from them at -M idsummer
last.
It appeared that the proceedings were taken by the
?verseers under the direction of the Poor-law Commission-
ers, who have wrested the power formerly possessed by
those parish officers, of excusing defaulters of parochial
rates, out of their hands, and transferred it to the police
magistrates of the district. A justice of the peace, how-
ever, cannot do so on the ? bare assertion ? of the party
summoned, for he is strictly enjoined, whenever poverty is
pleaded in excuse for nonpayment, to examine witnesses
on oath, and linless it can be shown that such individual
is actually in that awful predicament, namely, without the
means of providing himself or herself with the common
necessaries of life, tiie favour solicited is on no account
to he granted.
In most instances orders to pay in fourteen days were
made, and a few cases of extreme distress were "ordered
to stand over, that the necessary proof might be ob-
tained.
Marlborough-street. ?On Friday a man named John
Snoke was brought to this office, charged by the parish
officers of St. George?s, Hanover-square, witli neglecting
to maintain two children, the one aged three years, and the
other two months, whereby they had become chargeable to
that parish.
It appeared that the man Snoke had separated from his
wife about five years since, and she had gone to live with
another man, with whom she continued to cohabit until a
short time since, when he was taken up on a charge of
forgery, upon which he was subsequently convicted and
sentenced to transportation. During the period they
eoliabited together the woman had one child, and while li*
was in custody she was delivered of another infant, but
upon hearing of the sentence upon her paramour, it had
such an effect upon her that she died almost immediately
afterwards. The woman was at that time residing in St.
George?s, and the children being thus left complctely
destitute, the parish took up the case as one for casual re-
lief, and upon further inquiry the above facts were ascer-
tained, and notice was given to Snoke that lie was liable
for the maintenance of the children in question, but lie re-
fused tp have any tiling to do with them, alleging that it was
impossible the children could be his, as his wife had been
separated from him for five years.
Mr. Broomhead, tiie assistant overseer of St. George?s
parish, stated, that the man Snoke now declared that he
was unable to support the children, and therefore it was
the intention of St. George?s parish to pass them with him
to his settlement, the parish of Chelsea, as under the New

"v 61 After long and animated debates on the conclusum of the
Diet with regard to foreign refugees, the Grand Council of this
? canton has to-day come to the following resolutions by a very
great majorityThe deputy from Vaud to the Diet shall
' t declare?1. That the Canton of Vaud does not ratify the
f' conclusum of August 11, proposed by the Diet on the
? subject of refugees; that, considering Art. 8. of the lede-

? necessary for maintaining the security ot Switzerland hot i
, ? at home and abroad, it votes that no conclusum shall be
come to iu this matter in the form of a general measure;

? of sending out of its territories all such refugees, who, by
Z acts established by proof, have compromised either the rater-
' nal safety or tranquillity of Switzerland, or its neutrality or
J? international relations?2. The Deputy is authorised to join

any canton which may refuse to expel from its territory any

War department. The new Cortes, it was thought,
would meet on the 25th of October next. M. Moreno,
who was appointed, on the 16th, Minister of Marine,
ad interim, had refused the appointment, and Gene-
ral Camha has since, by a royal decree, been intrusted
with the War and Navy departments. All the under-
secretaries and clerks of the late administration have
sent in their resignations. Isturitz and Galiano are
understood to have succeeded in making their escape,
and are now upon the road to France. On the 21st

Portuguese papers to the 18th have arrived, from
which we learn that a Council of State was held at
Cintra a few days previously, at which the Queen
presided, to consider the propriety of recalling the
Portuguese troops from Spain, in order to defend the
country against any incursion of the Carlists, and to
overawe any Miguelites who might be disposed to take
advantage of such movement. ?1 he question, how- J
ever, was disposed of in the negative, the measure being-
deemed unnecessary, in consequence of General Gomez j
having withdrawn from Galicia. All was tranquil in j
Lisbon when the accounts came away. The treasury is
again empt^ 1 , notwithstanding the sale of the Lezi- j
rias. This property has not fetched anything near
what was calculated upon. Eleven millions sterling
was the estimated sura ; but it has produced no more
than 200 contos, or about 48,0001., and the best of
the property is sold. Emigration continues to agi eat
extent.
An article in a German paper announces that a
Congress is about to be held at a Bohemian watering
place, to take into consideration the state ot aflaiis
inSpain. Some such conference must inevitably
take place. The affairs of Cracow again excite the
attention of the ? protecting ? Powers. In Sweden
a controversy of some bitterness exists, as to the
proceedings of the Norwegian Storthing, the next
meeting of which promises to be stormy.
The Exchange upon London at Hamburgh on the

We are told that there is ? nothing more easy than a ?
to imagine cases of hardship which may arise, and
to invent supposed circumstances in which an in-
flexible adherence to the regulations of the Poor-
law Commissioners would work considerable injury.
This proposition it is not our business to dispute. 0 ?
We freely admit the perfect facility of imagining j*
cases of hardship, as produced by a system, the w
obvious tendency of which is to produce such i> ;
cases. It is for our adversaries to show that L
they must be imaginary. This, however, can
be shown only by the exhibition of some "
corrective principle in the system, adequate to ci
counteract its cruel tendency. We can detect no �
such corrective principle in the New Poor-law Bill, r
we have seen none such suggested, and as imagination j<
has been referred to, we fairly own that we can h
imagine none such, short of an essential change in c
the whole code.
Observing, by the way, that a multitude of cases,
more numerous than under the circumstances we a
could have anticipated, a multitude of cases proved
not to be imaginary, and exceeding in rigour, peihaps, s
anything that imagination could suggest, have been
laid before the public, we proceed to ask, what is ,
the guarantee against the abusive operation ofasys- t
tem which the very acknowledgment made in the ?
. passage with which we set out confesses to be liable ,
to great abuse ? It is a true saying, that one-halt
of the world does know not how the other half
lives ? and the unregarded division all will admit
; to comprehend the very poor. This obscure seclu- ,
j sion from the observation of their fellow-men is
- the great cause of the continued suffering of the des-
r titute, depriving them of that protection from
1 public opinion by which all others are protected in
s their liberties and rights. We care very little for
s the machinery of any law the working of winch must
e pass under the constant observation of a tolerably
1 numerous body of Englishmen, and which, there-
-4 fore must directly or indirectly receive its bias from
4 English feeling. Such a law, however construed m
? the first instance, will soon settle into a fair, honest,
? and kindly rule. Improvident it may be on tile ge-
?s nerous side ; hut, in its very improvidence, affording
e a moral compensation, ultimately convertible into
? e national wealth and happiness, equivalent to
y loss of any kind that such improvidence may oc-
,t C asion. Such was the case of the old system of poor-
d laws. The new system is not worked by public
it opinion; and if its tendencies he to produce cases of
1- hardship, neither this sovereign corrective, nor any
>u ot her corrective that we can conceive, is available to
?u c heck that tendency. Let it he remembered who
at are, necessarily, the sufferers in such cases ?the very
Iy poorest of the poor?the most obscure among the
66 neglected! Can such hope for consideration, in
? S offering their individual complaints through the pre��,
or through parliament, or will the most meritorious
? of them possess sufficient courage and assurance to
as publish their misery and wrongs in an appeal to pub-
lic opinion ? Poverty, which, as the satirist tells us
m exposed men to ridicule, and contempt, and outrage,
ed among the not very industrious Romans, is by the
n- mass of hard-working Englishmen regarded as
m almost a disgraceful crime ?so regarded fully
th to this extent, that most men of English feel-
;s. ing would rather suffer the last degree of afflic-
, a tion and wrong, than make proclamation of their
? oiiigapinc.
