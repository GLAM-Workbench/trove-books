That whereas in terms of the State Aid Distribution
Act now in force in the Colony, any one of the exist-
ing Incumbents of this Church translated by the
Presbytery from his present charge to a new congre-
gation calling him is entitled to take with him the
whole of the Government Salary as Minister of the
new congregation, leaving the congregation he is re-
moved from without any assistance towards the main-
tenance of a successor. And whereas the Presbytery
have reason to believe that the provision was intro-
duced into the Act in consequence of a statement erro-
neous, hut publicly and persistently made that in two
or three instances, Ministers of this Church are with-
out adherents or without such a number of adherents
.as can he termed a congregation. And whereas the
provisions of the Act have been construed as giving to
the Presbytery a right to translate with the whole
Salary in every case, as well where a Minister has a
good congregation as where he may have little or
none, And whereas the Constitution of the Church
gives no power to a Presbytery by any Act or Deed
of theirs direct or inferentially to deprive a congrega-
tion of any part of the Minister?s Stipend from what-
ever source derived. Therefore it hath seemed fit to
the Presbytery to declare, and they hereby announce
and declare that it is incompetent for them in the pre-
sent circumstances of the Church, as respects the
Salaries of Ministers, to translate any Minister hav-
ing a congregation whose congregation is determin-
edly opposed to his translation. Meeting of Pres-
bytery, November the 4th, 1863.
