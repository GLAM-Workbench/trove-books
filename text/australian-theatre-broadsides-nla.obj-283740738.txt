To be in a “ brown study ” is said to

A “ nincompoop ” was originally a per-
son of unsound mind (non compos men-
tis), and an “ assassin ” a member of the
sect of the “ Assassins ” (founded by
Hassen ben Sabah in 1090). This order
derived its name either from that of its
founder or from that of the intoxicating
drug (haschisch), which was usually taken
by those selected to carry out his com-
mands in the way of “ removing ” any
person or persons obnoxious to him.

THIS STRONG, TRUE, TESTIMONY FROM A
COLONIST W*LL CONVINCE YOU.
Mr. EDWARD MacMANUS, the popular proprietor of the Rourke Street Turkish
Baths, Melbourne, which are under the distinguished patronage of Lord and Lady
Brassey, writes to us as follows ;
“ For about fifteen years I have suffered extreme
agony from severe headache and loss of sleep. I
was in such a condition that I could hardly tear
being spoken to while suffering from these attacks,
and frequently at night time I have risen from my
bed and sought for some spot where there was no
noise. I used to walk away into some park to
try and get quietness, as any noise or bustle would
increase the pains in my head. I consulted several
medical men ; they prescribed for me, but I received
no permanent relief from their treatment. I also
tried many patent medicines, without effect.
About four months ago, when I was feefing
thoroughfy knocked out, several well-known
' citizens who come here for turkish baths, knowing
,my terrible condition, recommended me to try Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People. I did so, and
after taking four boxes, I felt an undoubted im-
provement. Tins increased as I continued with the medic ine, and by the time I had
used ten boxes I was thoroughly and completely cured of all my distressing ailments.
I think this was magnificently satisfactorj', for my cure, after all, only cost a
comparately few shillings, whilst my troubles had afflicted me for the fearful peiiod
of fifteen years. Every headache has now vanished, and I have the greatly relished
happiness of sleeping undisturbed, and waking up —even in the hottest weather —
thoroughly refreshed every morning.
“ I have been conducting the baths for eight years, and whilst work was previously
a trouble, it is now really a pleasure. lam certain that my cure is permanent, and
1 have the greatest satisfaction in earnestly Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
to my friends and clients, and to the public genera ly.”

It is calculated that the aggregat
annual income of the working-classes of the
United Kingdom is about £300,000,000.
Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby.”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
chief models were his wife and daughters.
Uncle Silas (in art gallery) : “ Giminy
crockets, Maria, but them artists is old
fellers!” Aunt, Maria: “How do you
know ? ” Uncle Silas : “ Why, look at
that air picter. It’s signed ‘ Jones, ’97.’”
“This is an insult,” declared the
prisoner in the police court. “ What do
you mean, sir,” roared the magistrate.
“ I’m a professional cyclist, holding
several long-disiance records, your honor,
and here I’m charged with scorching at
the rate of eight miles an hour.’
Madame Bernhardt will not exercise,
and hates fruit, unless she happens to feel
in a mood for eating it, and still she has
a handsome head of hair, which some of
the doctors say is quite remarkable, in
view 4 of the fact that fruit and exercise
make beautiful hair. She makes her hair
grow winter and summer by exposing it.
For several hours a day it hangs down her
back, with (he air blowing through it and
the sun touching it. Her theory is that
wherever the hairpins touch the hair it
will be dull and jglossless.
I— Scribbler —“Yes, I have written a large
number of poems, but I do not propose
having them published until after rav
death.” Chorus of friends (raising their
glasses) “ Hero’s long life to you,
Scribbler.”
Her Mother—“ Edith, don’t you think
you are getting too old to play with little
boys ? ” Edith (aged seven) —“ No,
mamma; the older I get the better I like
them.”
“ Do you hear that whining in the next
room ? ” “ Yes ; who is it ? ” “ That’s
the football rusher who got off those
manly utterances at the end of the game ;
his wife is rubbing his lame shoulder.”
A man recently drank a pint of yeast

He —“Just think of it. They say

There are two violet farms in the
United States, both managed entirely by
women.
Hitherto Patient Boarder “ Mrs.
Starvem, I can stand having hash every
day in the week, but when on Sunday you
put raisins in it and call it mince pie, I
draw the line.”
The dear, dear girls,” exclaimed Mrs.
Pawkins, looking at her fashionable
daughters enthusiastically. “ Yes, the
dear, dear girl,” muttered Mr. Pawkins
despondently.
At the Party. —Mr. Boresley (amateur
hypnotist) —“Now, Miss Spicer, I want
you for a moment to concentrate your
mind upon absolutely nothing.” Miss
Spicer —“Would it make much difference
if I concentrated it upon you, Mr.
Boresley ? ”
‘ Encouragement. —Her Papa—“ Has
my daughter given you any encourage-
ment, sir I ” Mr. Loveday—“ Well—er
yes. She said you were an awfully
generous parent.”
Bot or Girl? —Wife (reading a letter
from a distant friend) —“How strange
Blfrida doesn’t say whether her baby is
a boy or girl. But she states it’s already
jegianing to talk.” Husband —“ Ob,
well, Ishat decides it; it’s a girl, of course.”
Teacher—“ Where do the Arabs live I M
Boy—“In the desert.” Teacher —“What
do they call those pious men who flee to
the desert ? ” Boy—“ Deserters.”
Culture is dangerous when it roaches
the point of taking a woman’s mind of?
the thing she has in the oven.
Lost Child (to policeman)—'“Please,
sir, have you seen a man without a little
boy? ’Cause if you lave, I’s that littl
boy.”
Fishmonger (to thrifty housewife)
“ Fish is dear, mum. Hit’s a-gettin’ worry

An impecunious Irishman said he liked

A country clergyman recently officiated
for a brother clergyman. Being anxious
to know what impression he had made
ho asked the clerk : “ Was my discourse
too long?” “No; but it was long
enough.” “ I am glad of that; for to
tell you the truth, the other day, as I
was getting this sermon ready, rny dog
destroyed four or five pages, and, clerk,
that made it much shorter.” “ Oh, sir,”
said the clerk, “ could you let our vicar
have a pup o’ that ’ere dog ? ”
Reserved. — Lawyer — “ I must know
the whole truth before I can successfully
defend you. Have you told me every-
thing?” Prisoner —“Except whore I
hid the money. I want that for myself.”
The poet enters timidly. “ Here are
a few verses, Mr. Editor,” he says defer-
entially. The barbarian, without looking
up, says, “Please throw them in the
basket, yourself —I haven’t time just
now.”
1 Tommy. — Mr. Ouraso — “This
is a very bad report to bring me from
school, Tommy.” Tommy—“ I know,
papa ; but you said if I’d bring you a
good report you’d give me half-a-erown,
and I wanted to save your money.”
Family friend: “ I congratulate you,
my dear sir, on the marriage of your
daughter. I see you are gradually getting
all the girls off your hands.” Old Olive-
branch : “ Off my hands—yes ; but the
worst of it is, I have to keep all their
gbands on their feet.

Medical men and scientists just now are
concerning themselves much about the health
of women and growing girls, and there cannot
be any doubt a vast amount of good has been
done in awakening a general interest in the
subject. The great truth has been forced c-'.£
all concerned, that our race cannot progress
unless our women folks are sound, healthy and
strong. All writers agree that most of the
reform required hr women lies in the question
of dress, and of all articles of attire required
the Corset is believed to be the most important.
Many medical men are of the opinion that
the Corset either builds up or interferes with
the health of women. Science has come direct
to the relief of women on this essential of dress,
the outcome of which is the French P.D.
Corset
These Corsets are a scientific perfection.
They not only give an elegant shape to the form
by holding it well together, but, being so flexible,
they conform to every movement of the figure,
thus giving support and the truest sense of
comfort and ease. By wearing a French P.D.
Corset a lady no longer feels cramped within or
without, the free c : rculation of the blood is not
impeded nor the figure distorted.
