Foreword
TO THE BABY LOVERS OF THE WORLD
Tlie countless letters of appreciation of the three books
on “What to Make for Baby” already published are a
source of wonderful gratification to me. The constant
requests for more in t.lie same line have induced me at
length to present No, 4.
In this book I have endeavoured to include every gar-
ment a baby can possibly require which is not to be
found in preceding volumes, together with the most
beautiful, yet simply worked, designs of the usual
articles, from bonnets to bibs, or carrying coats to
bootees. Throughout Australia and New Zealand there
is an enormous circulation of my books. This continues
ever on the increase, and those who make use of them
write so continuously, testifying to the accuracy and sim-
plicity of the descriptions and the beauty of the garments
when made, and seem so altogether pleased, that I now
feel assured that in England and in America equal satis-
faction will be found.
Returning sincere and grateful thanks to the great
circle of well-wishers who have written so kindly, and
with such gracious thanks to me, and trusting this book
will prove as useful and be as successful as its
predecessors.—I remain, yours faithfully,
ELLA ALLAN.


EXPLANATION OF CROCHET STITCHES
Chain.—Make a slip knot on needle, draw thread through this
loop. Draw wool through second loop and continue for
whatever length of chain is required.
Single Crochet.—Put hook through work at stitch indicated in
directions; draw thread through work and through loop on
needle at same time. This is sometimes called Slip Stitch.
Double Crochet.—-Put hook through work, thread over hook
and draw through, making two loops on needle; thread over
again and draw through both loops.
Treble. —Thread over the needle; hook through work; thread
over and draw through, making- three loops on needle;
thread over, draw through two loops; thread over again
and draw through remaining two.
Double Treble. —Thread over hook twice; hook through work,
thread over and draw through, making four loops on needle;
thread over and draw through two loops, then the second
two, and lastly the remaining two.
Long Treble. —Thread over hook three times; hook through
work; thread over and draw through, making five loops on
needle; thread over and draw through two at a time.
Picot.—A Picot stitch is made by working 4 chain, then making
a double crochet in the fourth chain from needle.
Star Stitch.—On a given number of chain pick up four in addi-
tion to the loop on needle, thus making five stitches; draw
wool through all five together; then make one chain. For
next star draw thread through the hole under the one chain;
then through the back thread of former star and pick up
two more chain and draw through all five loops together.
In second row —make three chain to commence. Pick up
the second and third of these, then the back thread on top
of star below, and lastly draw thread through eye of star
below, and draw wool through all five loops together; 1
chain, and proceed as before.
* is used to indicate repetition of preceding instructions.
Balls for finishing off cords at waist, etc. Work 4 chain and
join into a ring, into which put 14 treble (3 chain to begin
counts as first treble), then make 1 double crochet into each
alternate treble (this will draw it almost close up). Break
off end of thread, and sew on to end of cord.
