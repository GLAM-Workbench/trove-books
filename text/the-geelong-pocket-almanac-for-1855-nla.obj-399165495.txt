GARDENERS’ CALENDAR.
January
Kitchen Garden. — Remove the whole of the
exhausted crops, and prepare the ground for a suc-
cessive one of the same or different kinds. Transplant
cauliflower, hrocoli, and other of the cabbage tribe.
Sow turnips, turnip-rooted radishes, peas and beans,
endive and spinach. If moist weather, transplant
lettuces, leeks, &c. Gather seeds, choosing dry-
weather, and the early part of the morning for the
work. Water all newly-made plantations of what-
soever kinds when the weather is hot and dry.
Earth up potatoes.
Nursery and Fruit Garden. —Budding may now
be safely performed on all kinds of fruit trees,
as well as rose trees for standards, and other choice
shrubs. Put stakes to newly-budded trees. Attend
to weeds and insects.
Floicer Garden. —The flower borders should be
kept clear of weeds, by hoeing and raking the sur-
face frequently. Cut away the stalks of plants past
flowering, and tie up those w hich require support.
Propagate shrubs and herbaceous plants. Lay
pinks, double sw T eet-williams, &c.


February.
Kitchen Garden. —Cucumbers should be duly
watered after sunset in the evenings, if the weather
is dry. Sow seeds of late and early kinds of cabbage,
coleworts, and brocoli. Transplant those remaining
in the seed beds. Make plantations of endive,
lettuce, and celery; the latter in trenches. Sow a
small crop of early turnips. Sow small salads. Pull
up full grown onions as the tops decay. Gather
seeds of the different vegetables when ripe. Eradi-
cate all weeds. Continue to clean and earth up
potatoes.
Fruit Garden. —Displace all lateral or side shoots
on.. grape vines which have been produced since
midsummer. Remove all tendrils and superabun-
dant leaves to admit the sun and air, and to forward
the ripening of the fruit. Look over espaliers, and
place the shoots in order, tying them to the stakes
in a straight and regular position ; continue budding,
and after the bud is inserted, tie a cabbage leaf over
it to protect it from the sun.
Flower Garden. —ln showery weather remove all
chance seedlings of perennials aud biennials. Keep
the borders clear of weeds, regulate the growth of
straggling plants, and sow polyanthus and auricula
seed.
March.
Kitchen Garden. —Thin and weed the beds of
spinach, and sow another crop. Continue making
plantations of lettuce and endive. Sow onion seed
for pulling early in the spring months. Plant a


square of brocoli and savoy; also cabbage. Thin
the turnips sown last month, and sow more seed.
Sow r also, radishes, beets, French beans, onions,
carrots, early-frame peas. Make the final plantation
of celery in trenches. Make mushroom beds.
Fruit Garden. —Examine vines as the grapes
continue to ripen, and where the leaves are too thick
they should be removed. Prune away lateral, and
see that all other shoots are in their proper places.
Too much attention cannot be given to wall and
espalier trees at this season; where the branches are
displaced or in confused order, they should be nailed
or tied to their proper places. Remove leaves to
give the fruit a fair chance of ripening.
Flower Garden. —The more early flowering kinds
of bulbous roots may be planted at the end of the
month; stick weak growing plants, and strike
honeysuckle cuttings. The seeds of biennials and
perennials may now be sown, and towards the end of
the month part and propagate fibrous rooted peren-
nial plants, such as southern-w T ood, heartsease,
violets, &c.
Apeil.
Kitchen Garden. —Keep the beds of winter spi-
nach clear of w r eeds, and thin to the proper distance.
Make another plantation of lettuces. Sow a crop of
long pod and dwarf Mazagon beans. Sow also
brocoli, lettuce, onions, turnips, cabbages and
radishes. Form strawberry beds. Make a full plan-
tation of cauliflower plants on rich ground, and sow
seeds of this plant. Transplant a general crop of


cabbages and coleworts. Sow early peas. Earth up
celery in fine dry weather. Gather seeds of aspara-
gus. Clear off all rubbish from vacant patches of
ground, which should be dug up to give it the benefit
of a fallow. Finish taking up potatoes and Jerusa-
lem artichokes.
Fruit Garden. —Remove suckers arising from all
the different kinds of fruit trees, as well as any
shoots that may arise in the main stem below the
budded or grafted part. Plants should be now re-
placed in the greenhouse which had been put in the
open air in spring.
Flower Garden. —Make plantations of indigenous
trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants. These plants
when mixed with exotics, have a very pretty effect
from the lively evergreen character of their leaves,
and the abundance of blossom.
Mat.
Kitchen Garden. —This is one of the most active
months of the year for horticultural operations.
Keep the beds of spinach thinned and clear of
weeds. Asparagus may be forced in frames where
an early supply is wanted. Sow a full crop of the
early horn carrots. Select the best grown specimens
of vegetables, and plant out to produce seed. Keep
the different species of the same family separate to
preserve the kinds pure. Continue planting cabbages
and cauliflowers. The heads of asparagus will now
require to be cut down, the beds cleared of weeds,
and finish with their winter dressing. Sea kale and
globe artichoke plantations will also require to have


necessary dressing. This is the season for
taring kitchen garden grounds.
Fruit Garden. —Fruit trees of all kinds will now r ,
i most situations, he in proper condition for a gene-
d pruning. Do not, however, cut the vines unless
le wood is ripe. Sow seeds of apples, pears,
lums, cherries, almonds, peaches, mulberries, med-
irs, quinces, &c., and plant out fruit trees, which
aould be protected by mats.
Floicer Garden.-* Plant biennial and perennial
lants. Transplant native shrubs. Strike geraniums,
ddna roses, &c., from cuttings.
JutfE.

arly peas, another crop of Windsor and Mazagon
»eans. Finish earthing up celery, if fine weather.
Seep up a regular succession of radishes and small
minding by sowing twice in the month. Sow
mother crop of prickly spinach in drills a foot asunder.
Continue filling up vacant spots with cabbage and
;auliflower. Sow also more seeds of the early and
arge York and sugar loaf cabbages ; as also another
small crop of horn carrots for pulling early. All
meant or unoccupied portions of ground will now
•equire to be manured and trenched or dug, to
sweeten the soil preparatory to receiving the spring
;rops intended for it.
Fruit Garden. —Refresh fruit tree borders wdiere
he soil is exhausted. Continue the general pra-
ting, and remove and transplant fruit trees where


wanted. Put wet dung to the roots of newly-
planted trees. Wash your apple trees in a solutioi
of soap and soda, to remove the blight.

The principal object of this Association is to unite a
Permanent Land, Investment, Building, and Land Im-
provement Society, which offers the following advantages
to its Members, viz.: —
1. The allotment of land in retail quantities at whole-
sale prices, and the payment of such wholesale prices by
easy monthly instalments.
2. The provision of a safe and profitable investment
for the industrious classes, paying to the (Society’s funds
monthly subscriptions or single deposits.
3. The advancement to allottees of this and other
land societies, and all other classes of funds to assist
them in erecting or improving dvvel ings on their own
land; and in case of agricultural land, such fences and
outbuildings as may be necessary to bring the same into
practical cultivation; and the repayment of these ad
vances by the same easy monthly instalments.


4. The saving of the expenses of the mortgage deed,
together with registration fees, amounting to at least
Three Pounds sterling, to the allottees who do not pay
up the balance of the purchase-money on receiving
possession of their allotments, an advantage which no
existing Land Society in this Colony offers.
The practical supervision of an active and energetic
Executive Board of Management over the whole working
of the Association, secures for the shareholders the most
judicious purchases of land, which will be effected in very
short intervals, and varied as to character and locality,
to suit the requirements of all its members. Each pur-
chase will be allotted forthwith, and immediate possession
given to entitled allottees
Persons who wish to join the Investment, Building?
and Land Improvement Scheme, pay the same entrance
fee and monthly subscription, and become eligible as
borrowers in three months, to be supplied as funds accu-
mulate, their previous subscriptions being placed to their
credit with 8 per cent, interest.
Members, whose land shares are not satisfied within
10 months, will be permitted to transfer their shares to
the Association, and 6 per cent, will be allowed over and
on the subscriptions paid to the funds of the Association.
Kules and Prospectuses may be had, and members
enrolled daily, from 9 to 5, at the Offices of the Asso-
ciation, in the new buildings at the Mechanic’s Institution,
Collins-street, East, opposite the “Argus” Office.

WHITE ST AE HUE
LIVERPOOL and AUSTRALIAN PACKETS.
Persons desirous of sending for their friends in
England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, the United States
and Canadas, can obtain certificates of passage,
Cabin, Second Cabin and Steerage ,
By any of the Clippers belonging to this celebrated line,
by applying to us, or any of our authorised Agents in
the Australian Colonies.
The advantages offered to Emigrants are the remark-
able short trips made by the ships of this line, moderate
rates of passage, and punctuality in sailing.
As a proof of this, we mention the performances of
three of these liners that have just left this port: —
The GOLDEN ERA,
1635 tons register, 84 days, 532 passengers, was dis-
charged, loaded, and despatched for sea within thirty
days.
The RED JACKET,
2460 tons register, with 470 passengers, made the run
in days, under canvas (the shortest ever known),
and discharged and loaded about 1800 tons of cargo,
&c., and sailed again fifteen days after arrival.
The MERMAID,
1300 tons register, with 410 passengers, arrived deeply
laden in 74 clays, and sailed again with a full cargo
in four weeks’ time, making a total of 1412 passengers,
all of whom were landed in good health, thus shewing
an average passage of 75 days, and average time in
port 24 days, which despatch has not been equalled
by any passenger ships to this country.


Several New Clippers have been contracted for, among
which are the White Star, Blue Jacket , Antipodes, and
Gold Field, all of the largest size, and of the Red
Jacket model.
These packets are all first-class, have been built by
their enterprising owners, Messrs. Pilkington and Wilson,
expressly for the Australian Passenger Trade, are com-
manded by men of experience, and have unsurpassed
accommodations, possessing all the modern improvements
conducive to the health and comfort of passengers. A
liberal Dietary Scale is provided, of the best quality of
provisions, and a qualified Surgeon is appointed to each
ship. Their Cabin accommodations are superb, being
fitted up with rich cabinet woods, and the second-class
berths offer every inducement to the emigrant.
The ’tween decks are spacious and most conveniently
arranged, and we believe we shall not be contradicted by
saying that parties sending for their friends cannot pro-
cure a more desirable conveyance. The most extensive
arrangements have been made to issue Certificates from
any part of Great Britain, the United States, and Canadas,
for any of the Australian Colonies.
These beautiful Packet Ships are regularly despatched
on their return voyage with Gold, Passengers, and Cargo,
a special advertisement being issued for each ship when
the day is appointed.
Sight Drafts on England, from £1 upwards, issued in
sums to suit.
For plans of cabins, passage certificates, bills of ex-
change, and every information relative to the “ White
Star Line,” of Packets, apply to
