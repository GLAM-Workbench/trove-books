THE (UNITED) DIOCESE
SOUTH AND WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The Colony of South Australia, founded in the year 1836, has risen with unexampled rapidity
in numbers and importance. Its population is now believed to exceed 25,000; and from the rich Mines
of Copper and Lead, discovered in many parts of the Colony, an extraordinary increase by immigration,
both from Europe and the neighbouring Colonies, may be expected. The concentration, however, of the
population consequent upon Mining operations, while it calls for the immediate supply of Religious
Ordinances, affords, at the same time, the best hope of their being effectually supplied. From the annexed
tabular statement, it appears that two additional Clergymen arc required for North and South Adelaide,
with their adjacent villages, Thebarton, Ilindmarsh, Walkerville, Goodwood, &c. Seven other districts
(besides Port Adelaide, Mount Barker, Gawlcr, which have resident Clergymen) are sufficiently peopled
to call for the residence, or missionary visits, of a Pastor.
The population of Western Australia, on the other hand, is scattered over an immense extent
of country, but with exemplary zeal, aided by friends and societies in England, the members of pur
Church have provided for Six Clergymen, and have built suitable Churches for them to perform their
duties. They have also built four substantial Churches where the offices of a Clergyman cannot be
obtained, the inhabitants of those districts preferring to hear the service read by the nearest magistrate
until a minister can be provided with a maintenance. One of these districts, King George’s Sound, is
so distant from all other settled parts of the Colony, that many months often elapse without a Clergyman
visiting it. The children are consequently unbaptized—the sacraments are not administered—marriages
are, perforce, civil contracts, —and the dead arc buried without the rites of the Church! The Colony
has been established seventeen years: all the Churches arc unconsecrated—the youth are unconfirmed—
and at the Vasse the dead are buried in the fields; yet notwithstanding the great disadvantages under
which it labours, it is gratifying to add that the criminal statistics show fewer offences against
the law than any other of our possessions in the East. It is almost vain to hope that this character can
be maintained unless some better provision for the spiritual instruction and superintendence of the
rising generation is made by our Church. The Romanists have already planted theirs in its completeness
in the Colony. They have founded a Bishopric, and are establishing Convents, Schools, Institutes, &c.
planting the Church first, and trusting, by its presence, to obtain a hold on the people, and the result
shows that they have calculated correctly on the weakness of the Church of England. Their numbers
were not 200 when the first priest landed—now it is feared that they already exceed 600.
A considerable effort has likewise been made in South Australia by the South Australian Church
Society. A sum of <£3oo lias been collected in the past year, and it is hoped that by regular contri-
butions from every individual belonging to our Church, a considerable yearly income may be realised.
Subscriptions to the amount of £1,650 have also been made since 1844, towards liquidating the debt on
1 rinity Church. But until local resources can be fully and systematically developed, the presence and
labours of more Clergy arc needed; and for their temporary support, the aid of the Mother Country is
required. It must be remembered that Clergy, Churches, School-houses, Parsonages, Glebes, are all
needed; and it can hardly be expected that, amid the struggles of a young Colony, such objects can
adequately be provided out of the limited capital of the industrious Emigrant. It is during the trying
period of his first establishment, that he requires, and it is hoped will not ask in vain for, the support
of his fellow-Christians and fellow-Churchmen; members of the same body, and heirs of the same
immortal hopes with himself. Those who possess land, or other property in the Colony, or whose

Besides the above districts, the Special Surveys of the Burra Burra, Mount Barker, Reedy Creek, and Mount
Remarkable, are presumed to have from 200 to 300 people at each, and the number is very rapidly increasing.
At the Kaounda, Victoria, Montacute Mines, also, a number of workpeople must be consrresrated : and the total
relatives are settled there, will, it is believed, feel it to be their especial privilege and duty to contribute
according to their ability, for the furtherance of this holy cause. An income of £lOO per annum, together
with an allowance of £l2O for Outfit and Passage, is the lowest remuneration which can be justly offered
to any Minister of the Gospel, who is willing to give himself to the Lord’s service in the Colonial
Churches. By the blessing of God it is hoped that many will be found to go forth and labour in the
Vineyard, content with the simple measure of food and raiment which will thus be supplied.
At the Kapunda, Victoria, Montacute Mines, also, a number of workpeople must be congregated ; and the total
of such mining labourers with their families cannot, it is thought, be less than 4,000 souls.
