PART I.
SERVING AND WORKING HEAVY ORDNANCE.
ARTICLE I.
Telling off the Detachments.
A gun detachment consists of one Non-commissioned Officer and nine Gunners.
In the service and exercise of the various descriptions of ordnance, the same
numbers, as far as possible always perform the same dufaes; ' detadimen s
being, told off upon the same principle, viz., beginning with the lowest numbers,
and proceeding to the highest; No. 1 always commanding. at n ?
TeUlna of- The detachment falls in two deep, in close order. No 1 tells
them o/from the right; 2 being the right hand man of the rear rank; 3 the righ
hand man of the front rank; 4 the second man from the light ot the rear , 5 tne
man in his front, and so on. The detachment is aiso told off into two sections.
The detachment is marched into the battery, and is halted mime,
4- iRp ipff rpnr of the �?un which is to be worked, i. lie detacnmenu
FsTow in the position of ? Detachment rear,? or that which it occupies when it
cornel into the battery as a relief, and whilst the relieved party is marching off.
At the word ?Take post under cover? No. 1 gives ?To the right face,? and
taking an oblique pace to the left rear, ? double march. The detachment, step-
ping off, wheels to its left at the left corner of the platform, the front rank filing to
the g left of the gun, the rear rank to the right. Nos. 2 and 3 halting close to the
parapet, and near the mouth of the embrazure, the other numbers forming upon
their*right and left in succession. No.l following m rear of the rear rank; they
face to the right-about together.
The detachment, now close to the parapet, is in the position it should occupy
when not actively engaged in working the gun.
When there is no parapet the detachment files on to the gun, at the command,
?Take post at the gun,? Nos. 2 and 3, halting in hne with the muzzle. Nos. 4 and 5
the trunnions, Nos. 6 and 7 the vent, No. 1 the trail, and the whole m echellon.

Some articles, such as spunges, rammers, lanyards, handspikes, must also be in
excess, the spare stores being in some place in or near the battery. If shells and
cartridges are not ready filled, there will be required also, at the magazine and
shell room, filling funnels, large 1, small 1; a set of weights and scales; ample-
ments for opening casks; wadmiltilts; slippers; needles; worsted; scissors, bpaie
tangent scales; dispart sights, screws, and screw drivers. There will be required,
also, fuze pincers; wood drifts; punches for rivetting on bottoms; screw drivers tor
sh ramie!
The tangent scale and dispart sight are supposed to have been previously fixed
on the gun by competent men. The round or hollow shot piled on its lett, and
close to the front of the ground platform, which has slope of about l-18th, depend-
ing-, however, on the nature of the gun, and the service for which it is intended.
The axle-tree arms are greased. The gun is at the tail of the platform. The sur-
face of the platform must be perfectly smooth.
Exercise of Guns on Standing Carriages, covered by high Parapet,
Preparation for Action.
Should the gun not be provided with its stores, at the word from the commander,
? Prepare for action,? the detachment acts as follows�unning to the store.
The first five numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) bring up handspikes, and
No. 2, assisted by No. 4, also brings up side arms.
4, priming irons. ' ,
3, and No. 5 the case, grape and wads, (the round shot is supposed to be at
the gun).
? 6, water bucket, and assists to bring up case and grape.
? 7, the tube pocket, tubes, lanyard, and elevating screw. .
8, takes the cartridge cases to the magazine, brings up a cartridge in one case,
leaves the other to be filled, takes the filled case, and places it near the tad
of the platform. If shells are to be fired, he proceeds to prepare them with
~ 9, brings boring bits, fuzes, and implements from the store; prepares shells,
and assisted by No. 8, brings them up. _
? 10, goes to the expense Magazine, or, assisted by 8 and 9, brings up a metal
lined case with cartridges. . .
The detachment should be frequently exercised in preparing for action, at dilter-
ent batteries, in the shortest possible time.
The foregoing detail of preparing for action has reference to a battery _ suitably
provided with a store and expense magazine close to the guns. Should this not be
the case, the material must be brought up in a, hand cart. . ,
The stores having been brought up, No. 1, if the gun is under metal, gives the
word ?Elevate,? ?Clear the vent,? ?Search the gun.? No. 2 and 3 take a pur-


clwse �ver the cheeks and under the breech : the quoin is withdrawn and the cun
slm-htly elevated; No. 6 and No. 7 put on the elevating screw; the vent is drifted
and the searcher introduced into the gun, pushed gently to the bottom of the bore
turned, and slowly withdrawn, constantly turning it. No. C then takes the
searcher, and cleans it it necessary.
Commandirig.
No. 1 has no fixed place. He gives all words of command, and is responsible
that every man does his duty properly. He lays the gun, directing it as much as
possible into the line of fire, when running up, by means of his handspike. When
the gun is to be fired, he places himself to windward of it, in order to ascertain, by
next roimd 6 1S P ro J ec^e � wither any alteration be necessary for the
Springing and Loading.
The commander names the object to be fired at, the elevation, the length of fuze
(it necessary), and the nature of projectile, and gives the word ?Load.?
At the word Load, No. 2 moves forward, so that when he arrives near the
face of the piece he may be facing it. He places his left foot in line with, and
about twelve inches from the muzzle, steps to the right with his right foot, and
xooivS to ins i6ii rear.
, straight to the vent, faces to the right, and presses the fleshy part
ol Ins left thumb firmly on the vent?his fingers opened out, and extended down
the vent held?his whole person as much under cover as possible.
No. 6 faces to his left about f, seizes the spunge with his left hand back up near
the spunge head; his right back down about two feet from it, takes a pace to his
right, sinks the spunge head until the stave is vertical,?faces to the left about
and moves to the left rear of No. 2, gives him the spunge, and falls back to the
parapet, takes up the rammer precisely as he lifted the spunge,?faces about as
before -moves up in line with the trunnions,?passes the stave in between No- 2
and the gun, and places the rammer head on the platform, the stave end on the sill
ot the embrazure. _ He then places himself in rear of No. 2, and prepares to receive
the spunge from him.
_ No. 3 moves forward until in line with the muzzle, faces to his right, looks to
Ins right rear, and prepares to receive the cartridge from No. 7.
No. 5 if round, grape, or case are to be fired, takes up the projectile (and srum-
met wad, if necessary), and stands on No. 3?s right front.
No. 7 runs to the rear of the platform, brings up the cartridge in its case care-
fully covered, places himself opposite No. 3, cartridge case between them.
. No - 2 ta kes the spunge in a vertical position from No. 6, the back of' No 2?s
nght hand being in front of his left shoulder, the back of his left hand outside his
lelt thigh; seizmg the spunge he brings jt in line with the axis of the gun?enters
the head into the bore, slides his hand along the stave to his right as far as he can
reach,?sends the spunge up the bore,?slides his hands out again and forces the
spunge hard home,?gives it two half turns, pressing it against the bottom of the
bore,?withdraws the spunge, turning it from him, cleaning the bore well. When
the spunge arrives near the muzzle he jerks it out. His hands should then be in
the position they were when he introduced the spunge into the bore. He lowers
the spunge head, brings the stave to a vertical position, slews his body to the left,
hands the spunge to Iso. 6, who receives it as he gave it. No. 6 facing about, lays
down the spunge, and places himself to the left rear of No. 2.
The spunge being put of the bore, No. 7 hauls the cartridge out of its case by
the choke with his right hand, places it in No. 3?s hands, choke to the rear, and
takes the case back to the rear of the platform.
No. 3 faces right about, puts the cartridge into the bore; looks to his left rear,
receives projectile from No. 5, and places it in the bore.
Whilst this is being done, No. 2 takes up the rammer, right hand about the cen-


tre back down, left as near the head as possible, back up, enters the head into the
bore, and forces tlie charge home in two motions. No. 3 directly the charge is in
the bore, places himself in a position corresponding to that of No. 2, and assists
him to ram home. They then quit the stave and step back one pace from the
muzzle, whilst No. 4 ascertains whether the cartridge be home.
Having taken the priming irons from the loop, No. 4 pricks the cartridge. VV hen
2 sees the pricker withdrawn, he steps in, springs the rammer, B goes under cover,
2 steps bacK, looks to his left rear, hands the rammer to 6 in the same manner as
he received the spunge from him, and then goes under cover. 4 replaces the pri-
ming irons and goes under cover. 6 occasionally wets the spunge.
When reduced charges are used with chambered guns, the cartridge and shot must
be rammed home separately. ? ... , ,
Should No. 4 not feel the cartridge, he says, ? not home,? withdraws the pnckei
and serves the vent again; whereupon 2 and 3 give the charge a sharp blow.
With 8-inch or 10-iuch guns, the projectile being heavy, No. 3 is assisted to load
by No 6. If shells are used, they are brought up in their boxes, fuze downwards.
The box is passed under the muzzle along the platform by No. 3to No. 6. Ihe
lid is taken off. With their inward hands they lay hold of the rope handles, then-
outward hands supporting the box, raise it as high as the muzzle, capsize it sharply,
throwing the shell into the bore. No. 3 then uncaps the fuze, and the shell is ram-
med home as before. . ,
No 8, directly the cartridge case is empty, runs with it to the magazine, leaves
it to be refilled, and takes the second cartridge case up to the rear of the gun.
With case or grape, the outward hands of the same numbers support the top;
the bottom is supported on the bend of the inward arm.
Punning up
Directly the gun is loaded, No. 1 gives the words, ? run up. The handspike
men, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, seize their handspikes smartly at the centre, with their hands
next the parapet, the other hands grasping them at the small ends, backs down :
stepping up to their respective axletree arms, they apply their handspikes under
and in rear of them with a good bearing on the platform, separate their teet,
and stand ready to heave. No. 6 and No. 7, at the small ends of the handspikes,
assist Nos. 2 and 3.
No. 1 applies his handspike under the rear transom to guide the gun, he then gives
the word ? Heave.? Taking the time from No. 2, and using short quick purchases,
they heave together, until the front trucks arc near the hurter, when No. 1 gives.
It ?
No 1 drops his handspike, looks over the sights, steadying himself by holding the
cascable. Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, withdraw their handspikes, drop the points to the
ground, face to the rear, step off the platform, hold their handspikes diagonally
across the body, outward hands at the small ends as high as the ear, inward hands
resting on the handspike at the full extent of the arm.
No? 6, kneeling on his left knee, in rear of the right cheek, takes hold ot the
large quoin with both hands, the small quoin with his left hand, or works the
screw as may be directed by No. 1; but the screw should be used in general only
for final adjustment.
Pointing and Laying.
No. 1, having fixed his tangent scale at the required elevation, gives the
word ? Elevate,? when Nos. 2 and 3 step forward in line with the breech, place
their handspikes over the step, and under the breech, and bear down. No. i gives
the word, ? Lower,? Nos. 2 and 3 allow the small ends to rise gently ; as soon as
the elevation is obtained, No. 1 gives the word, ?Quoin,? and No. 6 forces the
quoin sharply home. Nos. 2 and 3 withdraw their handspikes and step outwards.
If the muzzle is to go to the left, No. 1 gives the word, ? Trail right; No. 5
stepping to Ms left, takes a purchase under the rear extremity of the cheek, ana


stands ready to heave over the trail; No. 4, stepping to his right front, moves to
the rear of his axletree arm, and applies his handspike under it as horizontally as
possible, the small end from him. At the word ? Heave,? No. 5 heaves from him,
No. 4 lifts and draws towards himself. They heave together until the word ?Halt.?
? Trail left ?is the converse of the above. If further elevation or traversing is
required it is given as above.
If a very slight amount of elevation or depression is required, No. 6 works the
screw according to directions from No. 1. In this case handspikes are not necessary.
Brass tangent scales for heavy guns being graduated only to s�, any elevation
beyond that number is obtained by using the wooden scale. The brass scale is
first drawn out to about 4�, and then clamped. The wooden scale, previously ad-
justed to the required degree, is then placed over the brass scale, and rests upon
the base ring.
It must be explained to No. 1 that the fore sight, near the trunnions, is to be
used with the brass tangent scale, but the notch on the muzzle with the wooden
scale.
Whilst this operation is taking place. No. 7 has prepared a tube.
Priming and Firing.
The correct line having been obtained, the word Ready is given. At that word
the handspikes are laid down without noise, and the handspike men go under cover.
No. 7 goes to the breech, presses a friction tube into the vent, stretches out the
lanyard to the left front with his right hand, looks at No. 1, and waits for the word,
? Fire.?
No. 1, unless otherwise ordered, places himself to windward, looks out for the
effect of the shot, and gives the word, ? Fire.?
No. 7 pulls the lanyard sharply, coils it up, places the bight of it in his belt, and
foes under cover. No 4 runs out, brushes the vent from right to left, and clears it
y inserting the drift carefully. No. 1 does not give the word, ?Load,? until the
drift is withdrawn.
With a hammer and detonating tube. ?At the word ? Ready,? No. 7 moves out
as before, drops a tube into the vent; uncoils the lanyard from the button of the
piece, holding the end of it in his right hand, stretched out. At the word ? Fire,?
he gives a strong pull, coils up the lanyard, which he places on the hammer, and
falls into his place under cover.
With a tube and portfire. ?When the gun is fired with a portfire, it is primed
with the common quill or copper tube ; and the portfire applied rather in front of
the vent, so that the explosion may not blow it out of No. 7?s hand.
When firing at moving objects, the gun is primed before pointing. No. 1 priming.
Running bade.
At the word ? Run back,? the handspikes are taken up, reversed, and applied
under, and in front of the axeltree arms. ? Heave,? ? Halt.? The handspikes are
withdrawn, reversed, and laid down. This operation is just the reverse of running
up. A tackle and bollard are, however, preferable to handspikes in running back.
At the word ?Cease firing, replace stores,? the side arms, cartridge case, &c..
are taken to the store by the numbers that brought them. If the handspikes re-
main with the gun, they are placed over the trucks, points to the front.
Detachments rear.
On the caution ?Detachments rear,? No. 1 moves three paces to the left rear of
the platform, faces to the right, so that the detachment when formed may be under
cover of the merlon; he gives the word, ? Outwards face,? Nos. 2, 4, and 6 face to
the left; Nos. 3, 5, and 7to the right. ?Double march,? Nos. 6 and 7 wheel to
the right and left, and when clear of the platform, both wheel to the right, and
march close past No. I?s left shoulder. When the last file has passed him he gives,
? Halt, Front, Dress,? No. 1 facing to the proper front at the same time.


At "Detachment rear/? when there is no parapet, the command is ? Right about
face,? ; and the detachment proceeds as above.
Exercise op Guns on Rear Chock Carriages.
The stores required for the service of guns thus mounted are the same as those
before mentioned, with the exception of one roller handspike for the use of No. 1,
and two 7-feet instead of five common handspikes.
In ? Running up,? No. 1, holding his roller handspike vertically, takes a pur-
chase under the stud in rear of the chock, bears down and raises it off the platform ;
Nos. 2 and 3 apply their handspikes at the fore-axletree arms, as before directed,
and are assisted by Nos. 4 and 5, and if necessary by 6 and 7. No. 1 has perfect
control over the carriage, and can guide it as he likes. When the platform is in
good order the gun runs up very fast; No. 1, in that case, allows the small end of
the handspike to " come up,? before the trucks reach the hurter. ?Halt.? Hand-
spike men face to the rear in line with the vent. Nos. 2 and 3 inside.
? Elevate,? Nos. 2 and 3 with their handspikes, double-manned by Nos. 4 and 5.
? Trail left,? Nos. 2 and 4 apply the handspike, under the right cheek, behind
the chock, and clear of it.
? Trail right,? Nos. 3 and 5 the handspike in a similar manner under the left
cheek.
In running up, if the gun is allowed to strike the hurter violently, the shot and
cartridge may be started.
Running hack.
Running back is performed by means of tackle ; No. 1 engages his roller hand-
spike, as in running up the rest of the numbers run away with the fall. A whip
upon whip is the most handy purchase.
Changing rounds.
In changing rounds 2 becomes 4; 4, 6; 6, 1; 10, 9 ; 9, 8; 8, 7; 7, 5 ; 5, 3 ;
3, 2.
ARTICLE IY.
Hot Shot.
With some few exceptions the duties are the same as those before described.
No. 3 puts a dry wad over the cartridge, and then a damp one.
No. 5 as usual supplies 3 with wads, first a dry then a damp one.
No. 8 and 9 bring up hot shot on a bearer, in the same manner as they brought
up shells.
The spunge must be frequently damped.
The same stores are required as for the service of heavy guns with cold shot.
Junk wads are indispensable, and those which are used wet should be of a low
gauge. The shot also should be of a low gauge.
Utensils required for Heating the Shot,
One furnace or grate , with chimney in lengths.
One moving tool.
One scraper.
One pair of tongs.
One poker.
One rake.
One shovel.
One stand on which to place the shot in order to scrape them.
One shot hearer per gun.
Two tubs full of water, to soak wads, cool tongs, &c.
Two or three water buckets.
Fuel. ?Wood or coals, or a mixture of coal and coke, according to circumstances.
One gauge for shot.


There should never be less than four men to attend the furnace, even when the
shot and wood are close at hand, viz., one non-commissioned officer or steady man
in charge, to see that the reddest shot are served out and replaced by cold ones,
and to keep such a fire as he may judge necessary.
One man to light and attend the fire, and to supply fresh fuel when required.
One to take out shot, lay them on the stand, scrape them, and afterwards place
them on a bearer.
One to supply the furnace with cold shot, and to bring fuel.
The shot should not be brought to white heat, or they may lose shape, and
jam in the bore.
Loading.
When firing hot shot three-fourths of the service-charge only is used.
The cartridge must undergo the strictest examination, to see that there are no
holes in it, lest in setting it home any grains should fall out. The gun should be
slightly elevated.
Until the cartridge is placed in the bore, the loading proceeds as with cold shot.
Over the cartridge is placed first, a dry, and then a damp wad, the whole is rammed
home together by Nos. 2 and 3. No. 5, who has near him a tub filled with water,
for the wet wads, prepares one at the word ? Load ? by beating it against the
platform or barter with a mallet.
_ The hot shot is then brought up by Nos. 8 and 9 in a bearer. No. 8 on the
right, No. 9, on the left : arrived in line with the muzzle, they wheel to the right,
lower their hands ; No 9 places his handle on the platform, No. B takes hold of
B?s handle, and, keeping the shot clear of the platform, pushes the bearer towards
the opposite side of the platform ; No. 6 lays hold of the handle, and together they
raise the shot, and capsize it into the bore. No. 3 throws the bearer to the rear.
If the gun has to be fired at a depression or low angle, a wad is rammed home over
the shot.
The gun is then run up, laid and fired with as little delay as possible.
This furnace will contain in three rows, alongside of each other, fifteen 32-
pounder, or eighteen 24-pounder, o.i twenty-one 18-pounder shot. The shot must
be gauged before heating.
To heat the Furnace.
To heat the furnace, it takes of coals half-a-bushel, of coke 2| bushels, and
shavings for lighting it. It should be allowed twenty minutes to light properly.
The grate should be well cleared out before lighting.
To heat the Shot.
Tiftcen 32-pounder shot being then put in, are heated in from 40 to 50 minutes.
Order of using the Shot.
The shot should be taken equally out of each row from the rear of the furnace,
and replaced by cold ones from the front. If those which present themselves are
not sufficiently hot, they must be returned at the front.
After the furnace has been thoroughly heated, it will supply a new batch of shot
every thirty or forty minutes depending on the draught and fuel.
The furnace should be placed to leeward, and as near the battery as may be con-
venient, carefully selecting an open space, with as great a draught' as can be found.
The draught hole should be to windward, and the furnace perfectly horizontal.
Earth ought to be thrown up against the furnace so as to close all the sides except
that to windward.
The Improved Shot Furnace.
This furnace weighs about 30 cwt., and will contain 36 68-pr. shot.
It is composed of four parts :
1. The ash box, made of 5-16ths" boiler plate.
2. The furnace of | boiler plate (with an air channel round it) and lined with
fire brick.


3. The furnace hood, containing the sloping bars, entrances and doors for the shot.
4. The detached fan with wheel and pinion, worked by two handles.
5. The height of the entire furnace is 4ft. Sin. from the ground ; there is no
chimney.
The shot furnace of the service is in future to be fitted with a fan.

Exercise of Guns, on Ship Carriages on Shore.
Should the carriages be placed on a ground platform having a proper slope, the
exercise is as before detailed.
But should the platform be horizontal, then additional men and stores are neces-
sary, viz., four or six men, according to the gun, and a breeching, also two luff
tackles.
The hurter or the parapet, will require to be fitted with ring bolts to receive the
breeching and hooks of the tackles.
The breeching is passed through the cascable loop, and fastened with an inside
clench to the ring bolts.
At the word ? Hook the tackles ,? Nos. 2 and 3 hook the front blocks to the
ring bolts on the shipside or parapet ; Nos. 4 and 5 hook the rear blocks to the
eyebolts of the carriage ; Nos. 6 and 7 coil up the fall.
Running in.
At the word ? Run up,? Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 unhook their respective blocks; Nos.
2 and 3 hook theirs to the trail of the carriage, and Nos. 4 and 5 theirs to the
rings in rear of the carriage. The whole of the numbers man the running ends of
the falls on their respective sides, except No. 1, who attends to the direction of his
gun and arranges the breeching. At ? Heave,? they haul together until the gun is
run sufficiently in. At ? Halt,? Nos. 2 and 3 overhaul, and with No. 4 and 5,
unhook the tackles and hook them as in the last paragraph, No. 6 and 7 coil up the fall.
Spunging and Loading.
As detailed for guns on standing carriages, No. 2 stepping over the breeching
and side tackle in line with the muzzle.
Running out.
At the word ? Run out,? the proper numbers man the running ends of the falls
as before ; No. 1 applies his handspike under the rear axletree, and takes care to
arrange the breeching so that the middle of it may be in the loop of the piece and
the slack clear of the trucks on either side. ?Heave,? Halt,? Nos. 2 and 3
overhaul; Nos. 4 and 5 unhook the rear blocks from the carriage, and lay them
down on each side, taking care that the returns of the fall are not twisted; Nos. 6
and 7 attend to the running ends to keep them clear, and coil them up.
� Elevating,? ? Traversing,? Priming,? and Firing.? As directed in Article I. of this
Part.
Exercise of Garrison Guns on Traversing Platforms.
The traversing platforms in use in this garrison being of a pattern now nearly
entirely superseded by the dwarf and casemate platforms ; the Authorities at home
have not thought fit to alter the system of drill. The old drill must therefore still
obtain when working guns so placed, and the duties of six men, therefore remain as
follows:?
3. ?Loads, runs up, assists 2 to ram
home, and elevates.
s.?Runs up, traverses, and fires.
2. ?Searches, spunges, rams home,
runs up, and elevates.
4. ?Serves the vent, runs up, traverses
and primes.
o. Brings cartridges, and srrvos 3
with shot and wads.


1. - Lays the gun, points and commands.
The spunge and rammer heads are on opposite extremities of the same stave?
and the following additional stores are required?
-1 Lock with lanyard?l powder horn, 2 double and 2 single 8 inch blocks, 2 falls,
7 fathoms long 2\ inch rope, 4 small levers shod with iron, 2 common handspikes
for elevating. The spunge and wadhook lie between the cheeks of the platform,
spunge-head and worm to the front.
Nos. 2 and 3 mount the platform by the front step.
Load. No 2.?Mounts upon the platform, placing one foot on the fore tran-
som, the other on the front step, (to prevent being exposed to the
lire of the enemy.) The gun is spunged out in the usual way?the
spunge is turned by raising it up horizontally to, and passing the
spunge-head over his own head, from left to right. The cartridge
shot and wad are rammed home in the usual manner, and the stave
sprung and replaced. No. 2 then falls in under cover.
No. 3.?Mounts upon the platform, and stands upon the front tran-
som and step, * laces to the left, and stoops down as much as
possible under cover. Loads and assists to ram home, after which
he slips down under cover.
No. 4.?His duty is the same at serving the vent, as at the standing
carriage, with this exception that he mounts the platform to serve
the vent.
Run the Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, step out, and take up their levers, lay the bevelled
gun up. side on the upper surface of the platform points under the trucks in
rear. ? Heave,? they bear down the small end of their levers which
propels the carriage forward.
Halt. The levers are withdrawn, 2 and 3 lay theirs down, and take up a
common handspike each, the whole faces to the rear, 2 and 3 in line
with the vent, 4 and 5 in line with the rear trucks of the traversing
platform.
Trail right. No. 5 steps in, places the front of his lever under the left truck on
the outside. No. 4 places the point of his under the right truck on
the inside ; at the word ? Heave,? both bear down together; at the
word ? Halt,? both scotch their trucks.
Trail left. The reverse of ? Trail Right?
Elevate. No. 5 and 4 withdraw their levers, and fall back under cover, Nos.
2 and 3, elevate in the usual manner.
Prime. No. 4 jumps up, pricks the cartridge through the vent, and leaves
his priming iron in? he nexts half cocks the piece, and primes the
pan?he then whole cocks the piece, overhauls the lanyard, heaves it
over to No- 5 And lastly, withdrawing his priming iron, he care-
fully primes the vent, taking care to connect the priming of the vent
with that of the pan, by a small train.
At?yds. No. 5 takes a turn of the lanyard round the right hand, and awaits
Eire. the word fire, when he sways his body gently sideways, from right
to left?he then throws the lanyard between the cheeks, and falls in
under cover.
Runthegun When done with levers, this operation is exactly the reverse of ? Run-
back. ning up;? when with tackles as follows:
Nos. 2 and 3 hook the double blocks to points of the rear axletree
arms, 4 and 5 overhaul the falls, and hook the single blocks into
the rear loops of the platform cheeks, after which the whole stands
to the fall, 2 and 3 in front, 4 and 5 in centre, and 1 and 6 in rear.
* Cadets of the H. T. Y. A. C., when at exercise, and doing the duties of 2 and 3, jump upon
the rail of the platform, and stand there to do their work?the toes well turned out, and the
legs well stretched out, body leaning slightly forward towards the gun.


At the word ?Heave? the whole pulls together. ? Halt? 2 and 3
unhook the double blocks, 4 and 5 overhauling and coiling up the
falls around the platform cheeks in rear. The whole falls in under-
cover.
N.B.?Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, reeve the falls.
REMARKS UPON THE SERVICE OF ORDNANCE.
1. The service of the gun divides itself into three distinct parts, the loading?
the pointing?the firing. The loading should be performed as rapidly as is con-
sistent with the proper performance of all the duties, avoiding haste or carelessness.
The pointing requires the utmost attention. The man who fires should stand rather
in front of the vent, keep his eye on No. 1, and pull the lanyard directly the word
is given. .
2. In loading, the cartridge case should be kept covered until the spunge is out of
the bore, then no time lost in introducing the cartridge.
3. The case should be distinctly painted with the nature of the gun and weight
of the charge. _ .
4. A high spunge is objectionable. No. 2 gets tired ; the spunge is not forced
home, and accidents may happen from premature explosion. When practicable the
spunge should be wetted, as the loading is thereby facilitated.
5. If a shot jams in the bore the gnu must be depressed, the trail raised and the
muzzle struck against a batten on the platform.
If this fails, the cartridge must be drowned, and afterwards a small quantity of
fine powder introduced by the vent, and .the shot blown out.
6. Junk wads are used only with hot shot, or loose powder; on other occasions,
when wads are required (under 3� of elevation, for example), split grummets are
used. The crosspieces always go outside.
7. Circumstances alone can determine the rate of firing. Against ships in motion
it cannot be too rapid, provided the pointing be careful. Immediately preceding
an assault, or in defence of a breech, when grape and case are used, the firing must
then be rapid ; gun for gun, and other things being equal, the advantage will re-
main with the party which fires quickest. But, to spare ammunition, or from other
causes, the fire may be limited to a few rounds per hour.
8. In pointing at ships in motion, three cases occur, (1) When she approaches
end on; (2) when she crosses the range directly; (3) when she circles or crosses
the range obliquely. In the first case the line remains the same, the elevation
varies; in the second the line constantly changes, the elevation varies in a less
degree; in the third both vary considerably. In the drill of guns on coast batteries
these cases should be frequently practised. The time a ship requires at different
ranges and rates of speed to cross the space limited by an embrazure, should be
explained to the men. The time of flight due to the elevations should be known
to the man laying the gun, or the chances of hitting a fast-going ship will be small.
9. To determine readily the distance of an object is then one of the most im-
portant problems in gunnery. In certain favourable localities, such as Gibraltar,
St. Helena, &c-, this may be done by measuring the angle of dip, and then referring
it to some object on the coast, the distance of which is known from the battery,
or the horizontal distance answering to any particular angle of depression may have
been previously calculated. In the absence of these methods, recourse must be had
to horizontal measurements. In every battery there should be a telescope and time
of flight instrument.
10. Practice tables should be kept in every battery for reference. But it should be
remembered that tables require correction for the wind, if blowing fresh, the lighter
guns more than the heavy. The prevailing winds and currents, the shoals, chan-
nels, and passages for men-of-war drawing certain depths of water should be well
known to the officer commanding the battery. The distance of remarkable features


within the longest range should be also ascertained and marked down on plans.
Ihe character ot the country on land fronts, its woods, hollows, ravines, marshes,
fences hills, should be also clearly shown, for upon a knowledge of these points
depends very much the value of artillery fire.
11\ Intimately connected with the efficient service of guns, if mounted upon
standing or travelling carriages, is the ground platform upon which they stand.
All insufficient slope causes great recoils, and makes the running up very laborious;
a rough or springy platform renders traversing difficult. The drainage of platforms
is a matter ot importance. Ihe breadth of the platform must depend upon the
angle ot traversing, and this again will be limited by the opening of the embrazure.
It the object is in the direction of the axis, the ordinary ground platform, with a
slope ot 1-18 th, is sufficient, and the gun can be easily fired three times in two
minutes. If, however, the object be constantly moving across the axis line, then
the gun must be mounted on a naval slide, a dwarf platform with hind step, or
casemate platform. The former is very portable, can be laid over a ground platform,
and a pivot can be made, if necessary, of a stout crowbar sunk in a dead block.
Should there be no ground platform, two sleepers, diverging outwards, will in most
cases be sufficient. The merits of this slide are ease in working, great cover from
the parapet, accuracy in laying at moving objects and firing at the right time, faci-
lity m mounting and dismounting, and shifting the whole from place to place when
required.
Should a great amount of traversing be required, and no slide or traversing plat-
form available, then the ground platform must be laid nearly horizontal, two bol-
lards fitted in the hurter, which must be strengthened for the purpose, and the gun
worked with a breeching and tackle as on board a ship.
12. The dimensions of the embrazures depend upon the calibre of the gun, the
charge of powder, and the amount of traversing required ; from three to four feet
will, in general, be necessary for the width of mouth.
13. Guns on standing carriages are capable of firing at from 14� of elevation and
15� of depression. No piece of ordnance exceeding 10 calibres in length is to be
with more than 12� degrees of elevation. But they are limited generally to 2�
or 3� of depression on account of the thickness of the parapet and height of the
genouillcre. The practical limit of depression of each gun in a fortress should be
ascertained, or the gun may be capsized by the muzzle striking in recoiling.
14. The projectiles for the immediate service of the gun should be raised off the
platform, and kept clean and dry, if possible.
15. The sights may require adjustment. First ascertain that the platform is
horizontal, and that the trunnions work truly in the trunnion holes, suspend a
plummet in rear of the cascable, and in line with the notch on the swell of the
muzzle and base ring; the top of the dispart sight and tangent scale should be in
the same plane. Then draw the tangent scale out and see that it is in the same
vertical plane, that it does not wabble, and that the clamping screw is in good
order. The piece of lead interposed between the scales and the gun should be }of
an inch thick. The screws ought to be home. The tangent scale for rifled guns
has a horizontal scale attached, fitted with a sliding sight to give compensation to
the deflection of the proiectile. The height of the dispart sight may be verified
either by means of two battens, one in the bore and the other on the top of the
gun, or by means of callipers. Thus the error in the sights, if there be any, will be
determined, and the necessary allowance must be made for it.
16. The working of the elevating screw may also be tested.
17. In using the sights, bring the centre of the top of the tangent scale on in line
with the point of the dispart sight, and the centre of the object aimed at, unless
otherwise ordered.
18. In shell firing the boring the fuze is of as great importance as laying the
gun. Hie shell is placed in the box, fuze downwards, covered up, and is then
ready to be brought up to the gun; the fuze is uncapped when the shell is in the
bore. /
19. Concussion fuzes require no boring.


20. Although Nos. 1 are directed to look out for the effect of their own shot, yet
it may happen, from smoke or other causes, that they cannot conveniently place
themselves in a position to do so, regard being had to their other duties; officers,
or selected non-commissioned officers, will therefore have to be told off especially
for this purpose. At practice a record of the result of each round should be made
in the battery, and compared afterwards with the range report.
21. 'J he elevation for any stationary object may be retained when found by mark-
ing the trunnions and trunnion holes.
22. Careful men must be chosen for expense magazine duties. In a mixed bat-
tery they have to pay particular attention to the right distribution of cartridges to
their respective cartridge cases; and that reduced cartridges for shell guns or how-
itzers are made up to the length of the chamber by attaching wads to the outside
of the choke end of the cartridge. If the wad is placed at the end of the cartridge,
two or three turns of worsted being taken over the whole, the cartridge is brought
to a proper length. If this arrangement is not made, the cartridge and shot or
shell must be rammed home separately.
23. The length of choke must not exceed half the diameter of the cartridge.
The powder is in water-tight metal lined cases, which contain.
9 cartridges, of 12 lbs. each, for 10-inch guns,
or 11 ? 10 lbs. ? 8 ?
or 7 ? 16 lbs. ? 68-pounder.
5 ? 20 lbs. ?
The top of the outer case is screwed down in two places to a false top, in which
is fitted a circular lid. The contents of each box should be distinctly marked in
black paint. The dimensions of the boxes are 1'.5" wide, 1'.6" deep, 1?."9 high,
including grummets. Should the battery be without any expense magazine, the
metal-lined case must be used, and deposited in the spot which, according to cir-
cumstances, may be considered most eligible. Cartridges made up in the battery
should be gauged before issue.
24 If possible shell rooms should be constructed in each battery, in proportion
to the number of guns, for the reception of loaded shells and for the preparation
of fuzes &c. If the shells have not been loaded before they are brought into the
battery, that operation would take place in the shell room. The bursting charges
should be made up into cartridges and packed in metal-lined cases as above. Shell
boxes are of the following dimensions :
10-inch 1'.2" + I'.O" ?+ I'.O" containing 1 each.
8-inch 1M" + O'.IO" + OMO" ? 1 ?
32-pounder 2'.6" + O'.IO" +o' 8|- ? 4 ?
24-pounder l'.10" + O'.IO" +'l 1J ? 6 ?
Should the battery be without shell rooms, the shells must be deposited in the
safest place, and only removed from their boxes to receive the fuze. They are then
to be replaced, with the fuze downwards, until wanted. The shell room should be
fitted with a shelf, upon which the zinc boxes containing tubes and fuzes should be
placed, together with all the implements for boring and fixing them, filling shells,
&c. The tube boxes are not to be opened inside the room. The rivetting on of
wooden bottoms should be done, if possible, before the shells ar brought up into
battery.
25. If the dimensions of the shell room are not such as to allow of the side arms and
other stores to be placed in it, separate store rooms will be required for those articles.
The best position of the spunges, rammers, and wadhooks is on two battens overhead.
The ends of the staves are placed upon one batten, the rammer and spunge heads
rest upon a moveable batten, which is triced up as high as possible. On preparing
for action this batten is lowered, and the staves drawn out through the door. The tube
pockets, priming irons, tangent scales, hammers, lanyards, &c., are placed on shelves,
so as to be readily inspected and got at conveniently. On the floor are the hand-
spikes, grape and case shot, wads, and other stores, required for the service of the


guns, whilst the tackle is coiled and hung up so as to occupy as little space as
possible. The dimensions of the case and grape boxes are as follows ;
8-inch 2'.6" + T. 2" + 0M0" 3in each.
10-inch 2'. 3? + 1'.2" + 1M" 2 ?
32-pounder 2'.8" -+- T. 3" + 0'.9" 4 ?
24-pounder T. 10" + I'l" + IMi" 6 ?
Including the grummets at the ends.
26. The armament of coast works must necessarily be of the same power as that
of the floating batteries which will be brought against them. This at once sets
aside all smaller calibres. The guns mounted must be able to traverse rapidly so
as to follow an object in motion, and be fired at the right time, not by guess work,
but by looking over the sights until the word is given.
27. Shot rails and spouting may be the readiest means of conveying projectiles
to the heavier guns from the depot; but much will depend on local circumstances.
The rails may have to be laid on high trestles to avoid hollows, or they may be car-
ried under a road. Shells grape and case will be transported in their boxes, and
brought up in carts or otherwise according to the means at hand. The question
of supply of projectiles requires to be carefully considered for each locality.
28. ?Of not less importance is the means of removing disabled guns or carriages
and bringing up others. If the battery is open and communication good, there is
room for the ordinary transporting carriages, such as sling waggon and platform
waggon ; but if these means are not applicable, then recourse must be had to
sledges, rollers, skids, and other suitable methods, according to the circumstances
of the case; but every arrangement should be thought of beforehand. Temporary
tramways or rails in rear of a battery may be most useful, and are easily laid.
29. When it is desirable to fire hot hollow shot, a small hole must be dialled
through the plug, to allow of the escape of the heated air.
