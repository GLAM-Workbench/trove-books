INTRODUCTION
MAJOR E. I. C. SCOTT, D.S.O.
O.C. Troops.
H.M.A.T. D 11.
¥~N introducing this Souvenir of the return voyage to our " Bright
Australia yi of several Nursing Sisters and Troops, most of whom
have taken part in active operations on various fronts of this
world war, I beg to thank our joint editors, our cartoonists, also our
numerous contributors, literary wise and otherwise, especially Staff-Sergt.
P. M. Levick, Corpl. W. E. Simpson, Pte. W. P. Weatherall, R.Q.M.S.
F. A. Johnstone, Gnr. H. A. Jones, Gnr. W, J. Saunderson, and Pvt. J. W.
Thompson; also Captain A. Grove (Ship's Master) and Officers of H.M.A.T.
Barambah, for their assistance in the production of this little publication,
which I trust will be appreciated by our comrades of the voyage and their
relatives, and relatives-to-be, whom we hope to find, at the end of their
stoical anxiety, in the pink of health and happiness.


THE EDITORS
Desire to record their thanks to Major E. I. C. Scott, D.5.0., the C.O. of
Troops aboard; for his permission in allowing them to publish this little
Souvenir* also for the kindly manner in which he has facilitated their
work.
They wish especially to thank the following artists, whom they are
indebted to for the black and white illustrations which appear in these
pages:
E.Q.M.-Sergt. F. A. Johnstone
Gunner H. A. Jones,
Gunner W. J. Sandersson,
Private J. W. Thompson.
For photographic work thanks are also due to:
Staff-Sergt. P. M. Levick,
Corporal W. E. Simpson,
Private E. W. WeatheralL
The Editors regret the necessity of leaving out so many contributions,
but the limited time at their disposal for printing compelled them to
confine the Souvenir to its present size.
They are greatly pleased at the enthusiastic manner in which the
suggestion of producing this Souvenir has been taken up, and trust that it
may be valued in after years as a little memento of what, to most of us,
is the closing episode in our active participation in the Great World War.
The Editors wish you, one and all, good luck, and trust that health,
happiness and prosperity may follow you all to a ripe old age. Kia Oral
........... ..

AT SEA.
" Our Heritage."
What doth the British race inherit?
Stout muscles and a sinewy heart,
Hardy frames and hardier spirits,
Sons of true men, they play their part
In every war, or gentler art;
A heritage it seems to me,
The Hun can never hold in fee.
In every land, qn every sea,
They stand for Right, where e'er it be.
Our blood doth flow for righteousness;
Our Sisters suffer martyrdom
Than be by "Kultur " overcome.
This heritage it seems to me
Is British, and must always be.
Lords and labourers —each walk of life,
Shoulder to shoulder in bloody strife,
To break the enemy's yoke of Hell,
To quell their lust of mad possession,
To 'fend the weak against oppression.
A heritage it seems to me
By Grace Divine —forever Free.
E, I. C. SCOTT.
At Sea, 13th June, 1918.
Wanted to Know?
Whether some remarkable cures were
not effected amongst the sick (?) and
the lame quite early in the voyage.
An alarm created by an extra heavy
roll of the ship, just after "D" deck
had settled down for a night's slumber,
saw several of the walking-stick brigade
land home easy winners to the top of
the companion ways, handsomely beat-
ing their supposedly more active com-
rades-in-trouble.
Whether a certain late Anzac police-
man doesn't think bailing up stray
A.W.L.'s in Blighty more profitable
than running a Crown and Anchor
Board.
Whoever is responsible for the supply
of reading matter aboard has shown
real literary taste in the selection of
the books. We notice a volume of the
1875 Cornhill, a 1915 "Sydney Mail,"
and a Bradshaw Railway Guide. Matters
might have been slightly improved,
however, if Gibbons' " Rise and Decline
of the Roman Empire," and Mrs.
Beeton's cookery book had been in-
cluded in the catalogue.
A lucky (?) winner at a "House"
game a few days ago, after being
handed his "divi." and gloomily scru-
tinising _ it for a few seconds, was heard
to inquire whether the proprietor of the
"House" or himself was the winner.
He appeared to think he had received
the commission and the proprietor the
prize.
To the Birmingham Branch
Red Cross Society.
We feel our columns would not be
complete without a few words of appre-
ciation —which we are confident will be
echoed by all the returning soldiers on
D 11 —of the very kindly way we were
entertained by the good Red Cross
people of Birmingham on our way
through from Weymouth to port of
embarkation. Tea, coffee, cakes, fruit,
etc., were provided for us by their
generosity. Many of us have spent
leave at Birmingham, and our final
send-off was quite on a par with the
kindly feeling we have had shown to us
on those occasions. Many thanks from
the men of D 11 to the good ladies and
gentlemen of the " Brummagem"
Branch of the Red Cross Society.—
Kia Ora.

The Lay of the Number Nine.
You may aptly rave of your soldier
brave,
Who- swanks with his gun, and sings;
But here's to the health of the trusty
knave,
Whose "pack " is the First Aid
things!
No glory his in the fighting line,
No nest in the cosy (?) trench;
No " billet " easy half the time
In the farms of the Allied French.
No praise from his mates in the fight-
ing corps—
His feet they dub as "chill,"
And his name is mud —no one adores,
The poor luckless Knight of the Pill.
That's when you are well, but who can
tell,
When you're on the heaving brine,
And your head goes round, and you
murmur " Hell!
Make haste with the Number Nine ! "
(By Staff-Sergt. D. I. Spencer,
out of Berrima Souvenir.)
A Few Smiles ( ?)
S.M.O. to Pte. Leadswinger after
Final Board): Well! and what's yeur
trouble, my lad?
Pte. L.: Noises in the head, sir.
5.M.0.: What are they like?
Pte. L. : Like a band playing, sir.
5.M.0.: Ump! What tune does it
play?
Pte. L. : "Home, Sweet Home," sir.
5.M.0.: Well, its the wrong tune;
should be the " Marseillaise," as you are
going back to France.
((Collapse of Pte. Leadswinger.)
Note.—Editor: Some beat the 5.M.0.,
anyway, as they are on this boat.

BUGLER.
The Plea.
Lord, when the evening closes,
And I stand
With eager fearful hands, towards
Heaven's far shore,
Bring me no gift of roses, as
The sand
Runs out, to run again for me no more.
But give me one clear hour at close of
day,
And whisper as the darkening shadows
fall,
The inames of friends I've lost along
the way,
The faithful friends I can no more re-
call.
And while their names upon my lips
are set,
Oh, speed the silent tides that I must
stem,
That, ere again I slumber or forget,
I may begin my eager quest of them.
We think our readers will appreciate
the enterprise which Bressler, the Ad-
vertising Contractor, has shown in secur-
ing all our advertising space for his
clients. It is probably unique for a
paper published at sea to publish ad-
vertisements. We trust our readers will
support those firms who have patronised
your own paper by advertising therein.
IN THE BARBER'S CHAIR.
(With profound apologies to "John
Bull.")
'Aircut or shave, sir? Shave, sir;
righto. Yus, sir, you aint got too
much 'air; ort to try our 'air restorer,
sir. Who did you say you was? Oh,
the C.O. Troops of the " Barambah."
Pleasure to shave yer. I thinks you are
playing the game to do yer best to let
the boys off at the C'ape; 'opes they re-
pay yer consideration. They oughter. So
yer thinks Crown and Anchor aint fair,
but believes in this ere Race Game.
Cawn't quite foiler yer argiment, but

jerks don't seem too popular. Thanks,
sir, much obliged. Oos next? That
Parson Bloke, I think. 'Air cut and
shampoo, sir. Right. What; yer say
yer aint a Parson bloke, but the Padre?
Well, oughten yer to be down with
the lads, chattin' to them and 'elpin
them to make up gimes and conserts,
etc., to cheer 'em up a bit. What yer
say, yer do go down some times? Yus,
but only to pinch Crown and Anchor
boards. Sorry, sir, but I cut yer quite
accidental. Next, please.
What, you're the bugler and yer
wants a shave? Well, I guess ye've
got some source to call yerself a bugler,
you 'ave. Yer do make an 'orrible row
at times. You're done, sir; it don't
take me long ter take the 'air off a
glass bottle, yer see. Next shave,
please. Oos next? Come along, ooever
yer are. Oh, you are in the chair.
Sorry, I didn't see yer. Yer so small.
Why, yer must be nearly as small as
this ere Sergeant Caterer Levoi that
they talks about. A good sport, they
sez, and terrible clever. Wot 'e don't
know about steak and onions or any
other subject aint worth knowing.
Wots that; yer 'im? Well, hi never;
'ow about gettin' up some more con-
serts. You are, yer say, good. . Yer
done now, sir. My word, them suspen-
ders are just it. I suppose yer sister
lent them to yer. Next gent, please.
Good day, sir. Yer wants a shave
and yer 'air cut so as to disguise yer,
sir. Righto, sir. Oh, I see, yer the
A.P.M. and wants ter go round sort of
camooflaged so as the blokes won't
rekernise yer, and you'd be able ter
pinch a few Crown and Anchor boards.
Bit risky, aint it, yer job? But I aint
finished yer, sir. What's that, yer say?
Yer won't stop in me chair to be in-
sulted. Well, I'm sorry, sir; but we
always speaks our mind in this shop.
Next, please.
I seems to know your face. Oh, yer
the Red Cross bloke. Yus, ye've got
a good job,' I should say. . It don't
make yer sweat too much, do it? That
there clobber yer dished out at the
start was some cop—fair dinkum.
That's Haustralian, aint it? Next gent,
please. 'Arf a mo, sir, while hi
strengthen the chair, sir. Yer must be
close on 20 stone; but still yer a good
sport. I knows yer well. Hit don't
make no hodds ter me if yei; are a
John Hop in Melbourne; yer lays fair
hodds aboard and plays straight. Yer
worth losin' a bob or two, to, to listen
to. No thanks, sir, I won't charge yer
nothink; but yer can lay us 20 to 1
Wedge next time she wins.
Sorry, sir, too late, just closin'.
Carnt stop, even if 'yer are Lieut.
Kennedy-Smith. I'm just off around
the corner to stick the day's tikings on
the old name of the game. May see
yer there, you say? Righto, I'll tip

Good-night.

"MADE IN GERMANY."
This Transport " Barambah" was originally known as the S.S. " Hobart" of the German-Australian Line.
She was one of Twenty enemy-owned Vessels interned in Australian waters on the outbreak of War—Nineteen being
German and one of Austrian origin. These were principally named after our Capital Cities, and Islands of the Dutch East
Indies—a few being blessed with names from the u Faderland." ~
The Masters and Crews of these Vessels are still interned in Australia.
These Ships were converted into Troop and Horse Transports and put into Commission by the Naval Department
under orders of the Commonwealth Government, being re-named after Towns and Stations of Australia. Recently they
were transferred to the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers, consisting in all of 35 Vessels. Since December, 1914,
these Vessels have taken an active part in the transport of our Troops and Horses to all Allied Countries : being manned
principally by Australians.
Out of the Twenty Vessels originally converted from enemy to our service, only Two have been lost, viz.,
the '• Boorara " and the " Conargo, " which were torpedoed in May this year off the Coast of England.

SPORTS MEETING.
A most enjoyable sports meeting was
held on Saturday afternoon, June 22,
and continued on the afternoon of the
24th. Valuable prizes were presented
by the Red Cross Society's representa-
tive on board.
Proceedings opened with the tug-of-
war competition. Naturally, as was to
be expected on a convalescent ship,
there were not a great many entries
for this. Nevertheless, some good pulls
were provided. The winners proved
to be the team captained by Scrgt.
Miles, and included Sergts. Schrader,
Dorian, Parsons, Cole and Seton-
Stewart, beating in the final pull the
team captained by Corpl. Temby.
In the cigarette race, Pte. Lewis was
first and Corpl. O'Neill second. The
obstacle race proved an exciting event
and was won by Pte. Vincent, with
Pte. Stalder the runner-up. Sergt.
Walsh captured the biscuit race, with
Corpl. Waller second.
The "spar fight " created great
amusement as well as excitement. The
victors proved to be Ptes. Bullivant
and Logan, who were first and second
respectively. The potato race was won
by Pte. Whitfield, the runner-up being
Pte. Macalister. The apple dive
brought to light, Ptes. Pepper and
Bickerton as numbers one and two.
The ccck fight brought forth Pte. Reed
and Sergt. Miles as winner and second.
Proceedings terminated with the bun
fight, Pte. Bickerton beating Pte. Daw-
son by about one chew. The consola-
tion prize was awarded to Pte. Simp-
son, who was "the smallest competitor
in the cock fight and really deserved it
for his pluck, having to compete
against some Goliaths.
The prizes were presented, in the un-
avoidable absence, owing to indisposi-
tion, of Major Scott, C.O. of Troops,
by Lieut.-Col. Comtek.
During the meeting a tug-of-war
match took place between the ship's
officers and the military officers, cap-
tained respectively by Mr. Evans and
Mr. Davie. Betting calculations were
completely upset by the victory, con-
trary to general expectations, of the
military team. Results of a second
meeting will be found on another page.
We have noted with great pleasure
how keenly and anxiously all the men
and N.C.O.'s await the two daily
periods allotted to Physical Jerks. As
the hour approaches, watches are con-
tinually pulled out, and the men can
hardly curb their impatience until the
happy (??) moment arrives. It is really
a God-send to them, as it takes them
away from the monotony of Crown and
Anchor, House, and other forms of
manual labour.
A VERSE TO ABSENT ONES.
I wish I could travel by letter,
And sit by your side as of old,
One clasp of your hand would be better
Than messages written in gold.
F. A. S.
Kapers of the Kyarra Koves.
Submarine Joe, who was a mepiber of
the crew of the Kyarra, and commonly
known as "Dirty Dick," came onto this
Planet about 26 years ago. Until quite
recently he managed to dodge the Rain,
and was never so happy as when on the
Desert, there being* no water there. Our
sympathy is extended to this unfortunate
member of our crew on his being forced
to have a bath when the Kyarra was
torpedoed.

It was most unfortunate for the
Kyarra to get torpedoed; but fortunate
for some of the girls of Tilbury, in
having the local male population swell-
ed by SO' many extra handsome eligibles
billeted there for a week. One of the
fortunate maids of Tilbury succeeded in
catching the "Catch of the Season,"
viz., W. Lombard, who proposes to re-
turn to Tilbury at an early date, and has
requested C. McGifford to act as best
man.

Answers to Correspondents.
By H.G.D.S.
(Correspondence Editor).
Seasick.— Yes, one of Q.-M.S. Dobson's
legs is both alike.
C.O.—Five days' pay.
Everybody.—Your question, who
saw the Anglo-Mexican sink?" is cen-
Debater.—s, s£, 6, 6f, 7, 8, 9, 11.15,
10 11 or 11.952 knots depends on the
weather chiefly, and the amount of coal
in the bunkers.
Anxious.— No, the Orderly Room is
not a Weather Bureau. *
M.0.—(1) You confuse antiscorbutic
pneumo-cardiac associations with Jalap
molecules. (2) M. and D.
Enquirer.—Yes, Sergt. Schrader s
partiality for jam originates from pre-
war days.
A P M.—Decidedly ; gambling on
board is STRICTLY prohibited, except
in the officers' quarters, which is out
of bounds" to all troops.
Fr. ' Donegan.—Do exactly the op-
posite the Military require of you; in-
variably you'll be right. .
Sister. —I heartily sympathise with
you, A tramp steamer's engines do re-
quire oiling at times. Why not strike
for more consideration from the
authorities? .
Ship's Caotain.—(l) Couldn t tell you.
But from various atmospheric conditions
we were off the coast of Switzerland
eight days ago, and no doubt the
Bolivian heights were seen to starboard
yesterday. The presence of Portuguese
warships denotes a position somewhere
near the Equator. (2) Due to Red Tape.
Steward —There are not enough
dinner calls on board. The bugle for
Cook House, Sergeants' Mess and
Officers' Mess, and the gong are in-
sufficient. Couldn't a brass band play
the calls better? .
Signaller—The varied bunting does
not denote that the Kaiser is dead or
Berlin is bombed; just more military
mysteries. ,
Violinist.—At the orchestral rehearsal
there were no cat-calls or dog fights.
The moment you're apparently alluding
to was the inharmonious, unmelodie
rendering of the famous hymn, " Baby s
footprints in the butter."
Knowall.—Her Sovereign Majesty
the Good Queen Anne is Dead.
Stiff. —Do unto others as yer would
be couldn't, but how could yer, wouldn t
when yer are.
Cook.—Spanish Soup: Two quarts of
water and one onion. Digestive Meal:
Soaked Birdwood's wafers. Tea: One
pinch tea, eight pints lukewarm water,
three handfuls of dried seaweed, sugar
(if obtainable), and colour with chalk.
Plum Duffs: If overcooked use for re-
pairing boiler supports.
I.P.L. —Yes, S.M. Bremmell was at
Messines, Piozeres, Moquet Farm, Cam-
brai, Zeebrugge, Littlemoor, London,
Mesopotamia, Kamskchalka, Paris,
Trentino, Ypres, and Albert, but mostly
well behind the line, except at Wey-
moutlj, where he was on the Front.
FOUND. —A crown and anchor
board.—Owner apply to Padre.

Concert.
Under the patronage of Major Scott,
our Commanding Officer, and the direc-
tion of Sergt. Levoi, a very enjoyable
concert was given on the aft main deck
on Tuesday evening, June the 18th.
Sergt. Schrader was at the piano. The
concert proper was proceeded by'a gen-
eral "Sing-song."
Items worthy of special comment were
as follows: "Roses," rendered by Mr.
Wright (baritone), of the Ship's Staff.
Mr. Wright has a pleasing voice, and
well deserved the encore he received,
for which he gave "My Little Irish
Girl." Pte. Ingham (bass) gave "A
Soldier's Song," and for an encore his
old favourite, "The Bandelero." Lieut. -
Col. Conrick favoured the audience with
a good old song, "Nelson's Gone a-'Sail-
ing," and for the encore sang "The
Bells of St. Mary's," the audience join-
ing in the chorus. Both songs were ren-
dered with feeling and sympathy. Corpl.
Gardiner sang " Dreams of Long Ago "
and was encored. Lieut. Dodds, who is
apparently a favourite judging by his
reception, sang a good old-timer, "The
Veteran's Song," with considerable ex-
pression, and also received a well-
merited recall. Humorous items were
contributed by Mr. Holland, who sang
"Gpod-byee," and Lieut. Kennedy-
Smith, who recited a rather fareial story
of some comedy or tragedy—it was
rather hard to discover which —supposed
to be enacted in the battlefield.
Other items were a musical mono-
logue, "Spotty," by Pte. Ilee (?); a
humorous (?) recitation by Corpl. Waller
entitled "A Tale of the Nose "; a cor-
net solo by Pte. Challen, and a clario-
net solo by Mr. Adams, who appeared
to have some difficulty in keeping his
instrument in tune. An enjoyable
evening had been spent, when the pro-
ceedings terminated with the National
Anthem.
A Mess from 26 Mess.
A source of annoyance to the boys of
this Mess is caused by the use and mis-
use of the drinking water tap adjacent
to their premises.
A SHARP lookout is kept for the
offenders, and they are asked to BAR-
RETT or they will BRAC-HER. They
give the taps some hard KNOX at
times. MALCOLM blows his HORN
about it, and LAWTON, who has a
few POUNDS-BUR-ied, intending to
WED when he arrives, puts in a word
occasionally. It would be a BOON to
get the tan shifted, or the boys will
be getting into HOLT's over it. But
let such trifles worry for the
comine MORRIS (Morrows) will bring
us GOLDEN days in the homeland,
and we shall all be SHERRINGHAM
(sharing 'em).
E.F.B.
(Horrible, Ed.)
We have been asked whether the
Orderly Sergeant wears a wig, or if
his hair is entirely his own. We sug-
gest that our correspondent inquire
personally.
Cum Tree Land.
English, skies may be serene ;
English meadows verdant green;
England's Spring be never seen
In Gum Tree Land.
But give me the bluer skies,
Kookaburras and Magpies,
Of the fairer Paradise,
In Gum Tree Land.
F.T.S.
MAL DE MEE.
Rumours and Inquiries.
IT is rumoured that Pte. Law, marine
dealer, very nearly lost his Licence
through handing into the Canteen a
couple of kerosene and one tomato
sauce bottle among his empties.
We hear that the members of the
Mess have cne and all joined
the "Anti-Gramophone League." We
believe that the Staff of the Dispensary

A correspondent inquires why every-
body seems to prefer sleeping in another
person's hammock instead of their own.
Can any reader supply the reason for
this very prevalent peculiarity?
Apology to Numerous
Correspondents.
The Chief Steward, having seen a
previous publication of ours produced
on another ship, and noticing the
rather pointed remarks anent the
quality of the concoction served out as
tea, extracted a promise from our Edi-
torial lips that we should let him down
lightly in this present issue. We re-
gret, therefore, we are unable to print
the ma>ny letters sent us on the sub-
ject, though we agree with them all.
Wanted to Know.
If a certain member of the Ship's
Staff still has "his funny little ways,"
even tho' he does not take intoxicating
liquor? Arq we (w)right?
Whether Warrant Officer (12th class —
or, as Levoi says, no class) Bremmell
really expects his audience of a night
down aft believe his "true" War
stories ?
t S.P. was asked the following ques-
tion, and would like to know if the
Editor could supply the answer: "Is
the S.iS. Barambah too large to enter
Sydney Harbour, or is the boat not
worth having in ' Our Arbour ' ? (You
don't drag us into this sort of argu-
ment.—Ed.)
Is the Canteen Sergeant really as
tired as he appears to be ?
Why does Georgie Payne, the Spud

"THE SONG OF 27."
We are sporty lads and cheery
In Twenty-seven Mess,
And shouts of ribald laughter
Are indications that express
The care-free, boyish banter—
Reaction of Mars' stern stress.
We'll explain just where we come from,
Who we are, and what we do;
In plain Australian lingo, then
You'll know it's Dinkum, too.
We come from New South, Vie and
South
And the land of Cane and Roo.
Now there's Campbell, goes deep down
below,
Wresting the treasures of Mother Earth,
Seeking for gold and worldly wealth,
Sweating and swearing, losing health.
Shillings for self and pounds for master,
Mere thought of this, Bob works the
faster.
Casey lives at Caulfield,
Training horses, so it's said.
Goes out at early morning
When others are still in bed;
He likes it when his geegees win,
If only by a head.
Then we have an insurance agent
From up beside Our 'Arbour;
I guess he missed his calling,
For he should have been a barber,
With his parlez vous and la frousay
And his froggy name, Eugene Doopray.
Falkingbridge we rarely see,
'Cept round our festive board;
He's busy raking in the kudoes
Like a miser with his hoard.
He drinks the ale of Carlton, too,
And trots around with a tart called ;Sue.
Fader stands upon a box
In what is called "The Ring."
He lays the odds against the horse
Whilst to his bag he'll cling.
He knows his job from A to Z
There'll be a pile when his will is read.
There is Fogarty of Bendigo,
Some tinpot town in Vic.
No matter what his calling is,
Enough that he's a brick.
He has blue eyes and auburn hair.
And of this world's good things two
men's share.
Jimmy Incledon, of Wil-laura,
Done the map to see his Aunt Deborah.
A tradesman of the hammer and saw,
He says he's not going to war anymore.
He's returning to his far-famed Yarra
To hawk wild rabbits and wheel a
barrer.
Young Mason has a handle
To his name. They call him Claude,
Tis said he romped in Blighty
With a dame who's name is Maude,
But I guess he's Someone's Hero
Returning from abroad.
Hanson is a farmer,
With acres good and broad,
Serving in the capacity
Of Butter-King abroad.

A eucher tournament commenced on
" D " Troop deck last Wednesday even-
ing, 26th June, and finished on Tuesday,
2nd July; 1918. Keen competition exist-
ed between the different messes, the
winning' pair from each mess playing
the wiquing pair, from another. Ahe
afternoons were enjoyably passed. No.
15 Mess ran out winners—(l) Ptes, Hope
and McCarthy; No. 14 second—(2)
Corpl. Waller and Pte. Leedham. Prizes
were donated by the Australian Red
Cross Society.
We feel it incumbent upon us to ex-
press in these pages the thanks of all
hands aboard to the Wireless Staff for
their kindness in making available the
daily news. As it is purely a gratuitous
act of courtesy on their part, we feel
particularly grateful.
The information has filtered through
to us that the Second Engineer is an
exceptional elocutionist, and we should
like to hear him on his favourite topic:
"Language: Its Use and Abuse."
We hear on good authority that the
Fourth Engineer hopes to celebrate his
16th stone by the end of this trip. If
this hope is realised it will greatly en-
hance his value as an anchor in a tug-
of-war.
It is commonly stated that a certain
Sergeant on board is on terms of con-
siderable intimacy with the Ship's Chef.
His condition certainly does not belie
that rumour. One guess only. (We
are touching wood, Mac.)
54 and 56 Messes
Are the "Light Diet" Messes, where,
according to themselves, only dinkum
invalids are admitted. Gastric lead-
swingers need not apply. 56 Mess (No.
1 Diet) are applying to Sister King for
chop-sticks to enable .them the better
to devour the large quantities of rice
dished up at every meal.
These two Messes resemble a bear
garden very often, the burning question
being who is on No. 2 diet and who
on No. 1?
They boast they are the most distin-
guished Messes on "D" deck, having
a late Imperial Indian Army officer
amongst them and also an eminent (??)
engineer and inventor as a Mess Or-
derly.
When Sergeant Seton-Stewart is in an
argumentative mood, he asks: "Are
there any complaints?" Jock of the
Whiskers invariably supplies the Oppo-
sition.
It is rumoured that a member of 54
Mess —a budding L.L.B.—has left such
a great attraction behind at Weymouth
that he intends returning to Europe
even though it means fighting the nasty
Hun again. The ardour of youth is
delightfully refreshing.
We believe that the late Records
Clerk at Littlemoor, who is numbered
amongst us now, did not find his entry
into the "House" Syndicate particularly
profitable.
We would like to know whether Mess
Orderly McDonell talks for the love of
hearing his own voice or whether he
is getting in form for domestic argu-
ments later on. Our unbiassed sym-
pathies are all with his wife.
The arduous work of Canteen Assis-
tant seems to agree with our South
Australian squatter. Fostering jum-
bucks will be child's play compared to
juggling Schweppes' lemonade and
Woodbines.
According to conversations overheard,
the grill-rooms at our next port of call
will be well patronised by the ilien too
delicate to eat ordinary diet or meat
on board ship.
One of our members is Sergeant
masquerading as a private. Such mod-
esty is rare on Dll, though there are
a great many privates camouflaged with
three stripes.
On the night of June 20th a heavy
tropical rain and thunderstorm caused
a hurried evacuation of those fresh
air lovers who sleep on deck. Drench-
ed figures in pyjamas, carrying rain-
soaked blankets down to the . more shel-
tered regions of 'tween decks, caused
great hilarity amongst those who were
comfortably ensconced in their hammocks
below. One portly N.C.O. whose chest
has slipped down somewhat, arrived in
his mess in a. wringing wet shirt (which
could decently have been 6 inches or
so longer) and minus the most import-
ant part of his pyjatnas. /We would
give our next two days*" pay to see him
portrayed as a modern interpretation
of the well-known painting, "The Bath
of Psyche."
A Grand Concert will be held in the
Officers' Mess in the 96th week of the
voyage. The following is the suggested
programme: • - .
1. Chorus, "We've done with
swinging the lead"
By Grand Chorus Party of

True Copy of PROCLAMA-
TION issued to the IRISH
PRISONERS OF WAR at
Lemberg Camp, Germany,
in the Year 1915.
Irishmen,
Here is a chance for you to
fight for Ireland. You have fought for
England, your country's hereditary
enemy, you fought for Belgium in Eng-
land's interests, though it Was no more
to you than the Fiji Islands.
Are you willing to fight for your
own country, with a view to securing a
national freedom of Ireland, with the
moral and material assistance oi» the
Gerrhan Government.
Ah Irish Brigade is being formed.
The object of the Irish Brigade shall be
to fight nobly the cause of Ireland, and
under no circumstances shall it be
directed to any German end.
The Irish Brigade shall be formed,
and fight under the Irish Flag alone,
the men shall wear a distinctive Irish
uniform, and shall have Irish Officers.
The Irish Brigade shall be fed,
clothed, and efficiently equipped with
arms and ammunition by the German
Government. It will be stationed near
Berlin, and treated as guests of the
German Government.
At the end of the War, the German
Government undertakes to send each
member of the Irish Brigade, who may
so desire it, to the United States of
America, with necessary means to land.
The Irishmen in America are collect-
ing money for the Brigade.
Those who do not join the Brigade,
will be removed from Lemberg, and
distributed amongst other Camps.
NOTE.—In response to this stirring
appeal, about 50 men out of nearly
three thousand joined the Irish Bri-
gade.
How is the German Government
going to send these 50 to America?

Temby for the copy of the above Pro-
clamation, which we here reprint. Cor-r
poral Temby has just lately been re-
patriated from Germany. While it is
well known that the Germans appealed
to* the Irish prisoners to fight against
England, we do not think the above
Proclamation has appeared in print,
and think it will prove interesting to
our readers, who are fairly well
acquainte4 with the underhand meth-
ods of the Germans. —Ed., "Birambah

We have heard an old song repeat-
edly sung with great gusto during the
trip. It is said to have been quite
plainly heard around the 6th Engineer's
ventilator. The title is, by the way,
"There's going to be a wedding in

fears that the covert (hie) position may
not have been his good fortune, as

accused was congratulated for produc-

PRECIS OF TRIP.
Weymouth was left in the early
hours of the morning of June 6th.
Farewell greetings weie waved to the
troops by the many friends that they
left behind. An interesting trip
through beautiful England was broken
by a stay of about half-an-hour at
Birmingham, where the local Red Cross
Society provided much welcomed re-
freshments for us Port of embarka-
tion was reached about 5.30 p.m. on
the same day, and the troops proceeded
straight aboard the Dll, which was to
be their home for the next couple of
months. We all soon settled down in
our new abode. If we found her not
entirely adapted to transport work, we
realised, however, that the exigencies
of war and the shortness of tonnage
might have given us a much worse
vessel. On board we found as ship-
mates the crews of the torpedoed
vessels Kyarra and Era, who were re-
turning to Australia ; also a number of
war workers going back.
During the 7th of June we remained
in stream, and were privileged to see
a large convoy of enthusiastic Ameri-
cans arrive. We felt that with numbers
like that arriving week by week as
they do with consistent regularity, we
could afford to feel confident as to the
ultimate outcome of the war.
About 9 a.m. of the morning of June
Bth our convoy moved out. Fine
weather was experienced the first day.
June the 9th, our second day out, was
probably the most eventful of the
voyage. In the early hours of the
morning, the submarine alarm was
given. Our escort soon cleared trouble
away, not without damage being done,
however. Luckily, our boat was not
the victim. The day proved fairly
rough and cases of mal-de-mer were
pretty numerous. After a few days out
the convoy divided, our portion con-
sisting of our own boat and Dl 2 and
another cargo steamer, together with
escorting vessel. On June 14th we
were left to our own devices and lost
sight of our companions. The line
was crossed on Sunday morning, June
23rd. There has been nothing of fur-
ther great event to report up to reach-
ing Cape Town, where we go to print
(July 4t!i).
Weather on the whole .has been fine,
with the exception of one night, when
we ran into a heavy rain and thunder-
storm, and the deck sleepers had a
gratuitous bath. The days have been
varied with concerts, sing-songs, sports
meetings, card tournaments, and let it
only be whispered, a quiet gamble—or
if you like gambol—now and again. On
Sundays, like the respectable individ-
uals we are, we had our church ser-
vices, which were well attended. An
enjoyable time was spent at Cape Town
by the men, who were soon making
friends with the inhabitants and seeing
all the sights.
It is. History always repeats it-
self. In ancieat Biblical Days Samson
escape 1 from the Philistines. We
learn he also escaped from them quite
recently aboard this ship.

THE OLD PROVERBIAL.
When Percy first joined the ranks of
the A.I.F. he was nothing if not gen-
teel in all his conduct and conversa-
tion. The bonhommie and the bush
eloquence of the troops repelled him.
"I don't mind roughing it," he told
Mania at home in Toorak; "but the
speech of the men is perfectly horrid."
" Oh, my poor Percy, you must be-
come an officer," said Mama.
But Percy, though an unqualified
dude, had neither the ambition nor the
outstanding genius which, as "tout le
monde " knows, is so requisite to the
attainment of a star. And as the in-
evitable tendency in all the walks of
life is assimilation, Percival soon learnt
that he was unconsciously adapting him-
self to the manners, habits and figures
of speech of the formerly reviled troops.
Indeed, eventually he began to employ
the latter with considerable gusto.
And when he came hornp, labelled
"B2 b," he was as much "one of the
boys " as any of them.
Percy's Mama and his maiden aunt
and his sister Gertie were quick to
notice the change in him.
"It's been partickler rough 'ouse,"
said Percy, "but takin' it all round,
I've had a bonzer time, fair dinkum."
Mama and Aunt Prudence opened
their eyes very wide indeed. ;So did
Gertie, but her surprised expression
gradually changed to a roguish and
sympathetic twinkle. But Mama and
Aunt Prudence were considerably at a
loss to understand this curious new,
crude language that their formerly im-
maculate Percy had learnt to speak.
Seeing their perplexity, Percy laughed
as only a soldier can laugh.
"The boys soon kidded me on,
Mum," he explained.
It was that horrid infantry—Mama
and Auntie both agreed. Whereupon
Mama asked:
"What became of your application,
Percy, to be transferred to Headquar-
ters at Horseferry-road ? "
"Oh, that," said Percy; "that came
a " But here Percy recollected
himself just in time.
Mama and Aunt Prudence are still
wondering w r hat was the new crude
Metaphor of the troops Percy was about
to give utterance to.
But sister Gertie could give a very
shrewd guess.

An Appreciation.
We feel this publication would be
quite incomplete if we failed in its
columns to express the warm apprecia-
tion w T hich we have for the men in blue
of both Services. In particular we wish
to express our kindly sentiment to those
into whose care we are committed dur-
ing" the present voyage. It is due to
their skill and care * that we have been
brought .through danger to comparative
safety. The usual perils of their call-
ing are now multiplied tenfold by the
menace of submarines, raiders and
mines. Not for one voyage only, but
for voyage after voyage they keep the
proud old "Jack" of Britain proudly
afloat on every sea, suffering every
danger and personal discomfort with
the same patience and good humour
which is characteristic of them in all
conditions.
Le't us, therefore, here assure them
of our sincere appreciation of their
efforts in the common cause, expressing
the hope that as the men of the past
and present, so may in future be the
officers and men of the Mercantile
Marine.
"92 NOT OUT."
Without doubt we are a most cosmo-
politan crowd on board this Homeward
bound Transport—the young, middle-
aged, even those who have reached the
"evening of life," hailing from almost
every clime under the sun. The great
majority, of course, are "Aussie
Born," boasting of a Chief with pat-
riarchial beard and majestical mien;
with him, then, this brief sketch is cen-
tred. Born in the "Land of Strikes
and Sunshine," on the Ist of February,
1826, a few miles outside Camden,
N.S.W., George holds just claim, to the
title of " Dinkum." By profession a
"horse and ox-conductor," that is ac-
cording to the vernacular of the pre-
sent ; in the Olden Days George was
known as a "Carrier." Many exciting
experiences happened! along his way in
the "rollicking old days," when cross-
ing the woodless, waterless, stretches of
the "Old Man"- and other black soil
plains. Bushrangers were the terror
of the days gone by, but George had
the luck to escape the personal attention
of Morgan, Power, Flowers, Thunder-
bolt, and the Kellys, all of whom
reigned in the near neighbourhood of
his daily "team wanderings." However,
he had a hand once in his lifetime with
the "Men of the Bush," information
being imparted by him which led to the
ultimate capture of the outlawed gang.
The writer has looked on the grave of
the leader, who was killed near Gul-
gong in his last encounter with the
police. To our " Aussie' Chief," his days
as a carrier were the happiest of his
long and honourable life; the days
when, to use "Bulletin lingo," it was:
"Get over Brindled Strike me pink!
You 'fraid ye'll bust a blanky link
By tuggin' at the chain?
Come bend your necks and dip yer toes,
And up she rises—screamin' woes!
A turn or two an' down she goes
Right to her naves again!
Now, then, you beauties, shoulders up;
Hang to her like a scrappin' pup-
Pull till yer muscles crack!
Whoa, Blucher! Hang you, help yer
mate,
Or square yer yoke at any rate;
There ain't no time'to meditate
On thisi bog-blinded track."
Our "Aussie Chief " is 92 Not Out. By
his present appearance he will "go
strong " into his second century. As his
picture above shows, he is still hale
and hearty. " Some two years ago he
left the land of his birth on a run across
the mighty deep to see his brother, also
well-advanced in years. His wiry
frame stood the test of one of England's
most severe winters, but at last " War
Tucker" decided him to return to the
Land of Plenty, hence his presence with
us, "Homeward Bound."
"So here's To-ee,
Warrior of Black Soil Plain;
Lift it high,
Drink it dry,
To your days of whip and chain,
A loud Coo-ee."

THE HERO OF BULLYFROC
FLAT.
There's a place on the Barisom called
Bullyfrog Flat,
Where they're most patriotic (wave
flags, and all that),
And a wild sort of cocky named Patrick
O'Dean,
Came to town and enlisted, in nineteen
fifteen.
He was rough, rude and ready, his wife
was the same,
She'd the tongue of a shrew, and—
mind, Paddy was frame.
Yet folks said that he'd rather face
Fritz all his life
Than have a set to with his jewel of a
wife.
But 'twas all beer and skittles when
Pat sailed away
(Faith, they talk of the send-off up
there to this day).
They cheered Pat O'Dean from his
boots to his hat,
As he kissed wife and kids and left
Bullyfrog Flat.
Well, you've heard how Paddy made
good out in France—
Bullyfrog Flat knows how Pat led the
Kaiser a dance—
How he charged a battalion and cap-
tured Von Klock,
And got over to Blighty "toot sweet"
with a knock.
'T'was a sweet little woutnd on the curve
of the knee,
A cert, they told Paddy at Havre, for
C three.
They took him to London. In hospital
there
Old Pat met the Duchess of Cavendish
Square.
We all know how Duchesses worship the
boys
Who've come over from Aussie (it really
annoys).
How they ipester and beg one to after-
noon tea,
Oh. there's many a duchess has made
love to me!
This old Duchess was tony, and high-
class and fat,
But she took a most wonderful fancy
to Pat.
The result was—our hero was well in
the boom,
And spent most of his time in the
Duke's arawing-room.
Soon old Pat got quite haughty, he
stopped smoking clay pipes,
And would say, "Oh, by Jove, now,"
instead of "By Cripes."
He erot pants made to order in Horse-
ferrv Road,
And his tailormade tunic was quite
"a la mode."
Next they moved him to Weymouth,
where Pat showed his knee
To Charlie, who gracefully marked him
C three.
Then he uot oin. a Hospital Ship (just
like this),
And away sailed old Patrick for Aussie,
and bliss.
Now Pat's English accent had really
"some sting"
(The Duchess had coached him, the
darling old thing).
And the notion that grew in the mind
of old Pat
Was to introduce " culture " to Bully -
frog Flat.
The day he arrived there the town was
"en fete,"
His wife aind the kids met him down
at the gate;
But the difference in Pat made the
missis go slow,
For he'd shaved off his whiskers and
beeswaxed his Mo.
Still she knew him at once, and ex-
pected a kiss;
But Pat says, "Now, Madame, please
understand this,
I've moved in society, high-class and
grand,
Still, you and the children may kiss
my left hand."
The missis just eyed him, with eyes full
of (doom,
Then she sent Patrick's youngest inside
for the broom.
Cripes, it them is yer notions, me lad,
it is plain,
Yer can go fer yer life, back to Blighty
again."
And she made a wild rush, with the
broom held on high,
And Paddy remembered the days long
gone by :
And he turned with a howl, and he
galloned " tout suite "
To the cheers of the people, up Bully-
frog Street.
"Kiss ver hand?" yells the missis, aind
caught him a olio
0n J? 1 ® t side of the head that made
Paddy side-slip,
And he lay there and grovelled, and
yelled "Kamerad,"
And the missis said: "I'll give yer
Duchess, me lad."
Well that taught him a lesson. "Its
no good," thought Pat,
"Trying to introduce culture to Bully-
frog Flat."
So he cuddled his kiddies, and cuddled
his wife,
And remained a plain Cocky the rest
of his life.
Now chaps, when you get home (if
the moral you've missed)
Never tell your best girl of the Tabbies
you ve kissed!

On Saturday, 2'9th June, another en-
joyable sports meeting was held, the
principal feature being the sustained
characters, the best, of which was
Ahmed Abdul, impersonated by Sergt.
Simpson. Second place was gained by
"Old Tom and his Donk." Pte. D'aw-
son, or "Big Lizzie " as a more familiar
term, shone out brilliantly by capturing
the cock fight, potato race, and spar
fight. The apple dip went to Pte. New-
man, and Conroy got away with the
obstacle race, which caused great
amusement to the onlookers, especially
when the competitors came out of the
wind-chute covered with damp flour.
Gnr. Fader won the "Casey " drill,
after a sharp contest with Pte. Murray.
The Sports Committee desire to thank
heartily nurses, C.0., S.M.O. and other
officers for their kind help in the
judging of events and for their gener-
osity in donating the prize money.
We think the 'Ship's Orderly Room
Typist might; have exercised a little
more care in typing our Routine Orders
some days ago. We were a little
startled to read that the Nurses', Offi-
cers' and Crew's "Garters " were placed
out of Bounds. An urgent inquiry at
the Orderly Room elicited the fact that
" Garters " should have read " Quart-
ers." We were much relieved at the ex-
plantation.—Honi soit qui mal y pense.
Yes, my boys. Our forces have done
great work. We have beaten the sub-
marine; we have beaten the German
gas; but not the Crown and Anchor.
Oh, no. We wish the Flying Corps suc-
cess on the Hook.

VALE KYARRA
In pre-war days inter-state travellers
by sea were wont to scan the daily
papers for information concerning the
movements of "coasters," more especi-
ally their own particular favourite. Not
a few were at all times willing to wait
a day or two longer for the sailing of
that trim craft, the "Kyarra," a ves-
sel which established herself a firm
favourite with the travelling public,
especially commercial men, as soon as
she was "placed on the line." War
changes all things, but not so the popu-
larity of the "Kyarra." In peace and
war she maintained her reputation,
against heavy odds, as a "favourite."
Soon after the outbreak of war she
entered upon a special in her
nautical life —-the transport of sick and
wounded soldiers to their homeland,
after doing "their bit" in France or
Egypt. For almost three years Fritz
was dodged; many a gallant craft went
to her doom, but the "Kyarra" seemed
to bear a charmed life. Her adven-
tures were many, her escapes lucky.
Yet, withal, she was destined to be
recorded among the many victims of
Fritz. As a "hospital carrier," under
the mystic title of "D 10," she was
listed for cargo and to embark troops
for the State of W.A. during the early
days of June of this year. Enemy
submarine activity was keen; all neces-
sary precautions were taken to ensure
the safe and secret passage of the
" Kyarra." to the port of embarkatiop;
anchorage was made each night in ap-
parently safe waters, until the dawn
of the third day. Somewhere about 8
a.m. it came, a hissing, speeding ma-
chine of death and destruction.
Amidships it crashed, flying steel and
timber making deadly weapons for those
on board; a miracle it is that so many
escaped. The thundrous, muffled roar
of the explosion, the crash of glass on
the mess-table, and the death-quivering
shudder of the "Old Favourite,"
brought her officials, marine and mili-
tary, from the breakfast table "under
evens." No words were necessary to
explain the happening. Fritz had
scored; the old " Kyarra" was about to
take her downward plunge. Hasty
investigation proved that with some life
had ceased, whilst some were writhing
in agony. Others, again, bore slight
wounds. It was a case for speed, not
panic. Happily that was the result, the
outcome being the saving of every liv-
P ers on on board. All aboard the
lifeboats, hasty retreat was made for
safety; that gained, rowers rested upon
* !l °?fr/ watchin g the last moments
of tne Kyarra" on the surface of the
sea laces were scanned, counted; alas,
back there on the quickly sinking
steamer six members of her crew had
found their last resting place, tallying
correct y with the bodies examined by
medical men before deserting her.
KFtS g• n d u n lurch the "Kyarra"
tilted high above sea-level. She was
going down by the stern. Thus, with
convulsive movements, "she took the

K 7 severely wounded in the
lifeboats were heard to murmur,
Good-bye, Kyarra,' she's gone; good
old Kyarra.' As men awakened
from a dream, the rescued at the oars
bent their backs, with a will, gaining
the shore, about two miles distant,
without mishap. Here a sympathetic
crowd assembled, escorted the uninjured
to a haven of unstinted hospitality,
whilst the wounded found shelter in a
"Home of Comfort and Relief" not
far distant. Lieut. Morrell, Adjutant
to Major Scott, of the "Barambah,"
and Lieut. Baxter, Q.M., held similar
positions on the ill-fated " Kyarra"
when she was torpedoed. We show
here a photo of some of the survivors.

If reports be true, the ship's en-
gineers are looking forward with keen
anticipation to the ship's arrival in
Melbourne, and are hoping to be per-
mitted to assist at the official dressing
of Wee Willie in all his new regalia.
A certain soldier, who is now aboard
this ship, was, just after the Polygon
Wood stunt, writing home to apprise his
people .of his safety. He asked a
mafte sitting alongside him whether he
was not also going to write home. He
implied that he was unable to write, but
would have liked to send a letter to his
girl. Our soldier friend volunteered to
write for him. After taking down a
page and a half and news appearing to
run dry, he asked if there was anything
else to add before he concluded the let-
ter. After a moment or so of con-
sideration the illiterate one replied:
" No, but just say, ' Please excuse the
bad writing.' "
We instructed our black and white
artist to obtain a sketch of the Padre.
After considerable effort the above is
the result.
STANDING ORDERS.
Inspection.—The following will ac-
company the Bugler daily on inspec-
tion : Acting Lance-Corporal of the

Ship's Cat (one to be detailed daily).
Care must be taken not to disturb
Privates laying, reading, or sleeping
upon the hatches.
Gambling.—Gambling between decks
is strictly forbidden. Troops desirous
of a friendly shuffle may obtain the use
of a special room on application to
S.S.M.
Stationery.—No visitor to the Or-
derly Room will leave without taking
as much stationery, etc., as he can
carry. The paper kept in the Orderly
Room is not for official use, but for
the benefit of private individuals.
Y.M.C.A. Piano.—Provided sufficient
potice is given, every effort will be
made to obtain the loan of this instru-
ment from the Officers' Mess, for the

Routine.—The Orderly Officer of the
day may, if he feels so disposed, visit
the troop decks at meal times, to re-
ceive the congratulations of the men on
the par excellence of the meal. Men
must understand it is useless requesting
that rations be cut down. It is hoped
that every effort will be made to eat
the surplus quantity.
(Signed) A. I. FORCE, Capt.,
Adjutant.
The thanks of all aboard are due to
the undermentioned, who constitute the
Recreation Committee: Lieut. Dodds,
Mr. Davie, S'ergts. Miles, Schrader,
Tune, O'Connor and Levoi, Corpls.
Waller and O'Neill, Ptes. Wallace and
Lewis.
During the first week or ten days of
the voyage we were unfortunate in hav-
ing no one to look to for organised
recreation and we all suffered in con-
sequence from ennui.
That has all Ibeen changed by the
above committee. We trust that for
the remainder of the voyage they will
continue to provide for our amusement
in the same successful manner as they
have done up to the present.
While thanking the committee, we
must not overlook including in our
thanks the Sisters, also the Ship's Offi-
cers and others through whose assist-
ance the success of the committee's
efforts have been made possible.
Found.—O.C.: Amongst the Din
kum Soldiers, a Khaki Tourist, who
has never been to France, but wears
battalion colours.—Apply Pte. Seed-

A VOICE FROM " OUT OF
BOUNDS."
In the early days of our voyage it
appeared in R.O.'s that certain por-
tions of our floating home were " Out
of Bounds " to troops, including the
portion allocated to use of "The
Heads," otherwise the Officers., etc. Iu
the language of the Digger, "Out oif
Bounds " means a place where " The
poor bloomin' digger ain't wanted nor
allowed to go." Of course, the Digger
hears and sees a lot that he is not sup-
posed to. Hence the following conver-
sation : Ist Digger: I say, Bill, > yer
ought to seen what I seen last night.
2nd D—: Where abouts? Ist D—:
Augh! up amongst the heads in " Out
of Bounds." 2nd D—: Well, what did
yer see? Ist D—: They was havin a
fancy dress dinner or somefink, but
anyhow they was all all dressed up,
makin out they was what they ain't.
You know the chap what put Blue and
Joe in the Clink fer smokin on, the
troop deck, he was dressed up like a
d—n nigger with a white eye and big
red lips; he looked real natural, too,
is charactur just sooted it, too. Then
there was that other chap what
grabbed the crown and anchor board
and neely got tossed overboard. They
■calis im wing; well, he was there, in
all is flyin togs, but looked somefink
like what I saw the cat chewin yester-
dee. An then there was 5.M.0., the
Col. Bloke; he was dressed up like
soom bloomin French Tart wif a loow
neck blouse and short skirts, but he
looked a bit too flat in the chest for
a skirt. An then there was the Bloke
wif glasses what never stops talkin. I
hears he used to be in Parliment oncet.
They. calls him Smiffy or Kennedy or
somefink like that; he was some Boscli,
I don't fink; he was dressed up in
sooveneers what he borrowed from the
diggers, and you knows O'Niel what
runs the Race game, he lent im is hun
cap and he ain't give it back yet. And
then there was that other chap what
used to be in the Artillery, they calls
him Billy Bates; he was dressed
up like Cardinal Wolesley, and
strike me pink, I fought
it was the Old Chap reserrected sure
enough. He even had the same walk
as e ad in the pictures when he was
executed. Ther was another Chap who
I cant place no how. he was supposed
to be some Bloomin actres. I heard
em callin im Gabby. I dont know , if
he was er or not, but to look at im
or er which ever she was made me fink
of my tart in Blighty wiv er blue gar-
ters and full chest and real dinkum
class legs. none of yer beef to the
ankles bout my tart I can tell yer.
An then there was the O.C. you know
the Major what as the bugler walkin
in front of him playin "Here he comes "
when he goes round the ship every
mornin. e was dressed up like some,
nigger Chief, e reminded me of the
play bloke. I fink e was called the
Rajah or Digger Bill or somefink like
that. An then there was the Chap
what was runin the sports what they
calls Davie. He was just like some
bloomin Sheff what they as in big pubs
what wiv is white close and igh cap
an flour on is face, at first I thought
I had seen im round at some of those
swell joints in London when I was
tryin to< ook some of the waitress tarts.
An then there was the Sisters they was
real dinkum tarts that night, no uni-
forms and stars and caps and red capes.
One was dressed in flags wiv £ll red
tape twisted round er and arfishal cor-
respondence stuck all over her, gee she
was good. An the little one they calls
Pinky cos shes got pink air, she looked
just like if she was going to ride the
bloomin funnel wiv er wip and ard at
and coat and short skirt and ridin
boots etc. I neerly arst er if I could
go fer a ride wiv er. I'd a felt real '
prowd to be seen wiv her in any siety
I can ter yer straight. An then there
was the other one, you knows which
one I means, the nice one what comes
down an sings to us poor bloomin
diggers she was. ; strike me pink,
she was in evenin dress, real silk

Things 11 D " Deck Want to
Know.
What is the real name of the con-
coction Served up to us as tea?
Why there should be any objection
to a man being allowed to rest in com-
,fort for a few minutes in one place?.
Who is the " four-of-a-kind" King?
. If Old Bob is a comedian in civil
life?
Whether it is safe to bet that Phil
O'Neill will be laying the odds at
Flemington next Melbourne Cup Day,
and what odds he'll lay Wedge if she
starts ?
Why the tarpaulins are not thought
of until we are wet through of a night
when it rains ?
Whether some of the tug-of-war com-
petitors intend to re-enlist —evidently
they are now pretty fit ?
Who is the gentleman on this end
of the ship whose language can at
times be cut with a knife and whose
reminiscences blur the electric illumina-
tions?
They say that a certain member of
the Sergeants' Mess is not a dinkum
Aussie. That by " his remarks he only
w6nt out to the Land of Sunshine to ex-
plain to the savage inhabitants the
greatness of <! 'Ome."
Physical jerks aboard this ship beat
any Keystone screamer.
A certain officer, aboard is said to
have developed a most amicable disposi-
tion lately, owing to the proximity of
deep water and the scarcity on deck of
lifebuoys.
Judging by the exhibition of cock-
crowing at a recent concert, the ven-
triloquist m question knows more about
poultry farming than behaviour becom-
ing to a soldier.
The Sanitary Sergeant has acquired a
new dance. This is a "fat-reducing"
stunt.
Two pay-days aboard so far, and no
sore heads. Wb take our pleasures
sadly.
One of the ship's cats has been
crimed. If you want to know the
charge, ask a certain Mess Orderly.
Harmony does not always follow in
the wake of the piano.
