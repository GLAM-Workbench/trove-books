THE TRAITOR?S DOOM!
AN HISTORICAL DRAMA, IN THREE ACTS.
INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.?Although the Mutiny of the Bounty presents one of the most gloomy pages in the
Naval history of our country, it, fortunately, has a bright side, on which the heroic endurance of Captain Bligh and his
brave companions in misfortune, presents itself to our sympathy and admiration, in a light of undying brilliancy, while
it teaches a lesson of self-control, patience, and resignation, not only to those who brave the perils of the ocean, who
are most exposed to trials and privations, but to men in every situation of life, in the hour of affliction. The characters
of Celestia, Solomon, and the Monkey, although entirely fictitious, are necessary for the purposes of variety and
??J~~,~ J I r ~ - ~
dramatic effect.
CHARACTERS REPRESENTED-BRITISH.
?It will naturally be asked, what would be the reason for such a revolt? In answer to which I can only conjecture
that the mutineers had flattered themselves with the hope of a more happy life among the Otaheitians than they would
possibly enjoy in England; and this, joined to some female connexions, most probably occasioned the whole transaction.
The women of Otaheiti are handsome, mild and cheerful in their manners and conversation, possessed of <weat
sensibility, and have sufficient delicacy to make them admired and beloved.?? ?Captain Bligh's Narrative.

Heading the lead?incorruptible sentinel?Mutineer, ? We mean to take the ship, settle on the Island, and make you governor of one of the outposts,
that?s what you?d gain by it.? ?Sentinel (with suppressed surprise) ? I see, but then, what might I lose by it ????Mutineer ? Lose by it! (with
derision) Why, what have you to lose by it ? ? ?Sentinel (with a burst of indignation) ?What have Ito lose by it! My character as a man, and
my honour as a soldier. You have neither, and want to make me as bad as you are, and to bring disgrace on me, and curse my children with a parent's
shame. You have had more learning than I, that I know, but I have that which learning cannot give, nor the want of it take away, and that is, a right
will to be true to the oath I have sworn to God, to be faithful to my King and Country.?

Captain Bligh and Ms Followers sent Adrift in an Open Boat
(To Mutineers) ? Bound and disarmed, we cannot resist, and a dark and dismal fate seems to await us; but remember, this is not the first time we
have faced death on the ocean (a vivid flash of lightning, and heavy peal of thunder) and now again we are threatened with destruction. Degraded
men ! to whom I have always been a good friend. In the dark catalogue of human crimes, ingratitude is uot marked for punishment by man. A vice
so despicable is beneath the dignity of justice, and too vile for human vengeance. But a severer retribution awaits it! An outraged conscience stings
the perpetrator to the end of his detested life. That fate is yours. Ours is uncertain, but your doom is sealed ; the vengeance of an outraged country
will pursue you with the speed of lightning, and end you with a traitor?s death.?

? After having undergone a great deal of ridicule, and kept for some time to make sport for these unfeeling wretches, we were at length east adrift

SOLOMON?S PLACE of BUSINESS on the COAST
The monkey waiter ?a practical illustration of the Darwinian Theory?double dummy in Otaheiti??My father knew the game as well as anybody,
and he always won. He said all the world was a game of whist, and the men and women merely players ; some shuffle, some cut, and one man in his
time plays many games and while many get rich by honours, more make money by tricks.??Solomon?s dream ?'?What a dream I had last night!
I saw the Captain and his men all dead at the bottom of the boat, with the bright moon shining on their white faces ! If such a vision comes to a man
who did them no harm, what dreams must they have who did? I can?t get them out of my head. I shall never forget it, the storm, the burning of
the ship! What a dreadful night! I?ll smoke a pipe; that may cheer me up a hit?(to the pipe) Silent and mysterious friend of the wretched ; how
many troubled minds have been soothed by your incomprehensible influence ? The vapour rises and takes our care away with it for a time, as the last
rapourous sigh of life takes all mortal sorrow with it for ever.?

IN SEARCH OF THE MUTINEERS.
The Mutineers, hi alarm, seek the protection of King Tinah? Chief of the Mountains. ? The prisoners pray you will not give them up to the sea
warriors of England, and they will stay and go with you to battle.? Tinah. ? Tell them no ! I will give them up ; and tell them, too, that Tinah,
and the men of Otaheiti know that those who are false to their own country can never be true to any other.?
THE ISLAND OF TIMOR
Horror of the men ashore on seeing what appears like a boat manned by skeletons?Yan Este. ?Man the boats! Pull for your lives! Lose not a
moment! What do you make out ? ? Spikerman. ? A man wasted to hone, and dying, trying to signal us, waving his hat on a sword.? (A faint cheer
is heard from the approaching ioat) ? Answer that cheer ! Hoist the colours ! Let them know they?re seen! Be ready with your ropes The best
swimmer take one off to the boat, and then haul in from the shore. Who?s the best swimmer here? ? (Six seamen instantaneously exclaim ? I am,?
and dive into the sea with ropes.)
Providential Deliverance of Mligh and his Crew /
AFFECTING SCENE ON THEIR LANDING.
? They reached this Island in forty-one days after leaving Tofoa, having in that time run, by the log, 3,618 miles, with scarcely anything to support
life, without shelter from the weather, and without the loss of a single man. To the prudence and seamanlike qualities of Bligh their safety may be
chiefly ascribed.?? History of the Mutiny.

AT SUNSET. CELESTIA DISCOVERED STANDING ON THE BRINK.
DEATH OF THE CHIEF S DAUGHTER.
?Ue is dead ! and I have sworn not to outlive him, I stand between two great crimes?a false vow, and self destruction. The day declines, and the
sun shrinks from view, as fearing to witness a deed forbidden by his Maker. Farewell, farewell, than ever glorious minister of light and joy. No more
after the gloomy voyage of night wilt thou welcome me to the bright shore of morning. No more will thy lovely beams fall like the kiss of heaven on
my face. Thy golden rays ?that light the fields and flowers with godlike glory, and spread sweet perfume through the smiling land ?I shall rejoice in
no more. No more at thy approach shall my ear be charmed by birds warbling nature?s music in the air, nor see again the leafy boughs dance to their
song. Mighty symbol of thy Creator?s glory, farewell; and oh, vouchsafe to light my erring spirit to the gates of mercy. (The sun sinks) Now, Death,
grim phantom and terror of mankind, whose ghastly image haunts us through life, and is ever present to chill and check all mortal joy; I wait not your
stealthy, dark approach, but turn, in defiance to face you on your deadly march, and dispute your triumph by compelling you to strike when
I command. Cornel I dare you to the battle.?? (She leaps into the Sea)
