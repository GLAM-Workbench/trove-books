Time Tables
The times shown in the Time Tables are those at which th
trains are intended to depart from and arrive at the varion
stations, but the Commissioner will not guarantee those times
nor will he, under any circumstances, be held responsible fo
delay or detention however occasioned, or any consequences arising
therefrom; but such times are so appointed, subject to sue]
alterations or change therein as he may consider it proper ti
make, and the Commissioner retains the right to make sucl
alterations or changes in times of the trains, without bcint
responsible for the consequences thereof of any kind to anj
person travelling or intending to travel thereby.
The trains will, as far as practicable, ordinarily await the
arrival of such trains from other lines as are connected therewith
in the Time Tables, but the Commissioner reserves the right, in
the event of the trains from one line being delayed, either from
this or any other cause, to despatch the connecting trains from the
other lines before their arrival. The hours of arrival and depar-
ture of the trains on other railways, and other through-booking
arrangements, are inserted in the Time Tables for the convenience
of passengers, but the Commissioner will not be responsible for
the regularity of the connection being at all times maintained,
nor for any of the arrangements connected therewith; and it is a
distinct condition that persons booked through to places on other
railways will, in the event of the train being behind the advertised
time of arrival, have to wait for the next ordinary train by
the railway on which their through tickets entitle them to
travel.

and count any change received before leaving the window, as
mistakes cannot afterwards be rectified. In order to prevent
inconvenience and delay, passengers are advised to provide them-

and stand, if not weighing more than 281bs. in all,
free when travelling by rail. Artisans’ and mechanics’
tools, and riding saddle of a drover may be carried
free, provided they accompany passengers and do
not exceed the weight allowed.
Passengers are allowed, at their own risk, free of charge,
as passengers’ luggage, any goods they may pur-
chase bond fide for their own domestic use (other
than furniture, musical instruments, or articles
which the Station-master may consider objection-
able) up to the usual weight allowed free, according
to the class they travel. Any excess above these
weights to be charged at parcel rates. The allow-
ance to passengers travelling by Cheap Excursion
trains will be, first class, 561b5.; second class, 421bs.
To have Luggage Legibly Addressed. —Passengers
must have their names and the station to which they
are proceeding distinctly marked on the luggage,
and must see also that it is properly labelled by a
servant of the Commissioner. If left behind and
forwarded by a subsequent train through neglect of
these precautions, ordinary parcel rates will be
charged. To prevent mistakes all old labels must
be removed.
The Commissioner shall not be liable in respect of the
luggage of any passenger alleged to have been lost,
unless it is shown that it was fully addressed, and
that he delivered the same to an officer of the
Commissioner, and attended at the end of the
journey at the Guard’s Yan to claim it.


Passengers with luggage breaking their journey will do
so at their own risk, as to any delay in delivery
thereof, unless they have directed the luggage to be
labelled accordingly, as Guards can only be guided
by the labels as to the arrangement of luggage
in the van. If a passenger from Perth to Coolgardie,
for example, has his luggage labelled thereto, and
breaks his journey at Northam, no responsibility
will be entertained as regards putting out the
luggage there. Passengers who intend to break
their journey should have their luggage addressed
and labelled accordingly before starting.
No officer of the Commissioner has authority to undertake
any charge or responsibility in respect of luggage
left temporarily at a station, unless the same has
been booked at left luggage office; or to place
luggage in the brake van of any train at the risk
of the Commissioner, or to take any responsibility in
respect of the same, unless the foregoing regulations
have been strictly adhered to.
These regulations do not apply to articles taken by
passengers with them in the carriages at their own
risk; but no article will be allowed in the carriage
unless of such a size that it can be placed under
the seat or in the rack without inconvenience to
other passengers. Heavy articles must not be
placed in the rack.
When passengers’ luggage is conveyed with horses in
horse boxes, any excess of the weight allowed for
holders of second class tickets will be charged at the
ordinary Parcels rates.
“Passengers are hereby warned that any person transferring
rny duty-paid merchandise (not being luggage) from one State to
mother, without the production of Interstate Certificates or
lotification to a Customs officer at the place of arrival, is liable
:o be prosecuted, and the goods so transferred are liable to
’orfeiture.” (Sections 229 [7i], 262 and 273 of “ The Customs Act,
L 901.”)
Lost Luggage.— Luggage found on the railway lines or
premises will be forwarded to station nearest the address (if any)
narked thereon; but if not addressed or labelled will be kept on
rand at the station for three days, and then forwarded to the
ost property office at Perth, and the ordinary cloak room rates


will be charged. Umbrellas, sticks, muffs, woollen, and small
articles, which deteriorate by keeping, will be sold after one

other property not claimed within three months will be sold by

sengers are travelling from such station, or the previous day, if
the compartment is required from an intermediate station.
Compartments cannot, however, be reserved on Public Holi-
days, or when trains are heavily taxed.
Carriages on Goods Trains.
In special cases, when convenient to the Department, one
coach for the accommodation of passengers will be attached to
goods trains, on payment of not less than 20 fares, for the full
distance the carriage is required to run to perform the service.

Cloak Room and Left Luggage Charges.
Left Luggage. —Parcels and Luggage may, for convenience,
be deposited in the cloak room at all stations; but the Com-
missioner shall not be liable in respect of the loss of any paircel
or luggage in excess of the sum of £5, notwithstanding tfchat
the actual value of the parcel or luggage lost may exceed tthat
amount.
Scale of Eates. —The following charges shall be paytable
for parcels and luggage deposited in the cloak rooms
A charge of 2d. is made upon each article deposited! in
one of the Eailway Department’s cloak rooms.

Cloak room and left luggage charges must be paid to
the officer in charge of the cloak room, from whom
persons, on depositing parcels, will obtain a ticket
which must indicate the number of parcels deposited,
the name of depositor, and the amount paid. These
tickets are printed in triplicate, bound up in book
form, and numbered consecutively. In computing
the charges Sunday and Christmas Day or Good
Friday are not considered days, unless they are the
days on which the articles are deposited or taken out,
in which case they must be reckoned the same as any
other day.
Highly perishable articles, will not be accepted as left
luggage, nor will packages of merchandise or other
articles not allowed to be carried as personal luggage.
Articles deposited in the Eailway Department’s cloak rooms
will not be delivered up to the deposit™ for any purpose what-
ever, unless the ticket be first returned to the Department.
When passengers who have deposited their luggage in cloak
rooms require to remove one or more of the articles so left
(leaving the remainder until a future day) the cloak room ticket


held by the passenger must be handed in, and storage charges
up to date collected thereon, and articles remaining should be
re-deposited.
When a cloak room ticket is lost, the claimant is required
to give a detailed statement of the contents, and sign a
declaration indemnifying the Department against loss, etc., in
the event of ticket being found and presented; such declaration
to be made in the usual manner before a Resident Magistrate or
Justice of the Peace.

affixed to the parcel, the duplicate handed to the
owner for presentation at the cloak room when de-
manding his parcel, and the triplicate portion sent
with the parcel to the cloak room to be there signed
by the officer in charge as evidence of the parcel
having been deposited. Articles deposited under
this arrangement will, after three days, be subject to
the usual cloak room storage charges and conditions.
The delivery of a parcel on presentation of the duplicate
ticket, issued to the owner, shall release the Com-
missioner of all liability in connection therewith,
and the possession of the duplicate ticket by the
officer in charge of the cloak room shall be primd
facie evidence that the parcel or parcels mentioned
therein have been correctly delivered.
