THE FIRST TEMPTATION.
Near the dark waters of the dismal sea,
Where nought that tells of any life is found,
Where desolation holds the mastery,
And crusted stones lie thick upon the ground.
A solitary Figure, wan and worn,
Sits with bowed head upon a mossless rock,
He?d bear each ill that e?er by man is borne,
Of all man?s conflicts He would feel the shock.
For forty days He?s been alone with God,
Supported by the strength of ecstasy,
Where human foot has scarce, if ever, trod,
Far from all human aid or sympathy.
And now as man re-action He must bear,
And all the pangs of direst hunger feel.
He came to earth our human wants to share.
And by His own the Father?s love reveal.
It is the tempter?s fitting place and hour,
Man through his weakness ever he?d assail.
Full well he knows the gnawing famine?s power
When did he ever find its ceaseless pleadings fail
The sea grows purple black, a leaden cloud
Of storm-rack, blending with the lashing hail,
The enemy of mankind seems to shroud,
Draping his form like a dusky veil.


His brow is furrowed with undying hate,
His lips down-curl with a ceaseless scorn ;
In all the power of age-long triumphs great,
Who may resist him that?s of woman born ?
? Shall God?s own Son thus famine-stricken be??
The tempter to the famished Sufferer said.
? Put forth the might of Thy Divinity,
Andnow command these stones that they bebread.
The Saviour never raised His patient eyes,
But kept them gazing still upon the ground;
Man?s life, his true life, that which never dies,
Is in obeying God?s commandments found.
It was the Holy Spirit led Him there,
And now He would His Father?s time await ;
That Father knew how much He ought to bear.
Nor would His succour ever come too late.
And He who sorely tempted thus has been,
Is He who taught all mankind how to pray,
Showing us, each one, what that prayer may mean
? Father, give us our bread from day to day.?
HEALING THE LEPER.
The sun is rising o?er the sea
That flows by crested Galilee,
A hundred voices greet the morn
And hail another day new born.
Aloft the lark?s blithe song is heard,
Though scarce is seen the rising bird,
Who?s voice o?er all the chorus high
Rings like a joy-bell from the sky.


Then rises one who truly said,
He had no place to lay His head.
In all that world He made so fair,
He owned no dwelling anywhere.
His bed has been the gathered flag,
His roof has been the beetling crag.
Now in the fresh unsullied air,
The Son, the Father meets in prayer.
And ne?er to man was knowledge sent
Of all to Him such meeting meant.
He chooses a late-trodden path,
Which for its goal a rock-pool hath.
And there beneath a flowering tree,
He finds man?s sorest misery.
For, as his nearing figure?s seen,
A leper shrieks, ? Unclean, unclean.?
He?s stooping by the dark pool?s brink,
Lowering his calabash to drink,
And shudders his own face to see,
Corroded all with leprosy.
And then remembering what he?d been,
Once more he shrieks, ? Unclean, unclean.?
\ et still the Stranger shows no fear,
His sandalled foot-falls sound more near.
It must the mighty Healer be,
Of Nazareth in Galilee,
And He has cured the blind, the lame,
Nor slighted one who to Him came.
The leper vents his heart in prayer,
Which echoes through the morning air
Strong faith wells up within his soul?
Lord, will , and Ihou canst make me whole.?
He feels the prophet o?er him lean,
He hears Him say, ?I will; be clean.?
He feels His touch upon his hand,
He feels the force of His command.


The torpid blood speeds through his veins,
He child-like purity regains.
And He who healed in Galilee
Is changeless through eternity.
He came to earth to save from sin,
That moral leprosy within,
The higher nature still debasing,
The Maker?s image still defacing.
Alas, then, for the inly blind,
Who in themselves no blemish find,
Who never see as they are seen,
So deem themselves all pure and clean.
Feeling they are the rest above,
They seek not a Redeemer?s love.
Wrapt in self-confidence they stand,
To find their place on His left hand.
Sinners and sufferers they despise,
Amongst His brethren yet shall rise.
When each who feels, I holy am,
Shall see the terrors of the Lamb,
And wish the rending hills concealed
That self, for the first time revealed.
Yes, could the sinner himself see,
In all his true deformity,
See, as he by his God is seen,
We each would cry, ? Unclean, unclean,?
And with our whole hearts seek His aid,
To whom none e?er unheeded pray?d.


THE SYRO-PHCENICIAN WOMAN?S
APPEAL.
The Syrian sun is sinking low,
The great sea gleams with evening glow,
And its departing splendour falls,
On ancient Tyre?s marts and walls,
Which in the distance darkly rise,
Purpled against the golden skies.
At first no sound the ear may meet,
Save the slight sound of sandalled feet,
As journey north a little band,
Strangers to the Phoenician land,
With bowed down head and weary feet,
Their Leader seeks a safe retreat,
When on the stillness, long and high,
Rings out a woman?s pleading cry.
Yet He seems not to heed or hear,
Though the suppliant hastens near.
Never before His followers there,
Had known Him slight an earnest prayer.
But she, as by her speech they tell,
Belongs not unto Israel,
At length His troubled followers say,
? Master, this Gentile send away.?
But now He paused and turned around,
She sank down kneeling on the ground,
Her veil with tight clasp?d hands she rais?d,
And in his face imploring gaz?d.
? Help, Lord, Oh, help me? is her cry,
With all a mother agony.
? It is not meet,? He only said,
? That dogs should take the children?s bread. ?


But ?twas a loving mother prayM ;
She made his taunt a plea for aid.
? Yet, Lord, dogs take unchecked by all,
The crumbs that from the table fall.?
The gold gleams brighter from the fire ;
The mother gains her heart?s desire.
She hastens back with eaget feet,
Her rescued little one to greet ;
Sees by her looks so pure and mild,
Another spirit?s in her child.
He who the lost would seek and save,
The mother?s love then gladness gave ;
He still to earth His blessings sends,
He still to men His spirit lends,
Still gives that gift all gifts above,
A m other?s boundless quenchless love,
His teachings for all time are true,
? They who persist shall triumph too.?
THE RAISING OF LAZARUS.
?Tis ended now ?the struggle?s done?
The last long stillness has begun,
Those limbs, that lately writh?d with pain,
Shall never move nor feel again.
Is it destruction or release,
Is it blank nothingness, or peace,
That awaits the cherished one ?
For well we know our loved has gone.
That awful calm is all too deep
For even the profoundest sleep ;


The outward light the mourner tells
1 he soul within no longer dwells,
Yet shone a moment as it fled
Upon that home it tenanted,
For, though that form be still so fair,
The loved and loving is not there.
And ends all thus, man?s hopes and fears,
His smiles and laughter, sighs and tears,
The sounds that sooth, the sights that jar,
1 he good with evil?s ceaseless war ?
Are faith and love of no avail ?
Is human life an idiot?s tale ?
Philosophy?s a broken reed
That snaps and wounds you in your need.
? This life?s man?s all,? one sect declares,
Another neither knows nor cares.
So, when our best loved die, we see
Its comfort sound like irony.
Hut one voice thrills when mortal doubts are
rife,
? I am the Resurrection and the Life.?
And who is He who dares assert
That He alone of human birth
Can to His fellow mortals give
Assurance that their dead shall live ?
Weary and travel?d, stain?d He seems,
And yet His eye with power beams,
His dress no mark of rank reveals,
Yet at His feet a woman kneels,
? Had?st Thou been here, 0 Lord,? she cried,
?I know my brother had not died.?
Is He deceiving, or deceived ?
That woman in His power believed.
Would sickness fly at His command ?
Lies life and death within His hand ?
The test is near?His answer?s plain,
? Thy brother now shall rise again.?


All time can trust Him without fear.
If e?en the dead His voice can hear,
And man?s great problem solved shall be
Beside that tomb at Bethany.
? Lazarus, now come forth,? He cried;
The grave no more its prey may hide.
Wrapped in the swathings of the dead,
The face-cloth tied beneath his head,
With fetter?d feet and helpless hands
The risen one before them stands.
The awe-struck mourners lend no aid,
Till He, whom even death obey?d,
Who all death signified could know,
Said, ? Loose him now and let him go.?
Then to his side the sisters speed,
Martha his face at once has freed,
While Mary, kneeling on the ground,
The bands that bind his limbs unwound,
As with adoring awe she gazed
On Him whose word the dead had rais?d,
And Lazarus, with bewildered eyes,
Sees all the scene before him rise.
The hue of health has tinged his cheeks,
Although, as yet, no word he speaks,
Nor may we know what he then knew
Till we have passed death?s portals too.
There, close without the village walls,
Upon a cross the sunlight falls,
And, where its long drawn shadow lies,
The Saviour turned His prescient eyes,
For He, His own loved to the end,
And laid His life down for His friend,
Since well He knew should Lazarus rise,
That He, the wonder worker, dies.
Now He, whose power and smypathy
Was shown that day at Bethany,


He to whom time and space are nought,
Who feels each want and sees each thought,
Is still as near, and still as strong to save.
Nor ends His comfort with the closing grave ;
His words still cheer when mortal grief is rife,
? I am the Resurrection and the Life."
GETHSEMANE.
The Pascal moon has veiled her light,
Shadow lies on Gethsemane ;
Yet still the Temple?s walls gleam white,
And still its uphill road we see.
Now down that road come many men,
Their torches gleaming in the air,
We see that they are armed when
?I heir sword-points catch the flambeaux glare.
They come, by the arch-traitor led,
To murder in the name of law,
One, of whom e?en His woes have said
The world His equal never saw.
Well may the moon be clouded o?er,
Well may the heavens seem to frown ;
Never since nature?s dawn before
Had they on such a sight looked down.
He who had said, ? Let there be light,?
And light into creation sprang,
Lies^ prostrate ?neath the darkened night,
While through all space His dread words rang,
Words that express an agony,
Words that with awe the angels thrill,
? Father, let this cup pass from Me,?
Each note of praise in heaven is still.


One moment and it almost seem?d
That Satan had the victory won.
Man must remain thus unredeemed,
Or else the Father slights the Son,
Throughout the whole eternity
That moment stands without a peer.
Would the Son from the battle flee ?
Or would the Father fail to hear ?
A shaft of light shoots from on high,
An angel form comes hovering down,
? Not Mine, but Thy will,? is His cry,
The angel bears a victor?s crown.
And ?twas for us He thus endured,
His vict?ry was for all mankind,
So by His agony assured,
Each penitent may welcome find.
The dark cloud and the straight broad ray
Which now the cross?s form take
But symbolise the open way
That He from earth to heaven would make.
Still by that path come angels down,
By it we each to heaven may rise,
Still at its summit gleams the crown,
The victor?s wreath which Christ supplies.
