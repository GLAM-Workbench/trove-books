IN tliis little work I reprint several articles contributed by me
to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, and other journals, on the sub-
ject of ? South Sea Massacres,? with considerable additions and
revisions. The proceedings in the Parliament of New South Wales
and at the Intercolonial Conference are detailed and criticised. 1
have endeavoured to put the whole question before the public in a
manner easily to be understood by all, that they may see what
has been done, and what left undone.
I write con amove. During my recent visit to Fiji I had
evidence of the decadence of the white race in the Western
Pacific, caused through the harsh and one-sided administration of
Imperial laws in this ? Crown Colony of a severe type ? by Sir
Arthur Gordon and Judge Gorrie. With any other but the most
law abiding citizens open rebellion would have taken place. The
white inhabitants of Fiji have been long suffering to a fault.
They were ruled with a rod of iron, and British Government, from
which they fondly hoped so much, has, as yet, proved anything
but a blessing to them.
I trust that this brochure may have the effect of drawing
public attention to the misrule which has existed in Fiji, as
well as to the urgent necessity of an immediate change in the
administration of justice between the white and native races in the
South Seas. I appeal to every statesman and legislator in the
colonies to aid in putting an end to the present scandalous state of
things in the Western Pacific.
This is a ? white man?s ? question; the blood of many of our
murdered countrymen cries to us for justice?the testimony of
Captains Ferguson and M?lntosh comes from the grave giving
-evidence of the accursed ? policy ? to which they owe their deaths.
No words of mine can add weight to that appeal. For the sake of
-the living and the dead, of the honour of the British fiag, let it not
>he made in vain !

SOUTH SEA MASSACRES.
THE RULERS OF THE PACIFIC.
-� ?
The first Ruler is Sir Arthur Gordon, K.C.M.G., High Com-
missioner of the Western Pacific. He has been Governor of
Fiji for nearly six years, but has just been removed from that
sphere of his mismanagement to New Zealand. He is very
aristocratic, being the son of an earl, and afterwards a Court page,
whom the Queen delighted to honour. He has had several nice
sinecures in Colonial Governorships. These have always been
in Crown Colonies, where he has ruled autocratically. In
appearance, however, he does not show many signs of his noble
blood: middle size, thin, lantern jaws, sardonic expression,
beard, eye-glass, and shirt sleeves, that is the outside of Sir
Arthur Gordon. Although from others he exacts the strict
etiquette usually given to Royalty, he sets a free and easy
fashion in his own person. It is not usual to see Her Majesty's
representative in shirt sleeves received on board a man-of-war
with a guard of honour presenting arms : yet such things have
been in Fiji ! Sir Arthur is all powerful in the Pacific; being
afflicted with the colour blindness of Exeter Hall, he believes, or
pretends to believe, that all white men in the South Seas are
murderers and rogues, and that every native is an innocent,
peaceful child of nature, whom it is his business to ? protect "
and pamper. Sir Arthur is never even decently civil nor
courteous to the European residents of Fiji. ? This is not a
white man's country," he said recently, addressing the citizens
of Levuka, and he has tried his best to make it unbearable for
them.
Ruler Number Two is John Gorrie, Chief Justice of Fiji.
He was office boy to a lawyer in Scotland, and by following the
tactics of Sirs Joseph Porter and Pertinax Macsycophant, and
? creepin' and crawlin'," and ? booin' and booin'," he became at
last a limb of the law himself. He was ever of the unco' guid,
and joined himself to Exeter Hall and the Aborigines' Pro-


tection Society. He was specially admitted to the Bar before
going out to Jamaica to persecute Governor Eyre. After that
piece of work, he obtained a judgeship in the Mauritius,and
followed his patron, Gordon, to Fiji, where he is the only judge,
and trial by jury being denied there, he has the power of life and
death over all. He is a fine-looking man, with short whiskers
and moustache. He wears a scarlet gown in Court and insists on
being called ?My Lord.? His delight is to work himself into
an apparent fury of virtuous indignation anent ? the inhuman
manner in which the poor natives are treated.? He gets these
absurdities printed in the Fiji papers, and sends copies home to
his friends of the Aborigines' Protection Society. Then Exeter
Hall cries, ? Oh, what a good man is Gorrie.? He is the biggest
bubble in the Pacific, and the most dangerous, as he invariably
takes the part of the natives against the white settlers. Yet he
hears the truth sometimes, I recently gave lectures in Levuka
and said, ? Never, since the days of Jefferys, had such infamous
decisions been given from an English bench as those of Judge
Gorrie,? I was loudly cheered for this utterance. An inspector
and sergeant of police were taking notes of what I said, but
I should have claimed the privilege of my American citizenship
had any attempt been made to ? deport ? me, as was threatened.
For it is not safe to open one's mouth to criticise the Imperial
authorities in the South Seas. Sir Arthur Gordon was appointed
High Commissioner and Consul-General of the Western Pacific
by an order in Council dated August, 1877. Under this he and
the Judicial Commissioner, Judge Gorrie, possess absolute power
over the liberties of British subjects in the South Seas, who may
be ? deported ? at pleasure and against this there is no appeal.
The power of deportation has been recently used in a case of
which more will yet be heard. Mr. W. J. Hunt, a gentleman
well-known in the Pacific, was Chief Secretary and Prime
Minister of the late King Maleatoa of Samoa. He became
obnoxious to Sir Arthur Gordon, who served him with an order
to leave Samoa within ten days, otherwise he would be conveyed
away in a man-of-war, taken to Levuka and criminally tried.
Mr. Hunt accordingly left, went to Fiji and issued a writ against
the High Commissioner for �2OOO damages for the enforced loss
of the lucrative salary attached to his post. The case was tried
before Judge Gorrie, and, of course, dismissed. Mr. Hunt then
proceeded to New Zealand, but has recently returned to the
Islands, He cannot, however escape Sir Arthur Gordon's atten-
tions. Anent this the Fiji Times of January 19th has the
following :?? The ex-Premier of his defunct Samoan Majesty is
fast becoming a man of mark. On Sunday last, H.M.S.
? Cormorant? unexpectedly appeared in port and general curiosity


was aroused to know the nature of her errand. During the next
day it transpired that when his Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon,,
High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, became aware that
Mr. W. J. Hunt had left Auckland in the s.s. ? Clyde ? with the
avowed intention of proceeding to Samoa, in defiance of his order
of prohibition, he telegraphed to the Commodore on the
Australian Station requesting him to despatch a vessel for the
purpose of removing him thence and deporting him to Sydney.
This the Commodore declined to do, and the High Commissioner
then telegraphed to the Home authorities with the result that the
?Cormorant 11 was directed to proceed upon the important and
hazardous service. Upon arrival in Levuka, it was found that
Mr. Hunt was resident in this town and her Majesty?s cruiser
started on her return voyage from her wild goose chase yesterday
morning. This is truly a dignified record for all parties con-
cerned. While the active interposition of English men-of-war is
required for the protection of British lives in the Western
Pacific, their anchors remain down in Sydney harbour; but when
a British subject presumes even to threaten to disregard the
injunction of the High Commissioner, relative to his residence in
one island or another, all the springs of High Commission and
Admiralty machinery are at once in motion. Sir Arthur Gordon
is certainly to be congratulated upon the dignified position in
which he has placed himself. He has hurled a thunderbolt and
has not even crushed a butterfly, and by his injudicious action
he has made himself and Captain Bruce the laughing stock of the
southern hemisphere.? This trip' would cost the English
Government at least �IOOO. Mr, Hunt has since proceeded to
Samoa.
Sir Arthur Gordon thus possesses and wields powers superior
to those held by the Crown. The people of Fiji have been his
bond slaves. He has been a very Pharoah, the more they have
appealed to him the more he has hardened his heart against
them, A most iniquitous piece of business has just come to
light. It was proposed some years ago to remove the site of the
capital from Levuka to Suva. The former place is central,
healthy, and in every way suited for its purpose; the latter, as I
saw, is but a mangrove swamp. The people who had struggled
for years against hardships innumerable, and had built up the
trade of Levuka, investing all their savings in land and houses
there, would have been ruined by this; so in 1876 they sent a
petition to Her Majesty setting forth their grievances. They
received no answer, and the next year forwarded a similar
petition. Again no answer. Then they contented themselves
with the idea that their prayers were receiving favourable
consideration, until in the middle of last year it was announced


that some of the Government departments would be at once
removed to Suva. They then prepared another petition, but
since the departure of Sir Arthur Gordon, find that the replies to
their former ones had been suppressed. On this the Fiji Times
says : ?? When in 1876 the project of the removal of the capital,
which in the outset was regarded as almost chimerical, first
began to assume form and consistency, a petition was forwarded
to her Majesty, through his Excellency the Governor, respectfully
but firmly opposing the proposition. No answer having been
received to this remonstrance, a second petition of a similar
character was prepared and forwarded in like manner in the
following year, and for more than three years the reply of Her
Majesty has been anxiously but vainly expected. It was of
course generally concluded that the Imperial decision would be
communicated as soon as it had been definitely arrived at, and
the very fact that no answer was received to either memorial,
justified Her Majesty?s petitioners'in assuming that the matter
was still under consideration, and that no irrevocable step would
be taken pending the announcement of the decision. Matters
were therefore allowed to rest in abeyance, until the proposition
to remove the Immigration Department to Suva appeared to
indicate the vigorous prosecution of the scheme, when, in July
last, the final memorial to the Queen was prepared and forwarded
through his Excellency. This was accompanied by one to
himself, drawing special attention to the fact that two former
petitions on the subject remained unanswered, and praying that
his Excellency would stay all further expenditure until such
reply had been received. Sir Arthur?s cavalier reply to the
prayer of his petitioners will be remembered, I cannot permit
you for one moment to suppose that I shall suspend operations,?
&c., &c. Neither will it be forgotten how, while pushing
forward these preparations with the most indecent haste, in
defiance of the general wish of the colonists, the memorial to her
Majesty was detained at Nasova until the following October.
When in the course of their late interview with Mr. Des Yoeux,
the members of the deputation recently appointed again referred
to the unanswered petitions, his Excellency expressed surprise
and almost incredulity, until he was repeatedly assured that no
answer had been received. It appeared to him so utterly
improbable that the respectful remonstrance of her Majesty?s
subjects could have been so contemptuously ignored, that he
afterwards instituted enquiry. It was then discovered that to
Sir Arthur Gordon the colonists were indebted for the indignity
and contumely, the onus of which he had so adroitly contrived
?to throw upon the Imperial Government. That Her Majesty?s
reply was communicated within three months of the date of the


second petition, and that for three years of waiting, in which
vigorous and energetic agitation might have availed to change
the course of events, but during which the colonists of Fiji
had apparently slept upon their rights, it lay pigeon-holed
at Nasova, while the oracle commissioned to deliver it had
remained contumaciously and perversely silent. Now, for
the first time, it is communicated to the public.?
Denizens of a Crown Colony, the people of Fiji had apparently
no claim to be heard in defence of their just rights. Sir Arthur
Gordon?s regime has brought ruin to many of them. In the
settlement of the Lands Question, the greatest unfairness has in
many cases been shown; properties originally purchased from
the natives, and on which for years capital and labour have been
expended, have been taken from their rightful owners, not to be
returned to the natives but to be absorbed by the Crown. But
if the white race has been oppressed, the native chiefs have been
pampered. It was Sir Arthur Gordon?s policy always to
conciliate these, and care nothing about the common people, tha
Kai Sis. In every case the native race was elevated above the
white. The practice of employing native policemen, allowed to
exercise powers over Europeans, is most obnoxious. I have my-
self seen respectable white citizens arrested and locked up by
these savages oh the most frivolous and false charges. A
Tongan or Fijian policeman, who dare not lay his hands upon a
chief, can, and will ? run in ? you or I if the fit seizes him.
What wonder then that the whole white race is falling into
contempt with the natives.
As an instance of the insolence of the natives, I give
the following which I wrote some two months back from
the accounts furnished me by the gentlemen concerned on
their return to Sydney: ?? By the f Wentworth ? I receive
tidings of a glaring case of attempted extortion by a native
magistrate on the Rewa. It will be remembered that a number
of gentlemen, many of them English visitors at the Melbourne
Exhibition, went down in this steamer to make a round tour of
the Islands. Four of them?Messrs. Cartland (of Birmingham),
Howard (of Bedford), Ward (of Sheffield), and Lee Walker (of
Sydney)?left the vessel at Suva. They took a small sailing
boat from thence to the Rewa river, intending to have some
sport duck-shooting. Two natives were engaged to navigate the
boat and act as guides. At night they slept at Smith?s Hotel
on the river. Close to this is the village of Rewa, the largest
native settlement in Fiji. The chief of this is Dreketi, who is a
drunken scoundrel, but was appointed f Roko Tui,? or native
magistrate, by Sir Arthur Gordon. According to a circular,
addressed to Government servants, issued by the Colonial


Secretary, (Mi. Thurston), the native officials have superior
powers to those possessed by white Stipendiary Magistrates.
This document says, ? It should be constantly borne in mind that
they (the Rokos) are the direct representatives of the Governor.
European officers will therefore refrain from interfering with
them. This is to be strictly adhered to without reference to
personal feeling or individual provocation. The consideration
thus shown may very probably not be reciprocated. But each
officer must be prepared to accept disappointment of this kind as
an incident of his office, and should remember that upon the
manner in which he bears it may depend the peace of the
province.? European gentlemen, magistrates and others in Fiji
<ll e, according to this, expected to put up with any amount of
insolence from the native chiefs ; but travellers in a country over
which the British flag floats can scarcely be expected to under-
stand such a state of things. The gentlemen we have named, in
the evening paid a short visit to the native village, and took with
them, on the advice of the hotelkeeeper, a bottle of rum for Tui
Dreketi. On leaving the hotel in the morning this chief, who
doubtless found out that they were new chums, and imagined
that they were open to imposition, presented himself and
demanded more rum??plenty rum.? On this being refused he
ordered the natives out of the boat, and intimated that they
should not leave until his request was complied with. Without
these men our travellers could not move, as it would have been
impossible to steer safely through the coral patches and reefs to
Suva. But they would not submit to imposition. The York-
shire man wanted to give the chief a ? hammering ?; but some
white men there said their lives would be sacrificed in vengeance
by the natives. After a five hours' delay, Tui Dreketi seeing he
could not obtain his black mail, allowed the hired natives to return
to their duty. This is how a ?direct representative of the
Governor? treats travellers in Fiji. Not belonging to his tribe
Tui Dreketi had no authority over the men in question, except
that derived from the Government as Roko. His village is
some few miles from the scene of the outrage and robbery at the
house of Mrs. Williams, which took place some two months
back. These proceedings are a practical illustration of the
pernicious working of Sir Arthur Gordon's policy, and the
judgments of Chief Justice Gorrie, of the teachings "of Exeter
Hall, and the Aborigines Protection Society.?
The Exeter Hall bias of the Chief Justice and the occasions
he has taken of exercising it render him a terror to the planters
as fine a set of gentlemen as any in the world. Should one of
their labourers die, they know not but that they may be accused
of murder. Such things have been ! Mr. W. Fillingham Parr


a pronounced antagonist of the Governor?s policy, although
residing in Levuka, was actually charged with murder because a
native labourer died on one of his plantations sixty miles away.
He had to journey thither and stand in the dock to be tried for
an alleged neglect on the part of his overseer. Of course he
was acquitted, as it was proved his labourers were treated most
kindly. In May last. Lieutenant Chippendall, late of the R.N.,
a gentleman loved and respected by every man in the group, was
tried for manslaughter because he gave one of his labourers a
push, the man dying of a pulmonary disease sometime afterwards.
There was direct medical evidence of the attending surgeon as
to the cause of the man?s death. There was not a shadow of
evidence that he had been illused or suffered from illusage, yet
this English officer and gentleman had to stand his trial, and
bring a learned barrister, at a great expense, from Sydney to
defend him. The belief amongst the planters as to the animus
of Judge Gorrie is so great that there was a fear even then that
the case might go against Lieutenant Chippendall. There
would be no appeal, the passing whim of one man has power
over life and liberty. So the accused hid a revolver in his coat
pocket before he went into Court. ?If I am convicted, I will
shoot myself sooner than endure the ignominy of being under
the orders of the brutal native officials at the gaol,? said he.
The case of Lieutenant Chippendall, and Sir Arthur Gordon?s
action therein, is the subject of an enquiry in the English
Parliament. These are the acts of the rulers of Fiji and the
Pacific!


THE EFFECTS OF MISRULE.
In December last I wrote the following:?" Is the Caucasian
played out in the South Seas ? As far as British subjects are
concerned it would seem so. During the last few months
outrage upon outrage, massacre upon massacre have been com-
mitted by the natives. Englishmen have died slow and lingering
deaths; English vessels have been captured and pillaged. The
savages of the Solomon Islands have been enjoying a saturnalia
of bloodshed and robbery. With impunity they have followed
up their misdeeds. Sir Arthur Gordon, High Commissioner of
Polynesia, at Levuka, has prated about the u colour blindness ?
of the white race. Judge Gorrie, Judicial Commissioner, has
from the bench enunciated most startling theories as to the
inhumanity displayed towards the ?poor natives.? Both these
officials have for years been playing to the gallery of Exeter
Hall, and no doubt have acquired in Great Britain a great
reputation for philanthropy?earned, as results show, at the cost
of the blood of their countrymen. Now, the savages have
culminated their outrages by the murder of a naval officer and
four seamen. Vengeance is loudly called for, and no doubt the
call will be answered j but the public mind is largely exercised
as to the reason of these continued massacres. Various theories
have been started. One that they are in retaliation for ? atroci-
ties generally committed by white men; another that they are
acts of revenge for the kidnapping which takes place in the
labour trade ; a third, with more reason, because British men-of-
war have not meted out retribution for past offences. In this
last argument, however, an injustice, as I shall show, is
done to the naval commanders on this station.
In giving my contribution to this discussion, I speak as one
having some slight authority. I know many of the Pacific
Islands; I have seen the working of the ? labour trade ?in
Queensland, New Caledonia, and Eiji. During a late three
months sojourn in the latter Colony I saw the survivors of
many of the massacres of which we have lately heard. I
acquired extensive information on this subject, and had evidence
of the administration of justice in the High Commissioners


Court. We must discuss this subject on present issues. It is
needless to go to the records of the past when white men were
guilty of rapine and bloodshed in the South Seas. Little
use to rake up the records of the ? Carl ? affair, nor even Bishop
Patterson?s opinions on the labour traffic. Kidnapping, no
doubt, there was in the old days; deeds perchance done which,
to think of, makes our blood boil with indignation. What we want
to know is the reason of these things now, when missionary
influence has spread; when trade and commerce have penetrated
to every island in the Pacific; when the natives are protected
by a High Commissioner, and many deputy Commissioners,
costing Great Britain some �20,000 annually. To put it down
to the labour traffic is absurd. Both Fijian and Queensland
? recruiting ? vessels carry responsible Government agents,
whose presence is sufficient now to prevent any of the abuses
which have been alleged. There is no doubt that the chief of a
tribe may, on consideration of a present which he values, make
a number of his followers ? enlist,? but as far as the Colonial
officers are concerned, these come away willingly. I have seen
in Queensland, Noumea, and Levuka many labour vessels arrive.
The ? recruits ? all seemed happy; there would be sure to be
one amongst them, who had been in the port before, who would
explain the many strange objects they saw, and at which they
would all be amazed and amused. During their term of labour
these islanders are well fed, supplied with tobacco and clothes ;
not too hardly worked, and, except in isolated cases, generally
well used. When their three years of service is over they invest
the money then paid to them in beads, hatchets, and firearms,
and return to their island homes rich as one who in the old days
had shaken the pagoda tree. The custom, I believe, is that there
is a free fight and scramble amongst the tribe for this plunder,
and that the returned emigrant is generally left with nothing but
the satisfaction that he has been a public benefactor. But many
of the island tribes live in communities, as in Australia. ? What?s
yours is mine ? is the doctrine, and if the result of the Kanaka?s
labour is not much to himself, at least he has done more good to
the world working on a plantation than idling away his time in a
state of semi-starvation on his native island. I defend the labour
trade, therefore. The French vessels are, I believe, a little less
particular in ? recruiting,? and their mode of apportioning
" hands ? to the highest bidder is more like slavery. But we
seldom hear of a Frenchman being killed. Why ? Because
France protects her citizens. If anything should happen to one
of them in the South Seas, a man-of-war will visit the spot, and
the chief of the offending tribe will be hung. How differently
has England?s representative in the Pacific acted ?


I charge Sir Arthur Gordon, Governor of New Zealand and
High Commissioner of the Pacific, and John Gorrie, Chief
Justice of Fiji, and Judicial Commissioner, with being morally
responsible for the bloodshed which has occurred during the last
twelve months. I will give facts to support this charge! It
must be remembered that Sir Arthur Gordon is the pet, not only
of the Court, but of that powerful party known in England as
? Exeter Hall/? Judge Gorrie is more, he is the protege of the
Aborigines? Protection Society. In all their public acts and
words they follow out the theory that the natives of the Pacific
are mild, innocent savages, and all white traders and sailors in
the seas murdering wretches. ?The poor natives must be pro-
tected.? By various Acts of Parliament and Orders in Council
Sir Arthur Gordon has absolute and arbitrary power in the
Western Pacific, his jurisdiction extending over the eastern half
of New Guinea. Any British subject can be ? deported ? from
one island to another; may, without any cause but the will of
the High Commissioner, be ordered to leave his business or
occupation in any native island ; if he refuses to comply may be
taken to Fiji and imprisoned for contempt. Any Colonial or
British vessel may be seized and taken to Fiji. Any British
subject, for any alleged offence against the natives, may be tried
before the Judicial Commissioner at Fiji?and tried, be it
remembered, without a jury. All the powers of the High
Commissioner have been exerted against the white and in favour
of the native race, and the men-of-war in this portion of the
Pacific being under his orders and instructions, the officers are
not to blame for the apathy shown with regard to the loss of
valuable lives.
Truly the natives have been protected well ! Rehearse the
events of the past two years. Early in 1879 the boat?s crew of
the Queensland recruiting vessel ? Mystery ? were murdered at
Aoba in the New Hebrides. Commodore Wilson, instructed by
Sir Arthur Gordon, went down to get satisfaction, and on the
24th May he levied a fine of pigs, yams, and taro, with which he
fed his ship?s company. I wonder if any of the gallant tars felt
any repugnance at feasting on the price of blood ! Some few
months after this the same natives murdered an American named
Johnston, and they sent word that they had got the pigs ready as
soon as the man-of-war wanted them. It is for this murder that
we learnby cablegram the United States are determined to have
satisfaction. On the next voyage of the " Mystery ?on April 21,
1879, Captain Kilgour recovered his boat, which was stolen by
the natives when they murdered the crew. The natives endea-
voured to retain it, and shots were fired, and for this Captain
Kilgour was tried at Levuka and fined �IOO ! For recovering


his own property ! On the 13th July, 1879, the mate of the
? Agnes McDonald ? was murdered at Pentecost, New Hebrides,
but the murderer was not punished. In April, 1879, Charley
Halget was murdered in the Solomon Islands, also one Robert
Provost. The ? Danag ? burnt villages in revenge. This year
the mate and Government agent of the ? Dauntless ? were
murdered in the New Hebrides. The ? Wolverene ? burnt some
grass huts in exchange. Then followed the massacre of Captain
Ferguson and the crew of the ?Ripple,? of Captain MHntosh
and the crew of the ?Esperanza,? and the capture of the
?Borealis.? Later on the masters and crews of the ?Annie
Brooks ? and ? Loelia ? were murdered. Nothing has been done
to avenge these outrages. Sir Arthur Gordon had a man-of-war
to take him about the islands and convey him to Auckland, but
he would not send it to capture the murderers. And the Commo-
dore can take no steps in the Western Pacific without authority
from the High Commissioner. From the murder of Captain
Ferguson, of the ? Ripple,? to that of the boat?s crew of H.M.S.
? Sandfly,? every week has brought us intelligence of a fresh
outrage. And it is only now that the ? Emerald ?is ordered to
the scenes of all these massacres. Who can doubt that this long
list of victims is the result of Sir Arthur Gordon?s Exeter Hall
policy in ordering the lives of white men to be assessed in pork.
And not this only; but through Governor Gordon and Judge
Gorrie, the status of the Anglo-Saxon race in the Pacific has been
lowered. The former has publicly said that Fiji itself is ? not a
white man?s country,? and the latter tries to make it unbearable
for them. An Englishman scarcely dare to protect his life and
property in the Pacific. Besides the case of Captain Kilgour,
who, being a Queenslander, got off lightly, there is that of
Captain Waite, of the ? Marion Benny,? who, in the end of
1878, received nine months? imprisonment in Levuka for having-
fired over the heads of some presumed hostile natives. He was
convicted on native evidence only. In 1879, Captain Daly,
owner of the brig ? Heather Bell,? was sentenced to six months?
imprisonment and a fine of �l5O for detaining a native on board
without his consent, a judgment which every one says was most
arbitrary. On the other hand, when Commodore Wilson took a
prisoner named Aratuga, one of the murderers of the boat?s crew
of the ? Mystery,? to Fiji for trial, Judge Gorrie said he had no
jurisdiction?that the man was but acting as a soldier under the
co .? ma ?^ s chief. In his own words, as reported in the
Fiji Times of 14th April, 1880: ??I can, therefore, find no
grounds upon which to found jurisdiction against this man in his
individual capacity, or to hold him responsible for any offence
committed against British law.? So, according to this decision,


the murdering native commits no offence against British law, but
the merchant captain who endeavours to recover his lost property
must be fined �IOO.
In Fiji itself the white race is perpetually degraded. To
keep up a reputation at Exeter Hall, charges of cruelty, man-
slaughter, and murder are continually being brought against the
planters, whom it is the fiction of ? philanthropists ? to endow
with all the inhumanity before attributed by Mrs. Beecher
Stowe to Legree and Co. of the Southern States. Now, the
imported labourers, natives of a hundred different isles, know all
these things. They all learn Fijian, which is now the lingua
franca of the Western Pacific; They know that no retribution
has been exacted for outrages committed on whites. They know
that a native, if brought to Levuka on any charge, will be
acquitted. So when they return to their homes with the news
that the white man ? s power of hurting them is gone, all the
family or tribe take an early opportunity of having a little
safe sport. Thus suddenly from many different quarters in
the Pacific we hear news of massacres. I remember well
when in September last the ? Borealis? with her bloodstained
decks came into Levuka, how in half an hour there was a
knot of Solomon Islanders, New Hebrideans and others,
imported labourers, who were excitedly canvassing the affair
in the street. I thought then that the news that, unavenged,
six men had been massacred and the vessel looted, would
not increase their own feelings of respect for their masters.
The memory of a savage is short, justice must strike him quickly
and speedily, the lex talionis is the only law he knows. The
colonies should join together to protest that the property and
lives of their citizens shall no longer be at the mercy of the High
Commissioner or his judicial assistant. If they were abolished
altogether it would be a public benefit. Till this is done will not
one of our new and shining lights move in Parliament ?? That
an address be sent to Her Majesty praying that the powers of
the High Commissioner in the Pacific shall not extend over
Australian vessels nor citizens, but that the latter shall be tried
for alleged offences in the South Seas in the Colonial courts.
Also that the men-of-war on the Sydney station shall receive
instructions to obtain atonement for the murder of Australian
sailors other than by payment of pigs from the native chiefs or
the burning of a few huts.? It becomes now a necessity for the
colonies to make a firm stand if the supremacy of the white race
is to be sustained in the South Seas.?


proceedings in parliament.
?�???�
On the 17th December, Mr. Combes, C.M.G., gave notice
in the House of Assembly, that on the 11th of January, he
would ask ? if it was the intention of the Government to take any
measures that would lead to a better protection of the lives and
property of her Majesty?s Australian subjects in the South
Seas.? When the question was put. Sir Henry Parkes said ?it
was not easy to see what course the Government intended to
take for the better protection of the lives of her Majesty?s
subjects in the South Seas; but a representation would be made
to the Imperial Government urging that the utmost attention be
given to protective measures against outrages.? Whether any
such representation has been made, and what form it has taken, I
know not. On the 17 th January, I wrote as follows: ?? lam
sure that the Premier recognizes the gravity of the position, of
the fact that the properties and lives of Australian citizens have
been sacrificed during the last twelve months without redress or
compensation, and that a reign of terror for the white race exists
in the Pacific. All the Colonies are concerned in this, but
especially New South Wales. Here in Sydney now there are
widowed wives and fatherless children appealing to our sympathy
and our pockets. But however strong the representation from
our Government, would it have the same weight as a resolution of
the Intercolonial Conference now sitting ? And no resolution, no
representation respecting the need of increased protection to
Australian citizens in the South Seas, will have any effect,
unless it goes to the root of the matter, the powers delegated to
the High Commissioner and Judicial Commissioner of Polynesia.
If the Colonies could fully realise the extent to which these
control their commerce in the Pacific, the arbitrary style of the
judicial proceedings, and the hopelessness of redress, they would
make common cause for a modification or abolition of their
powers. It is greatly to be feared that at present any repre-
sentation from any single Colony would either be put into a
pigeon-hole, or sent to Sir Arthur Gordon to report upon. He,
no doubt, would consider any interference with, or criticism of,
his prerogative, a great impertinence, and in due course our
Colonial Secretary would receive a snubbing letter from Downing-


street, intimating that Sir Arthur Gordon was doing all in
his power to stop the outrages in question. We may look in
vain for any redress from the High Commissioner. He will
never depart from his theory that all the poor natives of the
Pacific are innocent and peaceful, and require protection from
the white planters and traders.
But a resolution of the Intercolonial Conference, I think,
would do good. The Imperial authorities could not disregard
the joint appeal of the Colonies. And it should be fully set forth
what glaring disadvantages before the law an English subject
suffers in Polynesia. He is liable to be ? deported ?at the will
of the High Commissioner, and he may have his property confis-
cated, and his life attempted by the natives. If he endeavours
to defend these he will very possibly be tried without a jury by
Judge Gorrie. If a native is charged with an offence against a
European, the Judge holds that he has no jurisdiction. These
things are on record, and if forcibly brought before the attention
of the Imperial authorities by action of the Conference must have
effect. It requires powerful action to counteract the evil results
of Sir Arthur Gordon?s rule in the Pacific. He possesses con-
siderable influence in England, and has sworn admirers, who
loudly assert that he is a wise and brilliant statesman. None but
those who have lived in Fiji, or have had evidence of Imperial
misrule there, as I have, would, until these recent massacres,
have believed that Sir Arthur Gordon was anything but a
Christian governor. His Christianity has all been displayed on
one side however. Even the missionaries have given him up..
The Eev. William Moore, an ex-Wesleyan missionary, in Fiji,
and a large landed proprietor there, writing in the Sydney
Morning Herald says, ? You will see that we have no confidence
in the office of f High Commissioner ? ever meeting this case.?*
The pampering of the natives has caused them everywhere to
assume a most insolent tone. Even within the last two months,
since I left Fiji, this has increased. There have been many cases
of assaults by natives on white men. The imported labourers care
so little for their masters or the laws that they are resorting to
their own customs and amusements. One of my correspondents
writes : ?The Santo and Solomon boys had a pitched battle two
Sundays since, at Yagadace, right by the judicial residence.
Judge Gorrie happened to be out however teaching a Sunday-
school class of coolies. There were several severely injured, and
* The Ecy. George Brown, the pioneer missionary in New Britain, writes:?
? To a very great extent I heartily sympathise with the traders in the anomalous,
and difficult position in which they are at present placed, and with their earnestly-
expressed desire that some change should be made which would ensure to British
subjects the same care and protection which is exercised over the natives.?


one man died a few days afterwards in tlie hospital. There is no
mistaking the marked change in the demeanour of the foreign
labourers and the insolent tone they are assuming.?
The Church and the London and the Wesleyan Missionary
Societies are planted in nearly every island in the Pacific.
Ordinary commerce and the ? labour trade ? have for some years
brought the majority of islanders within the influence of
civilization ?at least they have a knowledge of other countries,
and other conditions of life but their own. Is it that familiarity
has bred contempt, or that the knowledge that they can commit
outrages unscathed, which makes the islanders so insolent now ?
The massacres which have taken place during the last sis
months must be avenged, and the causes investigated. I, and
every white man who knows the Pacific, believe that the reason
is to be found in the action of professional philanthropists, who
have before now trailed the honour of England in the gutter.
Sir Arthur Gordon and Judge Gorrie represent these. A strong
resolution of the Intercolonial Conference, or a demand for a
Poyal Commission to inquire into the cause and circumstances of
these massacres, will alone meet the merits of the case."?


THE INTERCOLONIAL CONFERENCE.
On the 19th January, at the late Intercolonial Conference
held in Sydney, Mr. Palmer, Colonial Secretary for Queensland,
seconded by his fellow representative, Mr. Morehead, Postmaster-
General, moved : ?? That, in the opinion of this Conference, it is
desirable that a representation be made to Her Majesty the
Queen, calling her attention to the lamentable state of affairs
existing between the natives of many of the Islands in the
Pacific and the subjects of her Majesty trading in those seas,
more particularly since the appointment of a High Commissioner
for the Pacific; and praying that her Majesty will cause such
action to be taken as will prevent the recurrence of such outrages
against life and property as have lately prevailed.? After
discussion, a Committee was appointed to consider the matters
involved in Mr. Palmer?s resolution, and to examine the papers
relating to the appointment of the High Commissioner.
On the following day, the members of the Conference were
furnished with the following telegram from Sir A. Gordon to
Lord Augustus Loftus : ?I have been informed by telegram
that the Conference proposes to investigate my powers. They
can hardly do this courteously without communicating with me,
or to much purpose without information from me, which I will
furnish if asked for through you,? The extracts from the minutes
of the Conference referring hereto were sent to the Governor, Lord
Augustus Loftus, with a request that they should be forwarded by
wire to Sir Arthur Gordon, with an intimation that they would
willingly receive any information he might desire to communicate by
telegraph.
The members of the Committee with papers before them
showing the powers of Sir Arthur Gordon and the evidence of
the massacres lately committed, were doing their work better
than if inspired by ? information ? supplied by the High Com-
missioner. Put this telegram was merely an attempt to stifle
enquiry, and the only result was the following reply from Sir A,
Gordon to Lord Augustus Loftus :
? Please thank the Conference for the communication of the
extract from the Minutes, and inform them that I shall be happy
to afford them any assistance and information they may desire in


the prosecution of this inquiry. Dated from Cambridge, N.Z.,
22nd January, 1881/?
Sir Arthur has so long been used to settle affairs at Downing-
street that he evidently thought this was sufficient, and no doubt
he would be greatly surprised that the Conference would
act without receiving his ? information ? and explanation,
which he had volunteered, hut never (jave. After much
debate and careful consideration of the subject, Mr. Palmer
brought up the following report from the Committee: ?
? Report of the Committee appointed by the Intercolonial Con-
ference ?to consider the matters involved in Mr. Palmer?s
resolution, and to examine the papers relating to the appointment
of the High Commissioner, and to report to this Conference ?:?
The Committee have to report to the Conference that, after
careful consideration of the Imperial Acts on the subject of the
protection of Natives in the Pacific Islands, and having before
them the Commission to Sir Arthur Gordon, the High Com-
missioner and Consul-General of the said Islands, they are
impressed with the opinion that the powers conferred under the
said Acts and Commission are ineffectual for the protection of the
lives and property of the whites as against the natives, mainly
owing to the absence of sufficient authority for the punishment of
the latter for outrages committed hy them. The Committee are
further of opinion that the numerous massacres and outrages in
the Pacifc Islands of late years have arisen from the lax measures
taken to punish the natives, and the absence of Her Majesty?s
ships of war for long periods. The Committee having fully
deliberated on the subject, have arrived at the following conclu-
sions, which they earnestly recommend for adoption by the
Conference: ?(1.) That it is not desirable the office of High
Commissioner of the Pacific Islands should be vested in the
Governor of any of the Australasian Colonies. (2.) That the
High Commissioner should reside in Fiji or one of the Islands of
Polynesia. (3.) That extended powers should be conferred upon
the High Commissioner for the punishment of Natives of the said
Islands for any crimes or offences committed by them against
British subjects. (4.) That in the case of convictions for
Felony, by the High Commissioner, appeal should be allowed to
the Supreme Court of some one of the Australasian Colonies,
selected at the discretion of the High Commissioner. (5.) That
the powers now exercised hy the High Commissioner should he
transferred, at an early date, to some Federal Court to he estab-
lished in Australasia. (6.) That the more frequent visits of Her
Majesty?s ships among the Islands would have a beneficial effect
upon the Natives, and tend to lessen in a great degree the crimes
now so prevalent.?


Mr. Dick, Colonial Secretary of New Zealand, dissented
from resolutions Nos. 1 and 2.
There was considerable discussion, after which the report, as
amended as follows, was adopted by the Conference : ?Report of
the Committee appointed by the Intercolonial Conference ?to
consider the matters involved in Mr. Palmer?s resolution, and to
examine the papers relating to the appointment of the High
Commissioner, and to report to this Conference?:?The Com-
mittee have to report to the Conference that, after careful
consideration of the Imperial Acts on the subject of the
protection of natives in the Pacific Islands, and having had
before them the Commission to Sir Arthur Cordon, the High
Commissioner and Consul-General of the Western Pacific Islands,
they have agreed to the following resolutions :?(1.) That it is
not desirable that the office of High Commissioner of the Western
Pacific Islands should be vested in the Governor of any of the
Australasian Colonies. (2.) That more effectual means should
be devised for the punishment of natives of the said Islands for
any crimes or offences committed by them against British
subjects. (3) That in the case of capital convictions by the
High Commissioner?s Court, appeal should be allowed to the
Supreme Court of some one of the Australasian Colonies, to be
selected by the High Commissioner. (4.) That the more
frequent visits of her Majesty?s ships among the Islands would
tend to lessen in a great degree the crimes now so prevalent.
Mr. Dick, Colonial Secretary of New Zealand, dissented
from the first resolution.
Mr. Palmer moved (seconded by Mr. Moore), ?That her
Majesty?s Government be moved to take the necessary measures
to give effect to the foregoing resolutions.
Western Australia declined to vote, except on No. 2, which
the representative of that Colony voted for.
At the request of the Conference, the Chairman undertook
to request His Excellency the Governor to communicate with her
Majesty?s Government on the subject, and to forward the
resolutions as agreed upon.
This report has been forwarded by Lord Augustus Loftus to
the Secretary of State for the Colonies. As amended it was not
improved, and the force of the preamble was desh?oyed. Still
as it is, it must do great good if it receives proper attention
from the Home Authorities, and if the recommendations have
due effect, the reign of terror in the Pacific will be over.


THE CRUISE OF THE EMERALD.
Between the naval authorities in the Pacific and the High
Commissioner there has always existed considerable soreness.
Under the powers possessed by the latter the former are helpless
to avenge or protect their countrymen in the South Seas. The
officers of the men-of-war on this station feel the invidious
position in which they are thus placed, and Sir Arthur Gordon is
not loved by them. But when the news arrived in Sydney of
the massacre of Lieutenant Bower and the men of the c< Sandfly,?
it was another affair to the killing of merchant sailors or traders.
The ? Emerald ? was despatched on the Bth December to settle
the account with the natives, as far as Her Majesty?s blue jackets
were concerned. She arrived again in Sydney on January 31,
after a voyage of vengeance amongst the Solomons. The natives
had a lively time of it. It was necessary to kill a British officer
to effect this. It is nearly two years since Mr. Ingham was
killed at Brooker Island, and it is only now that the tribe which
murdered him have been punished. In the round trip there
were a good many villages destroyed, cocoanut trees cut down,
and one or two killed. The natives of course fled into the bush,
into which marines and sailors could not follow them. But shells
and rockets stirred them up. An islander, who was said to be
one of the murderers of Mr. Ingham, has been brought to
Sydney. What on earth will they do with him here ? According
to the law, he should be taken to Fiji, and tried before Judge
Gorrie, in which case one may be sure he will be acquitted, I am
not satisfied with the result. I think a party of Australian
bushmen would give a better account. In this case the real
guilty parties get off, as a shell or rocket may carry death only
to women and children. There seems something mean in firing
on villages from a safe distance. True, all these crimes are the
acts of a community, and they should all suffer?but punish men,
not women and children ! The chiefs should have been captured,
no matter at what cost, and hung. On every island where a
European has been massacred this should have been done, as that
would have been a lesson never forgotten. There is no doubt
the cruise of the ? Emerald? will do good, but the right thing
has been done the wrong way. I object to the cutting down of


hundreds of cocoanut trees. Each of these, it has been calculated,
is, from the time it commences to bear till its natural death,
worth more than �2OO for copra alone, so some thousands of
pounds worth of property has been destroyed. There will be no
tood tor the mouths which are growing up. This seems to me
barbaric warfare. It is only another form of accepting pigs in
compensation for white men's blood. One may be sure that a
section of the press in England will criticise this very unfavorably.
know that when with the French troops during the native
war m New Caledonia, I witnessed the cutting down of many
cocoanut groves. I felt ashamed of the action. I have the same
feeling in this instance. It is said that it is not possible for
white men to penetrate into the thick scrub of the islands In
that case the commander of the ? Emerald ? should have accepted
the assistance of the friendly natives which was offered him.
Uue chief, Tambokoro, expressed himself willing to assist with
fS� p jS pl � m Pumshing the guilty parties concerned in
an y masacre, if Captain Maxwell would allow them
to wear a distinguishing mark so that they would be known
from the hostile natives. Captain Maxwell, however, declined
Turn � 16 that all he wanted was native guides.
1 hold that this was a great mistake. The insurrection in New
Caledonia was only put down by the aid of the native auxiliaries.


EVIDENCE FROM THE DEAD.
On the 9th of February, Mr. Combes, C.M.G., who has
displayed great zeal in agitating this subject, gave notice, that
on the Ist of March he would propose a motion as follows :
? That this House resolve itself into a committee of the whole to
consider the expediency of petitioning her Majesty the Queen
with reference to the better protection of the lives, liberties and
property of her Majesty?s subjects in the Western Pacific.
2. That the above resolution be communicated by address to
His Excellency the Governor.? On the 19th of February I
wrote in the Sydney Daily Telegraph : ?? It may be said that
the resolution of the Intercolonial Conference was sufficient, but
it might have been more forcible, and it is very certain that a
representation from the Parliament of New South Wales would
add weight to the despatch sent to the Secretary for the Colonies.
In the Conference, this question was brought up by the delegates
from Queensland. That Colony is deeply affected thereby, but
so, too, is this, and it is surprising that here more notice has not
been taken of these frightful massacres. Besides the outrages
committed on vessels belonging to Queensland, New Zealand,
and Fiji, within the last six months, the commanders and crews
of live vessels belonging to Sydney have been massacred, and the
ships destroyed, looted, or damaged. Let me enumerate them?
the ? Ripple,? steamer, the ? Esperanza,? the ?Zephyr,? the
? Lcelia,? the ?Annie Brooks.? Five master mariners, whose
homes were in Sydney, have been victims. Of these, four were
married, and leave widows and families behind them. Captain
Alexander Ferguson, of the ?Ripple? was unmarried. Captain
James MGntosh, of the ? Esperanza,? was married. His brother-
in-law, Peter Gaffney, the mate, who was also killed, was a native
of Sydney. Captain Marshall, of the ?Zephyr,? was married.
Captain Murray, of the ? Lcelia,? was married. Captain Forman,
of the ?Annie Brooks,? was married; and James Purday, part
owner of the vessel, also leaves a widow in Sydney. Five
widows, five families of fatherless children are now in our midst.
These all want help and assistance. The Shipwrecked Mariners?
Society has given a little, private friends have done somewhat, in
one case an appeal has been made to the public; but still


poverty must follow through the untimely death of the bread-
winners. In the case of the man Pense, who was so severely
injured on board the ?Ripple/? public charity is immediately
taxed, as he is now an inmate of the Benevolent Asylum at
1 arramatta. Brought home to our very doors, as these things
are, 1 arliainent should certainly bestir itself; but in a more
material point of view, Hew South Wales has directly suffered by
the recent outrages.
The name of Cowlishaw stands deservedly high in Sydney
for qualities other than those which go to make successful
merchants. It is known and esteemed outside the Exchange and
the Shipping _ Office. The other day I called at the office of
Messrs. Cowlishaw Brothers to ascertain if the owners of the
?Ripple ? and the ? Esperanza ? had received any fresh news
from the seat of war in the Solomon Islands, and could give me
any information as to the families of the murdered men. This
ought to have been done before; but I had trusted to the daily
press for the mere details of the sad events chronicled within the
last few months. What I heard from Mr. Cowlishaw, and which
I publish with his permission, will, I think, astonish the Austra-
lian public. Six years since Cowlishaw Brothers determined to
go largely into the island trade. The firm established several
trading stations in the Solomons, had twelve vessels engaged
there, including two steamers, and employed a large of
men. The sum of �24,000 was invested in the venture. It
must be remembered that at this time traffic with the islanders
had been carried on by individual white traders in peace and with
profit. Messrs. Cowlishaw organized an enterprise to be worked
systematically in a manner which should not have failed to be
highly advantageous to the natives as to themselves. They
engaged in their service many of the old traders and merchant
captains who were acquainted with the islands and the customs of
the aborigines. Isolated cases of outrage there may have been
up to this time, but still a white man was respected in the
Solomons. He did not?if he defended his life?do so with a
rope round his neck, the noose of which would be tightened by
Judge Gorrie at Fiji. And the British men-of-war on the
Pacific station then kept their flag and their race respected, and
demanded swift retribution for any offences committed b} 7 - the
savages. But with the advent of Sir Arthur Gordon and Judge
Gorrie in Fiji there was a gradual reversal of the old order of
things. Two years ago the trading station of Messrs. Cowlishaw
at Marau, in the island of Guadalcanal?, was attacked and burnt
by the natives, and property to the amount of �6OO, and a small
vessel which cost �l5O, were destroyed, and a white man killed.
Captain Ferguson made a representation of the circumstances and


a demand for justice to the commander of the first man-of-war he
met, but was told nothing could be done. When the news came
to Sydney Mr. Oowlishaw waited on Commodore Wilson, and
renewed the complaint, with a plea for justice. The reply given
him was : ? I can do nothing. I can do nothing. Everything
which relates to the islands is in the hands of the High Commis-
sioner., Sir Arthur Gordon.?
Messrs. Cowlishaw appear to have thought it useless to
appeal for protection to Sir Arthur Gordon, whose associate.
Judge Gorrie, had just decided that he had no jurisdiction to
punish a native for any offence committed against a white man.
But daily the islanders became more insolent. With a knowledge
of perfect immunity from punishment, they acquired a contempt
for the white traders. A succession of outrages commenced :
Messrs. Cowlishaw?s agents and traders were harassed and
annoyed in every way ?commerce ceases to be pleasant under
such circumstances. When a savage chief sends word that ho is
coming to eat you, or secure your head as a trophy, and you
know that he will do it if he gets a chance, and that neither
justice nor vengeance will be meted out to him, life then becomes
too eventful. This is what Messrs. Cowlishaw?s agents have
been subject to for the last two years, culminating in the
massacres on board the ? Ripple ? and the ? Esperanza.? The
result of this firm?s experience of the rule of Sir Arthur Gordon
and Judge Gorrie is that the South Sea trade has to be given up.
After the events of the last twelve months, white agents will not
stop on the Islands. 'ln the old days we were safe, now no
white man?s life is worth a minute?s purchase.? Thus they write
to Messrs. Cowlishaw. So, after a large outlay of capital, these
gentlemen have to endure a considerable loss and retire from a
branch of commerce in which they had taken every step to
secure a deserved success, but which has been ruined by the
actions, the deeds of omission and commission, of the High and
Judicial Commissioners of Polynesia.
Captain Ferguson was impressed with the fact that unless
some change was made in the administration of justice between
the white and native races in the South Seas, the trade in the
Solomons would have to be abandoned. Before his murder he
had been obtaining signatures to the following petition, which
has been handed to me by Mr. Cowlishaw :
"To the Right Honorable the Secretary of State for the
?Colonies, ?
" The memorial of the British traders and merchants
engaged in commerce within the territories comprised in the
jurisdiction of the High Commissioner of the Western Pacific,
humbly sheweth:?


<c 1. That we, the traders and merchants engaged in the
traffic of the above islands, are deeply interested in our lives and
property, in the maintenance of peace and tranquillity, and the
preservation of law and order in the above islands.
?2. That the powers and jurisdiction of the present Sigh.
Commission have proved inadequate for our protection in our
lawful occupations; that since its institution we have been
plundered of our property, that our agents, have been murdered,
and that for these outrages we have not obtained any redress ; and
in consequence of the inadequate punishment inflicted, our lives
are unsafe, and that the prosecution of commerce under the British
flag in these seas will shortly become impossible.
? 3. That in consequence of the inconvenient locality of the
High Commissioner?s Court, we are unable to avail ourselves of
the civil jurisdiction of that court, and that the expense
consequent on prosecutions at Fiji, a place with which we have
no intercourse, compels us to submit to the exactions of
swindlers rather than seek the expensive remedy of redress at
law.
?4. That with all respect we show that the Governor of a
Crown colony cannot, from his position, possess the leisure or
judicial impartiality so desirable in a person filling the office of
High Commissioner.
? And we humbly pray.
?1. That you will cause the transference of the High
Commissioner ViCourt to Sydney, with which place we are in
constant communication.
?2. That her Majesty?s Government will assume juris-
diction over the native population of these islands, and thus
afford us protection in our lives and property.
?3. That the office of Deputy-Commissioner be vested in
the commanders of H.M. ships of war, and that they be
empowered to hear and try cases, both criminal and civil, on the
spot; and to reserve such cases as they deem advisable for the
consideration of the High Court.
?4. That where it is proved that wanton murder and
outrage have been perpetrated by the natives, the commanders
of H.M. ships be authorised to punish such offenders as have been
convicted.
?5. That we humbly show that by such measures only can
the honour of the British name and the cause of humanity be

This petition was never finished nor presented. Captains
Ferguson and MHntosh are now dead, but their hands bear testi-
mony to the causes which occasioned their murders and that of
their fellow-sufferers. This posthumous protest appeals for
vengeance for the dead and justice to the living.
Here are some stern facts for our Parliament to deal with.
A Sydney firm of the highest standing has sustained a heavy loss
and had to relinquish one branch of its trade. The widows and
orphans of four merchant captains belonging to this port are here
in a more or less distressed condition. One man is in a public
institution maimed for life. The dead are gone. What repara-
tion can be made to the living ? Beyond an appeal to the
ordinary instincts of charity it may be said that these cases
present no special claim to the sympathy of the public of this
colony. When I see that only �77 was collected for the widow
and children of Captain Murray, I should imagine that to be the
general impression. But believing as I do that the blood of
these murdered husbands and fathers rests on the heads of
incompetent officials; and these wives were widowed, these
children made fatherless by the laches of the Imperial authorities;
and knowing that this is not only my belief, but that of every
white man in the Pacific, I would suggest that a proper repre-
sentation be made to the Home authorities asking that a sum of
money be granted to the sufferers by the results of the South
Sea massacres. This might be deducted from the High Commis-
sioner?s Fund, or the salaries of Sir Arthur Gordon and Judge
Gorrie. In face of these facts I have instanced can any resolu-
tion, any motion passed by Parliament, be too strong ? I trust
that every ? white man ? in the House will support Mr. Combes,
and raise his voice and give his vote towards putting down the
crying iniquity of the High Commissioner?s misrule in the South
Seas.?


Here the question at present rests, but it is necessary that
it should not be allowed to drop. The experience of the past
shows that Imperial authority has paid little attention to the
white bond slaves of Sir Arthur Gordon, the residents of Fiji,
in Europe, Asia, or Africa, millions have been spent on wars
undertaken by the British Government to avenge the death of
one or two. In the Pacific Englishmen are slain by the dozen,
and the High Commissioner makes no sign, he will not admit by
action that his whole policy has been wrong. The mildew of
Dowmng-street must not be allowed to collect on the petition
sent by the Conference. The voice of the Colonies must be
loudly heard in this matter, which so vitally concerns them.
Australians! Englishmen! "White Men? all! Eaise
VOUR VOICES AND AID IN PUTTING AN END TO THE OUTRAGES IN THE
�outh Seas, caused by the misrule op Sir Arthur Gordon and
?Judge Gorrie.


APPENDIX.
ACTION OF THE HON. E. COMBES, C.M.G.
The Hon. E. Combes, C.M.GI-., has withdrawn his motion on this subject, and has
substituted the following, which he has given notice of his intention of moving on
the sth April:?
1. That the following humble address be presented to Her Majesty :
To Her Most Gracious Majesty, Yictoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, Empress of India, Defender of the Faith, &c. &c. &c.
May it please your Majesty, ?
We, your Majesty?s loyal and faithful servants, members of the Legislative
Assembly of New South Wales, humbly desire to respectfully bring under your
Majesty?s gracious consideration the insecurity of the lives, liberties, and property of
British subjects in the islands of the Pacific Ocean, and to humbly pray your
Majesty to cause an inquiry to be made into the working of the High Commissioner?s
Court for the Western Pacific, with a view of instituting trial by jury, and the
extending to your Majesty?s subjects in that part of the world those rights which
are commonly enjoyed under the British Constitution.
We feel assured that the extension of these rights will strengthen the sentiments
of affection, loyalty, and devotion which are entertained for your Majesty by all
classes of your Majesty?s faithful subjects in the Australasian colonies.
2. That an address be presented to the Governor, praying that his Excellency
will be pleased at the earliest opportunity to transmit the foregoing address to the
principal Secretary of State for the Colonies, for presentation to Her Majesty.
CORRESPONDENCE WITH LORD LOFTUS.
The author wrote the following letter to His Excellency Lord Augustus Loftus,
Governor of New South Wales :
Sydney, March Ist, 1881.
To His Excellency
The Right Hon. Lord Augustus Loftus, G.C.B.
My Lord,?l have the honour to draw your attention to the enclosed article
from the Sydney Daily Telegraph , relating to the petition of Captain Ferguson and
other South Sea traders with respect to the powers possessed by the High Com-
missioner of the Western Pacific, and the recent deplorable outrages on British sub-
jects committed by the natives of the Solomon Islands.
This came into my possession by accident, after the sittings of the Intercolonial
Conference had terminated, otherwise it would have been brought under the notice
D 2


of that body. As a public journalist [I made use of it, but I do not think my
duty ends there. The petition was never finished, Captain Ferguson and another
master mariner who signed it, are amongst the victims. Messrs. Cowlishaw
Brothers have, as set forth, given up their trade in the Islands, and nothing further
will be done in the matter. But is not the testimony of these eleven names of some
weight ? Should not the petition of the dead be heard ? These men were inhabi-
tants of New South ales, and I presume the petition would have been presented
to your Lordship to be forwarded to the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Can it
not be forwarded now ?
If, in addressing you, my Lord, in this instance, I am appealing to the wrong
quarter, I trust your Lordship will pardon me. The great interest I take in this
question must be my excuse. I feel that a sacred obligation rests upon me to give
effect to the intentions of the dead. If your Lordship will kindly receive the petition
it would perhaps be best to have it endorsed by Messrs. Cowlishaw, and to attach
evidence as to the genuineness of the signatures, which I can easily obtain.
I have the honour to be,
Your Lordship?s most obedient Servant,
JULIAN THOMAS.
To this letter a reply was received from the Governor?s Private Secretary, as-
follows ;
Government House, Sydney,
4 th March, 1881.
Sir,?l am directed by His Excellency the Governor to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter of the Ist instant, enclosing a copy of a petition to the Secre-
tary of State for the Colonies, and in reply to inform you that the subject matter in
the petition does not come within the jurisdiction of His Excellency, but appertains
to the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific, and consequently it should be
forwarded through His Excellency Sir Arthur Gordon.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
REGINALD BLOXSOME.
Julian Thomas, Esq.
There would be little chance of Sir Arthur Gordon forwarding a petition con-
taining such a terrible indictment of his misrule in the Pacific. So the author
retains this in his possession, a sacred trust, waiting until public opinion in Australia
and Great Britain shall tear asunder the red tape of Downing-street, and the voices
of the dead be at last heard.
