TO
J. D. THOMAS, Esq., M.D.,
THE FOLLOWING EFFORT
IS
getoteii
BY THE AUTHOR,
AS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OK THE KIND AND SKILFUL TREATMENT
WHICH HE HAS RECEIVED
AT HIS HANDS.


PRELUDE.
There is an altar whereon all
Below the circumscribing skies,
Xo matter whether fools, or wise,
Or young, or old, or great, or small,
Must place some sort of sacrifice.
For men, although we call them men,
Have not had equal talents given
(In somewhat, doubtless, all are even) ;
But some have one, and some have ten,
And some, perhaps, may have eleven.
Yet, something each is bound to spare,
And all can spare who use aright,
And no one should another slight
When each presents his proper share,
Even though that be a widow’s mite.
Upon this altar now I place
My gift —(a man of humble birth) —
A meagre gleaning from God’s earth ;
And sorrow doth suffuse my face
To think that gift so little worth.


But if tie meanest offering,
Which on that altar yet hath lain,
Has had the blessing of the King,
Who knows the value of each thing,
Then mine may not be made in vain.
* * *
For one, with common toil and care,
May shift a mound of common mould,.
And yet no treasure may behold ;
While walking o’er his labor there
Another comes and finds the gold.
A little noise about the house
Can wake a man disposed to snore t
The sound of footfalls on the floor,
Sometimes the moving of a mouse,
Or slamming of a distant door.
There are some questions which intrude >
Both in the country and the town,
Which chill the flow of genial blood ■>
The thoughtful find them bitter food;
The gay attempt to dance them down.
Man’s thirst for knowledge knows no bound f
He cannot leave the Dark alone ;
The deepest flood he needs must sound ;
We find him quizzing underground ;
We see him prying into stone.


For somewhat he inclines to prohe,
Nor knows he how to calm his mind
(It was so in the days of Job) ;
He gropes and gropes at Nature’s robe,
But ’tis the groping of the blind.
I offer what ? a cure ? alas !
A few suggestions at the most;
For as, in Observation’s glass,
I saw Life’s strange procession pass
I tried to estimate the host.
Nor ask I how your sympathies
Incline, my candid critic friend ;
We both must reach our journey’s end.
'See you yon light along the skies ?
.Up ! upward ! Let us both ascend !
I have my failings —so have you ;
Deal fairly by me where I err.
I’m but a poor, weak worshipper :
A searcher for the Hood and True.
Are your intentions honest, sir ?
Then take my gift. Tour heart shall be
My altar ; take it; take it even
As I present it—plainly given.
The sacred fire springs not from me,
That sanctifiearcomes from Heaven.
February, 1881.


THE PHILOSOPHER.
SCENE I.
A FARMHOUSE PARLOUR.
The Farmer's Wife lighting a lamp and attending to other
matters, ichen enter Farmer.
Farmer.
O wife, ’tis good to be alive ! This day
Has been a charmer! When I rose at morn,
A little while before the sun, and saw
The deep green cornfields wet with heavy dew,
And the soft clouds blown lazily across
The fresh blue sky ; and heard the merry voices
Of 'pies and larks making their melody —•
Well! well! I thought, and is it possible
'T thousands are missing this ? that thousands still
Are lying in their beds in shameful sleep ?
Small wonder is there then that many need
The clear stuff in the bottle, or the strong


And nauseous doses which the chemists mix
To patch up fools to keep them on the move !
O, then I said, that time were made of mornings ;
And felt the wish, I almost felt the will,
To live a thousand years. But that has gone.
I saw the day-light spread across the sky ;
I saw the golden sun sail higher up,
And bathe God’s lovely world in light, and send
A wave of life across both land and sea,
From the high mountain tops, down to the very
Deepest raviny gulfs where sea-weed grows ,
And curious monsters swim. That, too, has gone
The sun again hath set, and solemn Night,
With all the stars, is over us once more.
And I have drank, as flow’rets drink the dew,
A precious draught of immortality,
Distill’d from those sweet orbs. One in the west
Is making mockery now of your poor lamp ;
Will you not come and see it shining, dear ?
Wife.
Why, bless me, husband, you astonish me !
You speak so fine, like people speak in books ;
The season with its good appearances
Has got your spirits up. Have you so soon
Forgot the past ? Ecmember ’65.
Fabmee.
Forget it, say you rather. What’s the use
Of meeting trouble half-way P We should never
Look out for disappointments : ’tis enough
To meet them when they come. The wiser part


Is to rejoice o’er what we have to-day
Although to-morrow we may need to weep.
Just come and see this star ; ’twill do you good !
Wife.
To please you then, my husband, since you press,
I’ll come and see it. We have all our spheres
And ought all to be shiners, like the stars.
And don’t I shine, my dear ?
Fabmee.
Indeed you do!
These five-and-twenty years your lovely light
Has been on the ascendant. There have been
Eclipses of the sun and of the moon,
And occultations of the lesser lights ;
With you there have been clouds, but no eclipse ;
And with a lustre better and more bright
Than Venus at the full, you’re shining still
In your own quiet sphere, on me at least.
[They go out, when enter Agues with a hunch
of flowers.
Agnes.
Well, well! Just like my mother : she must have
Her hand in everything! The book I left
Upon the table here has been removed ;
The crochet cover’s on the looking-glass ;
And my piano’s loaded like a shelf !
Now, this is order with a vengeance ! I
, Do wish my mother would content herself
By letting things alone. Such worrying


Will wear her poor life out before the time.
She should consider I was born with hands,
And I was taught to use them. Let me see —■
Where has she put my knitting ?
\_Be-enter Paemee and Wife.
Wife.
Well, my child,
You’ve brought a bouquet then. Why did you not
Turn round the other side towards the light ?
See, that looks better now! No roses in it ?
A bouquet, girl, is nought without a rose.
Agnes.
I could not pull them, mother; they did seem
So very sweet. The dew was on their leaves,
And as they hung their lovely heads, I thought
They were too beautiful to be so soon
Deprived of their existence.
Motiiee.
Did you learn
Such lessons from your teacher ? Don’t you know
The best without is best within? ’Tis not
A batch of common bloom we want to see
Here on our parlor table, but a posy
Of the most precious flowers. Come, my child,
And let us have some music, for your father’s
Good heart is full.
Paemee.
Yes, Agnes, so it is ;;
A mellow tune would quite transport me now.
But sing and play, and let me hear your voice


Above the instrument; for unto me
No sound so pleasing as the human voice.
[Agnes places herself at the piano, and begins
playing .
THE LOVER’S GIFT.
I bring to my loved one a present of bloom,
All full of the sunshine, and full of perfume ;
Where every rich virtue, below and above,
Are sweetly commingled, like beauty and love —
An offering well worthy, tho’ offered by me,
The pure sunny eyes of my charmer to see.
Their odour will vanish, their beauty will fade,
Else would they resemble my own dearest maid :
Their graceful construction, their colors which shine,.
Their sweet breathing odour, and virtue are thine.
Their odour will vanish, their beauty will fade,
Else would they resemble my own dearest maid.
Receive them, my charmer, as sign that this breast
Has yielded unto thee its brightest and best;
Receive them as token, my loved one, that I
Resign me unto thee to live or to die !
But death in thy sunny embraces will be
The richest of earth’s richest blessings to me.
I'aemek.
"Well played ; well sung ; yet is it not my taste r
It might have "been some twenty years ago.
Wife.
’Tis five and twenty years since we were wed!
You surely have forgotten ! Agnes, dear,
Can’t you play something better ? We are not
Yet tired of listening to you. Play away !


SONG.
Tell me where the treasure lies
Which true lovers value most ?
Is it under Indian skies?
Or on Australasian coast ?
Good and fair, rich and rare,
Must that precious treasure be
Which true lovers value most.
Not in mines below the ground,
Neither can the ocean boast,
But in every land is found
What true lovers value most.
Diamonds shine ; gold is fine ;
But that treasure far excels
Which true lovers value most.
Lightly in the public mart
Oft is passed that gem of cost.
In a good and honest heart
Lies what lovers value most;
Large and whole —a faithful soul,
Is that pure and precious thing
Which true lovers value most.
Farmer.
Well, well! Love seems about as plentiful
As it Has ever been ; our modern songs
Begin, continue —aye, and finish with it.
O bappy age ! we cannot praise a flower
But love must be referr’d to : and the tune
Of grammar, too, is mostly set to love.
It augurs well, perhaps ; but I had rather
Hear less, and see more. Don’t think, Agnes dear,


I aim at you ; it is the stupid poets
I would censure. They seem all
Demented by the moon or something else.
The last song was the better; it had not
So many flowers about it, but more heart;
And, old’s I am, I still am fond of heart —
’Tis not too plentiful. Did some one knock ?
Yes —there it is again ! Who can it be ?
[Rises and opens the door.
Philosophee.
Q-ood evening, sir !
Paemee.
Good evening!
Philos.
I have lost
My way, and am benighted. Could you give
Me shelter till the morning ? My poor limbs
Have borne me well to-day, but now they fail.
Paemee.
Ho need of that. Come in! We would be poor
Could we not shelter you, were you as fresh
As a young kangaroo. Come in ! come in !
Wife.
Sit on the sofa, sir ! Give me your hat, ;
And let me have your cloak. Why, sir, you seerr
Uncommon weary ! Have you travell’d far ?
Philos.
Yes, ma’am, I’ve travell’d twenty miles to-day.
Thanks for your kindness! Do not trouble so


About my comfort; do not let me put
You thus about; don’t trouble so for me !
Wife.
Don’t mention trouble ! We don’t think it trouble
To entertain a stranger. Would you like
A wash ; it will refresh you ?
Philos.
Thank you much :
You are too kind ; don’t let me trouble you.
This rest will bring me round.
Par:siee.
You need a rest;
But, sir, a little food will give you strength.
\_Enter Agues with a cup of tea and slice of
bread and butter.
Wipe.
Take this, good sir, the while my daughter makes you
Something substantial ready. Agnes, haste !
Philos.
No, no ; don’t trouble the young lady !
. ’Tis rest I need, not food.
Faemee.
But with an empty
Stomach you cannot rest. Take something first;
This talking worries you.
Philos.
Yes ; thank you much !
[Faemee and Wife retire.


SCENE II.
MONTEFIORE HILL, NOETH ADELAIDE.
Haeold, a friend of the Piiilosopiiee’s, conversing with
Petee, an acquaintance of his.
Haeold.
I tremble for my friend: be is so bent
On gaining knowledge that he seems to set
Too light a value on his precious life.
There is no sacrifice too great for him
To make in gathering knowledge. Pie reminds
Me of the first Disciples, who forsook
Their all to follow Him, the Light from Heaven.
As great his zeal; but more than questionable
Whether his calling will repay like theirs.
Petee.
I doubt it much; Ido not like to see
A young man driving headlong as he drives.
Something must needs give way, for man is man ;
And even the best of engines ever made
Works not at over-pressure over long.
Can nought be done to stop him ?
Haeold.
Much I fear
He has o’ergrown my counsel. Have you heard
Of his late illness ?


Petee.
No ; Has He been ill ?
Haeold.
Aye, very ill; and pris’ner’d to His bed —
A stranger’s bed —for weeks ; and all because
Of His desire for knowledge. Solomon
Commends tHe criers after knowledge ; but,
Could He have seen our friend, I do not think
"We would have seen that verse. He more than cries—
THe other week He walked some twenty miles,
In a low state of health, to gratify
This craving that He Has ; which, as I said,
Cost him some weeks in bed. But Providence
Sent him some worthy friends, and brought him round.
But here he comes !
[.'Enter Philosophee.
Philos.
Good day, my valued friends!
Petee & Haeold.
Good day, sir!
Philos.
"Well, Harold, what’s the news P
Haeold.
The latest, sir, you bring! You need not speak,
’Tis in your face; your health is leaving you !
O, sir, I think you study too severely
In Thought’s dark chambers. It is well to toil,
But yet not to excess. What says John Locke ?


Philos.
Tes, yes, I know ; I recollect his words.
Sinking ships with cargo —is it not ?
Harold.
Exactly, sir ! and don’t you think the words
Apply to such as you ? I fear, good sir,
You’re weighting down your vessel by degrees.
Philos.
Poor frail concern! Why, have you never read
That frailty means man ? And should I break
This, my frail vessel, after bringing home
A load of valuables, what do I lose P
I trust I do not spend my strength for nothing !
Harold.
True, sir, you do not. But you are not called
To make such sacrifices. Did you know
The cold ingratitude with which the world
Will pay this toil of yours, perhaps you’d pause.
0 sir! believe me, man was never meant
To act beyond his power. You do mistake
The purpose of your being when you thus
Deny yourself so much.
Philos.
Deny myself so much !
Did you but know the pleasure which the philosophic
mind
Derives from deep investigation, you
Would think this much denial small indeed.
B


Haeold.
It may seem small to you ; but you have gone
Too far beyond the bouudsHo judge yourself.
The gain which you derive from knowledge, sir,
Is only fancied gain. True happiness
Lies nearer home, and is far cheaper bought.
Look at the man blest with a loving wife
And half-a-dozen children. Will your knowledge
Give you his happy heart ? He has his cares,
His sorrows, and his fears ; but, taking all
Into consideration, he has still
An ample margin left for thankfulness.
Philos.
And what, my friend, must I infer from this ?
That I should take a wife ; that I should rear
A half-a-dozen children ; and give o’er
This “ searching after knowledge,” as you call it P
Ho you so advise me, my good friend ?
Haeold.
Yes, sir ; I think, and not without good cause,
You would be better mated. All the joys
Which you or any other can derive
Prom anything external is but poor
When measured with the heart; cold, icy cold,
Is love of knowledge to the love of kind.
’Tis true we need, nay, cannot do without,
A certain share of knowledge ; but to choose
Knowledge itself before all other good
Is not the best of policies, believe me !


This you will yet discover. That which makes
Man better feel, live longer, better look,
Cannot be bad. Now hear me ! Seek you out
A proper partner ; exercise your heart
With all the joys and sorrows of your kind,
And you may be redeem’d. But if you run
The course which you are running—trust me, sir—■
It may be bright; but long it cannot be !
Phiios.
It grieves me much to hear you underrate,
And meanly circumscribe, the toil of mind.
With cruel shears you’d clip the wild swan’s, wings
And chain the eagle in a cursed cage.
Why cramp the soul, which Glod unfetter’d sent
Into His world, with manacles and gyves ?
No profit in this knowledge ! What! No profit
To comprehend the goings of the sea ;
The motions of the airy currents vast;
The gatherings of the clouds ; the generation
Of rain, snow, hail, and the commixture
Of gases in the dreaded lightning flash ;
To tell the age of earth from serried strata,
And her commotions in those jolted rifts
Which made the hills, and understand their cause —■
Those dread disturbances which central fires
Keep rousing into action ; or to be able
To lift one’s eyes up to the starry host
And tell the nature, and the mystic order
Of suns and systems, flying round like wheels,
In some vast engine room, performing what
b 2


God only knows, and yet with toil and patience
Perhaps we’ll learn. And then to turn about
Prom this expansive vision, and on life
Cast vivid glances, as it runs below,
Like brancby rivers from their fountain heads
In central mountain chains. To be able
To look on nations, with their governments
And policies, as on men ; on men as mice,
Or little timepieces, no two alike —
But with their jaggy wheels, and shaky hands,
Telling a thousand lies about the march
Of the same sun, is power worth having !
Habold.
Yes, if usable —power for a God !
But, in the hands of men like us, such power
Is like that ponderous lever, wherewith one
Could lift the world, had he a base whereon
To place his motor —unapplicable !
Useless power is like an elephant in air,
Or ocean’s monster on a desert dry :
Women may stare, and schoolboys gaze and gape,
While men bestride them for sage purposes—
Say North Pole explorations ! Can’t you smile P
All knowledge is not power ! and you may find
This easier than your other findings, did
You only turn your eyes the proper way.
My friend, the knowledge—
Call it Philosophy, or what you please,
Which makes the man look old before his time,
Is not the knowledge Human Nature needs.


Philos.
Then you are serious, friend! You argue well,
But rather tend to frighten than convince.
You wish my welfare, willingly I grant;
But much I doubt the way you’d work it out.
Haeold.
And do you think ’tis best to live alone ?
Philos.
Yes, sir ; for such as me. All men, you know,
Cannot receive some sayings.
Haeold.
"Will not, rather.
Philos.
What came of him who found America ?
Of him who told the planetary tale ?
Of him who wrote the People’s Liberty ?
Of him, perhaps the brightest and the best
Of all the sons of wisdom ? Did they not
More value than their lives their callings high ?
Haeold.
True, sir ; but you have gone beyond your teachers ;
Those whom you name were welded to their kind
By ties to which you are as yet a stranger :
Well they knew the value of affection—
That a wife was no mean helper.
Philos.
Yes, Harold ; now you speak! I have myself
Been coming to conclusions somewhat like
By pure induction.


Harold.
Then, Amen !
Peter.
Amen!
Harold.
Just one word more : don’t let the iron cool ;
But heat out your ideas while they’re warm ;
For when in life we cross a certain line
Some longings leave us, as the apples leave
The tree when winter comes.
Philos.
Too true, my friend.
How, Peter, what say you ? Have you a wife ?
Peter.
Tes.
Philos.
Well, and what beside—
A half-a-dozen children P Don’t you feel
Them burdensome —the number over great ?
Peter.
Ho, not at all, good sir. When we had one
I used to think that Mary Ann and me
Had love enough to spare to bring it up :
I used to wonder much how people did
With ten and twelve. But when we ran our score
To numbers two and three, we found that love
Kept growing with them ; found, too, that our care
Grew nothing greater, for we plainly saw


That one could help another. So you see
Love multiplies itself, and in its arms
Could hold an hundred children.
Thugs,
~W onderf ul!
This love affair is truly wonderful!
[.Enter Beggab, led by a Little Boy.
Little Box.
Please, sirs, will you assist a blind man ?
Philos.
Is he your father ?
L. B.
No, sir.
Hah old.
My poor man, how came you to get blind ? By
falling over a precipice when drunk —eh ?
Blind Man.
0 no, sur ! I was never given to any of them beastly
habits, sur. It was a powder explosion which
took away my sight, sur !
Philos.
Have you a wife ?
B. M.
1 have none, sorrows the day, sur.
Philos.
Had you any illness before you lost your sight ?


B. M.
Thank G-od ! I never had an hour’s sickness in my
life before that, sur.
Philos.
And what did your .master do for you when you
met with the accident ?
B. M.
The misfortune happened on a Thursday morning,,
sur ; and he paid me the full week.
Philos.
And was that all ?
B. M.
It was, sur.
llaeold. (Aside.)
He “ surs ” well; a little practice goes a long way.
Philos.
Now listen to me, old fellow. You have made a mis-
take somewhere. Had you done as you should
when you had your sight you would not have
been begging now. Like the bees, you should
have considered that a winter was likely to come,
and hived a little against the cold weather.
Here’s a shilling : take care of it. Warn this
boy of the mistake you made—be a lighthouse.
Poor old fellow, in one sense, I am sorry for
you.


B. M.
Thank you, sur ! may your wife never want bread or
any other good thing: and may yer childer
prove blessings when ould age comes on ye both.
Harold. (Aside.)
Now is not that a pretty little rhyme ?
Philos.
Good-bye, my friends, we yet will meet again.
Harold.
A true good-bye ! I have some money left.
Peter.
Good-bye, dear sir !
[Exit Philosopher.
Harold. (Aside.)
Now let us have a talk with this old fool, and taste
his bread and cheese! That gent has gone. His
lecturing is out of fashion now : it is heavy
stuff, and heavy stuff is hard to swallow. Aqua
vitce has ever been in demand. It gives legs to the
lame, sight to the blind, and wisdom to the
foolish, as those know who have tried it.
B. M.
Shure yer right, sur! A glass or two of the crater
does nobody harm. Was the gentleman that
spoke a parson, sur.
Harold.
A sort of one. You could tell it by his talk, could
you not ?


B. M.
Indaad I could, plase yer honour, as asey desave my
nose with the smell of a whisky barrel, as
desave my hearing, sur.
Harold.
And do you only beg for a living, old man ? Don’t
you ever thing about turning poet ? A good
many of them have been blind men like your-
self. Indeed, a person can scarcely be a poet
without being blind, in our times at any rate.
You should compose ballads, or steal pieces, or
get some one to steal them for you, and stick
them together, and sing them. This would bring
you in many a bright sixpence, and many a sweet
jug of beer.
B. M.
Yer honour, and don’t I sometimes sing, then?
Harold.
Then, by all means let us have one of your songs, and
then, something better. (Aside) Here, my boy ;
run for sixpence worth of buns — (Louder)
refreshments !
[B. M. takes off Ins hat and, begins singing,
when exit Harold and Peter.
PATER MARRONEY.
When Pater Marroney was stricken stone blind,
He never a friend or acquaintance could find ;
He praised up the rich, and he flattered the poor,
Yet they bowl’d him about, like a ball, from their door.


But Providence, touched with true pity to see
A poor human being neglected like he,
Sent down a small token, to bring him some joy
And help him along —a poor dog and a boy.
And so the ould creature goes begging for bread ;
And often and often bould Pater has said—
“ I’m thankful for white bread, I’m thankful for brown ;
“ Man never was made, sure, to starve in a town.”
Said Pater one day, sorrow-hearted, “ I’ll try
“ The good honest soul of swate Biddy McKie.
“ The money I’ve saved up may buy us a cow;
“ And Pater may churn, tho’ his honour can’t plough.’
My dog and my bsy led me on to the door,
Where often I’d met with my Biddy before.
“ Here comes honest Pater, my beautiful maid,”
As entering the door of her dwelling I said.
“ Och, dear ! ” I said sadly, “ my friends have all gone
“ But you my swate Biddy, my Biddy alone.
<l The frosts of misfortune which come from above
“ May blast all the bloom, but it spares the true love.
\kM~
u And Biddy, remember the days whioh have gone,
u When, like a swate angel, you called me your own :
“ O, Biddy, my darling, come wed wid me now !
“ I’ll churn you the cream, while yourself milks the cow.”
Says Biddy to Pater, “ It’s bad enough, shure,
“ For any poor creature to marry the poor ;
“ But better be widdie for ever than join’d
“ To one without silver, besides being blind.
“ Och, Pater 1 your blarney may well make me laugh ;
“ Begone wid yer cow, for yourself is a calf.
“ I can work for myself, my bould fellow, I trow;
“ Begone, you bould Pater ! begone wid ye now ! ”


So Pater was driv’ broken-hearted away ;
But, arrah ! the boys, the bright fellows, they say
That Pater mistook his own Biddy, and said
Love to her ould mother, the widdie, instead.
And now, my brave gentles, your hearts pray incline ;
Heaven grant that your woe may be never like mine.
The sore pangs of sorrow be sure and assuage ;
For we’re living, you know, in a gunpowder age.
[Extends his hat.


SCENE III.
ADELAIDE: A CITY SQUARE.
Haeold and Philosopher seated, conversing.
Haeold.
How like you our young city ?
Philos.
W ondrous well!
Tlie site is excellent; on graceful swells :
Hot flat and dull, or rough and inconvenient,
But just as it should be ; and as it stands
The air sweeps round it freely. The near Gulf
Tones down the summer breezes ; yon dark range
"Walls back the barren east wind ; the fresh gums
And the suburban gardens give the place
A rural look ; while these convenient squares
Are splendid breathing places for such men
As you and I.
Haeold.
Yes, that they are indeed !
Though not a city lover, as a rule,
I love our city : not from being ours,
But being what it is. What are your thoughts
About our destiny as cosmopolitans ?


Have we the elements of greatness, or
Will we be little people in the book
Of yet unwritten history ?
Philos.
Well, you see,
We have our share of space ; and, tho’ our clime
Is rather fickle for a healthy people,
There are still many worse ; and, to bo plain,
Our Britain’s gloomy year is nothing better.
And, I believe, should either you or I
Eevisit earth three hundred years from now,
The little island’s population would
Be doubled by the large.
Haeold.
And do you think
This will out-do their London ?
Philos.
Ho, my friend, no !
She is a great mistake, and we should sin
Were we to duplicate so large a hive
On our broad shores. I had much rather see
An hundred little towns than one such mass
Of men and masonry. This wholesale way
Of packing human beings does not do ;
We must have elbow room ; I say again,
We must have elbow room.
Haeold.
And so say I.
But in our bouncing business times, you know.
We like a roaring trade.


PmiiOS.
Well, let it roar ;
But let it roar abroad. Why, look you, sir,
Your city stomach holds not half the bulk
The country stomach holds. The city man
Cribs his poor appetite, maybe his back,
To keep up an appearance —which but means
A well-kept fender, a few gilded frames
Hung on his parlour wall, and a snug seat
At every opera or theatre.
Haeoid.
You say much truth.
Philos.
Yes, and I say again, and you’ll believe,
That we will yet be great —aye, very great.
O, heard you what our sweet, far-seeing friend
Has sung about the future of this land P
Haeoid.
You mean the Poet ? No. But there he comes !
Look how he hangs his head, like a big ear
Of yellow wheat. I’ll wager what you like
He’s taking soundings now ! Do you observe
A striking contrast in him to the host
Who drive pell-mell like bees or butterflies
Adown these noisy thoroughfares of life ?
There is a oneness in his very walk.
How would you like to be a poet,
Philos.
Why, not at all; and I can feel for those
Who have the deep poetic in their souls


Like him who comes. Their hearts are not their own ;
And their sensations so distract at times
That with them life is other than a comfort.
"Were I in love with ease, I’d rather he
Ton diamond breaker, by the wayside there,
Than this clear-minded man.
[Miter Poet.
Poet.
Good day, my friends !
Philos.
A better day to you ! "We saw you “ taking sound-
ings
Have you hit on some new, bright idea ?
Poet.
Are bright ideas to bo found in streets ?
As on the gravel pathway there I looked,
A host of thoughts, almost as old as nations,
Stared in my face, and thus they seem’d to speak —
Here trots along the lawyer to his desk,
The merchant to his counter, the port fop,
And the brown artizau, all stained with toil;
Here comes along, so stately and perfumed,
The fashionable lady in her silks,
With golden bracelets on, and diamond rings ;
And the poor washerwoman, with her clothes
In a great basket; next her shoeless boy,
Who sells the morning news ; the baker, with
His necessary bread ; and him w r ho bears
The drink of calves to help to nourish babes.
Here fall the feet of children as they go


And come again from school; and here the teacher
Makes his impression. Here the messenger
From the sick room runs to the doctor’s house ;
And here the doctor walks leisurely along towards
the sick j
The parson here doth pass on to his church ;
And worshippers of somewhat pass and pass
Each other in their bigotisms to
Their selfish meeting-houses ; here the sot
Goes to his favourite inn ; and the gay rake
To the sly harlot’s home. O ! who would be
A pavement with such usage ?
Haeold.
Who would be
A poet with such fancies ? Heaven forbid
That me, or any of mine, should come to this !
If this is what poetic insight means,
Preserve us from the poets ! All have need
To shut an eye at times. It does not do
To gape at the intestines of ourselves
Or of society. Excuse me, sir !
Poet.
Ho, you are right; but when we get to rest
We will forget it all.
Haeold.
But you will never
Be able to console you in your bed.
If you dream now, at such a rate as this,
How will you by-and-bye when sleep begins ?
c


Philos.
There, Harold, stop ! You cannot mend the world
By such poor talking. History hands us down
The names of poets on her earliest page ;
And I have little doubt that those who see
The latest leaf of her great finished hook
Will see the names of poets written there —
The leaveners of society. Till life
Has gasped out its last gasp, it will be theirs
To work their work ; a work which you or I
Might justly envy, but may never ape.
Poet.
Then we have got one friend !
Philos.
Aye, more than one ;
And One than all more to be trusted in!
Though in the commerce-bustle of our times
The busy street may shoulder you aside,
Tour place is near the throne ; and you have cause-
To thank God, and take courage, and go on !
Haeold.
You may say true ; but fashionable folk
Of modern times think other than you think.
Who kneels not down to Pashion, when her voice
Gives even respectability the law ?
Philos.
Respectability, forsooth.'
Who are respectable ?
0 thou misjudging World! I feel a storm


Of indignation swelling in my soul,
When I consider how thou prostitut’st
Thine attribute of Justice! Tor thou sett’st
The polished villain with his painted smiles
In thy chief seat of honor. Those who eat
Up widows’ houses, and for a, pretence
Make heavy-sounding prayers, thou callest thine own.
Thou raisest up the fop ; while in the dust,
"With thy damnation on his head, thou tread’st
The honest swain ! Those who most loud
Cau sound their praise thou biddest us receive
As demi-gods, until they die —perhaps
"With a chill puff of southward-veering wind
Soft falling on their lungs ! Respectability !
O that another Adam would arise,
name things o’er again ! for as it is
The basilisk is called a harmless worm,
And the grim tiger tame ; even tho’ he lies
With bones and blood about him ! I must go.
[Exit Philosopher.
Harold.
Rather abrupt; I like not that discourse ;
It indicates a feeling over keen
Ror its possessor’s comfort.
Poet.
So it does ;
But I can sing, God bless him !
Harold.
I can join;
He is an honest well, fresh to the bottom.
c 2


But, sir, somehow or other, men had rather
Not drink the pure clear stream, for, to their taste
The bitter draught seems sweet. See how they
prize
Those trashy novels, light as thistle-down,
And more pernicious, by your melodies.
And yet you sing ! 0,1 had rather be
A screeching cockatoo with crimson crest
Than a of inspiration full,
To sing and be neglected !
Poet.
And I had rather
Be a poor, lone, grey-feather’d little lark,
"With just enough of wing to poise me up
Beside some cloud to sing my mournful song,
Than any of their fashionable birds
Swinging in city cages, and repeating
Yile jargon meaningless, such as their gaolers
Delight to hear. But, sir, there still are those
Who can appreciate the Muse’s lore !
While yon pale, money-loving thing is casting up
More bloodless figures in a narrow room,
Lost to the outer world, some rosy girl
Is plucking blossoms in her father’s garden
And listening to the birds ; for, you must know,
All do not feed on husks.
Habold.
Thank God, ’tis true ;
But can you actually console you with
Such thoughts as these ?


Poet.
Aye, but more freshly still
There wells a better consolation here.
[Laying his hand, on his heart.
Harold.
Tes, that’s where treasures lie. Would that our
friend
Had half your fortune.
Poet.
Is he ailing, then ?
Harold.
In thought he is ; did you not notice him ?
But no —how could you ? Something has disturb’d
His mind’s foundation. If he does not change
His mode of life, I say, Q-od pity him!
Poet.
Humour will have him married !
Habold.
Humour’s right!
But who knows what will follow ? I shall watch.
[Exit Habold and Poet.


SCENE IV.
THE FARMHOUSE PARLOUR.
Mother and Agnes in dose conversation.
Mother.
So you don’t fancy him, you say, which means
You don’t intend to love him —does it not ?
That’s how I understand you. What do you
See so objectionable, poor girl, in him?
Agnes.
I can’t conceive that such a man as he
Is capable of condescending to
All those endearing little requisites
Which tone and sweeten life. For instance, mother.
Think of the learn’d man with an infant seeking
A parent’s fondling from his awkward arms!
The picture makes me smile.
Mother.
You stupid girl!
If your conceptions are to interfere
Thus with your welfare, angels pity you !
What! are you bent on being a mother, then ?
All women are not mothers, nor all wives ;
Though many are who are not. Take good care
Of your conceptions, girl!


AGNES.
Mother, dear,
Such talk is out of place. What if I said
I could not think of him as a loving father.
Say, was there harm in that ?
Mother.
Aye, “ think,” my girl,
’S a better word. But let me caution you :
What do you know about the requisites
To form a father with ? Old as lam
I could not trust myself so far. My child,
If you can get a man to fondle you,
Your simple self, you need not more expect;
The other will come after. He, I’m sure,
Is all affection.
Acutes.
Yes, he seems so now ;
But will he keep it up ?
Mother.
You stupid girl,
To speak such mad surmises ! Will yourself
Keep love’s essentials up ? Begin at home,
You are more like to prove unlovable
Than he neglectful. 1 would be ashamed
To make such poor excuses. You don’t deserve
The love of such a man. Poor, silly thing !
Agnes.
And so I think and say.


Mother.
But, look you, child:
I am your mother ; and how can you dare
Eefuse to yield me up a mother’s due ?
Agnes.
What is a mother’s due ? A woman’s what ?
Mother.
A woman, eh ! That’s what you call yourself !
Tou are a woman when you get a man,
But not till then ; till then your mother’s will
Must sway your wishes.
Agnes.
Love against my will,,
If so my mother wishes ?
Mother.
Yes, even that.
But such is not required. Tou love the man ;
But your misgiving heart wants breath to say,
“ I love him, mother.” Now, is this not true ?
Agnes.
It is, in part.
Mother.
Then listen to me, Agnes.
Agnes.
But no compulsion !


Motheb.
Listen to me, child —
He loves you : own his love. Don’t let your heart
Be mocked by these sad crotchets ; let it throb
Its proper throbs, and all will then be well.
You’ll never get, my girl, a better chance ;
No, nor so good a chance ; and mark, he loves you.
Agnes.
Yes ; with a kind of love.
Motheb.
The proper kind :
Not of that vulgar sort which throws its arms
Around your neck and waist, and sighs, and sobs ;
But pure, respectable, and honest love,
Which low-born vagrants never could enjoy
Or imitate. Such as it ought to be.
Agnes.
“ Distinct, but distant; clear, but O, how cold ! ”
Motheb.
What are you saying, child ?
Agnes.
Only repeating
A line of Byron’s.
Motheb.
Then please let alone
Your thoughts and Byron’s. Lend your ears to me.
Own that you love him !
Agnes.
When ? To you —or him ?


Mother.
Now ; and to me ! And, by and bye, to him.
Agnes.
If it can please you, then, I love the man,
Have ever loved him, and intend to love,
Even when without the thought that he was born
To call me his ; and still have I misgivings that
There’s little ordination in this matter.
Mother.
Be quiet, child! Myself have heard men say
’T we can ordain ourselves. If man and woman
Husband make and wife : that’s ordination
To all intents. Think you a godly minister
"Who preaches ordination dares to act
Counter to his convictions when he joins
A pair unseemly ? Often, when a girl,
I’ve stood beside the sooty smithy door,
And seen the brawny smith from burning coals
Draw out the iron and steel, which did not seem
Much to surpass you in affinity.
But somehow, my child —are you attending ?
"With his great hammer’s oft-repeated strokes
He beat them to a piece ; with such a weld
You could not tell which iron were, which steel.
So will it be with you. You’re iron, girl,
And not the best, and he the best of steel.
Let nature warm you ; then old Father Time
"Will beat you to a union, so that those
Who wonder to behold you drawing near


Each other’s heat, will wonder more and more
To see so good a join.
Agnes.
There, that will do ;
We’d better leave it now.
Mother.
Tes ; but remember!


SCENE V.
DOCTOR’S CONSULTING ROOM.
Doctor (solus■).
Doctor.
This is the doctor, then, whom men are proud
To be acquaint with, and high ladies when
They speak his name pronounce it with a smack.
“ The learned doctor ” even learned fools
Are wont to call me ; pert professionals
Take off their hats to me and sweetly smile.
So here
“The learned doctor ” sits the livelong day
Quizzing the rotten rubbish ! Madam comes
And does obeisance first, then opens out
Her woes and fancies with a mournful voice,
And a dejected face full-fix’d on mine,
As if in me were vested a control
O’er Death and Life. Young miss comes simpering
next,
And tells her tale —poor, frail, confiding thing !
Her feelings and her failings, out they blab
Without restraint, right to the very bottom
Of her warm heart, with little prompting, too.
Talk about confessionals ! —this closet beats them all.
Then come creation’s lords—from the sad husband


And heavy lover, to the worthless waif
Who spreads corruption like a poisonous fly.
Each with his individual trouble comes,
And some with more than ten, thinking that here
They can obtain relief. And so they do —
The very easing of their burdened breasts
So beneficial to them ; and the nostrums
Which I prescribe are to their hearts the same
As is a finger touch unto the pendulum
Of a stopp’d timepiece. Miserable fools,
How do I pity you ! But priests and pastors
Who keep up correspondence with the skies,
Or think they do ; aye, those who hope they follow
Bight in the footprints of the twelve apostles,
Who wrought such wonder-cures ! —whose very sha-
dows
Were like to clouds of Healing —that such men
Should come and cringe to me and ask for healing,
Does much amaze me ! Spiritual impostors !
I cannot choose but call them : Yet they marvel
Why Doctor So-and-So, who knows so well
The frailty of man and life’s uncertain
Tenure, and the like, still stands aloof
Erom God’s great help and theirs ! !
[A knock.
What —what —a knock again ? Another botch
Comes to consult me ! or some prodigal,
With a self-murder’d constitution, to whom, were I
To speak plain truth, my honest words would be —
Die and be damn’d, you miserable wretch,
There is no hope for such vile things as you


But we must tantalise each other still.
Open the door ! Come in !
[Enter Philosophee.
Be seated, sir;
A pleasant day. What can Ido for you ?
Philos.
Perhaps Grod only knows!
Doctoe.
Perhaps!
I like the looks of you at any rate —
A thinking man ! and one such in my eyes
Is worth a thousand of the worthless spawn
Who pester me for physic and advice —
Whose troubles seldom come above their guts !
But yours is higher up.
[Laying his finger on his temple.
Philos.
Not there, but here.
[Laying his hand on his breast.
Here is my seat of trouble. Can you, sir,
Eepair a heart ?
Doctoe.
Tes, such as yours I can.
I’ve had strange work at times.
Philos.
I know you have ;
That brings me here.
Doctoe.
Just let me feel your pulse.


Philos.
No, no ; keep off your hand. The tide runs true.
Doctor.
"Well, where’s your trouble then, if, as you say,
Tour blood is right ? How am Ito proceed ?
Philos.
Here, look me in the face —-Am I in health,
Or am I not ? You have the evidence.
Doctoe.
AYu ought to be in health; although the tension
Upon your nervous cords is rather tight:
You need no physic !
Philos.
Then, what do I need ?
Doctor.
A rest; if not a rest, a thorough change
Of study or pursuit. And let me see :
Are you a married man ? No ! Have you tried
The Thetis cure ?
Philos.
You mean that I should marry.
Doctor.
No ; that is not required. Confound their marrying !
It’s well enough for priests, and such as they
Of a too tender conscience. You and I
Have studied human nature. What you need
Can be more cheaply had.


Philos.
How dare you thus
Advise a man like me ?
Doctor.
I don’t think it daring
To give you wholesome counsel.
Philos.
Wholesome counsel
Comes from a wholesome heart. I tell you yours
Has an unwholesome smell!
Doctor.
Sir, explain yourself !
Philos.
I have explained myself ; hut if you seek
A fuller explanation, here it is :
You wish my ruin, or you never thus
Would have advised me.
Doctor.
What does ruin mean ?
Whom do you think I am ?
Philos.
A fedary with Hell! there, take it plain,
In honest words. Ho wonder that the blood
Of our young State is poison’d, when such men
As you give such advices !
Doctor.
I could break
Thy head for its plain speaking. Hence ! begone !
Or I will pound thee well. But pay thy fee !


Philos. (Throwing down a sovereign)
There ; take thy Judas hire ! And let me tell thee,
Thou shalt be known for this. The sword of Justice
Shall probe thee to the quick ; and on thee soon
A righteous retribution shall descend.
\_Exit Philosopher.
Doctor (solus)
The man’s no hypocrite ; yet do I feel
A strong desire to pound him. Pie and I
May meet perhaps in some convenient place,
'When he shall learn, at his slim body’s cost,
The price of this plain speaking. This guinea here
[Tossing it up.
Will gag his ill reporting. Like cures like!
The first religious beggar gets a half ;
The second gets another. So the doctor
Will hold his own against all comers up.


SCENE VI.
THE FAEMHOUSE.
Paemee and Ms Wife conferring.
Paemee.
What think you of your daughter’s offer, wife ?
Wife.
What think I, do you say ? We would he fools
Did we not press her to accept it. Why,
Not every day she will get such a chance.
An intellect like his, and such a manner,
Might satisfy a queen ; far less a poor,
Plain, country-girl like Agnes.
pAEALF. it.
You call her plain!
Wife.
I mean in bringing up ; of course in face
She leans a little to her mother’s side.
Paemee.
In form her father’s ; and our Agnes’s form
Outdoes her face.
Wife.
There, there, you’ve got me now !
Paemee.
Well, to speak plain, I do not like the match.
I grant the gentleman is pure in morals,


Wise, and intelligent: and in bringing up
Without a fault—and yet somehow, my wife,
I’d rather have him marry some one else
Than simple Agnes, as you call your child.
Wipe.
Husband, you fabricate ! When did you hear
Me call my daughter simple ? Pie on you !
I ever knew you as a good objector—
And let me tell you, your objecting turn
Delayed our marriage longer than it should
Have been delayed ; and you came very near
Losing your wife. Do you remember that ?
Paemee.
Ho, no ; I don’t remember.
Wife.
Think again ;
Well, leave it till your leisure. I can see
Ho earthly reason for this prudence now.
Paemee.
But I can, though—both earthly one and heavenly.
I tell you plainly, wife, that I had sooner
Our child should mate a simple country swain,
With just enough of school-craft, or the like,
To help him through the plain affairs of life,
Than one so deeply learned.
Wipe.
And is that all
The thanks that learning gets from you, poor man ?
d 2


Just like your kind ! truly the farming class
Have, like their cattle, much thick-headedness.
Did I for this —to catch a country clown —
Send Agnes to the hoarding school for years ?
Have I for this lost many an anxious hour
Instructing her, and watching overtures ?
Had I been told, while yet she sucked these breasts,
A clod-pole’s hand would gain her, do you think
I would have wasted on her bringing up
Such time and trouble ?
Faemee.
Everybody knows
The height of your ambition.
Wife.
And everybody
Your grovelling contentment.
Faemee.
So let it be!
Then hear my reason for objecting now :
Our daughter is a pure, good, honest soul,
"Willing to love, and fond to be beloved,
Full of affection—
Wipe.
Like her father, eh ?
Fabmee.
Like the Psalmist’s vine,
"With its embracing tendrils grasping out
For a kind prop, which he can never be —■


Wife.
0, you malicious man ! thus to misname
The kindest and most courteous of your kind.
Kaemeb.
I grant his nature good, and kind, and true ;
But he has spoiled himself, even beyond
Redemption, for a gentle woman’s mate
By over-learning. Learning was his first,
Keen-courted bride ; and he can never love
Another being as she is beloved.
Think of him as a spouse, and I defy
You to imagine him at eventide
Conversing with a wife ; or in the night
Sitting approving, while she plays or sings ;
Or telling her amusing narratives.
And think of him as father —could you dare
Imagine him attempting to console
A hungry infant, clamoring for its breast?
Or if in better humor, like myself,
Allowing its wee hands to fumble o’er
That learned face of his, which you admire ?
’Tis easier to conceive him with a book
Buried in pensive study, lost to all
That is required to make a fireside bright
Or a wife happy ; but so sensitive
He scarce can bear the falling of a pin,
Or a child’s crying “Mother.” This is why
I think he would not suit our Agnes, wife.
Wife.
Do you intend to thwart the project, then ?


Farmer.
I never have approved, and never shall.
Wife.
Allow me to approve; and on my head,
And on my child’s head, rest the consequence !
Faemee.
Then have your way ! My prayer will evermore
Implore a blessing on you, come what will;
Yet have I fears, which now I must not speak.
Wife.
We all have fears, and those who have the most
Sometimes see largest joy.
Faemee.
Would you could prove
A truthful prophet! I could almost kiss
You for those words !
Wife.
Why don’t you do it, then ?
’Tis quite becoming.
Faemee.
Well, it was so once!
Was that not like a knock ?
[Opens the door, when enter Phieosophee.
Philos.
Good evening to my dearest friends, and may
A blessing fill this house !
Faemee.
And you partake !


Wife.
You have our welcome, sir !
Philos.
You have no need
To mention that; I know my welcome place.
Is your good daughter well ?
Wife.
Most excellent!
Thank you for asking.
Philos. (To Farmer)
I have come to-night
On a strange errand, such as Father Adam
Ne’er had to make.
Faemee.
Do you believe in Adam ?
Wife.
Husband, fie ! Why do you ask such questions ?
Philos.
’Tis proper, madam, quite. Of course Ido !
Faemee.
Then I thank God for that! For in our times
The learned make the early settlers
Of our young earth moonshine nonentities ;
The very devil himself has almost vanish’d
Out of this nether sphere.
Philos.
His name is now
Quite an intrusion, though his work is not.


Ton say rightly, sir : Abram, Isaac, Jacob,
And all tbeir brother-venerables are now
Consider’d men of dreams. But you must know
That I am with the orthodox in faith.
Eaexiee'.
It does me good even to see a person
Who can believe in the devil!
Wife.
You wicked man !
Tou will offend our worthy visitor
With your low talk. Excuse my husband, sir !
Philos.
Tes, if he needed it.
Eaemeb.
I stopp’d your say :
Tou were at Adam.
Philos.
I was going to say
Mine was a curious errand, such as Adam
Never required to make —seeking a wife.
I love your daughter as I have never loved
Another woman ; and as Nature bids,
Or some kind spirit, that I take a mate,
I came to learn if you would trust me, sir—
And you, dear madam —with your daughter’s hand ?
Eaemee.
And I expect you fancy your request
A modest one ? To me it has a sound


Of painful separation. Happy hours
Made happier by her presence ; sombre days
Made brighter by her smiles ; and bitter times
Bridged over her converse, blythe and sweet;
A home in which a good and honest child
Holds up two parents’ hearts ; and then that home—
Ho matter how it sounds—bereft of her !
Philos.
You see the sombre side.
Wife.
Indeed he does !
It is his failing, sir, and ever has been.
He did not talk my father over as
He’d have you talk. There was a time, my spouse,
When you sang amour ballads ; when you thought
My father harsh for giving rather slow,
On an important evening, his consent!
You hymn’d it nicely then ! But now it seems •
Yes, then you said that “ each was made for each
“ The woman for the man ! ” and that “ those sinn’d
“ Who tried to break this ancient law of God ! ”
Pakmee.
Am I not fortunate ? What man like me
Was ever blest with so concise a wife ?
Go on; you do the rest !
Wife.
Yes, and it’s well
That I should do the rest! Your idle talk—
Poor milk and water stuff ! —would make us think
You softer than you are.


Eaemee.
Don’t word it so.
"Wipe.
Excuse me if I hurt your feelings, sir !
And you, my husband—but you know me well!
Eaemeb.
Tes, yes ; your bark is sorer than your bite !
"Wipe.
No slang, my dear; this is unprofitable.
Eaemee.
Even as you wish. Do you the rest, I say.
Wipe.
Have you spoken with our daughter Agnes, sir,
About your wishes ? and has she made known
Her mind to you ?
Philos.
Yes, I have spoken in part
And she in part has made response.
She is your child, she says ; and, as your child,
Must do her best to please you —meaning both.
Eaemee.
An honest girl!
Wife.
Don’t everybody’s girls
Say so or similar ? Well, sir, we have been
Talking the matter over ere you came,
And this has been our ruling—if you gain
Our daughter’s heart, you’re welcome to her hand.


Phiios.
May I consider this the mind of both ?
Paemeb.
Tes, you may.
Wife.
Yes, and with my best wishes.
Philos.
Thant you both ; and thank my G-od as well;
And thank your child : I am a happy man ?


SCENE VII.
THE FARMHOUSE.
Agnes and Piiilosopiiee.
Philos.
My darling miss, and will you make your choice ?
Agues.
Have you spoken with my parents ?
Philos.
Yes; and they
Say all remains with you, my precious one !
Agnes.
Will you he kind to me if I consent
To be your partner ? And by being kind
I mean not in “ my-dearing” or the like,
But in the earnest, deep, unbroken flow
Of your heart’s waters.
Philos.
Yes, my Agnes ; I
Will fresh you, like a fountain, with my love!
And as time steals along in day and night,
Till this poor heart is dry, you will be fed
With its best waters.
Agnes.
Here, then, take my hand 1
There ! You have gain’d my heart! I can confide


Its keeping to your care. My girlish fancy
Sought for a man like you to call my own ;
And here at last I’m West!
Philos.
Then take this kiss ;
Even as a holy sign, and as a token
Of tetter things to come.
Agnes.
So let it be !
Philos.
When shall we fix the wedding ?
Agnes.
Six months hence ?
Philos.
No ; not so far away ! So many days ;
Weeks sound like ages now. But, Jacob-like,
A love as true as mine could bridge o’er time
Broad as a life-time, making it appear
Short as a single day. My Agnes, dear,
You move me as I never have been moved
By man or woman. A new impulse stirs
My being to its bottom. You must be
A very angel!
Agnes.
Do not flatter so !
Angels are scarcer now than once they were,
Though most folk think they see one during life.
Some see many, or fancy that they see them ;
But you, I trust, are not of their fraternity.
I too have hope to be an angel yet;


But as yet you, or any one, can see
That I am but a poor, plain country girl,
Half worth the loving.
Philos.
No ; you under-say
Yourself in saying so ! Ton are not plain,
And poor you cannot be. A country girl,
And Nymph or Naiad has to me one sound.
Agnes.
"Well, have your way again ! It harms me not
To be thus flatter’d now ! The time may come
When, with a backward look from some bare hill
(Life has its ups and downs), I yet may cast
My view to here, as to an oasis ;
And bless it from my heart —this golden time !
Philos.
You do philosophize more stern than me,
And more astray. Why do you think, my dear,
So poorly of the future ? You and I
Are pilgrims joined ; and hand-in-hand we go,
Not out of Eden like fhe sinful pair,
But to the sunrise land, where fields are ever
Eefresh’d with dew ; and in whose azure skies,
Of deepest dye, hang crimson clouds and gold.
AONES.
My fellow pilgrim —here then, take my hand,
And lead me onward to this sunrise land !
Have your kind will again ; in yonder bowers
There must be peace, and many precious flowers.


Philos.
Why are you sceptical ?
Agues.
What makes you think
That I am sceptical P
Philos.
Tour words, my dear !
Agnes.
Do I look sceptical ? I think you read
My looks as Ido yours. Now, do you not ?
0, I can trust your face !
Philos.
As I can yours ;
And so we will not quarrel, Agnes dear.
But I must leave you for a little time ;
And now, my hope imparter, fare you well!
We can afford to kiss. Eemember me !
Agnes.
I will, my heart’s anointed. And I put
My wishes in your words—remember me !

A RURAL COTTAGE.
Mbs. Beowjt and Mbs. Boundet gossipping.
Mbs. Bouitdet.
You were not at church last Sabbath, Mrs. Brown ; I
saw your seat was empty !
Mbs. Beowiy.
O bless you, Mrs. Boundey, my old man was so ill I
couldna venture out. He’s a had such fearful
spasms. I gie him homopathies till I was tired,
both globule and tinker. But la ! it were no
use: the disease were too strong for it.
Mbs. Botodet.
Did you consult the book ?
Mbs. Beown.
Aye, indeed I did ; but from it I got little help. It
said if fids does not do, try that; and if that
does not do, try the other! So Ibe a tried all,
and poor Brown in agonies the whole time in
those fearful spasms. Poor man, he did suffer !
Mbs. Bootdey.
But perhaps you did not give the medicine a fair
chance P


Mbs. Beown.
A fair chance, Mrs. Boundey ! It were a put into
Brown’s stomach, an’ what could he a fairer
chance than that ? An’, mind ye, I ha’ done
some wonderful curing wi’ homopathies in my
time. I understands the nature of the things.
I healed Watkins’ baby with it, too, after the
doctor had a gi’en en up ! But it be ano use for
the spasms. Poor Brown did suffer ! It ud a
tighten up, an’ then he’d a lay un down on Tin’s
back, and a holler like a baby wanting a some
thing to drink. Poor Brown, he did suffer !
Mbs. Boundey.
So you got nothing to relieve him, then ?
Mbs. Beown.
La ! bless ye, Mrs. Boundey ! do you think as 1
could see my ould man in pain and not try tc
get a some’at to relieve un ? I cured un with £
half a spoonful of cayenne pepper and some
essing o’ peppermint in hot water. You needn’i
a mention it, Mrs. Boundey. But we didn’t gel
to church, tho’!
Mbs. Boundey.
Well, you missed a very fine discourse.
Mbs. Bbown.
Both Brown and me’s a getting tired o’ hearing fine
sermons. They’re a getting too fine for plain
folk like we, Mrs Boundey ! O this ritulerising 1
It will be the ruin o’ our church, I fear, late 01
E


soon! O, Mrs. Boundey, our churches are all
turning into operal houses and theatres!
Mes. Boundey.
My good woman, if you had only been out to hear
the sermon we had last Sunday you would not
speak in that way. The minister was preaching
against such places, and blaming people for
spending so much of their time and money in
them.
Mes. Brown - .
An’ hadn’t un on un’s gown and surplice! An’ didn’t
un gersticulate ? An’ baint there a some phar-
nalia lying about the altar ? La ! Mrs. Boundey,
it’ll take a lot o’ tha things, believe me, to cure
a heavy heart, or even the spasms ! Poor Brown
did suffer ! Be the new married uns there ?
Mes. Botodet.
Yes, Agnes and her husband were there; and very
modestly dressed they both were, too. You were
at the wedding, I believe P
Mes. Beown.
Aye, an’ that I were. La! Mrs. Boundey, it were a
grand wedding ! Dunno after all as they be any
happier nor me and my old man were when we
went together. Miss Agnes had a white velvet
dress on, and it were so becoming. And her had
her hair so nicely curled ; and her hat were so
beautifully trimmed. Everything was so be-
coming, Mrs. Boundey!


Mes. Botjbdet.
So I believe. She has been fortunate in a husband,
I am given to understand ?
Mes. Beown.
Everybody to their liking, Mrs. Boundey ! But,
between you and me, I think Agnes could ha’
a done better. The learnin’ o’ un spoils un. He
be a strange man, Mrs. Boundey ; he ha’ a
strange idears in un, they say.
Mes. Botthdet.
Indeed ! I never heard that said of him before: what
are his ideas ?
Mbs. Beowit.
0, dear knows, Mrs. Boundey ! He believes we be a
come fro’ monkeys, or such like things, an’ not
fro’ Adam and Eve at all. 0, dear knows, it’s
a wicked world this !
Mbs. Boundet.
But are you sure he is a man of that sort ?
Mes. Beowx.
0, yes ! They say un is very lamed ; and all lamed
people ha’ tha strange opinions in ’em now—
they can’t be lamed without ’em !
Mes. Boxjitdet.
Not all, I hope, Mrs. Brown. If he is a man of
that description he will scarcely suit Agnes.
e 2


Mbs. Beown.
ono ! he’ll not suit Agnes ! Agnes be a good soul.
Her sings like an angel: 0, it were delightful to
hear her a singing the night o’ her wedding !
Poor girl! I know her was not so happy as her
should ha’ been. Sometimes she looked quite
melancholy ; I could see it in her face.
Mes. Botjndbt.
What had she to be melancholy about, I should like
to know.
Mbs. Beown.
It was her mother as had the doing o’ it all. A good,
modest girl is Agnes. Her never cared much for
yon thing. There’s no substance in un. He be
like a lamp post. If that be what larnin does
for honest folk, preserve Brown and me fro’
larnin! I wouldn’t a change Brown for un
to-day, old an’ all as he be !
Mes. Boundet.
It is no use thinking too hardly about him ; he may
make a good husband to Agnes yet.
Mes. Beown.
Never, Mrs. Boundey, never! There isn’t enough
material in un to make a good husband with to
any un. He moight ha’ made a parson ; but la
bless ye ! even them’s a better o’ having a good
body on ’em. I’m for none o’ your spindle-
shanks parsons neither ! I loiks to see a man as


can set to his han’, if need he, out o’ the pulpit
as well as in it, Mrs. Boundej.
Mes. Boeitdet.
I understand—Agnes’s husband is not a man accord-
ing to your taste. never mind, Mrs. Brown, I
have heard it said by those who ought to know
him, that he is a thorough gentleman. He has a
little property, too ; and as he will not require
to work hard for his daily bread, like some of the
rest of our husbands, his body, that you take so
much objection to, may be strong enough. He
is said to be a very sensible man, and likely to
prove an ornament to our literature.
Mbs. Beown:
I hopes he may, Mrs. Boundey. P’r’aps I don’t know
nothing about un. Agnes be a fine girl! Her
will never be troubled with the washing o’
babies’ clothes, you mark my word, Mrs.
Boundey! Her will never be troubled with
crying babies, neither!
Mbs. Bootdet.
Ah, well! perhaps she will be happy enough without
them.
Mbs. Beow.v.
never be happy without babies, Mrs, Boundey ! Her
will never be happy without babies !


SCENE IX.
NORTH TERRACE.
Haeold and Philosophbe meeting.
Haeold.
How does the married man ?
Philos.
Thank you, he’s well!
Haeold.
Ton look more yourself, at any rate.
How does your wife ?
Philos.
Eight famously, old friend!
Her voice keeps merrily ringing in my ears
Prom morn till night.
Haeold.
Long may it ring !
Even till the voices of little choristers
Arise to help at the domestic anthems.
I’m glad to hear you’ve found so sweet a songster.
Philos.
Eather say so good a woman ; for comparisons
Should up, not down.
Haeold.
I see ; you’re ladies’ man!
Now shall you stand your dumps, I trow you shall!


Philos.
You are no enemy ; I need not fear !
Haeold.
Pear or no fear, you’re in a corner now ;
There’s no escaping ! Stand upon your guard !
Philos.
Bless the gentle ones ! He who would not stand
A battery’s volley frankly in defence
Of their dear kind would be unworthy of
A soldier’s death, or a mule’s burial.
Haeold.
Yes, get your courage up—you need it all!
Women were women once ! But in our time
The man who’d rashly venture to defend
Those millinery things from honest censure
Loves not himself. Women were women once,
But now they are —what ? —what ? —why, Pashion’s
peacocks,
With unnatural heads, and portentous tails !
Aye, once upon a day (how sounds my rhyme ?)
The man who took a wife took a sound body,
Sensibly clad, with clothing of her own
Or of her mother’s making. Her own hair
Adorn’d her head, not tortur’d up in pleats,
Or frizz’d like horses’ tails, but hanging down
In graceful locks or still more graceful curls.
Ho need was then of golden rings or brooches,
Or hoops of steel to give her person shape.
Ood made the woman then. But now, sir ! —now


The draper makes her, and the milliner,
The dentist, and the druggist. Sea and earth,
From Greenland to Hew Zealand, have been laid
Tinder forced contribution to supply
The necessary material to create
This lump of patchwork. And the man who takes-
Home “ sweet Pandora ” has his chamber walls
Draped round with dresses and gay petticoats,
His table loaded with pomatum jars
And vials of perfume, and other prequisites
That I forbear to name, which give the place
The smell and the appearance of a chemist’s
Laboratory. The floor is lumber’d too
"With trunks and bonnet-boxes, so that he
Has scarcely room to stir about or breathe.
This takes our courage down !
Philos.
Speak for yourself!
You seem on beaten ground. Go on—go on —•
All this is new to me !
Haeold.
New to a married man P
Wives are so much alike—when you draw one
You see the rest.
Philos.
Aye, it is well for those
Who get themselves into a corner thus
To say so. Why, it is their only solace,
And it is half a pity to take it from them.


Haeold.
Don’t laugh too soon. Ton have your morning eyes •
You will see by-and-bye, and see as others
Hare seen before you.
Philos.
Thank you for the joy
You give in prospect.
Haeold.
I am pleased to learn
You’re happy in your marriage. May your life
Go onward like a river, without break
Or cataract, until it gains the broad
Expanse of open ocean !
Philos.
Thank you, friend!
Haeold.
But tell me, do you feel your marriage has
Done you much service by imposing what
"VYe call a tax on your o’er-studiousness ?
There’s where I thought you weak. But if your
marriage
Has levied this with rigour, you have gained
A fund of might towards self-government.
Philos.
I think this has been gained. But, my dear sir,
I’d sooner think of leaving off to live
Than leaving off to gather what makes life
A blessing, a great blessing, and a high
And holy avocation.


Haeold.
So would I.
But mark me, my good friend, here lay the difference
Between yourself and me. My love of knowledge
"Was a moderate love ; yours was a passion.
It was a despot—yes, a cruel despot —
Which press’d your every subject faculty
Into his service. Tou could not eat a meal
With any comfort; aye, you could not sleep
A proper sleep —sleep was not rest to you:
In very fact you seem’d to have broken
The harmony of nature, that’s as far
As did concern yourself. And even when
Tou met a friend, you met him hut in part;
One part was there, the other somewhere else —
Perhaps in Greorgium Sidus, or away
Back in the dark abyss, ten thousand years
Before the corner-stone of earth was laid !
You were not always so ; and from my heart
I pray that so at least you are not now.
Philos.
Harold, your head is full of idle fancies !
Tou should have been a poet! Pity that
So fine a talent thus has run to waste !
Haeold.
Ho, no ;I do not jest! My words are true
To my convictions as the hounding echo
Is to the living voice.
Philos.
You too have changed ;
Your knowledge, like a poor neglected lover,


Is leaving you. Once when we used to meet
We had sweet converse of philosophy,
Which lifted this dull heart above its cares ;
But now, Cassandra-like, you have abandoned
Tour proper speech to go about proclaiming
Mistaken prophecies and dire forebodings,
Which make me sick to hear. You love me not,
Or value not my friendship !
Habold.
Say the sun
Loves not the earth, the earth loves not the sun,
Bather than say I love not you :
This world has nothing sweeter, never had,
Than is your friendship to my inmost soul.
Philos.
Then why your alter’d look, your alter’d voice,
Your altered manner, altered everything ?
Harold.
Because my love, like a true, anxious wife,
Was watching you with fear !
Philos.
Then fear no more !
Your spouse has given up drinking to excess.
Harold.
Give me your hand again ! Now am I glad !
[A Stranger approaches.
Stranger.
Sirs ! have you heard the news ?


Phiios.
What news d’ye mean ?
Stranger.
A\ r hy, that spirits are rising from the dead again
To do strange deeds ! The stubbornest materialist
Must be converted now !
Philos.
Confound the tricksters I
Would I had my will, I’d give you news ;
They would not long deceive the nations thus !
1
Stranger.
Sir, there is no deception. With these ears
I heard their voice mysterious, not unlike
The gibber of a strong electric tongue
Which speaks plain truth. There’s no deception, sir I
Philos.
What say these spirits that we do not know ?
Stranger.
Why, not so much, I grant; but they confirm
That which we do, which is important, sir.
Philos.
Important with a vengeance ! Go thy way ;
Disturb thy mind no more with such delusions !
I have better opinion of the spirits
Than think they ever would disgrace themselves
By giving out such paltry revelations,
In paltry balderdash, to cozen living wights.
Go read the Bible, sir, and be at rest;


It is not safe for weighty bulks like we
To walk on clouds, or sooty chimney-tops ;
Keep you your footing firm. Let spiritists
Go to the devil if they like ! keep you to truth :
These raps are nought. Spirits, believe me, speak
A tongue more dignified. Come, march away !
[Exit Stranger.
One of the crazed ones, eh ? How passing strange
That men mature in years, if not in head,
Can credit such vile nonsense ?
Harold.
Yet there is
A semblance of truth in the disclosures
Which to these spirits are accredited.
One recently has told a pretty tale
About our Saviour’s wanderings in the world,
And
Philos.
Harold, have done ! lam impatient with
The whole affair : it is delusion all,
And waste of time to speculate about it.
I am no spiritist, neither are you ;
Go home and love your wife —I will to mine,
And tell her of your lecture.
Harold.
Leave that out,
It is not worth reporting !
Philos.
As you like !
Think better thoughts of women. Pare you well!
[Exit.


SCENE X.
A ROOM IN THE PHILOSOPHER’S DWELLING.
Agnes and Philosopher seated at a small table,
on which are some boohs.
Agnes.
My husband, are you well ? You look so pale,
I fear you are not well! What ails you, dear ?
Philos.
Do I look pale ? Sweet Agnes, have you seen
This wondrous book ?
[Taking up a hook.
Agnes.
What wondrous book, my dear ?
Philos.
This wondrous book, in which the learned writer
Has sounded the deep floods of spacious time
AYith much success.
Agnes.
Does he believe in the Bible ?
Philos.
You do so resemble your good father !
Well, my dear, he speaks not of the Bible in his
book—-
Why ask you such a question ?


Agnes.
Why, because
I£ he believed in the Bible, I would say
G-od must have blest us with another light
In our own solar system ; but i£ not,
We should be careful in our credence, lest
A comet has appear’d, to trail along
And stupify star-gazers.
Philos.
This man says
The earth is older by some thousand years —
Or is it millions P—than we have been taught
To look on her as being. He has cast
His fathom-line down in the dread abyss
Par past the fathers’ limit
Agnes.
O, my dear!
I wish you would not read such naughty books !
Philos.
Why do you think them naughty P
Agnes.
Just because
They lead poor minds astray, at least such minds
As simple people have.
Philos.
No, no, my wife !
Rather, Prometheus-like, say that ’tis theirs
To bring us down fresh light—the fire of heaven


Agues.
Ah, well, perhaps they do ! For after all
The Bible says that knowledge must increase.
Philos.
It is increasing fast, and men now see
Much farther than they could in former times —
In ages dim and dark. We must not think
Our knowledge perfect. “ What! six thousand years,”
Asks this learn’d writer in astonishment,
“ Since man was made and set upon this globe ?
“ ’Tis all mistake —a miserable mistake !”
And from the honest lips of Nature’s self,
And from the great pulsations of her heart,
And from her footprints, and her mighty deeds,
He has come to the truth, the very truth,
Of her nativity.
Agues.
Does he determine
The year for certain ?
Philos.
No, he does not quite
Attempt to go so close : he only says —
“ Two thousand decades of revolving years
“ Have come and gone since man had footing here ;
“ And ampler calculations must be made
“ By tens of thousands—aye, perhaps by millions —
“ Of years, or periods equal unto years,
“ Since this great quashy earth began to roll
“ Round yonder sun.”


Agnes.
0, what a wondrous man !
Philos.
He is a wondrous man ; and this same book
Is a most wondrous book.
Agnes.
But don’t you think
Men know too much in our days ? Tho’, like boys,
They’re learning and forgetting, what they forget
Is perhaps as useful too as what they learn.
I’ve heard my father say, “ The great themselves
“ Have gone astray and wander fearfully.”
Philos.
Aye, but, Ulysses-like, great even in wandering ;
Like him I trust they yet may reach their home—•
Their island home.
Agnes.
Where is this island home ?
Is it the island which the Greeks once called
The Happy Island ?—Happy Islands rather ;
Por different ways these venturous pilots steer —
What are they seeking P
Philos.
What Ulysses sought—
A wife and son. To put it still more plain,
This world and next.
Agnes.
My father’s found these long.
And by a shorter route than they pursue.
F


He entertains no doubts, but calmly sits
And steers Ms vessel by Faith’s Polar star,
No matter how the weather, and you know
Him as a happy man.
Philos.
I do, indeed.
Would there were more like him!
Agnes.
O, did but men
Consult the same good chart which he consults,
With the same judgment, many might there be
Even as he is ! Here lies the difference, dear :
He knows his course, while some have doubts of theirs,
Philos.
Tou are a good logician.
Agnes.
No, my dear;
I’m but a poor, weak woman, needing help.
Philos.
Can I not give it you ?
Agnes.
Perhaps you can.
You have been helping me for many days—
A sorry laggard ; and I greatly fear
I have o’ertax’d your strength, and made you need
Some help yourself. Now tell me, am I right ?
Philos,
You’re over-anxious, Agnes. lam well,
And strong as other men. The MU is steep,


And stoutest hearts must pant. Be of good cheer,
WeTl gain the top ere long, and then a rest.
Bring courage with a song.
Agnes.
I cannot sing ;
My heart is full!
Philos.
The very time to sing
An empty heart can give but emptiness,
And emptiness may give what some call sound,
But never, never song ! Come, ease your heart !
Agnes.
At your request I will.
[Sings.
Jesus, Master, when the billow
Roared above Thee Thou could’st lie
Calmly sleeping on a pillow,
While with fears distracting cry
Others woke Thee, shouting “Save us!”
“ Save us from the sea and sky ! ”
Like a tranquil morning breaking,
When a stormy night has fled,
Beamed Thy features when awaking,
As in gentle voice you said—
“ Peace ! be still, thou wind and water!
“Why were ye so much afraid?”
Lord, upon Life’s raging billow
We are roll’d about in dread ;
From our temporary pillow
Peace and soothing sleep have fled.
Come and save us ! come and save us !
Save us in this hour of dread 1
r 2


Jesus, Master ! Jesus, Master !
Breathe into our hearts the balm :
Save us now from all disaster—
Let there come a gentle calm ;
Lay upon our fever’d foreheads
Thine own blessing-dealing palm !
Philos.
Agnes, your song sounds sad ! I hope it is,
Like other songs, not quite the true expression
Of your own feelings. Tell me, is your heart
Troubled with anxious thoughts ?
Agnes.
At times it is.
Philos.
Then don’t be troubled, dear ; or please remember
That troubles comes to us like gusts of wind
Come to the forest denizens —to make our roots
Strike deeper in the ground ; else would we grow
Too leafy and too tall, and too exposed
To the tornado tests which often try.
Think of the gardener and his pruning-knife :
The limb likes not the feel, but yet methinks
The fruit tastes sweeter for it, and for it
The tree has better health ; and so with us,
And what appear reversals of our hopes.
The overgrowth is check’d, the wrong growth cut
Even in appearance we are gainers by
These gentle thwartings. Vegetation
Is kept in bounds by frost—the very flowers
Are fairer for it.


Agnes.
Yes, all this is true ;
But I’m not frosted, nor severely troubled ;
It is not overgrowth, but want of growth
Which doth distress me. lam like a tree
Hid from the sun ; or like a voyager
Detained by adverse winds right in the centre
Of Life’s great ocean.
Philos.
Have you got so far ?
Talk not of want of progress, if you’re there !
How have you found your captain ?
Agnes.
Kind, most kind!
A dear, good captain!
Philos.
Why not trust him, then ?
He has learned navigation ; and tho’ now
A fog may hide the sun, to-night perhaps
We will behold the stars, and then we’ll plough
Those billows with assurance, which at present
Bid us reef-in and tack.
Agnes.
Thank you, my spouse !
That is true comfort; that has done me good.


SCENE XI.
THE PHILOSOPHER’S STUDY.
Philosopher (alone) coming into his study and looking
around.
My friends ! my valued friends ! "but yet not all
\_A pause, during which he seats himself.
Here with the minds of men I hold sweet converse ;
Soul speaks to soul: for even on earth begins
Immortal life. Here are exemplified
The good man’s words, “Though dead, yet speaking”—
Dead ! yes, in body dead, and gone to judgment.
Here is a motley host; and also here
Must the dread line bo drawn, which to surpass
Ho class dare venture. Spirits ! spirits ! spirits !
I do not love you all, but from you all
I have assistance had. O, how much better
To pass the hours with you, than mingle with
The noisy world without! Tour aims were high ;
Por, when in body here you walked your rounds,
Tour eyes were on the stars ; and from the stars
Te brought a majesty, a might, a silence,
Which help’d to make ye great, even as ye are.
Tour disembodied spirits, unconfined,
May roam I know not where. But if you walk


Thro’ the great sty above, as here your words
"Walt with the sons of men, what mournful thoughts
Must ye have of this Life —to buy and sell,
To eat and sleep, to marry and repent,
To bolster wants, and mate deformities
Appear lite blessings, to lay plans to-day
And to abandon them to-morrow —
Such are the doings of the multitudes,
Or high or low ; tastes may a little differ,
But habits are the same. 0 Holy Saviour !
And didst Thou die for such ? Tours was a love
Par passing tnowledge ! To die for fools,
Por miserable fools ; abandoned all
By every good desire or noble thought,
And loving all things low, and thoughts ignoble—
To bring Salvation down to men and women
Who sought not for it, cared not for it —
Yea, despised it —was love indeed! Aye, more ■
[A pause.
How for a silent converse with a friend.
[Taking down a hook.
Open, most precious book, your sybil leaves !
[Reads in silence. .EWer Agnes.
Agnes.
Excuse me for disturbing you, my dear,
A gentleman has called —here is his card.
[Giving a card.
Philos.
Bid him come in—awed by these silent faces,
His speech cannot be vain.
[Exit Agnes ; enter Cleegtman.


Clehgtilust.
G-ood evening, sir.
I hope I’m not intruding.
Philos.
Take a seat.
You, sir, are welcome.
Clergy.
Thank you. I have called
Half from a sense of duty, half desire
To have some words with you.
Philos.
I take it kindly,
I can assure you ; and must thank you for
Tour courtesy. We have few visitors,
And few from sense of duty e’er come here.
Clergy.
Sir, rumour floats about concerning you
Which care I not to hear. Men say you wander
Prom the long-trodden path on which our fathers
Went safely through this life, and that you doubt
The soul’s undying nature, and the body’s
Ability to rise ; or, to be brief,
You’ve turned materialist.
Philos.
So I have.
Men are too spiritual in our poor times :
Yet would I rather trust to yon pale moon
Por light and heat than trust my all to matter.
Why, look you there ! You see those phials, sir ?
The essences they hold, which chemistry,


One branch of knowledge, has distill’d thus,
Could soon reduce a rocky bottom to
The elements which made it.
Clergy.
"Wisely said!
Then rumour does you wrong.
Philos.
It does, in part.
I take objection, both by word and deed,
To much that many trust, because there is
Nothing substantial in it.
Clergy.
Nothing substantial!
Nothing substantial! Will you please explain ;
I cannot see your point.
Philos.
Well, sir, look here :
What some call their religion differs much
Prom Nature’s mode and mine. They think because
They flock to a great building once a week,
Sing a few what-d’ye-call-them’s ? and mumble over
A prayer or two, and listen to the sermon,
And sigh and say “ Amen,” and drop a shilling
Into the offertory, all is well
Between their souls and G-od ; while my religion
Bids me be humble; and presume not thus
To mock my Maker with poor, empty prattle.
Clergy.
But do you worship ?


Philos.
He can answer that
Who knows my inmost soul ; it gravitates
To Him alone.
Cleegt.
Tes, yes ; but individual gravitation
Must with the universal correspond—
Soul balance soul, as orb doth balance orb ;
Each gravitate to each, which doth produce
The harmony of motion. All save comets
Obey this law ; even the erratic comets
Break not the order. And you too have heard
About Bedemption !
Philos.
Yes, I have been redeem’d
By Jesus Christ, my Lord.
Cleegt.
But how redeem’d P
Philos.
Kot with poor empty talk or foolish customs,
But by His precious blood. What bids you question
My soul’s salvation P
Cleegt.
The love I bear for you.
I plainly tell you, as my Master told
One like yourself, “ Thou truly art not far
Prom Heaven’s Kingdom,” but yet not there.
I must be faithful with you : while you thus
Live, as it wore, within yourself, my friend,


You cannot be at peace. You must consort
With those who follow Jesus if you wish
To be a follower. ’Twas not thus, alone,
His first disciples follow’d Him on earth.
Think of poor Simon Peter ! Trust me, sir,
Self isolation will not work your good.
Philos.
Yet better isolate me thus than herd with those
Who know not what they worship. ’Tis enough
To turn a wise man mad, to watch the motions
Of those that think them pious. Yes, I grant
I lose in creature comfort, but my loss
Is bearable at least. You’d have me join
In crying, “ Peace ! peace !” when there is no peace.
CIEKGT.
Ho, not at all. I grant you there are many
Amongst our congregations whose behaviour
Accords not with their calling ; but to judge
The whole by these were both unjust and cruel.
And then, my friend, think of our Saviour’s words,
“ They that be whole need not the doctor’s care.”
Were you to come amongst our sickly flocks
You might improve them.
Philos.
A r es, yes, I might!
But I’ll not try it on.
Clehgt.
I tell you, sir,
You wrong yourself —indeed, my friend, you do ;


And you will suffer ; and God grant that you
May be the only sufferer. Those who set
A lightsome value —nay, who set at nought
Such high and holy institutions which the God
Of all the earth hath sanctioned—ever yet
Have borne their punishment.

Then I’ll hear mine ;
Aye, and with patience. You can leave me now.
Clebgx.
I have discharged my duty ; if my words
Avail not, you may suffer. Pare you well!

SCENE XII.
THE FARMHOUSE.
Paemee entering , met hy his Wife.
Wife.
0, husband, dearest husband, have you heard
The news —the dreadful news ?
Paemee.
No ! What’s the matter ?
Wife.
Our son, our darling son, is so unwell!
Paemee.
But such is human life ! both frail and fickle
To-day in health, to-morrow frosty sickness
Arrests its pulses. This so wondrous body,
With its fine, wondrous senses, mounts and sinks
As wondrously with each degree of change
As mercury itself.
Wife.
But his body
Is still in health ; it is his noble mind
Which suffers now !
Paemee.
His mind, dear wife; his mind !


Wife.
Our Agnes came along this afternoon
In great excitement. Yesterday, she said,
They had a visit from the clergyman.
Her husband seemed not well the day before ;
But when the reverend gentleman had gone,
He took a serious turn, and, by his speech,
Showed great derangement. Broken sentences,
In hurried tone, he would ejaculate ;
Such as —“ Good sir, the horse shies not at nothing,
“ But, like to Baalam’s ass, he somewhat sees
“ Which his blind master sees not!” Then he’d say —
“ O could the watchdog speak, he’d tell queer tales,
“ ’Twould bristle up the hair, and make the eyes
“ Twinkle like planets !” A few moments after
He’d be discoursing on the human body—
“ Could we but regulate our food and drink,
“We might control our dreams. When spring-time
comes
“ And clothes with blossoms all the orchard trees,
“ Then comes to man a renovation too ;
“ Old sores begin to heal, for, as the sap
“ Revives the tree, so doth the rising blood
“ Restore the man. Life ! what is Life ? you ask :
“ The kindlings of a small electric spark,
“ Which drops into the undeveloped germ
“ And wakes it by the touch ! ITom some vast sun,
“ Through the wide universe the mystic beams
“ In particles diffuse, small, and more small!”
Then, darting from the subject with a bound,
He’d talk about religion fearfully.


His poor capacious mind must have been shaken
Through his conversing with the clergyman.
Faemee.
I quite expected this ; but not so soon !
“Wife.
Husband, you did not! ’Twas that cruel minister
With his hard words that shook his gentle nature.
God judge between them !
Faemee.
Yes, and so he will;
And bless His minister for doing right.
Wife.
A minister of darkness he must be !
’Tis just to judge the workman by his work !
Faemee.
You wrong the holy man.
Wife.
The holy man!
The holy man ! The holy men of old
Drove devils out of people ; but our scares
Drive people into devils, as you see.
Faemee.
Wife, you rave ! You’re walking on the air!
Your information will not sustain your words.
I know our son; I know the clergyman.
My knowledge of the former bade me look
For some disturbance in his fickle world
Of intellect; my knowledge of the latter
Credits him with as honest a desire


For mortal weal as e’er was held by any.
His manner, too, is mild ; yet would he sooner
Withhold him from his food than have withheld
One fraction of the necessary truth
From any needy sinner.
Wife.
Needy sinner!
Who is a needy sinner ? Where was ever
A kinder, a more gentle man than he
Whom you call needy sinner ?
Faemee.
All, wife, all
Are prone to sin ; and every sinning soul
Must be a needy sinner ; and howe’er
It doth receive a necessary truth
Bests with itself, not the evangelist.
Wife.
He might have spoke more kindly.
Faemee.
He must have spokeu
Not only kindly, but compassionately ;
Yet in our times the necessary truth
Should wear a flinty face. I tell you, wife,
The fault is all his own! Without religion
A man’s like thistle-down —each wind that blows
Must wanton with it. His extensive knowledge,
And his too-avaricious thirst for more,
Has brought him where he is. None but himself
Has wrought him this distraction.


Wife.
Yet a man
More gentle, loving, honest at the heart
Ne’er breathed the blessed air ! I must go down
And help my daughter in her time of trouble;
She needs much comfort.
Farmer.
Yes, indeed she does !
[Wife goes out. A knocking at the door,
ivhen enter angry Neighbour.
Neighbour.
I want to know, sir, what you’re going to do
With that confounded bull ? He’s been and broke
My fence in many places ; and last night
Some beasts of mine, and a whole host of yours,
Went right into my crop, and ate and trampled
More than an acre ; so it’s nought but just
That you should pay the damages at least.
Farmer.
What are the damages ?
Neigh.
Four pounds, in all.
Farmer.
No, surely not! Perhaps it will be better
To hare them valued properly before
We speak of money.
Neigh.
As it suits you, sir;
But I’ll take nothing less, I can assure you!
g


I’ll take the matter to a court o£ justice
Before I lose my claim.
Paemee.
It is not yours
Before it’s certified.
Neigh.
"What’s that you say ?
Paemee.
It is not yours until it’s certified !
Neigh.
Call me a liar, sir, or what you like!
I’ll send you down a summons !
Paemee.
Don’t get warm!
Ido not mean to wrong you ! You and I
Have lived in quiet here for many years ;
Why should we quarrel now ? You shall he paid
Whatever damage may he just and right,
But nothing more or less. You’d better leave
And think the matter over ; other cares,
And more important, press on my attention.
Neigh.
I’ll get it valued then!
Paemee.
Yes, get it valued !
[Exit Neig-hboue ; enter Wife.
Wife.
What was the fellow wanting P


Farmer.
Damages 1
It’s money, money ; money for his beer
And his tobacco !
Wife.
Have you hade the lad
Get our conveyance ready ?
Farmer.
Ho, not yet;
I’ll go and do’t myself.
| Exit.


SCENE XIII.
THE BUSH.
A Siiepheeh and Ins dog under a tree; sheep in the
distance. Philosopher advancing.
Philos.
Good morning, sir! Know you wliere leads this
track ?
Shepheed
Even where you like ; as the old saying goes,
You e’en may make it lead to Jericho !
Philos.
I do not comprehend you.
Shep.
Well, you see,
The track just here is like a gum-tree’s butt—
Go up, you come to branches ; the main branch
Will take you to the Murray, if you choose.
Philos.
How distant is the river ?
Shep.
Well, if you follow
The windings of the track, some twenty miles ;
Pive less would reach it by you going straight.
Are you bound there ?


Philos.
Yours is a Pappy life !
Shep.
You say so, sir ! but did you know what I
Philos.
And wisely, too, I think, for you have heard
A neutral judge is best; and thus I judge
The business stands with you;—You rise betimes,
When the fair East is blushing like a bride
Before the altar —when the cockatoos
And laughing-jacks and magpies make the place
Eesouud with life. And with you rises up
Your rosy partner, happy as a queen
Just crown’d and young !
Shep.
Wrong ! wrong! all very wrong !
Philos.
The morning meal is soon prepared and ate ;
Your noonday one prepared ; and, with a swoet
“ God bless you !” from Maria’s honest lips,
You sally forth, attended by your dog,
And march your worthy host, two thousand strong
Shep.
No ! only fifteen hundred in my flock !
Philos.
Like some great general, to a broad campaign,
Well-watered and well-grassed. There, while they
roam,


Cropping the flowers or herbs as suits them best,
You sit you down beside a shady gum
Siiep.
By Jove, you talk ! Are you a parson, sir ?
Philos.
On a green rise, near to a pleasant creek,
To think your thoughts ; or read, in peace o£ mind.
Something immortal; or maybe yourself
Something immortal write, till the mild hours draw
Down the sun, and make you think of home,
"Where the bright face of dear Maria waits
To welcome your return, and bid you feel
The blessedness of calm connubial love !
Siiep.
I might have had a wife ( lir/hts Ms pipe), but some-
thing came
Between us, so we parted ! Never mind,
Dick is not quite unhappy ! once a year
He gets his jolly spree ! In the meantime,
Old Joe the hutkeeper’s a merry dog !
Philos.
Your pasturage is large.
Siiep.
Yes, large and poor.
Philos.
The grass seems plentiful.
Shep.
But then you see
The buttercups and daisies very soon


Will put in an appearance ; then good-bye :
The hot winds come along, and there’s an end !
The season’s rather late.
Philos.
But generous showers
Would do good service to it even yet!
Shep,
Aye, aye ; they would. But, sir, you know the moon
Is near the full; and, having come in dry,
She will go out the same ! But, bless my soul!
I’m not complaining, sir. My sheep, you see,
Look quite respectable. (To his dog). Here! round
them up!
Philos.
You said that I ere night might reach the river ?
Shep.
Bless you, with ease.
Philos.
Then, let me thank you for
This rest and information ; so, good-day !
[Exit Philosopher.
Shep. (solus)
There’s something in that man; though who the
deuce he is, is more than I can tell. It is evident
the fellow has had a good bringing up. Were it
not for a little unsteadiness in his manner, I’d
take him, to be some bishop or other off to con-
vert the darkies ; and, by the way, he’ll have his


own ado if lie is. They have uncommon skulls,
so they have ! He was altogether out with my
domestic affairs, at any rate. If he reaches Porridee
to-night I’ll hear of him again ; Charley’s a rare
one at quizzing the likes of him. If he does not
reach Porridee, I hope he may reach heaven;
though, like many more of us, I am afraid he is
not quite prepared for such a place.


SCENE XIV.
A ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE HILLS.
Peter and Harold meeting.
Peter.
0 ! mercy on us all! there's no man safe !
Harold.
Why,what suggests your song ? I know the tune!
Peter.
A wise man's turning mad ! Have you then heard
The doleful story of your friend’s distraction ?
Harold.
1 saw him yesterday ; he was not then
Much out of reason ; hut I plainly saw
The balance dipping to the leaden side.
Like the substantial gum, he has begun
To fail atop, while yet the roots of life
Are solid in the ground !
Peter.
Is there no hope
In our religion for such men as he ?
Harold.
Where Paith has lost his footing, there can be
No base for Hope. Prieud Peter, it was writ


Ere you and I were born, that as a man
Implanteth shall he reap. Still stand the linos.
Men had a notion once —a wholesome notion —
That this great world rose, like a shoreless island,
Out o£ Immensity, and those who went
Beyond the limit fixed for man’s abode
Lost footing and went over. I have marked
The facing of my friend for many years,
And counselled him, as well yourself doth know ;
But all in vain ! Ho hath o’erstepp’d the bounds
On which the moral earth is built, and over
He tumbles headlong into empty space !
Peter.
I thought he had religion.
Harold.
Aye, he had !
And had it in his head until the last.
But he had gone on doubting, doubting, till
At last he doubted all. Ah ! his religion,
Like the bright picture of a fire in winter,
Gave neither light nor heat, when both were needed 1
Peter.
Alas ! and was it so ? Then could I put
With the Apostle the same question now,
“ Lord, are there many saved ? ”
Harold.
Saved ! did you say ?
O, were it not for God’s long-suffering grace
The number would be small! Ah, friend ! how many


Make shipwreck of their faith in Time’s broad ocean
Through a mis-pilotage 1 One little point
Decides our fate in Life’s eventful voyage.
A sentence —half a sentence —oft a word—
Settles our destiny ! One flash of lightning
Has struck how many into utter night ?
And so one gleam of thought—one crooked gleam—
Has fix’d some souls for ever !
Petee,
How, my friend,
Can this be possible ?
Haeold.
’Tis more than possible !
’Tis settled fact, old as the human race * * *
Man’s being here is mystery in part;
With some ’tis mystery all # * * 0, the great world
With her distracted millions running mad !
One half are mad ; another fourth would be,
But business steadies them ; and the remainder,
With terrible striving and ten thousand helps,
Preserve an equipoise, yet one so fickle,
The lightest puff upsets them ! True, there are
A few firm-footed who have found the Bock
Which sages still are seeking; these are safe.
O, what distracting times ! Where’s the dancer
Can foot it in the sky P What daring swimmer
Can breast the Maelstrom ? Man may have a
power,
But when he dares to cope with deathless laws
Strong as the elements, alas ! alas!
We know how ends the strife !


Peter.
I hear it said
You took your friendship from him when he shook.
Harold.
Aye, when the tree begins to sway a-top,
The veriest fool has prudence to withdraw.
By many ways I sought to wile him hack —
By dumb suggestions, hut by converse most;
Until so much inclining to his will
Brought me in danger. Then I came to doubt
My safety, and restrained me for a time
Beyond my usual; till at last by force,
Like a poor ship which will not bide her moorings,
I cut the cable loose, and let him drive,
And at a safer distance followed him,
And still I follow.
Peter.
I expect you heard
How he outraged the doctor, whom they brought
To visit him while in a wandering mood ?
Harold.
I heard about it all. He would have slain
His physic friend had not his own relations
By force restrained him. And though bandaged thus
He cursed him fearfully ; and not till then
’Twas known that he could curse. The worthy
doctor
Was loaded with offensive epithets.
Of course, like a well-mannered gentleman,


He took it patiently, knowing the mind
In revolution.
Pexeb.
Mercy on his wife !
Hah old.
God bless her, Peter J jf an angel ever
Came to this earth Wearing a woman’s form,
She is that angel. Charity enshrined
"Would be her proper name ; for hopeful patience
Sits smiling on her forehead, like an iris
On clouds, and storrn, and darkness.
{Exit.


SCENE XV.
NEAR THE MURRAY.
Philosopher sauntering along solus.
Philos.
Men say that I have gone beyond myself,
That my poor brain is crazed with over-knowledge ;
That Ido wander wide ! lam a man
Whom understanding men misunderstand.
My over-knowledge, as some call it, means
A morning view to tender-sighted eyes ;
Or a poor giddy-headed little girl’s
Pirst glimpse of a vast city from a hill.
I dwelt amongst a wilderness of pines,
Tall, dark, and branchy, whose outspreading arms
Kept one another up. There did I make,
Though only for a time, my lowly home ;
And grew up in the universal growth.
But the day came when, with much practising,
I could sit safe upon the highest tree
Which grew in all that forest; and when there,
Par in the distance —nearer to the place
Where rising suns are seen —I saw a range
Of glorious mountains, sunning them in light
While all around was dark. Their sight to me
Was like the sighting of a blessed lake
To a thirst-dying man ; for in my breast


My heart did yearn for something, and this view
Did give that yearning a locality.
And then the work began ! Only myself
Can tell the number of the anxious days,
The many sleepless nights through which my life
Went rolling like a restless sphere through space :
Now to the everlasting sun exposed,
And now immersed in Night’s chaotic gloom,
But never, never resting, never still!
Only myself, poor pilgrim, can tell
The intricacies, and the rapid floods,
The yawning chasms, and the stony steeps,
And the wide waste of snows, and dreary plains
Which I with toil surmounted and surpassed,
Or ere I won the object of my search.
And what has been my gain ? Gain ! aye, my gain !
My gain has been my loss. First my enjoyment
Of earth’s small pleasures left me ; then my friends
Hung down their heads and passed me, or thrust out
An icy hand. My wife half-shunned me, too # * *
And then —and then —the precious consolations
Which from religion I had often had
Seemed all withheld. * * * I cannot but exclaim,
0 that I were as in the days gone by,
While yet the candle of my God was shining
Upon my face, and I saw far before !
But all is darkness now ; and day and night
Will never more in their appointed places
Divide the swift monotony of Time.
The changeful moon, now horny, and now full,
With all the planets, and the multitudes


Of lesser lights will come no more above
The world’s blank rim. Dark 1 dark ! a fearful dark
Environs me, in which I sometimes hear
The cry of doleful creatures, as in sport,
Laughing and weeping, and with ugly taunts
Tormenting my poor life ; until my soul,
Like the old suffering Hebrew’s, chooses rather
A death by strangling. There is no rest for me!
Hither I’m driven by blind necessity ;
I know not wherefore. O, my precious wife ! ——
But now my senses reel, my heart is sore ;
May Ood forgive me! I can stand no more !
[Exit,


SCENE XVI.
NEAR THE MURRAY.
Harold and Trooper searching.
Trooper.
He must hare gone this way. See! here are tracks !
Harold.
Aye, so there are ! The print resembles his.
Trooper. (Talcing oul a pooled rule and measuring.)
The measurement is his. It is his foot!
He took a lengthy stride. And see ! how straight!
He must have gone in haste.
Harold.
Tos, yes, but see !
Here has he made a pause.
Trooper.
Indeed he has!
Harold.
Now, could this shrub but speak we’d have a tale.
It has some secrets heard, I warrant you.
But let us hasten. Here are strides again ;
Though, by the zigzag coursing, and the drag
Of dust along the tracks, and lighter dip
Of toe and heel there shows no sign of haste.
n


Teoopee.
I fear the finding. Look here ! Look again !
lie’s made another pause 1
Haeold.
Tes ! We are near
The river, are we not ?
Teoopee.
Aye, very near :
Do you not hear its murmur, sir ? I can.
List! can’t you hear it now ?
Haeold.
Tes ; I can hear.
0 dreadful! dreadful! see the tracks again
Do straight toward the bank, as if a hand
Had led him thus along.
Teoopee.
Did he over
Visit the river to your knowledge, sir ?
Haeold.
No, never to my knowledge.,
Teoopee.
Wonderful
To see so true a guidance!
[An eagle darts by.
Haeold.
Those who mock
At spiritual conductors, sir, are fools.
Had we but proper sight I have small doubt
But we’d see other footprints. Satan’s self


Cannot be far away ! None but that fiend
Would bring my poor friend here.
Tiioopee.
Sir, was it Satan
Who led our Saviour to the wilderness ?
Haeoed.
It was ; but see, there is a slip of paper !
No, it is an envelope —a letter!
[.Examining it.
His hand ! his very hand ! ’tis wrote with pencil.
A letter to his wife. Let us proceed.
[An abrupt pause.
What! this the river’s brink ? Below me far
Rolls the great silent flood, wending his way
Towards the spacious ocean, like my friend
Dissatisfied with Time, and wandering seeking
Infinitude’s vast circle. O, noble river !
Couldst thou not teach one traveller to bo calm ?
To journey on in his appointed path,
Even like thyself ; to leave the difficult,
And gracefully the rocky ridges shun ?
Thou art no mountain-climber, but prefer’st
The lowly valley and the level plain.
There thou art strong —yea, irresistible !
O, wherefore, then, with those expressive lips
Did you not whisper to this erring child
The secret of your deep tranquility,
Your majesty, and strength ? Perhaps you did—
Perhaps you did ! for he could understand


Such voices as your own ; and if he heard,
Heaven grant that your monition ho not lost,
For thou canst turn a brute !
Teoopee.
Here is a hat !
And here the bank has crumbled down. 0, look !
Yonder’s a crowd of people ! Hither come
They, bearing somewhat!
[Four men appear carrying a hocly.
Haeold.
All is over now !
Ist Steangee.
Sir, do you know the corpse ?
Haeold.
I knew its owner.
2nd Steangee.
He lost his footing, sir ! I saw him tumble.
Haeold.
Yes, so did I! His falls are over now !
Bring on his body ; we will lead the way.
Transition terrible ! Just now in Time ;
Now in Eternity ! Now warm and bright;
Now dark and cold ! Important fools, to think
So much depends on us ! The evening breeze
Blows on the dead man’s face as full and fresh
As on the living damsels gathering flowers;
The sunlight falls the same! The shadows pass
In the same order o’er a wise man’s corpse,


Which learning made profound when life was there,
As o’er a slaughter’d lamb’s. We vainly rate
Our individual worth when full-toned life
Is pulsing through our veins. Then are we kings!
And in our puny hands we seem to hold
The magic sceptre-wand which does control
The fate of all. O, vanity sublime ! * * *
Like a dead insect man goes floating down
The flood of Time, while in the fields around,
And in the sky,
Life moves along unconscious of a break.
His place will soon be filled : but not to me
Will consolation carol for a while.
[They pass along.


SCENE XVII.
A VILLAGE AMONGST THE HILLS.
Cuenuysian and Peteb conversing under a verandah.
Peteb.
I ever thought his mind was nicely balanced.
Clebgt.
And so it was : but trust me, honest sir,
’Tis almost a misfortune in this world,
As things are going now, to be the owner
Of what you call a nicely-balanced mind ;
Unless, presiding o’er its faculties,
Religion sits enthroned. And, mark me, not
Her substitute or semblance, but religion
Which, like a prudent governor, looks up
To the Supreme for guidance.
Peteb.
Do you think
That ho will see salvation ?
Clebgy.
Glod forbid
That I should put a period to Ilis grace
By thinking that he might not! but, my friend,
We cannot be too humble. Keep to truth,
And pray for light; aye, pray for strength of heart


To keep you in the faith ; for in our day
The “ mystery of iniquity” doth work.
Poor man ! his end was sad.
Peter.
Think has his wife
Tet heard the story ?
Clergy.
Tes, I told it her.
And—blest be He who doth sustain the weak ! —•
I was surprised to see how well she stood it.
When in the sad disclosure I had come,
After a boding prelude, to the finding
Of her dear husband’s body, at the first
I thought she would have swoon’d ; but, gathering
breath,
She fix’d her tearful face on Heaven, and said,
“My God, forsake me not! ” and sat her down
In mournful silence.
Peter.
How could one so weak
Resign herself to such a sore decree,
With such a grace and nobleness of heart ?
I cannot understand it!
Clergy.
Ah! my friend,
There’s much in life we cannot understand,
And never will. The simple trusting ones
Are blest to-day, and ever have been blest,
As self-sufficient strength hath never been :


“ The simple things of earth confound the mighty.”
And hero is where the wondrous difference lies
Between the Worldling and the Child of Hod —
One trusts in self, or in material help
Which self controls ; the other hangs on Him
Who all controls, and never casts those off
Who only trust Him. She is one of these ;
And she is blest.
Peter.
It does me good to hear it.
Do you think her well provided for ?
I would assist her to my utmost power
If she required it.
Clergy.
Yes ! she has been left
Quito a sufficiency of worldly store ;
And she has many friends ; beside as good
A father as the morning breeze ere kissed.
Peter.
I’ve often heard him called “ an honest man.”
Clergy.
He is, indeed, and more. I know not one
So near to my ideal as he is;
Honest in everything. He would not wrong
A sucking calf, far less a man or woman.
His wife has more of hardness in her make,
Yet is she generous hearted, and most just:
In this same world, so full of cruel crotchets,
Oft has she kept her spouse from being wronged.


Peter.
Her husband disapproved the daughter’s choice !
Clergy.
Only in part. He loved the man sincerely,
But thought him over-learned for his child.
And right he was ! As many in our days
Are spoiled by over-learning, as there are
Ruin’d without it. Solomon was right:
Much study wearies mind as well as flesh.
There’s telescopic men, and microscopic ;
Give me plain spectacles ! Ido not want
To understand the nature of the planets,
Or animalcule life, until I’ve learned
The purpose of my being, and the lesson
Of human life ; which properly to master
Will take an hundred years. I’d sooner cultivate
Cabbage or cucumber, than knowledge which
Would sink mo earthward like a leaden weight.
Poor Paul and Silas in a prison frame
Could pray and praise! but, bless you, honest man,
The ways of our high learned ones is enough
To make one curse at Life ! I have respect
Por learning when it keeps in proper bounds,
With salutary purposes in view ;
But these mistaken, mad experiments
Which men are crying up, are bringing down
A blasting curse upon us. Lawless thought,
Clashing opinions, scientific hoaxes,
Worse many times than boorish ignorance,
Proclaim the Doom Day near !
I


Peter.
Do you beliovo
In the millenium, sir P
[A bell begins tolling.
Cbeegt.
See, yonder comes
The little funeral party. He shall rest
On consecrated ground ; for no one place
Is holier than another since our Lord
Put on our flesh and walked about the world.
It is too late to build distinctions here;
The Resurrection morning will deride :
The grave’s a common lodging, free to all.
Poor helpless mourners, what do ye avail ?
Yes, willing or not willing, we must follow
Our loved ones to the grave, even as the stars
Each other follow to the murky west.
Then let us go and join them, and impart
The comfort which we have. I must improve
This sad occasion for the sake of those
Who are alive. O, may they take it home !
[Exit CijEboymAjST and Peter. After an
interval , singing heard in the distance.
Hark ! a gentle voice is calling
From the Silent City’s gates,
As our weary ones are falling,
Calling to their living mates —
“ From the highways of Existence,
“ From Life’s meadows full of sin ;
“ Bring the pilgrims to their lodgings :
“ Bring them in ! bring them in !


“ There are dangers in the valleys ;
“ Mountain tops are hard to win;
“ Pity the forlorn and lowly :
“ Bring them in ! bring them in !
“ Lo! a wintry sun is setting,
“ Starless night will soon begin ;
“ There is rest here for the weary :
“ Bring them in ! bring them in !
“ Gather them from busy cities ;
“ Question not their kith or kin ;
“ Gather them from rural hamlets ;
“ Bring them in ! bring them in !
“ Bring them from the roaring ocean,
“ From the field of battle’s din ;
“ One by one from every dwelling,
“ Bring them in ! bring them in ! ”
As the chilly night is falling
On poor tired ones, pale and thin,
Still that gentle voice is calling,
“ Bring them in ! bring them in ! ”
