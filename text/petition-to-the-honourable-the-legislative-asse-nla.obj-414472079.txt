PETITION.
•a / r J
To the Honourable the Legislative Assembly of Queensland , in Parliament assembled, the
Petition of the undersigned, John Dunmore Lang, Doctor of Divinity, Senior Minister of
the Scots Church, Sydney, and one of the Representatives of the City of Sydney in the
Parliament of New South Wales,
HUMBLY SREWETH—
1. That, up to the year 1845, the late Sir Thomas Mitchell described the Colony of New
South Wales, of which he was then Surveyor General, as extending from the Tropic of Capricorn to Bass s
Straits—an extent of territory equal to that of five or six European Kingdoms—and as resembling on the
map a spread eagle, of which New South Wales proper was the body, and Sydney the head, while Tort
Phillip and Moreton Bay were the two wings.
2. That, in the year 1840, your petitioner had occasion to visit the Lnited States of America,
and to traverse not fewer than eleven ot these States, from Salem in Massachusetts to Charleston in South
Carolina; and that he thereby incidentally ascertained, to his own complete satisfaction, while pursuing
enquiries of a totally different character, that the welfare and good government of the American people, ot
which there could be no doubt whatever in these States, did not depend, in any material degree, on the votes
and proceedings of their National Congress, with which, in ordinary circumstances, they came very little
into contact, but on the fact of their vast territory being subdivided into a whole series of Sovereign and
Independent States—each of the average extent of 40,000 square miles, less or more according to the
natural features of the country, and each having a House of Representatives, a Senate, and a Government
of its own, supreme within its own Territory.
3. That, towards the close of the year 1841, your Petitioner, having in the mean time returned
to New South Wales, found on his first visit to the district of Port Phillip, now the colony of Victoria, as
also on a subsequent visit in the year 1843, that the people of that district—which comprised a superficial
extent of eighty-five thousand square miles, that is an area equal to that ot the whole island ot Great
'Britain, and double the average extent of an American State—were agitating for their entire separation
from New South Wales, and their erection into a distinct and independent colony.
4. That, at a public meeting in Melbourne on the latter of these occasions, your Petitioner
expressed his cordial approval of their procedure in this particular, and detailed to them, what he had
ascertained so very shortly before, from his own personal observation, as to the very limited average extent
of the American States, and the beneficial results of that arrangement to the general population; adding,
in reference to Sir Thomas Mitchell’s description of New South Wales, that in his opinion it was then
high time that Port Phillip, one of the wings of Sir Thomas’ spread eagle, should be lopped off, and pre-
dicting that if this were done, Moreton Bay, the other wing, would in due time be lopped off also.
5. That, in the year 1843, your Petitioner was elected one of the six members for Port Phillip,
in the first Legislative Council, or semi-representative Legislature of New South Wales—partly from the
hope, which his constituents entertained, of his thereby advancing and promoting the paramount object of
their aspirations —their entire separation from that colony.
6. That, in the year 1844, your Petitioner accordingly moved, in the Legislative Council of
New South Wales, that a humble address be presented to Her Majesty the Queen, praying that Her
Majesty would be graciously pleased to take the requisite steps for the separation of the district of Port
Phillip from New South Wales, and for its erection into a distinct and independent colony.
7. That, although the six Port Phillip members were all strongly in favour of this motion, and
voted for it unanimously, the only vote which was given in support of it by any ot the other thirty members
of the Legislative Council, whether Elective Members or Government Nominees, was that of Robert, (now
the Right Honourable Robert) Lowe, who was then a Government Nominee Member of the Legislative
Council of New South Wales.
8. That the tidings of this most unfavourable result of their reasonable expectations from the
Colonial Legislature, and the dark and hopeless prospect which it afforded them for the future, were received
by the Separation Committee of Melbourne and the people of Port Phillip generally, with extreme dis-
appointment and strong and vehement indignation.
9. That, in these circumstances, your Petitioner addressed a letter to the said committee,
informing them that, however hopeless the attainment of their separation from New South Wales might be,
as far as the Colonial Legislature was concerned, there was still a door of hope open for them in the unan-
imity of their own six members in favour of that object; adding that if these members should petition Her
Majesty the Queen, in their own names and on behalf of their constituents, he had reason to anticipate a


more favourable result, and recommending them, in the event of their concurring with him in such opinion,
to urge the six members to adopt the course he had thus indicated.
10. That the Separation Committee of Melbourne having accordingly requested the six
members to address a humble Petition to Her Majesty, praying for separation, and the said six members
having cordially acceded to their request, your Petitioner was deputed to draw up the proposed petition to
Her Majesty, which he did acordingly, to the satisfaction of the other five members : and on that petition
being signed by all the six, and by them presented in a body to His Excellency Sir George Gipps, who was
then Governor of New South Wales, on one of the last days of December, 1844, it was transmitted by
His Excellency to the Right Honourable Lord Stanley, then Principal Secretary of State for the colonies,
in the month of January, 1845.
11. That, in the month of October, of that year, a Dispatch arrived in the colony from Lord
Stanley, now Earl Derby, informing the Governor that her Majesty had been graciously pleased to grant the
boon solicited in the Petition of the six Port Phillip members, and that the requisite steps would accord-
ingly be taken for the separation of that District from New South Wales, and for its erection into a
distinct colony.
12. That, in the month of November, 1845, your Petitioner visited the Moreton Bay district
of the colony for the first time, and was greatly struck, during his stay, with what appeared to him the
remarkable adaptation of that district for becoming the seat of a separate and independent colony ; the great
inlet of Moreton Bay appearing to your Petitioner as well adapted for becoming a great centre for com-
fiierce, for pastoral pursuits, for agriculture, and for government, for the country around it, as either Port
Jackson of Port Phillip : but that wherever your Petitioner ventured to suggest this idea, during his stay
in Moreton Bay, and to urge the propriety of the cob-mists agitating on the subject, with a view to its
prospective and eventual realization, it was uniformly ridiculed and laughed at as something, however
desirable, equally hopeless and chimerical.
13. That your Petitioner, having proceeded to England in the year 184 G, and having been
invited by the authorities in Downing Street, as an Australian colonist of long standing and a member of
the Colonial Legislature, to submit to the Right Honourable, Earl Grey, then Principal Secretary of State
for the colonies, any suggestions that might occur to him as of importance, in the prospect of an Act of
Pailiament then Under contemplation being passed for the better government of the Australian colonies,
addressed a' letter accordingly to his Lordship, early in the year 1847, in which, among other points of
important® in the prospect of such a measure, he took the liberty to suggest, for reasons which he stated
formally and at length, that in the forthcoming Act of Parliament, there should be a clause inserted, author-
ising Her Majesty, whenever she might deem it expedient and necessary, to separate from New South
Wales, and to erect into a distinct colony, the territory extending northward from the thirtieth parallel of
latitude.
14. That the following were some of the reasons urged by your Petitioner for the separation of
the Moreton Bay district from New South Wales, and its erection into a distinct colony ; viz; —
First—That the great inlet of Moreton Bay was as evidently calculated and designed by the
Creator, to be the Head-quarters of a distinct colonial system, as either Port Jackson or Port Phillip.
Secondly —That assuming the thirtieth parallel of latitude as the boundary between New
South Wales and a future colony to the northward, each of these three great inlets would, as nearly as
possible, be in the centre of a coast-line of five hundred miles, a sufficient extent of coast for any one
Colony in Australia,
Thirdly —That as there was a remarkable change in the vegetation, indicating a corresponding
change in the climate and natural productions, at the boundary line between Poit Phillip and New South
Wales, (which, it was then assumed, would be the Murrurnbidgee River, to the westward of the Australian
Alos,) there was an equally remarkable change, indicating a corresponding change in the climate and natural
productions, at the thirtieth parallel of latitude —the swamp oak of New South Wales being unknown
in Port Phillip, and the Moreton Bay pine being unknown to the southward of the thirtieth parallel.
15. That the Bill for the better government of the Australian colonies, which had been sub-
mitted to the Imperial Parliament by Earl Grey in the year 1847, not having been passed in that year,
your Petitioner, being Still in England, addressed a second letter to his Lordship in the year 1848, and a
third in 1849 ; repeating and enforcing the suggestion to which he had called his Lordship’s attention in
1847, and strongly recommending that a clause should be introduced into the then forthcoming Act of
Parliament, authorising Her Majesty to separate the Moreton Bay district from New South Wales, at the
thirtieth parallel of latitude, and to erect it into a distinct colony.
IG. That, simultaneously with these efforts for the separation of the Moreton Bay district
from New South Wales, your Petitioner published a work in London in the year 1847, under the title of
Cdoksland in North Eastern Australia; the future cotton-fieldof Great Britain ; its characteristics and
capabilities for European Colonization-, and that in the introduction to that work, of which the principal
object was to direct a stream of virtuous emigration to that portion of the Australian territory, at a time
when it was almost utterly unknown in England, and when its entire population did not exceed five
thousand souls, he expressed himself as follows : “ The portion of the Great South Land, to a description
of the characteristics and capabilities of which the following pages are devoted, is on the east coast of
Australia, and must necessarily, at no distant period, become a separate and independent colony, and will in
all likelihood prove one of the most important colonies that Great Britain has ever planted.' 5
17. That, in order still further to develope the extraordinary capabilities of the Moreton Bay
district, and to originate a copious stream of virtuous emigration to tliat little known portion of the


Australian territory, your Petitioner despatched from London, to Moreton Bay, in the years 18-18 aud 18-49,
although with great pecuniary loss to himself eventually, three ships with about six hundred well selected
emigrants altogether ; arid that the remarkably beneficial influence of this comparatively early emigration—•
the first that had ever been directed from the United Kingdom to Moreton Bay —on the progress and
general advancement of that district, is too well known to your Honourable House to require any further
notice by your Petitioner.
18. That while the Bill for the better government of the Australian colonies was before the
Imperial Parliament, in the years 1847, 1848 and 1819, your Petitioner succeeded in enlisting in favour of
the objects he had recommended to Earl Grey, various influential Members of Parliament, and particularly
Mr. John Bright, and the Honourable Francis Scott, a brother of Lord Polwarth’s and then member fpr
Berwick ; preparing and placing in the hands of the latter gentleman, who then took a special interest in
the Australian colonies, with a view to his laying it on the table of the House of Commons when the Bill
should be under discussion in that House, a sketch of the territories to be affected by the proposed Act,
demonstrating the reasonableness and propriety of the suggestions which your Petitioner had made to Earl
Grey, with a view to the better government of these colonies.
19. That the Imperial Act for this purpose, so long before Parliament, and so repeatedly
withdrawn, and amended, was finally passed in the year 1850, and contained, to the great gratification of
Vour Petitioner, the clause he had so repeatedly suggested to Earl Grey, authorising Her Majesty to
separate from New South Wales, whenever she might deem it expedient and necessary, the Moreton Bay
district of that colony, at the thirtieth parallel of latitude, and to erect it into a distinct colony.
20. That, up to this period, the idea of disjoining the Moreton Bay district from New South
Wales, and constituting it a separate and distinct colony, had never even been suggested, far less advocated
and enforced, by any other person whatsoever than your Petitioner ; and that the only reason why your
Petitioner addre.-sed himself on the subject to the Imperial authorities exclusively, and kept the object
steadily before them in letter after letter, and by every other available means, for three years in succession,
was his firm belief aud conviction that, after the contemptuous treatment which the claims of Port Phillip
met with from the Legislative Council of New South Wales, in the year 1844, the separation of Moreton
Bay, and its erection into a distinct colony, would never have been assented to by the Colonial Legislature.
21. That your Petitioner is morally certain that the separation of Moreton Bay would not have
been guaranteed even by the Imperial Act of 1850, if your Petitioner had not been in England, to watch over
the Parliamentary measure then in contemplation, and to agitate the point in favor of Moreton Bay, during
the three previous years ; for in the first and second editions of Earl Grey’s Bill for the better government
of the Australian colonies, which were submitted to Parliament in the years 1847 and 1848, but sub-
sequently withdrawn, the separation clause was not inserted, and it was only through the repeated and
urgent representations ot your Petitioner, both to Government and to private members of parliament, in
consequence of its omission in these Bills, that it was at length inserted in the Act of 1850.
22. That the first Petition of the colonists of Moreton Bay for separation from New South
W ales at the thirtieth parallel of latitude, was suggested and originated by your Petitioner, in addresses
which he delivered at various public meetings in Brisbane aud Ipswich, in the year 1851, and that that
Petition, numerously signed by all classes of the community, was carried to England, and presented by yonr
Petitioner to the Right Honourable Sir John Pakiugton, then Principal Secretary of State for the colonies,
in the year 1852,
23. That, shortly after his return to the colony on that occasion, your Petitioner w r as elected
a member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales, for the county of Stanley, in the Moreton Bay
district, in the year 1854—chiefly with a view to his promoting the separation prospectively guaranteed in
the Imperial Act of 1850, as also to his counteracting the effort that had then been making in certain
influential quarters to transform the Moreton Bay district into a penal colony; and that, during his stay in
Moreton Bay on that occasion, your Petitioner again delivered addresses, in advocacy of separation at the
thirtieth parallel, both in Brisbane and Ipswich.
24. That, in the year 1856, when a strong effort was made, in the New South Wales Parlia-
ment, to alter the boundary fixed by the Imperial Act, so as to include the Clarence and Richmond Rivers
district, situated to the northward of the thirtieth parallel, in New South Wales, and the late governor ot
that colony, Sir William Denison, had lent himself to the selfish and ungenerous proposal, your Petitioner
visited the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district in person, and in an address which he delivered at a
large public meeting held on the subject in Grafton, convinced and satisfied the inhabitants generally, who
were previously but little aware of the real merits of the question, that it would be greatly to their interest
to be conjoined with the Northern rather than with the Southern colony; and a large majority of the
resident householders, both on the Clarence and the Richmond Rivers, accordingly signed a petition, which
was forthwith transmitted to England in the usual way, for separation at the thirtieth parallel: but that
through the hostile influences referred to above, these efforts were unfortunately unsucessful; the Clarence
aud Richmond Rivers district being still included in New South Wales—an arrangement so preposterous
and unseemly, so obviously unjust, and so utterly inconsistent with a proper and becoming regard, on the
part of its authors, for the best interests, as well as for the rights of all concerned, that your Petitioner
firmly believes, as well as hopes and trusts, that it cannot and will not be permanent.
25. That an Act of the Imperial Parliament, separating the Moreton Bay district from New
South Wales, and constituting it the colony of Queensland, was passed in the year 185*9, and proclaimed in
the colony by His Excellency, Sir George Bowen, on the 10th of December of that year.
26. That your Petitioner, having had occasion to proceed to England towards the close of the
year 18j0, drew up beforehand a Petition to Her Majesty the Queen, which was numerously signed by a


large majority of alf classes of the inhabitants of the Clarence and Richmond Rivers district, praying for
annexation to Queensland, and protesting against the unwarrantable sacrifice of their obvious and uudovbted
interests and wtdfare by retaining them in unwilling connection with New South W ales.
27 That this Petition was carried to England by your Petitioner, and submitted to His Grace
the Duke of Newcastle, then Principal Secretary of State for the colonies, in the year 1861 ; but as it had
not been transmitted through his Excellency Sir William Denison, the Governor for the time being, m con-
sequence of his known hostility to its prayer, your Petitioner had to bring it back with him to the colony;
from whence at the instance of the undersigned and in accordance with the wishes of the Petitioners, it was
again forwarded to His Grace by His Excellency the Right Honorable Sir John Young, the present governor
of New South Wales, towards the close of that year.
28. That during his stay in England, in the year 1861, your Petitioner published a work,
entitled Queensland, Australia ; a highly eligible field for Emigration, and the future cotton-field of Great
Britain : with a disquisition on the Origin, Manners and Customs of the Aborigines ; and he has reason to
believe that that work has done good service to this colony, in making its great capabilities known to the
British public, and in directing a very large stream of emigration, of a superior character, trom the United
Kingdom to its shores-
-29. That in these and other kindred efforts for the welfare and advancement of the Australian
colonies generally, and especially of Queensland—efforts undertaken spontaneously by your Petitioner, and solely
from a sincere desire to promote the best interests of his adopted country ; conducted exclusively, from first to
last at his own private expense, and persevered in, often in the midst of heartless indifference, and in the
face of the grossest misrepresentation and the most unmerited obloquy, during a long series of years -your
Petitioner has sacrificed much valuable property of his own, which would otherwise have now formed, for
himself and his family, a large colonial fortune ; but that in contemplating the magnificent results of these
efforts in the prominent position and unexampled success of this noble colony, since it entered upon its proud
career less than five years since, he has no reason to regret the sacrifices he has made, the hardships he has
experienced, and the misrepresentation and calumny he has had to endure these many years past.
30. That, on the 14th of September, 1860, very shortly after the new colony had sprung into
existence, a Resolution to the following effect, which was duly acknowledged at the time by your Petitioner,
was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Queensland, during its first session ; viz ;
“That the thanks of this House be given to the Revd. John Dunmore Lang, D.D., for his able and success-
ful efforts for the separation of Moreton Bay from New South Wales, and to found the colony ot
Queensland.”
Your Petitioner, however, humbly prays that now that this noble colony
has not only survived the struggles of its infancy, but has already, in its earlier youth,
made such successful and gigantic strides in the way of progress and development, as
have never been equalled by any other colony in the British empire, your Honorable House
will be pleased to take the sen ices of your Petitioner into further and favorable consideration.
And your Petitioner, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c., &c., &c.
( Signed)
JOHN DUNMORE LANG.
