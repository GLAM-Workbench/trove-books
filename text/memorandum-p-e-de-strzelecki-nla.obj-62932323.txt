Memorandum .
In the course of my travels round the world, I paid a visit to Australia in 1838, with the
object of taking only a cursory view of that remarkable continent.
Sir George Gipps, Governor-General of New South Wales and its dependencies at that
time, knowing that I was collecting materials for an outline of the physical geography of the
countries which I was visiting, suggested to me to avail myself of the extensive and unexplored
field for inquiry which was before me in New South Wales and Tasmania, and eventually per-
suaded me to abandon my desire of a cursory view, and to undertake a thorough survey of the
two colonies. At the same time, as such a survey could only be accomplished at a considerable
expenditure of time and money, Sir George Gipps assured me, that should my researches lead to
results likely to be of public advantage, he would recommend Her Majesty?s Government to com-
pensate me for any outlay which I might he obliged to incur.
On receiving that assurance, I entered upon the survey of New South Wales and Tasmania
without delay.
I began my labours in 1838, two months after my arrival at Sydney, and terminated them
at the end of 1843.
Besides these five years of constant labour in the open field, during which I travelled
? ' : ?
over 7000 miles on foot, with the necessary number of attendants and pack-horses, provided by
myself for the special purpose of the survey, enduring many privations, much personal danger, and
?* >? . ? , , ,
serious losses in instruments and collections, I incurred an outlay amounting to �5OOO.
The results ?independent of charts, together with vertical sections illustrating the physical
character of New South Wales and Tasmania, and which have been placed by me at the public
service?were:?-
Ist. The discovery of the Gold Fields in Bathurst and Wellington counties, in 1839.
2nd, The discovery, in 1840, of a very large tract of country, suited for pasture and
- agriculture, well watered by rivers and lakes, named by me ? Gipps Land,? and
which, being cut off from New South Wales by the chain of Australian Alps,
and by a zone of an almost impenetrable scrub, was, previous to my survey and
description of it, altogether inaccessible to colonisation.
The above discoveries were successively reported by me to the Governor-General, according
to the date at which they were respectively made.
The first discovery?that of gold?was kept secret from the public by Sir George Gipps,
who reported it confidentially to Her Majesty?s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Moreover, I
was warned by him of the responsibility which I should incur if I gave publicity to this discovery;
since, as he argued, by proclaiming the penal colonies to be gold regions, the maintenance of discipline


among the 45,000 convicts which New South Wales, Tasmania, and Norfolk Island at that time
contained, would become almost impossible; and, unless the penal code should be amended at home,
transportation would become a premium upon crime, and cease to be a punishment. These reasons
of State policy had great weight with me; and I willingly deferred to the representations of the
Governor-General, notwithstanding that they were opposed to my private interests.
As regards the second discovery, that of ?Gipps Land,? Sir George Gipps gave to it
at once the greatest publicity ; and Lord John Russell (now Earl Russell), then-Secretary of
State for the Colonies, was made acquainted with it in an official despatch, bearing the date of
28th September, 1840.
In answer to these confidential and official communications of the Governor-General, one
despatch only from the Secretary of State was communicated to me ; namely, that dated Downing
Street, 23rd June, 1841, in which Lord John Russell, in consideration of my services, recommended
me to. Sir George Gipps for an appointment in the colony* ?- - :
Gracious as that recommendation was, it did not accord with the inducement on the part
of Sir George Gipps, under which I had undertaken and completed the survey. Besides, I was not

link the cursory views already taken with those which still remained to be effected in Java, Borneo,
the .Philippine Islands, and China. Finally, I was desirous of reaching England, in order that I
might be enabled to attend to the publication of the ? Physical Description of New South Wales
and Tasmania,? a work which I had pledged myself ,to the Colonists to publish. This promise I
fulfilled on my return to this country, and I accomplished my task in 1845.
Upon the publication of the above work, I availed myself of an opportunity to bring my
claims before Her Majesty?s Government. An application on my behalf was made to Lord Stanley
(now Lord Deebt), the Secretary of State for the Colonies, by my friend the late Dr. Stanley,
Bishop of Norwich. In reply to him his Lordship said,? that he is well aware of Count Strzelecki?s
? * *
services, and of the valuable addition to the colony of New South Wales [the discovery of c Gipps
Land ]., which Was mainly owing to his researches; and that he very much regrets that Sir George
Gipps should not have found an opportunity for acting in Count Strzelecki?s favour, upon' the
suggestion of Lord John Russell, which he should have had great pleasure in sanctioning.? -
After this reply, I did not deem it proper to press my case further on the consideration of the
Secretary of State till I had seen Sir George Gipps, who was returning home, and upon whose
pledges and assurances I relied with the utmost confidence. In this expectation also I was doomed
to disappointment. Sir George Gipps died a few days after his landing at Southampt on. His
death, coupled with the difficulties which j I had experienced in bringing my claims sufficiently to
the attention of Her Majesty?s Government, made me think seriously of returning to Australia, with
the object of bringing the knowledge which I possessed of the Australian Gold Fields into practical
, ' - . ... v ... .... .
use. But the famine in Ireland breaking out in the year 1846, I did not hesitate between the
distribution of public relief in that country and the pursuit of my private interests in Australia,
This mission, which I undertook at my own expense, and for the satisfaction of my own sense of
duty, never would have been mentioned here, had it not happened that during the four years in
wdiich Ireland was uppermost in my thoughts the secret of the gold deposits oozed out, and those
who opened out the Gold Fields to private, enterprise reaped the reward and advantages of them.


However disheartening this concurrence of adverse circumstances may have been* it was
consolatory to me that in the debate which arose in 1853* in the Legislative Assembly of New South
Wales* on the question of a public reward being granted for the discovery of the gold regions* my
claim to priority of discovery was clearly made out by the different speakers and members of the
Council* and by the documents which they produced. Furthermore* although the reward of �lo*ooo
went to him who taught the miners how to dig* and how to wash the gold* and not to me who dis-
covered the presence of the precious metal, still my credit as a topographical and geological surveyor
was unimpeached.
In addition to this* the recognition of my claims to the discovery of the Australian Gold
Fields by the Statistical Congress of Europe* which held its sitting under the presidency of His
Royal Highness the Prince Consort last year in London* and the expression of sympathy contained
in letters and articles which I have received upon this subject from statesmen and men of science in
this country* make me only feel the more conscious that adequate justice has not been done to my
labours of five years* and to my sacrifices of time and money* which have resulted in such vast
material advantages to the people of Australia and to the Mother Country.
