INTRODUCTION
TO make YOUR HOME just such a home as you would be proud of
—To eliminate waste and reduce building time gave birth to
the idea that brought into operation in the year 1913—nearly
a quarter of a century ago—The Brown and Broad Newstead Ready-to-
Erect System.
In the years that have elapsed over 2,000 buildings comprising homes
of various designs ranging from the small two-roomed dwelling to the
large station homestead, and from the small shop to the inspiring hostel
and banking premises have been planned and built by this modern
method.
The town of Mt. Isa (owned by the Mt. Isa Mines Ltd.) was planned
and most of the homes, offices, stores, bank, staff quarters, hospital, club
house, etc., were supplied and erected by Brown and Broad Newstead
Homes Ltd.
Mt. Isa is a model mining town, superior in every respect to any
other mining centre in Australia. Water, electric light and sewerage to
every house and every home is fly proofed.
What a tribute to the skill, experience and efficiency of Newstead
Modem Methods of building. In the pages that follow we have endeav-
oured to show you how this self same service can be of benefit to you.

Pictured in this Catalogue are homes of the most modern type—planned on effective lines—Homes that can be

hardwood if so desired. The whole made Ready-to-Erect by modern time saving machinery.
The “B & B” Newstead Home in a nutshell.
Foundation timbers cut to fit, and mortised. Joists,
studs, ceiling joists, and rafters all accurately cut to fit.
Door and window frames machined RIGHT. Hips,
barge boards, and fascias all cut and machined to correct
dimensions. Verandah posts and railings all ready to go
together.

Doors, casements, windows, fanlights, French lights
and fret panels carefully packed. Floorings, linings, walls,
and ceiling timbers, together with all mouldings, dressed
from thoroughly seasoned timbers, supplied in bulk, and
quantities guaranteed. You do not pay for waste in our
system.
ROOFING MATERlALS.—Galvanised iron, ridge
capping, spouting, down pipes, and fixings all complete.
IRONMONGERY. —Locks, hinges, and sash fasten-
ings, etc., with all screws required, are included. Nails of
proper size for the entire home.
STOVE RECESS. —Material for complete recess of
galvanised iron, with sheet for floor included where shown

PAINT MATERIALS.—Paint of best quality of any
colour the buyer may select, sufficient for three coats on

As a further proof of the value we give, it is import-
ant to note that we do not handle cheap paints, there
being no false economy in our policy. We guarantee that
the paints we supply are second to none. It is the lasting-
quality you want, and in ours you have it.
STUMPS AND BATTENS UNDER HOMES IN THIS
CATALOGUE.—We desire to make quite clear the fact
that we do NOT include stumps or battens under homes
in any of our prices. The reason for this is obvious.
Stumps are generally obtainable at or near the site, and
in consequence it is to your advantage to provide these.
As the height of all homes from the ground is not
uniform, we cannot make an exact estimate on this item.
Where battens are required we quote separately on
application, and at Bedrock Prices.
SAVE ON FREIGHT.
TANK.—Material for a 1,000 gallon tank with neces-
sary waste pipe, and tap, and timber for stand cut to size.
STUMP CAPS. —Moulded caps to all stumps.
One big advantage in buying a “Newstead Home” is
the money you save in rail freights. There is no waste to
pay freight on, and a special low rate is obtainable on
Newstead Ready-to-Erect Homes.

Experience and Efficiency in Modern Home Building
Until quite recently the accepted wav to build a Home was to consult a local con-
tractor or builder, just the same way as we used to have our shoes made by the local
shoemaker. The local shoemaker passed out of existence because lie couldn’t keep pace with
the times. The old wav of building is so expensive and so wasteful that it, too, is rapidly
passing out of existence and giving place to the modern monev-saving wav of building—
THE “B. & B. ” Newstead Way.
THE OLD WAY.
Here’# where hours cost you money. The lim-
ber ha* first to be cut to required lengths I the
ends cut off arc often wasted!. Then there’s hours
of work with brace and bit before the mallet
and chisel can even come into operation. Compare
this with the Newstead Modern way.
The Old
Expensive Way
First let us consider the old method of
employing the contractor or builder to build
us a home. To start with we must buy the
timber from the timber merchant and materials
from all the other merchants, on all of which
the builder must have his profit. Then there
are freight charges to pay, storage expenses —
piling up and taking down and repiling —and
then when the timber does at last reach the
spot for your home it is not improved by the
knocking about it has received. Then comes
the waste of time, of labour, and of material,
which must be considered. Carpenters must
spend costly time sawing and cutting to right
length and size—besides the timber they waste
bv not endeavouring to get the most out of
every stick. All this waste of labour, in time,
and in material will be charged to the owner
-—to you. Now let us forget these old
fashioned methods of building and learn of
the new way
THE NEWSTEAD MODERN WAY.
—THE MORTISING MACHINE.
No place in the Newstead way for brace and
bit. mallet and chisel——thi* Mortising Machine does
the work better and more accurate in a fraction
of the time.
Time saved in building your home means money
saved for you.
The “B. & B.” Economical
Way
Bight from the start, in the planning of the home, we are experts, and know our
business from A to Z. All the men engaged in the production of “B. & B.” Newstead Homes
are specialists in their own particular line. They are men who have spent their best years
in the business —they have made a study of it. We are experts in timber knowledge, con-
struction knowledge, and artistic knowledge—and this is the sort of service that is free to
you and every prospective home builder — the knowledge that gives you that complete satis-
fied feeling as you sit in your home of an evening, secure in the thought that yours is a fit
and substantial home- a proper abode for your greatest treasure- -your family.

modern machinery can do better
work at less cost than hand
labour. All the timber for “B. & B.” Newstead Homes is machined, and
cut to fit by the latest time and cost saving machinery at our Newstead
Mills, and is marked and numbered to correspond with the specifica-
tions and plans. When all is ready it goes to you—right in quality—
right in quantity—right in every particular. The framing being all
machine-cut and carefully marked—specially skilled labour is not needed.
You yourself or an ordinary carpenter- or handy man, can fit it together
quite easily.
How We Save Money for You!
It must be remembered that while we can help you build your
home, cutting waste, time, labour, and material down to the absolute
minimum—not in the most minute detail is quality sacrificed. All the
timber used in “B. and B.” Newstead Homes is carefully selected and
graded by experts. We control mills in the country besides our city
mills; also pine forests of vast extent, from which we receive many
thousands of feet daily. Think what this means to you. Timber, direct
from the forests to the mills, where it is cut and then thoroughly
seasoned. Only matured timber is used in “B. and B." Homes. You
pay only one profit. You have no cartage to be added to the price,
as the railway is connected with the mills, and we load all our materials
info trucks free of charge.
THE TWIN SAW FRAME.
Modern machinery at Newstead brings the cost
of Newstead Homes down to the lowest point-
This Twin Saw Boarding Frame cuts 72 boards
in one operation. Think what a saving mach-
inery is in preparing the timber for your home.

SAVING IN ERECTION TIME.
Just imagine the waste of money in the usual building
operations! Carpenters and others waiting around for the
timber, or for some additional material—they are put off
with half-a-load —or some other excuse is made. All this
time the builder is paying for idle labour. Now note the
saving in erection the “B. & B.” Newstead way. All the
material for your home comes at the one time—everything
ready to start at once. Every part of the frame carefully
marked, and mouldings carefully tied together. Every
stick of wood, all the hardware, paint, ironmongery, etc.,
is there to work with. Now you can see where the savings
come in. How time, work, and worry are eliminated. Then
when the actual building is commenced, you see the wis-
dom of our methods unfolded. You just unfold our plans
and directions which go with every home, and the erection
can proceed without a hitch, and in double quick time your
home stands before you.
You can build Newstead Homes by either of two methods. You can supervise the work yourself, or you can
place the job in the hands of a good local contractor.
Many prospective Newstead Home owners will find the work of erecting and finishing a pleasant diversion. Some
work at it in their spare hours or during vacation time.
If the house is erected by the owner, all that is necessary is to look over the erection plans (not complicated in
any way), and start the work.
To help you in the work of erecting, you can easily locate a carpenter, a handy man, or friend.
The job of erecting is as simple as building a toy house from a child’s blocks. The pieces fit exactly, each has its
place as explained on the plans, and the house is up like magic in record time, necessitating only a fraction of the
will be done as well as if you had employed a building
better plan is to employ a contractor to give you a price

Newstead erecting; diagrams are the essence of simplicity. They show, in a simple maimer, where each
numbered part goes. You need not consult anybody—nor need you have a technical knowledge of blue prints.

& YOUR HOME
«nM PLYWOOD
PANELLED WALLS
Panelled Walls once regarded as
something beyond the reach of the
home builder has thanks to modern
machinery now become a feature in
all Modern Home Building, and no
home can be said to be complete unless
at least the main rooms are Plywood
Panelled.
Walls treated in the manner as
shown on this page have a more pleas-
ing appearance and the value of the
home is considerably enhanced.
We recommend Plywood for inter-
iors. The cost of a double plywood
partition is no more expensive than a
single board partition, whilst a double
plywood wall is not only more attrac-
tive, but it is also practically sound-
proof.
We manufacture at our Newstead
Mills Plywoods and Veneers of all
descriptions—manufacture and make
Fancy Wood Panels of Silky Oak,
Maple and Walnut. These can be sup-
plied at a small extra cost for any of
the main rooms of Newstead Homes
featured.

IN CONCLUSION.
From the foregoing you will now be convinced
that to build a home by any other method than
the “B. & B.” Newstead way is to waste money. We
have explained to you exactly how it is possible for
us to save you many hard-earned pounds.
The rest lies entirely with you. Whether you
will lose money on the old method and probably not
be satisfied with the completed job, or buy your home
from us and get satisfaction, plus a big saving, should
not take you long to decide. Your own good judgment
will say “The ‘B. & B.’ Newstead plan appeals to me
in every way, and to lose sight of the advantages it
offers would be extravagance.”
PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP.
You will be proud too, of your Newstead Home,
whether it be the lowest priced or the most expensive
home in our book. You will be proud of the superior
construction and the fine quality of the materials used.
You will be proud of the judgment that helped you
to free yourself from the old, expensive,, wasteful
methods of building a home.
It may be that you are not quite certain which
home you prefer, or probably some other member of
your family likes one home and you like another.
Why not compromise? All you need do is to send us
a rough ground plan showing the sizes of the rooms
you require, and any arrangement you care to sug-
gest ; then our designers will immediately set to work-
and evolve a design to your exact requirements.
Build the Newstead Way—Save
POINTS TO REMEMBER.
Don’t forget that the labour in building a home
is a big item, and that we save you a big proportion
of this labour cost, because “B. & B.” Newstead
Homes comes to you Ready-to-Erect. Don’t forget
that you yourself can erect a Newstead Home before
the best workman can cut and erect the frame of a
home in the ordinary way. Don’t forget that “B & B.”
Newstead Homes are real homes—not houses—the
kind of homes women love for the conveniences—that
men love for the comforts—that everyone loves for
the beauty and refinement.
BY WAY OF ADVICE.
No doubt you will talk to your friends about the
“B & B.” Newstead Policy—you may tell them how
good, inexpensive-, and easy is the “B. & B.” way of
building. You may ask advice from a friend who is a
builder, a contractor, or an architect. We want to
suggest that you write down any question they ask,
which you cannot answer, and which this book does
not answer, and send the questions along to us. We
are anxious to get a chance to answer any questions
in respect to Newstead Homes.
You will talk about Newstead Homes to some
people, and'probably find them antagonistic. Be sure
that what they may say against our policy is said in
self-interest. They may have their “own axe to
grind.” Take notes of all their arguments, put them
down, if necessary, and then ask us to answer all
their questions. We will not leave a stone unturned
until you are as sure as we are that the one and only
way to build to-day is to
Time—Save Unnecessary Expense.
