XV. ? Journal of an Expedition to explore the country from
West Australia to Port Eucla, and thence to Adelaide , South
Australia. By John Forrest, Government Surveyor.
[Abridged.]
Everything being in readiness, and having given the master
of the Adur instructions to leave on the 6th of April (1870), and
sail to Esperance Bay, there to await my arrival, our party left
Perth, accompanied, for a short distance on our march, by his
Excellency the Governor and aide-de-camp, together with
several other friends. We had 15 horses, and provisions suffi-
cient to take us to Esperance Bay.
On April sth we reached Kojonup, and stated for Jerramungup-
on the 9th, reaching it on the 13th, our route being via Martinup,
Koorarkup, &c. We were very short of water on this part of
our journey. On April 14th we left Jerramungup, steering a.
little to the north of east, over scrubby undulating sand plains,
for about 16 miles. Camped on a small branch of the Fitz-
gerald River, at water, on some granite rocks called ? Dwertup
very little feed for our horses.
April 1 5th. ?We travelled to the north of east, and at 7 miles
crossed the main branch of the Fitzgerald River: granite rocks-
in bed, and salt-water pools. After travelling over stony undu-
lating country for 21 miles, camped on a small patch of feed,,
with water in some granite rocks, called ? Coombedup.? Next
day, continuing easterly over rough stony country, crossing
several brooks with salt pools of water in them, we reached the
Phillips River, and, after a great deal of searching, found some
fresh water in a small brook near the river. The immense-
pools in the Phillips were as salt as the sea. Distance travelled,,
about 25 miles.
On April 17th, Sunday, I went, in company with McLarty, to
the summit of a high hill in Eyre?s Range, called ?Annie?s
Peak,? which we reached after 1� hour?s hard climbing. It is
the steepest hill I ever attempted to ascend. We had a splendid,
view of the sea, the first since leaving Perth; and I also obtained
a fine round of angles and bearings. In the evening it almost
suddenly came on to thunder and lightning, and soon rained
in torrents; and as we were rather unprepared, we did not pass-
a very pleasant night.
April \&th. ?Just as we had collected the horses it com-
menced to rain in torrents; we, however, got under way by
9 o?clock, and steered in about an easterly direction over sandy


scrubby country, and at 10 miles crossed a brook with salt pools
in it, and, continuing, reached a large river of salt-water, which
we followed about 2 miles, and camped near it at a spring called
? Jerdacuttup.? It rained in torrents the whole day, blowing
hard from the southward; we were all drenched when we halted.
On April 19th, after travelling about 23 miles in an easterly
direction, we reached a salt lake called Parriup, and camped.
Procured water on some granite rocks near camp. On April
20th we reached Mr. Campbell Taylor?s station on the Oldfield
River, and rested for the remainder of the day.
April 21 st. ?After starting the party, with instructions to
reach and camp on north side of Stokes? Inlet, distant about 20
miles, I went with Mr. Taylor to the mouth of the Oldfield
River, in order to take bearings to East Mount Barren, Ac., but
was disappointed, the weather being very hazy. Accompanied
by a native of Mr. Taylor?s, followed on the tracks, but night
setting in, we made the best of our way to where I expected to
find the party, but could see nothing of them, and were obliged
to camp for the night without food, and, what was worse, without
a fire, having neither matches nor powder with me. Luckily I
had my rug, by which means I fared much better than my
?companion, who had only a small kangaroo skin. It blew and
rained in torrents most of the night, and our position can be
better imagined than described.
Early on the morning of the 22nd we were looking for the
tracks of the party, but without success; finally we returned
-8 miles to the Margaret River, and, after a long search,
found the tracks, almost obliterated by the rain, and followed
along them. Upon nearing Stokes? Inlet we met Tommy
Windich looking for us, he having seen oar tracks and last
night?s bivouac. He informed me that they had camped about
4 miles westward of the Inlet, and we had therefore passed them
in the dark last night. Made all haste to overtake the party,
and managed to do so, after a great deal of trouble, hour
after dark. Encamped on north side of Barker?s Inlet, at a
small well of water called Booeynup. We did justice to our
supper, as I had not had anything to eat for 32 hours.
April 23rd. ?For the first 9 miles over scrubby sand plains,
kangaroos very numerous, when we came into and skirted a
chain of salt lakes and marshes, and continuing over generally
low country, well grassed, for 5 miles, we reached and camped
at the old homestead of the Messrs. Dempster, called ? Main-
benup.?
It was not till April 29th that the Adur arrived. They
had had very heavy weather, but everything was dry and


safe. We landed stores, &c., required for immediate use, tlie
next day.
On May 9th, after collecting the horses, we saddled np and
started en route for Israelite Bay, whither I had instructed the
master of the Adur to meet ns. Bidding good-bye to our kind
friends at Esperance Bay, we travelled along the north shore
for about 11 miles, when we left the coast and steered towards
Mount Merivale, and camped at a spring on south-east corner
of a salt lake, Mount Merivale bearing n. 60� e. mag., French-
man?s Peak n. 150� e. mag., and Eemarkable Island n. 196� e.
mag. The country for the last few miles was beautifully grassed,
with numerous brackish streams running through it. Com-
menced keeping watch this evening, two hours each, from
8 o?clock p.m. to 6 o?clock a.m. Marked a tree with the letter F.
at our bivouac.
Next day we travelled nearly due east for 24 miles, through
scrubby sandy country without timber. Eemarkable bare
granite hills were seen in every direction. Camped at a spring
on south-east side of granite hills, resembling a saddle. Passed
Mount Hawes, leaving it a little to the north. On May lltb,
the horses having strayed back on the tracks last night, we
were delayed till 10 o?clock, when only eight of them were
brought in. Sent Tommy in search of the remainder, and after
waiting until 3 o?clock for his return, sent on my brother, Osborn,
and Billy with 7 horses and loads, with instructions to camp at
the first place where there was feed and water, there being no
feed at this camp. McLarty and myself waited until Tommy
returned, which he did at sundown, having had to go back 24
miles to our bivouac of the 9th for them. There being scarcely
any feed here, and as it was too late to follow after the party,
we tied up our horses for the night. We packed up next
morning and followed on the tracks of the party, and at 10
miles found them camped on a branch of a creek which runs
into ?Duke of Orleans Bay;? brackish streams plentiful.
Scrubby sandy country.
May 13 th* ?Travelled in an easterly direction towards Cape
Arid, passing at 5 miles a large creek, and at 10 miles encamped
on a running brackish stream, which I named the Alexander.
Scrubby open country most of the way. Shot a few ducks
from the thousands that are in these rivers. Continuing, next
day, a little to the south of east for 10 miles, crossed a large
brook, and at 14 miles reached another creek, which we followed
up a mile, and encamped on east side of a large salt-lagoon, into
which the brook empties. Splendid green feed around camp,
but no water; went with Billy to look for some, and after going


mile east, struck the Thomas Eiver, where we met two
natives, quietly disposed, who showed us the water, and, after
filling our canteens, returned with us to camp.
May 15th, Sunday. ?Shifted camp over to the Thomas River,
1� mile, where there was plenty of water; rained a little
during the day. Grassy piece of country round camp, the first
good feeding-land seen since leaving Mount Merivale. Next
day we got an early start and steered nearly east, accompanied
by the two natives, over scrubby sand-plains for about 21 miles.
We camped near the sea, a few miles to the westward of Cape
Pasley. Filled our canteens about 2 miles back from where
we camped.
May 11th. ? Steering in an e.n.e. direction for about 19 miles,
we camped near Point Malcolm, Mount Ragged bearing n. 327 01
e. mag., and Point Dempster (Israelite Bay) n. 35� 15' e. mag,
Hope to reach Israelite Bay to-morrow, as it is only 16 miles
distant. There was no water at Point Malcolm, but luckily we
had filled our canteens. The wind was strong from the west-
ward, accompanied with light showers all day. Tommy shot a
kangaroo this evening, and the two natives who were travelling
with us from the Thomas River did ample justice to it, literally
eating the whole night. After starting the party next morn-
ing, we went in advance with Billy to prepare the camp at
Israelite Bay, &c. When we reached it were delighted to find
the Adur lying safely at anchor, and proceeding on board, found
all well. Procured abundance of water by digging 1 foot deep
in the sand-hills, and good feed a short distance from camp.
We were soon joined by the party, all of whom were overjoyed
at meeting the boat safely. We were two days behind our
time, and the boatmen were beginning to feel anxious, not being
acquainted with the many delays that may take place on a land
journey.
We landed a few of the stores, barley, &c., and pitched a large
canvas tent, as I intended staying here eight or ten days to re-
cruit our horses, which, owing to scarcity of feed, I may say since
leaving Kojonup, were in rather low condition, and a few gave
signs of knocking up; I therefore concluded, as this was the
last place we would meet the boat until we reached Eucla, to
give them as much rest as possible, there being fine feed near-
camp. We found the coast to be in many places out of position,
as shown on the Admiralty charts.
On May 30th, after bidding good-bye to the crew of the
Adur and to the two natives who have accompanied us from the
Thomas River, but who were now at the end of their country
and afraid to come, any further with us, we left Israelite Bay


en route for Eucla, and steered in a northerly direction for about
15 miles oyer salt-marshes and claypans, with dense thickets
intervening, destitute of grass, when I was obliged to make for
the coast, and following it for about 8 miles, we camped close
to it, without water or feed, and tied up our horses in latitude
33� 17' 17" by meridian altitude of Arcturus, a Bootis, &c.
Next day we saddled up at dawn and continued along the
beach for 4 miles; came to a large sand-patch, and found
abundance of water by digging 1 foot deep in the hollows.
Camped on each side of the sand-hills, with first-rate feed for our
horses.
June Is/.?After starting the party, went with Tommy Win-
dich to examine the country to the north-west, and, after tra-
velling 9 miles over salt-marshes and samphire-flats, with dense
scrub intervening, we reached what is called on the Admiralty
charts ? The Front Bank,? which we ascended, and found it very
steep and rough. On gaining the summit, we found the country
receded to the north, level and thickly wooded, as far as the
eye could reach. We travelled about 4 miles to the north-
west, from whence we ascended the range, and then climbed a
tree to have a view of the country, which I found very level
and thickly wooded with Mallee, &c. I therefore determined
to turn east, and, if possible, reach the party to-night. Turn-
ing easterly, we reached the sea and followed the tracks of the
party, coming up with them at about 10 p.m., encamped on
north-east side of an immense sand patch, about 25 miles from
our last night?s bivouac. There was abundance of water on the
surface, in the hollows of the sandhills. There being no feed
near camp, we saddled up next morning and continued towards
Point Culver for 4 miles and camped, with only some coarse
grass growing on the white sand-hills for our very hungry horses.
Found plenty of water by digging. This was a poor place for
our horses; and next morning we started with my brother and
Billy to examine the country to the north-east, and travelled in
about a north-easterly direction for 25 miles over very level
country, but in many places most beautifully grassed. We
camped on a splendid flat, without water.
June 4 th. ?Started at dawn and travelled in a southerly
direction for 9 miles, when we found a rock water-hole contain-
ing 1 gallon, and had breakfast. Continuing for 4 miles, we
reached the sea-cliffs, which fell perpendicularly into the sea,
and although grand in the extreme, were terrible to gaze upon.
After looking very cautiously over the precipice, we all ran
back quite terror-stricken by the dreadful view. Turning our
course westward along the cliffs, we reached camp at 5 o?clock,


and found all well. We saw several natives? tracks during
the day. &
We now made preparations for starting on Tuesday morning
and attempting to reach the water shown on Mr. Eyre?s track,
in longitude 126� 24' E., 150 miles distant; by carrying thirty
gallons of water with us and walking in turns, so as to have the
horses to carry the water. I intended allowing each man one
quart and each horse two quarts per day, and felt very anxious
as to the result, as it would take five or six days; but it was the
only resource left. I was much relieved by the sanguine way in
which the party acquiesced in my plans, and the very apparent
confidence they placed in me.
June 7th? Started at 9 a.m., carrying over 30 gallons of
water with us (one of the drums leaked so much that we left it
at camp), and travelled along our outward tracks of the 4th and
camped at our former bivouac, with splendid feed, but no water
for our horses. Next morning we started early, and steered
about north-east through dense Mallee thickets, destitute of
grass or water, for 18 miles. We came upon a small patch
of open grassy land, and camped without water for our horses.
This is the second night our horses have been without water,
the grass has been fresh, and they do not appear to have
suffered much yet. Marked a tree at camp, � F., 1870.?
Made an early start next morning, steering north-east, and at
1 mile found a rocky water-hole containing 15 gallons, which
we gave our very thirsty horses, and continuing, chiefly through
dense Mallee, &c., thickets, with a few grassy flats intervening,
for 22 miles, found another rock water-hole holding about
10 gallons, which we also gave the horses, and, after travelling
1 mile from it, camped on a large grassy flat, without water
for our horses. Our horses were very thirsty, and had yet
70 miles to go before reaching the water, in longitude 126�
24' East.
feteering e.n.e. next day over generally open country, grassy
flats, &c., thinly wooded, for 21 miles, found a small rock water-
hole containing 3 gallons, which we put into our canteens, and,
after travelling 3 miles further, camped on the edge of a grassy
flat, and gave our horses each from our canteens.
Our horses were fearfully distressed in the evening. For the
last 96 hours they have only had 2 gallons each.
June 1 1th. ?Found, on collecting the horses, that 4 were
missing. Those found were in a sad state for want of water,
and there was not a moment to lose. I therefore at once sent
Tommy to look for those missing, and, after saddling up, sent
the party on with my brother, with instructions to steer easterly


for nearly 50 miles, when they would reach the water in
longitude 126� 24' East. I remained behind to await Tommy?s
return, and, after an hour?s awful anxiety, was rejoiced to see
him returning with the ramblers. We lost no time in following'
after the party, and at 2 miles came to a water-hole they had
emptied and given to the horses (15 gallons), and at 5 miles
overtook them. After travelling 10 miles, found in another
water-hole 15 gallons, which we also gave our horses, which
were still very thirsty. At 14 miles found a water-hole holding
3 gallons, which we transferred to our canteens ; and at 15 miles
camped on a small, but very grassy, flat, close to which we
found a water-hole of 10 gallons, which I intend giving the
horses to-morrow morning. Although the horses are still very
thirsty they are much relieved, and are willing to feed.
On June 12th we struck a little to the south of east over
generally grassy country, slightly undulating for 3 miles, and
found a large water-hole with about 100 gallons of water in it.
It being Sunday, and men and horses very tired, I halted for
the day, as there was most luxuriant feed round camp. Our
horses soon finished the water, and looked much better after it.
Although without water, we are now in comparative safety, as
our horses have had nearly sufficient, and we are only 32 miles
from the water shown on Mr. Eyre?s chart.
June 13th. ?Made an early start, and steered a little to
the south of east, making straight for the water, in longitude
126� 24' e. At 18 miles got a view of the sea, and beheld the
sand-hills about 15 miles ahead. Here we saw some natives?
fires close to us. Approaching them, we came upon an old
woman, and my brother and Tommy soon brought a man to
bay. There were about twenty round us; they appeared very
frightened. After detaining them half an hour, and treating
them as kindly as possible, we bade them farewell and con-
tinued our journey. They were entirely naked. After leaving
the natives, we came to where the cliffs recede from the coast, in
longitude 126� 12' e. To the westward, those grand precipitous
cliffs, from 200 to 300 feet high, and Point Dover, near which
Mr. Eyre?s overseer was murdered, we could clearly see; and,
while thinking over his hardships and miseries, we turned our
faces eastward, where we could see, within a few miles, the
water we so much needed. We soon descended the cliffs to
the sea-shore, which we followed for about 12 miles, and
reached the first sand-patch at about 10 o?clock p.m. There
was good feed round the sand-patch, but we could not find any
water in the dark. Gave our horses all we had with us, viz.,
about 15 gallons.


June I'lth. ?This morning searched the sand-patches for
water without success; I therefore packed up and proceeded
towards another large patch, 4 miles distant, going in advance
with Billy. After we left, Tommy found a place where water
?could be procured by digging, and used by the natives; he,
however, followed after Billy and myself. On reaching the
sand-patch we found a place where we obtained water by
digging; we also found sufficient to satisfy our horses, on some
sandstone flats. We were soon joined by the remainder of
the party, who were overjoyed to be in perfect safety once
more, and we were all thankful to that Providence which had
guarded us over 150 miles without our finding permanent
water. We soon pitched camp and took the horses to the
feed, which was excellent. Beturning, we were surprised to
see a vessel standing in for the shore, and soon made her out to
be the Adur. Although the wind was favourable for Eucla,
she still made in for the land until within 3 miles, when she
turned eastward, and, although we lit fires, &c., was soon out
of sight. I afterwards ascertained that they were not sure of
their longitude, having no chronometer on board, and there-
fore wished to see some landmark.
We dug two wells next day, and found good water at 7 feet
from the surface. Lined them with stakes and bushes, to keep
them from filling in. In the afternoon we all amused ourselves
by shooting wattle birds, and managed to kill fifteen. On the
16th we dug another well and bushed it up, as the supply from
the two dug yesterday was not sufficient, and obtained a plentiful
?supply of splendid fresh water. By a number of observations,
camp is in latitude 32� 14' 50" South, and longitude 126� 24'
East, the variation of compass being about 1� 6' easterly. The
horses are improving very quickly, there being splendid feed
round the sand-patches.
June 17th. ?Went with Tommy Windich for a walk eastward
along the beach, and returned a little inland. Passed over
some patches of beautiful grassed country, and saw a pine-pole
standing on one of the hummocks near the beach, probably
erected by Mr. Eyre, as I am not aware of any one else having
been here. We could not find any of his camps, however, as no
doubt the sand had long since covered them over.
June 20th. ?Started this morning, in company with McLarty
.and Tommy Windich, to explore the country to the northward.
The first 12 miles north was through dense thickets and sandy
hills, when we reached the cliffs, which we ascended with diffi-
culty; and steering about n.n.e. for 3 miles, through dense
Mallee thickets, we emerged into a generally grassy country, with


beautifully grassed downs. We camped at a rock water-hole of
15 gallons, about 25 miles from main camp.
Steering about north for one mile next day, we found a rock
water-hole holding about 30 gallonsand continuing for 13
miles over grassy plains, thinly wooded, the country became
very clear and open, and at 25 miles there was nothing in
view but gently undulating plains of grass and salt-bush. Far
as the eye could reach to the north-west, north, and north-east,
this clear grassy country extended; and being now 50 miles
from camp, the prospect of finding water diminishing as we
travelled northward, I determined to return, and accordingly
struck south-west, and after travelling 12 miles found a small
water-hole of 3 gallons, and camped for the night.
Saddled up at dawn next morning, and steering southerly
over clear open grassy plains for 28 miles, we reached the cliffs,
and rested an hour; after which we continued our journey, and
reached camp a little after dark, finding all well.
June 24ith. ?Started at 8.30 a.m., en route for Eucla. Steering
in a n.n.e. direction for 15 miles, reached the cliffs, and after
following along them 2 miles, found a large rock water-
hole, but almost inaccessible. While I was examining the
cliffs near, to find a place where we could get the horses up,
Tommy heard a coo-ey, and after answering it a good many
times, we were surprised to see two natives walking up towards
us, unarmed. I approached and met them; they did not
appear very frightened, and at once began to eat the damper
I gave them. We could not understand anything they said. I
beckoned them to come with us, which they at once did, and
followed so closely after me as to tramp on my spurs. They
pointed to water further ahead. After walking behind me
about a mile, we saw four more running after us, who on joining
us made a great noise, singing and appearing very pleased.
Shortly afterwards two more joined us, making eight in all. They
were all entirely naked, and circumcised. We found the water
alluded to, on the top of the cliffs, and as it was too late to attempt
to get the horses up, we turned off to the southward half a mile,
and camped on a small grassy flat, without water for the horses.
'The eight natives slept at our fire. We gave them as much
damper as they could eat. They had not the least particle of
clothing, and made pillows of each other?s bodies, resembling
pigs more than human beings.
Travelling in an e.n.e. direction on the 25th for 21 miles, over
rich grassy table-land plains, thinly wooded, we camped on a
very grassy spot, without water for our horses.
June 21th. ?Made rather a late start, owing to some of the
yol. xli, 2 B


horses straying. Steered in an e.n.e, direction, and at 10 miles
found a small water-hole, and at 21 miles another, the contents
of which we gave our horses, and at 2d miles camped on a grassy
spot, without water for our horses. For the first 15 miles
grassy, gently-undulating, splendid-feeding country, extended
in every direction, after which there was a slight falling off;
scrubby at intervals.
We made a late start next day, steering in about an e.n.e.
direction for the first 5 miles, over very grassy flats, &c., when it
became more dense and scrubby until 20 miles, after which
it improved a little, and at 24 miles we camped on a grassy
rise, without water, in lat. 31� 41' s.,and long. 127� 40' e. Our
horses appeared distressed for want of water, the day being
very warm.
June 2 2th. ?During the day we found water in small rock-
holes sufficient to give each horse about 3 gallons. The country
was generally very grassy, although in some places rather
thickly wooded. Steering next day in an easterly direction
over generally grassy country, with occasional Mallee thickets,
for about 22 miles, we came to a splendidly grassed rise, and
found a fine rock w r ater-hole on it, containing about 100 gallons,
which our horses soon finished, being fearfully in want, as the
day was very warm.
Juhj Ist. ?Travelling about east, over most beautifully grassed
country, at 5 miles we found a large water-hole, holding 100
gallons; but our horses were not thirsty, and did not drink
much. This is the first rock w?ater-hole we have passed without
finishing, since w r e left Point Culver. At 10 miles we reached
the cliffs, or Hampton Range, and had a splendid view of the
Roe Plains, Wilson?s Bluff looming in the distance. Descending
the cliffs with difficulty, we followed along the foot of them,
which was beautifully grassed, and after travelling 12 miles,
beheld the Eucla sand-hills. I never before remember wit-
nessing such joy as was evinced on this occasion by all my
party. After proceeding 5 miles further we camped close to the
cliffs, at a small water-hole.
We were now again in safety, Eucla being only 7 miles dis-
tant, after having travelled 160 * miles without finding per-
manent ?in fact, over 300 miles, with only one place
where it was obtainable, viz., in long. 126� 24' e. ; and I
trust we all recognised with sincerity and thankfulness the
guiding and protecting Hand which had brought us through
in safety.
July 2nd. ?Started early and steered straight for the an-
chorage, distant about 5 miles, haring first ascended the Range,


to obtain a view of the country, which was very extensive. Far
ns the eye could reach to the westward, the Roe Plains and
Hampton Range were visible; while to the eastward, lay Wilson?s
Fluff and the Delisser sand-hills ; and 3 miles west of them we
were delighted to behold the good schooner Adur, riding safely
at anchor in Eucla Harbour, which formed by no means the
least pleasing feature of the scene to onr little band of weary
travellers.
On the 15th we resumed our march at daylight, and travelled
ie.n.e. for 7 miles, when we bore east over generally level
country, well grassed, but entirely destitute of water. AA e
?camped at sundown on a grassy rise, without water for our
horses. Distance travelled, 31 miles. Our horses have not
had any water for two days, and begin to appear distressed.
Next day, at 4.50 a.m. got under way, steering a little to the
:south of east, in order to make the cliffs, as there might be
water in rock-holes near them. At 18 miles came to the sea,
but could find no water. At 30 miles saw a pile of stones, and
?at 33 miles saw a staked survey line. Camped on a grassy
piece of country, 2 miles from the sea. This is the third day
without a drop of water for our horses, which are in a frightful
state. Cave them each 4 quarts from our water-drums, and
hoped by leaving a little after midnight, to reach the Head of
the Bight next evening.
July YUh. ?Was obliged to get up twice to bring back the
horses, and at 4 o?clock made a start, the horses being in a
very exhausted state. Some had a difficulty in keeping up.
About noon I could descry the land turning to the southward,
and saw, with great pleasure, we were fast approaching
the Head of the Great Australian Bight. Reached the sand-
patches at the extreme Head 'of the Bight just as the sun was
setting, and found abundance of water by digging 2 feet deep
in the sand.
Gave the horses as much as I considered was safe for them
to have at one time. I have never seen horses in such
a state before, and I hope never to again. The horses which
four days ago seemed strong and in good condition, now ap-
peared but skeletons, eyes sunk, nostrils dilated, and thoroughly
exhausted. Since leaving Bucla to getting water at this
spot, a period of nearly ninety hours, our horses had only
had one gallon of water each, which we gave them from our
water-drums. It is wonderful how w'ell they performed this
journey; had they not been in excellent condition, they
never could have done it. We all felt very tired, as for sixty
hours I had only about five hours sleep, being continually in
J 2 b 2


a state of great anxiety; besides all having to walk a great
deal.
We reached Fowler?s Bay on the 28th of July, and Adelaide-
on the 27th of August.
I have attempted to give a faithful and correct account of
our proceedings ; and, in conclusion, beg to make a few remarks
respecting the character and the capabilities of the country
travelled over. In about long. 124� e. the granite formation
ends, at least on and near the coast; and from long. 124� to the
Head of the Bight, a distance of over 400 miles, there is no-
change in the formation, being limestone and high table-laud
the whole distance.
The portion most suited for settlement is, I believe, between
long. 126� 12' e., and long. 129� e., near Eucla Harbour, or, in
other words, the country to the north of the Hampton Range,
that district being most beautifully grassed, and, I believe,
abundance of water could be procured anywhere under the Range,
by sinking 20 or 30 feet. There is also under the Hampton
Range a narrow strip of fine grassy country, for the whole length
of the range, viz., about 160 miles. I have every confidence
that, should this country be settled, it would prove a remune-
rative speculation, and if water can be procured on the table-
land, would be the finest pastoral district of Western Australia.
Before I conclude, I have the pleasing duty to record my
entire appreciation of every member of the Expedition. 1
need not particularise them ; one and all had the interest and
welfare of the Expedition at heart, and on no occasion uttered
a single murmur.
Finally, my best and most sincere thanks are due to his Ex-
cellency Governor Weld, for the very efficient manner in which
the Expedition was equipped; and it is chiefly owing to the
great zeal and desire of his Excellency that I should have
everything required that the success of the enterprise is
attributable.
