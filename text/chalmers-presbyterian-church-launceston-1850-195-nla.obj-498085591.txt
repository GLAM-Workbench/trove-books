CENTENARY CELEBRATION


"When your children ask their
fathers in time to come, saying,
what mean ye by these stones ?
Then ye shall answer them, the
waters of Jordan were cut off before
the ark of the covenant of the
Lord when it passed over Jordan
. . and these stones shall be for a
memorial unto the children of Israel
for ever.”
Joshua 4 : 6, 7.
"When we build, let it be such
a work as our descendants will
thank us for; and let us think as
we lay stone up stone, that a time
is to come when those stones will
be held sacred because our hands
have touched them, and that men
will say as they look upon them —
See! this our fathers did for us.”
—John Ruskin.

Carly History
'Tfif N the "Launceston Examiner" of January 14, 1848, appeared an advertisement announcing that its
jl members "have engaged the large room in Mr. Bell's auction mart for the purposes of the Free Church
Association. A Sabbath school will be held there on and after next Sunday and Divine service performed as
often as a minister can be procured. It is contemplated to purchase a piece of ground and erect a suitable
building in anticipation of the arrival of a Minister of the Free Church of Scotland".
The Rev. John Zeigler Huie, Minister of the Free Church Congregation of Geelong, Port Philip, was
further advertised to conduct Divine Service on the same date at 1 1 a.m, and 6 p.m. "Comfortable sittings
are provided in Mr. Bell's room for about 300" runs the announcement, "the entrance is from St. John Street
and a collection will be made in aid of the F.C. Association".
On Tuesday, the 17th, Mr. Huie was invited to a tea meeting when from 150 to 200 persons of various
denominations were present and "Mr. Dean, to whom the catering was entrusted did ample justice to the
numerous company. The Rev. J. West occupied the Chair and delivered an address ; and the Revs. J. Z.
Huie, C. S. Y. Price and Butters and other gentlemen also spoke".
In the meetings thus adve r tised we touch the sources of our present Chalmers Church with its three
young and vigorous offspring congregations at Sandhill,lnvermay, and Newstead.
Success seems to have smiled on these earty efforts for on December 7, 1850, news arrived in Laun-
ceston that on Thursday, July 1 1 of that same year the Rev. James Lindsay had been ordained by the
Presbytery of Dundee with the view of proceeding to Launceston, Van Diemen's Land, and that he and the
Rev. Wm. Nicolson of London Wall Church, London, and subsequently of Chalmers, Hobart, had sailed for
the scene of their labours. Just 14 days later, December 21, 1850, Mr. Lindsay's arrival in the good ship
"Halcyon" is chronicled, together with the intimation that he would preach next day, morning and evening,
in the Free Church Schoolroom, by which more euphonious title Bell's room had now become known.


INTERIOR OF CHURCH.


After three years tenancy of Mr. Bell's room a change of quarters took place, and on the first Sabbath
of 1851 the congregation moved into the Wycliffe Chapel, still standing in York Street, and there, and in
the Temperance Hall, we find them "and the Minister for whom they had been anxiously waiting" till that
great day on January 15, 1860, when Chalmers Church, as we know it, was opened for Divine Service.
In January, 1856 —how this month of January recurs throughout these first twelve years, each date a
gateway to wider fields —a design for a Church was submitted to the Managers by Wm. Henry Clayton, Esq.,
an architect of this city. "On revision it was found that inadequate accommodation had been provided in
consequence of the site being too small for a building on an extended scale" and in 1859 the present site
was purchased at a cost of £6OO.
On Wednesday, January 19, 1859, at 3 p.m., public worship was conducted in the Baptist Chapel,
York Street. The Rev. J. Downs, Moderator of the Free Church Presbytery, preached on a text from Ist
Cor. 3 : 11, "For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ".
After the service the Committee and the Moderator, and members of Presbytery proceeded to the corner
of St. John's, now Prince's Square. The Sabbath scholars followed, carrying blue flags on which were in-
scribed : "For Christ's Crown and Covenant, 1639", and "Free Church Sunday School, opened January, 1848".
On arrival at the site a large assemblage was found already collected, amongst whom were the Mayor
(Hon. W. S. Button), Aldermen Fawns and Clayton, the Revs. W. Law, W. R. Wade and other representatives
of the town and neighbourhood.
The Moderator first gave out a portion of Psalm CXVIII :
"This is the doing of the Lord,
And wondrous in our eyes,
That stone is made head corner stone,
Which builders did despise."


MEMBERS OF SESSION AND BOARD OF MANAGEMENT.


Following the psalm, the Rev. L. Campbell offered up prayer. The Rev. J. Lindsay then proceeded to lay
the stone, which is a massive block of freestone weighing about a ton and a half. Having deposited in a
prepared cavity, a bottle, hermetically sealed, containing—
The Model Deed of the Church,
The Free Church Protest of 1843,
The Testimony of the Free Church Association of Launceston of 1848,
The Declaration of the Free Church Presbytery of Tasmania, 1853,
Royal Kalendar, 1859,
The local newspapers.
Current coin and written parchment,
the stone was lowered, and adjusted into its place, and the customary ceremonial of the mallet having been
performed, Mr. Lindsay took his place upon the stone, and pronounced it laid in these words :
"I thank God the foundation stone of Chalmers Free Church, Launceston, is now laid."
From a copy of the parchment we learn ;
The entire cost of the Church and the Manse was over £6,000.
The Building Committee upon which the responsibility for the work chiefly rested comprised Messrs.
T. Corbett, A. Duthie, S. Fox, A. McNaughton, D. McQueen, J. McLeod, J. Scott, R. Torrance
and T. T. Watt.
The Office-bearers of the Congregation were: Thomas Corbett, Elder; R. Torrance and A. Duthie,
Deacons.
The number of communicants at that date was 126.
At 7 o'clock the same evening 280 persons sat down to tea. At the public meeting which followed,
the following gentlemen occupied the platform : Revs. J. Lindsay, S. C. Y. Price, J. Downs, L. Campbell, W.
R. Wade (Baptist) and W. Law (Congregational), and Messrs. Corbett (Elder), S. Fox, J. Scott and W. H.
Clayton.


CHALMERS HALL.


All through that year (1859) many thoughts and prayers would doubtless focus themselves round that
beautiful Gothic building, slowing rising into symmetry and completeness, until at last it stood ready for that
dedicating service which proclaimed it to all men as a "House of God" builded by Free Churchmen to His
Glory and for the heralding of the Evangel of His Son Jesus Christ.
The Church was opened for public worship on Sunday, January 15, 1860. The service in the morning
was conducted by the Rev. Wm. Nicolson, of Chalmers Free Church, Hobart Town.
In the afternoon the service was taken by the Rev. W. Law of Christ Church.
In the evening the Minister of the Church, the Rev. J. Lindsay occupied the pulpit. His sermon was
based on the text : "Behold the man whose name is the branch, and he shall grow up out of his place ; and
he shall build the temple of the Lord, even he shall build the temple of the Lord, and he shall bear the glory".
On Tuesday, 17th, followed the inevitable tea meeting, held in the school-room.
In returning thanks to the various speakers and vocalists, Mr. Lindsay said that he trusted that within
the Church which had just been completed, nothing would ever be known but "Jesus Christ and Him
Crucified".
With the Benediction, closed the inaugural celebrations attendant on the erection of Chalmers Church,
Launceston.


SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS.


CHALMERS SUNDAY SCHOOL
Unfortunately much data of the early days of the Sunday School is not available, but looking through some
copies of 'The Record" early in this century one finds recorded the following appointments : Superintendent, Mr.
D. Storrer ; Treasurer, Mr. G. C. McKinlay ; Secretary, Mr. R. W. Benefield. Since those early years the work
has been carried on by devoted men and women, sometimes in the face of difficulties and disappointment,
but always with the desire to prepare the children to take their place in the work of Chalmers Church, and
all that it represents. I
The present Superintendent (Mr. T. K. Jebb) and the teachers associated with him are doing splendid
work with the children.
In the new era upon which the Church is entering, parents are urged to give still greater co-operation
to the Superintendent and teachers. Those early years of child life are tremendously important. To neglect
them is more than a matter for regret —it is a tragedy.
For many years Sunday School was conducted in the hall underneath the present church. The conditions
there were never entirely satisfactory, and it was an occasion for great satisfaction when the new hall in
St. John Street was built. The foundatione stone was laid on December 22, 1927, by Mr. David Storrer,
and the hall was dedicated on Sunday, April 29, 1928.


MEMBERS OF P.W.M.U., LADIES’ GUILD & SCOTTISH MOTHERS’ UNION.


WOMEN'S ORGANISATIONS
As a general statement it may be said that the Christian Church owes its very life to its women. This
is probably just as true of Chalmers as of all other Churches. The history of the past century points to
a long and splendid record of work done by Chalmers women. Much of this work has been done with a com-
plete absence of limelight or publicity, but nevertheless with an enthusiasm and persistence undeterred by set-
backs or disappointments.
This splendid record of service presents a definite challenge not only to the men of Chalmers, but of
all other Churches.
These activities include ;
P.W.M.U. Ladies' Guild.
P.G.F. Red Cross.
Scottish Mothers' Union.
OTHER ORGANISATIONS
Under this heading may be mentioned the Presbyterian Brotherhood. The men meet on the second
Sunday in each month. This activity is of comparatively recent growth, but therein lies a magnificent
opportunity for the men of the Church to meet socially, and by combined effort to render real service.
It is confidently anticipated that the Brotherhood will become a real power in Chalmers Church in the new
era upon which we are now entering.
For the girls and boys, Guides, Scouts and Cubs provide a fine training for the new generation. We
are grateful to those young men and women who give freely of their time and talent in this work.


MEMBERS OF CHURCH CHOIR.


THE CHOIR
In the early years of the Church the congregational singing was led by a Precentor. The passing of the
years saw the passing of the Precentor and his tuning-fork, and the introduction of the organ. These "modern''
methods met with stern opposition from some of the old sticklers for the ancient landmarks. "Worshipping
God by machinery" was anathema to these old worthies, and some of them withdrew from the congregation.
Let us pause, however, before we deride such men. The history of Scotland, and the Scottish Church,
shows that we owe much to the "stubbornness" of such men, many of whom went to a martyr's death rather
than compromise on what was to them a matter of conscience.
Towards the end of last century the pipe-organ which is now in use was installed by Messrs. Fincham &
Sons of Melbourne. The Choir Master at that time was Mr. James Storrar. Mr. Storrar was succeeded by
Mr. W. C. Fyshe, who occupied that position for a number of years.
On Mr. Fyshe's removal to Melbourne, Mr. R. M. Evans took up the work and did splendid work till
1919. In that year Mr. J. J. Broomby accepted the position, which he still holds.
The Church has been very fortunate in having had the services of a number of competent organists,
who have rendered great service to the Church.
From 1916 to 1934 a monthly song service was held on the last Sunday evening in each month. These
were largely attended and greatly appreciated. Special music by the Choir was a feature at these services.
Mr. Alf. Weymouth was Choir Secretary from 1919 to 1932. He was succeeded by the present Secre-
tary, Mr, Rex Howard. The Choir, and Church, owes much to these two able men.
Chalmers Choir has a very fine record of successes at the Musical Competitions in the years 1916-1946.
Through these successes the Choir was able to hand substantial amounts of prize money to the Church Treasur-
er from time to time. An electric organ-blower, piano, carpet and seating on Choir platform, as well as sub-
stantial payments towards Church and Manse renovations were among the visible results of the Choir's
ability and enthusiasm.
It is to be hoped that the Centenary celebrations will bring about, among other things, a renewed enthusi-
asm for this important part of the work of the Church.


SANDHILL, INVERMAY AND NEWSTEAD CHURCHES
During the ministry of the Rev. A. R. Osborn (1902-1906) branch churches were established at Sandhill
and Invermay. In the early stages there was some prospect of combined action with St. Andrew's, but this
however, was not realised. The Session of Chalmers Church adhered to the project, and steps were taken
in April, 1903, not only to secure the hall in Russell Street, Invermay, but the services of Mr. L. C. M.
Donaldson as Missionary.
A Finance Committee assisted from Chalmers Church, members personally guaranteeing the necessary
funds for buildings both at Invermay and Sandhill.
The foundation of the new Church at Invermay was laid November 22, 1905. The first Elders elected
were Messrs. Donaldson, Connell and Dixon. The Sunday School at Invermay was opened on April 21,
1906.
After the successful and encouraging beginning at Invermay, attention was given to the Southern suburb,
and the first service at Sandhill was held in the Wilmot Street Hall on January 17, 1904, with an attend-
ance of 19. The first Board of Management comprised Messrs. J. Bowden, S. Bomford, J. Connell and W.
Mace. In May, 1904, it was reported that 25 children were on the roll of the Sunday School.
The foundation stone of the new Church was laid on November 8, 1905, by Mr. Lindsay Tulloch.
The Church was dedicated on January 28, 1906, by Rt. Rev. P. J. Murdoch, Moderator of the Presbyterian
Church of Australia.
The foundation stone of the Newstead Church was laid by Mr. J. L. Craw on October 4, 1941. The
Church was opened on December 20, 1941, by Mrs. A. C. McKen?ie, at a gathering presided over by
Rt. Rev. A. E. Giles, State Moderator..
The first Sunday School was held on February 1, 19 42. The first Church Service after the opening on
February 15, 1942, and the first Communion Service was held on May 31, 1942.
