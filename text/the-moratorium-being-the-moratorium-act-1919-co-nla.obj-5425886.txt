PREFATORY NOTE.
UNDER the War Precautions Act 1914-1918 certain
regulations were issued and known as the " War Precau-
tions (Moratorium) Regulations," and " War Precautions
(Active Service Moratorium) Regulations,' having for
their object the temporary restriction of certain rights
belonging to mortgagees, vendors, and others. Although
peace has arrived, the Federal Legislature has considered
it expedient to extend the operation of these regulations
to conditions which are not yet normally those of peace.
GENERAL.
The present Act, divided into four parts and two
schedules, confers the same jurisdiction on the Courts as
that conferred by the Statutory Rules and the same
restrictions on mortgagees are re-enacted by Reg. 4 of
Schedule 1. Regulation 10 is an important extension of
the restrictions to sale and purchase of land and to leases
which contain an optional or compulsory purchasing
clause, but the vendor's rights are safeguarded by Reg.
10A, provided, of course, that the word " portion " in
sub-section (b) of this regulation means " instalment,"
where the purchase is by instalments, otherwise the
interpretation must be reasonable. To Regulation 11
most of the amendments were directed and addenda made
during 1916-1919. By express contract between the
parties to a mortgage or a sale of land, tho operation of
these regulations may be excluded and a simple method is
laid down whereby a lessor of land with an optional
purchase clause is not unduly exposed to hardship where
the lessee has no intention of exercising the option. On
the other hand, where by legislation enacted in conse-
quence of the war, restrictions are placed on the marketing
of any produce, the producer is entitled to claim the
benefit of the moratorium.
Regulation 13 (1) deals with the due date for repay-
ment, now' extended to February-July, 1920. But
instalments due after the termination of the War, as
declared by proclamation, must be paid as they fall due,


and would not be the subject of an application under
Reg. 14, which gives the Court power to extend " the
date for repayment." A lessee of land with an optional
purchase clause, the last date for exercising the option
being not later than the 31st December, 1919, and the
lease being in force at the commencement of this Act,
may exercise the option any time up to the forme? date'
provided he gives notice before the lease expires that he
intends to exercise it. The Regulation (16) giving this
power limits the operation of Regulation 10, and prevents
that of Regulation 13.
THE SOLDIERS.
Ihe third part of the Act deals with the moratorium
m relation to Members of the A.1.F., and their female
dependents. They will remain in force only so long as no
publication occurs by the Attorney-General of the fact
that the A.I.F. has been substantially demobilised. The
principal secured by mortgages is payable six months
after a member ceased to be a member of the Forces by
reason of death or discharge. Interest at the rate of five
per cent, on the purchase money for land must be paid as
it falls due, and at six per cent.., or less, if so provided in
the case of mortgages. Where a mortgagor avails himself
of the benefit conferred by these regulations, all instalments
are automatically postponed for a period equal to the
period of postponement effected by these regulations on
one or more of the instalments.
Members of the Forces and their female dependents
are protected from distress, or seizure under a bill of sale,
writ of execution, etc., of chattels used in supporting
themselves and families, or of furniture and wearing ap-
apparel to an amount not exceeding £lOO, where the debt
arose from an agreement made prior to the Ist June, 1916,
and the leave of the Court must first be obtained before any
writ or other legal process may issue in respect of a contract
entered into on or prior to the 20th September, 1916, and
not already covered by the regulations of the second
schedule. They are further entitled to continue a tenancy
of a dwellmg-house at a fair rental so long as that be paid,
and this also applies to shops and farms. The Courts are
vested with power to re-open transactions which operate
harshly against members of the forces and their female
dependents and may grant relief of an equitable nature.


Part four of the Act deals with offences against the
Act, but, before any prosecution can take place, the
consent of the Attorney-General must first be obtained.
The Regulations represent " emergency legislation."
They bear the indication of frequent amendment, repeal,
etc., as exigencies demanded, and, considering the disturbed
period of their publication, it is not surprising that the
Regulations are not highly ordered in arrangement, or
harmonious of construction. Doubtless the practitioner
will find it desirable, whenever possible, to exclude the
operation of the Regulations altogether, which in some cases
is possible, e.g., by Regs. 9, 11 (a) of the " General "
Regulations, and c/. Reg. 10 of the "Active Service "
Regulations.

MORATORIUM ACT 1919.
No. 2 of 1919.
An Act to continue in force certain Regulations intituled
the War Precautions (Moratorium) Regulations and
the War Precautions (Active Service Moratorium)
Regulations.
[Assented to 3rd September, 1919.]
WHEREAS during the existence of the war with Germany Preamble,
and for the purpose of the more effectual prosecution of
the war it became and was, in the opinion of the Governor-
General, necessary and expedient to restrict temporarily
certain of the rights possessed by mortgagees, vendors and
others against mortgagors, purchasers and others, some of
whom are or were and some of whom are or were not members
of the Commonwealth Naval or Military Forces, or dependants
of members of those Forces :
And whereas certain Regulations known as the War Pre-
cautions (Moratorium) Regulations and the War Precautions
(Active Service Moratorium) Regulations, having for their
object the temporary restriction of certain of those rights, were
duly made under the War Precautions Act 1914-1916 :
And whereas it is essential, in order to obviate serious
financial - dislocation in the Commonwealth that the removal
of the restrictions imposed by the War Precautions (Mora-
torium) Regulations should operate gradually :
And whereas it is likewise essential, in order to continue for
limited periods the protection afforded to persons who are or
have been members of those Forces, or dependants of members
of those Forces, against the enforcement of rights possessed by
mortgagees, vendors and others, that certain of the War
Precautions (Active Service Moratorium) Regulations should
continue in force until all Expeditionary Forces serving outside
Australia at the commencement of this Act have been sub-
stantially demobilized, and that the remaining Regulations
comprised in the War Precautions (Active Service Moratorium)
Regulations should continue in force so long as there is any


mortgage or agreement for the purchase of land, to which the
Regulations apply :

the Senate, and the House of Representatives of the Common-
wealth of Australia, as follows :

Reg. 10, post.
Bill of Sale and collateral P.N.— Gf. Porter v. Stephenson, 11 N.Z.M.C.R.
84 (N.Z.); Gleeson v. Colello, 9 M.C.R. 178 (N.Z.), and other N.Z. cases under
"Mortgage," in "The Australasian Annual Digests," 1915-18.
In Tiekner v. Taylor, 40 A.L.T. 117, a'Beckett, J., held that a P.N. given
by a third party as security to a vendor of land was not a " mortgage," and
not protected by R. 284. (But where the purchaser himself gave vendor his
P.N. as collateral security, Cussen, J., held it within the protection of R. 284,
and action was dismissed ; Tiekner v. Taylor distinguished : Levick v. Tre-
vascus, 40 A.L.T. 124).
no e t g to a aJpi S y to These Regulations shall not apply to any fluctuating advance
certain * exceeding Two thousand pounds which is made by way of bank
advances? 3 overdraft secured by a mortgage unless the High Court or the
Amended by Supreme Court, upon the application of the mortgagor, determines
1916, no. 324. that having regard to the matters mentioned in sub-regulation (5)
of regulation 4 of these Regulations it is desirable that these Regu-
lations should apply.
Guarantee . . . security for Mortgage. —Appellants guaranteed respondent
bank the repayment by a company of amount advanced by bank on mortgage.
The bank proceeded against guarantors under specially endorsed writ, and
applied for leave to sign judgment under Order XIV., r. 1, of the Rules of
the Victorian Supreme Court, 1916. Held, that the appellants should have
leave to defend, as the question whether the War Precautions (Moratorium)
Regulations, 1916 No. 284, as amended by No. 324, afforded a good defence
to the action was arguable : Clarke v. Union Bank of Australia Ltd., 23 C.L.R.
o. (And see further as to pleading, under the RR. of the Victorian Supreme
Court: Union Bank of Australia Ltd. v. Clarke (No. 2), 1917 V.L.R. 329 ;


38 A.L.T. 193 ; 23 A.L.R. 161 (Vic.). The definition of " Mortgagor" has

(c) of sub-regulation (1) of the regulation, nothing in this paragraph
shall preclude the mortgagee from entering into possession of the

to vacate the mortgaged property, and in the event of the application
being granted by the Court the mortgagee shall vacate the mort-

No. il. by 1917, Provided that the Court shall not grant any application for leave
to commence or continue proceedings for the recovery from a mort-
gagor of any part of the principal sum secured by mortgage, or for
foreclosure, unless the Court is satisfied that, having regard to all

continuance of the mortgage would seriously affect the
security ; or
(b) that the conduct of the mortgagor has, in respect of any

unless and until an application for leave is dealt with by the Court
under this regulation, be by force of these Regulations extended
upon the terms that interest shall continue to be payable at the
close of the same intervals of time as are provided by the mortgage
with respect to the interest thereby secured, or, if no provision is so
made, then quarterly, and at the following rate :
(a) in the case of a mortgage of which the principal sum or un-
paid part does not exceed Two thousand pounds—the rate
provided in the mortgage, or the rate of six per centum

higher than the rate provided in the mortgage or

greater ; and
(ii) in the latter case the Court may, on the application
of the mortgagor, fix a lower rate, not being lower

Due date for Repayment. —-See the Schedule of dates in Reg. 13.
Land Purchases and Leases with Option of Purchase are assimilated to
Mortgages : see Regs. 10 and 16.
Second Mortgagee. —A second mortgagee is not entitled to be heard on an
application by a first mortgagee, under Reg. 284, for leave to realise his
security: Re World's Picture, dec., Co., and Fourth Victoria P. B. Society,
1917 V.L.R. 76 ; 23 A.L.R. 40 ; 38 A.L.T. 140 (Vic.). But cf. In re Hill,
C.A. 63 S.J. 155 (on Eng. Act), and cf. Hill's Appn., 119 L.T. 67 ; 62 S.J. 765.
Bankruptcy . . . Puisne mortgagees . . . Wasting security . . . Costs. —
The Regulations do not cease to apply when the mortgagor is bankrupt. The
Official Assignee and creditors are entitled to protection, and the Court must
consider the rights of puisne encumbrancers. Protection allowed to second
mortgagee by allowing first mortgagee to sell at reserve fixed by Court:
Ex parte Sautelle ; Ex parte Negus, 34 W.N. 74 (N.S.W.). Cf. Phillips v.
Johnson, 17 G.L.R. 310 (N.Z.).
Application by Mortgagee. —The Court will not lay down any general rule as
to the circumstances in which an application by a mortgagee under the
clause will be granted or refused. The Court has an unfettered discretion :
Re Annie Rohs ; Rohs v. Strawhom, 191/ V.L.R. 32 ; 23 A.L.R. 22 ; 38
A.L.T. 117 (Vic.).
Wasting Security, Onus of Proof. —On application for leave by mortgagee
under this clause, the onus of proof is upon the mortgagee to satisfy the Court
that, either by reason of the wasting nature of the security the continuance
of the mortgage would seriousy affect the security, or that the conduct of the
mortgagor has in the respects mentioned in the regulation been such as to
render him undeserving of the benefit or protection of the Regulations, and
unless the Court is so satisfied, it has no discretion to grant the relief asked for :
In re Hynds, 22 C.L.R. 541. Cf. Thomson v. Claridge, 17 G.L.R. 226 (N.Z.)
and Sibthorp v. Tipping, 13 M.C.R. (N.Z.) 140.
Fluctuating advance. —See Reg. 3, ante.
Trade buildings, Costs, &c. —-Costs are in the discretion of the Court, and
will ordinarily follow the rule that in suits for foreclosure or redemption the
mortgagee is entitled to his costs unless guilty of some misconduct. Buildings
and machinery erected for trade purposes, such as flour-milling, &c., are in
themselves of a wasting nature, but it does not necessarily follow, in view of
the particular circumstances of the case as to use, upkeep, etc., that the
security would thereby be seriously affected if the mortgage were continued
for a reasonable period: Worrall v. Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney, 17
S.R. 457 ; 34 W.N. 206 (N.S.W.). Appeal under Reg. 8c dismissed as " in-
competent," 24 C.L.R. 28.
Contract of Sale . . . Leave to Proceed. —Purchaser, which owed instal-
ment of £125, was a proprietary company in business of buying and selling
land on long terms, and of money lending, with assets £340 in current account
and unrealizable assets £12,500, with liabilities of £30,000 due on contracts-
extending over long terms. Though it was unlikely to meet its liabilities
as they fell due, it would be able to do so eventually, and it required the
money at the bank in order to carry on its business. Vendor was a banking
company. Held, that in the circumstances leave to proceed should be granted :
London Bank of Australia Ltd, v. Australian Trusts Proprietary Ltd., 38
A.L.T. 118; 23 A.L.R, 8 (Vic!).


Foreclosure, leave to proceed, etc. —Leave to call up mortgage, foreclose,
etc., refused, as the mortgagee had not satisfied the Court that the existing
circumstances justified the giving of leave to depart from the prima facie
provision of the regulation, viz. : that having regard to the general dislocation
of affairs, directly and indirectly occasioned by the war, it is contrary to
public welfare to permit mortgagees to rigidly enforce their strict rights against
their debtors. The fact that a mortgagee had, before the making of the
Moratorium " regulations, obtained a judgment against the mortgagor for
the amount of principal and interest due, which he may have a right to enforce,
is not a ground for giving leave to proceed : In re Allen, 23 C.L.R. 220.
Cf. In re Jobson, 117 L.T. 786 ; 87 L.J. (Ch.) 251.
Member of the Forces—Leave to Proceed—Female Dependant, etc.— See,
generally, the '"Active Service " Moratorium, and notes to clause 13 thereof.
Costs. —Mortgagee asked mortgagor to consent to exercise of powers
under mortgage. Mortgagor took no notice of the request. Harvey, J.,
allowed costs of application t.o be added to amount secured : Ex parte Shaw,
34 W.N. 74 (N.S.W.). Cf. In re Priest, 1919 (N.Z.) G.L.R. 35.
Fluctuating advance —Pleading. —Defendant (sued by bank for payment
of overdraft) pleaded (inter alia) that if a fluctuating advance, by a bank,
made by way of overdraft and secured by mortgages, is called up by the bank,
it then ceases to be within Reg. 3, and at once becomes a mortgage debt
within Reg. 4. "That seems to be a palpable fallacy . . —( Gordon, J.).
Plea struck out as tricky : Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney v. Worrall and
another, 35 W.N. 5 (N.S.W.), 24 C.L.R. 28.
Mortgagee in possession. —But a mortgagee who entered on or before
20th September, 1916, is in a more favourable position : see Reg. 8.
Agreement to execute Mortgage—Specific performance—Guarantee.—
Cf. Veale and anor. v. Goodwin, 1916 N.Z.L.R. 757 : G.L.R. 563 (N Z ) and

Gleeson v. Colello, 9 M.C.R. 178 (N.Z.) ; and see cases at p. 6, ante.
Equitable Mortgage. —Memorandum of deposit of deed, with bank, held
not a " mortgage," but an equitable charge : London County and Westminster
Bank v. Tompkins, 86 L.J.R.K.B. 1521 ; (1917) Eng. W.N. 228 ; 33 T.L.R.
471. But cf. L. C and IF. Bank Ltd. v. Tompkins, C.A. (1918) IKB 515 •
87 L.J. (K. 8.) 662.
Bankruptcy. —Apparently a notice of suspension of payments will be an
act of bankruptcy, though the debtor be protected by moratorium : cf.
In re Sahler, 84 L.J. K.B. 1275 ; 112 L.T. 133; (1915) H.B.R. 119 ; 59 S.J. 106.
Acceptance of Interest . . . Waiver. —See Watson v. Brown, 1919 N.Z.L.R.
60.
Rescission of Contract. —Suit for, held not within provisions of Mortgages
Extension Act : Hayes v. Ross, 1919 N.Z.L.R. 356.
Sale by Mortgagee. —A mortgagee realised his security by sale, without
obtaining Court's consent (under English emergency legislation). On his
consequent inability to complete sale purchaser sued for and obtained damages:

v. Callan, (1918) 1 I.R. 107.
5. In every action or proceeding by a mortgagee for the recovery Jurisdiction of
of any sum for interest secured by a mortgage, the Court hearing the actions'for
action or proceeding may, if in its discretion and in the circumstances of
of the case it deems it just and expedient, in lieu of giving judgment secured by
for immediate payment, give judgment for payment at a date to be niortaa " e '
fixed, or by instalments payable at such times as the Court in its
discretion determines, and for this purpose the Court shall have
jurisdiction to cause judgment to be entered in such form as it deems
best to give full effect to the intent of these Regulations, and to
•direct the method of enforcement of the judgment.
Date for Repayment. —See the table of dates in Reg. 13, post.
6. Where by the terms of a mortgage payment is provided by a where
series of regular instalments and the rate of interest is not fixed in repayable by
the mortgage or the instalments are expressed to be for principal instalments,
only and interest is stated not to be payable the instalments shall for
the purposes of these Regulations be deemed to include interest at
.such rate as is assessed by the Court.
Interest. —See also Reg. 4 (7), and 13 (5).
7. Where a mortgage for a specific amount provides for the pay-
nl ent of the principal sum on demand, and a demand has not at the demand,
commencement of these Regulations been made, the principal sum Amended
shall for the purpose only of these Regulations be deemed to be
payable immediately after the commencement of these Regulations.
" Notice of Repayment." —See Reg. 15.
Commencement.— The earliest Regulation was apparently No. 284 of 10th
Nov., 1916. (See the saving section 7of this Act.) A schedule of dates for
repayment is given in Reg. 13, by clause (3) of which " demand " mortgages
are repayable by 29th February, 1920.
8. (1) Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding Mortgagees in
regulations, any mortgagee in possession, who entered
into possession on or before the twentieth day of Sep-
tember, 1916, may exercise all his powers under the
mortgage without leave of the Court: Provided that, on the appli-
cation of the mortgagor, the Court may, if in all the circumstances
it thinks it just and equitable so to do, forbid the mortgagee from
exercising any power of sale or of foreclosure, and may otherwise
make such order in the premises as it thinks fit.
(2) The provisions of sub-regulations (2), (3), (4) and (6) of
regulation 4 of these Regulations shall apply to any such application
in like manner as they apply to applications for the leave of the Court
under regulation 4.
This regulation should, however, be considered in conjunction with Reg. 13,
post.

Court shall be in the discretion of the Court. No - 13 -

1917, no. 253. these Regulations shall be final and conclusive and without appeal.
Retrospectivity of Legislation. —Procedure Acts are prima facie retrospective
(cf.Zollner Ltd. v. Municipal Council of Sydney, 17 S.R. 164). But a right of
appeal is not a question of procedure. It is a vested right (c/. A.-G. v. Sillem,
10 H.L.C. 704). In Wor rail v. Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney Ltd., 24
C.L.R. 28, Worrall had applied to the State Court to protect him as a mort-
gagor, relying upon the War Precautions regulations. The Court refused him
relief, and lie appealed to the High Court. After the decision of the State
Court, a new War Precautions regulation was passed prescribing that any
decision of the Court on any matter under the regulations should be final and
conclusive and without appeal. Was Worrall's appeal competent ? Was the
regulation procedural or was his right a vested right ? The High Court held
that if that were the test, the appeal lay. But the real test in the case was
" What did the legislature mean when its words are read, after giving due
weight to every relevant consideration ? " Applying this test, the Court
held that the "necessary intendment of the language is retrospectivity."
The appeal, therefore, was incompetent, although the regulation was passed
after the State Court's decision was given (Weekly Notes Cover, Sept., 1918).

thereon, and fulfilment of the conditions set forth in the agreement.
(3) For the purposes of these Regulations a lease of land
containing a purchasing clause shall be dealt with in all respects as
if the lessee had already notified his exercise of an option to purchase
under an optional purchasing clause, and as if the lessor were mort-
gagee and the lessee were mortgagor of the land, and as if the rent

were principal moneys secured. The term of the lease shall, if
necessary, be extended for the purpose of giving effect to this pro-
vision.

such evidence as he deems necessary that the sale sought to be given
effect to by the transfer does not contravene any provision of these
Regulations and may refuse to register the transfer until such evi-
dence is submitted to him.
Registration. —l. The Registrar-General of New South Wales, in cases
where the consent of purchaser, and certificate of a solicitor (under Clause 9,
ante) are provided, does not require further evidence.
2. In other cases, the Registrar-General, in addition to the ordinary
requirements, requires it to be shown (usually by statutory declaration), that
(a) the mortgagor is not a member of the Forces ; (6) No order of the Court
has been made restricting mortgagee from exercising power of sale. Where
sale was made subsequently to 20th September, 1916 (Reg. 8), evidence is
also required that mortgagee was in possession prior to that date and had con-
tinued in possession up to the date of sale. But if the sale were made before
20th September, 1916, though later than the " Soldier " Moratorium, evidence
is required that mortgagor is not a member of the Forces, or female dependant.
If sale were made prior to the " Soldier " Moratorium date, no such evidence
is required. (It may be added that "entry into possession," in the case of
vacant land, is a matter of nicety, in which the payment of rates and the
affixing of a notice on the land itself may assist proof.) Of course where there
is an Order of the Court for sale, the Registrar-General will not require the
evidences mentioned.

(3) An application under this regulation shall not be granted
unless the Court is satisfied—
{a) that the obligation to repay the principal sum by the
prescribed date for repayment would involve serious hard-
ship to the mortgagor ;
(b) that the conduct of the mortgagor in respect of dealings
with the mortgagee has not been such as to render him
undeserving of the benefit or protection of this regulation ;
