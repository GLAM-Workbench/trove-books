(Enter Tante Wacket, weeping)
Tante Wacket, mine gombliments to you !
Oh, Master Rammsbock. my husband is dead.
What, dead ? Your horsepant!
Ter hardy blacksmith dead ?
Yah, dead ! yah, dead !
And did he, as I ordered,
Eat plenty ham and eggs ?
Oh yah ! he ate it by the tori, sir.
Ha ha! ?E hate ?imself to death.
Now this is quite bamboozeling,
And likewise much confoozeling.
To him it?s quite bamboozeling,
And likewise much confoozeling, etc., etc.
To him it?s quite bamboozeling, etc.
To me it?s quite bamboozeling, etc.
(Enter Peter)
Ah Beter, mine master tailor.
What brings you here ?
Vrient Rammsbock, I am overjoyed,
And to my story list?
Your cure the fever has destroyed,
In vain it did resist.
Now listen, Tante Wacket,
Mine gure you cannot pack it,
Ter English doctor mit his stuff
First took me off mine legs.
Dat I?m alive and well ter-day
I owe to ham and eggs.
Now listen, Tante Wacket,
Mine gure you cannot pack it.
To put you on your legs
You just need ham and eggs.
It is a pleasant cure.
Say Sharley, now quick
Pring me mine book.
The fool is going to henter
Hin ?is prescription book
The wisdom hof a gander ;
The man ?as run amuck.
(Exit and returns with book)

Oh thou divine brescription
Lonely is the widow?s lot
Dat soothes ev?ry affliction.


Xante, Charlie, & Peter : Now my (her) man?s beneath the sod,
Rammsbock : Ham and eggs?now all take heed ?
Is a life-preserving feed
For a tailor.
Xante, Charlie, & Peter : Lonely is the widow?s lot
Rammsbock : For a tailor ;
Xante, Charlie, & Peter : Now my (her) man?s beneath the sod.
Rammsbock : But for blacksmiths
Xante, Charlie, & Peter : Lonely is the widow?s lot
Rammsbock: Most destructive.
Xante, Charlie, & Peter : Now her man?s beneath the sod.
Rammsbock : For blacksmiths most destructive.
Rammsbock (to Xante): Xante Wacket, weep no more,
Xhere are good men by the score;
Pleasant was his death.
Charlie & Peter : Courage, Xante, and take heart,
(to Xante) No more tears be shedding ;
We this good advice impart?
Have another wedding.
(Solo) Peter : He was old and quite morose,
? Charlie : And ?e ?ad a pimple hon ?is nose,
Xante (picking up a bit): And his eyes were always sore,
And from morn till night he swore ;
He swore from morn till night.
Rammsbock : And his thirst was always great,
Peter : Pints he?d swallow in one breath
Xante: - Yah! I well remember it?
Often he did tipsy get,
He often came home drunk.

Why should we still repine ?
Outside the sun doth shine,
Let?s make our hay. (Seque dialogue)
Rammsbock: Yah, mine goot Xante Wacket, a nice fat leedle vomans
like you will soon get anodder horsepant; in der meandime you hafe all
der gomforts a vomans gan exbect in dis vorld. You hafe got rid of vone
horsepant whom ter greatest toctor in ter Xransvaal gould not geep alife

glever mans! You untershtands ter ladies! I have gome to bay (pay)
mine acgounts.
Rammsbock : Dere now, Beter, dere is vone glever lady for you. (Rufis
his hands, etc.)
Xante Wacket: How much is der acgount, Xoctor ?
Rammsbock (considering a moment): Veil now, Xante, gqnsidering dat
your horsepant died, I charge you fifteen pups (bob) in cash, six hairs of
fat fowls, your late horsepant?s small anvil, his pig bair of tongs for tooth
pulling, two ostrich feathers and dirty-hine (39) duck eggs.
Charlie: Couldn?t you throw in a couple of helephants, a giraffe, a
?ippopotamus, and a boa constrictor, just to complete the circus ?
Rammsbock (angrily): Sharley !
Charlie : Hall right, sir. Hit?s honly a bad ?abit I?ve got of thinking aloud.
(Goes on with hjs work).


Xante VVacket (giving money): Veil, toctor, here is ter money. I shall
sent ter odder dings up ter-morrow ;? and many tanks, toctor. Goot day.
(Rammsbock escorts her to door). ,
Rcim in shock: Many tanks, Xante W ticket. Many, many tanks, it

Peter (delighted): Ah, dat ish goot! Many tanks, toctor.
Rammsbock; But Beter, you must do somedings for me?someding in
your line.
Peter : I shall only be too habby, toctor.
Rammsbock: Veil, Beter, I vants you to make me a suit of glose
(clothes) like ter (tamn) English doctor wears, and then I shall be as goot
as he. It?s all in der glose, Beter.
Peter : Of course, toctor, dat?s what we tailors say, only ter buphc gan t
see it. * All right, I vill make you vone suit dat vill baralyze ter English-
man?s. I?ll do it toctor ?or busst. (Exit).
Charlie : Ah, that would be good now !
Rammsbock : Did you shbeak, Sharley ?
Charlie: Hi really forget now?perhaps I did. It?s heven money heither way.
Rammsbock: Never mind your everlasting petting business. Give me
mine smogbibe. (Charlie brings pipe and matches. Rammsbock strikes
a match). Hafe you got your razors in goot nick now, Sharley ?
Charlie ; Fairish, doctor. (Aside) Hi?ll lay 6to4?e 11 find the matches
too ?eavy for ?is ?and. (Rammsbock business with match, etc. Charlie
delighted). ? Dat wash goot.? . .
Rammsbock (enraged): How dare you larf and imitate mine slight
Dutch accent, you lazy tog. You thinks begause you are a cockney who
slings his H?s about broadcast dat you can larfe at odder beoble?s slight
accent
Charlie (aside): Hi struck ?im that time. Hi?ll ?ave to pacify ?im. (Xo
Rammsbock) Hi beg your pardon, doctor. My remark did not refer to
you sir. Hi ?ave too much respect for a genius of your calibre.
Rammsbock (pacified): Veil, veil. We?ll let it pass, Sharley. I pelieve
vou did not allude to me, and now I will give you a lesson in factoring.
Shoost vait until I light mine bibe (Lights it. Charlie sits in front of him).
Yesterday, Sharley, I gave you a lesson in the higher branches of
dentistry, and showed you how to pull ter Dutch buck tooths mit this
(holds up' tongs). Xer-day mine lecture shall be on ter fever (smokes a bit).
Sharley, ter fever is divided into three classes. Number vone?to use a
Latin quotation?is ter ?fevera boozica,? which arises from too much
drink. You cures dat by giving ter patient two bounces of boiled bickle
kraut.
Charlie : What?s that ?
Rammsbock: Something like ter German sour kraivt, only more sour.
Charlie : Hi lay 6 to 4 on the sour kraut to kill the fever and the patient.
Rammsbock : Veil, you gives ter kraut at 10 at night. Next morning
Charlie ; Heven money ?e?s dead.
Rammsbock:,No fear, cockney. It dakes more than dat to gdl ter
Dutchmans. No; in ter morning about 9 you gives ter patient vone
pound of old Limburger cheese. And you shoost sticks to dat brescription
until ter patient regovers. Mind you, dat is ter good old conservative cure.
Xer new and liberal cure is ham and eggs.
Charlie : Hif that?s the case no bloomin? conservatives for me. Hi?m a
No. 2 is the ?fevera miserablia,? which arises from not having enough to
drink and is frequently met mit and is very hard to cure ; but I have
disgovered an unfailing remedy. You shoost gives ter patient vone gallon
of shtrong old cider at Bin the morning. If it?s a pad attack it will
be finished in 40 minutes. You then gives him a gallon of imported


Spanish wine. When dat?s done ter fever will have gone down a bit, and
for ter rest of the day you can put ter patient on unlimited whisky and
water. Stick to dat cure and I have known a patient to regover in 6
months. Mind you dat vaster old conservative cure. Mine new and
liberal cure vos ham and eggs.
Charlie : Stop, doctor. Hi?ll change my mind. No liberals for me. Hi?m
an ? hout and hout ? conservative. Oh ! doctor, hi?m just dying to be struck
down with that fever. Hit?s 100 to 1 hi wouldn?t get over hit in 10 years,
and heven money that I never would get hover it.
Rammsbock : Veil, I must light mine bibe again (lights it). Class No. 3,
Sharley, is the ? fevera horsica.? It is a very dangerous one and affects
all classes, and is very prevalent in England and the colonies. The
symptoms are very beculiar. You shoost work like a Kaffir for 6 months,
and safes all your money; then the fever takes hold of you and you puts
ter whole dollops on a horse and of gourse you loose ter tamn lot. I?m
studying hard to find a cure for dat, and when I find it I will sell it to der
English and mine fortune will be made. Now, Sharley, you knows all
about ter fevers.
Charlie : Hi lay you 10 to 1 you won?t find a cure for Class no 3.
Rammsbock: Perhaps I shall not. It?s worth trying, anyhow. Was
dere anypody here yesterday whilst I was away ?
Charlie: Let me see. (Aside) Now,hi?ll stir?im hup. (To Rammsbock)
Oh yes. Mr. Rhodes, the English mine manager, was here.
Rammsbock : What! Was der tamn ?Assvogel? here again ? Did he
shpeak mit Lena!
Charlie : Rather ! ?E took ?er lovely little ?and this fashion, and oh my !
tomato sauce and veal cutlet! ?e kissed it.
Rammsbock (furiously): Hell and Tonner! I vill gill him mit mine
gun?mine knife ?mine pistol?mine axe ?mine?mine ass, or anydings
else mine neighbour?s got. (Raves about).
Charlie: But, doctor, surely you would not kill a man for paying his
?haddresses? to your ward. Hit?s only natural.
Rammsbock : No?it?s tamnable ! Lena is mine broberty. I want her
for mineself. Ter Englishmans is vellgome to ter mines as long as he
leaves me mine Lena.
Charlie ; They are both young and handsome and
Rammsbock : I will paint his face for him if he gomes here again. No,
Lena shall be mine leedle frau, and you shoost see. After Beter has made
me mine new suit, and mit der belltopper which mine great great grand-
fader wore at ter siege of Antwerpen I shall hold mine own mit any of
dem.
Charlie (aside); ?E shan?t ?ave Lena hif my assistance is hany good to
Tom Rhodes.
Rammsbock : Now, Sharley, off you go on your shaving round (Charlie
begins to pack up his kit). I?m quite upset mit der Englishmans goming
after Lena. I must have a drink (produces bottle), it vill give me courage
to punch ter Englishman when he gomes here again.
Charlie (aside): You?ll want plenty hof it. Hi?ll lay 100 to 1 hon one.
Rammsbock (drinks): Ah ! dat wash goot.
(Charlie pours out a stiff one behind his back and drinks it off).
Charlie (smacking his lips): Ah ! that was better. (Exit)
No. 2. Aria : Rammsbock.
Rage, jealousy and fury
Now fill my smitten heart.
I love this charming houri ?
I?m shtruck mit Cubit's tart. (Cupid's dart)
Let him beware who dares to
Love her for whom I rave ;
By all ter Gods I swear to,
He?ll find an early grave.
But stop ! why speak in angry tone ?
Why woo her not with my drompone ? (trombone)
(Serenade with trombone obligato).


Softly now mit mine drompone
I vilfplay beneath her room, (plays)
Yes, mit music sweet
I mine love shall greet, etc.
Angry words of said in haste
Never suit ter woman?s taste.
/ Yes, mit music, etc., etc.,
Dat wash goot!
Yah ! dat wash goot! (Exit) (Seque dialogue)
(Enter Charlie after Rammsbock?s exit. He puts his kit away and pro-
duces Rammsbock?s private bottle).
Charlie : ?Ere we hare again ! Hi?ve finished one shaving round, and this
harduous duty deserves hits rewards (pours out a nobbier and drinks it). Ah !
dat wash goot! Well, really, hif hi stay ?ere much longer hi will be as bad
as the Boers with their heverlasting ?dat wash goot.? Hi ?ave just shaved
five Boers with a razor that would rake the ?ide of a helephant, and hall
they said at the hend of the scraping match was ?Dat wash goot!? Oh,
why did hi run away from my ship?the most weevily ship biscuit and hall
the kicks and blows hon board were better than this. Hi would ?ave been
hout of this long ago honly that hi promised Mr. Rhodes to assist ?im hin ?is
suit with Lena. Once that is settled hi?m hoff to the mines to seek my
fortune. Hin the meantime hi only wish that hold Rammsbock would treat
me the same has ?is patients and prescribe occasionally some ?am and heggs
for me. Ha ! ha! ha! to be sure ?e ?as ?ad some wonderful experiences
with?is patients. Oh my ! Limburger ! ?Ere are a few of them
No. 3. Aria : Charlie.
1. An apoplectic Dutchman 2. One day a cockneyed sojer
?Ad too much blood. Said : Shave me quick,
Old Rammsbock thought to let some, And mind that your hold razor
And?? Dat wash goot!? Is hin good nick.
E? took him for a ?ogget, Hit proved a day of woe, sirs,
To speak the truth, For be it hunderstood,
Of blood ?e let a bucket, ?E cut the sojer?s nose, sirs,
And?? Dat wash goot.? And ?? Dat wash goot.?
The Dutchman ?e sat like a stone, The sojer with a hoath and cry
And?strange to say ? Rose from ?is chair
From that day ?e?s dead and gone, And ?it old Rammsbock in the heye,
And never never paid. And that was fair.
Ts wife she proved a bother, ?Ekicked'and punched and strove, sirs,
And mischief brewed. To leave as food
Says ?e?Just take another, My master for the wolf, sirs,
And ?? Dat wash goot.? And ?? Dat wash goot.?
3. Ach ! cried old Katharina,
?Quick bull (pull) mine tooth.
?Twas fit for a hyena,?
And?? Dat wash goot!?
?Mine tongues hold fast and mind her,?
As firm he stood.
He bulled (pulled) the old girl?s grinder,
And??? Dat wash goot.?
?Oh murder ! thief! I have your life,?
The woman booed,
? He bulled (pulled) the wrong one?he bulled five,?
And ?? Dat wash goot.?
Now with ten fingers scratchy,
Hin madd?ning mood,
Ts payment did then catch he,
And ?? Dat wash goot!?

etc., etc.
Who is not moved by sorrow, etc., etc.
(Seque dialogue)
Lena : Ah ! how I tremble for the future ! My odious guardian watches
me like a beast of prey. Does he think that /, the daughter of a Dutch
gentleman and an English lady, could stoop to marry a vulgar Dutch
quack who is poisoning the country broadcast ? Thank heaven I am not
altogether deserted, for Charlie is my faithful ally and the old German
schoolmaster is my friend. Courage, heart, courage, and everything will
come out well at the end. If my guardian is cunning we must be cunning
likewise. (Enter Rammsbock, who stands at the door lost in admiration).
(Lena aside) Ah ! there he is. I must be on my guard.
Rammsbock (aside): Ach! dere she is, the pootiful creature, fresh and
rosy like vone ripe Dutch cheese. I shoost could gobble her up. But
faint heart never tackled a Limburger. I vill brobose at vonce and settle
ter Englishman?s hash for ever and ever.


Lena : j Else my case will hopeless be.
Rammsbock : I Blushingly she turns away.
Lena: ( ?Tis but fair and quite becoming
Rammsbock : ( ?Tis their manner, ?tis their fashion,
Lena : ( To defeat his'claims ?pon me.
Rammsbock : ( Soon I?ll name ter vedding day.
(Solo) Lena : Oh ! but sir, you have surprised me,

Rammsbock: And now dat I?ve advised thee,
Love, reward me mit vone leedle kiss.
(kisses her, &c.)
Ah ! dat wash goot.
Lena (furiously): Monster ! (slaps his face) ?dat wash petter.?
(Solo) Lena : Why presume then, that I love you ?
Never have my lips confessed.
Rammsbock : Beauteous angel, do not worry,
It?s enough dat I?ve confessed.

Rammsbock : Mine pootiful Lena, you are astonished and overcome by

I gan dell you. Me ?I ?whose name vill be in every almanac and on
every jam tin in the universe. Ter man who disgovered ter marvellous
ham-and-egg cure?whose name will live for ever and ever. Scripture
dells us that Solomon was a Jew and not allowed to eat ham and eggs,
but if he had done so he would hafe taken unto himself another 500 wives ;
and if Adam and Methusalem would hafe gobbled ham and eggs, they
would be alive and kicking now. And I, ter inventer of this great cure,
have condescended to let you be mine frau. It is marvellous ! (The sound
of a guitar is heard from outside). What?s dat ? (Goes to the window
and looks. Lena follows and makes signs to someone outside, behind his
bcick))
Lena: Oh, that?s Mr, Rhodes, the English mining manager. He is
tuning my guitar in the bower in the garden. (Aside) Now, my only
resource ?deception. (To him) How I detest him. He is always coming
here. I hate his honeyed speeches.
Rammsbock: Quite right, mine girl, he is English and should be kept
at ter distance. But if he is going to sing I will lite mine shmoke bibe and
listen. ( likes a drop of goot music, but I don?t expect much from ter
Englishmans.
No. 6. Song : Tom Rhodes.
(Volkslied atrangcd and translated by L. Bayer).
The livelong day I sigh
For one glance of your eye;
And ev?ning finds me p?rhaps in
tears.
My eye seeks you afar,
And ev?ry twinkling star
Your image bears.
He often did implore
When I would tease him so :
? Some day when gone and far away
You?d wish me back again?
You?d wish again to lay
Close to my heart.
And now he comes no more,
My heart is sad and sore,
From morn till night I now repine
If he but came once more
And as in days of yore
Say : Now he mine.
(Seque dialogue)


(Rhodes sings from behind stage. At the end of the first verse Ramms-
bock, who has been sitting and smoking, turns to Lena). Dat wash goot,
Lena. Where did ter Englishmans get that song from ?
Lena : Oh, guardian, that is a German Volkslied. The German school-
master is teaching it to the children in the village school. (Aside) He little
thinks that I taught him the old German love song.
(Symphony for second verse).
At the end of second verse?
Rammsbock (to himself): Dat wash goot! (To Lena) Lena, mine love,
ter Englishmans vot gomposed -?Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay? had one smell at
dat song.
(Rhodes sings third and last ygrse and enters with closing symphony).
Rhodes (politely to Rammsbock, offering his hand); Good morning,
doctor, and how are you to-day ? (They shake hands).
Rammsbock ; Oh, thank you. I wash goot.
Rhodes: I was just on my road to the mine, and called on my way to
obtain your professional advice. As I stepped into the garden I saw your
charming ward?s guitar in the bower and I took the liberty to make*use of
it in accompanying myself to the old German song which you have heard
me sing just now. 1 must, however, beg Miss Lena?s pardon (raises his
hat most politely and bows. Lena turns away and is stamping her foot,
etc., using sundry means to show her dislike to Rhodes) for having taken
the liberty.
Rammsbock (aside): Ter Englishmans mit his fine words is not in it.
The girl is glever, and knows the difference between blue (indicating
himself) and black (indicating Rhodes) bock biltong.
Rhodes: Well, doctor, I require your professional advice. I am aware
of your fame and skill in all ailments of' the human body, but does your
skill extend also to animals ?
Rammsbock (striking his cliest): Mine frient, ter skill of ter great Toctor
Rammsbock of Krugersdorp cures anytings from ter crippled plow to a
Russian princess, and ter last is ter hardest to cure of all.
Rhodes : And pray why so, doctor ?
Rammsbock : Veil, ter Russian princess eats noddings but salt herrings,
wolf-skin sausages and fat bacon, and washes it all down mit buckets of
shambane. Veil, any medical mans vill tell you dat such diet vill cause
a garbuncle on ter left side of ter nose, and ter toctor as can cure garbuncle
on ter left side of ter nose is no chicken, but a full grown ostrich. And I
can do it.
Rhodes (aside): The old humbug has spoken the truth for once. At any
rate he possesses the voracity of an ostrich. (To him) Well, doctor, I have
a fox terrier puppy bad with the distemper. Could you give me anything
that would get him over it ?
Rammsbock (scratching his head and looking perplexed): Is ter bubby
very pad ?
Rhodes : Yes, pretty bad.,
Rammsbock (his face lighting up): Well, I will give you a brescription
which will cure your tog in no time. But it will cost you ten pups.
Rhodes : But 1 haven?t got ten puppies. I have only the one.
Rammsbock: Ha, ha ! etc. I did not mean ten bubbie togs, but ten
shillings in money.
Rhodes : Oh, I see. (Puts his hand in his pocket and produces money).
Certainly, doctor, with the greatest of pleasure. (Hands him the money).
Rammsbock (aside, with sparkling eyes): I?ve done ter Englishmans out
of ten pups. Dat wash goot. (To him) I vill go to mine study, and write
you the brescription. (Goes off chuckling and clinking the money).
Lena (running to Tom and taking both his hands): Oh, Tom! the
thunderbolt has fallen at last. He proposed to me this morning.
Tom : The devil he did :
Lena : And ?oh, Tom ! he kissed me.
Tom ; The devil he did !
Lena; Yes, the old devil did, and I smacked his face.
Tom : Ah ! dat wash goot.


Lena (almost crying): Oh, Tom ! why don?t you kiss me to take the smell
away. (Falls into his arms and leans back to be kissed. Enter Ramms-
bock with prescription, and jingling money).
: Rammsbock (referring to money): Dat wash goot.
(Lena and Tom have parted quickly)
Tom and Lena (aside): So it was.
Rammsbock: I?ve got ter brescription and I will explain it to you.
When you gets up to ter mine you fills up ter terrier mit blasting powder
and then you puts a red hot poker into his mouth for one secondhand all
ter distemper will be gone.
Rhodes : Yes, and what about the dog ?
Rammsbock : He will be gone, too. It is a safe and very quick cure and
I can guarantee it.
Rhodes (aside): I?d like to fill you up too with blasting powder and send
you after the dog.
Rammsbock (aside): I beat him in loff, I beat him for ten pups, and now
I will beat him mit a song. (To him) Well, Mr. Rhodes, I heard you sing
a song. It wash goot. I will sing you one petter. I will sing you ter
Dutchman?s shampion song.
No. 7. Song : Rammsbock.

Rammsbock ; Dat wash goot.
Tom : Yes, doctor, it was a capital song, and undoubtedly a very nice
way of sending a Dutchman to h ,to heaven I mean ; but doctor, how
is it that your charming ward has such a decided aversion to me ? During
your absence just now I tried in vain to draw her into conversation, but
by her manner towards me I should say she downright hates me.
Rammsbock (delightedly draws him aside): You see, mine frient, Lena
:ig a goot sensible girl and does not like ter English, although her mother
was an Englishwomans. I was mit her fader when he was gilled in a
fight mit der Zulus, and as her modder had died shortly after her birth, he
abbointed me her guardian. I was always fond of ter medical profession
and shortly after I gave up farming and started in ter factoring pusiness
and made a great name for mineself. Lena has a nice little fortune and I
have it well invested. I gave her a goot education, and she is as glever as
she is pootiful, and ter reason she does not like you is pecause she loves
me ?me, ter great Toctor Rammsbock, and I will lose no time in making
.her mine frau, and to show dat ter Dutchman is a generous mans I will
invite you to ter veddings. (
Tom: Thank you, doctor, have no fear, I shall be at Miss Lena s
? wedding. (Aside) This is getting serious. I must get him away again for
a few minutes. (Moves as if to go out, but seems to remember something)
Oh, doctor, I nearly forgot?our whim horse has got staked and requires
poulticing. ? Could you make me up a strong poultice that will draw well ?
Rammsbock (scenting money): Mr. Rhodes, I can give you a boultice
that will draw ter horse?s leg off. I have ter shampion boultice in ter
world.
Tom : I am glad to hear it, doctor ; it will require something strong.
Oh, how much will it be, doctor ? '
Rammmsbock: Ordinary strength I charges ten bubs, extra shength 15
bubs. ...
Tom : Very well, doctor. (Gives him money). I shall require it extra
strong, and shall wait here until you make it up.
Rammsbock (aside, in high glee and with a wink): Bickle kiaut and
Limburger. I will give it to him extra strong. 15 bubs for a poultice!
Ter man is a fool. (To him) I will make it up at once. (Off).
Lena (running to Tom in great distress): Ah, Tom, how will all this end ?
Tom : Never fear, Lena. Leave it to me. I shall outwit the old rogue
right enough.
Lena : How will you do it, Tom ?
Tom : I have not fully decided upon a plan, but shall lose no time now
in doing so.
Lena : Yes, yes. Do Tom. Let?s put our heads together.
Tom: Certainly, my love. (Kisses her). ?Ah! Dat wash goot,? and
well worth ? 15 bubs.?
Lena : Ob, I didn?t mean that, Tom.
Tom: Never mind, my Lena. It didn?t hurt anybody. But you aie
right. We will stick our heads together and scheme for your speedy
release from the attentions of this Dutch humbug.
No. 8. Duetto : Lena and Tom.
(a la Ungarese after Brahms).
When lovers stick their heads together and conceive
A litttle plan an ancient villain to deceive,
Hush!
Lena :
Like a mouse when pussy is asleep
They silently come forth and have a peep.
Oh ! how the cat will fret
When she finds the little mouse has fled, etc.
Or like the ancient quack who counts yet in their
Tom:
shell
The chickens ere they?re fairly hatched or strong
and well.
Swish!


From on high there shoots hi quest of prey
The falcon bold, and takes the chicks away.
Duo : Oh ! how the quack will groan
When he finds the little chick is gone, etc., etc.
(Seque dialogue)
Hammsbock (with kerosene tin. As he enters Lena quickly snatches up
a bottle of scent and holds it to her nose. Tom holds his nose in disgust):
There, mine frient, is ter extra strong shambion boultice.
Tom : Phew ! doctor you are right. I back it against the world. What
the devil is it ?
Rammsbock ; Dat is some ten-year-old Limburger cheese.
Tom : Ten-year-old ! You mean 10,000 years.
Rammsbock: Never mind, it vill shift ter creation ; but if you?ll gives
me ten more bubs I will tell you ter antidote for it. (Tom gives money).
(Rammsbock, pocketing money) Veil, ter antidote for old Limburger
cheese is a large Spanish onion. I hafe vone here. (Gives it to him).
You hold it to your nose, and you will not smell ter Limburger.
Tom (takes his hand from his nose): Five minutes more of the Lim-
burger and I would have been dead. By jove ! Saved by an onion ! It?s
wonderful!
Rammsbock: Yes, mine frient, there is nothing to beat it but ter onion,
and ter Britishmans owes everytings to it; mit ter onion they drove the
Romans out of their country, and mit ter onion they won all their victories
by land and sea. Ter night before ter battle of Waterloo ter Tchuke of
Wellington had a large onion served out to every officer and man and he
ate three pig ones himself, and as ter Frenchmans advanced ter next day
they were shoost annihilated mit der poisonous perfumes. At last
Napoleon turns to Ney and says?? Where ter tevil did ter British get ter
onions from ? I thought I had bought up all ter onions on ter continent.?
Says Ney??Your Majesty, they?re ter accursed Spanish onion, and they
brought them mit them from ter Peninsula.? Says old Nap.??We?re
euchred,? and he turned the color of four-year-old biltong. Says Nap.?
?We have only one chance left. Bring up ter Old Guard, they might be
able ter stand it.? Off goes Ney and brings up ter Old Guard. On they
came with their hands to their noses, and that?s the reason why they never
fired a shot, but when they came within twenty yards they took their
hands off their noses to charge, when ter Tchuke sings out ?Up, Guards,
and let ?em have it,? and ter British just gave them two whiffs and ter
Old Guard was no more. Yes, mine frient, ter Limburger is strong, but
ter onion beats it. I will show you ter power of ter Limburger. When I
hangs it outside it draws ter customers to mine shop like a magnet, and I
makes'mine fortune mit it. See? (Puts tin outside).

Bntr? Scte.
(Seque dialogue).
Tom: Well, my love. And who is the man you have chosen to assist
us in our scheme ?
Lena: It is our schoolmaster, Tom. He is a German, and quite trust-
worthy. I owe to him what education and accomplishments I possess,
and he loves me as he would his own child. He sees through my
guardian?s intentions and monstrous impositions, and detests him accord-
ingly. In short, Tom, we may safely depend upon him.
Tom : And what is the name of this no doubt bespectacled paragon of a
German, my love ?
Lena: His proper and full name is Carl Herman Fritz Gustave Schlap-
permenterzwiebelkuchendampfnoodlepastettenfresser. Oh! (Exhausted-
like holds her jaw. Business with Tom).
Tom (soothingly): Poor little girl! Where does it hurt ?
Lena (almost in tears): Here. (Tom kisses the place indicated) And
here. (Business).
Tom (tenderly): Is it better now ?
Lena: Yes, thank you. I will get over it in time. I tried it once before
and was laid up for six weeks.
Tom (seriously): Lena, as you love me promise me never to attempt it
again.
Lena : Be easy, Tom. I shall never attempt it again ; and it really is not
necessary, for most people just call him Schlapp for brevity sake. But you
ought to hear some 20 Dutch women address him in full.
Tom : May heaven preserve me from such a calamity!
Lena: It sounds like a hundred chaffcutters and buzz-saws in full swing.
Ah ! here he comes Let me introduce you. (Enter Schlapp) Mr. Schlapp,
lam so glad to see you. Let me introduce to my you know.
Schlapp : Oh, yes, my dear, I know. And to give you time to recover
from your blushes I will introduce myself. They generally call me
Schlapp, although my name is
Tom : My name is Tom Rhodes, and I shall be glad if you extend to me
the same privilege as you do to Lena by permitting me to use your
abbreviated name. My Christian name is Tom, and I like my friends to
call me by it.
Schlapp (shaking hands): With the greatest of pleasure, Tom. Well,


our Lena has informed me of everything, and I have a little plan which
will see you married within twelve hours, providing we play our cards
well.
Lena (throwing her arms around his neck): Oh ! you dear old Schlappy.
Tom (wringing his hands): If you?ll manage that I shall be indebted to
you for life.
Schlapp : There, there, children. That will do. Surely it?s nothing
unusual for a German to assist a Britisher. History is only repeating
itself in a small way, and in your case I am just a selfish old man, for I
like you both. However, tin\e presses. At present, thanks to Charlie?s
foresight, Rammsbock is holding an inquest at the village inn, but he will
be here almost immediately. Lena, my child, if you are brought in to
marry Tom, object at first, but finally consent. Do not spoil everything
by being too eager. Tom, I will instruct you in the meantime. Just trust
to me and we will beat the old Boer at his own game.
No. 11. Trio : Lena, Tom, Schlapp.
Lena : When cats go a-mousing
Beside a running stream,
They might get a sousing,
They might slip in, etc.
Tom : When men go a-wooing,
V They should always choose
A dove whose sweet cooing
Will prove not a ruse, etc.
Schlapp : The dove will prove .not a ruse.
Lena and Tom : ?Tis only when youth mates with youth,
, J ?" And a loving heart goes with the hand.
That marriage proves happy and good,
And brings bliss and joy without end.
Trio : ?Tis only when youth mates with youth, etc., etc.
(Seque dialogue)
Schlapp : Hush ! hush ! Here he comes. Now play your parts.
(Enter Rammsbock, hot and out of temper).
Rammsbock : Ter fools ! To call me in to bring to life a man vot?s been
dead five days ago. It?s asking too much, even of me!
Tom (with staring eyes and mad-like goes up to take Rammsbock?s
hand): My fate is sealed, doctor. Farewell! I shall keep my resolution.
Farewell! (Exit dramatically).
Lena (looking after Tom): Ha! ha! ha! The presumptions fellow!
Ha :ha ! ha! (Goes off to her room laughing).
Rammsbock (bewildered, to Schlapp): Vot?s der madder, schoolmaster ?
Hafe they all gone mad ?
Schlapp : The Englishman will trouble you no more.
Rammsbock : Ach ! Dat wash goot! But why ?
Schlapp: To use his own slang?your little Lena has settled his hash for
ever and ever, for she told him in my presence to go about his business as
she had better prospects in view.
Rammsbock (in ecstasy): Bickle kraut and sausage! She is vone
sensible leetle vomans. Better brospects ! I should say so. Look here,
you whacker of ter young Boers. Do you see me ?
Schlapp : Yes, you certainly are visible.
' Rammsbock (striking his chest): Veil, look hard, for I am ter petter
brospect. To use a Latin quotation??l amo'going to splido in rieafb,
future mina leetla Lena.? Dere, mine vrient, put dat in your bibe and
shmoke it.
Schlapp; Yes, the prospect is no doubt very enchanting, as the boa
constrictor said to the monkey before swallowing it.
Rammsbock (digging him in the ribs): Ha ! ha ! You?re vone funny tog
and likes to make ter choke. You shall tance at mine veddings.
(Enter Charlie, greatly excited).
Charlie : Oh doctor, they?re a-coming ! They?re 3-coming !
Rammsbock ; Who, Sharley ? Who ?


Charlie: Why, the corpse?the funeral. Hi mean the funeral of the
party upon which you ?eld a hinquest a little while ago. I ?ad arranged a
most ?illegant funeral,? as Pat would say ; but the policeman hobjected for
you didn?t give a certificate of death. They?re coming now to get it.
(Aside to Schlapp) The best joke out. Hit?s not a man at all, but, a dead
monkey. (He listens). Listen to the funeral chant. (A choral is heard at
some distance and is followed by a funeral march and dirge).

Tante Wacket: Ach! doctor, couldn?t you bring ter poor fellow to life
again. We?re rather short of marriageable men in Krugersdorp. Wouldn?t
a good feed of ham and eggs bring him round now ? .
Rammsbock: I?m afraid it would not. To use a Latin quotation, he s

Hippocrates, he?s completely ? eucalyptibus.? Here is ter certificate. I

that one has the best tell-tale tail in existence.
Rammsbock: Dell-tail-pail-mail-hell-tell-mell-sell?what languidge are

Charlie : I am talking plain Henglish.
Rammsbock : Oh shiminy Xmas ! Give us something plainer.

You?re vone great pig li . No I von?t.

Rammsbock: It was shoost dis vay. I vos vone day fishing in ter Vaal
River for ter Irish flathead vhen an Englishmans gomes along and fishes

out of mine nose and mine eyes I suddenly remempers dat vone dime I
gilled a black snake dat measured 49ft. 9in., and had vone tin yistle and
nine young vones inside of her. Ter Englishmans shoost put his bibe in
his bocket and says?Dat wash tamn goot too, and baits his hook. Five
minutes later ter Englishmans scratched his head and said ?It vos ter 17th

Rammsbock: What! Never?
Lena : Well, hardly ever. (Aside) The old gag came to my rescue.
Rammsbock : And why not, mine dear ?
Lena : Because, sir, a kiss is a pledge of love, and thus a very serious
matter to a maiden. Listen to my song
No. 15. Aria : Lena.
Let a maiden well consider
Ere she gives away her hand ;
Wealth, position, are but glitter,
Bliss built up on shifting sand.
But when heart and heart are beating
To a joyous major key,
Thus united, life so fleeting
Then alone can happy be.
Life is but a plain of sorrow
Watered by a tiny stream,
Running now, if dry to-morrow
With it dies then love?s sweet dream.
Let life?s homestead e?er be planted
Close beside the stream of love.
Oh its banks ?a spot enchanted ?
Reap the blessings from above. (Exit Lena)

Rammsbock: Put, mine vrient, you vould not hurt ter leedle vomans ?
She couldn?t loff two.
Tom (aside): Some of them can. (To him) No sir, lam an Englishman,
and shall take an Englishman?s revenge upon the woman who has rejected
my love. In short, lam a man of means, and worth some �60,000. I
know you are a magistrate, and I have come to you to make my will. I
shall leave every penny of my fortune to Lena, and having done so I crave
nothing but a speedy death. Such is an Englishman?s revenge.
Rammsbock (almost paralysed with excitement, now embraces him): Oh
you lofHy good kind Englishmans ! You arc vone brober shentlelmans ?
m fact ail Englishmans are shentlemans. Your revenge does credit to
your heart and to your nation. Oh how I loffs you !
Tom : I am well conversed with English law and know very well that

come to you, v
Rammsbock : Quite right. You could not hafe gome to a petter man.
(Aside) I?ll make it secure enough if I can. (A knock is heard).
Tom (to Rammsbock, who is at the door): Who is that ?
Rammsbock (in a whisper): It is old Schlapp, the German schoolmaster.
Tom : I don?t care much about him.
Rammsbock : Oh he is vone very respectable honest mans. Vone great
scholar ?veil up in ter law. He could help you mit your vill.
Tom : All right, then. Let him in. (Enter Schlapp. Tom?s head falls
upon the table, etc.)
Rammsbock (drawing Schlapp aside): Mynherr Schlapp, you hafe shoost

Schlapp : Allow me to congratulate you. This is indeed a stroke of luck
for you, doctor.
Rammsbock : Shoost help me to fix up dis broberly, and I shall not

Schlapp (thoughtfully): Hem ! His relations are bound to dispute such

Rammsbock : Of gourse ; but shurely dere is a vay out of dat.
Schlapp : There is, one, and not a very difficult one either.
Rammsbock: Hah! mine goot vrient, I knew you?d find ter vay out of

Schlapp (pointing to Tom): How is he ? I mean professionally. How
long will he last ?
Rammsbock: He is very bad, inteed. To judge by tfie colour of his
nose he might be vone ?deadum coonum? in about vone hour.
Schla'pp : Good ! The man will be dead in an hour. Why not makry
him in the meantime TO Lena ? No one cari or will dispute the will with

Schlapp : The scheme is working beautifully. You are acting splendidly.
We?ll catch the old fool in his own trap. Have you got the ring ?
Tom (gives ring): Here it is. But I say, Schlapp, this is very dry work.
My throat is parched, and I feel very ?longtwoalish ? like.
Schlapp; Patience, patience, my friend. Once married we shall all
moisten our lips in honour of the occasion. Silence ! here they come.
(Rammsbock is now seen at the door almost dragging Lena along).
Lena: Oh, sir, please have reason. The thing is impossible. Ido not
love the man. Surely you are joking, sir.
Rammsbock : Now, now, you shoost be vone goot leedle girl and do as
I dell you. The man is of no consequence. He is dying.
Lena (aside): To marry me. (To him) What! Marry a dying man ?
Impossible!

Lena (has opened tin and peeps in): Ah how they sparkle ! They would
make a necklace fit for a queen. And I shall be a widow in no time! That
would be putting up a record. What woman could resist such temptation.
(Closing the tin) Very well, sir. I agree to your proposal. The marriage
will be a civil and private one. Let us proceed.

a Latin quotation, has got the ?funkibus.?
Schlapp : Never fear, doctor. I have a reviver in here (tapping the black

Rammsbock : But exblain. How did it come apout.
Schlapp: Oh quite easy. You see the poor fellow was very far gone
and I did not know how to revive him to enable him to sign the will, when
I presently recollected that I had a knuckle of ham and some eggs in my
bag, and I decided to administer your famous cure, for, as you assert it
brings alive the good for the unborn babies, old maids, and men
with wooden legs, I concluded it ought to be good for a poisoned man.
I gave him a slice and made him suck an egg, and here is the result.
Thanks to your marvellous discovery we have snatched him from the
grave and restored him (enter Lena, who runs into, Tom?s arms) to his
loving and charming wife.
Rammsbock (in a rage to Tom): Here, hold on dere. None of dat. She
is mine leedle broberty.
Tom :Oh get out, you old humbug. Did you not marry her to me in
legal Dutch fashion as a Magistrate, before witnesses, all signed and
serene ?
Rammsbock: Ach dat wash only until you had snuffed out and made
your vil) in her favour.
Lena: But, guardian, you see he did not snuff out, but, thanks to you,
he is well and strong, and we do love each other.
Rammsbock: Tamn ter ham and eggs, and dat meddling gogglyeyed
Yarman.
Schlapp : Now, my Dutch friend, you just leave the German alone. Its
the usual thing for a German to stand by a Britisher.
Tom : Besides, old man, if I have my treasure in Lena, you have your
fortune aud fame in your celebaated ham and egg cure. Your name and
fame will live for ever and ever.
Rammsbock (brightening up): Veil, children, you are right. Enjoy your
life whilst I, to use a Latin quotation, will devote mineself to the artibus of
healium mitabus ham and eggibus omnibus sickibus. (Aside) Dat peats ter
Yarman?s Latin, anyhow.
Charlie (panting): Well, at last hi ?ave gathered the witnesses. They?re
hall the cripples hin the place, and rather slow, but they?ll be ?ere in good
time. Your girl, Tante Wacket, is amongst them. She?ll ?ave you yet. ?
Rammsbock (taking him aside): Sharley, we don?t vant ter vitnesses
now. Ter Englishmans is gured and is sticking to ter marriage. I have
lost mine pet and a fortune in mine Lena ; but I have found another in ter
ham and egg cure, and I shall console mineself by marrying Tante
Wacket.
Tante Wacket (going up to him): Ach dere is vone glever mans for you.
He knows dat I make ter best bickle kraut in ter whole Transvaal, and
vhen ter great Toctor Rammsbock marries me he vill get a vrow to be
prout of. Tante Wacket will know how to carry herself as the great Mrs.
Toctor Rammsbock.
Charlie : But ?ow did it hall come about ?
Rammsbock : Veil, ter Englishmans vos snatched from ter grave mit
vone slice of ham and vone egg. Oh Sharley, I have lost mine pet to you ;
but I am now ter greatest toctor of all dimes.


Charlie: The devil you are ! Oh hif we honly ?ad tried the ?am and
hegg cure hon the dead monkey.
Rammsbock : Oh shiminy, Sharley ! He would pe alive now, eh ?
Charlie: Ha! ha! ha ! (Goes up to Tom and Lena). Hit came hoff
hallright. From the start hit looked a6to 4 hon chance. I congratulate
you.
Tom : Thanks to you and our friend Schlap'p. And don?t forget, Charlie,
that a good billet is waiting for you at the mine.
Charlie : Thank you sir ; but hi ?ave won �l5O hoff the boss, and hi ?ave
come to the conclusion that this is not the country for me. To-morrow
hi start for Hengland, and shall not be ?appy huntil hi ?ave a pint of
arf an? arf in Seven Dials. But before hi go hi should like to try the 'am
hand hegg cure hon my witnesses.
Rammsbock : Dat wash goot. Let ?em in, Sharley.
Charlie: Righto!

Now toss your eggs
And move your legs,
This is a great historic day.
Our medico
So well does know
How ills and aches are chased away.
So toss your eggs, etc., etc.
J Should the land be struck with plague,
| He (I) will quickly set it right.
With some ham a new-laid egg
He will give the plague a fright.
But ham, though flavour e?er so fine,
? Will make you thirsty rather,
So I prescribe you beer and wine,
But leave alone the water, (wasser)
Drink only beer and wine,
But leave alone the water, etc.
The likes of him cannot be found
In palace, mansion, hut, or kraal;
He is the gem
Of all great men,
The glorious star of the Transvaal.
j Rinderpest or any plague
j He will quickly conquer it.
With some ham a new-laid egg
He will give the plague a fit.
So toss your eggs
And move your legs,
For we have found eternal youth.
We daily take
Our ham and egg,
And live for ever. Dat wash goot!
