CHAPTER I
TOMMY AND THE OTHERS
At noon on a day late in September, the
express train from London rested, panting
and impatient, for a brief halt at the little
countryside station of Poppicombe. The
arrival and departure of this train was the
event of the day to most of the inhabitants,
not only of Poppicombe, but of the sur-
rounding villages. There were quite half-a-
dozen people standing on the platform, and
the station staff, consisting of two men and
a boy, were moving about briskly. One
man was busily engaged in handing various
newspapers and packages, which had been
thrown from the guard?s van, to the people
who had been awaiting them ; the other
man, the stationmaster, was exchanging a
few words with the guard, at the end of the
platform; while the boy porter, looking
about disconsolately for some doors to bang
distinguished himself by suddenly slamming
the open door of the luggage van, much to
the astonishment of the guard. As soon
as the train had rumbled away, the young


porter seized a newspaper from a pile stand-
ing on a trolly, opened it at a particular
page, and, after reading a few words, let
forth a wild war-whoop. Then, in spite of
the glare in the stationmaster?s eye, he
rushed madly out of the station and looked
excitedly up Longhill Avenue. There in
the distance he saw, coming slowly towards
the station, a young girl of twelve or thirteen
years of age, seated upon a sturdy Exmoor
pony. Although she sat her mount with
the ease that comes only to the born rider,
a close observer would have noticed that
the slight droop about her slim young
shoulders became more pronounced as she
neared her destination. She was dressed
in black, and her plain wide-brimmed sailor
hat was trimmed only with a narrow band
of crape.
She rode forward with an eye that seemed
to ignore all outward objects, her thin,
small-featured face betokening a mood of
deep despondency. Her errand had been
the same for many days, and day after day
she had met with nothing but disappoint-
ment. A few weeks ago she had taken the
journey at a canter. Now, in spite of her
natural high spirits, Tommy, as she was
called by her family and friends, held the
reins in such a listless fashion that the pony
merely sauntered through the Avenue, as
though he too shared her depression. Her


lack of vigour was perhaps the more notice-
able because her thin, wiry body looked
framed for energy. There was an unmis-
takable air of health about the young girlish
figure, but Tommy, although she was quite
unconscious of it, was suffering from fatigue
of the spirit. She had borne up bravely
enough at first, but successive daily dis-
appointments had at length proved too
much for her.
Now Longhill Avenue does not belie its
name. It has a hill, and the hill is long and
gently sloping, with rows of tall chestnut-
trees on either side. When Tommy had
reached the foot of the hill, she suddenly
became aware that some one was shouting
lustily. She started, and looking up quickly,
saw a quaint little figure, dressed in cor-
duroys, with a peaked cap much too large
for him, wildly waving a paper, and rushing
towards her from the station yard as fast
as hobnailed boots allowed. She touched up
her pony and was soon within hail of the
freckled, rosy-cheeked young porter, whose
face was spread abroad with smiles.
? It?s all right, miss, her be sound as
bacon,? he gasped breathlessly. ? See
then I ? he added, and as Tommy came
nearer to him he pointed with a grimy
thumb to the Shipping Intelligence column
of the newspaper which he had snatched
from the pile at the station.


Tommy took the paper, and, scanning
the paragraph eagerly, read: ? The barque
Elizabeth , thirty days overdue from Val-
paraiso, spoken by the liner Kildonan
Castle , in the Bay of Biscay; all well.?
As she read these few lines, the whole
expression of Tommy?s face changed. Her
dark eyes brightened; a wave of gladness
seemed to surge through her as she drew
herself erect in the saddle. The smile about
the corners of her rather wide but sweet-
looking mouth deepened, and even her hair,
which had appeared dispirited a few moments
ago, now curled itself more tightly about her
small dainty head.
? Ah I won?t they be glad 1 ? she ejaculated
in her clear, brisk voice. ? Dan, you?re a
cherub,? she cried, ?a perfect cherub; you
are indeed, Dan; ? and, turning her pony
about, was off like the wind.
Dan Whiddon watched her admiringly.
? Her do be mortal pleased,? he said to
himself, ? and her naming me ? cherub ? be
her way o? saying 4 thankee,? I reckon.
4 Cherub,? says she. Now what will old
Berry be calling I ? ?
He clumped heavily back to the station.
44 Now, you young stunpoll,? cried the
stationmaster sternly, 44 what do ?ee mean
by rampaging off like that ? ?
44 Miss Tommy?s uncle bean?t a dead ?un
arter all, I reckon,? said the boy. 44 His


ship be behind time, that?s all, and he?ll be
coming down-along soon.?
Dan?s reply was not a particularly lucid
one, but as anybody?s business was every-
body?s business in Poppicombe, the station-
master had no difficulty in understanding
the youth. He warned Dan of the evil
effects of not minding one?s own business,
and crossing the line, entered into a long
discussion with his ticket-clerk concerning
Miss Tommy and her private affairs.
Meanwhile Tommy was galloping at break-
neck speed the four miles which Jed to her
home. About a quarter of a mile from
Plum-Tree Farm, where the Westmacott
family, Tommy?s people, had lived for gener-
ations, she espied her sisters standing at the
gate leading into the paddock. They had
heard the sound of the quick tramp of the
pony?s hoofs in the distance, and had rushed
out to see why Tommy on this particular
day was riding so furiously. On catching
sight of them she repeated, in her own in-
imitable way, Dan?s method of breaking the
good news. She yelled at the top of her
voice, and waved the newspaper high above
her head. So excited was she that she
almost threw the newspaper at her elder
sister, and it dropped in a puddle formed by
the recent rains. Tommy was off the saddle
in a moment, and leaving the pony to find
his way to the stable, she picked up the


fallen paper, and wiping the dirt from
it with her pocket-handkerchief, gave it
triumphantly to her tall, dark, handsome
sister Elizabeth, whilst Mary, the second
girl, drawing nearer to Elizabeth?s side,
stood quietly waiting.
The three girls bore a certain family like-
ness to each other, but the differences were
almost equally striking. The two eldest
were tall and slim, and had the same dark-
coloured eyes, but there the resemblance
ceased. In character they were as far apart
as the poles. Elizabeth, called after her
mother, who had died when Tommy was
only a few months old, was a capable girl
of nineteen years of age, with a magnificent
head of rich dark hair, and deep-blue eyes.
Her manner w T as grave and quiet. She had
been a mother to the two younger girls
ever since she could remember, and re-
sponsibility had made her old for her years.
Her father, too, had made her his constant
companion, and she had been his right
hand in managing the farm and keeping the
accounts during the years that had pre-
ceded his death a few months before. Mary,
the second girl, who had just turned fifteen,
was as fair as Elizabeth was dark, but with
the same deep-coloured starry eyes. She
was the most studious of the three, and it
was always a great delight to Tommy,
when she found her lost in some book of


travel or adventure, to awaken her from
her dreams by forming a mouthpiece with
her hands and shouting in poor Mary?s
ear, ? Hallo! are you there ? ? But Tommy?s
winning smile always disarmed Mary?s
wrath, and, in spite of constant small dis-
agreements, the two were excellent friends.
The youngest girl, Katherine, our friend
Tommy, was thin and wiry in build, some-
what short for her years, with small black
twinkling eyes, and a little head running
over with golden curls. Her chief character-
istic so far was an endless capacity for
getting into scrapes. A demon of mischief
always seemed lurking in the twinkling
depths of her merry eyes. Just now they
danced with excitement, as she said: ? Well,
of all the cool customers you must be
the coolest, Mary, to stand there waiting,
and never to change a hair, or look over
the paper in Elizabeth?s hand, or anything.
Oh dear I Oh dear! what can you be made
of ? Dear old Uncle Ben is coming home,
coming home, coming home I ? and catching
Mary by the waist, she sang, ? Waltz me
round, Mary, waltz me round,? and twirled
her sister round and round until she was
completely out of breath.
? Do make her stop it, Bess,? besought
Mary gaspingly.
? Tommy darling, do try to be a bit
sensible,? said Elizabeth, with a smile.


? Not I I ? said Tommy, ? why should
I be sensible ? ? as she gave Mary?s pigtail
a tug.
Elizabeth, recognizing Tommy?s mood,
and fearing there would be ? ructions ?
presently, tactfully put her arm about her
gay-hearted, mischievous small sister, and
led the way indoors.
This was not the first time by any means
that Elizabeth had acted as peacemaker in
the Westmacott family. When she was
quite a child, and Tommy a mere baby, she
had often been called by Mrs. Pratt, the
housekeeper, to see if she could induce ? that
plaguy young limb ? to behave herself.
Later on, Elizabeth had, times without
number, pleaded with her father not to be
so angry, or quite so severe, with his youngest
girl, however trying the child might be ;
and Mr. Westmacott, seeing that Elizabeth
thoroughly understood ?the imp of mis-
chief,? as he called her the day he had been
obliged to summon all hands on the farm to
rescue her and her pony from a bog, left her
more and more to his eldest daughter?s care.
Then when Tommy was old enough to
accompany her sisters to ? lessons ? at the
Vicarage, again Elizabeth had to pour oil
on troubled waters, for the vicar, an old
friend of her father?s, who had undertaken
the education of the three girls, and whose
word had hitherto been taken as law, often


became very irritable when Tommy would
argue instead of accepting facts. As Tommy
increased in stature, she became, under
Elizabeth?s wise guidance, more and more
amenable to reason, but she never lost her
absolute fearlessness and independence.
All the girls had been encouraged by their
father to Live an open-air life, and Tommy
always led the way instinctively whenever
they went riding, driving, rowing and fishing.
The farmhouse was the old manor house.
The huge kitchen, with its deep-seated fire-
place and low-raftered oak-beamed ceiling,
was now used as a living-room. It had three
deep bay windows, each looking across the
flower garden on to the moors. The breath
of autumn was in the air, but the hollyhocks
and gladioli still flaunted their gay colours,
as though they refused to own that summer
had ended. The garden was Elizabeth?s
special pride ; she loved to keep it an old-
fashioned, old-world garden, and had herself
planted sweet peas and stocks, and the
spiked gillyflower, amongst the lavender
bushes and the oleanders. In fact, after
her father?s death, when Elizabeth had
found that his assets were really ? nil,?
owing to a succession of bad crops and the
cattle-disease spreading so rapidly among the
kine, she had had serious thoughts of trying
to take up. gardening as a profession, but on
talking it over with her sisters they agreed


that it would be better to wait until the
return of their uncle.
Captain Barton was their mother?s only
brother. He was a deep-sea captain, and
at the time of his brother-in-law?s death he
was sailing in mid-Pacific. But at the first
port the vessel had touched, he had received
a letter from his eldest niece, telling him the
sad news, and how things were with them,
and asking him to come to them as soon as
he could. He had answered the letter at
once, and in his reply had done his best to
hearten them. He had advised Elizabeth
to see the landlord, place the facts before
him, and ask him if he would allow the rent
to be in abeyance until her uncle arrived.
The landlord" had consented, knowing the
family so well, and so one great worry had
for a time been taken off Elizabeth?s young
shoulders. She was not obliged to remove
at once, but they all knew that it was
impossible to keep on the farm, even had
it been paying, and several evenings were
passed by the three girls in wondering what
they could do so as not to be a burden upon
their uncle. Mary had spoken of teaching,
but there would be no money to pay for the
necessary training, so that idea had to be
given up. Tommy had a new idea about
every other day as to what she?d do in order
to make the family fortune. One day she
burnt three of the saucepans, scalded herself


rather badly, and made everything around
her ? sticky,? by trying to invent a new kind
of jam. Another day she concocted the
Westmacott Cure for sick headache, and
insisted upon her sisters tasting the ? awful
mixture,? which she assured them was
harmless, and was quite annoyed when
Elizabeth and Mary advised her not to invent
anything else for a few years.
So the days went on, the girls busying
themselves about the farm and longing
eagerly for the return of the only relation
they had in the world. Captain Barton had
given them the probable date of his arrival
at Plymouth, but when the expected day
came and passed without any further news
from him, they had all become more and
more anxious and alarmed, w r ondering if his
vessel had gone dowm with all hands and
left no trace of her whereabouts. Hence
Tommy?s excitement and delight, and Eliza-
beth and Mary?s quiet joy, on hearing that
their uncle was coming to them at last.


CHAPTER II
UNCLE BEN
During the next three days the girls were
restless with excitement. Uncle Ben would,
they were sure, send them a telegram as soon
as he reached Plymouth, and one or another
of them was constantly on the look-out for
the messenger from the little village post-
office. They turned out the spare bedroom,
and had a grand clean-up ; hung fresh
curtains, aired mattress and bedclothes, and
made things shipshape, as he would say, in
anticipation of Uncle Ben?s arrival. On the
third day the girl at the post-office rode up
on her bicycle with the little brown envelope.
Tommy flew to meet her, and in another
moment -was running back to the house
crying, ? Coming to-morrow I To-morrow I ?
at the top of her voice.
Of course they drove down to the station
next day fully an hour before the train was
due. Tommy beguiled the time by weighing
her sisters and herself on the station weigh-
ing-machine, looked in at the booking-office,


ran to the signal-box and asked to be allowed
to work the levers, and in other ways acted
up to her reputation.
At last the train was signalled. The
three girls looked eagerly down the line.
Presently the engine rounded the curve
nearly half-a-mile away, and as the train
rumbled along the straight line towards the
station, a red bandana handkerchief was
seen vigorously waving at the window of a
compartment in the centre.
? There he is I ? cried Tommy, dancing
with excitement, and waving her handker-
chief in return.
? Stand back, miss,? called the station-
master, as she stepped near the edge of the
platform.
? Oh, I shan?t hurt your old engine,?
replied Tommy, who, nevertheless, allowed
her sisters to take a hand each until the train
came to a standstill. Then she darted
towards the compartment from which issued
a short, stoutish man, with a jolly, led face,
short, close-trimmed beard, and eyes ready
to light up with fun at the slightest provoca-
tion.
Captain Benjamin Barton was a sailor of
the good old-fashioned sort. He had been
to sea ever since he was thirteen, when he had
run away to Plymouth after an exchange of
discourtesies with the classical master at
the Grammar School; he never could abide


Latin. During nearly fifty years of life at
sea he had saved a considerable sum, and
had become part owner of his vessel, besides
having shares in several others. He still
loyally stuck to the sailing ship; the steam-
ship had no attractions for him; and he was
never tired of comparing the two, to the great
disadvantage of the more modern type.
Tommy once said that he reminded her of
the ?bus-driver behind whom she had sat
when on her only visit to London, who had
spoken with the bitterest scorn of the motor
omnibus. The captain?s tvinkling black
eyes gleamed with fun when Tommy assured
him artlessly that the ?busman was ? just
such a dear old stick-in-the-mud ? as he was.
Tommy sprang into his arms as he got
out of the railway carriage. He gradually
extricated himself from her embrace, and
turning to his elder nieces, silently kissed
them. In spite of a brave attempt at
cheerfulness his eyes were rather dim as he
mumbled a word of greeting. He had
always been on the best of terms with their
father, and, when he was ashore, had been
accustomed to make the farm his head-
quarters. The loss of his brother-in-law had
come as a great shock to him; and the remem-
brance of it, together with the meeting with
the three fatherless girls, almost unmanned
him for the moment. The red bandana
handkerchief came into play again ; he blew


his nose furiously, declared that railway
travelling always gave him a cold, and
turning on Dan Whiddon, the small porter,
who was staggering under a trunk he had
taken from the compartment, he cried ?
? Now, young Samson, don?t be too rough
with that little contraption of mine.?
The aggrieved look on Dan?s face set
them laughing, and the tension was relieved.
They passed out of the station, and came
to the little farm wagonette. Tommy was
usually driver, but as there was only room
for one on the driver?s seat, and she declared
that she was going to sit with Uncle, Elizabeth
good-naturedly offered to take the reins.
When the Captain, the other girls, and the
trunk were packed in behind, it was a tight
squeeze, and Dan Whiddon, rejoicing in
twopence, surveyed the pony doubtfully.
? You?m better get out and walk up t?
hill,? he suggested, with the familiarity of an
old friend.
? Be off and buy your sw r eeties, Samson,?
said the Captain, ?or w T e?ll hitch you on as
leader.? And laughing at his own jest,
Uncle Ben squeezed Mary with his right
arm, and Tommy with his left, and called to
Elizabeth to get under way.
There was little talking on the homeward
drive. The younger girls were quite happy
nestling against their uncle ; and he was
thinking of his many former home-comings.


But when he entered the bright farm parlour,
and saw the spread tea-table, and the blazing
fire which Mrs. Pratt had kindled ?then his
jolly w r eather-worn face glowed, and he cried,
in the same words he had used a score of
times before ?
? East or west, home is best. How do,
Jane ? ?
? Nicely, thank?ee sir,? returned Mrs.
Pratt, with a bob, ? except for my poor
feet.?
The girls smiled. They had heard the
same question and answer ever since they
could remember, wdien Uncle Ben came
home. Tommy meanwhile had removed his
hat, Mary had slyly stuffed his red hand-
kerchief into his pocket, and now Elizabeth
gently pushed him down into his favourite
arm-chair. Mrs. Pratt, who suffered from
bunions, and hobbled about, made the tea,
while Mary toasted what was in that country
place still called a Sally Lunn, and Eliza-
beth fetched from the dairy, now very bare
and forlorn, a pot of cool delicious Devon-
shire cream. During these preparations
Tommy was content to sit at her uncle?s
feet, resting her head on his knees, and
now and again giving his horny hand a
squeeze.
It was Tommy, however, who kept things
lively at the tea-table.
? Now, Uncle,? she would say, ? you must


have more cream in your tea, or you?ll be
as nervous as a cat.?
? Very well, my dear,? was the meek
reply. ? Afloat I drink it without milk or
cream, sea-cows not being tractable animals,
you know; but when in Rome, do as the
rum ?uns do, eh ? ?
? That dreadful old pun of yours ! You
expect us to punish you, don?t you now ? ?
? I?ll be Punch to your Judy,? returned
the Captain, with a hearty laugh, and for
some minutes he alternately cracked his
simple jokes and devoted himself to his
food. ? I always say there?s nothing in
foreign parts to match the cakes and cream
of Devonshire,? he said, ? and you?d know
it if you lived on ship?s biscuit and salt
horse, my girl.?
? Where have you been this voyage.
Uncle ? ? asked Mary.
? Peru and Monte Video, and other out-
landish parts, my dear. I was held up in
the Doldrums, and water was running plaguy
short; ?water, water everywhere, but not a
drop to drink,? as that poetry fellow says.
One more voyage, my girls, and then I drop
anchor for good.?
We hoped you would stay with us,?
said Elizabeth.
? Couldn?t do it, Bess,? he replied. ? I
can hold a straight course, but I couldn?t
run a straight furrow for the life of me.


No* one more voyage, to the South Pacific
Islands this time, and then I?ll take a snug
little cottage somewhere by the sea, and
spend my days whitewashing it, and getting
worse-tempered every day, and you shall
keep house for me, and smooth me down.
And then Tommy put the usual question?
it always came from Tommy.
? What adventures did you have this
time, Uncle ? ?
Uncle Ben rubbed his chin, and assumed
an air of deep reflection.
? Adventures I Well, the only one worth
speaking about,? he said slowly,
when we were becalmed in latitude 35
South, longitude 152� East, I think it was.
By the chart we should have been about
a hundred and fifty miles from the nearest
land, but one morning Long Jimmy?the tall
fellow with one eye, you remember ?
? Yes,? said Tommy; ? he helped me down
the side last time I saw you off.?
? Well, he was look-out at the time, and
he sings? out, ? Land-ho !? I was on deck
in a twinkling, I can tell you ; and there,
a couple of points on the starboard quarter,
was a smallish kind of island, and stretching
away behind it a lot of little islands pretty
near as far as you could see. The biggest
was as large as Mount St. Michael, maybe,
and all of a white shiny rock. I made a few
remarks about the chart-makers, and >\ as


thinking of putting out a boat to examine
it, when, bless your eyes! that island began
to move, and all the little ?uns after it.?
Here he drank half a cup of tea, and
the girls breathlessly for him to
continue.
? Some one set up a cry of sea-serpent,?
he went on gravely, ?and Sunny Pat?the
little Irishman, you remember ? ?
Yes, such a funny little man. Go on,
Uncle,? said Tommy.
? Well, Sunny Pat calls out, ? Begorra,
shure ?tis the way of openin? it is I ? and sure
enough that big island showed a gash right
across the middle, that grew wider and wider,
and each side of it there was a row of teeth
about as long as a church steeple. Jupiter,
?twas a fearsome sight. But Sandy Sam?
you remember him, the big red-headed
fellow?he?s got more presence of mind than
any able seaman I ever met. He outs with
a big gooseberry?we?d taken a few bushels
on board at Greenland?and flings it straight
at the monster, knowing that sea-serpents
can?t abide big gooseberries, being in the
same line of business, as you mav sav
Well ? J y y '
Here the story was interrupted, for the
girls made a simultaneous rush on the old
man. Tommy pummelled him. Mary put
her hand over his mouth, and Elizabeth took
his half-eaten cake, and declared that he


should have no more until he confessed that
he had been fibbing.
? You naughty wicked old man,? cried
Tommy, as he shook with laughter. ? Now
you shan?t have another cup of tea until
you?ve turned out your pockets.?
? I give in,? said the Captain. ? Three
to one isn?t fair play. I?ve had enough
tea, only let me get my pipe alight and then
we?ll see.?
As long as the girls could remember, their
uncle, on his arrival, when his first pipe was
lit, had turned out his capacious pockets, in
which there was always a present of some
kind for every one, besides oddments un-
addressed which his nieces appropriated at
their fancy. Settled in the arm-chair, with
a big calabash pipe in his mouth, he plunged
his hand into a pocket, and brought out the
red bandana handkerchief.
? That?s your flag,? cried Tommy. ?Be
quick I ?
? Patience,? he replied, producing a tin of
tobacco and a knife.
? We?ll let you keep them,? said Mary.
? What next, Uncle ? ?
? Well, here?s a small parcel with some-
body?s name on it, and it looks uncommon
like Mary.?
Mary seized the parcel, opened it, and
uttered a cry of dehght as she unfolded a
pretty Indian scarf.


? Oh, you dear I ? she cried, giving him
a kiss.
He plunged his hand again into his pocket
and drew out slowly and with a solemn air
that made the girls agog with expectation?
a short cutty pipe, at which they cried
? Shame 1 ? Then came another small par-
cel, marked with Elizabeth?s name, which
proved to contain a tortoiseshell comb with
silver mountings. Another dip brought
forth a bright round silver case with a long
cord hanging from a hole in the side. Tommy
pounced on this.
? What is it, Uncle ? ? she asked.
? It?s a contraption for getting a light in
a wind, given me by an old friend in Val-
paraiso,? replied the Captain. ? ?Twas kindly
meant, to be sure, but I?ve never used it,
for I?ve never had any difficulty in lighting
my pipe in any wind that ever blew short
of a typhoon, and then a man has other
things to think about. I?ll show you how
it?s done, and you can keep it against the
time when you?re an old woman and go
round selling things from a caravan : old
women of that sort always smoke.?
? The idea 1 ? exclaimed Tommy, but
when her uncle had shown her how to obtain
a spark by turning a little handle sharply,
and how the spark ignited the cord, she took
the thing and slipped it into her pocket.
Then at last came the parcel for which


Tommy had been eagerly waiting, and she
gave a long sigh of pleasure as she drew
through her fingers a scarf of exquisite fine-
ness like Mary?s.
? You?re a darling 1 ? she cried, giving her
uncle a tight hug, and at the same time
knocking his pipe from his mouth. ? Oh,
I?m so sorry,? she said contritely. ? Never
mind, I?ll fill it again for you.?
Captain Barton took from his pocket
sundry other articles which he divided among
the girls, as well as a queer assortment
of his personal belongings. When all his
pockets were empty, Tommy said ?
? Now you can put all that rubbish back;
see what a litter it makes I ?
? For what you don?t want, I return
humble and hearty thanks,? said the Captain,
using a form of words which they had heard
from his lips ever since they were babies.
? And now if you can think of anything but
fal-lals, we?ll settle down and have a cosy
talk about things. Draw your chairs up
to the fire, girls.?


CHAPTER 111
LEAVING HOME
Uncle Ben listened attentively as Eliza-
beth gave an account of affairs at the farm.
He did not interrupt her, but now and then
muttered an ejaculation through a cloud of
smoke. Elizabeth was clear-headed, and
did not take long to explain the position
to her uncle. It was impossible to keep on
the farm without capital, and the Captain,
though he had a good sum laid by, was not
the man to risk his money in a business of
which he knew nothing. So the farm must
be sold, and it was clear that when every-
thing was settled up, there would be little
or nothing left for the girls to live on. They
mentioned the ideas they had had of earning
their living, and the obstacles in the way;
and Captain Barton puffed at his pipe, and
pulled his beard, and every now and then
stroked Tommy?s hair as she leant against
his knee.
? Hum I ? he grunted, when all had said
their say. ? There?s only one way out of
the difficulty that I can see.?


He paused impressively, and the girls
looked at him with expectation.
?And that is,? he went on, weighing
each word, ? to get you spliced.?
? Spliced I ? cried Tommy. ? Mamed,
you mean ? Me married I ?
? Well, not you, perhaps ?not yet a bit,
seeing you are only a little tomboy sort of
thing ? . , m
? Thing I how dare you ! ? cried Tommy,
pummelling her uncle?s leg.
? I meant a thing of beauty, my dear,
said he meekly, ? which, as the poet says, is
a joy for ever.?
? He wouldn?t think me a joy for long,
I can tell you,? returned Tommy. ?But,
really, it?s too ridiculous. Bess, you don?t
want to get married ? ?
? Not for a living, certainly,? said Eliza-
beth.
? Of course not,? added Mary.
?Well, that?s squashed,? cried Tommy,
? and if you can?t think of anything better,
Captain Barton?why, you?re not married
yourself I ?
? No, my dear, I?ve never tried,? replied
her uncle" apologetically. ? Well, now,
there?s that notion I mentioned a while
ago ? a little cottage by the sea, you know;
we four ?me and the three Graces, eh ?
? It would be simply awful, Uncle,? cried
Tommy. ? Whatever should we do all day ?


We should all become perfect cats, and you?d
have a simply horrid time. No, if you want
us to live with you, you must take a house
somewhere where we could work ?earn our
salt, you know. I?m not going to be a
burden to anybody.?
? That?s a fine spirit, to be sure. Then it
must be London, I suppose, Deptford way or
Rotherhithe ; one of you could keep house
for me, and the others could go to classes,
and learn teaching or whatever it is you
want to do. What do you think of that,
now ? ?
? I should love to keep house for you,
Uncle,? said Elizabeth.
? And Mary and I would love to do the
other thing, wouldn?t we, Mary ? ? cried
Tommy. ?So it?s settled, and you?d better
advertise for a house at once, Uncle.?
? Steady, my dear. As I told you, I must
make one more voyage. I?ve a heap of
things to settle up in various parts, and it?ll
be at least a year before I?m ready. The
question is, what can you do for a year ?
You can?t remain here, and I?m not going to
set you up in London without me to look
after you.?
? Why not ? We?d look after each other,?
said Tommy.
? Couldn?t think of it, my dear,? said
the Captain decisively. ? It?s a facer, that?s
the truth.?


? I know what I ? cried Tommy, suddenly
starting up. ? Take us with you I ?
? What ? ? gasped her uncle.
? I mean it. Let?s all go for a voyage.
I?d love to go round the world.?
? Nonsense ! A parcel of girls in my wind-
jammer with their frills and furbelows I
never heard of such a thing I Ridiculous !
Entirely out of the question 1 ?
? Why ? I don?t see it,? persisted Tommy.
? Now, Captain Barton, don?t be a stick-in-
the-mud, but give us reasons.?
? My dear, it can?t be done,? said the
Captain emphatically.
? Of course it can?t, you haven?t got any,?
said Tommy, wilfully misunderstanding him.
? Just like a man I ?
?We should really like it, Uncle,? said
Elizabeth.
? Can?t be done, Bess,? he repeated.
? But why, Uncle ? ? asked Mary.
? Because ?because ?well, for one thing
I don?t carry a stewardess.?
? Oh, you funny old man I Bess could be
stewardess. Another reason, please.?
? There?s no cabin fit for young ladies.
It?s a hard life on board, and ?
? No reason at all,? interrupted Tommy.
? We must learn to rough it, now that we?ve
got to make our way in the world. Besides,
sea-air is good ; it will establish our constitu-


lions, as the doctors say. Say yes, Uncle,
there?s a dear ! ?
? Well, well, I?ll sleep on it,? said the
Captain, temporizing. He was really much
perplexed and troubled. The suggestion was
a preposterous one, to his old-fashioned way
of thinking ; but he could not find reasons
that would convince these very modern
nieces of his, and he hoped that they would
drop the wild notion before the morning.
But when the girls had gone to bed, and
he sat alone, smoking his final pipe, he had to
confess to himself that Tommy?s proposal
was the simplest solution of the difficulty.
It would not be an easy matter to find
comfortable quarters for the girls, but it was
not impossible. Their society would be very
pleasant on board ; he would love to have
them with him : in short, he decided to
give way. So the next morning, when they
rushed at him as he entered the breakfast-
room, with cries of ? Uncle dear, do take us,?
he replied, with a mild reluctance?
? Well, well, you might do worse.?
Whereupon Tommy kissed him and hugged
him, calling him ? Dear old Nunky,? and
went nearly wild with joy.
? But, mind you,? he said warningly,
? you mustn?t expect much in the way of
comfort. The Elizabeth isn?t the Lusitania,
you know. She?s as tight a little craft as


ever sailed the seas, but she wasn?t built for
first-class passengers. You?ll have to man-
age with a tiny cabin for all three. And I
give you fair notice : I keep strict discipline
aboard. The slightest insubordination will
be punished.?
? And how do you punish on board ship ? ?
asked Tommy mischievously.
? First, bread and water for a week. For
the second offence, you?ll be laid in irons in
the hold, where you?ll have no company but
the rats, and they?re uncommon hungry
beasts, I can tell you.?
? How lovely I Just like the prisoners in
wicked barons? castles in the olden times,?
cried Tommy. ? Oh, you dear silly old
thing, did you think you would frighten us ? ?
And she gave him a hug that made him cry
for mercy.
? Now, girls, to business,? he said, when
order was restored. ? This is Wednesday.
I must run up to London to-morrow to see
my lawyers, so that if anything happens to
me you won?t be quite unprovided for.
Remember, Bess, they?re Wilkins and Short,
of Bedford Row. Not that there isn?t plenty
of life in the old sea-dog yet, and I hope you
won?t have to see them for many a day.
Now, as to clothes ; no fal-lals, you know;
two serge dresses apiece, and one box for the
lot of you. I don?t suppose you bargained
for that.?


? We shouldn?t think of bringing matinee
hats,? said Elizabeth, laughing.
? Anything you want to keep, out of the
things here, you must pack up. I dare say
one of the neighbours will store it for you.
I?ll arrange about selling the rest. I?ll see
your landlord to-day. You will only have
about a fortnight to get ready, so you?d better
begin at once.?
? Let?s go and see Mrs. Morris,? said Mary.
? She?ll keep our things for us.?
? Won?t she be surprised ! ? cried Tommy.
? And what fun we shall have I ?
The girls found their neighbour, Mrs.
Morris, in the midst of her weekly baking.
She declared afterwards that the surprise
their news gave her nearly ? turned ? the
bread. She readily agreed to store their
little stock of personal possessions, but shook
her head at the idea of girls wandering in
heathen parts, as she put it.
Elizabeth asked her to accompany them
to Plymouth and assist them in buying their
outfit. This gave great delight to the kind
motherly soul. She left her farm but seldom;
a trip to Plymouth was a notable event in
her life ; and when she returned with the
girls, after a happy day?s shopping, the
spirit of adventure had so worked upon her
that she cried, 44 Well, now, I wish I was going?
too, that I do.? 6
Imagine the bustle and excitement of the


next few days I Uncle Ben was in London.
In his absence the girls worked hard at
their preparations. They got a sewing-maid
from the village, and all four worked early
and late cutting out and making two sets
of blouses, one for ordinary use, and the other
for any very hot weather they might en-
counter on the voyage. Even Tommy, not
usually an industrious young person in such
matters, did her fair share, though it was
a great trial of patience to have to finish
the overcasting of all the seams before
Elizabeth would lay them aside ready for
packing.
Everything was complete before Uncle
Ben?s return. The girls had finished their
outfit and packed it away neatly in their
new cabin trunk. Their treasures were also
packed ready to be handed into Mrs. Morris?s
keeping. A* few pieces of furniture which
Elizabeth could not bear to part with had
been warehoused at Plymouth. The remain-
der, together with the farm stock, was to
be sold after their departure. Tommy was
very woebegone at the idea of selling her
pony, and when Joe Morris offered to keep
him*for her, and give him his food in exchange
for his services (that was his thoughtful and
pleasant way of putting it), she hugged the
burly farmer and called him a dear old
man.
At last Uncle Ben returned. The last


arrangements were made, the last adieus
said, and one fine day the little party of
four drove to the station to take train to
Southampton, where the barque Elizabeth
was refitting. The girls waved their hand-
kerchiefs gaily in response to the parting
salutations of* the villagers ; but they fell
very silent when their old friends were out
of sight, and the Captain, looking straight
before him, heard a sob or two on each side
and behind. Like a vise man, he said
nothing about the sadness of leaving the
old home, but related some of his recent
experiences in London.
? I met a fine old friend of mine, a mis-
sionary,? he said. ?He is stationed on one
of the South Sea Islands, and hasn?t been
home for twenty years. A real good sort
is Henry Corke. He has only been home a
month, and yet he is going out almost at
once. There?s devotion for you, girls. I
asked him if he?d like to come with us, offered
him the attractions of refined female
society ?
? That was enough to choke him off,?
interrupted Tommy. ? I hate to be called a
female.?
? Well, perhaps it was a mistake not to say
tomboy. Anyhow, Corke was in too much
of a hurry to come with us ; prefers one of
those dirty clanking steamers. Mighty poor
taste, I call it.?


By the time they reached the station
the girls had thrown off their despondency,
and began to glow with excitement as they
realized that they were actually entering
upon a new life.


CHAPTER IV
ABOARD THE ? ELIZABETH ?
? Here we are I ? cried Captain Barton,
as the train ran into the dock station at
Southampton. ? Now mind you don?t get
run over.?
? The idea 1 ,5 said Tommy; ?we have been
here before, Uncle.?
?So you have, my dear, but good ad-
vice is none the worse for being said
twice.?
They made their way across the metals,
on which locomotives were hauling and
pushing heavy goods wagons, and came to
the quay where the Elizabeth lay taking in
cargo. She looked a mere dwarf beside a
Castle Liner not far away ; but she was
bright with the glory of new paint, and Cap-
tain Barton gazed at her with an affectionate
pride that he would never have felt for a
steamship. They went on board. Mr. Pur-
vis, the Scots mate, gave the girls a shy
greeting. They smiled at those of the crew
whom they recognized, and a look of pained
bewilderment settled on the face of one,
ii


Sandy Sam, when Tommy asked him if he
had any more big gooseberries. _ >}
44 Never mention the word to him, said
the Captain anxiously, as they went below;
44 he?s very sensitive, my dear.?
44 Ah 1 you?re afraid your stories will be
found out, you know you are,? replied
Tommy. ?Oh ! what a sweet little cabin.?
The Captain had thrown open the door
of the cabin which he had prepared for his
nieces, next to the saloon. The girls looked
in eagerly.
44 How very nice ! ? said Elizabeth.
44 I?m glad you like it, my dear,? said the
Captain. ? I did my best, and Purvis was
uncommon useful, too.?
44 A woman couldn?t have managed better,
said Mary.
44 Well, you see, bachelor men like me and
Purvis get into the way of making up for
what we lose. We nearly forgot the looking-
glass, though, not having any particular
features ourselves to be proud of.?
The cabin was very daintily got up. The
woodwork was beautifully polished. There
were two bunks on one side, one above the
other, and a third on the opposite side, each
with a spotless white bed-cover. On one wall
hung a looking-glass; and a tiny wash-hand
basin of polished zinc was fitted into a
little alcove. There were hooks for hanging
clothes on the partition. The clear space


between the sides was only two or three feet
across.
? Where shall we put our trunk ? ? asked
Elizabeth practically.
?In the saloon, my dear,? replied her
uncle. ? We?ll fasten it there, to prevent it
rolling about if we meet any rough weather.?
? We shall have to get up one at a time,?
said Tommy, with a laugh. ? There isn?t
room for two to do up their hair at
once.?
? Well, I know nothing about that,? said
the Captain, rubbing his bald crown. ? You
mustn?t quarrel or fight about who shall be
first, or I?ll have to clap you in irons.?
? Where do you keep your irons ? ? asked
Tommy. ? I?d like to see the dreadful
things.?
The Captain looked so much embarrassed
that Tommy divined the truth at once.
? Why, you haven?t got any,? she cried,
dancing. ? What a naughty old fibber you
are! ?
? Well, you see, I pick my crew. Them
that aren?t English are Scotch or Irish, and
very respectable men. But I dare say we
can get a set of irons in the town. Come
along, we?ll go and get something to eat;
we?re too busy to cook on board. I?ll just
drop in at one of the marine stores and see
if they?ve got a small size of irons for
obstreperous females.?


As they walked up the High Street
Tommy suddenly cried ?
? Look, Bess, isn?t that little Dan Whid-
don ? I wondered why he wasn?t at the
station to wish us good-bye.?
She pointed up the street, where she
had seen a small oddly-dressed figure pass
under the narrow ancient arch that divides
the street into Above and Below Bar. They
hurried in that direction, but when they
reached the spot the figure had disappeared.
? I think you must have been mistaken,?
said Mary. ? Dan wouldn?t come so far from
home.?
? I dare say. Now, Uncle, where shall we
go ? I?m famished.?
The Captain led them to the Crown Hotel.
He confessed that if he had been alone he
would have gone to a humbler place near the
docks, where he might meet some shipmates.
? But you girls wouldn?t like to eat among
half-a-dozen sea-dogs smoking shag,? he
said.
As they ate their luncheon he said that
he was disappointed with his cargo. He
had hoped to have a full ship for the South
American ports, but feared that after all
he would have to go out light. Tommy?s
assurance that his passengers would make
up did not appear to convince him.
They slept on board that night, and were
very merry at the novel experience of un-


dressing and dressing in such a narrow space.
Early next morning the ship was towed out
into the harbour. She had hardly made a
cable?s length, however, when the Captain
received a message semaphored from the
quay to the effect that his agent had secured
enough goods to complete his freight. It
would not be ready for shipment for two days.
He did not think it worth while to put back
into dock, as the extra cargo could be brought
out in lighters.
During the next two days the girls were
much amused to see their uncle in his little
dinghy, which held three at a squeeze, going
to and fro between the ship and the shore,
propelling himself by means of one oar fixed
in a groove at the stern. Nothing would
satisfy them until he allowed one of the
sailors, usually Sunny Pat, to take them in
turn and teach them how to work the little
tub in this manner. Finding it very easy
Tommy begged the Captain to let her take
him ashore, and was delighted when he told
her on landing that she would make a skipper
in no time. She immediately bought a huge
sailor?s knife, much to his amusement. Her
sisters, not to be outdone, in their turn
rowed him ashore, and each also bought a
knife.
? You?d be terrible folk in a mutiny,? said
the Captain, laughing. ? I really must see
about getting those irons.?


But when the vessel?s hold was filled
from the lighters, and the cargo was com-
plete, there were no irons among the equip-
ment. The Elizabeth was towed down
Southampton Water; then, the wind being
fair, the courses were set, and she w r as soon
sailing merrily dow r n Channel. The girls
w r ere in the highest spirits. It w r as a glorious
day. The sea glistened in the sunlight, and
as the vessel passed through the Solent,
with the wooded shores of Hampshire on
the right, and the Island on the left, the
Captain pointed out to his nieces various
landmarks and interesting spots, and gave
them a first lesson in navigation. In three
or four hours they passed the Needles.
? Now, girls,? said the Captain, ?my
advice is, keep fairly quiet for a little.
There?s a bit of a swell, and ?well, I say no
more.?
Elizabeth and Mary remained reclining
in their deck-chairs, quietly enjoying their
novel experiences. But Tommy w T as as
nimble as Ariel on the vessel of the Duke of
Milan. She here, there and everywhere,
asking why this and what the other; now
exclaiming at a worship that glided silently
past, now w r atching a graceful white-sailed
yacht ; at one moment standing by the
helmsman, then flashing along the deck to
ask her uncle for an explanation of some-
thing that had caught her attention. The


Captain watched her with kindly amuse-
ment. He did not repeat his warning.
? The lass had better get it over,? he
thought. Presently his amusement became
mixed with a little anxiety as he saw her
growing quieter, and a tinge of green coming
into her complexion. At last with a sudden
cry of ? Oh I ? she rushed to the companion
and disappeared. The other girls followed
her anxiously, and for a time they were seen
no more. Thanks to the steadiness of the
ship, and the comparative smoothness of the
sea, their sufferings were neither violent
nor prolonged; but it was a much-subdued
Tommy who emerged an hour or two later
and meekly put her hand into her uncle?s.
The next moment she gave a gasp. Not
a yard away, lying on a pile of canvas,
huddled a little figure in brown corduroys and
clumping boots. It was Dan Whiddon, pale,
grimy, with tear-stained eyes, fast asleep.
? There?s a young Samson for you! ?
said the Captain, noticing Tommy?s look of
amazement. ? A young rascal of a stowaway.
Long Jimmy heard a tapping in the forehold
a while ago, and when the men opened up ?a
nuisance when all the cargo was nattily
stowed ?there was this young reprobate,
half dead with hunger and fright. You?ve
a deal to answer for, Tommy.?
? Why, what have I done ? ? asked the
girl.


? Well, you and your sisters seem to have
spoiled the young scamp. When they
brought him up from below he whimpered
out that the young ladies had been kind to
him, and he Uun?t like carrying luggage and
cleaning railway lamps, and when he heard
that you were coming to sea he wanted
his mother to get me to take him as a cabin-
boy. She boxed his ears. But he found
out when you were leaving, and hid in a
goods wagon that reached Southampton
a little before we did, and watched his op-
portunity to slip on board when the barque
was lying at the quay-side. That?s all I got
out of him; and the motion served him as it
serves most landsmen, and he dropped asleep
just where you see him there. I?ll have
something to say to him when he wakes.?
? Poor little fellow I ? said Tommy. ? You
won?t be hard on him, Uncle ? ?
The Captain grunted. Perhaps he re-
membered that fifty years before he had
himself run away to sea.
? A rascally young stowaway,? he mut-
tered. ? I can?t put him ashore, as I shan?t
touch at any port this side of Buenos Ayres.
And his mother crying her eyes out, I?ll be
bound. And I?ll have to spend several
shillings on a cable to tell her he?s safe. A
pretty thing for a man with three nieces.?
? I?ll pay for the cable, Uncle.?
? What ! has she damaged the cable ? ?


asked Mary innocently, coming up at this
moment.
Captain Barton shook with laughter.
? Oh, you bookworms 1 ? he said, when he
had command of his breath. ? Take a look
at the cable, Mary, and see if you think
Tommy, for all her mischievousness, could
do it much damage. No, ?tis another kind
of cable we were speaking of ?all along of
young Samson there. What would you do
with a stowaway, Bess ? ? he asked of his
eldest niece, who had just joined the others.
? Good gracious ! ? exclaimed Elizabeth,
? you were right after all, Tommy. What a
little sweep he looks ! ?
At this moment Dan stirred, opened his
eyes, and when he saw the girls smiled
sheepishly.
? Now, young Samson, stand up and
listen to me,? said the Captain severely.
? Lay a hold of that stay there if you can?t
stand steady. You come sneaking aboard
this vessel, ruining my cargo, expecting to
fill yourself with my victuals, and all for
what ? Because you didn?t like cleaning
lamps and carrying luggage. What?s that
for a reason ? There?s worse than that
aboard ship, I can tell you. If I did my
duty, I should have you lashed to the mast
and dosed with the cat. And your poor
mother crying her eyes out, and the police
dragging the ponds, and the Government


sending detectives to all parts, and wiring
to all the recruiting sergeants, spending
hundreds of pounds of the country?s money
all for a discontented young shaver not four
feet high. Now just you run along to Mr.
Purvis and ask him to forgive you. He?s
very strict is Mr. Purvis, much stricter than
I am; and then ask Sandy Sam very politely
to fling a few buckets of water over you
and scrub you with holystone ; and after
that go to Cook and ask him if he can spare
a biscuit and a can of soup; and then I?ll
see if I can find some clothes that will fit
you, and weil make a man of you, and an
A.B. in time.?
The Captain?s tone grew less stern and more
genial as he went along, and when he had
finished Dan smiled cheerfully, gave Tommy
an extra smile, and went aft to obey orders.
The run down Channel was very pleasant
to the girls. They showed the keenest
interest in the ship and the doings of the
sailors. These rough, good-tempered fellows
were flattered by the attentions of their
passengers, and never tired of answering
their questions. It was not long before
all three were able to tie all kinds of sailors?
knots, splice ropes, and do other simple
things of the kind. They knew the names
of the sails and the yards, and Tommy in
particular never tired of airing her nautical
vocabulary.


Even the ship?s cook became their willing
slave. Elizabeth took him in hand, and he
meekly received her instructions, with great
advantage to his bill of fare. Captain
Barton declared that it was a good job he
was retiring, for this unwonted luxury was
killing his seaman?s qualities.
The evenings were spent in the little deck
cabin, where they played at draughts with
the Captain and mate, or listened to the
yarns they spun. Mary had brought her
mandoline, and on fine evenings they would
get up a concert, the sailors singing their
chanties and dancing the hornpipe. The
Captain hunted up some ancient grass ham-
mocks, and when the weather was quite calm
the sailors rigged these up on deck for the
girls. Some of the crew taught them how
to make hammocks, using string instead of
grass, and they often amused themselves
by weaving string bags and baskets.
As for Dan Whiddon, he soon became the
pet of the ship. He was a good-tempered
little fellow, willing to oblige anybody.
He was kept always busy, and it was not
long before he found that the life of a sailor
was a good deal harder even than that of
a porter at a wayside station.
? But I likes it, I do,? he said once to
Tommy, ? better?n cleaning lamps and such.?
? You get no tips, Dan,? she replied.
u What?s tips 1? he said. ? I never had


no good of ?em, miss. Mother took them
all except a penny now and then for sweets,
and the Captain he gives me sweets for
nothing, he do, and so I save, don?t I, miss ? ?
The weather held fair almost without
interruption, and the girls became so well
seasoned that an occasional gale did not dis-
tress them. As they approached the tropics
the heat became rather trying, and then
they brought out of their trunk sundry light
blouses at which their uncle cocked an eye.
? Rank disobedience I ? he said sternly.
? I said serge.?
? Don?t they look nice, Uncle ? ? said
Tommy mischievously, ? and we made them
ourselves. You can?t object to that, my
dear man, and we shall wash them ourselves,
so there?s no laundry bill for you to pay.
In fact, you haven?t a leg to stand on, so you
had better say at once they look sweet and
save time. Don?t you think so, Mr. Purvis ? ?
?Weel,? said the Scotsman cautiously,
? I wouldna say but what they are suitable
to the climate, but they?re terrible gay like.?
? Oh, you should see Bess?s evening frock.
It?s perfectly lovely?chiffon, with pink in-
sertion; it suits her dark hair splendidly.?
? There, Tommy, that?ll do,? said the
Captain; ?such talk isn?t suitable aboard
this vessel. You?re unruly minxes, and
what I?ll do with you in London I don?t
know.?


? You?ll soon get used to it, Uncle dear,
and I really wouldn?t worry if I were you.
We?ll keep you straight.?
?A happy girl, Purvis,? said the Captain,
when they were alone.
? Ou, ay, she is that.?
They spent a couple of days in Buenos
Ayres while Captain Barton was unloading
part of his cargo and settling his affairs.
When they left, a certain young electrical
engineer asked to be allowed to call on
them when he returned to England, and
looked very crestfallen when Elizabeth told
him that they had no address. They were
almost disappointed when they rounded
the terrible Cape Horn without encountering
a storm. After a short stay at Valparaiso,
the Captain set his course direct for the
Pacific Islands. Interested as the girls had
been hitherto, they became intensely excited
now. Mary knew a great deal about Captain
Cook and other early navigators, and all the
girls had read a volume of Stevenson?s on
the South Seas, which their uncle had brought
home once in a colonial edition. The romance
of this quarter of the globe had captured their
imagination, and they looked eagerly for-
ward to seeing the strange men and women,
the gorgeous scenery, the many novel things
which their reading and their uncle?s stories
had led them to expect.


CHAPTER V
A MIDNIGHT WRECK
? Well, now, I?m real glad I brought you
girls with me,? said Captain Barton, as they
sat on deck one evening. ? Many?s the time
I?ve felt a bit lonesome at night between
sunset and turning in, but you do help to pass
the time away.?
? Pastimes, are we ? ? said Tommy, with
affected indignation. ? Toys 1 Dolls I I
won?t be called a doll.?
? Very well, my dear, you shan?t,? replied
her uncle, slipping one arm round her waist,
and the other round Mary?s. Elizabeth
sat on her deck-chair opposite them, knitting
the second of a pair of socks. ? But, now,?
continued the Captain, ? you?d better be
turning in. ?Tis latish, and sleep, you know,
? it is a precious thing, beloved from pole to
pole and if you don?t get your full eight
hours you?ll be neither useful nor ornamental,
Miss Tommy.?
? Oh, Uncle I It?s such a lovely night,?
pleaded Tommy, leaning back on his arm,
and looking up into the brilliant sky?a sky
54


such as is seen in the South Pacific, and
nowhere else in the world.
Here a heavy figure approached the group
from forward.
? Glass is dropping fast, sir,? said Mr.
Purvis.
Elizabeth?s needles ceased clicking.
? That means a storm, doesn?t it, Uncle ? ?
she said.
? A bit of a blow, maybe,? said the
Captain. ? Now, girls, off with you. I?ll
just make things snug. You go below, and
sleep through it, and you?ll come up fresh as
paint in the morning.?
Tommy grumbled a little, declaring that
a storm was impossible with such a clear
sky and no wind; but she went below with
her sisters, and soon all three were fast asleep
in their snug little cabin.
It was perhaps two hours later when
Elizabeth awoke suddenly. There were
strange noises overhead, and the ship was
rolling and pitching with a violence new to
her. Every now and then she heard a
hoarse shout, and a scurry of feet on deck.
The little appointments of the cabin rattled,
and presently, as the vessel gave a particu-
larly heavy lurch, the glass water-bottle
slipped from its rack, and fell with a crash to
the floor.
? What is it ? ? cried Tommy, sitting
straight up in her bunk.


? The sea is rather rough,? said Ehzabeth
quietly, ? and has sent the water-bottle
spinning.?
? It woke me with a start,? said Tommy.
?My heart is thumping like anything. Is
there any danger ? ?
? Not with Uncle on board,? said Mary
from the bunk below. ? Let?s go to sleep
again.?
They lay down, but to sleep was impossible.
Every moment the movements of the vessel
became more violent, and they heard great
booming noises as the waves broke over the
deck. The roar and shriek of the wind was
mingled with the creaking of blocks and the
shouts of men.
? I can?t stand it any longer,? said Tommy
suddenly. ? I?m going up to see. Come
along, girls.? She sprang out of her bunk
and had to clutch the side to prevent herself
from being thrown down. The other girls
followed her, and she laughed as they
staggered and clasped each other.
? What fun ! ? she said. ?We haven?t
had a real storm before. See who?ll be
dressed first. You two needn?t do up your
hair.?
Dressing was a difficult matter; but,
helping one another, they managed to get
their things on at last and, holding hands,
staggered out of the cabin to the companion-
way between it and the saloon. Tommy was


the to climb the ladder, but when she
came to the top she gave a cry of dismay.
? The hatch is on 1 ? she called. ? Uncle
has battened us down, mean old thing I ?
She beat on the hatch with her fist, and
called shrilly for her uncle ; but the sounds
were smothered by the greater noises above,
and by and by she desisted, and tottered
disconsolately down the steps. ? Let?s go
into the saloon,? she said. ? There?s more
room there than in the cabin. You don?t
think there?s any danger ? ? she added, as
the light of the swinging lamp fell on Eliza-
beth?s pale face.
? I don?t know ; I hope not,? replied
Elizabeth.
? It?s a shame to batten us down,? said
Tommy indignantly. ? I?d rather be on
deck and know the worst.?
The three girls went into the saloon, and sat
huddled together on a sofa, which was fixed
firmly to the wall. They found that only by
keeping a tight grip on the sofa, and each
other, could they save themselves from being
dashed across the room. Moment by mo-
ment the storm increased in fury. Now and
again there was a tremendous shock, under
which the Elizabeth quivered in every plank,
and sometimes a sharp report as of woodwork
wrenched away.
The girls were now thoroughly scared.
Pressed close together they shivered as they


heard these ominous noises. None of them
spoke, but Tommy gave a little gasp when-
ever a more than usually heavy sea struck
the vessel, and Mary gulped down a lump
that would keep rising in her throat.
Hours passed. Presently the movements
of the vessel became less violent, and at last
Tommy gave a cry of delight as she heard
the battens being struck away from the
hatch, and her uncle?s voice as he descended
the ladder.
?Ah I There you are, my dears,? he said
cheerily, as he entered the saloon. ? I
guessed these little tantrums would have
wakened you.?
?Is the storm over, Uncle ? ? asked
Elizabeth.
? Pretty near. He?s giving a last kick or
two. We?re very tired and hungry on deck,
and you girls can make us some coffee ; I
know you?d like to make yourselves useful.
Cook can?t be spared at this minute or I
wouldn?t ask you.?
? Of course we will,? said Tommy, spring-
ing up.
? Is there much damage done, Uncle ?
asked Mary.
? Damage I Why, bless you, you can?t
fight without getting a bruise or two, even
if you win. The craft?s had a bit of knocking
about, I won?t deny, but what could you
expect ? Now make the coffee, there?s good


lassies, and knock at the hatch when it?s
ready.?
? You are not going to batten us down
again ? ? cried Tommy.
? Well, you see, we don?t want everything
slopped about below, do we ? The coffee
wouldn?t be worth drinking if a sea washed
into it just as you were bringing it up.
Make it strong, mind, and plenty of sugar.?
Captain Barton left them. He had not
thought it necessary to say that the cook,
who couldn?t be spared to make the coffee,
was working hard at the pumps. Nor that
the vessel had lost its foremast, which in its
fall had carried away the boats on the leeward
side. While the ship was staggering under
this blow a heavy sea had struck her and
stove in the boats on the weather side.
Nor did the Captain mention that the storm
had driven him many leagues out of his
course, and that he was desperately anxious
lest he should have come within the region
of the coral reefs. Until daybreak he had
no means of ascertaining his whereabouts,
and he concealed from his nieces the anxiety
with which he awaited the dawn.
He had paid his brief visit below merely
to reassure the girls. They at once set about
making the coffee?no easy task, for though
the wind had abated there was still a heavy
sea. At last it was ready, and Tommy
mounted the companion-way, carrying a


canful. It was some time before her
hammering on the hatch attracted attention,
and when it was lifted the can was taken
from her by her uncle, who said ? Thank?ee,
my lass. Now go down again and have
some breakfast; it will be light in an hour
or two.?
? Can?t we come up, Uncle ? ?
? Not yet, my dear; we must tidy up first,
you know.?
? Can?t we help ? ? persisted Tommy.
But there was no answer. Captain Barton
had clapped on the hatch.
? Poor little lassies I ? he said to himself.
The girls drank some coffee, and ate some
biscuits, waiting impatiently for their release.
It was no longer difficult to keep their seats;
the howling of the wind had ceased, and the
noise above gradually diminished, and the
vessel steadied. But now they were con-
scious of a sound that they had not heard
before. It was like the clanking of a steam-
engine.
? I wonder what it is ! ? cried Tommy,
springing up. ? Oh, I do so wash Uncle
would let us go up. There?s no danger now,
surely.?
But the Captain still remained above. The
clanking sound continued, and slight noises
were heard occasionally. The weather be-
came still calmer, and the girls, when they
had finished their simple breakfast, began to


doze. Never since they left Southampton
had their sleep been broken, and they would
have returned to their bunks had it not been
so near morning. So they cuddled up to-
gether on the sofa, Elizabeth in the middle
and the other girls with their arms about her.
All at once there was a sudden jolt that
set the tin cups flying from the table, and
made the girls spring up in alarm. They
were aware of a strange, rasping, scraping
sound. Clutching one another, their startled
faces asked a mute question, to which, in-
experienced as they were, their instinct sup-
plied a clear answer. The ship had struck.
There were loud shouts from above, a
renewal of the scurrying on deck, then
silence. A minute or two after the girls
heard the hatch removed, and their uncle
hurried down. Even in the dim light of the
smoky oil lamp they saw how pale and
haggard he looked. They were too much
frightened to speak.
? Girls,? he said quietly, ? put on your
macintoshes and anything warm you have,
and come on deck at once. Don?t wait for
anything else.?
lie was gone. The very calmness of his
tone, the absence of his wonted jocularity,
struck them with a chill feeling of dread!
Silently, with pale faces, the girls fetched
wraps and macintoshes from their cabin and
hurriedly mounted the companion. When


they reached the wet and slippery deck a
terrible spectacle lay before them in the
light of the crescent moon, shining fitfully
out through the scudding clouds. The fore-
mast had snapped off at the height of a man.
The deck was strewn with broken spars and
a Utter of torn sails and shattered rigging.
On the lee side the davits were twisted
and bent, and the boats had disappeared.
On the weather side, the boats still swung
on the ropes, but were so battered that it
was impossible to hope that they were sea-
worthy. Three or four men were loosing
the lashings that secured the Uttle dinghy,
others were bringing up provisions from
the cook?s galley. The monotonous clank ,
clank of the pumps told how the rest were
engaged.
Close to the dinghy stood Uttle Dan Whid-
don, the cabin-boy, shivering with cold
and fear.
? Show a leg, now I ? cried the Captain to
the men who were busy 'with the dinghy.
He turned to the girls, who stood near the
companion, huddled in speechless terror.
?You must get into the dinghy, my dears,?
he said gravely; ? we have struck a reef.
You can scull her, keep her going gently and
look out for a passing ship. Don?t be
alarmed. The sea is smooth, you see. We
will make a raft and come after you as soon
as we can. My poor old ship is done for.?


?Oh I we can?t leave you, Uncle,? said
Elizabeth, with quivering lips.
? No, we won?t,? cried Tommy, springing
forward and clasping his arm.
? Now, my dears,? replied the Captain
with forced cheerfulness, ? you promised to
obey orders, you know. We can?t save the
ship. Water is pouring into her ; the one
chance is to get you safely afloat while we
make a raft. You must go for my sake.
There must be land hereabouts; you?ll see it
when the sun gets up, and I lay you won?t
be ashore an hour before we join you. Come
along now, all?s ready.?
The Captain?s firmness showed that further
remonstrance was vain. He led them to the
side where the dinghy had been lowered.
Elizabeth was helped into it, and as she
turned away, after embracing her uncle,
she heard the first mate say?
D ye think there?s room for young Dan,
sir ? He?s no use to us.?
The Captain hesitated for a moment.
Three was a full complement for the little
boat, and even the boy?s fight extra weight
might be a source of danger. Mary, as she
kissed her uncle, heard the boatswain growl?
? You may as well drown the lot ; the
dinghy can?t take more than three nohow.?
Then Tommy flung herself into her uncle?s
arms, and sobbed a good-bye.
? Now, my little lass,? said he, ? bear up.


Brave?s the word. There?s One above will
look after you. Good-bye ? Nonsense !
I?ll see you soon, never fear. Now, steady
?there you go ?now, where?s that boy ?
But Dan Whiddon, hearing the pessimistic
boatswain?s words, had slipped away in the
darkness.
The Captain called him, but he did not
reappear.
? Well, perhaps it?s as said the
Captain. ? Now, girls, don?t tire yourselves
out; lay by till daylight. God bless you ! ?
Elizabeth silently took the sculls, the
other tw r o crouched in the bottom of the
boat, which drew slowly away from the ill-
fated ship. After a little Tommy sprang
up.
? Stop rowing, Bess,? she cried. ? It?s
no use going on in the dark. Keep close
to the ship, so that can see Uncle when
he puts off on the raft.?
Elizabeth rested on her oars. There was
reason in wdiat Tommy had said. For a
time the girls could see the trembling masts
of the ship in the moonlight, and dark
figures moving about the deck; but presently
the moon w r as obscured; some minutes
passed before it again emerged from the
clouds; and then, when the girls looked for
the Elizabeth , there w r as not a trace of her
to be seen.
The two younger girls were now sitting


up in the boat, facing their sister. They
looked with wild eyes into the darkness.
The same terrible thought oppressed them
all: had the barque gone down already ?
Had there been time for the construction
of a raft ? They dared not speak, lest their
spoken fears should overwhelm them.
Elizabeth sculled now in this direction, now
in that, in the hope that it was merely dis-
tance that had removed the ship from sight.
Now and again she rested on her oars and
listened ; but there was no sound in the
breathless stillness, and she dipped her oars
again; inaction was unbearable. So the
three miserable girls waited for the dawn.
It came at last with almost startling
suddenness. At one moment all the sky
was indigo with gleaming spots ; the next,
u s P a ngles had disappeared, and
the blue was covered with a curtain of grey.
But daybreak did not bring with it the
expected relief from suspense?a light mist
hung upon the surface of the sea?a tantaliz-
ing filmy screen which the eye could not
penetrate. The boat floated idly; again the
girls eagerly strained their ears for sounds
of voices, or creaking tackle, or working oars;
but they heard nothing except the slow rip-
P � n 6 SCa a B ain ? t the side of the dinghy.
u * ud � Bess,? cried Tommy frantically.
u e can t have come far. Row about ?
we must find the ship.?


Elizabeth, though hope was dead within
her, rowed this way and that, but every-
where was the encircling mist; there was no
sign of vessel, raft or land.
?We had better wait until the sun is
up,? she said at last. ?It will scatter the
mist, and then we can at least see our way.?
The air was growing warmer, with a
damp clammy heat; but the girls shivered
as they sat silent in the gently rocking
boat. The grey mist turned to a golden
dust, and presently the sun burst through,
putting the thinning vapour to flight. Now
the girls eagerly scanned the horizon as it
widened, but neither hull nor sail stood
out of the immense tract of blue. Tommy
rose in the boat, to see if she could then
descry any dark patch upon the surface
which might be a raft; but there was nothing.
Her lips quivered as the meaning of this vast
blankness forced itself upon her mind. For a
few moments she stood with her back to hei
sisters; then turning suddenly, she said, with a
laugh that was not very different from a sob ?
? 4 There were three sailors of Bristol
City.? I say, how should Ido for the part
of Little Billee ? ?
This sudden touch of comedy relieved the
tension, as Tommy intended. The other
girls smiled feebly, and Tommy, saying to
herself, ? I must talk, talk, or we shall all
go mad,? went on ?


? Could I have a swim, do you think ? ? She
flung off her macintosh. ? It?s getting hot.?
?Oh, you mustn?t think of it,? said Mary;
? these waters are full of sharks,?
? Well, then, let?s have another breakfast.
What have they given us ? ?
While Elizabeth was examining the pro-
visions placed in the boat Tommy leant
over the side and dashed handfuls of water
over her face.
. ?There J Now I feel better,? she said.
What is there, Bess ? ?
There were tins of biscuits, sardines, and
condensed milk, a bottle of coffee extract,
three tin cups, a spirit lamp, a small tin
kettle, a tea-caddy half full, a small box of
sugar, a large plum cake, some boiled bacon,
and two gallon jars containing water.
?? * not hungry at present,? said
Elizabeth.
. Neither am I, but one must do some-
thing, said Tommy; ? a cup of water and
a slice of cake for me.?
They all took a draught of water, but
OI 7 4 y xT � mi s y made any pretence of eating.
Now, Bess,? said Tommy as she gulped
down her crumbs of cake, ? we?ll take turns
? rOW i u Lne e ? Her voice broke ; she
cleared her throat and continued?? Uncle
said there must be land somewhere near,
there first.^ n US ? Wful slackers if he B ets


? We can?t tell which way to go,? said
Mary. . ,
? Of course we can?t, but we must choose
a direction and stick to it, or we shall go
round in a circle like a dog chasing its tail.
? O? a? the airts the wind can blaw
I dearly lo?e the West.?
Let?s make for the west, and take our
chance.? ,
This suggestion was adopted. Elizabeth
admired her small sister?s pluck in being so
determinedly cheerful. They turned their
faces to the sun, and for some time rowed
steadily westward, each girl taking a spell
at the oars. But as the day grew older the
heat became intolerable and exertion pain-
ful, so they decided to rest until the evening.
None of them any longer expected to see the
raft, though none confessed it; all they
hoped for was to find land. They were very
much cramped in the little boat, but none
grumbled about the discomforts. By and
by it occurred to Elizabeth to rig up their
macintoshes as a sort of awning, supporting
it on the oars and the boat-hook, and this
sheltered them from the worst effects of the
sun. They made another spare meal in the
afternoon, and when the sun was between
south and west they resumed their rowing.
So far there had not been a sign of land;
but Uncle Ben had certainly said that the
ship had struck on a reef, and where there were


reefs dry land could hardly be far away. This
hope buoyed them up through the hot day.
The sun went down below the horizon
with the suddenness general in the South-
ern Ocean. Once more darkness was upon
them. With the return of night came a
sense of forlornness and desolation of spirit.
They fell silent, each brooding on the sad
fate which had overtaken their uncle and
them. The night was cold ; enveloped in
their wraps and macintoshes they huddled
together for warmth, letting the boat drift
at the mercy of the sea. Their broken sleep
on the previous night, and their exertions
and anxieties during the day, had told upon
them, and after some hours the tw r o younger
girls fell asleep. Elizabeth dared not sur-
render herself to slumber. Who could tell
what might happen ? As the eldest, she
felt a motherly responsibility for the others,
though she had to confess to herself how
utterly helpless she was if danger came.
She sat with her elbows on her knees, think-
mg, brooding. Everything had happened so
suddenly that she was only just beginning to
realize the immensity of the disaster. A
cockle-shell of a boat, that would capsize if
the sea were the least bit rough; the wide
ocean all around; three girls, healthy enough
but not mured to hardship; the possibility
of drifting for days or weeks, never touching
land or coming within the track of a ship-


food dwindling day by day; the horrors of
thirst: these dreadful images flashed in turn
upon Elizabeth?s mental vision and made
her shudder.
? Why didn?t we stay with Uncle ? ? she
thought ; and then the remembrance of the
dear old man, and their happy days on board,
and her conviction that the vessel had gone
down before the raft could be made, smote
Elizabeth?s heart with grief, and for the first
time the tears rolled down her cheeks,
unchecked.
She wept till her head ached, and she felt
dazed. At last, utterly worn out, she dozed
into an uneasy and fitful sleep, still support-
ing her head on her hands. She woke every
few minutes, blamed herself for not keeping
a better watch, then slumbered again. She
was startled into wakefulness by the rays
of the early morning sun. Lifting herself
stiffly, and carefully, so as not to disturb the
two girls at her feet, she looked around, and
was alarmed as she caught sight of a ring of
white within a few hundred yards of the
starboard side of the boat. At the first
glance she recognized the foam of breakers
dashing over a reef.
? Girls 1 ? she cried, ? wake up I Quick I ?
She released herself from them, seized the
sculls, and pulled energetically away from
the threatened danger. Tommy threw off
her macintosh and stood up in the boat.


? Land I ? she cried. ? Look, Mary, be-
yond the breakers there. Woods I Oh I I
could scream for joy.?
? Look out for a landing-place,? said
Elizabeth, as she rowed slowly parallel with
the reef.
? What if there are savages ? ? murmured
Mary.
? Oh, we?ll soothe their savage breasts,?
cried Tommy confidently. ? I don?t care if
there are so long as my feet are on dry land
again. Can you see the raft ? ?
There was no sign of a raft ; nothing
was in sight but the foam-swept reef, the
cliffs, and the dark background of woods
behind.
A pull of half-a-mile brought the dinghy
clear of the breakers, and the girls saw the
sea dashing up the face of the Mgh weather-
worn cliffs. There appeared to be no beach,
no possible landing-place. Mary, the book-
worm of the family, began to fear that the
land was only one of those precipitous crags
of which she had read, inaccessible from
the sea. But in a few minutes they dis-
cerned to their joy a gap in the cliffs, and a
sandy cove that promised an easy landing-
place.
To this Elizabeth turned the dinghy?s
head. A shark glided by as they neared
the shore, but was almost unnoticed in their
excitement. Tommy gave a cheer as the


boat grated on the sand. In a moment she
was out; her sisters followed more deliber-
ately ; then the three together, exerting all
their strength, dragged the boat toilsomely
up the beach.

CHAPTER VI
THE ISLAND BEAUTIFUL
Hot and panting from their exertions,
the girls threw themselves down on the sand,
and for a time remembered nothing but their
escape from what had seemed certain death
But presently Tommy sprang up, and,
shading her eyes against the sun?s fierce
glare, looked long and anxiously seaward.
An irregular white line marked the reef,
but beyond that the ocean stretched out
into the distance, without a spot upon its
glistening surface. Her sisters joined her,
and, with their arms clasped about each
other, they searched the horizon for the raft
and Uncle Ben. None of them spoke : each
was afraid to utter her foreboding thought.
Then they turned and gazed at the green
woodland that rose almost from the brink
of the sea. It was a perfect day, and the
land to which they had come might well be
a paradise of the South Seas such as they
had read about. But they were too anxious
to be aware of its beauties. Mary caught
Elizabeth by the arm.


? Are there people ? ? she said in a
whisper.
? Savages, perhaps cannibals ? ? said
Tommy, with a shiver.
They stood holding each other, afraid to
stir. Elizabeth for a moment had a wild
notion of dragging the boat down again, and
putting to sea in the hope of meeting Uncle
Ben ; dread of the unknown had possession
of her. But she recognized that so to act
would be foolish, and crushing down her
fears, she said quietly ?
? I think we had better look about a little;
perhaps Uncle has already landed.?
Hope springs up easily in young minds.
?Of course,? said Tommy valiantly.
? Who?s afraid ! I?no, you go first, Bess,
as you?re the biggest. I know; you take
an oar, and Mary another, and I?ll take the
boat-hook.?
Thus armed, after making the boat secure,
they took their way up the strand, through a
gap in the wooded cliffs that seemed to have
been carved out in some past time by a
stream. They walked slowly and timidly, as
if half expecting to find a savage lurking
behind every bush or tree. But as they
went on, and found no wild islanders to
molest them, they began to be more aware
of the beauty of their surroundings. On
either hand there was a riot of splendid
vegetation. Strange plants and trees, some


bearing brilliant flowers, others tempting
fruits, grew in magnificent profusion, and
birds gorgeous in colour flitted from tree
to tree.
Here were feathery palms, there a cluster
of small trees like hazels ; all about, the
ground was carpeted with masses of con-
volvulus and creeping plants innumerable,
and the air was heavy with mingled scents.
? What a lovely place I ? said Mary.
? Not to us,? said Tommy. ?We might
as well be in a desert. Oh, 'what?s that ? I
saw something move.?
She pointed to the right hand, and for a
moment the girls held their breath. Then
they laughed, but very nervously; the some-
thing was nothing but a little animal, of
what kind they knew not, that scuttled away
into the woodland.
They went on again, becoming less timid
the farther they advanced, for there was no
sight or sound to alarm them. They began
to talk more freely, but always in low tones.
? I suppose it is an island,? said Tommy.
?It must be,? replied Mary. ? There is
no other land until you get to Australia, and
that?s thousands of miles away.?
? Then what shall we do if we don?t find
Uncle ? ?
The question recalled to them all that
had happened, and again they felt the
bitterness of misery and despair.


?We must keep up our spirits,? said
Elizabeth, trying to speak cheerfully. ?At
any rate we shan?t starve if these fruits are
good to eat.?
? I don?t see any breadfruit,? said Mary.
? Well, it looks as if we are to be Crusoes,?
said Tommy, ? only Crusoe was alone. Good-
ness 1 I couldn?t bear to be alone. I should
go mad. Do you think Uncle will find us,
Bess ? ?
? I hope and trust he will, dear. We are
safe; why shouldn?t he be ? Don?t let?s look
on the black side of things. Shall we go back
to the boat and eat some of the food we
brought ? It won?t keep like the fruits.
Then we had better rest; I?m sure you are
worn out; we can look round again presently,
when the sun isn?t so hot.?
They returned to the boat, and made a
meal of some biscuit and cold bacon, carving
the bacon somewhat clumsily with their jack-
knives, remembering how their uncle had
laughed at them for buying such manlike
implements.
? I?m terribly thirsty,? said Tommy. ? I
wonder if the water in the stream there is
good to drink I ?
She pointed to a brook that meandered
down to the shore from amid the woodland
above, purling musically, and flashing like
silver in the sunlight.
? There?s not much fear of that,? said


Mary. ? I?ll get some while you cut me
another slice of bacon.?
The water was delightfully fresh and cool,
proving that there was a spring somewhere
in the interior.
Having made a heartier meal than any
of them expected to make, they lay down
under the shade of a large tree, and talked
until they fell asleep from sheer fatigue.
The air was much cooler when they awoke.
At Mary?s suggestion they climbed to the
highest point of the cliffs, from which they
could command a wide prospect over the sea.
When they reached the summit, they scanned
the surface, now as smooth as a'lake, for
signs of boat or raft; but nothing was in
sight, except far away several dusky spots
which Mary at once declared must be other
islands.
. ? Ver y likely we drifted past them in the
night, said Elizabeth. ? Look at that mass
of floating seaweed just beyond the reef ;
you see there is quite a strong current.?
? If we went as fast as that in the dinghy,
we must have come miles from where the
wreck happened,? said Tommy. ? And
Uncle won?t know; he?ll never find us.?
At this the shadow of their misfortune once
more descended on them, and they turned
away from each other to hide their distress,
then Tommy swung round and cried?
I won t be a baby ! Bess, if you see


any sign of waterworks again, smack me.
What?s the good of crying ? Let?s go ex-
ploring ; that?ll help to keep off the blues.?
But in spite of their brave attempts, they
veered between hopefulness and despondency
all the rest of the day. They roamed here
and there, not really going very far, for they
still felt safer within easy distance of their
boat. More than once they returned to the
cliff to search the horizon longingly for any
sign of ship or boat, but always in vain.
In the course of their wandering they came
upon some trees bearing fruit about which
they had no doubt.
? Bananas I ? cried Tommy, with excite-
ment. ? How jolly ! and look at the clusters
on the ground. We?ve only to pick them
55
up.
Several clusters had fallen from the trees,
and lay ripening where they fell. The girls
ate some of the fruit, taking note of the
position of the trees, so that they might come
to them again.
Then they strolled on, keeping close to the
shore, and stopping every few minutes to
gaze yearningly over the sea for the raft they
longed to behold. Turning their backs on
this disappointing horizon, they let their
eyes range over the island, their minds
confused between admiration and wondering
awe. The ground rose in a succession of
irregular terraces, covered with vegetation


in every imaginable shade of green. In
the distance the prospect terminated in a
ridge, above which hovered a light mass
of opalescent cloud. What forms of life
were stirring amid that dark woodland ?
What lay beyond that curtain of rose pink
and pearl ? The girls w r ere by the
mystery of things, as if subject to an enchan-
ter?s spell.
? W hat?s the time ? ? asked Tommy, pres-
ently, bringing them back to the common-
place. Both Mary and Elizabeth had
watches pinned upon their dresses, but on
looking at them they found that each told
a different hour, and both had stopped.
? I forgot to wind mine up,? said Eliza-
beth.
? So did I,? said Mary.
? It; must be getting late,? said Tommy.
? Look at the sun.?
It was clear from its position that night was
at hand. And then Tommy asked a question
that brought back all their uneasiness.
? Where are we to sleep ? ?
? I have thought of that all day,? said
Elizabeth.
? Then it?s clear you are the statesman of
the family, said Tommy. ? I couldn?t have
thought about it all day without telling you,
and you haven?t said a word. It didn?t
occur to me until a moment ago.?
? There are no wild beasts in the South


Sea Islands?at least, I?ve never heard of
any,? said Mary. u ,
? That?s one comfort,? said Tommy, and
we?ve seen no savages or anything else to
alarm us. Now if we were boys?scouts or
something, used to campaigning m the open
?we shouldn?t care a pin, but I feel dread-
fully shaky. What are we to do ? ?
? We must face it,? said Elizabeth quietly.
? I think myself we had better stay in the
? How awful! think of last night, said
Tommy dolefully.
? Perhaps there would be a storm and we
should be upset, or blown out to sea, said
Oh, I didn?t mean to launch the boat,?
said Elizabeth. ? That would be too risky.
We?ll leave it on the beach.?
? it?s only a bit better than being in the
open,? said Mary. ? I know, why not make
afire to scare off intruders ? I?ve read about
that being done.? ~ _
?That?s quite brilliant,? said Tommy.
? And it will be a beacon too; perhaps Uncle
wall see it. Let?s go back at once and get
ready for supper and bed.?
Elizabeth was glad of any activity that
would keep them from thinking of their
troubles. They returned to the beach. First
they collected a number of stones, which they
piled up to make a rough fire-place, then


they gathered a large quantity of twigs and
dry grass from the edge of the forest, and
finding several small trees which had been
uprooted by storms, they lugged these down
to their fire-place. Then the self-lighter
which Tommy had received from her uncle
came in handy, and by the time it was dark
they had a bright pleasant fire that was very
cheering.
They ate more of their biscuit and bacon,
with plum cake for sweets and bananas as
dessert; then, having heaped some fuel on
the fire, they crept into the boat and arranged
themselves as comfortably as possible.
Tommy was soon asleep, but the elder
girls lay awake for a long time, clasping each
other, and talking in murmurs so as not to
disturb their sister.
? Mary dear,? said Elizabeth, ? we must
look at the worst side and face it for Tommy?s
sake, you know.?
? Yes, I know. She?s not really very
strong, is she ? Though she has such
spirit.?
? No, she?ll be all right so long as she
doesn?t get wretched, so we won?t say a
word to depress her. We ought to be thank-
ful that we are safe so far. I?m afraid to
think of what has happened to Uncle ; but
supposing?supposing he is?lost, we shall
have to do as well as we can until we are seen
from a passing ship.?


? Suppose we never are 1 ?
?We won?t suppose that. Think of the
many castaways who have been picked up
in time. By the look of it we shall find
food here, and I rather fancy the island must
be uninhabited, or we should have seen some
signs of people.?
? We haven?t been all over it yet.?
? No, of course we can?t be sure. If
we do come across people we must try and
make friends with them. Aren?t there some
islands called the Friendly Islands because
the people were quite decent ? ?
? Yes. Some of the islanders in these parts
are gentle and peaceable. But I?m dread-
fully afraid of savages.?
? So am I, but we won?t think of them.
What a lovely night it is I So still and
peaceful I and we?re just three insignificant
dots in all this great beautiful universe.?
They mused in silence, and by and by fell
asleep. Dawn found them very cramped
and stiff. The fire was out, and as they
shivered in the cool morning air they felt
something of the previous day?s despondency.
But Elizabeth, with determined cheerfulness,
called to her sisters that it was breakfast-time.
They made themselves some coffee, using the
extract sparingly to eke it out as long as
possible, and after bathing their faces in the
water at the brook, ate their simple break-
fast and then made their way to the top of


the cliff to search the ocean once more for a
sign of help.
The sea was even calmer than it had been
yesterday, and as the mist rolled off its
surface they were able to scan countless miles
of space.
There were the same dark distant shapes,
purple in the early sunlight, and they felt a
wondering curiosity about them; but there
was no sail or funnel that betokened a ship.
First one and then another discovered a
speck on the skyline, and they debated
whether it was or was not a boat; but after
gazing until their eyes were tired they came
to the conclusion that there was no immedi-
ate hope of rescue.
? We ought to raise a flag of distress,?
said Mary, ? which might be seen if a ship
comes near ; but we haven?t anything big
enough.?
? Oh, yes, we have I ? said Tommy. ?If
we tie our silk scarves together they will
make a fine flag.?
? But we haven?t a flagstaff,? said
Elizabeth.
? There?s a lovely one,? said Mary, point-
ing to a tall slender tree that stood a little
apart from the nearest clump of woodland,
like a sentinel thrown out seaward. ? Can
you climb that, Tommv ? ?
ll . i . _
? Rather I Father didn?t like my climbing,
but if I hadn?t where should we be now ? ?


Elizabeth knotted the three scarves to-
gether. Then Tommy ran to the tree and
climbed nimbly almost to the top, the others
watching her breathlessly. Soon the flag
of red and white was fluttering in the light
morning breeze.
? It?ll be torn to shreds by the first storm,?
said Tommy when she descended. ? Let?s
hope it will be seen before a storm comes.?
They spent the day much as they had spent
the first one on the island ; sitting on the
beach, now and again visiting the cliff to
take another look across the sea, gathering
bananas from the little plantation and
wandering for a short distance along the
shore.
? What shall we do when all the bananas
are gone ? ? asked Tommy, as they ate
their dinner. ? The food we have in the
boat won?t last a week.?
?We shall have to go exploring,? said
Mary. ? I can?t believe that these bananas
are the only eatable fruits, and no doubt
there are more bananas somewhere.?
They looked up once more at the distant
mysterious ridge.
? I don?t know how you feel,? said Tommy,
? but I?m rather scared of going far from
the beach. Who knows what we should
find among those trees ? ?
?We might go a little farther than we
did yesterday,? suggested Elizabeth.


? Come along, then,? said Tommy. ? Oh,
gracious ! What?s that ? ?
She pointed towards the ridge. The other
girls looked, but saw nothing.
? What is it ? ? asked Mary.
? I saw a large beast cross over that bare
spot,? replied Tommy.
? I think you must have fancied it,? said
Mary.
? Rubbish I I tell you I saw it.?
? But there aren?t any large beasts in
these islands,? said Mary,
?How do you know? You think you
know everything,? said Tommy sharply,
? just because you?ve read a few books.
I tell you I did see it.?
? It couldn?t have been a large animal,
all the same,? persisted Mary.
? You?re an idiot,? cried Tommy.
Elizabeth saw it was time to intervene.
The girls? nerves were a little on edge.
? I dare say you are both right,? she said
tranquilly. ?Tommy evidently saw some-
thing, and though there are no large native
animals, Mary, perhaps it?s an imported
one. We can?t tell but that there are people
over there, and they might have anything,
you know.?
?Of course they might,? said Tommy
triumphantly. ?It might be an elephant
or anything.?
And so the little storm blew over, but it


made Elizabeth very thoughtful. As she
lay awake that night, she resolved that
something must be done to occupy their
thoughts. ?It will never do to idle away
our time, as we?ve been doing,? she said to
herself, ? or there?ll be constant bickerings,
and we shall all get slack and mopish. Oh,
dear ! ?
And she did not sleep before she had made
a plan.


CHAPTER VII
A LOCAL HABITATION
? Now, my dears,? said Elizabeth as they
sat at breakfast next morning, ? I?ve got
an idea.?
? Hurray I ? cried Tommy. ? What is it,
Bess ? ?
? It?s just this. We must act as if we
were going to stay on this island for ever.?
Tommy gasped, and a look of dismay
came into her eyes.
? Don?t you think we?ll be rescued, then ? ?
she asked.
? Oh, I don?t give up hope. We may be
seen from a ship any day, or Uncle may come
for us ; but we can?t depend on it. Plenty
of men and boys have been shipwrecked like
us on a lonely island, and have managed to
shift for themselves. Why shouldn?t we ?
We?re used to outdoor work : at least, I am,
and it would be an odd thing if we couldn?t
manage to make ourselves comfortable on
an island like this, with half our work already
done for us.?
44 What do you mean ? ? asked Mary.


? Why, if you?re right about there being
plenty of fruit ?and I don?t see why you
shouldn?t be ?we shan?t have to grow our
food, and that?s the chief thing. So we shall
have more time for other things. The first
thing is to see just what we?ve got. Here?s
mine.?
She turned out her pocket, and displayed
two handkerchiefs, a thimble, a small
whistle and her jack-knife.
? That?s not a great deal,? she said,
smiling. ? Now, Mary.?
? There?s my knife, and a hanky, and my
little pen-knife, and hurray I my housewife.?
And as she suddenly remembered that on
the night before the storm she had been
mending her uncle?s clothes, the recollection
almost moved her to tears.
? I?ve got the most,? said Tommy, with a
laugh. ? Look here?scissors, hanky, some
bits of string, my match-box, jack-knife,
picture postcard of an aeroplane?wish we
had an aeroplane ! ?and ?
She had unfolded a much-worn scrap of
paper; now she folded it again and replaced
it in her pocket.
? What is it ? ? asked Elizabeth.
? It?s only that stupid old receipt for
butterscotch : no good to us here.?
They all smiled.
? Well, we can?t boast of much in the way
of personal possessions,? said Elizabeth ;


? but we have the boat, two oars, a boat-
hook, the painter, a few cups and things,
my string bag, that?s a lucky find?and our
macintoshes. More than Crusoe had.?
? Not so much, Bess,? said Mary. ? You
don?t remember. I always think Crusoe
was jolly lucky.?
? I dare say you are right. Well, we?ve
taken stock. That?s one good thing done.
Now what do you say to building a hut ? ?
? What 1 With scissors and knives ? ?
asked Mary.
? You?ll see. We ought to try, I think.
The weather is lovely now, but I shouldn?t
care about sleeping in the boat in a rain-
storm, even under a macintosh. And you
know how it rains in these tropical parts.?
? It?ll be great fun,? said Tommy, ? but
I don?t see how it?s to be done.?
? We?ll have to cut down some saplings
with our jack-knives. I don?t quite see
myself what we shall do next, but that will
be a start, anyway, and I dare say ideas
will come as we go along.?
? That doesn?t sound much like an archi-
tect,? said Tommy, ? but let?s try. It will
give us something to do and keep us from
getting catty.?
Elizabeth smiled as she saw her intentions
thus realized.
?We must choose our site,? she said.
Surveying, don?t they call it ? ?


? All settlements are made near running
water,? said Mary, ? so it ought to be near
the stream.?
They followed with their eyes the course
of the bright little stream as it flowed out of
the woodland down to the shore. There was
no suitable spot for the hut near at hand,
and to find one involved going farther than
they had yet ventured to go. But having
now a definite object in view they found
themselves a little more courageous, and
springing up they set off along the bank
of the stream towards the higher ground.
They walked cautiously and in silence,
looking about them with wide-open eyes,
ready to flee at the slightest alarming sight
or sound. Suddenly Tommy said in a
whisper ?
? Here 1 this is the very place.?
She indicated a grassy knoll some ten or
twelve feet above the bed of the stream.
The girls stopped at its edge and looked at
it. On the inland side it was fringed with a
row of small trees ; seaward the view was
uninterrupted.
?It looks nice,? said Mary. ? Let?s
measure it.?
Elizabeth, being the tallest, stepped the
grassy plot from end to end and from side
to side.
? I make it about twenty feet by sixteen,?
she said, ? just about the size of our dining-


room at home. I think it will do splendidly.
There?s water close at hand; there are plenty
of saplings in the woods beyond ; and the
hillside will protect us from storms, unless
they come from the sea.?
? And what a lovely outlook it has I ?
said Mary, turning towards the sea. ?We
couldn?t have a nicer place.?
? Then we will fix on it,? said Elizabeth.
? Now who?s to be architect ? ?
? Oh, you, Bess I ? said Tommy; ? we?re
no good at that.?
? I?m afraid I?m not either,? said Elizabeth,
laughing. ? But I suppose we ought to put
up some posts for the walls, and weave
rushes and things between them. Anyway,
the first thing is to cut down some stout
saplings that will be strong enough.?
? Well, there are plenty in the woods ;
quite close too,? said Tommy.
? But how can we cut them down ? ?
asked Mary; ?we haven?t axes or saws.?
? We have our knives, though,? said
Tommy. ? Come on, let?s begin.?
They went into the wood, where the trees
at the edge were not at all dense, and
selected several saplings of about the same
height and thickness. Then each dropped
on her knees before one of the saplings,
scratched a circular line on the bark and
began to hack away at this with the knife,
lor some time nothing was heard but the


slight sounds made by the knives; each girl
worked hard as though engaged in a compe-
tition. But presently Tommy straightened
her back, and uttered a sort of sighing
grunt.
? How are you getting on ? ? asked Eliza-
beth, without desisting from her task.
? All right,? cried Tommy, stooping and
setting to work furiously. ? They shan?t
beat me,? she said to herself.
But in a few minutes Mary gave a plaintive
little exclamation, dropped her knife, and
rubbed her right hand with her left.
? You?re soon tired,? said Tommy, work-
ing harder than ever.
? I think my tree must be a specially
tough one,? said Mary. ? I don?t seem to
make much impression, and my wHst does
ache so.?
? Take a rest, dear,? said Elizabeth.
? Shouldn?t we get on better if two worked
at the same tree while the other rested ?
We could take it in turns. When we have
cut down the first, we shall have something
to show for our work.?
? A good idea I ? said Tommy, springing
up and running to Elizabeth?s tree. ? You
take first spell off, Mary.?
The two girls worked at the trunk from
opposite sides. The air was growing hotter
and hotter, the insects became very trouble-
some, and as time went on and the incisions


they had made in the sappy wood were
still very shallow, both felt very much
discouraged.
? We shall never get through the wretched
thing,? said Tommy in disgust. ? Can?t we
snap it off, Bess ? ?
? I?m afraid that would only splinter it,?
said Elizabeth. ?It is a bother. What
troubles me most is that our knives will be
hopelessly blunted if it takes so long to cut
one tree. Still, we must peg away. You
rest now, Tommy, and let Mary try again.?
Tommy got up with relief, and strolled a
few yards away while her sisters continued
the work. In a few minutes she came run-
ning back.
? What idiots we are I ? she cried. ? Stop
work, you two. W T e needn?t break our backs
or our wrists at all. Come and look.?
She led them to the edge of the grassy
knoll, and pointed to three small trees
standing within a few feet of each other
about the same distance apart, and forming
the corners of a sort of triangle.
? There 1 ? she said. ? Don?t you see ?
There?s half our work done for us. Those
three trees can be the corner posts of our
hut, and we can use the branches to make a
roof.?
Quite excited at her discovery, she pointed
out that two of the trees had each thrown out
a branch about seven feet from the ground,


and the third had a branch a little higher.
These overhanging branches protected one
side of the triangle, and Tommy suggested
that they could be employed as a framework
upon which they might spread mats woven
from the grasses on the bank of the stream.
? It would take a terrible time to weave
the mats,? said Mary dubiously.
?Not so long as to cut down the trees,?
replied Tommy, ? and not nearly so hard
work. What do you say, Bess ? ?
? It?s a capital idea, but I can?t weave.?
? Oh, we?ll soon teach you that,? said
Tommy. ? You didn?t go to a kindergarten
like Mary and me; but it?s not very different
from the string work you did on board.
Come along ; let?s make a start.?
They went hopefully to the bank of the
stream, but when they tried to cut down the
rushes, they found that their knives were
already blunt. As the day was now very
hot, and they were hungry and tired, they
resolved to have an early dinner, then rest
for a while, and later on sharpen their
knives on stones at the beach and try again.
By the evening they had cut a large
quantity of grasses, which they placed in
a heap to be weaved next day. They de-
cided again to sleep in the boat, and re-
turned to it just before sunset by way of
the clump of banana-trees, carrying their
supper with them.


? We have made a good start,? said Eliza-
beth cheerfully, as they sat munching
bananas in the boat.
? Yes, but I tell you what,? said Tommy,
? I?m getting tired of bananas.?
? Already 1 ? said Mary, smiling. ? Don?t
you remember how you said once at home
you?d love to live in a banana plantation,
where you could pick as many as you liked ? ?
? And you told me the story of a greedy
boy who loved cake, and dreamt that he was
in the middle of a big one, and had to eat
his way out. I was a silly kid then. Any-
way, I?m sick of bananas now, and people
say it?s bad to have no change of diet.?
? But what can we do ? ? said Elizabeth.
? We haven?t seen anything else.?
? Except birds,? said Mary. ? Pigeon-pie
is rather nice.?
?We might snare some,? said Tommy,
?or fish ?what about fish ? They?d be
easiest to catch, I expect. I?ve got some
string, and we can easily find something
that?ll do for a rod.?
? And a bent pin for a hook,? said Mary.
? Now just listen to that ! ? said Tommy.
? Anybody would think we were going fish-
ing for sticklebacks. No fish worth cooking
would ever let himself be hooked by a bent
pin. We?ll find something better than that.?
? We?ll see what we can do to-morrow,?
said Elizabeth. ? We?ve never done any


sea-fishing, and fishing in the river at home
won?t help us much, I fancy. Still, we can
try, and I?d like a little fish for a change.
You both look awfully tired, so let?s go to
sleep now; we shall have plenty to do in the
morning.?
And Elizabeth, as she laid herself down
that night, felt happy in the success of her
plan. ?If we can only keep busy," she said
to herself, ? all will be well. But Ido hope
it won?t be for long.?


CHAPTER VIII
THE FISHERS
Up with the sun next morning, the girls
began the day by bathing in a little secluded
pool, where there was no danger of being
interrupted by a shark. Immediately after
breakfast they set off to the site of their hut,
looked cautiously around to make sure that
no one had been there, and began to weave
the grasses they had prepared the day be-
fore. Elizabeth was at first rather slow,
but the others worked quickly, and by
dinner-time they had each finished a mat
several feet square.
? You two have quite outstripped me,?
said Elizabeth as they returned to the boat.
? I?U go on with my mat after dinner, while
you see what you can do to make some
fishing-tackle.?
? Right 1 ? cried Tommy; ? you shall have
fish for supper, if you?re good.?
They dined on bananas and coffee, rue-
fully noticing that the tin of condensed milk
was nearly empty. Then Mary and Tommy
went up the stream to a place where they
G 37


had seen a clump of canes, which would
furnish any number of fishing-rods. They
selected one about six feet long, and after
a good deal of trouble, the wood being tough,
cut it down. Tommy brought out of her
pocket two or three pieces of string of un-
equal length and thickness, and knotted
them together.
? There?s our fine,? she said, ? and it?s
lucky there?s no one here to laugh at it.?
? How can we fasten it on to the rod ? ?
asked Mary.
? Tie it, of course.?
Tommy proceeded to tie the string to the
thinner end of the rod.
? Oh, bother ! ? she said, ? the cane?s so
smooth the string slips down every time.
This won?t do.?
? Let?s make a hole in the rod, and put
the string through it,? suggested Mary.
? The cane is sure to split if we try to bore
a hole with a knife,? said Tommy. ? I
know I There?s a sort of spike in my knife.
We?ll make it red-hot, and then I dare say
we can bore a clean hole.?
They ran back to their little camp on the
beach, where Elizabeth was still at work on
her mat.
? How are you getting on ? ? asked Mary.
? Faster now,? replied Elizabeth. ? I
shall beat you both soon.?
They told her what they had done, and


Tommy thrust the spike into the fire, which
they never allowed to go out. Meanwhile,
Mary hunted for something that would serve
as a hook. She gave a cry of delight when
she discovered a strong safety-pin; and
Tommy having by this time bored a hole
neatly through the cane, they very soon had
their rough-and-ready fishing-tackle com-
plete. It only remained to bait the hook.
They found plenty of small shellfish cling-
ing fast to the rocks on the shore, and they
prised these up with their knives, and pro-
vided themselves with a number of the little
molluscs. Thus equipped, they went along
the shore in search of a spot that promised
success. They were both excited ?and Eliza-
beth was so much interested in the experi-
ment that she laid down her mat and followed
her sisters. After a little time they came to
an irregular fine of rocks running from the
base of the cliffs towards the reef on which
they had nearly struck on approaching
the island. They had already observed that
some of the rocks always stood above water,
while others were sometimes submerged.
These latter were easily distinguishable by
the seaweed and the limpets with which they
were covered. At the present moment the
tide was going down, and the girls thought
that they would have a good chance of catch-
ing some of the fish that had probably come
up with the tide.


Accordingly, they made their way for
some distance along the rocky barrier. The
sea was pretty calm, owing to the protection
of the reef ; but every now and then there
was a dash of spray over the rocks at the
farthest end. Choosing a rock that was
lashed by broken water on the seaward side,
and had a deep calm pool on the landward
side, they determined to try their luck.
? I can see hundreds of fish darting about,?
said Mary, peering into the pool as Tommy
baited the hook.
? The more the merrier,? said Tommy.
? Look out, Bess, I don?t want to hook you,
dear.?
The other girls gave Tommy a wide berth
as she cast her hook, then came to her
side and waited for the expected catch. She
had not put on a float, declaring that any
fish worth catching would soon make itself
felt. But as she drew the line towards her
she had no sense of weight or resistance; the
hook came up with the bait untouched.
? They don?t fancy it, apparently,? said
Tommy. ? I?ll have another try. Look out I ?
Again she cast the line, and again drew it in.
? I declare, the little wretches are nibbling
the bait off under our very noses,? she cried,
as the hook passed through the clear water
of the pool. ? How disgusting ! ?
? Poor little things ! why shouldn?t they
enjoy themselves ? ? said Mary.


? Oh 1 if you?re going to talk like that, I?ve
done,? said Tommy, flinging down the rod
impatiently.
Elizabeth picked it up.
? Let me try,? she said.
She baited the hook again, but had no
more success than her sister.
44 It is exasperating,? she said. ? I?m
surprised the fish here are so clever.?
? You?d better have tried a bent pin as I
suggested,? said Mary. ? You?d have caught
some of those little chaps swarming there.
The safety-pin is too big for them.?
? Who wants little skinny things ? ? said
Tommy. ? I?d like a haddock or a cod.
Let me try again, Bess.?
Once more the hook was baited and let
down. Again it was surrounded by a swarm
of eager nibblers, and Tommy was on the
point of drawing it back in disgust when
suddenly the crowd of little fish parted and
scattered in all directions, darting off like
streaks of light. The girls held their breath
as they saw a ? whopper,? as Tommy called
it, come slowly towards the bait. It seemed
to smell at it, moving round with flicks of
its tail. Then it opened its mouth ?and
Tommy felt a tug on the line.
? Got him I ? she cried triumphantly. 44 A
monster, too.?
The other girls watched her as she drew
it in. She wasted no time in playing it, but


simply hauled it up towards the rock. Bess
stooped, and while Mary held her to prevent
her from stumbling into the sea, she slipped
her hands underneath the fish and jerked it
out of the water.
? He?s not such a monster after all,? said
Mary. ? How deceptive the water is I ?
The fish, indeed, was no bigger than a
good-sized haddock.
?It is big enough to make us a good
supper,? said Elizabeth, ? and I don?t think
we should try to catch any more now. They
won?t keep in this climate. Tommy can
catch some every day if she likes.?
? All right,? said Tommy. ? But, I say,
I can?t wait till supper-time. The look of
the fish gives me an appetite. I vote we
have it for tea. You?re cook, Bess. I?ll finish
your mat while you?re getting the fish ready.?
This was agreed upon, and they returned
to the camp. The two younger girls resumed
the weaving, while Elizabeth, using a flat
stone as a kitchen table, set about cleaning
the fish in a very housewifely manner.
All at once Mary dropped her hands and
cried ? Oh ! ?
? What?s the matter ? ? asked Tommy.
? Suppose the fish is poisonous 1 Some
are, you know.?
? Goodness, yes ! What can we do ? We
haven?t a taster, like some old kings I?ve
read about.?


? Don?t worry,? said Elizabeth tranquilly.
? We must have a change of food, and there?s
bound to be a little risk in trying new things.
We?ll cook it, and I?ll eat a little. We shall
soon know if there?s any harm in it.?
? Oh, no, Bess,? said Mary. ? Why should
you take the risk ? ?
? Somebody must, and I?m the eldest?
and the toughest, I expect, so that if it does
make me ill I shall get over it sooner than
you.?
?And I did so want a snack I ? sighed
Tommy. ? You won?t eat much, will you,
Bess ? We couldn?t spare you, you know.?
? I?ll be careful,? said Elizabeth, with a
smile. ?It looks very tempting, doesn?t
it??
? Don?t, Bess; you make my mouth
water,? said Tommy. ? How are you going
to fry it ? ?
? I thought of boiling it in the kettle.?
? I wouldn?t do that,? said Mary. ? I
don?t care for fishy tea. It would take ages
to get the taste out of the kettle.?
? But I don?t see how we can fry it without
a frying-pan.?
? Bake it,? said Tommy. ? Let?s make
an oven. I?ll show you.?
She ran to the beach and collected a num-
ber of stones, which she brought back and
arranged in the shape of a small circle. Out-
side this she placed a second circle, and filled


the space between the two with dried grasses,
brushwood and twigs.
? Now, Bess,? she said, ? put a portion
of the fish in the inner circle. Then we?ll
set light to the fuel, and cover it all over
with stones, and the fish will bake in no
time.?
? But it will be smoky,? protested Mary.
? Not if we wrap it in leaves. Let?s try,
at any rate; if it doesn?t succeed we shan?t
have spoiled much.?
The fish was wrapped in leaves as Tommy
suggested, and placed on a stone in the
midst of the small circle. Then, having
pressed the fuel firmly together so that it
should not burn away too quickly, Eliza-
beth kindled it from the fire, and covered
it with stones, leaving a few spaces for the
passage of air. They were so much inter-
ested in their experiment that they sat idly
about the novel oven, waiting until the fish
should be cooked. Every now and again
Tommy would lift off one of the stones to
see how the cooking was proceeding.
? The leaves are turning brown,? she would
say delightedly. ? And what a lovely smell! ?
After about a quarter of an hour they
removed the stones and the wrappings, and
Elizabeth declared the fish was done.
? It doesn?t look so nice as if we?d had
egg and bread-crumbs,? she said, ? but we
must do without those luxuries.?


She tasted a small portion.
? Very nice,? she said, ? in spite of no salt
or pepper.?
? Don?t eat too much,? said Mary anxi-
ously.
? I must give it a fair trial. Make the
tea, Tommy, will you ? A cup of tea will
qualify the poison if there is any.?
? What a nerve you?ve got I ? said Tommy
admiringly.
Soon all were drinking tea, and the younger
girls munched bananas, while Elizabeth ate
a few small pieces of the baked fish. They
watched her with anxiety mingled with envy.
? Really, you mustn?t eat any more,?
said Tommy at last. ? Now rest against
the side of the boat.? She placed a shawl
behind her sister?s head, and covered her
feet with her macintosh.
? Any one would think I was an invalid,?
said Elizabeth, laughing.
? It?s nothing to laugh at,? said Mary
severely. ?You may be very ill by and
by.?
? Meanwhile put the rest of the fish where
the flies and insects can?t get at it,? said
Elizabeth. ? There?s a nice little hollow in
that rock over there. Cover it with leaves.?
This done, they sat one on each side of
Elizabeth, propping their chins on their
hands, and gazing at her with mournful
interest.


? This is too absurd,? said Elizabeth, after
a few minutes. ? Let us get on with op
hut. I can?t stand being stared at like this.
Come along, girls. We must cut down some
more canes to make walls; I?ll show you what
I mean.?
They went up-stream to the clump of
canes, and, selecting some of the longest, pro-
ceeded to hack them down with their knives
?no easy task, for the longest canes were
also the thickest. But after a little trouble
they got three or four that Elizabeth thought
would answer her purpose, and took them
to the site chosen for the hut. Here they
laid the canes across the projecting branches
of the three trees, binding them firmly in
place with strong tendrils of a creeping plant.
After an hour?s work all the canes were in
position, forming a kind of framework for
the roof.
?Now all we have to do is to cover this
with matting, and our roof is finished,? said
Elizabeth. ?We shall have to get some
more canes to stretch matting on for the
walls, and as we have used up nearly all the
grasses we collected, we had better go at
once to get some more ready for to-morrow.?
? To-morrow ! ? cried Mary. ? I?d for-
gotten I Do you feel quite well, Bess ? ?
? As well as possible.?
? How long is it since you ate the fish ? ?
asked Tommy.


? More than two hours?long enough for
the poison to act, I?m sure. So we may
make up our minds that the fish is perfectly
wholesome, and there?s baked fish for supper
for all of us to-night.?
? Hurray I ? said Tommy, beginning to
dance. ? Let?s go and get the grasses; by
the time we have got enough to make our
mats it will be supper-time. Oh I lam so
glad you are not ill, Bess.?
They spent an hour or two in gathering
grasses, and returned to their little camp
shortly before sunset, in order to cook their
supper before dark. Tommy ran to the
hole in the rock where the fish had been left.
A cry of dismay startled her sisters.
? What is it ? ? they cried, turning towards
her.
? It?s gone, every bit of it; oh, who has
stolen it ? ?
She looked round with alarm in her eyes,
and the other girls also glanced about them
with consternation and anxiety. Was it pos-
sible that some one had been spying on them?
? I did see somebody that day,? said
Tommy in a whisper.
? But who would want to steal a bit of
fish ? ? said Elizabeth, with practical com-
mon-sense. ?If there are natives here, they
could fish for themselves, I?m sure.?
? There aren?t any cats in these parts, are
there, Mary ? ? asked Tommy.


? I never read of them. But good
gracious I ? she cried suddenly, ? there are
the bones 1 ? .
She had looked a little farther into the
hole than Tommy had done, and there lay
the skeleton of the fish picked clean of every
bit of flesh. , ## _ .
? I know what it is,? she said. ? It?s a
land-crab?s hole, and the wretch smelt the
fish, I suppose, and came out for a feast while
we were busy.?
? The mean thing 1 ? cried Tommy. And
we shan?t have any fish for supper after all.
I?ll serve him out.?
She ran to the boat and brought back the
boat-hook, with which she poked vigorously
in the hole. In a few minutes a large crab
came scuttling out, at the sight of which she
picked up her skirt and ran away, not liking
the look of his formidable nippers.
They supped as usual on bananas and tea,
resolving to choose a safer larder when next
they kept fish for a future meal.


CHAPTER IX
THE LITTLE BROWN FACE
? I say, my hair is in a terrible tangle,?
said Mary next morning, after they had
bathed. ? I wish we had a comb.?
In the haste of their dressing, the last
night on the Elizabeth , they had done up
their hair anyhow, forgetting all about their
combs.
? What do the South Sea natives do,
Mary ? ? asked Elizabeth.
? I fancy I?ve read that they build up
their hair into a sort of huge turban, with
grease and things.?
? Horrid I ? said Tommy. ? I vote we
cut our hair short like a boy?s; you?ve got
a pair of scissors in your housewife, Mary.
Then it won?t bother any of us.?
? I don?t think that would be wise,? said
Elizabeth ; ? w r e might get sunstroke. As
it is we are protected a little. I?m going to
let my hair down. Perhaps we might make
a comb out of a bit of wood.?
? A lon g fiddling job that will be,? said
Tommy. ? I?m going to catch a fish for


breakfast, and if it?s like the one I caught
yesterday, take out the backbone and use
that for a comb.?
? That?s rather an original idea,? said
Elizabeth. ? Won?t our hair smell fishy,
though ? ?
? Not if we wash the bone and then dry
it in the sun, I should think. Anyway, we
can try.?
The girls went off together to the rocks
from which they had fished on the previous
day. The first fish they hooked was of a
different kind from the one whose whole-
someness they had proved, and Tommy
threw it back into the sea, saying that she
could not wait while another experiment
was being tried. After a time she landed
one of the right sort, and this, when baked,
made a capital breakfast for them all. No
biscuit remained, and Tommy sighed for
bread and butter ; but they enjoyed the
change of fare. They washed the skeleton
as Tommy had suggested, and set it to dry
in the sun. Then they resumed their weav-
ing. Elizabeth made some rough measure-
ments, and found that a great deal more
matting was required than they anticipated,
so that several days must pass before they
could begin the actual building of the hut.
Mary and Elizabeth had both set their
watches by the sun, and so were able to tell
with reasonable accuracy the time of day.


But they had not kept count of the days as
they passed, and now Elizabeth suggested
that they should each morning cut a notch
in one of the trees to serve as a calendar.
That night they tested the comb of fish-
bone. Mary?s hair was the finest, and she
managed to comb out its tangles fairly well;
but when Elizabeth tried to do the same
with her thicker and stronger locks, several
of the bones snapped off, and it was clear
that a new comb of this sort would be needed
every day. She reverted, therefore, to her
idea of trying to make a wooden comb ; and
during the next few days, Mary, who had
had some practice in fretwork at home,
worked with her knife at a thin fragment of
wood.
It was a difficult task. She found herself
quite unable to make the teeth equal in size,
or equal in distance from each other. But
she persevered, and on the third evening
after starting the work she showed the comb
to her sisters.
? Well, it?s half-way between a curry-
comb and a garden rake,? said Tommy, with
a laugh. ? But I dare say it?s better than
fish-bones. Let me have first so on mv
thatch.?
She began to operate upon her hair, a
little yell every now and then proclaiming
that the teeth had ? caught.? But all the
girls voted that it was better than nothing,


and they used it in turn every morning and
night.
When there were six notches on the tree,
Elizabeth said that she thought there was
enough matting to complete the w'alls of
the hut, so they carried their handiwork up
to the knoll. Tommy climbed into the
trees, and fastened the upper edges of
several mats to the overhanging boughs,
while the other girls stuck a double row of
canes into the ground, one inside and the
other outside the matting, to keep it steady.
The various strips of matting had to be sewn
together, and at these places an extra long
cane was introduced, to which the mats were
fastened by means of thin flexible tendrils.
A day?s work sufficed to complete three
walls; the fourth side, facing the sea, was
left open.
It now only remained to complete the
roof. Next day the girls added other canes
to those which they had already laid across
the branches, until they formed a close
lattice-work. This they covered with mat-
ting, and then deliberated whether to finish
it off with thatch. As children they had
often helped the thatchers at the farm, so
that they w r ould not find any difficulty in
the work; but they guessed that in so warm
a climate thatch would harbour insect pests
of all kinds, and they did not feel comfortable
at the thought of having such house-mates.


? Still, I think we must chance it,? said
Mary. ? There?s one thing to be said, and
that is, that the whole contrivance is so
slight and simple that we can make it all
over again if necessary.?
? That?s all very well,? said Tommy, ? but
we aren?t spiders, and I shall be pretty mad
if there?s all this work to do again. I?d
rather do something fresh,?
? We haven?t found much else to occupy
us so far,? said Elizabeth. ?Anyway, we
won t ask you to do the repairs, Tommy, if
you don?t like it.?
? Oh, I didn?t mean that,? said Tommy
at once; ? I?ll do my fair share, but I know
I shall get a bit ratty if a silly old storm
knocks our nice hut to pieces.?*
The thatching occupied two more days,
and then the girls looked with a great deal
of pleasure on their neat little hut.
? But we haven?t done yet,? said Eliza-
beth. The thatch will protect us from
any ordinary rain, but we?re still liable to
be swamped by water running down the hill
behind. We had better scrape out a trench
all round, to carry the water down to the
shore.?
This proved the hardest part of the work.
1 hey had no tools except their knives and
the boat-hook, and with these to cut a
trench deep enough to be effective was verv
trying to their patience. Such continuous
H


plodding work did not suit Tommy?s rest-
less, active temperament at all, and she
would constantly jump up and run off to
the beach, or to the edge of the wood. At
such times Mary was inclined to be im-
patient and reproachful, but Elizabeth said
that they mustn?t expect too much from
T� mm y. . ,
? She?s very young, you know, and it s
really wonderful how her spirits have kept
up so well. She?s more nervy than we are,
Mary, and I am always afraid she will break
down.?
So neither she nor Mary said anything
to Tommy about her fitfulness, and Tommy
herself always came back repentant after
these little absences, and worked away hard
until the next fit of restlessness overtook
her.
To give her a change from scraping away
at the trench, Elizabeth suggested that she
should make a mat curtain for the open side
of the hut.
? We don?t want a door,? she said, ? but
a curtain will be useful at night. Leave
a little space between it and the roof for
ventilation. We can fasten the two lower
comers to the canes.?
Tommy set about this task willingly, and
had the curtain fixed by the time the trench
was finished. The hut was now complete
so far as its exterior was concerned; it had


taken more than a fortnight altogether.
What they had now to consider was the
internal fittings. Tommy laughed when
this was mentioned.
I\e can?t get a bedroom suite, even on
the hire system,? she said. ?I suppose
you?d call it a bed-sitting-room, wouldn?t
you ? ?
Let s call it 4 Our Flat,? ? suggested
Mary.
The best flat that ever was,? said
Tommy. ?No botherations from un-
pleasant neighbours? at least, I hope not.?
\\ e certainly shan?t have a tiresome
piano going next door,? said Elizabeth. 44 1
tlunk 4 Our Flat ? is a very good name.
VV hat a pity we haven?t a table and pen, ink
and paper!?then Mary could write a diary
of our doings.? J
:? W ' th moral reflections,? added Tommy.
io-day our youngest sister refused to
wash up; how sad to see such a selfish spirit
in one so young I ? That?s the sort of thing,
isn?t it, Mary ? ?
I shouldn?t write anything of the sort,?
said Mary indignantly. ? You haven?t re-
fused to wash up, and if you did, do you
think I should tell it ? ? 3
T ? M >' deff. you are perfectly killing,? said
y? think you?d get vour
old drary published ? No one would ?read
it if you did.?


? We?re talking nonsense, aren?t we ? ?
said Elizabeth. ? There?s no chance of any
of us writing a diary. Let?s be practical.
The only furniture we can supply ourselves
with is?beds.? _
44 More weaving ? ? cried Tommy. Oh,
lam so sick of it, Bess. Can?t we sleep on the
ground ? ?
? I don?t think we?d better; we might get
rheumatism, though to be sure the ground
seems dry enough at present. But I own
that weaving mats day after day is rather
tiring, so shall we leave it for the present,
and still sleep in the boat ? What do you
say to doing a little more exploration ? ?
? Yes, why not ? ? said Tommy eagerly.
?We haven?t seen a soul ?since I saw
that figure move along the top of the ridge,
at any rate; and I dare say that was an
animal of some kind. I don t think there
are any people here at all.?
? There may be some on the other side of
the ridge,? said Mary.
? Well, if there are, they must be a very
unenterprising lot,? said Tommy. ?Lets
follow up the stream to its source. Iye
never seen the source of a river, a.nd that 11
be geography, won?t it ? Besides, our
bananas wall soon be all gone, and wx ought
to look for some more; we can?t live on
nothing but fish.?
44 Very well; w r e will do as you say, said


Elizabeth. ? It?s very hot to-day, so we?ll
cover our heads with leaves; it?s just as well
to take precautions.?
Shortly afterwards they set out, carrying
the oars and the boat-hook as weapons of
defence. Although they had gained con-
fidence from never having seen any human
being, as soon as they had walked beyond
the Unfit of their previous excursions they
felt something of the old timidity, and spoke
only in whispers.
? Our flag is still flying,? said Tommy, as
they came to a spot whence they could see
the tree she had chmbed on their first day
on the island. ? Evidently no one has seen
it or thought it worth noticing.?
? That?s a consolation in one way,? said
EUzabeth. ? These South Sea Islanders
have canoes, haven?t they, Mary ? We
haven?t seen any, which is a negative proof
that our island isn?t inhabited; but if any
people from another island happened to
have come this way, they would almost
certainly have noticed our flag, and perhaps
come to see what it meant.?
They were following the course of the
stream. It zigzagged about a good deal, at
first through a fairly thick belt of woodland,
then through a comparatively clear space
of a few hundred yards, then into wood-
land again, always narrowing. They were
still some distance below the crest of the


ridge when they came to a small swamp,
beyond which there was no stream.
? This must be the source,?? said Mary.
? How disappointing ! ? said Tommy. ? I
wanted to see a nice little spring, with beau-
tiful clear water bubbling up. This swamp
is simply horrid.?
? There must be a spring somewhere m
the swamp,? said Elizabeth, smiling. But
it isn?t worth while to hunt for it, even if
we could find it. The stream is certainly
prettier lower down. Let?s go on; we are not
very far from the top, and we might be
able to get a good view from there ?see the
whole of the island and the sea beyond.?
? I feel quite like a discoverer,? said Mary.
? Can?t you imagine how Drake must have
felt when he first caught sight of the Pacific ? ?
? You romantic old dear I ? cried Tommy.
� I don?t care a bit what Drake felt; all I
hope is we shan?t wish we hadn?t come.?
They went on quietly, feeling a little
nervous. The ground here was bare except
for a few shrubs, and they drew their breath
more quickly as they mounted the slope.
At last they reached the top. One and all
gave a sigh of disappointment. Directly
in front of them, to the north, was a second
ridge higher than the one on which they
stood. But on every other side there was
a fine view. To the south the land fell away
rapidly towards the sea, of which they


caught a glimpse over the tree-tops nearly
a mile away. To the west, the direction
from which they had come, the sea was much
farther off. To the east there was a gradual
slope downwards into a country for the most
part densely wooded, but here and there
showing traces of clearings natural or
otherwise. The greatest extent of land
seemed to be to the north-east, where the
sea was much farther remote than it was
on the west. None of the girls had any
experience in judging distances, but they
saw that the island was longer than it was
broad, and that the greatest length was from
north-west to south-east.
? Shall we go to the farther ridge ? ? asked
Elizabeth.
? Yes, let?s,? said Tommy. ? There isn?t
a sign of a living creature; the island is just
ours.?
A thick belt of woodland separated the
two ridges at the point where they stood,
so they moved somewhat to the right to
search for a more open way. All at once
they came to a halt. A little in front of
them was a pole, carrying what appeared
to be the remains of a small flag. About
fifty paces beyond it was another exactly
similar; and then they saw that there were
five or six altogether, extending along the
crest of the ridge, all the same distance
apart.


? I think we had better go back,? said
Mary, looking a trifle scared. ? There are
people after all.?
Her sisters were equally disturbed at the
sight of poles evidently erected by human
agency. There was nobody to be seen, and
from the appearance of the poles they were
not attended to; the flags on them were the
merest rags of coloured cloth. But the
girls were not inclined to face any more
discoveries. The bare possibility that there
were savages on the island made them
shiver. They paused for a few moments at
the spot where they first caught sight of
the poles, and then turned, intending to
make their way in the direction of home.
Just then, however, Tommy caught sight
of some bananas clustering thick a little way
down the slope on the eastern side.
? I?m hungry,? she said. ? Those look
bigger than what we have had. Couldn?t
we go and fetch a few ? ?
The clump of trees lay on the slope below
the line of poles, a good distance away from
them.
? It?s rather silly to be scared so easily,?
said Elizabeth. ? There isn?t a sign of any-
body; I think we might venture. We must
find a new supply.?
They moved quickly down towards the
trees, listening, peering about them, ready
to fly at the least alarm. But when they


came to the trees they felt that they had
the reward of courage, for there, within a
short distance of them, was a sight that
made them gasp with surprise and delight.
Beside the stumpy, long-leaved banana-trees,
there were other trees glittering with green
and yellow fruit and with white blossom.
The laden boughs bent down invitingly, and
beneath them the golden globes of fallen
fruit glowed amid the grass.
? Oranges, I declare 1 ? exclaimed Mary.
? How lovely I ? cried Tommy, forgetting
all her fears, and running forward to pick
an orange from the ground.
Her sisters followed more leisurely, but
before they reached her Tommy suddenly
uttered a cry of terror. The orange she
had taken fell from her hand. The other
girls ran to her side and found her pale with
fright.
? There I ? she said, pointing towards a
clump of hibiscus.
? What is it, dear ? ? asked Elizabeth.
?In the bushes ?a little brown facet?
whispered Tommy, with trembling lips.


CHAPTER X
ANXIOUS DAYS
For a moment, under the shock of the
startling piece of news, Elizabeth was
tempted to seize her sisters by the hand and
run. Tommy was so practical and unimagin-
ative a young person that she could hardly
have been altogether mistaken, and a ? little
brown face,? if face it was, must belong to
a native. But Elizabeth thought quickly,
and even while her heart was galloping with
nervous excitement, she made up her mind
that to run away now was not the right
course. A show of bravery was much more
likely to serve them. If there really was a
native in hiding, he would certainly have
seen them, and to run or slink away now
would merely provoke pursuit, in which the
fugitives would be at a great disadvantage.
Summoning all her courage, therefore, Eliza-
beth advanced towards the bush to which
Tommy had pointed.
? Don?t go, Bess,? implored Tommy in
an agitated whisper, and Mary, as pale as a
sheet, put an arm about the younger girl.


Elizabeth went straight on, looking care-
fully around.
? Is this it ? ? she asked quietly, turning
towards her sisters, now several yards dis-
tant.
Tommy merely nodded; Mary murmured,
? How could she do it ? ?
Elizabeth peered into the bush. There
was no little brown face now, nor, though
she went to and fro amongst the trees beyond,
could she see any one, brown or white,
lurking. She listened as the thought struck
her that it might have been a monkey, and
she had heard monkeys screaming and
chattering in the Zoological Gardens in Lon-
don; but there was no sound, not even the
twitter or squawk of a bird.
Brave as she was in outward mien, Eliza-
beth, after a few minutes? search, returned
with hasty step to her sisters.
? My silly heart 1 ? she said, with a faint
smile, placing her hand to her side. ? I
couldn?t see anything, Tommy; don?t you
think you may have imagined it ? ?
? Just as you did before,? added Mary.
? I didn?t 1 ? cried Tommy. ? Why won?t
you believe me ? I did see a brown face;
I am sure I did.?
? It is very strange,? said Elizabeth. ? We
were here only a few seconds after you cried
out; there wasn?t much time for any one to
get away.?


?You are both horrible,? said Tommy,
her lips quivering. ? Any one would think
I was a fool. I?ll prove that I was right,
whatever happens.?
With the courage of indignation she pulled
Elizabeth towards the clump of bushes, and
began to examine the soft mossy carpet.
? There I ? she cried triumphantly, yet
fearfully, pointing presently to a mark on
the ground. Elizabeth stooped and made
out two or three faint impressions of a foot
smaller even than Tommy?s. And then
Tommy?s fear returned in full force. With
a little cry she dragged Elizabeth from the
spot, and since nothing is so catching as fear
even Elizabeth?s courage gave way, and soon
all three girls were running as hard as they
could run towards the stream, and did not
halt until they came to the boat.
? Oh, dear, how ashamed I am 1 ? panted
Elizabeth, as they threw themselves down
on the sand to rest.
? You were very brave,? said Mary. ? I
couldn?t have gone into those bushes for
anything.?
? Perhaps they were marks of a monkey?s
feet,? said Elizabeth. ? How silly I was
not to examine them more closely.?
? They weren?t,? said Tommy. ? I saw
them quite plainly. They were feet just like
yours and mine, only tiny, wee things.?
? I wonder if the people here are dwarfs,?


said Mary. ? There must be people. That?s
certain now.?
? If they are dwarfs they must be more
afraid of us than we are of them,? said
Elizabeth.
? Impossible I ? said Tommy. ? I ? was
never in such a fright in my life. Oh 1 ?
? What is it ? ? asked Elizabeth, with an
anxious look around.
? The oranges 1 we haven?t got any, and I
shall be afraid to go there again.?
? That?s a pity,? said Elizabeth; ? they
looked so nice. Perhaps we can find some
in another part of the island.?
? I won?t look for any,? said Tommy. ? I
won?t stir from this place ?at least not
farther than to the bananas, and they?re
nearly all gone. What if the savages come
and attack us ? ?
? Some of them have poisoned arrows,?
said Mary, quaking.
? Really, I think we are crying before we
are hurt,? said Elizabeth. ? We haven?t been
molested so far, and surely that proves that
whatever people there are, they are not very
terrible.?
? I know I shan?t sleep a wink to-night,?
said Tommy.
? Hadn?t w'e better launch the boat and
spend the night on the sea ? ? said Mary.
? They might attack us in the darkness.?
? We?ll drag it down a little nearer the


sea,? replied Elizabeth, ? and we can take
turns to keep watch, if you like; but I?m
sure we oughtn?t to show the white feather.
The best thing we can do is to forget all
about it.?
? It?s easy to say, but I know I shan?t
forget it as long as I live,? cried Tommy.
?And we were so jolly; it?s all spoilt.?
? Well, we must eat,? said Elizabeth,
afraid of a breakdown. ? Let us cook some
fish, and be as comfortable as we can.?
They spent the rest of that day in a state
of nervousness, and although Elizabeth
tried to get the others to begin weaving
their mat beds for the hut, they had no
heart for the work. When darkness fell,
they drew the boat down to the very verge
of high water, and lay in it, but not to sleep.
They had arranged that each should take a
turn at keeping watch, but the result was
that all were wakeful, and except for a few
minutes? uneasy dozing, none of them had
any rest.
? This will never do,? thought Elizabeth
as it drew towards morning. ?We shall all
be worn out if we don?t get our proper sleep.
I do hope the natives will come to us to-
morrow so that we can make friends with
them.?
They all looked very weary and washed-
out when daylight came. There was no fish
left, and Tommy seemed disinclined to try


to catch any, or to go to the banana-trees for
food.
? Come, girls, this really won?t do,? said
Elizabeth briskly. ? Make some tea,
Tommy, while Mary and I go and get a fish.?
? There?s only enough for about a cup
each,? said Tommy, looking dolefully into
the caddy.
? We shan?t get any more by wishing for
it,? said Elizabeth, ? so we?ll use it all up
and then try to make a sort of cider out
of bananas. It will be a change.?
? There are hardly any bananas left,
either,? said Tommy.
? Then we?ll go prowling in search of more
as soon as we really come to the last of them.
Come along, Mary.?
? Don?t go out of sight, will you ? ? said
Tommy, as they moved away.
? Of course not, we shan?t be long.?
? I wish we had a change of things, Bess,?
said Mary, as they hastened towards their
fishing rock. ? Never in my life have I worn
my underwear so long; it?s horrid.?
?Why shouldn?t we have a washing-day ? ?
said Elizabeth. ?It will be a novelty, and
give us something to do and think about.
Rather fun too, with no soap. How can we
manage ? ?
? I?ve read somewhere that the women in
the East wash their clothes by beating them
in a running stream with stones,? said Mary.


? The stream and the stones are handy; we
might try that plan.?
? Don?t the stones knock holes in them ? ?
? They use flat, round stones, without
sharp edges, I think. It will be rather fun
to try, anyway. I hope the savages won?t
come, Bess.?
? Do you know, I?m not at all sure that it
wasn?t the footprint of a monkey or some
other animal. It was so very small. I?m
not going to think about it. We?d better go
on in our ordinary way without troubling;
only for Tommy?s sake we won?t go far
from home, for some days at any rate.?
They returned with two excellent fish.
Elizabeth at once told Tommy of their idea
of a washing-day, and, as she hoped, the
young girl was so much amused at the
novelty of it, that she forgot her alarms for
a time. After breakfast they took off their
things and donned their dressing-gowns, as
Tommy called their macintoshes; and having
gathered each a smooth, round stone, laid
their linen in the stream at a place where
it ran over level rock, and began merrily to
pound away. When they had given the
clothes a thorough good drubbing, as Tommy
worded it, they laid them on the grass in
the sun, and within an hour they were quite
dry.
? My word ! don?t they look nice ? ? cried
Tommy in delight, ? Old Jane ?poor old


thing?never got them white at home, did
she ? We must have a weekly wash, girls ;
it?s great fun.?
? There?s another thing we might try,?
said Elizabeth. ? I haven?t got used to
eating fish without salt, yet. Couldn?t we
make some by evaporation ? ?
? How would you do that ? ? asked
Tommy.
? Put some sea-water in our cups, and
let it evaporate. It would soon do so in
this heat, and leave the salt at the bottom.?
? H?m I it sounds all right,? said Tommy,
? but I doubt whether we should get enough
salt to put on a bird?s tail. Let?s try.?
They half filled their three cups from the
sea, and put them in the full glare of the
sun. Every now and then Tommy ran to
them to see hew they were getting on, every
time becoming more sceptical of success.
There was still a good deal of water in the
cups at nightfall; but, as Mary said, that
didn?t matter much, as they had used up
all their tea, none of them liking coffee at
night; so they left the cups as they were, to
evaporate the rest of the water next day.
When the cups were at last dry there was
no appreciable sediment, and Tommy with
great scorn pronounced the experiment a
failure.
? The cups don?t hold enough,? said Mary.
? What we want is a large shallow pan, and
i


as we haven?t got one, I?m afraid you?ll have
to go without salt, Bess.?
But a day or two after, Elizabeth dis-
covered a wide shallow depression in a rock
a little distance above high-water mark.
? This will do for a pan,? she said. ? We?ll
fill it with sea-water with our cups, and keep
on filling it up as the water evaporates.
Then we?ll see, my dears.?
They followed this plan for several days,
and at last were able to collect a fair quantity
of salt.
?It isn?t table salt, to be sure,? said
Elizabeth, looking at the dirty-grey powder,
? but it is certainly salt enough for any-
thing, and this quantity will last for a week
at least.?
? We are getting quite clever,? said Mary.
? I dare say we shall be able to make quite a
lot of things by and by.?
During these days they had seen no more
signs of inhabitants, and their nervousness
partially wore off. They were still care-
ful, however, not to stray far beyond the
immediate neighbourhood of their camp,
and slept every night in the boat, which
they left close to the brink of the sea. They
devoted a good deal of time to weaving
grass mats for the floor of their hut, but
had not as yet plucked up courage to spend
a night in it. With the boat as a refuge
they felt a certain sense of security, though


they admitted, when they talked about it,
that it would not really be of any great
service if they were attacked; for they could
only escape by embarking, and then to drift
on the sea out of reach of food was a terrible
fate to look forward to.
One day, when Mary had been out to
gather bananas, she came back with the
news that she had gathered the very last
one, so that they were faced with the im-
mediate necessity of finding another food
supply. . . .
?We must take our courage in both
hands,? said Elizabeth, ? and revisit the
land of plenty beyond the ridge.?
? Don?t let?s go near the orange-trees,?
said Tommy anxiously. ? Couldn?t we try
a little to the left ? There will surely be
some fruit of some sort in other parts.?
? I don?t see why not,? said Mary. ? I
don?t want to go there again, either, in case
you were right.?
? Of course I was right,? declared Tommy.
? You aren?t going to make out again that
I can?t believe my own eyes I ?
? We?ll try another direction,? said Eliza-
beth, anxious to keep the peace. ? Let us
go northward along the shore. We have
never really explored the coast of our island
yet.?
Accordingly, after breakfast, they set out.
There was a long stretch of beach strewn


with boulders which had apparently fallen
from the cliffs. These rose higher as they
proceeded, and jutted out to within twenty or
thirty feet of high-w r ater mark. By and by
they reached a point wffiere the huge rocky
obstacles made further progress impossible.
Retracing their steps, they clambered with
some difficulty up the face of the cliff, and
at last gained the high land above.
All this time they moved very cautiously,
careful to make no more noise than they
could help, and always on the look-out for
danger. But the silence was broken only by
the chatter of birds, the warbling of a black-
bird now and then, and the harsh screaming
of the parrots in the w r oods, that extended
almost to the verge of the cliffs.
? I should like to catch and tame one of
those beauties,? said Tommy. ? Perhaps I
might teach him to talk, and that would be
a change, wouldn?t it ? ?
? I am sorry we bore you,? said Mary.
? Wouldn?t it be better to find your savage
and teach him how to keep up an amiable
conversation ? ?
? Don?t be sarcastic; it doesn?t suit you,?
said Tommy cuttingly, and again Elizabeth
had to intervene.
? We came out to look for food,? she said
smoothly, ? and I think we had better not
think of anything else.?
Mary and Tommy separated, and went


off at a little distance by themselves, look-
ing among the trees and shrubs for fruits or
berries that might seem edible. For a time
none of the girls saw anything that appeared
promising, but presently Mary called out
quite excitedly?
? Here, Bess, I?m sure this is the bread-
fruit tree. Come and look.?
Then, frightened by the sound of her own
voice, she suddenly became aware of her
indiscretion, and ran fleetly to join Elizabeth.
?You idiot 1 ? said Tommy in a fierce
whisper, as she came up with the others.
They stood listening for a while, wonder-
ing whether Mary?s exclamation had attracted
the attention of some inhabitant. But, re-
assured by the absence of any sign of danger,
they hastened to inspect the trees upon
which Mary had lighted. Elizabeth noticed
that Tommy, who would have died rather
than apologize, had slipped her hand into
Mary?s in token of regret for her sharp speech.
They found themselves in the midst of a
little grove of trees, about the size of small
oaks, but with much sparser foliage. Peep-
ing out from among the long, indented leaves
were several large round fruits with a
crinkly rind.
? I know they are breadfruit,? said
Mary gleefully. ? Don?t you remember the
pictures in that book of Captain Cook?s
voyages ? ?


? Let?s peel one and see how it tastes,?
said Tommy.
? You wouldn?t like it better than raw
dough,? said Mary. ?It has to be cooked
first.?
? Bother I You know I don?t like cooked
fruit. It isn?t a fruit at all if you can?t eat
it raw; it?s a vegetable.?
Elizabeth smiled at this ingenuous dis-
tinction.
? Let us take one each and go and try
them,? she suggested. ?If they are really any-
thing like bread we shall enjoy them, I know.?
Laden with the fruits, they returned to
their camp.
? Pity the place is so far from home,?
said Mary. ?We must have come more
than a mile, I should think.?
?If we are satisfied with our bread we
might come again and gather a good load
that will last some time,? said Elizabeth.
When they reached home they lost no
time in stripping off the thin rind of one of
the fruits, and found beneath it a white
doughy substance something like new bread.
Tommy could not forbear tasting it, in spite
of what Mary had said.
? What horrid, nasty stuff I ? she ex-
claimed, making a wry face. ? It?s like?
what is it like ? Taste it, Bess.?
Elizabeth pinched off a very small piece
and ate it.


? It seems to me like sweetened flour with
a smack of artichokes,? she said. ? I hope
it is better cooked; scrape it all out, Mary,
while I get the oven ready.?
When the pulp was scraped out, Mary
kneaded it into a flat cake and cut it into
three equal portions. Elizabeth put them
into the stone oven, and in about twenty
minutes took them out, slightly browned,
and smelling somewhat of new bread. Allow-
ing them to cool, the girls each nibbled a little.
? Not half bad,? said Tommy. ? I sup-
pose we?ll get used to it, and like it better.
I never liked carrots when I was a child,
and Ido now. If we only had some butter 1
Why aren?t there any cocoanuts here, I
wonder ? They have milk, haven?t they ?
If we had some we might make some butter
out of the cream.?
At this the other girls laughed outright.
? I?m afraid we shouldn?t get much cream
out of cocoanuts,? said Elizabeth. 44 The
milk is a sickly kind of juice, isn?t it, Mary ? ?
44 Yes; I had some once, long ago, when
Father took me to the fair at Exeter. He
knocked down the cocoanut at one of the
shies. I didn?t like the milk at all.?
44 We must eat our bread without butter,?
said Elizabeth. 44 1 do hope, though, that we
shall find more bananas, for I?m sure I shall
soon get tired of the breadfruit. We must
try another part of the island another day.?


CHAPTER XI
A TROPICAL STORM
Two or three days passed without inci-
dent. The elder girls in their heart of
hearts were becoming convinced that the
footprints must have been those of an animal;
but Tommy had shown herself so touchy on
that point that they never told her what
they thought. With the return of their
confidence they began to think that they
were punishing themselves by neglecting to
use the hut, and one night they ventured
to sleep in it for the first time, lying on their
grass mats, with pillows of grass and dried
leaves. They found their new quarters so
much more easy and comfortable that they
decided to use the boat no more as a bed-
chamber, and thought they had been silly
in not deserting it before.
The hut was delightfully cool both by
day and night. In the daytime they always
lifted the awning facing the sea; at night
they let it dowm at first, getting ventilation
by the space beneath the roof; but as they
became accustomed to their bedroom they
136


left the opening uncovered at night also.
Before turning in they would sit cross-legged
just within the hut, gazing, most often in
silence, over the wide expanse of sea, watch-
ing the stars as they came into the darken-
ing sky, and thinking of their uncle and the
friends at home. Uncle Ben was scarcely
ever mentioned among them now. They
could not bear to think that the dear old
man was at the bottom of the sea, that
could show such a smooth and smiling
face, and yet behave like a treacherous,
cruel monster. They scarcely ever dared
to think of the future, for though they
seldom missed a visit to the cliffs, from which
they could look far over the sea, and though
their flag was still flying from the tree, they
had almost lost hope of being rescued, and
could only live from day to day, killing
thought by various little activities.
One day, for instance, Elizabeth sug-
gested that as their hut was built and fur-
nished, and they had little to do except fish
and prepare their food, they might make
themselves some new hats. The idea was
eagerly taken up by the others. Each girl
worked in her own way, plaiting lengths of
thin grass, and Mary hit on a brilliant notion
of making brims out of the large leaves from
a kind of dwarf palm that grew plentifully
in the neighbourhood. They fastened these
together, and then to the grass crowns, by
E 2


threading them in and out with the very
fine tendrils of a creeper. When the hats
were finished the girls had what Tommy
called a mutual admiration meeting, and
felt very proud of their Dolly Vardens.
A few days after the discovery of the bread-
fruit, they made a lengthy excursion along
the southern shore. Here the woods were
a good deal denser than in other parts, which
was one reason why they had hesitated to
explore them. But the cliffs were much less
lofty than those on the north, and the girls
easily climbed them, and penetrated for a
short distance into the fringing woods.
They discovered several trees of kinds
they had not seen before. There was one
in particular that interested them by its
fantastic shape; it was so odd-looking that
Tommy dubbed it the clown of the forest;
the real name, of which they were ignorant,
was the pandanus. But the special reward
of this expedition was the discovery of a
thick plantation of bananas and oranges,
quite equal to those they had seen on the
dreaded eastern side of the ridge. They
rushed upon the oranges that bestrewed the
ground, devoured several, and filled their
pockets with them. What with fish?they
were expert fishers by this time the bread-
fruit, and this fresh storehouse, they felt
no more anxiety about food, and if only
they could have lost their fear of possible


wild neighbours they would have had no-
thing to trouble the serenity of their healthy
life. But none of them was as yet ready to
tempt fate again by crossing the ridge, and
Elizabeth at any rate knew that while the
greater part of the island was shut to them,
they could never be quite easy in mind.
She felt that the uncertainty was even
harder to bear than knowledge would have
been.
One day their peaceful existence was
rudely disturbed, not by man, but by nature.
The island was visited by a storm*of quite
extraordinary violence. The air had been
for some time very oppressive, and the girls,
feeling incapable of any exertion, were rest-
ing in the hut, when there came a sudden
hot blast of wind straight in from the sea.
They looked out. Vast lurid clouds were
piling up; in a few seconds, it seemed, the
sky became black, and huge waves broke
over the reef, sending up mountains of
spray. The wind tore through the woods,
increasing every moment in fury. One
terrible blast ripped the slight hut to frag-
ments, and the girls had no sooner extri-
cated themselves from the heap of tattered
mats and broken canes that covered them,
than a flood of rain poured upon them!
They rushed away to the lee-side of a hillock,'
trying in vain to find shelter from the storm*
and cowering in terror as they heard peals


of thunder, and then a tremendous crash as
the tempest uprooted some great tree and
dashed it to the ground.
Mary was always terror-stricken in a
thunderstorm, and she clung half-fainting
to Elizabeth, who clasped her close in a
motherly embrace. Tommy, on the other
hand, was perfectly fearless. She gazed at
the boiling sea, and watched the lightning
with a sort of fascinated admiration. She
was almost sorry when the storm blew
itself out after two hours of fury, and the
sky cleared as rapidly as it had darkened.
? How lovely I ? she said, dripping wet
as she was. ? Poor old Mary 1 ?
Mary, indeed, was quite overcome, and it
was some time before she was able to walk
away. The tempest had left min in its
track.
? The boat 1 ? cried Elizabeth, suddenly
remembering the little vessel, which, though
it had been drawn up higher than when they
slept in it, she feared might have been
washed away. ?We must leave you for a
little, Mary. Walk about if you can, and
let the sun dry your things.?
Then she raced down to the shore with
Tommy, and was horrified to discover that
the boat had disappeared. The girls scanned
the sea, which was still rough, but there was
not a sign of it. They ran along the beach
northward, hoping that the boat might have


been cast up, and were rejoiced to find it
about a quarter of a mile away, bottom up-
wards on a spit of sand. It was some dis-
tance from the sea, which, though it had
evidently come much higher than usual,
had now receded to within a little of high-
water mark. The girls managed to right
the boat, only to find, of course, that the
oars were missing.
? How silly we were not to bring the oars
into the hut along with the boat-hook I ?
cried Elizabeth. ? The boat is perfectly
useless without the oars, and we can?t make
new ones.?
? Perhaps the tide will wash them up,?
said Tommy. ? Help me up this rock, Bess;
I?ll see if they are in sight.?
Mounted on the rock she scanned the
surface, and after a time saw something
bobbing up and down about a hundred
yards out, and some way to the south of
where she stood.
? There it is, I believe,? she cried. ? The
sea is getting calmer now; shall I swim out
for it ? ?
? You mustn?t think of it,? said Eliza-
beth. ? I dare say the sea is full of sharks.
I saw a fin yesterday when we were fish-
ing.?
? And you didn?t tell me I I should love
to see a real live shark.?
Elizabeth smiled inwardly at this.


? But we must get the oar somehow,
Bess. One would be better than nothing.
And quickly, too. See, the tide is running
out fast. And if the oar gets into the cur-
rent that flows past the reef, it is good-bye
for ever.?
? I don?t see how we can. We haven?t a
paddle of any kind. The boat-hook?s no
good. Wait, though; I wonder if we could
get a branch of a tree. Stay here and keep
the oar in sight while I run and look.?
She ran up the cliff-side, which was covered
with vegetation. The small trees had with-
stood the storm better than the large ones.
Some were cracked and broken, but others
had merely bent to the blast, while the
ground was strewn with the more massive
trunks, and with innumerable small branches
and twigs. In a little while she came to a
tree that had two boughs forming a fork,
in shape like a boy?s catapult. Catching
hold of this, and straining upon it, Elizabeth
managed to break it off; it had occurred to
her that the fork might form the skeleton
of a paddle. But time was too precious for
her to attempt to make it by herself alone, so
she ran with it to Mary.
? Quick, Mary,? she cried. ? Pull yourself
together. We have found the boat, but the
oars are gone, and one is floating out to sea.
Help me to make a paddle, so that we can
go after it. Get some creepers and some


leaves as quickly as you can. I?ll show you
what I mean.?
There was no lack of material close at
hand, and they were soon busily at work
making a sort of criss-cross lattice-work
upon the fork, which they notched at inter-
vals with their knives, to give holding to
the tendrils. Having rapidly made their
framework, they laid the leaves on it, and
bound these on with more creepers. Before
they had finished it as Elizabeth would have
liked, they heard Tommy?s shrill voice call-
ing?
? Quick, Bess, the oar?s going out fast.?
Elizabeth jumped up, carrying the odd-
looking paddle, which Tommy said was like a
lacrosse stick. The oar was now out of
sight, though Tommy could point to the
spot where she saw it last. They launched
the boat, and using the paddle as a stern-
oar, Tommy employed all the skill she had
gained by paddling the dinghy to and from
the shore at Southampton. The paddle was
a very poor thing; it bent a good deal, and
some of the tendrils became loose, and hung
about it like the string of an old cricket bat.
But there was no time to stop and repair
it, or the oar, which they now saw clearly,
would drift past the reef and utterly beyond
reach.
Elizabeth began to grow a little anxious
in case they should find themselves adrift


by and by with nothing better than the
makeshift paddle, which would certainly not
last more than a very short time. That
would be a calamity indeed, for they might
be carried far out to sea, and there was Mary
alone on the island. But Tommy was work-
ing so energetically that the distance between
the boat and the oar was fast lessening, and
Elizabeth, raising herself in her seat, sud-
denly caught sight of the second oar not far
beyond the first.
? Let me take your place, Tommy, she
said. ? You must be tired.?
?Not a bit. Besides, we?ll lose time if
we change, and perhaps upset. Stay where
you are, Bess; I?ll get that oar in a minute,
and then we?ll soon have the other one.?
A few more strokes brought the boat within
reach of the oar, and Elizabeth, bending
over, drew it up. Then Tommy left the stern
and both sat on the thwarts, pulling towards
the second oar, which they overtook in a few
seconds.
? We?ll keep the paddle as a memento,?
said Elizabeth. ?But look I What a terrible
distance we are from the shore I Mary will
be half frantic.?
? It?s lucky that we are inside the reef,?
said Tommy. ? Already I can feel the
current quite strong. We shall have to
pull hard to get out of it I ?
By this time Tommy was rather tired,


but she would not give in. It was a long
pull back, and at first it seemed impossible
to draw the boat out of the current that
was rapidly bearing it northward. But
having now two good oars, they succeeded
presently in getting back into calmer water.
Then, turning the boat?s head southward,
they rowed more gently along the shore,
and at last reached their own little harbour,
where Mary was awaiting them.
? I am thankful you have got back
safely,? she cried. ? When I saw you going
so far I nearly went mad for fear you couldn?t
return.?
? We must take care it never happens
again,? said Elizabeth. ? We?ll drag the
boat up much higher this time, and if we
tie the painter to a rock, or to a tree if there?s
one near enough, we needn?t be anxious, and
we?ll certainly keep the oars in the hut.?
?My dears, we haven?t a hut,? said Tommy.
? We be three poor mariners?vagabonds,
homeless, ragged and tanned. Who was
that old king who sat himself down in a
lonely mood to think, and watched a spider
spin its web over and over again, and thought
he couldn?t let a spider beat him and at
last beat all his enemies ? Oh, dear, that?s
made me out of breath. Robert Bruce,
wasn?t it, Mary ? ?
? Yes ; Mrs. Hemans wrote the poem.
? Bruce and the Spider,? it?s called.?


? I don?t care who wrote it, only we?ve
got to spin our web again. Oh, ? Will you
walk into my parlour, said the spider
to the fly ? ? 4 Please ?m, where?s the par-
lour ? ? says the fly. There, I?m a lunatic,
but I feel so jolly at having caught those
runaway oars. I say, are you dry ? I am.
That?s one advantage of living in a tropical
climate; if you get soaked you don?t have
to shiver while your things are dried at the
fire. 4 Homeless, ragged and tanned, who
so contented as I ? ? ? she sang, and Eliza-
beth, noticing the high spirits of her wild
young sister, hoped that there wouldn?t be a
reaction, and that Tommy was not going to
be ill.


CHAPTER XII
ALARMS AND DISCOVERIES
Contemplating the mins of the hut they
had built up with so much care, the girls
felt a very natural chagrin. You have seen
a child who has erected a fine house of
bricks fly into a rage when the structure
topples by its own weight, or at least look
utterly woebegone, and leave the scattered
bricks lying where they fell. Elizabeth
Westmacott and her sisters felt very much
the same disinclination to begin again.
The site was a picture of disorder. Portions
of the matting had been blown right away;
other portions in shreds and tatters had
found resting-places among the foliage of
the surrounding trees and shmbs. Some of
the canes of the roof dangled from the
boughs, others Uttered the ground amid a
tangle of creepers and leafage. No one
could have supposed that only a few hours
before the same place had been a model of
neatness.
? It will take an age to tidy up,? grumbled
Tommy. ?Is it worth while to bother
about a hut again ? ?


? I don?t like being without a roof over
our heads,? replied Elizabeth; ? but we
won?t start yet if you don?t feel inclined.
Let us go and take a look round.?
?We shall want some breadfruit for
dinner,? said Mary, ?so we had better go
that way. I dare say we shall find all we
need on the ground.?
They set off towards the breadfruit-trees.
Everywhere there were signs of the violence
of the storm, but they were surprised and
interested to notice that the worst havoc
had been wrought in almost a straight fine
across the island from south-west to north-
east.
It was as though some huge giant had
gone steadily forward wielding a monstrous
scythe. The tornado had cut a clean path
through the forest, leaving scarcely a tree
standing over a wide space. Where there
had been close, unbroken woodland was
now a bare avenue, interrupted by the
trunks of trees that had been thrown this
way and that. Impressed as the girls had
been with the fury of the tornado during
the time of their exposure to it, its devas-
tating power was brought home to them
now much more strongly. They looked with
awe upon its ravages.
? How thankful we ought to be that we
were not in its direct path I ? said Elizabeth.
? A little more to right or left and we should


have had trees crashing down upon us; we
might have all been killed.?
? It is a dreadful place,? said Tommy,
subdued and thoughtful. ? Oh, Bess, shall
we never be found and taken away ? ?
?We must hope on, dear. It will never
do to get downhearted. While we are all
well and strong we need not mind so very
much, and a ship is sure to come this way
some time or other.?
? But it might pass us,? said Mary. ? I
am sure our flag is blown away. Shall we
go and see ? ?
? Hadn?t we better fetch our breadfruit
first, now we are in this direction ? ?
?Of course. We shall have to light
another fire, too ; ours is sure to be out.?
They went on, and on arriving at the
breadfruit plantation found, as they had
expected, that the ground was littered with
fruit, which was already being devoured
by land-crabs, insects and birds. They
picked up several that were in good condi-
tion, and retraced their steps towards the
shore.
As they were passing through the fringe
of woodland, Tommy stopped suddenly, and
went down on her knees.
? Oh, do look ! ? she cried. ? Here?s a
nest on the ground, and the dearest little
white parrot you ever saw. Poor little
thing 1 I think it has lost its mother.?


The girls stooped to look at it, and Tommy
put her hand into the nest. The tiny bird
rustled in alarm, opening its beak to let out
a plaintive cry; but it was too young to use
its wings, and Tommy took it up and held
it gently.
? Its little heart is beating frantically,?
she said. ? Let us take it back with us and
try to rear it. You know I wanted one.?
?Do you think we can rear it ? ? said
Mary.
. . ... ? m i ? . ?? 1* 1
? It will starve if we leave it,? replied
Tommy. ? I shall love to try.?
The others agreed that there was no harm
in trying, so Tommy carried it carefully
back with her, now and then stroking the
ruffled feathers. When they got to their
camp she laid the bird on a bed of grass,
peeled one of the breadfruits, and held a
few crumbs of the pulp in the palm of
her hand just below the parrot?s beak.
But it was too young, or perhaps too
frightened, even to feed itself, and it would
have fared ill had not its captor been a
country girl and known how to deal with
such an emergency. She had seen young
birds fed by hand, and she at once cut a
thin stick and sharpened its end, upon which
she stuck a little bit of breadfruit. Then
holding the bird in her left hand, she waited
until it opened its beak to cry, and quickly
slipped the food in. The little bird swal-


lowed it greedily, much to Tommy?s delight,
and she went on feeding it until Elizabeth
suggested that she would kill it with excess.
? The poor thing was hungry,? said
Tommy. ? It?s not nearly so much alarmed
now. I shall keep it for a pet.?
? You?ll have to clip its wings, then,? said
Mary, ? or it is sure to fly away as soon as it
is strong enough.?
? You do it, Mary. Be very gentle, won?t
you ? ?
? There?s no need yet, perhaps,? suggested
Elizabeth. ?Doit in a day or two when it
has got over its fright. It would be just
as well to put it in the boat while we are
busy. You must take care not to overfeed
it, Tommy.?
After dinner they went first to the flag-
staff. Not a shred of their scarves was left.
As they had no material for making another
flag, except their handkerchiefs, which they
did not care to part with, and their wraps,
which they could not spare, they had to
give up for the moment any idea of erecting
a signal. Then they hastened in the oppo-
site direction, southward, to fetch bananas
and oranges for the other meals of the day.
A grave disappointment awaited them.
There was plenty of fruit on the ground,
but the trees themselves, standing in the
direct path of the storm, had all been up-
rooted or broken off, so that when they had


used their present supply they could obtain
no more at this spot. It would be necessary
to go once more in search of food, for they
found the breadfruit too insipid to form
their only vegetable diet. They knew the
district between their camp and the ruined
plantation ; nothing edible was to be had
there. The only other place where they
knew that fruit existed was to the east,
beyond the ridge; and even now they could
not make up their minds to revisit the
scene of their scare.
Next day, however, when Tommy had
fed her bird and Mary had clipped its -wings,
and they had spent an hour or so tidying
up the site of the hut preparatory to rebuild-
ing, they set off again in a southerly direc-
tion, having resolved to extend their explora-
tion within easy distance of the shore.
Crossing the broad path of uprooted trees,
flattened grass, and torn undergrowth, they
found as they proceeded that the ridge
hemmed them in, closer and closer to the
sea. This was partly due to the curving of
the shore, and partly to the diagonal lie
of the rising ground. Little foothills of the
ridge extended downwards towards the coast,
forming ridges in miniature, cut here and
there by streamlets.
On such expeditions Tommy almost always
led the way, for her restless and active tem-
perament was impatient of the sedater going


of her sisters. But she never went far ahead,
and every few minutes, as if alarmed at her
own daring, she would run back and keep
with the others for a time. She was thus
a few yards in advance when, as she mounted
a hillock, she came in sight of a number of
trees clustering almost at the edge of the
sea, and uttered an exclamation of surprise
and pleasure.
? Oh, do look here I ? she cried. ? I
believe we have come to some cocoanut
palms. You remember we saw some at
Valparaiso.?
The others ran to join her, and Mary at
once declared that she was right. There
was no mistaking the tall, smooth stems
with their feathery crowns. They all rushed
forward eagerly. Thanks to the storm, there
were several huge nuts strewing the ground
around each of the trees. Tommy, who was
first on the scene, picked up one of them and
turned it over in her hands in a puzzled way.
? Is it a cocoanut after all ? ? she said.
? It?s not a bit like those I have seen in
shops.?
? It?s a cocoanut right enough,? replied
Mary. ? But you?ve got to strip off the
outer husk before you come to the nut
itself.?
Tommy whipped out her knife and began
to cut away the coarse, fibrous covering.
It was very tough, and she soon declared


that it would never come off unless the
others helped her. So they all knelt on the
ground with the nut in the middle, and em-
ployed their knives energetically, until at
last the husk was removed. The shell inside
was ivory-white, very different from the old
brown nuts they had been used to see in
England. Being quite brittle, a small piece
was easily cut off the top, and they saw the
inside full of a pale, milky liquid.
? You first, Tommy,? said Elizabeth.
? You saw the trees first.?
Tommy took a sip of the liquid.
? Delicious 1 ? she said. ? I don?t think
I ever tasted anything so nice.?
She drank more, and, handing the nut to
Mary, continued ?
? It?s sweet, Bess, and sour too, some-
thing like lemonade, only not like it. It?s
like ?oh, I don?t know what it?s like ; just
itself, I suppose. Don?t drink it all, Mary.?
Elizabeth, when her turn came, pro-
nounced it a very refreshing drink, and they
were all delighted at so welcome an addition
to their larder. They collected as many
nuts as they could carry, and, returning to
their camp, stored them in the boat. In
the course of the next few days they went
several times to the same place, until they
had brought back all the nuts that lay on
the ground. It was fortunate that so many
had been thrown down, for they did not see


how they could have obtained them other-
wise. Even Tommy, the climber of the
family, confessed that she would have been
beaten by the smooth, straight stem of the
cocoanut palm. Mary had a dim recollec-
tion of reading that the natives had a way
of climbing the trees by means of a rope,
but she could not remember the details of
the method, and in any case, Tommy could
hardly have used it successfully without a
good deal of practice.
Once more relieved from anxiety about
food, the girls devoted themselves indus-
triously to the reconstruction of their hut.
Their former practice made their task easier.
In a few days the new house was finished,
and they were especially glad of its shelter
at night, instead of the cramping narrow-
ness of the boat.
Days had lengthened into weeks. The
notches on their calendar trunk told them
how time was flying?a sad reminder in
many ways. With so little to do they felt
the hours hang heavily on their hands,
though Tommy?s parrot gave them a little
amusement and interest. The bird had
become quite used to its mistress, and had
learnt to take its food from her hand. Its
voice, not of very charming quality, as all
confessed, grew stronger, and it became
accustomed to give a quaint little scream
whenever Tommy approached. She would


set it on her finger and talk to it, using the
same word over and over again, in the hope
that it would by and by pick up a phrase
or two. But although it became perfectly
tame, it could never be induced to substi-
tute civilized words for its natural scream
and squawk.

? You little silly-billy ! ? cried Tommy
one day, after an hour?s patient instruction.
? What?s the good of you for a pet ? There !
Perch on my shoulder, and don?t make such
an idiotic noise, for goodness? sake.?
Tommy at last gave up the attempt in
despair; but she became very fond of the
bird, and declared that when they were
rescued she would certainly take it home
with her.
It was wonderful how the hope of rescue
never died. When each day ended without
the sight of the longed-for vessel, they would
say, ? Never mind, perhaps it will come to-
morrow.? And when to-morrow had the
same disappointment, there was still to-
morrow. So they lived from day to day,
veering from hope to despondency, and from
despondency to hope again.
They had almost forgotten Tommy?s
fright.* Surely, they thought, they must
have seen some one by this time if the island
was inhabited. Yet there was the same
misgiving, the same disinclination to cross
the ridge. Elizabeth laughed at herself,


and more than once said she really must
break through her reluctance. But it ended
there. Her heart failed her when it came
to the point.
Easy though their life was, it had its dis-
comforts. The breadfruit gave out, and
having found no more oranges or bananas,
they grew very tired of a diet of fish and
cocoanuts. They had seen other fruits, and
shrubs bearing berries that looked very
enticing, but the fear of poison deterred them
from trying anything that they did not
know.
The want of a change of clothes, too, was
a trouble to them, and their boots had be-
come unwearable. They had often been
soaked in sea-water, and then, drying in the
sun, had cracked and become worse than
useless. They got into the habit of going
barefoot, except when they set out for a
long walk. In the hut, and when walking
on the grass, they were comfortable enough,
but on rough ground they suffered a good
deal at first. In course of time, however,
helped by frequent soaking in sea-water,
their feet became hardened, and they felt no
inconvenience in going about unshod.
They had more than once noticed some
very small bees, hardly larger than house-
flies, flitting among the flowers. One day
Elizabeth suggested that they should try to
And out whether these Polynesian bees made


honey, and if so, where it was. Tommy
hailed the suggestion, and started at once
to track the bees to their nests. For a long
time she had no success. Only after many
days did she, almost by accident, light upon
a bees?-nest in a hole in the trunk of a tree.
Informing her sisters of the discovery, she
proposed that they should smoke the bees
out.
They kindled a small fire at the base
of the tree, immediately beneath the hole.
When they thought they had allowed plenty
of time for the smoke to stupefy the bees,
they put on their macintoshes, pulling the
hoods well down over their heads, and per-
pared to rifle the hole. It was so small that
a hand could scarcely pass through it, and
Mary suggested that they should enlarge it,
so that they might see what they were doing.
Accordingly they stripped off the bark round
the hole, until it was much more capacious.
Unluckily, the inrush of fresh air ap-
peared to revive the little inhabitants,
which darted out with fierce buzzings, put-
ting the robbers to utter rout. They ran
off with their heads down, waving their
arms wildly to beat off the furious insects.
Tommy got off scot free, but Elizabeth and
Mary were stung slightly, and but for the
smoking, which had not been wholly ineffec-
tual, the bees would probably have hurt them
severely.


? We won?t be beaten by a parcel of silly
bees,? said Tommy, as they went home.
? You aren?t much hurt, are you ? ?
? I feel a burning spot in my cheek,? said
Elizabeth.
? And one of my fingers is swelling,? added
Mary.
?As we haven?t any ointment, or any-
thing, you?ll just have to get well by your-
selves,? remarked Tommy. ? You?ll have
another try, won?t you ? ?
? Oh, yes 1 We?ll give them a larger dose
next time,? said Elizabeth. ? I think we
ought to have some reward for our enter-
prise.?
A day or two afterwards they visited the
hole again. By means of a larger fire, fed
with leaves that gave off a very pungent
smoke, they managed to stupefy the bees
thoroughly. When they examined the hole
they were surprised to find, not large combs,
as in an English hive, but a collection of
bags of brown wax, about the size of a wal-
nut, united in a regular mass.
? Fancy bees having foreign ways 1 ? said
Tommy. ? I should have thought that bees
were the same all the world over.?
? I don?t see why bees shouldn?t be dif-
ferent, like people,? said Mary. ? They?re
very intelligent.?
The others laughed at this curious reason
for differences of habit. The honey, they


found, was more fluid than they were accus-
tomed to in England, and in taste and smell
it was slightly scented. They took a good
quantity home with them, but it did not go
very well with fish, and even with cocoanuts
it was a doubtful joy.
? If we only had some breadfruit, or even
bananas, we should like it better, said
Mary.
? We can only get those by going across
the ridge again,? said Elizabeth. ? Shall
we venture ? ?
? I won?t,? said Tommy decidedly. ? I?m
not going to be scared out of my wits for
anybody.?
? I?ll go with you, Bess,? said Mary, after
a little hesitation. ?It really is silly to be
afraid of nothing.?
But, as it turned out, the first of the three
to brave the peril was, after all, Tommy
herself.


CHAPTER XIII
LOST
That night, for the first time in their resi-
dence on the island, the girls were awakened
by a patter of rain. Only once before had
rain fallen, and that was during the tornado.
Now the sound of it upon the thatch of the
hut was very slight, but the girls slept so
lightly that a whisper was almost enough to
disturb them.
? I hope we are not in for another smash
up,? said Elizabeth, finding that her sisters
were both awake.
? There?s no wind at present,? returned
Mary. ? Rain alone won?t hurt us. I ex-
pect it?s the rainy season beginning, and we
shall have weeks of it.?
?How disgusting!? exclaimed Tommy.
? I always hated having to stay indoors,
and it will be worse than ever here, with no
cosy fire and nice story-book. What?s the
time, Bess ? ?
She leant over towards Elizabeth, who
lay next to her, and showed a light with her
match-lighter. Elizabeth looked at her
watch, which she never forgot to wind.
L 161


? It?s about four o?clock,? she said.
? Time for another snooze before day-
light,? said Tommy, snuggling down again
into her wraps. In a minute or two she
was fast asleep.
The other girls remained wide awake, and
talked quietly together.
? I wish we knew our whereabouts better,?
said Elizabeth. ?If we only knew what
those islands are that we have seen in the
distance, we might perhaps row to one of
them and find friends.?
? Yes; of course there are missionaries,?
said Mary. ? Don?t you remember Uncle
Ben told us of a friend of his who was
returning to his station ? What was his
name, Bess ? ?
? I forget. We can?t venture across the
sea, can we ? ?
? Oh, no I There are thousands of islands,
and I believe some have never been visited
by white people at all. We might land
among cannibals ! ?
?We are certainly better off here. I can?t
believe there are any people on this island,
in spite of Tommy, or why haven?t we seen
something of them ? We?ll go to the ridge
after breakfast, as we said, and settle the
matter once for all.?
? Supposing there are people ? ? said Mary.
?As I said before, I think we ought to
try and make friends with them, and if they


seem inclined to be unfriendly, perhaps we
could make them afraid of us. Tommy?s
match-lighter would startle them, wouldn?t
it??
? It might, but I don?t like to think of
having to rely on that sort of thing for our
safety. They would soon find out our real
weakness, and then Oh I I do hope we
shall not see anybody. We should be so
much more uncomfortable.?
? Tommy?s birthday is somewhere about
now. We can?t be quite sure of the date,
because we didn?t begin to cut notches at
once; but we should be right within a day or
two. The present she would like best would
be some oranges from beyond the ridge, and
certain news that the island is uninhabited.?
? How strange it seems to hope that there
are no human beings near us 1 Do you
know, Bess, I think the people of these
islands must be very melancholy.?
? Why should you think that ? I have
always supposed them to be a happy, light-
hearted folk, with not a care in the world.?
? But they have nothing to do. Their
food grows for them without work, and they
don?t need many clothes. They?ve no books
to read, no amusements ?
? How do you know that ? ?
? Well, what amusements can they have ?
Isn?t it only civilized people who play
games ? ?


? I don?t know. I seem to remember
that even savages gamble, if that is amuse-
ment; it wouldn?t be to me if I lost.?
? Then you?re no sport, Bess,? said Tommy,
who had awakened and caught the last few
words. ? It?s the excitement they like,
whether they win or lose. I should be a
dreadful gambler, I know, if I had the
chance.?
? Then I hope you will never have it,
dear,? said Elizabeth. ?It is an unhealthy
excitement, I am sure. We were talking
about your birthday, Tommy. It might be
yesterday, to-day, or to-morrow, but you
are fourteen. We?ll wish you many happy
returns now.?
? Oh, I wish you hadn?t reminded me,?
cried Tommy. ? Think of being fifteen
and sixteen, and twenty, and getting old on
this island I I don?t want to grow old at
all, and it would be dreadful here. I?d be
a scullery maid, or a beggar girl?anything
in England, rather than stay here. Shall we
ever get away ? ?
And Tommy nestled to Elizabeth?s side,
and as she lay encompassed by her elder
sister?s arms she prayed with all her heart
that God would send help to them soon.
When dawn broke and they got up, it was
a dreary world upon which they looked. Sea
and earth were covered with a clinging mist.
\ drizzle was falling. Everything was


sodden and forlorn. The fire was out, and
there were no dry sticks for re-lighting it.
They had to content themselves with a
breakfast of cocoanuts, and then they sat
inside the hut, too much depressed in spirit
to go out, or do anything but watch the
rain.
Presently the drizzle became a downpour,
which went on for an hour or two, then
suddenly ceased, the sun bursting through
the leaden sky. They took advantage of
this to gather a quantity of twigs, which they
carried into the hut to dry there. Elizabeth
had just suggested that Mary and she should
start on their expedition to the ridge, when
a sharp shower drove them again to shelter.
So it went on all day?heavy showers that
lasted for a few minutes alternating with
brief, bright intervals.
There was no doubt that the rainy season
had begun. The girls were practically con-
fined to the hut for many days in succession,
only sallying forth to catch fish, which they
cooked at a new stove built nearer the hut.
The showers were sometimes light, some-
times very heavy, and at last the rain began
to drip through the thatched roof, and the
girls had to sit in their macintoshes. Though
the sun appeared every now and then, it
did not shine long enough to dry the ground
before another downpour soaked it. They
all became very low-spirited, and could not


find any occupation to pass away the time,
for even weaving was impossible with the
sodden grass.
Their troubles came to a climax one day
when Mary complained of a racking head-
ache. Feeling her hot brow, Elizabeth
feared she had taken a fever, no doubt owing
to the exhalation from the damp earth work-
ing on a lowered system. She and Tommy
felt much concern, which became real alarm
when they found Mary rapidly becoming
worse. She could not eat, and lay on her
mat bed covered with the macintoshes and
wraps of the other girls, her cheeks flushed,
her eyes bright and glassy. Towards even-
ing, when Elizabeth had left the hut to fetch
water for the night, and Tommy sat by the
invalid, she was startled to hear Mary talking
in a very strange way.
?No milk to-day?there?s something
wrong with Dapple ?Jane, Uncle Ben?s com-
ing to-morrow. Don?t forget the ? Then
her voice died away into an indistinguish-
able muttering. Presently Tommy caught
more phrases : ? Oh, no, no 1 They?ll eat
us: don?t let Tommy go. Bess I Bess I
they?re coming after me I ?Dan will carry
the luggage, Uncle I ?
So she raved on, in her delirium babbling
about the farm, the ship, her friends, a word
every now and again showing how much the
fear of cannibals had occupied the back-


ground of her mind. Tommy was terrified.
She had never seen any one delirious except
her father just before he died, and she was
smitten with an agonizing fear that Mary
would not recover.
? Oh, Bess, she?s out of her mind 1 ? she
cried piteously, as Elizabeth returned. ?What
shall we do ? ?
Elizabeth went quickly to the bed, dipped
a handkerchief in the water she had brought,
and laid it on Mary?s fevered head.
? We must sit up with her to-night,? she
said. ? Don?t give way, Tommy dear. She
will soon be better. The fever came on so
suddenly that I am sure it is one of those
sharp attacks that don?t last long. But it
will leave her very weak, and we must be
very careful of her. I do so wish we had
some oranges; the juice is so cooling.?
But it was too late to think of looking for
oranges, and they had to be satisfied with
water and cocoanut milk, which they gave
Mary in sips. All night long they remained
at her side, watching her with distress as
her teeth chattered as if with cold, and then
next moment she tossed about on her little
mat bed, and flung the macintoshes off as
if she could not bear the heat. Elizabeth
tried to induce Tommy to lie down for a
little, but the young girl refused, saying that
she could not rest until she knew that Mary
was better.


? I will get some oranges to-morrow,? said
Elizabeth. ? I am sure they will do her
good.?
Towards morning Mary dropped off to
sleep, and then Tommy was persuaded to
lie down. The sun had risen when she awoke
to find Elizabeth still watching over her
sleeping sister.
? I?ll just run down to the stream and
bathe my face,? said Elizabeth. ? She is
still asleep. Give her a little water if she
wakes; I shan?t be long. Luckily, it?s a fine
morning.?
She returned in a few minutes.
? Now you run down and wash, Tommy,?
she said; ?it?ll freshen you. I?ve put in
some fish to bake for breakfast.?
Tommy rose and left the hut. During
Elizabeth?s absence she had strung herself
up to a great resolution. Mary must have
oranges, but the one to fetch them should not
be Elizabeth. She was so calm and steady
and capable that she would do far better to
stay and look after Mary. ? I can be best
spared,? thought Tommy, ? but I know
Bess won?t let me go if I propose it. I shall
just do it without telling her. It won?t take
long to scamper to the orange grove and
back again.?
She had not forgotten her former fright;
but she told herself that perhaps she might
get to the oranges without being observed,


and she was ready to do anything for Mary,
of whom she was very fond, though they
sparred sometimes. So, after bathing her
face in the stream, she went to the stove
and scratched on the sand in front of it with
her knife the words, ? Gone to the orange
grove.? Then, without waiting, for fear her
courage failed, she ran swiftly along the
bank of the stream, munching a piece of
cocoanut as she went.
In the hut Mary had awakened perfectly
sensible, and wondering why she felt so
weak. Elizabeth bathed her face and hands,
smoothed her hair, and having tried to make
her a little more comfortable, gave her a
drink of cocoanut milk.
? What?s the matter with me, Bess ? ? she
asked.
? You?ve had a touch of fever. You?ll
soon be all right again. I?m going to get
you some oranges presently. You will enjoy
them.?
?Yes, I shall. Have I been ill long ? I
feel as weak as anything.?
? Only one night, dear. We shall have
to feed you up. You ought to have beef
tea or chicken broth, of course; but we shall
have to do the best we can. I think we
must try to snare a bird of some sort.?
? Wbere?s Tommy ? ?
? Just run down to wash. I dare say
she?ll bring back the fish with her. I put


some to bake. You could eat a little, couldn?t
you ? ? .
? I?ll try, but I don?t feel much like eating.
I want to go to sleep again.?
And, indeed, in a few minutes she was
sleeping. ? The very best thing she could
do,? said Elizabeth to herself.
A quarter of an hour passed and Tommy
had not returned. ? I wonder why she is
lagging,? thought Elizabeth. She went to
the entrance of the hut and looked down
towards the shore. The trees hid the stove
from her, and she did not call out for fear of
waking Mary. She went back into the hut
and sat down; but after five minutes, when
there was still no Tommy, her vague wonder
grew into a slight feeling of alarm. Seeing
that Mary was still asleep, she went out
again, and ran swiftly down towards the
stove, glancing to the left with a half expecta-
tion of discovering Tommy fishing on the
rocks. But Tommy was not in sight, and
Elizabeth soon learnt why, as her eye caught
the scribble on the sand.
? How plucky I ? she thought. ? But the
child will be terrified before she gets there;
I had better fetch her back.?
But with a moment?s reflection she saw
that she could not expect to catch Tommy
before she reached the top of the ridge. If
there was any danger Tommy would have
run into it by the time she could be over-


taken. Mary was so weak that Elizabeth
did not care to leave her for long; but she
ran some distance up the stream, as far as
the broad, bare avenue made by the storm,
and then was on the point of giving a shrill
call when she checked herself. The sound
might cause the very harm she wished to
avoid. Perturbed, and somewhat vexed as
well, she hastened back, feeling that at
present Mary must be her chief care. She
reflected that, after all, though they had
been now more than two months on the
island, they had never met any other person,
and had no real reason to think it was in-
habited. Surely if the object Tommy had
seen was actually a human being, they would
by this time have had other evidence of
his existence. Thus reassuring herself, she
hurried back, took out of the oven the fish
that was already over-baked, and regained
the hut. To her great relief Mary was still
fast asleep. Elizabeth dreaded the effect
upon her if she suspected that anything had
happened to Tommy.
As she ate her breakfast, reserving some
of the fish for Tommy, she felt decidedly
annoyed at the young girl?s escapade.
Tommy ought to have mentioned what she
intended, thought Elizabeth. But Tommy
had been from her earliest years impulsive
and heedless, so that her present disobedi-
ence ?for so Elizabeth had come to regard


it, forgetting that no instructions had been
given?was quite apiece with former in-
stances. Then Elizabeth made amends to
Tommy in her heart. ? She has been very
good all this time,? she thought. ?I do wish
she would come back.?
But the hours dragged by, and still Tommy
had not appeared. Mary awoke, and look-
ing round the hut, inquired again for Tommy.
? She has run up to get some oranges,?
said Elizabeth, as calmly as she could, though
she felt very troubled.
? Tommy has ? ? said Mary, in surprise.
? Gone alone to where she saw the face ?
Oh, you shouldn?t have let her, Bess.?
? I wouldn?t have, only I did not know.
She scrawled on the sand to say that she
had gone. I suppose she thought I would
make a better nurse than she.?
? She?s a dear, brave girl,? said Mary,
? and I shall like the oranges all the better.?
Elizabeth got her to eat a little fish, cold
as it now was, and presently she dropped
off to sleep again. It was past dinner-
time; the sun was very hot, and Elizabeth,
thoroughly alarmed at Tommy?s protracted
absence, wondered if, after her trying night,
she had been overcome by the heat, and was,
perhaps, lying helpless somewhere. She felt
that she must try to find her; so, slipping
out of the hut, she ran as fast as her feet
would carry her up through the woods, never


pausing until she had crossed the ridge and
come to the orange grove. She had looked
about her as she ran, and, now regardless of
consequences, had called Tommy several
times, but she saw neither her nor any living
person, and there was no answer to her calls.
At the grove there were oranges and
bananas scattered here and there on the
ground, so that Tommy?s absence could not
be due to any difficulty in obtaining what
she came for. And then Elizabeth?s heart
stood still as she noticed at one spot, a
strange collection of objects. There were
four or five oranges on the ground close
together, and with them Tommy?s knife, the
little stick she had fed her parrot with, a
piece of hair-ribbon, and a wedge of cocoa-
nut. What had happened ? These objects
were obviously the contents of Tommy?s
pocket; why had she placed them there, and
where was she ? Had she been startled ?
Had some natives come stealthily upon her,
and seized her ? Would they not at least
have taken the knife at the same time ?
Elizabeth felt a shiver of fear, along with
utter bewilderment. But she crushed down
her uneasy imaginings and, placing Tommy?s
belongings in her pocket, began to search
among the trees, shouting from time to time,
no matter who might hear her. Suddenly
her eye was caught by the flutter of a small
coloured object at some distance among the


bushes. With a thrill of hope she hastened
towards it, but long before she reached it,
she realized that her hope was vain; the
object was only a bit of tattered cloth
attached to one of the line of poles they
had seen on their former visit. Retracing
her steps to the orange grove, she went in
and out among the trees, shouting Tommy?s
name again and again. Her distress at
Tommy?s disappearance was coupled with
anxiety about Mary. It was now a con-
siderable time since she had left the hut, and
she felt that, with Mary so weak and help-
less, she could not stay to search any longer.
Thrusting a few oranges into her pocket for
the invalid, she hastened back, conscious
that she herself was weak and shaky. The
long, anxious search in the fierce sunlight,
following a sleepless night, had been almost
too much for her strength.
She tried to enter the hut unconcernedly,
with a dim hope that Tommy might have
returned before her. Mary was awake.
? Why did you leave me ? ? she said, in
the querulous tone of an invalid, her eyes
filling with tears. ? I?ve called and called
for you and Tommy, but you wouldn?t come.
I am so miserable.?
? Here are some oranges, dear,? said
Elizabeth gently. ? I will squeeze the
juice into a cup for you. It will do you
good.?


? Thank you so much. I?m a wretched
bad patient, Bess dear, but I got it into my
silly head that you had deserted me. Ridicu-
lous, wasn?t it ? This is delicious. It was
kind of Tommy to get them for me. Where
is she ? ?
Elizabeth was in a quandary. Mary
seemed a little better; her querulousness
was a good sign; but it would not further
her recovery to tell her that Tommy was
missing. On the other hand, Elizabeth her-
self was so much distressed that she would
have liked to pour out her troubles to a
sympathetic ear. But she thought it best
to keep the bad news to herself for the
present, and said?
? She must have quite recovered her
courage, and gone roaming. You are getting
on, aren?t you, dear ? ?
?Yes, only rather weak still. But these
oranges are delicious. I feel much refreshed.
Don?t sit up with me to-night, Bess; I am
sure I shall be all right, and you mustn?t
wear yourself out. Put some oranges near
me, so that I can get one in the night without
disturbing you.?
She soon fed asleep again, and did not
awaken until it was quite dark. She was
careful not to disturb her sister, and so did
not become aw r are until the morning that
Tommy had not returned. Elizabeth had
spent a sleepless night, and felt quite worn


out when day broke. Mary was quick to
notice her distress, of which she knew she
could not be the cause, since she was so
much better.
? You are hiding something, Bess, ieil
me; has something happened to Tommy ? ?
Elizabeth, on the verge of a breakdown,
was glad to pour out the whole story.
?Oh, why didn?t you tell me before!
cried Mary.* ?You must go at once and
look for her again. There is really nothing
the matter with me now. Do, please, go,
Bess. It is awful to think of what may
have happened.? , . ,
Hastily getting Mary a little food, Eliza-
beth set out for the orange grove, and
searched it and the neighbourhood through
and through, calling Tommy?s name until
she was hoarse. Once in response to her
shouts, she thought she heard a faint cry,
and hurried in the direction from which she
supposed it to have come.
At that moment she felt that she would
have welcomed the appearance of a native;
the sight of any human face would have
been a comfort. But her search was still
fruitless; neither Tommy nor any one else
appeared; and Elizabeth thought she must
have been mistaken. The birds were tril-
ling and chattering in the woods, and among
so many sounds it was easy to deceive
oneself.


At length, when she had been several
hours absent, she felt that she must return
in case Mary should be wondering whether
she too had disappeared. She could hardly
drag herself home. At the entrance of the
hut she found Mary looking anxiously to-
wards the ridge.
? You shouldn?t have got up,? she said.
? Oh, Mary, I can?t find her, and I am so
tired.?
For a moment it looked as if she would
break down utterly, but she controlled her-
self, and in response to Mary?s entreaty, lay
down to rest. Fatigue even overcame her
distress of mind, and for an hour or two she
slept heavily. Then she awoke with a start,
and declared that she must go and search
again. Swallowing a little food, she set off,
and thoroughly hunted over a wider area
than before, not returning until the evening.
? It?s no good,? she said, despairing.
? Poor Tommy?s gone.?
? Don?t say so,? said Mary. ? You haven?t
seen any one, have you ? ?
? Nobody.?
? Then she may only be lost. You know
how venturesome she is, and having found
no one to be afraid of perhaps she has gone
right over the island, and sprained her ankle
or something. Have a good sleep, Bess.
To-morrow weil both go. I?m sure I shall
be strong enough.?


Next morning, after a breakfast of bananas
and oranges ?for there was, of course, no
fish ?the girls set off together. Mary,
although a little ? tottery,? as she said, was
able to walk slowly, and she declared it was
much better for her to go too, than to remain
at home wondering what was happening.
Elizabeth had to support her, and she stopped
for frequent rests; but they came at length
to the orange grove.
? Now, I?ll stay here,? she said, ? in the
shade of the trees, while you go round and
round; and if you don?t find her here, go
right over the ridge and cooee every few
seconds. I won?t stir until you come back.?


CHAPTER XIV
IN THE PIT
When Tommy left the hut she ran with
all the fleetness of her young legs up towards
the ridge. All the way she said to herself,
?I won't be afraid, I won?t, I won?t,? keeping
up her courage also with the thought of
the surprise she would give her sisters when
she returned laden with fruit.
The morning was somewhat misty, but
the mist was not so thick as to hide the
general features of the country. As before,
she followed the course of the stream, and
w?hen she came to the swamp she turned to
the right, and continued as nearly as possible
in a straight line with the crest. Arriving
at the top, she stopped for a few moments
rather puzzled. The appearance of the
country was unfamiliar; the spot she had
reached w r as certainly not the place to which
she, with her sisters, had come on the former
excursion. It was clear that she had
wandered somewhat from the proper route.
She w r ent on, the very difficulty in wdiich
she found herself helping to strengthen her
179


determination. There were trees on all
sides, but for some time she discovered none
that were bearing oranges. At length, how-
ever, as the mist lifted, she perceived some
golden spots among the foliage, and ran
towards them. She hoped that this was
not the orange grove in which she had been
so much frightened, and a return of her
nervousness made her quicken her pace
and gather, in a kind of frantic haste, a
number of oranges that bespattered the
ground.
In order to turn her journey to the utmost
advantage she meant to fill her pocket with
oranges and take as many as possible in her
hands as well. But remembering that her
pocket was usually full of all sorts of odds
and ends, she knelt down to empty it and
throw away what was useless, so as to have
more room for the oranges. She had just
laid on the ground her knife and a few odd-
ments when, throwing in spite of herself a
nervous glance around, she noticed a slight
movement in the bushes on her right the
direction in which she had come. She could
not help looking again, and then she sprang
to her feet transfixed with terror. There
was the same little brown face peering out
from among the background of foliage. For
a few seconds the two pairs of eyes remained
staring at each other; then, scarcely knowing
what she did. but in an instinctive movement


of defence, Tommy waved her arms towards
the bush.
The face instantly disappeared, but Tommy
in her agitation forgot her errand, forgot the
things she had placed beside her, and took
to her heels, flying in a blind panic from the
spot. She did not even stay to make sure
she was going in the right direction; she had
quite lost command of herself, and regardless
of thorns and creepers that tore her skirts
and tripped her steps, she plunged through
the undergrowth. Every sound seemed to
her excited imagination to be made by
pursuers following upon her track. Suddenly
the earth gave way beneath her, she felt
herself sinking, sinking. ? Bess I Bess! ? she
screamed, and then she knew no more.
When she regained consciousness she
found herself in semi-darkness. For a
moment she was simply bewildered; she
was half smothered with twigs, leaves and
earth; then she remembered all that had
happened and sprang to her feet. But an
excruciating pain in her left ankle caused her
to fall back, and the agony was so intense
that she remained for some time in a half-
fainting condition. Presently she recovered.
A second attempt to rise gave her such a
twinge that she knew her ankle was seriously
sprained; to move without help was im-
possible.
Her fear of the little brown face was over-


come by a still greater anxiety. Where
was she ? She looked about her. Some
distance above her head, considerably higher
than the rooms at the farm, was a wide
opening. She must have fallen into a pit.
But it seemed to her a strange pit, for, her
eyes becoming accustomed to the dimness,
she saw that the floor upon which she lay
was much broader than the opening at the
top.
An insect touching her hand made her
jump : and with a feeling of horror she won-
dered if the pit was infested with noxious
creatures that would sting her to death.
She shouted, frantically, again and again,
but her voice only seemed to be thrown back
at her ; and when she remembered how far
off her sisters were, she realized that her cries,
if they were heard above, could bring only
the savages from whom she had fled.
For a time she cowered among the trash,
overwhelmed with despair. Then, when she
was calm enough to think, it was only to
recognize more fully the seriousness of her
plight. Her sisters could never guess what
had become of her. If they took alarm at
her absence, and Elizabeth came in search
of her, it was quite likely that she would
never discover the spot. Perhaps even she
might be captured by the natives, for the
sight of the little brown face had convinced
Tommy that beyond the ridge the island was


overrun with cannibals. It was nothing to
her that they had never appeared on her side
of the island; she told herself that they had
simply waited until they could catch one
girl alone. Nor did it seem to her ridiculous
that a tribe of bloodthirsty savages should
be so timorous as to refrain from openly
attacking three defenceless girls.
The dreadful thought occurred to her,
?Am Ito die in this prison ? ? The prospect
of such a fate made her shiver. She felt
that even to fall into the hands of cannibals
was preferable to a lingering death in this pit,
and again she raised her voice in wild cries
for help, repeating them until she was
exhausted. For some time she remained
in a state of stupor : but when she was able
to collect herself she wondered whether, in
spite of her injured foot, she could, by any
exertion of her own, escape. She crept on
hands and knees to the side of the pit; but
even if she had been able to use her foot she
saw that she could never climb up those
sloping walls.
Glancing round, however, she saw that in
the wall to her right there was an opening
yawning black. She crawled to it, and
peered in. It was so dark that she could
see nothing beyond a yard. But she felt
a faint hope that it might be a passage
leading somehow to the level ground. Recol-
lecting her automatic match-box, which,


fortunately, she kept attached to her belt,
she threw its small flickering light on the
scene. She saw now that she was indeed
at the entrance of a tunnel. It could not be
a short one if it led to the outer air, for there
was no glimmer of light from its black depths.
But it was worth trying; so, the light, small
as it was, giving her a sense of security, she
began to creep slowly along the dark passage,
every now and again wincing as a pang shot
through her injured foot.
It was a strange tunnel; not rounded and
of regular shape like the railway tunnels at
home, but varying in width and height.
In some places the roof was beyond the range
of Tommy?s feeble light; at others it came so
low that she could not have stood upright.
The floor was uneven, the walls were rugged,
a recess here, a protuberance there. Clearly
it had not been cut by the hands of men,
but must be attributed to a freak of nature.
To Tommy, crawling inch by inch along
the ground, it seemed that the tunnel would
never end. How long it was, how many
minutes or hours this painful progress con-
tinued, she was quite unable to guess. At
last, with a cry of gladness, she saw a faint
gleam of light beyond, and tried to advance
more quickly, so as to gain liberty and fresh
air. The light came through an aperture
in the wall that appeared to be the end of
the passage. It was high above the ground,


and Tommy, standing on one foot, was just
able to look through it. She thought that
if she could only manage to heave herself
up to it, the aperture was just wide enough
to let her body through.
But first of all she must make sure that
it led to safety. It was not full daylight
outside; beyond the wall there appeared to
be, not open space, but another confined
chamber. Supposing she climbed up and
got through, how far would she have to
drop to reach the ground on the other side ?
and what if she should find herself only in
another place from which escape would be
no easier than from the pit ?
To stand on one foot was fatiguing, and
Tommy had to sit down and rest for a little.
She had now recovered from her panic, and
was ready to bend all her young wits upon
the problem of escape. Presently a means
occurred to her of discovering at least whether
it would be safe for her to make an attempt
to clamber through the aperture. She felt
along the floor for a piece of rock, and stand-
ing up again, dropped it over the ledge. In
an instant there came a faint thud, and
immediately afterwards a great whirring and
screaming. She was quick to infer that the
ground was at some depth below the opening,
and that the falling rock had disturbed a
colony of birds of some kind. ? Can I be
at the top of a cliff ? ? she thought.


Plainly it was impossible to escape in this
direction. The dashing of her hope almost
made Tommy weep. She had done no good;
indeed had only wasted time. There was
nothing for it but to crawl back to the pit;
and as she wearily crept through the passage
despair seized upon her heart; she felt the
choking sensation of helpless misery.
Her terror was even deepened when, on
getting back to the pit, she found that it
was now quite dark. Through the opening
she could see the stars overhead, but there
was no pleasure in watching them as she had
many times watched them from the hut. She
crouched upon the leaves, scarcely able to
bear the throbbing pain in her foot; and when
presently she fell asleep from sheer exhaus-
tion, it was with a prayer on her lips :
? God help me, and let me see my sisters
again.?
Pain and thirst awakened her several
times before dawn. A slight shower fell
during the night, and by catching the rain-
drops in her outspread palm she was able to
moisten her parched lips. She also wetted
her handkerchief and bound it about her
inflamed ankle, thus easing the pain a little.
When it was quite light overhead she began
to shout again, her voice sounding very
cracked and hoarse. Soon she had to give
up even this; her tongue and the roof of her
mouth were so dry that she could not utter


a word. Then she lost all hope, and lying
down sobbed herself to sleep.
When she awoke it was again dark. Her
foot was much less painful, but she felt more
hungry and thirsty than ever before in her
life. If only she had filled her pocket with
oranges before she saw that little brown face 1
Again the idea came to her of attempting to
climb the side of the pit by cutting steps in
the earth; but on feeling in her pocket she
remembered that she had dropped her knife
on the ground. Hobbling across the pit she
felt along the walls, only to find, as before,
that their slope made it quite impossible to
clamber up. Then feeling that starvation
must be her doom, she sank back and lay in
a state of dreamy somnolence.
All at once she was startled into wake-
fulness by a faint sound somewhere above
her. She sprang up. Sunlight was stream-
ing through the opening ; the sound came
again. It was some one calling. Tommy
tried to shout in answer, but the feeble
croak that was all she could utter dismayed
her. With help at hand, she might not be
heard I The call above was now quite clear.
It was coming nearer. She heard her own
name. But the more she tried to call the
less she seemed able to make a sound. The
voice above began to recede. Then with a
last desperate effort she did manage to
produce a hoarse cry that she could scarcely


believe came from her own throat, so strange
it was. It seemed to have used up all the
little strength she had left, and she fell
exhausted to the ground, believing that the
last chance of rescue had now utterly
vanished.


CHAPTER XV
THE ELEVENTH HOUR
Some little time after Elizabeth had left
her, Mary fancied that she caught a faint
cry. She shouted to her sister, who was out
of sight, but whose voice she heard calling
at intervals. The feeble sound seemed to
have come from a patch of woodland not a
great distance from the track which Elizabeth
had taken. But as the wind was blowing
from that quarter, Mary realized that al-
though she could hear Elizabeth it was
probably impossible for Elizabeth to hear
her. She felt very tired after her long walk,
and doubted whether she could go far with-
out her sister?s sustaining arm; but the
thought that Elizabeth might wander out
of reach while Tommy was in danger near
at hand gave her an artificial strength. She
rose from the ground and tottered in the
direction from which the cry had appeared
to come. Every now and then she stopped,
listening for a repetition of the sound; but
she heard nothing except the rustle of the
wind and Elizabeth?s shouts, growing fainter
and fainter in the distance.


In a few moments she had passed beyond
the orange grove, and felt that she was in
danger of losing her way. Even Elizabeth?s
voice soon ceased to guide her. She stum-
bled along, shouting every few steps, with no
other result than to disturb the birds in the
trees. Becoming alarmed at the possibility
of being lost and her strength failing, she
was on the point of trying to find her way
back, and gave one last call, when she was
electrified by hearing a* strange hoarse sound
apparently coming from some distance to
the left. It was little like a human voice;
yet it was not the cry of a bird, and Mary
hurried with uneven steps tow r ards it.
The ground rose steeply, leading up to
the ridge far to the left. But with the new
strength lent by excitement Mary was not
conscious of the slope. She came to a
number of straggling bushes edged by an
irregular circle of small trees. Here she
looked eagerly around her, peering through
the bushes and between the trunks of the
trees, listening for that strange cry to be
repeated.
There was no sound, but as her eyes
travelled over the circuit she noticed what
seemed to be a small landslip in the bank.
Following this downward, her glance dis-
covered a hole in the ground several feet
wide. Moved by a sudden impulse, and the
instinctive feeling that here was the explana-


tion of Tommy?s disappearance, she stumbled
forward, hardly conscious of her trembling
limbs. Throwing herself flat on the ground at
the edge of the hole, she gazed into the pit
beneath. It was some moments before her
eyes became used to the half-light; but then
she saw something white; she distinguished
it as part of an object huddled on the ground
immediately beneath the opening ; and she
knew that Tommy was found.
But an agonizing fear seized her. Was
Tommy dead ? She called down in a low
voice. There was no answer. She called
again and still again, her tones growing
louder as she became more alarmed. At
length, after what seemed an age of suspense,
her strained gaze noticed a slight movement
in the figure below, and a faint whisper came
up to her. ? Thank God 1 ? her heart cried
out, and she eagerly called to Tommy,
saying that she would soon be safe. But
Tommy made no reply ; she had relapsed
into unconsciousness.
Mary was at her wits? end what to do.
It was clear that Tommy was helpless. A
pang shot through Mary?s heart as she
remembered that the girl had been without
food for two days and two nights. The
hole was so deep that even if Tommy had
been conscious Mary could not have helped
her, at the utmost stretch of her arms, to
get out. Elizabeth was beyond hearing:


she might return to the orange grove:
what would she do if she found Mary miss-
ing ? Mary dared not leave the neighbour-
hood of the pit now that Tommy was found :
but she wanted to run after Elizabeth and
bring her to the spot.
While she was still undecided she heard
Elizabeth?s voice in the far distance. She
shouted in reply, though she still felt that
against the wind her voice could not be
heard. But in a few moments she was
gladdened to know from the growing loud-
ness of the shouts that Elizabeth was return-
ing. There was a chance that as she drew
nearer she would hear a shrill call, so Mary
every few moments formed a trumpet
with her hands, and let forth a prolonged
? Cooee ! ? Presently she knew by the tone
of Elizabeth?s call that her voice had been
heard ; but, so confusing are sounds amid
woods and thickets, it was a long time before
Elizabeth discovered where she was, and
came hurrying through the trees.
? Have you found her ? ? she asked
eagerly.
? She is down there,? replied Mary, point-
ing to the mouth of the pit. 44 Oh, Bess,
I?m afraid she is very much hurt, perhaps
dying!?
v Elizabeth, with an exclamation of dismay,
threw herself down and peered into the hole.
44 Tommy 1 Tommy dear I ? she called.


But there was no answer. Elizabeth
measured with her eye the depth of the pit;
she felt tempted to spring down and see if
Tommy were alive or dead.
? Will you stay here while I run back
and get the painter ? ? she asked. At that
moment neither of the girls thought of
savages: fear for Tommy had banished every
other fear.
? It wdll take so long,? murmured Mary.
?You would be gone an hour at least,
and ?
? I know a way,? Elizabeth interrupted;
? we?ll make a rope of creepers. It won?t
take us long.?
She darted off into the forest. In building
the hut she had become expert in selecting
strong tendrils for binding their lattice-work,
and in a few moments she had cut, among the
dense undergrowth, a considerable quantity
of tough material with which she hurried
back to the pit. The two girls at once
set to work with nimble fingers plaiting the
tendrils together.
? She must be famished, and dead with
thirst,? said Mary. ?If we could only give
her some water.?
? There?s a little brook not far away,? said
Elizabeth. ? When we have done the rope
we?ll make a cup of leaves, and I?ll fetch some
water. Then you must let me down into the
pit.?


? I could never do it,? said Mary. ?I am
not strong enough.?
? Not by yourself, but I?ll fasten one end
of the rope to that tree you see there; then
we?ll pass it round that little one near us,
and you will be strong enough to pay it
out. That?s the only way.?
They worked very quickly, and finished
a long, stout rope in little more time than
the journey home would have taken. While
Mary made several cups from the large
spreading leaves of a plant like rhubarb,
Elizabeth wound one end of the rope tightly
about the tree trunk she had pointed out.
In the other end she made a loop to cling to.
? The rope is not long enough,? said
Mary.
? Not to reach the bottom, but that doesn?t
matter. I can drop a few feet. When you
have let me down, run down that slope,
Mary, and you?ll find the brook a little way
to the right. Bring two of the leaves filled
with water, and let them down by the rope.
Pierce a hole in each side of the cups near
the top, and pass the rope through : you?ll
see how to do it. Now take the rope firmly.
I?ll slip over the edge, and when I give the
word let it run out gently around the tree.?
Pale with anxiety and weakness, Mary
took up her position at the tree. She made
a determined effort to obey Elizabeth?s
instructions. Inch by inch the rope slipped


through her hands, at last so fast that she
held her breath in terror lest Elizabeth should
be dashed to the ground. The rope was
stretched to its extreme tension; then it
suddenly relaxed ; and next moment she
heard the welcome cry from the pit: ? I?m
safe. Now for the water.?
Gathering herself together, Mary sped off
to the brook, carrying the two leaf cups.
Eagerness to help lent her strength. She
returned with them brimming, drew up the
rope, and unfastened the loop at the end.
Then passing two of the strands through the
holes made in the cup, she let it dowm slowiy
into the pit. Some of the w r ater was spilled
in the descent; but Elizabeth said that
enough w'as left for the moment.
? How is she ? ? asked Mary, dreading to
hear that Tommy w'as past help.
? She is unconscious, but breathing,? said
Elizabeth. ? I?ll give her some w r ater.?
For some little time Mary heard no more.
Elizabeth bathed Tommy?s head and mois-
tened her lips. At length the young girl gave
a long sigh and moan.
? I?m here, dear,? said Elizabeth gently.
? Mary is above. You are safe now.?
? The face ! ? moaned Tommy, her mind
leaping back over all that had happened since
she had seen those eyes staring at her.
?? Hush ! ? said Elizabeth, stroking her
head. ? There is nothing to harm you.


Drink a little water ; we must see^ about
getting you out of this pit, you know.
� Tommy drank eagerly, holding Elizabeth s
hands in a tight clasp.
?We are getting on famously, Elizabeth
called to reassure Mary.
Tommy lay still, taking a sip of water
every now and again, too weak to move or
to speak. Meanwhile Elizabeth was beating
her brain for some means of getting her to the
surface. It was clear that Tommy for some
time would be unable to do anything for
herself. Lightly built though she was her
dead weight was far more than Elizabeth
could hope to sustain, hanging on to the
rope, and with no one but Mary to assist
from above. The rope was too short by
several feet; the first necessity was to
lengthen it. Presently, therefore, when
Tommy was more recovered, Elizabeth asked
Mary to cut some more creepers and throw
them down. Now her practice in splicing
on board her uncle?s ship was very useful.
She quickly added three or four feet to the
rope?s length.
? Tommy dear, I?m going to leave you for
a little,? she said. ? You are quite safe now.
I?m going to arrange about lifting you out
of this horrid place. You must be hungry,
poor thing. I?ll get a few oranges; you can
reach them if we throw them down, can t you?
and bananas too ; they?re more substantial.


By the time I am ready to lift you out you?ll
be heaps stronger.?
? Mary won?t go ? ? said Tommy quiver-
ingly.
? No, she?ll stay with you. You can
hear her when she speaks to you : but don?t
try to talk yourself; just eat the fruit I shall
give you and get strong.?
She then told Mary to come to the edge
of the pit and be ready to help her.
? But take care you don?t overbalance,?
she said. ?It mustn?t be a case of three girls
in a pit.?
Tired as Elizabeth had been, the joy of
discovering Tommy alive had braced her,
and she felt equal to any exertion. But
she had not had Tommy?s practice in tree-
climbing, nor in clambering up the rigging
on the barque; and when she clasped the
rope and tried to draw herself up she slipped
down again and again. For a time she felt
baffled, but a means of overcoming the
difficulty occurred to her.
? Pull up the rope, Mary,? she said, ? and
make knots in it about two feet apart. I
shall be able to manage it then, I think.?
When the knots w r ere made she tried
again. It was a terrible strain on her wrists,
and she got no assistance for her feet from
the shelving sides of the pit. But the knots
gave a firm hold, and she managed to climb
hand over hand to the edge, where, with


Mary?s help, she heaved herself on to the
level ground.
? Do rest,? said Mary, noticing the signs
of strain on her sister?s face.
? I am not a bit tired. Look, Mary, I
want you to plait another rope. I?ll get the
stuff for you.?
She hastened into the undergrowth, and
returned with her arms full of creepers.
? Now I?m going to get Tommy some food,
and then run back to the hut. I?ll be as
quick as I can. Talk to her while I am
away to keep her spirits up.?
Soon she was flinging an armful of bananas
and oranges, one by one, into the pit.
? There?s a feast for you,? she said cheer-
fully. ? Now in about an hour you?ll be
released. Eat slowly, that?s the rule after
fasting, isn?t it ? ?
? You are a dear,? said Mary, hugging her.
? What should we have done without you ? ?
? My dear girl, without me you wouldn?t
have been here at all, we all came together.
Good-bve for an hour.?
She flitted off as lightly as a bird, over-
flowing with happiness. Reaching the hut
she took up the longest of the mat beds, her
own, and without waiting for a moment
to rest, hurried back to her sister, announcing
herself from a distance by a cheerful cooee.
? All well ? ? she said.
44 Tommy has been telling me all about it,


said Mary. ? She saw the little brown face
again.?
? Bother the little brown face I ? said
Elizabeth. ? Really, I should like to smack
it. Tommy?s well enough to talk, is she ? ?
? Yes, but she has sprained her ankle.?
? Poor girl I it will be hoppety-hop when
we get her up, then. Now see how w'e?ll
manage it. You?ve finished that rope ?
We?ll make a cradle of my bed.?
She made two holes at each end of the
mat large enough for the ropes to pass
through. In this way she formed a rough
cradle upon which Tommy could be drawn
up, for the girl?s weight would keep it
steady if the ropes were placed far enough
apart. The cradle was soon ready for lower-
ing.
? Can you manage to get on to it yourself,
Tommy ? ? asked Elizabeth, ?or shall I
come down again and help you ? ?
? I can manage,? answered Tommy. ? I
am ever so much better. Are you sure it?s
strong enough ? ?
? Certain, I?d trust myself on it. All you
will have to do will be to clutch a rope at
each end and hold tight. Call out when you
are ready.?
She and Mary then each took the end of a
rope and passed it round a tree, the two trees
being not quite so far apart as the length
of the mat. Tommy gave the word. They


began to haul. The trees relieved them of
all strain, and making a succession of short
pulls, with rests in between, they drew the
cradle inch by inch to the surface. Elizabeth
was afraid that Mary?s strength might give
way, or that Tommy would lose her grip
of the ropes ; but neither of these mishaps
occurred, and with a final pull they hauled
Tommy and cradle over the brink of the pit.
And then overwrought nerves gave way.
Elizabeth ran to Tommy, clasped her in her
arms, and burst into tears. A little later,
when all three girls were sitting together
weeping in sympathy, Elizabeth exclaimed ?
? Well, we are a lot of babies. We ought
to be shouting for joy. I?m quite ashamed
of myself.?
? I?m not,? said Mary stoutly. ? I think
it?s a blessing we can cry a little. It eases
the nerves. Boys never cry, and what?s
the result ? They get as crabby as two
sticks.?
? How am I to get you two poor invalids
home ? ? said Elizabeth. ? You have done
wonders, Mary, but you would be utterly
done up if you tried to walk back. And
Tommy certainly can?t walk. We shall have
to stay here for the night; fortunately, it is
fine.?
? Oh, no, we must get home, Bess,? said
Tommy earnestly. ? I could not bear to
stay here after seeing that face.?

? But there can?t be anything to harm us,?
persisted Elizabeth. ? I have walked round
and round, miles altogether, and haven t
seen a single sign of people. You are
quite sure it was a human face Haj nt
it have been a monkey or an owl ? ?
? No, I am sure of it. You never saw
such eyes, they seemed to burn like fire.
? But didn?t you see a body, too ? ?
? No, just a face. That was what fright-
ened me soj just a face that seemed all
eyes ? 5 5
J Elizabeth saw that Tommy had been too
much scared to take real notice of anything,
and decided that for the sake of her peace of
mind it would be better to make an attempt
to reach home.
? Very then, it?s a case of pick-a-back.
I?ll carry you. Mary must get along as well
as she can. It will take us an age, but we
can rest on the way.?
They started, Mary carrying Elizabeth?s
mat, and Elizabeth carrying Tommy. Slowly
and with many halts they made their way
down, reaching the hut about their usual
tea-time. The two elder girls had taken
precautions to fill their pockets with fruit
as they skirted the orange grove. They
had no other fruit in the hut except cocoa-
nuts, and Elizabeth was too worn out to
think of catching fish. They satisfied them-
selves with a meal of fruit.


Tommy was delighted with the behaviour
of her parrot, Billy. Overjoyed at the return
of its mistress, it hopped upon her shoulder,
cocking its head and uttering cries loud but
by no means sweet.
? A welcome home, Tommy,? said Eliza-
beth, smiling. ?We can?t gush, Mary and
I, but we are more glad than we can say,
dear, and Billy says it for us as well as he
can.?
Then, after Tommy?s ankle had been
bathed and bound up, they threw themselves
on their simple couches, and, all their present
anxieties set at rest, slept heavily until the
sun woke them to another day.


CHAPTER XVI
NEW TERRORS
A few days? rest, and a steady improve-
ment in the weather, restored the invalids
to their former health. The daily round
went on as before ?fishing, gathering fruit,
ascending the cliff to take their customary
look over the sea. They often talked of the
face Tommy had seen. It was more mysteri-
ous than ever. Elizabeth, while her sisters
were still confined to the hut, made a visit
by herself to the orange grove, and deter-
mined if she saw the face to discover once
for all to whom it belonged. But thougn
she looked in every tree and bush and scoured
the neighbourhood thoroughly, she never
once caught sight of the face with the two
burning eyes. Once she heard a rustling
amongst the bushes and dashed towards
the sound, but there was nothing to be seen,
and she returned thoroughly baffled.
One morning when Elizabeth was pre-
paring breakfast she heard Mary, who had
gone to the look-out, shouting in great ex-
citement. The two other girls rushed to


join her, and saw far away in the offing a
three-masted ship under full sail. The
breeze was light, and the vessel appeared
to be moving very slowly. Mary had al-
ready waved her handkerchief : the others
did the same, but they soon realized that
the ship was too far away for their signals
to be noticed.
? Let?s go after her in the boat,? sug-
gested Tommy. ? They might see that
moving on the water.?
As there seemed just a possibility of thus
attracting attention, they ran down to the
beach and launched the boat. Elizabeth,
being the strongest, took the sculls and pulled
as hard as she could towards the opening
in the reef ; while Tommy steered, and Mary
from time to time rose in her place and
waved her handkerchief. By the time they
came into the open sea the ship was almost
opposite to them, sailing due w r est. There
was no sign that they had been observed; she
held steadily to her course. They shouted;
Tommy put her fingers to her lips and gave
a shrill whistle, an accomplishment which
some of her friends at home had condemned
as unladylike. But the ship stood on her
way. The girls? hearts sank as they saw
the distance between it and them gradually
widen; and Elizabeth, who had been pulling
gallantly for half-an-hour or more, at last
collapsed on her oars.


They were all too much upset to speak.
To have seen a vessel at last, after so many
weeks of waiting, and then to be passed
by, was a terrible disappointment to them.
They were distressed not merely at the loss
of the chance of immediate rescue, but at
the staggering thought that the same thing
might happen again. It was evident that
the island lay out of the usual track; no vessel
could ever have a reason for visiting it; and
lacking the power of making effective signals
they might remain there for years and years
without any one ever being aware of their
existence.
The light boat rocked to the long
Pacific swell, and the girls battled with
their tears. They strained their eyes after
the dwindling vessel, hoping against hope
that even yet she might change her course
and come back to them. But wdien there
was nothing but a speck on the horizon,
Elizabeth, her face full of despair, took up
the sculls again and began to pull slowly
in silence towards home.
As the boat?s head turned they were aghast
to find how far distant they were from the
island. The high cliffs seemed little more
than a low bank : clearly they were miles
away. Elizabeth, knowing that her sculling
powers could not wholly account for the
great distance, suddenly remembered the
current. From the time the boat passed


the reef it had been subject to the full strength
of the ocean stream that swept the shore.
They would have to row back against it,
and with the sun mounting higher, and no
food or water on board, they realized that
they must look forward to hours of dis-
comfort, if not actual danger.
The boat made little headway against the
current, and Elizabeth had worked so hard
that now she was scarcely able to move the
sculls.
? Tommy, can you take my place for a
little while ? ? she said. ? I will row again
after a rest.?
They exchanged places, stooping low and
moving very carefully. The boat lost many
yards while the exchange was being made.
Tommy had quite recovered her strength,
and was able to take a long spell at the sculls.
But progress was very slow. Elizabeth
steered with the idea of getting under the
shelter of the island. She noticed by and by
that Tommy was tiring, and proposed to take
the sculls again; but Mary pleaded to be
allowed to share in the work. Thus relieving
one another, they crept gradually towards
the island, not daring to cease sculling
altogether, and yet finding it more and more
exhausting as the day grew hotter.
By almost imperceptible degrees the cliffs
heightened and objects upon them became
more distinct. The girl who was steering


at the time encouraged the sculler by men-
tioning each new landmark as it became
distinguishable. Recognizing that it would
be hours before they could attain their own
little harbour, Elizabeth decided to make
for the nearest point of the shore in the
hope of finding another landing-place. At
last they began to benefit by the shelter
of the island, and their progress became more
rapid. But when, after exertions that had
tried them all severely, they came out of
the current into comparatively still water
near the shore, they had to row for some
distance before, in a cutting between the
cliffs, they discovered a broad, sandy beach
on which it was possible to land. Here they
pulled the boat a few yards up the sand,
and then hurried along the chine in search
of fresh water to assuage their burning
thirst.
Within a short distance of the beach the
chine was covered with vegetation, among
which they saw several cocoa-nut palms.
To these they hastened in the hope of find-
ing some nuts upon the ground. But there
were none. Tommy looked longingly up into
the trees, but it was impossible to climb
them, and the girls hurried on again, expect-
ing to find somewhere a rill trickling from
the high ground to the sea.
When they had gone some distance the
trees thinned, and they saw, some hundreds


of yards in front of them, a sheer wall of
rock, rising to a considerable height and
dotted here and there with scrub.
? Do you know, I believe that?s the end
of the ridge,? said Elizabeth, who had a
shrewder eye than the others for country,
and had a better notion as to the part of
the island to which they had come.
? I don?t care,? cried Tommy ; ? that's
what I want.? She pointed to a sparkling
waterfall that plunged over a ledge a good
way to their left. They ran eagerly to-
wards it, scrambling over impediments, and
soon came to the stream which the water-
fall fed. Then they threw themselves down,
and gulped large draughts of the cold water.
After resting for a while on the grassy bank,
Elizabeth looked at her watch.
?It is past two,? she said; ? what a time
we have been ! ?
? Without breakfast or dinner, ? said
Tommy dolefully, ? and no chance of supper
either, as far as I can see, if we have to
row back.?
? Perhaps we had better walk it,? sug-
gested Elizabeth ; ? I?ve had enough rowing
for one day.?
? Can we find the way ? ? asked Mary.
?If we are near the end of the ridge, as
I think we are,? replied Elizabeth, ? we can?t
go far wrong. It takes us half-an-hour or
more from the ridge home, and I shouldn?t


think it would take us long to reach a place
that we recognize.?
?You mean the orange grove, said
Tommy; ? I won?t go past it, I absolutely
won?t.? ,
? Well, dear, I dare say we can go round
about,? said Elizabeth placably, ?though
I?m so tired and hungry, and I am sure you
are too, that the shorter our walk the better.
Let us rest a little longer until it?s not quite
so hot. But we mustn?t stay too long, in
case I am mistaken and we find ourselves
lost in the dark.?
About half-an-hour later they rose to make
their way homeward. Elizabeth had re-
solved to follow up the stream until they
reached the waterfall, then to strike to the
left, skirting the precipice. She expected to
come to the thick belt of woodland of which
the orange grove was a part. Tommy did
not go ahead as her custom was. Since her
fright she had been a more sedate and sober
Tommy.
They had gone but a short distance up-
stream through a fringe of trees, when all
at once they halted and started back. The
trees suddenly came to an end, and a few
vards in front of them stood a tiny structure,
which, ignorant as they were, they knew for
a native hut. It was conical in shape,
made apparently of grass and thatch, with
a small opening only high enough to crawl


through. It was placed at the foot of a slope,
and the space before it had evidently been
cleared by hand, for there were stumps of
trees here and there.
The three girls, struck with consternation,
slipped back within the shelter of the trees.
Tommy clung to Elizabeth?s hand. Here
was confirmation of her story. It said much
for her restraint, or perhaps for the renewal
of her fears, that she did not turn upon
Mary with a whispered ? I told you so.?
Elizabeth had determined if she should
see a native to show a bold front and try
to make friends with him. Now, though
Tommy on one side and Mary on the other
were pulling her back, she stood her ground,
whispering, ? Wait: perhaps it is deserted.?
But she had scarcely uttered the words when,
from among the trees on the other side of
the stream, about two hundred yards away,
they caught sight of a native approaching.
They were only aware that it was the figure
of a man : all Elizabeth?s bold resolutions
evaporated. Without waiting to take in
any details of the stranger?s appearance they
fled noiselessly among the trees, swerving
to the left of the course they had intended
to follow.
They ran until they were out of breath,
glancing round fearfully every now and
again. Had they been seen ? Would the
savage pursue them ? There was no sign


of pursuit, and when breathlessness forced
them to walk, they stepped out quickly, not
daring to speak.
They were in a part of the island utterly
unfamiliar to them. Elizabeth had quite
lost her bearings. The vegetation was very
thick; even where it was not actual forest
there were bushes in clumps, large tangled
masses of creepers, and briers which, as they
forced their way through, tore their clothes
and scratched their hands and faces. They
stumbled over obstacles at almost every step.
Here and there the ground rose steeply,
and the haste of their ascent made them
pant for breath.
After a time Elizabeth, always quickest
to recover her self-possession, began to
reproach herself for giving way so easily to
panic.
? What an idiot I was 1 ? she said in a
whisper. ? The idea of running from a
solitary creature I ?
? But he was a cannibal I ? said Mary.
? How do we know that ? Was he the
owner of your little brown face, Tommy ? ?
? Yes ?no ?l don?t know,? murmured
Tommy. ? I don?t think so.?
? I ought to have waited,? continued
Elizabeth. ?We might at least have seen
whether he was young or old. Why, for all
we know he is a white man, cast away like
ourselves.?


? He had no coat on, I saw that,? said
Mary.
?He may be a native hermit, then. There
are such people among the savages, I
suppose.?
? But there may be hundreds, said
Tommy.
? Living in one little hut ? Nonsense 1
? There may be other huts, we can?t tell,?
said Mary. ? The savage may have been
coming from one of the others.?
? That?s true I It is more likely that the
man has companions, I admit. Well, if
I can?t pluck up courage to go among them,
we must simply take care to keep on our
side of the island, and that means starvation
in time. But where are we ? The sun is
getting low : it will be dark soon. Let us
run again.?
They found themselves soon entering
another patch of forest, and began to be
seriously alarmed at the prospect of being
overtaken by night before they reached
home.
Elizabeth thought it best to keep straight
on, for by so doing they must come in time
to?the shore. But it is difficult to judge
direction in the forest, and when darkness
descended upon them while they were still
among the trees, Elizabeth was forced to
the conclusion that they had been wandering
round and round all the time.


? It?s of no use, girls,? she said; we can
never find our way in the dark. We shal
have to stay here for the night.
They had been without food all day.
Utterly worn out by hunger, exertion and
alarm, they huddled together at the foot o
a tree and fell into an uneasy sleep. Several
times during the night they were disturbed
bv slight noises in the brushwood aroimd
them, or in the trees overhead. But nothing
happened to alarm them, and when dawn
glimmered through the trees they rose, a
haggard and sorry trio, and set off once
more to find a way home. , ,
Only a few minutes? walk uphill brought
them to the ridge, from which they could see
the orange grove. They were so desperately
hungry and thirsty that they were ready to
face all hazards for the sake of some fruit.
They hurried to the grove, snatched up a
few oranges and bananas, and devoured
them as they continued on their homeward
way. , , . , v
When they reached their hut, their feeling
of security was alloyed by the distressing
thought that they had lost their boat. The
savages, whose settlement was near the co\ e
at which they had landed, and who probably
appropriated the fruits of the cocoa-nut
palms there, would certainly discover the
boat drawn up on the beach. The girls had
always regarded it as a last refuge; they


could always use it to row out to any ship
that came reasonably near, if they failed to
attract the attention of those on board in
any other way. They felt that its dis-
appearance very likely doomed them to a
lifelong imprisonment on the island, and
their hearts were heavy as lead. Not being
without imagination, they had often in their
secret thoughts looked into the future, and
seen themselves growing older, falling ill,
one or the other of them dying; and the
possibility of being the last survivor, shut
up in this ocean prison-house without
human companionship, filled each of them
with terror.
With the morning common-sense asserted
itself.
? We shall be perfect ninnies if we don?t
try to get back our boat,? said Elizabeth.
? I?ve been thinking a good deal in the
night, and the more I think the more con-
vinced I am that there can?t be many natives
on the island. Why should they keep to
themselves so ? Why don?t they ever come
to this part ? If only I could cease being
a coward for five minutes I?d brave them.
Anyhow we ought to back to the place
we landed at yesterday and bring our boat
away. It mavn?t have been discovered
yet.?
? But suppose it has been discovered ? ?
said Mary.


? They?d probably leave it on the shore.
If we walk over there this evening and get
there about dark, we might steal it away.
It?s our own property.?
? I don?t want to go near the place,? said
Tommy. ? Besides, we might lose our way.?
? Not if we walk over the cliffs,? replied
Elizabeth. ?We have never tried that.
The woods are thick, but we might find the
walk easier than we think. At any rate, it
would be shorter than going all round by
the ridge. You see, Tommy, we need not
go near the hut at all. Don?t come if you
feel nervous. Mary and I can row the
boat back.?
? No, I won?t be left. If you go Igo too.
If we don?t see the boat where we left it,
you won?t go any farther, will you ? ?
? I won?t if it is notin sight,? said Eliza-
beth, ? but if it is anywhere within reach it
would be silly not to try to get it. We
want some fish badly. Let?s go fishing
this morning, and rest all the afternoon, so
as to be fresh for our walk.?
So it was arranged, but the plan had to
be modified. While Tommy and Mary were
fishing from the rocks, it occurred to Eliza-
beth to climb to the cliff top and see if the
way she suggested was practicable. She was
disappointed. Not only was the forest
dense, and the undergrowth an almost im-
penetrable mass of thorny thicket, but the


ground was much broken by fissures and
small crevasses, so that, instead of being
easier than the route across the island,
this w T ay promised to be longer and much
more troublesome.
When she returned to her sisters she found
them cheerful over a finer catch than usual.
Taking advantage of their high spirits she
told them the result of her expedition, and
employed all her persuasiveness to induce
them to attempt the route by the ridge.
She overcame Tommy?s reluctance, and
then tactfully dropped the subject, hoping
that the young girl?s courage would not
ooze away before it was time to start.
About four o?clock, after making a good
meal, they set off, Tommy exacting a promise
that Elizabeth would turn back at the least
sign of danger. They walked quickly until
they had crossed the ridge; then, avoiding
the orange grove, they struck off more
directly to the east, moving more slowly, and
with many a cautious glance around.
? We ought to come above the waterfall
by and by,? said Elizabeth in a whisper.
Her sense of locality had not deceived her.
In a few minutes they heard the musical
plashing of the water. Keeping this sound
on their right, they went on, guessing that
the native hut must be at some distance
below them, nearer the sea. As they went
on, in silence, they came suddenly to what


appeared to be the opening of a large cave
in the face of the cliff. They shrank back,
wondering if this was a dwelling of some
of the inhabitants; but taking courage from
the perfect stillness they ventured to pass
the opening and continued their descent
towards the sea.
Presently, round a bend of the cliff, they
saw the native hut, nestling at the foot of
the rocky precipice, two or three hundred
yards away. The sun was very near its
setting, and its last rays being intercepted
by the high ground in the centre of the
island, the light was already dim at the
point at which they had arrived. To gain
the cove they would have to descend a little
lower and then cross through a clump of
trees. As they approached this, Tommy,
whose keen eyes were restlessly searching
the neighbourhood, declared that she had
caught sight of a small figure flitting among
the trees beyond the hut. They all halted
and gazed anxiously towards the spot she
pointed out ; but no form, human or other-
wise, was now to be seen. There was the
hut just as they had seen it before, but no
person was visible, nor even the smoke of
a fire.
Fearing that it would be quite dark before
they reached the cove they hurried on.
The remaining distance was greater than
Elizabeth had supposed, and the clump of


trees more extensive. As they passed through
this, the hut now being hidden from sight,
they were more circumspect than ever. At
last they reached the end of it, and halting
for another look round, they hastened on
towards the sandy beach where they had
left the boat.
It was not many minutes before they saw,
with a pang of disappointment, that the
boat was certainly not w r here it had been.
? Let?s go back,? whispered Tommy; ? you
know you promised.?
? But there is no danger yet, child,?
replied Elizabeth somewhat impatiently.
? We might at least see if it is anywhere
about.?
She went on in advance of the others,
and almost shouted for joy when she caught
sight of the boat drawn up in a snug little
recess. She beckoned the girls to join her,
and as they came up, pointed with some
excitement to a small native canoe that
lay a few feet beyond their own boat.
Tommy gave a startled gasp.
? There are savages,? she whispered; ? oh,
do let us go. I know we shall be caught.?
?We won?t go without the boat,? said
Elizabeth fiercely. ? Quick I It?s bound to
make a scraping sound as w#> drag it down;
but it?s very near the water, and before
any one can reach us from the hut we shall
be afloat.?


With nervous energy they drew the boat
down to the water, sprang into it, and, in a
state of fearful joy, Elizabeth began to pull
from the shore.
? Steer close in, Tommy,? she said, ? or
we shall be in the current. There?s only
half-an-hour of daylight left, but if I pull
hard we shall be home almost as soon as it
is dark. Mind the rocks.?
Mary, the only unoccupied member of the
party, kept her eyes fixed on the shore.
? I see some one,? she called suddenly;
? there, just by those cocoa-nuts.?
Tommy turned quickly. In the gathering
dusk she was unable at first to see the object
to which Mary pointed ; but presently she
distinguished, peeping round the stem of a
palm not fifty yards away, a little brown
face surmounted by a mop of very black
hair.
? There it is,? she cried, ? the same that
I saw before. Pull hard, Bess; they?ll be
after us in their canoe.?
Elizabeth suspected that the native craft
would be much speedier than their own
little tub, and, fearful of pursuit, plied her
sculls lustily. As the boat drew away, the
head moved; a shoulder appeared; then a
complete body, which came slowly down to
the edge of the shore.
** I believe it?s a girl 1 ? exclaimed Mary.
But in the fading light it was impossible


to see distinctly, and they had no temptation
to delay, even though Mary s exclamation
had aroused their curiosity. The figure was
soon completely out of sight. Tommy had
to keep all her attention fixed on the task of
steering, for they had never rowed along this
part of the shore, which was much broken
by projecting rocks.
?Are you sure it was not the man we saw
before ? ? asked Elizabeth.
?I don?t think it was, said Mary. It
seemed smaller. I wonder if it teas a girl .
? We are making surprising discoveries,
said Elizabeth. ?No one is chasing us, at
any rate. Can we have been scared all this
time by a girl ? ? ,
Tommy said nothing. The figure had
appeared to be about her own height. TV as
it possible that the little brown face which
had so much frightened her, and which she
had seen with horror in her dreams, be-
longed to a young girl like herself ? ohe
felt a strange longing to know.


CHAPTER XVH
THE FOUNDLING
The improvement in the weather was only
temporary, and for several days the girls
were kept at home by the heavy rains. They
talked a good deal about their discovery.
There appeared to be at least two natives
on the island; how many more they were
unable to guess. Having themselves been
seen, they felt that they could no longer owe
their safety to the ignorance of the inhabi-
tants ; but the bad weather might discourage
any attempt to seek them out. Whether
they would escape attack when the rain
ceased was a problem that caused much
anxiety.
Early one morning a hurricane swept over
the island, not so devastating as its pre-
decessor, but violent enough to make them
fear for the safety of their hut. This time,
however, the wind blew from a different
quarter, and the girls? frail dwelling, being
sheltered by the high ground behind, escaped
damage. The storm lasted a few hours, and


was then succeeded by a day of brilliant
sunshine. The girls took advantage of this
to replenish their larder. While Tommy and
Elizabeth were fishing, Mary posted herself
as sentry to give the alarm if the natives
appeared. They feared that the precau-
tion would avail them little if they were
really attacked, for they had no means of
defence; but it might at least give them
time to escape for the moment by launching
the boat. They were undisturbed, however;
and when the day closed they rejoiced in
one more respite.
Next morning Tommy, on going down
to the beach, was surprised to see a canoe,
apparently empty, drifting past the reef.
It flashed upon her that this might be the
canoe they had seen up the coast, and that
it had been washed away, like their own
boat, by the recent storm.
She ran up to the hut to tell her sisters
what she had seen, and all three hurried
down to the shore.
? Let?s row out and catch it,? cried Tommy
excitedly. ? I should love to learn to paddle
a native canoe, and I dare say in time we
could make it go along faster than our own
dinghy.?
? You want to capture an enemy?s ship,?
said Elizabeth, with a smile. ? I don?t see
any reason why we shouldn?t. But we?ll
take some food and water this time. After


our last adventure I don?t care about
voyaging without provisions.?
Tommy ran back to the hut for some
fruit and cold fish, while Mary filled their
water-pots at the stream. Having placed
them in the boat they rowed out towards
the reef. By the time they were afloat the
canoe had drifted out into the main current,
and was being carried rapidly The
sea was calm, and Elizabeth?s vigorous
strokes brought the boat in twenty minutes
or so within a few yards of the canoe.
Suddenly Mary, who had been keeping a
look-out in the boat, uttered a startled
exclamation.
? Bess, I believe there?s some one lying
in it. J 6
Elizabeth at once lay on her oars.
? Row back I ? whispered Tommy ? It?s
one of the savages. He?s hiding to decoy
us, or something,?
Elizabeth?s common-sense asserted itself,
lhat s not likely,? she said. ? How*
would he suppose that we should row out ?
ar ? cou idn?t got aw r av now if we tried
if he has a paddle. If he hasn?t he can?t do
us much harm. Now?s the best chance we
have of making friends.?
Don t, Bess ! ? whispered Tommy anxi-
ously, as Elizabeth dipped the'' oars
again.
But Elizabeth was firm, and with a fe?


strokes brought the boat alongside the canoe.
Not a sound had come from it.
? It?s a girl I ? exclaimed Mary, now that
she could see more clearly the bottom of the
Tommy gave a gasp. Was she to behold
the owner of the little brown face at last ?
Elizabeth no longer hesitated. She drew
close to the canoe, shipped oars, and laid a
hand on the side.
The girls looked down with a sort ot
awed curiosity. In the bottom ol the boat
lay a native girl ?a brown-skinned pretty
little creature, with a string of what looked
like teeth around her neck, and a yellow
kerchief about her waist. She was per-
fectly still; her eyes were closed.
? She?s dead I? whispered Tommy, whose
eyes were dilated with excitement.
Elizabeth leant over and placed her hand
under the child?s breast.
? No, she is alive,? she said, but her
heart is beating very faintly. Some water,
Mary?quick 1 ?
It was impossible, placed as she was,, to
pour any water into the girl?s mouth; but
Elizabeth sprinkled a little on her head.
After a time the girl stirred, opened her eyes
and moved her lips, but no sound came from
them, and in a moment her eyelids again
44 She?s absolutely done,? said Elizabeth.


? We?ll tow the canoe home. Tommy,
fasten the painter. The poor child?s very
bad.?
The boat?s head was turned, and Elizabeth
rowed as hard as she could against the cur-
rent. Fortunately, they had not come very
far beyond the gap in the reef. When the
boat reached the still water it travelled
much faster, and -within an hour of leaving
they regained the shore. During this time
Tommy had thrown an occasional glance
over her shoulder at the prostrate girl.
Once she caught the child?s eyes fixed upon
her, and felt a thrill as she recognized them;
they were the same as she had seen peering
at her out of the bush. She felt no fear
now, but a longing to help the little stranger
and know more about her.
When they had landed and drawn the
boat up, they lifted the girl and carried her
among them to the hut. Her eyes opened
during the journey, and she shivered; but
she did not speak or struggle, and indeed
hung so limply in their arms that they
feared she was past help.
? On my bed, please,? said Tommy, when
thev reached the hut.
They laid her gently down, and Elizabeth
poured a little cocoa-nut milk between her
lips. She now gave signs of animation,
swallowed the juice greedily, and looked
with the eyes of a timid fawn from one to


another of the three girls. Presently she
murmured a few words; her voice was
plaintive and pleading.
? Don?t be frightened,? said Elizabeth
soothingly.
The words seemed to startle the child.
She tried to rise, but was too weak to move.
? She must have been adrift a long time
to be in this terrible state,? said Elizabeth.
? I wonder how it happened ? ?
? Poor thing,? murmured Tommy.
? What a sweet little face she has I ?
? Hush ! ? said Elizabeth, ? our voices
frighten her. Of course she doesn?t under-
stand what we say. I think you had better
leave her to me for a little while. I?ll feed
her, and she?ll see by and by that we mean
her no harm.?
Tommy?s face wore for an instant a look
of defiance, but she got the better of her
inclination to rebel, and with Mary left the
hut. Elizabeth remained with the little
stranger, feeding her at frequent intervals,
bathing her head, occasionally murmuring
a word of encouragement. Her gentleness
was effective. Presently the look of fright
vanished from the brown girl?s eyes ?large,
liquid eyes that Elizabeth found wonder-
fully attractive. Once she timidly stroked
Elizabeth?s strong firm hand, and at last,
with a faint smile, she dropped off to sleep.
? She?s asleep,? said Elizabeth, quietly


going forth to join her sisters. ? What an
extraordinary thing to happen I ?
? Look here, Bess,? said Tommy fiercely,
? if you think you?re going to keep her to
yourself you are jolly well mistaken. I saw
her first; you wouldn?t believe me; and now
I?m going to look after her, so there ! ?
? Instead of the parrot ? ? Mary could
not help saying.
Elizabeth frowned at her.
? Very well, dear,? she said pleasantly.
? She?s a little younger than you, I should
think, but I dare say she will like you to
mother her. But what will happen ? Won?t
her friends come and look for her ? ?
? And if they do, and find we have treated
her kindly, they?ll just love us,? said Tommy.
The other girls were amazed at Tommy?s
complete change of attitude. Her fearful-
ness seemed to have been quite swallowed
up in another emotion. The discovery that
the native of whom she had been so need-
lessly frightened was a girl more helpless
than herself filled her with a kind of rap-
ture. She stepped softly into the hut, and
seeing that the child was still asleep, placed
a peeled orange beside her mat, where it
must be seen as soon as she awoke.
? I wonder if we ought to go to the native
hut and try to explain to her people that
the girl is safe,? said Elizabeth, as they sat
on the grass eating their dinner.


? Certainly not,? said Tommy decisively.
? I dare say they were cruel to her, and the
poor thing was glad to get away.?
? What an imagination you have 1 ? said
Elizabeth, smiling. ? For all you know, her
mother may be broken-hearted.?
? I don?t believe it. Anyhow, she?s too
weak to go home, and we shall soon see if
she wants to. I?ll talk to her by and by,
and I know she?ll be quite pleased to stay
with us.?
Remembering Tommy?s ill-success with
the parrot, the elder girls were amused at
her confident belief that she would make
the child talk, and understand what she
said. Indeed, when, later in the day, the
girl awoke, and Tommy went to attend to her,
the first attempt at opening communications
was a complete failure. By way of putting
the little patient at her ease, Tommy grinned
at her, patted her head, nodded, pointed
to herself and said ?Me Tommy,? with
the result that the child shrank away from
her as if scared. When she realized that
she had nothing to fear, she gazed upon the
white girl with wide-open eyes and the same
wondering look as may be seen on the face
of a child watching a conjurer.
The ravenous way in which she ate the
food given to her confirmed the girls? belief
that she was half-starved. She rapidly
gained strength, and it became clear that


her weakness was due to hunger and not
to illness. She began to talk, pouring out
her words in liquid tones that fell pleasantly
on the English ears. When she saw how
puzzled the girls were she laughed ; then,
with a sober look of reflection, pointed to
herself and said ? Me Tommee ? so drolly
that the girls screamed with laughter.
Just before sunset, when the girls came
into the hut for the night, they sat eating
their supper and talking about their dusky
guest. She knew by instinct that she was
the subject of their conversation, and looked
timidly from one to another, watching their
lips, her features reflecting every expression
on their faces.
Tommy gave her some baked'fish for
supper, and then prepared to ? tuck her up,?
as she said, with her own wraps; but the girl
rejected the covering and coiled herself up
like a dog.
Next morning she got up and followed
them when they went down to the shore for
their usual bath. She seemed to be astonished
at the whiteness of their skin, and amused
them very much by scrubbing herself with
sand, to see if she could make her brown
body resemble theirs. She watched every
detail of their toilet with intense interest,
and when she saw them comb their hair she
held out her hand for the comb.
? Don?t give it to her, Tommy,? said


Mary, looking with distaste at the girl?s
greasy mop.
? Rubbish ! ? said Tommy. ?We can
wash it afterwards.?
But even Tommy regretted her gener-
osity when, after being vigorously tugged
through the thick matted hair, the comb
was restored to her with several of its teeth
missing.
?My word 1 ? she exclaimed. ? Fancy
breaking wooden teeth 1 My poor old pony?s
mane was nothing to her thatch.?
After breakfast the girl followed them
about like a dog. They noticed that she
looked about her eagerly, as though search-
ing for some recognizable landmark. But
she evinced no desire to leave them, and
indeed soon became tired; her strength was
not yet equal to much exertion. The girls
all sat on the grass with the child in the
midst.
? Let?s try to find out her name,? sug-
gested Mary.
? Let me try,? said Tommy. Pointing to
Elizabeth, she said ? Bess,? repeating the
name several times. Then she touched Mary,
pronouncing her name, and lastly herself.
? Me Tommee,? said the girl, laughing
delightedly.
? Tommy,? said her instructor, ? not ? me,?
just Tommy.?
?Me Tommee,? repeated the girl; then


after a moment pointed to Mary, saying
? Mailee,? and to Elizabeth, calling her
? Bess,? with a long sibilant.
? Now you,? said Tommy, pointing to
the girl herself.
She at once recognized what was required
and said, ? Fangati.?
? What a pretty name I ? said Elizabeth.
? I wonder how she spells it,? remarked
Mary.
At this Tommy shrieked.
? She doesn?t spell at all, you goose ! ?
she said; ? of course she never learnt her
letters.?
And then the laugh was on Mary?s side,
for Fangati, as if thoroughly enjoying the
fun, touched Tommy?s hand, saying ?Me
Tommee,? over and over again.
? You?ll be ? Me Tommee ? always now,?
said Elizabeth. ?You should have used
correct English, my dear.?
? I don?t care,? said Tommy philosophic-
ally. ? Anyhow, she can?t say Mary. Try
again, Fangati,? she added, pointing to her
sister.
? Mailee,? cried the child, shoving her
teeth in a pretty smile. ? Bess, Mailee,
Me Tommee.?
To make quite sure that they had her
name correctly, Tommy walked to a little
distance until she was out of sight among
the trees, and then called ? Fangati ! ? in


her shrill treble. The girl instantly jumped
to her feet, and ran after her.
? Well done,? said Tommy, patting her.
? You are a perfect dear, and I?m going to
be very fond of you.?


CHAPTER XVIII
ANOTHER BROWN FACE
The girls were much surprised that Fan-
gati seemed perfectly content to remain
with them, and showed no disposition to
return to her friends. At first they put
this down to lack of strength, thinking that
the child had the prudence not to attempt
to cross the island until there was no risk of
breaking down. But in a few days, when
Fangati was as vigorous and lively as a
healthy young animal, this explanation was
no longer tenable.
They were almost equally surprised that,
so far as they could tell, no search had been
made for her. For some days they kept
pretty close to the neighbourhood of the
hut, in some fear that their possession of
Fangati might turn to their disadvantage
if the natives discovered her. To be sus-
pected of kidnapping her might bring down
upon them the wrath of her friends. But
when everything went on as before, they
lost their timidity, and made longer and
longer excursions from the hut.


Fangati accompanied them everywhere.
They had taught her a few words, and could
make her understand by signs or otherwise
what they wanted her to do. Their life was
so simple that there were few ways in which
she could help them. She laughed when
she saw their manner of fishing, but did not
offer to show them the native method.
She was content with things as they
were.
One day when she had gone with them
into the woodland to fetch food, she gathered
a number of large yellowish-green fruits
which they girls had often looked at long-
ingly but which they had never ventured
to eat for fear of poison. She handed the
fruit to them, and made signs to them to
eat. Seeing their hesitation, she dug her
strong teeth into the hard rind, quickly
pulled it off, and shoving the juicy pulp,
bright yellow in colour, began to suck it
with enjoyment. At this the girls followed
her example.
? It is delicious,? cried Tommy, the juice
dripping from her lips. ?What donkeys
we were not to try it before ! The bother
is, there isn?t enough of it; there?s a mon-
strous big stone in the middle. I wonder
what it is ? ?
The fruit was the mango, which they had
known hitherto only in the bottles of chutney
which their uncle had brought from India.


Their pleasure at the discovery of a new
fruit impelled Fangati to make further
additions to their menu. As they passed
through the woodland on their way home,
she stopped among some creepers trailing
along the ground, seized a stick, and began
to dig with it. The girls watched her
curiously. After a little she turned up
some tubers that looked something like
potatoes, and lifted them, chattering in-
comprehensibly, and pointing to her mouth.
? I believe they are yams,? said Mary;
? they are very good to eat.?
? Then we?li boil some for dinner,? said
Elizabeth. ? What a useful little thing
Fangati is turning out I ?
They took home a few of the roots, and
came back in the afternoon with the boat-
hook, with which, however, they dug up
the roots no faster than Fangati with the
stick.
Another day, when they went for cocoa-
nuts and failed to find any on the ground,
Fangati pointed to some nuts clustering
among the foliage fifty feet above the ground,
and made signs to them to climb up for
them. They shook their heads, whereupon
she laughed, ran to one of the trees, clasped
her hands about the slender stem, and began,
as it seemed to the girls, to walk up it. They
held their breath as she nimbly mounted,
and were not easy in mind until, after


throwing down several nuts, she slid to the
ground again, laughing with glee.
? Her backbone must be made of india-
rubber,? declared Tommy. ? I must try
that way.?
? No, I won?t allow it,? said Elizabeth
firmly. ? It?s not worth while to risk a
broken back. Fangati can get us all we
want.?
Fangati introduced them to several other
edible plants, of which they never learnt
the English names. The greater variety of
food was very acceptable, and though their
health had been good, except for Mary?s
touch of fever, they all declared that they
felt better than ever since Fangati came.
No doubt they owed as much to their new
interest in life as to their change of food.
They had not of late walked to the ridge.
But one day when the oranges near them
had given out, they decided to make an
excursion to the orange grove where Tommy
had first seen Fangati. When they came
near the crest a sudden change in Fangati?s
demeanour astonished them. Hitherto she
had been as merry as possible, finding cause
for laughter in everything. But all at once
she stopped dead, gave a cry, uttered the
word ? tapu,? and fled away with every
sign of terror.
The girls were amazed at her alarm, and
looked about for some explanation of it,


half expecting to see some hideous savage
approaching with uplifted club. But all
that was in sight were the unvarying features
of the landscape, and the row of posts with
their rags of pennants.
They hurried after Fangati, and tried with
the little stock of native words she had
taught them, and the few English words
she had learnt, to elicit the explanation of
her terror. She explained fluently enough,
but the only word they caught, because of
its constant repetition, was ? tapu.?
? That?s the same as taboo, I think,?
said Mary. ?It means something sacred,
but I can?t make out what could be sacred
there. It?s so strange, too, because we were
quite near the orange grove, and she was
not frightened then?unless she was fright-
ened of you, Tommy.?
? I dare say she was,? said Tommy; ? we
were both frightened, but we are good
friends now, aren?t we, Fangati ? ?
? Me Tommee plend,? said the girl.
? Are we going back without any oranges??
asked Elizabeth.
? Why should we ? ? exclaimed Tommy.
? Come along, Fangati.?
She led the way towards the ridge again,
but Fangati stood and waved her arms,
crying ? tapu ? again and again.
? Evidently she won?t cross the ridge,?
said Elizabeth; ?but we can get to the


orange grove by going round. Perhaps she
will come with us then.?
Striking off at an angle with the ridge,
they found that Fangati accompanied them
willingly. She soon recovered her wonted
high spirits. They made their way through
the undergrowth, and presently came to an
open glade, beyond which lay the orange
grove.
Here they were again surprised to see
signs of great excitement in Fangati?s face.
The girl stood still for a few moments, look-
ing about her eagerly; then, uttering a little
cry, she darted away, and in a second or
two was lost to view.
? Now what?s that mean ? ? cried Mary.
? There?s only one explanation,? said Eliza-
beth. ? She recognizes the place as being
near her home, and she has run away to
her friends.?
? Oh I what idiots we are 1 ? cried Tommy.
? This was the last place we should have
brought her to. Now we?ve lost her I ?
? Well, dear,? said Elizabeth, ? I have
often wondered whether we were right in
keeping her. She belongs to her own people,
you know, and not to us.?
? But she didn?t want to leave us. And
they don?t care a dump about her, or they?d
have come for her long before this. I?m
sure she was much happier with us than
with nasty savages.?


? Yet she has left us now,? remarked
Mary. ? They can?t be dreadfully horrid to
her.?
? Couldn?t you fetch her back, Bess ? ?
asked Tommy.
? I shouldn?t much care about it,? replied
Elizabeth. ? After all, we don?t know what
trouble we might be running into. Perhaps
she will come back to us herself.?
After taking some oranges they returned
to their own side of the island by way of
the ridge. Tommy was disconsolate. All
the sisters had become fond of Fangati,
but there was a special tie between her and
Tommy, and she was more often with
Tommy than with the others.
For the next two days they talked about
little else than Fangati?s defection. They
walked up to the orange grove, in the hope
that she would reappear, but returned with-
out a sight of the little brown face they had
learned to love. Her departure had left a
strange blank; they felt that something had
gone out of their life. Until then they had
not realized how much she had added to
their happiness.
On the third morning after breakfast
they were ? washing-up ? outside the hut?
so they called the clearing away of banana
skins, fish bones, and pieces of shell?when
they suddenly caught sight of two figures
moving among the trees some little distance


away. They sprang to their feet in alarm.
A second glance told them that the figures
were those of natives; and, struck with the
idea that the savages were stealthily ap-
proaching to attack them, they began to
run up-stream toward a patch of thick
undergrowth where they could hide.
But they had only taken a few paces when
there was a shrill cry of ?Me Tommee!?
They halted hesitatingly, to see Fangati
flying towards them, and her companion
standing still at the edge of the woodland.
When Fangati was within a few yards,
Tommy, able to restrain herself no longer,
rushed forward and clasped the brown girl
in her arms, kissing her again and again.
Fangati laughed; she laughed at everything;
then, hand in hand with Tommy, ran to the
other girls, chattering excitedly. She pointed
to the solitary native, who had not moved,
smiled, patted her own head, threw herself
down and clasped Elizabeth?s feet, ran a
little way, and then came back looking
behind her.
? I think she wants to know if she may
bring this other one,? said Mary.
? And she wants to make us understand
that we shan?t be harmed,? said Tommy.
? Let her go, Bess.?
?We gain nothing by refusing, so she
may as well,? said Elizabeth.
She waved her hands toward the second


native, and Fangati, who had been watching
her wistfully, bounded off with a gay laugh.
The girls" aw'aited her return with mixed
feelings. They were glad to see Fangati
again, but they did not much desire the
acquaintance of a strange native. They did
not yet know whether it was a man or woman.
This doubt, however, was resolved in a few
minutes. Scanning the approaching couple
anxiously, they saw that Fangati?s companion
was a grey, shrunken old man, apparently
feeble, for he moved slowly and leant on the
girl for support.
? I believe it?s the man we saw at the
native hut,? said Mary.
?Not much to be afraid of, after all,?
said Tommy. ?He looks hardly strong
enough to kill a fly.?
? How shall we speak to him ? ? said
Elizabeth.
?It will be rather a pantomime,? re-
joined Tommy. ?Be very grave and digni-
fied, Bess. Impress him with your im-
portance, Queen Bess, monarch of all she
surveys.?
? Don?t be ridiculous, Tommy,? said
Elizabeth, feeling it w r as no time for jesting.
The old man certainly looked harmless
enough, but she was by no means easy in
mind.
After wdiat seemed a long time, Fangati
led the man up to the girls.


? Bess, Mailee, Me Tommee,? she said,
pointing to each in turn.
The old man made a salutation, and the
girls looked at him with interest. His face
and every visible part of his body was
hideously tattooed, his thin bare legs looking
as if they were covered with indigo-blue
stockings. A stick w r as thrust cross-wise
through his mop of grizzled hair. Certainly
he w r as not a prepossessing object.
The girls w r ere w r ondering what they ought
to do, when they were surprised to hear the
man address them.
? I speak Inglis,? he said; ? I Maku.
Good-day all-same velly much.?
Tommy turned aside so that her smile
should not irritate or offend.
Elizabeth, with admirable composure,
said?
? How do you do, Mr. Maku I Fangati is
your granddaughter, I suppose ? ?
It was at once clear that Maku?s English
was not very abundant. The w r ord grand-
daughter puzzled him. He looked at Fan-
gati dully; then his eyes suddenly brightened.
? Fangati, he my son chile,? he said. ?He
velly good chile. He get plenty piecee me
eat. To-mollow he go; I velly solly, eh leh I
I civ.?
Elizabeth in her turn w T as puzzled, and
it was Mary who first saw the o\pr man?s
meaning.


? He says that Fangati got him plenty
to eat, but disappeared one day, and he was
very sorry, and cried.?
?No wonder, poor old man I ? cried
Tommy. ?He looks half-starved. There?s
no one else living in their hut, then ? ?
? Have you wife, children, friends ? ?
asked Elizabeth.
The old man shook his head.
? Wife he dead long-timey. Chil?en big
long way.? He waved his arm to indicate
distance. ? Plen : ah ! mikinaly he plen; he
all-same gone away; eh ! eh ! all-same dead.?
From this Mary made out that he had a
missionary friend who had gone away and
might now be dead.
A few more questions satisfied the girls
that, as far as he knew, there were no more
natives on the island except himself and his
granddaughter. Intensely relieved on this
score, they were ready to be hospitable,
and to Fangati?s delight, invited the man
to come towards their hut and talk to
them.
Seated on the ground in front of the hut
with the girls in the entrance, the old man
related a story of which they understood
little at the time. It was some few days
before Mary, thinking over what he had
said, and puzzling about it, arrived at
something like a coherent narrative. Even
then she was only partially successful. What


he had tried to explain in his scanty English
was as follows.
He had been chief of a small island a
day?s paddling to the eastward. It was
remote from the usual trade-tracks, and for
this reason had remained longer in heathen-
dom and cannibalism than most of the
Pacific Islands. But a white missionary
had at last come and taken up his abode
on the island, by whose skill in medicine,
earnest teaching, and noble character, Maku
and some of his sons had been won over.
There were certain soothsayers among the
people, who hated the new teacher when
they found their influence with the chief
gone. Working on the superstitions of the
islanders, they secretly stirred up a revolt.
But for the quickness of Fangati he would
have been attacked and killed. She dis-
covered what was going on, informed her
grandfather, and persuaded him to put to
sea by night in a canoe, with the intention
of paddling to an island to the southward,
where Maku would find friends. Forced
out of their course by wind and current,
they were nearly exhausted when by good
fortune they found themselves on the shore
of this island. They landed, erected a hut,
and had since lived there, not caring to risk
another voyage, and finding abundance of
food.
Maku could not say how long he had been


on the island, nor were the girls able to dis-
cover whether his arrival had preceded or
succeeded theirs. He told them that one
day Fangati, who had been to gather fruit,
reported that she had seen white people.
Though he thought she must be mistaken,
he bade her run away at once if she saw
any one again, -white or brown. He did not
like white people. Since they came to the
Pacific the brown people had not been
happy. They had been forced to w r ork;
some had been taken from their own islands
and carried away to toil on distant planta-
tions; new diseases had been brought among
them. He had one friend among the white
people ?the ?mikinaly?; he was a good
man and did good things. He had taught
Maku English.
True, Fangati had said that the strangers
she had seen w r ere women; but Maku could
not believe that white women could have
come to this island without white men.
And he w r as desperately afraid of being
betrayed to the ill-disposed mystery men
among his own people; for before he had
been long on the island he discovered that
it w r as the scene of certain ceremonies con-
ducted by these mystery men. At long in-
tervals, before he became a Christian, he had
himself accompanied his people in solemn
expeditions to the island. The accession of
a new chief w T as celebrated with special rites;


years and years before, in his heathen days,
his own accession had been marked by a
great cannibal feast. He was much afraid
that white people might sell him to his
revolted tribesmen, who would make him
a victim.
When Fangati disappeared he was con-
vinced that she had been captured by the
white people, and he would never see her
again. He missed her very much, for, being
old and infirm, he depended almost entirely
on her for his food. But when she sud-
denly returned and told him how she had
been carried out to sea while fishing, and
how the white women had rescued her and
treated her kindly, he felt that he must make
his presence known to them, and especially
warn them of their danger.
At this Elizabeth asked anxiously what
danger was likely to assail them. The man
hesitated. Now that it had come to the
point he seemed to be unwilling to say more.
But at length he explained that the spot at
which they had landed was the usual landing-
place of his people when they came to visit
the island, and all the ground between it
and the ridge was tapu. He struggled with
his imperfect English in trying to make
clear to the girls what that meant. They
understood at last that their side of the
island was sacred; its grounds were only to
be trodden when the people came to hold


their ceremonies, and anybody trespassing
upon it would incur the wrath of the mystery
men, and bring down upon themselves a
terrible punishment. The forbidden ground
was marked off from the rest of the island
by a line of poles set upon the ridge. Maku
confessed that he himself felt very uneasy
at having violated the tapu; and Elizabeth,
questioning him, found that beneath his
recently assumed Christianity there lay a
deep stratum of superstition. When the
? mikinaly ? was with him tapu had no
horrors for him; but the missionary had left
his island some time before the rising took
place, and with the removal of his influence
the chief had relapsed to some extent into
the superstitions of his early manhood.
The girls were not at first much alarmed
at what he told them. But when he added
that his people would certainly choose
another chief in his place, and come to the
island for the usual inaugural ceremonies,
the thought of being discovered by the
savages at such a time filled them with
dread. Their hut lay in the direct path of the
procession to the ridge; it could not escape
detection, and they trembled at the idea of
falling into the hands of people who might
be worked up to religious frenzy by their
mystery men. To violate the tapu would
be bad enough for a brown man; it would
be worse for white people.


Maku made a suggestion. Let them dis-
mantle the hut, he said, destroy all traces of
their occupation, and remove to the other
side of the island, where at least they
would not have to reckon with the anger of
the mystery men at finding them on for-
bidden ground. The girls discussed the
suggestion earnestly, and decided to follow
his advice. It gave them a pang to pull
down the little home to which they had
become accustomed : but they lost no time
in setting about it, carrying the material
down to the boat. Meanwhile, the old man
and Fangati scattered the stones of their
oven, and tried to obliterate the signs of
habitation. Maku shook his head w r hen he
saw the bleached grass on wdiat had been
the floor of the hut. Even in this land of
quick growth it must take some time before
so tell-tale an evidence was done aw r ay.
It w r as decided that Elizabeth and Mary
should row the boat round to Maku?s land-
ing-place with the canoe in tow r , while
Tommy w r alked with the old man across the
island. The chief did not follow the long
route up the stream by which the girls had
reached the ridge, but took a more slanting
course through a wild and rugged region
which they had never explored. As they
w r ere crossing the ridge he pointed out to
Tommy in the distance the entrance to the
great cave in wilich the ceremonies of his


tribe were conducted. Tommy shivered; the
thought of wild men engaged in mysterious
rites terrified her imagination. Choosing a
steep path that wound down the eastern
side of the ridge, Maku led the two young
girls to the open space near the waterfall,
and in a few minutes reached his hut. He
and Fangati at once began to rig up near
by a temporary shelter for the English girls,
and it was almost finished by the time
Elizabeth and Mary arrived.
The girls were provided by their new
friends with, an excellent meal of fish, bread-
fruit and other fruits, some of which were
strange to them. Immediately afterwards,
Maku and his granddaughter set to work
to build them a hut in the native fashion.
Elizabeth doubted whether they would like
a house which must be inevitably close and
stuffy with a doorway only high enough to
crawl through. Their own hut had been
fresh and breezy. But it seemed better to
let the natives have their way. They would
build much faster than the English girls;
and if strange natives should make their
appearance in this part of the island, they
would not be rendered suspicious as they
might be if they saw a hut so different from
what they were accustomed to.
The girls slept in their temporary shelter
that night. They had lost their fear of
savage neighbours, but this had been


replaced by a new fear of possible visitors
from beyond. Tommy had asked Maku
during their walk whether there was any
chance of a ship coming to the island.
?No ship,? he answered. ?No come
this side. Melican ship come one time, my
place; mikinaly come in Melican ship;
all-same, no mo?e.?


CHAPTER XIX
THE SHARK
The change of circumstances pleased
every one except Billy the parrot. He had
never taken kindly to Fangati, but had always
ruffled his feathers and squawked angrily
when he saw her with Tommy. The girls
laughed at these manifestations of jealousy.
But when Billy was removed from his home,
and found that his mistress?s attentions were
shared by still another person, he became
sulky. He would sit on a rock, or the bough
of a tree, blinking his bead-like eyes and
maintaining a sullen and reproachful silence.
Tommy was so much taken up with
Fangati that it is to be feared she somewhat
neglected her old favourite, as was perfectly
natural under the circumstances. When
Fangati and her grandfather had finished the
new hut, which occupied them only two days,
the young girls were constantly together.
Tommy, now that her fear of cannibal neigh-
bours was removed, became again the active,
light-hearted, adventurous girl she had ever


been. She roamed all over the island with
Fangati, not even excepting the region of
the tapu, for she found that the native girl
was ready to go in any direction, provided
she did not catch sight of the posts on
the ridge. They discovered in company
other plantations of wholesome fruits, of
kinds which Tommy already knew, and of
others which were strange to her. Fangati
showed her how to fish in the native way
with a spear of sharpened wood. At first
Tommy was sceptical about this, declaring
that with the line and hook she would catch
more fish than Fangati with the spear. But
she soon found that she was quite wrong.
Leaning over the edge of a rock, with her
keen eyes fixed on the water, Fangati would
plunge her spear rapidly, and scarcely ever
failed to bring up a fish as large as Tommy
caught, and much more quickly. Tommy
tried to imitate her, and was exceedingly
proud when, after dozens of fruitless attempts,
she succeeded in spearing her first fish.
In the course of one of their early rambles
the girls came to the pit into which Tommy
had fallen. Fangati was much interested in
this, having never seen it before, and she
ran to fetch her grandfather to the spot.
The girls asked him what was the purpose
of the pit, and he thought at first that it
had been dug as a storehouse for breadfruit.
But when Tommy told him about the


tunnel through which she had crawled,
and of the hole in the wall at the farther
end, he looked puzzled and declared that
he would go down and see for himself. It
did not take long to construct a serviceable
ladder with stout canes bound together with
creepers, and the whole party descended
into the pit and followed Tommy through
the tunnel.
Arriving at the end, Maku looked curi-
o * _
ously over the ledge. He explained to the
girls that the dim-lit space beyond was the
cave in which the mystic ceremonies of his
people were conducted. The reason of the
existence of the pit was now plain to him.
There was a tradition among his tribe that
one of his predecessor chiefs had shown an
extraordinary knowledge of some of the
secret performances of the mystery men at
which he had not been present.
? I unastan,? said Maku. ?He find hole ;
he look; oh I he say, dis fine place fo? me.
All-same he makee way dis side; makee pit;
come ?long, listen, look see; eh, eh ;he know
all-same too much.?
His explanation was not very clear, but
after a time the girls understood that the
former chief, having accidentally discovered
the tunnel opening to the cave, had dug the
pit so that he could approach it from the
inland direction, and had thus provided him-
self with a means of eavesdropping. Appar-


ently he had covered the pit with a light
lattice-work ?as the breadfruit pit was
usually covered ?and this in the course of
years had become overgrown with vegetation,
so that nobody could have suspected the hole
beneath.
On returning to the surface they pulled
up the ladder and laid it among the trees
near by. More than once during the succeed-
ing days Tommy and Fangati amused them-
selves by descending into the pit and chasing
each other in the darkness of the tunnel.
They invented other amusements. Tommy
ran races with Fangati, played at hide-and-
seek in the woods, practised shying at cocoa-
nuts. All the girls had swimming competi-
tions in the cove at low tide, and though
the English girls became very expert, they
were no match for Fangati, who dived and
gambolled in the water as though in her
native element.
In constant companionship with Fangati,
they learnt in course of time many native
words, and she on her side picked up a smat-
tering of English. They were thus able to
communicate with her freely. She amused
them by her mispronunciations. The letter
r was a stumbling-block. ? Run ? was always
? lun ? ; ? bekfas leady,? she would say ; and
she adopted from her grandfather the expres-
sion ? all-same,? which she used frequently
and in odd connections.


? I lun all-same kick, Me Tommee,? she
would say, when Tommy had beaten her in
a race; or if, in a game of hide-and-seek, it
was Mary?s turn to hide, ? Mailee all-same
hidee-sik?? was her way of putting it.
One day, having had no success at their
usual fishing-place at the mouth of the cove,
Fangati proposed that she and Tommy should
go to a spot about half-a-mile up the coast,
where she had sometimes caught fish before
the girls came. Elizabeth had laid no re-
strictions on Tommy as regards her fishing
excursions, except that she had asked her
not to go out of sight of their little harbour.
Remembering how Fangati had been carried
out to sea, she wished to guard against any
repetition of that mishap.
The spot to which Fangati pointed was
beyond the usual limit. It was not, how-
ever, far distant from the shore, and Fangati
had been much farther out when her canoe
was caught by the current. Elizabeth had
gone with Mary into the interior to gather
breadfruit, so that it was impossible to
consult her; and Tommy, anxious to have
some fish for dinner by the time her sisters
returned, agreed to try the new place.
They reached it in the canoe, Tommy
paddling. It was a large flat rock a few
hundred yards from the shore, with a deep
pool on its inner side. There they had great
success, in the course of half an hour spearing


enough fish for several meals. Thoroughly
satisfied, they had just turned their canoe
towards home when Tommy caught sight
of a large shape moving rapidly beneath the
surface of the water.
? Oh I what?s that ? ? she cried.
Almost before the words 'were out of her
mouth the canoe quivered under a terrific
shock. Then it was rocked violently to and
fro, so violently that the sea came over the
gunwale and the girls had to throw them-
selves on to the opposite side to prevent the
slight craft from overturning. As they did
this there was a sudden sharp sound as of
something snapping. Instantly the canoe
turned over, and the girls found themselves
in the sea.
Fangati laughed.
? All-same jolly fun,? she said.
Tommy was not so much amused. Being
able to swim she did not mind the sudden
bath ; but all the fish were gone; the
morning?s work was thrown away.
Fangati quickly righted the canoe, and
having clambered into it, helped Tommy to
regain her place. There was, of course, a
quantity of water at the bottom of the little
vessel.
? What was it ? ? exclaimed Tommy,
shaking the Tvater from her head. ? Was
it a shark ? ?
Fangati looked about her. In a moment


she pointed to a strange object, something
like the end of a saw, projecting from the
bottom of the canoe. Tommy had never
seen such a thing before. Stooping down,
she pulled at it. It was loosely fixed, and
came away in her hand. Instantly there was
an inrush of water.
? No, no, silly Billy,? cried Fangati, using
an expression she had heard Tommy apply
to the parrot.
She snatched the broken sword of the
sword-fish from Tommy?s hand, and tried
to replace it. But though she succeeded in
wedging it into the wood, it failed to stop
the hole entirely. Without loss of time she
seized her paddle and started for the shore,
about a quarter of a mile distant. But the
canoe had shipped a considerable quantity
of water, and this was being continually in-
creased by the inflow through the leak. It
sunk lower and lower, and every minute
answered less readily to Fangati?s paddle.
It soon became clear to the girls that the
canoe must sink long before they reached
the shore. They could easily gain the
land by swimming, but the canoe could not
be recovered if it sank.
Between them and the shore a rock stood
just above the surface. It was only about
a hundred yards away, and Fangati, exerting
all her strength, drove the canoe towards it,
and reached it in the nick of time. In


another few seconds the canoe must have
foundered.
There was not much room on the rock.
Tommy scrambled on to it, while Fangati,
slipping over into the sea, prepared to help
Tommy drag the canoe up, so that they
might tilt the water out of it, and try to
stop the leak with a handkerchief, or a part
of Tommy?s skirt.
They had just begun to tilt the canoe
when Tommy caught sight of a small dark
object on the surface of the sea about thirty
or forty yards away. It was the fin of a
shark.
? Fangati, quick I ? she called, holding
out her hands to help the girl clamber on to
the rock.
Fangati?s back was towards the shark
and she did not understand what the peril
was. But the note of terror in Tommy?s
voice alarmed her. She let go her hold of
the canoe, gained the edge of the rock
in two strokes, and with Tommy?s help
scrambled up just as the shark glided past
into the deep water beyond.
?Eh ! Eh 1 ? exclaimed Fangati, when
she saw the reason of Tommy?s fright.
? I no aflaid, what fo? aflaid of he ? You
see, all-same.?
She was about to dive into the sea and
swim after the canoe, which was already
drifting away, but Tommy caught her and


held her fast. ? No, no, you mustn?t,? she
cried anxiously.
? Boat lun kick,? cried Fangati in excite-
ment.
The canoe, relieved of the girls? weight,
would no doubt float longer than if they had
still been in it, but Tommy realized that it
must soon sink.
? Never mind,? she cried. ? Better lose
the canoe than lose you.?
Fangati stood beside her for some time,
but Tommy soon became aware of a
double danger. The tide was rising. Every
moment the ripples washed a little farther
over the rock : by and by this would be
completely submerged and they would have
to swim to the shore. The thought of this
necessity filled Tommy with terror. The
shark had disappeared only for a moment.
She could now see it again, circling about
the rock, as if it knew that it had only to
bide its time and the girls would fall an
easy prey. As soon as there was sufficient
depth of water on the rock they would be
absolutely defenceless against the monster?s
hungry jaws.
Clinging to Fangati, Tommy called aloud
for help; then, glancing shorewards, recog-
nized that there was little chance of her
voice being heard through the belt of wood-
land that separated her from the camp.
The sea now thinly covered the rock.


The canoe was rocking on the tide several
yards away; the fin of the shark could still
be seen as it wheeled around. Fangati, as
well aware of the danger as Tommy, could
remain inactive no longer.
? Knife I ? she cried eagerly, pointing to
Tommy?s pocket.
? What are you going to do ? ? asked
Tommy.
? You see. Kick ! kick ! ? said the girl.
? Don?t leave me,? pleaded Tommy, hand-
ing her the knife.
Fangati looked around as if in search of
something. Suddenly she snatched Tommy?s
handkerchief, which was tucked into
her belt, and dived off the rock. When
she disappeared Tommy saw the handker-
chief floating. In a moment the shark
rushed silently through the water, attracted
by the splash. As it came beneath the
handkerchief, which Fangati had dropped as
a decoy, she came up beneath it and plunged
the knife deep into its side. Then she dived
again and disappeared.
The shark, thrashing the water into foam,
dashed about in zigzag fashion. Tommy
watched it fascinated, fearing that it might
have struck Fangati. But in a moment
she heard the girl?s merry laugh behind her.
Fangati came up on the farther side of
the rock, on to which she clambered, splash-
ing through the water to Tommy?s side.


The girls watched the gradually weaken-
ing movements of the monster, until at
length with a final heave it sank to the
bottom. . ...
? S?im I S?im 1 ? cried Fangati, pointing
to the shore. .
? Oh, I couldn?t,? said Tommy, chnging
to the girl. . .
The possibility of there being other sharks
between her and the shore unnerved her.
Yet if she remained on this rock she must
be washed off presently by the fast-rising tide.
She was in a terrible state of anxiety, aware
that she could not keep her footing long,
yet unable to face the risk of being caught
by a shark. Fangati seemed to guess at her
state of mind. Disengaging herself from
Tommy?s grasp, without waiting for objec-
tions, she slipped off the rock and swam
rapidly after the canoe, which was drifting
farther and farther down the coast. Tommy
watched her anxiously. Would she reach
the canoe safely ? Could she return with
it in time ?
The water was now up to Tommy?s waist;
she could hardly keep her footing as the tide
surged over the rock. The gap between the
little black head and the canoe was steadily
diminishing. Tommy gave a gasp of relief
as she saw that Fangati had overtaken the
little craft. But what was she doing ? She
had swum beyond it. In a moment Tommy


saw the explanation : the paddle had drifted
beyond the canoe, and the swimmer had to
recover it first. Fangati caught the paddle,
turned about, and swimming back to the
canoe, climbed over its side.
Tommy was seized with a sickening fear
that help would come too late. The waves
were tumbling over the rock with increasing
force : her feet were lifted : she had the
presence of mind to tread water, but was all
the time in a state of nervous terror, expect-
ing a shark to come up and snatch her in
its horrid jaws. She felt that Fangati in
the water-logged canoe could not reach her
in time. Again she screamed for help.
There came an answer from behind her.
Turning her head, scarcely able to keep
afloat, she saw Elizabeth in the dinghy
sculling towards her. She swam frantically
to meet her : to regain a foothold on the
rock was now impossible. Elizabeth, glanc-
ing over her shoulder, called a cheery
word, and pulled so as to meet her sister.
A few more strokes brought them together.
Elizabeth shipped oars, but found that she
could not lift Tommy into the dinghy without
assistance. Luckily Fangati was close at
hand in the canoe, now so full of water as
to be on the point of sinking. When she
arrived Tommy was got into the boat, and
lay down exhausted. Elizabeth pulled her
rapidly to land, while Fangati, disdaining


[. ? _ ,1
fiL jSzS^&^'VK* **st
I ?*^V t Sj
??---
. i OKf'** ' V fK>r Jg?




sharks, leapt into the sea, and swam, pushing
the canoe in front of her.
Tommy was very contrite when Elizabeth
lifted her on to dry land. ? I won?t do it
again, Bess,? she murmured, clinging to her
sister. ?I oughtn?t to have gone so far.
I was nearly drowned.?
? Never mind, dear,? said Elizabeth.
? It?s all right now. I was a little anxious
when I got back and found you still away,
and I?m so glad I came to look for you.
Do you know, when I caught sight of Fangati
and couldn?t see you I had a most horrible
fear. What happened? Why didn?t you
swim ashore ? ?
Tommy told her the whole story. Eliza-
beth forbore to reproach her. She saw
that the young girl had suffered a terrible
fright, and it would not be necessary to
enforce the lesson. She gave Fangati warm
praise for what she had done, and Tommy?s
fondness for the native girl was deepened by
this adventure they had shared.


CHAPTER XX
THE PRISONER IN THE CAVE
Since their change of residence the girls
had used a fresh look-out station. The
precipice which they had noticed when they
first caught sight of Maku?s hut was very
lofty, and from its summit a more extensive
outlook could be obtained than any they
had yet enjoyed. Its face was unscalable;
but Fangati had discovered a means of
reaching its top from the rear. The way
was steep and arduous, but the girls made
light of it. Every day one of them climbed
to the summit, and cast a searching glance
over the sea ; but for weeks in succession
they saw no vessel, large or small.
One afternoon, however, Mary was startled
on reaching the summit to see in the dis-
tance a small fleet of native canoes approach-
ing the island. She ran down the hillside
at full speed with the new's. Maku instantly
sent Fangati up to examine the vessels, and
when by and by she declared that they
were canoes from her own island the old
man shook with fright.


The visit was what he had long expected
and dreaded. His people were coming with
their new chief to perform the usual cere-
monies in the cave. He knew that if he
were discovered he could expect no mercy;
the mystery men would seize upon him,
and their followers, inflamed with religious
frenzy and palm wine, would tear him to
pieces.
The younger girls were beside themselves
with terror. But Elizabeth rose to the
occasion. She saw that Maku, with a kind of
fatalism, was disposed to await his destiny
without stirring a hand to avert it; but a
possible means of escape at once occurred
to her. The canoes were still some distance
out at sea. The usual landing-place was
near the girls? old settlement on the other
side of the island. It would probably be
dark before the savages landed, so that
twelve or more hours might elapse before
the danger became pressing. In that time
it would be possible to demolish the huts,
obliterate the most tell-tale traces of habita-
tion, and convey enough food to the pit to
last them until the unwelcome visitors had
completed their rites and taken their de-
parture. The existence of the pit was un-
known to them, and though it was impossible
to cover it, there was a chance that, if the
savages should light upon it, they would
imagine it to be an old breadfruit pit, as


Maku had done, and never suspect that it
communicated with the cave.
She explained her plan rapidly to the
others. Maku was inclined to do nothing,
but the girls were feverishly ready to attempt
any means of escape. Elizabeth sent Fan-
gati to the top of the cliff to watch the
canoes, bidding her be careful to keep out
of sight. Then with her sisters she set to
work to tear down their light hut and cast
its materials into the stream. This would
carry them to the sea, and as the current
flowed away from the landing-place they
would soon drift beyond observation. Be-
fore long the energy of the girls galvanized
Maku into activity. He demolished his hut
in the same way.
They then destroyed their fire-places,
covered up the blackened earth with sand,
and threw into the stream all the Utter
that betokened occupation. It was im-
possible to remove all traces; the vegetation
around the little settlement was trampled,
and nothing but time could undo that.
? What about the boat and canoe ? ? said
Tommy.
?We must drag them up among the
trees and hope that they will not be dis-
covered,? replied EUzabeth. ? Luckily, there
are no fruit-trees in that clump by the shore,
so there?s nothing to take the savages
there.?


The boats were soon hidden among the
undergrowth. Then they collected their
little belongings, kettle, cups, fishing-line
and spears, and all the food they had at
hand. They made their mat-beds into ham-
mocks by stringing them at the corners
with creepers, and filled these with all they
wished to carry away. By this time it was
nearly dark. Fangati, flying down the hill-
side, reported that the canoes had entered
the lagoon by the gap in the reef and had
now passed from sight. It was clear that
they were making for the usual landing-
place. Maku said that the people would
camp for the night on the shore, next
day roam the island in search of food, and
in the evening hold a great feast in the
cave.
Having made all their preparations, they
set off towards the pit laden with the
hammocks.
? Oh, we can?t take Billy,? said Elizabeth,
noticing that the parrot was perched on
Tommy?s shoulder. ? His screaming would
ruin us.?
Tommy was distressed at the thought of
leaving her old pet behind, but there was
clearly no help for it. The bird?s wings
being clipped it could not fend for itself
very well, and Tommy decided to carry it
down to the boat and leave it there with
enough food for several days. She kissed


it on parting, fearing that she might never
see it again.
They found their ladder where they had
left it among the trees. After letting down
the hammocks they descended one by one,
removed the ladder, and retreated towards
the entrance of the tunnel. Their passage
had left traces on the ground above, which
must betray them if the keen-eyed savages
came that way; but there was nothing to
bring them in that direction; and the girls
hoped that the pit would be a secure hiding-
place during the three days the savages
might be expected to spend on the island.
The fruits they had brought with them
would supply them with food and drink for
several days. The lack of water, which
might have otherwise distressed them, was
partially made up by the juice of oranges
and cocoa-nuts.
They found the atmosphere of the pit
close and unpleasant, but Elizabeth re-
flected that if nothing happened to alarm
them they might climb up at dead of night
and get a little fresh air while the savages
were sleeping.
The girls had little sleep during the first
night. Every few minutes they would wake
and listen, wondering if by some unlucky
chance their hiding-place had been dis-
covered. They were still more uneasy when
day broke. What were the savages doing ?


THE PRISONER IN THE CAVE 209
Fangati offered to climb up and spy upon
them, but Elizabeth would not permit this.
While they all remained in the pit they were
safe ; if the savages should catch sight of
any one, they would, almost certainly, never
rest until they had discovered the where-
abouts of the inhabitants.
The hours of daylight dragged slowly
away. The girls scarcely dared to speak.
Several times Fangati stole along to the
end of the tunnel to see if the savages had
yet entered the cave; but there was no sign
of them until the afternoon was far advanced.
Then the girl ran back to report that there
was a great noise below. She had been
much too frightened to stay any longer; but
Maku now said that he would go and learn
who the people were.
He was absent so long that the girls
began to be alarmed, and were thinking of
going in search of him, when they heard the
light rustle of his footsteps. On rejoining
them he groaned heavily,
? What is the matter ? ? asked Elizabeth
anxiously.
The old chief groaned again. He did not
reply to Elizabeth, but spoke in a low tone
rapidly to Fangati. The girls had picked
up a good many native words, but their
knowledge of the language was not sufficient
for them to understand this conversation.
From Maku?s groans and Fangati?s exclama-


tions of distress they gathered that the
chief had made some disagreeable discovery,
and Elizabeth at length insisted on his telling
her what troubled him.
The girls were horrified when they heard
what he had to say. The cave was full of
his own people. Among them he had seen,
by the light of their torches of cocoa-nut
husks, the new chief, a young man wdio was
high in favour with the mystery men and
had led the revolt against himself. But
w r hat had distressed him was the sight of a
prisoner lying bound against the w r all of the
cave. It was a white man, and Maku w r as
almost sure it was the ? mikinaly.? The
mystery men could only have one object in
bringing a white missionary to the scene of
their dreadful orgies: he was to be offered
up as a sacrifice to their heathen deities.
At this terrible new r s the girls? blood ran
cold. Dreadful as the horrors of cannibal-
ism had been to their imagination, the
knowledge that the reality would soon be
enacted so near at hand w r as overpowering.
The thought of any human creature being
tortured and killed in cold blood was
agony to them; and that the victim should
be a white man, a fellow-countryman, within
reach of them, and yet beyond their help,
caused them to shrink and quiver as with
actual physical pain.


For some time they sat in silence, clasping
their arms about each other.
Every now and again the old man uttered
a groan. They could not see one another
in the darkness, and Tommy?s match-lighter
was exhausted, so that they could not
obtain a light; but the girls were conscious
by a sort of electric sympathy that Maku
and even gay-hearted little Fangati were
scarcely less affected than themselves.
? Will it be to-night ? ? asked Elizabeth
presently, in a whisper.
? No, no,? replied Maku ; ? two days,
flee days, den all gone.?
This answer only increased the horror of
the situation. The victim was to linger
through three days anticipating his cruel
death. The savages knew net so much
mercy as to send him early to his doom.
?He no ?flaid ; he all-same good man,?
murmured Maku.
? I can?t stand it,? cried Elizabeth, spring-
ing up; ?I must see for myself. Perhaps
something can be done for him.?
? Don?t, Bess 1 ? exclaimed Tommy, cling-
ing to her. ? What can you do ? They
may see you.?
? No, they can?t do that. I must go.
Perhaps if I screamed at them they would
take me for an evil spirit and run away.?
44 But what then ? ? said Mary. 44 You


could not go round and release the poor
man ; you would be seen.?
? Yes ; it was a foolish idea. But some-
thing may suggest itself. Oh, I can?t bear
to think about the poor man.?
?If you go, I go too,? said Tommy.
? I won?t leave you.?
The two set off, and felt their way stum-
blingly through the passage. Presently they
were aware of a pungent aromatic smell,
that increased as they went on. This was
explained when they reached the opening
in the wall; looking over stealthily, they
saw, sixteen or twenty feet below them, on
the floor of the cave, a strange bewildering
sight. A ring of dusky men held aloft
great flaring torches which gave out a heavy
smoke that penetrated into the tunnel.
Without the circle there stood a row of
drummers beating a rhythmic music on
their instruments; within, a crowd of men
were leaping in wild gyrations, uttering
frenzied yells. In the haze nothing could
be seen distinctly; all was a confused whirl.
The prisoner was quite invisible.
The dance continued for a long time, the
movements becoming ever more violent and
fantastic, the cries more frantic, the drum-
ming more swift and vigorous. At last,
when the din was at its highest, the drum-
mers gave one tremendous crash and dropped
their sticks. The whirling and the yells


THE PRISONER IN THE CAVE 278
ceased as by magic; the performers flung
themselves fainting on the ground ; and
there was a great silence. But only for a
few minutes. Then the men leapt to their
feet again, rushed to the side of the cave,
and returned, bringing the food laid there
in readiness, and many gourds filled with
the fermented sap of palm-trees. The
torch-bearers stuck their torches in crannies
on the walls, and the whole company
gave themselves up to feasting. The girls
turned sick as they w f atched the ravening
gluttony of the men, and withdrew their
eyes.
? Let us go back,? whispered Tommy.
? No, no, wait,? said Elizabeth; ? I want
to know what will happen.?
Crouching below the opening, they waited
for what seemed hours. The barbarous
noise continued, voices were raised in ex-
citement; but presently the uproar dimin-
ished, and finally ceased. Glancing down
again, they saw the natives lying in all
sorts of attitudes. Exhausted by the orgy,
drunken ?with wine, they had fallen into
a heavy sleep.
Some of the torches had gone out. Though
the illumination was dimmer, the smoke was
so much less that objects could more easily
be distinguished. Against the wall at the
right hand the girls saw what appeared at
first to be a large bundle. But in a few


moments they recognized the form of a man
?an old man with a long white beard.
?It is the missionary I ? whispered Eliza-
beth, clenching her hands in an agony of
despair.


CHAPTER XXI
A DESPERATE ADVENTURE
Heroism is a plant of strange growth.
It springs up suddenly, mysteriously, in
unexpected places. A simple peasant girl,
tending her flocks, hears a \ oice ; and she
becomes a warrior, a leader of men, the
saviour of her country. A maidservant,
after a day of scrubbing floors and washing
dishes, is darning stockings in the kitchen
when she smells fire, rushes into the bed-
room where the children are asleep, and
carries them one by one through the flames
into safety, at the cost of her own life.
Such opportunities fall to few. The most
of us trudge a very unheroic journey through
life. The road may be dusty, with ups and
downs,dangerous corners and wearisome hills;
but we plod along, keeping pretty closely
to the highway, and taking great care at the
crossings. It is only the odd one here and
there who, by what we call the accident of
circumstance, or by some compelling adven-
turousness of spirit, strays into the golden


fields of romance, and is transformed into
the shining semblance of a hero.
Yet the capacity for heroism may be
latent under many a sober coat or homely
apron. The town girl who shudders at a
cow, the country girl who trembles at the
looming of a motor omnibus, may show
under the stress of some high emotion, at the
call of some great emergency, qualities that
match her with Joan of Arc or Alice Ayres.
Elizabeth Westmacott?s life had been
very simple and uneventful. She had had
nothing more difficult to cope with than
the ordinary crosses and perplexities of the
daily round at the farm. She had never come
face to face with mortal peril, or felt any
stern demand upon her courage and endur-
ance. But as she returned along the tunnel
with her sister a great resolution shaped
itself within her mind. A white man was
in danger of his life; she would at least try
to save him.
She was very quiet when she rejoined the
little party in the pit. It was Tommy who,
quivering with excitement, related to Mary
what she had seen. The younger girls
deplored the hapless condition of the old
missionary; they wished he could be saved,
but they felt the vanity of wishing. Eliza-
beth sat in silence, thinking hard.
? I must go up and get a breath of air,?
she said at last.


? I?ll come too,? said Tommy.
? No, dear, not yet; I want to be alone.
There was something in her tone that set
her sister wondering.
? You?ll be careful, Bess ? said Mary.
? Yes, I must be careful,? was the reply.
Elizabeth climbed up the ladder. She
was gone some time; her return was an-
nounced by a slight rustling thud upon the
ground; something had been thrown into
the pit. , _ .
? What is that ? ? asked Tommy. Are
you all right, Bess ? ?
? Quite right,? said Elizabeth as she
descended. ?It is only a lot of creepers.
We are going to make another ladder.
44 Another 1 We don?t want another.
? The first isn?t long enough or the right
sort. I am going to release the poor mis-
sionary.? ,
The girls were for the moment speechless
with amazement. Then Tommy said?
? You are mad, Bess; it is impossible.
Don?t talk such absolute rubbish.?
?It isn?t rubbish, dear. The savages
are asleep. We can let down a rope ladder.
I will climb down and cut his bonds. He
will be safe if we get him into the^ tunnel.?
? Oh, how insane you are 1 We shan?t
let you do any such tiling.?
? You are bound to wake them, Bess,?
said Mary; ? you know how lightly savages


sleep. They are just like dogs, and wake
at a whisper.?
?Not when they have fuddled them-
selves. I must do it, girls. I can?t bear to
leave the poor old man to his fate without
trying to help him. It is possible, and you
must help me.?
Protest, entreaty, expostulation, were alike
vain. Even when Tommv, with an air of
triumph, exclaimed, ?The hole isn?t big
enough for you to squeeze through,?
Elizabeth simply replied, ? Then we must
make it bigger.?
Tommy knew from old experience that
her elder sister was rather slow to make up
her mind about anything; but when it was
made up nothing would turn her. Some
people called it firmness, I dare say there was
a touch of obstinacy as well. It was evident
that Elizabeth was thoroughly determined
now, and the younger girls at length desisted
from their attempts to dissuade her, and
agreed to help.
Leaving Mary to assist Maku and Fangati
in constructing a light ladder from the
creepers she had gathered, Elizabeth set off
with Tommy to return to the cave end of
the tunnel. They had their knives with
them. On arriving at the hole, they saw
that the natives were still asleep, and several
of the torches were almost burnt out. The
dimmer light favoured their work of enlarg-


ing the hole, which, as Tommy had said,
was too narrow by several inches for Eliza-
beth to pass through, still less the rescued
prisoner.
When Elizabeth said that the hole must be
made bigger, she had no definite knowledge
whether it was possible. It was character-
istic of her to form a resolution and then
bend everything towards its accomplish-
ment. If she had had a favourite motto
it would have been ? Where there?s a will
there?s a way.? Nevertheless, it was with
some anxiety that she examined the hole.
One side of it was solid rock; it would be
a week?s work to make any impression on
it with their knives. But the other side was
of a more friable character. It appeared to
be formed of fragments that had settled
down, and become compacted by the weight
above. A tentative chipping at this with
her knife showed Elizabeth that it would
not be a difficult matter to scrape away
enough to enlarge the hole by more than
a foot.
There was danger in the task. Work
as carefully as they might, it would be im-
possible to prevent some of the chips and
dust from dropping into the cave. Luckily,
none of the sleepers was immediately
beneath the hole; and Elizabeth thought
that by working carefully, collecting the
larger chips and placing them on the floor


of the tunnel, they might obviate the risk
of awakening the men by the noise of falling
stones.
They set to work very quietly, not daring
even to whisper to each other. By making
boring movements with the points of their
knives they brought away a good deal of
fine dust, which they took in their hands as
far as possible and cast at their feet. When-
ever they found that a piece of rock of any
considerable size was becoming loosened
they ceased work altogether with their
knives and worried it out with their fingers.
At such times the fall of a certain quantity
of dust into the cave could not be avoided,
and more than once they stopped, holding
their breath as they listened for some signs
of disturbance below. But all went well.
All that troubled them was the terrible
slowness of the work. They were certainly
enlarging the hole, but every inch seemed to
take an hour. Elizabeth wondered anxiously
whether they would have finished before
daylight, when it would be too late to go
further with her plan.
Thinking of this, her attention strayed
for a moment from her work; and before
she could do anything to prevent it, a large
fragment of rock became detached, and
fell with a crash upon the floor of the cave.
The girls started back, a cold shiver running
through them. They heard voices, but not


so loud or excited as they expected. They
dared not look out at the hole, m case they
were spied from below; but they guessed
that only a few of the sleepers had been
awakened, and when, after some minutes,
the sounds diminished and ceased altogether,
they drew breath again.
Apparently the natives had not been
alarmed; such falls of rock from the roof
of the cave were probably not uncommon.
After an interval they resumed their work
with renewed courage, not, however, pre-
suming on their immunity, but taking even
more care than before. A second fall might
not pass so easily.
They continued at the task for hours.
The torches in the cave went out one by one.
When only one was left alight Elizabeth
looked at her watch. It w r as past four
o?clock. The hole seemed to her now wide
enough to admit any ordinary man ; but
clearly it was too late to attempt the more
difficult part of her plan. She was tired
out. It would take some time to fetch the
rope ladder from the pit, and before the
prisoner could be released and brought up
into the tunnel, daylight might be upon
them. Besides, the feasters would have
slept off the effect of their orgy, and there
would be a perilous risk of their awakening.
She thought it best to return to the pit and
sleep. If Maku was right, there was still


more than thirty hours? respite, and she would
need all her strength and composure of mind
for the final effort.
The two girls dragged themselves wearily
through the tunnel. Half-way they heard
footsteps approaching them.
? Who?s that ? ? cried Tommy.
? I?m so glad you are safe,? replied Mary.
?We have finished the ladder, though it
wasn?t easy to make it in the dark, and I
was getting anxious about you.?
? We shall have to put it off until to-
night,? said Elizabeth. ? The hole is large
enough now, but it is too late to do any more.
We are dead-beat and so terribly thirsty.?
They returned to the pit and refreshed
themselves with cocoa-nut juice. But this
was a poor substitute for water, and when
Fangati heard them say how they longed
for water to drink, and to bathe their hands
and faces, she volunteered to climb up and
bring full cups from the stream that ran
hard by. There was still an hour of darkness
left, so Elizabeth agreed, and the young girl
clambered up the ladder, carrying two of
their tin cups. She returned very quickly,
and made the journey a second time : the
girls, after bathing their heads with wet
handkerchiefs, lay down and slept the sleep
of exhaustion.
It was high noon when they awoke,
ravenously hungry. Elizabeth carried the


new ladder out into the pit, where there was
sufficient light to examine it. Considering
that it had been made in darkness it proved
a wonderfully successful piece of work, and
only needed strengthening here and there.
? How will you fix it at the hole, Bess ? ?
asked Tommy. ? There is nothing to fasten
it to.?
? I had thought of that. The only way
is to bind the top end of it to a long cane
or stem?too long to pass through the hole.
That will do it, I think. I wish we had our
boat-hook.?
? Suppose it should break ? ?
? I am sure that the ladder won?t break :
those creepers are extraordinarily tough,
as you know. And half the strain will be
borne by the wall, so that the pole ought not
to snap. With God?s help we shall succeed,
dear.?
? I am dreadfully afraid, Bess.?
? The only thing I?m afraid of is the
savages finding this pit. If they should
come to it they would certainly notice the
newly-trampled ground, and I don?t think
anything could save us then. But we must
hope for the best.?
The day passed all too slowly. How they
longed for night to come I They could not
feel easy in mind until they were sure that
their hiding-place was not discovered. Yet
the younger girls dreaded the night equally,


for though the first part of Elizabeth?s plan
was safely accomplished, they could not
think without horror of their sister descend-
ing among the savages. Elizabeth?s quiet
confidence amazed them. All that disturbed
her was the fear that the prisoner might
not be spared until nightfall.
Several times during the day she went to
the end of the tunnel and looked over into
the cave. On one of these occasions the
place was empty except for the prisoner,
who lay where she had seen him before,
motionless. Was he still alive ? Had his
captors given him food and drink ? She
felt an intense compassion for the poor man.
Would there be time, she wondered, to set
him free now, before the savages returned ?
She blamed herself for not bringing the
ladder with her; but reflected that she could
not have known that the cave would be
deserted. Probably by the time she had
fetched the ladder and come back with
Maku and some of the others to assist her,
the opportunity would have passed.
But she might speak to the prisoner and
let him know that an attempt would be made
to save him. She looked anxiously towards
the mouth of the cave. Nobody was in
sight. No sound came from the exterior.
She might at least venture to make a sound
that would attract the attention of the
prisoner and yet not arouse suspicion if it


were heard by the natives. Leaning slightly
over the ledge, she gave a low whistle. The
prisoner did not stir. There was no sign
that the sound had been heard, either by him
or by another. She whistled again rather
more loudly. Still no sign. Taking courage
she bent still lower, and called in a low, clear
tone ?
? White man ! ?
She could think of no other form of address.
Maku had not told her the missionary?s
name : she had not thought to ask it.
? White man 1 ? she repeated.
The light was dim, but it seemed to her
that the prostrate form moved. ? White
man, do you hear me ? ? she said, panting,
watching the entrance of the cave intently,
stretching her ears for the slightest sound.
There came a murmur from below.
?Do you hear me ? ? she called again.
? Yes,? was the answer, in a tone so faint
that she could scarcely catch it. 44 Who
speaks ??
44 Listen I ? said Elizabeth. 44 Friends are
here ?English friends. To-night you will be
set free. You will have to climb a ladder;
do you understand ? ?
44 1 hear,? said the voice. 44 God bless
you I ?
44 Hush 1 ? said Elizabeth in a quick whis-
per : she had seen a shadow pass across
the entrance. She withdrew her head. A


man entered, followed by others, their arms
full of food for the night?s feast.
She hurried back to the pit, thrilling with
excitement.
?He is alive I ? she cried. ?I have
spoken to him, I told him we would save him
to-night.?
? Oh, why did you I ? said Mary tremu-
lously. ? Suppose you can?t do it 1 the poor
man will be restless all day. The savages
may notice it and be on their guard.?
?lam sure I did right,? said Elizabeth.
?It will be best for him to be prepared. If
he were released without warning he might
be too much overcome to collect himself,
and our chance would be lost. As it is he
will know what to expect and be ready to
help. Oh, I wish it were dark 1 ?
Knowing how much depended on her
calmness and self-possession, Elizabeth tried
to sleep, but her nervous excitement made
this impossible. She employed herself dur-
ing the remaining hours of daylight in testing
and strengthening the ladder, and especially
in ensuring that the loops through which the
supporting pole was to pass were strong
enough to bear the strain. The pole could
not be obtained until the fall of night
rendered it safe to issue from the pit. She
explained carefully to Maku and Tommy,
who were to help her, how they should hold
the pole in position across the lower part of


the hole, and how, if they found that she
had been discovered, they were to draw up
the ladder immediately and remain perfectly
quiet. At this Tommy?s lips trembled :
the idea of losing Elizabeth was dreadful.
But she determined not to increase the
difficulty of her sister?s task by any show of
agitation, and accepted her instructions
without a word.
As for Maku, he had all along said nothing
either for or against the scheme. He seemed
to have lost all individuality and to move
like an automaton at Elizabeth?s bidding.
? What is your missionary?s name ? ? she
asked him.
He gave a native name which he was
unable to translate ; the English name he
had either forgotten or never heard.
As soon as the first shades of evening
descended, Elizabeth and Fangati climbed
out of the pit, and after a little search
returned with a stout sapling, which, when
a few inches had been snapped off, gave a rod
not so long as the breadth of the tunnel at
the farther end, but longer than the width of
the hole. Having fastened the rope ladder
firmly to this, Elizabeth gave it to Maku to
carry, and led the way along the tunnel.
She had wished Mary to remain with Fangati
at the pit, but Mary declared that she could
not bear to be left behind wondering in the
agony of suspense, so the whole party set off,


Elizabeth impressing on them all the need of
perfect silence.
They came to the end. The glare, the
acrid smoke, the strident voices, proclaimed
that the ceremonies had already begun.
Elizabeth gave one glance into the cave, and
having seen that the prisoner was still in
the same position she withdrew her eyes;
the bestial conduct of the savages sickened
her. Hour after hour passed. The din was
hideous. It seemed that the ceremonies on
this second night were being prolonged. But
presently they came to the same sudden end
as before. The drumming and the frenzied
chant ceased; instead were heard the sounds
of men engaged in riotous feasting. Maku
was restless; his faded eyes lit up. Elizabeth
remembered that he must have taken part
in similar orgies, and felt a nervous dread
lest the excitement should communicate it-
self to him, and he should by some sudden
outcry betray his presence. She laid her
hand on his shoulder and whispered?
? Remember your friend there.?
The old man gave a sigh, and shrank away
from the hole, murmuring incomprehensibly
in his own tongue.
As on the previous night, the intoxicating
liquor drunk by the rioters produced its
effect in somnolence. One by one they threw
themselves back and fell into swinish slum-
ber. At last there was silence. Several of the


torches had gone out and not been replaced.
Elizabeth thought her chance of success
would be greatest if she waited until only one
or two remained alight. She could not wait
for absolute darkness, for some light was
necessary for her task, and she must act
while the sleep of the natives was heaviest.
Now that the critical moment had come
she was strangely calm. All nervousness and
excitement had vanished; her whole being
was possessed by one dominating idea the
rescue of the prisoner. Noiselessly she let
down the flexible ladder, which lay close
against the wall. Then seeing that Tommy
and Maku had grasped the ends of the small
pole as she had instructed them, she prepaied
to clamber through the aperture. At the
last moment Mary flung her arms round her
neck and kissed her passionately; then she
was gone.
She slipped down the ladder very quickly
on her bare feet, carrying her open knife.
She stood on the floor. The men were
for the most part stretched towards the
middle of the cave, but one or two lay near
the prisoner. Pausing just one moment to
look around, she moved quickly along the
wall, holding her skirts close about her
as she passed the sleepers. She came to
the prisoner and stooped. His eyes were
open. She dared not cut his bonds with
rapid strokes, for fear the snapping should


be heard. Gently she sawed the tendrils
that were wound round about his whole
body, all her senses alert. It seemed ages
before the bonds were all loosened and
removed.
The prisoner did not stir. Elizabeth beck-
oned to him, but with his eyes he seemed to
try to explain that he was helpless. One of
the natives moved uneasily, and for one
intolerable moment Elizabeth lost her head.
Then she understood: the prisoner?s bonds
had been so tightly drawn, and he had so
long remained in the one position, that his
limbs were numbed. Slipping to her knees,
she began to chafe his legs. A man at the
far end of the cave gave a cough, and a
hot wave surged through the girl. At that
moment she could have wished the earth to
open and swallow her. But once again there
was silence, and the terror passed.
In a few minutes the prisoner was able
to move his legs. Alternately bending and
straightening them, he felt them tingling
with the coursing blood. Elizabeth rose,
glanced timorously round, and held out her
hands to him. He got up, staggered, and
would have fallen but for her sustaining
arms. There was not enough space for
both to pass abreast between the wall and
the prostrate natives. Walking backwards,
Elizabeth led him slowly towards the waiting
ladder. Every step was painful to him, and


as he crept feebly on, Elizabeth?s heart mis-
gave her; would he have the strength to
climb ? They came to the foot of the ladder.
All the torches were now extinguished save
one. Complete darkness would have been
welcome if only Elizabeth could have had
confidence in the old man s strength. She
pointed to the ladder, then upwards towards
the gap. The missionary understood. For
an instant Elizabeth hesitated. Should she
go first, leaving the prisoner to follow, or
see him in safety before she mounted herself ?
A moment?s consideration showed her that
she must be the first to climb. Maku and
Tommy would need all their strength to keep
the pole in position; the missionary was tall
and no light weight; he could not scramble
through the hole unaided; therefore she must
be there to help him. She dared not speak
to him, but in dumb show she indicated what
he must do. He nodded. Then she gave
a slight tug upon the ladder as a sign to those
above, and nimbly mounted.
She reached the top, slid through the hole,
and looked back. The old man was begin-
ning to climb. With fast-beating heart she
watched him, dreading that now, even at
the last moment, he might miss his footing
and fall back among his mortal enemies.
They slept on. Slowly, carefully, the climber
drew himself up. To Elizabeth, fixing her
eyes on him, it seemed that he would never


reach her. The ladder creaked; would the
sleepers waken ? She looked anxiously to-
wards them; they did not move. Inch by
inch he came nearer; he had almost gained
the top, when he swayed and for one terrible
moment she thought he was lost. But with
a great effort he recovered himself; he
mounted again ; his head level with
the hole. Elizabeth thrust out her arms,
gripped his wrists, and drew him into the
tunnel, holding him firmly with her strong,
supple hands. He was through.
But his shoulders had pressed heavily upon
the sides of the hole, and his feet had not
touched the floor of the tunnel when several
fragments of loosened rock fell and struck
the ground with a resounding clatter. There
was commotion below. Quick as thought
Elizabeth drew up the ladder, leaving Mary
to support the old man, whose efforts had
exhausted him.
As the ladder came through the hole it
caught a fragment of rock that lay on the
ledge. Elizabeth dashed forward to prevent
this from falling. But it escaped her and
fell crashing to the ground at the feet of
one of the natives, w r ho w T as looking up in
wonderment at the strange thing crawling as
it were into the w r all.
A yell proclaimed his discovery. All hope
of secrecy w r as at an end. Instantly the cave
was filled with uproar. The sleeping men


had leapt to their feet. At first their cries
were of amazement and alarm, but one blew
the flickering torch into flame, others kind e
fresh torches at it, and in the illumination
they saw that their prisoner was gone, in
his place were the severed bonds, and beside
them Elizabeth?s open knife, which in her
anxious help of the old missionary she had
*�With yells of rage the natives dashed
hither and thither, pointing at the gap in
the wall, in too great a frenzy of excitement
to hit on a means of pursuing the prisoner.
One picked up a trade gun and fired, but the
uselessness of this must have been apparen
to them all. Suddenly, at a word from
their chief, six of them darted from the
cave into the open. In a few minutes they
returned, bringing two straight, young trees
which they had uprooted from the loose soil
outside. These they set against the wall, and
with hideous shouts of anticipated triumph
they began to swarm up towards the hole.


CHAPTER XXII
FRIENDS IN NEED
Meanwhile at the moment of discovery
the little company in the tunnel was over-
come with horror and despair. The strain
of the last few minutes had told upon Eliza-
beth?s strength. She trembled in every
limb. The others were as though paralysed;
and the missionary, bewildered and unstrung,
stood helpless, his arms clasped by Mary in a
convulsive grip.
The glare of the rekindled torches threw
a sudden light upon the end of the tunnel.
The report of the shot seemed to shock
Elizabeth into renewed energy. ? Back to
the pit 1 ? she cried. ?Mary, go first with
the missionary.?
He had now recognized Maku, and was lost
in amazement. The whole party set off along
the tunnel. Elizabeth guessed that the
ascent of the wall would offer no difficulties
to men practised in climbing cocoa-nut
palms, and though she was urging her friends
towards the pit she had no hope of ultimate
escape.


The light soon failed. They had perforce
to move slowly, and Mary warned the mis-
sionary that presently when the roof became
lower he would have to crawl on hands
and knees. She stretched her arms above
her head so that she might know when the
time for stooping came. The rest followed
close behind, Elizabeth bringing up the rear
The lowest part of the tunnel was about
one-third of its length from the gap. As
she crawled through this with Tommy im-
mediately in front of her, Elizabeth had a
sudden thought which turned despair mto
hone The roof was no more than three
feet above the floor. If only the narrow
space could be blocked, an effective obstacle
to pursuit would be set up. Was it pos-
sible t This portion of the tunnel was but
a few yards in length. As soon as she was
able to stand again she called to the rest to
halt
? Have you your knives ? ? she asked her
sisters when they came to her.
? Yes,? they both answered.
? Come with me, Mary,? she said, taking
Tommy?s knife from her. ?? Go on with the
others; we will follow soon.?
Marv and she returned to the point where
the roof sloped, and Elizabeth, slipping to
her knees, began to prod at it with the km e.
To her great joy a shower of loose shale
fell.


Help me, Mary; work as hard as you
can. J
? ? pir knives energetically. The
missionary, anxious to learn what they were
about, joined them, and, having no other
implement, lifted a piece of hard rock and
prodded at the roof with that. Soon a con-
siderable heap of earth and shale was piled
up on the floor. But their tools were poor
substitutes for pickaxes, and Elizabeth feared
that there would not be time to block the
effectivel y before the savages arrived.
All at once there was a tremendous crash?
and the girls started back in alarm, not
quickly enough to escape some clods of earth
that struck them heavily. The loosening
of the under layer of the roof had disturbed
the mass above, and there had now fallen
upon the floor an immense quantity of debris
which completely blocked the tunnel, and
could only be removed with long labour.
Elizabeth gave a cry of joy.
? Come SaVed f � r the present ?? she said.
They hurried after the others, whom they
overtook just as they reached the opening
into the pit. 6
? W m C , an,t st fy here,? said Elizabeth;
they 11 know there must be another en-
trance, and will discover it as soon as it is
bght We must get up into the woods and


? The precipice ! ? said Mary instantly.
? We could hardly get there in the dark,?
replied Elizabeth; ? it?s too dangerous. But
we must go as near it as possible, and climb
to the top when we can see our way.?
They wasted no time, but set up the
ladder at once and clambered out of the
pit. Their haste was such that none thought
of taking with them any of their belongings
until Elizabeth, at the last moment, re-
membered that there were no fruit-trees
where they were going. She collected all
the food that remained and handed it up
to her sisters, together with their kettle
and tin cups.
To Fangati was given the task of leading
the party through the woods. Their destina-
tion was a little hollow some distance away
on the reverse side of the precipice. It was
thickly covered with trees, and would afford
shelter for the rest of the night. As soon
as they dared they would climb to the
summit, a feat which in the darkness would
be hazardous in the extreme.
Fangati was an unerring guide, and a
quarter of an hour?s uphill walk brought them
to the wooded hollow. Elizabeth and Mary
each took an arm of the missionary to assist
him; indeed, Elizabeth felt the need of
support herself; her strength was nearly
exhausted. Not a word was spoken during
the journey. All ears were strained to


catch sounds from below. For a time they
heard nothing, but presently the cries of
the islanders came faintly on the air from
afar. These ceased before they reached
their shelter, and it seemed that the pursuit
was taking another direction.
They sank upon the ground beneath the
trees.
? Let us thank God for all His mercies,?
said the missionary, and in tones little
above a whisper, he uttered a few simple
words of gratitude and of entreaty for pro-
tection during the night.
? I am filled with amazement at my mar-
vellous deliverance,? he said to Elizabeth.
? I know Maku and Fangati, but who are
you, my dear young ladies, and how came
you upon this island ? Have you nobody
else with you ? But I am inconsiderate;
you must be very weary : doubtless you
will tell me all in the morning.?
?I am tired,? Elizabeth confessed; ?but
I could not sleep, and the joy of hearing an
English voice is greater than I can tell.?
There was a sob in her voice. Mary
clasped her hand.
? I will tell our story, Bess dear,? she said;
? lay your head in my lap and rest.?
So Mary quietly began to relate the story
of their voyage. As she casually mentioned
the name of the vessel the missionary in-
terrupted with an exclamation.


? The Elizabeth! Was her skipper
Captain Barton ? ?
? Yes,? said Mary in surprise. ? Did you
know Uncle Ben ? ?
? Know him I He was one of my oldest
friends. I met him in London a few days
before he sailed; indeed, he offered to bring
me back in his own vessel. He mentioned
that his nieces were accompanying him.
What has happened ? ?
Mary went on to tell of the wreck, the
landing on the island, and the simple outline
of their life since.
?Marvellous,? said the old man; ?and
my poor old friend I ?you saw nothing of
the raft ? ?
?Nothing. Do you think that there is
any chance at all that Uncle Ben was
saved ? ?
? I cannot tell. Strange things happen
in the providence of God. I see the hand of
God in your presence here; but for that I
should not have lived another day. We
can but trust that my old friend is safe.
He may be on one of these many islands.
I hope so.?
In answer to a question from Mary he
related how he had gone from London to
San Francisco, and sailed thence in an
American ship for the South Pacific. Having
made a tour of the mission-stations, he had
only reached his own island a few days


ago. He had been met on the shore by the
natives with every mark of welcome; the
absence of the chief was plausibly explained;
but the vessel had no sooner departed than
he was seized and tied up. He expected
instant death, but had been reserved for
sacrifice at the ceremonies in connection with
the inauguration of the new chief.
? Did they give you food ? ? asked
Tommy.
? Yes, my dear, or I should never have
had the strength to profit by your sister?s
brave deed. Do you know, when I heard
her voice, I thought it had been the voice
of an angel, speaking to me as the angel
spoke to St. Peter in prison. The remem-
brance of how the apostle was set free was
very cheering as I lay waiting for night.
Your sister has indeed been an angel of
deliverance. I thank God, who put courage
into her heart.?
They talked until the light of dawn stole
through the trees. Elizabeth had fallen
asleep. Without disturbing her the others
rose and went to the edge of the clump of
woodland, whence a considerable portion of
the island was visible. No savages were in
sight or hearing. They made a breakfast
of fruit, and when Elizabeth awoke, and
had eaten, they took their way with many
precautions up the steep ascent to the
summit of the precipice.


There grew upon it a few palm - trees,
which did not afford as good a screen as
the clump they had just left. On the other
hand it commanded a wider outlook over
the sea. They hoped that the savages,
failing to discover them, would eventually
return to their island. Only when they
saw the canoes departing would it be safe
to venture down again.
Their situation gave them much anxiety.
Their stock of food was small, and they had
now another mouth to feed. Already they
felt the lack of water. The stream that
flowed near the pit and plunged down over
the waterfall w r as too far distant for them
to attempt to visit it; and while the savages
were on the island the still longer journey
to the stream near the site of their original
hut was out of the question. They hoped
with all their heart that the intruders would
soon depart./
But this hope died as the day wore on.
From time to time they heard shouts, now
distant, now nearer at hand. Clearly the
men were searching for them. Once they
were greatly alarmed when they caught sight
of dusky figures crossing the open ground
below their recent settlement, and knew by
their shouts and gestures that they had
discovered traces of habitation. The natives
had indeed already come upon the pit and
searched it. By good fortune they had


followed the tracks down to the shore in-
stead of up into the higher ground. They
scoured the copse in which the boat and
canoe had been placed, and on discovering
them hastened along the shore in both
directions. No doubt it was only the ap-
parent inaccessibility of the precipice that
prevented them from suspecting that as the
fugitives? place of refuge.
The day passed. The little party lay in
the shade of the trees, and kept as still as
possible; but they were much distressed by
heat and thirst, and at the fall of night
the girls felt thoroughly worn out. Mr.
Corke, the missionary, arranged that they
should sleep through the night, while he and
the two natives kept watch.
Elizabeth was very unwilling that this
task should be undergone by the old man;
but he assured her that he was very tough,
and had quite recovered from the effects
of confinement, owing to the fortunate
circumstance that the islanders had not
deprived him of food.
When the next morning broke, and the
girls, feeling weak and ill, rose from their
hard couches, they were amazed to discover
that Mr. Corke was no longer with them.
? Where is he ? ? asked Elizabeth anxiously.
?He go fetch water,? said Maku. ?He
say mus? have water, so he go down all-
same fetch some.?


? Why did you let him ? Why didn?t
you wake us ? ? cried Elizabeth in great
distress.
?He say mus? go,? persisted the old
chief. ?He say you do lot fo? he, he do
little t?ing fo? you.?
Tommy ran to the edge of the plantation
to look for the missionary. Her sisters
heard her give a low cry, and next moment
she came running back to them, her eyes
ablaze with excitement.
? A ship I A ship I ? she cried.
The startling news was almost overwhelm-
ing. For a moment the girls stood as though
rooted to the ground, then they rushed
forward, following Tommy, who had already
darted back towards the edge. Their hearts
leapt within them as they saw, far out at
sea, a line of black smoke, and beneath it
the low hull of a steamer.
? Is she coming this way ? ? said Mary
anxiously.
? Oh, Ido hope so,? said Elizabeth. ?We
must make a signal. Let us tie our hand-
kerchiefs together; Fangati can climb one
of the trees with it.?
In a few moments Fangati had climbed a
tall stem, and tied the three knotted hand-
kerchiefs to a branch projecting towards the
sea. Then the girls remembered Mr. Corke,
whom in their momentary excitement they
had forgotten. There was no sound from


below; the natives had certainly not yet
seen him, or shouts would have announced
their delight.
But his continued absence made the girls
ache with dread.
They w r atched the steamer eagerly; the
hull w r as enlarging; it was approaching
rapidly; it was heading straight for the
island. The signal had apparently been
seen. But there was still no sign of the
missionary.
When the vessel was about half-a-mile from
the shore its motion ceased.
? They are afraid to come closer because
of the rocks,? said Mary. ? Look, they?re
lowering a boat.?
But at this moment their attention w r as
withdrawn from the steamer by startling
sounds from below loud, fierce shouts
mingled with the report of fire-arms.
? Oh 1 I?m afraid they?ve caught him,?
exclaimed Elizabeth, clasping her hands in
distress.
They ran along the edge of the precipice
to a spot where they had a better view of
the open ground from the cove to the site
of their huts. The din was increasing in
volume and fury, but as yet nothing could
be seen. Suddenly, from beyond the jut-
ting edge of a crag, they saw the missionary
running with all his might, not towards
them, but towards the sea. The girls won-


dered at this, for he could not have caught
sight of the steamer, owing to the trees.
It dawned on them afterwards that the
chivalrous old man, in his care for them,
was leading the pursuers away from their
hiding-place. . , ,
Quivering with apprehension they watched
the runner. Presently, less than a hundred
yards behind him, a horde of savages burst
into view, uttering frantic yells, as they
leapt after their expected victim. For some
moments he disappeared from the view of
the anxious spectators on the precipice,
hidden by the intervening trees. Then he
emerged again; he was still running at a
speed amazing in a man of his years. What
would be the end of the race ? The pur-
suers were gaining on him; they were hard
at his heels: it seemed impossible that he
should not be overtaken.
He was now upon the beach. A few
yards of sand separated him from the sea.
He stumbled, recovered himself, dashed on
again, and to the girls? horror plunged into
the water. The terrifying image of hungry
sharks rose in their minds. Several of the
pursuers halted and levelled their guns at
the swimmer, others plunged in after him,
evidently determined not to be baulked of
their prey.
All this time the attention of the girls
had been divided between this scene on


the shore and the steamer?s boat, which
was rapidly approaching. They could not
tell whether it had been seen either by the
pursuers or the fugitive. They watched in
breathless excitement. The boat was draw-
ing nearer to the swimmer, but the foremost
of the savages was nearer still. Suddenly
there was a flash and a puff of smoke from
the boat, followed by a report. The brown
men stopped: there was a moment?s hesita-
tion, then they were seen striking out vigor-
ously for the shore.
? Saved ! Saved I ? cried Tommy, dancing
for joy. ? Oh, let?s go and meet them, Bess.?
? Better wait, dear,? said Elizabeth, whose
lips were quivering. ? Let them drive the
savages away first.?
In tense excitement they watched the
missionary lifted into the boat. It was too
far distant as yet for them to distinguish its
occupants. As soon as the missionary was
aboard the sailors dipped their oars again
and pulled lustily for the shore. The girls
strained their eyes. The newcomers might
be Dutch, French, English, or American ;
they were white men; the long captivity
was ended.
The boat had almost reached the beach.
Suddenly Tommy gave a scream, and
clutched at Mary?s arm.
? It?s Uncle Ben I It?s Uncle Ben I ? she
cried.


CHAPTER XXIII
THE HOME-COMING
Who can describe the happiness of friends
long parted when they meet again ! As
there is a grief too deep for tears, so there is
a joy too intense for words to Let
the reader picture to herself the meeting of
uncle and nieces, the sober satisfaction of
Mr. Purvis, the ecstasy of little Dan W hiddon,
the jolly faces of Long Jimmy, Sunny Pat
and the rest.
Uncle Ben?s story was a simple and natural
one. He had no sooner launched the raft
with all his crew on board, than the Elizabeth
went down with a gurgle and was seen no
more. The raft drifted about for days at
the mercy of every current, until it was
sighted by a merchant brig. The castaways
were picked up, but in spite of Captain
Barton?s entreaties the skipper would not
alter his course to search for the girls. He
was bound for San Francisco with a perish-
able cargo, and declared that he could not
waste time and money scouring the South
Pacific for any females, even were they
princesses or queens.
307


At San Francisco Captain Barton char-
tered a steamer. He never spoke of the pang
this must have cost him. Those who knew
the old man guessed how bitterly he felt
the necessity, at the close of his career, of
thus tacitly admitting the superiority of
steam over sails.
The steamer had made for Maku?s island,
Captain Barton hoping to enlist the services
of Mr. Corke and the people in the search
for his nieces. Learning on his arrival that
Maku had disappeared, and that the mission-
ary had been carried away to the sacred
island, he at once started to rescue his
friend. He was distressed at the inter-
ruption of his primary quest, but when
Mr. Corke?s whereabouts was a certainty,
while his nieces? very existence was doubtful,
he felt that the nearer duty must be accom-
plished first. His delight at being able to
rescue the girls, his friend, and the old chief
at the same time may be imagined.
His action on the island was summary.
On learning the state of affairs, he sent the
steamer along the shore to the spot where
the native canoes were beached, drove off
the infuriated natives with a warning shot
from his brass gun, and had the canoes towed
out to sea. He said he did not hold with
revolutions, and meant to reinstate Maku in
his old chiefdom. Since those of his dis-
affected subjects who had come to the island


were the mystery men and their principal
supporters, he decided to leave them there
with their new chief, having learnt that
they would have no difficulty in finding sus-
tenance. He would carry back Maku and
Fancrati with the missionary to their island,
and to ensure that they should not be
molested by the revolutionaries he deter-
mined to take the canoes in tow, and so
leave them "without the means of crossing
the sea.
The girls left the scene of their adventures
without regret. Looking back upon their
life there, they acknowledged that it had
been on the whole happy, and their terrors
seemed trifling now that they were free from
them. Tommy did not fail to seek for hex
parrot, which she found disconsolate in the
boat, and which, she declared, spoke to her
for the first and last time in its life when
she took it up and perched it on her shoulder.
She was very reluctant to part with Fangati,
and tried to persuade her uncle to take her
back to England with them; but the old
man assured her that the girl was happier
in her own land, and put an end to the
subsequent discussion with one of his crusted
aphorisms.
There is a little town in Surrey which,
though not far from London, preserves a
good deal of the charm of the country. Its


roads are shaded with unlopped trees; its
houses lie amid pleasant gardens; and being
away from the main routes it is not
devastated by motor cars.
In the front garden of one of the houses
rises a tall white mast, complete with yards
and halyards. Over the entrance stands
the model of a full-rigged barque. In the
hall a white parrot spends a placid but noisy
existence. These emblems of the nautical
life are confined to the front of the house;
at the back there is a tennis lawn, a well-
kept flower garden, with glass-houses, and
an orchard.
Captain Barton was advised to take this
house by his lawyer, who wished to let it
for a client. A tramp through Deptford
and Rotherhithe soon convinced him that,
however well suited those riverside suburbs
may have been to seafaring men in the days
of Queen Bess, they did not offer much
attraction nowadays to a retired mariner
with three nieces. And having assured him-
self that the country town in question had
an excellent high school for girls, with a
practising school attached, he followed his
lawyer?s advice?for once in a way, as he said.
Elizabeth keeps house for him, spending
a good deal of time in the garden. She is
assisted there by Dan Whiddon, who does
not grow very fast, although the Captain
makes him climb the mast once a day for


the sake o! stretching his limbs. Mary is
learning how to teach, and Tommy is in the
fifth form at school, champion in tennis,
and a dashing forward in the hockey team.
Her first reports made her uncle screw up
his mouth, and rub his bald pate, and ask
Elizabeth what on earth was to be done with
a minx like that. 44 Has good abilities, but
lacks application,? he quoted. ? Much too
talkative. Has lost too many conduct
marks this term.? Elizabeth begged him
to be patient, assuring him that Tommy
would turn out quite well in time. And as
the same mistresses who penned the above
remarks are all wonderfully fond of Tommy,
and she is the most popular girl in the
school, it is evident that she has at least
one most enviable quality, the power of
winning friends.
A visitor often comes to the house, at
whose appearance Captain Barton retires
to his den and grumps and growls over his
beloved pipe. The young electrical engineer
whom the girls had met in Valparaiso 'will
certainly get on in the world, if dogged
persistence has its reward. Though they
had then been unable to give him any
address, and had held no communication
with him since, they had not been settled
more than a week before he called. ? The
impudence of the fellow 1? said Captain
Barton inwardly, when Elizabeth introduced


the visitor. Through the wreaths of smoke
from his pipe the worthy Captain sees
visions of Elizabeth keeping house for some
one else, and the poor man, I fear it must
be confessed, is jealous. Tommy looks on
with a humorous twinkle in her eye.
? Poor old Nunky ! ? she thinks. ? He?s
wondering what in the world he?ll do when
Bess is married, and Mary?s away teaching,
and he?s left to the tender mercies of Me! ?
But I have watched many girls in my
time, and I shouldn?t be at all surprised if
Tommy?she will have her hair up and be
Miss Katherine Westmacott then?-develops
into a very capable housekeeper. She will
certainly be what an old lady friend of mine
calls ? a bit of sunshine in the home.?
