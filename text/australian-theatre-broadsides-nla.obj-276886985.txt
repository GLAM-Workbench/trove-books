There are two violet farms in the
United States, both managed entirely by

Some of the tribes of India lave a
marriage custom which calls for the
presence of a cow and a calf at the
ceremony. The principals and the priest
drive a cow and calf into the water, and
there the bride and groom, as well as the
clergyman, clutch the cow’s tail, while
the officiating personage pours water upon
it from a glass vessel, and utters a
religious formula. The couple are now
united in wedlock ; and the priest, for his
part in the ceremony, claims the animals,
and also receives any sum in money which
the groom thinks is necessary to pro-
pitiate the idols.

As to what Tobacco to smoke, just make
a note of tbe following facts:—SIGNET
TOBACCO is the best Tobacco manufactured.
It is made in plugs, DARK and LIGHT.
The DARK is full flavored, and the favorite
among veteran smokers. The LIGHT is
milder, and much patronised by those
who enjoy their evening pipe. Both DARK
and LIGHT are manufactured from the
he. t Virginian Tobacco, and can be obtained
from all Tobacconists and Storekeepers.
We strongly advise you to try it.

Curling tongs dry the hair by removing
the natural oil, and crimping the hair
over hot iron sooner or later causes it to
crack and break. This is not a matter of
so great importance in young girls, whose
hair will grow again, but in the case of
older women, in whom the hair is
beginning to thin out, it is apt to hasten
the fall of what remains and to cause
partial baldness over the forehead and
temples.

publisher, the late Mr. J. P. Lippincott,
was visiting her, he ventured, in the
course of a very friendly conversation, to
ask her how she came to know so much
about clubs, camp life, barracks, gambling-
houses, and other places which are only
visited by men. She placed her hands
upon her knees, and, looking straight at
her questioner, saucily said, “It is none
of your business.’'

play the train out of the station, and for
a time the “fares” were actually entered

Bronchitis Cured.
IDoctors fail, but Dr. Williams 5 Pink Pills Triumph.
F'Z?5 The present season is a dangerous one for all whose lungs are weak,
for lung troubles (unless treated properly in time) develop into Bronchitis,
which may end fatally. Mr. McCann’s lung weakness became bronchitis,
and his cure by Dr. Williams’ Pint Pills is, to him, a marvellous one. He
recently said to a reporter :— •* Some
time ago I sank Into a low, feverish
state, perhaps the result of a neglected
cold. I turned against my food, and I
could never sleep at night properly,
though I dozed heavily in the day. I
got weaker every day and had to give up
work of any kind. I grew most aston-
ishingly thin and as pale as death. My
friends said I looked like a dead man
trying to walk. At last the doctor said
my lungs were affected. He said I had
bronchitis, and that unless I got over my
weakness and debility, it would get
such a hold on me that I should never
throw it off. But his medicines couldn’t
give me the least appetite,and I continued fading away day by day. I was In-
deed a hopeless case, and my chances of recovery seemed very remote. Then a
friend asked me to read an account of a cure which he pointed out to me in
a newspaper. The case seemed even, worse than mine, and yet Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills had saved that person’s life. I could hardly believe
it, but after satisfying myself as to the truth of the paragraph, I sent for
six boxes of the pills. As I told you before, their effect was wonderful , and
it didn’t quite take the six boxes to put me on my feet again, entirely cared.
From the first day I started the pills I began to get better ; they gave me
an appetite and enabled me to sleep, thus permitting nature a free hand to
throw off the disease. My gratitude at my recovery is indeed great, and I
have pleasure in authorising the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co. to publish my
remarks wherever they deem fit. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are truly
wonderful, and they pulled me through when I was in, a very perilous state,
and when no other medicine was of any service .” Mr. McCann’s address is

hadn’t been for her perverseness.”
“ Why, how was that ? ”
“ She was very sick, and her husband,

fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this way:
If the Prince of Wales should go to
America and pass through Washington
without stopping to call on father, we’d
think it darned queer, an’ so I thought
I’d stop over here a few days and pay my
respects to the Queen.” —“New York Star.’

Story uf a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his wife
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich*—attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as to be included in
a reportorial description the following day
in the®chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”

When Henii Rochefort escaped from
Ne \v Caledonia the news of his landing at
Sydney was conveyed to Marshal
M’Mahon by D’Harcourt, who was
generally supposed to be the real Pre-
sident of the French Republic. The
marshal, much concerned by this news,,
said; —“ This is very serious ; we must
telegraph at once to the United States
Government and see if extradition
cannot be obtained.” The faithful
vicomte whispered to his master “ But,
Monsieur le Marechal, Sydney is not in
the United States; it is in Australia.”
Whereupon the marshal, whose know-
ledge of geography had never been very
extensive, threw up his arms and
exclaimed, in admiration:—“That devil'
of a Harcourt, he knows everything.”
