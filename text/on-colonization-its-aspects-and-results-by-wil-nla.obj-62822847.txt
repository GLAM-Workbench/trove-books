ON COLONIZATION:
ITS ASPECTS EBB.ULTS,
WILLIAM STONES, Esq.
A PAPER READ BEFORE THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, MAY sth, 1865.
(Reprinted for gratuitous distribution from the Journal of the Society of Arts, by James Tennant, Mineralogist to Her Majesty, Professor
of Mineralogy and Geology in King's College, Ac.. 149, Strand, W.C,
Having had the honour, a few years ago, of submitting
to this Society a short notice of the colony of New Zea-
land, which led the way, I believe, to the reading of
several very interesting papers treating of the colonies of
Canada, the Cape of Good Hope, Mauritius, and a most
important contribution by Dr. Forbes Watson on Indian
matters, it has occurred to me that the Society might
follow up the subject, and advantageously occupy an
evening in the discussion of several topics not apper-
taining to any one colony in particular, but in connection
with colonisation generally.
The short time at our command, and the space in the
Journal to which I am limited, compel me to suppress
several subjects possessing some interest, and, therefore, I
pass over all reference to the different forms of ancient
and modern colonisation?the aspect of colonisation in its
relation to the religious institutions of England?to our
literature?to English amusements ?to the important
question of the effects of colonisation on other races,
whether slavery, extermination, or incorporation?and,
lastly, to another interesting subject, the peculiar genius
of Englishmen for colonising. All these on the present
occasion must be omitted.
Limiting our views to the British colonies and de-
pendencies, we may notice their number, situation, and
climate. Stretching almost entirely round the globe ?ex-
tending from the nearest habitable land to the north
pole, through the tropics to the Falkland Islands and New
Zealand in the southern hemisphere, every variety of
climate, position, and production is included within the
limits of the British Dominions,
Parts of all the great continents are held by Great
Britain?as Canada, in North America; Honduras and
British Guiana, in South America. In Africa, besides
the stations of the Gambia, Gold Coast, and Sierra Leone,
we have the colonies proper of the Cape of Good Hope
and Natal. By our magnificent Indian Empire, Singa-
pore, and the treaty ports of China, Asia is, to a great
extent, brought under British control; while the whole
continent of Australia (and I presume it may take rank
as one of the five great powers) is entirely under British
government. On the Continent of Europe, after all our
wars and expenditure, we retain but one little spot?the
coveted stronghold of Gibraltar, the key of the Mediter-
ranean,
As a seafaring insular people, it might be supposed
that we should have a natural bias or inclination to form
settlements on islands; and beginning from Heligoland
and the Channel Islands at our own doors, we shall find,
if we trace along the subjoined sketch map, islands with-
out number hoisting the British flag.
We note Newfoundland, Prince Edward?s Island,
the Bermudas, Bahamas, the West India group, Falk-
land Islands, St. Helena, Mauritius, Ceylon, Singapore,
Hong Kong, a station in Labuan, Van Dieman?s Land,
and the cluster of islands known as the colony of
New Zealand, and, lastly, Vancouver?s Island?and
Malta, in the Mediterranean ; but it is quite beyond my
power to accurately reckon the number of islands claimed
by England, as many of those I have named include
several small satellites under their government.
Not less various are the climates ?Canada, with its
six months of frost, snow, and ice, massive, grand, and
solemn in its features, bracing and exhilirating to her hardy


inhabitants; the seething plains of India, suggesting dis- to British rule. We can only mention the French in
ease of liver, brevity of life, and quickness of fortune ; the
milder climate of Australia, where health is so good that
doctors find small encouragement, and frost is little
seen or felt; the clearness of the Cape, where twenty oxen,
slowly toiling, drag the farmer?s waggon over the sandy
soil, baking, broiling, dry, yet healthy; or the foggy coasts
of Newfoundland. And here we may call attention to
the difference which exists in climate between the two
t
coasts of North America. The isothermal line of 50 deg.
Fahrenheit enters the German Ocean in about 53 degrees
north; it reaches its highest point in the British Isles,
where it touches the parallel of 54 deg. north; after this
it bends southward, until, on entering the American con-
tinent, it descends to the low latitude of 40 deg. north.
In its course across America its-deflection is on the
whole northerly, and on the eastern side it again reaches
to 54 deg. north.
The eastern sides of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans
are warmer, and the western sides colder, than is due to
latitude merely. This fact was noticed by Captain Cook,
and is owing to the cold polar waters washing the coast
of Canada and China, while the warm streams from the
tropics flow on to the coasts of England and Norway in
the eastern hemisphere, and Vancouver?s Island and
British Columbia on the west coast of America. Hence,
British Columbia and Vancouver?s Island have much
milder winters than places in Canada under the same
parallel of latitude.
Rivers. ?Some of the colonies and dependencies have
large rivers, as the St. Lawrence, whose vast watercourse
forms the great outlet of the magnificent chain of lakes
or inland seas of North America. India, with its sacred
mythical rivers, carrying us in thought back beyond the
reach of authentic history; and the islands of New Zea-
land, which are pierced in every direction by numerous
navigable streams. On the other hand, some of our
largest colonies are almost totally deficient of rivers, as
those on the great continent of Australia, in which rail-
ways must be relied upon to provide inland carriage.
Of harbours, we may boast the unrivalled Halifax and
Sydney?one in each hemisphere?only perhaps exceeded
in beauty by that of Bio de Janeiro.
Productions. ?We shall hereafter refer to the variety
of productions more in detail, suffice now to say that, in
1862, Canada sent us timber to the value of �1,237,689 ?
that upwards of 21J millions of sheep grew wool for us in
Australia and New Zealand; and our own colonies of
Australia and Vancouver?s Island produced �8,000,000
of gold; while, of colonial sugar, we imported to the
value of upwards of two millions.
Variety of Population, Religions, and Laws. ?From the
circumstance of so many of our colonies having been
acquired by conquest, it almost necessarily follows that
wo must have a many-toned and hued population subject
Canada and the Mauritius, Dutch at the Cape, African
blacks in the West Indies and in Africa, Hindoos, Chinese,
Malays, Australians, New Zealanders. Nor are the reli-
gions less diverse ?Protestant, Catholic, Mahomedan,
Hindoo, Parsee, savages who believe in wood and stone
images, and savages who have hardly risen to any idea of
a God at all. Equally various are the systems of law in
force?British law, Code Napoleon, local laws, and heathen
customs, so long as they are not repugnant to good citizen-
ship, are left tolerably free to their own workings.
Amongst all these varied peoples, tongues, colours, cus-
toms, and habits, British rule has, we believe, resulted in
two profound convictions and enjoyments?a sense of per-
fect protection of person and property, and freedom of
thought and action.
Acquisition. ?lnspection of the accompanying table
will at once show the very varying modes in which this
country has obtained its colonies and dependencies. The
column ? mode of acquisition ? testifies to many a hard-
fought battle by sea and land. The tale of Wolfe?s battle
of the Heights of Abraham, or the attack and siege of
Gibraltar, cannot be read at this distance of time without
feelings of glowing pride. Every West India island has
its tale of courageous attack or sagacious defence. And
those which tell of less warlike deeds are not without
their interest from another point of view. We owe our
acquaintance with them to the privations, patient endur
ance, skill, energy, and genius of such bold, self-reliant
men as Cook, who, in vessels not larger than a moderate-
sized yacht (the Investigator we all recollect lying ofi our
hall of meeting until within the last few years, doing
good service in her last days in the humble form of a
Thames Police-station), sailed into unknown seas at the
Antipodes, tracked and surveyed the strange coasts, return-
ing home with important results, and contributing largely
to the geographical and scientific knowledge, and high
moral position of his native country. So judiciously did
he conduct his explorations and communications with
savage tribes that his name is still remembered in the
South Seas as the introducer of various animals and vege-
tables with which the people were previously unacquainted,
and the name of Cook is revered as their kind and cour-
teous benefactor. No one ever heard in those regions a
whisper against his fair fame.
Social Aspects.
Few rich people emigrate; few with a good com-
mercial opening before them leave the land of then-
birth. Strivers amongst the middle classes, younger sons,
poor and labouring men, principally the latter, are the
classes of which emigrants principally are and should
be composed?men with restriction of field at home and
small margin between income and necessary expenditure.
The two aspects of colonisation from a social point of
view, which I wish prominently to bring before you, are?


Ist. The direct benefit to the emigrant; and 2nd. The was done by manual labour, one man was almost as good
indirect benefit to the home-stayer.
The Emigrant. ?A competent workman no sooner
arrives in any of the colonies than he finds ready and full
employment at w T ages which, if economical and provident
in his habits, leave him a large margin between income
and outgoings. Taking the agricultural as the lowest
type and worst paid of English workmen, the farm
labourer on reaching a colony obtains for his work both
money payment and ample rations, the former alone
generally averaging more than his total highest remunera-
tion at home. He is thus at once relieved from all care
on the subject of procuring food. Meat, which in England
he tasted perhaps once a week only, he now has every
day, and three times a day if he likes; and the weekly
wages, which in England had to provide him with food,
housing, and clothes, can now be devoted to the purchase
of luxuries, or, if prudent, by saving a portion of his
income for a time, he can soon reach a position enabling
him either to buy a small plot of land for himself, which
he can always obtain for a few shillings per acre, or to
join in the renting of a sheep-run on shares, thus laying
the foundation of a fortune. A few years of more or less
rude success, during which the emigrant has learnt self-
reliance, and he, who would probably have passed his life
at home as a mechanic, or, perchance, risen to the dignity
of a foreman, and unless by special fortune never attained
to any social or political importance, perhaps never pos-
sessed a vote, becomes in the colony a person of means,
can afford to purchase a good house, good furniture, to
live well, even luxuriously, is entitled to vote for local
officials and the legislature, enters into the discussion of
public matters, and gradually comes to have an opinion
of his own, which he enunciates in the press or in speeches
at public meetings, and every little place has its news-
paper, in which argumentative colonists carry on their
discussions. These discussions determine his choice of
a member for the legislature, if himself desirous of re-
maining a simple citizen, but if ambitious, he feels that
no impediment exists to his becoming a legislator himself.
With character and sufficient education he may succeed in
leading a local assembly, but if limited in his oratorical
powers he must be content to be a silent member, though
not the less useful. Thus men, whose whole life would
probably have been restricted to the questions of daily
wages and the propriety of strikes, or a low murmur about
their exclusion from electoral rights, gradually open their
minds to questions of revenue, taxation, political freedom,
colonial rights, exploration, harbours, fisheries, boundaries,
settlements, education, the improvement of estates, and
the general public good. These briefly are some of the
advantages which accrue to those who emigrate.
Home-stayers. ?The advantages to those who remain
at home are numerous, although apparently less direct.
First, there is the withdrawal of a large per-centage of
competitors from the labour market. The law of supply
and demand obtains, in the case of labour, as in that of
other commodities. If a given number of employers have
need for, say nine men, and ten workmen apply for the
work, the employer will reduce the wages of all the nine
required to the lowest possible amount; the labourers, in
fact, compete with one another as to which one shall be
left out of work; but if the employers have work for nine
men, and only eight are obtainable, the employers com-
pete with one another for the services of the men by
offering inducements, generally in the form of increasing
their wages. Hence, the importance of emigration, from
a labourer's point of view?transferring the competition
from the shoulders of the workman to those of the
master. That this has been the case during the last ten
or fifteen years will be evident, if we investigate the pre-
sent rate of agricultural wages, and compare it with the
rate which prevailed at the former period. I am aware
that another cause besides emigration has been operating
in the direction to raise wages ?I refer to'tho introduction
of machinery into agricultural pursuits. When threshing
as another, but the man who can drive, stoke, or feed a
threshing-machine is no longer a common labourer, but a
skilled workman; and unless his wages be raised above
those of a mere labourer he will speedly seek some other
engagement?his intelligence, his mind, must be paid for.
With a diminution of demand, fewer permanent hands
being now required upon farms, the great reason for wages
being higher at the present time than formerly, can only
be from the fact of large draughts of men having been
enticed from England by the prospect opening to them in
our colonies, and by that means withdrawn from the
home-labour market.

From Mr. Morion?s paper, read before this Society on
Bth December, 1859, it appears that the wages of agricul-
tural labourers throughout Great Britain have risen, on
an average, about 20 per cent, between the years 184 9
and 1859. All this proves, says Mr, Morton, that the
labouring force in agriculture is better paid than it
used to be, and that the enormous extension of machinery
and of steam power lately has not been to the injury of the
farm labourer.
Not only have wages been largely improved by
emigration, but there is another point of influence
upon social life which must not pass without mention.
Speak to a person in whatever sphere of life we may,
it will be almost instantly ascertained that a brother,
sister, relative, or intimate friend is settled in some
distant colony; and with such emigrants the dwellers
at home keep up a correspondence more or less regular,
bringing about a knowledge of the world and its varying
interests vastly different from that which obtained only a
few years ago, when it was not unusual to meet with per-
sons whose geographical knowledge was bounded by the
limits of their native village or town. I speak a fact
when I say that within the last twenty years I have
myself conversed with a country resident, the'proprietor
of the farm he cultivated, who, living within 25 miles of
a railway and a seaport, to which steamers were running
daily, had never seen either a railway, a locomotive, or a
steam-vessel, and all my attempts at explanation utterly
broke down when I found that his utmost idea of a steam
vessel?s mode of propulsion was by sweeps, as he termed
them, similar, as he supposed, to the small oars of a boat
on the mill pond. The views of the world which the
emigrant obtains are scarcely less different than the
expansion which is taking place in the minds of the homo
stayers on the great interests which affect our country.
Further, every man who emigrates may be said to support
one at home, by becoming a purchaser of English manufac-
tured goods, and thus are the home-stayers benefited ; to
how large an extent will be more apparent when we have
treated of the commercial results of our colonies. In
fine, the physical, moral, and social condition of both
these two great parties to which we have referred is
rapidly changing and, I believe, improving. Two little
incidents which, from their coming under my own notice,
I may relate as bearing on this part of the subject. In
the depth of a bitter winter, a group of labouring men
were huddling round an inn fire, at which they were
kindly permitted by the host to warm themselves, and, on

inquiring as to the cause of so many able-bodied men desirous of my opinion on the subject of his emigrating,
lounging about, I was informed that they could not get From his somewhat worn aspect and the aroma of strong
work, and were not allowed to go into the Union until
they had been out of employment six weeks. They
added that there were forty men in the like distress in
that parish, a purely agricultural one, the coveted wages
when in full work, for which they were so anxious, being
some Bs. per week. Incendiary fires were frequent that
autumn and winter ; if my memory serves me correctly,
eight were counted in my evening walks during one and
the same week. Is it not appalling to reflect upon such a
state of things ? Starving men burning abundance. In
my own mind, I have often contrasted this sad condition
of matters with the cheering prospects indicated in the
following simple tale, for the accuracy of which I also
vouch. When I was in one of our colonies, an Irish
emigrant once solicited me to write a letter for him to an
old friend at home, which I assented to do. ? Tell him,?
said he, that if he has not plenty of work to come out.
Tell him we came out safely and comfortably. Tell him,
sir, it is a beautiful country. Tell him there is plenty of
work hereand then he related various domestic pieces of
intelligence as to the increase of his family, &c. ?Well,?
said I, after penning all the subjects as he dictated them,
? anythingmore ?? Considering awhile, he said, ? Nothing,
your honour, thank ye;? but, recollecting himself, added,
? Oh, please, tell him there is plenty of pork and potatoes.?
A great truth lurks under this last sentence, for our physical
well-being is at the foundation of all civilization, science,
art, and the amenities of life.
Who should Emigrate.
This leads me to offer a few remarks on the great
question?Shall I emigrate ? Every person falls into
one of two classes, desirable or dead-weights. Men
with families, likely to settle down permanently and
become the backbone of the colonies, are desirable,
and if possessed of moderate capital, so much the
better. Very desirable colonists are those working men
who have a sound knowledge of some handicraft, as
bricklayers, carpenters, masons, blacksmiths. Farm la-
bourers, shepherds, are also valuable; and subordinate to
these, all men enjoying good health, and able to do a
hard day?s work of any rough kind. Of the female class
we should like a supply of country domestic servants!
and handy lasses, knowing how to milk, wash, and iron,
boil a potato, make a pudding, and roast a joint. To
such we should be quite willing to give high wages
as long as we could keep them from the allurements of
some prosperous mechanic or successful farmer. Speaking
as a colonist, I may say there are whole groups of people
we do not want and would much rather be without. Of
professional men we have more than enough. Legal men
are so abundant at home, and the chances of great success
so uncertain and rare, that no wonder the overflowings of
the profession seek to obtain advantage of every opening
possible in the colonies. Again, when it is remembered
that every emigrant vessel must carry a surgeon, it will
at once be seen how superabundant must be the members
of that profession in some of the colonies. 40,000 emi-
grants go to Australia every year, conveyed in 160 or 200
ships, and as many of the surgeons do not return, but
remain in the colonies, we may form some idea of the
yearly addition to the medical branch of the community.
The needlewomen, the sempstress class, are not of value to
us; accustomed to town life, weak, feeble, unenergetic, not
used to domestic work, they find little occupation, and
are a burthen to us. For young men who have not learnt
a trade, men of the pen only, we have but little room ;
there is always a large supply on hand, and as living is
comparatively dearer than at home, they are the .most
placed of any class in the colonies.
They know no trade or handicraft, and are, as a rule, phy-
sically unable to do laborious work, and therefore are far
worse otf than the commonest unskilled labourer. One
morning, not long ago, a young man called upon me with
a note of introduction, and informed me that he was
tobacco which environed him, I was rather puzzled how
to advise him, and therefore requested him to state his
own views, projects, and ideas, so that I might confirm
his plans or suggest some deviation. Judge my astonish-
ment when I heard his first question, ? What hats would
you advise me to take?? ?To sell?? said I. ?Oh, no;
to wear.? Without meaning a pun or inuendo, I could
not avoid saying, ? A wide-a-wake.? I need scarcely
add, that young gentlemen who are very particular about
the sort of hat they should wear, we do not much require.
Commercial Aspects and Results.
It is worthy of note that for the supply of the staples
of our principal manufactures we, at the present time,
mainly rely upon our own colonies and dependencies. The
following very brief reference to a few of the principal
items may suggest rather than fully demonstrate the
extent of our transactions in this respect:?
Timber. ?For timber we largely resort to Canada, New
Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, whence we imported, in 1862,
no less than to the value of upwards of three millions
sterling. Mahogany is obtained from Honduras, and teak
we obtain from our Indian possessions.
Cotton. ?The cultivation of cotton has so far progressed
in our own dominions, more especially since the war in
the United States, that the import value in 1862 from
purely British possessions, was no less than eleven millions
sterling.
Wool.? Nor the important staple of our wool manu-
factures we now, to a very great extent, depend upon the
vast pasture lands of Australia, the Cape of Good Hope,
and Natal; the total value of the wool produce of those
colonies being now estimated at �6,832,578 per annum.
Fish forms a large article of trade and export from some
of our North American colonies, to a greater extent than
most of us would suppose, viz., �1,450,000 yearly.
Sugar. ?We imported from our West India Islands,
the East Indies, and the Mauritius, to the value of nearly
�3,500,000.
Gold. ?All will recollect seeing in the Exhibition of
1862 the pyramid representing the mass of gold obtained
from Australia since the discovery of that precious metal
there in 1851. The pile represented many millions
sterling, more than ever came into the possession of
Croesus or the desire of Midas.
These most important and valuable items of our
colonial commerce are for the most part either the un-
assisted productions of nature, needing but the rudest
kind of labour to extract them from their sites, or prepare
them for the market, or otherwise requiring but the
simplest form of attention as sheep farming, and chiefly
depending upon the mild equable character of the climate
for successful and profitable results. Let me here call
attention to the following return of exports from our
colonies, extracted from the Board of Trade Returns for
1862 :

How are these mighty heaps of raw produce paid for by
the mother country ? Chiefly, if not entirely, by its
manufactures.
In a populous country only the most skilled workman
has at all any chance of success; the mere manual
labourer remains, as a rule, in his routine sphere of ever-
lasting grinding work; but in a new country the most
ordinary, least-skilled labourer rises into a condition of
hope, and by his largely-increased wages, can and does
become a great consumer of English manufactured goods.
As a general principle, it is cheaper and better for the
colonies to send home their raw materials to be prepared
by the skill, machinery, and appliances of England, and
re-import the manufactured goods, than attempt to work
up the raw material in the colonies. The abundance of
coal, the perfection of machinery, and the cheapness of
labour, all tend to secure this result in the most econo-
mical manner ; hence the wisest of the colonial govern-
ments look for their continued prosperity rather to the
still further development of their unexhausted, and, in
many cases, almost inexhaustible natural resources, than
to the introduction of manufactures.
The necessary revenue is generally raised by a moderate
import duty upon the principal articles of consumption,
by an export duty upon some articles of great production,
assisted by the proceeds of the sale of government waste
lands. A few of the colonial legislatures have unwisely
increased the import duty upon some articles, even more
with a view to protect their incipient manufactures than
for strictly revenue purposes, thereby artificially raising,
to the injury of all, the price of the highly-taxed article
for the benefit of the very few colonists who may enter
into the manufacture of the goods thus selected for special
taxation. This course is a great wrong to the body of
colonists and most injurious to the English manufacturers,
who help to pay the taxes?increased for the defence of
the colonies?and we plainly state to our colonial
friends that this short-sighted policy is bearing and will
bear bitter fruits for them in all discussions of colonial
questions. Not many have adopted a tariff of this kind,
and obviously such a course is contrary to the first principles
of political economy.
Disregarding these pernicious exceptions, we may say,
speaking generally, that in return for the raw materials
supplied by the colonies the mother country pays in
manufactured goods of all kinds. In proof of this we have
only to refer to the list of exports, from which it will be
seen what extensive customers our colonies annually are
to the mother country.
Exports of British and Irish Produce and
Manufactures.
The following is an account of the declared value of
British and Irish produce and manufactures exported
from the United Kingdom to each British possession in
the year 1864:
* The return for Gibraltar must, I should suppose, have some
mysterious connection with Spanish smuggling, or is it purely
as the depot of the Barbary States that it figures so high.

Several other points of commercial interest, deserve
a short notice in this review.
Ship-building. ?At the earlier period of our colonial
history, ships were small, their provisioning bad and
scanty, the water disgusting, voyages long and tedious.
As the number of emigrants increased, it became advisa-
ble to enlarge the size of the ships, which brought
another view into the consideration of the owners?the
shorter the passage the less provisions would be consumed,
and hence the shipowner came to have a direct interest
in lessening the duration of the passage to the lowest
possible period, as the value of every day?s provisions for
three or four hundred persons amounts to a considerable
sum. Hence sprang improvements in ship-building, and
increased attention to the routes, great circle sailing, and
observations of the trade winds, the best points for crossing
the line so as to avoid delay from calms, the importance
of making southing as fast as possible, to lessen the length
of the degrees of longitude, &c. As a rough approximate
rule, it may be taken that a ship of 400 tons register
would be 110 days making the passage to Australia, and
every increase of 100 tons in burden would decrease the
passage two days, or for each enlargment of 50 tons,
one day less in the passage may be reckoned; if this is
approximately correct, a vessel of 1500 tons register
would make the passage in 88 days.
The legal enactments for the provisioning both of poor
emigrants and sailors have tended very much to the
comfort of all; and whereas disease, particularly scurvy,
formerly destroyed large numbers of our seamen, we
seldom hear of a case of total or even serious attack of
that malady. So far from the long voyage being now
hurtful to the health of the emigrants, this generally
improves on the passage.?they have no pressing anxieties,
are well and regularly fed, breathe the fresh invigorating
sea air, and have an ever present medical attendant in
case of sickness.
Our prinicpal steam packet companies owe their
development to the necessities of our colonial intercourse
rather than to foreign trade. Nor ought we to omit
noticing the vast strides which steam ship-building has
taken, not only for the requirements of main ocean lines,
but in every part of the world. On local lines of traffic,
steam vessels built in the Thames, Mersey, and Clyde,
are daily coasting the shores of India, New Zealand, and
Australia, and the two widely separated coasts of British
North America, driven by men of English northern tongue;
some may be, like Albert Smith?s engineer, enduring and
fattening upon a grievance, but for the most part all
doing their duty honestly and thoroughly as Englishmen
should.
Banks and Monetary Interests. ?Another important
commercial interest is that connected with banking and
monetary affairs. Some of our most prosperous, banking

institutions have their principal seats or spheres of action 1 and profitable demand is for exportation to the colonies,
in our colonies and dependencies. Their uniformly sound j Steam machinery of every description, agricultural imple-
management causes them to furnish safe investments for
English capitalists, and the high rate of interest in the
colonies enables them to pay large dividends regularly.
From the columns of the Economist I have compiled the
following schedule, which, necessarily imperfect, as it
only includes those which have agencies or branches in
England, may illustrate rather than exhibit the vast
monetary interests which open fields for investment in
connection with our colonies. Some of the great loans
are guaranteed by the British Government, and the
money raised has generally been honestly applied to the
furtherance of the true interests of the colony.
(Want of space will only allow of the totals being
given.)
Grand Total.
Hence we have engagements for the great total of one
hundred and seventy-four millions sterling, invested
under the laws of our own country, and in many
instances guaranteed either by the Colonial or Indian
Governments, and in some crises by the Home Govern-
ment, yielding at an average, rate say of 7� per cent, per
annum, an income or profit 'to the investors of thirteen
millions, without fear of repudiation or revolution.
Postage, Telegraphs, Railways, ?The enormous dimen-
sions of our oversea postal system are largely owing to the
increase of population in our colonies. I would merely
remind you that in almost every day?s Times you may
read of vessels from the east or west with so many pas-
sengers and, without exaggeration, letters numbering up to
hundreds of boxes. These hundreds of boxes contain
thousands of messages of goodwill towards men?cheerful,
loving words from children to parents?remittances of
comfort to the old folks? 11 ?family gossips and the effusions
of affection borne on the waters from afar to many cottage
homes in the land.
Telegraphs either have been laid down, or are in
course of construction, from England to India, from
one colony of Australia to another thousands of
miles in length?from one end of New Zealand to the
other?and all through Canada. The gigantic efforts now
contemplated a second time to span tbe Atlantic by a
telegraphic cable, will if successful, connect the mother
country with the outlying picket, if I may so say, of her
American offspring. And while actually writing these
sentences a telegraphic message comes from Bombay to
London in a very few hours, and we have news from
Melbourne in 28 days.
A whole evening might be advantageously devoted to
the consideration of colonial railways?whether the Grand
Trunk Railway, with its colossal bridge, and although per-
haps bom before its time, the true type of a main line, some
1,200 miles in length, running through and serving a whole
country?or those spreading lines through every colony,
joining towns and districts and annihilating distance?or
those most important lines in India, enabling the produce
of the interior to reach the shipping ports at a small
charge, and, what is even more unexpected and astonish-
ing, breaking down the distinctions of caste, all castes
meeting on the common and neutral ground of the same
railway carriage. The preceding statement of outlay on
railways better expresses their importance than any ob-
servations our limits on this occasion will admit.
Machinery and the Fine Arts. ?For machinery of all
kinds our mechanical engineers find their most regular

ments, mill-work, guns, metal work, electro-metallurgy,
and work in the precious metals, jewellery, watches,
clocks, glass, and furniture of the more expensive kinds
all find their more or less prominent place in our colonial
export trade.
Transportation.
The objects of criminal treatment are twofold?
to secure the community by deterring the evil-dis-
posed, and to reform the fallen. In order to deter,
punishments should be uniform, moderate, and certain,
which unfortunately has not been the case with our
English system, in which punishment has been irregularly
and unequally inflicted in amount, and mosfuncertain in
duration. This aspect of punishment concerns the criminal
only so far as enabling him to speculate and rejoice at the
chance of immunity; it is within the power of the free
community to rectify these errors, and it is beyond our
province to enter into that discussion; our subject regards
transportation from the colonist?s point of view. Many of
our colonies were founded for penal purposes, and roads,
public buildings, important clearings, and a groat deal of
most useful rough work, have been constructed and accom-
plished by convicts, farmed out to the settlers, receiving
food and clothing in return for their labour, thus placing
the free colonists in the position of enjoying the results
of unpaid labour without the capital outlay for slaves.
As emigrants increase, and colonies obtain the advantages
of the competition of free labour, it is obvious that not
only is the stigma of convictism disagreeable, but the free
community of labourers will object to the presence of com-
petitors of the tainted class. If, then, the colonies will
not have our convicts, we must either let them loose at
home under some sort of control, or keep them in confine-
ment. Tickets of leave, in an old country, are sources
of unmitigated evil, both to the free workman and the
convict; if a convict is accepted to his prejudice, the
former infers that virtue goes for nothing with employers,
? and those who may be required to work with ticket-of-
leave men must either give up their employment or lower
their tone of morals by associating at the same bench with
convicted thieves and murderers. The convict also finds
himself exposed to such a terrific competition that he
seldom succeeds, and generally returns to his old courses.
Must we, then, shut them up within four walls, with no
society but that of their own sex, hardening and brutalising
their already degraded being??a treatment certainly
not in accordance with man?s nature, or the laws which
are stamped upon the universe. By allowing a criminal
to obtain a reduction of his term as the result of a seem-
ing religious change, the doorway was opened to his being
again let loose upon society, and this tempted him to be-
come a hypocrite. The tendency of recently-improved
legislation is to make him a suicide or a maniac. What
hope can any man have who is doomed to be immured
within prison walls for ten long years? It is a living death,
or worse; and one of the most humanising instincts of man
?the family?is altogether lost sight of. What do you
propose to do with their wives? Will you release these
wretched women from their marriage ties ? And although
a rigid law may say it has nothing to do with that, the in-
stinct of nature echoing the law of God has something to
do with this matter. As, then, man within four stone
walls can have but little hope, and you thereby destroy
the most softening influence of his nature, is there any
other way by which you can equally as well secure the
absence of the convict from society and yet not entirely
destroy hope ? All who have been in the colonies will
recollect that, in the days of transportation, it was not at
all an unfrequent occurrence for the wife of a convict to
follow him ; in many cases the husband was apportioned
to his wife as her assigned servant, and circumstances
being favourable, they frequently reached a respectable
position to which they not only could never have had the
slightest chance of attaining, but would probably never


have thought of attempting in the mother country, and practical science. And hero multitudinous names (
Many ticket-of-leave men would reform if they could, crowd upon the memory. One dare hardly individualise
but they have not and never can have an opportunity for
restoration in England; they have no honest mode of life
open to them. What shall be done with them, then?
The Falkland Islands appear to me suitable for the forma-
tion of a penal settlement. They are sparsely inhabited,
escape would not be easy, and the climate is not severe.
Some of the agricultural class of convicts might be
allowed to settle upon small garden farms, and work out
the payment by the produce; others might usefully em-
ploy themselves in those occupations which they might
be previously taught in the home prisons, as tailoring,
shoemaking, carpentry, blacksmithing, &c. Good be-
haviour for a term might entitle them to send for their
wives, and thus some ray of hope of constructing a family
be held out to them; and a face to face grapple with nature,
albeit rough and stormy, would be more likely to improve
and elevate the man, when brightened by hope, than the
morbid influences of imprisonment.
Advantages op Colonization.
The surface of Great Britain being limited it follows
that, as the population increases, the capacity of the land,
if devoted to purely agricultural purposes, would soon be
overtaken and eventually surpassed.
The needs of a large and increasing population can
only then be met by increasing the non-agricultural pro-
portion of those who remain in England and by trans-
planting others.
In 1861, the population per thousand appears to have
been composed of
24 Professional.
674 Domestic.
31 Commercial.
101 Agricultural.
242 Industrial.
28 Not defined.
It would seem, then, that as the quantity of land can-
not be enlarged, the agricultural class must remain
stationary in numbers or diminish, which latter is the
more likely to be the case from the improved mechanical
appliances brought into use for the cultivation of the soil,
and it is within possibility that the industrial, which even
now is more than double the agricultural, might event-
ually become too productive for the needs of its own
limited community. The endeavour, therefore, of all
sound statesmanship should be to adjust the demand to
the production, and by such encouragement of emigration
lead to the growth of purchasers in some measure pro-
portionate to the necessary increase of manufactures.
Our colonies afford this plantation or nursery-ground
for the growth of purchasers, the aggregate of the land
available being, according to the table at page 414, prac-
tically unlimited, and the home deficiency of area is thus
amply compensated by the extent of our colonial
possessions. Another advantage of having so large an
extent of acreage, in the form of colonies, is that the
emigrants do not remove from the laws and manners to
which they have been accustomed; they convey with
them, and find on arrival, the same political, religious,
and social thoughts and habits. Similar climate, area,
and soil, would not be so advantageous, if the emigrants
felt that they were going to a country under a despotic
government, or one where the laws would be found to
differ much from those of the land they had left. The
tastes and habits of the emigrants having been acquired
in England, they, to a great extent, lead to a demand for
home productions for their gratification, a very important
matter in a commercial point of view.
A third great advantage derived from the colonies is
the sphere they afford for the prosecution of theoretical
for fear that the very next moment the name of a second
equally bright star may shoot across the sky.
Let me remind you how much-we ow?e to Captain Cook
pre-eminently, to Banks, and Solander, and that our
most learned botanist, Robert Brown spent years in
Australia; the speculative Darwin, whose view r s are shaking
the scientific world, studied the coral reefs when out
amongst the Australian colonies. The names of Beete
Jukes, Logan, Bennett, Falconer, Hooker, and Huxley
are symbols of legions of similar worthies, whose bold,
broad philosophy has been to a great extent the result of
the open eye due to the deep questioning of nature in her
various forms in our new colonies. India opened out new
fields for botanical research; Australia disclosed an
entirely new series of animal life; and Canada has
afforded a magnificent field to our geologists, the earliest
form of animal life on our globe having been there
recently discovered in a stratum far below that in which
life had been previously observed.
And for practical science how vast the field. The
marine of the country is employed and developed
in the form of large emigrant vessels and coasters
to the incredible extent of many millions of tons.
Need I do more than call attention to the innumerable
surveyors, engineers, architects, and educators who find
ample scope and remuneration for their talents in the
colonies. The surveys and canals of India, the railway
and bridges of Canada, the road, harbour, dock, telegraph,
and mill works in every latitude and longitude witness to
the enlarged school of mechanical and engineering science
fer which England has become the centre and eye of the
world.
The late Sir George Cornewall Lewis, in his valuable
essay on the Government of Dependencies, enumerates six
advantages, or supposed advantages, ?which nations have
thought they derived from colonies, viz.:?
Ist. Tribute and revenue paid by the dependency.
2nd. Assistance for military or naval purposes furnished
by the dependency.
3rd. Advantages from its trade with a dependency in
the sense of a monopoly of special privileges.
4th. Facilities afforded by dependencies for the emigra-
tion of its surplus population, and an advantageous
employment of its capital.
sth. Transportation of convicts to a dependency.
6th. Glory.
It will be' seen from my preceding remarks that
scarcely any of these are now of great importance
to England as the dominant country. If any, her
benefits are of a moral and intellectual character.
I have named the extent of land, similarity of laws,
sphere for the cultivation of theoretical and practical
science, but I cannot pass over another advantage, as I
regard it?l refer to the variety and quality of the openings
for the studying and learning the art of government which
our numerous colonies and dependencies present. Educated
men from England depart from our shores to undertake
the government or charge of millions of men scattered
over all the earth, thousands of miles from the mother
country?called to rule mixed races, to rely upon them-
selves, to raise armies if need be, to work upon, to
countenance, to conciliate conflicting interests and passions;
as dictators to decide for themselves on the moment, and
with only the salutary moral fear of a distant English
public opinion to check or control them beyond the high
tone of their own character. And in this respect our
colonies afford a magnificent school, highly beneficial to
the colonies or dependencies, the mother country, and the
world. Do we not all feel a tingle of proud satisfaction
that men of the stamp of Hastings, Clive, Wellesley,
Metcalfe, Elgin, Canning, and Lawrence should govern
large portions of the human race, and that they are our
countrymen, in many cases sprung from the ranks by the


nadve energy of their surpassing talents, which have raised aspects:?lst. The Imperial. 2nd. The Colonial. 3rd.
them to the highest positions of fame and usefulness.
Disadvantages of Colonies to the Home Country,
The advantages we have named are not without draw-
backs. Philosophers tell us that the effect of natural
forces diminishes in far greater ratio than the mere dis-
tance from the centre of power, and history records that as
nations or conquerors have attempted to rule over or con-
quer remote provinces the hold has ever been loose, diffi-
cult, transitory, and failing, generally felt to be oppressive
by the province, always exhaustive of men and money to
the dominant state. And wherever the governing power
has either attempted to compel the inhabitants to render
military service or to contribute by taxation to the needs
of the central authority, the result has been the same,
whether under Greek, Roman, Spanish, or English rule.
Confining our thoughts to a slight survey of our own
English position, we may observe that our army being
small and derived from voluntary enlistment, the neces-
sity of garrisoning so many colonies places us at a great
disadvantage in carrying on any considerable military
operations by land, whether at home or abroad. Had the
whole English army been available for the Crimean war
our national position in that affair would have been alto-
gether different, both as regards allies and foes. Were
the islands of Great Britain the only coasts we have to
guard, our fleet would be amply sufficient, when at its
least effective strength, to render us safe from attack; but
the fleet, like the army, is scattered in detached fragments
the world around?a frigate here?a liner there?thou-
sands of miles apart. Not only do we suffer from the
available force at home being so crippled in numbers, but
the retention of colonies requires both our army and
navy to be much more numerous and, therefore, more
costly than if we had the home country only to defend,
and this great expense (it, perhaps, would not be too much
to say half the total) falls heavily on the English tax-
payer, Our colonies present our most vulnerable point to an
enemy, the attack can be concentrated upon any one spot,
whereas the means of defence are widely scattered. Can
anyone doubt for a moment that the unseemly language
and overbearing conduct of the United States of America
during so many years past have been entirely owing, not
to any real cause of offence given by the people or the
government of this country, but to the fact that we have
one vulnerable place in the event of war with the Federal
States. We should have the almost impossible task of
defending a land frontier of twelve hundred miles in
length which could be crossed at any spot by an invading
army. Combinations of other naval powers could pounce
upon some of our colonies and temporarily occupy and cause
great distress to, if not permanently possess them, but in the
case of Canada no sea voyage is necessary, we are exposed to
the attacks of an ambitious people, now possessing a large
army, the reabsorption of which into the ordinary occupa-
tions of life will require all the judgment of the governing
powers.
It may be said that the Imperial Government can, by
moderation, wisdom, and uprightness, prevent such a
result, or at least so control its conduct, that, whatever
may ensue, it will stand justified in the sight of the world.
The danger, and the vast expense it causes, neverthe-
less exist, and Canada is a continual anxiety.
Thus far with reference to the danger we incur
from other nations and governments on account of our
colonies. In many cases, however, the home country has
to bear the burden, wholly or in part, of local wars to
which she has no inclination'?wars entered into without
her consent, contrary to her advice, and for purely local
reasons and advantages, and out of which England?as
England?can derive neither benefit nor honour, 1 refer
to such wars as many of those we have had in India, at
the Cape, and, at the present moment, in New Zealand.
One or two sentences in reference to the last will put
this subject in a clear light. That question has three
The Native.
Before New Zealand became a colony, the Imperial
Government entered into an arrangement with the
natives, one item of which arrangement was that the
natives should be allowed to keep their land if they
chose, and neither he compelled to part with it by sale
nor have it taken away. The Colonial Government
cannot cancel the obligations of that treaty, whether
wisely or unwisely made, but years subsequently to the
arrangement, and after a constitution had been granted to
the European part of the community, the anxiety to ob-
tain land for speculative purposes (it cannot be for present
settlement, because no one will contend that the land
now owned by Europeans is brought under cultivation to
anything like its full extent), caused the Colonial Govern-
ment to purchase land from a chief who was not the
rightful owner. When possession was refused, instead of
pausing and inquiring into the merits of the case, a course
suggested to the Local Government, by the Bishop and
the Chief Justice on the spot, and by myself in England
to the late Duke of Newcastle, the wrong man's title was
supported by an armed force, and this I consider to have
been the primary cause of the present war. After the
arrival of the new Governor, the question of the title was
investigated and the land given up, but bitter feelings had
arisen, revenge and all the bad passions which murder,
robbery, and burning create, had by this time taken deep
root and extended. And England has had to pay some
millions of money for a war incurred chiefly about this
miserable squabble respecting 600 acres of land.
I name this one case to show our liability to incur
enormous expense for the sake of our colonies. However
right or wrong they may be, we must stand by them even
in their local wars. The Colonial Government may say,
? Let us alone and we will settle our own local diffi-
culties,? but they should also recollect that the Home
Government cannot always allow such license, its own
word and arrangements have some claim to be upheld,
and in the present instance the local government was
not in existence when the bargain was made; the
arrangement was made direct with the Queen?s representa-
tive, and the government of the natives has always been
excluded from colonial control.
Again, at one period, when this country could send its
convicts almost whithersoever it preferred, when our
home manufacturers were highly favoured against foreign
productions, when we had the monopoly of colonial ship-
ping and carrying trade?selfishness might have induced
us to retain our colonies with a pertinacity comparable
to the vigour with which we had obtained them.
But now, when they are placed upon the same basis
as ourselves, in reference to trade; when perfect freedom
exists in all or nearly all of our colonies; nay, when some
of them are contemplating and even enacting protective
duties against the home country, I must boldly say that
our liabilities on their account are so great, that when-
ever any one of our colonies, or all, are disposed to
separate from the mother country, and are no longer
desirous of sheltering themselves under the parental
roof, but, like grown up sous and daughters, are ambi-
tious to settle for themselves, I should cheerfully assent,
wishing them all success and God-speed.
Separation from the Mother Country.
This brings me to inquire whether the colonists them-
selves desire to withdraw from the government of the
home country ? I believe they all desire to retain their
connection with the home country. However free and
unbecoming may be the language of some of the colonies
towards the home government, occasionally amounting
almost to insolence, yet looking at the matter broadly
and over a lengthened period, it must be unhesitatingly
asserted that there is not at the present moment a
single colony at all desirous of throwing off allegiance
to the home country. Two or three reasons, out


of many which might be given for this satisfaction, Canada, and the pertinacity with which the rival claims
may be named. First, for the most part the colonists of Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, and Marlborough have
have had large and liberal constitutions.granted to them,
whereby each colony is empowered to make its own laws,
raise its revenue in the form most agreeable to itself, an act
which it sometimes does very much to the prejudice of
the home country?in fact, with few exceptions, to govern
itself as independently as if it were a distinct nation.
Not only so, but they possess the additional advantage
of bearing but a comparatively small share of the cost of
their own defence, and have the most powerful maritime
nation in the world committed to their protection. And
it is scarcely too much to assert that if the flag of England
were hauled down and ceased to wave over our colonial
possessions, the smaller ones would most certainly, and
the larger ones very probably, soon fall a prey to less
lenient control than the British. Again, consider the
rate at which the several colonies borrow money for their
local improvements. The direct monetary advantage of
the guarantee of the home government is very consider-
able, or it would not be so eagerly sought. Even without
that, a British colony comes into the money market with
confidence, and secures loans on terms which most foreign
countries would be extremely glad to obtain.
There is another matter, which the better class of
colonists deem of great importance in a social point of view.
If detached from the old country they would probably,
almost necessarily, form republics, and have all the burn-
ing heats of violent political partisanship, presidential
elections, &c., and take their whole tone of society from
the narrow limits of a small population, the key-note of
public feeling, sentiment, and manners being struck from
the uneducated mass, working from below, if I may so
speak, upwards. Quite apart from all questions of de-
pendence and monetary and material advantages or dis-
advantages of a connection with the mother country, the
best class of colonists value this connection for reasons
which may be thus stated: ?Nominated by her Majesty,
who is too elevated by her position to have any other
motive than the welfare of the colonial community, the
authority of her appointed governor unembarrassed by local
ties or influences, fresh to the colony, and generally a man
of superior education and knowledge of the world, accom-
panied by an accomplished wife, a lady by manners and
birth; the prestige of a bishop and clergy carrying to a
greater or less extent profound respect for the learning
of Oxford and Cambridge to the uttermost corners of the
earth; the presence of military officers, the mild excite-
ment of the inspection of the few troops stationed in most
of the colonies, the periodical playing of the military
bands, enlivening the otherwise dull business existence
and softening the rude competition of the majority of
the settlers?all these the colonists feel tend to raise the
tone and give an old-home air to colonial society. Again,
the visits of our men-of-war are always looked forward to
with pleasure, even the solemn magisterial office regard-
ing the escapades of Jack ashore with a very lenient eye;
and the youngest and most mischievous middy who can
display her Majesty?s button may safely reckon upon
finding a hearty welcome in every settler?s home, whether
the veriest log-hut or of palatial pretensions. Many
military and naval officers form such associations and
attachments in the colonies in which they may have been
temporally located that they eventually retire from active
service and become settlers; and so much are they desired
as colonists that special advantages are generally offered
to settlers who may have belonged to her Majesty?s
service. Now, all must admit that the presence of a
small court, if we may so term it, comprised of the
elements wo have named, is very advantageous to a
colony; and I venture to assert that this class of advan-
tages, more than the pecuniary benefits arising from the
presence of government, induce those violent contests for
the honour of being the capital, which we see exhibited in
every colony. Witness the dispute as to whether
Montreal, Toronto, or Ottawa should be the capital of
been put forward for the honour of being the capital of
New Zealand; the same may be said of Calcutta, which
otherwise would certainly not long remain at the present
day the capital of India.
Confederation.
I now venture to offer a few remarks on a subject
which is becoming important, inasmuch as the results
of the discussion now going on will affect, for good or
evil, large territories of the globe, and millions of its
inhabitants, of English blood, speaking our language,
and retaining more or less the habits and love of the
old country, and in whose destinies we cannot but feel a
great interest. Colonies are first formed by a small
settlement being made on the coast of some newly-
discovered island or continent, and distance from the
mother country necessitates-the speedy establishment of a
government, if such has not been previously arranged
before the departure of the colonists. As the straggling
colonists, with their innate love of wandering, proceed
further and further from the primary settlement, often
leaving large unoccupied gaps between the settled districts,
it becomes advisable to have a second and a third focus of
government, in order to bring these scattered populations
under control. Hence boundaries, separate governors,
legislatures, and revenue laws, applicable to the peculiar
needs of each community. In process of time these
communities, becoming more numerous, approach
and touch each other, and that which formerly
was a necessity for separate colonial legislation be-
comes incidentally followed by inconveniences. Local
jurisdiction, difference of revenue duties, weaknesses
from dissension, all occasion difficulties and disputes.
From this cause, and more particularly from the threatening
language of the government of the Federal States of
North America, this question of the federation of colonies,
has recently been revived. Time does not permit us to
discuss this matter largely, but it may suffice to point out
a few of the main principles which should guide the
establishment of a federation.
Ist. Equitable adjustment of taxation and duties,
internal and external, for revenue purposes, that there
may be no inducements to smuggling and fraud, and
the expense of frontier custom-houses, watchmen, or coast-
guards may be rendered unnecessary.
2nd. One system of monetary regulations, currency,
coinage, and banking laws,
3rd, Uniform criminal and commercial laws.
4th. General application of loans for public works,
and combined naval and military defences.
The disadvantages of confederation of this kind are to be
found in the comparatively greater attention which would
be given to general, rather than to the individual or local
interests of the separate districts or provinces, and the
subordination of the local governments to the central
authority, the consequent diminished importance of the
provincial councils and capitals, the swallowing up of the
local in the central, and the want of recognition of those
peculiar advantages, which each small colony believes
itself in a position to offer to the intending settler.
On the other hand the advantages are manifold.
All border disputes about taxation and revenue would
entirely cease. Is it not absurd, for instance, that goods
imported into South Australia should pay one rate of duty,
and through Victoria another, and that the running of
customable goods across the border of adjoining colonies
should be a source of profit to the unscrupulous, attended
at the same time with great expense to the colony more
highly taxing any given, article, in order, by customs?
stations on the frontier line, to protect its revenue.
Again, unseemly quarrels about postal service, as between
Victoria and New South Wales, would be avoided or
overruled, as the general government would not be likely
to have local preferences. As each district, from its

geographical position, animal, vegetable, or mineral
resources, necessarily varies in its peculiar requirements
and the inducements it offers to emigrants, so it may be
laid down that, subordinate to certain general principles
and laws, which should include the fewest subjects
possible, and be as clearly defined as practicable, the
separate provinces or colonies should possess all the free-
dom of legislation and action compatible with the general
good. It is evident that a fishing, a timber, a corn, and a
sheep-farming colony may and must have very different
modes of regarding the laws which should govern its
taxation, its offers of land to emigrants, and. the con-
stituent-elements of its general prosperity.
It would seem therefore that federation may more
easily be longitudinal than latitudinal, climate having so
much more influence on the welfare and social habits of
human beings than at first sight we are apt to suppose.
A tax upon wool, for instance, which would be oppressive
at one extremity of a confederation, 1000 miles in length
latitudinally, and almost unfelt at the other, might be an
equally felt burthen in a confederation of 1000 miles
length longitudinally. Whether this be a precisely cor-
rect view in every case or not, certain it is that, without
permanent and close similarity of interest, confederation
would be difficult, very probably not advisable. The ex-
citement of a common danger is a very ephemeral bond;
and the moment the fear of the threatened danger ceases,
the chafing of the bond is inconveniently felt. In the
last century the common cause of severing from England,
united the several colonies of America, against the mother
country; but the danger of the anticipated punishment for
rebellion having ceased, the difference of internal interests
is causing the most ferocious war on record.
The confederation of several colonies for purposes of
defence in case of invasion is doubtless very desirable.
Conquest is not the result of an invading force being able
suddenly and momentarily to overrun a country, for how-
ever disastrous to the peaceful inhabitants such a visitation
always is, this curse may be only temporary, and the
marauding wave be eventually driven back. It is most
important for security against such inroads, to check their
progress if attempted, or to recover lost ground, that strong
positions, either presented by natural advantages of situa-
tion, or arising from scientific constructions, should be
judiciously selected, capable of offering stubborn resistance
to the invader', and regarded as barriers or nuclei, behind
and into which the militia, volunteers, and small military
force of the mother country, to which every colony at the
outbreak of war must necessarily be limited, may resort,
and there make a resolute and permanent stand, until
their compatriots may have time to rally, and adequate
assistance be rendered by the old country. In other cases
these defences would probably consist of gunboats, dykes,
moats, and canals, water impediments to the enemy.
Plans of this kind can evidently bo more advantageously
and successfully carried out, the larger the population
contributing such mutual assistance, and the greater the
area for selection of good defence points. The rallying
forts or entrenched camps would be comparatively
fewer, but much stronger and more imposing to the invader
than if each colony, island, or province had to rely
upon itself unaided; and the naval and military com-
binations would be more effective and likely to secure
the general result?the common defence. In this sense
the union of several colonies is much to be encouraged.
1 do not at all agree with the idea that because Canada is
not a desirable seat of war for England, therefore
no attempt should be made at defence. Our being at a
disadvantage there is a circumstance we cannot avoid,
and must accept as we find. We should, of course, not
select it as our field of battle, but when we know it is
our weakest place, of which the enemy would be sure to
avail himself, I read neither English history nor the national
characteristics aright if I could believe for one moment
that we would expose some three or four millions of our
fellow subjects to the tender mercies of an army under such

a man as Butler, without aiding them to make the
best attempt at local resistance possible under the circum-
stances.
The question of colonial defence appears to be com-
posed of three elements ?mode of defence ?expense
?men. It would seem that the particular mode of
defence in any given case must be left to the professional
scientific advisers of the Crown and the colonies, with the
understanding that the object is not for an English army or
navy so much as for the local force. The expense of the per-
manent works in any given case should be borne by the
colony, as it would be incurred for its special benefit, and the
money would be spent among its population; but as any war
to which the colonies might be exposed might be caused
by imperial considerations, there would be little objection
to the home government guaranteeing the interest. As
the armament could be better provided, so that expense
might bo borne, by the home government, which
would have control over its disposal and removal.
Colonists should recollect that England is safe from
attack; that we incur large expenses both of money and
time on their behalf; money in taxes for the support
of an army and navy principally employed in their
defence, and time in large numbers of our people
learning drill and the duties of soldiers, that we may allow
our regular troops to be distributed all over the world.
As to the men, no binding rule can be laid down; the
number of the imperial forces must depend at all times
upon its other needs; as a general principle the home
force permanently located in any one colony could only
be very small. Our colonies have been freed from con-
trol ; their legislation is seldom advantageous, often ad-
verse, to the mother country, and they must learn to bear
the pecuniary burden of their own local defence.
Conclusion.
Upon the great empire which is presided over by our
sovereign lady Queen Victoria, the sun ever shines; and as
the morning gun boometh in a thousand ports, our pleasant
red ensign floats out in the bright sunlight, greeted with a
home thrill which only the emigrant exile can feel, for
under its protection thought, speech, and action are
free as the breathing wind which flutters through its wavy
folds. At its sight ever the morning prayer or evening
blessing welleth up in the hearts of English men and
women, encircling the earth in one bond of union, free-
dom, and progress, for after the longest lapse of years, the
look is still to Old England as their home. Shall the
freedom wo enjoy, and which, by our colonial empire, is
spreading throughout the world, be curtailed and shorn
of its proportions, or shall we, faithful to our high trust,
diffuse throughout the world the liberty which our
forefathers died to achieve, and with our privilege accept
its responsibilities? We think our countrymen will give
but one emphatic answer to the question; and while our
colonial brothers desire to remain under the mild rule of
our widowed Queen, they will ever find their English
friends willing to stand with them shoulder to shoulder
on their behalf, ready for quiet victory or silent death.
DISCUSSION.
The Ohaihman, before inviting discussion on this in-
teresting and important subject, would make a few obser-
vations upon the singularly valuable paper which they
had just heard. Mr. Stones had observed that he had
purposely abstained from saying anything about ancient
colonization; but, from the very able character of the
paper throughout, he (the Chairman) could have wished
that subject had been treated of, because it was one of the
most interesting in the world. All we have in taste, in
art, in beauty, in poetry, and in philosophy, came from
the Greek colonies, which had led to the foundation of
Rome. This subject was peculiarly interesting our-
selves, inasmuch as it would seem to have been our mission
to conquer the dusky nations of the east, and to people
the lands of the fertile south with a race of hardy
islanders. He, therefore, quite agreed with the senti-
ments expressed by Mr. Stones with regard to
emigration, of which it might truly be said that
?it blesseth him that gives and him that takes.?
A farmer in Wiltshire had lately stated to him that he
remembered the time when the labourer considered him-
self w'ell paid with the price of a bushel of wheat for his
wages; he was now paid the price of two bushels, thus
showing the effects of emigration upon the welfare of
those who remained at home. He quite agreed that
emigrants should be men who could do hard work?pro-
fessional men were not so mucli wanted. With regard to
the supply of raw materials from our colonies, he could
only say this?that in the late dearth of cotton we had
searched the world through for supplies of that material.
The magnificent empire of the Brazils; the south of
China, containing the most industrious population in the
world; the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates had
together given us but little; but from our old
dependency of India we had obtained about four-
fifths of our recent supply. This showed how im-
portant an influence British rule exercised in pro-
moting the supply of such raw materials as we required.
He differed from the author of the paper in his idea that
mechanical contrivances would have the effect of making
labour cheaper. He saw before him an honourable friend
(Mr. Baxley) who had a great deal to do with mechanical
contrivances, and he was sure he would confirm the state-
ment that the more mechanical contrivances thrived
the more they tended to make labour dear. With
machinery a man worked with the fingers of a giant, and
was consequently better paid than if ho did the work with
his own hands, as the production was so much greater.
In fact, mechanical contrivances ultimately tended to
raise wages. With regard to the danger of foreign attacks
upon our distant colonies, no doubt that danger was in-
creased in proportion to the spread of civilization over the
world. It was thus rendered necessary for the mother
country to maintain enormous armaments and fleets
for the protection of the interests of her colonies,
but these also afforded us the means of making effective
reprisals in case of an attack on any of our dependencies. If
the French were to assail our West Indian colonies we could
bombard Brest, or some other seaport, in return; there-
fore it was not probable they would do this, because the
retribution would be greater than any injury they could
inflict upon our distant colonies. There were in the
paper some very striking remarks with respect to the
1 extraordinary feeling of brotherhood produced by political
; and commercial connection. It would seem that in the
; present day, when the principles of free-trade prevailed,
there would be no advantage in this political connection,
' but the contrary was the fact. Take for instance the
! Cape of Good Hope, which was perhaps rather an ill-
f favoured colony. We gave up Java and Sumatra to the
Dutch and kept the Cape, and it was a remarkable fact
\ that our exports to the Cape were now five times what
they were to Java and Sumatra. No doubt if the politi-
cal connection of this country with those islands had
been maintained, the exports would have been much
larger. Take again the instance of the Mauritius?a
- beautiful little island, not larger than the Isle of Wight,
- The exports from this country to that small colony
7 were more than ten times as extensive as those to the
great country of Mexico ; three times as great as
those to Moldavia and Wallachia; and twenty times as
great as those to Persia. Then take India?the exports
to that country were twenty millions annually, whereas
to China, with a large population?more industrious
though less frugal?the exports were only five millions.
If we were in possession of China as we were of India, our
exports to that country would probably amount to
one hundred millions per annum. These were some
of the leading advantages of our colonial possessions.
The paper referred to another subject of importance?
that was the granting of free institutions to our


colonies. He was afraid that in that we had been
somewhat precipitate. It was done no doubt with
the best intentions, but it had launched some of those
infant communities into the wildest democracy the world
had ever seen, and had given rise to forms of government
which the most advanced liberal would tremble to see
introduced into the old country. He agreed with what
Mr. Stones had said on the subject of transportation. It
was impossible, in the present state of society, to keep
people immured in gaols for any very lengthened periods.
Imprisonment for life, or even for ten or fifteen years,
was unendurable to the worst of criminals, and transporta-
tion somewhere appeared to be desirable upon all con-
siderations. He had seen the working of the system in
the Australian colonies, and he could assure them that
under the old plan, which was after all not particularly
well carried out, the best results were produced. The
Falkland Islands had been suggested as a locality for the
transportation of criminals, and in that suggestion he con-
curred. It was a very windy place, where it was said
? the bar was blown off one?s head,? but perhaps that was
a climatic condition good enough for convicts. With re-
gard to confederation, however desirable that might be,
there were difficulties in the way of it, though not perhaps
insuperable. We lived in times when we had seen the
great American Confederation broken up; they never
could be friends again, whatever happened; and this
showed that in any confederation of the Canadas and
other colonies there would be great difficulties. With
regard to what had been said as to the cost of maintain-
ing the naval protection of our colonies, they must re-
member that our navy required arsenals all over the
world ; and these must be furnished whether we had
colonies or not. It must not bo forgotten that our
commerce every year amounted to nearly six hundred
millions, including the carrying trade. The maintenance
of our navy cost ten millions per annum, and if it were
for nothing else than for the protection of our commerce
on the seas this would be but a small per-centage upon
the whole.
Professor Leone Levi said?Proud as this country
might be in having given birth to so many communities,
some of which had already become incipient empires,
proud as she might be in possessing a territory so vast,
a population so extensive, and resources so great as
had been so vividly described this evening, there were
causes in operation which were likely to lessen materially
the need of possessing such colonies, and which would,
render the possible separation of any of them a matter of
much less solicitude than would have been imagined
some years ago. What were the principal benefits
supposed to be derived from the colonial system?
Practically three only: a large field for emigration ;
an extension of trade, with facilities for the investment
of capital; and political strength and influence. Much
was said of the field afforded by colonies for emigration.
He could well conceive that in times gone by, when
countries knew each other only by their armed forces,
when there was no protection beyond what could be
obtained by the national flag and national power, it
became necessary for our redundant population to found
colonies where they might establish themselves in safety.
When war was the normal state of international relations
no one could risk himself in the dominions of other
countries. But the times were now, happily, quite
changed in this respect. Now that peace was
the rule and war only the exception; now that inter-
national law and public law reign supreme everywhere,
there was no longer the necessity of seeking the
shield of British protection within the national territory.
Our emigrants were, in fact, but little affected by such
national considerations. Take the emigrants for 1862 to
the United States and British North America. One was
foreign, the other British. Yet 69,000 went* to the one
and only 15,000 to the other. No doubt a common
language, common laws, common manners, would always
be important considerations for an emigrant in the choice
of a country, but even those elements were now greatly
modified by the constant merging of nationalities, by the
greater assimilation of manners, the better knowledge of
languages, and the greater charity which obtained every-
where for the foreigner. Secondly, as to commerce it was
admitted that a third of our entire trade was now carried
on with the colonies, and that more than half of the
entire trade of the colonies was carried on with the
United Kingdom. This showed that as the colonies
were of great importance to the United Kingdom, so the
United Kingdom was of the greatest importance to the
colonies, but that did not depend on the present rela-
tion of the colonies to the mother country. It only evi-
denced, on the one hand, the capacity of these territories
to produce articles of great and universal value, and on
the other, the capacity of the United Kingdom, as the
largest market of the world, to attract such produce to its
shores. In the present state of our colonial legislation
the colonies were no longer bound to send their produce to
this country. They sent it because they got here the
highest price for it. They sent it because they were
sure of a market. They sent it because they were greatly
indebted to this country for the manufactures they pur-
chased and for the capital Britain invested in them. He
admitted the fact that such colonies were of great value
to our trade, that they supplied us with articles absolutely
necessary for our consumption and for our manufactures,
that they consumed a large amount of British goods,
greater of course than other communities; but he doubted
whether this was because they were our colonies. It was
simply because they followed the natural laws of trade.
As for the investment of capital, he had yet to learn what
guarantees were afforded in any of our colonies greater
than were obtainable in other countries. The advantage
they possessed was that they had virgin soil to work upon
and infant communities offering the most brilliant
prospects of increase. But that resulted from circum-
stances natural to the territories themselves, their soil,
their climate, and their power of production. The third
prominent advantage which colonies seemed to confer
was strength. But, ignorant as he was of the art of war,
he certainly scarcely thought that, in a strategic point of
view, our colonies were not of any great value, at least
the greater number of them. They were rather calcu-
lated to scatter our forces, to divert our attention, and to
weaken our power of offence and defence on the high
seas, where, after all, the great conflict of nations was de-
cided. He would not enlarge on this point, since persons
of greater practical knowledge might be ready to disprove
any such consideration. Yet it was a question of im-
portance to consider whether our colonies were really im-
parting strength to the empire or not. Time, indeed,
was when the extension of territory was considered a
primary condition of political influence, but we know now
that the larger the territory the more difficult it was
to govern. Look at Kussia, how hard it was for the
central government effectually to rule the extremities.
And what did we experience ourselves ? Could we govern
India from this country? Could we govern Australia?
it would be morally impossible. Most of our colonies
were, in fact, self-governed; in some all authority was left
in the hands of the governor, legislating alone or with
a consultative council; in some the power was in the
hands of the legislative council, partly nominated and
partly elected; and in other cases the authority was en-
trusted to an elective council and an elective assembly;
but in each case very little power was vested either in the
Secretary of State or in the Queen herself. There was, no
doubt, much glory in the name of possessing countries so
great, but as to any attempt to direct the government of
them, it must be renounced altogether. If, therefore, no
great practical advantages arose from the present bond of
colonial relationship, we might be quite sure that the time
would soon come when questions of separation would
force themselves on our attention, whether they were pro


voked by the colonies themselves, or by thoughts of rigid
economy, or otherwise. An evidence of the altered
state of public opinion on this subject was given in the
cession of the lonian Islands. Some twenty years ago it
would have appeared sheer madness to have parted with
such colonies in an important position in the Mediter-
ranean. Now they were abandoned without a sigh. It
would, perhaps, be said that this was only another mani-
festation of the grovelling spirit of the age, but, in truth,
it was the result of a great change in the prevailing opinion
as to the real sources of national strength and prosperity.
What would further facilitate this impending separation,
would be the confederations now 7 negotiated. Itwould never
be possible to abandon these infant communities to them-
selves so long as they were isolated, but let them associate
themselves into great federations, and they would be able to
stand their ground, and to place themselves firmly under the
protection of public and international law. What weshould
do was to render these federations as complete as possible;
and he was glad to find in Mr. Stones? paper some valu-
able suggestions in this respect. What they certainly
should aim at was an equitable adjustment of taxation
and duties founded on the dictates of economic science.
It was a disgrace that any of them should resort to pro-
tective export duties after the mother country had taught
them better things. If any country should be able to
experiment on the working of a complete free-trade
system, it should be our colonies with their small expen-
diture and their thriving population. They certainly
should have one system of monetary regulations, cur-
rency, coinage, and banking laws, and they should have a
uniform criminal and commercial law. We were lament-
ing the differences between the laws of Scotland and
England. But what were these differences to those arising
from a completely different system, some colonies having
Dutch, some French, and some Spanish laws, setting aside
India with its Hindoo, Mahometan, and Parsee laws.
These were practical difficulties which we should endea-
vour to remove. It certainly appeared that some of our
colonies, such as Canada and Australia, had reached the
state of manhood; and it depended very much on them-
selves to determine what kind of relation they would
continue to hold with the mother country. Britain had
certainly fostered them in their infancy, and watched
their growth with all the solicitude of a parent, and
should they now desire to part, it would become her duty
to regard them, not with jealousy, but with sympathy,
and to act towards them, if not with patronage and
fatherly interest, at least with brotherly affection and
brotherly encouragement.
Mr. Torrens said, while he agreed with all that had
been said in the paper with regard to the advantages
derived by the mother country and by the colonies from
mutual connection and from emigration, he entirely dis-
sented from what had been said with respect to the
counter-balancing disadvantages of that connection. He
had the best opportunities of forming sound opinions on
this subject, having early in life emigrated to a new
country, now highly prosperous. He referred to South
Australia, where he had filled the office of Com-
missioner of Trade and Customs. He joined issue with
the author of the paper on the statement that our
colonies were exhaustive to the mother country in men
and money. On that point he thought the paper answered
itself, because, in the early part of it, Mr, Stones dwelt
appropriately upon the great increase of the wealth of the
mother country, occasioned by the demand for her pro-
ductions by her sons transplanted into countries where
they were more adequately rewarded for their labour. By
that means they were enabled to consume a larger amount
of British manufactures than if they had remained at
home. It would be found that in the Australian colonies
the average consumption of British manufactures through-
out the entire populatiou was �8 per head per annum.
They knew that no labourer in this country consumed
anything like that; but by sending a portion of the
surplus labour of the country to our colonies they enabled
a larger population to subsist at home. Thus he main-
tained that colonization was not exhaustive to the mother
country in men ; far less was it exhaustive in money. If
they looked around them in this great city they found
those who bad acquired wealth in the colonies spending
that wealth in this city, besides which, there was the
increased wealth derived by this country from the demand
for our manufactures by the populations of the colonies.
The next point alluded to as being regarded as a
drawback was the cost of protecting the colonies,
and that whilst that expense fell upon the mother
country the colonists, in some cases, were at liberty
to impose protective duties, so as to exclude the manu-
factures of the mother country. That was a state of
things that ought not to exist; but while it did exist to
some extent, it was well to inquire how it had arisen,
and whether there was any necessity for its continuance.
The mother country had hitherto generously and gra-
tuitously afforded naval and military protection to her
colonies, but they did not in many cases require it; and
it was contrary to common sense that they should be
exempt from the taxation which was borne by the people
at home for this object. He maintained that this state
of things had in some cases arisen from the neglect ot
the mother country to make proper demands on her
colonies in this respect, which would not have been re-
sisted if made. It had been stated by Sir Henry Young
that he sent home a despatch to the Secretary of
State proposing that the colony over which ho was placed
should pay half the cost of the military protection, but to
that despatch he never received any answer. In South
Australia, whence he (Mr. Torrens) had recently come,
they maintained a large volunteer corps; and in Victoria
a vote of �20,000 had been passed for the supply of heavy
artillery for that colony. He did not hesitate to say that
the great majority of the colonies were prepared to take
their fair share of these burdens upon themselves. With
regard to protective duties against British manufactures,
he thought that when constitutions were granted to
them they ought to have been prohibited from imposing
duties which had the effect of excluding the goods ot
the mother country from their markets. He believed
the true remedy for this objectionable feature would
be found?not in separation or federation ?but in a
closer union with the mother country. If, instead ot
treating the colonies as foreign states, we treated them
as integral parts of the kingdom, the result would be
different, and the productions of each country would be
admitted to each without duty, to the mutual benefit of
both; and under such a reciprocity the colonies might be
fairly called upon to contribute to the support of the
naval and military defence of the common country. If
this were the case, however, the colonies might then lay
claim to be represented in the British Parliament ?not to
the whole extent of their numbers, but in such a manner
as that facts relating to the colonies might be laid before
the House from a colonists? point of view. He believed
that system to be a practical one, and that thus instead of
the colonies being a source of weakness and exhaustion
to the mother country, they would become her greatest
strength and support.
Mr. J. Crawford said they had listened for an hour to
Mr. Stones?s paper, and he thought they all felt that hour
was too short, so interesting had they found it. It had
never been his lot to listen to a more comprehensive
? state ? paper ; it might be regarded as the production of
a true statesman, and he was most heartily obliged to
Mr. Stones for it. There were, however, a few points in
which he differed from him. He had said that most of
our raw materials?even cotton?were derived from our
colonies. His friend, Mr, Bazley, knew very well that
cotton had not been brought to any great extent from our
colonies. Our great supply of that article had been
derived from a country which certainly ninety years ago
was a colony of this empire, but which since that time had


become a cotton-producing country. We had been re-
ceiving some inferior qualities of cotton from India; but
when peace was restored in America this product would
come from that country as before, because no spot in the
world appeared to equal the Southern States of America
for the production of a high quality of cotton. He
had no objection to make with regard to wool. Our
colonies certainly did furnish us with enormous quantities
of wool, and the prosperity of this country greatly de-
pended upon that product. He thought, in the statement
made by Mr. Stones, in which he attributed the rise of
20 per cent, in the wages of labour in this country to
emigration, sufficient allowance had not been made for the
large importations of gold from our own colonies. This
enormous influx of gold had been going on for the last
sixteen or seventeen years, and thus, in fact, our capital
had been largely increased, giving employment to so
many new hands, and constituting an additional demand
for labour. _ Therefore, to the introduction of gold he prin-
cipally attributed the rise of wages to which Mr. Stones
had referred. With respect to confederation, he pretty
nearly agreed with Mr. Stones on that subject. He did not
see that any particular advantages would result from it to
the colonies themselves, except, perhaps, in the case of the
Canadas. He did not believe they would ever get Aus-
tralia or New Zealand to form a confederation, inasmuch
as danger from a foreign enemy was of the very remotest
kind as regarded those colonies. They were able to
defend themselves without soldiers, with the assistance
of the British navy. The only great maritime powers
who could attack them were Trance or America, and
neither country had a navy equal to our own. With the
Canadas, however, the case was different, with its 1,200
miles of frontier, which it was impossible to defend; with
Montreal not more than 50 or 60 miles from that frontier,
quite indefensible. He did not see what advantages New
Brunswick or Newfoundland could derive from a confedc.
lation with the Canadas. He would say generally when any
colony desired to part from us, the sooner we got rid of it the
better. The Canadas were no great advantage to us
but we were bound in honour to defend them so long as
they looked to us to do so. He did not, however, think
we could defend them with success against the powerful
nation that was on their frontier, who, with a large dis-
ciplined army, might at any time invade Canada; but, in
his opinion, they would not do so because it could only
be done at the cost of a vast sum of money; and the
interest on their national debt already exceeded our own.
Moreover, if they went to war with us, every port they
possessed would be blockaded by our ships. He had, in
conclusion, a very few words to say in reply to the observa-
tions of the chairman with respect to the ancient
colonies. They were, after all, but very small matters.
Every country that possessed a few boats?-and the Greek
vessels were little better?every country that possessed
islands was pretty certain to engage in maritime en-
terprise, and the Greeks had an extraordinary enterprise
for so small a people ; for their whole number did not
exceed the population of Australia and New Zealand at
this moment. But for the discovery of America there
would have been but little land for colonization, and .
previous to this discovery certain other discoveries were
made: paper, printing, the polarity of the magnet, and ,
gunpowder. Then it was that a great amount of mari- 1
time enterprise was manifested. In ancient times it was
true that the Greeks planted themselves among barbarous i
nations, but there was little scope for colonization in the '
old . world, while the new world afforded an almost un- <
limited field; and as soon as European enterprise was ripe <
for the work the foundation was laid of the vast colonies i
now owning British rule. . c
Mr. Thos. Bazley, M.P., fully concurred in the general i
impression as to the very able character of the paper; it c
contained much of enlightened policy; at the same time 1
he thought that the author had in one or two places v
spoken hardly of the people of the United States, and of t
- some of the leaders of the armies of the North. In this
t respect he begged to express the strongest dissent from
1 him. Nor could he let pass, without a slight criticism,
e the remark which had fallen from his hon. friend
i in the chair, to the effect that the re-confederation
3 of the States of America could not be looked for, and
r that it would be impossible to restore harmony between
s those States. He (Mr. Bazley) thought, seeing that
- victory had given to the North something like a restitu-
t tion of territory, there was no occasion for that remark
f to have been made on .this occasion, while we were
) uttering expressions of sympathy for the loss which the
3 States had experienced through the murder of their
s President. The South had rebelled against the North ;
t and the South had no moral claim to the sympathy of
l this great and free country, owing to the institution of
) slavery. The negro had been debased, but he was now
I receiving something like vindication in the punishment
which was being inflicted upon the slave owners of the
3 Southern Saates. We had given freedom to the slaves in
7 the British West India Islands, and they were more pro-
t ductive under the state of freedom than they had been
) under the system of slavery. Touching the question of
? protection, there was the evidence of what we did for the
? West India Islands. When they were under the system
i of slavery we paid (owing to protective duties) an excess
- of price for sugar imported into this country exceeding
i the whole amount of manufactures we sent there. We
s then squandered �4,000,000 per annum in the form of
> protection to our West India Islands. As to the connec-
tion of this country with the colonies, he thought that so
long as they could maintain that connection with us, by
all means let them do so. They had our customs, lan-
guage, and laws; he hoped also they had our common
sympathies, and that they would feel it to be to their
interest to remain in connection with us; but he was
quite sure not a moment longer than they deemed it to
their own interest would they hold to this connection,
therefore we need not be under any great anxiety as to
? retaining them. As to the quantity of raw cotton sup-
plied by the British possessions for the great trade of this
country, he would only say, that in the year 1860, the last
year in which the cotton manufacture of this country was
working to the full extent of its power, 85 per cent, of
the cotton used in this country was supplied by the States
of America, 8 per cent, by Egypt, and 7 per cent, from
British East and West India ; and, he need not add, that
the worst quality of all came from the East Indies. The
high price of cotton in this country had had the effect of
stimulating a supply from our dependencies; but the
maximum quantity we had received from the East Indies
during the cotton famine had been about one million of
bags in the year. In 1860, the consumption of the cotton
trade of the country was equal to 2} millions of bags ;
therefore, instead of a large per centage of the consump-
tion coming from India under the most favourable cir-
cumstances, we had had only as 1 million to 2� millions.
But about_ the time the American convulsion occurred,
the quantity of cotton did not indicate the quan-
tity which the machinery provided was capable
of consuming; and he believed the augmentation of
machinery in the large establishments would have led to a
consumption of three millions of bags if it could have
been supplied. Thus the maximum supply from the East
Indies of inferior cotton had been equal to only one-third
of the consumption; but the inferiority of that cotton
was such that the moment we could obtain an increased
amount of American, that moment would East Indian
cotton cease to be used. Under these circumstances, there
was no doubt that, unless the resources of the British
colonies were developed so as to compete with the inde-
pendent states of America and Egypt, we could not
obtain large supplies of cotton from our possessions abroad.
Nothing could bo better than the wool of Australia, and
without it he did not hesitate to say a large portion of
the woollen trade could not exist in the West of England


or in Yorkshire. He wished to record the fact that
Australia could supply cotton equal to any produced
in the world. Whether it would be to the interest
of Queensland, Victoria, or the other colonies of Aus-
tralia, to supply it he was not prepared to say ; but it was
certainly one of the resources of our colonial empire yet
to be developed. He thought our colonies must not con-
tinue to depend upon the naval and military establish-
ments of the mother country for the continuance of the
connection with them. It might be very agreeable to
them to see the parade of military life mingling with
every-day business in the colonies, but all this had
hitherto been done at the cost of the people of England;
and the time had arrived when the colonies must not
only look to self-support, but also to self-defence.
Mr. Fbedeeick Hill would only say a word or two
on the important question of transportation. More than
200 years ago Bacon declared that it was a bad and an
unholy thing to plant wicked men in distant climates,
there to multiply in their depravity; and as far as his
personal experience went, the information he had collected
went to show this principle was correct. The colonies
most interested in the question had in the most emphatic
manner denounced transportation to their territories;
therefore we must consider the question virtually settled,
so far as existing colonies were concerned. He would
call attention to the circumstance that, while on
most branches of the subject Mr. Stones had pre-
sented them with an interesting array of facts, yet,
on the subject of transportation he had only theorised.
It had been incidentally stated that the substitution of
lengthened terms of imprisonment for the punishment of
transportation had been a failure. Everyone who knew
what had been done in Ireland must admit it was a most
eminent success. The result of most careful inquiry
showed that the system in this country had only fallen
into disrepute from the miserable manner in which it was
administered. The system of lengthened imprisonment,
which it was argued was impossible without producing
madness, or other evils, had existed, and did exist still,
in Germany and Switzerland without those evils
arising. It was no part of a proper system of im-
prisonment to confine a fellow-creature within four
narrow walls year after year. That was only the pre-
liminary part of the punishment, but afterwards they
.at were treated in a different way, and under good arrange-
ed ments, there was no difficulty in making the criminals sup-
jst port themselves, and thus disposing of them without
is- injury to ourselves or to any distant country. Mr. Stones
r as had recommended the Falkland Islands as the locale for a
et j future experiment in this direction. The locality most
n- resembling that was Norfolk Island, and the depravity
ih- ! that existed there when it was an island full of convicts,
he j and entirely without the element of free labour, was so
to I fearful, that one shuddered at the contemplation of a repe-
th tition of such a state of things. He therefore sincerely
ad hoped that no such experiment would be tried,
d; Tne Chaieman said it was his pleasing duty to propose
lot that the cordial thanks of the meeting be given to Mr.
Stones, for what they must all regard as an unusually able
wo paper. With reference to the remark that had fallen
an from Mr. Crawfurd, that our trade with the colonies
an ought to be of the character of a coasting trade, he might
es, say that practically this was so. With only rare excep-
his tions, there was nothing charged with duty coming from
,ed the colonies, which was not also liable to excise in this
ies country. There was, in fact, the most perfect free
tic trade. Whilst there was an import duty on coffee, which
is ; was a foreign produce, there was a duty also on chicory,
3d, which was of home growth. There was a duty on rum
ild from the West Indies, but the same duty was charged
on on spirits manufactured in this country. The great
re- superiority of the American cotton was to be attributed
et, to three elements?the fine alluvial tracts of the
sd. Southern territories, European enterprise, and African
of muscle. Those, when combined, produced the wonderful
of result of excellent cotton at 6d. to Bd. per lb. With re-
ew gard to Australian cotton, he was afraid it was hopeless to
ost think of it. He was satisfied that the present price
iry of labour there, cotton could not be produced under
ten 6s. per lb. [ Mr. Bazley assured the chairman he was
iras mistaken, lie had grown cotton in Australia, and knew
nt, | differently.] With regard to transportation, he would
ng say the Falkland Islands presented a hnuch larger area
ill, .than Norfolk Island,;and under the system recommended
dls by Mr. Stones they would be acting upon the old plan of
m- convict colonisation. He did not despair of something
)ur being done in these islands.
re- The vote of thanks to Mr. Stones was then passed and
tey acknowledged.

in No. 543, Vol. XX., of the ? Illustrated London News" for January 31, 1852. Since then
more than a Thousand Tons of Gold has heen collected from the Australian Colonies. $| He has
reason to helieve that other Minerals have heen overlooked for want of knowing how to distinguish
them. About five hundred Minerals will be
and some present, many varieties :
Sib, ?I have long thought that the Illustrated London
News might become the means of directing the attention
of gold-searchers to valuable gems often found with that
metal, but possibly thrown aside owing to a non-acquaint-
ance with their appearances in the natural state : 1 there-
fore send the following figures of the natural appearances
of diamonds, corundum, spinel-ruby, garnet, topaz, tour-
maline, beryl, and quartz.
The Diamond. ?Figure lis an octohedron; Figure 2an
octohedron having six planes on the edges; Figure 3,
dodecahedron with rhombic faces ; Figures 4, 5, and 6 are
rarer forms. Out of 1,000 diamonds I have generally
found about one of the form Fig. 6 ; about ten like Fig.
5; fifty like Fig. 4; and the remainder like 1, 2, 3, in
about an. equal proportion. With regard to the size and
weight of diamonds, 500 out of 1,000 which came in the
same parcel were found smaller than Fig. 1, which is the
exact size of a diamond weighing half a carat; 300 were
of the size 3, 4, 5, and 6?none of these exceeded a carat
in modern works on Mineralogy ,
found described
in weight; eighty of the size 2 weighed a carat and a
half; only one was as large as Fig 16 ?this weighed 24
carats. The remainder varied from 2 to 20 carats,
a carat being equal to three grains and one-sixth troy.
Fig. 7 consists of a conglomerated mass of quartz pebbles
rounded through having been water-worn, two crystals of
diamond (one the size of a small pea, the other not larger
than he head of a small pin), and various grains of gold ;
the whole cemented together by oxide of iron. This
specimen is peculiarly interesting at the present time, as
showing the association of diamonds with gold; it was
brought by the late Mr. Mawe from the bed of a river in
Brazil, and there is a reduced figure of it given in his
? Treatise on Gems and Precious Stones,? plate 2 ; and
it is thus described:?? Cascalho: siliceous pebbles,
aggregated and enveloping diamonds.*? He sold it to the
late Duke of Buckingham, and it is now (June, 1865)
in the possession of Mr. Buskin, F.G.S. Mr. Mawe
states that when diamonds were discovered in the


Brazils they were used as counters in playing cards,
the inhabitants being ignorant of their value until
the arrival of an officer who had been in India, and
who, being struck with their geometrical symmetry of
form, took a quantity of them to Portugal, where their
true nature became ascertained. I have recently been in-
formed by two respectable persons from the Brazils, that
in 1844 a slave was searching for gold in the bed of a
river in the province of Bahia, and discovered diamonds.
It being a new locality for diamonds, 297,000 carats were
collected in two years, which produced upwards of �300,000.
I see no reason why diamonds should not be found in
Australia, Canada, California, as well as in those other
gold districts from which they have hitherto been obtained.
The value of the most inferior diamonds, unfit for
jewellery, is �5O per ounce. Could they be found in
sufficient abundance to be sold at �5 per ounce, the benefit
to the arts would be incalculable. Not only would the
seal-engraver, watchmaker, lapidary, glazier, &c., be able
to procure them at easier prices, but numerous substances
would be rendered useful which at present cannot be pro ?
fitably worked owing to the high price of diamonds.
Figures 8 to 11 represent four crystals of Corundum.
This substance is commonly found in six-sided prismatic
crystals, and frequently terminated at each end by six-
sided pyramids. When transparent, and of a blue colour,
it is known in jewellery as the sapphire ; when merely of
a red colour, it is called Oriental ruby; and when this
colour is of a rich depth, the stone is more valuable than
even the diamond.
Figures 12 to 14. Three crystals of Spinel-Ruby. ?lt is
of various shades of red. and is easily distinguished from
corundum by the peculiarity of its crystalline form and
inferior hardness.
Figures 15 and 16. Crystals of Garnet. ?These are
chiefly found in the form of the rhombic dodecahedron ;
are occasionally of a beautiful red colour; when semi-
transparent, are called by the jewellers ?carbuncles.?
They are of comparatively little value.
Figures 17 and 18. Two rhombic prisms of Topaz. ?
It is found in rivers, frequently with all the edges and
angles of the original crystal worn off, and-presenting a
round appearance, in which state it is often mistaken for
the diamond, owing to the colour and specific gravity of
each being the same. It may, however, easily be distin-
guished from it by the difference of the hardness and
fracture, like Fig. 19. The diamond yields readily to
mechanical division parallel to all the planes of the regular
octohedron; the topaz only at right angles to the axis of
the crystal, indicated in Fig. 19 by the darkest straight line
( a ?6), with a smooth brilliant surface, as if polished by the
lapidary ; and slices of it may readily be separated parallel
to the same dark line, each having the same brilliancy.
Fig. 20. Tourmaline.. ?A crystal having six sides, deeply
striated in the longitudinal direction, and terminated by a
three-sided pyramid; colour varying from black to brown
and green. Transparent specimens are useful to the
philosopher in experiments on polarised light.
Fig. 21. Crystal of transparent Quartz or ? Rock
Crystal,? frequently called a ? diamond ? in the mining
districts, as ? Bristol diamond,? ? Cornish diamond,?
&c. The crystal represented by this figure was brought
from California by a person who refused �2OO lor it, under
the impression that it was a real diamond, because it
scratched glass and could not be scratched with a file.
Its real value, however, is not more than 2s. fid. The
crystalline form would at once indicate the difference, and
when broken the fracture would resemble the curved
fracture of broken glass, or waved line on Fig. 19.
No. 22. Beryl, presents a six-sided prism, and is usually
of a green colour.
I have refrained from giving any description of the


chemical composition, relative hardness, specific gravity,
and other characters of minerals, because 1 would not
trespass upon your space, or give information which would
be useful to the scientific reader only.
I remain, yours, &c.,

The Lessons delivered on the subject of Geology are
intended to have especial reference to the important
practical applications of that science to Engineering,
Mining, Architecture, and Agriculture. The Granites,
Syenites, Porphyries, Greenstones, Serpentines, Basalts,
Lavas, Sandstones, Limestones, Clays, &c., will be de-
scribed, and the minerals peculiar to each noticed.
The application of Geology to pursuits connected with
mining operations,?for Coal, Iron, Copper, Tin, Silver,
Gold, Mercury, Antimony, Zinc, Cobalt, &c., will bo
specially considered. The Student is directed how to
proceed in examining a new country ; to collect and re-
cord his observations, and mark his specimens, in order to
render them useful to more experienced geologists at
home.
J. Tennant possesses a well-arranged collection of
Minerals and Rocks, and specimens of Building-stones.
In order more fully to exemplify the applications of the
Science, J. Tennant accompanies his Class to various
Museums in London, including the Museum of Practical
Geology and the British Museum ; also on excursions into
the country, in which the actual field-work of the Geolo-
gist is explained and illustrated. There is an Examina-
tion at the close of the Course, by which the progress of
the students is tested.
