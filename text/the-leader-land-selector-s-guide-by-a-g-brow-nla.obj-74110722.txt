PREFACE.
The land legislation of Victoria, added to, altered, and amended from time to time,,
and contained in numerous Acts of Parliament, is not only in parts conflicting, but
generally difficult for selectors to understand. The time has arrived when there
is a pressing necessity for the simplification and consolidation of the Land Acts ?a
work I have directed to be taken in hand, and which should be completed as soon as
Parliament is afforded an opportunity of further liberalising our land tenures. Mean-
while the Press has been and is doing good work in affording selectors a knowledge of
the recent Land Acts, and the enterprise of ?The Leader? in issuing a popular and reli-
able up-to-date Selectors? Guide is to be highly commended. By the Land Act 1898 and
the Land Act 1900, new tenures have been created, old tenures liberalised, and in-
creased facilities afforded for permanent settlement. The pamphlet describes in
simple and concise form all these leading features, and affords information which
should prove of great assistance to intending selectors and Crown tenants generally.

Commissioner of Crown Lands and Survey.

TO INQUIRERS.
Inquirers at tWLands department should note the following new office rules: ?
All personal inquiries should be made in the first instance to the inquiry office
(ground floor), open daily from 9 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., except on Saturdays, 9 a,m. to 12
noon..
The Minister will be at the department, unless engaged on business in the country,
on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays. Persons desirous of seeing the
Minister should first state their business at the inquiry office.
The Secretary and Surveyor-General may be interviewed on Tuesdays, Wednes-
days, Thursdays and Saturdays only.
Except by special arrangement, deputations to the Minister, the nature of whose
business should be previously intimated, will be received on Tuesdays and Wednes-
days.
When inquiring by letter, selectors should be specially careful to describe fully
the land referred to therein, stating, if possible, the number of allotment and name of
parish.


THE LAND SELECTOR'S GUIDE,
THE LAND ACTS EXPLAINED.
BY A. G. BROWN, B. A, LL.B.,
BARRISTER-AT-LAW.
Now that all the details connected with
the new Land Acts have been completed,
?The Leader? has commissioned the above 1
authority upon the subject to complete a
description of the measures, popularly set
out, as a reliable guide to all interested in
taking up selections. It may be suggested
that this article ought to be read together
with ?The Leader? Land Map published
herewith.
The law relating to the Crown Lands of
Victoria is contained principally in the
Land Act 1869, the Land Act 1890, the Land
Act 1891, the Settlement on Lapds Act 1893,
the Mallee Lands Act 1896, the Land Act
1898, and the Land Act 1900, there being
several amending acts of minor importance.
The Land Act 1869 is inoperative as to fut-
ure selections, but a large number of selec-
tors thereunder have by the Land Act 1898
been granted certain concessions as to pay-
ment of arrears of rent, and are given the
option of converting their present leases
into perpetual leases, and of surrendering
part of and obtaining new leases under for-
mer terms for balance of their holdings. Be-
yond this the selectors of the 1869 Act are
not materially affected by any legislation
embodied in the subsequent Land Acts. The
Land Act 1890 effected a consolidation of
the Mallee Pastoral Leases Act 1883 and
the Land Act 1884. The Mallee Act 1896
permitted selection of agricultural holdings
under licence or perpetual lease in the mal-
lee country where, hitherto, selection had
only been provided for in a tentative meas-
ure under whiph a limited number of licen-
ces were issued. Under the Land Act 1884
(now embodied in the Land Act 1890) the
numerous and well known 42nd section
agricultural licences were issued as well as
the 32nd section grazing leases.
CLASSIFICATION.
The whole of the unalienated lands be-
longing to the Crown have been divided into
classes. The principal classes indicated on
the map are as follow: ?
1. Good agricultural land.
2. Partly agricultural and partly grazing.
3. Grazing lands.
4. Pastoral lands (large areas).
5. Auriferous lands.
6. Mallee ?
Mallee land now available.
Mallee land which will revert to the
Crown, in 1903.
7. Timber reserves.
8. Land which may be sold by auction.
9. Agricultural endowments.
The total area (including timber and all
other reserves) classified embraces upwards
of 17,500,000 acres. The total area of the
colony contains 56,245,760 acres, (See spec-
ial reference to mallee classification under
separate heading.)
ODASSIPI CATION BOARDS.
Boards consisting of three members each
have been appointed for reclassifying Crown
lands. The present classification may, for
sufficient reasons, be altered, but no altera-
tion can be made in the classification of any
land after any application to select such
land has been granted.
WHO MAY SELECT.
Any person who is of the age of 18 years
may select a ?grazing area? under lease, or
an agricultural allotment, or a ?grazing al-
lotment? under licence or perpetual lease,
or a mallee agricultural allotment under li-
cence or perpetual lease. Married as well


single women may now be granted selec-
tions.
AREA OF SELECTIONS.
The areas allowed are 200 acres of first
class land, or 320 acies of second class land,
under agricultural licence or perpetual lease;
or 640 acres of third class land, under ?graz-
ing allotment? licence or perpetual lease.
Grazing area lessees may, including any
land already selected, hold 200 acres of first
class land, or 640 acres of second class land,
or 1280 acres of third class land. Any land
previously selected is regarded as third class
land irrespective of its quality. Mallee
selectors are limited to 640 acres of first
class land, 1000 acres of second class land,
1280 acres of third class land, and 1600 acres
of fourth class land.
FIRST CLASS LAND.
In the first class there are approximately
140,807 acres available for selection, 560
acres of reserves which may be made avail-
able, and 165,744 acres subject to grazing
area leases, making a total of 307,111 acres.
The greater portion of the first class com-
prises the elevated lands forming the Ot-
way, South Gippsland, Bass and the Upper
Yarra Ranges, and consists for the most part
of good chocolate soil of volcanic origin,
and the grey soil of the coal bearing coun-
try. These areas aie heavily timbered. The
price for the freehold will be �1 per acre,
to be selected under agrieu'tural licence. Se-
lection may also be by perpetual lease.
SECOND CLASS LAND.
The second class comprises ?partly agri-
cultural and partly grazing lands.? The ap-
proximate area available, excluding that sub-
ject to grazing leases, is 340,829 acres, area
of reserves which may be made available
10,622 acres, and area subject to grazing
leases 544,433 acres, making a total of 895,884
acres. This land is to be found distributed
throughout the colony. It comprises Silu-
rian and'granite ranges and lower lands of
tertiary formation. A large portion of this
land has chiefly a grazing value, though
parts, comprising creek flats and gullies, are
suitable for cultivation. Much, however, is
especially adapted for vineyards and or-
chards. The price of the freehold will be
15/ per acre, to be selected under agricul-
tural licence; or selection may be by per-
petual lease.
THIRD, CLASS LAND.
The third class comprises the ?grazing
lands.? The area under this class is very
extensive, and amounts approximately to
1,901,530 acres, which are available for se-
lection, 1467 acres of reserves, which may-
be made available, and 2,611,028 acres,
subject to grazing area leases, making a
total of 4,514,025 acres. This land is chiefly
to be found in the counties of Benambra,
Delatite and Bogong, in the North-eastern
district; Buln Buln and Tangil, in Gipps-
land; Anglesey and Dalhousie, in the cent-
ral district; Bprung and Bo wan in the
North-western district, and lieytesbury,
Normanby, To Jett and Dundas, in the
Western district. It consists principally of
Silurian country, poor granite country,,
lightly timbered, sandy and open plain
countiy. It is essentially grazing land, and
the whole, except a small percentage, could
be turned to no other profitable use. The
price of the freehold will be 10/ per acre,
to be selected under ?grazing allotment??
licence, or selection may be under perpetual
lease tenure.
HOW SELECTED.
AGRICULTURAL LICENCE AM) LEASE.
The established system of selecting is by
agricultural licence and lease, but import-
ant changes have, however, been made re-
cently. Agricultural licences (residential
or non-residential) are confined to first and
second class land only. The selector may
now, in the case of first class land, take a
residential licence for six years, and, upon
the expiration thereof, a lease for either
14 years or 34 years at 1/ per
acre and 6d. per aicne per annum
respectively; and in the case of
second class land, a residential licence for
sic years, and, upon the expiration
thereof, a lease for either 14 years or 34
years at 9d. per acre and per acre
per annum respectively. Instead of a resi-
dential licence, there may he issued to the
selector a non-residential licence for six
years, and upon the expiration thereof,
a lease for 14 years at 1/ or 6d. per acre per
annum, according to whether the land is-
first or second class. In the case of a resi-
dential licence, the land, ' according to
whether it is first or second class, must,
during the currency of the licence be im-
proved to the extent of 20/ or 15/ an
acre, and in the case of non-
residential licences, if the land is
first class, improvements * must be
effected to the extent of 6/8 per
acre per annum during each year of the
licence; and, if second class, to the extent of
5/ per acre per annum during the first
three years of the licence. The Crown


grant of the land may be issued at any time
after the expiration of the licence upon pay-
ment of the difference between the amount
of rent actually paid and the sum of �1
and 15/ in the case of first and second
class land respectively.
GRAZING ALLOTMENT LICENCES.
The grazing allotment licence (residential
or non-residential) is a new tenure applying
to third class lands only, and must not be
confused with grazing area leases or annual
grazing licences. The selector may be grant-
ed a residential ?grazing allotment licence?
for six years, and, upon the expiration
thereof, a lease for either 14 years or 34
years at 6d. per acre or 3d. per acre per an-
num accordingly; or a non-residential ?graz-
ing allotment licence? for six years, and,
upon the expiration thereof, a lease for 14
years at 6d. per acre per annum. In the
ease of residential ?grazing allotment
licences,? the land must, during the cur-
rency of the licence be improved to the ex-
tent of 10/ per acre; and in the case of non-
residential grazing allotment licences, the.
land must during the first three years of
the licence be improved to the extent of
3/4 per acre per annum.
PERPETUAL LEASES.
The system of perpetual leasing, first ap-
plied in this colony in 1896 to mallee lands,
is now in force in respect of Crown lands
generally. In lieu of selecting under agri-
cultural or grazing allotment licence, the
selector may obtain a perpetual lease of his
selection. The annual rental is �1 5/ per
centum (i.e., 3d. in the pound), on the value
of the land, the rental value of the land till
1909 being �1 per acre first class, 15/ per
acre second class and 10/ per acre third
class. The rent is subject to revision every
10 years, but must not exceed 3d. in the
. � 61 the unimproved value of the land.
The perpetual lease is subject to a condi-
tion that the lessee shall reside for six
months on the land or within five miles
thereof during the first year, and eight
months during each of the four following
years, provided that if he cultivate one-
fourth during the first two years and one :
half before the end of the fourth year the
residence covenant shall not operate. Im-
provements must be effected to the value
of 10/ per acre first class, 7/6 per acre se-
cond class and 5/ per acre third class land
before the end of the third year, and, fur-
ther improvements to the value of 10/ per
acre first class, 7/6 per acre second class and
5/ per acre third class land before the end
of the sixth year of the lease.
GRAZING AREA LEASES.
Under section 32 of the Land Act 1890
grazing area leases were granted for a term
of years, expiring 29th December, 1898, at an
annual rental of not less than 2d., nor more
than 4d. per acre. By the Land Act 1898
their leases were extended to 29th De-
cember, 1899, and by the Land Aot 1900,
save as to those in respect of which appli-
cations tor new leases or selections had been
made before the 29th December, 1899, were
further extended till the 31st December,
1900. All the old grazing area leases, with-
out -exception, will have expired by 31st De-
cember, 1900. By section 29 of the Land
Act 1898, this class of tenure is to be con-
tinued, and leases of grazing areas of first,
second or third class land will be issued for
any term of years, expiring not later than
the 291h December, 1920. No such lease can
be granted for more than 200 acres of finsc
class land, or 640 acres of second class land,
or 1280 acres of third class land. The annual
rent is, first class land, 3d. per acre; second
class land, 2d. per acre; and third class land,
Id. per acre. The lease cannot be assigned
or sub-let without permission from the
Lands department. The grazing area
lessees under the Land Act 1890 have a
prior claim to new leases of their grazing
areas and to bake selections thereout.
PASTORAL LANDS.
The fourth class comprises the pas-
toral lands. The total area amounts to
5,508,638 acres in various parts of the colony.
A good deal of this land is difficult of access,
being situated in the high altitudes where
cultivation is impossible, and grazing im-
practicable, except during lire summer
months. At present there are some 73 pas-
toral lessees holding upwards of 1,000,000
acres, whose expired tenures can be ex-
tended with the approval of the Minister
of. Lands, till 31st December, 1900. The pre-
sent pastoral tenants may, at the discretion
of the Lands Department, have new leases
granted them, expiring not later than 29th
December, 1909. Pastoral leases of not less
than 1280 acres may be issued to new ap-
plicants for any term of vears, expiring not
later than the said date, the rental being
computed at 1/ per head of sheep and 5/ per
head of cattle, number of same to be deter-
mined according to the grazing capacity of
the pastoral allotment. Pastoral allotments
may be resumed by the Crown on giving
two years? notice so to do.


AURIFEROUS LANDS.
GRAZING LICENCES.
The classified auriferous lands of the Co-
lony comprise 1.435,520 acres. These lands,'
for the most part, are suitable for grazing
purposes. They may be licensed (section 67
Land Act. 1890) under grazing licences re-
newable annually at the option of the licen-
see for a period expiring not later than the
291h December, 1905. Not more than 1000
acres can be licensed to any one person. The
rent is fixed by appraisement. The licensee
may, with the consent of the Minister for
Mines, fence in his holding, but it is spe-
cially provided that miners are to be per-
mitted access to these areas at all times foi
mining purposes, and without being liable
for any damage caused through mining ope-
rations. The licence can be transferred.
RESIDENCE OR CULTIVATION LICENCES.
Annual licences (section 65 Land Act
1890) may be issued for areas not exceeding
20 acres, which entitle the holders thereof
to reside on or cultivate the land on pay-
ment of an annual licence fee at the rate of
1/ per acre. No person can hold more than
one such licence. When he has paid rents
amounting to the assessed value of the land,
the licensee is to be charged onlv a nominal
annual rental of 2/6. For more detailed in-
formation as to auriferous lands see special
treatment under headiing ?Auriferous Lands
Settlement.?
LANDS FOR SALE BY AUCTION.
Lands which may be sold by auction (not
including swamp or reclaimed lands) com-
prise upwards of 32,510 acres. The condi-
tions of sale provide that 124 per cent, of
the purchase money must be paid as a de-
posit, the balance being payable in 40 (or a
lesser number of) half yearly instalments.
Transfer of the interest.of any-purchaser of 1
an allotment may prior to final payment of
the purchase money be permitted, on pay-
ment of a fee of 10/.
SWAMP LANDS.
Swamp or reclaimed lands, consisting
of 73,400 acres, have been specially legislated
for. The best known of these lands are
situate at Kooweerup, Moe, Greta, Bran-
keet and Condah: and of these Kooweerup,
Moe and Condah have been reclaimed at a
considerable cost by the Government. They
contain, however, some of the finest land in
the colony. . Swamp or reclaimed lands may
be disposed of in allotments in four ways: ?
(1) On a2l years? lease (section 85 of the
Land Act 1890), the right to lease being
offered at public auction; (2) under a per-
petual lease, the rent being fixed at 4 per
cent, on the value of the land; (3) under a
conditional purchase lease, payment being
made over a period not exceeding 314 years
by 03, or a lesser number ot instalments,
. each instalment including interest at M per
cent, on the balance of the unpaid purchase
money; (4) by public auction, on similar
terms and conditions as in the sale of other
Crown lands that may be sold at auction.
No allotment can exceed 100 acres, and
every lease or contract of sale of an allot-
ment of swamp or reclaimed lands shall con-
tain a condition that the lessee or purchaser
shall make improvements on the leased or
purchased land to the value of 10/ an acre
in each of the first three years fiom date of
lease or sale. Lessees of swamp oi re-
claimed lands are not required to reside on
their allotments.
ANNUAL GRAZING LICENCES.
Grazing licences to enter with cattle or
sheep upon reserves or other Crown lands
may be issued annually tor a period not ex-
ceeding seven years, but may be cancelled at
any time during that period. Holders of
grazing licences at the commencement of the
Land Act 1898 may be granted a renewal of
licences at a price to be fixed by an ap-
praiser. At the request of the licensee
(when the land is not auriferous) the Minis-
ter of Lands may permit the construction of
dams or tanks on the area, or the whole or
part of the licensed area to be fenced. The
fence will remain, the property of the licen-
see, and may be removed by him during the
currency or upon the expiration of his
licence. In the event of the land being se-
lected, the grazing licensee shall not be en-
titled to any compensation, but he m&y
claim from a new incoming grazing licensee
a valuation (to be fixed by the Lands de-
partment) for his improvements, such value
not to exceed 5/ per acre for the first 1000
acres, and 2/6 per acre after the first 1000
acres. Lands held under grazing licences
are rateable under the Local Government
Acts on the annual rental thereof.


THE MALLEE.
LANDS NOW AVAILABLE.
LANDS WHICH WILL REVERT TO THE CROWN
1903.
The mallee country?so named from the
prevailing scrub found growing there ?oc-
cupies some 11,500,000 acres of the extreme
north-west portion of the colony. The
scrub can be cleared off at a moderate
cost, and the land is adapted for wheat-
growing and grazing.
The mallee lands are specially dealt with
under several acts; but the now more im-
portant provisions are contained in the
Mallee Lands Act 1896, the Land Act 1898
and the Land Act 1900. The greater por-
tion of the mallee is held in large areas, un-
der leases expiring in* 1903. There are about
2,000,000 acres available for occupation in
the mallee. The Crown has during the
past few years resumed upwards of 368,000
acres of the better quality leasehold lands
for settlement as agricultural allotments.
In 1903. the year in which the mallee block
and allotment leases expire, there will be,
including resumptions or selections that
may take place in the meantime, about
7,500,000 acres available to be dealt with
under the Mallee Lands Act 1896, as amend-
ed by the Land Act 1898 and the Land Act
1900.
GLASSIFICATION OF THE MALLEE.
Land in the mallee is divided into four
classes:?First class land, �1 per acre;
second class, 15/ per acre; third class, 10/
per acre: and fourth-class, 5/ per acre.
AREA OF SELECTIONS.
Including any mallee land previously selec-
ted, the selector may obtain 640 acres of first
class land, or 1000 acres of second class land,
or 1280 acres of third class land, or 1600
acres of fourth class land.
HOW SELECTED.
Selection in the mallee may be by agricul-
tural licence (residential or non-residential)
and lease, or by perpetual leasehold tenure.
j The seiectoi may in respect of any of the
(four classes obtain a residential licence for
| six years, and, upon the expiration thereof,
a lease for either 14 years or 34 years, pay-
ing rental according to whether the lease is
for the longer or shorter period, in the case
of first class land 1/, or 6d. per acre per an-
num; in the case of second class land 9d., or
4�d. per . acre per annum; in Uie case of
third class land 6d., or 3d. per acre per an-
num, and in the case of fourth class land
Sd., or lid. acre per annum. Instead of a
residential licence there may be issued to
the selector, if he so desires, a non-residen-
tial licence for six years, and, upon the ex-
piration thereof, a lease for 14 years, in
which case he does not have the advantage
of the easier payments of rentals. As to im-
provements under residential licences, first,
second, third and fourth class land must,
during the currency of the licence, be im-
proved to the extent of �l, 15/,. 10/ and 5/
per acre respectively; and, under non-resi-
dential licences, first class land must be im-
proved to the extent of 6/8 per acre each
year during the currency of the licence, and
in the case of second, third and fourth class
land to the extent of 5/, 3/4 and 1/8 per acre
respectively in each year of the first three
years of the licence. The Crown grant for
the land may be issued at any time after the
expiration of the licence upon payment of
the difference between the amount of rent
actually paid and the value of the land ac-
cording to its classification.
PERPETUAL LEASES.
In lieu of selecting under agricultural li-
cence, the selector may obtain a perpetual
lease of his selection. The annual rental to
Ist December, 1903, will not exceed 2d. per
acre, and thereafter will not exceed 25/ per
centum (3d. in the pound) of the unim-
proved value of the land. Perpetual lessees
who select out of existing mallee allotment
leases may at any time transfer, assign or
mortgage their leases, but perpetual lessees
who obtain their selections out of mallee
lands available to the public generally can-
not legally transfer, assign or mortgage
their leases until after six years from the
date thereof.


GENERAL PROVISIONS.
FAMILY SELECTION.
Any lessee of a ?grazing area? or mallee
allotment may be allowed to surrender an>
Dart of h's holding to his wife or any child
ove-r 18 years of age, and thereupon such
wife or child will be allowed the exclusive
right to select such surrendered part.
ANTE-DATING LICENCES AND LEASES.
Any lessee of a ?grazing area? or ?mallee
allotment,? who selects thereout the whole
or part under licence or perpetual lease,
may have his licence or perpetual lease
dated back, so as to obtain credit for any
occupation (residence on or within five
miles) of his holding, and will be entitled
to receive credit for any rent paid under hia.
?grazing area? or ?mallee allotment? lease
in respect of the selected area from the date
the 1 cence or perpetual lease is actually
dated to the date of its issue.
SALE OF DETACHED STRIPS.
Detached strips of Crown land, not ex-
ceeding 20 acres in extent, may be pur-
chased by the owner of an adjoining free-
hold at a valuation; and isolated portions
of Crown lands, not exceeding 50 acres in
extent, may be sold at auction.
OCCUPATION CONDITIONS.
At times great d fficulty and frequently
serious loss have been experienced by selec-
tors in regard to the occupation conditions
of their tenures. Occupation is defined as
residence on or within five miles of the
land selected. It has been recently enacted
that the occupation condition, when the
home of the family of the selector is upon
the land, may, subject to the approval of
the Lands department, be complied with
by the selector?s wife, or any specified child
over 18 years of age (or, if he has no wife
or chi id over such age, then by his father
or mother, if dependent upon him). A
married woman, who selects, must, subject
to the foregoing exceptions, comply in per-
son with the occupation condition of her li-
cence or lease; but a woman, who selects
twelve months prior to her marriage, may
be relieved of the occupation condition of
her licence or lease. A licensee may be al-
lowed to absent himself from his selection
for three months in each year of the cur-
rency of his residential licence.
SURVEYS. .
The fees for country surveys depend upon
the nature of the country to be surveyed,
and range from �1 14/ for an area of three
acres up to �2O for an area of 1280 acres.
When the cost of surveying an area exceeds
the sum of �5, if �5 be paid by the appli-
cant towards the cost, the payment of the
oalance of the fee may be made by equal
half yearly instalments extending over the
term of six years, in the case of the selec-
tion of a portion of a grazing area, sur-
rendered by a lessee to his wife or child,only
two-thirds of the prescribed fees will be
charged for necessary further surveys.
Every purchaser at auction must pay, for an
allotment containing 20 acres or a sur-
vey fee of �l, but for an allotment contain
mg an area in excess of 20 acres, a survey
fee at the rate of 1/ per acre.
FENCING.
The law relating to fences, so far as it
concerns the selector, is to be found in the
Land Acts and the Fences Act 1890. A
sufficient fence within the meaning of the
Fences Act is practically any fence capable
of resisting cattle and sheep. The occu-
piers of adjoining lands not divided by a
sufficient fence are liable to join in or
contribute to the construction of a divid-
ing fence between such lands in equal pro-
portions, and when any such dividing fence
shall be out of repair, such occupiers shall
be liable to the cost of repairing such fence
in equal proportions. These provisions,
however, do not prevent any contract or
agreement being entered into between the
occupiers of adjoining lands in regard to
fencing.
IMPOUNDING.
The law relating to impounding is con-
tained in the Land Acts and Pounds Act.
Selectors cannot impound cattle off un-
fenced selections, but the occupier of any
land trespassed on by cattle may restore the
same to the owner thereof,, and demand
trespass damages. In the event of non-pay-
ment, such damages may be recovered in a
summary way before any two justices from
the owner of such cattle.
GARDEN. BUTTER FACTORY AND OTHER
SITES.
Holders for five years of garden licences
and of sites for butter factories, creamer es,
inns, stores, smithies or similar buildings
not within a city, town or township, may,
if the conditions of the licences have been
complied with, purchase such sites, at a
price to be determined by an appraiser, all
rents paid during the currency of the li-
cence to be credited towards the purchase
money. No licensee shall be allowed to pur-
chase more than one such site.


CLOSER SETTLEMENT.
The latest innovation in the land legisla-
tion of the colony is embodied in part 111.
of the Land Act 1898, whereby the Crown is
empowered to acquire from private owners
good agricultural land for the purpose of
subdivision for closer settlement.
FARM ALLOTMENTS.
The portion of 'the resumed land to be
made availab.e must be subdivided into farm
allotments of a value not exceeding �1250
each. Any person of the age of 21 years,
who is not already the holder of land of the
value of �1250 (township land excepted),
or who would not thereby become the
holder of land exceeding such value, may be
granted a farm allotment under a condi-
tional purchase lease, but not more than
one farm allotment can be held by any one
person.
HOW APPLIED FOR.
An application for a farm allotment
must be made on the proper form, obtain-
able* from the Lands department, and must
be accompanied by a deposit equal to the
first two instalments of the purchase
money.
PURCHASE MONEY.
The price of the farm allotment is pay-
able, with interest at 4� per cent., by 63 or
a less number of half yearly instalments.
A table of instalments is drawn up
for the guidance of applicants, and each in-
stalment will include interest on the bal-
ance of the unpaid purchase money.
THE CONDITIONAL PURCHASE LEASE.
The conditional purchase lease of a farm
allotment will be for a term not exceeding
3U years, as may be agreed upon. The
conditions of the lease provide that im-
provements must be effected to the value
of 10/ an acre before the end of the third
year of the lease, and to the value of a fur-
ther 10/ an acre before the end of the sixth
year of the lease. Either the lessee or his
wife, or any child not less than 18 years of
age, must reside on the allotment for 8
months during each year of the first 6 years,
during which time the lessee cannot trans-
fer, assign, mortgage or sub-let his allot-
ment.
CROWN GRANT.
Upon or at any time after the expiration
of the first 6 years of the lease, the grant of
the fee simple of the allotment may be
issued to the lessee on payment of the bal-
ance of the purchase money.
STATE FORESTS, UMBER RESERVES .AND
WATER RESERVES.
The State Forests will comprise
approximately 4,246,900 acres, the
limber reserves 343,243 acres, and
the water reserves 280,158 acres. Annual
grazing licences may be issued in respect of
these areas. Bona fide settlers in State
forests who have been 5 years in occupation
of their sites, and who have made improve-
ments thereon of not less than �2 an* acre,
are allowed to purchase 10 acres at a price
fixed by the Lands Department; or, if min-
ing objections exist to the alienation of such
sites, then the occupants can obtain annual
licences therefor similar to the 65th section
licences of auriferous land under tiie Land
Act 1890.
AGRICULTURAL AND EDUCATION ENDOW-
MENT RESERVES.
These areas are set apart for agricultural
college and State educational purposes. The
former amount to 155,483 acres, and the
latter to 1,592,400 acres.
IMPORTANT REMINDERS.
GRAZING AREA LESSEES.
All grazing area leases under the 32nd sec-
tion of the. Land Act 1890 (known as brown
blocks) in respect of which before the 29th
December, 1899, new applications have been
made for grazing area leases under section
29 of the Land Act 1898, or for agricultural
or grazing aMctmen'ts under licence or per-
petual lease, expired on the 29th day of De-
cember, 1899.
All the grazing area leases in respect of
which, however, no new applications were
made before the 29th day of December, 1899,.
will expire on the 31st day of December,
1900. With regard to these it is most impor-
tant to the present lessees to remember that
if they desire to apply for new grazing area
leases or to take out selections they must
send in their applications before the 31st
day of December, 1900, otherwise their graz-
ing areas will revert to the Crown, and will
have to be made available for selection to
the public generally.
The grazing lessee who applies either for a
new' grazing area lease or for a selection
either under licence or perpetual lease.
Land Acts 1898 and 1900, is entitled to se-
veral special privileges.
Firstly, in the case of his requiring a new
grazing area lease, if he has been a bona fide
holder, fulfilling the conditions of his lease,
or has improved his grazing area to an ex-
tent exceeding 5/ per acre, he may be gran


ted a new lease, and if he is unable to pay
all rental due under his expired or expiring
lease, he may obtain permission to pay the
same by instalments extending over a period,
not exceeding six years. It will be noticed
that the lessee gets not only a prior right
over all comers to take but a new grazing
area lease, but also the advantage of enter-
ing into an agreement to have his present
arrears of rent, which he is unable to pay
forthwith, made payable by easy instal-
ments during the first six years of the cur-
rency of his new lease. He has also the
right to select at any time dilring the cur-
rency of his lease, and has the special advan-
tages bf ?family selection/? already ex-
plained, extended to him during the same
period.
Secondly, in the case of the lessee taking
out of a selection, either under licence or
perpetual lease, if he has occupied his area,
he may have his licence or perpetual lease
dated from the Ist day of January or the
Ist day of July in the half year in which he
commenced continuous occupation. In the
event of the occupation (i.e., residence on
or within 5 miles of the land) not having
been continuous, the licence or perpetual
lease may be dated from the Ist day of Janu-
ary or the Ist day of July in any year, so as
to cover in the aggregate the periods of oc-
cupations. The lessee will also receive credit
for improvements and for any rent paid by
him under his lease in respect of the land
selected during the period from the date of
the licence to the date of its issue. The ef-
fect is to enable a lessee who has been six
years in occupation - , and has effected im-
provements according to the classification
of his land, to get his agricultural lease
forthwith, all rents paid under grazing area
lease for past six years to be credited
towards the fee simple. Before agricultural
lease issues, the lessee will be required to
pay the difference between the rent under
licence and the rent under the grazing
lease. If, for instance, he selects 320 acres
of third class land on 40 years? term, for
which he has been paying at the
rate of 2d. per acre per annum
under grazing area lease (for which
he gets credit), he will only have
to pay a sum down calculated at the rate
of Id. per acre per annum to liquidate rent
due under licence to enable him to obtain
his negotiable lease.
AGRICULTURAL LICENSEES.?RESI-
DENTIAL.
Any residential licensee of an agricultural
allotment may apply for permission to sur-
render his licence if it was current at the
passing of the Land Act 1898 (i.e., the 20th
December, 1898), in order to have his selec-
tion classified and to obtain a licence under
the more favorable conditions under the
Land Acts 1898 and 1900.. (See description
.of.licences, already given.) Application must
be made before 'the 30th June,l9oo, to enable
the licensees ,to avail themselves of the
privilege of having their selections classified,
but this date will probably be extended.
Rent paid under the old licence will be cre-
dited to the new licence and lease, and cre-
dit will be given for occupation and im-
provements effected under the surrendered
licence. There is this further concession,
that, if there is any rent due under the old
licence it may be spread over the term of
the new licence. These itre yery liberal ad-
vantages. Licensees under the Land Act
1890 are charged the uniform price of �1
per acre, at 1/ per acre per annum, even
should the land be in point of fact ordinary
third class land, and the licensee coming
under the new Land Acts, instead of paying
�1 per acre, will in such case only be re-
quired to pay 10/ per acre for the tee simple
of his land, at the rate, on the 40 years?
term, of 3d. per acre per annum, and simi-
larly in the case of the second class. He
may find himself in the happy position of
realising that his rents, instead of being in
arrears, are paid in advance, to say nothing
of the great reduction in the price of the
fee simple.
NON-RESIDENTIAL- LICENSEES.
Non-residential licensees whose licences
were current on the 20th December, 1898,
are also entitled to the same concession
(except 40 years? term) as above, and by
taking out new licences under the Land
Act 1898 they will only be required
to pay for the land according to its
classification. The price of the fee simple
of the land selected under non-residence li-
cences under the Land Act 1890 is �2 per
acre. Non-residential licensees should take
notice that in their cases also the privilege
of surrendering their licences for new licen-
ces, and of having their lands classified, only
extends up to 30till June, 1900, but it is prob-
able an extension of time will be granted
to make applications.
AGRICULTURAL LESSEES.
Agricultural lessees should not overlook
a special concession in respect of the post-
ponement of arrears of rent. Any lessee
may, if his lease w r as in force at the com-
mencement of the Land Act 1898 (i.e., Ist


July, 1899), apply before the 30th June,
1900, for postponement, until after the ex-
piration of the term of his lease, of payment
of all rent due by him on the Ist July, 1899;
and if he is not in a position to pay such ar-
rears of rent, his application may. be gran-
ted, and the term of the lease may be* exten-
ded for a period not longer than the
for which there are arrears of rent on the
Ist July, 1899. The lessee is not even to be
charged interest in respect of any rent the
payment of which is postponed.
FORMER SELECTORS.
In determining the area of land any per-
son may select or take up as an agricultural
or grazing allotment, or grazing area under
the Land Act 1898, any land previously se-
lected by him will be regarded' as equal; to
third class land, irrespective of its quality,
but this does not apply to the mallee, as
the classification of any land previously se-
lected an the mallee must be taken into
account as fixed by the classifiers. The
reason of this difference is because
the whole of the selections in the
mallee have had to' be classified,
whereas no selections outside the/
mallee have had to be classified except in
respect of those licensees whose licen-
ces were current at the passing of the Land
Act 1898 (20th December, 1898), and only
when the licensees have made the neces-
sary application for classification.
PERPETUAL LEASES FOR LICENCES.
Any licensee or lessee of an agricultural
or grazing allotment may obtain in lieu
thereof a perpetual lease at a rental
not exceeding 3d. in the pound on
unimproved value of the land, and may
be credited with past occupation and
improvements, as in compliance with
conditions of new lease. Arrears of
rent under original licence or lease may
be paid by easy instalments without
interest.
ABANDONMENT OF PART OF AREA.
Grazing area lessees or licensees or lessees
of agricultural or ?grazing? allotments may
be allowed to surrender-parts of their hold-
ings hnd obtain new' grazing area*'- leases or
new agricultural or ??grazing'?- allotment
licences of leases?for the reduced Im-
provements on the portion retained will be
Credited as well as any former occupation in
respect thereof. Rents due in respect of the
surrendered portion of an agricultural or
grazing allotment may be remitted if ?ithe
licensee or lessee has received no substantial-
benefit therefrom. These provisions also ap-
ply to the holders of an agricultural allot-
ment in the mallee.
MALLEE ALLOTMENT LESSEES.
The rental to be paid for a mallee allot-
ment for the clearing and cultivating of
which consent has been given by the Board
of Land and Works is Id. per acre from the
Ist July, 1897. Where the lessee of a mallee
allotment by inadvertence failed to obtain
the previous consent in writing of the Board'
of Lands and Works to the making before
20th February, 1896, of improvements on
his allotment, he shall nevertheless be en-
titled .'to be paid by any incoming 'tenant
the reasonable value of such improvements.
FORMS OF APPLICATIONS.
There are numerous forms of application
relating to the taking up of grazing areas,
the selecting of agricultural and grazing al-
lotments, transfers, mortgages, liens,. &c.,
used in connection with the various leading
provisions of the Land Act. Any particular
form will be furnished on a personal or
written application to any Land Officer, who
will give advice, if required, as to the man-
ner in which it should be filled in and com-
pleted.


AURIFEROUS LANDS SETTLEMENT.
The interests of the land selectors and the
miners are so often in conflict that there
are numerous appeals for advice from time
to time. This conflict in which mining land
matters are concerned is often disheart-
ening bo the man who would make a com-
fortable little home on a small area of
ground on or in the vicinity of our
gold fields. Not infrequently does an
over zealousness on the part of
the mining boards result in injury to
the miner himself, who desires to ob-
tain a home by securing a plot of land
Tinder say section 65 of the Land Act 1890,
where he might spend his time profitably
between spells of other work.
LICENCES UNDER THE 65th SEC-
TION.
First in point of importance come the
65th section licences. There are some 4000
licensees under section 65 of the Land
Act 1890 holding areas of from 3 to 20 acres
on an annual tenure. The annual licence
(section 651 can only be issued in respect
of land that is classified as ?auriferous
lands,?-not exceeding 20 acres in extent,
and entitles the holders thereof to reside on
or cultivate the land on payment of an an-
nual licence fee at the rate of 1/ per acre;
provided, however, that when the area is
under 10 acres, but over 3 acres, there is
charged a uniform annual licence fee of 10/'.
In addition to the annual licence fee a
charge of 2/6 is made for the annual licence.
No person can hold more than one such
licence.
APPLICATIONS.
Every applicant for a licence under sec-
tion 65 must affix to a post or other conspi-
cuous object, at or near each corner of the
allotment applied for, a legible notice in
writing, setting forth that he is an appli-
cant for such allotment, the approximate
area thereof, his name and address, and
date of his thus marking out the land, and
must make application in the form pre-
scribed, obtainable from any ] and office. Th?
application fee is now 5/. The application
must next be dealt with by a local land
board, before which the applicant must ap-
pear in person, or to which, it he is the only
applicant, he may forward a statement on a
prescribed form. Transfers, provided con-
ditions of licence have been complied with,
are allowed to eligible transferees, fee for
transfer being 10/.
CONDITIONS OF LICENCES.
The following are briefly the conditions
of the licence; ?Right to use the surface of
the land only; licensee not to assign or sub-
let without permission of the Minister for
Lands; licensee either to reside on or fence
the land within four months from date of
licence, and cultivate one-fifth of the area;
save as to any portion occupied by build-
ings, miners to have free access to any part
of the licensed land without making any
compensation to the licensee for surface or
other damage: and notices to be posted by
the licensee on the land indicating that it
is auriferous. In addition to having to keep
posted at conspicuous places notices to the
effect that the land is licensed under sec-
tion 65 of the Land Act 1890, the licensee
is required to paint in red color his corner
posts and gate posts 1 foot from the ground
to the top of the posts, to indicate that the
land is available to the miner.
From the foregoing it will be seen that
very . considerable publicity is attached to
the making of an application under section
65. It is competent for the mining board
to step in and take the initiative in oppos-
ing the granting of the aplication, but in
practice all applications under section 65
come under the notice of the Mines depart-
ment. The local adviser of the Mines de-
partment is the mining board, and it
may urge reasons why, in its opinion, the
application should not be granted. It is
competent for the Mines or Lands
department to overrule the objec-
tions of the mining board, but
this is not frequently done. There are
many complaints that the mining boards
unreasonably throw obstacles in the way of
miners and others obtaining small holdings
on our gold fields, more especially in face
of the stringent conditions in favor of min-
ing set forth in the licence, which confers
no title or claim to the fee simple.
That the licensee should for year after
year be confined to such a precarious ten-
ure has been long urged by him as a hard-
ship. Under similar tenures under former
Land Acts, the licensee, provided he suc-
ceeded in getting mining objections (if any)
removed, was enabled to purchase his hold-
ing, rents paid in connection therewith to
go towards the purchase of the fee simple.
The Legislature refused only recently to
grant this concession to licensees under sec-
tion 65 of the Land Act 1890, but at the in


stance of the present Minister of Lands
section 90 of the Land Act 1890 was passed,
providing this advantage that any holder of
a licence under section 65 of the Land Act
1890, when he deems he has paid rents equal
to the value of the land, may apply to have
the value thereof appraised, and provided
such value has been paid, the annual licence
fee will be reduced to 2/6 and the annual
licence will be issued free of charge.
ALLOTMENT LICENCES.
It frequently happens that ordinary lands
available for selections, though not classed
technically as ?auriferous lands,? are con-
sidered or proved by the Mines department
to be auriferous, and, in such cases, a protest
in the interests of the mining industry is
lodged against their alienation in fee simple.
In the past, such land was allowed to be
taken up under grazing area leases. How-
ever, by section 89 of the Land Act 1898,
ordinary Crown lands, though auriferous,
may be alienated, subject to very stringent
conditions in respect of mining. The effect
of these conditions may be thus briefly
stated, that neither the licensee nor anyone
claiming through or under him shall be en :
titled to any compensation in respect of
damage to be done to the land selected or
any improvements thereon by mining, and
he must place upon the outside of the corner
posts distinguishing marks to indicate that
the land is auriferous, and that the miner
may have access thereto. Breach of this
latter condition may involve the licensee or
owner in a fine not exceeding �2O.
GRAZING LICENCES.
Grazing licences (still, of course, refer-
ring to auriferous lands), renewable an-
nually at the option of the licensee, may be
issued for a period expiring not later than
the 29th December, 1905, for areas not ex-
ceeding 1000 acres, at a remtal to be fixed by
appraisement. No person can hold more
than 1000 acres. The licensee may, with
the consent of the Minister of Mines, en-
close the whole or any specified part of his
holding with a fence, which may be re-
moved by him upon or at any time before
the expiration of his licence; but such fence
musit be removed without compensation by
the licensee when ordered in writing by the
Department of Lands, failing which the
fence becomes the property of the Crown,
and may be removed at the cost and ex-
pense of the licensee. Free acccess to such
area must be allowed at all �times to miners
and other persons specially licensed to enter
thereon: the ringbarking of the timber on
the. land by the licensee is expressly for-
bidden, and*the'licensee will be subject to
a penalty, not exceeding �2O, if he fails to
place on the outside of �the corner posts of
the fence (if any) enclosing the land notices
to the effect that the land is licensed under
section 67 of the Land Act 1890. He must
paint in red color his corner posts and gate
posts as a further indication that he has
enclosed auriferous lands. The fee for
permission to transfer a grazing licence of
auriferous lands is �l.
RESIDENCE AREAS.
The Mines Acts 1890 and 1897 provide for
the issue of miners? rights. The holder is
entitled to occupy, after registering his
miner?s right in the books of the local min-
ing registrar, for the purpose of residence
or business, a maximum area of one acre (or
any lesser area fixed by the by-laws of the
mining district controlled by the local min-
ing board). The rental under a business
licence is �5 per annum. A habitable
dwelling must be erected on the area within
four months of The registration of the
residence area, and the holder may, after
12 months, let his interest in the surface, or
may sell or transfer his interest in the area.
When buildings or other improvements
have been erected, the holder may, after
being in possession for two years, apply
to the Board of Land and Works to pur-
chase his area at a price to be determined
by the Board, but the Board has the right
to refuse such application if there should be
any reasons of a public nature why such ap-
plication should not be granted. The
Governor in Council has the power at all
times to except land from occupation under
residence or business licences, and this is oc-
casionally done in respect of townships.
Such are the conditions above described
safeguarding the interests of the miners,
and it will be confessed that they are nu-
merous and stringent. Under such con-
ditions it is not to be wondered at that
complaints should be made by selectors
against the mining boards that
their proceedings are frequently vex-
atious, and that they unreasonably
oppose settlement, which, under the fore-
going 'tenures, is hardly to be regarded as
a menace in any sense of the word to the
progress of the mining industry.
