INTRODUCTION
The first list of aboriginal names, compiled by the late
W. W. Thorpe, was published in 1921. It contained three
hundred place names, but these were increased to seven
hundred and fifty in the second and third editions. In
all, some seven thousand copies of the list have been sold
to date. In response to a constantly increasing demand,
the list has been enlarged to almost fifteen hundred words
to satisfy the two principal demands of the public. Firstly,
it gives the meanings of seven hundred place names and
pastoral stations in the State, and secondly, it makes
available six hundred euphonious words, with their
meanings, suitable for naming houses, streets, reserves,
clubs, boats, commercial products, and the like. In
addition it includes the aboriginal names of parts of Port
Jackson ; the words used for Canberra streets and Sydney
Harbour ferries; and words such as dingo, boomerang,
kurrajong, and many others, which have been adopted into
our own language as vernacular names for animals, plants,
aboriginal weapons and other things. The number placed
after the meaning of the euphonious words and some of
the place names indicates the tribe from which the word
is derived ; the tribe’s territory is shown on the map, and
its name in the accompanying list, on the inside of the front
cover.
It is not claimed that the meanings given are scientifically
accurate. Most of the words were recorded by missionaries,
officers of the government departments such as the police,
surveyors, and registrars, and by people interested in the
natives, few of whom had any linguistic training for such
specialized work. Explanations often fail to convey the
variety of meanings that a word may have, especially where
it is connected with the sacred, legal, or social aspects of
aboriginal life. Many of the recorders knew little about
the spiritual beliefs of the aborigines, and as a consequence
gave too narrow an interpretation to words and phrases
expressive of their secret life. One word may express a
whole phrase, or describe an incident, between natives to
whom the circumstances are known; it is their custom to
use as few words as possible, and to build up omnibus
words, consistent with their purpose, to give an account of
a subject. They employ numerous, though slightly
differentiated phases of meaning of the one word, as, for
example, the pronunciation of a word for an animal at a
particular time may imply that it is feeding, running, on
the alert, off guard, on the ground, in a tree, entering or in
a hole, and so on, and the recorder has to be very careful
to write down the correct tonal values if possible. Some
words have a number of meanings which apparently have
no connection but can only be related by an understanding
of aboriginal culture. Nurrondi, for example, means both
to hunt and to enchant, because an animal may be caught,
by being hunted or charmed, or by both methods combined,
and one of these meanings alone would fail to bring out
the full significance of the word. Some of the place names
have a number of meanings, obtained by different recorders.

and it is not now possible to ascertain which is the correct
one or whether any or all of them are related in the above
manner.
Then the same word in one tribal language may have an
entirely different meaning in another tribe. Other
interesting points are that where a corroboree has been
learnt from another tribe, the correct words may accompany
it, often without their meanings, while a technique or
weapon which has been adopted by a number of tribes in
one area may have the same name among them, but a
variety of names among tribes outside this group. It
should be remembered that in Australia there were
hundreds of tribal languages, some of which were euphon-
ious and others harsh and ugly. It has not been possible
to assign all of the place names in this list to particular
tribes, but in most instances they belong to the language
of the tribe in whose territory they are situated ; some of
them are aboriginal corruptions of our names and phrases,
just as others are our corruptions of aboriginal words.
Professor A. P. Elkin (Oceania Monograph No. 3,
Studies in Australian Linguistics) states that “ We now
know, however, that abstract and general terms are not
altogether lacking, and further, that a deeper knowledge of
the culture and language of the aborigines shows that their
apparent inability to translate literally our abstract terms,
conjunctions, relative pronouns and various grammatical
constructions expressing comparison, contrast and equality,
does not imply an absence of those mental activities which
we express in such ways . . . the aborigines have
their own way of expressing these thought processes.
Moreover, the understanding of a people’s language is
impossible unless it be approached through their culture.
It is not a tool used by the culture, but a living functioning
element within it. The meaning of its words and the
forms of its structure are intimately related to the cultural
contexts in which they find a place ; and contexts, on their
part, are made up of actions, presuppositions, beliefs and
mutual understanding. Moreover, the grammatical pre-
sentation of the words is only part of the mechanism for
conveying the meaning; there are also accent, intonation,
and the general use of the voice, and equally important
facial expressions and bodily gesture. Allowing a traditional
use of sound and movement,- such as characterizes the
aborigines, we can admit the possibility of such mechanism
taking the place of some of our forms of speech and
grammatical structure.”
The pronunciation of aboriginal words may only be
indicated correctly by the use of accent marks, the use of
which would not be possible in this list because so many
of the words were recorded in a literal and not a phonetic
style ; as a result, spellings were made lengthy by the use
of double a, e or o, the addition of h and r at the end of
syllables and words, and other similar devices, which are
convenient for general use. It should be borne in mind
that all names commencing with a hard c should be spelt
with a k, as Karawa for Carawa, and that dj or tj should be
substituted for ch in many words. The spelling of words
by recorders varies considerably, as the Port Jackson names
demonstrate, due to factors such as the variation in the


pronunciation of words by members of the same tribe,
especially when it occupies a large territory as does the
Wiradjuri (No. 63), and the recorders’ different ideas of
the sounds spoken. Thus it is difficult to distinguish
between a and u sounds, and consonants may be given
equivalent values, as g and k, d and t. The accent varies
among tribes, and the emphasis may be on the first, middle,
or last syllable of a word. It is advisable to give equal
emphasis, unless it is denoted by the spelling, to words in
this list.
The demand for this pamphlet demonstrates the suit-
ability and popularity of aboriginal words for use as names.
They are Australian and should form an element in our
national culture. Their use will contribute to a better
understanding of the people.

PRESERVATION OF ABORIGINAL
RELICS.
We appeal to our readers to assist in
the campaign for the preservation of
aboriginal relics. These include rock
paintings and engravings, carved trees,
burial grounds, stone arrangements, cere-
monial grounds, kitchen-middens, stone and
bone implements, wooden weapons and
utensils. Unfortunately, much destruction
has been done to these national treasures
through ignorance, vandalism, and over-
zealous collecting. They are, actually, of
unique scientific and historic importance
and the sole remaining clues to the pre-
history of Australia. For these reasons it
is the responsibility of every citizen to
assist in their preservation.
A valuable service to science may be
rendered by reporting to your State
museum the locality of any aboriginal relic
or site that comes to your knowledge, so
that a full description may be made and
placed on permanent record. Much can be
done to preserve the aboriginal relics in
your own district by impressing upon its
residents the urgent need for their
protection.
The Australian Museum would be grate-
ful for donations of aboriginal stone
implements, weapons, utensils, fishing gear,
ornaments and magical objects from any
part of Australia.
