ill
HE Government of New South Wales aas
arranged to give assistance towards the
passages of persons emigrating to the
State who intend to settle on the land
or to engage in farm work, to domestic
servants, or to any others who can
ill satisfy the Agent-General in London ;
or the Director of the Immigration and
Tourist Bureau in Sydney, that they
will make suitable settlers, together with
their wives and families, if any. Nomi
nations may be made in New South Wales for assisted passages for
emigrants approved by the Agent-General, in accordance with the con-
ditions set out in the ? Regulations for Assisted Immigration.? All
assisted immigrants must be of sound mental and bodily health, of
good moral character, and under 45 years of age.
Arrangements have been made with the Orient
Fares. Line, the Aberdeen Line, P. & 0. Branch Service
(late Lund?s Blue Anchor Line), and the Federal -
Houlder-Shire Lines for reductions in the ordinary rates for second- and
third-class passages from Great Britain, and with , the Nord-Deutscher
Lloyd from Germany, Belgium, and Italy. Besides these reductions
a Government contribution is made towards each fare, thereby
reducing the cost of the assisted passage to the rates shown in the
table on page 4.
The ordinary price of a second-class passage from Great Britain
to New South Wales by the Orient Line (toe only t Company with which
arrangements for second-class accommodation have been made) is
�4l 16s. By taking advantage of the assisted immigration scheme,
the fare, after deducting the Government contribution and the shipping
company?s rebate, is only �3l 4s.
In the case of third-class passages, the ordinary fare by the Orient-
Line is �l 7 for an open berth, �ig for berth in four-berth cabin, and �2l
for berth in two-berth cabin. The fare by the Aberdeen Line, and
Lund?s Blue Ancho; Line, is �l6 for an open berth, �lB for a berth
in a four-berth cabin, and �2O in a two-berth cabin. By the Federal

Applicants for assisted passages from the United
Assisted Kingdom to New South Wales can obtain full informa-
Emigrants from tion from, and make all necessary arrangements with,
United Kingdom, the Agent-General for New South Wales, 123-5 Cannon-
street, London, E.C. Before any assisted passage can
be given, that officer will satisfy himself as to the eligibility of the
applicant, in accordance with the conditions specified in the Assisted
Immigration Regulations.
The Agent-General is authorised to grant assisted passages to
bona-fide farmers and farm labourers and to experienced domestic ser-
vants at �6, �B, or �g, according as passage is taken in open, four-berth, or
two-berth cabin. These rates are only available in London, however,
for immigrants selected by the Agent-General.


Persons nominating friends or relatives for assisted passages will be
required to deposit with the Director the net sum of �B, �io > or �ll,
according to the accommodation selected. If, within a reasonable time
after arrival, the nominees take up farm employment, a special subsidy
of �2 may be granted, reducing the net fare to �6, �B, or �q.
Residents of New South Wales, who wish to nominate
Nominated persons in the United Kingdom for assisted passages to
Passages. the State, should communicate with the Director,
Immigration and Tourist Bureau, Challis House, Martin
Place, Sydney, who will supply the necessary nomination form. The
person making the nomination must give an undertaking that employment
will be found for the nominee on arrival, or that adequate provision will
be made for his maintenance. The passage money (according to the rates
mentioned in the table on page 4) must be forwarded to the Immigration
and Tourist Bureau, together with the nomination form duly filled in, and,
if the case complies with the conditions laid down in the regulations, a
certificate will be at once issued, entitling the nominee to a passage to
Sydney. This certificate is to be forwarded to the person nominated, for
presentation to the Agent-General in London, who, if satisfied as to the
eligibility of the nominee, will arrange for the passage. Nominees must
pay their own fares from their place of residence to the port of
embarkation.
A receipt will be issued to the nominator by the Immigration and
Tourist Bureau, undertaking to refund the amount deposited in the event
of the passage not being granted by the Agent-General for any reason.
In cases where the Agent-General arranges the passage, and the nominee
refrains from utilising the same, without giving adequate notice to the
Agent-General, the Director can only refund to the nominator the balance
?of the amount deposited, after deducting any sum retained by the
shipping company for their loss on the passage.
Where such a course appears desirable, no objection is made
to issuing a certificate on the payment by the nominator of a
portion?say, one-third?of the amount required, on the understanding
that the balance is to be paid to the Agent-General by the nominee.
The granting of the passage is in that case, of course, contingent on
the payment of the balance.
Nominators are informed of the vessel by which their nominees
are travelling, as soon as advice is received from the Agent-General.
If requested by the nominator, an officer from the Immigration and
Tourist Bureau will meet nominated immigrants on arrival, and direct
them as to the best means of reaching their destination. If necessary,
suitable accommodation at reasonable rates will be recommended to
them.

nomination being lodged, provided the nominator furnishes satisfactory
references and gives a written assurance that to the best of his
knowledge his nominees are in sound health.

Orient New South Wales, the voyage occupying forty-two
Line. days. A regular fortnightly service is maintained, the
steamers leaving London and Plymouth every alter-
nate Friday and Saturday, respectively. Owing to the fact that the
Orient Line holds the contract with the Australian Government for
the carriage of mails, the regularity of despatch and the maintenance
of the specified time-table are assured. The second-class accommodation
on these steamers is of the highest order, and every comfort is provided
for. In the third-class there are commodious dining saloons, and stewards
and stewardesses are carried. The steamers are fitted throughout with
electric light, also with refrigerating machinery, thereby ensuring fresh
provisions throughout the voyage. The Bill of Fare is most liberal.
All table and cabin requisites, such as bedding and linen are supplied,
so that passengers have only to provide their own personal effects. A
doctor is carried, and in the case of sickness his services and medicines
required are available free of charge.
The route traversed by this line is most interesting. Between
London and Sydney the ports of call are Plymouth, Gibraltar, Marseilles,
Naples, Port Said, Suez, Colombo, Fremantle, Adelaide, and Melbourne.
At most of these ports sufficient time is allowed for passengers to inspect
the various scenes of beauty and interest. Further particulars may be
obtained from Messrs. Anderson Anderson, & Co., 5 Fenchurch Avenue,
