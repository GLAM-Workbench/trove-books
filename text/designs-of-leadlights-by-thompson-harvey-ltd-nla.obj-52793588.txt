By THOMPSON & HARVEY LTD., ADELAIDE
HE following pages contain suggestions of designs for Doorways, Casement
Windows, and Boxframe Windows, and will give clients some idea of the
styles that are being created at our Studios.
Any of these designs can be enlarged or reduced to any required size or
shape. So also can the colorings be readjusted to match the surroundings
in which they are being placed.
Steel Cored Lead is used to strengthen the panels where necessary, making them rigid and
firm. Our work is carefully cemented with good hard drying material, making it thoroughly
waterproof.
We are always pleased to prepare special designs for proposed Windows in Churches or
Public Buildings.
