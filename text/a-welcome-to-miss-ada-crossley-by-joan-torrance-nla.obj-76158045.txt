Welcome
miss Mu Crosslep.
Welcome! That sweet word ?always dear.
Welcome is echoed far and near*
To home once more.
Fair Spring has kept her flowery vow;
Her blossoms bright are blooming now
In bounteous store.
Blue violets in their leafy fold ;
The daffodils with crowns of gold
And stately grace J
Pure lilies, in their sacred pride,
On which the myriad sunbeams glide,
And kiss their face.


How song-birds o'er the paddocks sing,
From wattle boughs their wild notes ring.
Strong, full and clear;
Then, on the pinions of the breeze,
Their theme is wafted o'er the lees.
That we may hear.
Then onward ?where the mosses sleep,
Where bracken ferns serenely keep
Guard night and day ?
The old creek sings a joyous song,
To wild flowers, as it flows along
With rippling sway.
Gum trees, with gnarled, rugged face,
'Neath which an ebon ancient race
Were wont to rest.
Are standing as they stood of old.
Through summer heat and winter cold
They stood the test.


Australian skies are just as blue,
Australian hearts arc just as true
As in the past;
And so they honour you again?
Their cherished hopes were not in vain.
They were to last.
Success her gracious garments spread.
With kindly hands she gently led
You on the way;
But 'twas ambition's lasting light.
Now, in the zenith of her might.
She sheds a ray.
Foreign skies and old'world power
Have smiled on your triumphant hour.
And pleasure brought.
Through memory's veil of silver haze
A welhbelovcd one will gaze
With tender thought.


No life without a cross is free#
No rose without a thorn can bej
So it is now ?
The voice you fain would hear is still.
Yet loyally you did fulfil
Your girlish vow.
May the just Maker of us all
Upon you let His blessings fall?
Near by your side
May radiant visions ever stray \
The Eternal One, to Whom we pray.
With you abide.
Welcome again 1 October's feet
Have come with buoyant tread to greet
Her songster queen.
And, in her mellow, golden light.
Your native land awaits your sight
In garb of green.
