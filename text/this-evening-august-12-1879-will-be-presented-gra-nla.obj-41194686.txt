Perfect articulation 1a speech or song, is next
to impossible when the symmetry of the dental
arch is broken by the loss of teeth, which are
also indispeneible to the fluatist and other
instrumentalists. Many of our leading Orators,
Singers and Musicians who edify and delight
their hearers withth&ir eloquent speeches,soul-
inspiring songs and would be debaned
from continuing their useful career if deprived
of the dental substitutes tnat art has provided
them with. Looking at. the foregoing facts, ana
above all to the important part they play in the
conversion of food into blood, how im.
perative it is that if perfect t hey should be kept
so, and if lost that thev should be replaced by
the artificial ones, that the science of this
advanced age has brought to the present state of
perfection. Attending to these wants, is the
profession of
Horace stevens.

Our English contemporary records the
following : “ 1820, November. Ma-
dame Linsky, at a performance at Am-
stadt, in the presence of the Royal family,
was fired at by six soldiers (who were
instructed to bite off the bullet when biting
the cartridge, but which one omitted to doc,
and for a moment remained standing, but
almost immediately sank down, exclaiming
“Di a r husband, lam shot ! ” She never
spoke afterwards, and died on the second
day. For a time the reason of her young
husband was impaired ; he had reci-ntly lost
a child, and his unfortunate wife was ex-
pecting soon again to become a mother,
A similar accident had occurred in Dublin
half a dozen years earlier, where a clever
juggler had to catch a ball, fired from a
pistol, between the teeth. A young gentle-
man from the company had the wrong
pis ol handed to him, and when he fired, a
bullet crashed through the head of the
unfortunate conjurer—At Milan Theatre

Antigone of Alfieri, had to appear as turn-

the stage covered with blood and entirely
instnsible ; death ultimately resulted —At

THE BOY WHO WOULD GO WITH
THE CIRCUS.
The bov who would travel with the cir
cus has been out about three weeks now
He is home-sick and would like to get baik
to the cld home again if he could, bui he
can’t very well. They ain’t payirg boys
much to go along with a circus thisjyear,
and he isn’t in funds. Besides that, he
doesn’t know exactly what direction to take
to get home, being somewhat bewildered
with The fcig-zag route they have been taking.
Things havn’t turned out precisely as he
expected when he ran away from home to
join the show. His ambition to be a circus
boy was enflamtd when be first saw the
posters displayed on the old blacksmith
shop at the corners, while cn his way to
school. Then the proceesion on the street
added to his yearnings for the circus, and
by the time the canvas was spread on the
village common he was satisfied that nothing
but a life of mingled spangles and sawdust
could ever satisfy him. tie got in that
night by doing some little jobs for the boss
canvasman, and when they pulled up stakes
after the performance and started for the
next town, he hid among the rolls of canvas
on a wagon and was tarried away with the
rest of the paraphernalia. But he hasn’t
had a pleasant time altogether. He has
been kept at all manner of drudgery ever
since his presence along with the shuw was
detected. He has been cuffed about by rude
hostlers, bounced off wagons by gouty
drivers, and ordered about by everybody.
Unce he was jolted off the pole wagon
while asleep at night, on the road, and
nearly killed He expected when he joined
the show that he would be dressed up in
spangled tights at once and be taught to
ride in the ring, having the “ old clown ”
fling all manner of funny sayings at him
for the people to laugh at ana applaud. If
not that, he would be set to play the snare
arum in the band. But none of these came.
Ills chief duties were to assist the cook or
cany water to the e.ephant. Three weeks
with a circus and not yet advanced to the
position of a property boy. Poor lad ! bow
have his hallucinations been dissipated!
Actual show life is very fair from bis wide-
eyed cream of it while studying the circus
poster. We hope he will get home all right
at last, bringing some useful lessons from
his rough experience. But the boy who ran
after the show is but an illustration of
human life after all. How many men have
been deluded with spangles, and found that
they were only carrying water to the ele-
phant.—Cincinnati, Saturday Night,
A correspondent writes.—“ On consulting
my sevenpenny dictionary 1 find the word
wnisky , and looking over your advertise-
ments 1 find the “ Incomparable Bull

which is the correct method of spelling.”
in the one particular case the latter Is
right, as it is our conviction, based upon
personal experience that most men would
take tne Incomparable bull Whiskey with
ease. —£d.

Seven Stages of Drunkenness.
All the world’s a pub.
And ail the men and women merely
drinkers:
They have their hiccups and their stag-
gering* ;
And one man in a day drinks many
glasses.
His acts being seven stages. At first the
gentleman,
Steady and steadfast in his good resolves
And then the wine and oitiero, appetiser.
And pining, yearning look, leaving like
a snail
The comfortable bar. And then the
arguments.
Trying like Hercules with a wrathful
frontage
lo refuse one more two-penn'orth. Then
the mystified,
Full of strange thoughts, unheeding
gtod advice.
Careless of honor, soddoa, thick, and
guu’raJ,
Seeking the troubled repetition
Lvea in the bottle s mouth; and then
quite jovial,
in fair good humour while the wor d
swims round,
With eyes quite misty, while his friends
him cut,
Full of Lice oaths and awful bickerings:
And so he plays his part. The sixth .ge
shifts
into the stupid, slipping drunken man
Vv ith *• blossoms ” on his nose and
bleary-eyed,
His shrunken face unshaved, from side to
He rolls along: and his unmanly voice
Huskier than ever, fails ana flies
And leaves him—staggering round.

The V,R,C. Hotel, Bourke street, two
doors from the Theatre Royal, Messrs
James Mace and John Thompson beg tc
inform their friends and the sporting public
Dhat ffiey have leased the premises formerly
favorably known as the City Buffet, which
they have entirely refitted. They have
added the spacious St. James’s Hall for
Illustrations of the Art of Self-Defence,
the exhibitions of which will take place
every Saturday. Billiard Tables of the best,
and every inducement to healthful exercise
and recreation will be provided. A limited
number of Gentlemen Pupils will be
received. In addition to the above Messrs.
Mace and Thompson are introducing a

On Tuesday, the 19th August the
Roscians will perform Shakspere’s tragedy
of Hamlet at the Academy of Music,
Melbourne in aid of the Society for the
Relief of persons of Education in distcepsed
circumstances, being the first performance
of Hamlet by an amateur troupe in this
city. Moreover, a special interest is attached
to this performance, every character being
in the hands of a native bom amateur,
with the exception of Ophelia (Mrs J. L,
Hall) and the Queen (Mrs Wooldridge)
All but universally bad times, commer-
cial depression, bank overdraft, 15 per
cent, discount for cash, and such like
posters are staring us in the face, and ad-
vanced as re; sons why you should com-
miserate and buy of this or that sufferer,
I, too, live by Beilin?, but amidst all this
heavy crisis have had an exceedingly pros-
perous soasoa. The reason is obvious;
people want value, and in buying and
selling for cash I am able to do it. In
fact, the sealskin cap at 5s Ud, long
matehsse jacket, 12s 9d, and winter
costumes at 17s 6d, are worth going mil s
to see, if only for comparison with what is
said to be half the usual price elsewhere.

Bourke street east.
It is admittedly a fact that no one class of
tea can display as many good characteristics
by itself as when skilfully blended with
other sorts, which supply its deficiencies
and bring out its virtues- Tea blending,
however, requires extensive experience, and
nice discrimination, and it is this fact
which explains the failure of many of
those who attempt it, and which has in-
duced them to give up selling any but
unblended teas. The Oriental ica Com
pany possesses every requisite for the
production of the best blending results.
This is proved by the high quality of their
Packet Teas, which gained a prize medal
against the world at the late Paris Exhi-
bition.
Friends, come and bring your sistere,

BREAKFAST.
“By a thorough knowledge of the natural laws
which govern tbo operations of digestion and
nutrition, and by a careful application of the fine
properties of well-selected cocoa, Mr Epps has
provided our breakfast tables with a delicately
flavoured beverage which may save us many
heavy doctors’ bii s. It is by the j udicioas use
of such articles of diet that a constitution may
be gradually built up until strong enough to
resist every tendency to disease. Hundreds of
subtle maladies are floating around us ready to
attack wherever there is a weak point. We may
escape many a fatal shaft by keeping ourselves
well fortified with pure blood a«d a properly
nourished frame.*'—See article in the Civil
