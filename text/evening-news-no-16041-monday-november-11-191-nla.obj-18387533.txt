SPEeiAL WAR BULLETIN
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
ARMISTICE SIGNED
WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT MAKES
THE NEWS PUBLIC.
MONTREAL, Monday, 3.5 a.m.
The Washington State Department has announced that Germany
has signed the armistice.
Four Years of War.
Six months ago few people believed that Germany's military power would be so soon broken and that her
allies would surrender.
Four months ago the Germans had just captured important positions in France, and were threatening
to take Paris, and to drive a wedge between the British and French forces. The Germans would not ave
won the war if they had taken Paris and Amiens, but the difficulties of the Allies would have been multiplied
enormously. They would have fought on stubbornly u ntfl the Americans came over in their millions.
Marshal Foch, the Generalissimo of the Allied forces, who had resisted every temptation to throw in his
reserves in order to hold up the German advance, seized upon the psychological moment in the middle of July
to turn upon the enemy. The splendid counter-stroke on the Marne proved to be the turning po.nt of tne
war The River Marne has become historic. It war near Chat river that Attila and his Huns met their
great defeat. It was on the Marne that the Germans met their first reverse in 1914. and on the same river
in July last began the series of defeats which demoralised the German army.
When the Allies, including the reconstituted Serlian army, began a powerful attack in the Balkans,
the Bulgarians vainly appealed to Germany for assistance. Despairing of help from their allies, the Bul-
garians surrendered just when the Allies were preparing to invade Bulgaria.
The Turks had been driven out of Palestine and almost the whole of Mesopotamia before they surren-
dered on October 30
Austria relied on the strength of the German armies to secure ultimate victory. But when the Germans
were being beaten in France, and the southern frontier of Austria was exposed to the attacks of the Entente
forces, the Austrian authorities decided to give ir.
Abandoned by ali her allies, and her armies defeated in France. Germany had no alternative but to
ask for an armistice.
The German Government, therefore, in response to a Note from the President of the United States, sent
a delegation to Marshal Foch to ask for an armistice.
On November 9 a German official announcement was made that the Kaiser had abdicated that the Crows
Prince had renounced succession to.the German throne, and that a Regency had been appointed.
Prince Max issued bis. last decree when he announced the abdication of the Kaiser and the appoint-
ment of Deputy Ebert as Imperial Chancellor and Regent
Herr Ebert belongs to the German Socialist Majority Party. His first act as Chancellor was to announce
that the demobilisation of the army would be ordered immediately.
