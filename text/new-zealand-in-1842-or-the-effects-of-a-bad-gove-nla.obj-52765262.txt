Auckland, New Zealand, 19 th September, 1842.
My Loud,
I had the honor, a short time ago, of forwarding to Your Lord-
ship, complaints of the mal appropriation of the Revenue of this Colony
in the case of Mr. Robert Appleyard Fitzgerald, and the two Commis-
missioners appointed under Sir George Gipps’Actfor the investigation
of Claims to Land in New Zealand, viz.— Captain Richmond and
Colonel Godfrey.—ln one of these communications I took the liberty
of adverting in general terms to the profligate and injudicious expen-
diture of the Government of New Zealand, which has cost England and
this Colony upwards of One Hundred and Twenty Thousand Pounds
during the last two years, a sum of money under any circumstances
infinitely greater than the wants of the country require, or the
means of the Colonists can afford. lam well aware that the establish-
ment of a New Government is necessarily attended with considerable
expense in the first year of its formation, but the Government of this
Colony has not only been attended in its first formation with an ex-
pense fearfully disproportionate to the nature of the undertaking, but
has also been increased in each succeeding year, in a ratio still less
proportionate to the growth and progress of the Colony, without con-
ferring the slightest.benefit upon the settlement, as none of the money
expended has been devoted to local improvements, such as the forma-
tion of Roads and B:idges, or the erection of substantial Public Offices:
As the profligate expenditure of the New Zealand Govern-
ment must now of necessity become known to Your Lordship from
the fact of their having lately been compelled to draw Bills upon
the Home Government, to enable them to procure the means of
paying their own salaries, perhaps I may be permitted respectfully
to submit to Your Lordship some of the causes which have tended
to create this inordinate expenditure.—I have resided in New Zea-
land both before and since the establishment of British Authority,
and have been resident in Sydney, while preparations were being made
for Capt. Hobson’s mission to this country,and can therefore speak from
personal observation of all the acts of the New South Wales and New


Zealand Governments in this matter, and after narrowly watching the
of the Government of this Colony from the arrival of Captain
Hobson to the present moment, 1 feel persuaded that the following
circumstances will be found sufficient to account for the comparative
failure of the Colonv, and the present humiliating embarrassment of the
Officers administering the Government.
The origin of nearly all the evil which has befallen this Colony,
has in a great measure arisen from the ignorance of Sir George Gipps
and the Government of New South Wales as to the nature of this coun-
try, both in respect of climate and soil; but more especially of the
character of the inhabitants—New South Wales with even which Sir
George Gipps was at that time imferfectly acquainted, was made the
Prototype of all the Institutions of this country, as well as of all the lo-
cal arragements and minor details of the Government. The Govern-
ment of this Colony was in point of fact nothing more nor less than a
miniature of which. New South Wales was the portrait, or rather the
original itself. It will not therefore appear surprising, that an attempt
to govern a new and free Colony by the Penal Code of New South
Wales, should have terminated in so short a period in the ruin of
the Colony, and the disgrace and confusion of the officers administering
the Government, who after spending all the available means of the set-
tlers, have been compelled to have recourse to every sort of expedient
to raise money, and ultimately to insult the Honor of the British Gov-
ernment itself by offering-to the Public their own personal guarantee, to
the amount of twenty thousand pounds for the repayment of Bills drawn
on the Home 'Government, in the event of their being returned trom
England dishonoured, the Sydney Banks having already refused to cash
■them under an apprehension that any effort made to support so extra-
vagant an expenditure as that of the New Zealand Government, would
he discountenanced at Home.
It will doubtless be remembered by your Lordship, that a
Government had bean formed at Port Essington, on the coast of
"New Holland, shortly before the arrival of Captain Hobson in New
South Wales, and that the necessary supplies for the establishment
of that settlement, were furnished by the Government of New South
Wales. New South Wales, and Port Essington in particular, are as
different from New Zealand in every respect, as any two countries can
possibly be ; the one possessing a dry air and climate, with a soil
adapted for pastoral pursuits alone, and affording every facility for land
carriage, by means of its extensive and numerous plains, while the
other is characterized by a humidity of atmosphere, and by a soil solely
and peculiarly adapted for agriculture, though the abundance and
extent of the forests, the extremely luxuriant and rank vegetation, the
number and depth of its rivers, together with the existence of steep
and elevated mountains on many parts of the coast, preclude almost
every species of communication, excepting by water. Yet, notwith-
standing this great dissimilarity in the nature of the two countries, the
very same amount, and list of supplies which had been furnished to the
Government of Port Essington, were item for item provided for the use
of New Zealand, Horses, carts, drays, and harness of every de-^


scr ption, were at great expense shipped from Sydney, and landed at
Bu ; sel in the Bay of Islands, where, from the peculiarly rugged,,
and precipitous nature of that place, wheel carriages, and even horses
could never be used. Such was the ignorance of the Government in
this respect, that a company of Mounted Police were deemed indispen--
sible to the retinue of the Governor of New Zealand, although it was
discovered on their arrival at Russel, that they could not find as much
dry or level land as would enable them even to keep their horses in
exercise. The very idea of furnishing such a country as this, with a
body of Mounted Police, would appear so supremely ridiculous to any
person acquainted with the nature of the place, and the character of the
people, as to compel him to refuse credence to the fact. But so well
pleased was Sir George Gipps with this establishment, which he him-
self had been the happy means of recently founding for the purpose
of capturing runaway convicts beyond the limits of location in New
South Wales, that reasoning from the fact of New Zealand not being
included in the nineteen counties which constitute the settled part
of New South Wales, he deemed it not only expedient, but wise, to
give the Inhabitants of this Colony the benefit of so efficient a corps,
as the Mounted Police.
If Sir George Gipps committed a mistake in thus furnishing
New Zealand, at so great an expense, with supplies altogether un-
adapted for the country, he erred in a still greater degree, in the num-
ber of appointments and the selection of Government officers.
The establishment of a Government in New Zealand hap-
pened at a very opportune time for Sir George Gipps, as it afforded
him the means of decently getting rid of a number of useless, if not
obnoxious persons connected with his own Government, by creating
places for them under the New Zealand Government, and handing
them over to Captain Hobson as powerful auxiliaries in the work in
which he was about to be engaged ; and in order to effect this laudable
purpose, it was deemed expedient even before Her Msjesty bad either
obtained the cession of sovereignty, the right of pre-emption, or the
possession of an inch of land in New Zealand, to send to this Colony
officers to represent every department in New South Wales, together
with the usual number of assistants and clerks, A Colonial Secretary,
a Treasurer, a Collector of Customs, a Surveyor-General, three Com-
missioners of Land Claims, Harbour Masters, Protectors of Abori-
gines, ano an extensive body of Stipendiary Magistrates and Police,
were forthwith transported to New Zealand, to the great embarrass-
ment of Captain Hobson, who, on his arrival in the Colony, discovered
thatit was a much more difficult undertaking to govern the parties
who accompanied bimself, than either the natives or the original sett-
lers. So arduous and perplexing was the task of providing occupation
for these officers, that vessels were chartered expressly for the purpose
of removing them in rotation from the seat of Government, though
apparently under the pretext of discovering a suitable site for the
future Capital. As an instance of the manner in which the officers of
the New Zealand Government employed themselves in these days, I
would mention the fact, that they were twice dispatched in the Govera


merit brig from the Bay of Islands to the East Cape, for the pur-
pose of removing the bones of a Native Chief, named Pomari, who
had been many years before then killed in war, by the natives of
the Thames. This species of employment might have been, in
itself, harmless, but for the salaries paid to the officers themselves, as
well as the expenses of the various establishments required for carrying
on such occupations.
Upwards of eighteen mouths had been spent in this manner,
before fixing upon a site for the projected capital, or purchasing any
lands from'the Natives for the purpose of locating the immmigrants
who had by this time, in numbers, arrived in the Colony, many of
whom were compelled to re-immigrate, from the delay and uncertainty
of the Government measures. Yet, notwithstanding this, or the im-
prudence of appointing so many useless offices, and the great expenses
created under the New South Wales Government, matters might
have still been prevented from terminating in such confusion and
ruin as they have done unhappily of late, had the Officers administering
this Government exercised any degree of discretion or judgment after
the separation of the Colony from New South Wales. But instead of
making any attempt to save, for the purpose of emigration or local im-
provements judiciously curtailing their expenses), some of the
money which was now fast pouring into the Treasury from various
sources, such as the sale of Crown Lands, fees and fines exacted from
the original Settlers, together witli the receipts from the Customs and
other branches of the ordinary revenue, the Officers administering this
Government were so ignorant of the principles of Political Economy,
or the ordinary relation between cause and effect, that they imagined
and acted on the belief that the more they spent the larger would the
revenue become. Several new Officers instantly obtained appoint-
ments; and offices which in other Colonies are conducted by one indi-
vidual, were divided and made separate, in accordance with a system
of division and sub-division of labour purposely invented where nothing
was expected to be done. As an instance of the practical application
of this system, I need only refer to the appointment of a Registrar of
the Supreme Court long before that Court was established, or even the
Judge had left England. Unfortunately, however, for Mr. Fitzgerald,
tbs individual appointed to this Office, the Judge, on his arrival in this
Colony, was accompanied by a gentleman whom he deemed more com-
petent to discharge the duties of the Office than the person pre-
appointed, and consequently procured the election of his friend to
the office. But the Ex-Registrar could not be forsaken by
his party—who, in order to make provision for him—fell upon
the happy expedient of dividing the labours of the office and ap-
pointed their favourite,: —Registrar of Deeds, with the same salary as
before and actually paid him the full amount of six months salary
before the Ordinance for the Registration of Deeds was in force.
Independent of the fnoney thus spent on Government officers
and their favourites, a vast amount has also been absolutely sunk in the
erection of temporary wooden buildings, as public offices, as well as in
the improvement and decoration of a wooden building sent out from


England for a Government House—on this house which originally cost
Two Thousand Pounds—and which might have served every purpose
intended, as regarded the comfort or convenience of the Governor of a
New Colony,ho less a sura than Fifteen or Twenty Thousand Pounds
have been thrown away, while not even One Hundred Pounds have
been, as yet, devoted to Local Improvements, in fact so little have the
comfort or convenience of the Public been attended to that even the
Streets of A uckland itself, where the people have expended so much
money in the purchase of Allotments, were in such a state as to be
utterly impassable during the whole winter, although an outlay of One
or Two Hundred Pounds would have been sufficient for their improve-
ment, The Revenue of the Colony appears to be made subservient to
one purpose only, that of being expended,—directly or indirectly, upon
the Government Officials themselves or upon their Friends.
To be able, however, to form any thing like an accurate idea
of the mischievous measures of the Government, or the mistakes and
blunders committed by the Officers, it would be necessary to give an
Historical Record of their proceedings from their arrival in the Colony
to the present moment. Such a record, if faithfully drawn, would
exhibit the most extraordinary combination of imbecility, ignorance,
recklessness, political dishonesty and selfish cupidity, that has ever
been manifested by any, set of Public Men. Their conduct in every
instance hss been remarkable, not only for the profoundest ignorance,
but for the utmost contempt of all the principles of general and
Colonial policy, a? well as of all the minor details of office ; the good
of the Colony, and the interests of the Public, were esteemed as nothing
in comparison: with tbe gratification of the ruling, and all-engrossing
passion,—self-interest.
1 ! ' As’ art ,instance of this reckless, iand impolitic spirit, it were
defy to fcifer to the first act of the Govei-nment Officers, the
purchase of three hundred acres of land from Mr. Clendon, at the. Bay
of Islands, for fifteen thousand pounds, the subsequent compromise
made with Mr. Clendon for that sum of money, by giving him a grant
of ten thousand acres of most valuable land, in the immediate vicinity
of the Capital, as well as the appointment of Mr. Clendon shortly
thereafter, to a seat in the Legislative Council, together with the foolish
attempt of establishing a township on this land ; a project, the impracti-
cability of which alone, cotnpelled them recently to abandon in favour
of Kororarika, the old and established settlement at the Bay of Islands,
Towards the Aboriginal inhabitants of New Zealand, the con-
duct of die Government has been uniformly distinguished by the prac-
tice of faithlessness and deception, and the exercise of indecision, imbe-
cility, and fear. The truth of the first part of this charge might easily be
proved, not only by the expedients which they have had recourse to, in
procuring the signatures ofsome of the Chiefs to the treaty for the cession
of Sovereignty, but also from their more recent transactions with the
Natives, in the purchase of land, as well as in the misappropriation of
that portion of the Land Revenue of the Colony which ought to have been
exclusively devoted to the instruction and moral improvement of the


Aborigines. A grosser mockery of justice, or a more perfect-imposition
on the friends and wellwisliers of the native race, cannot be conceived
than the fact of appointing one and the same individual to the office of
Protector of Aborigines and Government Agent for the purchase of
land from the Natives. Tlie idea that the same person (even though
he may have formerly acted as missionary) will at one and the same
time make the best possible s bargain for the Native as well as for the
Government which pays his salary, would suppose the existence of a
higher degree of impartiality and a more unerring sense of Justice than
1 venture to affirm, even Mr. Clarke himself, who has the honor to fill
both situations, will pretend to lay claim to.
A wise Government would have made it a matter of para-
mount importance to secure the respect and confidence of the Native
population by striving in every possible manner to convince them
that no advantage would be taken of them on account of their com-
parative ignorance, inferiority or weakness, —that Justice would be
dispensed to them with an even hand, and the same Laws administered
to them as to the Europeans.—Sound policy would have also dictated
the necessity of teaching them to respect and observe these laws by
the certainty of their application whether for the purpose of maintain,
ing and securing them in their just rights, or inflicting with unerring
and impartial justice the punishment which such laws demanded, when
infringed either by aggression on the part of natives against natives or
Europeans; or of Europeans against natives or other Europeans. That
the officers of this Government have lost sight of these principles in
their intercourse with the natives is unhappily two well known to re-
quire much discussion to prove. The correspondence attached to this
letter bears too unequivocal evidence of the injury inflicted on the
natives of this Colony, by permitting them with, impunity to commit
every species of outrage, not only against one another but against
Europeans also.
The officers of the Government will, I doubt not, attempt to
justify themselves to Your Lordship, for not interfering or making any
effort to prevent such fearful massacres as that which has recently
been perpetrated at Tauranga, on the plea that the military force in the
Colony is too weak, together with the danger of losing the influence
which they think their imaginary strength enables the Government to
exercise over the natives, in the event of a defeat. Such at least were the
arguments used in the case of a native named Maketu, who was a short
time ago executed in Auckland on account of the murder of several Euro-
peans at the Bay of Islands, until the inhabitants of that place convinced
them of the groundless nature of their fears by capturing the murderer
themselves without assistance from the Military or the Pol ce. The
true cause, however, of the disgraceful and temporizing conduct of the
Government in this respect, will be found in a great measure to arise
from a precedent which they have established in a case of robbery at
Kaipara, and several other instances, of compromising crimes, on the
payment of a penalty by the natives, in the shape of grants of land to
the Government, for every outrage committed; as well as from the
fact, that they dare not now quarrel with the natives, who would im


mediately insist upon the full payment of all the money promised to
them for land purchased hy the Government—a debt which the natives
too well know and feel the Government is not in a condition to liqui-
date. So often and so much has the good faith or credulity of the
natives been imposed upon by the Government, in obtaining possession
of various tracts of land on the payment of a small instalment at first,
or the promise of a further payment, which has never been made,
that, on account of such frequent disappointments on the part of the
Government, the Natives have now lost nearly all respect for Euro-
peans, and place little confidence in the integrity of their word or pro-
mise. Even the Missionaries themselves have become the objects of
their displeasure, because they think and say they have misled them in
advising them to sign the Treaty of Cession, which they believe to be
the origin of all their misery. So strong is this feeling, that in the
event of any serious outbreak, they conceal not that the Missionaries
would be the first objects of their vengeance.
The next subject to which I would take the liberty of directing
your Lordship’s attention is intimately connected with the last, and
affords the clearest possible illustration of the incompetency, perfidy,
and fatal recklessness of the Government Officers. I refer to that un-
fortunate and much injured class of people who now bear the name of
Land Claimants, in the country which they themselves have founded,
and over whose destinies they are still likely to exercise the deepest
influence.
The case of the Original Settlers of New Zealand has never
been fairly represented or properly understood at home. The benefits
they have conferred on society in general, and on the Natives of New
Zealand in particular, by risking their lives and properties in extending
the boundaries of civilization, have either been entirely overlooked and
underrated, or concealed by means of the unfair reports of interested
persons, and the most exaggerated and false statements of the immorality
and misconduct of a few among them. The Records of the Supreme
and other Courts since their establishment in the Colony would, how-
ever, tend much to remove such ill-founded prejudices by disclosing
the most extraordinary iac* that none of the Old Settlers have ever
appeared in any of the Criminal cases, and very few, comparatively
speaking, in any Civil actions before the Courts. At the last Sittings
of the Supreme Court in Auckland there was not a single criminal case
for trial, and at Kororareka in the Bay of Islands—so notorious for
wickedness (in report at least), there were only two cases civil or crimi-
nal, and even these two were dismissed.
But if the nr oral character of the first Settlers has been thus
grossly misrepresented, and their reputation so undeservedly injured
with the public, their properties have been still more grievously attack-
ed and destroyed by the Officers of this Government, who have been
treacherous from the commencement, and faithless throughout, to every
promise they made to the Settlers, without whose co-operation and
assistance they could never have succeeded in establishing any form of
Government; or even in obtaining a footing of any kind among tbs


Natives of New Zealand. Had Sir George Gipps and the Government
of New South Wales followed out the instructions of the Marquis of
Normanby, anti the pledge of Captain Hobson himself, that the Lands
and Properties of the Settlers of New Zealand would be respected, and
all their rights held to them inviolate, the Home Government would
not be called upon, as it is now, to advance money for the support, if not
for the preservation of the existence of the Government of this Colony,
neither would such frequent demands be made upon your Lordship’s
time for the redress of greivances, or the alleviation of the miseries and
sufferings of the Settlers. Had Captain Hobson, instead of
throwing discredit on the Titles of the First Settlers, and attempting
to found a new Colony on the ruins of the old, but contented
himself with the state of things as he found them, and acted in
accordance with his first pledge of confirming the settlers in their
justly bought lands. New Zealand would have been at the present
moment one of the most flourishing Colonies belonging to the Crown
of England. On his arrival here, he found all the elements of prosper-
ity, comfort and happiness in full and active operation.—But instead
of cherishing and promoting industry and enterprise, the first act of his
Government was to suspend them, until, by the impolicy of his suc-
ceeding measures, he could be enabled to destroy them altogether. In
the accomplishment of this laudable purpose he was in the first instance
powerfully assisted by the Governor and Council of New South Wales.
Sir George Gipps, by a species of reasoning for which he is remark-
able, easily prevailed upon his Council to pass a law, declaring all
litles to land in New Zealand invalid. This Act was founded on two
propositions, in the truth of which few honest men will be disposed to
agree with His Excellency, the first of which is : that Savages, (mean-
ing the Inhabitants of every newly discovered country,) according to
some American writers on the Law of Nations, and more especially
according to the humane custom of the Americans themselves, in regard
to the natural inhabitants of their country, can have no right of pro-
perty in the soil they occupy—or in the country where they are pjaced
by Providence.—The second proposition was, that the Aboriginahin-
habitants of New Zealand are savages, notwithstanding the fact
of the Queen of England having obtained from them by Treaty
the Cession of their acknowledged Sovereignty, the highest right
that can be exercised by any man or body of men. The inference
from these two propositions was plain, and easily arrived at, viz., that
the Natives of New Zealand having thus been proved to be savages,
having no right to, or interest in, the land they live on, all purchases
made from them by the inhabitants of civilized countries of any of the
minor rights, such as land, were illegal and invalid, and, consequently,
belonged by right to the Crown of England. But with the view of
keeping alive a certain amount of hope, and a lingering expectation in
the minds of the Settlers, of being able to retain some portion of their
properties, or rather with the intention of extorting some money from
them, in the shape of fees and fines, it was graciously intimated that
Her Majesty was pleased to grant to all fair purchasers of lan,d, cer-
tain portions of the same, not to exceed in any instance two thousand
five hundred and sixty acres, according to a certain scale of price and


fees, and that three Commissioners would be appointed to examine all
claims to land. This appointment, however, was the only part of the
boon which has hitherto been conferred, these Commissioners are still
receiving fees, fines, and salaries, although none of the Claimants have
been put in possession of an inch of their lands.
Such, my Lord, is the unhappy logic by means of which the
European inhabitants and Natives of New Zealand have been deprived
of the rights of Englishmen and men ; and by means of which, so
many disasters have befallen the Settlers of this unfortunate country,
Tne Ordinance of the Governor and Council of. New South Wales,
was re-enacted in this Colony, immediately after its separation from
New South Wales. But Her Majesty having been pleased to intimate
to his Excellency her disapproval of Sir George Gipps’ Act, another
meeting of the Legislative Council of this Colony was speedily called.
A new Bill was submitted by his Excellency, differing in some measure
from the former, which pretended to leave a portion of their lands to
the Claimants. The object of the New Zealand Bill was to compel
the settlers to surrender the whole of their lands to the Crown, and to
take value for the amount that would be awarded by Sir George Gipps’
Act, in certain allotments in the vicinity of Auckland, and two or three
other townships. The design of the Government Officers in thus
seeking to collect the population of the Colony around Auckland was
naturally supposed by the Claimants not to be so much for their
benefit, as with the view of enhancing the value of some town property
lately acquired by the Government Officers; a subject, to which I will
take the liberty of referring more particularly in another part of this
letter. His Excellency was in the end, under tire necessity of aban-
doning this measure, on account of the opposition of the non Official
Members, as well as. on account of a firm and fixed determination on
the part of the settlers not to submit to it.
Another Bill was, however, substituted, and eventually passed.
This Bill was by way of distinction called “The Bill of Revenge ’’
because the Attorney General and the Colonial Secretary, the framers
and projectors of both Bills, threatened the day the last Bill was
thrown out, that the settlers would have cause to regret their oppo-
sition, as the next Bill would be infinitely worse for them than
the first. Mr. Earp, (the only independent member of Council at that
time,) strenuously and honestly opposed both measures, and
entered a protest against the last Bill, on account of which, and
because of the confidence placed in him by the Public, the mem-
bers of Council persuaded his Excellency to deprive him of his seat
in the Legislative Council, which was done forthwith, notwithstanding
the disapprobation of the Public of such an extraordinary and unheard
of act, and the well known circumstance that the other two non-official
members were peculiarly bound to, and attached to the Government,
and otherwise from education and pursuits in life, most unlikely to
uphold the interests of the Colonists or to appreciate Public Measures,
such as must now come before them in their new and unexpected
situation, as Members of a Legislative Council.


After submitting to three years suspense and anxiety in this
fearful Court of Chancery, the Land Claimants have still as little pros-
pect as ever, of obtaining any thing like a favorable or equitable settle-
ment of this question, Mr. Spain the Commissioner appointed by Her
Majesty to investigate their Claims has been by this act purposely su-
perseded, and the two Commissioners of Sir George Gipps again sent
among the Land Claimants to exact more fines and fees, and although
it was intimated a short time ago that they had condescended on making
some reports on certain of the Claims submitted to them, in accordance
with the last Bill passed in this Colony, it appears however that none of
these Claims can be given out until Her Majesty’s pleasure is again
made known to her servants in this Colony, as it is reported that a des-
patch has been recently received from Your Lordship conveying the
intelligence of Her Majesty's approval of the former Bill, founded
on Sir George Gipps’ Act. So that it is evidently the fate of
the Land Claimants to be kept for ever going the round of
this Maze of inter-colcnial Policy, or to forsake their bard earned
properties, leave the country in despair and disgust, and bear the dis-
grace of being looked upon in the light of swindlers, who have made-
their escape to avoid their paying just and lawful debts, which the
crooked policy, the vexatious delays and the iniquitous measures of
the local Government have prevented them from honestly settling.
Having behaved so harshly to the old settlers, it might have
been almost naturally expected that the officers of the New Zealand
Government would have made some effort to conciliate the recently
arrived immigrants who followed in their own wake, and to make room
for whom it might have been pretended they were induced to sacrifice
the old settlers. Prudence would have suggested such a course to any
other set of men however avaricious they might be; but prudence never
formed an element in the constitution of the New Zealand Government.
In this instance the officers manifested to a higher extent than ever,
the usual indications of incompetency and recklessness together with a
more undisguised design to make every thing in which they engaged
subservient to their own interest. While they harrassed and annoyed-
the immigrants, by loitering away their time at the Bay of Islands in the
enjoyment of the childish occupation, to which I have alluded in the
first part of this letter, they never for a moment took into consideration,
the condition of the hundreds who were impatiently and uncomfortably
waiting till they had finished their amusements, in thehcpe that they'
would purchase lands from the natives, with the view of reselling to the
immigrants. The case of the immigrants was peculiarly distressing.
After expending a great amount of money in coining to New Zealand,
they discovered on their arrival that they were not only prohibited from
buying lands from the natives of the country, but also from the Euro-
pean settlers whose titles were at this time declared to be invalid-
They were moreover unable to procure lands trom the Government in
as much as the Government had none to sell, having not only neglected
to make timely purchases from the natives, but having also the Sur-
veyor-General and his staff travelling over the length and breadth of the
country, seeking in every unlikely place, a site for the projected capital.


as if this had been the most important object of their mission, and for
the accomplishment of which the comfort of the poor immmigrant was a
thing of minor consideration. The immigrants had in this manner no
alternative but either to abandoh the Colony, or to content themselves
with living in their tents, until it should suit the convenience or caprice
of their Rulers (who spent their time comfortably at Russell) to take
compassion upon them, by selling to them such lands as they might deem
proper for the purpose of enabling them to erect houses to live
in. After a delay of eighteen months an opportunity was at last given
to the poor immigrants of spending their money on the Auckland Town
Allotments, in the purchase of which they had powerful competitors in
the Government officers themselves, whose successful speculations in
land jobbing have been so frequently and so justly, made matter of com-
plaint to the Home Government, and ultimately disapproved of by Your
Lordship to the infinite joy and satisfaction of all the settlers in the
Colony, who from this fact are led to hope that they are not altogether
forsaken or abandoned to the men who now rule over them, and to en-
tertain with confidence the belief that their grievances only require to be
made known at the Home, in order to be redressed. That you may not
be induced through the representations of the Government officers to
continue to them the possession of Lands, which they have obtained at
such a sacrifice of the best interests of the Colony and in so disreputable
a manner, I will endeavour as briefly as possible to lay before Your
Lordship a correct statement of this shameful transaction.
The Auckland Official Land-jobbing which has grown to be
such a monstrous evil in this Colony, derives its origin, like many other
similar abuses, from a very small beginning. A few of the Government
officers, on or.before their arrival in New Zealand, suggested to Sir
George Gipps, the propriety of allowing them to select a small portion
of laud for each officer to erect a house upon, urging as a reason the
probable delay that must occur, before the Government could be
prepared to purchase land and to sell allotments, and the great
inconvenience of living in tents with their families. The argu-
ments appeared so reasonable, that the indulgence was at once granted,
care being taken (as Sir George Gipps imagined) that this in-
du’gence should not be abused, by limiting the selections, both
as to quantity, and by the rank of the Officers obtaining them, as
well as by other very precise and stringent regulations. No better
proof of the mistaken kindness of Sir George Gipps, or of the intention
of the Government Officers can be given, than the fact, that none
of them availed themselves of the right of selection, until the town
of Auckland was surveyed, and not more than a week or two before
the first Land Sale took place, and, some of them even later. The best
possible situations were, however, timeously made choice of; the whole
of one bay, containing the best water frontages in Auckland, was
selected by all the Officers, with the exception ot the Colonial Secre-
tary, who made choice of the largest allotment in Commercial Bay, the
only water frontage offered for sale to the public ; to this allotment,
which commanded the deepest water of any allotment in the place, the
half of another reserved allotment was added. Care was also taken


that so few allotments should be offered For sale to the public, as must
of necessity create, not only great competition, but also lead to a
re-sfile of several of these allotments, by cutting them up in pieces
small enough to suit the means of thole who could not afford to pur-
chase entire allotments. The result was precisely what they expected,
the Government allotments sold exceedingly high, but nevertheless,
many of the parties who bought them realized large profits by a
seasonable re-sale. Mr. Shortlaud, the Colonial Secretary, was the
first of the Government Officers who turned his grant to good account,
by availing himself of the favourable opportunity which presented itself
for making money in this manner. Two or three months after the
Government sale, he judiciously contrived to dispose of his selection,
which originally cost about £3OO, for the sum of £I2OO, to a
Mr. Porter, the owner and commander of a small trading vessel, who
was immediately thereafter, transformed into a member of the Legisla-
tive Council of New Zealand.
The example of the Colonial Secretary was followed with
various success by the other Government Officers, those of them who
had neglected to lake their grants instantly made selections, and
when it happened that their salaries were too small to make the grant,
(which was proportionate) a matter of much advantage, two would
unite the amount of their salaries, and make the selection in the name
of one of the parties, by which means they should be entitled, according
to the system, to a much larger quantity of land, than if each bad
separately applied. Such were the advantages arising from “ the
Auckland Official Land-jobbing Association, ’’ that every one of the
Officers appointed by the Home Government, instantly on their arrival
in the Colony, joined this profitable association—and selected. The
Judge and the Attorney General commended the scheme greatly,
judging by the fact of their having instantly fixed upon one of the
most beautiful and picturesque bays in the harbour for their selections.
By a reference to any of the published charts of the River Waitemata,
on the south side of which Auckland is situated, your Lordship will
perceive that the town itself includes two bays, and that three other
bays are in its immediate vicinity. The first bay is called Commercial
Bay, because the people were allowed to purchase some allotments
here.—Some being reserved for Government purposes.—One being
selected by the Colonial Secretary, and another by the Colonial Store-
keeper. The second has received the appropriate name of Official-
Bay, from the fact of its being nearly altogether taken up by the
selections of the Government Officers; besides, the residence of the
Colonial Secretary, the following gentlemen have taken their selections,,
and erected houses in this valuable and beautiful bay, viz.: Mr, Mathew,
late Surveyor General, now Chief Police Magistrate, Mr. Rough, Har-
bour Master, and Emigration Agent, Captain Mathew Richmond, one
of the Commissioners of Land Claims, Mr. Fisher, late Attorney
General, the late Captain Symonds, Mr. Coates, the High Sheriff,
Dr. Johnson the Colonial Surgeon, and Mr. Spain the Chief Commis-
sioner of Land Claims; the third Bay is still in the hands of the Go-
vernment, and unsold; the fourth is called Cooper’s Bay, from the fact


that this gentleman, who is now Collector of Customs, has, together
with Mr. Clarke the Protector of Aborigines, been fortunate enough in
obtaining possession of the whole Bay, as Suburban Allotments, though
according to Sir George Gipps’ plan, no Suburban allotment could be
taken up as selections, within two miles of the town—yet this Bay is
not distant half-a-mile from Auckland, and will in a year or two form
part of the town itself. Mr. Churton the Episcopal clergyman owns
a small Selection in the same Bay. The fifth, or Iniquity Bay, some
times called the Judge’s Bay, is entirely in the hands of the Judge and
Attorney-General, who have manifested more cupidity than modesty in
appropriating to themselves the whole of this lovely Bay. The Post-
master-General and the Surveyor-General have made Suburban selec-
tions of inferior value, and by no means injurious to the public
interests.
Independent of this profitable gambling in town allotments, the
Government Officers rendered themselves highly obnoxious to the public
by engaging in various branches of traffic. Some of them were engaged
in brickmaking, some as pig and cattle dealers, and others took contracts
from Government in the names of parties with whom it was well known
they were privately in partnership, to prevent the public from having
any chance of competing with them, and in order to secure to them-
selves any advantage that might arise from this source, as well as to
keep the matter as quiet as possible, none of the Government Contracts
were, until of late, publicly advertised for Tender.
This species of Land-jobbing has doubtless had great effect
in impeding the progress of the Colony as well as in bringing about the
present embarrassment of the Government itself; but the injudicious
system, or rather the want of system in the disposal of Crown Lands,
has been an equally fruitful source of mischief to the Colony, as well as
a most general and reasonable cause of complaint on the part of the
Settlers. Instead of adopting the system of selling Country Lands at
a uniform price of One Pound per acre, in accordance with the instruc-
tions received from the Home Government, at the time of the separation
of New Zealand from the Colony of New South Wales, and allowing
parties to select lands in any part of the Country they choose to fix
upon. The Government of this Colony put the instructions from home
at defiance in this, as in many other instances, and adopted neither the
uniform system, nor that of selling by auction at a low upset price, but
invented a plan of their own, by which, however much money they may
have at first succeeded in obtaining from the immigrants, they are now
unable to realize a shilling. The last lands that were exposed to sale
in accordance with this plan, were all withdrawn without a single offer,
excepting two allotments which were bought by the Colonial Treasurer,
Another absurdity in this system is the fact of allowing parties in
England a right which will notbe conceded to parties resident
in this Colony, as will appear by the correspondence attached
of this letter, wherein the Colonial Secretary acknowledges that he
has granted to Mr. Appleyard, a recently arrived immigrant, an indul-
gence which he will not concede to parties residenLin the Colony. A
species of favoritism for which the Colonists can see no just reason; and


a partiality, on account of which, many persons otherwise disposed to
invest money in the purchase of lands in this Colony, have been in-
duced to leave the country in disgust. Independent of this species of
favoritism, other circumstances have tended much to prevent the pur-
chase of Lands in New Zealand—such as the smallness of the Farms
exposed to sale, as well as the fixed determination on the part of the
Government to make choice of the worst lands in the Colony for dis-
posal to the Settlers.
Such, my Lord, is a hurried and imperfect sketch of some
of the public measures of this Government. It would have been an
easy matter to extend these remarks, could the time ot your Lordship,
or tlie limits of a letter, admit of it. To swell the general list of
grievances, innumerable instances of individual oppression and per-
sonal injustice sustained at the hands of the Officers of this Govern-
ment, might conveniently be added, such as the suppression of a News-
paper at the Bay of Islands, and another at Auckland, merely because
they expressed the opinions of the Public, and endeavoured to form a
just estimate of the measures and conduct of the Government; but I
feel that I have stated more than enough to convince your Lordship,
that the Government of this Colony has been grossly conducted, —that
the best interests of the Colony have been recklessly sacrificed, and
the rights of the European and Aboriginal inhabitants rudely assailed.
In short, that it would be impossible, judging by the acts of the Officers
of this Government, to come to any other conclusion, than that a
British Colonial Government, where the people have no voice, and
the servants of the Government are removed beyond the influence
of public opinion, and the control of their superiors must assume not
only the appearance, but the reality of the purest despotism, where the
very best institutions of our country are made to subserve the purpose
of the petty Colonial tyrant, and even the Courts of Justice themselves,
the pride and glory of our native land, are converted, in such a Colony
as this, where their constitution is left in the hands of ignorant and
irresponsible Rulers, into the most effectual, and the direst engines
of oppression.
While much of the evil which has befallen this Colony, is
justly attributable to the Local Government, it would be still unfair in
any general account of grievances, to overlook the errors committed
by the Home Government, or to withhold from them their just portion
of the merit arising from the ruin of a flourishing country.
One of the first, and greatest mistakes committed by the
Home Government, was the appointment of inexperienced men to th*
arduous undertaking of founding a new Colony. A despotic Govern-
ment like that of the British Colonies, requires at all times wise and
experienced men to render it tolerable to the persons who have been
accustomed at home to exercise the rights and privileges ot British
subjects. But when such power falls into the hands of ignorant men,
and sailors in particular, the people are made to feel that they have lost
the mixed Government of their native land, which is absorbed in a
tyranny exercised by the Colonial despot—the Governor, or it may be


as in this country, in a hateful oligarchy, consisting of the Officers
of Governmentthey are also made to feel, that they are no longer
subjects, but slaves ; —having neither a voice in the formation of the
laws that govern them, nor the slightest controul over the expenditure
of the revenue raised from their own industry. It is at all times a
much easier matter to govern an old Colony, than to found a new one.
In an old Colony the machinery is already in full, and perfect operation,
and experienced men, who understand, at least, the ordinary routine
of business, are at the head of all the departments. The Governor of a
new Colony, on the other hand, has every thing to perform himself, he
has to study, not only the nature ef the country, but also the character
of the people he is expected to govern. In accordance with the peculiar
circumstances of both ought his laws and institutions to be formed.
Every act performed by the founder of a new Colony is, generally
speaking, for permanent good or evil, if for the latter, it will take years
to remedy the error, and to remove its effects. A greater mistake
could never have been committed than to entrust the Government
of such a country as New Zealand, to the officers and crew of a man-
of-war, who, by profession and education, are peculiarly unfit for any
civil charge, coming as they do, from a school where knowledge is
scarce, and where the nature of the duty requires the exercise of
tyranny, and the submission of the slave.
The want of any form of representative Government is another
just cause of complaint against the Home Government, not only in
this Colony, but in many others, the evil has been severely felt in such
a community as this, where all the old settlers had in former days
exercised the right of assisting in the formation of those simple,
efficient, and equitable laws, by means of which order was preserved,
and justice dispensed, and where the sufferings of the more recently
arrived immigrants, were aggravated, by the fact that, in leaving their
native land, they were deprived of all the natural rights of men,
and had forfeited the political privileges of Englishmen, having
no alternative, but submit in despondency and despair to everv
species of oppression, insult, and injustice, their Rulers choose to
inflict.
It is a most extraordinary feature in the character of the British
Government, that while the people of England itself are under the
mildest possible laws, and enjoy the largest amount of liberty of any
nation in the world, the Colonies of England, which are justly es-
teemed her pride and her strength, are subjected to a dominion more
assimilated to that of Russia and Turkey, than anything else. In the
Colonies, the genius of British liberty is no longer to be found.—Her
mild sway is exchanged for the iron rod of the despot, and those who
were her children in her native land, have become the subjects and the
slaves of petty tyrants. The truth of this will be found in the history
of every Colony, and felt in the experience of every Colonist; its
effectshave been the prematura separation of the first American
Colonies, the recent rebellion and bloodshed in Canada, the ruin
of the present Settlers of New Zealand, the extravagant expea-
-2


diture of this Government, and the demand upon England for money
to support it.
The treatment of the Aboriginal inhabitants of this country,
is a subject for which politicians and writers on national laws may
commend the wisdom and craft of the British Government; but the
humane, the benevolent, and Christian man, cannot regard without
sympathy and regret, the present dejected condition of this intelligent
and spirited race of men, or contemplate without sorrow and shame,
the more than probable fate which awaits them. The Home Govern-
ment and the Directors of the New Zealand Company confidently
promise and assure us, that History will record one exception in
favour of New Zealand to the general and prevailing melancholy truth,
that wherever civilized men have established themselves, their footsteps
must be traced by the blood of the original inhabitants, and their suc-
cess embittered by the recollection that it has been accomplished by
the ruin, and attended by the complete destruction of the race which
preceded them. But while I sincerely trust that this may be the case,
I cannot still help remarking, that this happy exception, if it do take
place, will happen, not because I believe the same means will not always
accomplish the same end, or that any more humane system is acted
upon in the case of the Natives of New Zealand, but because I hope
from the character and intelligence of the New Zealander himself, that
he will, despite the attempt at oppression and injustice on the part of
British Authority, still be able to preserve some of his natural rights,
and to maintain his positiou in the land where Divine Providence has
placed him ;—notwithstanding, that England, or those acting under her,
have in a manner nothing different Irom the custom of former davs, by
first of all claiming the right of Sovereignty over him, either on the
plea of a purchase by means of blankets, or of unconditional cession
by treaty, endeavoured to deprive him of all his natural rights.—Al-
though he has been declared to he a savage, having no interest in, or
right to, the land he lives in, and although the liberty has been denied
to him of disposing of his own property as he will, and to whom he
chooses, I am still firmly persuaded, that the day is not far distant
when he will become so fully sensible of the gross injustice that
he has sustained, that England will be glad to leave to him either his
natural independence, or to confer upon him all the rights of a British
subject; he will not continue to sell for fifty pound’s worth of property,
(as in the case of the land given by Government to Mr. Clendon), land
which is sold immediately for thirteen thousand pounds. His own
character, and not the deception practised on the public in the shape
of Protectors, will save the aboriginal inhabitant of New Zealand
from the ordinary fate of savages.
Having devoted so large a portion of this communication to
the consideration of the various circumstances which have combined to
check the progress of this Colony, and to bring about the embairass-
ment of the Government, as well as the ruin of the present Settlers, I
feel that I should not he doing justice to this natural fine and promising
country, without proposing some remedy for the existing grievances,


and developing some plan by means of which the inhabitants of a
country so exceedingly feitile and admirably adapted for the abode of
man, might be rescued from their present unhappy position, and ena-
bled to apply themselves with energy and certain success to the work
of Colonization. In order that the Home Government may be fully
satisfied of the nature of the grievances under which the Colonists
suffer, as well as of the extent of the abuse of power and the mischief
committed by the Local Government, Commissioners should, with the
least possible delay, be sent from England to enquire into the state of
affairs in the C lony, with full powers to remove all or any of the
Government Officers they might deem expedient, to redress all existing
grievances, and to arrange a new state of things in accordance with
the requirements and exigencies of the Colony. All the Officers of
such a Government as this should be men of some education, intellect,
and above all, integrity; men who would make it a matter of duty and
principle not merely to live by the Settlers, but for the Settlers and the
good of the Colony ; and who should be above all from their good and
moral conduct not only an example, but a terror to all the evil doers,
whether Native or European. It is a sad and grievous error to sup-
pose, that the Aboriginal inhabitants of this or any other country will
improve in religion or morals, if we send men to fill the high places
among them, who are indifferent to both.—The evil example of one
man in power, will be more than enough to counteract the labours of
ten Missionaries, or any instructors of morality and religion. If it be
thus necessary to exercise so much care and discrimination in the ap-
pointment of the inferior Officers of Government, it is still more re-
quisite that they should be attended to in the selection of the Governor,
the successor of His Excellency the late Governor, should not only be a
wise, enlightened, and experienced man, but he should also be, if possible,
a civilian, who is intimately acquainted with Colonial policy, as well
as experienced in the ordinary routine of business—a man of energy,
judgment and decision, who would not only on account of superior in-
tellectual attainments, bat also on account of high moral feeling and
principle command the respect and deserve the esteem of those whom
he ruled.
The people should also be allowed a voice, in the manage-
ment of the affairs of the Colony, by extending to them those
valuable representative institutions which they have enjoyed at home.
Men, who have been all their life-time accustomed to feel, that they had
some share in the formation of the laws which governed the society
they lived in, will not easily accustom themselves to submit to, or yield
obedience or respect to laws that are framed and exercised without
the r consent or controul. A representative Legislature should be con-
ceded to the people of this Colony, so as to give them a voice in the
formation of the laws that govern them, as well as to enable them to
exercise some controul over the expenditure and application of the
revenues of the Government they live under. Had this right been
conceded to the inhabitants of New Zealand from the first, I need not
assure your Lordship that no demand should have been made on
England to defray the expenses of the New Zealand Government.


The next and most efficient remedy which 1 venture to propose to
Your Lordship, is the removal of the present anomalous condition of
the aboriginal inhabitants, who have been deprived of their own national
rights by the Acts of the Government and who are also denied the
rights of British Subjects. The only part of English Law which they are
allowed to enjoy being the privilege of being tried by the Criminal
Code. The right of property, the natural and inherent right of all men
and of British Subject in particular, is purposely withheld from the
native of New Zealand, until this right is restored to him he will never
look upon the ministers of Government in any other light than as op-
pressors, nor will he ever be taught to confide in their honor or become
reconciled to their institutions. He cannot be reasoned into the belief
that it is just to deprive him of the right of selling his land to whom he
will, while he sees that Europeans are daily allowed this privilege. The
natives of this country are widely different from either those of America
or New Holland, their reasoning and perceptive powers are fully as
acute as those of Europeans and they are exceedingly more jealous of
any attempt to deprive them of their rights. It will be argued I doubt
that in the event of restoring to the native the right of selling his land
to whom he would, England must abandon the idea of colonizing New
Zealand altogether, in as much as it might be apprehended that the
means could not, otherwise be provided for the purposes of emigration,
but justice to the native has nothing to do with this consideration, nor
will he be easily convinced of the propriety of taking his land from him
in order to procure more immigrants from England ; —but this objection
however will soon remove itself, —it is now the decided belief of almost
every person in New Zealand that no revenue can be raised from the
sale of land in the manner in which it has hitherto been disposed of,
and it is more than likely the natives will soon cease to sell any of
their lands to Government, or if they do it will be the worst as has
uniformly been the case hitherto. In proof of this, several instances
could be cited wherein the natives have already refused to sell their
lands to Government. At the Bay of Islands in the centre of the Town
of Kororarika they at the present moment own a small piece of land
which they have refused on every consideration to sell to the Govern-
ment. So strongly was this feeling manifested, that about twelve
months ago when the Government attempted to erect a Custom House
on a part of this land, the natives strenuously resisted and caused the
building to be pulled down and removed from their ground. On a re-
cent occasion the Government Surveyors were prevented by the natives
from cutting even a line of road from the Bay of Islands to Hokianga
through their grounds, on account of which the Government was
obliged to disist from the undertaking. So much do the natives value
their lands that there is not an acre in the whole of the North Island
which is not claimed or owned by some person. They are now so fully
alive to the advantage which the Government seeks to obtain, in com-
pelling them not to sell their lands to private individuals, as well as, of
the profits made by Government from the re-sale of their lands, that
they -vtrill either retain their lands altogether or dispose of them at a
rate so high as to leave the Government but little towards emigra-
tion.—But that even the selfish consideration of raising money for emi


gration may be removed out of the way of doing justice to the natives,
I would beg leave respectfully to suggest to Your Lordship a method of
honestly and fairly obtaining a fund for emigration without violating
the rights of natives or Europeans. This might easily be accomplished
by imposing a small tax per acre on all the unoccupied lands, whether
in the hands of natives or Europeans, this plan was formally proposed
to His Excellency the late Governor during the discussion of the last
Land Claims Bill, and it was clearly proved to him that from the lands of
the old settlers alone, a revenue of thirty or forty thousand pounds might
be conveniintly raised every year.
If justice will not induce the Government to concede this
right to the native, necessity and the result of the last Land Sales will
soon compel them to have recourse to a different system from that
which is pursued at present. They will soon find that the estimated
revenue of fifty thousand (£60,000) for sales in 1842. will be nothing
but a sad illusion, —Eight months of the time are now gone by and the
whole amount realised is not more than seven thousand pounds. If
the result of the ensuing four months may be anticipated in accordance
with the last Land Sales, they have little more to expect.
The last remedy which I would propose is one which I feel
persuaded would not only be attended with beneficial results to New
Zealand, but also to all the Australian Colonies; —it is the doing away
with the Customs, and declaring the Ports of New Zealand free. Tiie
impetus that such a measure as this would give to trade in this, and the
neighbouring Colonies, is incalculable. The loss in revenue could easily
and equitably be made up by means of a property and income tax,
which I doubt not the people would cheerfully pay. The present taxes
on Imported Goods are made to press heavily on the honest trader alone,
the facilities for smuggling being so great in a country possessing such
fine harbours, and such an extensive coast line as New Zealand as to
require a more efficient Coast Guard than that of England or Ireland
for its prevention. To such an extent is smuggling carried on in the
article of Tobacco alone that a short time ago it could in this country
be bought at lOd. per pound, duty paid, or said to be paid, while the
duty itself was a shilling.
In concluding this sketch of the wrongs of New Zealand I have
to apologize to Your Lordship for the length of the communication, as
well as for the apparent severity of my censure on the Government and
Government Officers. In extenuation of the latter offence, however,
1 would respectfully remark that I am not only a witness of the ruin
and misery in which the inhabitants of these magnificient Islands have
been involved through the unwise policy, and mischievous measures of
the Local Government, but that I am myself one of the principal suf-
ferers. It is impossible. My Lord, to suppress feeling, and difficult not
to manifest indignation itself in seeing the fruits of labour and industry
destroyed—the efforts of energy and enterprize thwarted—and the
designs of Providence Himself opposed, through the instrumentality of
men whose acts fully warrant me in characterising them as the most^


fatally unhappy, and mi chievous rulers, by whom the power and
authority of England have ever been exercised or abused.
I have the honor to be,
My Lord,
Your Lordship’s most Obedient,
and most Humble Servant,
S. M. D. MARTIN.
To the Right Honourable
Lord Stanley,
Principal Secratary of State for the Colonies.
P. S.- Since the first part of the above letter was written,
the reins of Government have, through the death of His Excellency
Captain Hobson, dropped unexpectedly into the hands of Mr. Short-
land, who now unites in his own person the two offices of Colonial
Secretary and Administrator of Government. Whether he will con-
tinue to follow the same line of conduct which he has hitherto advised
the late Governor to pursue, or, like a noted King of old, see “ the
error of his way,” is scarcely a matter of hope. Every man taken
from the Plough is not expected to follow the noble Roman’s example.
The days of disinterested patriotism are unhappily gone by, nor is
there any just reason to expect their revival under the Shortland
dynasty. The “ family compact” cannot and will not be dissolved
even for the good of the state. While the son is Governor, the
father in law will not be forsaken, and the brother, however low
the funds of the Colony may be, will doubtless be continued in
his recent office of Sub-Protector of Aborigines, until he shall
have acquired a sufficient knowledge of the Native language to
qualify him to step into Mr, Clarke’s shoes as Chief Protector.
Favoritism and every other species of abase have already injured
the Colony so much that the settlers’ hopes must rest entirely on
the justice of the Home Government. The Augean stable is so
full of corruption, and the “family compact” so firm, that nothing
less than a River of water can cleanse the one, or the strength of
a Hercules break the other.

Hekutaia, River Thames, May 22nd, 1842,
Sib, —X have the honor to inform Your Excellency that a party of natives, led
by the notorious Chief Teraea, went from this river a few days ago, to attack the tribe
at Tauranga, on the east coast. So well did they conceal their intentions, that even up
to the moment of their departure, no idea wae entertained by those who did not joinin
the expedition, as to what parly they were to attack, the consequence has been, that they
have returned this morning, bringing with them about twenty females and children as
slaves, and the heads and bodies of several others, whom they have sacrificed and
destroyed.
although I am aware that Your Excellency would be desirous of obtaining the
earliest information of a transaction so insulting to the Queen’s authority and sovereignty
over New Zealand, as represented by Your Excellency, 1 should still have hesitated in
addressing Your Excellency, were it not that they have not confined their depredations
to the Natives only, but, did on their return this morning, strip one of my stations
of every thing belonging to the men employed there, and refused to give up any part
of the property taken away.


This, I conceive to be a case calling for Your Excellency’s interference, as they
could have no plea whatever for committing such an outrage on my property, as I have
always studiously avoided having any transactions with them, from their well-known
character.
I am in expectation every moment of having all my property here destroyed, and
it is very probable that the lives of all the Europeans may be sacrificed in the ex-
terminating warfare that shall succeed this first outbreak. I therefore implore Your
Excellency to give us protection, either by punishing the parties concerned in these
outrages, or by sending a small military force to keep them m check.
Permit me to mention that this is the third time I have had my stations plun-
dered by the same parties, and that forbearance on every part, has only confirmed the
Natives in the opinion that Your Excellency has neither the power nor the wish to
protect us. May I also inform Your Excellency that several persons were engaged in
the present attack, who were no ways concerned in the cause of quarrel, and merely led
thereto through the love of bloodshed ; such persons as these are peculiarly deserving
of punishment.
Trusting Your Excellency will adopt prompt measures for the redress of these
grievances, and the prevention of a recurrence of similar outrages,
I have the honor to be.
May it please Your Excellency,
Your Excellency’s most obedient and humble servant,

Auckland, June 30th, 1842.
Sir, —I regret ranch to hear that Your Excellency still continues in bad health.
On calling this day, 1 was not aware of Your Excellency’s state of health ;
had 1 been so, I should be sorry, indeed, to trouble Your Excellency on matters of
business, however urgent.
1 have lately heard from my friend, Mr. M'Caskili, who represents the Natives
as being in an exceedingly excited state. He is every moment in dread of being at-
tacked by them. In the letter which he has addressed to Your Excellency, I believe
he has forgotten to mention, that Teraea and his tribe are those who threaten to attack
him ; he is not at all afraid of the Taurauga natives j but this savage is so elated with
his success, that he is determined to attack all the Europeans in his vicinity.
I trust Your Excellency will make some effort to preserve the lives and proper-
ties of Europeans in that part of the country, and convince this people that they are
now under British law and authority, and that these laws are not to be infringed upon
with impunity.
If Your Excellency will not send troops to keep the Natives in order, I hope
you will, at least, afford ua the means of making an effort to protect ourselves, by giving
us the use of some arms. From what Mr, M'Caskili has written, 1 apprehend he wilfe
feel himself under the necessity of defending himself, and will do so, perhaps, at the
sacrifice of bis own life, and that of some of the Natives.


Mr. Abercrombie returns in the Rory osMore0 s More to-morrow, Should Your Ex-
cellency think of sending some troops, this would be a favourable opportunity.

instant, in answer to my letter of the 2nd, regarding a robbery committed at one of my
Stations on the River Thames, by the Native Chief Teraea and his tribe, on their re-
turn from the Tauranga massacre.
I have to express my regret that the formality of applying to the Police Magis-
trate of Auckland, had not been suggested by His Excellency while my friend, Mr.
M'Caskill, was in town. 1 feel the more surprised at this, as he had come expressly
from the Thames to seek the proteclion of the Government, and to demand redress for
the outrage committed by the Natives, and had an interview with His Excellency on
the subject.
1 should have no hesitation in deposing before the Police Magistrate as to (he
truth of the robbery, but that the latter part of your letter appears to render this unne-
cessary, as it is slated, that His Excellency had been informed the outrage complained
of by Mr, M'Caskill, had been fully redressed.
I am still, however, unaware of any redress whatever having been afforded, and-
shall, therefore, feel obliged by your informing me of the nature of the same before
applying to the Police Magistrate, as the information contained in the latter part of


your letter would seem to do away with the necessity of complying with the recommen-
dation in the commencement of the same.

that if my last letter was deemed an Official communication, 1 cannot see any reason
why my former letter should not have been received as equally Official. 1 would also
take the liberty of stating that 1 had the honor of forwarding to His Excellency on the
30th of May, a letter from my partner Mr. McCaskill, dated 22nd May, addressed to
His Excellency, and giving a detailed account of the Tauranga massacre, as well as
of the robbery committed by Teraea and his party at one of our stations, on their
retuin from Tauranga ; on the faith of which communication, I understand, two
ambassadors, viz., the Colonial Secretary and the Protector of the Aborigines, were
sent by His Excellency to Teraea, although the result of that embassy has not as yet,
been communicated to the public.
In compliance with your request, I have now the honor of enclosing for His
Excellency’s information, copies of depositions made before the Police Magistrate, on
the 13th instant, the one by Mr. Charles Beverly Sampson, regarding the Tauranga
massacre, and the other by myself, regarding the robbery committed at one of my

the due course of justice, having been now attended to, and the subject having been

to suffer the punishment which such deeds deserve.

made by Mr. Sampson and myself, I have the honor to inform you that no doubt can
exist as to the fact that a most atrocious murder has been committed at Tauranga, by the
parties named in Mr. Sampson’s deposition, and that the very same parlies who perpe-
trated the murder, did, on their return to the Thames, rob some of my servants of certain
articles of property, as slated in my deposition.
From the tenor of your letter, as well as from your former indifference in regard
to the robberies committed by the Natives of Kaipara, at Mr. Forsailh’s place, and at
the houses of several Settlers at Wangari, I cannot help perceiving that you are much
more anxious to discover some means by which you think you may justify yourself in
overlooking these crimes, than to act promptly and decidedly on the too unequivocal
information laid before you, I have again, however, to request that you will, in your
capacity of Chief Police Magistrate, immediately issue warrants for the apprehension, at
least, of the perpetrators of the murders —as I have reason to hope it will he rather diffi.
cult to devise any plan by means of which the Public Authorities in this Colony can
justify themselves in allowing the perpetrators of such Crimea to escape unpunished,
1 need not inform you that the deposition made by me is precisely in the form
which you yourself suggested ; the men robbed were my servants; the property stolen
was blankets and wearing apparel, as stated in my deposition.

dertake to bring forward sufficient evidence to convict them.

4t a« to the exact nature of the complaint,” His Excellency would take “ such steps as

While I regret much to be compelled so frequently to bring this matter under

fested by the Public Authorises in regard to the Suppiession of Crimes so revolting to
humanity, and alarming in their consequences, both as respects the Native and Euro-

I trust, 1 need not endeavour to impress upon His Excellency, that the laws of
humanity, the safety of the European population, the present and prospective welfare of
the Natives themselves, as well as the laws of our Country, and the honor of our So-
vereign, demand that the Representatives of British Authority in New Zealand, should

APPENDIX 3.
No. 1.
Auckland, May 23rd, 1842.
Sir, —As requested by Your Excellency, I now take the liberty of addressing you
on tlie subject of the convocation which I had the honor of having whh Your Excellency
and the Attorney-General on Saturday last, the 21st instant, regarding my Land Claims,
but in doing so I scarcely know to what point to crave Your Excellency’s attention, as
it was not at all clear to me what the nature <f Your Excellency’s views were ; but the
impression left on my mind trom that extraordinary conversation was, Ist.—That Your
Excellency held that as my land (though purchased and partially paid for before the
Proclamation) had not been all paid for before that period ; and that, therefore, Your
Excellency “ was quite justified, and bad it quite within your power to throw aside my
Claim al'ogether,” But in consideration of some peculiar circumstances of my case,
that Your Excellency was inclined to make a compromise with me, by taking my own
land in the neighbourhood of the Township from me, giving me instead one acre of
ground in some other situation, for every ,£1 sterling which I had paid. Such is the
impression which one part of Your Excellency’s conversation left upon my mind. But,
again, I am led to believe that such views have not been finally decided on by Your
Excellency, from another portion of our conversation, in which Your Excellency and
the Attorney-General tried to shew \ he reasonableness and justice of such a course ; as
also, the propriety of my acceding to the hinted offer of compromise, which would have
the effect of preventing a reference of the claim to the Home Government, and thereby
save one year or eighteen month’s delay in getting the case decided.”


It is matter of great astonishment to me, that any difficulty should be found in
deciding a case, which, in my own humble estimation, appears so extremely simple, and
is shortly the following, as is well known to Your Excellency :—I came to New Zea-
land from Sydney in the month of February, 1839, and after seeing various parts of
the country, ultimately fixed upon this as being in every way suitable for my agricul-
tural views ; and in November and December, 1839, purchased two pieces of ground
from the Natives, and made them a considerable deposit, in part payment, till 1 should
have lime to obtain from Sydney the remaining part, (each party being bound by a
written contract for the completion of the agreement), not being then In possession of
the particular description of goods the Native? demanded. The Natives, before the
Commissioners, have all, without exception, admitted to the ful est extent, my having
purchased the land : indeed, they have rented portions of it from me again, and continue
to this day, to make me payments f r the same, so that not a shadow of doubt remains of
my having fail ly, fully, and honestly acquired said land from the Natives ; the only
question remaining being, as to how far my claim would be affected Lorn my having
paid part of the purchase-money after the date of the Proclamation 1
In my estimation this appears a very easily answered question—for there
can be no doubt, that the purchase was fairly made at the date when I made the
first payment or deposit, which deposit was an earnest of the bargain evidence of
a bargain haying been made as clear as if the full amount of the purchase-monej*
had been paid at the time, and a method of completing simple bargains adopted,
in almost every country, and in no portion of the globe held more sacred
than by the Natives of New Zealand. Nothing can # be more certain than that
1 was bound in honor and honesty to complete the bargain, which had thus
been made by me with the Natives; —had 1 not done so, I should have acted
the part of a dishonest man, and have 4)een scorned as such by them ; and such
being the fact, surely neither the Laws of England nor her Majesty’s instructions can
be such as to compel me to violate the laws of Nature, and the plainest principles
of justice and common sense, by preventing me making the second payments to the
Natives which I had promised—or in other words, refuse to give me the land which
I have now actually paid for according to my original agreement. Your Excellency men-
tioned at the conversation alluded to, a case of a similar kind, where a cler-yman in the
north part of the island, who had made a valuable purchase of 20,000 acres, and had
paid a deposit on it before the Proclamation, asked your Excellency's advice as lo
whether he should complete the purchase or not, when your Excellency recommended
that he should at least delay doing so; but, however prudent this course may have
been, 1 have no hesitation in repeating what X stated in conversalion with your Excel-
lency, that such a course, in my opinion, was not morally right, and that, as an honest
man, the clergyman was bound to complete the payments which he had promised, and
which the'nallves would have been perfectly justified in taking from him by force;
The Attorney-Geoerai, at this part of the conversation hinted, that the difficulty in ray
case might have been obviated, had the date of my title deeds been of the same date
with the deposit, in other ante-dating the deeds, which, in my humble opinion, would have
been as illegal, as it would have been immoral, and that by such a proceeding I should
have rendered my titles utterly invalid, and have put myself on a par with the clergy-
man above alluded to. In short I cannot see that I could honestly have acted other-
wise than 1 have done, and I feel the utmost confidence that my claim will, ultimately,
be allowed*
Your Excellency further stated, that in strict Law, I was not entitled to any
grant of land. I certainly cannot pretend to a knowledge of what may be deemed the
strict law of the case, though the little 1 do know inclines me to suppose, that, a bargain
of the nature of the present, where part payment is made when the transaction is
entered info, is held in strict law to be a perfectly binding agreement, which either party
may compel full performance of. But in the present case t submit to your Excellency,
that the strict law of the case should not be enforced—that equity and good conscience
alone should form the rule of decision, which is not only in harmony with the strict
principles of reason and justice, but is strictly in accordance with the published
instructions of her Majesty on the subject. On this point the Attorney-General stated,
that the “ investigation was conducted in equity, but that the decision was given
according to Law ” This distinction lam entirely at a loss to comprehend, as it seems
lo favour the idea, that Law and Equity are totally at vaiiance with each o .her,,and
that these opposing principles are to be applied to the same case.


I desire nothing at the hands of your Excellency, but what is- strictly honest
and right, though I am well aware that I could ugrs many peculiar circumstances
of hardship in my own*favor, I need only recall ro your Excellency’s recollection,
that when you first came to this district, long before this Township was established,
your Excellency found 1 had already commenced agricultural operations on a large
scale, and had made preparations for farming the very portions of land now in dis*
pute, when the hints which your Excellency gave as to the probabiliiy of your Ex*
cellency requiring the land for Government purposes, induced me to abandon my ope*
rations; unhinged all my plans, and after throwing me out of employment for some
time has forced me to enter into business in town at once, uncongenial to my taste, and
in a way which I never contemplated. One of the pieces of land which belongs to me
has already been taken possession of by your Excellency, and a portion of it sold to the
public for upwards of £600; and it disheartens me beyond measnre, after wailing
upwards of two years for your Excellency’s decision to allow me to obtain possession of
my land, to find that my hopes and expectations are now entirely blasted ; and that your
Excellency, in return for all this sacrifice on my part, offers me 298 acres, in some part
of New Zealand, for the £298 which I piid for the land in question ; a mere fraction
of which, as already stated, has realised to the Government upwards of £6OO. If such
should prove to be the decision of your Excellency,! have no hesitaton to here stating,
deliberately, what 1 stated in conversation to your Excellency, that I would much
|poner loose all than accept of such a paltry recompense, and that it will be the means
Oi driving me from this settlement, as the Government seems only to exist for the pnr-
pose of ruining and oppressing the settlers. Finding, from your Excellency’s statement
that this case of mine would form a precedent for the decision ot a great number of
similar cases, I have been the more desirous of stating explicitly and decidedly my views
of the subject; and, as the interests of others are to be so deeply affected, it would ap*
pear by my decision, I have deemed it my duty, in fairness to some of my friends sirai*
larly situated, to make them aware of my views on the subject, in which they’ entirely
concur; and as your Excellency stated that dissatisfaction with the proposed compro-
mise would cause the cases to be referred home, we have already lost so much time,
that a little more, in comparison with the sacrifice now expected from u«, seems of no
moment, and it is more agreeable to live in the hope of obtaining justice from home,
even at a long dale, than to accept of such a mockery of it here,
