ON THE LAND POLICY
NEW SOUTH WALES.
The Motto?? Quanto rectius hoc/'
That the Land 1 olicy of New South ales has for years produced
very unsatisfactory results is generally admitted, and it has
become a question of much interest, Have we departed from
sound policy in our management of waste-lands ? And if so, at
what point did we go astray ? Undoubtedly we have departed
fiom sound policy, and our point of departure was- when we
adopted the system of Gibbon Wakefield.
South Australia was the Colony founded upon his system as
an experiment, and in a few years they arrived at a deplorable
state of collapse when the discovery of the Burra Burra Cop-
per-mine restored animation, and a fair degree of prosperity was
attained, in spite of the vicious land-law. The discovery of
Ballarat and other rich gold fields signally demonstrated how
the Wakefield system failed in supplying the settler with labour
?for the emigrants arriving at Adelaide, quickly set out for
Ballarat.
In New Zealand the Wakefield system has been still more
disastrous, for to it must be ascribed the fierce hostility of the
Maori; he deeming himself swindled, when he saw the Crown
selling for the very land bought of him, for a penny.
The system was sharply criticised when first propounded,
McCulloch in his commercial dictionary asking most perti-
nently?
? Why sell the land at all ? ?


Your emigrant is not a rich man, the fact of his being an
emigrant shews him to be a man of small means ?and those
means will assuredly be sorely tasked, before he has made for
himself a home in the wilderness, and begins to receive a return
for his labour. Why diminish those means already full
small ? So reasoned McCulloch.
But we may further ask, Was the old system of Grant wrong
that it should be set aside? Was it wrong in principle ? The
two systems are clearly antagonistic; if the Wakefield system be
right, then the system of Grant is wrong, and vice versa.
Which then is right ? And which is wrong ?
Now this is not a question that arose yesterday. Blackstone
devotes a chapter to enquiring into the origin of property ;
after stating that the earth belongs to man by the gift of God,
as recorded in Genesis, he remarks upon Abraham?s well known
words to Lot ? Is not the whole land before thee ? if thou wilt
? take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou
depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.? This Black-
? stone says) plainly implies an acknowledged right in either to
? occupy whatever ground he pleased, that was not preoccupied
?by other tribes??and such occupation becoming continuous
is the origin of property in land ?so says Blackstone, and not
Blackstone only, ? Grotius and Puffendorf, Barbeyrac, Titius,
? and Mr. Locke all agree in this, that occupancy is the thing by
? which Title is originally gained, every man seizing to his own
? continued use, such spots of ground as he found most agreeable
?to his own convenience, provided he found them unoccupied by
?any one else,? ?Blackstone?s Commentaries, Book 11, Cap. 1.
This then is the natural mode of acquiring property in land in a
country where land lies waste, and consistently with this in the
days of Geo. 111, a free grant was made to him who would
and could go into the waste and occupy. ?But to demand a
money payment, ere a man shall occupy waste land is to erect a
barrier between man and God?s gift ?in defiance of God and
His command to man ?to subdue the earth.? To sell a Title
to the Waste was unknown to Christendom or Heathendom, until
in America Washington having successfully rebelled against


Geo. Ill?and thrown off Kingly rule?the rule by the grace
of God ?and commercial principles having the ascendant in the
minds of those who came to the top, the evil thought arose Why
let go for nothing that which will command dollars ? And in
course of time democratic principles extending in England and
the House of Commons usurping more and more the functions
of Government, the British Parliament forgot that the Earth
was God's gift to man, and decreed that Title to the Waste
should be bought for money !
Ah ! nation boutiquiere I Thus arose the Wakefield system.
Here in New South Wales the price at first was fixed at ss. an
acre ; and many of our settlers ruined themselves nr seeming
fine estates at so tempting a figure. After a while the minimum
price was raised to jBl. this effectually put a stop to the securing
fine>states for our children, at the cost of present ruin to the
fathers ; it had that good effect ; it had the further good effect
of introducing the squatting system. About that time some few
of the vounger sons of the English gentry arrived here as settlers,
these finding the land barred against them by the ï¿½1 an acre,
invested their little capital in flocks and herds, took them out
into the wilds and sat down, exercising that ? undoubted right "
which Abraham and Lot exercised 4000 years ago, settling
themselves upon such unoccupied portions of land as best suited
them, in fact fulfilling those very conditions which are the origin
of all property, according to Blackstone ; and had statesmanship
presided at the helm, and these pioneers been recognized each as
the owner of what he occupied we had avoided the Kettle of
Eish "?see appendix ;?for the Squatter having a Title, would
have been able to give a Title, and would have welcomed the
Agriculturist?the grower of corn and wine?indeed sought
him out, and gradually gathered such around him, and the
waste had been by degrees fully occupied, and harmoniously
too; for farmer and grazier are not natural enemies?the
antagonism which'we witness is a result of our silly legislation.
But where would have been the Land Revenue ?


It might have been in a far better condition than at present.
The Government dues, the License, the Assessment, the Rent
(hateful word) might have been merged in a Land-tax, a tax
which every Grant ought to have been held liable to. an ever
increasing source of revenue. What would the land-tax amount
on even a few acres of ground in Sydney ? say CampbelTs
Wharf for instance estimated @ one per cent on the mere site,
without improvements ? this calculation might help us to con-
ceive what the land revenue might by this time have amounted
to, had we made occupation and the payment of the land-tax
the basis of ownership?the two points which in every squat-
ting case each party labours to prove that he has complied with
that his occupation has been from the first, and continuous, and
that he has paid the Government dues, and according as these
points are proved, so the Court rules. Perhaps the decisions of
our Courts of Law may yet be our safest guide out of the muddle.
Let us decide that man to be the owner exactly as our Law-courts
do let us regard the purchase money of the Land as the redemp-
tion of the Land-tax he who has bought and paid for his
land, has redeemed the Land-tax, and cannot be called upon for
it again; the squatter who has not bought his land, has not
redeemed the Land tax, and would have to pay it for ever, for the
redemption of the Land-tax should not be allowed?not listened to.
house.
The akefield system partakes very much of the nature of the
plan of granting a renewal of a Lease upon the payment of a fine.
? This practice, Adam Smith says : is in most cases the expedient
?of a spend-thrift, who for a sum of ready money sells a future
?revenue of much greater value ; it is inmost cases therefore
?hurtful to the Landlord?it is frequently hurtful to the Tenant
?it is always hurtful to the Community.? '
Another evil resulting from the Wakefield system is that it
makes an opening for the Speculator, an evil forcibly pourtrayed
by Dickens in the Eden of Martin Chuzzlewit.


The Northern Territory of South Australia seems to depend
for existence upon the land speculator?existence such as it is.
ImQueensland they have perpetrated the even more glaring
absurdity of allowing Speculation in Runs. A manmaygoout
there, mate marks on four trees, 20 miles apart, name the inter-
vening country ? Loch-aber? pay into the Treasury a certain
sum as assessment on Loch-aber, may do this annually, indeed
upon 20 Loch-abers, and altho? he has not put a hoof upon it,
can fend off the bona fide grazier who arrives there with flocks
and herds, but declines to give the Speculator his price.
A further evil of the Wakefield system is that the Surveyor
must precede the Settler, and a large proportion of the land fund
is thus fritered away, whereas a Survey would be unnecessary
were occupation made the ground of ownership?all Europe?
all Asia, was settled and became private property without a survey.
The evil results of the Wakefield system are manifold : injurious
to all the parties concerned, and may all be got rid of by
substituting for it the old practice of mankind.
Stare super vias antiquas.
The truth is, our English preconceptions blind us in the
* \
Colonies, in respect of the value of waste land.
In the enumeration of Job?s riches, we find thousands of
sheep?thousands of camels ?thousands of she asses, &c., but no
land is mentioned.
What land his animals required for pasture was Job?s of course
?a bagatelle ?plenty more like it a few miles on, to be had for
the taking up.
So of Homer?s heroes, the rich ones are TroXv/irjXog?
tro\vf3ovrr]g of many sheep ?of many cattle.
Ulysses had a thousand sows.

? KETTLE OF FISH.?
From the Sydney Morning Herald, August Qih, 1866.
AMENDMENT OF THE LAND LAW.
In the Northern parts of the colony some of the free selectors
have begun to agitate for a change in the land law. This is a
result we have anticipated, and one which is a good omen. That
the law would have to be changed, and that there would be no
general contentment and satifaction until it was changed, has been
clear to all who could fore cast its inevitable working ; but so long as
the proposal to change did not come from the democratic side, there
was little prospect of its achievement. Mr. Robertson had taught
his followers to consider the law as perfection and that to whisper
any doubt was treason against the popular cause. In this, as in
other matters, the people surrendered their judgment to his, until,
by a painful experience, they have found out that both he and they
have been wrong.
The free selectors have discovered that the Act will not work to
their satisfaction, that the law can be used against them as well
as for them, and that in the battle of life everything is not on
their side. Their principal complaint relates to the grazing right
?a vague privilege which we have always pointed to as likely to
become a fertile source of contention, but which did not develope
its full characteristics till free selection was extended to the
pastoral areas. A very short experience of the operation of the
law on the pastoral districts has sufficed to develope the antagonism.
Hitherto it has been the squatters who have complained as to the
way in which the law would work; now it is the free selectors
who complain as to the way in which the law does work. The
one says he is greatly and needlessly injured ; the other says
that he does not get advantage enough. When the Act was under
discussion we pointed out that the effect of it would be to establish
a kind of civil war upon every run on which this system told with
any effect. This is precisely what is happening. Under legal
