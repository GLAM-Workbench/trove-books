Warehouseman William Robson of Petersham in the said Colony
Gentleman Robert William Conway of Ashfield aforesaid
Gentleman Benjamin James of Stanmore aforesaid Gentleman
John Corbett of W averley aforesaid Bookseller and Thomas
Cummins of Paddington aforesaid Gentleman (respectively herein-
after throughout called “ the said Trustees”) of the second part and
Arthur Wigram Allen of the City of Sydney aforesaid Solicitor
of the third part Whereas in order the better to understand
the intent and meaning of these presents it is desirable to recite
briefly the origin and formation of the Societies of the people
called Methodists (that is to say) In the year One thousand
seven hundred and thirty-eight a few persons m London England
agreed to meet with the Reverend John Wesley formerly of
Lincoln College Oxford and afterwards of the City Road London
Clerk for the purpose of religious conversation singing and
prayer which Society as it was called had increased by the early
part of the Year One thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine to
about Sixty persons and in April of the same year the said John
Wesley being in Bristol a few persons in that City also agreed
to meet weekly with the same intentions as those who met in
London under the advice and religious direction of the said John
Wesley and of his brother the Reverend Charles Wesley similar
meetings were also commenced at Kingswood and Bath but in
the year One thousand seven hundred and forty a part ot
the Society in London placing themselves more immediately
under the pastoral charge and ministerial direction of the said
John Wesley agreed to meet together in a building called the
Foundery in Moorfields which he had purchased and converted
into a place of religious worship and the same disposition to place
themselves under the pastoral charge and ministerial direction cf
the said John Wesley (and his said brother Charles Wesley)
appearing in the Societies before mentioned at Bristol and other
places which the said John Wesley regularly visited for the
purpose of preaching the Gospel and giving spiritual advice a
body of Rules was drawn up in the year One thousand seven
hundred and forty-three for the Government of the said Societies
and entitled “ The Nature Design and General Rules of the
United Societies in London Bristol Kingswood Newcastle upon
Tyne &c.” And which rules were signed by the said John
Wesley and Charles Wesley and became then and continue to be
the Rules by which all persons united in the said Societies weie
(and are) required to conduct themselves and in default of which
they were to be excluded from the said Societies . And in the
manner above-mentioned was instituted and established first in
London and then in other places as aforesaid the Religious body
now generally known by the appellation of “ The People called
Methodists ” And Whereas in order that the pecuniary con-
tributions made by the said Societies for religious and charitable


purposes might be managed with regularity one or more of the
Members of each of the said Societies was or were from time to
time appointed to be a “ Steward ” or “ Stewards ” of the Society
of which he or they were for the time being a Member or
Members and which steward or stewards at first managed all the
temporal concerns of the said Societies but afterwards stewards
for the Society and stewards for the poor of the Society or as they
are now commonly called “Society Stewards” and “ Poor
Stewards ” were respectively appointed And that the objects of
the said Societies might be better effectuated the said John
Wesley formed or divided them into small companies called
“ Classes ” of about twelve persons in each Class over each of
which Classes one of the members of the said Societies was
appointed and called “The Class Leader ” And Whereas the
said people called Methodists having rapidly increased in number
and new Societies having been formed as aforesaid in many
and various places the said John Wesley appointed certain
persoffs (some of whom were Clergymen of the Established
Church of England and others of whom were ordained or set
•apart to the ministry by himself and other Presbyters of the
Church of England) to preach and expound God’s Holy Word
unto the said Societies and to form new Societies under his
guidance and direction And the more effectually to promote
order and good discipline among the Societies so formed the
said John Wesley from time to time as occasion required
collected or associated together such of the said Societies as
existed in places contiguous or of most convenient access to each
other and which collections or associations of Societies were
called “ Circuits” And the said John Wesley annually appointed
■one or more of the said preachers to itinerate or travel from
place to place in each of the said Circuits to which he or they
were respectively appointed to visit the various Societies therein
to form new Societies and to preach and otherwise exercise his
and their office as ministers of the Gospel but under the direction
and guidance of him the said John Wesley. And in each of the
said Circuits one of the said preachers so appointed was directed
specially to superintend the others or other of them and to take
the chief charge and care of the Societies in the Circuit over
which he was so appointed and who was at first and during the
lifetime of the said John Wesley called “The Assistant ” but is
now generally known amongst the said people called Methodists
by the appellation of “ The Superintendent ” or “ The Superin-
tendent Preacher ’ of the Circuit to which he is for the time being
appointed and in every Circuit there was or were from time to time
appointed from among the members of the Societies in each respective
Circuit a Steward or Stewards called the “ Circuit Steward ” or
“ Circuit Stewards” whose business it was to take charge of and
apply to their intended purposes the various collections of moneys

Recital of Mr
Wesley’s Deed
Roll
Conferen"J” arly
made to meet the expenses of such Circuit And Whereas the-
Circuits so formed as aforesaid have been from time to time
increased in number altered changed subdivided or consolidated
as from time to time appeared necessary or expedient And
whereas the said John Wesley in or about the year one thousand
seven hundred and forty-four invited several of the clergymen
and preachers connected with him to meet in London to confer
upon matters relating to the doctrines discipline regulation and
government of the said Societies and similar meetings or
assemblies of the said preachers being afterwards held annually
they obtained the appellation of “ The Yearly Conference of the
people called Methodists ” minutes of which Yearly Conference-
have for many years past been printed and published annually.
And Whereas on the 28th day of February 1784 the said John
Wesley duly made and published a Deed Poll or Deed of Decla-
ration which was enrolled in the High Court of Chancery and;
wherein after reciting that divers buildings commonly called
Chapels with a messuage or dwelling-house or other appur-
tenances to each of the same belonging situate in various parts,
of Great Britain had been given and conveyed by him and also by
divers other persons from time to time to certain persons upon
trust that the Trustees thereof should permit and suffer the said
John Wesley and such persons as he should for that purpose from
time to time nominate and appoint at all times during his life at
his will and pleasure to have and enjoy the free use of the said;
premises that the said John Wesley and the person so appointed by
him might therein preach and expound God’s Holy Word and
upon a similar trust in favour of his brother Charles Wesley and
his nominees during his life and after the decease of both of them
then that the said Trustees and their heirs and assigns for ever
should permit and suffer such persons and for such time and times
as should be appointed at the Yearly Conference of the people
called Methodists and no others to have and enjoy the said pre-
mises for the purposes aforesaid.
And whereas the said Deed Poll further recites that for
rendering effectual the Trusts created by the said several Gifts and
Conveyances and that no doubt might arise with respect to the
same the said John Wesley as the donor of the said several pre-
mises had thought it expedient to explain the words “ Yearly
Conference of the People called Methodists " contained in all the
said Trust Deeds and to declare what persons were members of
the said Conference and how the succession and identity thereof
was to be continued. Then the Deed Poll declares of whom the
said Conference had always consisted and further declares that the
one hundred persons then named in the Deed Poll did on the day
of the date of the Deed Poll constitute the said Conference and


that they and their successors to be appointed as the Deed Poll
prescribes and subject to the Regulations therein prescribed
should for ever be taken construed and be the Conference of the
people called Methodists.
And whereas the said Deed Poll prescribes that the Confer-
ence might admit into connection with them or upon trial any
persons whom they should approve to be preachers under the care
and direction of the Conference the name of such persons with the
time and degrees of their admission being entered in the Journals
or Minutes of the Conference. And the Deed Poll prohibits the
Conference from appointing any person to the use and enjoyment
of the said Chapels and premises who is not either a member of the
Conference or admitted into connection with the same or upon
trial or to appoint any person for more than three years success-
ively to the use and enjoyment of the same Chapels and premises
except ordained Ministers of the Church of England.
And whereas the said Deed Poll gives authority to the Con-
ference to expel and put out from being a member thereof or
from being in connection therewith any person member of the
Conference or admitted into connection or upon trial for any
cause which to the Conference seems lit and necessary.
And whereas the following is the 13th Article or Regulation
of the said Deed Poll : “ And for the convenience of the Chapels
and premises already or which may hereafter be given or conveyed
upon the Trusts aforesaid situate in Ireland or other parts out of
the kingdom of Great Britain the Conference shall and may
when and as often as it shall seem expedient but not otherwise
appoint and delegate any member or members of the Conference
with all or any of the powers privileges and advantages herein-
before contained or vested in the Conference and all and every
the acts admissions expulsions and appointments whatsoever
of such member or members of the Conference so appointed and
delegated as aforesaid the same being put into writing and signed
by such delegate or delegates and entered in the Journals or
minutes of the Conference and subscribed as after mentioned
shall be deemed taken and be the acts admissions expulsions and
appointments of the Conference to all intents constructions
and purposes whatsoever from the respective times when the
same shall be done by such delegate or delegates notwithstanding
anything herein contained to the contrary.”
And whereas a copy of the said Deed Poll is contained in the
First Schedule to this Deed and it is hereinafter referred to as “The
Deed Poll of 1784” and the “Yearly Conference of the people
called Methodists ” is hereinafter referred to as the “ Yearly
Conference.”

Death of John
and Charles
Wesley.
Formation of
Districts.
Model Deed.
And whereas the said John Wesley died in the year 1791 his
brother Charles Wesley having previously died.
And whereas in or about the said year one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-one the Yearly Conference for the better main-
tenance of the economy of the said people called Methodists united
into “ Districts ” the circuits which had been formed by the said
John Wesley in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland
of which Districts nineteen were formed in England two in
Scotland and six in Ireland and each of which Districts consisted
of several adjoining circuits and the Yearly Conference have since
from time to time increased the said Districts in number and
subdivided or otherwise altered the same as they deemed necessary
or expedient. And in order that the lusiness and affairs of the
said Districts might be properly and regularly conduct ed the Yearly
Conference have annually appointed for each respective District
one of the preachers stationed for the time being in a Circuit
within such District to be the “ Chairman of the District ” and a
meeting of the Preachers within each respective District is called
and generally known among the said people called the Methodists
by the name of the “ District Committee ” or “ District Meeting.”
And whereas in order to attain uniformity in the Deeds of
Settlement and Declarations of Trusts of Chapels School-houses
and other hereditaments and premises thenceforward to be settled
upon trusts for the benefit of the said people called Methodists
the Yearly Conference caused to be prepared in the year 1832 “A
Release of Freehold Ground for the purposes of a Methodist
Chapel with a Declaration of Trusts intended as a Model Deed
to be referred to in subsequent conveyances ” and the said Deed
is now' known and used and referred to as “ the Model Deed for
the settlement of Wesleyan Methodist Chapels.”
And whereas the said Model Deed after reciting at length
the said Deed Poll of 1784 conveys the piece or parcel of land
hereditaments and premises therein described to Trustees in trust
to build thereon a Chapel or place of Religious Worship and a
dwelling-house or dwelling-houses vestry room school room and
other offices and appurtenances or with or without them as the
Trustees shall deem fit. And upon further trust to permit and
suffer the said Chapel with the appurtenances to be used occupied
and enjoyed as and for a place of religious worship by a con-
gregation of Protestants of the said people called Methodists in
the connexion established by the said John Wesley and for public
and other meetings and services held according to the general
rules and usages of the said people called Methodists and to
permit and suffer such person and persons only to preach and
expound God’s Holy Word and to perform the usual acts of


religious worship therein as shall be from time to time approved
and for that purpose duly appointed by or under the authority of
the Yearly Conference from time to time held under the orders
and regulations of the said Deed Poll of 1784. And the said Deed
enables the Trustees with the consent of the Conference testified
in writing under the hand of the President thereof for the time
being to sell the premises and provides for the appropriation of
the purchase money.
And whereas the said people called Methodists are also some-
times called Wesleyan Methodists and their Chapels have been
called Wesleyan Methodist Chapels or Churches: And whereas
since the year 1832 the said Model Deed has been generally
adopted with only such variations as the circumstances of each
case have required for the settlement of Wesleyan Methodist
Chapels in Great Britain and it has been so adopted for the
settlement of Wesleyan Methodist trust properties in Australasia
in which term is included in this Deed the continent of Australia
and the several colonies and settlements on the said continent
including New South Whiles South Australia Western Australia
Victoria and Queensland and also Tasmania New Zealand and
the Fiji and other Polynesian Islands.
And whereas an Act was passed in the year 1839 by the
Governor and Legislative Council of New South Wales (2 Vic.
No. 7) to regulate the religious affairs of Wesleyan Methodists
Independents and Baptists whereby the Trustees appointed under
an Act of 1837 (7 Wm. IV. No. 3) were authorised to transfer
chapels and lands held by them to new Trustees to be held upon
the Trust stated in any Model Deed recognised and established
by the usages of each particular Society.
And whereas in the year 1840 a Model Deed was prepared
for the settlement of Wesleyan Methodist Chapels in New South
Wales which after reciting the foregoing facts conveys the pre-
mises therein comprised upon similar trusts to those declared by
the English Model Deed and by virtue of which such persons
only are authorised to preach and expound God’s Holy Word and
perform the usual acts of religious worship therein as shall be
duly appointed by or under the authority of the Yearly Conference
and the said Model Deed was enrolled in the Supreme Court of
New South Wales and similar Deeds have been executed in the
other Australian Colonies and under such Deeds all the property
settled in trust for the people called Methodists in the said
Colonies is held.
And whereas the Yearly Conference in the year 1854 resolved
that the Australasian and Polynesian Missions then under the
direction of the Yearly Conference should thenceforth be called

poses of which connexion the Yearly Conference constituted “The-
Australasian Conference” consisting of Missionaries who were
then members of or admitted into connexion with the Yearly
Conference and of such other Ministers as should thereafter be
received by the Australasian Conference into its own body subject
nevertheless to the maintenance of the doctrine and discipline of
the Yearly Conference and to the power on the part of the Yearly
Conference to disallow any rules made by the Australasian
Conference inconsistent with such doctrine or discipline.
And whereas between the years 1855 and 1873 the Austral-
asian Conference has with respect to Australasia exercised the-
powers of the Yearly Conference relating to the admission and ex-
pulsion of Ministers and has appointed to the use and enjoyment
of Wesleyan Methodist Chapels and trust properties in Austral-
asia Ministers in connection with such Australasian Conference
but not strictly in connection with or expressly appointed by the
Yearly Conference or by any Delegate duly appointed by the
Yearly Conference in conformity with the Deed Poll of 1784.

ference constituted four annual conferences, severally called the-
New South Wales and Queensland Conference the Victoria and
Tasmania Conference the South A ustralia Conference and the New

every three years or at such other intervals more or less as it may
deem expedient and made and adopted a new constitution which
constitution was approved by the Yearly Conference and is set
forth in the Minutes of the General Conference of the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Church held at Sydney in the Colony of New'
South Wales in the year 1878 and is also set forth in the Second!
Schedule hereto.
And whereas an Act of the Imperial Parliament passed in the
year 1876 and entitled “The Methodist Conference Act 1876”
after reciting inter alia that doubts existed as to the delegation by
the Yearly Conference of its powers and authorities to the Austral-
asian Conference and as to whether the admissions appointments
and expulsions by the Australasian Conference had been legal and
that it was expedient that such doubts should be removed : And
whereas the said Act confirmed all such admissions appointments,
and expulsions by the Australasian Conference and authorised the*
Yearly Conference to delegate or confer upon any Conference or
Conferences elsewhere than in the United Kingdom of Great Bri-
tain and Ireland all or any of the powers privileges and advan-
tages vested in the said Yearly Conference which powers privileges

THE SECOND SCHEDULE REFERRED TO.
PLAN FOR ANNUAL AND GENERAL CONFERENCES.
Whereas the English Conference held at Birmingham in 1854
by the adoption of a plan for that purpose formed the Wesleyan
Missionary Society’s Australasian and Polynesian Missions into a
distinct and affiliated Connexion to be called the “ Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Connexion ” and provided among other things
for the holding of the Annual Conferences of such affiliated Con-
nexion at Sydney Melbourne Adelaide Hobart Town and if found
practicable at Auckland and other places And whereas such Con-
ferences have heretofore consisted of ministers only and whereas
the Conference held in Sydney in 18/ 3 approved of the principle o
lay representation in the Conferences of the Australasian Wesleyan
Methodist Connexion within limits to be subsequently defined And
whereas the same Conference by and with the consent of the
English Conference made and adopted a new Constitution foi such
Connexion providing among other things for the holding of Annual
and General Conferences in lieu of the Annual Conferences there-
tofore held but containing no provision whatever for lay represen-
tation. And whereas at the General Conference held at Melbourne
in 1875 it was resolved that while such Conference distinctly
asserted its maintenance of the New Testament doctrine that
the ministry derives its existence from Christ and that upon Chris-
tian ministers to whom is entrusted the duty of taking “ heed to
all the flock over the which the Holy Ghost hath made them over-
seers to feed the Church of God ” devolves the solemn responsi-
bility of enforcing godly discipline and administering the pastoral
government of the Church and whilst it regarded this principle as
beincr essential to the Scriptural fulfilment of the ministerial office
and so vital to the constitution of Wesleyan Methodism that in
the admission of laymen as members of the Conference it must be
held to be sacred and inviolable it appeared to such Conference to
be advisable that the principle of lay representation should be
applied with the least possible delay to the Annual and General
Conferences of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Connexion
and that the Constitution thereof should be accordingly amended
It was therefore enacted by the First General Conference which
held its Sessions in Melbourne in 1875 by and with the consent
of the English Wesleyan Methodist Conference that so much of
the various Constitutions or Plans relating to the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Connexion as is inconsistent with or repug-
nant to the Constitution of such Connexion as hereinafter con-
tained shall be and the same is hereby repealed and that for the
future the following shall be the Constitution of such Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Connexion that is to say
The Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church shall as here-
tofore be divided into four Conferences viz.—l. New South Wales


and Queensland Conference which shall include the South Sea
Missions; 2. Victoria and Tasmania Conference; 3. South Australia
Conference (including Western Australia) ; and 4. New Zealand
Conference. These Conferences shall meet annually and shall be
comprised in and governed by a General Conference which shall
hold its session once every three years or at such other intervals
more or less as it may deem expedient.
The Constitution and Powers of the Annual and General
Conferences shall be as hereinafter stated that is to say—
Annual Conferences.
I.— Constitution.
1. The Annual Conferences shall comprise all the ministers
within their respective boundaries who have been admitted by the
English Conference to the full work and office of the Christian
ministry and been received by the Australasian Conference and of
such other ministers as have been received either by the Austral-
asian Conference or by the annual Conferences of the Australasian
Wesleyan Methodist Church and of such as shall be hereafter
received by the said Annual Conferences together with an equal
number of laymen.
2. The Quarterly Meeting of each Circuit shall be entitled to
elect one Lay Representative who shall be elected by ballot at the
quarterly meeting next preceding the session of the Conference
to which such Circuit pertains.
3. The Committee of each Institution of the Connexion to
which a minister is or may be set apart by an Annual Conference
shall have the right to elect from among the members of such
Committee by ballot one Lay Representative.
4. Should the number of Laymen thus provided for be less
than the number of Ministers pertaining to any Annual Confer-
ence additional Laymen shall be elected by the quarterly meeting
of the Circuit or Circuits which according to the returns published
by such Conference at its last session contained the largest num-
ber of members The Presidents of the several Annual Conferences
shall give notice to the Circuit or Circuits which may be entitled
to elect more than one lay representative.
5. The Laymen eligible for election as Representatives must
be church members of four years’ continuous standing and at the
time of their election must be members in the Circuit by which
they are or may be elected.


ll. —Powers of the Annual Conference.
1. Each Annual Conference shall have the same powers as the
English Wesleyan Methodist Conference in regard to
(1.) The election of its own President and Secretary.

their boundaries.
