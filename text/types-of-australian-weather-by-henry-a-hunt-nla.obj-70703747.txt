TYPES OF AUSTRALIAN WEATHER.
Henry A. Hunt,
Second Meteorological Assistant, Sydney Observatory.
[With Forty Diagrams.]
In continuation of the valuable work on Australian Meteorology
which the Hon. Ralph Abercromby initiated several years since,
by offering a money prize for the best essay on Southerly Bursters;
he has recently selected the phases of Australian Weather which
are treated in the following twenty studies of ? Types of Austra-
lian Weather.? Many of these appear to be peculiar to Australia,
and at the same time connected with Equatorial and other weather.
That they throw much new light upon the source of the greater
part of Australian rain, and show how these rain storms develop
out of ordinary weather conditions is certain ; at the same time
they form an important contribution to the study of weather in
the Southern Hemisphere generally. The work has been done
by Mr. H. A. Hunt, at Mr. Abercromby?s expense, and Mr.
H. C. Russell, has edited the work.
GENERAL REMARKS.
As a general rule, weather is set fine when anticyclones move
rapidly, and in a straight line across Australia, i.e., at a rate
exceeding five hundred miles per day. And weather is unsettled
when they move slowly, and not in a straight line, i.e., in a zigzag
line, especially if they show no appreciable forward motion for a
day or two. When anticyclones move in low latitudes the con-
ditions favour dry weather, in high latitudes, wet weather,
especially if they rest for a time south of South Australia.
All the examples of weather phases which follow have been
selected from the Sydney Weather Charts, and illustrate each
type. The originals were carefully traced, and then reduced from
22" x 17" to the size used in this essay by means of the camera.
Gg?Dec. 4,1895.


Ordinary symbols have been used, except the circle half filled
for thunderstorms, and the straight line shading; parallel lines
indicate the area of rainfall under one inch, crossed shading over
one inch.
TYPE I. ?MOVING ANTICYCLONES.
One of the best marked features of Australian weather is the
steady easterly progression of all the types, and the governing
type, that in fact about which all the other types seem to congre-
gate, is the anticyclone ; it has therefore been placed first in the
series, with three charts to show the progress made by a quick
moving one in forty-eight hours. The average daily progress of
anticyclones is four hundred miles per day, but the speed at times
rises to one thousand miles. 1
Investigation so far leaves no room to doubt that in these lati-
tudes a series of anticyclones surround the globe; the latitude of
the average one varies with the season, being farther south in
summer than in winter. The normal circulation about an anti-
cyclone brings southerly winds in front of them, and northerly
winds in the rear, hence our cold and our hot winds.
Chart No. 1 shows the position, on 15th August, 1893, of the
eastern half of an incoming anticyclone; it rests over Western
Australia, while the departing one is seen over the Tasman Sea;
between these is seen the usual \ depression, which is of average
intensity, and a dormant tropical low pressure to the north. In
Chart No. 2 the anticyclone has moved nearly nine hundred miles
in the twenty-four hours, the centre being located near Bowler?s
Bay, north of the Australian Bight; the antarctic \ depression
is well across the Tasman Sea, while the tropical or monsoonal
isobar depicted in the previous chart has apparently merged into
the high pressure system, a curious and not unusual kink being
formed to the north-east of it, following the contour of the Gulf
of Carpentaria. On Chart No. 3 the anticyclone is shown to
have moved a further seven hundred and fifty miles, or a total of

the monsoonal dip is still noticeable south of the Gulf, while

Zealand.

The passage of this anticyclone was an unusually rapid one,
and is presented as portraying with a minimum number of charts
the easterly motion of anticyclones over Australia.
TYPE II. ?MONSOONAL RAIN STORM.
This type is undoubtedly the chief rain agent in the Australian
Continent. Monsoonal depressions or tongues may occur at any
time of the year, but particularly between the months of September
and April, and most frequently during January, February and
March. The readings of barometers in the depression seldom fall
very low, the grade from the surrounding areas to the centre of
the tongue ranging from one to three-tenths of an inch generally;
the depression may intensify, that is the tongues between high
pressures may protrude further south anywhere during their passage
across Australia, but show a preference to do so after they have
crossed central Australia, a fact which suggests that the heated
interior has at least some influence in their development.
When and wherever the tongue is well defined, rain certainly
follows in its track, and thunderstorms as a wide spread and
simultaneous feature are never experienced without it.

On April 18th and 19th, 1894 (Chart Nos. 4 and 5) occurred one
of the finest monsoonal rain storms on record, the area affected
being very extensive, embracing the whole of the eastern colonies,
Tasmania, and the greater part of South Australia. Many inches
up to five and six?of rain were recorded on the north-east
coast of Queensland, and over the eastern half of the rain area
the country benefitted to the extent of over two inches generally
before the storm was over.
On this Chart No. 4 the monsoonal isobars, after passing the
most southern part of the tongue, are shown sweeping round a
high pressure of considerable energy, situated over the Great
Bight. Following these isobars to the eastward, we find them
recurving over another high pressure of greater energy in the
Tasman Sea. On Chart No. 5, both anticyclones will be noticed to
have worked northward, and while so doing they have lost some-
what in pressure, and the low pressure tongue has extended further
south and broadened ; at the tip, two cyclonic rain centres will be
observed to have formed.
The chart antecedent to 18 th April presented the general
characteristics of Chart No. 1, except that the antarctic \ depress-

ion was a considerably less active feature, but on the other hand
the monsoonal dip was somewhat more pronounced, and possessed
two instead of one isobar. Following the 19th, the chart of 20th
revealed no sign of the monsoonal tongue, and the continent was
covered with a high pressure of very slight energy.
TYPE 111. DEVELOPMENT OF A CYCLONIC STORM IN LOW LATITUDES
PROM A MONSOONAL DEPRESSION.
In Type No. 3 we have the development of a cyclonic storm
out of a monsoonal depression. The seasonal peculiarity of this
phase of the tropical low pressure is similar to that in Type No, 2.
The cyclone seems to develop when the southern extension of the
monsoon is out of proportion to its width, and it becomes so
narrow at one part of it that the opposing winds which circulate
round it interfere, set up the cyclonic circulation, and it then
progresses eastward as a rain storm. (See Charts 6 and 7.)
These storms frequently develop in South-east Queensland,
and they are generally most severe there ; the quantity of rain
which sometimes comes with them is very remarkable, as in the
case of the phenomenal flood in Brisbane in 1893, which was the
result of one of these storms.

iso .... v sal,
The example selected and shown in Charts 6 and 7 took place
on September 28th and 29th, 1892; on the 28th (Chart 6), it
appears that one of these storms had developed in the previous
twenty-four hours, at the southern end of a narrow tropical or
monsoonal tongue of low pressure. An anticyclone of good energy
lies to the east of it, with its isobars extending well to the north
and contracting the width of the tongue in the north; another
anticyclone lies to the west, and this also seems to be pressing on
the narrow monsoonal tongue and helping to contract its diameter,
at the same time the energy in both high pressures is adding force
to the circulation of the wind, and so aiding in the development
of the cyclonic circulation. A modified \ depression exists to the
south-east of the Australian Bight, and there is another over New
Zealand.
On September 29th, (Chart 7), the small cyclone has extended
its area and energy on its way to the coast, but its motion of
rotation has been rapid, and this probably accounts in a measure
for the comparatively small area over which rain has fallen,
although, in this instance, over an inch of rain fell in the central

and eastern parts of New South Wales. The winds circulating
about the western isobars of this storm are rather stronger than
usual in such cases. In the twenty-four hours both anticyclones
have lost a considerable portion of their energy, while that of the
depression in New Zealand is about the same as on the previous
day.
TYPE IV. ?DEVELOPMENT OF A CYCLONIC STORM IN HIGH LATITUDES
FROM A MONSOONAL DEPRESSION.
These are somewhat similar to Type 3, but the rainfall is
usually not so heavy, and the wind much more violent.
Chart No. 8 shows the development of one of these cyclones on
April 15th, 1889; in this case the monsoonal depression had
extended across Australia into the Australian Bight. The
development of one of these storms is heralded by the strong
easterly gales on the south-east coast of South Australia and
south coast of Victoria. The energy of wind circulation increases
over South Australia, and as the whole system moves bodily east-
ward from the Australian Bight to the mainland, the circulation is
seen to be that of a fully developed cyclone of small area, with a

diameter three to five hundred miles, formed out of the southern
part of the extensive monsoonal depression.
In Chart 8 a high pressure is shown over the south-western
part of Australia, and evidently encroaching on the moonsoonal
about central Australia.

In Chart 9, the western anticyclone has extended northwards
and has seriously contracted the diameter of the monsoonal low
pressure, thereby facilitating or helping to cut off and start the
cyclonic storm in the south ; which has now developed a much
steeper barometric grade and an energetic wind circulation, and
is moving eastward without extending the rain area.
Chart No. 10 shows comparatively little motion in the cyclone,
but it is considerably distorted, especially to the west, where the
anticyclone is compressing the isobars by its easterly progress and
in its endeavours to maintain its rate has overridden the cyclone
in the north. As will be seen by a glance at these three charts,
the rain resulting from this storm was most extensive and bene-
ficial, and the winds under its influences were strong.
TYPE V. ?CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR THUNDERSTORMS.
Upon comparison of charts setting forth this type with those
of cyclonic thunderstorms, they will be found very similar; the/
main difference being the absence in this set of the cyclonic area
at the end of the monsoonal tongue. The chief feature indicating

Conditions for thunderstorms / V /
L //&/g \ * - x ? -*
thunderstorms is the narrowness of the col 1 and somewhat con-
gested state of isobars in the his;h pressures west and east of it,
resulting in opposing winds. Those of the tropical tongues are
hot and charged with moisture, while those of the A depressions
are strong and dry. This type is met with during the monsoonal
season. The rains resulting from this feature are not generally
heavy, and though thunderstorms may be experienced over exten-
sive areas of Queensland, New South WAles, and Northern
Territory, a number of them may occur without any rain falling.
Chart No. 11, January 17th, 1893, shows an extended and
narrow tongue lying between two relatively high pressures, a A
depression similarly situated also exists in the south, this col or
area of low pressure separating these two depressions is very
small, and opposing currents of wind are noted there as blowing
within close limits. Thunderstorms were occurring or had
occurred in Northern Territory generally, over a great part of
Queensland and in central parts of New South Wales, the rains
upon this occasion, as is often the case, were not heavy, though
they fell over an extensive and generally unfavoured area.

On Chart No. 12, the following day, though a few storms were
recorded, shows a great diminution in number. The col has
widened and the monsoonal tongue has lost to some extent its
thundery characteristics, having widened at the end. The
accompanying barometric systems show no motion since the
previous day, but the high pressures have intensified.
TYPE VI. ?CYCLONIC THUNDERSTORMS.
This also, like the preceding one, is allied to the tropical low
pressures, but in this case a defined cyclonic circulation develops
in the lower extension of the tongue without the usual intensifi-
cation of grades. From this source the thunderstorms radiate in
easterly and southerly directions, and at times, as in the instance
presented, a vast area is affected.
Chart No. 13, December 12th, 1893. As on the previous set
the monsoonal tongue lies over much the same country, though
with its axis more east and west; the high pressure to the west is
very small, and the systems are somewhat fragmentary.

On the following day, Chart No. 14, a cyclonic circulation has
formed in the end of the tongue, while the \ depression over
Sydney on the 12th has moved eastward and nearly filled up, and
the high pressures have followed and intensified. The thunder-


storms and rains were not so general as on the thunderstorm
type, but curiously, were recorded in an almost parallel area of
country, nearly three hundred miles wide by twelve hundred
long. Though great barometric changes have taken place, the
pressures remain about the same as on Chart No. 13.
TYPE VII. ?A RAIN STORM WITH VERTICAL AND NEARLY STRAIGHT
ISOBARS.
This type is one of the best defined and reliable of the series
for forecasting purposes, because with them, good general rains
almost invariably come. They are the rear isobars of a departing
anticyclone, and the wind circulation from north and north-east
brings into the interior winds laden with tropical moisture to
meet in the west southerly winds laden with antarctic cold,
and therefore precipitating power. The sequence of rain is
rendered even more certain if rain be recorded in the north-east
before the isobars straighten, or in the \ depression to the south.
The actual height of the barometers is not material, but the
greater the number of isobars in a given area, the more extensive
will be the rainfall; the rain usually lasts three days. The rain
begins to fall north-west of New South Wales, spreads southwards,
then eastward, and finally northwards, crossing the mountains
near the Queensland boundary. A fine example of this type
occurred on 15th, 16th, and 17th October, 1894. (Charts 16, 17.)
On the 15th, Chart 16, a departing anticyclone rests over
Tasman Sea, and its rear isobars are shown running north and
south over central Australia; another anticyclone is shown over
Western Australia and a y\ depression east of the Australian
Bight; a trough of low pressure rests over Central Australia from
north to south. On this day the only indications of the pending
rain were found in the cloudy skies generally over South Australia,
western parts of New South Wales and Queensland, and a small
area of rain in South Australia.
In Chart 16, the straight isobars of Chart 15 have entirely
disappeared, but the rain has come over Central and South

Australia. Excepting the Gulf country and its central area, all
Queensland, all New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania had

TYPE VIII. ?CYCLONES FROM NORTH-WEST.
From time to time fully developed cyclonic storms appear on
the north-west and west coasts of Australia, and in the Australian
Bight, but the absence of observing stations in the unoccupied
country which lies between the overland telegraph line and the
west coast of Australia, makes it impossible to trace them over
that part of the continent, but cyclones are well known on the
northern coast of Western Australia, and their formation in the
tropics equally well known. There can therefore be no doubt
that when we find a cyclone on the western coast of Australia
or in the Australian Bight, that it is one which has come from
the north-west, and is in fact recurving to the east and south-east
as they do on the east coast.
The one selected for Type 8 was picked up on the west coast of
Australia in Latitude 28� on July 4th, 1892, (See Chart No. 17).
The winds were light, but the rain heavy along the coast; an inert
anticyclone rested over South Australia, Victoria, and New
South Wales, where it was moving to the east and making room
for the approaching storm.

Chart 18, July sth, shows that the whole system has moved
rapidly, that the cyclone now with an elongated centre lying
north-west to south-east now rests over South Australia, strong
winds are rapidly developing, and the barometric grade about the


centre is much steeper, and rain has fallen over the south coast
generally and extended northwards almost to Central Australia.
On July 6th at 9 a.m. the weather chart presented the features
shown in Chart 19. The cyclone has intensified all round, and
has moved rapidly to the east, its centre is just entering
Bass? Straits; very heavy gales from south-west are blowing
in the rear of the centre; heavy rain is falling over Victoria and
extends over the greater part of New South Wales. All the winds
controlled by this storm were very heavy, and during the 6th
July, as the storm passed through Bass? Straits, extremely heavy
weather was experienced there. On July 7th it had filled up.
TYPE IX. TORNADOES.
These occur during the summer months, and are most frequent
in the western plains; they are developed in hot weather and in
the low pressure known as a ? Col ? between two high pressures,
when there is not enough grade to control the winds and the heat-
ing power of the sun is great; if to these there is added the pre-
sence of moisture from recent showers, we have all the
for the formation of a tornado. The force of wind is often suf-
ficient to break off growing trees, two and even three feet in
diameter, and the reason there is so little damage to life and
property is not the want of power, but the sparse population and
the very small number of towns.
Chart 20, March 20th, 1894. An extensive anticyclone lies
south of Australia, giving way in its central parts to an extensive
monsoonal dip. The isobars are generally uniform and of even
gradients, though a suspicious interval exists to the west of New
South Wales between the 300 and 29-9 curves. This is un-
doubtedly the area in which the secondary developed. Light rains
were recorded in New South Wales and Victoria, but in Central
Australia temperatures were high.
Chart 21, March 21st. A marvellous change has taken place.
The area of high pressure on the previous day over the Tasman
Sea has lost two-tenths in pressure. The monsoonal dip so pro-

nounced then has retreated, and is now only represented by one
isobar, and where the western portion of the anticyclone existed
on the 20th, an antarctic depression has protruded itself, and lastly
an anticyclone is entering Western Australia. Thus a most
favourable and extensive col area exists between these four systems


for the generation of these storms. The winds are generally-
blowing any way, and excepting those of the eastern high
pressure have apparently no circulating power.
These were the conditions at 9 a.m., but as the day advanced
the col area advanced with its arid heat, and this acting upon the
precipitated moisture of the previous two days, resulted in the
tornado which we are about to describe, and which occured at
Bourke on the morning of March 21st, being one of the most
terrific ever witnessed in that district. It struck the town at 10
o?clock, but could be seen approaching for some time from a
north-westerly direction. It only lasted six minutes, but during
that period thirty-nine points of rain fell, and several hundred
pounds? worth of damage was done to houses. Chimneys, veran-
dahs, trees, etc., suffered and general consternation prevailed.
Many narrow escapes occurred, as the cyclone came across the
common from the direction of Fort Bourke. The theatre was
unroofed and a quantity of beams and iron was deposited in an
adjoining yard. Pleasure boats on the river were sunk, and a
steam-boat was considerably damaged by the falling of a large
gum tree.
TYPE X.?CYCLONES FROM NORTH-EAST.
A comparatively small number of these storms reach the coast
of Australia, and owing to the almost complete absence of observ-
ing stations, New Caledonia excepted, and the small number of
vessels passing their tracks, it is usually impossible to trace their
course before they reach Australia, but there seems to be no reason
to doubt that they are more or less spent tropical cyclones, which
reach Australia in the act of recurving. The majority reach the
coast of Queensland between latitudes 20� and 26�; some farther
north and south ; only one has been traced from the coast inland,
and then recurving there to south-east. It reached the coast in
the neighbourhood of Brisbane in January 1893, passed inland
over the mountains, gradually curving to south past Mudgee and
Dubbo, thence curving easterly it left the mainland about latitude-
-35� S. Its course was marked by violent cyclonic wind and rain.

Picton reported 4-76" rain. It has not been possible to present
this as an example, because one of the days was a Sunday when
very few observations are recorded.
As a rule these north-east cyclones recurve at the coast line.
Charts 22 and 23 show the weather conditions on March 10th
and 11th, 1891.
On March 10th there was a sudden fall of pressure on the coast
of Queensland, about latitude 24� (Chart 22), and an accession
of wind and sea which clearly heralded the coming storm. This
was intensified on March 11th, (Chart 23) by a further fall of
three-tenths of an inch, and three more isobars of the cyclone were
marked on the coast south to south-east; gales prevailed in its
neighbourhood with very heavy rains.
On March 12th, (Chart 24) the anticyclone had retreated to
New Zealand, and the cyclone travelled to the south along the
coast intensifying as it came. The barometer curve at Brisbane
was exactly of the cyclone type and dropped to 29?5. In the
southern part of Queensland and northern of New South Wales
heavy southerly to easterly gales were experienced. On the 13th
the storm had disappeared to the eastward.

TYPE XI. ?SOUTH-EAST GALES.
The south-east gale here referred to is peculiar to the east coast
of Australia, and it has been responsible for the most memorable


i i<r K types

wrecks on this coast. For the most part these gales appear to be
partially spent cyclones, which come in from north-east or east,
and travel down the coast until they begin to recurve to th&-
eastward.
The warning of their coming is usually very short; it consists
of a sudden increase in the sea on some northern part of the coast
with wind from east to south, and falling barometers, while the
high pressure over Victoria and South Australia becomes inten-
sified and progresses into the Tasman Sea. The south-east circula-
tion about this anticyclone increases in force with the increasing
barometric grade, and also by the wind circulation about the
cyclone, and the effect of the two causes acting together is to
produce a most serious gale. Rarely, these storms originate in
a monsoonal depression somewhere over South Australia, which
travelling eastward intensifies on the east coast. Heavy rain is
a marked feature of these storms, but it is confined to the coast,
and rarely if ever extends inland.
The storm selected to illustrate this type was a very severe one,
and began on September 23rd, 1892, about 6 p.m. The barometric
conditions antecedent to it are shown in Chart 25 ; the main

features being the bend in the high pressure isobars, and the
dormant low pressure off the coast of Queensland.
At 9 a.m. on this day there was nothing in the local weather
conditions which would lead one to anticipate the gale that
eventuated, the winds being generally light, and at Sydney only
a light breeze was blowing from the South-south-west ; but at 3
p.m. an unusual fall took place in the barometers to the north-east
of New South Wales, and the winds there were freshening gener-
ally. On preparing a chart at this hour we found the depression
was intensifying and had a cyclonic tendency; at 6 p.m. in
Sydney the wind, which had been blowing from the south-east
and gradually increasing in velocity, reached the force of a gale,
a thick driving rain began to fall, which continued with little inter-
mission until daybreak next day, when over 2" were registered,
and an extensive area around the metropolis benefitted to the
extent of an inch and upwards; the barometer at this hour also
began to fall rapidly and steadily, until at 5 a.m. on the 24th it
read 29?203, and the wind had reached in one squall, lasting only
a few seconds, the extraordinary rate of one hundred and twenty
miles per hour, the mean rate of the gale being thirty-two miles
per hour.


At 9 a.m. on the 24th, (Chart 26) the cyclone was s.till in an
active state, but it had passed to the south of Sydney and was
receding from the coast; the barometers were rising rapidly on shore,
and before noon a light northerly wind was blowing. On the 25th
September, the day following the gale, the weather everywhere
was generally fine, while all that remained of the energetic high
and low pressure systems were parallel isobars lying over the
southern areas of Australia with very shallow gradients. This
gale was very destructive and did much damage to property in
Sydney; in some instances houses were unroofed, and the wind
and sea on the coast were very heavy.
TYPE XII. ?DEVELOPMENT OF A CYCLONE FROM A A DEPRESSION.
The distinction between a \ depression and a monsoonal low
pressure is not by any means well defined, and it is possible that
this should be taken as a variation of Type 3; there are however,
marked differences, not only in the shape of the isobars, but also
in the wind ; and the most decided distinction is perhaps the
easterly wind circulating round the southern part of the monsoonal
low pressure and the northerly and southerly winds about the \ ;
but in some cases, as in the one selected, the wind circulation is
mixed, northerly, southerly and easterly winds being present, and
these from their want of energy tend to throw the forecaster off
his guard. The season is, however, some guide, as these storms
are most frequent from September to April.
Their sphere of influence is very extensive, as may be noted in
Chart 28, which shows rain over half Australia as the apparent
result of this storm. Most of these storms take a direct easterly
course over New South Wales and Victoria or through Bass?
Straits. At times they move to north-east, the Polar winds being
more energetic, and this feature intensifies all the storm and rain
conditions. The winds in all these storms are violent, and in
some very destructive.
The one selected for illustration appeared first on 27 th May,
1893, (Chart 27). At 9 a.m. on that day, a dormant and irregular

si 27 26 so
A depression existed over the Australian Bight, the winds were
moderate northerly and southerly, as usual in such conditions,
there were a few light easterly winds. Isobars were close over
eastern Victoria, but there was nothing which seemed to indicate
the violent cyclone that developed during that day over southern
parts of South Australia and south-west of New South Wales.
(See Charts 27 and 28.) This storm formed in the rear of a very
substantial anticyclone, then over the Tasman Sea, and it should
be noted that it did not act as a secondary and travel round the
southern and eastern parts of the high pressure, but it moved
towards the northern side of it and against its circulation, thus
proving its own Polar impulse and energy, and giving rise to very
strong gales and steep barometric grades with great fall of
temperatures; these conditions produced extremely heavy and
wide spread rains, not only within the storm isobars, but over the
whole of the eastern half of Australia. We have no means of
tracing the rain to the west of the overland telegraph line, because
there are no observing stations there.
May 28th was unfortunately a Sunday, and we have no obser-
vations for that day, but on the 29th the cyclone is seen in full

strength covering the southern colonies of South Australia and
Victoria, and the greater part of New South Wales; its isobars
are unusually symmetrical and its rain influence the most exten-
sive we have on record. During the 29th and 30th rain continued
to fall over considerable areas, although on the 30th the depression
filled up and the storm was displaced by the high pressure coming
on from the west.
TYPE XIII. WESTERLY WINDS.
The Winter anticyclone (See Chart 36) is much nore extensive
than the Summer one, and its grades are steeper and circulation
stronger, while its latitude is further north, often up to 30� S.;
hence the circulation on its southern side, unlike the Summer one,
affects the mainland of Australia and gives us our westerly winds.
And just as the trade wind intensifies its northern circulation by
adding force thereto, so the brave west winds of the southern
ocean follow the general move of the weather systems northwards,
and thus add force to the westerly circulation of the anticyclone,
and its greater dimensions increase the size of the A depression,
so much that it no longer has the sharply defined change from

notherly to southerly winds, but from north-west to south-west
winds; all these conditions combine to strengthen the westerly
circulation, until at times they seem to be like the brave west
winds of the roaring forties.
On the east coast they extend further north than they do inland,
and at times include Brisbane within their influence. When
very strong the anticyclone is elongated and the southern isobars
are flattened. (See Chart 30). They are very cold and dry,
having all the raw feeling of the easterly winds of England, and
have been known to last for several weeks without intermission;
they are the most persistent winds during our winter. In heavy
westerly winds the cold is very severe in Bass? Straits, between
the south coast of Victoria and Tasmania, rain, hail, and sleet being
very common. It is almost needless to say that on land they
bring very little rain, and they rapidly dry up the soil. The
severe drought of 1895 was largely due to the persistent westerly
winds which rapidly dried up the occasional rains; this feature
becomes intensified if instead of coming from due west they blow
from north-west.

Turning now to the charts of the westerly gale selected for
illustration, it will be seen in Chart 29, that this storm began on
September 3rd, 1895; on that day an elongated anticyclone lay
over Western Australia, a flattened and extensive a over New
South Wales and Tasman Sea, and the winds generally displayed
great energy, as might be expected from the close isobars, and
unusually low barometers over Tasmania ; light rain was falling
on the coasts of South Australia and "Victoria.
On September 4th, Chart 30, the anticyclone is more elongated
and the A flattened until its isobars are nearly horizontal, and
heavy westerly gales swept all the south-eastern part of Australia
and all Tasmania. On the 3rd the wind at Sydney at noon for a
short time reached a velocity of seventy-eight miles per hour. On
the 4th the wind was less gusty, but its average velocity was quite
as strong as it was on the 3rd.
TYPE XIV. SOUTHERLY BURSTERS.
The southerly burster is a well known feature or type of Austra-
lian weather, so well marked in character indeed that it requires
no special training in meteorology to recognise it; its character-


istics are so obtrusive that they cannot be overlooked, and they
are welcomed as the most pleasant relief after the high tempera-
tures and oppressive northerly winds which precede them. They
come in the late spring, all summer, and part of autumn, but as
a rule, in order to get a strong southerly an antecedent excessively
hot day or days must be experienced. The duration of a southerly
burster may be anything from two hours to ten days, but it is not
to be understood that the term burster is applied to the whole
period or duration of the southerly wind. What is called a
burster is the squall or sudden and violent change of wind direc-
tion, and the violent rush or ? burst ? which marks the advent of
this wind. We need not go into all the characteristics; these will
be found in the Abercromby Prize Essay on this subject. 1 It is
there explained that the south wind comes in front of an approach-
ing anticyclone, and that it is felt from West to Eastern Australia,
but it is only on the eastern coast, where, aided by the smaller
friction of the ocean and the shelter which the mountains afford
from other winds, that the southerly becomes more vigorous and
rushes northwards in a squall, which happens so suddenly and
with such force, that at times ships drag their anchors in Sydney
harbour.
It is not definitely made out yet that these storms are ever
? line storms ? in the sense that the change of wind comes as the
dip in the isobars passes over each place in succession, but there
are many facts which suggest that such is the fact in some instances.
Our present purpose is to describe a ?burster? as a type of
Australian weather. The essential feature of it is a sharp
A ; in Chart 31 such a depression is shewn existing over Victoria
and Tasmania, with its axis lying from north-north-west to south-
south-east. An anticyclone of good energy for this time of the
year exists to the west, and hot northerly winds occupy northern
Australia; these are the elements for the good burster that
followed. As a general rule, 2 the position and character of two

such systems as shown would bring the burster to the coast of
New South Wales within twenty-four hours; in this case it took
thirteen hours.
November 16th, light to fresh north-east winds were blowing
on the coast at 9 a.m., while in the front of the high pressure
strong south-west winds were blowing. In Chart 32, the southerly

is shown in full force in front of the anticyclone, which by the
way has lost none of its energy since the previous day; the
depression is well off the coast and on its way to New Zealand.
This burster reached a velocity of forty-nine miles per hour, and
lasted thirty-five hours.
TYPE XV. THE BLACK NORTH-EASTER.
This is a somewhat uncommon but nevertheless well known
type of weather on the coast about Sydney. Its characteristics
are a very strong and persistent north-east gale, continuing day
and night for two or more days; it has been known to last five
days and nights, and it ends with the advent of a southerly
burster. Its cause is found in an extensive col, the rear of one
anticyclone being at rest over this coast, while another lies over the
Australian Bight. If the grade is rather steep and the system
at rest for several days, then the north-east wind persists with
force proportionated to the grade, until the whole system moves
forward ; the southerly winds in the front of the approaching high
pressure then displace the north-easter and the storm is over.
There have been no good examples of this type since weather
charts have been printed here. Chart 33 shows the necessary
forms of isobars, but the grade is not steep enough for a gale.

TYPE XVI.?WIND BLOWING CONTRARY TO ISOBARS,'
In this type the wind blows with considerable force in a direc-
tion directly opposed to that which the isobars would lead us to
expect. For instance in No. 34, it will be seen that an extensive
high pressure rests over the east coast, and the isobars are com-
paratively close together. The normal circulation with these
isobars would be fresh north to north-west winds, when, as a
matter of fact, strong southerly winds were blowing as far as
Sydney with a velocity of thirty miles per hour. Such conditions
are rather troublesome in forecasting; fortunately they do not
come often, and the fact is not confined to southerly winds. The
general direction of the coast line is northerly bearing east a little,
a range of mountains from two to four thousand feet high
runs nearly paralled to it, and this local formation has a very
important effect on the circulation of the wind ; as in Chart 34
it seems to have more effect than the isobars, and probably the
grade was rapidly intensifying and had not been long enough in
existence to fully control the winds. It seems probable, so far as
this type has been studied, that we should find that when the
wind blows contrary to isobars, it does so because of some impulse
given to it before the new grade had time to control the circulation.

TYPE XVII. SUMMER ANTICYCLONES.
One of the most marked features of weather in Australia is the
regular easterly motion of it in all seasons of the year, added to
this the anticyclones ?the controlling element in our weather?
change with the sun, so that the latitude they follow in their
easterly progress is further south in summer than in winter. 1 The
summer latitude is about 40� south. They are less extensive in
summer than in winter, and do not so completely control our
weather as they do in winter, for their southern position leaves
room for the southerly extension of monsoonal low pressures,
which make a great deal of our weather; but the anticyclone
makes the change from hot northerly to cool southerly winds, the
bursters of the east coast.
TYPE XVIII. WINTER ANTICYCLONES.
During the winter months the antiyclones are much larger than
they are in summer, and their latitude about 30� S,; very com-
monly their area is equal to Australia, and their control of the
weather more complete than it is in summer. Fine weather

marks their centres, and the rains come chiefly from the low
pressures between each pair of anticyclones, and the strong
westerly gales are but part of the circulation about these high
pressures. (See Charts 29 and 30.)
The one selected for illustration occupied the whole of Australia
on June 4th, 1895, Chart 36. Its form was remarkably sym-
metrical, and in the central area the barometers read 30-6, which
is somewhat unusual, hence the circulation is active, and in
northern Australia where the trade wind adds force, it is very
strong. Under the central influence of these great anticyclones
the whole of Australia enjoys fine weather.
TYPE XIX. SQUARE HEADED A DEPRESSION.
This type is a variation of the usual \ depression, but is
sufficiently characteristic to be placed by itself as a type or rather
a sub-type. Its isobaric peculiarity, as may be seen by refer-
ence to Charts 37 and 38, is that there is a flat top or square
head to the isobars of the \, the usual form of which is a sharp
and regular curve, and the marked feature of this is that under
it the weather is remarkably squally and charged with thunder

and hail storms, and deluges of rain. This type is not peculiar to
any season of the year, and the country they affect is usually
south of Lat. 30�. The particular square headed a depression
under discussion occurred in July, 1891. Its effects were wide-
spread and its life persistent, and its peculiarity in a more or less
distinctive form was maintained during its passage over six degrees
of longitude, and its effects most severe in Victoria.
In Chart 37, July Bth, 1891, the square headed A is shown
when over South Australia. The gradients about it excepting
those on its eastern side were moderate; winds were from fresh
to strong. Following it is a high pressure of decided energy, and
preceding it to the east an anticyclone of little or no character ;
on the previous day rain fell over greater part of the southern
seaboard and in Tasmania.
Chart 38, July 9th, the depression has become more extensive,
but has lost energy. The relative powers of the anticyclone
remains the same, winds were generally lighter, but the rain
covered a much wider area than on the previous day. As this
storm moved to the east its characteristic weather was maintained.

TYPE XX. ?THE ADVENT OF AN ANTARCTIC STORM.
This is a type of weather that does not often visit Australia
but its severity makes it noteworthy for the winds and weather
which come with it are very destructive, and the cold severe, it
might almost be called a southern blizzard; yet the warning is
short and often difficult to read, for it comes from the Antarctic
where we have no out stations.
The storm under consideration began to affect the south coast
of Australia, making the winds fresh to strong on June 21st,
1892, (Chart 39), yet the season (winter) and the general conditions
pointed to westerly winds, and said nothing definite of the storm
which was telegraphed on the morning of June 22nd, (Chart 40).
Barometers were then seen to be four-tenths lower in Tasmania
than they were on the 21st, and the wind had increased to a
furious gale along the south coast of South Australia and Victoria,
and the isobars indicate a very steep grade commensurate with
the wind. On shore also the wind rose in places to hurricane
force; at Ballarat, in western Victoria, buildings were unroofed
and trees blown down. So severe was it there that the storm is
recorded as the Ballarat storm.

In South Australia and New South Wales the wind did a great
deal of damage without reaching the intensity it had in Victoria.
The isobars show a retreat of the anticyclone and a tilting of the
major axis, and a very remarkable increase in the number of
isobars on the south coasts of South Australia, Victoria, and


Tasmania. It looks as if the low pressure had retreated and its
western parts forced their way north. What probably did fake
place was that a storm centre south of the Australian Bight and
indicated by the northerly winds in Chart 39, had in the interval
surged northwards on to the west coast of Victoria, bringing with
it all its antarctic energy and severe cold. This view is sup-
ported by the fact that there was in the twenty-four hours but
little change in the New Zealand isobars, and further by the
upward tilting of the eastern part of the anticyclone caused by
the northing of the antarctic storm, and lastly by the blizzard-
like cold which was so marked a feature of this storm.
