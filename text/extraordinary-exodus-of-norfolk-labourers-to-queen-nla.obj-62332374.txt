EXTRAORDINARY EXODUS
anfolli inbmiriuifi to d^mland.
Reprinted from ? DAYLIGHT ? (Norwich), January 26th, 1889,
The breaking waves dashed high
On a stern and rockbound coast;
And the woods, against a stormy sky,
Their giant branches tossed.
And the heavy night hung dark
The hills and waters o?er.
When a band of exiles moored their bark,
On the wild New England shore.
Amidst the storm they sang,
And the stars heard and the sea,
And the sounding aisles of the dim wood rang
To the anthem of the free.
The ocean eagle soared
From his nest, by the white waves? foam,
And the rocking pines of the forest roared :
This was their welcome home.
In this soul stirring music is the landing of
the Pilgrim Fathers in America, in 1620,
commemorated by one of Albion?s most
talented daughters. Rather than bow the
knee to the tyrannical Balfours and Salis-
buries, and State supported parsons of the
period, on the 5 h August, 1620, a little
band of sturdy, true-bred Englishmen,
genuine ? island mastiffs,? with their wives
and families, numbering in all about 125
souls, sailed in a crazy craft, yclept the
Mayflower, for the then recently discovered
New World. Inexpressible were the hard-
ships these new planters underwent the first
winter. A sad mortality raged among them,
by the severity of the weather and their want
of necessaries. The country was full of
woods and thickets ; their poor cottages
could not keep them warm ; they had no
physician or wholesome food ; so that within
two or three months half their company was
dead, and of them who remained alive?about
fifty?not above six or seven at a time
were capable of helping the rest.
? They came to the land where fifty centuries
had held their reign with no pen to write
the history. Silence which no occupation
of civilised life had broken was in all its
borders and had been from the creation.
The lofty oak had grown through its linger-
age and decayed and perished without name
or record. The storm had risen and roared
in the wilderness and none had caught its
sublime inspiration. The fountains had
flowed on, the mighty rivet had poured its
useless waters, the cataract had lifted up its
thunderings?-to the march of time, ?and no
eye had seen it, but that of the wild tenants
of the desert. A band of fugitives came to
this land of barbarism with no patronage,
but the prayers of the friends they had left
behind them, with no wealth, but habits of
industry, with no power, but what lay in
firm sinews and courageous hearts, and with
these they turned back the course of ages.
Pilgrims from the Old World they become
inheritors of the New. They opened the
broad pathways of knowledge, the forest
melted away before them like a dark vapour
of the morning ; the voice of comfort, the
din of business went back into its murmur-
ing attitudes, the wilderness and s ditary
places were glad for them, the desert
rejoiced and blossomed as the rose.? From
tbe loins of these sturdy Sons of Liberty
has sprung that mighty Triumphant
Democracy which is alike the envy and
admiration of the world. But history is
repeating itself
j ? The pilgrim spirit has not fled,
It walks in noon?s broad light.
And it watches the bed of the glorious dead,
With the holy stars by night.?
There is a rustling among the dry bones rcf
moribund English Liberty. The night of
Tory squirearchy and ecclesiastical village
tyranny is far spent, the day is at hand for
hundreds of Norfolk labourers. The labour-
manhood and womanhood, the pith and
marrow of Norfolk agricultural life, are en
masse bidding old England's shores adieu for
another land and other skies. With the pilgrim
fathers of yore they are joining in the anthem
of the free.
? For we would rather never be
Than dwell where mind cannot be free.
But bows beneath a despot?s rod,
Even where it seeks to worship God ;
Blasts of heaven onward sweep.
Bear us o?er the troubled deep.
From the deadly Upas tree of Balfourism
and Renegade Liberalism the labouring
classes of Norfolk are hastening to that
happy land far, far away,
? Where a man is a man, if he?s willing to toil,
And the humblest may gather the fruits of
the soil.?
Ere bowed to the earth with heavy un-
requited toil and age, ? landless and joyless ?
they are consigned by the bowelless exploiters
of the fruits of their labour, the squire, th e
parson, and the lick-spitlling Tory farmer,
to the modern Bastille?the Workhouse?
there to fade out of existence on worse than
pris m fare, the sturdy sons of the soil have
determined to
? Leave behind their native shore,
Homes and all they loved before.
The deep may dash, the winds may blow,
The storm spread oat its wings of woe.
Till sailor?s eyes can see a shroud,
Hang in the folds of every cloud ;
Still, as long as life shall last,
Prom that shore they?ll speed them fast.
With mingled regret and pleasure we
learn that Mr. George Randall, the ener-
getic Queensland Government Agent and
Lecurer for England, and Mr. W. S.
Castleton of Hethersett, the local agent,
have during the past week met with
phenomenal success in securing emigrants
for Queensland from Norfolk villages.
Wherever they visited they were met by
throngs of well-dressed, s?alwart, agricultural
labourers, magnificent specimens of humanity,
the pick of the county for health and
strength, wearing the green leaf in their
head gear, the badge of the willing emigrant.
Mr, Randall, who is an experienced emigra-
tion agent, says he never met with better
specimens of English manhood in all his
previous touts in England. Never has he
had to reject so few for physical imperfec-
tions, and never has he found more bond fide,
earnest, determined applicants (or the
privilege of assisted passages to that practical
El Dorado for willing agricultural labourers
?neath the brilliant rays of the Southern
Cross, At Watton on Monday se?nnight
intending emigrants crowded in amain from
the surrounding country, the paradise of the
partridge and the hare, the type of men
reminding Mr. Randall of his visits to
Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The services
of a policeman were ?requisitioned? for
keeping back the crowd. The usual
lecture was delivered, and enquiries
made, after which from 9 till n
the agents were engaged hard at
work in giving out emigration forms.
Swaffham and Castleacre alsi mustered cor-
tingents of would-be pilgrims sporting the
pilgrims badge of a green leaf in their hats.
At Fakenham the agents were as busy as
busy could be, the high physical quality of
the intending emigrants being still main-
tained. Walsingham and neighbourhood
also contributed a goodly number of ? green
leaves,? whilst at Melton Constable the
?green leaves ? seemed as thick as those in
historic Vallambrosa. The station and
locality were crowded, and a large room
having been secured batch after batch were
disposed of and furnished with the necessary
forms and particulars. In one instance the
crowd were addressed on the advantages of
emigration by an old Australian who had
settled in the country 30 years ago, and
having secured an independence was now
enjoying himself on a long holiday visit to
the county of his nativity. The enthusiasm
of the labourers ? all along the line ? at the
hope of escaping from their ? landless and
joyless,? prospect in the land which their
toil compelled to bring forth a thousand fold,
was moat marked, pointing to the deep
rootedness of the burning national malady.
At North Walshara the physical quality of
the emigration candidates was not suslained
and more rejections were made here than in
all the other places on the route put together.
Forty-five forms, representing 60 suitable
persons were however issued. The confi-
dence of |the people in Mr. Randall an I
those he represented seemed unbounded,
which that gentleman ascribes to the
numerous private letters written to friends
in Norfolk by labourers who have emigrated
to Queensland and found there the comfort
and independence denied them at home. The
terms of the assisted passage are also very
tempting, the total expense to single young
women and to single farm labjurers who
secure free passages is �1 for a ship?s kit,
and their train fare to London from whence
they sail. In London they are lodged and
boarded in a home provided for the purpose
and they are similarly provided for at their des
tination. The wages of a single man at farm
work in Queensland is, Mr. Randall says,
�4O pet annum with board and lodging at
the expense of his employer. A married
couple, if the wife cared to) make herself
useful, can earn from i 50 to in a year
in addition to food and house accommoda-
tion. It is said to be a common thing for
labourers to become farmers for themselves
as 160 acres of land can be obtained at the
nominal price of 2s, fid. per acre, the pay-
ment for which might extend over five years.
Since Mr. Randall?s first emigration tour
among as, some eighteen months ago, he has
otwarded 400 emigrants from Norfolk alone
to Queensland, not including the numerous
applications during the past week. Of 700
meetings held all over the country Mr.
Randell considers his recent experiences in
Norfolk the most successful. It may be
asked whether it is not paradoxical for us,
the avowed friends of the people, to experi-
ence regret at any prospect of the improve-
ment of their social condition ? Paradoxical
or not, we do, however, experience such
regret for we are opposed to emigration on
principle. We fail to discover by what
right the tiller of the soil, the producer of
wealth, the hum in busy bee, should be
divorced from the land of his birth, while
the drones of society, who toil not, neither
do they spin, are allowed to 101 l at home in
luxury on the fruits of the labouring man?s
industry. We could rejoice and be exceed-
ing glad were the Royal and German
paupers, the aristocratic pensioners and
blood-sucking sinecurists, the parsons, the
squires, the ? sweaters,? and other ?wasters?
of society who, like locusts, devour the sub-
stance of the British working men,
compelled to don the intending emigrants?
?green leaf? and be emigrated free to some
Terra Incognita. Here would be an
emigration scheme we could support with
heart and soul. But with Goldsmith we
believe?
? 111 fares the land, to hast?ning ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates and men decay
Princes and lords may flourish or may fade,
A breath can make them? as a breath has made,
But a bold peasanty their country?s pride,
When once destroyed can never be supplied.?
We said that oar regret at Mr. Randall's
success was mingled with pleasure. We are
pleased to find that generations of village
tyrants have not been able to wholly extin-
guish the divine Flame of Libeity in old
Norfolk. That there are yet hundreds of
staunch working men, who, rather than bow
the knee to Tory despotism will voluntarily
expatriate themselves, and imbued with the
spirit of the Pilgrim Fathers, go forth to
conquer nature on a foreign strand, and sow
the bursting seeds of yet another Triumphant
Democracy. These glorious Sons of Free-
dom have our heartiest wishes for their
success. Doubtless they will meet with
grave difficulties in their toilsome struggle
up the Hill of Prosperity, but not more than
good English muscle and courage have, and
will again, and yet again, overcome. Their
pilgrimage to their new heme beyond the
seas will, however, be under far different
auspices to those of the early emigration
pioneers. They will not be huddled into a
floating Black-hole and semi-starved for
months on the pitiless surging wave. The
finest and best-found vessels in the world
will convey them to their destination. In
consequence of the large number of intending
emigrants, they will in all probability be
divided into two parties. The first of these
patties will on the sth February, on board
the good ship ? Dacia ? pour to the elements
their last ?good night ? and, in sentiment if
not in words, join with By ron in singing :?.
?Adieu, adieu! our native shore
Fades o?er the waters blue;
The night winds sigh, the breakers roar.
And shrieks the wild sea mew.
Yon sun that sets upon the sea,
We follow in his flight;
Farewell awhile, to him and thea
Oar Native Land?Good Night.?
