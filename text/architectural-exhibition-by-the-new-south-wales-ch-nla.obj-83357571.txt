FOREWORD
Since the dawn of civilisation, Man has been interested in Building.
At first simply as a matter of shelter from the elements and his enemies,
both human and otherwise. Gradually, with the increase of his mental
powers, his building needs expanded—as well as shelter for himself he
needed a shelter for the gods he worshipped or placated —until in modern
times his building requirements became as complex as his civilisation;
structures to house not only himself and his altars but his various indus-
tries, businesses and, not least, his amusements. And the end is not yet.
But the mere piling of brick on brick, no matter to what colossal
extent, in itself is not Architecture. Until a building has been proportioned
and adorned in keeping with its use, it remains but “building”; and the
introduction of this proportion and adornment is the function of the Archi-
tect —whose training, by the way, should lead to a knowledge of not
how far adornment can be carried, but where it should stop.
In a foreword intended for the Public, it is perhaps a little out of
place to criticise —but the writer craves the indulgence of his brother
Architects in suggesting that we are rather prone to copying new ideas
from abroad without first examining either their intrinsic worth or the
possibility of their local application; we are apt to forget that all that is
“modern” is not necessarily good—and that strangeness of form allied
to starkness or crudity of treatment although perhaps startling at the
moment, has no quality of endurance.
Eight years have passed since the last Architectural Exhibition
was held in Sydney and the Public is invited to view some, at any rate,
of the work of that period. What success the Exhibition of 1938 may
achieve will be due in no small measure to the many months of arduous
and self-denying work of the Committee responsible for it.
The N.S.W. Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Archi-
tects is confident that those who visit the Exhibition will find much to
excite their interest and, it is hoped, their admiration.

150 YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN
ARCHITECTURE
THE STORY OF PROGRESS
ADRIAN ASHTON, a.r.i.b.a., a.r.a.i.a., a.a.s.t.c
The 150 th Anniversary Celebrations have served to implant in
the minds of even the most thoughtless of us that Australia, in terms of
years, is a very young nation —a fact that is often overlooked. The
natural sequence to such a thought is to analyse what has been achieved
in this period.
Even to those whose imaginative powers are not excessive, it should
be stimulating to wander down to Macquarie Place and there, amidst such
historic reminders as the ’’Sirius’’ anchor and the Macquarie Obelisk, to
visualise the landing of Captain Phillip in Sydney Cove in 1788 literally
the birth of the Australian nation and the history of architecture and
building in this country.
The contrast of the great City of Sydney of 1938, with its million
and a quarter inhabitants, to these humble beginnings, that took place but
two generations ago, should cause a swell of pride in even the most matter'
of'fact heart.
Looking back over those 150 years with the eye of an architect,
perhaps two figures have left their mark more indelibly inscribed upon the
face of the country than any others —inscribed, as every architect would
have it, by their buildings.
These two names are Francis Morland Greenway and Edmund T.
Blacket.
FRANCIS GREENWAY
Sydney was indeed fortunate that two such outstanding figures as
Lachlan Macquarie and Francis Greenway coincided in their march across
this transient stage. Greenway, in his work, brought taste and culture to
a new and crude land at a most appropriate time, and the simple dignity
and charm of his buildings have remained as an inspiration to architects
ever since.
With unskilled and unwilling workmen, inadequate tools, very
limited materials, —to say nothing of continued interference, —by his skill,
courage, and perseverance, he gave his adopted land such buildings as
St. James’ Church; St. Mathew’s, Windsor; St. Luke’s, Liverpool, and
Liverpool Hospital, to name but a few outstanding examples.


MO YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN ARCHITECTURE
These charming old buildings to-day render visits to such towns
as Windsor, Richmond, and Liverpool almost as a wander into history.
It is interesting to record that Greenway was appointed Civil Archi-
tect to the Government of N.S.W. by Macquarie in 1816 at the princely
salary of 3/- a day. We indeed have to thank Macquarie for his judgment
and courage in making this appointment.
It should never be forgotten that in modern times we also owe a
great debt of gratitude to Hardy Wilson for recording the beauties of the
buildings of this period—some extant, others, alas, long since swept away
—for all time, for the incomparable collection of drawings by this fine artist
and architect, is one of the treasured possessions of the Commonwealth
Government and indeed one of the artistic legacies of the Nation.
EDMUND BLACKET
If Greenway stands for the symmetrical dignity of the Georgian,
Edmund Blacket is typified by the grace and aspiring beauty of the Gothic,
as witness the Great Hall at the University of Sydney which, in its design,
proportions and craftsmanship, is comparable with examples of this style
in the older countries of its origin. To have been able to transplant this
style from the antipodean countries of its birth to a new land was a great
tribute to the designing skill and technical ability of this great architect
who, in addition to the Great Hall, which may be said to have been the
crowning jewel of his achievement, has left legacies of beauty in the form
of beautiful churches throughout New South Wales; from the massive
dignity of St. Andrew’s Cathedral to the rural simplicity of the Mort
Memorial Church at Bodalla; from the light grace of St. Mark’s, Darling
Point, to the early English serenity of St. Thomas’, North Sydney.
To review the history of Australian architectural development in
detail as from Philip’s tent —the first “building” to be erected in the coun-
try —to the latest office block that rears its proud head above the city
streets, is not the intention of this article, for although such a record
would be fascinating, it is beyond the present scope.
Mention should be made, however, in passing, to the work of James
Barnett, Government Architect in the middle of last century, who (in
addition to a great deal of work, including the G.P.0., Sydney) was res-
ponsible for the design and erection of a fine series of important Govern-
ment buildings which may be typified by the Court House at Orange and


150 YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN ARCHITECTURE
other important country centres. These buildings, although perhaps, old'
fashioned to present'day eyes, possess scale and dignity that were partial'
larly suited to their purpose.
AUSTRALIA REBUILDS
It is hardly an exaggeration to state that the main capital cities
of Australia have almost rebuilt themselves since the War, and, as a result
of this, how changed is the city of 1938 to that of even 1900, when the
Commonwealth of Australia was formed! To'day, elaborate ornament —
so popular and considered so essential to cover “unrefined” bareness at
the end of the last century —is almost universally eschewed and the build'
ings of the twentieth century rely chiefly upon their fenestration, massing,
silhouette, and the juxtaposition of materials for their appeal.
Some, perhaps, feel that the line of thought that would eliminate
all but pure form, can be carried to extremes, but the graph of Progress,
if plotted, will always have a wavedike profile, for the pendulum of
human needs and their national reflection is never static.
It has humorously been suggested that there is a relation between
the dress and hirsute adornments of the people with the architecture of
the period. Thus in Victorian days with crinolines and side'whiskers, the
buildings were very ornate, while tO'day, with much scantier attire and the
clean'shaven face, the architecture of the day is similarly bereft of unneces'
sary encumbrances.
The causes, however, are more fundamental, being indissolubly
linked with the progress —or otherwise, depending on our point of view—
of civilisation, for architecture is ever the mirror of the age.
The question as to whether Australia has as yet evolved a national
style of architecture is a difficult one, and while it is admitted that our
buildings have many national characteristics, probably at this juncture the
reply would have to be in the negative. The writer of a similar article
for the second centenary may be able to give a more definite reply. Such
characteristics are perhaps usually more discernible in the sphere of the
domestic architecture of a country, for the home is nearer to the character
of the people than the public, commercial and industrial buildings, but
there is, perhaps, still a tendency for people to rather seek a Spanish or
English type home than to ask their architect to design an Australian
residence. Evolution was ever a slow process.


MO YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN ARCHITECTURE
In commercial and industrial fields, however, what has been des'
cribed as Contemporary Architecture is definitely having an important
and stimulating influence.
No survey of Australian architectural progress would be complete
without a reference to the Commonwealth Capital City of Canberra which,
as a town planning experiment, is one of a few to be carried out in the
world during recent years. There have been, and still are, many pros and
cons in regard to Canberra, but as it is a city in embryo, it is still premature
to be dogmatic. As an experiment it is full of interest and it is as such
that reference is made.
THE FUTURE
The future of architecture in Australia is undoubtedly bright. The
country is prosperous and the nation virile and more progress must result.
What has been accomplished in the past 150 year period will be as nothing
compared with that which will be achieved in the next 100, or perhaps
even 50 years.
The responsibility of those who design and erect the buildings and
cities of the future is no small one and the fact that now the law of the
land is such that the term “Architect” can be used by none but those who
have received a long and thorough professional training at either of the
recognised Schools of Architecture at Sydney University or Sydney Tech'
nical College, places this responsibility in competent and willing hands.
Thus we can look forward with confidence and anticipation to the
future architectural progress of Australia.


"THE WORK OF AN ARCHITECT”
It is frequently assumed that an Architect is a person who prepares
plans and specifications, but it is not generally recognised that these are
merely the outward and visible signs of the Architect’s work.
An Architect, just as a doctor or lawyer, has nothing to sell except
disinterested personal service, and receives no payment other than the fees
paid by his clients. His knowledge is derived from many years of study
and experience in the designing of buildings and the supervision of their
construction.
Building is a complex process, involving a number of different trades
and interests, the co-ordination of which is the business of the architect.
Such co-ordination cannot be achieved by mere plans and specifications,
but requires the personal handling of an expert. Moreover, the average
building owner is, through lack of expert knowledge, at a disadvantage in
approaching his project, since he is not able to tell the builder in suffic-
iently definite terms exactly what service is required of him.
When he employs an architect, firstly the building owner is aided
in formulating his ideas by one who is trained to solve the economic,
structural and aesthetic problems which every building enterprise presents.
Secondly, he is enabled to state his requirements by means of drawings
and specifications; from which it follows that, thirdly, he has the advant-
age of being able to call tenders from a number of builders in competition
for the carrying out of the work. Fourthly, after the signing of the
contract, he is represented by an expert, whose duty it is to see that the
builder carries out the work in a proper manner, and that he gives the
owner no less and, for the matter of that, no more (since the architect must
be fair to both contracting parties) than he has contracted to do, whatever
the nature of the problem.
The architect is in the best possible position to collect and co-
ordinate the particular information which is necessary in planning the
building to conform to the functions for which it is intended. This is
particularly important in the case of industrial buildings.
It will be readily agreed, then, that if the architect carries out
these services faithfully his worth to the owner in ensuring that he obtains
value for his expenditure is considerably greater than is represented by
the amount of his fee.
It cannot be too strongly emphasised that if the architect is to
give his best service his advice should be sought as early as possible, prefer-


"THE WORK OF AN ARCHITECT”
ably before the site for the building is chosen. This may frequently lead
to a considerable saving of trouble and money.
The owner should then, at an early stage, carefully select an archb
tect in whom he can place his confidence, and, having made his choice,
should give him his entire confidence, particularly in regard to the amount
which he is prepared to spend.
SKETCH PLANS AND ESTIMATES
Taking the services of an architect in order, his first duty is to
assist his client in choosing a site, and in any other preliminaries (such
as negotiations with adjoining owners) in which his experience will be
of great value. The next is to help him to formulate his ideas in such a
way that they can be placed down on paper, and can form the basis for
a preliminary estimate of cost. Here the architect’s training and his know'
ledge of materials, construction and planning will enable him to arrive at
a correct economic solution to the problem or problems which are set
before him, while his sense of fitness and design should ensure that such
a solution will not result in unsightly appearances, but will allow beauty
to combine with utility and minimum cost.
This first stage is generally referred to as “Sketch Plans and Estim'
ates,” and covers the whole of the work involved in arriving at a satis'
factory and complete solution of the problem in hand, which may entail a
whole series of sketch plans; and the fees chargeable for such services may
be of the total fee. It should, however, be clearly under'
stood that the limit of cost may be stipulated by the client, and, moreover,
that the charge made is not bound to represent the full quarter fee, but
may by agreement be commensurate with the actual value of the services
rendered. It is therefore admissible for an architect who is merely asked
to give a preliminary idea to agree to the making of a lesser charge for his
services.
It should be understood that any estimate, however carefully pre'
pared, which is based upon sketch plans can be only approximate; this
will be readily understood when it is considered that even after the most
detailed working drawings and specifications have been prepared, the ten'
ders of the various builders may vary by a considerable percentage.
The architect’s knowledge will protect his client against the pos'
sibility of difficulties arising in respect of existing building laws and regula'
tions.


"THE WORK OF AN ARCHITECT”
WORKING DRAWINGS AND SPECIFICATIONS
When the preliminary sketches and estimates have been duly ap-
proved by the client, the next stage is the preparation of working drawings
and specifications. These are the documents upon which tenders are called
and the contract signed, and represent the architect’s method of conveying
to the builder the requirements of the client. The working drawings are
a careful setting out of the work to be done, from which builders are
enabled to submit competitive prices.
The specifications describe in detail the materials to be used, and
the manner in which the work is to be carried out. In the preparation of
these documents the architect’s knowledge of materials is reinforced by
careful and detailed research, ensuring the selection of what is best suited
for the job. It is at this stage that both the architect and the client
should give the closest attention to ensure that no essential requirement is
omitted, for only by so doing can they avoid the necessity for extras or
alterations being ordered after the contract is signed, when they may cause
embarrassment to all concerned.
The fees payable up to this stage are one-half of the total fee.
This, of course, includes the services in connection with sketch plans.
QUANTITIES
Where a building is large or of a complicated nature, in order that
there may be no misunderstanding on the part of the tenderers, it is fre-
quently advisable to have quantities prepared. These permit of close ten-
dering on a uniform basis, which is even more exact than that supplied
by the drawings and specifications prepared by the architect, and though
a small percentage is included in the builder’s tender to cover the quantity
surveyor’s fee, it is probable that the fee is saved by the exactness of the
tendering.
SELECTION OF TENDERERS
When inviting tenders, the advice of the architect should ac-
cepted, as in the course of his practice he obtains valuable information as
to the ability, integrity, financial soundness, and organisation of builders
whom he can confidently invite to tender and from whom the building
owners will obtain sound work at reasonable cost.


“THE WORK OF AN ARCHITECT”
REVISION OF TENDER
When the tenders are received by the architect, should the amounts
not prove satisfactory to the client, it may be necessary to make certain
adjustments, and this may be done between the architect and owner in
consultation, so that the price may be adjusted and the necessary altera'
tions to plans/or specifications made before the signing of the contract.
SUPERVISION
The remaining half of the architect’s work consists of the super'
vision of the actual building operations, and entails the preparation of large
scale and full size detail drawings. This stage is of considerable import'
ance, since the mere existence of contract plans and specifications is not
sufficient to ensure that the work will be carried out in accordance with
them.
Moreover, in almost every job contingencies occur which require
expert handling if they are not to entail unnecessary additional costs, or
disfigurement of some part of the design. It frequently happens, also, that
while the work is in progress the client remembers some requirement of
which he has omitted to tell the architect, or desires some variation to the
contract, and it is then the duty of the architect to arrange that the
additional cost or saving is settled on the fairest possible basis.
PROVISIONAL ITEMS
There are certain allowances in the specification for various items
of labour and/or material which is desirable to keep under the direct con'
trol of the architect.
Such allowances are called Provisional Items, and may be for special
work, such as tiling or joinery, or for such items as baths, basins, locks,
etc. This leaves the architect free to make arrangements for special work,
or to choose items in collaboration with the client, and where a lesser
amount is spent than the sum allowed, the contract sum is reduced by this
amount, and vice versa.
PAYMENTS
During the course of the work the architect issues certificates of
amounts due to be paid to the builder, based on percentage of the value of
work done, thus constituting a safeguard against over payment, and when
the work is completed he makes a final check of all the builders’ accounts
before issuing the final certificate.


‘THE WORK OF AN ARCHITECT”
OTHER SERVICES
Apart from the actual building of new works, there are many mat"
ters in connection with existing buildings where an architect can be of use
to the building owner, whether in merely giving advice or in obtaining
tenders for renovations or additions, where ingenuity is required in arriving
at the economic and aesthetic solution. Here the employment of an archb
tect will safeguard the owner against altering his existing building in such
a way as to detract from its appearance and value.
In such cases the architect is almost invariably able to save the
client a great deal more than his fees. It is not sufficiently appreciated
that the architect should be engaged as a consultant in very much the same
way as a physician or a solicitor, and it will be found that his fees for such
services are by no means large, and in many cases advice is given gratis.
ARTISTRY IN ARCHITECTURE
Architecture is the mother of all arts. Although a very great part
of his work is intensely practical, the true architect is by temperament
and training an artist as well as a business man; indeed, who may say that
art can be separated from practical considerations? Our cities in Australia
to-day are far less beautiful than they might have been had the majority
of their buildings been designed by men who were pronerly trained and
competent to design.

APPRECIATION
The President and Council of the New South Wales
Chapter of The Royal Australian Institute of Architects
take this opportunity of thanking those who have rendered
very practical assistance to the Chapter by preparing
sketches from which the blocks used in presenting the
advertisements in this Brochure were made and donating
them to the Chapter.
Our thanks are also due to those Firms who have sup"
ported us by advertising in our Brochure. Such support
is deserving of reciprocity by the Members of our profes-
sion.
We are very grateful to Farmer and Company for placing
the Blaxland Galleries at our disposal, also for the very mate"
rial assistance afforded us by placing at our service members
of their expert staff and to that Staff for their willing co-
operation.
We also thank Messrs. Andersons, of Pitt Street, who have
loaned us the shrubs and decorative plants which adorn the
Exhibition.
