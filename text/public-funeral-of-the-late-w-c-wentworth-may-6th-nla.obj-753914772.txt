Australian Churchman Office.




meditating devoutly upon the world to come, and
praying to be fitted for the same, they may be raised
from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness, and
may have their part in the glorious resurrection to
eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
The Psalm will then be sung as follows :
O Lord my heart and will incline
To bear in mind always,
How frail it is—this flesh of mine,
And I how few of days.
My term of years has been by Thee
Contracted to a span ;
Yea, and how high so e’er he be,
How vain a thing is man !
Disdain not then, the flowing tear,
But hear my mounful cry ;
My fathers were but strangers here,
And as they were, am I.
O spare me that brief space, which may
My wasted strength restore,
Ere from the world I pass away,
And thence be seen no more.
The Address.
The Benediction.
Joseph Cook and Co., Printers, 370, George-strcet, Sydney.
