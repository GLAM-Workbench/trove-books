he goes to the wall. The metayer tenure is in use in Tuscany,
it is also in use in Chieti and Tiramo. But the metayer tenure
of Tuscany is one thing and the metayer tenure of Southern
Italy is another. In the one case the husbandman is almost
the equal of his landlord, in the other he is his landlord?s slave.
The ? duty pig ? and 4 duty fowls ? of Ireland repeat themselves
in Italy, where the landlord claims eggs, fowls, turkeys, 4 agnelli
? pasquali,? pork, and so on, in addition to the other and more
regular incidents of tenure. If the tenant is in arrear of,a
money payment, interest is charged, sometimes up to twelve
per cent.; if in arrear of payments in kind, a sixth is added to
the demand at the end of the year.
Such are some of the ways in which men?s lives are made
wearisome and miserable in Southern Italy, and it is this
misery and weariness which drives them into brigandage. Cure
the disease and the system will disappear; but the cure is not
simple. It will take years, and probably even then the misery
of the people will not admit of much alleviation Avithout the
interference of the State. Whether the agrarian reforms of
Prussia or those of Ireland are to be followed, is a question.
Signor Yillari inclines to tread in the steps of Mr. Gladstone?s
government, for he thinks that to attempt to give over to the
husbandman a part of the soil as was the case in Prussia,
would simply be to hand over the whole country to the great
proprietors, who, having bought up the share of the husband-
man, would hold him more in slavery than ever.
The subject of which we have been treating is one of such
extent that it is impossible to do more in a few pages than hint
at many matters which deserve much fuller exposition. And,
as it is, we may have wearied our readers with columns of
figures and with statistics which will be condemned as un-
interesting. Still it should not be forgotten that in Italy is now
being tried a great and a most interesting question?the ques-
tion whether it is possible to create a new nation. For a new
nation it is which is being created, and that out of hetero-
geneous and in many respects unpromising materials. Never-
theless, given but time and peace, we have the strongest belief
that this new nation will not only continue to exist, but grow
and flourish; and that to the manual skill, the inborn taste,
the natural elegance, the acute intelligence of the Italian as he
has been known in times when he was but the musician or the
painter, or the dancer, or the cook of Europe, may be added
those sterner and stronger virtues, without which a national
character remains contemptible and base, and national life
itself a chimera and a dream.


Art. VII. ? Wanderings in the Interior of New Guinea. By
Captain J. A. Lawson. London : 1875.
TVThen that pious but somewhat credulous traveller, the
?? first of our English globe-trotters. Sir John Maunde-
ville, gave his wonderful tale to the world, he was careful in
his preface to inform any doubting reader that he had sub-
mitted his book to the censorship of the Pope, by whom it had
all been � proved for true.? Whether this approbation ex cathedra,
Petri was enough even in that simple age to stifle the mur-
murs of those doubting Thomases who shook their heads
when they came, besides many others, on such passages as
these: ? The folk in that isle are of a right cursed kind, for they
e have no heads and they grunt like pigs; ? and � of Paradise I
? cannot speak for I was not there, but I have seen the wail
? thereof,? may well be a question; but we cannot help think-
ing that it would be a great comfort to geographers of this
sceptical generation, if some of the marvellous books of modern
travel, and notably this volume of Captain Lawson, could be
submitted to some such supreme authority as that exercised by
the Pope in the fourteenth century, for then all our suspicions
would vanish, and we should read on in faith, coming to the
conclusion that as a power against which it were impiety to
cavil had proved this book also to be true, therefore it must be
true, down to its minutest details. But, alas! for Captain
Lawson as well as for ourselves, we have no such simple beliefs
in this uncomfortable nineteenth century. We must prove
things and books to be true for ourselves, step by step. We
are as it were popes every one of us, and before the tribunal ot
our private judgment every fact and statement must be verified
before Ave can admit that anyone who claims to be a discoverer
in any branch of science is a discoverer indeed. It is sad to
think that faith has fallen so low that it must have proof to
support it, but so it is. As Luther said, we can do naught
else; and this process we now propose to apply to Captain
LaAVSon?s book, of which we will only premise, that if our
readers can only be as much instructed as they are sure to be
amused by its perusal, they will be amply rewarded.
Like all great travellers, Captain Lawson plunges almost at
a step into the jungle of New Guinea. He found himself in
November 1871 at Sydney, New South Wales, and there he
formed the resolution of exploring the interior of New Guinea
He admits that there were innumerable difficulties in his way.
Transport was out of the question. Rifle in hand and knap-


sack at back, he had to make his way through an immense
island, inhabited by a 4 fierce, treacherous, and murderous race.?
But these difficulties were light when matched against the re-
solution of the explorer, and the friendly help of a merchant
captain who offered to land the Captain at a village where he
was known to the natives. It is very bold, no doubt, to re-
solve to travel through New Guinea rifle in hand and knap-
sack on back; but see how soon this resolution fails. After
securing the services of the friendly captain, our traveller?s
next care was to provide suitable servants to accompany him
as bearers of baggage. First there was a Lascar named
Tooloo, an intelligent and useful fellow, ?he was to be my
f personal attendant; ? besides, three Australian aborigines,
Tom, Joe, and Billy, had been engaged as porters; but when
the time for starting came, Tom, who had probably seen the
amount of baggage which he would be required to carry in
tropical New Guinea, repented him of his bargain and made off
?up the country ?to be out of the way. So Tom is out of the
story, and the only names of the exploring party which the
reader is required to remember are, Lawson, Tooloo, Joe, and
Billy. The native names we shall come to by-and-by. It was
not till the end of May 1872 that Dobbs?that was the name
of the merchant captain?was ready for sea. On the 24th they
set sail, and on the 21st of June, the ? Nautilus,? the winds
being light, made the coast of New Guinea. On the 22nd
Captain Lawson landed at a native village called Ploutree, in
Torres Straits. And here let us pause to say, that what may
be called the chartological powers of Captain Lawson do not
at all equal his capacity for penetrating through the heart of
New Guinea. The map which accompanies this volume rather
resembles a schoolboy?s first attempt to draw a map of Pa-
lestine, a work of art which painfully reminds one of two duck-
ponds joined by a gutter; it is a mere slice of the island on
which is traced the traveller?s line of march, and it is quite
devoid of those base innovations of modern science called
degrees and parallels of latitude and longitude. But what of
this ? Who can pine for exact measurements when on this
flat slice are marked some of the most remarkable discoveries
ever made in geographical or zoological science. It is some-
thing to have discovered a mountain beyond compare the
loftiest in the world; and a river with a waterfall which must
make Niagara quake for its laurels. But let us not anticipate.
All in good time. Let us return to Houtree, where our tra-
veller has just set foot on shore with his three followers, and is
being introduced to the Papuans, old friends of Captain Dobbs.


We linger yet awhile to dispose of Dobbs who, according to
Captain Lawson, in spite of his previous good character, seems
to have behaved on this occasion in a very peculiar fashion, so
peculiar that it is fortunate for him that he had just then de-
termined to retire from the trade in which he had acquired an
independence. Nor is this to be wondered at. After intro-
ducing the new comer. Captain Dobbs remained a fortnight
loading the ? Nautilus ? with spices, drugs, gums, bark, birds
of paradise, cocoa-nuts, and monkey-skins ; in return for which
he was to have exchanged calicoes, knives, guns, iron-work,
gunpowder, and spirits; but would it be believed, one fine
night this peculiar and most thoughtless captain sailed off
without transferring to the natives the articles for which they
had bartered their goods. If he was addicted to these practices
it is no wonder that he had amassed an independence. As for
the present instance. Captain Lawson says, the action of the
e man Dobbs was of the very meanest class, which, besides doing
f the poor people a serious injury, might have led them to
c wreak their vengeance on me.? This very Christian conduct
on the part of the inhabitants of Houtree, we own, astonishes
us; perhaps they are so accustomed to be treated in this
way by captains of the Dobbs class that they think as little of
it as eels are proverbially said to care for skinning; perhaps
the old chief who ruled over the two hundred and sixty-three?
observe our author?s particularity?inhabitants of Houtree
was so overjoyed by the gift of an old double-barrelled fowling-
piece and a few pounds of powder and shot, on receiving which
f he fairly danced,? that he snapped his fingers at the defalca-
tions of Dobbs, and coercing his subjects took Captain Lawson
under his gracious protection. As all the necessaries for the
march had to be carried, and in this respect travelling in New
Guinea is very like exploring the heart of Africa, Captain
Lawson recruited his party by two Papuans, who had acquired
some knowledge of English in the course of a seafaring life.
The name of the one was Aboo, of most repulsive physiog-
nomy ? intensified by the cicatrice of a fearful cut across the
4 face.? He was only four feet three in height, but of prodigious
strength, much more than a match for that porter advertised
for as f a pious man who could carry a hundred weight; ? for
Captain Lawson has seen this Papuan Hercules 4 lift four or
? five hundred weight without appearing to exert himself in
4 any extraordinary degree.? He was about fifty. Danang,
his companion, was younger and taller, and very muscular, but
rather lazy ; whereas Aboo was indefatigably active and of a


most kindly nature. In him, in fact, our adventurer found a
real treasure.
Captain Lawson was now ready to start for the interior,
but before he plunges into the jungle, he is good enough
to tell us that Houtree lies in long. 143� 17' 8" E. and lat.
9� 8' 18" S., a piece of information for which we are most
thankful, and all the more so as it is almost the only precise
information as to his whereabouts to be found in any part
of his book. His party now numbered six souls, and they
took with them a small quantity of tea and coffee, some
pickles and preserves, both of which we should have thought
needless; but no doubt the Captain is given to pickles, and
besides he took with him a corrective in the next item, medi-
cines. Added to this were half a dozen bottles of brandy,
set of instruments for observations, twenty-four pounds of
ship biscuit, a good supply of ammunition, always rather a
bulky article, 4 and a few other articles.? All these were made
into three packages, besides what each man carried in his
haversack, and the six took turns in carrying them. His own
arms consisted of a double-barrelled rifle, not a very light
weapon, a fowling-piece, a six-chambered pistol, and a cutlas.
Thus equipped the Captain must have looked somewhat like
our old friend Robinson Crusoe, except that his pistols had
not six chambers. As for his attendants they had each an old
musket and their knives; and here let us remark that by
several strokes of his pen Captain Lawson converts these old
muskets into rifles further on in his book, and even makes Aboo
bring down swallows on the wing with one of them, a feat, we
venture to say, never before performed by Brown Bess or En-
field rifle; but then it must be remembered that these swallows,
like all the beasts, birds, reptiles, and creeping things in
this book, were twice the size of any ordinary swallows, and so
presented a better mark. AAe think it will be admitted that
these arms and the articles specified, with ? a few more ? in the
margin, were an ample load for three men, especially when
forcing their way through a country which Captain Lawson
says ( had never been scanned by the eyes of an European,?
and presenting, as we shall see, natural obstacles in the shape of
rank vegetation, underwood, rocks, precipices, ravines, rivers,
and immense mountains, such as few travellers have ever en-
countered, and all this under a temperature never less than
100� in the shade, and often ascending to 110 or 114 degrees.
Their plan of proceeding was simple. They were on the south
of the island in Torres Straits, and they were to walk across it


to the north coast, traversing what mountains and rivers might
he in their way. Besides this, the intelligent Aboo informed
his master that in four or five days they would come to a high
mountain range, and for that range they marched. Beyond
this, even to Aboo, the interior of New Guinea was a ?desert
? vast and idle.? Captain Lawson?s march if, as we shall see, it
went out like a lion came in like a lamb. So far from finding the
Papuans of the south coast murderous cut-throats, they treated
him in the gentlest way. After a two days? tramp through
marsh and jungle they reached a village where the natives
knew the chief, who took them into his own house, made his
slaves wash the strangers? feet, spread mats for them, and
feasted them sumptuously on boiled rice, roast monkey, and
yams. After a good night?s rest they stayed there another
day, when they almost all got inebriated on toddy?not that
seducing compound known to Scotch baillies, but the juice of
the cocoa-palm fermented with the bruised leaves of a plant
called Thadda ; but that did not impair their sight, for in the
evening they went out and shot long-tailed monkeys with ball
from the tops of tall trees, bringing down a score in two hours.
After supping again on roast monkey they lay down and slept
and rose up next morning and departed from the friendly Ma-
halla?that was the chief?s name?promising to return and feast
once more with him on baked monkey. On leaving the village
they plunged into a jungle, where the grass was five or six feet
above their heads ; and now the native guides began to talk of
moolahs , a savage beast, which it will be seen is as big or
bigger than a Bengal tiger. But as yet they saw no tigers, only
butterflies and birds of paradise, and that in a forest in which
there were trees three hundred and thirty-seven feet high and
downwards, and eighty-four feet some inches round the trunk.
? This,? says Captain Lawson, * I should say is the tallest tree
( in the world, so tall, in fact, that the Papuans cannot climb
? it. It is called the wallah-tree, and bears nuts which are
? something like chestnuts ; in form and foliage this giant of the
? forest is like the elm.? That night, when waiting ravenously
hungry for their supper, they were greeted by ? a prolonged
f and horrible growl, which Aboo said came from the jaws of a
f moolah, and shortly arose a great chorus of those beasts,
? whose howls,? Captain Lawson tells us, ? are ten times worse
? than the screech of the hyena,? but so far as we can make out
not nearly so terrible, so far as mere sound goes, as the braying
of a jackass. Then came the moaning of some large animal,
intermingled with the crunching of its bones by the fell heast.
Morning rose, and revealed a pool of blood and the remains of


a large deer, which had been the moolah?s prey. In the even-
ing they hastened on, and on the 16th of July, at six in the
evening, began to ascend a range of mountains ? which,? says
Captain Lawson, ? using the privilege of explorers, I named the
f Papuan Ghauts,? from their resemblance to the Western
Ghauts in India.
As these Papuan Ghauts were nothing to Captain Lawson's
further Alpine experiences, presenting, as it were, mere pim-
ples on the earth?s crust of 12,000 or 14,000 feet or so, we pass
rapidly over them, just as a man might, if he were equal to
New Guinea exploration, walk up Mont Blanc and down the
other side in a day. In this region they saw lilies, such as
Solomon, in all his glory and with all his knowledge of plants,
could never have imagined; one like a narcissus, with leaves
six or seven feet in length and one in breadth, and so tough
that the Captain found it impossible to tear them in two;
the bulb was as large as a man?s head, and the height of the
plant nine or ten feet. Out of the down round this lily the
birds of paradise build their nests, when they can get it. Nor
were the other plants behind the lilies in due proportion, for
there were daisies like those which grow in our English
meadows, ?but as large as sunflowers.? ? They were crimson-
? tipped,? pleasantly says Captain Lawson, f but not very modest,
s seeing they lifted their heads to a height of eighteen inches.?
On reading which, it strikes us that a traveller must be modest
indeed who could write thus of daisies, and yet have his fea-
tures not crimson-tipped. But let not the reader suppose that
he can rush off into New Guinea and botanise without risk.
He is already warned as to the moolahs and beasts of prey;
but now come the reptiles and creeping things. One after-
noon, it was on the 23rd of July, Captain Lawson was all but
stung by a scorpion which he had been carrying about un-
awares in his haversack. *lt was of the enormous length of
? ten inches; ? and its bite, as they afterwards found, would
have been instant death. Indeed, though there are no
weekly bills of mortality in New Guinea, which yet awaits its
Farrs and Grahams, Captain Lawson believes that more
deaths occur among the Papuans from scorpion bite than from
any other cause. Then there were beetles, ? the most remark-
c able being a black one five inches and a half long by three
? broad, covered with white triangular marks, and with horns
( two inches long. It is remarkable that only the males have
f horns.? ? This,? Captain Lawson again exclaims, ?I believe
?is the largest beetle in the world.? As for the moths and
butterflies they were innumerable, the biggest being exactly


twelve inches across when its wings were expanded, while its
body was *as thick as my thumb ? ?we should like to know
how thick Captain Lawson?s thumb is? e and six inches in
{ length. The feelers were seven inches in length.? On read-
ing which we exclaim with our American cousins, e Something
? like a butterfly I ? In this most entomological region, where
he only lingered a few days, during part of which he was sur-
veying a great range of mountains, and partly incapacitated
from illness. Captain Lawson contrived to collect a magnificent
collection of beetles and butterflies, comprising a hundred dif-
ferent kinds; but we believe that owing to the perils which
he afterwards underwent no part of the collection has yet
reached Europe.
But these entomological treasures were not gathered with-
out danger. The explorers were in an elevated region ; and,
as is not uncommon, they were overtaken by mist, which wet
their clothes and made them very uncomfortable. Still they
persevered, and climbed to the top of one of the mountains
called, very appropriately. Mount Misty, ascertained by Cap-
tain Lawson, with a precision which would do credit to any
surveyor, to be just 10,672 feet above the sea-level, while
two peaks near it attained the height respectively of 12,580
and 12,945 feet. We do not know whether Captain Lawson
is a member of the Alpine Club, but the ease and rapidity
with which he scales the most precipitous peaks certainly
entitle him to be elected into that hard-footed body by accla-
mation. The 10,672 feet of Mount Misty were but a breather,
a short morning?s work, and by four in the afternoon they
were back at the foot, and this though they were suffering from
agonies of thirst, which in the evening of the same day nearly
caused the destruction of the whole party; but we should add,
that the ascent of this range was much assisted by ( a little
* blue flower, like a forget-me-not, which clung to the hard
f rocks with such tenacity that it required a strong pull to dis-
? engage it. In several places it served to help us up the
4 almost perpendicular face of the cliffs.? One result of this
indefatigable climbing was, that at the same time the whole
party had e walked the skin off their feet,? which were instantly
attacked by insects, which on the 19th, 20th, and 21st of July
laid them all up except Aboo, who was 4 as hard as iron,? and
perhaps for that matter was shod with the same metal. It
was when thus incapacitated that Captain Lawson took the
angles, which enabled him to present his readers with the pre-
cise height of the range; and then he moved the camp slowly
on, descending the range, and arriving on August Ist at another


Papuan village. Here, instead of being eaten or having their
throats cut, they were very hospitably treated by a chief
named Taa, who cultivated a farm of thirty acres with rice,
maize, and cocoa-nut, and who had a herd of short-legged,
hump-backed oxen and cows, which bore ? a great resemblance
<to the Yak.? This Taa, on the whole, was what would be
called a good fellow, only he was not at all kind to his old
father, named Sassofrang, ordering him about in a way very
shocking to Captain Lawson?s feelings ; but perhaps this poor
old creature had outlived his time, and only existed by suffer-
ance. For, as Captain Lawson doubtless well knows, there are
tribes in which the relations of a man who has lived too long in
public opinion hold a caucus and eat him ?instead of venison,
as Sir John Maundeville adds, who first tells the story. On the
whole, then, old Sassofrang was, perhaps, not so badly off, if
he lived on amidst kicks and cuffs, instead of being eaten by
his son Taa in the Papuan village of Burtemmytara. It is
very remarkable that at this distance from the coast Captain
Lawson found old Sassofrang smoking a long Dutch pipe, and
many of the inhabitants speaking Dutch; and this was very
fortunate for our traveller, who could thus communicate with
them, for as yet he had not acquired that of the
Papuan language w T hich enabled him farther on to maintain a
fluent conversation with the natives.
But we must hasten on. On August 2nd the explorers left
the village and passed through a hilly country, in which
nothing particular happened, except that they encountered a
hurricane of wind, which blew the parrots, and probably the
monkeys also, out of the trees, tore the giants of the forest up
by the roots, and blew gravel and stones about so that a great
stone fell on Aboo?s shoulder, and gave him an awkward cut.
This gale was followed by a hail storm, in which many of the
stones were ?as large as a hen?s egg.? We are not told if any
of the party were hit by these hailstones, which must have
inflicted serious wounds. Then, too, they were so bitten by
insects that their eyes were bunged up, and when they woke
they were all blind, and had to bathe their eyes for nearly an
hour before they could see; but when they opened them they
were rewarded, on August 9th, by discovering an immense
inland lake, which the Australians shouted out was ? the sea,?
but which Captain Lawson, like a loyal subject, called Alex-
andria, after her most gracious Majesty. At the same time
e a proud joy ? so filled ? his breast ? that he burst out into
cheers, and was thus supported in the midst of a heat of 107�
in the shade, which affected the monkeys with sunstroke, and


made them drop dead out of the trees. Captain Lawson, in-
deed, had a slight touch of the same malady, but he shook it
off, and so preserved his reason and senses to survey the new-
found lake. Along its eastern shore the party proceeded for
several days, crossing stream after stream, and morass after
morass, very much annoyed by the monkeys, who probably at-
tributed the death of their respectable relatives mentioned above
to Captain Lawson?s black arts, and pursued them in their
line of march with every mark of contempt, pelting them with
nuts and filth, and spitting down on them from the trees.
? One old fellow, deliberately,? says Captain Lawson, ? spat
? down on me with all the gravity of a human being; ?an ex-
pression we do not quite understand, as it has not been our lot
to live with human beings who spat at us with or without
gravity. With pardonable indignation Captain Lawson shot
the f old fellow,? when his companions pelted him for fully
three hours with wallah nuts, in which space of time he got
quite sore, and his helmet e was battered into a highly disre-
* putable shape.? When this plague of monkeys ceased, and
they had leisure to look about them for other natural curiosi-
ties, they were rewarded by the discovery of the trap-door
spider, much more like a crab, or for that matter like a whale,
than a spider, for when they with some difficulty got it out of
its beautiful nest it proved to be thirteen inches in its utmost
stretch, with nippers half an inch long, and two exceedingly
large and bright black eyes. This yogi, as Aboo called it,
was exceedingly active; and as its bite is as venomous as that
of the scorpion, it is fortunate that it preys not on the human
race, but on lizards, which it seizes when with the fatal curiosity
of their race they peep in at its trap-door, and then sucking all
the juice out of their bodies, rejects the bones and skin. The
heat was still excessive, so much so, indeed, as to cause a
slight aberration in Captain Lawson?s register; for just after
his story of the spider, he says the thermometer was ?as high
? as 112� in the shade, which was the highest degree that I
? noted during my stay in the island ; ? but he had a few pages
before mentioned 114�, a temperature which he again records
at page 197 ; while at page 172 he registers no few r er than 115
degrees in the shade. Can it be that for 112 he wishes us to
read 121 ? that temperature in the shade would be quite in cha-
racter with the rest of his adventures. Be that as it may, it was
hot enough to cause trees to shed their gum in large drops as if
a shower were falling; and when it fell, it lay on the ground
* in a melted state, and hot enough to burn the fingers.? The
party were now getting rather exhausted, and Billy the Aus-


tralian complained of being footsore; but Captain Lawson
declares that it was all a pretence, and that he could walk just
as well as the rest. Still he bore with the shuffling fellow for
two days ; and then, when he refused to stir, and said, ? I British
* subject; Ino dog ; Ino do it; foot him sore, no walk ; ? the
Captain caught up a strap with a heavy buckle, and thrashed
the unhappy Billy ? till his cries ? ?hear them not, O Exeter
Hall and Aborigines Protection Society !? c might have been
� heard for a league round about.? After this, nothing more
was heard of sore feet, and Billy shouldered his burden with
the rest.
By this time, on August 16th, they were in want of meat, and
the Captain went out with Aboo in search of big game, and
after sleeping out were rewarded by the sight of two herds of
buffalo. Singling out an old bull, Captain Lawson stalked
him till he got within thirty yards, and just as he was about
to fire the brute charged him. Firing rather at random, he
discharged two barrels, while Aboo, who had come up, threw
in another shot, but it was all in vain; on rushed the bull,
whom the Captain dexterously avoided only to be overtaken at
the second attack, when he felt what he calls � a terrible shock
�in the rear,? and became aware that he was spinning through
the air. The fact was that the bull had tossed him thirty feet
from the ground ; down he came on his side, and then the brute
stood over him trampling on him and ramming him. At this
terrible moment the Captain?s courage did not fail; he had still,
unlike Robinson Crusoe, his six-shooter in his belt. He drew
it, as the Yankees say, and fired four shots into the bull?s head,
* which had the effect of confusing him a little.? Just then
Aboo came up and fired a bullet through the bull?s shoulder,
which brought him down ; but even then the Captain?s misfor-
tunes were not over, for the monster fell on him and crushed
him with his huge weight. At last, when extricated from the
oarcass, it is not wonderful that our hero, for so we must call
him, conld hardly stand. Fortunately no bones were broken,
but it is not at all surprising that he was shaken and bruised.
While Aboo skinned and cut up the quarry, the Captain lay
quiet till a steak somewhat revived him. Then he tried to walk
the ten miles back to camp, but after a mile his strength failed,
and Aboo lighting a fire went back to bring help. When the
rest arrived the battered Captain was borne back on blankets,
feeling as if his spine was broken at the small of the back. After
a tolerable night he found himself so sore next morning that he
thought he ought to be bled; and here observe both the resources
of the country and of the Captain. It was easy to talk of bleed-


ing, but how was he to be bled ? In the simplest way. Hard
by was a rivulet full of leeches?whether horse-leeches or not
deponent sayeth not. So Aboo went and fetched a score, from
which applied to his loins the Captain derived great benefit.
An incident which reminds us of nothing so much as that
remarkable story in a tale called f Chicken Hazard,? where on
a desert isle a shipwrecked mariner, finding his boiled mutton
tasteless, went out of doors and ? cut some capers,? by the aid
of which he found his meal at once palatable. It was not till
September 2nd that Captain Lawson was well enough to resume
his journey, and it was four or five weeks before he was
entirely free from pain. But even then we think he was a
lucky man to come so well out of what he calls his duel with
the buffalo.
So they proceeded skirting the lake till they came on a
series of morasses, and resolved to leave its shores and to march
in a north-easterly direction. As they advanced the country
rapidly grew hilly and then mountainous, until at an elevation
of 1,597 feet they descried a volcano in a dull state of eruption.
With Captain Lawson to see a mountain is to ascend it, and
perhaps he would add, to ascend a mountain is to see it. It
took them just six hours to scale the summit, where they found
a crater three miles and a quarter ?English, not Dutch miles?
in circumference; but after all it was but a molehill, this Mount
Sulphur, for it was only 3,117 feet high. After this they
descended and discovered another lake, and on September 11th
came upon ? two monkeys of gigantic size and the most human-
-1 like shape.? Like our first parents in Eden they were male
and female, caressing one another, and eating a fruit like an
apricot. This little idyl in ape-life was rudely interrupted by
the rifles of Aboo and his master, for if the Captain was like
Robinson Crusoe, Aboo was surely his man Friday. The
male fell stone dead to the Captain?s fire, but the female, only
wounded, ran up a tree making most diabolical faces and
uttering the most horrid outcries. A second shot brought her
down headlong, but even then she got on her feet, and at last a
bullet from the unfailing six-shooter made her give up the
ghost. Well! now that they are both dead, what was their
size? The male was five feet three, and forty-two inches
round the chest, the female five, and thirty-nine. It is not
complimentary to mankind to be told by the Captain that
( both were horribly repulsive in features and yet human-like
?to an extraordinary degree.? For the rest their description
answers rather to the Orang-outan than to the Chimpanzee,
but most unfortunate it is that the skins of these great apes


could not be brought away, and that their kind must remain a
matter of doubt. But the party were overburdened, and such
an addition might have furnished a fresh outburst of laziness
on the part of Billy and caused him another flogging ; so they
were abandoned in the desert, taking their rest with their gory
skins around them, and the explorers hastened on to fresh
discoveries.
These were now geographical and geological rather than
zoological. Due north they beheld more and more
peakst Mount Vulcan was the name of one burning moun-
tain, which Captain Lawson?s angles ascertained to be 16,743
feet high; another, not burning, they called the Outpost,
because it stood in their w T ay and they had to turn it. _On
rounding this they descried another peak of far greater height,
distant about twenty-five or thirty miles. Of course as soon
as Captain Lawson saw this mountain he resolved to climb
it, induced probably by the abundance of the same small blue
flowers which had proved so useful when scaling the Papuan
Ghauts. By the next night the party had got so close as
six or seven miles from the base of the peak, the summit of
which was veiled in mist; next day the full proportions of
the mountain burst on Captain Lawson, and at first sight
he calculated it to be 30,000 feet high, but on resorting to
his angles it proved to be 32,783 feet above the sea-level,
and 30,901 above the surrounding country. ?ltis by far the
? highest mountain known,? he adds, a serenity and sim-
plicity of assertion which will carry their due weight with
them. The skirts of this giant were clothed with forests,
and to the hill itself Captain Lawson gave the name Mount
Hercules. In old times it would have been considered one of
the labours of Hercules to have scaled such a mountain. But
what was Hercules, and what his labours, to our age of steam
and travel ? At four o?clock on the morning of September 16th,
a day ever to be remembered in the annals of mountain
climbing, the Captain and Aboo began the ascent, taking with
them a supply of food and water, their arms and blankets; the
first a most unnecessary encumbrance, but perhaps Captain
Lawson wished, like John Gilpin, to parry weight, and so took
with him his double-barrelled rifle, his fowling-piece, and six-
shooter. To these a stout staff was added, and then they
started. This, besides its height, was a very peculiar moun-
tain. Perhaps that very stature exercised a paralysing influence
on vegetation, for at the elevation of 2,000 feet the forest
under a tropical sky degenerated into scrubby undergrowth
and coarse grass. At 4,000 feet almost all animal life


ceased, a strange contrast with the wealth of animal and ve-
getable life on the lower slopes of the Himalayan range,
which abounds up to 10,000 or 14,000 feet. Stranger still,
there was no soil except in odd patches at a greater height
than 6,000 feet; above that all seems to have been rock
and snow. Of course there were grand views till the pair got
into the clouds, where they seem to have remained in an atmo-
sphere resembling a wet blanket for the rest of the ascent.
But they did not let the grass groAV under their feet, and
indeed there was no grass to grow. By nine o?clock, that is in
less than five hours, they had ascended 14,000 feet, very tall
walking, seeing that between 10,000 and 14,000 feet ?the rock
( was dangerously slippery owing to a slimy moss.? The Captain
here took off his boots, and Aboo his sandals, in order to
maintain a footing. At 15,000 feet they came on the first
snow, and above this they had to ? climb up an almost perpen-
e dicular face. In doing so masses of rock gave w r ay under
e them, and they received some ugly falls.? At eleven o?clock
they halted to rest and eat, and here both got so drowsy that
they could scarce keep their eyes open. But, as the quack
doctors say, ? Delay is death.? The Captain roused Aboo and
proceeded upward. And now the cold grew excessive. The
thermometer was 12� below zero, and the water in their bottles
froze. Now they felt the good of their blankets, and Aboo
felt so comfortable that he fell several times asleep, and had to
be awakened by rough means. All these are rather impedi-
ments to swift climbing, still they trudged on amidst rocks and
cliffs wreathed with snow. Here the sleepless Captain dozed
off and fell with a shock which effectually roused him. As for
Aboo, he tramped along mechanically. Now the blood began
to flow from their noses, and even from their ears which were
long exposed, and Aboo not unnaturally complained of head-
ache, and begged to be allowed to sit down. This the Captain
successfully resisted, but at the same time saw that it was time
to beat a retreat. The thermometer now marked 22� below
zero ?we conclude of Fahrenheit, and they gasped at every
breath ; worse still, their staves fell from their hands and they
could not pick them up again. How they ever returned with-
out those trusty supports is a marvel to us. It was now one
o?clock, and they had climbed 25,314 feet in nine hours ; cer-
tainly, unless Captain Lawson?s powers of observation were
frozen out of him, the most astounding feat of mountaineering
ever recorded. It took them three hours to descend the
10,000 feet to the first snow, and then they pushed on more
rapidly. At the same time as soon as his fingers were thawed,


a little brandy was served out, which put new life into them ;
and so, says Captain Lawson, f we arrived at our camp about
? half-past-seven in the evening, thoroughly beat.?
We feel we can add little to this wonderful tale which is
already sufficiently long. It is clear that as Captain Webb is
among swimmers so is Captain Lawson, of whom we know not
whether he be a land or sea captain, among climbers. We only
wish we had been there to see him and the trusty Aboo go up
and down 25,000 feet of a perpendicular unexplored mountain
in the time named. Next day they laid up, as they were
rather footsore, but on the 18th they were off again, going due
north. Now they were in the jungle, the haunt of the moo-
lah, and Captain Lawson, who has a large acquaintance with
Bengal tigers, was anxious to see what this Papuan tiger was
like. His wishes were soon gratified ; first they came on the
footprints, and then on the beast himself, which rushed out on
the gallant Captain, who avoided it by a sudden contortion of
the body, but it was a near shave as he felt ? the draught ? of
its charge. At this moment the faithful Tooloo fired at and
wounded it, when it escaped into the jungle. Then they
stalked it in a body. They soon found it, when it received
both barrels of the Captain?s rifle, and charged him be-
fore he could ram down another bullet. Now it was the
Captain?s turn to run with the moolah at his heels, who soon
caught him in his claws. Now it'seemed all over with the
explorer, when he bethought him of a long dagger-knife which
no doubt with other cutlery he kept in his belt; this he drove
up to the hilt in the creature?s side, who turned and bit the
knife; then, feeling that it had done all that moolah could
for life and honour, it fell dead without a growl, and the
Captain extricated himself from the carcass. And now what
was the moolah like? It was of the same shape and size
as the Bengal tiger, but much handsomer. It was marked
with black and chestnut stripes on a white ground, and its
length from the nose to the root of the tail was 7 feet
3 inches. This skin was so beautiful that the Captain
had it dressed by Aboo and brought it away, c it being one
? of the very few articles ? which he succeeded in bringing to
Europe. We should like to see it, and it certainly ought
to be acquired for the Natural History Collections of the
country. A little later on the Captain shot two moolahs
one after the other, of which one, a female, was no less than
7 feet 10 inches from the nose to the tail, and he adds,
* two inches longer than the largest tiger I had seen in
? India.? They now came on many streams infested by croco-
VOL. CXLII. NO. CCXC. M M


diles, some of which they killed and one of which they ate.
One of the rivers they called the ? Gladstone,? and another, the
biggest of all, ? the Royal.? We have now got to September
29th, a day marked by a sad catastrophe, for then it was
that the faithful Tooloo, when suffering from sunstroke, blew
out his brains, and was buried under a tree by the river side.
This sad event almost produced a mutiny, and all except
Aboo tried to force the Captain to return; but he produced
his ultima ratio, a rope?s end, which makes us think that he
must be a sea-captain, and Billy and Joe and the other
Papuan desisted from their murmurs. They now followed the
course of the river through woods and streams, chiefly peopled
by birds of paradise and crocodiles, with the thermometer at
114� in the shade, till their ears were greeted by the distant
roar of a waterfall which could be heard from ten to twenty
miles off. Then next morning they saw the spray and foam
miles off, and at last reached the fall, whence the river, now
contracted from half a mile to 300 yards in width, threw itself
headlong 179 feet sheer down. This was on October 26th;
and again we say we only wish we had been there to see, were
it notfor what follows. Tearing themselves away, they marched
due north along the river, when on the 29th they came on a
party of natives engaged in fishing. ?lt was so long,? says
Captain Lawson, ? since our eyes had rested on any of our own
? species, that the sight filled us with joy.? They shouted, and
the natives shouted and drew near the shore. The end was, in
spite of Aboo?s warning, that the whole party embarked in the
canoes, Captain Lawson having by this time?that is to say
in less than three months?acquired sufficient knowledge of
Papuan to converse freely with the chiefs. Then they pad-
died down the stream, the chief, whom Captain Lawson now
trusted, saying that ? the sea could easily be reached by water
?in two days at the furthest.? That evening they reached the
native village, when Aboo whispered to the Captain that if
they entered it they would never come out alive. On this
Captain Lawson told the chief that he was forced to proceed,
and offered to buy a canoe and food. During this parley a
crowd collected, and tried to land the baggage. The chief
tried to drag the Captain on shore, and when he resisted snapped
an old flint'pistol at his head. It missed fire and the faithful
Danang felled the chief to the earth befor he could recock it.
Then ensued a fearful melee. Poor Joe was stabbed and slain
while trying to re-embark the baggage; the Captain slew his
assailant with an axe; then drawing his he shot
down three fellows in as many seconds. Danang discharged


the double-barrelled rifle among the crowd, killing three men
more. In the struggle they had pushed off their canoe with
some of their goods and paddled for their lives, Danang being
shot through the head by a chance bullet. The party were
now reduced to three, the Captain and Aboo rowing for dear
life, and the recreant Billy. Of course the natives pursued
them, and in ten minutes a canoeful approached the fugitives,
firing as they advanced. By order of Lawson they stopped
their canoe and lay doAvn at the bottom, much to Billy?s com-
fort, but the instant the enemy came alongside, up Captain Law-
son and Aboo started, shot two or three, upset their canoe, and
beating out the brains of a fellow who caught hold of their
paddles, resumed their flight. It was then nearly dark, though
the moon was rising, leaving them a poor chance of escape.
Strange to say, so far as they knew, there was no other
attempt at pursuit. The three got clear off in their canoe,
and they saw no more of their murderous assailants, who per-
haps may have thought the Captain?s party murderous too.
Paddling all that night they landed at dawn, sank the canoe,
and surveyed their stock of goods. There was, indeed,
little left. Everything except one bundle had fallen into the
hands of the enemy. A few skins, a small stock of ammuni-
tion, and the Captain?s journal, and a couple of other books,
were all that remained. All their rifles, four in number, one
of them double-barrelled, and the Captain?s fowling-piece had
been lost. Still they had two rifles left: on which we remark
that the Captain?s double-barrelled rifle must have produced
others on the journey, for we only hear of one when they
started, and yet it and three others had been lost, and still two
remained. In addition there was a pistol, we suppose the six-
shooter, and so, as Billy was not to be trusted, they had arms
enough. In this position it was madness to make for the north-
east coast, now only thirty miles off. Their only hope w T as
to regain the uninhabited interior whence they had emerged.
After this catastrophe Captain Lawson?s exploration loses
much of its romantic character. They altered their route,
struck up the country, and succeeded, after some perils from
scorpions, in sighting Mount Hercules and reaching the Glad-
stone River. In great danger of famishing for want of food
owing to the failure of their ammunition, and occasionally
driven mad by thirst, they reached the north-west shore of Lake
Alexandrina, of which, now considering themselves on safe
ground, they ascertained the dimensions. They had only twenty
charges of powder left on December 14th, but what of that,
were they not almost at home ? The lake was from sixty to


seventy miles long and from fifteen to thirty broad. . From
the multitude of islands on it Captain Lawson supposes it to
be shallow. This survey completed, they made their way
back to Mahalla?s village, which they reached on the 19th of
January, who treated them with the utmost hospitality, and
took them down with him to Houtree, where they arrived on
the Bth of February 1873.
At Houtree Captain Lawson found the goods he had left
behind him all safe. Nothing now remained but to pay off
Aboo, his man Friday, which "he did with a sum which made
him ? quite a nabob ?in the eyes of the natives. The wages
of poor Danang were handed over to his wife. His only at-
tendant now left was the lazy and worthless Billy, with whom
the Captain embarked on the 24th of February in a Chinese
junk bound for the Island of Banda, where he hoped to find
a Dutch vessel. The junk was small, of about fifty tons,
manned by four Chinese and tw r o boys, who ate nothing on the
voyage but rice and salt fish eked out with beetles and cock-
roaches. They never seemed to sleep, and disturbed the
Captain, who slumbered on his boxes, with their chattering and
laughter. On the Ist of March they reached Banda, where
Governor received the traveller kindly, and assigned
him a lodging in the house of a customs? officer till he could
find a'passage. Next morning Captain Lawson was too
rise, being prostrated with dysentery, which nearly carried him
off. Fortwo months he kept his bed in the military hospital,
carefully tended by the Dutch, while the ungrateful Billy
never came near him, but passed his time, as a free Biitish
subject and not a dog, in constant intoxication. No doubt he
still dreaded .that rope?s end. On the 7th of .June Captain Law-
son left Banda for Singapore, at which port he arrived on the
22nd of that month, whence he passed on to Calcutta, where
a ship was found to carry Billy back to Sydney. >
Shortly afterwards Captain Lawson set sail for England,
where he arrived, as he says, completely broken down with the
fatigues and hardships which he had undergone; a misfoitune
much to be regretted by the scientific world, as the state of his
health, we understand, has prevented the bold traveller from
attending the meetings of the Geological and other learned
bodies who were eager to greet and listen to the man who had
seen and done such wonders in the unknown interior of New
Guinea. But as Captain Lawson has preferred to lay his disco-
veries before the world in this book, his proceedings are open to
criticism ; and we say at once, that it contains many things very
difficult to understand. In the first place, it is hard to under-


stand how on the very edge of the Australian Continent he
should have found such wealth of annual and vegetable lite all
at the same time so different from Australian t} pes. Very
strano-e it is that Torres Straits should separate two countries
so various in their vegetable products and natural history as
New Holland and New Guinea as described by Lawson. (Jn
one side of that comparatively narrow strait, we leave the lanu
of parrots and tree kangaroos and marsupial creatures ; while
on the other, Captain Lawson introduces us to large herds ot
buffaloes and other cattle, to deer of various kinds, to monkeys
and huge apes, and, though last not least, to huge tigeis,
for the moolah is nothing more nor less than a tiger it
is true that it may be possible to find many strange shapes
and forms of life in an island nearly 1,300 miles long and
in some parts about 500 miles broad; but we must say that m
no book except that very respectable but somewhat mawkish
production the ? Swiss Family Robinson,? have we ever
perused pages so teeming with every necessary lor the hte
of man as these of Captain Lawson. The party never seems
to have lacked anything but water, and then though they
were once or twice perishing from thirst, it was their ov n
fault that they did not find it close at hand. Very different
this ao-ain from the arid wastes of Australia, in which so
many Valuable lives have been lost by drought. _ Nor can we
fail to remark the palpable air of exaggeration in the whole
story, which makes the book read more like an amusing
romance of travel than serious travel itself. Everything is on
the grandest and most gigantic scale; and very strange, it
true, it is to find that in one island, even though it be ot the
size of New Guinea, there should have been found by one and
the same traveller in a six months? journey, the most gigantic
trasses, the biggest scorpions, spiders, and butterflies, the
hugest tigers and buffaloes, the most monstrous apes and cro-
codiles, one of the largest rivers and waterfalls in the world;
and, though last not least, a mountain by far exceeding the
loftiest peaks in the Andes or Himalayan chains. With re-
ward to his observations and angles, Captain Lawson is as
hazy as his own Mount Misty. That there are high moun-
tains in New Guinea has long been known; the observations
of the lamented Captain Owen Stanley, about whose angles
there could be no mistake, had ascertained that one corner
of the island, not far from the coast, was a mountain between
13,000 and 14,000 feet high. That we can well credit on such
authority; but when we are asked to believe that an unknown
traveller, cf whose powers of observation we have no evidence


except this very romantic narrative, lias discovered and actu-
ally ascended in nine hours 25,000 and odd feet of a moun-
tain 32,783 feet high, we find ourselves at once in a region so
far above our ordinary experience, and on a platform so elevated
above the summit of scientific inquiry, that our breath is taken
from us. The .result is that when we try to swallow Captain
Lawson?s account, we are as unequal to the task as he and his
man Aboo were to breathe in the rarefied atmosphere on the
top of Mount Hercules. But in our distress we have one
comfort?such discoveries will surely attract a whole army of
Alpine climbers to the interior of New Guinea. They will
scorn the spiders, scorpions, monkeys, apes, and crocodiles.
They will snap their fingers at the Papuans, or brain them
with alpenstocks, if they come between them and the object
of their search. They may not, indeed, be such philologers as
Captain Lawson, and able after three months to converse
freely with chiefs in the original Papuan; but they will find
means of telling them that they have come to see and scale
that mountain, and that nothing shall hinder them. That done,
and having ascended every inch of these 32,000 and odd feet,
they will be content, light their pipes, and glide down to the
base of Mount Hercules in less than two hours ; and if what
the Germans term their Beinkleider suffer in that rapid evolu-
tion, Avhat will that matter ? they will stitch them up with
Adam?s Needle, which we are frequently informed grows plen-
tifully at the foot of the mountain. After that they will re-
turn home attended by a train of botanists and zoologists, who
will bring showers of gum, live moolahs, tame orang-outangs,
and boxes containing lively scorpions and spiders. The Lake
Alexandrina, and Mount Hercules, and the waterfall on the
Royal, they will leave behind them for future travellers, and
when they return home they shall have a hearty welcome. And
now but one word remains to be added. When all this hap-
pens, and we have received such ample corroboration of the
genuineness of Captain Lawson?s explorations in New Guinea,
we shall, like that mediaeval pope, accept for true every word
that he has written; but till then we must suspend our belief.
This confirmation, in part at least, may be nearer than we
think. Other travellers and explorers have been, and are, in
New Guinea, besides Captain Lawson. The strange Russian
enthusiast, Mikiucho Maklay, recently passed a year with two
companions on the coast of New Guinea ; and two Italian men
of science, Beccari and D?Albertis, are probably at this moment
in the interior of that island. May they soon return, and
bring a confirmation, or a contradiction, of all the marvels
related by our modern Maundeville.
