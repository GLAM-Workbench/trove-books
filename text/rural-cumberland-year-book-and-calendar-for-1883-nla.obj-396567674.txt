BLADON’S
Compound Eucalyptus Oil.
AUSTRALIA’S CURATIVE BALSAM.
EY the Profession and Scientific Chemists generally, not only
of Australia, but in the different Hospitals and Medical Schools of the
grea4 Euro].ean Continent, th« many virtues of the Eucalypti have, and
“ justly so,” been widely extolled. The various forms of exhibition have
hitherto, however, been confined to that of Gum. Oil, Extract, or Leaves,
but I have long held the opinion that combination with other well-known
gums possessing powerful anodyne and curative properties, would greatly
enhance their medicinal value. lam now, after a series of experimental
research and careful testing, able to state that results fully confirm such ;
and I feel honored in first placing before the public a combination which has
increased their natural effectiveness, and produced such an elegant and
reliable APPLICATION as to stamp it a triumph of pharmaceutical art.
I trust, therefore, I shall receive the reward that is due to all who give
to society either an additional blade of grass or the means of obtaining relief
by remedies familiar to us as household words.

PREFACE.
In the following pages the Public are presented with (1) a full
and accurate Official Directory: (2) a Statistical Account (includ-
ing electoral, parliamentary, industrial, agricultural, educational,
sporting, and general information), and (3) an anecdotally remi-
niscent, gossipy Descriptive Sketch of the Parramatta, Central
Cumberland, and Nepean Districts,
The Descriptive Sketch deals with the “ historic borough ” of
Parramatta, its suburbs and adjacent townships; with Penrith
and neighbouring villages on the Cumberland side of the river ;
with Liverpool and vicinage; with Pyde, and the country of
which Kissing Point is the centre ; with St. Mary’s, Blaektown,
Castle Hill, and their respective local points of interests. It has
been specially revised and in parts rewritten for this edition.
The Second Part (“Statistical,” etc.) contains in addition to
the matter which appeared under same heading in last year's edition
(and which has been corrected to date), information under the
following sub-heads : —lnterest Table: To Ascertain the Weight
of Cattle : Sale of Poisons : Placed Horses for the Hawkesbury
Guineas, etc. : Lampass in Horses : Width of Streets and Lanes
Act: Local Option; Disinfectants and Deodorisers : Preventa-
tives against Disease: Seasonable Memoranda for Hot Weather
(re lightning stroke, sunstroke, snake bite, the apparently
drowned, bites of dogs, bee stings, etc.): Newspaper as an
Educator; etc., etc.
An Almanack for the Year 1883 is another new feature of this
edition. The Cultural Guide this year appears with the
Almanack.
As the Proprietor hopes to make every successive edition of
his Year Book an improvement on the preceding one, he would
feel deeply indebted to any rural Cumberlander, who by con-
tributing fresh matter of local importance for subsequent issues,
or by correcting any errors that may have crept into this, will
assist him to make his Rural Cumberland Year Book an authori-
tative guide to those populous and - prosperous districts to which
its pages refer.
December, 1882.


Prevention Better than Cure.
WAE!
THE COST OF WAR.—“ Give me the money that has been spent
in war, and I will purchase every foot of land upon the globe ; I will clothe
every man, woman, and child in an attire of which kings and queens would
he proud; I will build a schoolhouse on every hillside and in every valley
over the whole earth ; I will build au academy in every town, and endow
ita college in every state, and will fill it with able professors; I will
crown every hill with a place of worship consecrated to the promulgation of
the gospel of peace; I will support in every pulpit an able teacher of
righteousness, so that on every Sabbath morning the chime on one hill
shall answer the chime on another round the earth’s wide circumference,
and the voice of prayer and the song of praise should ascend, like a
universal holocaust, to heaven.” — Richakd.
WHAT IS MORE TERRIBLE THAN WAR?
“ I will tell you what is ten times, and TEN THOUSAND TIMES,
more terrible than War, —Outraged Nature. She kills, and kills, and is
never tired of killing, till she has taught man the terrible lesson he is so
slow to learn—that nature is only conquered by obeying her. . . . Man
has his courtesies of war; he spares the woman and child. But nature is
fierce when she is offended, as she is bounteous and kind when she is
obeyed. She spares neither woman nor child. She has no pity ; for some
awful, but most good reason, she is not allowed to have any pity. Silently,
she strikes the sleeping child with as little remorse as she would strike the
strong man with the musket or the pickaxe in his hand.’’— Kingsley.
For the means of Prevention and Preserving Health by natural means,
read the large sheet wrapped round every bottle of
Bladon’s Health Saline or Life Salt.
Important to Travellers. —Do not start on a journey without first
packing a bottle of BLADON’S HEALTH SALINE or LIFE SALT in
your valise or travelling trunk.
Important to Mothers. —Keep in the nursery a bottle of BLADON’S
HEALTH SALINE or LIFE SALT. The little ones take it with
pleasure. Remember Healthy Childhood promotes Robust Manhood.
BLADON’S HEALTH SALINE or LIFE SALT when taken with
water, acts as a natural aperient; its simple but natural action removes all
impurities, thus preserving and restoring health. If its great value in
keeping the body in health were universally known, no family would be
without it. In hot or foreign climates it is invaluable. It relieves the
system of effete or poisonous matter, the groundwork of fevers and other
diseases, which if retained, poisons the blood and produces the most
disastrous consequences. It allays nervous excitement, and restores the
nervous system to its proper condition (by natural means).
Sold in patent stoppered bottles by all reputable Chemists. &c.
Now exercise caution, and do not be persuaded to purchase useless
imitations, only offered you by unscrupulous persons who, to obtain larger
profits, think first of thtir own pockets, placing the best friend you have to
front life with —HEALTH second

The Art of Orange Growing.
As an aide-memoire to the Orangeculturist we offer the following lines, written
some year or so back by ‘‘Wrecker,” in his “Flotsam” column of the
Cumberland Mercury. They are an accurate though humorous summary
of the prize essay on the above art by Mr. Alderman Cox, of Parramatta: —
Choose, if for A 1 oranges you hope,
A north-east aspect and a well-drained slope:
[N.B. —Don’t shirk the draining. If you do,
The chances are the profits will shirk you].
Set your plants shallow. Form the tree with care
And near the butt the leading roots leave bare.
If blight or aphis come—they didn’t oughter—
Sulphur apply, and scrub with clear spring water.
Work the land constantly, nor “ scamp ” the hoe,
And keep it moist, else all will prove “ no go.”
If to these words you due attention pay
Your Orange Kulture’s safe to prove O.K-

To Ascertain the Weight of Cattle.
Measure the girt close behind the shoulder, and the length from the fore
part of the shoulder-blade along the hack to the bone at the tail, which is in
a vertical line with the buttock, both in feet. Multiply the square of the
girt, expressed in feet, by five times the length, and divide the product by
21; the quotient is the weight, nearly, of the four quarters, in imperial
stones of 14 lbs. avoirdupois. For example, if the girt be 6 feet, and the
length feet, we shall have 6x 6 = 36, and x 5 = 26£; then 36 x
=945, and this, divided by 21, gives 45 stones exactly. It is to be observed,
however, that in very fat cattle, the four quarters will be about one-twentieth
more, while in those in a very lean state they will he one-twentieth less than
the weight obtained by the rule.
Interest Table.
Without an elaborate series of tables it is impossible to show the amount
of Interest due upon any given sum, at 2J, 3,5, or any other rate per cent.,
but for ordinary purposes it may be easily calculated by a very simple process.
At 5 per cent, per annum, the amount of Interest upon one pound for
every month is one penny; having ascertained what this amounts to, other
rates may be reckoned by adding to, or dividing it:
per cent, is one-half.
3 per cent, is six-tenths.
3| per cent, is seven-tenths.
4 per cent, is four-fifths.
Thus, 5 per cent, upon £6O for 10 months would be £2 10s. ; per cent.,
£l os.; at 3 per cent., £1 10s.; at per cent., £1 15s. ;at 4 per cent., £2.
If the rate of Interest be more than 5 per cent., then the addition must be
added. Thus, to reckon per cent., add one-fourth ; for per cent., one-
half. Bankers and money-dealers calculate the Interest for every day, and
have volumes of tables constructed specially for the purpose, the 5 per cent,
tables alone extending to nearly 400 pages.
Sale of Poisons.
The Board of Pharmacy is by 40 Yic., No. 9, appointed by the Governor
and made “to consist of the President of the N.S.W, Medical Board, the
Medical Adviser to the Government and the Council of the Pharmaceutical
Society of N.S.W.” No person can sell any poison, unless certified by this
Board, under a penalty not exceeding £5O. The Board keeps a -‘Register
of Chemists, Druggists, and other persons,” which is published every
January.

Lampass in Horses.
‘‘The Animals’ Protection Society having had their attention called to a
painful operation frequently performed on the mouth of the horse, for the
cure of lampass, referred the matter to Mr. John Stewart, their hon. veterin-
ary surgeon, for his opinion, and the following is his reply:—During the
fifty years that I have been attending to the ailments of horses, I have never

met with a single case that required such an operation as that which farriers
are in the habit of performing for the cure of lampass. Very often I have
to attend horses whose only ailment is an injury done to the roof of the mouth
by some farrier, who has scooped out some portion of it by a red-hot iron. I
am frequently requested by owners or grooms to burn out the lampass, be-
cause they prevent the horse from feeding. In some cases I find the horse
has some complaint which deprives him of his appetite for food; in others I
find that the horse does not eat his corn because he has never been used to
eat anything but grass or hay; in others I find the horse is changing some of
his back teeth, and refuses corn because his gums are tender. Sometimes I
am asked to operate when the horse has nothing whatever the matter with
him, but his owner or groom fancies that the little pad behind the front teeth
of the upper jaw is more prominent than it ought to be. In point of fact, it
is no higher than it ought to be in a horse of his age. It is naturally and al-
ways more prominent in young than in mature or aged horses, I often hear
that the horse began to feed immediately after the lampass were burnt out;
but I cannot believe all I hear. I know that the pad, however prominent,
never does prevent the horse from feeding. It cannot be touched by the
teeth of the lower jaw. Some veterinarians do, occasionally or habitually,
burn for the lampass ; not because the operation is necessary, but because
owners insist upon it. Burning for the lampass has never been sanctioned at
any of the veterinary colleges in the United Kingdom, nor by any modern
veterinary author in the English language The operation is not only quite
unnecessary, it is extremely painful, and for a long time afterwards the horse
resists all attempts to do anything about his mouth or head. I have never
performed the operation myself, nor allowed it to be done on my premises. ”
Width of Streets and Lanes Act.
“ Be it enacted by the Queen’s Most Excellent Majesty, by and with the
advice and consent of the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly of
New South Wales in Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same
as follows :
“I. Every street laid out or defined, after the passing of this Act, shall be
sixty-six feet wide at least, and every lane laid out or defined, after the pass-
ing of this Act, shall be twenty feet wide at least.
“2. Any land sold, transferred, leased, or built upon, in violation of the
provisions of the foregoing section shall, when necessary, to make the width
of any such street or lane equal to the requirements of this Act, be deemed to
that extent to form part of every such street or lane ; Provided that when it
is necessary to define the width of any street or lane under this Act, the
necessary width may be determined by measuring from the centre of such
street or lane.
“3. Except in the case of allotments having water frontage, it shall not be
lawful to build any dwelling-house fronting any lane within the operation of
this Act, unless such house and its appurtenances be twenty-three feet at the
least from such lane: and any premises built as a dwelling-house, or occupied
or inhabited as such, although such premises, or any part thereof, are occu-
pied or used for other purposes at the same time shall, if built in contraven-
tion of this section, be deemed to be an encroachment, and if within the city
of Sydney, may be dealt with by the proper authority as an encroachment
under the provisions of the ‘ Sydney Corporation Act of 1879,’ and if within
any municipality, shall be deemed to be a nuisance within the meaning of the
one hundred and thirty-second section of the ‘ Municipalities Act of 1867 ’ ”

or any frontage to any street, or lane, or any continuation of any street or
lane defined or built upon, or any building commenced, or building agree-
ment entered into before the passing of this Act, or any law or regulation
not repugnant to the provisions of this Act, provided that no such continua-
tion as hereinbefore mentioned shall extend beyond the next intersecting
street.
“5. This Act shall be styled and may be cited as the ‘Width of Streets

Local Option.
Section 34 of the new Licensing Act provides that the granting of new
publicans licenses, or the removal of licenses, shall be in the city of Sydney
or in any municipality contingent upon the ratepayers’ option. Should the
vote be in the affirmative, the granting of new licenses, or the removal of
licenses shall be unaffected by the provisions of the section for three years —
or, in other words, until another vote is taken. But if the vote be taken in
the negative, then no new license or certificate for the removal of licenses
shall be granted for the space of three years, when a vote shall be again
taken. It is provided that the section shall not apply to any area where no
vote of the ratepayers is taken, or if the voting is a nullity ; nor shall it
prejudice or affect any publican whose premises may have been destroyed or
rendered uninhabitable by fire within 12 months prior to the passing of the
Act, if the premises are rebuilt and he applies for his license within 12
months after the parsing of the Act.
The first subsection (sect. 34) enacts that the ratepayers in municipalities
other than the city of Sydney may give a local option vote; such vote to
be taken every three years.
Subsection 4 (sect. 34) directs that for the purpose of taking the votes of
ratepayers under this section, voting papers to be termed ‘ ‘ local option
papers ” shall be provided by the Mayor of the city of Sydney, and by the
returning-officers for all the municipalities, which shall be in the following
form:—
“Licensing Act of 1882.
“local option voting-paper.
“ Ward of City of Sydney or Municipality of or
Municipality of (if unsubdivided).
“ Shall any new publicans’ licenses or removals of publicans’ licenses be
granted in respect of premises situate within the above [Ward or Muni-
cipality] for the period of three years from this date ?
“ [Voter’s answer.]
“ Yes.
“ No.
“ Directions.
“ The voter must strike out the word ‘ Yes ’ if he desire to record his vote
against increasing the number of public-houses within the area referred to.
If he do not desire so to record his vote he should strike out the word ‘No.’ ”
In other words, “ Yes ” means more public-houses ; and “ INo ” means no
more.
Subsection 7 (sect. 34) relating to procedure by voters, is as follows:
“Everyvoter receiving such ‘local option paper’ shall, for the purpose of
voting under this section, deal with the same in accordance with the

directions contained therein. And thereupon he shall pursue the same course
in respect to such paper as he would be required by law to pursue in respect
to ballot-papers at municipal elections. And if such voter he blind or
unable to read, the proper officer shall take the same course for the purpose
of permitting such voter to vote under this section, as is prescribed by law
in respect to blind or illiterate voters at annual elections in municipalities.
The Bth subsection (sect. 34) says : —lf the voting under this section shall
take place on the occasion of a contested municipal election, the voter, if he
desire to vote hereunder, shall be furnished with the local option paper to
which he is entitled at the same time as he receives his ballot-paper or papers
but in that case he shall deposit the local option paper in a seperate ballot-
box which shall be provided for that purpose. If the election be not a con-
tested one, or in case of the first voting in the City of Sydney under this Act,
the local option papers shall be dealt with in all respects (subject to the pro-
visions of this Act) as if they were ballot-papers. And no questions shall be
asked of a voter in respect of his voting hereunder except the following:—
‘Are you the person named as , number , on the roll for
ward or this municipality ?” And such questions shall not he
asked of any voter who shall have been asked and have duly answered the
question or questions by law permitted in the case of voters at municipal
elections.”
By subsection 9 (sect. 34) the provisions of the Acts relating to municipal-
ities and to the Corporation of the City of Sydney, so far as they regulate or
prescribe the qualifications and disqualifications of electors, and the method
of procedure at elections, &c., are to apply to this Act.
The next two subsections (sect. 34) relate to the provisions for voting in a
new municipality or ward, and to the case of there being no election for
aldermen at any election at which a vote ought to be taken under this Act, in
which case the interval of three years shall be reckoned from the date of the
taking of an effective vote of the ratepayers.
Subsection 12 (sect. 34) reads thus : —‘‘The result of every voting here-
under shall be ascertained as follows : —lf a number of votes in the negative
shall be given equal to or exceeding eleven-twentieths of the aggregate
number of votes polled, the ratepayers’ option shall be held to have been
exercised in the negative, otherwise such option shall be held to have bepn
exercised in the affirmative. In the former case the restrictions upon new
publicans’ licenses or removals v ill take effect, in the latter case the voting
will have no effect upon such licenses or removals. The officers to count and
otherwise with the votes shall be those who at ordinary municipal elec-
tions would be the proper officers to ascertain the poll, but no scrutineers
shall be required in respect of such votes.
By the 13th subsection (sect. 34) the manner in which the declaration and
notification of the result of the voting is to be made, is laid down. The
returning officer is to declare the result to the Minister as soon as practicable,
and the Minister, within seven days, is to notify the same in the Government
Gazette ; such notification is to be judicially notified by all licensing courts
and magistrates of the licensing district in question. Subsection 14 (sect 34)
enacts that all expenses incurred in taking the local option vote are to be
defrayed from the same fund as the ordinary municipal expenses would be
taken from.
Section 35 qualities the preceding section, as follows: —Notwithstanding
any vote in the negative taken in and for any area as aforesaid declared and
notified under the next preceding section, the Licensing Court may grant
licenses under this part for hotels within such area containing not less than
twenty rooms suitable for public accommodation, in addition to the standard

Disinfectants and Deodorisers.
We abridge subjoined remarks from a paper read some year or so ago
before the Council of the Health Society of New South Wales :
There is a general idea that whatever deodorises must disinfect. This,
however, is not the case. Disinfectants are those substances (gaseous or
basic) which purify, or in other words chemically destroy and neutralise
poisonous, foetid or noxious eases. Deodorisers, on the other hand, are
chemical substances which merely cover these atmospheric impurities, or
overpower them by their own pungency. Among a great, number of popular
preparations offered to the public as disinfectants may be mentioned several
of what may be termed the most fashionable namely, chloride of lime, chlorine
gaseous and in solution (chlorinated water), Condy’s fluid, chloride of zinc
and soda, chloralum (chloride of alumina), Collins’ powder (chloride of lime
and alumina), carbolic acid, sulpho-carbilate of lime, the zymotic disinfect-
ants and ozonized water, and, lastly, peroxide of hydrogen. Among such a
large number of so-called disinfectants, the public are naturally left in doubt
as to which is really the most effectual, and at the same time the cheapest mode
of destroying noxious gases, or rendering pure the atmosphere of a room or
habitation contaminated by infectious or contagious diseases. Very little or
no faith should be placed in deodorisers; and even in the use of the former
a certain amount of discrimination must necessarily be used; as for instance,
the same chemical substance which would purify a drain or closet, would be
quite ineffectual in preventing infection, or the absorption of poison from an
atmosphere tainted with zymotic disease or malaria. For the prevention of
contagion from small-pox; measles, scarlatina, and diseases of this class, it is
absolutely necessary to destroy, or (more properly speaking) to chemically
change the nature of the atmosphere in the infected habitations, as well as
(so far as is possible) to destroy the germs of infection thrown off from those
who are afflicted with these complaints; and for this purpose, gaseous disin-
fectants should be used, either chlorine or oxygen gas.
For hospitals, asylums, and other large buildings, as also for rooms and in
private houses, chloride of lime may be used with great benefit by placing a
small quantity in a saucer, and sprinkling on a few drops of diluted sulphuric
acid or vinegar, a salt of lime is foi'med, and chlorine gas is generated.
Another useful method of obtaining the vapour of chlorine in a weaker form,
is by mixing about a teaspoonful in a pint of water, and, when it has sub-
sided, dipping rags into the clear solution, and suspending in the apartments.
By blowing air through a mechanical mixture of turpentine and water at a
temperature of 40 Cent., large quantities of peroxide of hydrogen in aqueous
solution may be prepared possessing extraordinary antiseptic and disinfecting
properties. For the disinfecting of sewers, drains, water-closets, etc., non-
gaseous substances may be used, in most cases highly diluted. One of the
best and perhaps the cheapest will be found in the chloride of lime in solu-
tion. By taking about an ounce of this substance, and mixing it in two
quarts of water, allowing this to subside, and throwing about half a pint into
the pan of a patent closet, or double the quantity, by means of a common
watering pot, down a common closet or drain, or into the excreta of persons


suffering from scarlatina, small-pox, or typhoid fever (and particularly the
latter), a great cause of the spread of these diseases may be prevented.
Where the chlorine smell is-objectionable, the solution of chloride of lead or
zinc, or any of the other disinfectants may be used.
Preventatives Against Disease.
CLEANLINESS: VENTILATION: DRAINAGE.
The following remarks are abridged from an admirable paper on the
subject, by Dr. Eadon:
Three conditions tend to develope zymotic diseases, —small-pox, scarlatina,
cholera, &c., &c, Ist. Certain altered states of the electric condition of the
atmosphere. 2nd. Foul emanations from nidi of filth. 3rdly. A suscepti-
bility in parties to the action of these untoward influences.
In a high state of health, the two former conditions may be present, and
no injurious effects be produced; if, however, the vital force is lowered in
tone, the body at once becomes a sort of sponge, ready to suck up any or all
of the morbid dynamic particles, wherewith it may be surrounded. In times
when zymotic diseases are prevalent, everyone should endeavour by the use
of hygienic means to attain to as unimpressionable a condition of body as
possible, against surrounding morbific influences; and since the skin, with
its 7,000,000 of pores, and its 28 miles nearly of tubular'drainage, is nature’s
great safety-valve, the healthy action of this part of the body claims the first
and most persevering attention. The skin should exhale nearly 51bs. of
effete matter (home-made poison) every 24 hours. If thousands of pores are
obstructed from inattention to ablutions, frictions, shampooing, and exercise,
this complete eliminative process becomes impassable, and the body is
poisoned from its own manufactory.
Daily ablutions, then, in some form or other, are indispensably necessary
to health.
The battle of life is a hard fight. The brain is always at work—excited,
congested, and mostly on the brink of inflammation. Keep the head cool
and the feet warm, says the proverb, but how ? —by constantly bathing the
feet in cold water, and letting the head alone. The oftener the feet are
cooled the hotter they become, and the cooler the opposite pole—tlm head.
Daily footbaths, of 3 inches in depth, for seven minutes, with friction all
the time with the wet hand, are of immense advantage. If time will not
admit of this, take hand baths in the same way ; but there is an internal skin
also —a continuation of the external one, and 32 feet in length from the
mouth to its extreme point. What of this ? Surely if the outward skin
requires so much care, the inward should not be neglected. This is the
great sewer of the human body, and down it all kinds of things are thrown,
both good and bad. How is this to be cleansed ? There is only one thing in
nature that can do it, and that is Pure Water. Water is the grand solvent
of Nature. No man can pretend to cleanliness who does not flush his
inward skin —the internal mucous membrane —with six or eight tumblers of
water daily.
Whatever tends to hurry on and use up the vitality of the system in pesti-
lential times should be avoided. All foods, drinks, and condiments of H
stimulating character, should be taken sparingly, as they increase vascular
action, and produce a greater waste of life power, where not taken in states
of great debility. Whatever is taken as a beverage, there can be but one


opinion as to the necessity of drinking a certain amount of pure water daily,
since seven-tenths of the body itself is pure water alone, a part of which
being constantly exhaled, transpired, and eliminated in some form or other,
must have a constant and a daily supply in its simple, pure, and unadulter-
ated form to supply the loss.
Bear in mind, then, the following items as preventive of small pox,
endemic fever, &c., &c.
A clear skin, internal and external.
Avoid excesses of all kinds, and late hours.
Avoid exposure to night air, and sudden chills.
Avoid checking the perspiration when the body is perspiring, i.e. —cover
up at once.
Preserve by suitable clothing, an equable temperature of the body.
Take regular exercise in the best part of the day.
Walk before a meal, not after—rest after meals.
Keep the feet dry, change the boots when damp.
Avoid all exhaustions of every sort.
In each case live on the diet which experience has proved best, and well
masticate the food.
Avoid over-feeding, as this brings on a condition inceptive of disease.
Do not take beer or wine on an empty stomach : eat first.
Avoid meat not fresh or hut imperfectly cooked, and fish not quite fresh.
Avoid fruit and vegetables long kept.
Be sparing of refrigerating drinks, and never take them when in d state of
perspiration.
Let it be a sacred duty to avoid fasting.
Take the last meal at 7 in the evening.
Do not remain in crowded or badly ventilated rooms.
Never sit in currents of air in any position, currents falling upon or
playing against the back of the head produce effects injurious in the highest
degree—often paralysis.
If the barometer suddenly fall, and the dew point suddenly rise, at once
take heed to all your surroundings.
Ventilation, drainage, and having a supply of pure water, are the safe-
guards of household cleanliness.
Let the house he well ventilated. If there are any noxious vapours floating
about, this plan will render them less injurious. There should he no stagnant
air in any room of a house. *
When dust collects remove it, as it affords a soil peculiarly receptive of
poisonous influences.
Do not let the elements of contagion accumulate in cellars, yards, cess-
pools, or out-buildings. Stagnant water should be drained off, and no
rotten vegetables allowed to remain.
Offal and garbage should at once he buried.
The hog-pen and pigs’ wash-tub are fruitful sources of disease. If
piggeries must he kept, they should he removed far away from human
dwellings.
Let the cellars and kitchens he quick-lime washed once or twice a year,
and the mouths of drains he well secured with a close-fitting hell-trap. The
milk of lime, i.e., quick-lime recently burned, and mixed with ten times its
hulk of water, and thrown down the sinks and sewers, will decompose and
destroy the offensive gas generated in them.
To test the purity of water, add one drop of Condy’s crimson fluid to a
tumbler of water, and there will he a faint pink hue; if in half an hour more
the water turns yellowish, it is tainted and cannot he used with safetv. If


on adding one drop more of Condy’s fluid, and letting it stand for a time, the
colour again changes, the water is very foul indeed.
The dangerous qualities of water are not obviated by the addition of
wines or spirits.
In regard to Municipal Cleanliness :
There can be no multiplication of a new-formed stock of poison centres, if
there be no nidus of filth for its attraction, and consequent reception. A
clean town, or city, with a clean population, may be surrounded with
pestilential currents, and no harm will come nigh their dwellings. Healthy
bodies re-act against disease, and miasmata cannot affect them. But when
the morbific currents come in contact with the local malaria of a city or
town, in which reside masses of people who have constantly infringed the
organic laws in every way, and for a whole life, thereby rendering their
bodies susceptible to take on every form of disease, then the danger is most
imminent, and unless quick and sanitary measures are adopted forthwith, a
whole population may be swept off in a few weeks. Under these man-created
conditions, the disease begins at once (as Majendier says) where all other
diseases end —in death.
Hence it follows that boards of health or municipal authorities, have a
grave responsibility upon them in times of zymotic outbreak. And it is
incumbent for every city to have an inspector of nuisances to visit, examine,
and report on the following sources of disease: —
1. That the water drunk should not be tainted with house refuse, or any
other kind of filth.
2. That there is no filtration of cesspools or foxil ditches into springs, or
wells, from which water is drawn.
3. That dip-wells, and the pumps of private houses, be free from organic
matters derived from the adjacent suo-soil.
4. That the accumulation of house refuse be at once removed.
5. That the bell-traps in house drains be rendered as secure as possible.
6. That a thorough lime washing of houses and outhouses be enforced if
suspected of infection,
7. That the tanks and reservoirs for the public supply of water be
examined, likewise the butts and cisterns of private houses.
8. That all sewers, gutters, ditches, urinals, the ponding of drainages,
sinks, cesspools, middens, should be disinfected, when nauseous effluvia is
perceived.
9. That slaughter-houses be cleansed, and all offal buried.
Seasonable Memoranda for Hot Weather.
PERSONS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.
First Remedy .— When a person is struck by lightning, strip the body and
throw buckets of cold water over it from ten to fifteen minutes ; inflate the
lungs by placing patient on back on flat surface; grasp patient’s arms just
above the elbows, draw the arms gently forward and steadily upwards until
they meet above the head (this elevates ribs, and gives space for air to rush
in.) Keep the arms in that position for two seconds, then turn down
patient’s arms, and press them gently and firmly for two seconds against
sides of chest (this presses air out of lungs) ; repeat these movements at the
rate of fifteen movements to the minute ; persevere for two hours at least;
apply continual frictions all over the body, apply also blisters to the breast,


and administer stimulants as brandy and sal-volatile, Second. —In this case
nothing answers so well as electricity, and if a skilful person can he procured
to administer them, gentle shocks should be made to pass through the chest,
until returning life manifests itself. Caution. —As trees, haystacks, and
other elevated objects seem to conduct lightning rather than ward it off, a
person overtaken by a thunderstorm should never seek shelter near these ; it
is much better to gut wet to the skin than expose one’s self to this danger.
It i« also dangerous to stand near leader spouts, iron gates or pallisades at
such times, metals at all times having so strong a conducting power for
lightning as frequently to lead it out of the course which it would otherwise
have taken. When in the house, avoid sitting or standing near a window or
door; the nearer you are placed towards the centre of the room the better.
—“Our Doctor.”
SUNSTROKE.
All ligatures about the neck and waisr should be removed, and the head
being raised moderately, should be kept cold by wet cloths frequently
renewed, or by ice, or dropping cold water slowly on the head ; and to rouse
the vital energy, half a glass of brandy and water, followed by a cup of tea,
should be given every hour till the patient rallies ; while a mustard plaster
is applied over the stomach, and the feet are kept warm by bags of heated
salt, or heated bricks rolled in flannel. To relieve the system of bile, the
patient should get half a grain of podophylline, with ten grains of Epsom
salts every twelve hours, till the bowels act freely.— “ Fullerton’s Medical
Guide.”
SNAKE BITE.
The first thing to do is, immediately after being bitten, to tie a piece of
whip, or other thin cord, between the wound and the heart. This prevents
the virus going to the heart and being carried into the general circulation.
Secondly, with a lancet or penknife cut clean down to the bottom of the
wound, and let blood flow freely.. Thirdly, suck the wound well. Keep
sucking for half an hour, then get another piece of cord, tie it half an inch or
so higher than the first ligature. You can then loosen the first ligature, and
suck away still —this cleans away all virus; and if you like then to apply a
piece of caustic through the bite aperture and cut, or, what is better, get a
piece of wire—from a porter bottle will do—make this red hot, white heat is
best, thrust it right down to the bottom of the wound; this will do you all
the benefit in the world. If there is any fainting or heavy feeling, take a
nobbier of brandy, and with it a drop of strong ammonia, and add water. If
there is a further depression, continue with brandy and strong coffee.—
“ Our Doctor.”
PERSONS APPARENTLY DROWNED
In these cases there is nothing like acting upon the rules laid down by the
Royal Humane Society. A year or two ago, as may be remembered by our
readers, two youngsters named Gannon, by the prompt application of these
rules (which they had learnt at school) in the instance of a girl apparently
drowned, had the satisfaction of restoring her safe and sound to home and
friends :
I.—Send immediately for medical assistance, blankets and dry clotfiing,
but proceed to treat the patient instantly on the spot, in the open air, with
the face downward, whether on shore or afloat, exposing the face, neck, and
chest to the wind, except in severe weather, and removing all tight clothing


from the neck and chest, especially the braces. The efforts to restore
breathing must be commenced immediately and energetically, and persevered
in for one or two hours. Efforts to promote warmth and circulation, beyond
removing the wet clothes and drying the skin, must not be made until the
first appearance of natural breathing.
II. —To Restore Breathing. —Place the patient on the floor or ground, with
the face downwards, and one of the arms under the forehead, in which
position all fluids will now readily escape by the mouth, and the tongue
itself will fall forward, leaving the entrance into the windpipe free. Assist
this operation by wiping and cleansing the mouth. If satisfactory breathing
commences, use the treatment described below to promote warmth. If there
be only a slight breathing—or no breathing—or if the breathing fail, then
turn the patient, well and instantly on the side, supporting the head, and
excite the nostrils with snuff, hartshorn, and smelling salts, or tickle the
throat with a feather, etc., if they are at hand. Rub the chest and face
warm, and dash cold water, or cold and hot water alternately, on them. If
there be no success, lose not a moment, but instantly replace the patient on
the face, raising and supporting the chest well on a folded coat or other
article of dress. Turn the body very gently on the side and a little beyond, and
then briskly on the face, back again, repeating these measures, continually,
efficiently, and perseveringly, about fifteen times in the minute, or once
every four or five seconds, occasionally varying the side. On each occasion
that the body is replaced on the face, make uniform but sufficient pressure
with movement on the back between and below the shoulder-
blades, or bones on each, side, removing the pressure immediately before
turning the body on the side. During the whole of the operations let one
person attend solely to the movements of the head and the arm placed under
it. Whilst the above operations are being proceeded with, dry the hands
and the feet, and as soon as dry clothing or blankets can be procured,
strip the body and cover or gradually reclothe it, but taking care not to
interfere with the efforts to restore breathing.
Hl.—Treatment after Natural Breathing has been Restored :
Commence rubbing the limbs upwards with firm grasping pressure and
energy, using handkerchiefs, flannels, etc. The friction must be continued
under the blanket or over the dry clothing. Promote the warmth of the
body by the application of hot flannels, bottles, or bladders of hot water,
heated bricks, etc., to the pit of the stomach, the arm-pits, between the
thighs, and to the soles of the feet. If the patient has been carried to a
house after respiration has been restored, be careful to let the air play freely
about the room. On the restoration of life, a teaspoonful of warm water
should be given ; and then, if the power of swallowing having returned,
small quantities of wine, warm brandy and water, or coffee should be ad-
minstered. The patient should be kept in bed, and a disposition to sleep
encouraged. .. . ~ .
General Observations The above treatment should be presevered in tor
some hours, as it is an erroneous opinion that persons are irrecoverable
because life does not soon make its appearance, persons having been restored
after persevering for many hours.
Appearances which generally accompany Death: —Breathing and the heart s
action cease entirely; the eye-lids are generally half closed, the pupils
dilated; the tongue approaches to the under edges of the lips, and these as
well as the nostrils are covered with a frothy mucus. Coldness and palor ot
surface increased. , , ,
Cautions: —Prevent unnecessary crowding of persons round the body,
especially if in an apartment. Avoid rough usage, and do not allow the
body to remain on the back unless the tongue is secured. Under no circum-


stances hold the body up by the feet. On no account place the body in a
warm bath, unless under medical direction, and even then it should only be
employed as a momentary excitant.
BITES OF DOGS.
Rabid Animals—Tie a piece of string between the wound and the heart to
prevent any poison being taken up into circulation, then cut out the part as
soon as possible, or if this is objected to, cauterise it well with a piece of
lunar caustic (nitrate of silver). —“ Our Doctor .”
BEE STINGS.
First Remedy —Examine the injured part narrowly, and if the sting is
discovered protruding from the flesh, pluck it out with a pair of tweezers, or
with two thin pieces of stick pressed tightly together; afterwards bathe the
parts over and near the wound with spirits of hartshorn. Second —Sweet
oil frequently applied with a piece of lint or linen rag. Third— lf the
inflammation is great, and will not subside with either of the above applica-
tions, apply a warm poultice of bread and water, or linseed meal.—“ Our
Doctor .”
MINERAL POISONS.
These are very numerous, but, for our purpose, it is necessary to mention
those only which are more likely to be taken by accident. The acids are
sulphuric, or oil of vitriol; nitric, or aquafortis ; muriatic, or spirit of salt ;
oxalic, or acid of sugar, &c. The symptoms of poisoning by acids are—an
acid, burning taste; severe pain in the throat, stomach, and bowels;
frequent vomiting of black matter, and bloody fluid, which effervesces with
chalk or alkaline carbonates, and reddens litmus paper; hiccough; tenes-
mus ; great tenderness of the abdomen; difficult breathing; irregular
pulse ; excessive thirst, drink increasing the pain, and seldom staying down;
cold sweats ; altered countenance ; convulsions ; and death. When either
of the three first acids in the list have been swallowed, the lips are shrivelled
and discoloured—yellow by nitric acid, and brown by the sulphuric. There
are blisters about the mouth and the internal parts of the throat. Treatment
—lf you have a plaster wall scrape it, and add a tablespoonful or so of the
scrapings to a tumbler of water ; repeat in ten minutes afterwards. Ghalk,
or soap and water, may be employed until magnesia can be procured.
Diluents and demulcents are to be taken after the poison is cleared out. In-
flammatory and other symptoms to be combated as theyappear.—“ Our Doctor .”
The Newspaper as an Educator
(From the Cumberland Mercury.)
Neither the school nor the college nor the University curriculum includes
the “ sum tottle of the whole ” of those subjects, a knowledge of which tends
to fit the “ young idea ” for the intelligent discharge of the nobler duties of
life, to say nothing of the more meagre ones of bare existence.
The doings of the great world (we don’t here mean the fashionable world
of the “upper” two dozen), the careful examination and discussion of the


important questions daily arising in the fields of politics, sociology, industry,
—in a word of the questions daily arising in every department of human
knowledge -these are subjects which Journalism alone can teach. In these,
the newspaper is chief if not sole educator.
Professor “Newspaper” never wants a vacation or leave of absence on
full pay. Right through the year its work goes on. To those who regu-
larly attend and profit by its lectures it gives no grander (nor worse) diploma
than the stamp of superior information on current events - the faculty of a
keen, shrewd grasping of the world’s ways, of intimacy with all those several
methods of thought and action, which are carrying the world forward, and
making it not only materially richer, but morally, and so actually, wiser and
better.
Wherever a good high-toned newspaper regularly reaches, there that
practical education is silently going on, —there pupils are being trained, as
no primary school or college can train them, for the actual stern responsibil-
ities they must soon assume.
The Cumberland Mercury fully appreciating the importance of its own
task in the broad sphere of journalism is earnest in striving to fulfil its
mission faithfully. It seeks on all leading questions to be suggestive. On
some it claims to be an honest guide. Its columns are kept pure. Every
paragraph is carefully edited, and nothing is intentionally admitted which
can instil a hurtful lesson into any mind.
In this way, the Cumberland Mercury hopes to become appreciated as a
practical educator, —trusts to strengthen in those who study its contents an
honest desire for healthy Progress, an ardent love of Country.
Every reader can give some aid in this work by using his or her influence
to place the Cumberland Mercury in homes where it does not now go.
And now is the time when this work can be best done.


Descriptive Account.
Chapter I. —Preliminary.
Let us from some coign of vantage on the Blue Mountains
(choosing a standpoint somewhere in the neighbourhood of Emu),
look down upon the fair, fertile, and populous country that lies
unrolled like a map beneath our feet. Looking down upon the
metropolis set upon the gleaming waters of the “ Beautiful
Harbour, ” or either to right or to left, we shall be able to note
the manifold evidence of that triumphant civilization which, since
Cook first landed in Botany Bay, has made such marvellous
progress in the Great Southern Land. As we gaze upon popu-
lous towns and a smiling champaign, the words of the address
of Australia’s lost laureate to the Muse whose darling it was his
lot to be will rise to our remembrance ;
Here is a land whose large imperial grace
Must tempt thee, Goddess, in thine holy place ;
Here are the dells of peace and plenilune,
The hills of morning and the slopes of noon ;
Here are the waters dear to days of blue
And dark green hollows of the noontide dew.
Yes, here are ail these natural beauties in the course of being
crowned by human industry and skill and made tributary to the
intelligence of man. The wild Australian bush of the days of
Cook has vanished—
Where now the warrior of the forest racf»,
His glaring war paint and his fearless face ?
The gleaming savage and the whistling spear?
Passed with the passing: of a wild old year !
And in lieu of the wild bush and gleaming savage are to be seen
fair cities and cultivated homesteads, the prosperous abodes of
‘‘ lords of humankind. ”
It was in the first year of his government that Governor
Arthur Phillip named the territory immediately surrounding the
infant settlement at Sydney Cove the “ County of Cumberland. ”


The present boundaries (defined October, 1829), are as follows:
On the east by the Pacific (the coast-line extending from Barran-
juie (north) to near Bulli (south); on the north by the Hawkes-
bury (from Wiseman’s Ferry) and Nepean Rivers; on the south
by the Cataract River, and an easterly line from the source of
that stream to Bulli. The metropolis and its immediate suburbs
occupy the peninsula between Port Jackson’s “triad cove” and
the waters of the lower course of George’s River and Botany Bay.
Let us make, in imagination, a voyage along the borders of the
metropolitan county, starting from Bulli, the northern portion of
which important mining township is in Cumberland fthe southern
being in Camden Co.) The Bulli Mining Company’s works are
well worth visiting. There is a fine jetty 450 feet long, at
Bulli, built out into the open sea; from which quite a fleet of
steam, colliers take the produce of the mines to the Sydney and
Melbourne markets. Bulli is also the centre of a thriving
farming district. , Sailing from Bulli, northwards, we pass Cliff-
town a mining village situated on the steep cliffs overhanging the
ocean ; Wattamolla ; Cronulla Beach, at the entrance of Port
Hacking, a deep inlet so-called after Quarter master Henry
Hacking of the frigate “Sirius” and not (as Mr. E. B Wode-
house would have it) after Commander Aitken, who did not
arrive in the colony until long after Port Hacking was a name
well-known to geographers ; capes Solander and Banks (Botany
Bay heads); Coogee and Bondi; Ben Buckler; the heads of
Port Jackson ; Curl-Curl; Narrabeen ; Bulgola ; and Barranjuie
(with its lighthouse) the southern head of Broken Bay, close to
where—
“at rocky Portland's head
Reluctant Hawkeabury quits his sluggish bed,
Merging to ocean. ”
From the mouth of Broken Bay we must now ascend the
Hawkesbury to (again to quote Wentworth) —
—young Windsor’s towers
And Richmond’s high green hills and native bowers,
Thence far along Nepean’s pebbled way
To those green pastures where the wild herds stray,
The crowded farm-house lines the winding stream
On either side, and many a plodding team
With shining ploughshare turns the neigh’bring soil
Which crowns with double crop the labourer’s toil.
Where Warragamba’s rage has rent in twain
Opposing mountains, thundering to the plain.
The native name of the Hawkesbury River is “ Yenrubbin. ”
This noble stream was first discovered by Phillip, and so named


by him (June, 1779) in honor of the nobleman who was then
head of the British Council of Trade and Plantations. The
Hawkesbury is (as we shall see as we continue its ascent) a
continuation of the Nepean from the junction of that river with
the Grose. The total course of the Hawkesbury (navigable to
about Windsor for vessels of 100 tons) is 300 miles, with a total
drainage area of about 9000 square miles. The Nepean rise* in
the County of Camden north of Berrima, and flows through a
rich agricultural district into (he Hawkesbury. The Warragamba,
whose waters are contributed by the Wollondilly (flowing from
the south) a few miles north-west of Camden. The Grose rises in
the Blue Mountains, and flows through a vast chasm into the
Hawkesbury ; its valley is one of the wildest and most romantic
grandeur. The Colo with its affluents, the Wolgan, Wollangbe,
Wollemi, and Wheeny, rises in the Blue Mountains, and flows
into the Hawkesbury. The Macdonald empties itself into the
Hawkesbury opposite Wiseman’s Ferry, and a few miles below
the pleasantly situated township of St. Albans. The Hawkesbury
is terribly liable to floods. One of the most destructive on record
occurred in 1806, by which the infant colony was almost reduced
to a state of famine, wheat rising to £4 per bushel and the 2ib.
loaf to ss. There was another terrible flood in 1867.
Having thus generally described the basin of the Hawkesbury
and its tributaries we are ready for another start; and yet, ere
doing so, it may be as well to speak of the fishes of these streams.
There is the “perch” (lates colonorum) frequently found in salt
water; item , the mullet (mugil dobula), which when arrived at
years of discretion pays an annual visit to the sea ; item , the eel
(anguilla Australis), that also once a year makes for the “ briny ”;
item , the herring (meletta Novae Hollaudiae), a delicious morsel
and very good sport. A species of Apogon, several kinds of
Eleotris and a Centropogon are to be got in the Nepean and other
tributaries of the Hawkesbury. Mountain trout, as a certain
scaleless cylindrical fish of 8 or 10 inches in length are called, are
found in the cold waters of the upper creeks of the Blue Moun-
tains. They are especially good eating.
We will now proceed on our voyage from Broken Bay up the
Hawkesbury. Owing to its broken fortunes, the estuary of the
Hawkesbury is quite lakelike in its character ; for beauty its
scenery cannot be surpassed by any of the historic streams of
older lands. The names of many of the islands, inlets, etc.,
are sadly out of harmony with the poetic ideas which their
loveliness cannot fail to evoke from the gentle lover of Nature.
Babbit Island is suggestive rather of pie than poetry, while
Mullet Creek, which enters the river a little to the north of it,
has a muddier sound than its mountain origin should put up


with. Long Island and Spectacle Island lie at the mouth of
Mooney Mooney Creek, which joins the river from the north.
Along the western hank of this creek runs the continuation of
Peat’s Ferry road (from Sydney) to Newcastle (or Maitland) the
Ferry plying across the river a nr.le or so to the north of Long
Island. The above road before it reaches the river on the Cum-
berland side runs through a peninsula formed by Cowan’s and
Berowa Creeks which run northerly from their sources on the
northern slope of the Pennant Hills into the Hawkesbury.
Beyond the Ferry is Mud Island, and further on the mouth of
Mangrove Creek, which, rising in the ranges crossed by the old
Northern road via Wollombi, empties the drainage of a vast
area into the Hawkesbury.
All the “corner” (or angle) allotments in the bends and angles
of this beautiful stream, suitable for agricultural purposes, have
long ago been “selected” hence as the tourist sails or steams
along, his eye is every while enchanted with pleasant peeps of
homestead and flower garden, farm and meadow, that nestle
cosily in the “ wrinkles of the monstrous hills.”
Some twelve miles further up the river than the mouth of
Mangrove Creek is Wiseman’s Ferry. This township is on the
overland route from Sydney to Maitland or Newcastle via
Wollombi. From the sandstone heights above the village the
view is perfectly magnificent. The point whence the Ferry
works is the apex of an immense triangle of which the river,
here most majestic in its course forms two sides. On the
opposite side are seen the mouths of Macdonald Piver and
Webb’s Creek ; the strip of alluvial bottom which fringes the
stream ; and, above, 'are massed the mighty cliffs, like Cyclopean
walls, tawny and grey, seamed with purple and flecked with
light, smiling in the sunshine or grimly scowling beneath a
cloudy sky. The township itself is an improvable spot; enter-
prise might make of it a charming watering place. The dilapi-
dated old Anglican Church, a world too wide for its shrunk
congregation (but about to be repaired) speaks of a time when
Wiseman’s Ferry was a lively place on a lively road, ere steam-
boats usurped the Hunter River traffic, and when the inn was
occupied by old Solomon Wiseman, who, as tradition says, made
a large fortune as Government contractor, farmer, and hotel-
keeper. His tomb is in the church. The northern line of
telegraph crosses the Hawkesbury at Wiseman’s. The Ferry,
which is in the centre of a large farm population, is much
frequented by cattle drovers en route to Homebush with northern
beeves. A few miles beyond Wiseman’s Ferry and the junction
of the Macdonald with the Hawkesbury we reach the mouth of
the Colo. Some nine miles further up is the conspicuous rock


called Portland Head, with the settlement of Sackville Reach
on the opposite side of the river. Hardly anything can exceed
the loveliness of the view from Portland Head ; but it marks the
limits of the beautiful river scenery, since shortly after leaving
Sackville Reach the character of the view changes—alluvial
plains being substituted for the steep woodland and rocky hill
which form the features of either bank of the lower waters.
Halfway between Sackville Reach and the junction of the Grose
ace the river towns of Windsor, Richmond, and Pitt Town.
Windsor (34 miles N. W. of Sydnej) was originally known as
“ The Green Hills : ” it is the chief town of perhaps the richest
agricultural district of the colony—a district, however, liable to
floods. The town contains several fine buildings. Charles Harpur
(born 1812, died 1868) was a native of Windsor. St. Matthew’s
Church was opened in 1822, the foundation stone having been
laid by Governor Macquarie in 1819. Windsor was for some
years an assize town. The bridge across the Hawkesbury was
opened in 1874. There is comfortable hotel accomodation to be
obtained in Windsor. Mr. Fuller, the proprietor of the Cum-
b eel and Meecuey, started the Hawkesbuey Cheonicle in 1881.
It is published at Stationees’ Hall, Windsor.
Richmond (so named 18it)), 4 miles further up the Hawkes-
bury than Windsor, is a pleasant little township. On the
opposite side of the river are Kurrajong (on Wheeny’s Creek)
and Kurrajong Heights (or Northfield). Northfield, situated on
a spur of the Blue Mountains, commands an enchanting view,
glimpses being obtainable therefrom of Mounts Hay, Wilson,
To in ah, and King George, with in the far distance the cliffs of
Govett’s leap. Raspberries and gooseberries flourish here, the
climate being sufficiently “ English.” It is a place of consi-
derable resort as a sanitorium. Richmond is the residence of
the Rev. Dr. Woolls, the distinguished Australian botanist,
whose author! dve works on the flora of New South Wales
have just been republished at Stationees’ Hall, 385 and 387,
George-street, Sydney.
Pitt Town , 4 miles further down the Hawkesbury than
Windsor, is the centre of a thriving agricultural district, the
Pitt Town “bottoms” being celebrated for their extreme fer-
tility. On the opposite side of the river is Wilherforce, centre
of another extraordinarily rich district, but low lying and
subject to floods.
At Clarendon , half-way between Richmond and Windsor, is
the fine racecourse of the Hawkesbury Racing Club.
The waters voyaged upon after leaving the mouth of the
Grose are known as “ the Nepean.” Since of the lower Nepean,


of the beauties and the townships of its immediate district, we
shall speak at length in a subsequent chapter, we will now say
no more than that we pass Penrith, Emu, the mouths of the
Mulgoa and the Warragamba en route to Cobbity and Camden,
classic site of the “ Cowpastures.”
Elanagan relates that early in 1788 the infant colony of New
South Wales suffered a severe loss in the straying away of the
whole of the horned cattle, namely four cows and two bulls. In
1795 Governor Hunter, in one. of his explorations, having
crossed the Nepean, fell in with some forty head of wild cattle,
which on examination proved to be the progeny of the “lost
tribe.” Subsequently in 1799, Governor Hunter revisited the
spot, and discovered near it a large extent of country highly
suitable for agricultural and pastoral purposes. In 1803, when
Mr. John Macarthur was instructed by Lord Camden (then in
charge of the Colonial Department) to devote himself to the
experiment of fine wool-growing, it was ordered that he should
receive a grant of 10,000 acres. Asked to select where the
grant should be, he chose the “cow-pastures” on the Nepean,
and called them “ Camden.”
Camden, a fairly prosperous town, is the centre of a rich
farming (dairying and cattle-breeding) district. Its vineyards
are famous (noteably those of Camden Park, the seat of the
Macarthurs). Camden is reached from Campbelltown by tram.
About half-way on the road between Camden and Picton is
“Razorback,” a terribly steep “pinch,” as many a bullock
driver in early days knew to his cost. On the Nepean, in the
vicinity of Camden, are several fine seats, notably “Nepean
Towers,” the property of Dr. Jenkins.
Campbelltown , on the Great Southern Railway, is 31 miles
S. Wof Sydney. The district surrounding it is an agricultural
one, but rust has played great havoc with the farmers of late
years. Campbelltown is a very old settlement. It was marked
out and named by Governor Macquarie in 1820. Mt. Gilead,
Mr. Woodhouse’s stud station, is near Campbelltown. The first
Circuit Court was here opened in 1832 with great ceremony by
Chief Justice Forbes. It is not, however, an assize town now.
From Campbelltown there is mail coach communication with
Bulli via Appin, a pleasantly situated village near the source of
George’s River.
And so we have worked round to Bulli, our “point of com-
mencement.” Within the line thus traversed Parramatta is the
centre —the navel of Cumberland County. Branching from
Parramatta are the main high roads and railroads that intersect
those portions of the county of which our Year Book mainly
treats.


The main roads (other than those restricted to the use of the
“ iron horse ”) are these :
From Sydney via Manly to Pitt water, thence across mouth of
Hawkesbury to Gosford; from Sydney via Lane Cove to Peat’s
Ferry, thence across the Hawkesbury to Wollombi, Maitland,
etc. ; from Sydney via Lane Cove and Pennant Hills to Wise-
man’s Ferry, across the Hawkesbury. From Sydney via Parra-
matta to Windsor and Richmond. From SydneyParramatta
to Penrith : this road runs almost due west. From Sydney via
Parramatta to Narellan and Camden (Old Cowpasture Road.)
From Sydney via Liverpool to Campbelltown, thence southwards
to Picton, Berrima, etc., or eastwards to Appin and Bulli. From
Sydney via Kogara (the Illawarra Road) to Bulli, Wollongong,
Illawarra Lake, Riama, etc.
The Liverpoool Road branches from the last mentioned road at
the mill on the Sydney side of Ashfield, and taking a more
southerly direction passes through the town of Ashfield ; thence
across the head waters of Cook’s River by Irishtown and Banks-
town to the road from Parramatta to Liverpool which it joins
near the bridge across Prospect Creek.
The Parramatta Road runs almost due westerly from Sydney,
leaving Redfern and Newtown to the left, through Camperdown
the outskirts of Ashfield (to its left), those of Five Dock (to its
right), Longbottom, Homebush, and so, crossing Haslem’s
Creek and Duck River, to Parramatta.
The Great South Railway line goes south-westerly from Parra-
matta via Liverpool and Campbelltown.
The Great Western Railway line runs from Parramatta almost
due west via Blacktown, St. Mary’s and Penrith. The to Rich-
mond line, branching off from the western line at Blacktown,
proceeds in a north-westerly course via Riverstone and Windsor
to its terminus.
The Great Northern line, so far as its track is to lie in Cum-
berland County, will run as under : From Homebush to a cross-
ing of the Parramatta River, two miles above South-Hythe,
and by the head of Lane Cove to the Peat’s Ferry Road, thence
to a crossing of the Lower Hawkesbury at Dangar Island to
Brisbane Water.
The line of the Sydney water supply works (now in course of
construction) from the head waters to the Prospect Reservoir, near
Parramatta, is 41 miles. At the “ Pheasant’s Nest ” just below
the junction of the Upper Nepean and Cordeaux Rivers (425
feet above the level of the sea and 63 miles from Sydney), those
streams, united, are to be dammed, raised 10 feet and diverted
to the extent of 10,000,000 gallons a day into the “ Nepean


Tunnel,” which is being opened through the sandstone hills of
north-eastern Camden to Broughton’s Pass (on the borders of
Camden and Cumberland Counties.) At Broughton’s Pass, at a
height of 421 feet over the sea, the tunnel waters will join those
of the Cataract Piver. Across this a second dam will be erected,
and divert the united waters of the three rivers into another
tunnel, called the Cataract Tunnel, 10 feet 6 inches by 3 feet 6
inches to the mile. This tunnel will be likewise through sand-
stone rock, the greatest depth of which will be 250 feet below
the hill country through which it is pierced. After a course of
one and a quarter mile through this second tunnel, the water
emerges on the western slopes of the main dividing range sepa-
rating the waters of the Nepean from those of Greorge’s Piver.
Thence it will be conducted in an open conduit, with short
occasional tunnels, to a place from the Pheasant’s Nest dam.
A tunnel, 3300 yards in length will then carry the water through
the Dividing Range. At the 41st mile from the Pheasant’s
Nest the water will be diverted into the Prospect reservoir.
The Works from Prospect to Sydney are described as follows
in the explanatory report of the late Mr. Clarke : ‘ ‘ This reser-
voir (at Prospect) will be formed by the construction of a dam,
having a length of about 108 chains and a maximum heighth of
80 feet. Its area when full will be 1291 acres, and contents
10,635 milhon gallons, of which the upper 25 feet would be
available for distribution in Sydney, and contain 7,110 million
gallons. The level of the top water would be 195 feet over sea,
and 170 feet when drawn down 25 feet. From the storage
reservoir the water will be conducted by an open conduit for a
distance of 4 miles 58 chains, when it will be carried on by an
iron aqueduct for a distance of 7986 feet to 48 miles, 64 chains.
At the end of this aqueduct, at 48 miles 64 chains, and 14 miles
from Sydney, a small reservoir is to be constructed, capable of
holding 400,000 gallons. The next construction is a syphon
pipe, 48 inches in diameter, crossing the valley through which
Duck Creek flows ; it is a depression of about 100 feet, and the
length of this syphon pipe is 4628 yards, capable of conveying
14f million gallons in 24 hours. From this point the water is
again conveyed for a distance of 1 mile 37 chains in an open
conduit to 52 miles 73 chains, where a small storage reservoir is
to be formed by an earthen embankment. Here the water will
be delivered at an elevation of 164 feet over sea level; and here
also commences the pipe, 42 inches in diameter, which is to
convey the water to Sydney. Its length is 10 miles, and it will
be capable of delivering daily 12 million gallons into the Crown
Street Reservoir. At Petersham it is proposed to construct a
reservoir capable of containing 800,000 gallons for the supply of


that suburb. By this arrangement instead of a continuous
length of piping from Prospect, the larger carrying capacity of
the open conduit enables a supply of nearly 29 million gallons
daily to be brought to a point 14 miles distant from Sydney, and
84 million gallons to within 20f miles, at which place provision
is made for a storage of 7,110 million gallons,”

And now having briefly touched on the main county features,
outside of those which appertain more strictly to the districts of
Parramatta, Central Cumberland, and the Nepean, we will pro-
ceed to speak more in detail of those districts severally, classi-
fying our remarks under the following headings : ‘ ‘ Parramatta
and Suburbs;” ‘‘Central Cumberland: Pyde and Liverpool
Divisions;” “The Nepean: Penrith, St. Mary’s, etc.”


Chapter 11.
Parramatta and Suburbs.
Flanagan narrates in his History of New South Wales that
Governor Phillip in one of his first expeditions from the
settlement at Sydney Cove, ‘ ‘ discovered a spot at the head of
“ Port Jackson which appeared well adapted for cultivation, and
“to this place, which he named 'Rose Hill, he despatched a
“party consisting of a captain, two lieutenants of marines, and
“twenty-five non-commissioned officers and privates, together
“ with fifty convicts, with a view of cultivating a farm and form-
“ ing a settlement there.” Such was the introduction of Parra-
matta (in aboriginal phrase “long where eels sit down”) to
civilization, as represented by a British settlement.
Since that day of very small things Parramatta (the name of
Pose Hill was dropped in 1791) has thriven exceedingly.
To-day she is the chief town of the non-metropolitan portion of
the County of Cumberland, nearly in the navel of which she is
set, alike the focus of the main railway lines and great high-
ways, and the centre of the fruit-growing district ‘of the Colony.
Parramatta is a parliamentary and municipal borough of consi-
derable historic interest. Here was the country residence of the
early governors. Here (or at least in its immediate vicinity)
John Macarthur initiated the crossing of hair-bearing ewes with
sheep of England breed ere he introduced the merinos presented
birri by George 111 to the sweet pastures of the Nepean. Here
Marsden—minister, missionary, magistrate, laboured. Here
was born Batman, the founder of Yictoria, and Hamilton Hume,
the explorer, who, in 1824, made the first overland journey to
Port Phillip. Here too lived many another historic celebrity (of
whom more anon.)
Parramatta strikes the visitor most favourably when her roofs
and spires and old stone bridge first meet the eye. She looks
like a home of peace. She seems neither to effect pride nor ape
humility, but to be full of “the sweet calm that is just between.”
She possesses an air of ancientry, and poses (not without grace)
as a matronly city. Undoubtedly she owes much of her outward
seeming to her churches. St. John’s is very nearly being an
excessively fine building. Had the towers (built in exact resem-
blence of the towers of Peculver Church, Kent, at the cost of
Mrs. John Macarthur, in fulfilment of a vow made as she left
“the Downs” on her return to her adopted land) —had the


towers of St. John’s only been designed in keeping with the
main pile, the church would certainly deserve to rank as an
architectural “lion.” The Norman style, admirably preserved
in the aisles and nave, especially in the porch and aisle windows
and clerestory, is marred by the stuccoed towers with their
miserable perforations (meant to act as windows) and their still
more miserable quoins. At night, though, when St. John’s
presents itself to the eye en masse, grey and sombre, its general
effect may fairly be called grand; and if at such a time, it
chances that the organ is pealing forth some noble voluntary,
the casements glowing from within with “dim religious light,”
he who gazes upon the then all noble scene must fain acknow-
ledge the enchantment of the view. St. John’s is about to
undergo considerable enlargement and improvements. Two
transepts providing extra accommodation for some 250 persons,
are to be added.
All Saints’ Church, North Parramatta, is a graceful gothic
structure, from whose lofty spire-crowned belfry a musical peal
of mellow bells
Through the balmy air of night
Oft ring out their delight.
St. Patrick’s (R.C.) and the Congregational Church, which
are well placed for effect, possess considerable architectural
merit, which is more than can honestly be said of the other
religious edifices of Parramatta. The graceful new spire of St.
Patrick’s is a prominent landmark. On October 28th, 1882,
the Baptist Church was reopened after having been closed for
some months, for repairs which had been necessitated by an
explosion of gas.
The quaint Government buildings of the Macquarie epoch
(notably the main portion of the District Hospital, the erysipe-
las Hospital, and the George-street Benevolent Asylum), con-
tribute to the beforementioned air of ancientry, which sits so
pleasantly on Parramatta. They are ugly, but though ugly,
interesting by their associations ; since they help to carry back
the mind to the days of pigtails, shirt frills, and hessian boots—
to the Georgian days, when British redcoats affected a Revolu-
tion by deposing an unpopular governor—to the long ago time
of holy dollars and a rum currency.
Parramatta is well supplied with schools, public and private.
The King’s School gives a tone to the town. It is a useful
institution with an honorable history. Glancing from the Park
at the buildings of the School, backed as they are by spire of
church and wealth of foliage, and fronted by the gleaming
river, one recalls to mind Gray’s lines written in view of a
famous English college to rival which in fair historic fame may


it be the lot of the King’s School! Yes !itis no stretch of fancy
to deem these lines appropriate to the scene. When the play-
ground by the river is gay with young and frolic life, and a
view is caught of
the distant spires
The antique (?) towers that crown the watery glade,
the ex-schoolboy’s mind “harks back” with regret to school-
time’s
Thoughtless day, the early night
The spirit pure the slumbers light,
That fly the approach of day.
Parramatta Park is a charming place. In speaking of its
avenue one cannot talk of immemorial oaks. Eather are they
memorial ones. Many a shady seat-retired haunt for lovers —
doth the Park boast—seats above which
solemn oak tree sigheth
Thick-leaved ambrosial
With an ancient melody
Of an inward agony.
Yes! Parramatta Park hath many charms — such are its
groves of oak, it masses of pine, its picturesque lake and (on its
outskirts) the glossy gold-spangled greenery of orange orchards,
like golden lamps in green of night;
blending the soft witchery of the south with the sternness of
the north —charms that are each and all “ beautiful exceedingly.”
“ Old Government House,” now a boarding establishment
alas, how are the mighty fallen !—is in the inner domain. Ay !
di me! vanitas vanitatum ! the staff that once bore royally the
royal standard with its rich heraldic blazonry—harp of Erin,
leopards of England, and Scotland’s “ ruddy lion rampant on
its field of tressured gold,” now simply serves to indicate where
board and residence can be had on reasonable terms.
The number of very old men, pensioners on the State bounty,
whom one meets in and about Parramatta, gives a peculiar tone
to street life. They are the sad relics of an earlier time, men
who have borne the heat and burden of the day of pioneer colo-
nisation-unfortunates, who from their labours in clearing the
bush and redeeming the waste places have reaped no further
profit than an old age of pauperism. Even if the fault
be theirs, let us not grudge them their refuge, nor refuse an
occasional plug of tobacco to soothe an old man s troubles.
The Church of England Cemetry in O’Connell-street is an
interesting spot of earth to visit. It is not without a certain air
of the picturesque. Here rest the remains of Elizabeth, wife of


Sir Richard Bourke, the foremost governor on the roll of Austra-
lian viceroys. All that was mortal of the good Lady Mary (wife
of Sir Charles Fitzroy, some time governor of New South Wales)
who was thrown from her carriage in Parramatta Park (in the
entrance avenue), on the 7th December, 1847, and killed almost
instantaneously, once rested here also. Her remains are now
entombed in England, whither they were removed some years
back. The identical tree (then a sapling) against which Lady
Mary’s carriage was dashed is now gnarled and bent. It is just
inside the Greorge-street gate, and is marked with an X.
Parramatta may fairly be considered an industrial centre.
The whirr of factory wheels and the din of hammers swell
the volume of sound that goes up from her streets. Her tweeds
have long had an extra-colonial reputation. First-class agricul-
tural implements are turned out wholesale by Parramatta firms.
Then there are quieter (and to some minds more poetical) indus-
tries practised in the neighbourhood.
There are celebrated orange orchards and nursery gardens,
the deserved fame of which is daily spreading wider and wider.
The camellias are the floral glories of Parramattan gardens.
What the rose is to England, the thistle to Scotland, the sham-
rock to Erin, the lily and violet to France, the camellia will yet
be to Parramatta—its heraldic “ charge.”
The upper reaches of the Parramatta River requires a poet-
artist to do them full justice. They possess a quite peculiar
beauty—a beauty neither grand, nor wild, or impetuous, nor
(on the other hand) soft or limpid. Their beauty is of a quiet
subdued, serene, yet mysterious character ; a beauty that derives
nothing from vividness of colour, from noble irregularity of out-
line, or from old historic associations. The prevading tone of
river scenery is sombre green, yet so intermixed is the play of
its light and shade that its sombreness never grows monotonous.
The prevailing colour of its water is also sombre, a greyish
green, melting here into dense darkness and there into gleaming
white. The mangroves which line the banks present in the
contour of their foliage masses nothing but soft curves; and yet
so ever changingly fantastic are their gnarled trunks and limbs
that they fail to weary the eye. As the steamer palpitates along
the stream, the ripples in its wake as they break on the shining
strand (which in some places creeps down from the shade of the
mangroves to the kiss of the water) repay the patient observance
of any one possessed of an artist’s temperament and a poet’s
hopes and fancies. Journeying down the river, one comes
across many exquisite bits of scenery well worthy of record in a
painter’s sketch-book. From just below the salt works at New-
ington, there is a charming view of Ryde—its church (St.


Anne’s), set on tlie crest of the hills so that it cannot he hid,
with the roof of its houses framed in foliage, forming a noble
background: and for foreground a sunlit expanse of river reach
edged with mangroves, half in shadow and half quivering in
light —with peradventure a fruit craft beating up stream, her
dark sail and black hull contrasting bravely with the azure of
the sky and the bright stillness of the water. There is also
a pretty “bit” near Ermington—background, soft timber-
covered ridges of hill: mid-distance, several clearances laid
down in wheat or barley (in spring time vivid as emerald) and
studded here and there with sheltered homesteads : foreground,
a wharf, washed by the rippling river, with two or more craft
moored alongside, their crews lazily taking in cargo, red boxes
of oranges, or bricks from the ruddy kiln which bluffs up so
aesthetically against the sweep of the green of the upland,
crowned with the promise of harvest.
Of late the Parramatta Elver has been full of sea nettles.
Those mysterious denizens of the great deep (order, Akalephe),
are interesting objects of observation, with their convex discs,
mushroom-like heads, and lower fringe of gracefully shaped
suckers. It is marvellous how such frail, gelatinous, half-fluid
formations can stand the rock and surge of ocean, or how they
can make their way up stream by a motion caused by mere con-
traction and dilation. Although these medusce destroy the fishing
grounds, they afford protection from the cormorants to the fish
who lie amongst their shoals.
So much for a general summary of Parramatta’s most promi-
nent features. We will now proceed to more detailed description
commencing with an account of the important fruit district of
which the “historic borough” is the centre. Our account is
taken almost verbatim from an able paper prepared for the
purposes of the Sydney International Exhibition, by the late
Mr. Geo. H. M‘Colley
The Parramatta Fruit district extends over an area, in round
numbers, of four thousand acres, scattered about in orchards of
from two to fifty acres each, in many cases widely separated from
each other. The orange and summer fruit orchards are clustered
more closely together in the elevated lands of Baulkham Hills,
Castle Hill, Pennant Hills, Seven Hills, and the environs of
Parramatta. On the Domain side west and south from these
localities the orchards are widely separated. From the Western
Eoad to the southern boundary of the district, the orange culture
gives way greatly to vinegrowing and the raising of summer
fruit-. The reason of this is to be found in the fact that the
orange does not, as a rule, thrive well in the low-lying lands
south of the Western Eoad. With a few exceptions, the orange


in this part of the district looks poor and stinted ; but the best
and healthiest of them cannot vie in size and fruitfulness with
the splendid specimens that are grown on the ridges north and
west of Parramatta. There is a vast difference, too, in the
quality of the fruit. That which is grown on the hilly side is
more luscious, and the rind is thinner, while that which is grown
on the southern side is more acid, thicker in the rind and longer
in ripening. The causes to which this difference in the health
of the trees and the quality of the trees may be attributed, are
the situation and the nature of the soil. The land south of the
Prospect Hills is low-lying, and the soil, with the exception of
the creek banks, is of a more tenacious and sour nature than that
which is to be found on the northern side of the district. The
soil on the creek banks, especially on the Prospect Creek, is a
very deep, moderately rich, reddish ash-coloured loam of a rather
sandy texture. This soil, when well-drained, is highly suitable
for vine culture and the growing of summer fruit. The orange
tree grows well in it, and gains a fair size, but the lowness of
the situation prevents the fruit from attaining the same high
quality that distinguishes the fruit grown on the warm slopes on
the northern side. The area of this creek land is of course very
limited ; and all the rest of the country stretching away towards
Blacktown and Seven Hills consists of a more or less tenacious
loam, upon a yellow or white clay sub-soil. Patches of good,
moderately-deep soil, alternate with strips of poor yellow soil,
until after crossing the Western Poad; from this out to
Seven Hills and Blacktown, the loam becomes more sandy, and
the subsoil is a red friable clay. All through Seven Hills
Baulkham Hills and Castle Hill, the soil is a light easily pul-
verised loam, overlaying shale, friable red clay, and in some
instances soft sandstone rock. Standing upon the higher parts
of Castle Hill a very fine view of the whole district can be
obtained, and here it can easily be seen, what a difference exists
between the northern and western sides. Here, at sunrise, it is
warm and delightful, but as you look southward, you see the
whole of the low-lying plain stretching away to Greorgels Piver,
enveloped in a white chilly mist. The situation of this land is
alone sufficient to account for the backwardness of the orange
culture in the southern parts of the district. The boundaries of
the district visited are as follows :—From Parramatta to Pennant
Hills wharf; thence to Mr. P. Terry’s, and along Field of Mars
Common to Dural, to Pouse Hill; thence to Eastern Creek
through Prospect by Lansdowne Bridge to the Sydney Poad,
Pookwood. The whole of this district embraces at a rough
estimate about 144 square miles ; out of this about 2500 acres
are devoted to orange culture; 1200 acres of apples, pears,


peaches, &c. ; and 300 acres to grape vines. It will be seen from
these figures that an immense scope is left for the further
development of the fruit-growing industry. The bulk of the
orange culture must of necessity remain with the northern
and elevated portions of the district: but there is plenty
of opening for vine-growing in all the other parts. As a profit-
able crop the orange takes the precedence; but the soil and the
situation are a sine qua non. In the grape culture the soil and
situation are not so important as good cultivation and thorough
drainage, and the returns are quicker if not so large. The
average return is between 40 and 50 lbs. per acre in well-
cultivated vine-yards and it is certain that a much larger return
might be obtained by a closer attention to good wine-making.
At present about 25,000 gallons of wine are made annually in
the district, some of which will bear very favourable comparison
with the South Australian wines. The bulk of this quantity is
made at the Minchinbury vineyard, the property of Dr. M‘Kay,
on the Western Road.
LOCAL JOURNALISM.
When the editor of a Yankee newspaper was asked by a
stranger how it was that his town kept four newspapers, he made
reply :—“ Well! its rather the other way, I guess. Its the four
newspapers that keep up the town.” So, Parramatta is kept up
by three journals, the Cumberland Mercury, the “ Cumberland
Independent,” and the “ Cumberland Times.”
The centre of activity is
THE CUMBERLAND MERCURY OFFICE.
This edifice (opened for business in July 1881) has frontages, 76
feet to Church-street, and 100 feet to Macquarie-street. The
front elevations are imposing, and strike the beholder as eviden-
cing simplicity, combined with strength. In style, classical
Italian has been followed as closely as compatible with modern
ideas of business frontages. All the rooms of the building are
lofty, being 13 feet from floor to ceiling. From Church-street
corner, along the whole frontage to Macquarie-street, the interior
of the edifice is devoted to the offices of the Mercury, and the
printing business connected therewith. On the ground floor is
the machine-room, 40 feet by 33 feet, paved in part with extra
heavy dressed stone flagging, the remainder of the room being
paved with asphalt. Conspicuous amongst the printing, guil-
lotining, and other machinery, is one of Dawson and Son’s two-
feeder Wharf dales, capable of printing over 3000 Mercury s per
hour. Two flights of stairs lead to the composing-room on the
second story, and we stand in a magnificent, lofty apartment, 85


feet by 23, filled with printers’ frames, type, cases, and all the
paraphernalia of the ancient profession, whilst along the walls
are ranged “ job type” and other things connected with that
excellent printing work turned out at Fuller’s “ Lightning ”
Steam Printing Works. Enamelled reflectors throw down a
brilliant light on the printers from several gas jets ranged over-
head, while numerous windows ventilate the room. At the
eastern end is a large room for the storage of paper, etc., fitted
with shelves, lifts and other appliances. To the west are the
offices of the proprietor, the editor, the sub-editor, and a staff of
reporters.
On the ground floor at the corner of the site of the “Mercury”
Office, is
STATIONERS’ HALL,
commanding entrances from Macquarie and Church Streets, the
locale of Mr. Fuller’s extensive stationery and bookselling
business formerly carried on in George street. The name of the
establishment was selected by the rule of “ contrairies ,” since the
business conducted there never stands still.
Immediately adjoining Stationers’ Hall, and in the same
block of Mercury Buildings are the establishments of Messrs.
Mason and Stapleton, drapers; of W. Clarke, jeweller; of
R. Benson, high class tailoring establishment; W. G. Bladon,
chemist; and T. M. Shepherd, boot bazaar. Mr. Ellis was the
architect, and Mr. H. Coates, junior, the builder of the Mercury
Buildings.
HISTORIC CELEBRITIES.
John Batman, the founder of Victoria, was born in the “historic
borough ” in 1800.
Hamilton Hume, the explorer, who first “ overlanded it ” to
Port Phillip, was also a native of Parramatta, having been born
in 1797.
It was at Elizabeth Farm, near Parramatta, that “ the Father
of the Colony,” John Macarthur, initiated (about 1794) the
crossing of hair bearing ewes with sheep of English breed : it
was there that his sons James and William (late Sir William)
were born, and his son Edward, (the late Lieutenant-General
Sir Edward Macarthur) spent his early days.
It is in Parramatta that Samuel Marsden, the Missionary,
lies buried beneath the shadow of St. John’s.
It was in Parramatta that the Rev. Dr. Woolls, resided whilst
laying the foundation of that botanical fame which is now
world-wide.


It was in Parramatta that the astronomers, Rumker and
Dunlop, worked in the observatory which Governor Brisbane
had erected in the Domain in 1821.
It was at Parramatta that Cealy, the botanist and ornitholo-
gist, fixed his head quarters whilst collecting flora for Sir Joseph
Banks, and native Australian birds on his own account.
It was at Parramatta that Palph Mansfield, the originator of
the measures for lighting Sydney with gas, died.
It was in Parramatta that Michael Fitzpatrick, the faithful
and honest politician, was born.
The Kev. John Watsford, born December, 1820, was also a
native of Parramatta.
Beniamin Lee, the gallant Worcestershire dragoon, who was
with Wellington at Talavera, Ciudad Rodrigo, Salamanca,
Puentes D’Onoro, and Badajoz, and who, in America, had been
present at the battle of New Orleans, lived in Parramatta for
close on half a century.
Here, too, a less worthy character—George Barrington —saun-
tered away the last years of his notorious existence. It was to
this literary pickpocket that the first warrant of emancipation
was issued" in 1792. From his work on New South Wales a
few extracts may prove interesting. We therefore subjoin some,
premising that the title of the book is—“ The History of New
South Wales, including Botany Bay, etc. By G. Barrington,
London, 1802.” In his ‘‘plan” of the “ beautiful and fertile
island of New South Wales ” Prospect Hill occupies a conspicu-
ous place. He calls the blacks a “nation of naked savages.”
He speaks of the “Crescent” redoubt having been built in
November, 1878, at the head of the cove at Rosehill, Parra-
matta. He relates how, on Christmas day, 1789, “a 26-lb
cabbage was cut at Pose Hill.” Mr. Barrington tells us that in
July, 1790, Governor Phillip “laid out the land for a town at
Rose Hill,” that in February, 1791, “there was a great heat at
Rose Hill; the birds falling dead ” : that on June 4, 1791, Rose
Hill was renamed Parramatta: that in August of the same
year, “ the Governor placed 12 convicts in farms at the foot of
Prospect Hill and 15 at the Ponds, two miles N.E, from Parra-
matta.”
The following references to early events are culled from
various sources:—
In early times the Parramatta blacks were very troublesome,
and fighting betwixt them and the white settlers was a constant
thing between the years 1796 and 1816. In May of the last'
named year a proclamation was issued to the effect that an
annual friendly conference should be held with the aborigines on
the 28th December. Several conferences were accordingly held


at Parramatta, the last by Governor Darling on January 16, 1830.
The first free settlers in the district were Philip Schaeffer,
superintendent of convicts, and Robert Webb and William
Reid, marines, who each on the 30th March, 1791, received
grants of land “on the north side of creek leading to Parra-
matta.” Schaeffer “swopped” his land for a similar area at
Pittwater, getting 20 gallons of rum for “ boot.” The Pitt water
grant went “in drink,” and Schaeffer died in the Benevolent
Asylum.
The first Australasian volunteers were the Sydney and Parra-
motta Loyal Associate Corps, temporarily formed in consequence
of a rumoured outbreak among political piisoners in 1800.
Captain James Thompson commanded the Parramatta contingent
of this corp, the commander of which was William Balmain.
In 1860 a Parramatta Rifle Corps (now defunct) was formed
under Captain W. Brown. Camp colours were presented to the
corps in February, 1861.
The first shop in Parramatta was opened on February 26th,
1791, in what is now lower George-street.
The first harvest gathered in New South Wales was reaped
near “ Wentworthville,” Parramatta (Ro«e Hill), in December,
1789.
The first fair ever held in New South Wales took place at
Parramatta, on March 11th, 1813. It attracted a large number
of visitors.
The first grape vine planted in Australia was set in Parra-
mattan soil, doubtless to the accompaniment of Brennus’s
song:—
O ! take care to treat well the fair guest,
From the troubles of blight to protect her;
Of your hill sides, the sunniest and best
Make them hers for the sake of her nectar.
She shall nurse your “ corn stalks” with her juice;
Give life to your arts in libation ;
While your ships round the globe shall produce
Her goblet of joy for the nations ;
The immigrant, snug by your hearth,
She shall soothe, all his sorrows redressing,
For the vine is the parent of mirth,
And to sit in its shade is a blessing.
In July, 1802, the Governor proclaimed that the “districts of
Parramatta, Bankstown, Prospect Hill, Toongabbie, Seven Hills,
Castle Hill, Eastern Farms, Field of Mars, Northern Boundary
Ponds, and Kissing Point, be comprised within the parish to be
henceforward named St. John, in honour of the late Governor,
Captain John Hunter: and that the church and buildings at
Parramatta be named St John’s.”


The celebrated “ Emancipists’ Banquet ” to Governor Brisbane,
on the eve of his departure from the Colony, was held at Nash’s
Hotel, Parramatta, in October, 1827. Two banquets, one by
the Pure Merinos, the other by the Emancipists were tendered ;
efforts were made by the Governor to resolve the two into one,
but as the exclusives would not invite an emancipist to their
table, the Governor declined to accept their invitation; hence
the emancipists monopolized the honour of feting the honest old
general who was about to lay down his pro-consulship.
In the first representative Legislature of New South Wales,
(elected July, 1843), Parramatta was represented by Mr. Hannibal
Hawkins Macarthur, nephew of the “Father of the Colony.”
Mr. Macarthur had been for some years previous to 1843 the
police magistrate for the Borough and district. In the same
parliament, William Bowman represented the Cumberland
Boroughs; William Lawson and Charles Cowper, Cumberland
County; and Poger Therry, Camden.
In the first Legislative Assembly under responsible govern-
ment (1856), George Oakes and Henry Watson Parker repre-
sented Parramatta; James Pye and Thomas W. Smith, the
North Hiding; and Janies Byrnes and Stuart Alexander
Donaldson, the South Hiding of Cumberland County; James
Macarthur and James Norton Oxley, West Camden; Henry
Osborne and John Marks, East Camden; and William Bowman,
the Cumberland Boroughs. In the same Parliament Mr.
A. T. Holroyd, of Sherwood Scrubs, represented the Western
Boroughs.
The four wards of the Municipality of Parramatta, viz.,
Anderson Ward, Marsden Ward, Gore Ward and Forrest Ward
were named respectively after Dr. Anderson, a benefactor of
the town; the Hev. Samuel Marsden (previously mentioned),
the Hev. Mr. Gore, sometime Incumbent of All Saints’, North
Parramatta, and the Hev. Dr. Forrest, the first head-master of
the King’s School.
We subjoin a list of mayors of Parramatta since the estab-
lishment of Municipal Government in 1862 :
John Williams, Esq., elected January 2, 1862.
James Byrnes, Esq., elected 17th February, 1862.
James Pye, Esq., elected 17th February, 1866.
Richard Harper, Esq., elected 18th February, 1867.
T. W Bowden, Esq , elected 14th February, 1868.
John Good, Esq., elected 12th February, 1869.
Charles J. Byrnes, Esq., elected 11th February, 1870.
Hugh Taylor, Esq., elected 13th February, 1871.
Samuel Burge, Esq., elected 13th February, 1874.
Charles J. Byrnes, Esq., elected 10th February, 1875 (and subsequently
annually till 1882).
The present Mayor, Joseph Booth, Esq., elected 14th February, 1882.


The new Chambers of the Parramatta Borough Council were
opened in 1881. They were designed by Messrs. Mansfield,
architects, and built by Messrs. Hart and Lavors. The style is
a kind of Palladian. The building consists of two stories. On
the bottom story are the Council Clerk’s office, strong-room, free
public library, office of Inspector of Nuisances, and Overseer’s
office. Upstairs there are the Council room, Committee room,
Mayor’s office, and refreshment room. Each story is very lofty,
and the Council room is ornamented with a marble mantlepiece,
a splendid chandelier, neat pillars, etc. A life size portrait of
Mr. C. J. Byrnes (Mayor from Feb., 1875, to Feb., 1882), by
Macleod, adorns the Council Chamber : it was subscribed for
in 1882 by his friends and admirers, as a recognition of their
approval of his straightforward action while in the discharge of
his municipal functions. A verandah surrounds the building,
and in the left wing is the office of the Inspector of Nuisances.
At the rear is the Council Clerk’s residence, a commodious
building well fitted up. It is intended to enclose the Council
Chambers in about half an acre of land, on which will be
planted trees, shrubs, flowering plants, etc. The arms of the
Council are blazoned on a shield in light relief over the porch.
The idea supposed to be conveyed is that of an aboriginal
spearing eels; inasmuch as “Parramatta ” means the “place
where eels sit down.”
The Foundation of the new Town Hall was laid on September
13th, 1882. Following is a descriptive account of the proposed
building: Size, 87 feet 6 inches x 37 feet and 28 feet high ;
stone foundations, brick walls. The hall will comfortably seat
about 630 persons, and the gallery about 150, making a total of
780 persons, but with placing the chairs somewhat closer a total
accommodation of about 900 people can be obtained. The access
to the hall will be by a wide vestibule (at the back of the
Council Chambers) paved with marble and connected with a
large cloak room. The doors leading from the vestibule to hall
will be 6 feet wide, made folding and opening outwards. The
exit from the hall will be by these doors, also by two other pair
of folding doors in the side walls, each 5 feet wide, and opening
outwards, so that the largest audience that the hall can hold
would be able to leave the building in a few minutes. The
access to and exit from the gallery will be by means of the
present staircase in Council Chambers, and passing through a
large arch which will be cut in the back wall of the present
building, and a wide vestibule. On either side of this vestibule
two additional rooms have been procured for the use of the
Town Hall or Council. The gallery will be constructed with
ample slope to give a commanding view of the whole of the


hall and stage. The stage will he the full width of the hall and
18 feet deep, with a slope from back to front, and raised about
3 feet 6 inches from the floor of the hall. The proscenium to
stage will be about 23 feet wide and 20 feet high, and constructed
on the most approved principle to convey the sound from the
performers into the body of the hall. At the back of the stage
two dressing rooms have been provided, each 15 feet x 9 feet 6
inches, and connected with separate doors to the stage, and also
by separate means of access to and exit from the outside. The
space under the dressing rooms and stage will be utilised. The
ventilation of the hall has received a great deal of consideration.
The space under the ground floor will have large cast iron
galvanised air gratings placed in the base course and openings
left in the sleeper walls. The hall itself will be well ventilated.
The fresh air will enter by large air shafts, about 2 feet 6 inches
wide and inches deep, formed under the windows and leading
from the outside face of wall to the top of inside of window sills,
and fitted with galvanised air gratings outside and hinged cedar
flaps inside, so that in cold and stormy weather the air can be
shut out if necessary. The windows will also have movable
cedar rails under the bottom of sashes, so that when the windows
are closed a constant supply of fresh air will enter the building
between the two sashes above the heads of the people. The
foul air will escape by means of two large double tube
ventilators extending above the ridge of roof, and connected
with two large and handsome metal domes in the ceiling, about
ten feet in diameter. Two of the most approved sunlights will
be suspended underneath these domes for the purpose of lighting
the hall, and the heat of the gas will so rarefy the air in the
domes so as to create a vacuum, and cause a current of foul air
to pass up out of the tubes. In addition to the above, large and
handsome cast-iron gratings will be placed in the ceiling and
connected with louvre ventilators in the outer wall, and so
arranged as to exclude wind or rain, and to form a channel for
the foul air to pass out of the building. Ventilating gratings
will also be placed in the back wall, under the gallery. The
roof itself will be ventilated by large louvres at each gable end,
and double tube ventilators, and the heat from the stage will be
drawn off by tube ventilators as above described. The arrange-
ments for gas supply have been so considered that the three
services to the hall, the stage, and dressing rooms, and the
lobby, cloak room, and rooms above, will be worked separately,
so that in case of a fire occuring on the stage the gas can be
instantly extinguished there, and the lights in the hall and
dressing room can remain alight until the audience have dis-
persed. A good supply of water has been considered in case of


fire. The amount of the contract for the whole of the above
works is £4491 19s lOd. The time allowed for in the contract
for completing the works is ten months from the 4th of July
last. The contractor for the whole of the works is Mr. Herbert
Coates, jun., of Parramatta. The architects are Messrs. Mans-
field Bros., Pitt-street, Sydney.
The Parramatta Water Supply Works have their source at
North Pocks, or as some wags say at “ Pye’s Duck-pond.”
The receiving reservoir is one hundred feet square, with a depth
of four feet. The filter or settling reservoir is also one hundred
feet square, but is nine feet deep. The receiving and settling
reservoirs are connected by a bell-mouthed pipe, allowing of a
thorough purification ere the water reaches the supply reservoir
which is one hundred feet square and seven feet deep. Is is
calculated that pumping for three days a week will be ample to
keep a good pressure of water on, and the reservoirs full enough
for requirements, because the receiving reservoir is capable of
holding, when full, enough to supply per day, two hundred
gallons of water per head to twelve thousand people. The
engine house is in two compartments—one for a fifteen horse-
power engine, the other for a boiler. At the dam two twelve-
inch locks are connected with the engine-house by twelve-inch
pipes, while a nine-inch pipe is laid on to take up the waste water
from the reservoir, preserved by a smaller dam. To distribute
water to the town from the supply reservoir a line of ten-inch
pipes direct to the new Council Chambers serves as a trunk
main, the smaller mains being laid on as required. The Council
intend to lay out the reservoir and dam slopes in plants of
various kinds, in fact to make the water-works an attractive
resort for the people of the town.
In May, 1882, the Anderson fountain was formally opened by
the Hon. James Byrnes. It is an exceedingly ugly structure,
situate between the Cumberland Mercury Offices and the
Borough Council Chambers, close to the intersection of Church
and Macquarie Streets.
The town of Parramatta is supplied with very fair quality gas
from the works of the Parramatta Gas Company; but the
Borough Council are very niggardly in their street lighting
arrangements, hence the gloominess of the town at night. The
above company struck their first dividend (one of 5 per cent.) on
the 30th January, 1880, at their seventeenth half-yearly meeting.
The Parramatta Tramway Works are now in course of con-
struction. They will be opened this year (1883). Mr. Jeanneret
is the promoter and proprietor: Mr. Morell, C.E. the engineer
and Mr. Wearne the contractor. The line will run from a wharf
at the junction of the Duck and Parramatta Rivers, past Clay


Cliff Creek (over a substantial bridge), through the Macarthur
estate and the Borough, to the George-street gate of the
Parramatta Park. It is intended that the motors and rolling-
stock shall be lighter and in some respects better than those in
use in the city, the pattern of the Christchurch, N.Z., motors and
cars having been adopted for this line. These motors are by
Kitson and Co., Leeds, and are noiseless, and can easily travel
20 to 30 miles per hour on a level road. In connection with the
tramway, and with a view to developing the river traffic, Mr.
Jeanneret is constructing two steamers of high speed and good
carrying capacity. When these are completed, arrangements
will be made to disconnect the Parramatta and Eyde traffic from
that to Hunter’s Hill and Gladesville on the principal business
trips of the day, and the traffic now developing from new wharfs
recently erected, and about to be erected at Drummoyne Park,
Abercrombies, Birkenhead, Sunnyside, etc., will be served by
another steamer, which it is proposed to run from No. 4. Jetty,
Circular Quay, in addition to the present trips from King street.
The engineer for the line is confident that in a short time the
run from Sydney to Parramatta Park will be accomplished, by
steamer and tramway, in little over one hour.
With regard to the founding of The King’s School we extract
subjoined information from the Sydney Diocesan Directory :
“ The founding of the King’s School was the sole result of the
efforts made by Archdeacon Broughton and others extending as
far back as 1830, to establish a scheme of higher class education
for boys and men approximating to the system of Public Schools
and Colleges at Home. The trustees of the Clergy and Schools
estate, of whom Archdeacon Broughton was one, recommended
the scheme to the Home Government in 1830, and that part of it
relating to Public Schools was approved and sanctioned by
William IY. during the Governorship of Lieutenant General
Darling. The Home Government authorised the institution of
twa Public Schools; one at Parramatta for boarders and day
scholars, the other in Sydney for day scholars only. Only the
King’s School at Parramatta was actually established, and the
official correspondence at that date relating to the subject shows
that in spite of the xlrchdeacon’s efforts to secure the erection of
a building worthy of the name of Public School, all the
Government would do was to provide a building of as plain and
economical a description as was compatible with the bare fulfil-
ment of their engagement. The school was always to have for
its Head Masters, Clergymen of the Church of England, and
although exemption from religious teaching could be claimed,
the rule was, that the scholars should receive thorough instruc-
tion in the Holy Scriptures and in the Doctrines, Sacraments,


and History of the Established Church ; they were also to attend
the parish Church regularly twice every Sunday, and on all the
great Church Festivals. The boys now, however, attend the
school chapel. The school was opened on the 13th February,
1832, under the Head Mastership of the Rev. R. Forrest, who
is recorded to have conducted it in a manner which did honour
to its founders, the colony, and himself. In order to connect
the Head Masters more closely with the Government, they were
appointed assistant chaplains, and in this capacity we find Mr.
Forrest mentioned by Judge Burton, as visiting the ironed
gangs of convicts in the neighbourhood of Parramatta.”
Government aid has long since been withdrawn from this
institution, which at present is practically nothing more nor less
than a “ private adventure” school, conducted by the Pev. G.
F. Macarthur. It is in a very flourishing condition.
Since Dr. Forrest’s time the Head Masters of the King’s
School have been the Revs. H. Bobart (who succeeded Marsden
as Chaplain at Parramatta), W. B. Clarke (the distinguished
Geologist), Simpson, Troughton, James Walker, Thos. Druitt
and H. Armitage. From 1866 to 1869 the school was closed
when it was reopened by the Rev. Mr. Macarthur.
SPORTING.
Parramatta is essentially a sporting centre for which it is
admirably situated ; its glorious Park (formerly the Domain
surrounding the once gubernatorial country seat) being a
delightful pleasure ground of considerable extent. The oak
avenue fringing the southern bank of the head waters of the
Parramatta River is always a glad sight to British eyes
Within the limits of the “Domain” are dancing pavilions;
good cricket, bowling and football grounds: and a racecourse.
On gala days, Parramatta Park presents a very charming
appearance, and the wonder is that the Trustees in whom it is
vested do not endeavour to further develope its undoubted
“ possibilities.”
In early days the Whitsuntide holidays were usually celebrated
at Parramatta by cock-fighting and bull-baiting. These brutal
sports have died out —at least as public amusements. In May,
1833, a Hunt Club was formed at Parramatta “ to improve the
breed of horses.” This club had a tolerably long and successful
existence. It' ‘ threw off ” somewhere along the Dog Trap Road;
when
“ Like wildfire its beauties went streaming away; ’
while
Horn and hound were chiming gladly,
Horse and man were flying madly,
In the glory of the gallop—


Parramatta boasts of no Hunt Club now, though occasionally
Mr. E. Terry’s pack meet in the Domain.
The first recorded Australian Paces were held at Parramatta
in 1810. The first race was between a horse called ‘ ‘ Parramatta ”
and another named “ Belfast.” Parramatta won. On this
occasion, a sporting Boniface gave enough calico to make a
chemise as a prize to be run for by three vestals of the
“ currency ” order. Under the auspices of the old Parramatta
Turf Club many “ historic ” events were run. The first meeting
of the Governor’s Club (Darling’s, founded in opposition to the
Sydney Turf Club) was held in Parramatta in October, 1828. At
the second annual meeting of the Club, Bennelong won the
Challenge Cup. The result of his victory was that his owner,
Sir J. Jamieson, backed him against W. Lawson’s Spring Gun
for £2OO. Bennelong won, but in the first heat by a head only.
At the 1830 meeting of the Governor’s Club, Icely’s Councillor
won the Governor’s Cup, andßayly’s Chase, the Town Plate and
the Turf Club Sweepstakes. Since those early events, many a
gala race day has been held in the “ Historic Borough” though
the Governor’s and the original Parramatta Turf Clubs have
long been things of the past. Henry Rous, the “ Admiral ” of
English Jockey Club fame, was a member of the above mentioned
Clubs when he was in command of the “Rainbow” on the
Australian station (1825-30). Whilst out here he imported the
blood stallion “ Emigrant.”
The existing Parramatta Jockey Club was formed in November,
1879. It holds four regular meetings a year, one at least of
which is a two days’ gathering. It gives the third highest
amount for prizes of any club in the colony, and (the.A.J.C.
alone excepted) has the largest attendance of visitors. On its
members’ roll are the names of many of the leading sportsmen
of the country. We subjoin the names of the horses “ placed ”
in the chief events of the principal meetings which have been
held under the auspices of the P. J. C. :

The senior Cricket Club is the “Parramatta Alfred,” the
members of which have an admirable ground in the Domain.
Twenty-two of the “Alfreds” demolished Shaw’s English eleven
at the commencement of the 1881-2 season. Of the many other
well-conducted local clubs the “ Britannia ” is probably the best.
It was started about six years ago. Its ground is in the Back
Domain, its club-room in Church-street.
The Parramatta and Rose Hill Bowling Clubs; the Parra-
matta Rowing Club; and the several local Pootball Clubs are
all in flourishing condition, and the well organised means of any
amount of seasonable sport. Each of the Bowliftg Clubs has a
well turfed green. There are also two private bowling greens
in the district, one at the King s School, the other at Sherwood
Scrubbs, the seat of Mr. A. T. Holroyd.
Parramatta can boast of one or two exceedingly smart “ peds ”
and is frequently the scene of a well contested footrace. In
olden days Parramatta was either the start or the finish of many
a quaint “event” of the Flying Pieman’s. The Pieman once
walked from the obelisk in Macquarie Place, Sydney, to the
“ Boundary” milestone, Parramatta, and back again in 6 hours.
On another occasion he -walked from Sydney to Parramatta and
back again twice a day for six consecutive days. On being
backed to carry a live goat, weighing 921h5., with 121bs. dead
weight besides, from the Talbot Inn, Brickfield Hill, Sydney, to
Nash’s Hotel in Parramatta in 7 hours, he performed the march,
with twelve minutes to spare.
GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS.
In Parramatta are located several government institutions, all of
which deserve a visit. They are :
The Gaol, which is capable of holding 180 prisoners, is under
the control of an admirable disciplinarian, Mr. Hussey.


The Macqaurie-street Erysipelas Hospital and Benevolent
Asylum and the George-street Benevolent Asylum (both of which
institutions are most efficiently conducted by matrons, Mrs.
Cunninghame and Mrs. Dennis respectively) annually afford
board and lodging to some five or six hundred destitute old men.
At the Eoman Catholic Orphan School (in charge of Sisters of
Mercy) there are over 300 children; at the Protestant Orphan
School (of which Mrs. Pringle is the matron) the average
number of children is 250. In 1881 the cost of these two
schools was £6778.
In the Parramatta Lunatic Asylum there are over 800 confinees
(“free/’ “criminal ” and “ convict.”) Dr. Taylor, the medical
superintendent, keeps everything in apple-pie order.
LOCAL INSTITUTIONS.
The Parramatta District Hospital (a local institution subsidised
by Government) thoroughly deserves the high reputation which
it bears throughout the district.
The Parramatta School of Arts possesses a Library (in George-
street) of some 1200 volumes. The reading room is open in
summer from 7.30 to 9.45 p.m., and in winter from 7 to 9.45 p.m.
Hopes are entertained by its members of being shortly able to
erect a new and commodious building on a more suitable site
than that on which stood the old Hall (resumed during 1882 by
the Government for the purposes of the Public Instruction
Department). The old Hall (in Macquarie-street) was opened
in May, 1867, on which occasion Mr. Hay (now Sir John Hay)
delivered the inaugural address. Garnet Walch contributed a
poetical prologue, the advice in one part of which seems to have
been acted upon, if the present prosperity of the Borough may
be accepted as proof. The advice was thus tendered :
Some of you, natives of these goodly climes,
May, looking back, remember brighter times ;
When Parramatta, full of active life
Played well her part in the continual strife
Of commerce, and bade fair ere long to stand
In the front rank of progress, hand in hand
With that great city some few miles from hence,
Whose strides, alas, were made at our expense,
And whose increasing gains from year to year,
Cause Sydney-folk to smile, ourselves to fear.
You may remember this, and feel inclined
To “leave” like Dante’s lost souls “hope behind.”
Hear my advice, no longer vainly fret
About the “good old times ” ; take courage yet.
Resolve that Parramatta shall progress,
And spare no effort to achieve success;
Till, like the glory of returning day,
Prosperity’s bright sun resumes its sway I


The Friendly Societies’ Hall is a commodious building, with
needful offices, etc.
St. George’s Masonic (E. 0.) Hall is situate in George-street.
The foundation stone was laid with all the ceremonies, in June,
1882. The design embraces two shops, in addition to a large
and small hall for Masonic purposes. The smaller hall for
banqueting purposes is 51 x 20 feet outside measurement. It
contains three ante rooms, partitioned off, on its western side.
Sliding doors (2) with a total width of 26 feet, afford access to
the large hall, the dimensions of which are 58 x 35 feet, with a
total height of 20 feet. The halls are ventilated by means of
large sky-lights. The front elevation is composite, and adorned
with the various Masonic symbols, viz., globes, parallels, etc.
The halls are well furnished with lavatories, fitted with marble,
and possess all necessary conveniences.
The Cumberland Fruitgrowers Association hold their meetings
at Parramatta. This body, which is in a fairly prosperous
condition, was originally started to do battle with the flying
fox. It ought to be extensively known that the Association
pays three pence a pair for the claws of these obnoxious
animals, provided the claimant is a member. The sub-
scription is only ss. a year. In 1881, £53 Is. 9d. was expended
as premium for the destruction of -1247 flying foxes. In the
early history of the colony the flying fox was an “ all-fired cus.”
In February, 1791, at Rose Hill, Parramatta, the water of the
creek was tainted for days in consequence of the number of
“foxes” drowned therein during a local visitation, known for
years after as the “Plague of Bats.”
The Parramatta Horticultural Society, which is in the sixth
year of its existence, is not in a very flourishing condition. The
Committee are energetic, but the horticulturists of the district do
not, as a body, support the Society. Thus a recent report of
the Committee :
The Society is maintained chiefly by the zeal of a few amateur flower-
growers, and the liberality of a limited number of the public, while the
many growers of fruit, whose living depends upon, or whose wealth is
derived from, the culture of the soil, stand apart. There seems to be no
emulation among them, no seeking after the best kinds of fruit, no inquiry
as to the best means of avoiding or curing diseases all trees are liable to.
In many instances the names even of the varieties grown are not known.
Oranges are oranges, apples are apples; and all that is doubtless often cared
for, is that a ‘ gin ’ case will hold so many dozen, and bring so much in the
market.
The private nurseries of Mr. Samuel Purchase and Mr. Silas
Sheather are Parramatta institutions of deserved celebrity.
They will both amply repay a lengthened visit.
During 1882 very considerable architectural improvements
and additions were made in the Borough. Some of these im-


provements were due to the operation of the new Liquor
Licensing Act: while more may be traced to the beneficial and
prosperous working of the Cumberland Permanent Building,
Land and Investment Society. The first annual report of this
Society, which was published in September, 1882, announced
the declaration of a bonus of 25 per cent, on all classes of shares.
Among the more important improvements in the main streets
of the Borough we would particularly mention (in addition to
similar notes respecting public buildings on previous pages) the
following: Puller’s Buildings (new), in Church- street; Grates’
Grocery Emporium (improved), George-street; and Gilbert Bros.’
Drapery Premises (improved), Goorge-street.
THE PARRAMATTA RIYER.
Before proceeding to speak of the Suburbs of Parramatta we
will give a brief sketch of the course of the Parramatta River
and its main tributary Lane Cove River, premising that the first
boat ever built in Australia was the “Rosehill Packet,” launched
for service on the Parramatta River in 1818.
Southern Bank —Leaving “ Biloela.,” near which the nautical
school ship “Yernon” is moored, and passing Spectacle Island, is
Drummoyne Point, on which is the delightful seat of Mr. W.
Wright, with its beautiful grounds to the water’s edge. From
the next point starts the iron bridge across the river. The next
inlet, almost landlocked, is Five Dock Bay. Then, past the
Sydney Rowing Club’s picturesque station, is Hen and Chicken’s
Bay, probably the scene of the awfully treacherous murders of
William P. Walker by G. R. Nichollsand Alfred Lester in 1872.
Then Nichol Bay with Concord just beyond. Into the next Bay,
skirting which is Homebush, formerly the racing centre of the
colony, run the waters of Haslem’s Greek, on the southern bank
of which, some two miles up, is the Necropolis. A mile or so
onwards is the mouth of the Duck River, and then, past
Newington, Sheather’s Nursery, Parramatta, erst Rose Hill.
Returning Sydney wards by the Northern Bank,, are passed
in order, the Protestant Orphan School, the Convent of
Subiaco (formerly the residence of Mr. Hannibal Macarthur),
and the Ermington WTiarf, from which is obtained a
lovely view of Ryde, the next point of attraction. After
Ryde comes Gladesville, with its Lunatic Asylum and
well-kept grounds ; then Tarban Creek, a deep inlet on the
shores of which is the Yilla Maria Mission Station of the Marist
Brothers. Further down is Hunter’s Hill, on the peninsula
formed by tue Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. The next
headland is Pulpit Point, near which is the Fern Bay wharf.
Here the course of the Parramatta River may be said to end.


Lane Cove Liver.— Following the shores of the peninsula
last named, on reaching its easternmost extremity, Onion Point,
we shall find ourselves in Lane Cove River. This stream has its
rise in the Pennant Hills. After a winding course of some
sixteen or seventeen miles, it enters the Parramatta River to the
north of Cockatoo Island. Woodford Bay and Gore’s Creek inlet
are on its northern bank, immediately above its mouth.
The Suburbs and Neighbourhood of
Parramatta.
GRANVILLE.
The thriving go-a-head Parramatta suburb, Granville, used to
be known as the Parramatta Junction. The change of name was
effected not without some little effort in July, 1880. Other
names than Granville were proposed, to wit, Drain well, West-
burn, Yauxhall, Martinville, Starbourne, Nobbsville, Swagsville,
o‘FJahertyton, and Lorandopolis, but Granville won the day, on
the motion of Mr. Nobbs, seconded by Mr. H. Richardson.
Granville boasts a well-conducted and picturesque-looking
Public School and a neat little Roman Catholic Cliapel. The
erection of an Anglican Church on a convenient site, is fast
being proceeded with. The foundation stone was laid by Dean
Cowper in April last. The dimensions of the church are : length
66 feet by 26 feet wide, and 36 feet in height. There wfill be a
porch 13 feet 6 inches by 8 feet, and 20 feet in height. The
complete design provides for the erection of two aisles in addition
to the nave—the latter being the portion now in course of con-
struction. It is also proposed to erect a chancel, vestry, tower
and stone spire, but these additions will not be entered upon
until the present work has been completed. A local School of
Arts will soon be in full working order. The municipal incor-
poration of this suburb is spoken of: it can hardly be effected
too soon.
Granville has evidently a big “ manufacturing ” future before
it, as the intelligent reader will doubtless gather from a perusal
of the following remarks descriptive of Granville industries :
Hudson Bros. Works. —The site upon which the new works are
being erected was a dense Scrub last year. It has a splendid
supply of good fresh water, and it is in close proximity to the
railway line. The works have been named the Union Rolling
Stock and Engineering Works. Each street on the site upon
which the new works are being erected is 66 feet wide, and


each building block is divided by a 24-feet lane. All the foot-
ways are to be 20 feet wide with trees planted on them, and
every building will have a piece of land for a garden at least 200
feet deep by 40 feet wide. The Hudson platform on the Gr. IS.
and W. Hallway is at the 12f-mile post from Redfern, and is
directly in front of the property of Hudson Bros. The company
possesses 30 acres of land, just about a mile in circuit, and have
2000 feet frontage to the Duck River, 2400 feet to Hudson
street, with between 500 and 600 feet to the railway. The site
occupied by the buildings now in hand is about five acres, which
has been brought to a proper level by the removal of about
20,000 cubic yards of earth and shale. The general plan of the
works resembles a street 90 feet wide; the buildings on one side
being for the preparation and working of the material, and
those on the other side for the assembling of the parts thus
wrought, or the putting together of the carriage, waggon, or
car, and the painting and finishing of the same. The manu-
facturing buildings will comprise a foundry ; a smithy, about
170 by 150 feet, to contain about 40 hearths, two furnaces, a 20cwt
and seven smaller steam hammers, a drop hammer, forging
presses and other modern appliances. Next to the smithy comes
the engineers’ shop, 150 by 70 feet, with first floors 20 feet wide on
each side. This will contain a travelling crane and all the
ordinary plant of a first-class machine shop, such as lathes,
planing machines, etc. Between the engineers’ shop and the
sawmill (which is the last building on the manufacturing side)
is the large wood-working shop, to contain the thousand-and-one
labour-saving machines which work the wood required in the
construction of modern railway carriages. This building is over
200 feet long, and a great portion is 150 feet wide, with two
floors all over ; and connected with it is the main engine and
boiler house to give motion to the machinery. The saw-mill is
to be 150 by 70 feet, all on one floor, raised to such a height as
to be level with the trucks which remove the converted timber.
This mill will be fitted with three vertical frames, one to take a
6-feet log, one a 3-feet log, and the other one to cut two logs or
flitches at a time. The whole of these fine buildings are separaied
by roadways 30 ft. wide. The buildings on the opposite side of the
street, so to speak, are as follows:—First, at the railway end, is
the office. This building is 70 by 40 feet, with manager’s, chief
clerk’s, and officers’ rooms, drawing office, etc., and having stores
and cellars for small goods and fittings. It will be an orna-
mental building, with a garden and fountain in front. Next
come the paint shops, 240 by 61 feet, with room for 12 large
American cars to be in dock at one time. Following the paint
shops comes the waggon shop for erecting the goods’ rolling -


stock ; this building is about 170 by 42 feet. The next building,
for carriage building, will be 120 by 60 feet. The total floor-
space in the whole of these buildings thus described, and without
the foundry and boiler houses will be close upon 120,000 square
feet —nearly three acres. In the central road, lines of rails are
laid to form a railway up and down between the lines of
buildings; and a carriage called a traverser, 50 feet long, runs
up and down on the sunken rails the whole length of the works.
The top of this traverser is just level with the kerb of the side
platforms and the floor-line of the buildings, and it is laid with
a pair of rails of the ordinary 4 feet 8£ inch gauge, coming level
with the kerbing of the sides. Rails are laid from the doorways
of all the buildings across the side platforms to the kerb, so that
the traverser carriage has only to be brought opposite a doorway,
when a truck, waggon, or carriage can be run out on to it. The
traverser then, by its own engine, is moved up or down, until it
is opposite the building where the vehicle or its load is
required, when it is run off into place without requiring turn-
tables or handling of any kind. The engines are to be of the
Corliss description and condensing, with 4-feet stroke, capable of
working up to 400-horse power. A spur mortice-wheel, 16 feet
diameter, will give motion to two 4-feet pinions, one of which is
to drive the machinery of the wood-working factory, and the
other, by an underground shaft, will drive the saw-mill. The
roof of the engine-house is a large tank, holding about 25,000
gallons of water; and mains will be laid over the premises,
having hydrants fixed where required to distribute the water
pumped from the Duck River. The boilers, four in number, are
of the multitubular description, seven feet in diameter. The
chimney shaft will be a prominent feature from the railway, and
the loftiest shaft in the colony, as it is to rise a height of over
160 feet.
Bergan and Sons’ Tweed Factory ; Byrnes Bros’. Tweed Factory ;
the Junction Brick Works; the Buck Creek Brick Works; W.
Ritchie’s Agricultural Implement Factory; and the Afon Tannery
are the other leading industrial features of the rising town of
Granville.
In the next issue of the Year Book it is more than likely we
shall have to chronicle numerous additions to the industrial
features of the incorporated Borough of Granville. So mote it be?
The descriptions of the remaining suburbs and neighbour
villages of Parramatta are arranged alphabetically. Before
commencing them we would here say that though the soil about
Parramatta is singularly fertile it requires more than tickling
with a hoe to make it laugh with a harvest, as a visit to any of


the well-trenched orange and fruit gardens which are the pride
of the district will speedily convince one. It would he too
invidious a task for us to state which orchards are the best in
the district; yet there can he no harm in saying that those of
Mr. Pye (of Eocky Hall), of Mr. P. Cox, of Mr. Jas. Tamsett
(Windsor Eoad), of Mr. Pearce (Seven Hills), and of Mr. Purser
(of Castle Hill), are in every respect thoroughly calculated to
exhibit what skill and industry have succeeded in doing with a
kindly soil.
The beauties of the immediate neighbourhood of Parra-
matta can be well inspected on a walk or chive round the hills,
starting from Parramatta, say, by Windsor Eoad, passing Eocky
Hall, of orange orchard fame, on the right, thence to the Cross-
roads at Baulkham Hill, there taking the road via Castle Hill to
Pennant Hills, and so through the Field of Mars back to the
town by the Kissing Point Eoad.
Bankstown.
Bankstown (named after Sir Joseph Banks, the distinguished
naturalist who accompanied Captain Cook on the voyage which
led to the discovery of New South Wales) is a township near the
waters of George’s Eiver. It was founded so far back as 1795.
It is on the old Liverpool Eoad, about 12 miles south of Sydney,
and 8 miles from Parramatta, via the Dog Trap Eoad. It is
healthily situated, and during the past few years has made
considerable progress. Coaches run daily between Bankstown
and Sydney ; there is also regular communication between
Bankstown and Eookwood (on the Great Southern Eailway Line).
There is a substantially built public school-house with detached
teacher’s residence at Bankstown. The population of the town-
ship and immediate neighbourhood is above 300.
Baulkham Hills.
This is a scattered township situate at the junction of the
Windsor and Castle Hill Eoads. The orange orchards in the
neighbourhood are particularly fine. There are several stores
and an inn at Baulkham Hills ; also a Wesleyan and a Eoman
Catholic Chapel.
Blacktown.
From Blacktown (near “Prospect Hill”) the Eichmond railway
line branches off from the Great Western Line. Blacktown was


so named from tlie circumstance of Grovernor Macquarie having
founded there an institution for the improvement of the aborigines
—a humane effort which his successors (though specially charged
by the terms of their commission with the protection of the
native blacks) did not continue. Blacktown, the centre of a
thriving horticultural district, possesses a public school and
several stores and hotels. It also boasts a race-course, on which
once or twice a year are held very pleasant gatherings.
Castle Hili-cum-Dural.
The Castle Hill district to the northward of Parramatta is
famous for it orchards. The townships of Castle Hill and
Dural are scattered. The locality of Castle Hill was the
scene, in 1804, of the first great convict insurrection, when
martial law had to be proclaimed ; ten ring-leaders were taken
in arms, of whom three were executed at Parramatta, and three
at Castle Hill. The rebellion was instigated by a few designing
men, who had for raw material to work upon four hundred
prisoners sent out to Australia for offences connected with the
Irish Rebellion of ’9B. The story of this outbreak has been thus
told:—“Major Johnston, on learning the position of affairs
from Grovernor King, who purposely went to Annandale to
inform him, at once mustered 24 soldiers, and started from
Annandale early in the evening. He marched all night in
company with the men, until he reached Parramatta, when he
mounted a horse. Upon learning the whereabouts of the
rebellious convicts he detached some 15 of his men to take them
on the flank, and, pushing on himself with the rest of his force,
came up with the insurgents at Yinegar Hill. Boldly riding up
to them he called on their leaders to come forward, and, upon
Cunningham and his associate doing so, Major Johnston enquired
what they wanted. Cunningham replied, “Death or liberty,”
whereupon Major Johnston, with great judgment and cool
determination, instantly drew a pistol from his holsters, and,
pointing it at Cunningham’s head, declared he would shoot him
if he and his companions did not surrender. This bold manoeuvre
had its effect, and enabled Major Johnston to secure the two
ringleaders. The rebels, seeing what had taken place, at once
opened fire which was quickly and effectively returned by the
soldiers. The fight lasted some 20 minutes, when Major John-
ston, seeing his detachment appearing on their flank, ordered
his men to charge. The effect of this movement caused the
insurgents to fly in all directions, leaving behind them 16 dead
and some 20 wounded on the field, besides 30 or more who were
taken prisoners. The routed convicts soon afterwards surren-


dered in a body, and were returned to the prison. A few wbo
did not surrender witb the rest were eventually apprehended.
As a reward for bis gallant services, Governor King gave Major
Johnston a grant of 2000 acres of land in the “ cow pastures,”
and a highly complimentary letter, tendering him his thanks for
quelling the insurrection. Major Johnston, when writing to
Captain Piper some time after the event, said that when parley-
ing with the leaders at Vinegar Hill, he every moment expected
to be riddled with bullets, and it was always a wonder to him
they had never shot him, seeing the small force he had at his
command.”
Years ago an old French noble, Monsieur Le Baron de la
Clampe, sought to establish a coffee and cotton plantation at
Castle Hill; but not a trace of his industry remains. As an
amusing writer says,—“ He would now be regarded as a highly
adventurous son of temperance, who would drink a cup of coffee
described as ‘ Castle Hill Coffee; ’ and the sanity of any Sydney
tailor would be doubted, who would submit for the selection of a
customer pieces of ‘ nankeen 5 from the Castle Hill factories.”
Castle Hill is famous for its annual Ploughing Match and
Athletic Sports.
There are several schools and places of worship, besides stores,
and an Oddfellows’ Hall, in the Castle Hill-cum-Hural district,
but as yet no public-house.
Fairfield and Guildford.
These are scattered hamlets south of Parramatta. Fairfield lies
between the Hog Trap Poad and the southern railway line. The
Fairfield railway station is the centre of a considerable firewood
and fruit traffic. There is a railway platform at Guildford.
Field of Mars.
This township lies northwards of Parramatta. It is surrounded
on all sides by noble orchards, and is more populous than its
scattered appearance would lead visitors to imagine. It possesses
an Anglican and a Wesleyan Church, two schools and several
stores. The valuable quarries in the vicinity of the township
employ a good many “ hands.” The Field of Mars was once a
Veterans’ Settlement, hence its name.
Newington.
Newington lies between the Parramatta Eiver and the Parra-
matta to Sydney Poad. Here are some salt works and a carcase


butcher’s extensive abattoirs. The Wesleyan College before it
removed to Stanmore was located in Newington House, originally
the seat of the Blaxlands. The old building is now the property
of the Government, who have converted it into a Destitute
Asylum.
Pennant Hills.
This beautiful district lies between the Field of Mars and Ryde
and along the upper waters of the Parramatta River. The
view from the crests of these hills, looking towards Sydney and
down the course of the river is “ beautiful exceedingly.”
The little hamlet of Ermington adjoins Pennant Hills. The
Anglican Church (St. Mark’s) at Ermington is within the parish
of St. Anne’s, Ryde.
Of the Pennant Hills quarry the Geological Surveyor (Mr.
Wilkinson, P. G. S.) thus speaks :
The Pennant Hills quarry is situated about 3 miles to the north-east of
Parramatta, and two miles in a direct line north from the navigable water
of the Parramatta river. It is an immense excavation from which road
metal is said to have been taken for over 50 years. The rock consists of a
dense hut jointed basalt, containing small fragments of other rocks, and
some huge masses of coaly shale, from which it would appear that this spot
is the site of an ancient volcanic point of eruption. These patches of inferior
rock cause a considerable amount of waste, but as they can be readily avoided
they do not much obstruct the working of the quarry. The stone is hard
broken at the quarry and carted to the Pennant Hills Wharf, on the Parra-
matta River, whence it is conveyed by water to Sydney, and some of the
suburbs. The construction of a tramway from the quarry to the river would
greatly reduce the cost of carriage, which at present amounts to 2s. 3d. per
ton. * * * In the same locality, and between it and Prospect, I have no
doubt but that other occurrences of basalt now hidden by a thick covering
of soil, will be discovered. Yet the trap rock of Pennant Hills and Prospect
being the main masses of the igneous rocks in this district, will form the
two principal sources of road metal f6r Sydney and the suburbs ; and as
municipal improvements are everywhere rapidly increasing, it is a matter of
urgent importance that greater facilities than those now existing for supply-
ing road metal should without delay be provided, whereby considerable ad-
vantages, other than in a monetary view, must accrue not only to Parra-
matta district, but more especially to the city of Sydney and its immediate
environs.
Prospect.
Prospect is on the Great Western Road, about six miles west of
Parramatta. There are two churches (Anglican and Roman
Catholic), a large public school, several stores, and two inns in
this scattered township. The district is agricultural and grazing
rather than horticultural. The Prospect Ploughing Matches are


annual events of great interest to Cumberland, Veteran Hall,
formerly the seat of the Lawsons, but now the head quarters of
the S} r dney Water Supply Works staff, and Greystanes, late the
seat of Mr. F. Wentworth (now of a Mr. Wetherell), are on the
slopes of Prospect Hill. From Greystanes the view is magnifi-
cent. The Prospect Peservoir (of the above mentioned Water
Works) will be, when completed, a magnificent sheet of water,
and doubtless a source of attraction to lovers of lake-like
scenery.
Of the Prospect Hill road metal quarries the Geological
Surveyor (Mr. Wilkinson, F.G.S.) thus speaks: —
Penetrating these formations (the Wianamatta and Hawkesbury) are
dykes and masses of igneous rock, varying from a dense basalt to a coarse-
grained hornblendic greenstone At Prospect these rocks form a conspicuous
and irregularly-shaped hill, which attains an elevation of 430 feet above sea
level. * * * * On the south side of this hill a large quarry has been
opened, immediately adjoining the site of the proposed large reservoir for
the Sydney water supply. This quarry has been abandoned, as road metal
can now be obtained nearer to Parramatta, but the rock, on account of it
being less jointed and more uniform in texture than that in any of the other
quarries in the district, could be hewn in large blocks, and would be suitable
for maldng into slabs for paving stones. * * * *
I am of opinion that as regards cost of production and durability it might
successfully compete with the basalt flagstones imported from Melbourne,
though the stone from Prospect is somewhat the harder of the two. On the
west side of Prospect Hill, on the Lawson Estate, and also oh the north side
of the hill, in a small reserve, some dense basalt is being quarried, yielding
good road metal; it occurs in unlimited quantity. This quarry is situated
only about two miles from the Great Western railway ; to connect it with
which the intervening country would offer no engineering difficulties for the
construction of a branch line or tramway, and yet at present the metal has to
be carted for a distance of five or six miles over a hilly road.
The basalt rock of Prospect Hill will undoubtedly be required in the
future for the principal supply of metal for western suburbs of Sydney. It
is in private property.
Rookwood.
Eookwood (formerly Haslem’s Creek) is on the Suburban
Railway Line, four miles from Parramatta. The town is rapidly
going a-head At no great distance from the township and
between the railway line and the Sydney to Parramatta Eoad
are the extensive works of the Australian Meat Preserving
Company. On the opposite side of the railway line is the
Necropolis, a cemetery of 200 acres in area, which is daily
becoming more and more worthy to compare with Kensall Green
and Pere La Chaise. Funeral trains leave Sydney twice a day
for the Necropolis—God’s Acre, for, with Longfellow,


“We like that ancient Saxon phrase, which calls
The burial ground G-od’s Acre ! It is Just:
It consecrates each grave within its walls,
And breathes a henison o’er the sleeping dust.
******
With thy rude ploughshare, Death, turn up the sod,
And spread the furrow for the seed we sow :
This is the field and acre of our G-od ;
This is the place where human harvests grow ! ’ ’
Seven Hills.
Seven Hills is tlio centre of a prosperous horticultural and
farming district. Valuable forests of native timber are still
standing in the neighbourhood. A new Anglican Church has
recently been erected on the summit of one of the Seven Hills,
from which there is a singularly tine view over the adjoining
champaign. Mr. Pearce’s celebrated orchard is in this district.
Smithfield.
Smithfield is a pleasant township situated on Prospect Creek,
about 4 miles from Parramatta and 2 miles from the Fairfield
railway station. The tanning industry is successfully carried on
in Smithfield, the Messrs. Anthony in particular doing big biz.
Farming and fruit growing are carried on vigorously all round.
Between Smithfield and Parramatta is Sherwood Scrubbs, the
property of Mr. A. T. Holroyd. This property consists of a
noble mansion with particularly well ordered grounds and of
extensive tile and brick works. The Sherwood Tile Works—the
Cumberland Tuileries—comprise three immense sheds, two kilns,
(one square, the other, a smaller one, circular), a ten-horse
engine, labourers’ residences, stalls, blacksmith’s shop, etc.
The drying space of the sheds will accomodate at one time
some 10,000 roofing tiles, besides the space appropriated to the
drying of the drain pipes, etc. The larger kiln is capable of
turning out 25,000 roofing tiles a week, the smaller one some
8000. The several articles turned out of the Sherwood Tiles
Works may be thus enumerated : —Bricks : Plain building,
pierced, hollow. These have well preserved edges and ring as
clear as bells. Tiles : Roofing, both fiat and corrugated, flooring,
paving. Drain pipes : Round (of various diameters) and I)
shaped, junctions for ditto, bends for ditto. Ridge capping ;
garden edging ; garden edging and guttering.


Subiaco.
Subiaco is an estate on the Parramatta River, near the eastern
boundary of the Borough, on which is established a Convent of
Benedictines. The community numbers seventeen members,
presided over by the Rev. Mother Mary Walburga (Wallis).
Toongabbie.
Toongabbie is a cheerful little hamlet on the creek of the same
name. It is about 2 miles north-west of Parramatta. In old
times it was the site of a penal stockade, where, if all is true
that tradition relates, women were worked to death dragging
brick carts. Says an old record: —“ The woman convicts who
misbehaved were put in iron-spiked collars. Six hundred died
out of eight hundred in six months in Toongabbie.
Chapter 111.
Central Cumberland,
LIVERPOOL AND RYDE.
Liverpool
Liverpool, one of the earliest settlements in Australia, is situated
on George’s River. It is eight miles south of Parramatta, on
the Great Southern Railway line. Liverpool was named after
Robert Banks Jenkinson the second Earl of Liverpool and Baron
Hawkesbury (the “Arch-Mediocrity” of “ Coningsby ”) who
from June, 1812, to April, 1827, was Prime Minister of England.
Governor Lachlan Macquarie may justly be regarded as the real
founder of Liverpool. It was but a straggling hamlet when he
arrived in the colony—the shelter of a few settlers whose home-
steads on George’s River had been destroyed by floods; when he
left, after the proconsulship which conferred such honour on his
name, Liverpool was a thriving township, the centre of a
prosperous district. At the same time it was also a military post.
It was in the vicinity of Liverpool that “ bould Jack Donohoe ”
perpetrated some of his most desperate outrages.
Liverpool is safely situated about 100 feet above the flood
level of George’s River, the navigation of which stream is
stopped just below the town by a dam. The town has been well
laid out, the streets are ample in width, while the Reserve acts
as a noble “lung,” presenting a fine arena for local cricketers,
footballers, etc. Within the Reserve is a simple yet interesting


monument bearing the following inscription :—“ In memory of
Captain James Cook, R.N., the celebrated navigator and dis-
coverer of New South Wales, Born at Marton, Yorkshire, 27th
October, a.d. 1728 ; killed at Sandwich Islands, 14th February,
1779.”
The Liverpool Municipal District was incorporated in June,
1872 (see Part 11. “ Statistical Account ”).
The principal buildings of Liverpool are the Benevolent
Asylum, Moore College (Anglican), St. Luke’s Church (C.E.),
the Roman Catholic Church, the Convent School, the Post and
Telegraph Offices, (opened by the Hon. Saul Samuel, August 4th,
1880), the Railway Station (the railway was opened to Liverpool,
Sept. 26th, 1856), the Town Hall, the Cumberland Hall, and the
Court House (with police barracks attached).
The Benevolent Asylum is perhaps the most admirably con-
ducted public institution in the colony (or colonies). To quote
the description of a recent visitor, ‘ ‘ It is a large two-storied brick
building, surmounted with lighthouse shaped tower, having
large wings, the whole forming three sides of a quadrangle, and
is situated on a healthy site between the most populous part of
the town and the railway line. The main structure bears date
1825, being one of Governor Macquarie’s buildings. The tower
and wings have since been added. The asylum is very
commodious, and at the present time has 740 inmates, 520 of
whom are aged, infirm, and the remainder sick patients. There
are 25 dormitories and 25 sick wards, the rooms being light and
cheerful, the walls, beds, and everything connected with them
having a clean, tidy appearance. In the sick messroom 100 can
dine, and the detached messroom for infirm will dine 500 men.
Beneath the back part of the main building there is a bathroom
supplied with hot and cold water. There are a kitchen for the
sick and a general kitchen. At the rear is a washhouse, supplied
with coppers, rinsing troughs, and other conveniences, where the
men do all the washing of the establishment. The tailoring and
shoemakers’ shops adjoin the washhouse, and inmates of the
asylum are allowed small sums for making the clothing and
boots used in the asylum. There is a large garden of more than
three acres adjoining the capacious yard of the institution, and
the inmates cultivate the necessary vegetables and a short distance
off is a second plot of ground used for gardening purposes.
Away from the main building is a convalescent room, known
as the long room, with beds for over 70 patients. There is also
a bakery connected with the asylum. The inmates of the
institution perform the general work of the asylum, which
affords a comfortable home to a very large number of men.”
Concerning Moore College, “ Anglicanus ” (a contributor to


the “ Australian Churchman ”) recently published an account,
from which subjoined remarks are taken : —“ Architectually the
College buildings are very ordinary in appearance, the style being,
I should say the Early Australian : and yet the interior view of the
quadrangle is not wholly devoid of a pleasant air of conventual
quiet in thorough keeping with the objects of the establishment.
The institution was founded in March, 1856, under the will of the
late Mr. Thomas Moore, of Liverpool. The present residence
of the Reverend Principal was the first building erected in con-
nection with the college. Subsequently the Chapel, Students’
quarters, Library, Dining Hall, and offices were added. The
foundation stone of the Chapel—known as the Broughton Chapel
was laid by the late Bishop of Sydney in January, 1857. The
Principal is the Rev. A. Lukyn Williams, M.A., late University
Crosse scholar and Tyrwhitt scholar, Jesus College, Cambridge,
Incumbent of Holdsworthy, The course of study extends
over two years, or four terms, and embraces the following
subjects :
I.—Subjects for Students of loth yeo/rs : —
Hebrew—According to the ability of the Students.
Old Testament —General History, a Historical Book, one or more
books of the Psalms, a Prophetic Book.
New Testament —A synoptic Gospel, St. John’s Gospel, the Acts,
one or more Epistles.
Latin—Special subject.
Homiletics and Pastoral Theology.
Secular subjects—Political Economy, Ereeman’s General Sketch
of European History, a play of Shakespeare, Logic.
ll.—■ Subjects for Students of the first year only :
New Testament—Greek (as needed), The Canon, Textual
Criticism.
Church History (Cents, i.—vi.)
lll.—Subjects for Students of the second year only :
New Testament—-Paley’s Horse Paulina).
Church History, Doctrine, etc. —xxxix. Articles, Prayer Book,
Butler’s Analogy.
Attention is paid to Elocution.
In every term two lectures upon practical work are kindly
given by parochial Clergymen on others.
The choice of particular books is guided by those set for the
Cambridge Preliminary Examination of Candidates for Holy
Orders.
The students have ample opportunity of acquiring practical
experience on parochial work, having to undertake Sunday duty
at Cabramatta, Smithfield, Holdsworthy, (two services), and the
local Asylum. They also give religious instruction in the


Liverpool and Holdsworthy Public Schools : and visit the wards
of the Asylum. The stress of the Moore College training lies
here—of the teaching , to secure a sound knowledge of the true
meaning of the Bible text, and an adequate acquaintance with
Church History —of the practical work, to afford the student the
opportunity of testing his capacity and inclination for pastoral
work. The students’ rooms are small but convenient. There is
accomodation for thirteen students, but only one room is allowed
to each. The Library, which also serves as a lecture room, is of
ample dimensions for present requirements. It contains some
valuable books, mostly, however, early editions of standard
works. There are very few indeed that deal “ with the more
recent results of criticism and science.” The dining-hall has
rather a bare look. The board and household management of
the College is provided by a steward. I wish I could say a word
in praise of the Chapel. The building might be made something
of, but the present furnishing is in the heavy upholstery line.
The design of the railings round the Communion Table, as also
of the pulpit, is quite unique—in ‘ * philistinistic ” art. Let us
hope some day a benefactor will arise and put it in the power of
the trustees to make Broughton Chapel a worthy ecclesiastical
memorial of the prelate who originated the idea of founding the
College, and of the good man who provided for its realisation.”
St. Luke’s Church is perhaps the ugliest building in the world!
Inside the porch of its hideous tower is this inscription : “ St.
Luke’s, erected A.D. 1819. L. Macquarie, Esq.” Above
the inscription is Gr.P., and a symbolic representation of G.H.’s
crown.
Liverpool cemetery will repay a visit. Its ancient tombstones
are pages of antiquarian lore and a pamphlet on its historic
“ contents ” would prove most interesting reading. ’Tis a pity,
though, its older graves should have been allowed to become so
dilapidated!
The main industrial features of Liverpool are Mr. Samuel’s
wool-washing Establishment and the Collingwood paper mills.
The subjoined extracts from a description of the above two
industries by a contributor to the “ S. M. Herald” will doubtless
be read with interest:—
“The Hon. Saul Samuel’s wool-washing establishment, the
most complete of its kind in Australia, having lately undergone
considerable renovation and improvement, is situated between
the river bank and the railway line; the water from the river
supplying the reservoir, and a branch line connecting the
establishment with the railway. The wool, having been passed
through some 27 feet of machinery and well washed with three
waters, is pressed out upon a cement floor, perfectly clean, and


removed to the drying-room, which is immediately above the
steaming-shed, the process of packing being afterwards carried
out. There are two steam-engines; one, of 18-horse power,
being used to drive the machinery, and the other, of 12-horse
power, to pump water from the reservoir. In cases where the
sheepskin is covered with Bathurst or other burrs, it is put
through a machine which combs it clean; and Mr. Samuel also
has invented a machine which he uses for removing burrs from
the fleece, and it is found to answer its purpose admirably.”
“ Under a company the Collingwood Paper Mill was a failure;
but since Messrs. Murray and Williams have had the establish-
ment it has been carried on under Mr. Robertson, an experienced
resident manager, with prospects of ultimate success, the plant
having been greatly enlarged and the efficiency of the establish-
ment increased. The mill has for some time been at work 15
hours every day, although until it is used continuously for six
days by night and day shifts, as are the mills of the old country,
it will not be regarded as in full work. Some 60 persons are
employed in the various processes of the manufacture, besides
others in Sydney. The raw material, consisting of rags, rope,
paper, and straw, are landed at the mill from the railway trucks,
which are brought along the branch railway extended to the mill
from Mr. Samuel’s wool-washing establishment. Besides a new
fibre boiler, recently erected at the cost of £IOOO, there are four
large boilers. Two engines worked up to 200-horse power,
furnish the motive power. There are also three or four other
engines used for pumping water, for working the machinery in
the engineer’s room, and other purposes. The consumption of
water is very great, being about 15,000 gallons per hour. It is
ordinarily pumped from the George’s river; but two large
reservoirs, with a capacity of about 450,000 gallons each, are
kept constantly filled, so that should the river water be rendered
impure an independent supply is available. The establishment
has been further perfected by the recent erection of an engineer’s
room, and castings of the machinery have all been supplied, so
that, should anything go wrong, the means of repairing it are at
hand. There are stores for chemicals, and altogether the
Collingwood mills are the most perfect in the colonies.”
George’s River.
George’s Elver rises in the hills near Appin, (towards the
southern boundary of the County of Cumberland) flows through
a scrubby yet fertile district northerly to Liverpool, thence
easterly into Botany Bay. There is exquisite scenery all along


its tortuous course, and good fishing in its waters. Sydneyites
inclined for a trip up this stream, must steam or sail or drive to
Botany, then journey by water past the Seven-Mile Beach (the
western skirting of the Bay), past Sans Souci and Sandringham
(delightful retreats, with superior hotel accommodation) to the
mouth of the river. For the first two or three miles the scenery
is wild and romantic ; beyond that the views presented tempt
to the exploration of the verdant valleys that divide the majestic
hills which on either hand slope to the water’s edge. Near
Tom Ugly’s Point there is a punt for use of travellers along the
Illawarra Road. At the head of Gawley Bay (an inlet near
the mouth of the river) the Hon. Thomas Holt has extensive
oyster claires. In 1795 Flinders and Bass (two names deservedly
distinguished in the history of Australian discovery) in a boat
(Bft long) called the Tom Thumb, explored George’s River for
many miles.
Ryde.
Ryde, the “Kissing Point” of ancient days (’tis said that
Governor Hunter kissed his wife at this point when bidding her
adieu ere he started on one of his bush explorations) is now a
thriving municipality, six miles from Sydney, on the northern
bank of the Parramatta River.
The last Aboriginal King of Kissing Point—King Harry,
“the most courteous savage that ever bade good morrow”
(to quote Judge Barron Field’s opinion of that potentate) saw
Captain Cook land at Botany. “ M,” in a recent contribution
to the “S. M. Herald,” says:—“The present writer in 1828
and the year following, being then a very small boy, knew
Harry very well, and often conversed with him. In those days
Parramatta was the resort of many of the ‘ blacks,’ not only at
their annual ‘ feast ’ in the market square, opposite the church,
but at other times. Amongst them all, there never was one like
Harry. He was undoubtedly a natural gentleman. Those who
had the good fortune to be acquainted with the late Mr. James
Macarthur, of Camden, will recollect his mild and courteous
demeanor, and the gentle tone of his voice in ordinary conversa-
tion. Of like courteousness and gentleness, and no less grace,
was this untutored aboriginal. He was an old man of more
than seventy when I knew him, and my intercourse with him
was so far remarkable, that he was the first person from whom
I learned anything about Captain Cook. He often told me that
when he was about ten years of age, he saw Captain Cook land
at Botany Bay ; and it was he who, in 1824, pointed out to the
Governor and those who accompanied him, the locality where


the brass plate recording Cook’s landing, is affixed. The only
aboriginal now alive who remembers him is ‘ Pankey.’ This old
' native ’ resides about Bose Bay, and is often a visitor at Mr.
Dailey’s. Pankey’s recollection of his dusky countrymen during
the last half-century is very accurate and extensive.”
The Rev. Richard Johnson, the first colonial chaplain, lived
for many years at Kissing Point. “He devoted considerable
attention,” says Henniker Heaton, “to horticulture, and was
the first to introduce the orange into the colony. His orchard
was at Kissing Point, and his trees were grown from seeds
which he had procured at Rio Janeiro on the voyage out (with
the ‘ first fleet’).”
The first ale ever made in Australia was brewed at Kissing
Point in 1795 by an old soldier named James Squire, who had
succeeded in cultivating the hop. The Egyptians venerated
Osirus (who had introduced the art of brewing amongst them)
above Bacchus: shall Australian be oblivious of the merits of
honest Squire, the first man on these shores to brew the
glorious beverage whose virtues (so saith the author of “ Heavy
Wet”),
On the moral frame
And physical alike,
With influence beyond the power
Of fam’d Armida’s fairy bower
Do magically strike ?
The main product of the Ryde district is fruit —specially
lemons and oranges After orange gathering the local wharf
presents an exceedingly busy appearance, crowded as it often is
at that time with craft awaiting being loaded with cargoes of
golden fruit.
The principal public buildings in this district are St. Anne’s
Church (0.E.), St. John’s (C.E.), Christ Church (C.E.), St.
Anne’s Hall, St. Charles’s Church (R.C.), St. Charles’s School,
Wesleyan Church and Sunday School, Baptist Chapel, the Court
House, the Post and Telegraph Office, the Municipal Council
Chamber, the Oddfellows’ Hall, the Orange Lodge and the
Police Station.
St. Anne’s Church with its square stone tower and high gables
is a conspicuous land mark, standing as it does on the crest of
the hill around which the township is situated. The group of
buildings comprising the Court-house, Post Office, etc., are
exceedingly tastefully designed, and form with St. Anne’s and
its surroundings the aesthetic feature of the locality.
The new Public School is an extensive building. The
average attendance is about 200.
The North Ryde School has an average of about 40 children.
A private school is kept at St, Anne’s Hall by Miss Goulding.


The Roman C. School has an average of about 80.
There is an Oddfellows’ Lodge (70 members) in Ryde : also
a Druids’ Lodge and an Orange Lodge.
The stretch of the River below Ryde is the champion rowing
course upon which Laycock and Trickett, Rush, the Hickeys
and many other A 1 scullers have done celebrated feats of
derring do.”
To the north of the immediate neighbourhood of Ryde the
road from North Shore to Parramatta via Lane Cove (a small
township possessed of hotel accommodation), Pennant Hills and
Field of Mars; as also a considerable portion of the telegraph
from Lane Cove to Pittwater (a deep inlet of Broken Bay, the
mouth of the Hawkesbury) passes by several of the finest orange
and other fruit orchards in the colony. Pittwater and Barranjuee
Lighthouse at the extremity of the Pittwater peninsula may be
reached by the road which, leaving St. Leonard’s in a north-
easterly direction, crosses the “ Spit ” (in Middle Harbour) and
joins the telegraph road above mentioned, a mile or two beyond
the Narrabeen lagoon. From Lane Cove there are roads to
Wiseman’s Ferry (near the junction of the Macdonald and
Hawkesbury Rivers) and to Peat’s Ferry (across the Hawkes-
bury and not far above its mouth). In the valleys neighbouring
these roads through tangled ferns and masses of wild flowers can
be reached such wildernesses of nature as only a poet could
imagine or an artist paint —wildernesses sweet with the perfumes
of the mimosa, and the stillness of which is only broken by the
gurgling of innumerable rills and the occasional crack of the
“ coach whip ” bird.
Gladesvil le.
Gladesville, or as it used to be called “ Tarban,” from the
creek of that name, is 7 miles from Sydney on the north shore of
the Parramatta River. The Government Lunatic Asylum
(capable of accommodating 700 patients) is at Gladesville. The
Parramatta River steamers call on their way up and down.
There used to be a horse Ferry across the Parramatta River from
Gladesville to Five Dock, but the new iron bridge has done
away with the necessity for maintaining it. The Anglican
Church at Gladesville is a fine building. The Public School has
an average attendance of about 70 scholars. The local Orange
and Druid Lodges are in a prosperous condition.


Chapter IV.
The Nepean.
PENEITH AND ST. MARY’S.
Penrith.
Penrith is situated on the east bank of the Nepean River. It
is 20 miles west of Parramatta and 34 miles from Sydney. It is
the principal town in the Nepean electorate and the centre of a
most important agricultural and industrial district.
The Nepean is crossed at Penrith by a substantial iron tubular
bridge arranged both for railway and ordinary traffic. The iron
work is supported on pieces of masonry 186 ft., apart. The
longest span is 127 ft. The elevation of the roadway above the
ordinary river level is 42ft.
Penrith Municipal District was proclaimed in May 1871. The
new Town Hall was opened in 1881. Since the incorporation
was effected the value of laud in the district has increased 100
per cent.
The principal buildings in the town are the handsome and new
commodious Court House (opened in 1881), the public school, the
Roman Catholic school, St. Stephen’s Church (C.E.), St. Nicholas’
Church, (R.C.), the Presbyterian Church, the Wesleyan Church,
the Commercial Bank, and the Bank of New South Wales.
The Railway was opened to Penrith on the 7th July 1862.
A Rifle Corps (long since disembodied) was formed at Penrith
in July 1860. The officers were :—Captain, J. Riley ; Lieutenant,
R. J. Jamison, and Ensign, Brooks.
The Penrith Public school has an average attendance of 330
children. The head teacher is assisted by an infant school
mistress, an assistant teacher, a work mistress and four pupil
teachers.
The Eriendly Societies are represented by local lodges of
Freemasons, Ancient Foresters, Odd Fellows, Orangemen, Sons
of Temperance and Good Templars.
The Hospital building has been closed for years. The Penrith
Benevolent Society, however, does good work. It is supported
by voluntary contributions, Government aid and District police
court “ fines.”
In the way of sport there are two Cricket Clubs and a Football


Club. There is also a Ladies’ Frisquette Club, to which gentlemen
only go by invitation.
The Nepean Eiver was discovered by Governor Phillip in July
1788, and named by him after Sir Evan Nepean, the then
Secretary to the Admirality. Bowing boats can be engaged at
Penrith by persons anxious to explore the waters of “ Nepean’s
pebbled way ” to
Where Warragamba’s rage has rent in twain
Opposing mountains, thundering to the plain.
From a picturesque description of the Nepean and Warra-
gamba junction (published in the “ Town and Country Journal ”)
we extract the following passages :
“ The point of juncture is apparently surrounded by almost
pendicular cliffs, towering to a height exceeding 200 ft or
300 ft, and clothed with the rich foliage of the various species
of eucalyptus, interspersed with that of other species of trees,
climbers, grass trees, ferns, etc. Both rivers, for some
distance above and below the junction, flow between cliffs of
similar character, which in times of heavy floods may be said
to form the banks. The water being edged in as it were
between gigantic walls, sometimes rises and flows 100 ft above
the ordinary level. The pent up waters, after amalgamating
and travelling three or four miles between these imposing walls
of sandstone rock, and accompanying vegetation, reach a point
where the cliffs end, and then spread far and wide, devastating
miles of country, destroying crops, and often do immense
damage on the rich lands below, until reaching the lower
Hawkesbury and Broken Bay. The Warragamba is confined
between these immense cliffs through the whole of its short
course, which is only about eight or nine miles from its junction
with the Nepean. Just above the point at which the latter is
joined by the former there is a broad sheet of very deep water,
so deep that it is looked upon by many as mysterious, and said
to be bottomless. This feature is called the basin—if we
remember right Norton’s Basin is the name by which it is
distinguished from another similar basin, some ten miles further
up the Nepean, and known as Bent’s Basin. The basin is said
to have been looked upon by the original inhabitants, of spear
and boomerang proclivities, as something to be held in great
awe. The debil debil, the bunyip, and other mysterious beings
of terrible omen are supposed to dwell beneath these waters of
unknown depth, or with a bed so far from the surface that it
was situated in the infernal regions.
“ There are several suitable camping spots on the banks of
the Nepean and Warragamba, some of them with caves which
would suffice to shelter in the event of rain. Parties should


make preparations for camping out all night if they like gipsying,
as night is the best time for netting either mullet or perch. We
may here remark that, as it is usual and proper to remove the
offal from the fish as soon as caught, and to put it in as cool a
situation as possible until ready for home, care must be taken to
put the fish where neither eels, platypus, or native can reach
it.
‘ ‘ Another interesting feature which should induce people to
visit the Warragamba course, is the variety of echoes.
There are spots where, by leaving the boat and standing on
shore, every sound is echoed and re-echoed in the most distinct
manner. Echoes can be noticed directly the boat enters between
high cliffs. In some cases a few words spoken in a moderately
low tone will be echoed and re-echoed a dozen or more times, and
at the same time singularly modulated, and re-echo being reduced
in volume of sound, and the following raised to an original
pitch. A sentence deliberately uttered will.be repeated by the
echoes ever so many times as distinctly as at the first utterance,
and the cadences are often uttered by the atmospheric movements.
The best spots for observing these curious effects of land
formations may be hit upon by observing the echoes from the
working of the oars in rowlocks as the boat is rowed along the
river.”
Blue Mountains.
[N.B. —We would recommend persons anxious to become
thoroughly acquainted with the topography of the Blue Moun-
tains district to purchase ‘ ‘ The Tourists’ Map showing the
Great Western Railway of New South Wales, crossing the Blue
Mountains, from the Nepean River to Bowenfells; also the
localities and natural features of greatest interest in the vicinity
of the line and the principal measured lands. Scale 1 mile equals
1 inch. Compiled by E. Du Faur; printed by S. T. Leigh and
Co., Sydney.”]
The first attempt to cross the Blue Mountains was made in
1789 by Lieutenant Dawes and party, who failed, as also did
several exploring parties between 1789 and 1793. In the last-
named year Captain Paterson, N. S. W. Corps, and Quarter-
master Hacking of the “ Sirius,” each made an ineffectual effort
to cross them. Dr. Bass (the discoverer of the straits which bear
his name), a M. Barveillier, and a Mr. Cayley were also severally
baffled in the endeavour. At last in 1813, Gregory Blaxland,
William Lawson (Lieutenant, 102nd Regiment), and William
Charles Wentworth, starting from Back Creek, succeeded in
finding a spur of the Dividing Range, which led them down the


slopes of Mount York into a country that improved at each mile.
Three stations on the Great Western Eailway Line are appropri-
ately named “Blaxland,” “ Lawson,” and “ Wentworth halls,”
after the successful explorers who solved the mystery of these
“ everlasting Hills.” There is a legend that one Wilson, a
convict, crossed the Blue Mountains and penetrated to the
Lachlan in 1799. A road was opened over the Blue Mountains
in January, 1815, having been constructed by convict labour in
the short space of six months. The subsequent Western Load
(the greater part of which has been allowed to get out of repair)
was a triumph of engineering skill. There is a road (surveyed
1823) from Eichmond to Hartley over the Blue Mountains,
which traverses the county of Cook, passing by the northern
bases of Mounts Tomah and King George.
PENEITH TO LITHGOW.
[via the zig zags.]
Leaving Penrith the train crosses the iron bridge over the
Nepean (before spoken of), passes the Emu Plains and the village
of Emu (on the left) and after traversing the long viaduct over
Knapsack Gully, (which has 5 spans of 50 feet each and 2of 20
feet each, its total length being 388 feet and height 126 feet),
approaches the first Zig-zag. The old coaching road over this
portion of the Mountain went by Lapstone Hill, which lies a
little distance to the right. From almost any part of this •' ‘ Zig-
zag” the view across the flat pastures of the Nepean and
Hawkesbury is most extensive. The upper level on to which
the “ zig-zag ” leads is about 700 ft. above the sea. The Blaxland
platform (4 miles beyond the zig-zag) has an elevation of 766 ft.
Passing The Valley, a station close to the banks of one of the
hill-affluents of the Nepean, Springwood, a cheerful little village
with good hotel accommodation is reached. Fiom near Spring-
wood starts the spur which separates the watershed of the Nepean
from that of the Grose. All the country edging the line on
either side has been taken up for residences ; that beyond is of
a very rugged, broken character. The next platform is at
Falconhridge, where Sir Henry Parkes has an estate and residence;
the next Numantia , in the vicinity of which are the summer
retreats of Sir James Martin, Sir Alfred Stephen, and Dr.
Badham ; the next Woodford , the elevation of which is 2119 ft.
Three miles further on is Lawson, formerly called “ Blue
Mountains.” Here the elevation is 2399 ft. There is hotel
accommodation at Lawson. On either side of the line are several
waterfalls easily accessible. The flora in this locality merits
patent investigation, the ferns being specially fine. The next


platform is at Wentworth Falls (formerly “The Weatherboard”),
at an elevation of 2856 ft. To the south stretches the “King’s
Table Land ” which extends several miles to near the junction
of the Wollondilly and Cox’s River. The “Falls,” which are
south of the station, leap over the sheer precipice that frowns
over the Prince Regent’s Glen, and thence onwards
“ —with many a shock
Given and received in mutual jeopardy
Dance like a Bacchanal from rock to rock.”
Four miles further, and the train reaches Katoomba (elevation
3349 ft.) Two miles more, along the brink of a mighty gorge,
and we arrive at Blackheath. About three miles to the eastward
are Govett’s Leap Falls and Gorge and the Hat Hill, whence
there is a commanding view (easterly) of the valley of the Grose,
flanked mar the Junction Camp (2150 ft. below Hartley Yale
platform) by the cliffs of Mount King George and the escarp-
ments of Mount Hay. Blackheath was once a military outpost;
the ruins of the “ quarters ” are still to be seen. The depth of
Govett’s Leap Falls to where water first strikes the rock is 520 ft.
Four miles beyond Blackheath is Mount Victoria station (elevation
3422 ft.), 77 miles from Sydney. Trains stop here for twenty
minutes to allow of refreshments being taken. At Mount
Victoria (old name “One Tree Hill”) there is excellent hotel
accommodation. From the township, the old coaching road goes
westerly down the Mount Victoria Pass via Little Hartley,
Hartley, Bowenfells to Rydal, a more direct way than the railway
line is able to follow. To the south of the station and about two
miles to the south west of Mount Victoria is Mount Piddington,
from the summit of which is a magnificent view of Hartley Vale,
rich in minerals, and of the surrounding hills, notably of
“ Hassau’s Walls” to the north east of Bowenfells
“that towering far away
Into the sunlight ether catch the ray
Of sunken suns at eve.
The earliest western road passed by Mount York (north of
Mount Victoria) but was given up for the one above mentioned.
The Kunimbla caves, in the valley of the same name south of
Mount Victoria and Piddington, are accessible from the township
by the “Kunimbla Pass.” Four miles further than Mount
Victoria is Hartley Vale station at the head of the sources of the
Grose. From Hartley Vale (where as yet there is no Jhotel
accommodation) there is a track down the valley of the Grose to
the “Junction Camp” before mentioned whence the foot of
Govett’s Leap Falls (to the south), the base of Mount Hay (to
the east) and that of Mount King George (to the north) are
accessible. From the basaltic summit of Mount Hay, the


Hawkesbury basin, the city of Sydney and the waters of Botany
Bay and the ocean beyond are clearly visable. There is a tram-
way from Hartley Yale platform to the Kerosene Shale
Company’s works in the vale below. The line between Mount
Victoria and Hartley Yale Platform traverses the ridge known
as the “ Darling Causeway.”
Two miles beyond Hartley Yale platform is Mount Wilson
platform (elevation 3478 ft.) From close to the station branches
oft’ in an easterly direction “ Bell’s Line of Eoad ” to Richmond
via Mounts Bell and Tomah and along the range dividing the
waters of the Grose from those of the Colo. From “Bell’s Line”
there is a track to Mount Wilson. Between five and six miles
past Mount Wilson platform we come to Clarence siding (summit
level of line, elevation 3658 ft.; platform near the Mount Clarence
Tunnel. A mile further brings us to the head of the Second or
Great Zig-zag, whence the train descends at a steep gradient for
about a mile past the Lithgow Valley beyond ; it then, with
reversed engine, travels, still descending, in the opposite direction
for about another mile; when again it completely changes its
direction, and with re-reversed engine proceeds, still descending,
on its way westerly. The difference between the upper and
lower Zig-zag is 687 ft. The Zig-zag works, which are of most
stupendous character, deserve more than a cursory view, as they
may be ranked with the greatest engineering performances in
the world Emerging from the Lithgow Yalfey (the Lithgow is
an affluent of Cox’s River) and passing Eshihank we at last reach
the rising mining township of Lithgow (95 miles from Sydney,
elevation 3005 ft.)
EMU
Emu is a scattered township on the Emu Plains about three
miles from Penrith and just at the commencement of the ascent
of the Blue Mountains. The principal building is the Anglican
Church. There is also a Wesleyan Chapel. Surface coal has
been found at Emu, the formation of the district being
ferruginous sandstone.
CASTLEREAGH.
Castlereagh lies about 6£ miles north of Penrith. It is the
centre of a rich alluvial district, which with the help of irrigation
might be turned to great advantage. There is an Anglican
Church at Castlereagh. The Wesleyans have also a Chapel.
MISCELLANEA.
Regentville , on the same side of the river as Penrith, was the


estate of Sir John Jamison, a surgeon who took an active part
in securing responsible government for the colony.
Fleurs (formerly Bayly Park), South Creek, was the birth-
place of the late Nicholas Paget Bayly, of “ Havilah ” stud
sheep fame.
It was in Bringelly hush (to the south of Penrith) that the
noted “ Bould Jack Donahoe ” was surprised by the police and
shot dead by Constable Muggleton in 1830. What gave
Donahoe the greater celebrity was his escape from justice in 1828
after he had been sentenced to death for highway robbery.
St. Mary’s.
St. Mary’s is a prosperous town on the Western Poad and
G-erat Western Pailway line, fifteen miles from Parramatta.
Farming and grazing are successfully carried on in the district,
while the tannery industry is the main feature of the town trade.
From the rising ground near the picturesquely situated
Anglican Church (St. Mary’s) ; from near the South Creek
railway station, and also from any spot along the whole length
of the racecourse, most magnificent views of the Blue Mountains
can be obtained. The Kurrajong Heights and Mount Omah
are very plainly visible.
St. Mary’s, as yet, possesses no public buildings beyond a
lock-up and a post anj telegraph office. The time is come, in
our opinion, when the Nepean Police district should be divided,
and a Court House established at St. Mary’s.
The post and telegraph offices are conducted by Mrs. Cross,
with Mr. Single as assistant. New buildings are about to be
erected —and"not before they were wanted !
The public recreation ground of St. Mary’s is Victoria Square.
After years of litigation it was formally opened as a public
reserve on June 19th, 1880, amid the rejoicings of the population.
The general Cemetery is a fine piece of ground of six acres
in area; it is divided into “general public,” “Anglican,”
“ Presbyterian.” “Wesleyan,” and “ Poman Catholic ” sections,
Anglicans, however, still use the churchyard of St. Mary’s as a
burial ground.
The Public School at St. Mary’s is a most popular institution.
The head teacher is Mr. E. Dryhurst, assisted by Miss Coghill
(mistress), and Miss Killgall, and Messrs. Blackmore, and
Campling (pupil teachers). The Church of England Sunday
School, which is held in a building for the purpose, has a good
attendance of pupils, and a good staff of teachers. The.Poman
Catholic Sunday School is held in the chapel. A good many


attend and are taught by the Sisters and others. The Presby-
terian Sabbath School is held in the church. There is a
considerable number of children with several teachers and a
superintendent. The Rev. Mr. Trivett (C.E.), and the Rev. Mr.
Clouston (Pres.), hold classes for religious instruction in the
Public School, which are attended by nearly all the children.
The Oddfellows have lately established a lodge (“ Western
Star” No. 24). We subjoin list of office-bearers: —Augustus
Gausman, P.G. ; J. J. Griffiths, N.G.; J. Carpenter, Y.G.; P.
Royal, Secretary; A, Gausman, Treasurer, It numbers about
50 members.
The local Orange Lodge is “ Chiniquy’s True Blue ” No. 11.
The officers are : —Robert McCook, W.M.; Thos. Tolhurst, D.M.;
Jas. Hall, Chaplain; Geo. Bennett, Secretary; John Walker,
Treasurer; Foreman, Geo. Turner. There are about 50 members.
The South Creek Union Cricket Club is in a flourishing con-
dition. President, J. K. Lethbridge; Vice-Presidents, T. E.
Dryhurst and J. H. Thomas; Treasurer, W. Neale; Secretary,
J. Blackman.
St. Mary’s Brass Band, J. Taylor (bandmaster); W. Worthing-
ton, A. Worthington, J. Worthington, L. Gersbach, J. Royal.
South Creek Jockey Club, P. Royal, Secretary. Annual
races January Ist.
The Good Templars (Independent Order) have a lodge named
“The Hope of St. (No. 225). The officers are: —
Henry Sainsbury, W.C.T. ; Frederick Turner, Secretary. The
weekly attendance averages 38. There is also a Juvenile Lodge.
Chatsworth Nursery belonging to Messrs. Shepherd and Co.,
is near St. Mary’s. In connection with the nursery is a fine
reservoir of water used for irrigation purposes.
St. Mary’s is celebrated for its tanneries. The following firms
have tanneries :—Mr. Robert Hamilton, Messrs. G. and A. limes,
Mr. W. Webb, Mr. Thomas Harford, sen., Mr. A. Thomson, and
Messrs. White and Co.
The brickmaking industry is also largely followed at St.
Mary’s, notably by Mr. W. Fleming (C. Gilbert, Manager ), Mr.
J. Ellis Mr. W. Thomson, Mr. W. Parker, Mr. John Taylor.
Up and down South Creek in the immediate neighbourhood
of St. Mary’s are many excellently managed dairy farms, the
butter of which always commands top rates.
There are some very good vineyards in the district, amongst
which may be mentioned Dr. McKay’s (Minchinbury), Mr.
Baxter’s and Mr. Macgregor’s of Mount Druitt.
A great number of St.-Mary-tans are engaged in the fire
wood and timber trade. The place is also noted for waggon-
building/


As an evidence of the prosperity of St. Mary’s we subjoin a
list of its most thriving business establishments (other than
those previously referred to): — Contractors : Mr. AVm. Fleming,
Messrs. Garner, Turner and Co.— Builders and Contractors; Mr.
Hy. Sainsbury, Mr. B. Loveday, Mr. Henry Montague, Mr.

Coiyton.
Colyton is a village near St. Mary’s. There is a Wesleyan
Chapel at Colyton. The Public School is ably conducted by Mr.
Palmer. Mr. Paul runs a bakery, and Mr. McCook is the
butcher. Mr. AY. Emert keeps a store. A Good Templars’
Lodge, “ Star of Bethel ” has been established. Nearly all the
population have joined.
Eastern Creek.

REMOVAL.
To my Patrons , and - the Public Generally.
Ladies and Gentlemen, —
I embrace this opportunity of returning my sincere thanks for
past favors, and wish to state that, about the middle of January
next, 1883, I purpose Removing my Old-Established Business
into one of those handsome shops situate in Eullee’s Buildings,
and nearly facing the new Post Office, Church Street. lam
encouraged to do so from the fact that my business premises are
not commodious enough for my large and increasing clientele
I shall also, in my new position,* be in the direct run of trade,
and more convenient for those kind friends who have so far put
themselves to extra trouble for the purpose of obtaining
MEDICINES from a SOURCE they can thoroughly RELY
upon.
The Dispensing Department, as heretofore, will* receive my
strict attention. The enlarged space at my disposal will enable
that portion of the business to be kept entirely distinct, while the
check system carried out by me prevents almost the possibility of
an error. This is so important a necessity that patients who
place their lives in the dispenser’s hands cannot be too careful to
whom and where they entrust their prescriptions.
Arrangements are made for a continuous supply of English,
Continental and American Patent Medicines, which will be sold
at Sydney Prices ; and the show cases will be found replete with
a splendid assortment of Comb and Brushware, Pine, Honey-
comb and Turkey Sponges, Perfumery, Eancy Soaps, Toilet
Requisites, etc., of the Newest and Most Fashionable description.
In short, it will be my endeavour to make Bladon’s Pharmacy
an ornament to the town, a credit to myself, and second to none
in the colonies.
