Contains at pp. III?VIII a preface, signed Sydney, New South Wales
August 15 th 1857 ; and at pp. 1?221 : Evangelion upatoara Louka-umba (The
Gospel that which was done Luke-of), beautifully written by the venerable
author.
This manuscript is of so high an interest, that it is thought right to add the
following extract from the preface:
? This translation of the Gospel of Luke, into the Language of the
Aborigines, was effected by me with the assistance of the intelligent Aborigine,
M c Gill, whose likeness is attached. Thrice I wrote it, and he and I went
through it sentence by sentence, and word for word, explaining to him most
carefully the meaning as we proceeded. M c Gill spoke the English
Language fluently. The third revisal was completed in 1831. I then


proceeded with the Gospel of Mark, a selection of prayers from the hook of
common prayer, in order to commence public worship with the few surviving
Blacks, A spelling book (No. 23, vide Part I. ji- 42), and commenced the
Gospel by Matthew, when the mission was brought to its final close.?
(December 31st 1841.)
? This present copy of the Gospel by Luke is the fourth rewritten revisal
of the Work.?
Mr. Threlkeld?s Mission among ? the Aborigines of New South Wales was
commenced in the year 1824, under the auspices of the London Missionary
Society, at the request of the Deputation from that institution sent out for
the purpose of establishing Missions in the East, and urged likewise by the
solicitations of the local Government of this Colony. The British Govern-
ment sanctioned the project by authorising a grant of ten-thousand acres of
land, at Lake Macquarie, in trust for the said purpose, at the recommendation
of Sir Thomas Brisbane, the then Governor of the Australian Colonies.?
?In 1829 the London Missionary Society abandoned the Mission.? The
Colonial Government then stepped in, and enabled Mr. Threlkeld to continue
in his ? attempt to obtain a knowledge of the Aboriginal Language, and the
British Government, subsequently confirmed the new arrangement.?
? But circumstances, which no human power could control, brought the
mission to a termination December 31st 1841, when ? it ? ceased, not from
any want of support from the Government, nor from any ? desire on Mr.
Threlkeld?s ? part to retire from the work, but from the fact of the Aborigines
themselves having become all but extinct;? Mr. Threlkeld ? having actually
outlived a very large majority of the natives, more especially of those with
whom ? he ? had been associated for seventeen years.?

A general account of the publications issued by the Bishop of
New Zealand?s Melanesian Mission is given in the following extract
of an interesting letter from the Rev. John C. Patteson , dated April
20th, 1858, St. John?s College, Auckland :
? I have been desired by Archdeacon Abraham to send copies of any translations into
Melanesian languages to Your Excellency.
Sir 6. Grey?s Library.?Fiji Language


11 At present, we have printed in the languages of NENGONE, LIFU, ST, CRIS-
TOVAL, GUADALCANAB, and MAI The last island is one of a group lying to the
north-east of Fat 6, where the people speak the language of the New Zealanders.
?We find that, in any detached and small island, there is a probability of the
language being spoken, which is now the language of New Zealand, and as far as our
limited information goes, we are inclined to think that canoes, full of men of the race
which now inhabits New Zealand, as they drifted upon small islands, were powerful
enough to conquer the original inhabitants, and to establish themselves as the owners of
the land. In the case of a canoe drifting upon a large island, the wanderers were either
killed, or were lost, as a distinct race, in a few generations, though they handed down,
perhaps, a few new words, illustrating some new method of fishing, &c.; for, we find
occasionally, at the north-west point of ST. CRISTOVAL, a Maori word or two,
imported into a language which seems indeed not wholly dissimilar in its vowel
system, but yet scarcely to be regarded as bearing any real affinity to it.
?I am inclined to think that it will be found that the structure of the language of each
group (subject to the changes introduced by such causes as I have mentioned, of stray
canoes, &c., introducing a language from afar) will be found similar, though at each
island the vocabulary will probably be almost wholly different. Thus, in the Solomon
Islands, it is certain that the framework of the languages of GUADALCANAB,
ULAWA (CONTRABIETE), ST. CRISTOVAL, ST. ANNE, and ST. CATALINA, are
identical. The jewel is different, but the setting is the same. So again at NENGONE
and LIFU.
?The labor of learning a new vocabulary is very trifling; and knowing where to put
the words as acquired, it is very possible to become well acquainted with the dialectical
varieties of a group. So, if it please God to supply men enough to occupy central
stations in each group, the machinery for evangelizing these islands may be mere simple
than one would at first be be led to suppose.
Our translations at present consist of 88 pages of the Common Prayer Book (No. 7a);
Private Prayers, chiefly adaptations from the Common Prayer Book (No. 7b), and a
Scripture History, to the death of David (No. 8c). These are in NENGONE.
?In LIFU, Scripture History (No. 13b), Private Prayers (No. 13a), with a short sketch
of our Lord?s Life and Ministry (No. I3c).
?Some translations of St. Mark are, as yet, in Manuscript only.
?ST. CRISTOVAL: Prayers, e.g. General Confession, Lord?s Prayer, and other
prayers, adapted to their circumstances, th j Creed, Te Deum, and a few portions of the
New Testament (No. 92) ; with a brief Scripture History (No. 23), printed only on single
pages, which we have had no time to reprint in a better form.
? The GUADALCANAR translation (No. 24) only eight pages, was made last year,
and is very imperfect. It was printed, in fact, only to help the boys to learn to read. As
the lads from that island cannot yet read, so as to make real use of a book, I have not
printed anything more ; for we have been much pressed for time, and can only do what
is necessary for the present emergencies.
?For the same reason, the language of MAI, which, by anyone knowing Maori might
be acquired in a few weeks, is left to take its chance till next year, if all be well, ?there
being no time to print anything in it, and it not being worth while to do so, because the
two young men from that island cannot yet read. Only the Lord?s Prayer, therefore, has
been printed ; though, of course, they are catechized and taught all the elementary
points of the Christian Faith. Ten adults have been baptized this summer,?five from
Nengone, two from Toka, two from Lifu, one from St. Cristoval. Our party consists of
thirty-four, including a baby, daughter of John Cho, of Lifu, and his wife Margaret. . .?

THE FIJI LANGUAGE.
This language is spoken on the numerous islands
of the Fiji or Viti Group , situated between 177� and
182� West. Long, and between 16� and 20� South Lat.
More than two hundred and twenty of these islands are mentioned
at pp. I?l 9 of No. 29 (or pp. 289 ?307 of No. 28).
About one hundred of them are said to be inhabited by a popula-
tion of at least 130,000 souls, of which the two large islands Vanua-
Levu and Viti-Levu are supposed to have 40,000 each.
The publications in the Library represent the
dialectical varieties of the following islands :
1. Lakemba (Windward Islands)
No. 26, 33, 40, 42, 43, 45, 50?52.
2. Somosomo
No. 26, 35, 36, 53.
3. Vewa

4. Mhau
No. 27?29, 44, 54?58 (?), 62 (?).
5. Rewa
No. 34 (?), 37, 41, 49.
The Fiji Language is that Polynesian Dialect, of all
those we are at present acquainted with, which approaches
most nearly to the Papuan Languages.
It has also preserved, in a remarkable degree, traces of
the former identity of the structure of the languages of this
family with the African Section of Prefix-Pronominal
Languages.

converts there, which, with all its imperfections, was most thankfully received
and used in all our schools.?
