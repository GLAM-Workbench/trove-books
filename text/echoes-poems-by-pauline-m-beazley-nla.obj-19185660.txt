Lu-Lidlee
Clear and deep lies the still lagoon,
Tideless beneath the southern moon,
Fringed by a distant line of foam,
The mermaids’ haunt—the corals home
Soft in the breeze sway palm trees tall;
Deep woods echo the night bird’s call;
The perfume of a thousand flowers
Lends mystery to the twilight hours.
The music of the murm’ring waves
Are echoed deep in hollow caves,
The liquid voice of singing sand,
Swells the music of Nature’s band.
The strings of an old guitar are caught,
By one whom love alone has taught
The potent crooning melody
In songs he sings for Lu-Lalee.
Sweet Lu-Lalee with dusky hair,
Scarlet hibiscus flowers you wear,
Garlands red, that but enhance,
The beauty of thy snakelike dance.


Ah ! what fate waits on Lu-Lalee,
Sweet dancer by a southern sea ?
The white man, planter, chief and rake,
Will from thy soul its sweetness take !
And leave behind an empty shell,
From which he’s torn the pure white jewel
The shell in the deep lagoon shall lie,
Fathoms deep, but clear to the eye
Gently rocked when the ground swell moves,
Resting again on coral grooves.
Ah 1 lovely, dusky Lu-Lalee,
Thy lover sings no more for thee !


Farewell
Maid of a land beyond the sea
An Arabian poet dreams of thee
And in his dreams of love’s delight
He lives again one glorious night;
And holds once more in arms of steel
Thy moulded form—and seems to feel
Thy soft warm breasts, thy burning lips.
Oh ! passion honey—which the soul now
In lonely silence, anguish of love lost;
For he who loves, ne’er stops to count the
Bereft of thee, love mourns alone;
A stable door has open blown,
A phantom steed has hurried past,
His load—a love that could not last.
Sxile
When the English dawn is breaking,
So quietly o’er the sea,
My heart in exile’s aching,
For a land so dear to me;
Where the mounds of sand are shifting,
Ever parched and dry,
Till a hollow wind comes lifting
Sand clouds towards the sky.


a Arabian Songs
to an Bnglish tMaid
A posy to your lips belong.
Wine for women—ale for song.
A bride becomes the buyer’s “ nought,”
A rose remains the lover’s thought.
A tender, fragrant perfume shed,
Defies the grave—evades the dead.
Oh! English rose, with oval face,
Thine is the power, oh, grant it place;
No human whim shall criticise
The love that blooms beyond the skies.
Zephyrs
Most kisses need a pair of lips,
To give a living meaning;
But kisses blown into the air,
Are caught by those, who leaning
Are listening for the murmuring breeze
To carry just such sounds as these.


e Arabian Tokens
to an Snglish 31aid
Blooms the scarlet hibiscus
In the sultry heat of day.
Leaving scarlet stains behind
Ne’er to fade away.
But English roses ope their eyes
To early morning dew.
And never time shall dim or fade
Their memory sweet of you.
Love lone in sorrow’s mound
Keeps beneath an untilled ground;
But given another plant to tend
Will bloom for ages without end.
Oh! modesty, how great a bribe
A bold, bad woman must subscribe
To catch a tiny glimpse of grace
That modesty gives a maiden’s face!
Lovely melody, bells of Heaven,
Leave their echoes as a leaven,
That heavy hearts, so tired and sad,
Are gently raised with chords so glad


Jin Jlrahian ILcfPe Song
A thousand greetings, English rose,
A thousand kisses thy mouth I close.
A thousand nothings shall I say,
A thousand times within a day;
A thousand hours of love to spend,
A thousand years of life—no end.
A thousand ages roll away,
But love remains the perfect lay;
Another age—another clime,
Another rose, most dear, sublime;
Another burden borne by love,
Another prayer heard from above,
Another perfect love shall be,
A revelation, dear, to thee.


the Slabe
A sheik was I before a slave,
A son of Ullon, Arab brave,
A mighty chief, a sturdy man—
A follower drawn to nomad clan!
A slave becomes a driven thing,
An ankle tortured with a ring.
A brain which gave out thoughts so grand,
Becomes despised—one of a band.
I wait upon a master’s pleasure;
Stand torture for his hours of leisure;
But when clear breaks the early day
Give Allah thanks and softly say—
“ It was not always thus with me,
I once was happy, gay and free;
A loved son in his father’s home,
Who never felt a wish to roam;
A poet singing songs of love,
Of treasures old—and Heaven above.”
A sudden skirmish—sudden flight;
So many killed in one dark night;
So many captives ringed and bound.
The poet, too, was sought and found.
And hustled through the drifting sand
To join a Bedouin’s moving band.


Red shines the sun on blood-red sand;
His father dies by Bedouin hand,
And overhanging lime trees tall
Ride clouds of smoke—a thick black pall
A ravaged home in one short night
Bears witness to the death and flight
Of Ullon’s women, slaves and son —
Kashmar, the story has begun.
Away, afar, a burning sun
Beats over Egypt’s plains;
And Kashmar thinks of happy days
He knew ere he wore chains.
Into his heart there comes a thrill
Of many deeds and brave
Forefathers who gave Allah praise
For wine—for meat—for days.
Amongst the dwindling band of slaves
A Christian child remained,
Who grew to be a maid so fair
In beauty’s realm—but chained.
She sees no danger in a life
Kept hidden by a soul,
Who watched the maid to woman grow—-
And found a love so whole.


A long day done, a setting sun,
A heavenly coolness brings;
A pitcher carried to a well
Gives chance to many things.
A master who no task would shirk—
A slave to beat—a slave to work—
Now stands to watch a bonded maid,
A Christian heart —quite unafraid.
Oh, willow tree to thee belong,
A world of dreams—the poet’s song.
Beneath thy flickering bands of shade
A glance was given—a tryst was made.
Oh, rising moon, a passing cloud,
A moment hides thy face;
The love that kindled ’neath thy beams,
The ages ne’er efface.
Cool daybreak brings desire again,
For sleep protects the twain.
A big thong held within a hand
Beats down and down again.
A master, who now sees a prize
Evade his grasp in anger, cries.
“ Away, away with both, I say !
I’ll deal with them at close of dav !


A Bedouin turns a soul adrift,
To wander o’er the mountain rift,
Allah look with pitying eyes
On such a useless sacrifice.
Alone and always so alone,
A wanderer in sand,
A fugitive now trails behind
The Bedouin’s moving band.
A burning sun, like molten rain,
Beats on the poet’s brain;
His only thought is now of food
And when he’ll drink again.


Sarcasm
Jollity and mockery never meet;
Mockery lives in Quarrel Street;
Jollity a home will find
In any man’s or woman’s mind.
Mockery lives to strike again;
No one sees the mocked one’s pain.
Polished neat and set aright,
A mocker sets a match alight,
Making such an awful blaze
That little time it takes to raze—
A soul, just building up a song,
Is pushed into the depths headlong;
And many a weary day may pass
Before it tries again, alas !


‘Patches
A cobbler who could patch a shoe
Can make that shoe as good as new;
And ’twill suffice in wintry weather
To bind the sole and welt together.
So all along our earthly way
A patch may needed be each day
Upon a garment wearing thin—
A Faith the soul set out to win.
The patches are the hopes and fears
The soul has worn for many years,
But like a patched shoe—you’ll find,
They Soul to Faith more closely bind


oA (greeting
Give a little time each day-
just to look and sometimes say
“ Morning ” to a passer-by,
Sad beneath a leaden sky.
Smile—and see the sunbeams chase
Lines and wrinkles from his face,
Leaving such a rosy glow
That other passers-by may know
A better morning—better mood
When someone’s wished “ A morning good!


To the Summer Fairies
A song a swallow hears on wing,
Is only heard when echoes ring
From elves who flit from flower to flower;
A summer day to them an hour.
All cloaked and covered, elfin wains
Are carting stores to elfin trains—
Of pollen, shaken down like dew,
Enough to last the winter through.
And while the merry work goes on,
The flowers with bells peal out their song
Of joy and mirth beyond a dream,
Because no mortal man would deem
His garden fair a meeting place
For folk whose footsteps none could trace
Folk who would sometimes make a glow,
And in that glow their light forms show
To one who sat so quiet and still
To watch a flower its scent distil,
And dreaming through a sunny haze
Behold with sudden startled gaze
A busy life—another sphere
Of little folk, who see and hear,
And chatter, too, with voices sweet,
About their homes and friends they meet.
Enough! You too a veil may lift—
Between the spheres there is no rift;
It only needs a patience sweet
For you these tiny forms to greet,
And feel how great may be their power,
To banish tears in sorrow’s hour.


The Lar\'
Tiny brown bird, soaring so high,
Thy song drifts down from the summer sky;
Nought but a speck against the blue,
Yet thy song rings ever sweet and true;
For deep in a nest, hidden, warm,
Tiny fledgelings lie sheltered from harm
Who through a barley field would roam,
To find a nest on the rich red loam?
Not bush or tree, so tall and stark,
But a nest on the ground is the home of the


Jl 'Dog’s Soliloquy
A Spirit Land for folks, they say!
Well! What about a poor dog’s day?
Shall this be finished like a bone,
From which the very marrow’s gone ?
No! let me talk about a home,
A home from which no dog will roam;
Where food is not —but love to spare
Is showered on every dog that’s there.
A world of beauty, gardens trim.
No voice e’re says “ Get out ” to him;
But welcome, always welcome sweet,
For scores of little pattering feet.
All green and pleasant lies the Land,
The Bourne beyond the coral strand;
Where every dog his “ day ” renews,
And phantom hares he still pursues
With rolling tongue and roguish eyes,
He snaps his jaws upon his prize!
Yes in the realms of truth and light,
There’s room for even dogs that fight!


For those who cold and hunger know,
The soft white silence of the snow;
For those who linger on a chain,
Till night brings dreary day again.
A Happy Land for every dog,
Even for those who, like a log
Can lie before a cosy glow,
And never cold and hunger know.
Dogs old, dogs young, live not in vain
They speak to men of life again,
A life they, too, shall always share,
Home and rest in a Master’s care.


Our Prince
Oh ! scion of a noble race,
Thy lineage old is in thy face.
From David, king, thy branch hath sprung,
Thou art the prince of whom ’tis sung.
Blue-eyes, fair hair, an open face,
True leader of the English race.
To thee the hearts of all men turn,
For in thy words do all folk learn—
The love of country, pride of place,
that God has given the English race
Thy smile, a flash, will draw a crowd;
Thy voice so clear tells far aloud
That always in the heart of man
There lives for aye the love of clan.
A country set within a sea,
Its tall white cliffs no boundary,
Sends out across the world thy voice,
That hearts in exile may rejoice
In love of country, pride of place,
that God has given the English race


Thou hast a heavy task to shoulder,
But who would tackle duties bolder?
A ready smile to those in pain;
Deserving n’er appeal in vain;
A knowledge deep of all mankind;
In grave disputes—an open mind;
A heart and brain to stand alone,
True scion of the English Throne
Thou showest us the pride and place,
that God has given the English race.


To a Water Lily
Lotus lily, calm and cool,
Floating on the silent pool,
Only sunbeams touch thy face,
Silver moonbeams show thy grace.
Human eyes may never see,
Thy unfolding mystery;
Far from a path that man has trod,
Blooming in secret for the eyes of God;
Breaking the gloom of the pool’s dark face,
Fading—and leaving no sign or trace,
Just for a while to light and glow,
A place where none other flower may grow
Oh! many a life so hidden, calm,
Has given to others much healing balm,
And many a lonely heart, once sad,
Finds words to make another glad,
And tender smiles that seem to say,
“ I understand, I had my day
Of hope and love and sorrow’s crown;
But all these things Old Time will drown
And only God look down and see,
The beauty and the purity,
That dwells within a soul as deep,
As the pool on which the lilies sleep.


3\ly Jdother s Smile
A smile, you ask, but why a smile so sweet?
It is as though the smile was meant to greet
A long-lost friend, not seen for years and years.
Ah! look again, the smile sure has a hint of tears
Of tears of joy, for who can bear to see,
A dear old friend without this mystery
Qf smiles and tears so closely interwoven,
In the sanctuary of the heart?
The dead face smiles and gives the answer true,
The loved on earth we lost awhile renew
Their love with us and close beside us stand,
When we embark alone upon death’s strand.
And that is why the smile we question so
Rests on the features of the dead who know
They and their loved are ever closely woven,
In the sanctuary of the soul.


To Tin Unhorn Tube
Oh! little heart of unborn babe
That beats so soft and low,
If God should take thee from this sphere,
I too must surely go.
How can we ever parted be,
Who once were one and twain.
Now you have come into my life
Ah, go not out again!
In silence many weary years
I listened for thy voice;
The very meanest heart of man
Would in that dream rejoice,
And see in many wondrous ways,
God’s gift so rare and choice.


Viewpoint
Love alters many people’s view.
And colours life a different hue,
It makes a man turn ever round,
And lift his eyes from off the ground;
Because amongst the stars he sees,
Borne swiftly on the evening breeze,
His waggon—which some time afar
He’d hitched unto a moving star,
Not thinking that a spark divine
From love’s blast-furnace fire would shine.
And pilot through the realms of space
A mere man’s dream of one loved face.
His night shall end and day begin,
When in his life he lets love in.


The Shrine of Qlay
Common clay the old potter used,
To build a shrine for years abused
By men who said “ a shrine of clay
Is not the place for us to pray.
We need a shrine of beaten gold,
With features carved by craftsmen bold,
Erected in the Market Place,
Where all may see our act of grace,
And know we give to Him above
Some portion of our earthly love.
For as we bend upon our knees,
We must be sure our neighbour sees
This pious act —this homage done
To Him, the great Eternal One.
A shrine of clay must hidden be
Behind a tall and leafy tree —
But not destroyed, for though of sod
It was a tribute to our God
By one who had no use for gold—
His gnarled old hands but clay could mould
The potter slept his last long sleep,
The shrine was hid in twilight deep
Within a wood—a quiet glade;
Its praise to God the song birds made;
Its lighted candles—rays that fell
From the setting sun across the dell.


The years rolled by, the shrine of clay
Forgotten had been for many a day,
Till a traveller resting in the shade
Of the shadows long the tall trees made
Suddenly saw a shining face,
Moulded and carved with sculptor’s grace.
A shrine of clay—a work of love,
An offering pure to Him above,
Who touched the work of the potter’s hand
With heavenly rays through the tall trees grand,
And deigned to light a work of clay
With golden and rose from the sun’s last ray !
For only when the sun is cast,
Far north ere the summer heat is past,
Will the rainbow tints touch the face of clay.
Divinely calm—it seems to say,
Common clay in the Potter’s Hand
Becomes endowed with a purpose grand;
Eyes—windows through which the soul may shine,
Lips to speak of love divine;
Hands to tend and help another
Sad and lone—but still a brother.


Tapestry
Hidden in its mountainous deeps,
Eternity for ever keeps
Day and night a shuttle weaving,
Threads of lives—some glad, some grieving;
But each and every thread to be
Woven in life’s strange tapestry.
Fadeless as the cloud of blue
Will be God’s woven thread of you;
Running through the whole design,
The thread itself—no special sign.
Only completing a perfect whole,
Just one more cord—a human soul.


The Jewels of Heaven
None may take their jewels there;
The fairest jewel—a whispered prayer,
Sending a fervent, heartfelt cry
Another path in life to try
Another cross in life to shoulder,
To fall not o’er the hidden boulder,
But always see ashine, afar,
The hidden light, God’s guiding star.
A jewel bright in the Heavenly Crown
May be a soul—once out and down,
But who through sin and shame could see
The hands once pierced on Calvary;
Such are His jewels bright and rare,
And fairest of all—the sinner’s prayer.


Lome’s ‘Promise
God sets His seal upon the work
Man has but just begun.
The glorious peals of truth and love,
Are from Heaven’s belfry rung.
To waiting souls who loved and lost
A message clear rings thro’,
And tender thoughts of peace and hope
They with their loved renew.
For in His mercy He has sent
His cheering angel throng,
That thro’ the trembling soul of man
Shall burst the heavenly song.
Of ever-living love and light
Beyond this vale of tears,
Where souls apparelled for God’s sight
Shall serve Him thro’ the years.
So upward look, oh weary ones ;
Your quest is not in vain.
His promise stands “ There is no death ”;
Your own ye see again.
But not as on earth’s troubled main
Their forms shed radiant light,
For they have stood around the Throne,
The ransomed of the Light.


Inspiration
No torn heart sobs out its woe alone;
Eternal Wisdom brings a noontide calm
And Inspiration lifts a heavy stone,
And rings through life an endless psalm
Shall not love its echoes leave,
Speaking through the words we weave,
Into songs of men and flowers,
Silver moonbeams, sunny hours?
Alas! to write a saga so
The heart must joy and sorrow know.


Saviour
One there is above all others—
“ Saviour ” is His Name,
May a Soul in passing whisper
That dear name.
Open wide Death’s portals are;
None shall pass Life’s own toll-bar,
Till alone—and so behold
Man of sorrows—Love Untold.


The Soul’s Journey
When that evanescent thing that man call breath
Shall leave the poor clay at the bidding of Death
The clay in its casket for ever shall sleep,
A garment discarded, through which worms may
creep;
Yellowed with age and silvered with time,
Or the bud in its beauty—the rose in its prime.
Nobly planned was the garment of flesh;
More beautiful far was the soul in its mesh,
Unknown, unseen, its own aura of light,
Awaiting the day of its freedom and flight,
The soul on its journey through earth’s shrouding
mist
Sees only the waiting souls who have kept tryst
Down through the ages, before stars were lit,
Or earth in Creation became a unit.


cßose
Late blooming rose, ah! do not think
The sun its rays will o’er thee cast.
The buds in June it’s radiance drink;
For thee the gleam but an hour will last,
But if that gleam comes in a day
Of dreary shadows, wind and rain,
It’s beam across a world so grey
Is worth the whole of a long June day.
Autumn rose, so softly blooming,
Do you know dark days are looming;
When sky and sea shall be dull grey
And joy be gone like yesterday?
On autumn’s day, you choose to bloom;
Beware, oh rose! how soon your doom
Will written be in lines of ice,
That hold thy petals as a vice.
For touched by winter’s cruel breath
Thy fragrance turns to rot and death


Winter Sunbeams
Oh, rising sun behind bare trees,
Thy lengthening rays are golden.
If thou canst shine on wintry days,
Thou dost my heart embolden
To rise and greet another day
Of life that seems so dreary.
Perchance, before that day is out
I’ll speak a word so cheery
To one, who sunk in grim despair
Sees not the sun, nor knows it’s there,
Till shown, behind the leafless trees,
The golden rays—to warm—to please;
But seeing—know, somewhere, somehow.
Dull care shall leave his heavy brow,
And light across his path shall stream,
Sweet promise from a wintry beam.


Storms
Rage and abuse, like storms at sea,
A sudden calm must follow;
Bringing harbour lights to mind,
And fresh hopes for the morrow.
Stormy minds, like stormy seas,
Need oil poured gently in their lees
That billows lifting near the oil
Their strength may lose and in recoil
Keep other angry billows down
To ponds of foam and the storm so
drown
So words of sweetness turn aside
The rage of man when at full tide,
And where the storm its worst was felt
Will always be the loveliest belt
Of rainbow tints and heavenly blue
Promise of calm and peace so true
That clouds from face and sky so grey
Are chased by smiles and sun away.


‘Dreams, Oh, Dreams
Borne on the evening breeze, a rose
Her perfume scatters, ere the close
Of windows, turrets, open wide
To take this incense right inside,
And keep it hovering o’er a breast-
Of mortal man, who fain would rest
But deems a rose a potion strong
To close his eyes and be his song,
And make a night seem but a dream,
A ball tossed on life’s silver stream.
Oh, life! with all it’s storm and stress,
Such dreams of love we ever bless!
For in the Land of Dreams we find
A perfect love, a soul-mate kind.


Lad’s Love
Lad’s love makes a clever ally,
Man’s love makes the soul’s last sally.
Lad’s love stirs a peaceful fire,
Man’s love fills a life’s desire;
Bringing God and all things pure;
Always love to hold a lure;
Keeping hearts along a path,
Joined together by an aftermath.


Song to an Snglish SMaid
Rose of my heart, although apart,
I ever think of thee;
And in the silence of the night
Thy smile becomes my beacon light
And beckons morning on to be
Another day of dreams of thee;
Another bunch of English flowers
To spread their perfume through the hours;
Until within my arms I fold
Thy form—and thy dear face behold!


Reincarnation
Oh river, rolling river,
When you reach the sea
You’ll be bearing on your bosom
The thoughts of fools like me,
Who only in their Ship o’ Dreams,
Will ride your course along,
Steering ever westward,
To the magic of a song
That whispers of an ancient race,
And land beyond the foam,
Where from the burning drift of sand
Rise minaret and dome.
Dream lover in dream-land o’ mine,
Beneath the spreading palm,
I feel again your arms of steel,
And see your face so calm,
And hear in accents hushed and awed
Your voice, which bids me hold
For ever and for ever
The love of Kashmar bold.
And as you hold me closer
You tell me worlds shall pass,
But love shall live eternal—
The soul knows no hour-glass.
The weary ages roll away,
As tides that come and go,
But in every age and every clime,
Your soul my soul will know.


The IDiborcee
Bring roses, red roses, to lay near her head,
Two men who loved the dead.
She never will say now which man she loved best;
So quietly sleeping,
For ever she’s keeping,
The secret so sought for locked deep in her breast.
Bring lilies, pure lilies, to lay on her heart,
Two men who played the part,
Of husband and lover, both claiming her soul;
Not seeing her sadness,
Intent in their madness,
Each to possess —and divide not the whole.
Bring pansies, soft pansies, to place in her hand
Two men who understand
The sweetness and purity shining through death.
Although she is sleeping,
Your love she is keeping,
As long as you both shall be drawing a breath.


The Faithless FoJ>er
A sorry song will be this tale,
Told when the moon, a slit, was pale,
A finger new, hid in a cloud.
A bond and promise made aloud
Was heard beneath no moonbeam proud;
But close and mute in lover’s clasp.
A maid at life’s own fire did grasp,
And taste, anon, an apple sweet —
An easy task in youth’s broad street!
But who would tell a maid so fair
A moon would rise—no lover there;
Only a bright and searching beam,
Through empty worlds—worse than a dream
A dream of Time, when ages run
No more around a blazing sun.
Alas! a bride without a groom,
A child within a maiden’s womb,
A cry for help, alone to stand,
An outcast in her native land,
Alone a babe to fend and feed!
Surely a mother then has need,
Of ravens and God’s manna bread,
To save from death a downy head,
Which on a cool, soft breast would lie,
Content to smile and never cry
When milk a moment was denied,
While bride without a bridegroom cried.


Echoes
A song once sung can never die,
Its echoes must for ever lie
Among the billowy clouds of space,
That round the world their journeys trace
So whispered words of love ascend,
Commence a journey without end;
No boundary theirs—no age—no clime,
Their only end—the end of Time.
Qameos
Put aside a thought each day,
Cameos in the mind to stay,
Wonder pictures, small but true,
Of all the kind deeds done for you.
And when you wish to criticize,
Just see if in your mind there lies,
A Cameo of a kindly deed,
Some person made you in your need.


Still Waters
Beside the still waters,
I wander alone,
But my soul hears the echoes,
From God’s Great Unknown;
To tell me of tenderness,
Thoughts pure and true,
Breathed through the open space,
God’s Tent of Blue.
Beside the still waters,
I lay me down,
Resting in quiet sleep,
Watched by his own,
Knowing that when I wake,
To earth’s drear ways,
His care shall follow me
All through my days.
