“Your Brother’s
Blood
Cries up
from the
Reeking Ground!”


ENLIST!
Battlefield and Racecourse.
(By A. N. Stephenson, Payneham.)
Thunder of guns in the dawning,
And the word along the line,
“Charge! for another mile of France,
And the goal beyond the Rhine;”
And eager as hounds to the hunting,
They go, the flower of youth;
With song, maybe, or careless jest,
But courage strong for the final test,
Giving nor taking ruth.
Thunder of guns in the morning,
Shriek of murderous shells;
And the riven earth leaps skyward,
And the tide of carnage swells.
Then the thinning ranks sweep onward,
There is pause in the hellish din;
And the gleaners go forth with faces set;
Through the moaning swathes of a field blood
And garner their harvest in.
To gather their harvest in—oh, God,
Were these men an hour ago?
Mangled and broken and blinded,
Yet on each marred face the .glow,
Of a trust fulfilled, a conscience cleared,
And only a life the price!
And gallant souls, unclogged by years,
Go faring forth to wider spheres,
Shriven by sacrifice.
ENLIST!


ENLIST!
Thunder of hoofs on the racecourse,
A flutter of gaudy silk;
A clamour of tongues that babble
The shibboleth of their ilk;
“Near thing, but a glorious finish,
And the favourite’s colours up;”
And owner and horse have sprung to fame,
Trainer and jockey share acclaim,
They’ve won the Birthday Cup!
Is it naught to you, oh Votary,
Of a sport you call divine;
That it helps to fetter the laggard feet,
That should brace a faltering line?
Is it naught to you, oh vapid youth,
In the halls of pleasure found;
That on hill and plain, by vale and wood,
Of a tortured land, your brother’s blood
Cries up from the reeking ground?
No! it is naught, for the god of self,
Shrined in a shrivelled soul,
Has crowded the finer instincts out,
Or your manhood taken toll.
It’s safe and sunny and pleasant here,
And dear the “primrose way;”
The anguished groans of a battlefield,
Fall vainly on ears by cowardice sealed,
The price is too great to pay.
Thunders of wrath at the judgment!
And where will ye take your stand?
With the shirker, craven and traitor,
Or with the hallowed band;
Who, when the nation’s call rang clear,
IMade never excuse nor pause;
But, as one of old, unflinchingly,
Ascended their rugged Calvary,
And gave their lives for a cause!
ENLIST!
