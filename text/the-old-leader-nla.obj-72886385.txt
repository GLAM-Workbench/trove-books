The Old Leader.
Be true to the gallant old leader,
Who never yet failed in our need ;
Away with the scheming seceder,
Down, down with the renegade, Reid !
He came to the front in the fifties,
He came with the giants who fought
For our rights, for the land, for the ballot,
For the schools where our children are taught
He came with the giants now vanished, ?
He?s the last of the breed that remains
Who gave us our charter of Freedom,
Who shattered and scattered our chains.
He plunged in our earliest struggles,
Young, stalwart, a monarch of men ;
And now his old head is snow-laden, ?
But his heart is as verdant as then.
Then rally, and follow the leader,
The man of the lion-like breed !
Away with the wolves and the reptiles,
And down with the renegade, Reid !
