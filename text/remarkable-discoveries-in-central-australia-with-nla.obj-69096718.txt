REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES
CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.
[third PAPER.]
[Read before the Royal Dublin Society, on Monday, March 16, 1863.]
On 18th March, 1861, I read a paper before this Society, describing
John M?Donail Stuart?s first attempt, in 1860, to cross the Austral Con-
tinent. On that occasion he overpassed the geographical centre, reach-
ing latitude 18� 57', where an attack from a large body of natives on his
small party, consisting only of three persons, himself included, obliged
his return. January 1, 1861, he attempted the transit a second time,
with a more numei?ous and better-equipped party, and reached the fur-
ther latitude of 17� in a well-grassed and copiously watered region,
when insufficient provisions obliged his return without accomplishing
the desired object. An account of this second attempt was communi-
cated to the Society on the 24th December, 1861. And now I have the
honour and satisfaction of publicly acknowledging the receipt of Stuart?s
journals of his third and completely successful expedition from Adelaide,
through the geographical centre of the Continent to the Indian Ocean,
traversing a country generally practicable for the settler, and, especially
in the northern part, rich in the chief requisites of colonization.
These maps, lithographed in Adelaide, and transmitted through the
kindness of Mr. John Tuthill Bagot, a member of the South Australian
House of Assembly, represent Stuart?s three expeditions, and M?Kinky?s
route in search of Burke to the tidal waters of the Flinders, and thence
to Port Denison in Queensland. However, neither Burke, nor any of
those who followed his tracks, reached the Carpentarian coast. It was
reserved for the indomitable Stuart alone to solve the mystery of the cen-
tral regions of this great division of the globe, and plant the British flag
on the shores of the Indian Ocean. His several routes will be more


easily and distinctly traced on this large map,* representing a trans-
central section of Australia from south to north.
On 20th September, 1861, he started from Moolooloo, one of the
outlying pastoral stations of South Australia, with nine companions, in-
cluding Mr. Waterhouse, a distinguished naturalist; and on 10th of
same month, in the following year, arrived again at that station on his
return to Adelaide.
On 25th of July, 1862, he reached the northern shore on Yan
Diemen?s Gulf, lat. 12� 14' 50"; and, having cleared an open space, se-
lected the tallest tree, lopped off the lower limbs, and hoisted the Union
Jack, with his own name sown in the centre on the loftiest branch. In
continuing the description of this happy event, I quote the simple yet
stirring words of Stuart?s Journal: ?
? When this was completed, the party gave three cheers ; and Mr.
Kekwick, my second in command, then addressed me, congratulating
me on having accomplished this great and important undertaking, to
which I replied; Mr. Waterhouse also spoke a few words on same sub-
ject; and then all gave three cheers for the Queen, and three for the
Prince of Wales. At one foot south from the tree is buried, at a depth
of about eight inches, a tin case containing a paper with notice of our
arrival, signed by myself and all my party. I have named this bay
Chambers? Bay, in honour of Miss Chambers, who kindly presented me
with the flag which I have planted this day, and I hope it may be the
first sign of the dawn of approaching civilization. Exactly this day
nine months our party, before leaving Adelaide, had lunch between 11
and 12 o?clock at the house of Mr. Chambers; and Mr. John Bentham
Neales proposed success to me, and wished that I might plant the Union
Jack on the north coast; and now nine months after, at same hour, we
hoisted our flag on the shores of Chambers? Bay. The sea has been
reached, which was the chief object of the expedition, and a practicable
route found through a splendid country from Newcastle Water to it,
abounding for a great part of the way in running streams, well stocked
with fish; and this has been accomplished during the dry season of the
year.?
However, it would appear from a closer examination of the details,
that it is only after surmounting a dense belt of scrub, and a series of
sterile stony rises, that the country north of Newcastle Water assumes
such a promising aspect; and that numerous springs and water-courses
were found in every direction intersecting and surrounding the track of
Stuart?s route. Indeed, even in the arid and level plains of the more
central districts subst ratal water of potable quality is often found at mo-
derate depths, as I have exemplified in my former papers. To give

another instance now?Mr. M'Kinlay on one occasion states, that he
? started the black fellows and whiter to dig a well close by the depot;
at eight feet eight inches struck good water. On the morrow deepened
the well to nine feet six inches ; the first four feet clay and fine .sand,
next three feet and a-half gypsum and bine clay, then again clay and
very fine sand, through which water rushed in from every quarter.?
The dwarfed and spinous undergrowths that cover vast tracts, and are
ineradicable even by the agency of fire, are a more serious obstacle to set-
tlement than deficiency of water in the interior. Again, if the natives
confined their reckless love of mischief to setting fire only to the scrub,
there would be no cause of complaint; but their cowardly malice in
firing the grass exposed the travellers on several occasions to the danger
of a terrible death; and if severe and decisive measures are not adopted
to deter them from the practice, settlement of the interior will be im-
practicable. With the exception of firing the grass, Stuart experienced
no annoyance from the natives on his last expedition; nor does he relate
any incident respecting them worthy of record. On his advance he cut
his initials on a tree at M'Grorr cry?s Ponds, lat. 16� 30', and on his re-
turn observed that the natives had cut near the letters a figure re-
sembling the head of a stone hatchet or tomahawk. This is the only
specimen given of their ingenuity and intelligence, and probably was
intended to convey a threat of what they would do, if they dared.
The stolid obstinacy of the aborigines in adhering to their miserable
life of savagery, with the full light of intellectual power and Christian
civilization before their eyes, is a fact as marvellous as the proved im-
practicability of arresting their decadence in presence of a superior
race ; and this contemporaneous existence of barbarism and progress, of
the age of stone and age of all the metals, may supply instructive sug-
gestions on a subject which has lately been discussed with unreflective
haste and rashness by some even of the highest scientific authorities.
Human development has not consisted in a generally uniform gra-
dation from primitive barbarism to civilization; but a Pariah people,
outliers, as it were, of our race, have been found in all the great divi-
sions of the globe. These, fallen by their own wilful and premeditated
error from a condition of comparative enlightenment in the primeval
ages, have been unable, without extern aid, to emerge from their con-
dition of barbarism ; and sometimes, as in the instance of the Tasmanian
aborigines, seem devoted to extinction, notwithstanding all the laborious
solicitude of Christian philanthropy to save even a remnant from their
doom.
The very fauna and flora of Australia are at this time undergoing,
beneath our colonizing influence, a mutation as complete and radical as
any geological revolution could effect; and if the papuans of that ex-
tensive*' region were extinct, the stone implements scattered over the

the globe, is a very curious and interesting fact; and doubtless they would also be found


plains, or imbedded in refuse heaps of shells of edible fish on the banks
of the creeks or inland waters, would indicate the same design and phase
of existence as similar remains discovered throughout Europe beneath
the peat, and lower still in the alluvia of the pleistocene. Now, the
obvious induction from these facts would be, that as now, so in former
ages, as far back as history is confirmed by the tangible records of arch-
aeology, human life has been presented under the same contemporaneous
contrast of decadence and progress. Thus, in this green island of ours,
it may have been, that an ancient debased race gradually declined in
presence of a more enlightened immigrant people; and, retreating into
the forests and marshes of the interior, there hunted, or rather woried
to death, with their rude weapons of flint, now so frequently found be-
neath the peat, the timid broad-antlered giant, and Hthc\ great pachy-
derms,* until at length both themselves and the animals that supplied
their food alike perished ; giving place to men of superior mental cul-
tivation, who introduced a new fauna and flora, as British colonists are
in this century accomplishing at the antipodes. However, no historic
notice, not even a solitary tradition or romantic myth, of either of these
races has reached us ; and so may it have been, likewise, that the mound
builders of the Mississippi were contemporaries of the architects of those
sunken in the Australian subsoil. Here I may repeat some observations on this subject,
communicated by me to a Scientific Society in November, 1861;
? If light meadow land receive a heavy top-dressing of calcareous sand, and remain
unbroken for eight or ten years, spade or plough will then disclose the sand in an even
laver in the subsoil from five to seven inches beneath the surface, according to the fria-
bility of the soil, which it has permeated by force of superior specific gravity. Does not
this "familiar fact suggest a satisfactory solution of the archaeological puzzle of the flint
implements discovered in the diluvium of the pleistocene; and likewise of Bunsen?s
statement that fragments of pottery have been found in the lowest alluvies of the Nilotic
region, which must have been deposited long before the human historic epoch. The
former apparently anomalous phenomena have been too hastily assumed as proofs of the
coexistence of man with the monster mammals of an era antedating by many thousand
years the received chronology of the Adamic creation ; and the position of those primi-
tive implements may be accounted for by supposing them to have sunk in the lapse of
long periods from post-tertiary surfaces through intervening strata to the drift. This
might be expressed in the form of a rule, to be observed both in stratiform and fossilife-
rous exploration?that fragments or particles, specifically heavier than the soils upon
which they have been originally deposited, will persistently descend, until they reach a
denser clay, heavier gravel, or the solid rock itself. Aqueous infiltration, cuspidal form
of the descending material, pressure of superinduced masses, and the reciprocal condi-
tions of weight and adhesiveness, will, of course, modify the rate of subsidence of the
transitive fragments according to the comparative circumstances in each instance; but
down they will go, as surely as lead sinks in water; while the flying sand above, and
that secret vegetable chemistry which abstracts carbon from the atmosphere, gradually
increase their depth by the continuous, though scarcely perceptible, increments of the su-
perficial covering. Thus, heavier matters sink, while the lighter human or animal re-
mains decay, and mingle with the soil on which they fall.?

Poland, is perhaps the sole remnant of the huge pachyderms of the era of the Cervus

phered symbolic sculpture.
Even supposing the geologist to be successful in welding human
history upon a distinct geologic era, his success could only establish the
secular conditions of a limited region; and these are likely to be diffe-
rent, both in circumstances of time and physical relations, from the dis-
closures of similar researches in other parts of the world.
We shall therefore reason more satisfactorily from the few and scat-
tered intimations supplied by archaeological discovery upon the antiquity
of man, if we carefully note the distinction between indefinite geologic
durations and historic time. The extant creational phase of Australia,
for instance, exhibits no gradational improvement in type, but rather de-
cline ; the evidence of alternating formative agency is not legible in the
everlasting rock. ? Marsupial and apterae remain unchanged, save in
dwindled size; and coincide, or nearly so, with the pre-historic oolotic
fauna of other and far distant regions. Australia, in short, is altoge-
ther strange and isolated, whether contemplated in its organic or inor-
ganic aspects; as these present no mutuality of fitness (so to speak) with
the human idea of time. Truly, that region may be more significantly
denominated a new world to the men of this generation, than America
was to Columbus 370 years ago. There dwell together, yet unmixed,
the savage of a remote and unknown past, and an immigrant people,
who, both in relation of their epoch, and character of their civilization,
approximate the sixth millennium of the history of man upon the globe.
Now, these brief remarks, for which the subject gives fair occasion,
are not intended to intrude the historic evidences of the Mosaic record
into the domain of comparative geology; but rather to question the
converse of this proposition, so rashly theorized in the materialistic hy-
potheses of our day. Certainly, if Scripture history be authentic, en-
lightenment and barbarism were exhibited in contrast, even in the pri-
meval societies of man; while their associated continuance ever since
awaits its providential solution in the future; and pre-historic, in appli-
cation to the human species, is altogether a misnomer, if intended to in-
timate a period when an enlightened people, capable of transmitting
the record of their era, did not exist, though philology may have failed
as yet to interpret the media of transmission, or the record itself may
have perished in the lapse of ages.
Stuart incurred no disaster from inundations, of which there were
several dangerous intimations during same year along the path of his
fellow explorer, M'Kinlay, in the eastern interior. On one occasion,
March 10, in lat. 25� 50', he narrowly escaped destruction, by retreat-
ing to a rising ground until the waters subsided. The natives pointed,
and called ? arimitha??their name for these sudden and destructive
floods; and there was the whole valley* (to use M'Kinlay?s words), ? a

like other similarly depressed tracts, the bed of a salt lake.


perfect sea, rising fast.? Again, six weeks subsequently, in lat, 16�,
travelling in the dried bed of a creek, be observed, forty feet above his
head, ? logs, rubbish, and immense trees uprooted, or snapped across by
a former flood.? These floods, or rather deluges, sufficiently account for
a curious circumstance noticed in the eastern interior, i. e., the occur-
rence of strange trees and shrubs?in fact, an insulated and peculiar
flora, on the crowns of the low detached hills or ranges rising from the
stony and sterile plains. Former inundations had swept away the
primal vegetation, with all living things, in its destructive career, ex-
cept in these insulated spots above the reach of the flood. We can rea-
lize a faint idea of the destructive results of denudation?the transport
of huge rocky fragments, the formation of osseous breccias, and the ac-
cumulation of animal remains and ancient stone weapons in caves or
fissures?when there is represented to the imagination such a deluge,
driving before the wind across a vast area, like tidal waters upon a lee
shore. The extent and suddenness of these atmospheric changes render
necessary a very careful supervision, previously to establishing settle-
ments in the interior ; such as elevation of the locality, and sufficiency
of deep water courses, as safety channels. The absence of any lofty
ranges, worthy of being called mountains, is perhaps the chief cause of
the alternation of excessive rains with long droughts in the interior; in
fact, Australia, even in most of its extra-tropical districts, possesses a
tropical climate.
What a beneficent ministry is that of mountains in arresting the
passing clouds, and becoming tractors to the waters suspended within
their distended folds; condensing every breath of warm air that touches
the elevated summits of sustained cold, and thus creating permanent
lake, and ever-flowing stream, as well as the transient shower that fer-
tilizes our fields! Were Ireland without her mountains, phenomena
similar to the ? arimitha? of the remote south would be manifested.
As the equatorial currents of air, laden with aqueous vapour, flow stea-
dily for months together, until met by the cold strata from the An-
tarctic ; so the chill and dry easterly winds in Ireland would strike and
overlap the moist and warm vapour borne from the Atlantic, until at
length the elastic tension burst the enveloping pluvious belt; and then
down rush rivers from the clouds, with all the terrible accompaniments
of a wide-spread devastation.
As to modes of travel and dietary, we infer from the combined ex-
perience of Stuart and M'Kinlay the same conclusions stated in former
papers read before this Society. Camels are the surest footed carriers,
and are more thrifty feeders, and less likely to stray than the horse and
ox. M'Kinlay found that the sheep, which he brought with him for
food, kept their condition better than the other animals, were easily
kept together, and became very useful in furnishing fresh meat, and so
preventing scurvy, from which Stuart and his party suffered grievously.
He also used a species of spinach, called by the natives ? cullie ;? and a
vetch, strong in taste, but nutritious, which the natives bruise between
stones, then mix with water into the consistency of damper, and bake


in the ashes. I received some pods of this plant, which are now grow-
ing in our Botanic Garden. M?Einlay lost a horse from some unaccount-
able disease, and the stud of both travellers were weak and sickly
throughout. This fatality to horses may probably arise from some poi-
sonous plant. In this country, for example, if cattle are depastured on
soils abounding with the wild parsley or other unwholesome plants,
they will sicken, and die, if not removed.
From latitude 13� 20' to the north coast, Stuart found the flora as-
suming a more tropical type. The fan palm, cabbage palm, and others
of that graceful tribe, bordered the streams; several varieties of the vine
were observed, also fruits resembling the plum, pomegranate, and
orange ; and shrubs and flowers of new and beautiful species abounded.
The rivers also in this region, mostly flowing seaward, teemed with
various kinds of fish, and the forests were full of birds, many of them
new to our traveller. In lat. 12� 49' he describes a lily, which in
beauty, if not in size, would rival the Yictoria regia. The heart-shaped
leaf exceeds a foot in its greatest diameter ; the blossom is tulip-shaped,
with petals of a deep and brilliant rose colour, six inches long; and the
seeds are contained in a vessel resembling the rose of a watering-pot,
their golden-coloured apices extruding through the openings.
This rich and fertile country seems suitable for production of cotton,
wood, water, tropical temperature, and a virgin soil, being all present,
and the one indispensable requisite of labour alone wanting. In lat.
13� 44' 14'' he came to an elevated plateau, which presented a strange
and very interesting sample of stratification. ? ? The top course (he
writes) of this table land is a layer of magnetic ironstone, which deflected
my compass upwards of 20�: underneath is a layer of red sandstone,
and below that an immense mass of white sandstone, very soft, and
crumbling away from action of the atmosphere.? Again, in same vici-
nity, bordering the Adelaide River, he passes over a great number of
? steep stony rises, composed of conglomerate quartz, resting upon a
course of slate, lying north-west, and nearly perpendicular; also some
layers of ironstone, and a sharp rectangular grey flint.? ? I should
think (he continues) this a likely place to find gold, from the quantity
of quartz, its colour, and having so lately traversed an extensive basaltic
and granite country ; the conglomerate quartz being bedded in iron, and
the slate perpendicular, are good signs.? Now, gold is found in Aus-
tralia not only in the matrix of white quartz veins and interstices in the
primitive rock, but also frequently associated with black magnetic iron-
sand in the superficial detritus; and it is not unlikely that Stuart?s
conjecture may turn out correct; but his notices respecting mineralogy,
botany, and other branches of natural history, are so few and incomplete,
that we must wait for the report of Mr. Waterhouse, naturalist to the
expedition, ere we possess sufficient information to enter upon the dis-
cussion of these important and interesting subjects. 45
* See Appendix.


If South Australia puts forward a claim, founded on priority of dis-
covery, for an extension of territory to the north coast, bisecting the con-
tinent by a comparatively narrow strip, it is not likely to be entertained
by the home government; but if a capacious and secure roadstead be
discovered within the Gulf of Van Diemen,* there does not seem any
financial hindrance to the merchants of Adelaide establishing a mercan-
tile marine and goods depot on the northern coast, thereby avoiding the
perils and delays of the circuitous ocean routes, i. e., provided the over-
land transit is ascertained to be not only safe and facile, but also less
expensive for transport of cattle and merchandise. The abandonment in
1847, after nine years? trial, of Port Essington (which is only about one
degree north of Stuart?s terminus), in consequence of insalubrity of cli-
mate, unproductiveness of soil, and want ot markets, will render the
British Government cautious in encouraging colonial settlement without
a careful preliminary survey, and examination, especially of the climate,
and capabilities of the maritime districts.
Again, Government may be disposed to organize a penal settlement
on the northern coast. The nucleus of such settlement would be over
1200 miles from the nearest colonial capital; and the measure might
likewise be rendered less distasteful, by making it available foi Austra-
lian as well as British convicts. Within little more than a half century
the state executive has receded from sanguinary severity to the other
extreme of injudicious lenity ; and statesmen are gradually inclining to
the necessity of re-adopting the punishment of exile for repeated and in-
corrigible offenders, as desirable not only in a financial view, but chiefly
to preserve social and civil interests at home from the dangers involved in
the overwhelming increase of criminals among a dense population with-
in a very limited territory; at same time not altogether abiogating
the reformatory system, which may serve the co-ordinate purpose of
neutralizing crime in its incipience in the case of juvenile offenders;
just as sanitary preventives to counteract the injurious effects of mias-
mata are combined with great conduits for expulsion of the sewage,
which, if dammed back, would be destructive of health and life in our
cities. ? The commonwealth is necessarily insecure, when the foul streams
of crime are allowed to stagnate and become absorbed into the healthful
elements of social life.
* The embouchure of the Adelaide, not far from Stuart?s terminus, is half a mile wide,
with ? a perfect ship entrance,? as described by Lieutenant Helpman, who, in July, 1839,
ascended the river in boats sixty miles, or double that distance by the bends. Halfway,
the river was 250 yards wide, with seven fathoms water; and at the extreme point
reached, where snags and fallen trees interrupted further progress, the river was sixty
yards wide, with three fathoms water. ... ? <?
Some point on this river would probably form the most convenient terminus for a
trans-Australian telegraph along Stuart?s route. Two other plans have been proposed,
by M?Kinlay?s route, w-hich is more easily reached from Adelaide than from Melbourne ,
and a coastwise track from Adelaide to Queensland. The last would be the most cir-
cuitous, but would touch all the principal outlets of traffic; pole timber also would be
more easily supplied for the wires, and the other materials would be cheaper by sea-borne
carriage.


In thus adverting to the probability of a partial recurrence to the
punishment of transportation, I by no means presume to advocate that
measure with special reference to Australia; but certainly a great pro-
portion of our adult convicts would be employed more advantageously
(in a moral point of view) for themselves, and for the British world at
large, in cultivating cotton on the shores of Yan Diemen?s Gulf, or even
collecting the precious metal in Stuart?s gold fields on the Adelaide (sup-
posing his conjecture true) than in gaols and reformatories at home, where
their mode of living is in every respect more comfortable than that of
our honest agricultural labourers, or the humbler artisans of our towns.
However, the prosperity, wealth, and public spirit, of these great
colonial commonwealths entitle their declared opinion upon Australian
matters to respectful consideration ; the exports according to last year?s
returns amounting to nearly twenty-seven millions, and imports exceed-
ing twenty-three millions ; while the annual revenue, raised by a light
and equitable taxation, is upwards of six millions.
The progress of Australia, (including Tasmania) is, under all cir-
cumstances, unparalleled in the annals of colonizing enterprise. Just
three quarters of a century since, in 1788, 1037 persons, reckoning all
ranks and ages?officials, settlers, convicts, and their children?landed
on the shores of Port Jackson ; and the last census reports a population
of 1,240,000 souls, leaving out the aborigines, computed to be about
a quarter of a million, and who are declining in inverse ratio to the in-
crease of the immigrant race. Now, if we assume the same numerical
progress for next seventy-five years, the white population in 1940 would
vastly exceed the total present population of the globe. It is only by
analogy that we can approximate the probable future of any vast and
imperfectly known portion of the earth?s surface; and instituting the
other comparison, of increase in proportion to area, the resulting estimate
would fall not far short of the former conclusion in numbers. For ex-
ample, the population ofChinaproper is computed at 362 millions, occupy-
ing an area of 1,300,000 square miles ; but the united area of Australia
and Tasmania is 3,024,000 square miles, or twice and a quarter that of
China; and, under similiar circumstances of capability for inhabitation,
would therefore accomodate 800 millions. Of course, it is not warrant-
able to urge such comparisons to their precise arithmetical inferences;
but allowing for all disadvantages, whether known or conjectured, in
the yet unexplored interior, it is not unlikely that there are some pre-
sent here this evening who may live to see Australia tenanted by
twenty millions, speaking the language of England, and prospering
under her religion, institutions, and laws.
APPENDIX.
Of the flora and fauna of the interior there As but scant Accord in
those portions of the Journals of Mr. Waterhouse which have as yet
come to light. The prevailing flora of the central arid tracts consists


chiefly of mulgas, cassias, acacias, spinifex (the porcupine grass of the
colonists), and gum trees on the banks of the creeks, of stunted and
distorted growth. Of the natural history of the rich northern country,
the 'future site of a prosperous and populous settlement, no account
whatever is given; but of the geology of the interior a few observations
are noted, of considerable interest, relative to volcanic phenomena, and
the lithological character of the strata.
At Mount Hamilton Station, lat. 26� 47', there occurs a beautiful
limpid spring, welling from the summit of a volcanic cone, which rises
20 feet above the plain. A few miles farther north are the Blanchecup
springs, discovered by Major Warburton. The principal of these
springs up through the fissures of an ancient crater, and overflows the
summit of a truncated cone, about 40 feet wide, and elevated about the
same height from the plain. The water is singularly transparent, and
gracefully fringed round with tall green reeds; and the lava is so hard
and compact, as to resemble a siliceous limestone.
The Freeling springs, lat. 22� 35', present another remarkable
example of unfailing supplies of water issuing from ancient volcanic
fissures; but here the water is so strongly mineralized, as to he unfit
for drinking. Many other instances of volcanic cones were met with
in the interior, several of them penetrating through a marine argilla-
ceous deposit, abounding in fossil sea shells; from which it is inferred,
that these cones were of submarine origin. On the other hand, it
would seem that the upheaval of a great part of the central plains
was marked by lacustrine conditions, fresh water shells, chiefly palu-
dina and unio, being found in great quantity scattered over the
plains surrounding the waterholes; as, for instance, on Sturt?s plains,
comprising the extensive well-grassed country bordering on the chain
of large deep ponds which Stuart named Newcastle water. These
ponds Mr. Waterhouse conjectures to be the residua of an ancient
fresh water lake, which covered a vast extent of the interior in about
the 17th and 18th degrees of latitude; and he infers that the central
country is gradually drying up, in consequence of the evaporation ex-
ceeding the fall of rain, and the gypsous tenacious clay checking the
formation of springs by preventing the infiltration of water. There
seem to be no settled or annually recurrent rainy seasons; for, although
the character of many of the dry watercourses proves that they were
occasioned by extraordinary floods, still the size of the gnarled gum
trees and acacias, growing in their beds, equally demonstrates the long
lapse of years since the occurrence of such floods. Mr. Waterhouse
manifestly does not consider the colonization of the interior desirable,
or even practicable in some districts.
The Mac Donnell range, a little south of the tropic, from 1500 to
2000 feet high, was the only land of considerable elevation met with
in the interior; and this range Mr. Waterhouse considers to be the
natural centre of that part of the continent. The prevailing rocks were
gneiss of peculiar hardness and compactness ; a variety of granites, some


not observed before; argillaceous schist; silex, sometimes of a drab co-
lour ; ironstone; and occasionally a very rich veinstone.
He describes a curious section of the strata on the banks of a creek,
named the Finke, in lat. 27� 30, ?the base, a soft argillaceous schist
horizontally stratified, with numerous vertical fissures, interstratified
with a free sandstone of various colours, and topped by a curious sili-
ceous rock, of a drab colour, and frequent conchoidal fracture ; appear-
ing like hard baked earthenware. The splintered siliceous stones, strewn
thickly over vast plains in this latitude, Mr. 'Waterhouse considers to
be derived from this fissile siliceous rock, floods having undermined the
argillaceous schist, and then the overlying rock falling in, and being
separated in small fragments, and swept away by the rush of water,
Mr. Waterhouse has been directed by the South Australian Govern-
ment to prepare a detailed account of his discoveries, with illustrations;
and the Koyal Dublin Society may be so fortunate as to obtain spe-
cimens of natural history from his valuable collections through the

of sandy plains, to lat. 20� 16', long. 127� 35'.
Burke, starting from Melbourne, touches Sturt?s terminus en route, and at-
tains a tidal estuary, supposed to be the River Albert, on the Carpentarian Gulf, but
the ocean not within sight. The interior country occasionally fertile and well-
watered, but a great part of it might be fitly named Australia Petrea.
