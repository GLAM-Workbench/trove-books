? Coo?ee Australia.?
? What is your battle cry, oh! ye brave??
? Have you thought of it, officers, men ? ?
You must have a call that will warn,
thrill, save ? '
Let it be?? Coo?ee, Australia ???When
You charge through the mud mixed with
white men?s blood,
Many men, khaki-clad, like yourselves?


? How will ye know which is Mend,
which foe
If you haven?t a battle cry, lads ? ?
When the night groweth dark ?and the
shot and the shell
Fall hissing along your trench,
Snow and rain like a pall, thick smoke
over all
Obscuring the blood and the stench
? Will you shout forth that cry ? (like a
native bird?s call)
That has sounded through all this land ?
When the child, or the man, or the
woman has strayed
From the clearing, the mine; when a hand
Is curved round the mouth and the long
coo?ee?
Wakes the echoes of desert and bush.


Then we listen, intent, for the answering
To thrill oiit of the brooding hush.
You will shout it now, bloody sweat on
your brow
As you charge ; and charge yet again
Like devils you?ll fight, in the hell-raised
More than like calm, Australian men ?
Let the coo?ee arise from thousands of
throats
Of the flower of Australia?s youth ;
As bodies shall bleed, pierced through
Khaki coats,
And emu plumes fall? -To the ruth
Of an enemy seeking but warlkie power
And supremacy over the world.
But! in spite of it all; the ?coo?ee? shall
Where the five starred flag is unfurled


?Will that be your battle cry, oh! ye
brave ? ?
? Coo?ee ? ?? Australia ? ?? Charge ?
Ye are out to help Old England to Save
The World?s freedom ?then ?Coo?ee ?
and Charge.
From Australia?s Sons
IN FAR-OFF GALLIPOLI.
Come on boys! come !
Lift up the Long Coo?ee
And let us know Australia hits the trail.
We?re hanging to these trenches,
Filled with Turkish dead and ?stenches ?
We?re holding on midst shell and shrapnel
Come on, boys ! come !
Across the trackless ocean


?(?Tis time we had a spell and got some
rest).
Don?t stay in well-warmed houses,
Come lift that cry that rouses,
And follow it ?with half Australia?s best.
Come on, boys ! come !
And make Australia?s glory
Eing thro? a world now chaosed and
travailed,
Come out and help the Allies
To tell the deathless story,
Of how we chai'ged ! held on ! and then ??
prevailed !
Come on, boys ! come 1
Lift up the Long Coo?ee ??
We?ve set the Tocsin ringing in your ears;
We?ve cut your way to Glory
Thro? tracks, sea-girt and gory,
We wait!! to catch your Coo?ee and your
cheers.


Somewhere in France
A soldier ?one from a far-off land
(The land of the long Coo?ee),
Was doing his little bit in France,
And doing it -worthily.
He had looked on the rippling splendour,
Of the vine and grass-clad lands ;
He had read the hearts of the Frenchmen,
And had warmly clasped their hands.
He had sung in Marseillaise chorus,
Had marched to that stirring air ;
Now he fought in grim French
trenches,
Like a beast in some hidden lair.


Furtive?and furtively watching,
Mud splashed, blood splashed, cold ??
He had seen things done, things happen,
Which had made the world seem old.
Old, and haggard, and weary,
Yet lit with an awful glare,
Eent with bomb and cannon,
?Twas a hell beyond compare.
Yet once, ?twas all verdue and grass land,
Where poetry fed the soul,
Now ! Nought in sight save wreckage,
Not one acre of surface whole.
All torn and battered and riven?
The soldier took aim once more,
When, just like rays from heaven,
Shone ?three little buttercups? there.


Yellow and simple and perfect,
Gleamed their round cups of gold ;
Eight in the line of the trench fire,
Something of love they told.
Something of hope and blessing,
Something of peace and calm,
Of Australia?s sunshine and wattle blooms,
And the one-timed home on the farm.
He gathered the flowers from the trench-
edge,
And sent them to that far land;
To the mother who prayed and waited,
For him and his brothers to stand
Once more ?neath Australian sunshine,
Once more, hand in hand with her ;
? Once more,? growled the khaki-clad
soldier,
As his bombs swelled the battle roar.


While Shepherds
Watched
The church doors stood wide open,
The aisle was softly dim,
Between the rows of pews to sanctuary,
The organist sat waiting to play the open-
ing hymn,
And suppliants here and there bent humble
knee.
Through sanctuary doors the choristers
passed two by two to place.
White garmented, and serious, and slow
As the organ filled with music pouring
richly out to space,
In the loveliest Christmas Hymn of long
ago.


? While Shepherds watched their flocks by
night ?
(Not Kings on gilded thrones),
? The Angel of the Lord came down ?
And told these humble ones
That unto them ! a child was born
To them ! a Christ was given ;
They ! now might clasp their hands and
Themselves inheritors of Heaven.
THE SERMON.
He came, The Christ, ?midst humble
things,
And worked and thought and taught,
And Peers and Ministers and Kings
Were not the folk He sought.
? He had not where so lay His head,?
He toiled midst the purlieus,
Oft slept at night beneath the stars,
Refreshed by heavenly dews.


He raised the fallen, healed the sick,
Reclaimed those gone astray?
His followers do not these things now,
this wise century ;
Religion?oft spells opulence?
Weakness, is trampled on ?
Modesty crushed against the wall;
Forgot?the ? little one ?
Of gutter, ally, swamp and pit,
Forgot the broken heart.
Forgot how near akin to blood
The tears of anguish start
Ere brushed away and hidden.
So preached the parson passionately ?
But they?d grown used, who heard,
Add ere they passed the portico,
Forgotten ! was each word.
While yet! upon the summer air
There seemed to ring, and find
An echo of ? Great joy I bring,?
To you and all mankind.


The Mascot.
Brown and sturdy and bright of eye,
He hovers about the ?camp,?
In the van of the band as the boys go by,
He strides with a martial tramp.
To the officer?s cry of ? Left! right! left!?
You will find him both mom and night,
With eyes agleam and shoulders squared,
Marching with all his might.
Chorus.
He chatters and trots in and out of the
tents,
Or ? yarns ? to the men at his ease;
He calls them his ? cobbers,? his ?pals?
and his ? boys,?
And sits on their shoulders or knees;


And whatever their mood, and whatever
the time,
The ? Mascot ? is sure to please.
His little brown arms slip round their
necks,
His little brown cheeks snuggle theirs,
Into the heart of their lives he gets,
Halving their joys and cares ;
Sad when they?re sad, and glad when
they?re glad,
When they sing he joins in the chorus;
He?s a little ? bit of alright ? and all there
Say the boys, and we know he?s all for
us.
Chorus.


The Coo?ee Call
A ?ammock ?neafch a shady tree,
Another slung ?long side it;
A pair o? lovely girlish eyes
Too full o? love ter ?ide it; ?
A pair o? lovely girlish lips
So full an? soft, an? rosy:
A little girly ?and in mine,
Confidin? snug and cosy:
An? me a takin? blissful sips
From them pure, softly rosy lips ;
An? ah 1 my Gawd ! I?am ?appy.
I came back to Australia
All bandaged, bruised an? ?urt:
I?d done me ?bit,? an? bore the brunt uv it
With ?undreds uv brave fellers ter orders
?ard an? curt;
An? often fur from ? Oommysaryit;?
?Mong dins o? ?ell an? ?eaven


In conflict loudly ?urled ;
The breakin? up o? nations,
The Weedin' uv a world.
An? now ! I ?ave er lips
An? sundry blissful sips;
An now : my Gawd! I?am ?appy.
An? mother?s in the distance
With ?er checkered apron on,
A fussin? in an? out an? up an? down
As proud as enny pecock;
Uv the medal on me breast!
Keeps callin? me, ? ?er brave an? valiant
son; ?
But I?ll break their ?earts w?en shortly
I say I?m going back,
Back inter ?ells own yawnin? brazen
mouth,
Fer the boys we left be?ind us
Seem gain? ter stay he?ind
W?ile we die, to keep the Freedom o?
the South.


An? the little ?ammock near ?er
U?ll be empty once agen,
An? in the checkered apron tears u?ll fall
Her I know ?ow bad they need us,
I can ?ear their ringin? shout,
It?s a coo?ee an? they?ll git the Coo?ee
Call
That floated o?er the ocean
W?en the ? Southland ? was a wreck.
We carried it o?er oragged Gallipoli,
We raised it first at Mena
In old Egypt; now in France ;
It goes like this ! Coo?ee ! coo?ee !
coo?ee!
Norman Bros , Printers, Melbourne.
