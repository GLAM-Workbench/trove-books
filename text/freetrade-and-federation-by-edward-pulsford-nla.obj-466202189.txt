Freetrade and Federation
BY EDWARD PULSFORD.
In this article we propose to consider the results of
Federation on the practical application of the policy of Free-
trade. Remembering that during the past five or six years
the writer has taken the leading part in the controversial
defence of Freetrade truths, it is right, now that many
earnest Freetraders contend that the acceptance of Federation
by New South Wales is equivalent to the abandonment of
Freetrade, that he should especially show the grounds for
maintaining that Australian Federation is distinctly favour-
able to the Freetrade party. It has always been contended
by Freetraders—and with absolute truth—that a fiscal policy
which has for its basis favoritism to classes, is of itself a cor-
rupt policy, and must lead to further corruption in the public
life of the people. If we felt that the federation of these
colonies was destined to lessen the freedom of Australian
trade and commerce, then we should feel constrained to say
that New South Wales must stand clear. We do not fear
this, and are prepared to go ahead and carry our colors with
us.
TRADE THAT CANNOT BE ATTACKED.
The subject naturally divides into two portions. First, the
the trade that, under the Constitution, cannot be attacked,
and second, the trade that may be attacked. To take the
first portion : It is a grand thing to secure a vast trade
against the assaults of implacable foes, and to obtain that
security not for to-day only, but for all time. Let us see how
things stand. At present there are seven tariffs in Austral-
asia, one in each colony ; of these, six are more or less devised
with the object of excluding the goods of other colonies, as
well as with the object of raising revenue. Victoria, by her
tariff, deliberately aims to keep out certain goods from New
South Wales, from Queensland, from Tasmania, from South
Australia, from Western Australia, and from New Zealand,
and these other colonies, with the exception of New South
vVales, arc trying to emulate Victoria by similar efforts of
exclusion. Now, the moment that Federation becomes per-
fected, there would be an end to all this. Victoria would no
longer be able to demand toll on every sheep and bullock
passing the border. New South Wales’ oranges and grapes
would have free course throughout the length and breadth of
Australia. No colony could say that New South Wales’ coal
should be taxed, and the efforts now being made in Victoria
from time to time to restrict our coal trade would come to an
end. The men of New England would breath more freely if
they knew that no grim Customs’ officials stood on the
Queensland border to levy toll on the produce that wordd find
a ready market in Brisbane. The farmers of the Riverina
district would rejoice greatly if they were permitted to have
access to the markets of Victoria and South Australia, instead
of being confined, as at present, to the one market of New
South W T ales. The cry for retaliation against our neighbours
would cease to be heard, because there would be no tariff to
retaliate against. During recent years the high duties of
Victoria have called forth, especially in Tasmania, political
threats of a most painful and embittered description. At
present, restriction upon restriction, retaliation upon retalia-
tion is possible, but the moment Federation is achieved peace
is proclaimed—a peace that thenceforth none may break. If
the people of Australia decide on Federation, it for ever sets
free the volume of trade between the colonies, which even
now, with restrictive duties and only about four millions of
population, reaches to from about ten to twelve millions
sterling a year. Let us fancy what this trade will grow to as
the population gradually rises to 20 or 30 millions, and then
we shall understand what a great and splendid triumph for
Freetrade would have been gained. There are few people
who quite understand that a restrictive tariff grows propor-
tionately less restrictive just as the area of country which it
covers is increased. Thus, suppose all Europe were to become
one big kingdom, then, instead of about twenty tariffs there
would only be one tariff, and the whole of the trade between
the different parts of Europe would be absolutely free ; the
one tariff might be fixed at very high rates, yet undoubtedly
there would be a great advance towards freedom of trade.
Next, suppose all the world, with the exception of Victoria,
became one kingdom, whilst Victoria set up for herself.
There would then be only two tariffs in the whole world ;
they might each run up 500 per cent., but really what would
it matter if they were ? for the world would have arrived at
absolute Freetrade within a minute fraction, although the
tariffs were fixed at higher rates than ever before known.
Again, see how this principle acts in the reverse direction.
Suppose the United States of America were to form themselves
into fifty different Republics, each State becoming a separate
Republic, then at once there would be fifty tariffs, and sup-
posing ten of these were Freetrade tariffs, while each of the
other forty copied the existing American tariff. Somebody
might say that a great advance had been made towards Free-
trade, but we think it will readily be seen that, although
there is no Freetrade tariff at present in America, a change
such as indicated would shackle far more trade than it would
set free.
It is worthy of note that the followers of Mr. Henry George
in this colony are, many of them, opposed to Federation, be-
cause they fear its effects on Freetrade, yet the position we
maintain is ably supported by the (New York) “ Standard,”
the organ of the Single-tax party. In its issue for March 11,
a notice of the proposed Australian Federation is concluded as
follows:
“ Such consolidations of small principalities, like the
Federation of the German principalities and duke-
doms, into one empire, and the unification of the


petty ota,Lea 01 xutiiy intu uuc Kxuguuui, uu much to
advance the cause of Freetrade and civilisation
generally. The division of peoples united by all the
ties of interest and common ancestors, into wretched
little separate political units, whose inhabitants look
on everybody outside their border as enemies, is one
of the bulwarks of protectionism and aristocracy.
The ten or twelve millions sterling of which we have spoken
represents actual trade passing between the colonies in
commodities of their own production and for their own con-
sumption. This is only the starting point; in another 25 years
this exchange of commodities between the colonies will
probably have grown to 50 millions sterling a year, and by
the provisions attaching to federation this great volume of
trade will flow, like a noble river, carrying enrichments and
blessings far and wide. To secure absolutely and for ever
from all possibility of attack so great a proportion of our
trade is a triumph which Freetraders may well be eager to
realise, and of which, when realised, they may justly be
proud. It is also well to remember that every year the pro-
portion of intercolonial trade must increase, whilst the pro-
portion of international trade must decrease. Hitherto,
Australian imports have very largely represented capital
which has been borrowed, or which has been sent out for
investment; but as Australian capital gradually grows suffi-
cient for Australian wants, so will the importation of new
capital gradually fall off, and imports become more and more
the equivalent of our exports. Every year, therefore, the
importance of having secured our intercolonial trade from the
possibility of attack would become more and more apparent.
TRADE THAT MAY BE ATTACKED.
We now come to consider the position of that second sec-
tion of Australian trade—the international—which, under
Federation, would remain open to attack. New South Wales
has hitherto defeated all assaults on the freedom of her trade,
whilst in the other colonies the supporters of free exchange
have undeniably been themselves defeated. It is affirmed,
therefore, that if Federation takes place, the restrictionists of
the federated colonies would unite their forces, and that those
forces would necessarily outnumber the Freetraders of the
federated colonies, even with New South Wales’ majority
thrown in. As a mere sum in arithmetic, known as “ addi-
tion,” we admit the accuracy of the conclusions as far as the
numbers stand to-day. But we wish to go a little bit further :
We want to ascertain whether, after Federation had taken
place, the composition and the numbers of the Restrictionist
and Freetrade parties would remain unaltered, or whether
they would be likely to undergo any radical change, because
it is clear that if the numbers be altered that any addition of
those numbers must be made, not on the basis existing prior
to federation, but on the basis existing after Federation.
Now, who are the people who everywhere constitute the
strength of the party of trade restriction ? They are those
over whose industry the tariff hangs either the reality or the
shadow of protection. Take Victoria. The Agriculturists of
Victoria demanded that barriers be erected against the com-
petition of the maize of New South Wales, the oats of New
Zealand, the fruit of Tasmania, the wheat of South Australia ;
in fact, against all the agricultural and pastoral produce that
surrounding colonies might otherwise be able to supply to the
Victorian consumers. When all those barriers are forever

smashed, and the only basis on which their erection is pos-
sible is a thing of the past, will anyone affirm that the atti-
tude of the Victorian agriculturists on the fiscal question will
remain unaltered ? When the agriculturist in Victoria finds
that there is no tariff barrier to restrain the influx of maize
and sheep from New South Wales, and other produce from
other colonies, will his attitude remain unchanged towards those
other barriers which increase the cost of his machinery, his sad-
dlery, his harness, his clothes, his boots? We assert that the
change will of necessity, most obvious necessity, lead him to re-
consider his attitude, and must drive him from the ranks of
the Restrictionists to the ranks of the Freetraders. It is
after that change has taken place that the time will be ripe
for counting heads, and on that counting we are prepared to
take our chance.
What, we should like to know, will be the effect all round
the border constituencies in New South Wales ? When New
England agriculturists have free access to Queensland they
will no longer cry for ‘ ‘ retaliation; ” when the agriculturists
all along our side of the Murray can look across the river and
know that Victoria is no longer forbidden ground, they will
forget all about “ retaliation.” And as these men drop out
of the ranks of the Restrictionists, the ranks of the Free-
traders in New South Wales must be strengthened.
Then we are absolutely certain that there has been great
exaggeration as to the strength of Restriction in some of the
colonies. Let us take Queensland. About five years ago, the
revenue being short of requirements, it was decided by Mr.
J. R. Dickson, then Treasurer, to propose an all-round ad
valorem duty of 5 per cent. Mr. Dickson himself was an
ardent Freetrader, and he told the writer, in 1887, that he
bitterly regretted the proposal. Mr. Dickson having gone
out of office his successor raised the duty to 7£per cent, again
for the purpose of increasing revenue. The duties are now
15 per cent. The last advance was undoubtedly made rather
for restrictive than for revenue purposes, but it is clear that
the existence of these 15 per cent, duties, especially when
considered in the light of their origin, does not indicate any
strong feeling in favour of restrictive duties.
Then it must be remembered that it is almost impossible to
mention an article in which the interests of all the States
would be alike. The raw material of one is often the manu-
factured article of another, and antagonism at once arises
when one State suffers for the benefit of others. The most
powerful factor operating against a Freetrade tariff would be
the considerable amount of money which the wants of the
Central Government and the States Governments would re-
quire to be raised. This is undoubtedly a difficulty, but it is
not an insuperable one.
At the present time there is undoubtedly a great re-action,
both in Victoria and in Queensland, against the policy of re-
striction, and we are firmly convinced that this re-action will
continue. Finally, we would ask, are the Freetraders of New
South Wales of no weight in regard to the general public
opinion of Australia respecting the fiscal policy of the Federa-
tion? We think they are of weight. We think that they
will be prepared to back up the efforts of their fellow Free-
traders in the other colonies and that working with a will
and with the enthusiasm worthy of noble principles, the
Freetraders of a Federated Australia will succeed in raising
the flag of free exchange to the mast-head of the good ship,
the Commonwealth of Australia.
