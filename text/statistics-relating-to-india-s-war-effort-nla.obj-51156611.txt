PREFACE
A fair amount of statistical material which was collected for
various special purposes during the war has, for security reasons,
remained unpublished so far. These statistics are no longer con-
fidential and, in view of their great interest to the public, the present
compilation is now published for general information.
These statistics have been prepared by Mr. T. P. Chatter)ee,
M.A., m.sc., Assistant Director. The Administrative Intelligence
Room is greatly indebted to Mr. S. Subramanian, m.a.. Statistician,
for his very sound advice in the preparation of the publication in the
absence of the Economic Adviser, Sir Theodore Gregory, Kt., d.sc.,
on long leave.

I. MOBILIZATION OF MANPOWER
Defence Forces
By the middle of 1945, more than 2 million men had been
absorbed by the armed forces although recruitment had remained
throughout on a voluntary basis. It is superfluous to dilate on
the significant part played by the Indian soldier whether in the
field or in the workshop, but it is just as well to mention that but
for the strength of the Indian Army, it would have been a hopeless
task to attempt to meet the severe strain on Empire manpower that
developed during the crucial period of the war.
The casualties suffered by the Indian forces numbered 180,000
of whom one in six was killed besides 6,500 merchant seamen who
were either killed or missing. In addition to the above, as many
as 4,000 civilian casualties were caused by bombing. The casualties
would have been larger still, had it not been for the yeoman service
rendered by the Civil Defence Corps who numbered 82,000 at
one time.
Industrial Employment
After the outbreak of the war the engineering and other
industries directly connected with the war effort steadily increased
their labour force. From a figure of 400,000 in 1939, the number
employed in these industries rose to more than a million in 1945.
The factories producing warlike stores alone employed as many
as 116,000 as compared with a modest 17,000 in 1939.
The other industries were, no doubt, also able to expand their
labour strength but their experience could not be called wholly
exhilarating. The fluctuation in employment in the textile industries
was particularly unencouraging.

II. HOME PRODUCTION
Munitions and other Requirements
India was an important arsenal for the Middle East operations.
In the war period she produced vast quantities of small arms,
artillery ammunition as well as a couple of thousand bombs. She
turned out nearly 10,000 armoured and other special vehicles and
also more than 200,000 other wheeled vehicles. She also supplied
nearly 400 million tailored items, 25 million foot-wears, 37,000 silk
parachutes and 4 million cotton made supply-dropping parachutes.
Shipping built in India during the war consisted of 2,000 small
vessels with a total tonnage of 100,000 tons. A great deal of re-
fitting and repair work was also put through.
The outstanding cases of increased production in regard
to industrial materials were petroleum and electricity. The
production of coal and iron ore was affected by the labour shortage
which was common to all minerals.
Large-scale Manufactures
Under industrial manufactures all items except jute manu-
factures, matches and wheat flour showed some increase. Jute
manufactures declined because of lack of demand, matches owing
to lack of raw materials, while wheat flour declined owing to lack
of supplies for mills in spite of a relatively large crop of wheat.
Agriculture
In the field of agriculture a new and important development was
the drastic reduction in the acreage under cotton so as to make more
land available for food production. The output of cereals which
registered a small increase in 1943-44, however, showed a tendency
to decline in the next year.
The army, on the other hand, were able to show a large increase
ra their output of dairy products.

III. SHIPPING AND FOREIGN TRADE
India does not possess any imposing resources in shipbuilding
but even out of her modest tonnage, the war took a heavy toll
The total losses during the war amounted to over 24,000 tons,
inclusive of country craft. In 1943 alone, over 9,000 tons were
lost from all causes (mainly enemy action and marine risks).
Owing to, among other reasons, the severe curtailment of
available shipping space, India’s external trade showed a considerable
shrinkage. Exports valued at pre-war prices steadily declined from
about Rs. 300 crores to roughly half that amount; and in imports
the fall was steeper still. From nearly Rs. 230 crores the quantum
of imports fell to only slightly more than Rs. 80 crores. Imports
of essential textiles and iron and steel dwindled to nothing. The
quantum of exports was maintained at a relatively high level by
the movement of essential articles of war.

IV. HOME CONSUMPTION
Civilian Consumption
The war created new opportunities of employment and put
additional purchasing power in the hands of a very large section
of the population. On the other hand owing to the first priority
that was given to the needs of the Army, the supplies of essential
articles of consumption to the civilian population were greatly
attenuated. The reduction was particularly drastic in the case of
food-grains and cloth. Before the war the total available supply
of cereals was more than 45 million tons. During the first half
of the war period it was reduced to 43 million tons. This, when
viewed against an increase in population of $ millions a year ought
to show the extent of the undernourishment induced by war con-
ditions on a people already below subsistence level. It is unneces-
sary to refer in this context to the Bengal Famine of 1943. Again,
as against the 6,000 million yards of cloth in supply before the war,
only 3,700 million yards were available in 1942 ; and even two years
later the supplies barely exceeded 5,000 million yards. The entire
output of woollen manufactures was taken over by the Army.
There was a severe reduction in the supplies of essential
building materials and the already inadequate housing was rendered
still more inadequate.

V. INLAND RAILWAY TRANSPORT
Despite the shortage of rolling stock which arose out of the
export of much needed engines and wagons to the theatres of war,
the Indian railways carried a much heavier burden than before,
resulting chiefly from military movements. While the number
of passengers carried increased by 75 per cent viz. from 531 millions
to 927 millions, the number of passenger-miles more than doubled
in six years of war. In other words, while in 1938-39 each passenger
was moved over 35 miles on the average, in 1944-45, the figure
increased to nearly 41 miles.
Again, in regard to goods moved, while civilian merchandise
showed a decrease from 55 million tons to 52 million tons, the total
tonnage moved increased by more than 12 million tons, this
increase being attributable mainly to military traffic. More than
8,000 special trains were run each year during the war for military
personnel and stores.

VI. FINANCE
The remarkable fact about the mobilization of Indian resources
during the emergency was that a very high proportion of the mount-
ing war expenditure was met out of current revenue. Out of the
relatively huge figure of Rs. 5,48 crores of total revenue expenditure
in the last year of war, nearly 75 per cent came from taxes and other
Government revenue. One has only to compare this figure (for
a poor country like India) with the corresponding figure of 50 per
cent and less for many a richer country. Taxes alone accounted
for more than 50 per cent.
A point of great importance is the large increase in
the yield of indirect taxes on both commodities and services.
Thus the proceeds of customs, central excises and similar levies
more than doubled between 1942-43 and 1945-46 while the receipts
from Posts and Telegraphs, Railways etc. which had been increasing
steadily from the outbreak of the war brought in an additional too
crores of rupees in 1944-45.
Direct taxes were also firmed up so as to yield a larger
revenue. It may be pointed out that the share of personal incomes
taken away as tax showed a fast increase during the war. In 1939-40
an income of Rs. 5,000 was cut down by only 3 per cent by the tax,
but by the end of the war, the proportion of income taken away
as tax had increased to 4 per cent. The corresponding figures for an
income of a lakh of rupees per annum were 25 and 47 respectively
and for an income of Rs. 30 lakhs, 57 and 92 respectively.
Companies were also made to play their due part. In addition
to taxes on company profits which came in the usual way, the excess
profits tax which made its appearance in 1940-41, turned out to
be more and more useful and by 1944-45 it brought in as much
as Rs. 92 crores.
However much the taxes, direct and indirect, could be screwed
up there still remained a gap which could be bridged only if
sufficient money could be obtained by borrowing. With a view,
among other things, to the conservation of the savings of the
community for this essential purpose, the control of capital issues
was undertaken in 1941-42. With effective powers in their hands
for preventing the investment of funds in unwelcome directions,
Government were able to raise all the money they wanted from
the market. But it should not be forgotten that behind all the
money thus raised there lay a host of unfulfilled wants and, what
is more, a cumulative deterioration of highly valuable industrial
equipment.
