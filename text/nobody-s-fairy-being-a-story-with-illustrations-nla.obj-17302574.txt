COME and sit out in
the garden, and I
will tell you a fairy story.
Soon the moon will rise,
and if we call very softly
and sweetly, perhaps the
fairies will come and dance
for us. Now just snuggle
up each side of me, and
we will watch for them-
What is my Story about?
It is a simple story of a lonely
fairy, whom we shall call
“Nobody s Fairy, because at first
nobody wanted her, but now that
people are beginning to know her
they call her by many names.

COME call her Charity ; some,
Pity ; some Sweetness, for she
is all of these; but nobody ever really
knows how to say her name until
they have done something they did
not want to do —something for some
one else ; until they have learnt the
lesson of Idealism.
Well , now for my story. Once upon
a time, in “Beautiful Land of Never
Was,” there lived a fairy who married
a mortal. Now this, as, of course,
you know, is not allowed by the
fairies, so when these two came
before the Fairy Queen with their
tiny daughter, asking to be pardoned,
the Fairy Queen said to them, “Your
child must live in the mortal world,
since she is of mortal shape, and she
must teach the Humans the lesson of
Idealism. She will then have proved
herself a worthy subject of the ‘Land
of Never Was,’ and you shall all live
and be pardoned ”

CO Nobody’s Fairy was carried
away by the fairies to a far-off
spot in the “Golden Country,” which
is so called because nearly everything
in it is golden : wattle bloom, sour-
sobs, dandelions, and corn shine out
everywhere, and gold is in the earth
But best of all is the golden sunshine,
which is God s gift to every one, for it
shines on all alike.
Nobody’s Fairy awoke one morn
and found herself in a field of corn,
and she was a little surprised ; especi-
ally when a queer little creature sat
peering at her. It was only a dear
little bunny, but at first she did not
know this. Soon, though, she made
friends with the little “Billie Blue
Gums,” “Gum Nuts,” “Gum Blos-
soms,” and all the birds and little
bush creatures. And meanwhile she
grew, and learned to walk and dance
by the little creeks, and she ate blue
plums, and had a beautiful time.

She said good-bye
. . . and set out
upon her journey


CHE wore no clothes —she needed
. none —so she dressed in flowers
and looked at her reflection in a still
pool, and thought she was rather nice.
What was she like ? Why, just
like any little human —round and
pink and adorable, with golden hair
and big dark eyes. The only differ-
ence was that she had little wings
sprouting from her shoulders.
The birds, beasts, and little bush
people taught her all they could about
the world, and she learned to love it
more and more every day. So as
soon as she was old enough she set
out upon her journey to teach the
people who lived in cities, and
thought themselves so fine, to love
the simple, beautiful things of life.
“For then,” said she, “I shall meet
a Prince, and perhaps he will make me
his Princess, and then I shall be able
to teach every one the story of
Idealism.”

But oh, how
disappointed she
was in it all!


CHE then said good-bye to all her
little bush friends, and started
upon her journey, full of hope and
After travelling a long way, gather-
ing flowers as she went, she came to
the City, and entered it, and walked
through the streets. But, oh, how
disappointed she was in it all! She
had expected such splendid things
of the City, and all she saw was mass
upon mass of unlovely buildings,
men stealing from each other, women
neglecting their crying children, and
everywhere want and misery or luxury
and selfishness. People turned,
jeering and laughing, when she tried
to tell them about the beautiful world.
Only one did not laugh, and he was
a poor street boy, ragged and dirty,
yet his eyes were beautiful with
honesty and goodness. But poor
Nobody’s Fairy saw only that he was
one of the City people, who all
seemed to mock at her, and in despair
she fled from the town until at last
she came to the cool open country.


i »*r^
The spirits of
the gums came
down to her


I—l ERE she cast herself down on
the moss beneath some gums,
weeping bitterly, and feeling that
her heart was surely broken. And
the Spirits of the Gum Trees, which
are silent in the daytime when we
see them, though they sigh at night,
were so sorry for her that they came
down and whispered to her to take
heart; but she heard them not.
So when at last she arose wearily,
it was to turn her face towards the
distant hills, saying, “Surely that is
the end of the world, and when I
come to that, the fames will have to
take me. Then on she went, and
when she came to the top of the
highest hill, which, of course, was
not the end of the world at all, she
saw some beautiful butterflies, and
in her loneliness she called to them to
take her up with them, up into the
blue, blue sky, away from all her
troubles.


In her loneliness
she called to
the butterflies
±


\IOW, there came a fairy to her,
saying, “Oh, Nobody’s Fairy,
you must not be lonely, for if you
will, you can be Everybody’s Fairy,
and in making those poor people in
the City happy you will find tfie
greatest happiness there is in the
world. Go back, go back ; try again ;
do the thing you do not want to do
and you will find a happiness that
nobody can give or buy for you.
That is Love. Love of others, love
of the glorious world, love of little
children, love of God. Learn to
love, for you cannot know love your-
self until you have learned how to
love.”
So Nobody’s Fairy went back a
little more humbly, a little more
gently, and by reason of this she was
able to see more clearly what was
needed to give happiness to those
around her.

Nobody's Fairy went
back to give happiness
to those around her


CHE saw that to talk to them of the
beauty of Nature, which they had
never known, in the midst of their
own distress was futile, but to do
some kind action —to take the baby
from some tired mother’s arms, to
bind up the hurt of a crying child —-
these things were Humanity, which
is another name for Nobody’s Fairy*
This gave people confidence in her,
so that they listened when she spoke
of all that she had learned.
And all this while the ragged Street
Boy was watching over Nobody’s
Fairy, and wherever she went he
followed, always ready to do
Humanity’s bidding—helping the
weak and aged, serving always, kind
and good to all.
Travelling thus, they came through
the City and through the Plains, and
at last they rested. And now
Nobody’s Fairy looked at the Street
Boy as she had not done before.


She told them
of all she
had learned


said she, “your eyes are
v so beautiful that Ido not
seem to see your ragged clothes when
I look at them. And how you have
grown !’’ Then the Street Boy
said to her, “Oh, Nobody’s F,airy,
you too are grown in wisdom and
beauty, and I will never leave your
side, but will follow you down to the
sea, which is the end of our journey.”
And then they knew that they loved
each other, and embraced, and were
very glad— so glad that the little
bush people came out and rejoiced
with them and gave a banquet in
their honor.
But soon it was all over, and they
were travelling on towards the sea,
where all the rivers meet.
When at last they came to it and
stepped in, lo! they were trans-
formed, and stood there a beautiful
Prince and Princess, for such they
were by reason of their good works.

And Nobody s
Fairy looked at
the Street Boy


THE fairies came all about them,
rising up out of the waves ; every
sunbeam on the water became a fairy
and like a cloud they rose, carrying
Nobody’s Fairy and the Boy with
them up through the Sunset and on
to the “Beautiful Land of Never
Was, ’ and there they are living
happily to this very day.
And that is the end of my story.
See, the moon has set and the fairies
are gone to sleep, and ’tls time you,
too, tucked in your toes, my little
friends. But before you go I want
to say that if you look into the eyes of
all you know (for eyes are “ the
windows of the soul”), and they are
honest, and beautiful, and kind, it
does not matter what ragged clothes
the owner may wear. And all the
things I have told you about Nobody’s
Fairy are true ; she has learned her
lesson, and you, too, will learn it —
the lesson of Idealism.

Away to the
Beautiful Land

QO when it is hard to believe in the
beautiful things, when you are
out in the world, think of Nobody’s
Fairy and the Street Boy, and take
heart and try again. They will help
you, for they are always watching you
and hoping you will win.
So, good-night, my young friends,
and may you, my little girls, grow up
good and beautiful, and find your
fairy princes; and you, my little
boys, grow worthy of them —well
versed in chivalry and all the virtues
that make good princes.
