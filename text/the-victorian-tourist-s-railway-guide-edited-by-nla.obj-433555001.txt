THIS School offers to a limited number of Scholars greater advantages than large public
Schools. The classes are smaller, and the different subjects of the curriculum are in
the hands of a specialist who teaches only that subject, and teaches it throughout the school.
The modern languages are taught conversationally from the kindergarten to the matriculation
form. Music is taught as a subject of the general course free of charge in the lower classes.
The School is inspected annually by independent examiners In all the subjects of the School
course, as well as in accomplishments, and a report printed in the prospectus. There are six
exhibitions, gold and silver medals awarded annually to the most successful candidates. Two
pupils of the principal have gained exhibitions in modern languages at the Melbourne Uni-
versity. During the last three years nine pupils have passed the matriculation examination,
whilst some have qualified in subjects, taking in all sixty-four passes and twelve honours in
English, French, and German. In six years there has only been one case of sickness, and
when the sanitary inspection of Australian schools was made Cornelia College was declared a
model institution. There are daily gymnastics, free of charge, given in a richly equipped
gymnasium furnished with Ling’s apparatus. The boarders are allowed between school hours
the constitutional advantage of home life. Healthy out-door exercise is provided in the
tennis-court of the college and at the farm at Mulgrave, which also affords both riding and
driving, as Saturday recreations.

INTRODUCTION.
'WHSIiHE purpose of this book is to place before Victoria and
(|Sp! Victorian visitors and travellers generally a clear and
/I Jy 1 succinct description of our railway system from the date
of its origin, to its latest developments. A brief history
of the railways will be given, and then the whole system
will be divided, as it divides naturally, into various great branches.
The nature of the accommodation will be described, and the
character of the country traversed by each separate line. The
great overland lines will first be dealt with, that which junctions
on to the New South Wales system at Albury being taken
first; and in connection therewith a glimpse will be given
across the border, to the main route to Sydney; and also
to that other line which, turning due north from Harden,
joins with the Great Western line of the older colony at
Blayney, runs thence to Bourke, on the Darling River, and
so makes connection between Melbourne and the great pastoral
areas of Australia. The Adelaide line will next be discussed;
and due attention will be paid to such important centres as
Ballarat, Ararat, Horsham, and Serviceton on the edge of
the great desert. Next important, perhaps, in its future possi-
bilities, if not in its present conditions, is the line which strikes
the Murray at Echuca, and whose many branches traverse so
vast an area of our northern agricultural country, Bendigo is of
course the main centre on this line, though Echuca, and Denili-
quin, the terminus of the private line beyond, are in no sense to
be despised. And after come the great Eastern and Western lines,
the one with its two arms striking through the heart of the rich
Gippsland country, the other skirting Port Phillip Bay to Geelong,


and then making due westward through Sir Thomas Mitchell’s old
Australia Felix.
I venture to express a hope that in this work the whole of the
resources, picturesque and utilitarian, will be placed in a clear and
attractive manner before general readers. No instructions were
received, and no desire has been evinced to enter into competition
with any “ Guides ” or handbooks already in existence, nor in any
way to supersede the official “Book Time Table,” published
monthly at the very moderate cost of twopence. In fact we
would advise all purchasers of this book at the railway bookstalls
to ask also for the “ Book Time Table.” These two taken
together will supply the traveller with all the information that can
possibly be required. An idea of the general contour, aspect,
resources, and beauties of the colony will be obtained from this
Guide, and fully detailed information as to routes, times and rates
of travelling from the official time table.
I must also acknowledge my obligations to the proprietors of
the Argus for permission to reprint many extracts from contribu-
tions made to and published in their columns.

THE PURPOSE OF RAILWAYS.
Jrrf Jl s CONSIDER this among the most important acts of my
fjl life, second only to that of signing the Declaration of
o Independence —if second to that.” These words were
uttered by Charles Carroll on the memorable occasion
of the turning of the first sod of the first railway in
the United States. The date was the 4th of July, 1828, and
Carroll was chosen to perform this important initiatory act
because he happened to be the only survivor of those who had
appended their names to the immortal scroll, which is the Magna
Charta of the United States. Truly the establishment of the
railway system in that great country was worthy to rank in
importance almost with such an epoch-making event as the
Proclamation of Independence. It is not too much to say that
the railway has made the great North American Republic. The
astonishing strides the latter has, during the last sixty years or so,
taken in material prosperity, until what was then the abode of
but comparatively a handful of settlers, has now become the
mightiest industrial nation of the earth, would have been
impossible without the iron road. When the genius of George
Stephenson adapted the power of steam to the purposes of
locomotion, he foresaw that he was bringing about a tremendous
revolution in modes of transport; but, with all the foresight of
genius, he could hardly have dreamt of the facility for opening up
new countries which his invention would afford. The Americans
in the task of developing their enormous territory have, with
their usual keen sagacity, fully availed themselves of an agent
which has incalculably increased the sum of human power and
possibility in all material directions.
The colonists of Australia also have not been behind-hand in


recognising that, if the inland portions of this continent are
to be opened up, and their resources developed, railways must be
carried into them, connecting them with the great coastal centres.
To realise what the railway has already done for Australia, it is
only necessary to try and picture how far settlement would have
proceeded on this continent without this means of transport.
Unblessed with a natural system of water-ways—the only other
method of conveyance which can ever compete with the iron
road, or stand substitute for it—these now flourishing and
wealthy colonies would have consisted of a few isolated coastal
settlements. The vast inland areas of this continent which, by
the agency of the iron road, are being won from the savage
freedom of nature, and made to yield of their treasures for the
benefit of man, would, were that agency lacking, remain and
—probably for ever—in their pristine fruitlessness. It is not
possible to conceive how, without railways, more than the
merest fringe of Australia, with its immense waterless wilds,
could ever have been brought under the subjugation of man.
But as things happily are, we see the railway systems of all the
colonies being extended in all directions as fast as financial
exigencies will permit. A chain of communication by direct lines
has been effected between the capitals of Queensland, New South
Wales, Victoria, and South Australia; and now it is possible to
travel by train from Brisbane to Broken Hill, passing completely
through three colonies, and partly through a fourth. '
This connection is a great achievement for a young land, and
one, moreover, the accomplishment of which has been fully
justified by the springing-up of settlements along the iron road
wherever it has been carried. Other great trunk lines, to join
distant portions of the continent, are projected—some are partly
surveyed ; and the plan is being gradually worked out of giving
all the habitable parts of Australia inter-communication by means
of a gigantic net-work of railways, covering and opening up the
whole land from sea to sea. Each main line will connect the
principal centres, and from the sub-centres along the trunk will
radiate branch lines, bringing into the general plan of inter-
communication the settlements which are off the direct route.


THE GAUGE QUESTION.
SMOST serious drawback, however, to the easy inter-
change of commodities and to the convenience of
travellers, which the connecting railway systems of
the Australian Colonies should afford, exists in the
differences of gauge between the lines of the several
adjacent Colonies. The break of gauge is a hindrance to through
traffic, which even the lay mind can to some extent realise, while
to the railway expert it is the abomination of abominations, and
chiefly because it is entirely unnecessary. Long ago the “ Battle
of the Gauges ” was fought in England ; but had not Brunei
been jealous of George Stephenson, that costly and wholly
fruitless contest might have been avoided. Brunei stood out for
a “ broad ” gauge of 7 feet, and persuaded the great company to
which he was engineer, to allow him to lay their lines accordingly.
He was permitted to do so, and dearly has that mistake cost the
Great Western Railway Company. The rest of the English
companies adopted Geo. Stephenson’s gauge of 4 feet 8| inches
between the rails, and the one which preferred Brunei’s plan, has
long ago admitted its error by re-laying its lines to accord with
the general standard. A battle of the gauges is impending, in
Australia, the unavoidable result of lamentable professional jealousy
between the engineers who originally planned the lines of the several
colonies, or of equally lamentable want of foresight on their part.
And the conflict is likely to be the more bitter inasmuch as colony
will be pitted against colony. South Australia will be in the un-
enviable position of a house divided against itself, for within her
own borders she has two gauges on her railways. It is true that the
line from Adelaide to Melbourne is of the same width throughout,
thus admitting of trains passing without let over the border
between these two colonies. But on the Northern line of the
South Australian system, a change is made from the sft. 3m.


gauge to the 3ft. 6in. The gauge of the Victorian railways is
sft. 3in. throughout—a width suitable to the general character of
the country —but this does not coincide with the New South
Wales gauge of 4ft. B^in. —mark the slightness of the difference—
consequently, under existing circumstances, all goods and
passengers passing from the one colony to the other have to be
transhipped at the junction between the two systems. The same
difficulty occurs at the junction of the New South Wales system
with that of Queensland, the gauge adopted in the latter colony
being 3ft. 6in. The necessity for uniformity to admit the
conveyance of passengers on long journeys from one colony to
the other without the inconvenience of having to change trains,
and particularly to obviate the delay and expense contingent upon
the transhipping of goods in their passage over the border, is
becoming imperative with the development of the colonies and
the attendant natural increase of traffic between them, and the
longer the difficulty is allowed to remain, the worse it becomes,
for each colony is meanwhile increasing its railway system without
regard to those of the others. It has been suggested that a
uniform gauge should be decided upon once for all, by agreement
between the various colonies, and that the cost of conforming
with the standard thus fixed should be apportioned equitably
among the colonies concerned. The 3ft. 6in. gauge is out of the
question for main trunk lines, and as the sft. 3m. gauge is already
adopted in two colonies, that standard would probably be chosen
in preference to the 4ft. gauge which is at present only used in
one. But from whatever point the vexed question of how to bring
about uniformity is regarded, it bristles with difficulties. It may
be argued that increased facilities for the passage of goods from
one colony to the other would result in a disastrous war of rates,
and there is no question but that in some cases keen competition
would ensue between the colonies for one another’s traffic—
indeed, such competition already exists.


A BRIEF RETROSPECT.
HE history of the establishment and extension of the
railway system in any country is, in nearly all cases, the
ji\ jJjp* history of the most progressive epoch in its existence.
This is especially true of new colonies, where the iron
horse is the harbinger of civilisation, the precursor of
settlement, and the herald of industrial development. It has been
well said that the locomotive has “ changed the face of the earth ; ”
and much as the railway system has done to revolutionize the
whole course of trade and even the conditions of life in the
Old World, in its adoption in the more recently acquired territories
of the American, African, and Australian continents, we see the
full extent of the benefit to be derived from the use of the steam
motor. Let the whistle of the locomotive once be heard in the
wilds of an unsettled country, and the freedom and loneliness of
its pristine savagery are gone for ever. The great work of re-
claiming the waste places of the earth, and bringing them into a
state of cultivation for the service of man, now being carried on
so rapidly, and which seems to be the peculiar province of the
Anglo-Saxon genius, would be impossible at anything like the
present rate of progress save by the agency of the iron road.
It.was on September 27th, 1825 —ever memorable day!—that
the first railway for steam locomotion was opened in England.
At that period Australia was a distant, neglected, and unexplored
land, and this now great and growing colony of Victoria was then
“ neither born nor thought of.” The establishment of the railway
system in this colony followed upon the enormous impetus given
to the development of the country by the discovery of gold. The
few pastoralists who, before that awakening of the colony into new
life, occupied parts of the country with their flocks, managed to


jog along without feeling the need of cheap and rapid means of
transj>ort. Hut when the “diggings” “broke out” at Ballarat
and Bendigo, speedy and inexpensive communication between
those then swarming centres of population and the coast
became a pressing necessity. It is not surprising, therefore, to
find that the lines of railway first projected to run inland were
designed to effect a connection between the goldfields and
the sea.
The first railways in the colony, however, were the Hobson’s
Bay lines, now forming integral portions of the present suburban
system. On September 13th, 1854, the first line in Victoria—
one connecting Flinders Street with Port Melbourne —was
opened, and in May, 1857, the Hobson’s Bay Company had
formed a connection by rail between the metropolis and St. Kilda.
This corporation subsequently acquired the lines, constructed by
another company, from Flinders Street to Brighton, opened in
December, *859, thus providing Melbourne with a suburban
service on the south side of the Yarra, and from Richmond to
1 lawthorn, opened in October, iB6O. The foresight and enterprise
shown by the Hobson’s Bay Company was rewarded by complete
success ; and since, in pursuance of the fixed policy of State
ownership of railways, these lines, amounting in all to 1 6}4 miles
m length, were taken over by the Government, they have proved
to be the best paying portions of the whole system.
Towards the end of 1853, a private company made a start with
a line to run from Melbourne to Geelong, a distance of 45
miles. This work was completed, and the railway opened on
June 17th, 1857. The next step was to connect Geelong with
the gold-mining centre of Ballarat, and in April, 1862, the first
train ran the distance of 54 miles separating these two important
places. As early as 1855, the policy of the State ownership of
the railways had been determined in Victoria, and the Legislature
refused to grant an Act for the construction of the last-named
line, the Government carrying out the work. Meanwhile another
private corporation, the Melbourne, Mount Alexander, and Murray
River Railway Company, having obtained powers to construct a
line from the capital, via Bendigo to Echuca, on the Murray, a


distance of 156 miles, had managed to get into financial difficulties,
from which it was extricated only by handing over the undertaking
to the State. The Government, therefore, took this enterprise
also in hand, and the construction of the two main lines, Geelong
to Ballarat, and Melbourne to Sandhurst, proceeded simultaneously.
The necessary authorisation having been obtained from Parliament,
tenders were called for early in 1858, and Ballarat and Bendigo
were both connected with the metropolis within the same twelve-
month, the last section on the latter trunk—from Kyneton to
Sandhurst (or Bendigo as it is now re-named), a length of 44 miles
—being opened for traffic in October, 1862. The distance by
rail, from Melbourne to Bendigo, is miles, and this line
formed the nucleus of the northern system of the Victorian rail-
ways. The extension from Bendigo to filchuca, miles,
remained in abeyance for some little time; but Melbourne
was by this route connected with the Murray before the end of
1864, and the colony was thus traversed by the iron road from
end to end. At Echuca the Victorian system has been connected
with the line of a private company running 45 miles into New
South Wales to Deniliquin, and tapping at a convenient point the
trade of an important agricultural district in the neighbouring
colony. A fine iron viaduct carries the rails over the Murray
River, and the gauge being the same on the Deniliquin and
Moama Railways as on the Victorian system, a through traffic has
been established.
Quite a small railway “ boom ” set in while the State was carry-
ing on the construction of the lines to the gold-mining centres.
The pulse of the colony having been quickened up to fever
rate by the finding of the precious metal, expectation ran high in
all directions, and schemes, possible and impossible, of railway
construction, were mooted. One ambitious project deserves
particular mention. About the year 1859, a company was formed
to make a railway from Melbourne to Essendon, with the view of
its ultimate extension to the Gulf of Carpentaria ! In the follow-
ing year the line was opened to Essendon, 5 miles from Melbourne,
as a step on the long road; but the bold plan of running from
south to north of the continent was at that point abandoned.


The company which embarked upon this enterprise shared the
fate of all the other private corporations formed for railway
purposes in Victoria, and their property passed into the hands
of the State. In the year 1867 there were 271 miles of railway
in the colony.
The outcry from the two great goldfield centres for railway
facilities having been satisfied, a trunk line was next constructed
along the then most familiar inland route —the road to Sydney—
and the north-eastern main line was opened to Seymour,
miles from Melbourne, in August, 1872, and was completed to
Wodonga, a town close to the northern border, and 187 miles
from the metropolis, in November of the following year; but it
was not until 10 years later that a junction was effected with the
New South Wales system at Albury. In the first place, the latter
colony had a much longer length of line to construct to reach the
same point on the Murray, the distance from Sydney to Albury
being 386 miles. But even after the line from the New South
Wales capital reached the border, three years were allowed to
elapse before the connection was made. This delay was owing to
jealousies of one sort and another between the two colonies, and
disputes as to the exact point of meeting. These difficulties at
length having been disposed of, and a bridge across the Murray
having been erected at joint expense, the junction was effected at
Albury on 14th June, 1883, the occasion being celebrated with
great eclat and enthusiasm, every speaker at the grand banquet*
held in honour of the event, welcoming the connection as
inevitably tending towards federation ; and the junction of the
railway system of the two colonies was likened in importance to
the connection of the Union with the Central Pacific railroads in
the United States at Promontory Point, in Utah, which event
took place on icth May, 1869.
The next most noteworthy event in the history of the Victorian
railways was the establishment of through communication with
the capital of South Australia. The Ballarat line was continued
westwards, and completed in succession to Beaufort (August, 1874),
Ararat (April, 1875), Stawell (April, 1876), Murtoa (December,.
1878), Horsham (February, 1879), Uimboola (July, 1882), and


Serviceton (January 19th, 1887); the last-named town, 286
miles from Melbourne, being the point on the South Australian
border where the line from Adelaide connects. The distance
from the one capital to the other by rail is miles, and as
the gauge is the same throughout, it was thus made possible
to establish uninterrupted through traffic between the two
colonies.
As the main lines gradually advanced into the back country,
branches and cockspurs were made in all directions, some of
the former connecting two parts of the main system, and forming
alternative and shorter routes to various centres. The most
notable achievement of this kind was the opening of a direct
route from Melbourne to Ballarat by the bridging of the gap of
Imiles between Bacchus Marsh and Ballan. This work was
completed in December, 1889, and the journey to Ballarat and
Adelaide was thus shortened by miles.
The general trend of extension, however, has been to the
north-west of the colony, following the dip of the country from
the highlands about Ballarat towards the Murray River and the
interior basin of the continent. Although some parts of the
colony are better served with railways than others, the expansion
-of the system has on the whole been fairly general. Naturally
the country easiest of access and most promising of aspect was
first settled ; and wherever a settlement of any size has sprung
up, its inclusion in the railway system has followed very much
as a matter of course. But the construction of the lines has
generally been determined on the plan of encouraging settle-
ment, for, in some parts of the colony, occupation of the land and
utilisation of the soil would be impossible without railway facilities.
For example, Gippsland, which forms the eastern portion of the
colony, was, on account of its mountainous and densely timbered
character, a terra ificognita long after the western country —
Australia Felix, as it was called in contra-distinction —was gener-
ally settled, and millions of acres lay awaiting reclamation from
uselessness. The axe had to be plied vigorously before the land
could be cleared for settlement; and, without means of access to
the market, the pioneer settler could not exist. The railway has

now been carried some way into this difficult country ; but the
system in the eastern portion of the colony will have to be largely
extended before that part is brought under general occupation.
It may be said that the railway has stimulated settlement wherever
it has been carried in Victoria, particularly in the north-western
districts. As the lines have been pushed on, the settler has gone
ahead of them farther and farther afield ; and as the richer and
more accessible country has become occupied, he has further
and further encroached upon the more mountainous and less
promising wilderness.
While railway advantages were being accorded to the country
districts, Melbourne was being provided with a suburban system
which has brought nearly all the principal environs into communi-
cation with the main streets of the city.
As showing the growth of the railway system of Victoria, it may
be said that, on June 30th, 1872, there were 313 miles of railway
open, which had cost not quite eleven millions sterling to con-
struct. On June 30th, 1882, there were 1,355 nriles open, the
total capital expenditure on which amounted to not quite twenty
millions; and on June 30th, 1891, there were 2,763 miles open,
while the cost for building and all equipment amounted to some-
thing over thirty-six millions, being an average of per
mile. Construction of new lines has of late years been carried on
at an increasing ratio, as may be seen from the following table; —
But the champion railway year was 1877, in which 311 miles were
added to the 620 then open, an augmentation of fifty per cent.


GENERAL INFORMATION.
Nip|||pHE General Manager of the largest railway in the United
Kingdom, in an able work explaining the method of
jtj jj V conducting the great concern of which he has charge,
says : —“ The railway in its present phase of develop-
ment enters so intimately into the social life of the
community in its every detail, and has become so potent a factor
in its every movement and operation —whether of business or
pleasure—that it must clearly be material for every individual to
know something of the great agency which does so much for his
happiness and welfare, and to realise clearly what are its obliga-
tions and responsibilities towards himself, and what he has a right
to expect from it.” If all this be true with regard to the
inhabitants of the British Isles, where the railways are' all private
property, how much more closely do the remarks quoted apply to
the case of a railway system owned and worked by the State, as is
that of Victoria. Every person in the colony is a part proprietor
in this great business, and consequently should be interested
in learning how the vast property in which he has a share is
controlled and managed; therefore it is not considered outside
the scope of this publication, to give some general particulars
regarding the Victorian Railways,
Finance.

The debenture capital upon which interest was payable stood,
on June 30th, 1891, at ,£32,949,606, but of that sum an amount of
something over half a million then remained unexpended. On
the 7th of July another million was raised. The remainder of the
thirty-six millions and a third expended in construction and
equipment up to that date was made up of amounts received
from the consolidated revenue. The debenture capital accounts
are rather complicated, and to explain them in detail, or enumerate
the various loans would be out of place in what aims to be a plain
and easily-to-be-understood statement of the financial position of
the railways. On that head it must suffice to say that on the
bulk of the loan capital— a sum of nearly nineteen and a half
millions —4 per cent, interest has to be paid, while earlier loans of
over two and four millions each, bear interest at 5 and per
cent, respectively. The latest money borrowed has been obtained
at 3J2 per cent., and it would be well if the total charge under
the head of interest could be reduced to that figure. The last
annual report states that the saving to the colony by the conver-
sion of loans during the past seven years has amounted to about
one million sterling.
Gradients.
The ruling grade on the Victorian railway system is 1 foot in
50 feet, but on several of the branch lines it is as steep as x in 40
—a very heavy pull for an engine with a heavy load. Taking them
throughout, the lines in Victoria are, owing to the irregularities
of the country traversed, prolific of steep gradients, thereby
militating against fast running of trains. And the most difficult
portion of the colony for level railway construction yet remains
to be developed. The early pioneers naturally selected the


flat and accessible parts for settlement in preference to the
mountainous wilds ; and it is only within the last few years that,
the easiest country being now occupied and provided with
railways, the Legislature has accepted the principle of carrying
the lines into the more difficult parts.

An especialty fine work is the viaduct recently opened con-
necting Spencer Street and Flinders Street Stations. It is about
half a mile long, and is built in a most endurable style in brick-
work, iron and steel. This viaduct enables the railway traffic to
be carried on between the two termini without the slightest
hindrance to the heavy road traffic crossing the Yarra and passing
to and from the wharves off Flinders Street. Its cost and
dimensions are stated in the above list of principal works.
Another striking edifice in connection with the railways
is the building comprising the chief offices of the Depart-
ment in Spencer Street, and adjacent to the main terminal
station. This is a commanding, commodious and majestically
proportioned structure, four storeys high, built in the Italian
style of architecture. It has a frontage to Spencer Street


of 430 feet, while the north and south wings each have a
depth of 150 feet. The basement is 13 feet high, and the ground
floor 20 feet, while the first and second floors are both 18 feet
high. The main building is of brick and stucco, but the three
principal entrances are of Stawell stone. There are 137 rooms,,
exclusive of lavatories, strong and store rooms. The corridors are
12 feet wide, and the staircases are of bluestone. Two passenger
and two freight elevators make ascents and descents easy. A group
of statuary upon the main pediment represents Science, while over
the principal entrance the figures of Britannia and Victoria are
represented supporting the crown between them. Other statues
placed over the entrances portray respectively Engineering,
Architecture, Commerce, Pasturage, and Agriculture. The first
floor contains the Minister’s and Commissioners’ offices, board
room, and accommodation for the principal officers. The second
floor is occupied principally by draftsmen in the technical depart-
ments, and the ground floor and basement floor, being the most
accessible, by those officers who have to deal with the public.
Ample provision has been made for the lithographic printers*
contractors’ rooms, etc. The contractor for the building was
Mr, James Moore, and the amount of the contract was about
Bearing in mind the excellence of the design of this
work, as evidenced in the execution, it must in justice be stated
that the plans were prepared in the Department, under the direc-
tion of the late Engineer for Existing Lines.
At the principal extra-metropolitan towns, and places where a
large railway business is done, special station buildings have been
erected, as at Ballarat, Castlemaine, Bendigo, and Maryborough.
The original station at Ballarat was erected about thirty years ago,
and has been altered and added to from time to time. It is in
the Italian style of architecture, with a slate roof. Recently a
large addition has been made on the “ down ” side, affording
ample accommodation for booking, waiting, and refreshment
rooms, porters, purveyor’s residence, and out-offices. The Castle-
maine station was also erected about thirty years ago, the material
being brick, with granite dressings. The building is in the
Italian style, and contains booking office, waiting rooms, parcels


office, station master’s quarters, refreshment rooms, and out-offices,
with a verandah conveniently covering the platform. The original
station at Bendigo is similar to that at Castlemaine, but on the
“up ” side at the former place a new building has been recently
erected of similar design, to give accommodation required by the
increased traffic. A footbridge of iron connects the two platforms.
At Maryborough a new station has been erected of brick, with
cement dressings, in the Queen Anne Rennaisance style, and
providing the necessary offices and waiting rooms.
Among other notable buildings belonging to the Railway
Department are the new workshops at Newport and the goods
sheds at Spencer Street, the latter remarkable for their extent.
The goods yard at the principal terminus is necessarily a very
busy place, for to this centre comes the bulk of the products of
the country districts intended either for distribution in the
metropolis preparatory to home consumption, or for export from
the port.
Of the various institutions which run in connection with the
railways, Cobb and Co. is perhaps the most important, though so
general now is the ramification of lines throughout the colony,
that Cobb’s great day may be said to be passed.
After Cobb came Cook, the tourists’ friend—name most
familiar now to tourists throughout the world. Cook came down
in Australia, having mastered all other continents, about five
years ago, and speedily did very great work in opening up tourists’
resorts, and popularising many railway lines.
For the convenience of tourists and the general travelling
public, an arrangement has been made with Messrs. Thos. Cook
and Son, agents, whereby that firm is empowered to issue at their
central office in Melbourne (82 Swanston Street), any class of
ticket for the Victorian Railways, and to book passengers over the
Victorian lines to places outside the colony. This arrangement,
we need hardly say, is very generally availed of, particularly by
that class of tourists who desire to travel at ease, and save them-
selves the annoyances inseparable from the petty details of a
journey.


Various Insurance Companies are willing to take any risk of
travellers in Victoria, and it need hardly be said that the Railway
Department does all that is possible to facilitate this class of
business.

THE RAILWAYS OF VICTORIA.
SUBURBAN LINES.
BESPITE the occasional and ephemeral cry of “ hard
1 times,” in which the inhabitants see fit to luxuriously
I indulge now and again, statistics, with their irrefutable
_ logic, show that the folk of this colony enjoy a unique
prosperity compared with the dwellers in other parts of
the British Empire ; and when a people is on the whole so
prosperous as the Victorians are, is it to be wondered at that with
them pleasure-seeking is an important business ? According to the
last published official figures, Victoria is richer in private wealth
than New South Wales by per head, and the United
Kingdom is no less than per head behind. If figures may
be allowed to prove anything, these quotations evidence the
immense superiority of Victoria in point of wealth over other
parts of the Empire ; and where wealth is abundant, means of
disposing of it to the best advantage should be liberally provided.
On looking at the map of railways accompanying this volume, it
will at once be seen that besides being the headquarters of a
multiplicity of country lines, the metropolis is the centre from
which radiates a perfect network of suburban lines, some following
the coastal curves while others run direct out towards the hills.
Thus the two principal kinds of health resorts —the seaside and
the hills—are rendered easy of access. Melbourne is a mar-
vellous city, and when it is considered that it has only just
attained its jubilee, its growth and development is phenomenal.
Batman and Fawkner, whose rival names are to be ever associated
with the founding of the city, had to take the position as they
found it and make the best of it. The result has been, that in the


short space of some half a century, a gigantic city has arisen on the
banks of the river, over the honour of discovering which so much
acrimony has been displayed by the rival partisans. Under these
circumstances it is well, then, that in the environs of this populous
city may be found spots where the pure breezes of the sea, or the no
less invigorating atmosphere of the hills, may be inhaled. At the
same time it is undeniable that the facilities for visiting these
places are not so extensively availed of as they should be. It is
the purpose of this publication to bring to the notice not only of
visitors to Melbourne, but also of the inhabitants of the city, the
advantages the railway system of Victoria affords for cheap and
pleasant excursions out of the busy, bustling city into quiet
country places or health-giving seaside resorts.
St. Kilda.
Whenever Melbourne began to take shape, her people began
to seek out beauty spots and health resorts all along the coast,
and on the near hills which rise immediately beyond the city,
as seen from the sea. The first to be developed was that long
skirt of beach which runs from Port Melbourne, almost
monopolised by the shipping, in an unbroken line to Picnic
Point, beyond Brighton. This is the proper suburban area,
and has been wonderfully developed. From a very early
stage there have been great bathing enclosures there, which are
constantly being enlarged. Captain Kenney, who is a pioneer
in enterprise of this sort, and Mr. Hegarty, still persevere in their
efforts to maintain bathing accommodation, luxurious and
complete in every detail, and adequate to the wants of such a
population as that of Melbourne. Hotelkeepers have also
done much to make this beach permanently accessible to
visitors who come down from the hot inlands, eager, chiefly, for a
whiff of sea air. Taking Port Melbourne as the starting point,
first along this coastal strip comes the Hotel Victoria, a really
magnificent structure, luxuriously furnished and maintained, in
every way, after the style of the first-class European and Conti-
nental hotels. Perfect bathing accommodation is provided on


the beach, immediately before the hotel; and the beauty of the
Esplanade is being forever increased by judicious cultivation and
planting of trees. The Beaconsfield comes next, another well-
built, well-furnished, and perfectly-kept hotel. And, fairly central
on the Esplanade, which is St. Kilda’s special pride, is the
Esplanade Hotel proper—the specially-chosen home or abiding-
place of the visitors who have come to us of late, and who'
desired sea air and seclusion, with the perfect attendance they are
familiar with in the great houses of Europe and America.
Madame Sarah Bernhardt chose the Esplanade Hotel as her
home during her stay here, and was followed very recently by
Mrs. Bernard-Beere. It may be added that many an Australian
man of means chooses this pleasant, roomy hotel and home in
preference to maintaining for himself a private establishment.
The George, perhaps, is the great caravanserai of St. Kilda. An
hotel of multitudinous rooms, immediately opposite the railway-
station, within twenty minutes of the Melbourne Post Office, and
five minutes from the beach. The Prince of Wales, the Royal,
and the Star and Garter, are also good hotels, comfortable and
homely, providing visitors for the hour, or the month, or the
year, with all the accommodation reasonable people require.
And beyond St. Kilda various enterprising people have also
provided good hotels, as at Brighton, and further on at Mordialloc,
and other watering-places of the coast, which do not properly
come within the suburban area. Nor do these hotelkeepers
complain of any lack of patronage, for Victoria is, and ever will
be, a wealthy colony.
Referring to the map included herewith for indications of
locality, the best known and most easily reached seaside suburb
of Melbourne is St. Kilda, situate three and half miles down the
eastern side of Port Phillip Bay. To and from this popular and
fashionable resort trains —over sixty on every week day—run
at frequent intervals from six a.m. until midnight. The run only
occupies thirteen minutes either way, and the first-class single fare
is a mere matter of qd., return 6d. The service is slightly altered on
Saturdays, and on Sundays thirty-nine trains travel each way.
Between Flinders Street station, the metropolitan terminus, and St.


Kilda, three stations intervene. Passing out of Flinders Street sta-
tion, the train crosses the river Yarra and bears away in a southerly
direction to South Melbourne. Approaching this stopping place,
after passing by several of the largest factories of Victoria
clustering together conveniently near to the wharfs on the river.
The train next pulls up at Albert Park, and this pleasaunce
for the rest of the journey forms the immediate view on
the left-hand side. Soon its lake, a favourite place of aquatic
pastime, comes into sight, and then is left behind; the train
speeds on and St. Kilda is reached. On leaving the St. Kilda
station, a turn to the right down a wide thoroughfare flanked with
pleasant residences, most of which are to be approached through
well-kept gardens, leads direct to the sea-beach. Here, on any
fine day, and particularly on any fine Sunday, may be witnessed
all those agreeable sights associated with a fashionable watering-
place, and whilst on shady balconies, individuals may be seen
reclining in all the lazy luxuriousness of dolce far niente , more
energetic individuals, mostly children, are moving about, busying
themselves in the pleasure pursuits proper to youth, and imparting
to the scene the charm of life and motion. If there is any one
sight more charming than another t o a visitor to the Australian
Colonies, it is the healthy vigour and robustness of the children,
betokening a vigorous origin and promising a vigorous continuance,
St. Kilda is well provided with hotels and boarding-houses,
suitable for the accommodation of the solitary bachelor as well as
the numerous family, and there are shops of all kinds for the
convenience of those who do not make their purchases in the
big city. Sea-bathing is naturally a chief attraction of this resort,
for the enjoyment of which abundant and cheap facilities for both
sexes are provided.
The cable tramway connects the railway station with the beach,
a distance of about half-a-mile intervening. On nearing the
spacious esplanade which runs along the sea front, the briny
odour of the sea salutes us. The esplanade is flanked on
the shore side by a line of fashionable residences, commanding
a fine view of the waters of the bay. To the right stretches
a wide sweep of sand, beyond which are visible the roofs and


chimneys of work-a-day Sandridge, and a cluster of ships’ masts
shows the position of the berthings at Port Melbourne. In
front stretches the wide expanse of sea water, across which can
be discerned —more or less distinctly according to the state of the
atmosphere—the opposite shore of the bay, the mountains on that
side dimly outlined against the horizon. The surface of the water
is dotted with craft of all sizes and descriptions. Here passes
outward or inward one of the stately vessels which carry Her
Majesty’s mails as well as Her Majesty’s subjects to and
from the other side of the world ; while smaller ships, moved
by steam or wind, to be counted by the dozen, are passing
up and down the sea highway, or standing off in the offing.
From under the highest point of the esplanade an L-shaped
pier runs out several hundred feet into the water, affording
shelter for a flotilla of small yachts and pleasure boats. Along
the shore several works of improvement are being carried
on with the object of removing all obstacles to the enjoyment of
a promenade by the seaside, and enhancing its delights, and seats
are placed along the sea wall overlooking the water, from which
all the charms of the scene can be calmly surveyed. Nets hung
upon the pier show that fishing is an occupation of business or
pleasure here. The pier and esplanade form a fashionable and
popular promenade in summer, particularly on Sunday afternoons,
when the whole scene is alive with happy folk, wearing pleasant
faces and gay attire.
There is a procession which follows the promenade in the
summer time which should not be missed. It is of the sunset.
Ridiculous as it may appear to people who have not taken the
trouble to see for themselves, there are few finer sunset pictures
in Australia, and not many in the world, than may be obtained
from any high ground in St. Kilda, or even the beach. The
approach of a brilliant sunset may easily be known —
“Far off his coining shone.”
A fair band of clear sky below, and sufficient cloud above to break
into flakes of fire, and higher aloft, perhaps, hang out a few
crimson banners. But it is not to the sky that one looks for


aught novel in sunset beauty. On a genial summer’s night at St.
Kilda the time comes when the You Yangs appear to lower their
ram-like point, when the skirt of plain becomes visible, and the
gaunt masses of the distant mountains, Macedon and Anakies, are
all aglow, though the intervening woodlands are dark almost to
blackness. The light dies up the masts of the ships then, and
trucks flash and darken one by one ; the flags come running down,
and the smoke from innumerable furnace-fires preparing for the
morrow float out black and repulsive. It is very weird and eerie
down on the long beach by the hissing sea then; but as nothing
to the end of the day to whose burying comes the thunderstorm.
Generally away from westward, over the conical hills, bellying out
as the light dies into a half coil of intense blackness ; a serrated
edge of grey above, a faintly luried glow beneath ; the strip of
beach running towards Sandridge strangely illuminated. It almost
shines between water and land, and the ships, though indistinctly
seen, are brought unnaturally near. Lights from all the houses
peer out through bodeful silence and gloom. Then comes the
first flash, zigzagging down the breast of the storm, and before the
thunder roars there is time to see every mast and spar of every
ship at either port; a sailing boat with canvas trembling, the
splash of the rising fish, the You Yangs close apparently as
Vesuvius to Pompeii, and half a dozen of church spires like
white fingers pointing upward.
Port Melbourne.
Hither come the ships bearing the multifarious manufactured
articles of the old world to be exchanged for the raw products
which form the staple commodities of Australian export, the
same ships carrying back the colonial produce to Europe. For
beauty of aspect Port Phillip cannot compare with Port Jackson,
neither has it so many natural advantages for shipping purposes
as are possessed by the world-renowned harbour of Sydney ;
but the energy and ingenuity of the Victorians has, to a large
extent, supplied artificially what was naturally wanting to make
safe berthing for ships in the Port of Melbourne, and vessels of


the largest size and deepest draught can be safely accommodated
along the piers at Port Melbourne (Sandridge) or Williamstown.
“Ichabod” may be said now to be written on the walls of the
latter place, at one time regarded as the centre of the future
city, much of its importance having departed with the removal of
the railway workshops from thence to Newport, some miles-
nearer the city, and with the change of berthing made by the
ocean steamer lines, whose trade now is principally with Port
Melbourne on the other side of the harbour. Williamstown,
however, possesses a fine graving dock, one of the largest in the
world, in fact, which has comfortably accommodated H.M.S,
“ Nelson,” the biggest man-of-war which has yet been seen in
Australasian waters. This port is otherwise amply provided
with shipping facilities. Vessels can be brought alongside any
of the four piers, and unloaded into or loaded direct from the
railway trucks ; and it is rarely indeed that some business of
this description is not proceeding here. During the seasons for
wool and wheat export Williamstown wakes up and becomes a
busy place, and the rows of sheds adjoining the railway line and
the landing stages are then filled to their utmost capacity with
bales of w’ool and bags of grain from the country districts,
awaiting their turn to be placed in the ship’s hold, while
vessels of large tonnage are being meanwhile loaded as rapidly
as the stevedores can get the work done. Passenger trains
run every few minutes between Williamstown and Spencer Street
terminus, a distance of not quite 10 miles, and there is also a
considerable goods traffic over the double lines of rails between
the port and the city. One of the piers of Williamstown forms
a breakwater, effectually protecting the shipping at the berthage
from damage when the waters of the open bay are boisterous.
A time-ball on a tower gives the meteorologically correct time
at mid-day to all within sight of it. There is a pilot’s office
also, where experienced guides are always in readiness to bring
a vessel safely into haven, and a beacon light, conspicuously
displayed, shows the way in at night. The Customs Department
has, of course, a depot at Williamstown, and the Defence
Department maintains a considerable establishment here for the


Torpedo Corps, whose business it would be to give “ pertickler
perdition ” to any vessel visiting Port Phillip with hostile intent,
which should have successfully run the gauntlet of the batteries
at the Heads. Should an invader pass this last line of defence,
all the mercantile shipping in port, and the city itself, would be
at his mercy. The chief rifle range of the colony is at
Williamstown, and the place can also boast of the possession
of a well laid out racecourse, where during the year many
important events are determined.
Every hour a steam-boat runs over from Williamstown to Port
Melbourne (its original name was Sandridge) and back, and any
visitor desiring a comprehensive view of the city from the sea,
and also a sight of the shipping in the port, could not attain his
end better than by making this trip across the water. Port
Melbourne has the advantage as a shipping place over Williams-
town of being much nearer to the city, the distance from Spencer
Street to Port Melbourne Pier station being only miles, as
against miles to Williamstown Pier; and now that by
dredging on a large scale it has been rendered safe for large
vessels to come alongside the landing stages, this berthage is
naturally preferred by the shipping companies. Port Melbourne
is essentially a place of business, and not in any sense a pleasure
resort. In the latter respect it has even less attractions than
its rival on the other side of the water. Nevertheless, to the
observant person it is not without interest in the signs here to be
read of the large and increasing shipping trade of Victoria. This
is the principal port of the colony, far surpassing all the others in
the volume of its transactions. Here is the trim clipper ship of
some great sailing line which, with favourable winds, can make
the run out in 70 days or so —a feat undreamt of within the
memory of old colonists. There are to be seen the shapely
lines of some ocean greyhound, which can run half round
the world in a month—a still less imagined performance with
those who came out to Australia in the earlier days, when
three times that period was considered average time for a
voyage between Terra Australis and Great Britain. To anyone
who appreciates the noble motto- —“ Homo sum , nil humam ame


alienum puto ,” the scene on the arrival or departure of one of the
great ocean steamers, with its freight of living souls, is one of deep
interest. The sadness of parting, the joy of re-union, the hope
that fills the breast of the sanguine seeker after “fresh woods
and pastures new,” the stern and self-repressed joy of the man of
mature years, successful in having reached the goal of a colonist’s
ambition, and now entrusted with some high mission of State, the
parent’s last loving interview with a child going forth into the wide,
wide world, with all its lurking perils, the meeting again of loved
relatives and friends after long years of separation—all these and
numerous other phases of our many-hued, many-sided human life,
with its tears and its laughter, its griefs and it joys, its dangers
and its delights, are presented in one vivid living picture at the
side and on the deck of a big ship about to begin, or having
just completed, an ocean passage. The station for Port
Melbourne in the city is Flinders Street terminus, and trains
run between the two points every 15 minutes from 6 a.m.
until 9 p.m., and every half hour from 9 p.m. until close
upon midnight.
Caulfield and Oakleigh.
Oakleigh is a pleasant township, miles from Melbourne,
and between this place and Princes Bridge Station trains run at
short intervals from early morn until close upon midnight, while
to and from Caulfield, miles from the metropolitan terminus,
there is a yet more frequent service of the trains. The line to
Caulfield passes through the fashionable suburbs of Hawksburn,
Toorak, Armadale, and Malvern, and along this route can be
seen some of the finest residences about Melbourne, the
dwellings of the moneyed magnates and the social elite of
Victoria. After leaving South Yarra Station the train runs uphill
for three miles, Caulfield, the summit of the incline, being
169 feet above sea-level. On the way from Hawksburn the spire
of the old-fashioned Anglican Church of St. John’s, Toorak, one
of the landmarks on this side of Melbourne, is sighted, crowning
the hill which forms the centre of this most fashionable


neighbourhood. Along this route are no signs of poverty. The
larger dwellings stand each in its own grounds, while nearly
every residence, large and lesser, is surrounded by a well-kept
garden. Conspicuous objects in the moving panorama to be
seen from the windows of the train are the trim State School
buildings and the clock towers of the Shire Halls of Armadale
and Malvern.
The principal attraction at Caulfield is its racecourse, which is-
second only to that at Flemington ; and the race for the Caulfield
Cup, which takes place here in October, ranks in importance
second only to the great annual struggle on the premier
ground for the Melbourne Cup. The course at Caulfield, which
is situated on a wide expanse of flat, heather-covered country,,
known as “The Heath,” and amidst charming rural surroundings,
is in convenient proximity to the railway station, the gates
opening direct from the platform. It may be mentioned that a.
Golf Club has been established by some prominent Melbourne
citizens for indulging in this good old Scotch game, and Caulfield
Heath has been chosen as the playing ground. Oakleigh, three-
miles beyond Caulfield, forms the limit of this suburban section,,
the intervening stations being Rosstown and Murrumbeena, each
the centre of a pretty rural district, upon which the ever-expanding
boundaries of Greater Melbourne have not yet seriously
encroached.
Glen Iris Line.
A pleasant alternative route to Oakleigh is afforded by the line-
which branches off from the Camberwell section at Burnley, and,,
after crossing the Yarra, runs along the Kooyong valley past Glen
Iris, and, leaving on the right the line of hill on which Toorak
stands, takes a parallel course to the route via Caulfield to-
Oakleigh, converging into the same station at the latter place.
After crossing the Yarra, the passenger from town by this route
finds himself amid country scenery for the rest of the short
journey, and the Dandenong range in the distance forms a
background to a pleasing picture of settled and cultivated country.


Tickets from Melbourne to Oakleigh and vice versa are available
by way of Caulfield or Glen Iris, the distance by the latter route
.being only half a mile longer than by the former.
The Outer Circle.
This is the name given to a line which makes a wide circuit
-of the eastern environs of Melbourne, from Oakleigh to Fairfield
Park. The routes from Melbourne to the former place have been
already described; the latter is a station on the Heidelberg line.
The Outer Circle line intersects the line to Healesville just
beyond Camberwell; and between the last named place and
Waverley Road, the station next to Oakleigh, trains run at
intervals of one and two hours. Between Waverley Road and
Oakleigh, passengers are conveyed by the Glen Iris trains. A
trip on the Outer Circle line is not to be made without changing
trains twice or thrice; but there is some pretty scenery of the
peaceful kind along this line which is worth taking a little trouble
to see. The best way to travel over this route is to take a train
from Princes Bridge terminus to Waverley Road Station on the
•Glen Iris line, and there change for Riversdale. A short run of
four miles through open countiy brings the passenger to Rivers-
dale. Thence he can, if he choose, return direct via Camberwell
to his starting point. But should he take that course he will
have completed only half the circuit, and will miss the best view
to be obtained on the Outer Circle line. As the train from
Riversdale to Fairfield Park emerges from a deep cutting just
before reaching Deepdene, to the right opens on the sight a wide
expanse of undulating grass country, relieved here and there with
woodland, and backed in the dim distance with the chain of
hills which form an outmost rampart round Melbourne, north,
east, and west. On the left lies the city, but hidden from view
by an intervening rise which slopes down to the railway line. As
the train runs on, the landscape on the right hand becomes quite
English in aspect, with broad sweeps of park-like country;
trees distributed in groups or standing singly among sloping
stretches of green sward. A conspicuous object in the distance


is Doncaster Tower, an erection from which extensive views of
the surrounding country may be enjoyed. The railway, however,
does not, as yet, touch Doncaster. Before reaching Fairfield Park
the winding Yarra river—a veritable Meander, taking all kinds
of unexpected turns in its course about and through Melbourne —
is once more crossed. At Fairfield Park the Outer Circle ends,
and the traveller is carried thence to Spencer Street, via Colling-
wood, by a Heidelberg train. When he reaches the main terminus,
he will have made very nearly a complete circuit of Melbourne.
Brighton and Sandringham.
To English tourists the conjunction of these two names wilb
perhaps, appear peculiar, there being no apparent connection,
between the Prince of Wales’ country home in Norfolk, and the
famous watering-place on the southern coast of Albion, which has
been aptly nicknamed “ London-on-Sea.” But although the fitness
of naming a sea-side resort after a royal residence may not be par-
ticularly apparent, there is no question that a large and fashionable
southern suburb of Melbourne, which borders upon the shore of
Port Phillip Bay, has been appropriately christened after the
celebrated watering place on the coast of Sussex. The Brighton
of Victoria disputes with St. Kilda the distinction of being the
most popular of the sea-side resorts within easy reach of Mel-
bourne, and the advantage the latter possesses in being nearer
town, is counterbalanced by the more varied attractions for
ramblers which the former offers. Brighton Beach is reached in a
run of 9 miles from Flinders Street Station, occupying half-an-
hour ; and from the beach station a branch train runs on to
Sandringham, also on the marge of the sea, and 2 miles
further on. The train service to these places is very convenient,
passengers being conveyed at intervals of about a quarter of
an hour during the greater part of the day to and from
Flinders Street and Brighton Beach, and about every hour, or
less, between the latter place and Sandringham. On the
way from the Melbourne terminus the trains pass through the
populous suburbs of Richmond, South Yarra, Prahran, Windsor

Balaclava, Elsternwick, North Brighton and Middle Brighton
before reaching the beach. The run from Flinders Street,
as far as Elsternwick, is through town surroundings, and
it is not until Brighton is approached that the streets are left
behind, the houses become fewer, paddocks are to be seen by
the sides of the line, and glimpses are to be had of the distant
hills to the left, or of the sea to the right.
On account of its salubrity, and the other advantages derived
from proximity to the sea, Brighton is a popular residential locality.
But to be seen in its full glory, a visit should be paid to the
beach here on a public holiday. On such an occasion, each
train arriving from town discharges an enormous living load,
which pours out of the station on to the sands, and soon the
whole stretch of yellow sea-fringe is alive with merry-making
humanity. Every one is on pastime bent. Paterfamilias, with
his jovial face beaming with pleasure, and generally carrying a
younger member of the family —perhaps two —heads a procession
to some particular spot which has, after much deliberation, been
selected beforehand as the place for the feast that is a principal
feature of the joyful gala day. The materials for the al fresco
banquet are brought along in hamper, basket, and bag—burdens
unheeded in the anticipation of the delights they are presently to
afford. The smaller children soon have their shoes and stockings
off, and are paddling bare-legged among the wavelets that gently
ripple on the beach, or set themselves to erecting castles of sand,
edifices which are soon washed away by the incoming waves,
just as the works in which men are wont to take pride, are so
often swept utterly away by the irresistible tide of events. But
the children are happily free from all experiences that provide
food for moralising. Their laughter fills the air, and is not to be
quenched or even lessened by such an easily remediable disaster
as the washing away of a sand castle. Their seniors, by a few
years, obeying an all-prevailing law of Mother Nature, separate
into couples of one of each sex, and stroll off to exchange in some
secluded nook those sweet confidences which belong to Love’s
Young Dream. The elders, the while, enjoy that quiet happiness
which comes from the contemplation of young folk at play. With


the heat of the bright sun tempered by a breeze from the sea —a
whisper of wind just enough to slightly stir the surface of
the water causing it to break into ever changing lines of white
foam, and to gurgle and ripple pleasingly around the small boats
scattered about on its bosom —this is a scene worth travelling far
to behold. There is a small pier at Brighton Beach, an enclosed
sea-bath, and the customary sea-side hotel accommodation.
Brighton Beach is also a favourite Sunday resort, especially in
the summer time, vying in that respect with St. Kilda.
A pleasant stroll southwards along the beach for about a mile
will bring the visitor to “ Picnic Point,” a small headland jutting
out seaward, whence can be obtained a comprehensive view of
the Bay. Beyond this small promontory is Sandringham, a
favourite spot with picnickers, the belt of ti-tree along the cliff
which here overlooks the sea, affording a shade and shelter not to
be found on the open beach higher up. From and to Sandring-
ham trams run in connection with the railway service at Chelten-
ham, a station miles from Melbourne on the Mordialloc
line; and circular tickets are issued for the round trip from
Princes Bridge Station back to Flinders Street Station at the
cheap rate of 2s. each, first-class. In fine weather this trip is a
very pleasant one, and much patronised, affording, as it does, the
pleasures of both a run to the sea-side and a ride in the country.
The railway station at Sandringham is also close to the sea-beach.
Heidelberg.
For an outlay of less than a shilling and a half a passenger can
run out to Heidelberg and back by rail from the main metro-
politan station ; and this is a trip which every visitor to Melbourne
should take, Heidelberg being one of the pleasantest of the
environs of the capital. The run from Spencer Street Station
occupies from fifty minutes to an hour, the train making a circuit
skirting the northern suburbs of North Melbourne, Flemington,
Royal Park, Carlton, Fitzroy, Clifton Hill and Collingwood,
affording a good view of the whole of that part of Melbourne.
From Collingwood the line strikes out north-east for a straight run


of six miles to Heidelberg. As there is a considerable direct traffic
between Heidelberg and Collingwood, the train service is much
more frequent to and from the latter station than from the main
terminus; but the journey round from Spencer Street is essential
for the passenger who desires to obtain the most complete views
of Victoria’s capital and a correct impression of its extent and
surroundings. Leaving Spencer Street the train pursues a north-
westerly course until reaching Flemington Bridge, a station in the
vicinity of the world-renowned chief racecourse of Victoria.
Thence, in a northerly direction, the passenger is conveyed past
the Royal Park, the largest piece of recreation ground belonging
to the capital, covering several hundreds of acres, and catches a
passing glimpse of strange animals browsing in the enclosures of
the Zoological Gardens. If bent on a visit to the fine collection
of mammalia and birds exhibited by the Acclimatisation Society,
he should alight at Royal Park Station. During the rest of the
short journey round the circuit to Collingwood, the dome of the
Exhibition Building is in sight on the right hand side, standing
out conspicuously above all the buildings of the city. Starting
from Collingwood on the outward run the city is left behind, and
the aspect of the view from the carriage windows becomes more
countrified. On the right hand side the large pile of buildings
forming the Yarra Bend Asylum for the insane will not escape the
observant eye ; but no other striking object of interest will arrest
the sight during the ride of nineteen minutes from Collingwood
to Heidelberg. At present the latter is the terminus of this
branch, but it is proposed to carry the line some miles further
in the same direction to give access to an immediate environ of
the capital which is in every way eminently suitable for settle-
ment. Dairying and fruit-growing form the principal industrial
occupations of the settlers round about Heidelberg, but that
place itself is best known as a residential resort. It is, for an
Australian settlement, quite an ancient place, some of the residents
having lived in the same spot for forty years past. With its quiet,
settled aspect, Heidelberg has quite the appearance of a typical
English settlement; and the tourist from the Mother Country
may almost fancy himself back among the familiar scenes of his


native land as he looks down upon this village nestling in a
hollow surrounded on three sides by gentle wooded heights.
The roofs of comfortable and substantially built residences peep
out from among groves of trees, an old-fashioned inn opens
hospitable doors to the traveller, and here is the oldest church
in the colony outside Melbourne. The country round about
has considerable scenic attractions of the quiet, cultivated type,
consequently Heidelberg is a favourite rendezvous with sketching
clubs, and artists of renown have perpetuated the varied beauties
of the surrounding landscapes. The principal building here is
the Austin Hospital for Incurables; and a pleasanter scene to
gladden the eyes of those upon whom the hand of affliction lies
heavily could hardly be found -than that which presents itself to
the beholder looking down into the valley from the grounds
of the hospital.


METROPOLITAN ATTRACTIONS.
IfN speaking of what the railways have done and do, it is neces-
fji- sary to name a few of the great institutions of Melbourne,
fj | and indeed, it may be proper, without trespassing on the
province of the official guide book, to speak briefly, at least of
those which afford special attractions to visitors. Of the
public parks and resorts, the best and most beautiful, perhaps, is
that which lies on the banks of the Yarra, and includes Studley
Park, the old survey paddock, and the Kew and Yarra Bend
Lunatic Asylums. A great area of the park-like country,
which once occupied the site of the Melbourne of to-day, is
here preserved in its native condition. The old red-gums, the
wattles on the river banks, the short, pleasant turf under
foot, and the river—as yet but very slightly polluted here—
meandering along on its marvellously circuitous route to
the sea. The chief pride of the city, however, is in the
Botanical Gardens and Domain. These are well-known, and lie
so immediately accessible to the gate or the centre of the city, as
to require no special description. The Royal Park, with the
model farm and the Zoological Gardens, is somewhat further


removed, and it is most easily reached by the railway which runs
out in that direction to Brunswick and Coburg.
Then there are the cricket grounds or football fields, which are
dotted here and there through city and suburbs, each a pleasant
eye of light, and most valuable lung to the ever-thickening
community.
Albert Park, alongside the railway which runs out to St. Kilda,
is also a great pleasure resort of multitudes from the city and
suburbs, and, indeed, it may be said that no citizen of Melbourne
is without an accessible playground or recreation spot for himself
and family. Nor will the visitor, even from the most highly-
developed cities of the old world, find any lack in our metropolis
of those pleasures which the higher civilisation supplys and
demands.
Of theatres we have at least enough, and one or two amongst
them, equal in all points (size excepted) to the best houses of
London or Paris. Then our Cycloramas, in substantial brick
buildings, most happily placed, seem destined to become per-
manences, and to be constantly supplied with pictures of the great
events of history, which the new school of cycloramic artists so
happily depict.
Public buildings of all sorts the visitor will easily find for
himself. Indeed, it may be said that this railway business is
almost ended when it sets him down so fairly and conveniently in
the centre of the city. Yet there are one or two great institutions
so perfectly served, and, indeed, it may be said, almost established
by railway enterprise, that they merit a little special description.
Foremost amongst these are our racecourses. Railway managers
have long seen their opportunities of obtaining revenues from the
great racecourses of the world. The five great companies of
Paris add two thousand sovereigns annually to the stake of the
“ Grand Prix and though our managers have not gone quite so
far as that, they have advisedly bestowed special attention on the
opportunities afforded by our great Melbourne racing clubs.
Without the railway accommodation, even in very early days
afforded, it may very safely be said that the Melbourne Cup


would not have been what it is to-day. And as the visitor may
ask, “What is it, really and truly?” We will give a description
of it as written for the Melbourne Argus of xBBB :
“The day had arrived once more, ushered in, as has frequently
happened, by a sultry day and a rainy eve, and heralded by the
many voices which proclaim its various aspects to the world—
sermons on the sin and calculations on the chances of the day,
denunciations and congratulations everywhere mingling, and folks
crowding in fast from all parts of our Austral world. ... It
was, indeed, a very great crowd, and very well dressed and very
well behaved, and, generally speaking, in appearance very
prosperous. The results of the abundant prosperity we have
enjoyed of late were seen in new drags, broughams, barouches,
and all manner of stylish equipages in the inner enclosure ; and in
stiff silks, lustrous satins, and massive jewellery without. And yet
elements of pathos were not lacking. Many and many a farmer
had plucked up the courage of despair to come down and see
‘ the Cup.’ ‘ What’s the odds ? The crops are withering; there
will be no harvest.’ No harvest over many and many a league of
our fair colony. No harvest this year unless —and it is a far-off
chance —the late rains suffice to fill the shrivelling ears. And
look at our old friends from the northern rivers and the back
blocks. How merry, how glad, how hopeful were they of a fair
future at this time last year! How heartily, when, in the
September of last spring, we rode over leagues of clover and
plains abloom, did they pledge to the merry meeting on Cup Day.
More prayers than pledges with them this year. Red sand in
place of gold and silver and purple meadows, and the hope of any
change for the better now almost dead. Still they must come
down for the Cup, bearing their burdens bravely as old warriors
their scars or fresh wounds. There is a somewhat wistful look in
the old man’s eye, perhaps, as he glances along the beautiful
stretch of lawn, and thinks of the desolation he turned his back on
a week ago, and marvels if yesterday’s spurtle of rain has done him
any good.
“ The beautiful lawn. The sweet stocks are all abloom in the


flower-beds about the fountain. Weeks ago about all the borders
“ ‘ The winking mary-buds began
To ope their golden eyes.’
And now they are looking out boldly to the velvet turf and the
oaks and pines, washed, and freshened and sweetened by Monday’s
rain. The lawn was a carpet well fitted for the court which should
assemble on it. How marvellously had the plumage of the
promenaders on the lawn changed since last year. The poppy
field of parasols had quiet died down, and the tulip beds of
gorgeous hues given place to tints of earliest spring time ; to such
delicate pinks and blues as we know in some of our fragile fair
Australian flowers ; to narcissus and pale hyacinth tones ; and the
soft rich colours that perfect
“ ‘ The grace of standing corn.’
The change is acceptable, the effect delightful. A superior wisdom
has verily ordained the toilets of this year. The leader of the
fashions must have studied deeply in the art of beauty. ‘ The
colours of beautiful bodies,’ says a master in that art, ‘ must not
be dusky and muddy, but clean and fair.’ Taking the phrase in
a literal sense, one would say that our Australian nature conforms
very exactly to it. So far as'may be judged, the ‘beautiful
bodies ’on the lawn are clean and fair. Further, and this must
be taken to apply to the raiment rather than to the ‘ beautiful
bodies.’ ‘ Those which seem most appropriate are the milder of
every sort, light green, soft blues, weak whites, pink reds, and
violets.’ All these soft gradations of colour appear in the lawn
costumes of the Cup Day, with here and there a flash of crimson
or a rich glow of purple lightening or deepening a generally
beautiful effect.
“ Cross the course and enter the crowd on the flat, and how com-
plete, how startling is the contrast! There is no poverty there, no
hungry or wolfish looks at the near, but unattainable, splendours.
The people on the flat are just as well content with themselves as
the people on the lawn, and are bent much more eagerly on their
own amusement. The sweep promoters work desperately for their
percentages. The brazen-throated bookmakers bellow the odds.
The gamesters and showmen of all sorts shout and chaff and joke


and gibe, and merrily goes the game. Watching that game care-
fully one may see the beginning of many things. Those tawdrily
bedizened fellows, blatant and noisy, but keen and watchful, laying
the odds in shillings to-day, may get to the Hill next year, and with
a little luck and a good deal of judgment graduate to the inner
circle of the paddock before many more Cups are run. And the
shrewd youth from the warehouse, who has calculated the chances
and studied all the tips, and put on his one pound carefully, may
be promenading the lawn ten years hence, his carriage waiting in
the inner paddock. The man who has studied the Cup crowds of
ten years must have noted many marvellous transformations. How
desperately they work, some of the neophytes of the professional
gambling school, and what dreams lie ahead of them ! Imagine the
visions of the monkey and the goose men ! Do they not more than
rival Almaschar’s ? And what about the fate of the monkey and
the goose ? Does the one go to the organ-grinder and the other
to the Christmas pot ? Is it possible that any member of the
inner ring has anywhere a pdt monkey or a stuffed goose (not sage
and onion stuffed) to which favour is shown or honour paid as the
founder of the family fortune ?
“ The stands and the face of the Hill are very well seen from the
fountain or the extreme corner of the birdcage, but best of all,
perhaps, from the outermost edge of the crowd on the flat. And
they present a wonderful spectacle, a continuous slope of heads
from the terrace on the lawn to the sky line on the Hill. Level
as the ‘batter’ of a railway cutting, and so close, it would seem to be
impossible to drive a stake between them. Everybody knows the
sort of people who are to be found on the Grand-stand. All the
fairly well-to-do folks about town; all the society ladies, with a
mild penchant for gambling ; all the more ardent courtiers of vice-
royalty, and the multitude who have determined to see the Cup,
and have sat down with earnest intent, and will not budge till the
numbers have gone up and the trophy is presented.
“The voice of the Hill, however, is the loudest and the merriest
of the day. From noon till eve the clatter of business, the roar of
sport, and the music of genuine fun and frolic goes on there.
The Hill is the place of cake and wine, of ham sandwiches and


bottled beer, of apples, oranges, and lemonade, of family parties
on the grass, beneath the trees. Bang, bang, go the drums;
twang, twang, go the harps; fiddle-fa go the fiddles by dozens all
about the Flat. And ‘ Hi, hi, hi ! ’ cry the showmen, ‘ come up
here, and see the learned professor swallow the swords, the marks-
man of the Alps blow the apple from the boy’s head, the great
marine monster, the two-headed calf, and the performing pig.
Come and shy at old Aunt Sally, and play doodleum-buck, and
ring the bull, and shoot the rocking jackass.’ There are no Cup
dresses, and no fashionable promenade on the Hill; but instead
thereof lolling and strolling and eating and drinking, and just a
little too much of a crush perhaps after the starting bell has rung.
For, despite all the improvements, the Hill is not yet large enough.
The human bees swarm over on the other side, whence no sight
of the race can be obtained, and there is not much fun in hearing
other people shout the name of the winner.
“ There goes the bell. It was the bell for the Cup that rang the
people into their places, with light in their eyes, flushes on their
cheeks, and more palpitation of the heart probably than all the
doctors of Australia have ever discovered with their apparatus.
“ The horses have all paraded and gone to the post. There is
not much fractiousness amongst them, nor a long delay before
they are brought into line. It is so still on stand and lawn while
the starter performs his quiet but peremptory marshalling that the
roar of the train on the Wiiliamstown line seems to give the signal,
for simultaneous with its approach the flag flashes, and tongues
are loosed again. The general face of the crowd is towards the
turn, into which the fast but not terrible swing is made five
seconds from the start. The colours flash against a dark back-
ground, for the crowd is close packed and deep this year around
a fourth of the course. The flat shouts encouragement, the lawn
murmers, the Hill buzzes various names. A tight hand is seen on
one favourite’s head, another tries to carry his yellow and black
diamonds away from them all, a third is seen lying low to the
ground, and flattering his backers with his easy stride. Not much
of a tail till the hill is mounted and pace put on along the back.
Then one or two of the lightweights forge ahead, and the cripples


who should never have been started drop hopelessly in the rear.
Then the hopeful and well-instructed riders of the big horses begin
to look for position, and then the general face of the crowd is
seen, veering with the flying cloud. Then, also, many trembling
hands can be seen trying in vain to steady race-glasses on their
dimmed eyes. And more than one dashes the thing down with a
curse. He cannot hold it. Another thrusts it into his wife’s or
daughter’s hands, with a ‘ Tell me, tell me.’ But long before the
focus can be adjusted, the leaders are round the turn, and the
dull, rapid, incessant thud of hoofs is answered by the increasing
thunder from flat, stand and Hill. It is like the roar of a mael-
strom gathering to engulf some doomed ship that drives headlong
towards the vortex. And simply a roar, a tumultuous outcry, not
jubilant or triumphant, or passionate, a hundred thousand human
throats roaring something, they know not what. For though the
horses are between the two walls, no man as yet knows what to
cry. Louder and louder the din, nearer and nearer the post, then
a last keen cut and dig, and whip is dropped and spurs thrust
forward, and the great struggle is over. The roar of the voices died
down as a great wave that has gathered itself and smote the clift’s
face, and rolls back again to the deeps. And then another babel
arose, a sound of laughing of winners, a little squealing amongst
it, as some femine groups were assured ‘that it really was No. 8
on the board,’ and that their party had won. Cheer after cheer
as the jockey came down and the owner greeted his horse; and
yet a louder cheer, perhaps, as the presentation is made, and the
last act of the cup is consummated.
“ And it may be said that never did so vast a crowd of people
come together and disperse with less commotion or damage. The
tale of accidents is short indeed, And what are we to think of all
the fears and warnings of pickpockets and thieves abroad ? Truly
it seems that the rascals are few in number or happily lacking in
courage or skill. There were people who had been preached
into the belief that their sovereigns would never be safe unless
clutched in their tight fist, and who dreaded to get ten yards from
the crowd’s edge lest some gang of desperate ruffians should be
at them. What is it ? Does the strong tide of our Australian


respectability, prosperity, and consequent hate of rascality, which
is felt in every great gathering, swamp all intent of outrage ? If
so, it speaks of a good average amongst us, of a generally manly
tone, which, whether displayed at a picnic or a race meeting,
is a good cause for national pride, and should become a good
foundation of national character.”
Such was it in that year, and steadily, or rather with marvellous
enterprise, have all its advantages and splendours and glories been
increased. The next year saw the stake increased to
and at it stands still, supplemented by all the contingent
advantages of a great sweepstakes race. And what the railway
does there, may be seen and understood by any man who, on a
Cup Day, chooses to linger on the crest of the Hill, and, after the
last race is run, watch the departure of the people.
Caulfield, Melbourne’s other racecourse, was in the early days
something like Newmarket has been to England. Always a better
racing-track than Flemington, always a favourite resort of trainers,
a springy, heath-covered soil, lying well open to the sea breezes,
free from all the pestilential odours of the city or the multifarious
stinks, which abattoirs and boiling-down establishments and bone-
mills float across Flemington with every southerly breeze. In its
undrained and unimproved condition, however, Caulfield was
often inaccessible. The water lay in the hollows, and the springy,
fine-weather tracks became spongy and sodden through seasons of
rain. The Heath was supposed to be vested in the local Council,
but the local Council had very little to do with it, and, indeed, it
was a nuisance and an eyesore rather than a beauty spot and
healthful recreation ground, until the V.A.T.C. took it in hand.
Mr. Bond, the first secretary of the V.A.T.C., laboured in-
cessantly to draw money both from his patrons and the public,
and spent it in such a manner as to continually improve the
course, beautify all its surroundings, and provide those con-
veniences and luxurious accommodations which people, who pay
half a guinea for a day’s racing in Victoria, require. It is not
probable, however, that Mr. Bond would have had much success
on this course but for the ready aid lent him by the railway.
Railway enterprise has had just as much to do with the success of


Caulfield as of Flemington. Progress began from the time the
train arrived abreast of the gates of the course ; but seeing the
advantages and profits to be derived from the racecourse traffic,
the railway authorities very quickly resolved to run an off-line
right around the course fence, where trains might be shunted as
fast as they arrived, and held in readiness to take many thousands
of people home again with all expedition and the least possible
inconvenience. Under Mr. Bond, the course was brought to a
high degree of excellence, and when, a couple of years ago, that
good gentleman resigned, having fulfilled a long term of service,
it was feared that this great institution might suffer a relapse.
The secretaryship devolving, however, upon Mr. Harrie Smith, it
was speedily made manifest that successful racing, and the pro-
vision of accommodation for the public, would go on as of old,
and, indeed, with renewed vigour. New buildings have con-
stantly been added to the pavilions and stands, and every visitor
to the course, from His Excellency the Governor, to the stable
boys in the Bird-cage, has now accommodation of a better class
than would be found in any racecourse outside this colony. The
Caulfield Cup will never, perhaps, be comparable with the elder
institution of Flemington, but it is, and will continue to be, a sight
which every resident of the colony must know, and no visitor
should miss. Set in the very heart of spring, when all the
trees and flowers on the beautiful road, right out from Melbourne
and on the heath round about the course, are in fullest bloom, it
is a holiday which can be enjoyed as well by those who seek a
simple outing, as those who desire the fiercer zest of the closely-
contested race. Full 30,000 people have passed through the gates
of Caulfield on a Cup Day; and a goodly number have also
witnessed the Steeplechase, which, it is very possible, may some
day take precedence even of Flemington. With Caulfield and
Flemington, and the railway appointments connected with them,
we must in this book dismiss this subject of racing, although it
may be noted that at Mentone and Mordialloc and Williamstown
and Moonee Valley, there are also racecourses very perfectly kept,
very well appointed, and depending almost absolutely on the
services rendered by the railways for their profitable existence.


THE NEARER TOURIST LINES.
The Bay Lines.
this head we propose to describe the lines which
» lead out to Healesville and Whittlesea, and those which,
jCj \ skirting the bay, give communication with the whole of
the coast-line, Queenscliff on the one side, and Sorrento
on the other, and with their various branches striking
out to localities of exceptional advantage and beauty. First in im-
portance, perhaps, are the coast lines, and of these, that line which
runs along the eastern shore of the bay, should first be considered.
The first point outside the suburban area proper, struck by this
line, is Mordialloc, a pleasant watering-place, 14 miles from the
city. At Mordialloc is an abundant beach of bright clean sand,
shaded by ti-tree, with occasional oak and honeysuckle, and scope
for tens of thousands of people to make holiday and enjoy them-
selves, free of all restraint; the sun shining on land and sea, and
the fresh breezes full charged with health and invigoration, and the
smoke and turmoil of the city, as it seems, separated from them
by a gulf of blue water, clear atmosphere, and wild, fresh, healthy
bushland.
Beyond Mordialloc, Frankston is the first town of any
importance, for Carrum is but a roadside railway station, with here
and there a villa of some wealthy and enterprising citizen, set
pleasantly enough, among the ti-tree by the sea. From Frankston
to Mornington the beauties of nature increase constantly. They
require a perfect day to disclose themselves aright, and the perfect
day should be set midmost in a perfect season, and there should
be accompaniment of good company and conveyance. Every-
thing growing and thriving, and well and frequently washed with


rain, bush trees full of foliage, and garden trees of fruit, grass
starred thick with flowers, all the beasts of the bush fat and lusty,
and even the old man of the sea, whose garments eddy into countless
nooks and crannies here, putting in new lights and lustres, and such
colours as may be familiar enough to those who know, but are un-
suspected of those who have not lived, about Port Phillip Bay.
There is a beach strip just beyond the Frankston pier, where
stillness and sunshine bring out these colours of the sea’s robes
in marvellous fashion. It is a long beach which slopes outward
in the very gentlest fashion, a place where span-long fairies might
paddle, and the tiniest of human folks splash about in acres of
water on a hard, bright floor without risk or danger. They would
spoil the colour, though, if they broke too freely the even surface,
through which, and in which, shine all the reflections from the
sky, and the colours of the various strata which have been washed
down and levelled out for the ocean floor. Tints rich enough are
seen on the ever-wasting cliffs, all possible variations of reds and
browns, with glistening seams of white, and a general sole or
visible foundation of very dark-coloured rocks. But on the sea
floor they are in some mysterious manner glorified ; there is no
more comparison between the colours shown in the cliff wall and in
those beneath the water, than between those of the phosphorescent
jellyfish sparkling in the blue, and dying a shapeless mass on the
hot deck. There are streaks and bars of pink and palest grey, of
violet, and sapphire, and emerald on this long low beach. I
looked at it with an artist, who named a dozen more, and then got
out his colours and regarded them with utter contempt, and
thought he might reproduce something like it if he sat and looked
every day for a month. I think any artist would be well repaid
who did so sit and labour and learn, and ultimately achieve a
measure of success.
Perhaps the daintiest bit of scenery all around the bay is that
which lies between Frankston and Arthur’s Seat. From Fankston
on to Mornington, quite away and apart from the railway, though
fairly well served thereby, runs a three-chain road, parallel with
the general direction of the coast, and seaward from this road, as
from the railway further on, are some perfectly lovely bits of


country. It is what we generally call in Australia open forest
land, good grass land, that is just sufficiently shaded by the
various members of eucalyptus tribe, with occasional beauty of
cherry tree and oak, and the olive-silvery honeysuckles all along
the coast. A good many of our most prominent and wealthy
citizens established homes here many years ago. Here still
resides Dr. Madden through all the summer months, here Mr.
Sumner built a magnificent residence, frequently, in the old days,
occupied by the Governor. Here are long avenues of pines,
fringed with flowers on either edge, leading up to magnificent
homes, surrounded by glorious gardens, prolific orchards, and
beautiful park lands occupied by some of the best known citizens
—Messrs. Andrew Rowan, Frank Stephen, Norman Wilson,
Sydney Smith, James Grice, and Gillett (amongst others); and
then w r e come to Mornington.
It is possible that Mornington might better be classed as a
pleasure than a health resort, though it may reasonably enough
be said that both go together. The good people of the shire have
provided handsomely for the pleasure-making of the multitude.
A long beach strip adjoins the park proper, fronting which are
the two principal hotels and several boarding-houses. The hotels
are large and handsome buildings—Kirkpatrick’s, with handsome
bay windows looking through the ti-tree veil to the blue, and a
broad balcony above, commanding all the breadth of the bay and
the long stretch of coast line ; The Royal, one of the many ven-
tures of the Port Phillip Steamship Company, now the property of
the Hon. Robt. Byrne. Both are as well situated as seaside visitor
could desire, within a stone’s throw of a bright little bay, and a
quarter of a mile of the crystal baths; sea breeze and green grass
and abundant shade at the doors of both.
At Mornington the railway for the present halts, and it is yet
an undecided question whether it will go on from Mornington to
Sorrento, or from Stony Point to Flinders, on the head of
Western Port. There is a beautiful country between Mornington
and Dromana. Mount Martha, but a half-hour’s drive from the
terminus, being indeed a model watering-place, the property
of a syndicate who propose to conserve all the natural beauty of


the locality, and by planning and planting judiciously and con-
stantly, to make an estate which will ultimately excel anything to
be found even on the shores of the Riviera, or those scarcely less
fair of England’s Devon,
Mount Martha is always a conspicuous landmark to the in-
coming traveller • next to Arthur’s Seat, indeed, it is the highest
headland of the harbour coast. Pleasant country, lightly timbered,
well grassed, with abundance of wild flowers and creepers in all
the gullies, springs of fresh water, and scarcely opened-up quarries
of granite, whence material could be obtained to build anything
from a cottage to a castle. A genius hitherto unknown in the
development of Victorian watering-places has been exercised in
the development of this Mount Martha country. A block of
many hundreds of acres, with a magnificent stretch of white sea
beach, naturally fenced against the intrusion of sharks by a semi-
circular sand bar, which forms a beautiful natural sea-bathing and
water play-place for women and children. The chief thing we
notice here is the persistent effort to preserve and develop the
natural beauty of the place. Plantations of pines and deciduous
trees are set upon every prominent spur and hill crest. The
natural beauty of native valleys is carefully preserved, and seeds
of English buttercup and daisy, and primrose, and bluebell, fox-
glove, and harebell have been scattered about freely, so that it is
hoped and expected, in time to come, when people are wearied of
their sea-play, they may gather English posies here in native
woods, and enjoy all that variety of entertainment which makes a
pleasant holiday. Mount Martha must surely become a popular
place in the near future, both for permanent residence and for occa-
sional visitors. The railway will doubtless traverse or skirt it, and its
trade will do a good deal towards augmenting the railway revenues.
The hotel already in existence at Mount Martha is a marvel of
coziness and artistic comfort, but we are disposed to regard it as
the germ out of which the hotel of the future will grow.
It is a very pleasant and very suitable beginning, but a
beginning only. And how grandly, just beyond Mount Martha,
does Arthur’s Seat arise; and how pleasant is the outlook
thence down to the old village of Dromana, where also is good


entertainment and ample accommodation—fishing, bathing, and
paddling room for as many thousands as Melbourne could ever
send forth. One other little village lies between Mount Martha
and Sorrento, that is the Rosebud, a fishing-place chiefly, a very
pleasant place for a quiet afternoon, to be left, however, before
the evening, for, so far, there has not been much accommodation
provided at the Rosebud for visitors. Sorrento is the head of the
bay on that eastern side, and, as we have said, not yet connected
with the railway. A glorious watering-place, in every sense, is
Sorrento, fronting the deep, still water of the bay, looking out
also to the ocean, with great hotels, all the summer long well-filled
with visitors—the big boats run down throughout the summer
months—but in the winter practically cut off from town because
of the lack of any means of transit. Some day, of course,
we shall have the railway to Sorrento, then, beyond all doubt,
people will journey down there in the winter months as in the
summer. It is altogether a mistake to suppose that these sea-side
resorts of ours are only summer places. Sorrento is just as pleasant
in the winter as in the summer; indeed, on a sunny day in winter,
either the ocean or the harbour beach is infinitely more pleasant
for a stroll than in summer time, when the too fervent heat makes
even the quietest life oppressive. In the interests of a great
multitude of Melbourne people, it would be well to join the rail-
way with Sorrento at a very early date. It might not just pay
from the beginning, perhaps, but it is a line on which traffic
must necessarily be forever increasing. We do not get out and
about half as much as we ought in Melbourne; we do not under-
stand the beauty of our own immediate surroundings. They have
not received that advertising of which they were worthy, and failing
to take that advantage of them which we might, we lose in health
and enjoyment, and increase, therefore, the petulance and morose-
ness, and all those unhealthy and unenviable characteristics of a
people too eager, too covetous, too prone to grasp at the wealth
and miss the true zest and good which the world affords.
A branch from the Mornington line runs down by way of
Hastings to Western Port. It makes a way for visitors to the
shores of that other great bay which Bass discovered, and the


French folk occupied for a while in Australia’s very early days.
Hastings is chiefly a fishing village. Near a hundred boats put
out with every evening, and return with their baskets ready
packed for the early morning train to Melbourne.
Hastings also is considered as important from a military stand-
point. A very strong battery is equipped and drilled there, and
in connection with Langwarrin camp, passed on the railway line
is always held by the military authorities to be one of the main
keys of the strategic defence of the city.
From Hastings, or rather from Stony Point, the terminal
station, Phillip Island is reached, another tourist resort, a half
hour’s journey by boat from the pier at the railway station. The
free, open, breezy character of the place seems one of its chief
delights. There is no forest; only a few stunted gums and honey-
suckles, with the ti-trees in the hollows, making pleasant cover for
the rabbits and hares; and the deer, which they say still remain
but are not easily seen.
There are three visits which must be made on Phillip Island—
one to the Pyramid, another to Cape Woolamai, and the other to
the Nobbies, at the other end of the island. And all that is worth
seeing is seen on the journeys these involve, for reaching the Pyramid
its greatest breadth is crossed ; the island is indeed fairly divided
by the Pyramid road, and the halves are bisected by the road to
the capes. The hotels provide vehicles—stout and substantial
waggonettes —with rather plough-horse cattle, for the roads are
heavy in places, and the packing of the carriages when a big party
proposes to move out, is a work of art.
The Nobbies lie nearest the western shore. Mariners, however,
will never recognise but one Australian headland as the Nobbies,
and that is at Newcastle, New South Wales. These hillocks beyond
the Cape are appropriately named, of course. There is no difficulty
in understanding the reason why. They are actual knobs of land
left in the deep water, rounded hummocks with water-worn sides
and grass-covered caps—remnants of a long unbroken cape, which
in some remote eld stretched far out into the sailess seas. They
are seen now distinct and apart, and apparently of another order
of formation, just beyond the mainland.


Flinders, at the West Head of the bay, is another Brighton in
appearance, but neglected so far, because no means of transit
are available. You may reach it with difficulty by coach or
buggy from Dromana or Hastings, but the roads are not of the
best, and the people wait anxiously for a railway. Not a
pleasanter place in all Australia than this Flinders with its
surroundings. All the land between Flinders and Hastings rises from
the sea, not by a rude or abrupt ascent, but knoll over knoll, with
mountain caps and valleys intervening. Riding out a few miles
on the Sorrento Road a very considerable height is attained, and the
seaward view is over rolling downs. Only a few scattered trees be-
yond the road, oaks and lightwood in the gullies, with an occasional
box or gum on the hills. A broad paddock of oats may be seen
green in spring time, or in autumn white for the harvest, and
the cedars and pines about an old homestead contrast strangely
with the untilled country all around. Down towards West
Head there is a rugged hill-cap which has all the appearance of a
long-burned-out and almost worn-down volcano. The rich red
soil round about seems to justify the supposition that molten trap
rock was once spouted there. But a mile off the road inland,
and northward, there is a Devil’s Punchbowl, which all the people
of the district claim as a crater, perfect and unmistakable. It
looks like something of the sort, a razor-back ridge divides its
eastern side from a sharply-descending gully, two spurs run out
from this, and enclose a cup with a crack in its edge, over which
the lava is supposed to have at some time poured. But there
are not the rich red lands immediately around which one would
have expected—none of the unmistakable evidences of overflow
which are seen about Mount Franklin by Daylesford, or around
Buninyong by Ballarat. The true volcanic soil is found higher
up. For we rise much higher in another hour’s ride, reaching
on the Redhill proper an altitude of near 800 feet. And a fair
and beautiful country is passed on the way, hill-sides where the
roots of blown-down trees hold red soil dragged up from six and
eight feet down; soil that would grow potatoes, apple trees,
maize, wheat, oats —anything that flourishes in a temperate
climate — ! to perfection. And then on every side appears the sea


billowy, broad, and unbroken, with frequent glint of white sails
or smoke of passing steamers. A good hotel provides for the
tourist’s wants, and near at hand are the varied beauties of the
wild cliff and coast line towards the West Head and the Schanck,
and farther away for the more enterprising traveller, Sorrento and
Point Nepean.
An hour’s drive towards the Schanck, and an easy walk through
a well-timbered paddock leads to the cliff edge, from which the
Cape runs out grassy or scrub-covered, with accessible slopes on
either side, leading to patches of boulder-strewn beach. To the
right is the bold, black cliff, rising 270 feet from the deep blue water.
The lighthouse is erected on the highest point, to the left runs
the shore line towards West Head. Cape Schanck has not been
neglected by artists. Chevalier painted it and Von Guerard, and
many a student has essayed to sketch the bold outline, and paint
in the colour of the cliff walls, and the evergreen scrub and shrubs,
which the wind clips down to an even surface on its bluff crown.
It possesses all the attributes of a good subject for illustration—
bold form, rich and varied colour. Generally a patch of smooth,
bright water in the little bay on the eastern side, and wild wave
play about the rocky foreground. The Pulpit Rock stands out on
an island of basalt, beyond a chasm some twenty yards in width,
through which the waves surge incessantly, swaying the long
brown leaves of the sea kale to and fro, and fencing off the eagles,
who have made their habitation on the rocks from these cockney
pop-gun marauders, who regard all things living as created for their
sport or prey. What a soulless, empty-headed dolt he must be
who could find no other occupation for hands or head on these
rocks at the Promontory’s foot but banging at the eagles, whose
magnificent flights to and from their eyrie complete the beauty
of the scene. Pulpit Rock they call this eagles’ home, and
Ido not remember a grander isolated rock on the Australian
coast, but cannot for the life of me trace the resemblance
to a pulpit. It is, indeed, a turret of rock, resembling in
shape a steeple, broken across half way down, its shattered cap
rounded with weather wear, and covered with hummocks of coarse
grass, like patches of moss on an old thatched roof. The eagles’


nest is fair on the summit, 100 yards perhaps from the accessible
rocks at the foot of the Cape. The chasm, through which streams
for ever the ocean current, has never been crossed; no human
foot has ever trodden that eagles’ nest, or island. Does not a
suggestion of a better name come naturally there ? Eagle Rock
or Island, or more comprehensive and original, perhaps, The
Eyrie ? There is an Elephant Rock a little farther along—a
London Bridge also —and beauty spots infinite, along many a
mile of coast. Nature, indeed, has been more generous than is
her wont in distributing her beauties here. She has lavished
grandeur on the cliffs, hewn them out in wonderfully varied
contour, here a clay face, red stained with the percolation of the
iron-stone; there the Elephant Rock, a mass of basalt, black as
the rocks of the Arabian desert, its seaward face showing rudi-
mentary or fragmentary columns, and a close resemblance to Cape
Pillar, on the opposite coast of Tasmania, or to the greater marvels
of Fingal and Staffa. Far away is a triple-headed bluff, presenting
a buttress-like front to the sea, and ’twixt the capes, patches of
sandy beach, and valleys, down which creeks of delightfully cool,
clear waters flow, watercresses on their banks, ferns up the valleys
they have made, and little native trout and perch in some of their
deeper pools. It is a glorious holiday country all around, and
requires, as we have said, but a railway for the full development of
all its possibilities.
On the other shore of the bay the railway runs round by old
Geelong, by Drysdale and Portarlington, and down to Queens-
cliff. ’Twixt Melbourne and Geelong there is nothing of
importance to detain the visitors. The great estates of the early
squatting pioneers being only broken by a few’ hamlets and
settlers, and the Werribee irrigation colony, which owes its origin
and progress, as do many other things in Australia, to the enter-
prise of the Messrs. Chaffey.
And what shall we say of Geelong? To the inhabitants there
is nothing so pleasing, as that it ought to have been Melbourne.
Well, so it ought, but it is not. And Old Parramatta ought to have
been Sydney, but it is not. And between Old Parramatta and
Old Geelong there has always appeared to be a strong resemblance.


It may be a matter of sentiment, but it grows out of old oaks and
willows, and quiet moving people, and buildings of red brick that
seem weather-worn, and proximity of people of the first colonial
generations, and many other indescribable matters, which have on
one’s sentiments and notions inexplicable effects. Moreover,
Geelong no more belongs to the foreshore of Port Phillip than
does Melbourne. If treated at all, it must be treated as a city
upon its own waters. Its towers and its spires, its halls and
markets, its streets and squares must have full and ample notice.
Its parks and gardens must be described according to their worth ;
and he who would describe satisfactorily must be careful to be
adequate, and must not scruple to write at length. We all know
the good streets of the city, sloping sometimes sharply from the
bay, at others running gently over pleasant inclines. We are
quite willing to admit that they ought to have been the streets of
the metropolis of Victoria, for who can deny that it would have
been a more practicable undertaking to have shifted the bar from
the entrance to the bay proper, than to have made all the Yarra
channel deep and sweet, and its banks beautiful, as the approaches
to a great city should be. I think that Geelong should become a
pleasant resting-place for old folks. Many pioneers have, indeed,
made it their place of permanent abode. And also, it should be
a popular place for honeymooning. Possibly it is, for honey-
mooning people are far more sagacious than is commonly
supposed. They talk about Sorrento and Queenscliff, but how
many go there ? Geelong is the very style of city for them, large
enough and fair enough, and with shining examples of matrimonial
felicity on every hand. Exceptionally beautiful, too, in all its
surroundings. The Werribee track is the only one which can be
called monotonous. In every other direction there are walks and
drives of any desired length through some of the most charming
of Australian scenery—The Barwon River and the Barwon Falls,
the Moorabool Valley and the Barrabool Hills. The coast to
Drysdale, to Portarlington, to St. Leonards by the sea. The fair
road to Queenscliff and all the old Australia Felix of which the
Corio Bay city is the natural gate. Nor need the traveller ever
doubt of good entertainment in the old city. Hotels are there,


good as can be found in the land, many of them possessed of an
historical interest grown up through a full half century of eventful
life.
Drysdale comes next on the line from Geelong towards
Queenscliff. A rich and a pleasant country, with all sorts of
possibilities in it. Mineral springs, which deserve to be better
known, and then, a few miles off the line, Portarlington, which
should become a winter watering place, possessing as it does a
climate almost equal to that of Nice, and lofty hills where
magnificent views are obtainable, rising in gentle grades from
miles of hard white beach. A marvellous panorama is always
obtainable from the heights of Portarlington. Very pleasant it is
to look out thence when sun and southerly clouds are in contest,
and the attractive forces of the hills have their full effect. The
Werribee may be all aglow with sunshine and you may know
that the same streak of fine weather stretches right away to the
skirts of the Pentland Hills, and runs as a silver streak up the dell
of Bacchus Marsh; but just capping the Anakies, and rising
away, darker and darker, covering all the Mount Blackwood
Range, is the thunderstorm. Macedon has also his sable crown,
while Melbourne may be clear, though the Dandenongs are com-
pletely shut out; and a good glass would show the silver streak
of Brighton Beach. The storm king would crown Arthur’s Seat
also, and yet by the blue sky above, it might be seen that
Sorrento had fair weather. It is, indeed, very rare that any
horizon bounds so many varieties of cloud form, and all are
grand when a big south wind lifts the water and scatters the
clouds, and makes fair painting ground for that mighty artist, the
Australian sun.
On to Queenscliff, to the big hotels and the forts, the outposts
of our defence force. It is not many years since Queenscliff was
spoken of as the only watering-place of Victoria, and, indeed, of
Australia. It got the start in early days. The sailors and the
soldiers were located there, and country folks got a notion that
there was no other place so desirable for obtaining a whiff of sea
air. Many well-known citizens have built for themselves houses


out near to the cliff walk, where every evening brings coolness,
and every south wind glory of thunder and foam. The
familiar crowd on the boat divides itself between the two
heads of the harbour, and Queenscliff in addition receives
a considerable number by railway of those who can never
be tempted by even a summer sea. All find abundant camp-
ing room in the parks and reserves, and beaches enough for
paddling. I do not think the beaches are quite so bright and
pleasant as farther up the bay. There is more strewage of
seaweed torn off by the wilder water outside, which in this too
prosperous land of ours has no commercial value, and is left to
accumulate and become sometimes almost offensive. But in
compensation there is the pleasure which is always derived from
the near presence of the ocean. It is the ocean at Queenscliff as at
Sorrento, unfettered by any landmarks ahead, stretching right
away. This contiguity of true ocean water will always make the
two farthest-out watering-places popular with those who come
right down from our great inner lands for change of air. They
will not stop until they get quite out to the rim of the continent,
where the change shall be absolute as possible. They have
known so much of the winds from the pale-grey pasture lands
that nothing but the freshness of the blue waves or the white
billows will satisfy them. And ’tis just as well that it should be
so. Every holiday will bring down a few hundreds from the city
to spread about the open spaces, but generally the permanent
residents will have the place pretty much to themselves.
At the great Royal Hotel, or the kindred establishments of a like
sort, recreation as well as accommodation is found. The merry
dance is frequent, and often through the evening stillness comes
the crash of military music. The promenade on the cliffs con-
tinues far on into the moonlight hours, and gunfire at sunrise finds
again a vigorous health-seeking people out and about, and making
to the beaches or the baths. Very perfect in all their arrange-
ments are the corporation baths at Queenscliff. In addition to
the usual enclosure, a costly and well kept plant providing hot sea
water night and day.


FERN TREE GULLY
«HIS line opens up the nearest and most accessible tract
of big bush country in all Victoria. It is a cockspur
running off the Healesville line at Ringwood, and
terminating at the well-known Gully, which is,
indeed, but the entrance to one of our most mag-
nificent bush reserves. Adjacent to this station there are
20,000 acres of State forest permanently reserved, and at
some future date to be beautified into a great national park.
Beautiful it is, even in its present wild condition. The gully,
everybody knows —the home of the gigantic tree-ferns and
innumerable hart’s-tongues and staghorns, and little delicate
growths of maiden hair and lycopodiacse ; with great gums tower-
ing lance-like through thick lustrous foliage of lightwood and
mountain ash and various rich-leaved scrubs. It is a beautiful
place: restful and shady, and musical with murmurous water,
and full of memories of old courtships, and blandishments, and
languishments, and of picnics innumerable, and of every imaginable
sort. But beyond this, our well-known gully, and miles away
across the plateau of the forest, is another of tenfold beauty,
Sassafras Gully that is. And Sassafras is but one of six or sixteen
lying over here ; each gorge of the mountain face indeed is a
fern-tree or lightwood or sassafras gully, with all the beauty of
running water, and of the results of long, long efforts of some of


the fairest forms of our Australian foliage to reach upward from
their rich bed to the sunshine.
A marvellous collection of rich gullies such as that, running
down from seven miles of table land, of varying breadth, and
with an extreme altitude of 2,000 feet, is the picture to convey of
this great State forest and national park. With various reserves
about the station and valley, it is practically 20,000 acres, 30 square
miles of country, of almost tropical beauty, abundantly watered,
with many mountain heads everlastingly cool, and within
miles of Melbourne. Many glimpses of comprehensive as rare
beauty are also obtainable from its heights.
Standing on the One Tree Hill you look around, and dark and
bold there in the immediate foreground to the right, is Mt. Barnes,
and behind him Observatory Hill. Beyond them, other spurs of
the Dandenongs; a little farther away the Plenty Ranges, softened
by the distance, hazy, luminous almost, presenting that strange
appearance only seen to perfection in great snow cones flushed
with sunrise, which seems almost as illumination from an
inward light. They seem actually to radiate rather than
reflect. And the White Flats run away to their feet with
patches of cleared ground and blocks of forest, and a
hollow where a river should flow. That broad cham-
pagne from the mountains to the sea would be as fine as any
in the world did but a full-flooded Murray wind through it. But
we must travel round the landscape. Macedon is next, somewhat
as a lion couchant in aspect, and then come the Anakies and the
You Yangs, and a glimpse of water, which, being far away, can
hardly be distinguished on a misty day. But on a good day, on
the hither side of the water, Melbourne shines, the dome of the
Exhibition and the spires of many churches are clearly dis-
tinguishable, and the long white arms of the town are seen
stretching far away into the bush, while a half-dozen roads, too
straight and parallel for beauty’s sake, come right across from the
city to the hills. To the left of Melbourne the high hills beyond
Frankston are seen, and further round, the waters of Westernport
and the shores of the islands, then pleasant country of farms and
gardens near and far, and the Dandenongs forming a general


background. It is a good, grand, broad view of infinite
beauty and variety. You overlook it from a height of 1,700 feet.
It was very wise policy to open up this heritage to the
multitudes of Victoria by means of the railway, and the only
matter for regret is that the ruling powers in the land have not
yet been able to understand the advisability or necessity of spend-
ing two or three thousand pounds in making the whole area of
this great reserve more easily accessible. A first-class hotel has
within the last few years been built at the terminus of the Fern
Tree Gully line.
The main tourist line of this district, however, runs right
on by Ringwood to pleasant little Lilydale, and thence to
Yarra Glen, where are Melbourne’s nearest vineyards and some
of her chiefest beauties. The one supreme beauty of this Yarra
Glen is observable from the adjacent heights only, and only in
the early mornings. I named it once “ The Magic Lake,”
and can now do no better than repeat the description then given.
From any of the hills about the head of the Yarra valley
“ The Magic Lake ” may be seen on many mornings of the year.
The people of the hills wake up, and looking down, say,
“ Hobson’s Bay is round here this morning.” And it is not a
meaningless phrase or an exaggeration of the phenomenon which
actually appears. Immediately before the sunrise a “ death-white
mist” seems to cover all below, lying like a frozen snow-covered
sea about the bases of all the mountains, and creeping half-way
up the sides of the many spurs which jut out towards the valley’s
centre. Here and there a bold point is isolated and stands as an
island, while behind many a long cape the white sea seems to
form a cove or creek, reaching far away into the heart of the
hills. All the mountains are black then, and the sky is rapidly
changing from indigo to turquoise at the zenith, with a light like
the reflection from a brightening flame on the eastern horizon.
The sun’s rim fires the forest fringe of Mount Juliet, and a
luminous haze is instantly spread over all the mountain sides ;
the increasing light catches the surface of the lake, but not as
the surface of snow-coated mountains with couloir de rose and
rainbow hues, the “death-white” glows as burnished silver,


exactly as silver. Every encompassed hillock is set in a silver
sea—silver which slowly takes on the semblance of polished steel,
and reflects the hills above, as a mirror. No man arriving at the
mountain edge, then ignorant of the beauties which lie below,
would doubt that he looked on an actual sheet of water. The
village, the trees, the fields, all the landscape below, are as
effectually buried as cities submerged by new-born lakes. ‘‘This
is a great lake,” the stranger would say, or would doubt rather if
it were not an ocean gulf, and look east and west and north and
south to discover its entrance. He would listen for some distant
roar of breakers, and would almost be confirmed in his convictions
that he actually looked on water. As a puff of wind ruffled the
surface, and the quickening breeze troubled the depths, and the
billows rose, and breaking against the mountain walls, made spray
clouds, and apparent fountains of foam, such as we see when a wild
wind drives actual wild water against a granite face. The whole
surface rolls and rages as a lake breast in a great storm, but slowly
as the day warms, the dense vapour expands, and we begin to
understand that it is after all but phantasy. The tree tops begin
to appear, the spurs of the hill are as islands, the true water of
the river flashes as a sunbeam touches it, and slowly that which
appeared to us as water, becomes soft as finest lawn, as gauze,
web-like, filmy, drifted and drawn upward, and rapidly melted
away. Its disappearance is marvellous as its presence. What is
it ? Whence came it ? Whither has it flown ? One question is
difficult to answer as another. We may say, perhaps, in a general
way, it is only another of the beautiful water forms, and more
wonderful than any the poet-philosopher Tyndall described and
interpreted. In the days of its creation and dispersion “The
Magic Lake ” well repays a journey to the Righi, and will give
for ever to all dwellers there an occasional panorama of indescrib-
able beauty and charm. Possibly it is not very good for the
people down below, but all experience teaches that it is of infinite
service to the grapes.
Away on the gentle northern slopes are the vineyards,
St. Hubert’s and Yering, with their delightful old Chateaux and
glorious gardens and avenues. St. Hubert’s, under the care and


enterprise of Mr. Andrew Rowan, is for ever increasing, and destined
in no very remote future to become as well known in the world as
any of the historical names of Rheims or Bordeaux.
Healesville is for the present the terminus of the line, and very
pleasant tourists’ village is Healesville, with well-kept hotels
(Edgecumbe’s, the historical house), and good driving roads or
bridle tracks in all directions. Mts. Riddels and Juliet lie just
before, and indeed all the mountains and finest scenery of the
district is accessible from this centre.
Leaving Healesville, the traveller takes coach, or buggy, or
horse, and comes first on the mountain journey to the grand new
Gracedale Coffee Palace, which, standing in its own spacious and
well-kept grounds, has all the advantage of a luxurious mountain
home. Onward then runs the mountain road by Fernshaw,
destroyed in the interests of our Melbourne Water Supply, across
the famed Black Spur, and to something like a terminus at
Marysville.
The traveller need have no fear of finding all the accommodation
he may require in this country. The hotel-keepers have made
all necessary provision for travellers, and as the scenery must ever
be the chief attraction I will briefly describe its three chief phases,
which may be classed as of mountain, forest, and water.
Scenery of this description, it may be noted here, is equally
accessible from Yarra Glen, Healesville or Marysville. First,
then, I will take the mountains, and of them Monda.
Eight hundred feet up we look across rolling woodlands, and
fern or scrub-clad ravines, to the noble front ot Mount Monda;
and in the late afternoon Monda is all glorious with shadow and
shine, with vesture of pearly mist and purple gloom. There is a
broad, bare patch on his breast, which one might imagine to be
tufted grass or short heathy scrub. You think you might sit
there while the big timber aloft was waving in a gale, and look out
over the valleys and plains. How singularly erroneous is the idea.
That apparently bare patch is covered with a scrub growth twenty
feet high, through which you must cut your way with a tomahawk,
and in which you see nothing but the endless succession of pale


grey stems, with the silvery underside of the leaves and occasional
patch of blue above.
The face of Monda must be great companionship to any dweller
in the mountains. It is as the face of a great angel for ever
changing from mightiest passion to sweetest solicitude. And
slowly the people of the city are coming up here to dwell with
Monda.
To a mountain of another sort we may turn to Juliet, over-
looking all lower hills. Look away then due north ; there is a
gleam of water and a loom of land. Travel west, look right across
the Dandenongs, and you will note a familiar haze, a murky sort
of mist. Try to pierce it, test your visual organs, and if they are
fairly good you will make out the unmistakable outline of Arthur’s
Seat, thirty miles down the bay from Melbourne, sixty-five miles
from you as the crow flies. A little further west and you get the
moving cloud above a steamer’s smoke stack. And then
the You Yangs, and fortress-like Macedon. All the land
intervening appears as a dead level—a flat woodland with a few
scarcely perceptible clearings. But the Yarra flats are at your
feet as one fair meadow, and the silver shield of the Yan Yean
seems but a spangle amongst the trees five-and-twenty miles away,
with the Plenty Ranges beyond. There, boldly in the foreground,
stands Mounts St. Leonards and Monda; St. Leonards is 3,304
feet in height, Monda, 2,974 feet; and still nearer, almost round
to the north, the Black Spur, and far away beyond it
a mighty valley closed by the magnificent serrated ridge
of the Cathedral Range. Two score of mountain spurs,
looking no bigger than sea-ridges in an ocean gale, run
down and meet in this valley; the intervening gorges have been
furrowed out by the floods of all the seons ; and have these spires
and peaks of the Cathedral been shaped by the same influences ?
Is that bold point which towers above a sea of silver mist at the
extreme western point, the skeleton or the cone of some vaster
form, or did, in some unremembered period, some age when
humanity was yet uncradled, fire and smoke issue thence, with
thunder and earthquake, and did each of these four eastward
peaks make answer, and darken all the day with smoke, but illume


the night with an awful glow ? We cannot tell standing here. No
peaks in Australia present more the appearance of volcanic cones
than those of the Cathedral Range ; beyond which, far away, is a
pale, cobalt, or grey shape, which we cannot name. It must be
seventy miles from us at the least, and between its dim outline and
that other to the south beyond Dromana, there must be a distance
of 130 miles. Nor is there less than 100 miles between Macedon
west and Mount Useful east in Gippsland, though the Big Hill of
the Don Range (higher than all the named mountains of these
spurs, 4,080 feet), shuts out much of the eastward view. We see
the round-topped Baw Baw there, looking but a hillock, and a
hundred nameless ranges intervene. And all are bathed in mellow
sunlight, clothed with silver-grey mists in the hollows, and flecked
with low-lying clouds, and overhead is the marvellously vast blue
heaven, with continent-like masses of sailing cloud. Everything
tends to inspire sentiments of height and breadth, and openness
and expansiveness. Just for a change of sentiment we will
come down off the cairn, and enter that black forest on the edge
of the surveyors’ clearing.
Here is the forest on the summit of Mt. Juliet. Enter straight in,
on its black edge, and all your broad landscape and great heaven,
and light and life, and sensation of delight are gone. You are in a
place of gloom and rot and death. Decayed timber crumbles
beneath your feet at every step ; you are knee-deep in ferns—thick,
fleshly, dark, not akin to the bracken in any sense. Above is an
almost impenetrable screen of the beech foliage, the trunk of a dead
gum piercing them like some memento of death. No bird sings, no
living creature makes any sound, save the dog who has lost us for
a moment, and quests to and fro with a faint, scared yelp. All
the trunks of the trees are heavy with moss ; it is a charnel-house
of nature.
“ There was no motion in the dead, dumb air,
Nor any song of bird or sound of rill ;
Gross darkness of the inner sepulchre
Is not so deadly still
As that wide forest.”

St. HUBERT’S WINES.
Emperor of Germany’s Prize, Melbourne International Exhibi-
tion 1880-81.—Massive Silver Plate, value 1,150 Guineas.
25th April, 1881.
J. COSMO Newbbry, esq., Superintendent of Juries and Awards, Melbourne
International Exhibition. _
DEAR Sir, —In recommending Messrs. De Castella and Rowan as eminently desenflig of
the Emperor of Germany’s prize, I desire, as'chairman of the wine jury, to set forth the
numerous and cogent reasons which have influenced us in making this recommendation.
And let me premise by remarking that in the discharge of our delicate and difficult duties
we are actuated by an honest determination to discard every consideration but that of doing
complete justice to the various exhibits submitted to our adjudication, regardless of country
and of all personal interests whatever. In conducting tire trials, we were instructed to mark
our appreciation of the various qualities by numbers 21 and 20 being the highest class, 19 and
18 the second, 18,16 and 15 the third, and so on ;so that it was manifestly impossible to place
any Australian wines on a par with the very best wines of Trance and Germany', which may
be considered beyond classification. Now, as some of the samples from St. Hubert’s attained
as high as 19 points in this formidable competition, we think this fact alone speaks volumes
on behalf of the admirable qualities of Messrs. De Castella and Rowan’s wines.
It must also be borne steadily in mind that the latter are being produced at prices varying
from 225. a dozen downwards, while the carefully selected specimens of the products of the
vineyards of Germany, France, &c., are worth in many instances upwards of 100 s. a dozen.
To have received second awards in competition with the choicest wines
which could be furnished by the whole of Europe appears to us to establish
this important fact, viz., that the wines of St Hubert’s stand upon the same
level as the best wines of the world, with the single exception of those
exceedingly valuable kinds which are beyond the reach of all but wealthy
connoisseurs. Under these circumstances, and for the following reasons, we beg to submit
that Messrs. De Castella and Rowan are especially deserving of the distinguished honor which
the Emperor of Germany, with a liberality worthy of his illustrious character, and with a
thoughtful kindness characteristic of the great people over whom a benign Providence has
called him to rule, proposes to confer upon colonial industry. 1. Wine growing is essentially
an industry of this character. It is racy of the soil, and, unlike nearly every manufacturing
industry that has been established in the colonies, it envolves the employment' of purely
local processes, and purely local products, worked up by local labor. 2. The vineyard of
St. Hubert’s, embracing 250 acres under vines, of which 210 are now in full bearing, turns
out from 60,000 to 70,000 gallons per annum, and employs on an average thirty vignerons all
the year round, besides furnishing occupation for eighty persons during the six weeks of the
vintage season. 3. Because the experience of older nations has shown that the people of
wine growing countries are sober in their habits, and that the consumption of light
wines is conducive to temperature and health. 4. Because every encouragement
offered to the pursuits of husbandry in a young country tends to counteract that concentra-
tion of the great masses of population in a few cities, which has become one of the dangers
of modern civilization, and exposes such masses to be easily indoctrinated with socialistic
and revolutionary principals. 5. Because the award of the Emperor of Germany’s splendid
prize to the foremost of our wine-growers would be an honor paid to the great growing
industry which they represent, and could not fail to exercise a marked and salutary influence
upon the future development of that industry, by indicating the high position which
Australian wines have already attained, and by stamping them with the approval of so im-
portant a body as the Commissioners of the International Exhibition, and of so distinguished
a gentleman as Professor Reuleaux.
I have the honor to be, Sir, your most obedient Servant,
(Signed) B. 0. BURSTALL, Chairman. \
As already stated, the prize was unhesitatingly awarded to Messrs. De Castella and Rowan
for their famous St. Hubert’s Wines.

PASTRY, but the RICHEST OF SCONES and
PASTRY as well, and that without the addition of
eggs or anything of the kind by the user.
This Flour is a New Thing in the Market—a
Distinct Variety, not made by any other maker. It
will turn out Rich, Creamy, Smooth, Pull-Flavored,
White and Ziig-ht Baking's.
TRY IT.
ECONOMY IN CAKE.
Some little time back we caused experiments to be
made to the end of producing a Eess Costly yet
II k.ii - Class variety of BLOCK CAKE. We
desired to present to the Public a FAMILY
CAKE, which should be more generally in accord
with the want of the times; which should be a
Cioon Cake and yet be a Cheap Cake. There is
nothing like it in Melbourne at the Price.
N.B. —To Ladies and Gentlemen having charge of arrangements for Tea
Meetings, Picnic Parties, Excursions, &c., this Cake will be found specially
adapted to your wants, and will cost you much less than you would have to
pay for a similar article in the ordinary course of trade.

Wide, yes. Miles away it stretches there as black, as gloomy, as
sodden. The she-oak forest may wail out some unrecorded pathos
of Australia, the beechen shade is dumb with a voiceless horror.

Of waterfalls, the best of all, perhaps, is that by Marysville, which
is adequately described here. Across the road, along the foot of
the mountain, and up the Stevenson Valley, there is a good
bridle track all the way, but it is bordered and overhung in places
with fern and scrub growth, and the wet wattle slaps you in the
face as you gallop past, and the broad fern fronds shower down
baptism as your pace causes their trunks to vibrate, and the hazel
sprays switch, and the broad leaves of the blanket scrub drench
you, but what does it matter? You rattle on. Down in the valley
the water voice is singing; far aloft the magpie. You see the
mountain wall to the left all aglow, and down below the frequent
flash and gleam of the river water, through the nodding plumes of
the ferns, the stately heights of the gums, their trunks all silver,
the beaded crowns and spears of beech and sassafras, all the
wealth indeed of a rich mountain valley close to your side, and
immediately beneath your eye. But the track becomes narrower
now, and a louder water voice is heard roaring ahead, and the
crown of the bald head of the gorge is seen, and we watch for the
silver streak of the fall. It appears at length and suddenly, and
justifies its voice. It is not a simple fall over a cliff’s edge to a
black rock basin below, but a series of plunges, leaps, bounds,
cataracts, often divided and broken by jutting points and steps of
the rock, and bordered from the summit to the base with fern and
scrub foliage. Its voice is not thunderous, though roaring; a
pleasant melodious sort of sound, such as a moderate breeze
makes among the tall trees, and it is all silver or silver-grey when
in shadow from its first plunge over the topmost ledge till its wild
rush beneath the fern-tree screen at its base. There are rainbows
when the sun works round, and
“ Sleet of diamond drift and pearly rain,”
and other marvels of beauty common to all instances of falling
water, and I should imagine from the 500 feet of broken rock face


and some notion of the gathering ground above, that when a
thunderstorm sends down three inches of rain in half an hour,
and every hillside yields its sheet of water, and all converging
above, plunge and thunder down, there must be grandeur of sight
and sound such as is hardly approached elsewhere in the moun-
tains.
* *
Possibly the best of the really Big Bush is that on the shoulders
of Mount St. Leonards, easily accessble from the Yarra Glen
station. The Forest, the Big Bush, we are about to enter it now.
We will ride in imagination through three miles with our eyes shut,
and arrive so at an upper bend in the river, and a hollow where nature
seems to have put forth all her strength. We will open our eyes then,
not to be surprised, but delighted and satisfied. One of the great
true sayings of the prophet and teacher Emerson was that nothing
great is ever surprising. The man of fairly cultured mind is
brought face to face with the Laocoon, or with the Duomo of
Florence, or the Abbey of England, and sees only what he had
expected to see; he is delighted and satisfied, but not amazed.
Here is a greater temple than Egypt or Greece, or Italy or Eng-
land ever raised —a majesty of bulk, a grandeur of form, an infinity
of beauty, such as it never entered into the mind of man who had
not seen to conceive. Lie down on a bed of withered fern fronds
and look aloft. Ten, or twenty, or thirty feet above you (the living
crowns spread a feathery screen, through which you may
perceive a more distant web of darker foliage. It is the
spreading crown of the myrtles which rise to a hundred feet, and
yet seem but shrubs, for above them, two hundred, three hundred,
four hundred feet from their great boles by the carpet whereon
you repose, tower the living lords of the forest, the gigantic
amygaldina whose crowns of scant foliage appear but handfuls of
leaves, not larger than silver spangles.
This is the forest primeval. These are the “ awful tresses ” for
whose growth nature shaped and moulded her sacred mountain
heads. Lie still and listen; you have no need of speech. You
are alone, and there is nothing present to which you could presume


to speak. The water-voice is talking there, but it asks no ques-
tions. The lyre-bird is twittering away about his playground,
babling in many bird tongues, as if he had received some portion
of the Pentecostal dower. And suddenly a wind comes and
rustles the little leaves and smites the smaller boughs, and sends
a murmur of music along four hundred feet aloft. The little
wind passes, but the creek murmurs still, and from the rich, dark,
lustrous foliage about its banks balsamic odours rise. Listen !
Far away up the mountain side there is a louder murmur that
gathers as it nears. It is a stronger puff of wind. It strikes the
crowns of the loftiest trees, and bows them ever so slightly. They
are as lances whose fluttering pennants would wave above the
dome of St. Paul’s bowing down in thousands and tens of thou-
sands. Do you desire an idea of grandeur ? Is your ear attuned,
and your heart strong for the tremendous voices of nature ?
Then go up to the mountains and into the forest, where a wild
day dies and a great wind blows.
Stand then in the forest and see a thousand of these four
hundred feet trunks swayed and bent as you have seen reeds
by the river. Listen to the roar of a hundred thousand more
along all the mountain sides. That is another
“ Great voice which shakes the world.”
Loud as the sea, and higher, and fiercer, and more exultant, and
punctuated not infrequently by such a crash as a great ship makes
when driven with fury on to a jagged reef. It is the overthrow
of a great tree, and the sound is of the havoc of his descent. There
is music, and grandeur, and majesty abroad then, amid which
Prospero walks with eyes aglow and heart expanding, and Caliban
prays that he may creep into a rat’s hole and not die. Australia
will give birth to a poet some day who will hear that voice, and
remember and interpret a little of its word and tune. Charles
Kingsley, on Devon’s coast, could hear —
“The pillars and clefts of the granite
Ring like a god-swept lyre.”
And Tennyson the wild October morning—
“ Issuing howling out of night.”
And Byron understood the wondrous strength and surpassing


loveliness of night and storm and thunder in the Alps. As great
a voice as coast or Alp or mad north wind ever possessed is here.
And he that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
It is not a little matter that our railways have brought us, and
indeed brought all the world that chooses to visit us, into immediate
contact with scenery such as this, and it may resonably be hoped
that the wide advertisement this book will afford will induce an
ever increasing army of pilgrims to go up and out and on and
understand.


THE NORTH-EASTERN TRUNK LINE.
||| | IP HIS line is not one of our earliest, for, in early days, our
l Bg) chief efforts were given to reaching the great mining
/I Jp* centres of Sandhurst and Ballarat, and though Beech-
worth made life in the north-east, it was far removed
from the city, and not of such importance as to justify
special efforts or extraordinary expenditure. Sydney, also, in
those days, was so very remote, and the advances of the N.S.W.
lines so tardy, and their bar to any help from us so rigid, that
we did not deem it necessary to hurry on to Albury. Neverthe-
less good progress was made. It was 1872 before we reached
Seymour, and then did Seymour at once assume an importance
which has been constantly increasing. Kilmore Junction was
reached long before Seymour ; but the old Kilmore township
was left some three miles off then, and in the winter of a quite
unreasonable, but not, perhaps, unnatural discontent. We may
deal more fully with Kilmore when speaking of the Lancefield
country, with which it is more naturally associated. Seymour is
the township, and should some day become the city of the
Goulburn. Eastern and western lines strike out from the vicinity
of Seymour, traversing almost the whole course of that greatest of
sole Victorian rivers, for, though the line divides here and strikes
on to Tallarook, and the line to the Goulburn Valley at Man-
galore, Seymour is the true radiating centre of Goulburn Valley
business. To Seymour go all passengers, who desire to economise


time, by the evening express train, which dashes across the easy
country at a speed unequalled, for such a distance, on any portion
of any railway system in Australia. And then Seymour is a city
of very pleasant surroundings, abundance of water there, and
greenery of all sorts; orchard and meadow growth, fat cattle
and ripening corn ; desirable fields of rich pasture land, and the
beginning, as it seems, of a richer country than the traveller, out
from Melbourne, has so far met.
This station, 61 % miles from Melbourne, is the principal junction
of the Victorian Railways, being the point at which the Goulburn
Valley line, which runs to the Murray at Echuca, joins the North-
eastern main line. The traffic between Melbourne and places on
these two large sections of the Victorian Railway system is very
heavy. Each of these divisions connects with railways in New
South Wales, the North-eastern line, via Albury, being the route
to Sydney, while the Goulburn Valley line connects at Echuca
with the Moama and Deniliquin railway of the mother colony.
Each, besides, has many branches and connections south of the
Murray. Seymour is, therefore, a busy station, the working time-
table showing that altogether some thirty trains, passenger and
goods, pass through or start from here each way, during the
twenty-four hours, and trains are moving in or out day and night.
A great deal of shunting is necessitated by the Goulburn Valley
freight trains having to be cut up and re-made up here before
being taken on to Melbourne, the steeper gradients between
Seymour and the metropolis not admitting of the same loads
being drawn as are brought over the more level grades on the
Goulburn Valley line. Seymour is also the chief purveying
station on the Victorian system, nearly all the through trains from
and to the north and north-east stopping here from fifteen to
twenty minutes for refreshments. Recently, large additions have
been made to the refreshment rooms, so as to provide accommo-
dation for the crowd of hungry and thirsty travellers brought by
each main line train. The profitable business of catering for
passengers is let to a firm of purveyors, who are required by the
terras of their contract to supply refreshments of good quality at
reasonable prices. A set hot dinner for half-a-crown is provided


at the time of the arrival of the evening trains ; and the daily
average of diners is 200. A hot shilling luncheon during the
middle of the, day is even more largely patronised ; and travellers
by the morning trains can enjoy a substantial breakfast for
eighteenpence. Ordinary refreshments, edibles and drinkables,
are also to be obtained at the bar. The stoppage at Seymour to
dine, makes an agreeable break in a long journey ; and this
diversion is especially appreciated by passengers by the down
Sydney express. Most trains, both passenger and goods, change
engines at Seymour; and this station is also a depot for spare
live-stock trucks and goods wagons.
From Seymour, on towards Sydney, the traveller does not see
so much of the richest parts of Australia as he might desire. It
is interesting enough to Longwood, over the spurs of the hills and
the heads of the creeks. And Euroa is as pleasant a place
whereat to rest for a while as a traveller could desire. It may be
mentioned also that one of the best and best-managed country
hotels is at Euroa, and only a stone’s throw from the railway gates.
Then comes Violet Town, and up from Violet Town by the right,
indeed all along that line, from Euroa to Glenrowan, the low yet
picturesque mountains of the Strathbogie and Wombat ranges,
possessing, as is well known, a good deal of tragic and romantic
interest. Right westward from Violet Town is the rich breadth
of the Goulburn Valley, although the railway line does not
traverse a country of much actual beauty or agricultural promise.
There is more to please the eye as Benalla is neared, for there begin
evidences of semi-tropical growths. Orange groves, with their glossy
foliage and golden globes of fruit, maize fields on the river banks.
Benalla is also in itself an important place, the Broken River runs
through it, traversed by a substantial railway bridge. Its streets
are broad, well planted with trees, its public buildings good, its
hotels and private residences handsome and well kept, displaying
every evidence of a well-educated prosperity. From Benalla
the line also strikes out to Yarrawonga on the Murray, but that
we will traverse with other branches a little later on. To
Wangaratta the express drives without halt or pause, and there
finds another Victorian town with a character peculiarly its


own. Red brick houses in and about Wangaratta strike the eye,
making a very pleasant contrast with the abundant foliage of
the street avenues. Wangaratta is an old town which had its
beginning in the time of the Ovens diggings, and drew its
sustenance from the innumerable gold fields round about the
Ovens River and its many tributaries.
From Wangaratta also strike out the lines which touch Beech-
worth, one of the most important raining towns of Australia, and
Bright, the centre, perhaps, of the best tourist country. Still we
drive onward and halt at the Springs, a junction station, whence
the line strikes through the great Rutherglen wine country
and touches the Murray at Wahgunyah. Chiltern is the only
important town between the Springs and Wodonga, where our
Victorian line has its terminus. In the early days people seemed
disposed to settle rather at Albury on the north bank, than at
Wodonga on our side of the Murray ; and Albury, it must be
admitted, is still the chief town there. But a good deal of wisdom
was shown by the Victorian authorities when, in the arranging of
matters, they elected to make Wodonga the trucking station for
cattle, and to allow the passenger accommodation to be managed
at Albury. New South Wales provided really first-class passenger
accommodation for the convenience of travellers. Victoria set
herself to deal with the great mobs of cattle and horses, which,
travelling down from all the interior of Australia, focussed natu-
rally on the Murray at Wodonga, to be made up in lots, and des-
patched as required for the Melbourne market. Thousands
of cattle are discharged and re-loaded at Wodonga in every week.
Not unfrequently, sales of horses of from one to two thousand are
made in the Wodonga sale-yards, and a great population of auc-
tioneers, drovers, truckers, and general railway assistants find oc-
cupation and are established in homes there. Albury is still the
social town on the Murray, but Wodonga gets the lion’s share of
the railway business.
Our connection with the New South Wales system at Albury
is the most important we make. Thence goes the direct over-
land line to Sydney ; thence, also, that other line, which branches
off at Harden—strikes the Great Western Line of New South


Wales at Blayney, and so makes direct communication between
Bourke and the Darling River, and our City of Melbourne.
The tourist who really desires to see a little of broad Australia,
cannot do better than take this route. Let him leave
Melbourne by the early morning train, and he will reach Albury
shortly after noon. He can travel on then by the ordinary on the
Sydney lines, and in daylight, until he passes Junee. An hour or
two of darkness then, and he will arrive at Harden. He makes
connection there with the train which runs between Harden and
Blayney, and gets a very comfortable sleep while traversing some
sixty miles of very uninteresting country. Journeying on again
from Blayney, he reaches Orange about the time of the summer’s
dawn, and from Orange drives right down and right north to the
great plains and the great pastoral country of Australia. Dubbo
is the first great township, where a halt is made, and from Dubbo
the land seems to broaden and extend, and, for the first time, the
Englishman or stranger begins to understand what Australia really
is. The great rich country stretches out on either hand. Fenced-
in paddocks, as they call them, of five or ten or twenty thousand
acres, occupied by sheep or bullocks, or the still-remaining emus
and kangaroos. Not unfrequently also, a drove of emus is
seen scudding away, with their apologies for wings violently flap-
ping, scared by the approaching train. And on, and on, goes the
train, the red waste of the drought, the tall green grass of the wet
winter, or the pale gray harvest of the following summer, with broad
waving seas of foliage seen on either hand. Glimpses of sand-ridges
are occasionally seen, pleasantly breaking the dreary horizon. Cool-
aman trees also, gnarled and picturesque, running about water-
courses. Roly-poly, a pernicious-shaped picturesque herb, turned
up by the wind, and making itself into gigantic balls, spinning
across the plains, and at length, in the twilight, the peculiar outline
of Mount Oxley—the worn-down skeleton of some great
old-time mountain, but appearing rather as a mound raised by
some giant race of old, upon the great plain; and with the town-
ship, practically the outpost of the New South Wales railways, the
terminus of the greatest railway journey that the traveller from
Melbourne can make, the focussing point of all the great stock


routes from the north and west —ultimately to become the Chicago
of Australia.
Keeping, however, within our own colony, much is found to
interest a visitor in the various lines which branch off from the Great
North Eastern. First to be considered of these, perhaps, is the
Mansfield line. The Mansfield line opens up a rich and picturesque
country. It supplies the only practical route to those far inland
hamlets of Victoria where the diggers established themselves in
early days, and founded settlements, which have since been carried
on by isolated farming communities. Mansfield is the chief town
of this country, a very pleasant town, nor in its history void of
romance. Some of the oldest squatters in Australia first estab-
lished themselves about Mansfield. The Chenerys were here
long before the fifties and the gold rushes, and Mount Battery
was a noted cattle station in the days when boiling down seemed
the only way of getting rid of our surplus stock. Gradually, how-
ever, these great stations have been subdivided, a farming popu-
lation has settled on them. The rich timbered hills of the
Wombat Ranges have been taken up and cleared, and now
Mansfield is a very busy town, and all the neighbourhood is filled
with pleasant and prosperous inhabitants. Small stations and big
farms are there by the score; in the town itself, churches, public
buildings and hotels have been erected. The main street is
planted with shady trees, and a monument in the centre com-
memorates one of the ghastliest tragedies Australia ever knew.
It is a monument to Sergeant Kennedy and his brave comrades,
who were shot down by the Kelly miscreants out in the Wombat
Ranges some years ago. And from Mansfield, if the traveller
really desires to see somewhat of the inner heart and glory of
Victoria, he cannot do better than take the coach to the mining
township of Jamieson, some five and twenty miles to the south.
He will cross the Delatite and Howqua Rivers, bright flashing
streams, suggestive of perch and trout, and could they but find
their way to the open sea, salmon, grand as Ireland or Scotland
ever saw. And at Jamieson he will come to a village set in an
amphitheatre of great mountains, beside another river swift and
strong and crystal clear. And thence, if he be somewhat


adventurous, let him strike out yet again, and ride through the
ranges to Wood’s Point and Matlock, and so down to Walhalla,
whence an easy coach journey will enable him to make connec-
tion again with the Gippsland lines. Following this route, he
will, perhaps, see the best of forest and mountain glory Australia
has to show. Loftier heights and deeper gorges than any in the
Blue Mountains of New South Wales; forests whose boughs swing
to the gales three hundred feet overhead, ferns that nod down the
gorges like palms by some fairy river, and the giant scrub which
seems as a crop grown for the sickle of a Titanic reaper,
standing thirty feet high, and dense as the wheat stalks of a
cornfield, or the bamboos of any Indian swamp. It is indeed a
mighty country, though not, perhaps, to be opened up by railways
within this generation. The tourist who desires to see it must
take the summer months for his journey, and then need have no
fear of danger or even inconvenience. He will find very comfort-
able hotels in every village, and if, by any chance belated or led
astray, may be sure of hospitable entertainment from the good old
miners, the smoke of whose fires may be seen issuing from almost
every gully.
The one great tourist route, however, branching off from this
line, is that which strikes out from Wangaratta to Beechworth
and Bright. Beechworth is the great mining centre of the
north-east. A prosperous town, with good gold getting in all
the gullies of the surrounding country, and rich agricultural
ground running up all the gullies divided by the spurs of the
Great Divide. Beechworth is a city meriting more than a brief
description, more, perhaps, than can be given in such a volume
as this. It lies at an elevation which affords a delightful summer
and bracing winter climate. It is the centre of a great digging
and ever increasing agricultural country. It received, as was meet,
in early days a good deal of Government attention, and this,
supplemented by private enterprise, built up a town, some day to
become a city, substantial and grand. Public buildings here are
almost metropolitan in character, churches worthy of the wealth
of the various communions, parks and gardens ample and well
kept, and the roads all round about easy as picturesque. Spring


—the month of November —perhaps is the most delightful period
of the year in Beechworth, and those who should be fortunate
enough to be present at one of the horticultural shows of that
season would return with memories of as pleasant a locality as any
in Australia. Abundance of scenery of a more grand and
picturesque sort lies also convenient to Beechworth, which is
really the great coaching centre of the north-east. The hotel
accommodation is of course ample, and at any of the half dozen
good houses the traveller will find accommodation of every
required grade.
But it is the little township of Bright, and the roadside
station of Porepunkah, to which, perhaps, the tourist’s attention
should be specially directed. For Bright is the one centre
from which the best of our Victorian scenery is easily acces-
sible. The Buffalo lies close by Bright, the Victorian Bogong
and Feathertop also. Snow-crowned throughout the winter, and
rich with all the beauties in which the higher regions of the world
are ever clothed the summer long. It has been very well said
that Victoria, like ancient Gaul, est omnes divisa in partes tres , so
far, at least, as its scenery is concerned. There is the coastal strip,
the fringe from Cape Howe to Mount Ruskin. There is an inner
ring of mountains —Grampians, Pyrenees, Plenty, Dandenong,
Berwick ranges—with Warrenheip, Buninyong, Macedon, St.
Leonards, Honda, Franklin, Matlock for outposts; and there is
the outer circle of “ the big mountains ” on the border, with their
all-dominating peaks and their everlasting snows.
Bright is, and is likely to be, the headquarters and the starting
point for visitors to the big mountains. The situation of Bright
is pleasant and reasonably convenient. It lies on the upper waters
of the Ovens River, in a pleasant valley almost surrounded by
hills.
To reach Bright, however, is the first object of the traveller,
and about this there is not much difficulty. The Sydney express
leaving Spencer Street at 4.55, halts for five minutes at Wangaratta
at twenty minutes past 9. Connections used to be made here
with the Bright train. The journey in this way took up no busi-
ness time. The day’s work done, and the comfortable bed at


Bright reached an hour after midnight, time for sufficient rest,
and a full day on either side of the journey. This system will
doubtless be restored again in the tourist season. The journey,
however, can also be made by daylight, but it is more tedious.
The morning train which leaves Melbourne at 6.20 a.m. reaches
Bright at 2.46 p.m.
Of the scenery of the immediate district it is not necessary to
say much. There are many pleasant valleys near to the village
running up into canons amongst the mountains. And there are the
Bogong and Feathertop mountains, with many lesser peaks and
domes, accessible all summer long.
But the glory crown and pride of the district is the Buffalo, of
which we give a tolerably full description.
Great deeds have been wrought by Nature, great results do stand
in this land of ours, which has ere this been termed common-
place and tame; and to him who still doubts I would say, “Go
up to the Buffalo and dwell for a while by the music of that water-
fall, and in view of all the picture which is closed by that distant
rampart of snow.”
To those who would see all the waterfall, who would gaze
down into the dizzy depths, who would enjoy the sensation
rather than the sense of the awful, there are opportunities enough
about the gorge. Flat rocks whereon the body may be stretched
with the head craning over the edge, narrow ledges to be rounded
with difficulty, and lonely stones to be climbed with peril and
pain. I personally cannot claim the hardihood and superfluous
energy which delights in venture or effort of that sort. I like the
flat rock, and the broad view, and I wished that we had agreed to
boil the billy at the Falls, so that at least an hour might have
been passed in contemplative enjoyment. But the Buffalo is great,
and the Horn is yet distant and high, and the track by which we
must go down is at least as bad as that by which we came up, and
none of us have any desire to be out amongst the rocks or on the
siblings by starlight.
Our guide, therefore, has given instructions for the road, and
gone along a few miles to the head of “ Staker’s Track,” Thither
we follow, threading the strangely-elevated morasses again. Mile


after mile we ride beside them. They seem to cover the bulk of
the mountain head. How they were formed, and filled with deep
black spongy mould, is a problem I must leave to superior minds.
They are a series of immense basins, now, some square miles in
area, garnering in the winter immense quantities of snow, which,
melting, thunders down the falls in the early spring, or soaking
into the light porous soil drains off slowly throughout the summer.
Far up one long narrow strip of this bog land, in form like the
bed of a river, we saw the blue smoke of our guide’s fire, and,
arriving, turned the horses adrift to crop the snow grass for a
while, and sat down ourselves, in a mood to deal heartily with
“ mighty beef ” and ale, if it were forthcoming, or with good bush
tea, or the water of the springs, lightly touched with that we had
brought from the village. We were 4,525 feet aloft. But the sun
shone down fiercely at times, and there was a buoyancy and
freshness in the air which begot appetites of all sorts. We were
ready to eat and to drink, to ride and to climb. We felt like
athletes in training, only some amongst us looked, though not
one would confess to it, a little sore. And as yet we were not
half through.
“ Let us make along,” said the guide, and led the way through
a boggy creek, and up another channel amongst the rocks, where
broad-leaved wattle was blooming gloriously, though the grass
beneath bore the impress of the recent burden of snow. We had
five or six hundred feet to climb, and a mile or two of morass to
coast about before we reached the main high level, whereupon
rise those rugged trophies of Time’s long labours—the Hump
and the Horn. They came into view simultaneously. They
rose abruptly from the table land, indescribably weird, wild,
desolate, awful. If ever an Australian manager contemplates
staging the Brocken scene in Faust , let him come up here for
inspiration. Here is blasted heath and barren hill, skeleton
forest, rocks piled, strewn, wrought, as one might verily believe,
into shapes of horror, awe, and dread.
The Hump is close before us now. Its bulk is best described
as a fair-sized hill set on a great mountain. It is all rock at the
summit, rock frozen in winter and sun scorched in the summer.


Its proper finial is a mass which in some aspects takes the shape
of a mutilated sphinx head, with the hinder parts of an elephant;
a perpendicular cleavage has taken the face absolutely away, and
fancy must follow sharply on natural suggestiveness to make out
the sphinx or the elephant idea. Shapeless masses lie around by
thousands and tens of thousands. A morass patch is central in a
hollow, about which is a fringe of timber, all dead, but singularly
perfect and unmutilated. Every bough and twig remain as on an
elm or oak in winter, but barkless, bleached, white as bones.
There are black marks of fire about the trunks ; snow, following
fire, probably killed them If the least wind moans through the
grass, it shrieks through the dead trees as through the bared
cordage of a ship, and in storm time it must howl through some
of those cracks and caverns in the rocks as about the ruins of
Karnac, or those stones which Mage Merlin set up on the
English plain. It is a place where one might expect to meet
anything.
And still more weirdly suggestive does the scene become when
the Hump is rounded, and the Horn, which resembles rather the
gable of a cathedral roof, is fully seen. The morass still winds
along, but on the skirt of the ridge there are some living trees,
their foliage almost black, and above them the rock.
Is it possible that there are no remnants of design here ? Look
at that obelisk standing out against the sky ! Note the round
stone of about twenty feet in diameter poised as if it might be
toppled with a finger-touch. Sure as our eyes deceive us not, a
great grey lion has been wrought out on the hillside ; and further
along the ridge, a sheep of the days when
“ The daughters of the Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,”
has been smitten into stone; w r hile a giant turtle, stranded when
the primeval seas ebbed away, has shared a fate similar. What
is that mighty piece of ordnance mounted in the valley? No
ship bears, no fortress mounts, such a gun. Is it a relic of the
first forging of artillery of the battles of the Miltonic epic, when
mountains were hurled? We seem, indeed, to be wandering
here amongst innumerable relics of a gigantic past. Will not


some tremendous shape look presently out on us from over a grey
rock’s shoulder ?
We were much disposed to silence as we rode along between
the rocks, and did not recover hilarity till horses were hitched up
at the foot of the Horn, and the climb of the last 300 feet begun.
The Horn is a triangular peak, rudely shaped of huge unhewn
rocks. The path to its summit runs through a few patches of
swamp grass and gnarled timber to the granite foundation which
supports no life. A little labour has been expended here in
making the ascent possible, and a cairn has been erected which is
a landmark fifty miles around. It is not a fatiguing climb, and
might by a little labour be made very easy, and the reward when
the summit is gained repays much effort. The sentiment of the
grey rocks and their ghastly suggestiveness vanishes instantly and
utterly. The broad bright world rolls league on league around us
again. We are on the very cap of a bare rock peak 5,750 feet
from the great sea pavement of the world. An incalculable
expanse of sky dome is above, full five and twenty thousand
square miles of fair mother earth beneath us. The grey things
down there appear pigmies. We look on Kosciusko far away.
We can trace the mound at Corowa beyond the Murray. We see
the great Oxley and Wangaratta plains clipped round with hills,
as the waters of a broad bay half-mooned by a bold coast. We
see a hundred and a thousand hills, to north, to south, to east, to
west. We can trace the courses of the railway lines ; we can see
villages and townships as pale grey smudges ; we think we can
distinguish Beechworth between north and north-west, Australia
seems indeed to lie beneath us with all its varied life. We are
as the Strayed Reveller who had drunk of Circe’s bowl. We
understand how —■
“ The gods are happy.
They turn on all sides
Their shining eyes,
And see below them
The Earth and men.”
Is it not true that, temporarily at least, we gain something
proportionate to the height we ascend —that we not only feel, but

are larger, when high thus above the world ? “ Blessed be God
for the mountains and all that they teach and yield to us.” It is
a good thanksgiving. For these gifts are not transient impressions
—flitting sensations only. I close my eyes momentarily now, a
week after the time, and, as an actual realisable presence, the
spirit of that day comes about me again. I see, I feel, as I never
saw and felt before, the atmosphere which is the soul of the
landscape. I feel again the communion which seemed to exist
that day between earth and heaven, and open one of my worship
books and read—
“ Sweet day, so soft, so calm, so bright,
The bridal of the earth and sky.”
It is even so. There are days when the great gulf which
separates the world from that which is beyond, seems not all
void, when a spirit broods again on the chaos of our dark,
uncertain life, and we feel as though once more the words are
spoken, “ Let there be light.”
The cloud shadows are marvellous over all the uplands, rolling
away towards the white Alps. The clouds in the sky are infinitely
varied in form, and, as they move but very slowly, their shadows
seem almost anchored on the hills. We can imagine some of
them as the strange figures of the zodiacal signs. We may look
aloft with a start at others, the fancies of the weird, grey rocks
returning vividly. And then we are brought back to a little
practical, commonplace human felicity by a loud coo-e-e from the
guide, and a marvellous series of echoes from the rock-walls near
around. For six distinct echoes are borne up from a half-circle of
answering hills. O for the absolute stillness of sunrise and —a
key bugle. Yes, it would be glorious here at the sunrise. And
I do not now propose to set about imagining it, because some
day I shall most certainly pitch a tent a half-mile down below,
and make up here before the grey is out of the sky. And I shall
want a friend who has a key bugle and can play it, but who also
at need can abstain from playing, to accompany me. And thus
we will sit on the rock floor beside the cairn, like the Greeks upon
“ The ridge of war,”
glorying, and we will make such echoes as Australia has seldom


heard, and we will let fancy drift away down the cadence. And
probably we will not use any words of our own, but speak from
the book again, the sweetest echo song the world ever heard—
“ O hark, O hear ! how thin and clear,
And thinner, clearer, farther going !
O, sweet and far from cliff and scar,
The horns of Elfland faintly blowing,
Blow ! let us hear the purple glens replying.
Blow bugle ! answer, echoes dying, dying, dying.
“ O love ! they die in yon rich sky ;
They faint on hill or dale or river.
Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
And grow for ever and for ever.
Blow bugle, blow ! set the wild echoes flying.
And answer, echoes answer, dying, dying, dying.”
Such is the Buffalo, the grandest mountain Victoria knows, and
such another patch of the “ always monotonous ” scenery of our
colony opened up by the railways.*
Yet another most important branch of the Great North-Eastern,
itself indeed a main trunk line, with many cockspurs and junctions,
is that, which strikes off from the overland route at Mangalore
and bifurcating in the greatest breadth of the Goulburn Valley,
strikes the Murray at both Cobram and Echuca. Very quickly
this line, after leaving Mangalore, strikes into the rich vineyard
country, passes Tabilk, a name which in the future records of
Australia will be as well known as Rheims or Epernay, runs
through Murchison, near to which is that great weir on the
Goulburn, which backs up the water over an area of many
thousands of acres, and makes of the overflow a magnificent
cascade tumbling over a long flight of steps hewn in solid granite.
This weir is the head of the great irrigation works of the Goulburn
* Since the description of the ascent of the mountain was written many improvements in
roads have been made, and a good deal done in every way for the comfort and convenience of
travellers. Owing to the efforts of the Alpine Club the guide system has been perfected, and
first-class accommodation houses have been established at the Eurobin Falls by Mr. Mansfield,
and fair on the summit of the mountain, within three minutes of the Great Buffalo Falls, by
Mr. Carlile. Both these gentlemen are well known guides, and have always on hand horses,
tents, stores, utensils, and everything requisite for winter or summer ascents. In pleasant
little Bright. McAlpine is still to be found in his old hotel, and accommodation of all sorts is
always increasing. The road to Omeo by way of Bowshed is open through all the summer
months, and in winter the Alpine Club is always ready to arrange and conduct snow trips.


Valley. From it two main channels run out north-east and
north-west, encompassing an area of land which, through the near
future, should be as prolific in agricultural and horticultural returns
as any the world knows. Magnificent vineyards and orchards
have been already planted. Some few farmers have put down
paddocks of lucerne, and irrigating them achieve results absolutely
startling, when compared with those of the unwatered soil. There
is nothing, perhaps, that may properly be termed picturesque, or
which would be regarded as picturesque by those who only
discover beauty in the extraordinary forms of nature; but to the
traveller who desires to see, and has a desire to understand, there
is much to be enjoyed, and more, perhaps, to be learned in a
trip through the Goulburn Valley. Mooroopna is a centre of
successful irrigation. Shepparton is a much more ambitious
township, which grew in the time of the first settlement in the
Valley, and grows and increases still, gathering sustenance from
all its broader development. Before Shepparton and Mooroopna
there is a branch line striking out to Rushworth, an old digging
centre of picturesque surroundings, and another line from
Toolamba, by Tatura and Kyabram, to Echuca, this latter
traversing a rich agricultural country, and accommodating many
hundreds of farmers whose products swell considerably the annual
returns of our stations and wharves. We should be disposed to
consider the line which terminates at Cobram as the main line
here, there being every prospect, when once a sensible under-
standing is arrived at, of that line striking across the Murray and
junctioning with the New South Wales line at Jerilderie. Of that,
however, there is at present no certainty. The New South Wales
policy of the past, regardless of actual injury done to the district,
and thoughtless indeed of everything but the trade returns at Sydney,
has been to drag the produce of this district right away across
Riverina, and all the heights of the Big Divide and the Coastal
Range, to Sydney. Taking Cobram as the terminal station on this
line, a cockspur to Dookie is well worth travelling over, for at the
Dookie Agricultural College, under Government auspices, a perfect
system of scientific agriculture has been pursued for many years.
There is also a patch of very pleasant vineyard country about


Dookie, and a tramway constructed by private enterprise, but not
successful as regards financial results, running up to Katamatite.
Commercial travellers and wheat buyers know all these Goulburn
lines very well, and the tourist or the visitor who desires to under-
stand some of the great resources of Victoria, and appreciate the
enterprise and skill with which the railways have been worked to
develop the country, will do well to pass a few days here; running
along the various lines, finding good accommodation at the hotels
in every township, and learning, in the most practical way, how the
true and permanent development of Australian resource is begun
and carried out.
There is yet another line striking off from the north, and running
through a marvellously rich patch of country to Yarrawonga,
another township on the Murray. It runs out from Benalla and
follows generally the valley of the Broken River, the main tributary
of the Goulburn. It reaches at St. James another vineyard country,
and thence on to Yarrawonga, runs through a rich red wheatland,
every acre of which is held by thriving farmers, who grow richer,
and settle themselves more firmly on their holdings as each year
passes. Yarrawonga itself is a thriving agricultural township,
developed by Victorian Railways and Victorian enterprise.
Yet another short line is there, striking out north-westward,
from Springs to Wahgunyah, an old township, on the Murray
River. The chief interest on this line consists of the immense
vineyards established about Rutherglen. Ten years ago it was
all farm lands here, of considerable value for the production of
wheat, and not regarded as likely to be used for any better
purpose. Some very enterprising men, however, having realised
the value and the prospects of the wine industry, determined to
start planting there. The soil was good, the rainfall abundant,
yet not too heavy, and the climate seemed perfection. Messrs.
Morris were the first and most enterprising of these viticulturists.
They planted extensively from the beginning, and they plant still
with every year, and even when hurrying along the line, the
visitor is astonished by the unmistakable evidences of wealth


which surround these vineyard homes. The farmhouse has been
replaced by the mansion. The vines cover the gently rolling
downs far as the eye can see. The rich, red, perfectly-tilled soil
is seen in the winter over leagues of country, the bare stems of
the vines hardly breaking its surface. In spring there is the
abundant greenery, and the scent of the grape-blossom filling the
air with sweetness. While in the autumn, when the leaves begin
to take on their fierce extremes of colour, there is a blaze of
glory, of crimson gold, and innumerable tints of colour over the
same broad and glorious champaign. Yarrawonga leads out to
rich country in New South AVales, on which, however, there has
not yet been much tillage, the Sydney market being far away, and
very remote, and border duties rendering a profitable trade with
Melbourne practically impossible.
This little line being traversed, the visitor should, if he have
leisure, follow out to its present terminus yet another line, which,
running eastward from Wodonga, strikes right up the valley of
the Murray. At present it has only run to Tallangatta, and the
traveller who desires to make further exploration of the picturesque
valley and mountain sources of our great river, must, from Tallan-
gatta onwards, take coach. By-and-bye, of course, we shall push
that railway forward, for the valley of the Murray is rich as beau-
tiful. The grandest picture Australia knows is to be found on
the journey from Tallangatta onward to Towong. The stream
winds a serpentine course across the broad flats. Hills rise high on
either side, ever increasing in height till they culminate in snow-
crowned Kosciusko. Innumerable herds of cattle browse
knee-deep in grass, flocks of wild fowl make rapid courses
through the air, and only a few houses of oldest colonial people
are dotted here and there amongst trees half a century old, on
the breasts of the low spurs. The railway pushing onward from
Tallangatta will, at some further date, make all that country
accessible, and then, perhaps, we shall be for ever rid of that old
insane reproach of the ceaseless monotony of Australian scenery.
And herewith we may make conclusion of what may be called
the Great North Eastern system of lines, and will turn due west


to the overland route to Adelaide with its many branches. This,
perhaps, may best be described under the title of
The Great Western System.
From Spencer Street every evening the express train goes away
to the capital of South Australia, landing her passengers there on
the following morning. This is an achievement which, ten years
ago, would have been deemed to have been at least a century
ahead of us, but when Victoria drove her railways out to her
frontier in every direction, a spirit of emulation began to stir in
other colonies, and when Sydney had met us at Albury, Adelaide
became ambitious to get through her little desert, and meet us on
that approximate to the 141st parallel, which has not yet perhaps
been very clearly defined. Victoria was reasonably anxious
to push a railway to all her new wheat country, from Stawell
to Horsham, Horsham to Dimboola, and right on through the
mallee to Serviceton, There was many a branch line, of course,
striking out from this main route, and we will deal with each
and all of them in turn. The first line striking out is that
which runs round by Geelong to Ballarat, making almost
two sides of an equilateral triangle, when the hypothenuse
route was all the time available. Subsequently, however,
an approximation of the straight line' was made by way
of Bacchus Marsh to Warrenheip, and that line which now goes
by Bacchus Marsh must be regarded as the main trunk line to
Adelaide. It is a line with an abundance of interest to any and
every traveller, but as we have dealt with the suburban and nearer
tourist lines in other chapters, we will begin on this at Bacchus
Marsh.
It is really a sad misnomer, that Bacchus Marsh, for there is
not a square yard of marsh in the whole district. Bacchus
Marsh is a rich and beautiful valley, not an acre of which, at the
present moment, could be purchased for less than a hundred
pounds sterling. It lies at the foot of the Pentland Hills in a
warm and sunny climate. It is rich with lucerne and English
grass paddocks, with marvellous orchards and stud farms. Round
about it are really magnificent seats of the wealthy people of


Australia, and all the winter long, while the snow comes down, and
the rain beats, and the hail pelts on Ballarat above, Bacchus Marsh
is always snug and warm, and only too dry. It is indeed a place
where a visitor might well halt for a day or two, but the majority
hurry on until they come to Ballarat.
We cannot pass Ballarat lightly by. Ballarat is the first inland
city of Australia. Ballarat is the cradle of our earliest goldfields.
Ballarat is also a city set upon the mountains, built, and possessed,
and governed by people who have a resonable and justifiable
pride in all their surroundings, who love their city well, and
spend their substance therein. They make their homes there,
and are a home-loving people, free of all foolish desire to change
and in days to come they will be the backbone and the mainstay
of the colony.
The first glimpse of Ballarat, obtained from the heights of
Buninyong, is one of the finest. On a midsummer eve the
express should arrive there just at sunset, and thence from an
elevation of near 2000 feet the visitor looks down on the city,
and beyond it to the shimmer of the lakes and the great round
volcanic hills and the granite ranges far away. Mount Emu is
seen from these heights, far out on the western plains and beyond,
the lurid bar of the sunset. It is from this height, or further to
the south, on the Melbourne Road which skirts Buninyong, that
old pioneers must love to pause and reflect, and recall the past,
and look down on the marvel in whose creation they themselves
had so noble a part. The men of the present generation see but
the great city with its noble streets, its stately public buildings,
its beautiful houses. They note, perhaps, how a sentiment of
philanthropy, of charity, of proud citizenship, rather than devotion
or sacerdotal or sectarian pride, have made it
“ ’spire to Heaven.”
Fair in the city’s centre one sees first the beautiful Gothic spire
and pinnacles of the Benevolent Asylum clear against the sky,
and then the grand fagade of the hospital and the high tower of
the city hall. The churches are not strikingly prominent, and the
foundations of the cathedral will not be completed for a year to


come. But the public schools make a goodly show, and even a
brief survey of the buildings seem to justify the boast made by an
old citizen, that there is no city in the world where helpless
infancy is so tenderly guarded, suffering so generously alleviated,
and poverty-stricken old age so well provided for, as in Ballarat.
Very proud is every old pioneer of the city, and not un-
frequently does one such break out in the overflowing of his
joyfulness in something that seems to him to be poetic expression
of national thought. Thus in dedicating a very useful guide
book, the author says—
“ A Garden City,” bright and fair to view,
From our primeval forests quickly grew ;
Founded on gold, her portals surely stand,
While truth and honor guide our favored land
Set like a gem, mid’st fields of waving grain,
In richest pastures, flocks of purest strain ;
With crystal lakes and mines of sterling worth,
“ The Golden Centre of the Sunny South.”
And if the rhyming of the last couplet had been better .we should
have had no quarrel with that verse. Though truly there are
other reasons why Ballarat should and must attract ever increasing
visitors. We know the summer is hot and trying in Melbourne,
and the sea lies between us and all the coolness of Tasmania
and the snow-covered ice-pinnacled glory of New Zealand. But
how few are the people who understand the advantages of Ballarat
through its elevation only.
“I thank God,” said the philosopher Coleridge, “that whatever
may have been my bodily distempers and bow r el disorders, my
head hath been always as that of a great mountain aloft in the
blue heaven and the clear sunshine.” And so might Victoria
say, if she were wise enough to recognise Ballarat as her head.
Even in summer the nights are always cool, and winter is winter,
nipping, eager, bracing, health giving. 1437 feet above sea level
does make a difference to climate, and tells in the most practical
way perhaps, in the unmistakable record of vital statistics. Thus
speaks local authority on this matter.
“ While on this subject it may be stated that, notwithstanding


the large accumulation in the District Hospital of sickness and
suffering from all parts of the country, Ballarat stands A 1 as a
healthy locality. Even seaside Geelong has a mortality of 18.50
per 1000; Melbourne, 18.74 per 1000; and Sandhurst, 22.85 P er
1000 ; while Ballarat, with its asylums, and its dangerous mines,
is only 17.08 per 1000 : and in Ballarat East, where the hospital
returns are not included, the death rate is only 16.06 per xooo,
being less than any other part of the colony.”
But of the city itself you get a full and fair view of its main
features by travelling right in east and right out west, along the
magnificent avenue which forms its main street. Hotels may first
be sought perhaps, and truly of these there can be no complaint.
Craig’s, the development of the first house opened on the goldfield
in 1852, is equal in architecture, appointments, and solid comfort
to any hotel in Australia. It is the house of the landed gentry
round about, of the hunt and coursing meetings, of dinners and
breakfasts, and all the functions which appertain to prosperous
social life. Any visitor may be sure of cordial welcome and good
entertainment at Craig’s, and will find in its spacious saloons and
comfortable rooms as good company as the colony affords.
Lester’s is another great and good and somewhat historical house,
and amongst others well deserving notice are The George,
Brophy’s, The Palace, and also the Coffee Palace, a very excellent
institution of its sort.
Amongst the attractions of the place, first for ever, probably,
will be the great mines and the old historic diggings. The
gigantic mullock heaps and the disemboweled hills lie around
the city on every hand, and attest the vastness of the efforts which
have here been expended in the craft of gold winning. Nor is
digging by any means a thing of the past. Many great mines,
which need not be specially named here, are still in full work,
and the visitor, curious in such matters, may see the whole pro-
cess of alluvial and quartz mining carried on with the most per-
fect machinery, and under the most elaborate and scientific pro-
cesses the world knows.
But the glory and the pride of Ballarat are centred in the
gardens. Beautiful in every season of the year are these gardens,


stretching around all the shores of Lake Wendouree. The lake
itself has been developed from the reedy swamp of the old days,
and now affords ample scope for light draught steamers, yachts,
and pleasure boats beyond count. Acres of reeds still remain
the haunts and sanctuaries during shooting season, of wild fowl
of all varieties. Fish—trout, bream, carp, and perch, long ago
introduced —have done remarkably well, so well that a good and
perhaps lucky angler has in four hours with a single line taken
out forty-one pounds weight. The gardens were planned and
planted with rare skill a great many years ago, and now with
spacious, well-shaded lawns, bright parterres of flowers, ferneries
where hours may be spent, and camelia houses for a winter show,
make as delightful a pleasaunce as Australia knows.
And the statuary, far and away the finest group in Australia,
is housed in a dainty little pavilion amongst the pines and elms.
It is Benzoni’s Flight from Pompeii, a work to visit which alone
would well repay a journey from Melbourne. Out in the open,
too, stands Mr. Percival Ball’s grand statue of Wallace, and many
another work of minor merit adorns the grounds. Ballarat, indeed,
is sometimes called the City of Statues, so much has the bounty
of Old Pioneers—Mr. Soddart chief amongst them —done for
decorations in this way.
In the gardens also the English blackbird and thrush flit about
unmolested, and consequently very tame, making music in the
early morning such as may be heard from the blossoming hedge
rows on well preserved coverts of a great English estate. It is
true, indeed, as is often asserted, that without a visit to the
gardens on Lake Wendouree, no visitor has any fair idea of the
developed beauty Victoria has to show. Returning citywards
from the lake, how grand also is the view dowm Sturt Street.
The leafy plantation in the centre of the broad road, church
spires frequent and towering, amongst the lower roofs the tow r er of
the city hall, vibrating may be with the sonorous chimes, the
magnificent buildings of hospital, benevolent asylums, and
orphanages, embosomed in their well planted, handsome grounds,
the solidly-built banks, the post office, the great hotels, the eastern
town, rising again beyond the densely peopled flat, and bold


against the sky the great wonders, Buninyong and Warrenheip,
for ever unchanged and unchangeable. It is a noble and a beautiful
city, and destined, beyond doubt, to a great future. Its every
institution is founded in solid style, churches, schools, colleges,
even the art gallery, chiefly through the liberality of Mr. Martin
Loughlin, makes claim to some of the best pictures ever
imported to Australia, and affords a very pleasant place of refuge
and delight if inclement weather makes outdoor enjoyment
impracticable. Ballarat should become Victoria’s summer, spring,
and autumn city. A place of retreat and recuperation for all
dwellers on the more heated lowlands, and those many people who
cannot for ever live healthfully within the influence of the sea.
Of the country round about it is difficult to speak too highly.
Eastward lies the old Bullarook Forest round the skirts of Warren-
heip and Buninyong. Westward the lovely country of Lear-
month and Burrumbeet, Ercildoune and Dowling Forest. The
forest or water reserves are passed through in the approach to the
eastern agricultural lands, and well worthy are they of visitation,
and very highly are they prized by all Ballarat people.
The double duty of providing both timber and water occurred
long ago to the Ballarat Water Commissioners, and they studied
all the necessities and opportunities, and seem to have satisfied or
made the best use of all. The necessity of tree-planting was
early recognised, and now far up in the hills, where once stood the
native forest of gum, just slightly brightened and beautified with
occasional wattle clumps, and lightwood, and cherry trees, are
groves of the young saplings which have sprung up in the place of
the old trees, interspersed with all manner of English, and Euro-
pean, and Oriental trees, broken up with belts and plantations of
pines, forty feet high, strewing all the ground with their long brown
needles, and making dense perpetual shade over the little bubbling
creeks whose waters are nursed for the supply of the reservoirs
below. In all, more than a million trees have been planted, but
there was not much idea of financial profit in the planting till a
practical forester appeared, who is now in sole charge of the
reserves, and who promises in 'a very few years to make them not
weather improvers only, but good paying concerns.


But there is more than these practical uses and money
profits to be made out of the reserves. They are near to the
city. They are high, shady, cool, and pleasant. The people
claim them as picnic grounds, and the commissioners long ago
considered their claim, and wisely decided rather to satisfy than
oppose it. They worked as earnestly and practically to educate
the people as does the forester to educate the trees. They go so
far even as to make fireplaces, where the billies may and must
be boiled. They even provide firewood, so that there shall be no
excuse for breaking down trees ; shelter and shade houses, also,
and all things necessary to prevent pollution or destruction in
any way whatever. And it is encouraging to learn that their
efforts have not been in vain. The Ballarat people who visit the
reserves are orderly and well conducted. Respectability vastly
preponderates, and would deal very promptly and effectively with
any attempts at larrikinism or destruction. And I am told that
this good spirit grows and increases in Ballarat. There is an
honest pride and jealous care for the beauties of all the reserves.
Regulations are willingly kept, and acts of vandalism or deeds of
theft unknown.
Out from the water reserves lies the Bullarook and Bungaree
country, which sweeps around here over many a rich mile from
the Dean country by Creswick through all the whole forest area
and about the mounts of Warrenheip and Buninyong, to the end
of the volcanic soil, which usually sets a limit to profitable
cultivation. Remnants of the old forest survive and assert
themselves everywhere around. As the overthrown columns, the
half-buried foundations of the cities of old appear in the Asian
and the African deserts, so do the gigantic logs and stumps lying
about the paddocks or piled in the fences appear here, and
occasionally a living giant has been spared ; a huge picturesque
trunk and crown, which offered no prospect of profit to the timber
or firewood getter, making shade and beauty in the corner of a
broad ploughed paddock. Thousands of tons of timber —stumps
and roots and gnarled trunks —are frequently piled up in a half-
mile of fence, forming a barrier which might well shock the
nerves of the stoutest-hearted steeplechaser. They are put there


to be out of the way as much as to make a fence, and they serve
also to give an idea of the prodigious amount of labour which
has gone to the clearing of this land. No marvel, perhaps, that
the old residents, the first generation, had not much spare time or
spare money to make elaborate improvements or to build fine
houses. They were fighting for the means of life almost like
some of their ancestors of prehistoric ages, and so possibly they
became set in those peculiar habits which still characterise them.
Still we must give the Bullarook and Bungaree settler fair
credit for all that he has accomplished here. He has destroyed
the forest, or perhaps it would be more correct to say he has
taken the forest which others have destroyed, and has made of it
the best agricultural country in Australia. They are beautiful to
look upon, these fat furrows sloping away from the road, and
running far up the sides of Mount Warrenheip, varying in colour
from a rich chocolate to deepest black. Warrenheip still keeps,
and should always keep, the fern and timber crown which of old,
the old folks say, gave him his name. Warrenheip—Warraneep
—Warrenyeep—such was the original name, signifies in the blacks’
language emus’ feathers ; and the whole mountain was originally
so thickly fledged with ferns, that the imaginative black saw in it
a resemblance to some gigantic emu’s back with dry plumage
rustling in the wind. The potatoes come right up alongside the
ferns now, and it is time perhaps that a little care was given, and
limitation even, to the useful potato culture, and to the
preservation of those tall feathers which we begin to understand
have much influence in promoting and regulating the rainfall.
Very near to the base of Warrenheip is the chief village of the
forest, the township of Bungaree, which is a very fair embodiment
of the genius of the place, not much that is grand, or glorious,
or aesthetic, but a good deal that is amusing and characteristic.
Notable bar-rooms, with well-worn floors, where, doubtless, jigs are
rattled off at times to the music of the Irish pipes, and shillelaghs
flourish at times, and. may be, a crown or two gets cracked. And
there is a wooden court-house near by, where a final adjustment
of all disputes is made. There is lots of business in the
courthouse, for the Irishmen on Bungaree gets blue-moulded for


a beating at times, even as his ancestor in Tipperary. But
his rows and his ructions, his untidiness and his dirt, all admitted,
there is still a marvellous difference between the Bungareean and
Tipperaryean—the Irishmen in Australia and the Irishmen at
home. Here rents are paid, and purchase money also. Here a
wild land of monstrous stumps and dense undergrowth, and boggy
creeks and steep hillsides, is transformed into good rich farming
country. Here, instead of the heritage of wretchedness and
poverty, well seasoned with hatred, a fair and unencumbered
freehold is bequeathed; and here, when the state schools and
free intercourse with English and Scotch neighbours shall have had
full effect, the next generation should find a good Australian
community, well-to-do themselves, and doing a great deal for that
grand town whose shadow will never grow less in Australia.
A fair picture this of the Bungaree country, and very strangely
does it contrast with Learmonth and the western side. A
broad land there, and rich with the decomposition of the rocks
of innumerable years, which forms an inexhaustible soil. From the
saddle back hill in the western or Burrumbeet country, a view is
obtained which no visitor should miss—Australian in its breadth
and general form, yet very English in its colour and atmosphere.
Learmonth to the right, and Burrumbeet to the left—the one a
picturesque little sheet of water, the other a fine inland sea
twenty miles in circumference. Round about and far beyond the
lakes rise those peculiar rounded hills which stud the Creswick,
and the Daylesford, and the Smeaton, and all this western
Ballarat country, rich to their summits, ploughed to their
summits in places, and dotted, not fledged, with too rare trees.
The Mount Bolton and the Ercildoune Ranges are granite,
gently serrated, or at least broken on their ridges into irregular
lines. A gleam of sunshine strikes momentarily across
Learmonth, and makes the grassy points running down to its
beaches shine, and its ruffled surface flash and glisten. But it
is only a vagrant gleam. There are clouds innumerable coming
up with the increasing gale, and the rift is patched over, and all
the world is grey again. It is so grey over Burrumbeet now that
one scarcely distinguishes the water from the clouds, but there is


a line of yeasty foam far away, where the mimic waves break on
the rocky shore. And over all the level land which slopes from
the lake to the foot of the hill, dull green patches of grass and
brown fallows are seen, with houses just distinguished through
the mist, and trees as tall grey-sheeted ghosts. A broad and
fair country, but not to be compared with that which opens up on
the other side which lies round about Learmonth, and slopes up
to the Ercildoune and the Mount Bolton Ranges. You see
probably three score or a hundred homesteads here, and away
beyond the lake is the village of Ercildoune, with its abundant
pines and well-planted gardens, and occasional housewalls
gleaming. And how merry is it in this grand country, when as
happens with every week of the winter months the Ballarat
Hunt meets at some hospitable old home, when scarlet coats flit
across the fields and fly the fences. All the folks of the
neighbourhood crowd the rooms. Tables are spread for all
comers in diningroom and hall, and, if necessary, in barn and
store. Every man who passes looks in and is welcome. And
the roof-tree rings with “John Peel,” and the hounds are cast off
at the gates, and the merry procession sweeps away over furrow
and fallow, and hedge and fence ; and there is contrast of colour
to delight the soul of an artist, and a zest and spirit which
makes every new and sound-hearted visitor tingle with joy. Aye,
it is and ever will be a glorious place, this good old City of
Ballarat with all its surroundings, and ’tis sad to bid it farewell
even in the pages of a railway guide book.
From Ballarat the main line drives onward through magnificent
pastoral country, by lakes, and rich green downs, and strange-
shaped volcanic hills, whose rich soil produces the best pasture
in Australia, until Beaufort is reached, a town which has risen on
the old Fiery Creek diggings; and then, after another hour,
Ararat, a very considerable digging town, set ’midst very
pleasant surroundings, midmost in some of the most picturesque
country of the colony. Ihe Pyrenees lie round about Ararat,
fair conical-shaped blue hills, not of any lordly height, but still
sufficient to take and hold the atmosphere, and produce those
ovely tones of blue which, from a distance, we see sometimes in


the angles of great cathedral buildings, as in the crevices and
gorges ot mountain ranges, whose summits do not touch the
snowline. A very great deal of natural beauty surrounds Ararat,
a valley of the Avoca is near by, rich in beauty as that which of
old inspired the genius of Moore. Also much of picturesque
and beautiful towards the upper sources of the Wimmera,
which springs out of Mount Cole, and flows right north,
forming one of those inland rivers which make their way to
the plains, and wind away a devious course through the Mallee,
losing themselves in the sandy waste in times of drought, and
in floods filling the great long lakes, and ultimately, through
underground sources, throw themselves into the Murray, or flow
through limitless beds of drift to the sea. The country residence
of the Governor, Lord Hopetoun, was last year fixed at Crowlands,
near Avoca. A lovely old house, with gardens and pleasure
grounds made perfect through many years by the well-dowered
genius of Mr. John Wilson, a brother of Sir Samuel Wilson,
whose name now-a-days is almost as prominent in the English
court journals as that of any noble of the land. From Ararat,
Adelaidewards, we go by the Great Western to Stawell, and at
Great Western we find one more of those centres of that great
coming industry of Australia, the vine-growing and wine-making.
Some hundreds of acres are here planted with vines, and, strange
to say, not in a kindly, open, red-soiled country, but on rugged
hill sides, which, in their primitive condition, were sparsely
clothed with forests of poor gum timber. . The genius of the
wine-maker, however, discovered that this soil, and aspect, and
climate, were eminently suited to the growth of grapes which
would make the very best of wine. The very best of wines the
Great Western vineyards have produced for many years now, as
records of colonial, intercolonial, and international exhibitions
testify. Stawell, next beyond the Great Western, is a town of
very considerable importance, set upon the edge of the great
grey plains. Stawell is almost exclusively a quartz-mining town.
Some of the deepest mines in the world are there, the Magdala
at one time challenging comparison in this respect with any in
the world. Like other mining centres, Stawell began in the

Is one of the oldest and most notable landmarks of Ballarat. Its history dates from, and is
intimately associated with, the very earliest phases of tented goldfields’ life of the days gone
bye. With Ballarat it has risen and, as of old so now, represents the aboriginal interpretation
of the word *• Ballarat”—‘‘A Resting Place” —a home for those whose wanderings may lead
them to the Golden City of the South.
Ballarat —The Garden City of Victoria—stands 1437 f eet above sea level, and is the
centre of a vast Agricultural and Gold Mining district. Its elevation above the sea gives to
the climate a temperature more moderate than that of nearly all the other centres at similar
or greater distances inland ; and its salubrity has made it a place of resort by invalids
requiring a bracing air without the Alpine severity of the mountainous parts of the Colony,
and without the arid heats of Melbourne and Sandhurst. Official returns of vital statistics
show that we have in Ballarat the healthiest centre of population in the Colony
The City covers an area of four-and-a-half square miles, and contains over fifty miles of made
streets. Its population is about 43,000.

early days with alluvial work, but very quickly it was found that
the gold here was held fast in its native matrix, and not to be won
by any process of cradling or sluicing whatever. Quartz-rock
had to be quarried, to be thoroughly calcined in the kiln, and
then crushed to impalpable dust by the everlasting thunder of
the stampers, which, night and day, seems to fill the air. Many
a man has grown rich in Stawell. Many pleasant homes round
about attest the prosperity of the present inhabitants. Good
comfortable hotels are there, wherein the traveller or visitor
may find as much comfort as anywhere else in Australia. Good
streets, good roads, good gardens and trees, luxurious as may be,
considering the somewhat unkindly character of the soil. From
Stawell, the Grampian Ranges are always visible, and a tramway,
constructed by private enterprise, runs out to Mount Difficult,
where building stone of a very excellent quality is obtainable.
All round about Stawell, also, and out on the line as far as
Glenorchy are various diggings of greater or less importance, but
at Glenorchy all these change. There begins now the great
agricultural country; there in the old days began the great
pastoral estates, there we come fairly to the edge of the great
■Wimmera land, which, stretching away north, north-east, and
north-west, will ultimately become one of the great wheat-pro-
ducing areas of the world.
The main line runs round a curve, which does much to lengthen
the journey to Adelaide, by Murtoa to Horsham. Then Horsham
is another town at which it is necessary to halt awhile. A town
which grew into sudden importance at the time when the free
selectors took possession of all this country. It is a very thriving,
busy, bustling place now, with its flour mills and stores, its
hundreds of farmers coming in from all the surrounding neighbour-
hood, its little branch line running out by Natimuk to Norad-
juha, and well kept roads traversing the country in half-a-dozen
directions. Though Horsham may have declined somewhat in
importance perhaps since the railway went on to Dimboola —for
Dimboola lies still more within the wheat-growing country —here
the visitor may see, when the harvest is ended, stacks of wheat at
the station, hundreds of yards in length, farmers’ waggons full


laden at every store, and trains steaming away cityward, every car
heavily laden with the one commodity, the magnificent wheat of
the new agricultural lands. And good wheat land still is found
right onward by Kiata, Nhill, and Kaniva, all townships of less
than five years’ growth, to Serviceton, where, on the border, the
train from Adelaide meets us late at night, and takes us right
into the great South Australian desert. Happily, by the express,
we always enter that desert in the still hours of the morning,
when, comfortably stowed away in the sleeping-car, the traveller
should be sound asleep. On and on thunders the train, through
the wild waste, and which no one cares to inhabit, which the
rabbits hold in absolute, we fear, almost perpetual possession,
stopping for water only at one dolorous roadside station, and
passing nothing that is not disheartening and dreary, till at
Tailem Bend the line strikes the valley once more, and rich,
open plains, lightly timbered, take the place of that fearfully
monotonous wilderness. Tailem Bend is reached at the dawn
of a summer’s morning, and very pleasant is the outlook as the
traveller awakens there ; and tolerably pleasant country is crossed
till Murray Bridge is reached, where at about seven o’clock,
the traveller finds an excellent breakfast spread, and afterwards
thunders across the bridge, and enters straightway on a country
thickly settled with a prosperous, quaint, and old-fashioned sort
of people. Germans preponderate amongst them, and more
and more of the German element is found as the mountains are
approached—the mountains which lend such a charm to Adelaide,
and across whose crest, and down whose seaward slope the train
makes to the flat but beautiful city, the capital of South Australia.
The termination of that overland journey is made through the
morning hours, Adelaide being reached at eleven, or eighteen
hours from Spencer Street.
The Western Line.
What we may term perhaps the Western Line is that which
strikes through the Werribee country to Geelong, and thence
by way of Colac and Camperdown to Warrnambool and Portland
and Hamilton and Casterton, some day, doubtless, to strike


over the border and meet the South Australians at Penola, We
have dealt with the country ’twixt Melbourne and Geelong,
and with the old Corio Bay city also in another place. On this
route now we make due west, skirting the old colonial country
about the Moorabool Hills and Mount Moriac, and passing
pleasant and prosperous agricultural villages, and reaching a centre
of a new country at Colac. Colac may perhaps be called the
chief # town of the great south lake land. It lies on the banks of
its own beautiful lake, and the great Korangamite, largest inland
sea of Australia, is but an hour’s drive away. Nearer are the
Warrion’s, rich volcanic hills, where of old the magnificent short-
horns, which have given character to half the herds of Australia,
were bred and sold. Now they are almost all subdivided into
farms, and very prosperous and well contented folks are the
tenant farmers. Out beyond the hills the great lake stretches
sea-like, and beyond the lake again the broad estates of the
western district squatters, brown or pale grey, in the summer time,
but in winter all verdant and glittering with patches of water, like
multitudinous spangles.
Here is a picture of that western country and a glimpse at its
chief sport: —“It is late in the afternoon, and the sun is not more
than 15 deg. from the horizon, or, as a sailor man would say, two
handspikes high. He breaks the clouds for a moment, and
striking right across the plains makes a momentary patch of silver
on distant Lake Korangamite, beyond which, in deepest indigo, if
not absolute blackness, are piled up the storm clouds, on the
inland edge of that cyclone which stirred our harbour depths and
w’asted our shipping on the black Friday of this month of June.
They roll around half the horizon. All over the plains while the
sunlight lingers there are breadths of grey and breadths of green.
Grey where the tall tussocks grow r and the hares couch, green where
the sheep nibble the short sweet grass, and, far as the eye can
reach—evidence of the late good squatters’ weather —innumerable
patches, flakes, spangles of water. Opposed to that swart eastern
rampart of the storm clouds are Mount Elephant and the Cloven
Hills. The former a huge mound, as a cone broken at about
one-third of its proper height, with outlines softened and rounded


by the wear of the weather. Bare almost he appears, for the
lightwoods and honeysuckles which are dotted about his huge
back are no more distinguishable at this distance than are the
coarse hairs on portions of the elephant’s carcase a chain
away. The Cloven Hills are divided by a great gap, and there is
a momentary glow while a ray of sunlight strikes along their
ridges, but all the hither side of the greater bulk of Mount
Elephant is in shadow and gloom. The fine plantations dotted
around the west and south seem but smudges, they are so far
away, for the coursing party are set in an almost utterly bare circle
of at least ten miles diameter. It is a good characteristic Aus-
tralian picture. There are a score of traps and about five-and-
twenty horsemen. The traps form a rough sort of semicircle, the
horsemen the usual irregular line. They are all dark, and the
only two specs of bright colour are the scarlet coats of the judge
and the slipper. The whole group might almost be described as
resembling some gigantic blossom on the plain, its colours the
reverse of those of Sturt’s desert pea. Only the extreme points of
the petals bright, calyx and corolla sombre or black. If the
women of the plains had an eye for colour they would make
Ridinghoods of their girl children, and line all their ’possum rugs
with red. So you may picture the scene in repose, and it only
varies when, as in the morning puss starts, the hounds are slipped,
and the scarlet of the judge’s coat flashes meteor-like about the
plain.”
At and about Colac also, it must be remembered, is very
excellent sport of all sorts. Fishing, the best perhaps in Australia,
and shooting always amongst the rabbits, every variety of water-
fowl throughout the season, and occasionally quail and snipe.
Camperdown comes next to Colac as a township of some import-
ance, and about as pleasant a stopping place as one “ doing ” the
colony leisurely could desire. Camperdown is another lake-side
village, and like Colac is set beside picturesque hills. Leura and
the Sugarloaf rise close beside the lake, and their easily accessible
heights command a magnificent view of all the surrounding country.
The great plains roll away northward, the billowy forest ranges of
Cape Otway are to the south. The town stands fairly on the


edge of the forest and the plain country, and some of the nicest
homes of Australia are within easy driving or riding distances.
Lara is there, and Titanga and Glen Ormiston, and the homes of
the Manifold family, with Mac’s innumerable-all good old Colonial
people; and the strange Cloven Hills are seen, and the Elephant,
and frequent on a summer’s day strange effect of mirage and
atmospheric phantoms, and in winter such a glimpse as this,
described as seen, and without any excess of colour or exaggeration
of any sort :
“ The sun was indeed prepared to show what he could paint,
even in the cold sky and the monotonous face of the western
country in the winter. A stroke ‘ from a stormy winding sheet ’
had bared a hand’s breadth along all the western horizon—a
ribband of greenish blue, through which the great face of gold
shone, but with a dying and smiling rather than a burning light.
There was a sharp shower falling, and all to the eastward an
unbroken breast of heavy grey cloud. Thereon Iris will be formed
directly, as on the eye of a god. The full light floods and flushes
Elephant and the Cloven Hills, and catches every little height and
prominence from west to visible east. And then there is a picture
which one must evermore remember, but can never adequately
describe. There was, if my mind took any accurate impression
of that even glow, neither purple, nor violet nor orange nor red,
save in the Iris, which sprang almost to the zenith. Mount
Elephant and the Cloven Hills shone, but with such a light as is
sometimes seen in the luminous depths of the sea. Every blade
of grass that caught the low light flashed or twinkled ; but its
colour was the most intense, the most vivid of all imaginable
greens. Every leaf on the long line of the gums that looked to
the westward shone, the wet surfaces appearing as flakes of silver
laid on a body colour black as the side of a hearse. The outlines
of the stone walls were so softened, they seemed even in the
nearer distance as trimmed hawthorn fences. A horseman riding
home across the wold was magnified to gigantic size. A great
dun-coloured horned beast stood out on a little hill. Moving
through alternate breadths of light and shadow in the avenue was
the solitary figure of a lady. Out on the lawn, all gorgeous for a


moment, was the peacock; and for a second, one might say, the
finger of God touched the black hand on the dial, though the
weatherworn figure of the grey stone man below was not illumined.
And though the rain ceased, the great Iris shone out above, as if,
indeed, the eye of the God of the Infinities had opened wide for
a moment’s space on this poor world.
“ But even while the human eye was fixed, suddenly, as when a
curtain is drawn, the sun set, the light died, Iris paled as if reced-
ing, and the twilight moment was dreary as his predecessor had
been eerie, though bright; as if the setting sun had been a signal,
the rain fell and the wind came. Down, then, in perfect unison,
like a rank of living sentient creatures, controlled by a single
impulse, bent the long black crests of the gums, bowing like
mourners, while all the east darkened as when a shroud is covered
by a pall.”
Terang after Camperdown, and from Teranga cockspur running
out to Mortlake, the village by Mount Shadwell. Pleasant
villages these with fat lands all around them, and Mount Shadwell
the latest-cooled and yet one of the richest volcano hills of all the
west. A little description of this characteristic mountain may not
be out of place here. It is a great green hill set in a great plain,
a landscape which dwells perpetually in one’s mind, of and on
which it is easy to depict a tremendous past, and a marvellous
future. Rising on the Mortlake side, from the partly drained
basin of an old lake, the hill slopes gradually for a mile, breaks
then into more abrupt ascents, and about the summit divides
into valleys and hollows, which in their day have been terrible
places indeed.
The turf on the crater, or the valley which was the channel
of the old lava stream, is soft as velvet, while some of the gnarled
trees seem to bear the impress of centuries of age. As probably
they do, for it is a matter of a thousand or two, possibly of a
million or two, of years when we begin to think back to those
volcanic periods. We cannot realise it walking over the grass
fields, or the rich light soil, or looking at the heavy crops. We
are disposed to say impossible, it could not have been. Scratch
the Russian and you find the Tartar, says the proverb. Scratch


this fair green hill and you find instantly indisputable evidence
of its infernal origin. They began to scratch a year ago in hopes
of finding stone or gravel which might serve as ballast for the
railway. And the search resulted in a full success, for under a
few feet of soil, the cinders, the ash-heap of the world’s central
fires were found. A great gullet has now been cut into the hill,
and cliff faces of the scoriae are formed in which all the results
of intense heat on innumerable materials may be plainly seen.
There are traces of many metals, but nothing very precious, for
this stuff was not from one of those laboratories wherein nature
manufactures her more valuable products. The walls generally
are black, or of a deep reddish brown, with streaks of white or
sulphurous tints, and spangles of all colours which flash when-
ever the sun strikes them. The bulk of the matter is loose, and
comes down easily enough when touched with a pick. They
work it down to the roof of a tunnel bored into the hills, into
which the trucks to be loaded are run. A tramway connects the
tunnel with the newly-constructed railway and thus with the
railway system of the colony. It is anticipated that tremendous
quantities of this scoriae will be taken out for railway ballast, for
which it is said to possess every necessary qualification. It is
heavier than any gravel. It is close, yet does not so bind as to
become compacted into a solid unworkable mass, And if left in
its natural condition, untrodden and whole, it encourages no grass
growth.
A ballast heap for the Victorian Railways, such is the practical
view of this slag mound of Vulcan’s fires. It has been laid on
the sleepers of many a mile in the Western District now, and will
probably be extensively used on all the railways to be presently
pushed out west and north. And yet they cannot use it all.
The ash and the cinders dribble down the shoots easily enough,
but occasionally a great boulder, a huge bomb is met, a spherical
mass cased in a matrix of dark red ironstone. Some of them
yield easily enough to the hammer, others could only be rent by
a dynamite charge. A kernel is found within something like the
Queensland opal, showing the same prismatic colours but lacking
the solidity. It consists, indeed, of innumerable tiny crystals,


which crumble easily under slight pressure. Strange to imagine
how these were formed, and fixed in the old volcanic days. One
lies there unbroken, rolled out of the way of the train, which may
weigh a couple of tons. Another is not bigger than a school-
boy’s ally toy. Were they some playthings of the gnome folk
down below, or wrought out of the gurgling and the surging, the
bubbling and the boiling of that huge Plutonic pot, whose lid
was blown away when the volcano first found vent ?—hurled high
in the air when the fire-fountain was spouting in earnest, to fall
with dull thud on the hot ashes, and bury themselves far beneath
the surface, as we find them to-day ?
We seem to go back centuries, aeons, as we stand in this gullet
of the old ash heap. There is nothing but evidence of the world’s
rack and ruin around, not a blade of grass, not a green leaf, not a
tree. The geologist might ponder and study here a while, school
boys might well be brought out for an impression, which would
have more abiding influence with them than the lessons of many
books. They would comprehend and realise some of the great
facts of geology, and in a manner which would be at once per-
manent and foundational.
It is worth a day’s stay in the comfortable old bluestone hotels
of such villages as Terang or Mortlake to have the opportunity of
making a thorough investigation of such a mountain as this ; and
after Terang comes the second seaport of Victoria —Warrnambool.
Of Warrnambool, there is much to be said, which is pleasant to
all patriotic Victorians, and interesting to all visitors. This city
by the sea is remarkably pleasant, and undoubtedly has a future
which may properly be spoken of as great. Warrnambool, it is
well known, aspires to be the city of the west, and we see no
reason whatever why it should not become the shipping port, the
market, and the health resort of that great country which stretches
away to the northward, practically, ad infinitum. Warrnambool
waited long for a railway to make connection with Melbourne,
and longer still for the breakwater, which at length being com-
pleted, makes her port absolutely safe for ships of very considerable
tonnage.


Round about Warrnambool lies some of the very richest country
in all Australia, or indeed, in the world. Tower Hill and Terang
and Panmure are noted names amongst agriculturalists throughout
Australia. The climate is perfect, the rainfall sufficient in all
season for farmers and dairymen. The Hopkins River comes
tumbling down from its mountain sources, away by Buangor and
Ararat, and well stocked with fish, and made accessible by
abundant boating accommodation, makes one of the most
delightful pleasure resorts Australia knows. The coastal scenery
is also exceedingly picturesque, and in places bold and grand.
And the town itself —well laid out by the original surveyors, and
developed by practical and patriotic and home-loving people—
contains all the accommodations and appointments any reasonable-
minded visitor may desire. Its churches are amongst the most
notable in any rural districts of Australia. Its sea-bathing accom-
modation is freely spoken of as the most perfect we have yet
provided in Victoria. The ocean beach, stretching away right
before the town, has attractions enough to satisfy any lovers of
the old sea’s frontage. Enterprising hotelkeepers and livery
stable keepers afford the visitor every opportunity to make trips
into the country round about. All combined attractions indeed
of fresh water and salt water, of hill and mountain scenes, of
rich-tilled land and wild wilderness, of sand and scrub, of gigantic
forest growths, tall cliff scenery, and shimmering sheeny beaches,
are more easibly accessible to the visitor or resident at Warrnam-
bool than, it may be, to those of any other locality on our coast.
Warrnambool is reasonably expected to become something of
a capital in the west; and the wisest of Warrnambool people,
perhaps, do not prize their railway connection with Melbourne so
much as that line which drives nearly due north to Penhurst and
Dunkeld, and thence by Ararat and Stawell and Murtoa to
Warracknabeal. From Warracknabeal it is always comtemplated,
as we know, to push a railway line right out to the Murray at
Mildura, and thus, say the Warrnambool people, the hot, dry
north and our cool, pleasant, breezy south, will be brought into
that connection which we desire, and then, say the Warrnambool
people, our true prosperity will begin. All those pastoral people


from the north will find down there the perfect summer resort
they require. They will be under no constraint, and indeed no
inducement, to mingle with the crowds of Melbourne. They will
find ocean air, ocean scenery, ocean coolness, health, and delight
with us ; and we, for our part, may frequently, in the winter, find
pleasure in such a place of greenness and delight as the irrigation
colony of Mildura may become. Moreover, they anticipate,
and reasonably enough, that the trade between the rich, moist
district of Warrnambool, and the wide pastoral areas of the north,
may and will always increase. Therefore, Warrnambool in all its
district urges, and we have not the slightest doubt will continue
to urge, with development of its own country, the constant advance
of that great northern land, and there is very little doubt that the
prosperity of Victoria, and the profits of her railways, will increase
as that line is pushed out. We do not know if it would be re-
garded as offensive to speak of Port Fairy or Belfast as a suburb
of Warrnambool, for Belfast is in the western bight of the same
bay as Warrnambool, and is a very pleasant and picturesque little
town, the port of a rich country which sends out cargoes of
potatoes and dairy produce and cereals generally, with much
regularity to our metropolitan markets. We may as well touch
Portland also, our farthest western port, in this connection,
though Portland properly lies up another railway line—that which
branches from the Adelaide overland at Ararat, and strikes down
by the Grampians at Dunkeld, and, passing through Hamilton
and Branxholme, running thence through rich country to the
picturesque town with which is associated some of the earliest
names and brightest records in Victorian history. The Hentys
turned their first furrows in the vicinity of Portland, and in days
when Melbourne was but a village, Portland had its settled popula-
tion, and its well-established settlers building up great estates, and
founding noble Australian homes. The Portland of to-day is as
pleasant and prosperous a township as any in the colony. Old-
fashioned, quaint, and picturesque, with substantial bluestone
dwelling-houses and hotels; a tolerable harbour; good, pure, and
rich country of all sorts round about; pasture lands valuable as
those about Colac or Camperdown ; forests scarcely touched yet


by any educated woodman’s axe; areable lands which still yield
great crops, though the first furrows were struck in them twenty
years ago; and rural rivers and waterpools and cascades in
abundance tumbling down from the near coastal hills to the sea.
And from Portland, following his way around, the tourist may
still travel on the western route. In that direction the railway
makes round for a point or two to the east, until it reaches
Branxholme. Thence runs a cockspur, ultimately, it may be, a
branch line, to connect with the Adelaide service. Casterton is
the present terminus of this line. Casterton, on the Glenelg
River, a very flourishing town, the centre of a fast-growing district.
But it is far below Casterton, on the Glenelg, where the tourist’s
or visitor’s interest will centre. This farthest western river we
possess, affords, for some miles upwards from its mouth, one of
the very best fishing, yachting, and boating waters our colony
knows. It is very little known as yet, lying off the general beaten
tracks; but year by year, at Christmas or Easter, increasing
numbers take the railways right west here, and go down to
Glenelg. Round about Casterton also, lies rich and beautiful
country, which all those who desire to understand anything of the
true resources of Victoria should visit.
North from the township, within a broad area, about which the
Glenelg winds, is a pastoral country whose beauty is equal to its
resources; and the traveller, if desirous of seeing a little more of
the colony, and understanding how rapidly its conditions and
climate change, has but to cross the Grampians, and straightway
finds himself in the hot north, upon the skirts of the mallee. But
Casterton is by no means alone here. To Coleraine, about 20
miles to the east, runs another branch of the Portland line, and
Coleraine is a township of no mean pretensions. Great stations
are seen about it, but also many scores of good substantial farms.
The little township is well laid out, and well built, and is, as may
easily be seen, destined to be abundantly and permanently pros-
perous. But the chief town on this line —a town which, indeed,
contests the supremacy of the west with Warrnambool-on-the-sea—
is Hamilton; and yet no traveller, journeying cityward, should
make on to Hamilton without a brief halt at the little hamlet of


Red Ruth on the Wannon River. As Wannon it now appears in
the maps of the district; and it is a matter for regret, perhaps, that
the pleasing old name of Red Ruth should have been departed
from. The one attractive feature of this village is the finest water-
fall, perhaps, in the colony. Not a fall of the picturesque and petite
type so common in the great timbered mountains, but a tremendous
leap of a great river down a sheer face of rock of 150 feet. The
stream comes rolling down the lightly-timbered dell, averaging in
breadth some 80 feet, and in depth a minimum of six, and so rolls
over the lip of this precipice, and with a thunderous roar, and
with all the foam and sparkle and glory of falling water, into the
gorge below. The voice of this waterfall is heard for miles
around. It displays its rainbow colours and majestic rain jewels
whenever the sun shines. In flood time its voice is terrific, in
all seasons it is grand ; and seldom during the summer months
are the very comfortable hotels of the little village destitute of
visitors.
Hamilton is the main centre of the great squatting district of
Victoria. Scores of the richest estates lie round about. Stylish
equipages and magnificent horses are always seen in its streets.
Its hotels are of the good old pastoral sort —ample, roomy, and
liberal. Its people, not distinguished, perhaps, by the energy and
the go of mining or farming districts, but still with quiet content-
ment, and the perfect hospitality about them, which gives a visitor
the very best idea of the best sort of folks, perhaps, Australia raises.
Hamilton is well worthy of a sojourn of a day or two. Its area
is large; its population sufficient to provide genial society for all
sorts and conditions of men; its little Club is frequented by
the best of the Western District folks ; and driving round about
in any direction, the visitor may be sure of good roads and very
pleasant surroundings. It is not, probably, that Hamilton will
ever witness a development similar to that of Warrnambool, but
it is tolerably certain to remain through many years a comfortable,
hospitable, and cultured place, inhabited and visited by an ever-
increasing number of most desirable people. At Hamilton strikes
in the connecting line between Warrnambool and Port Fairy and
this Ararat-Portland line. A half-dozen villages are passed on


that route, all progressing because all surrounded with manifold
resources; and another short connecting link between Penshurst
and Dunkeld, though not very profitable so far as the Railway
Department is concerned, accommodates a good many people,
who are gradually growing into competence, and affords the
traveller a glimpse of another patch of fast-developing Australian
country.
Dunkeld is a picturesque pastoral village about the head-waters
of the Wannon—a branch of the Hopkins River —and near to the
point where Mount Sturgeon, the extreme eastern spur of the
Grampians, rises from the plains, and marks the division between
two utterly distinct and separate classes of country. From Dun-
keld on to Ararat it is again almost solely pastoral lands, broad
estates well stocked with sheep, which send the best of merino
wool to the old world, and dotted with the homesteads of the
descendants of the lucky pioneers who established themselves on
the best of our Victorian soil.
Ararat we have seen already on the overland route.
Of the various cockspurs on the main western line, mention has
only so far been made of that which runs north from Terang to
Mortlake. Another important line strikes south from a station a
little to the west of Camperdown, and makes forth into the heart
of the great Otway forests. Cobden is its principal station, Tim-
bool its present terminus, and from Timbool to Curdie’s Inlet is
but three hours’ coaching, easily accomplished and arranged for.
There is somewhat wild country down south. A visitor can, if he
chooses, obtain a glimpse of the big Australian bush, the wild
forest land, and the uninhabited coast; yet settlement comes on
apace, and already very favourable arrangements are made for
tourists, both by coach proprietors and hotels. Another great
line strikes north from this great western —from Irrewarra to
Ondit and Beeac in the rocky country about Colac. Whither
this line will ultimately tend is a matter not to be rashly dealt
with. There is an occasional controversy about it, and its
ultimate tendency must be left to the exigencies of the future.
The one tourist line of all this country, however, which is best
known to Melbourne folks, and most popular during the summer


season, is that which runs out from Birregurra to the terminus
called Forest, and places passengers either at Dean’s Marsh or
Forest, within easy driving distance of the watering-place at Lome.
Lome is a merry, mirthful, beautiful, fashionable place all the
summer. Its sea-front is glorious, with every variety of scenery,
from beetling cliff to gently waving sand, and immediately in the
rear there are the magnificently-clothed feet of great spurs of the
mountains, rich with watercresses and fern-lined gullies, cascades
and cataracts and grassy molls and shadowy depths of forest
gleam, and all, in fact, which our Australian Nature yields to
make up holiday country of infinite and varied beauty. Lome
has grand, and well-kept, and well-furnished hotels and coffee
palaces. It is the easiest matter in the world for any visitor
desiring to proceed further, to make arrangements in Melbourne,
whereby he will save all trouble of route and accommodation.
Taken from his hotel here in Collins Street, and landed at the
hotel he may choose in Lome, without trouble or weariness, and
at a minimum expense. A little line from Mount Moriac to
Wensleydale, is a farmer’s line running through good and thickly-
populated country, and accommodating a great number of solidly-
established industrious people. It may be, indeed it has been
said, that many of these lines —connections and cockspurs—do
not so far pay ; but the intelligent and observant traveller, journey-
ing overland, will hardly doubt that each and all of them have
done much to develop tracts of the most valuable country; to
make permanent, industrious settlement possible ; and to develop
localities whose population and resources will favourably increase,
and by their trade will ultimately recoup all losses and costs
incurred by opening railways.
The North-Western System,
From St. Albans’ terminus of the suburban system on that
route, the main trunk line strikes away to the Murray, throwing
out many branches and making many connections by the way.
Diggers’ Rest is a little station not without its special interest,
for adjacent to this is that Plumpton which once was the con-
vincing ground of the royal sport of Victoria. Coursing took us


and held us fast for a long, long time, but it had its little day,
and ceased to be, and the Victorian Coursing Club is a very, very
small matter to-day in comparison with the V. R. C. And next
comes Sunbury, a township of many attractions, and not a little
special interest. The finest country seat in all Australia, that of
Sir William Clarke, is at Sunbury. On the Sunbury Hills also,
from earliest days, have been some of the finest of our vineyards.
And the little township there, with pleasant public resorts, and
soil-tilled gardens and orchards, is as pleasant a country home as
we who are in the city could desire. Indeed, a very great number
of city folks have established themselves at Sunbury and at
Riddell’s Creek, further on, and at Gisborne, while to the heights
of Macedon they go, as we know, chiefly for the mountain air
and recreation. We must speak of Macedon, however, more at
length. From Lancefield Junction, a station between Riddell’s
Creek and Sunbury, a branch line runs out to Romsey and
Lancefield proper, junctioning with another branch from the
north-eastern line at Kilmore, and traversing on this route, some
of the richest and best agricultural land, divided into the best
kept farms we know in Victoria. They lie, these farms, generally
on the slopes of Macedon. They are all of the rich, red volcanic
soil, and generally have been won from the forest which in old
days came right down here to the lowlands. Lancefield and
Romsey, however, though pleasant and instructive enough, and
profitable to men of business intent, do not come into what is
called tourist country. That is only reached at Macedon, that
mighty rampart of rock which we see from the sea. Macedon
has long been very dear to Melbourne people, and very early had
a good road to its skirts because thereby lay the route to Forest
Creek and old Bendigo, and indeed, ere the colony was many
years old, the best and costliest railway line ever put down in
Australasia ran along there. Thither in very early days went
the Governors for the pleasant change of air obtainable on
the heights. There also did many prosperous business men
establish their country homes, and there now are some of the
most picturesque old mansions and loveliest gardens Australia
knows. There the Rhododendron flourishes marvellously, with


rich clusters of bloom and dark green foliage, fringing shady
avenues, leading up to quaint old verandahed houses, all covered
with creepers in full foliage or gorgeous bloom. Good hotels are
also at Macedon, but the best of all, may be, is that Braemar
House, built on the northern ridge, and looking out to the broad
northern country. Many of the most successful doctors in
Melbourne had found a difficulty in securing suitable country or
mountain resorts for convalescent patients. Dr. Turner, of
Collins Street, was the first to take practical steps in the matter,
and encourage the building and establishing of this perfect
residence, Braemar, It is quite away from all ocean influences,
up in the high, clear, dry air, above the region of flies and
mosquitoes, looking across to the rich and pleasant agricultural
country of Kyneton, with a glimpse to eastward of the high and
fertile mountains which trend away from Daylesford by Creswick and
the Learmonth, country we have already traversed, to the lowlands of
the west. From Carlsruhe, beyond the Macedon and the Woodend
stations, a line strikes out to Daylesford, and from Daylesford winds
around by Wombat, Newlyn, Kingston and Avondale, to junction on
to the Ballarat-Donald line at Creswick. And this is the line along
which no man will regret spending an hour or two, or a day or
two, or even a week or two. Daylesford is the centre of attraction
on this line, and from Daylesford all the beauties of the district are
most easily accessible. Daylesford is a village (if its residents will
pardon us using that old familiar name), unique in its beauty, and
the perfection of its picturesque arrangements in all the colony.
Central in the village of Daylesford rises Mount Wombat, one of
those picturesque mounds cast up of old by volcanic force, but
clothed through countless ages with a rich carpet of turf, and
pleasant, shady honey suckle, wattle, lightvvood, and all Australian
forest trees. The people of Daylesford saw, in the very early days,
what advantages this mound offered them, and, working slowly
but perseveringly, they have made of it a park and gardens,
exceedingly beautiful, and ample in the scope it affords for
all accommodation of residents, and any multitude of visitors the
greatest holiday of the year may send out. Its summit is more
than 2000 feet above the sea level, and there, at the dawn of a

TERMS FROM SOS. PER WEEK.


summer’s morning, or the close of a summer’s day, a glorious
prospect is obtained of a country whose beauties are infinitely
varied. Very grand forests lie immediately around Daylesford.
Some glorious fern trees gullies and many a laughing and
dancing waterfall, pleasantly to be watched from the abundant
shade of wattle and lightwood. And Creswick, at the other end
of this branch or connecting line, is also a little town of many
charms and beauties peculiarly its own. As with many of our
mining townships, testimony to the fine feelings of pioneers and
present residents, its hospital is its chief feature. Yet many well-
to-do residents of the district have established themselves good
homes in or near the town, and ample accommodation is provided
for all visitors at two or three well-kept hotels. Dealing with this
system of lines, however, we pass by multitudinous branches and
spurs, and cannot linger long even in this beautiful and hospitable
Daylesford country. The Hepburn Mineral Springs, however, a mile
from the township, should not be missed. Their waters are pro-
nounced by competent medical authority to be equal to any of those
of the renowned springs of Europe, and some day there should be a
spa at Hepburn renowned as that of Tunbridge Wells, or Bath, or
any of the show and society places in North Italy and Germany.
Kyneton, the next place on the main line, should not be hurried
over or passed through without some notice. Hereabout is some of
the best working agricultural land in the colony, and many of the
earliest farmers, men who were not lured away by prospects of
larger holdings in a hot, dry country, but who worked their land
scientifically and faithfully, and so tried to live and to maintain
good homes, and church, and school, and a pleasant township,
and to bring up their children and families in the good old yeoman
style. From Redesdale Junction, beyond Kyneton, runs out a
15-mile cockspur to Redesdale town, all through pleasant country,
where mining and pastoral and agricultural industries mingle,
each helping the other. Then again, through a country of varied
prospect and busy life generally, the railway runs on to Castle-
maine, centre, in the old days, of much wild and busy and
prosperous life. The Malmsbury basin, head of the Coliban
water scheme, is passed on this route. The waters of this scheme


traverse all the mining country of Castlemaine and its environs,
and enable the great mining work to be successfully prosecuted.
Chewton may almost be spoken of as a suburb or continuation of
Castlemaine. All the life thereabout is digging still, except where
some enterprising and always successful gardeners, viticulturists,
or orchardists have established themselves on the deserted
diggings, and taking advantage of the deep tilth, they are clothing
the land with beauty, and making for themselves sources of
permanent and ever-increasing income. Castlemaine itself is a
very pleasant mining township, a little more than a village, and a
little less than a town. With pleasant valleys running away to the
broad flats on the great rivers, with green hills lightly forested
round about, and multitudinous signs of gigantic labour, in the
days when the men of the fifties were here, by thousands and by
tens of thousands, every gully working, and disembowelling
every hill. There is not much of bustling life about
Castlemaine now. A few mines still prosper, and a good
many hundreds of miners find permanent employment. The
great dairying industry prospers well on the better lands a few
miles out of the town, and many an almost unknown hamlet in
the mountain gullies around, makes of the old mining centre a
market town and a gathering place, so that in the holidays, or
Saturday afternoon (which is a holiday throughout Australasia), a
good deal of quaint and original life may be seen in the old
mining centre, and a day or two may well be passed there in good
quarters and amongst pleasant surroundings. Then Castlemaine
lies almost centrally on a great cross country line—
that indeed, which crosses the greatest breadth of the colony,
and joins Portland and Echuca. From Castlemaine you can
reach any railway station, north, south, east, or west, without in
any way going back on your tracks, or returning to the main
starting point of Melbourne. And Maldon is but a 10 miles
journey from Castlemaine, reached by another cockspur.
Maldon will long continue as an important mining centre.
Bendigo, five-and-twenty miles further along, is the centre of all
this country, the seat of the broadest, keenest, best controlled
mining enterprise Australia ever saw, and the great winter city


of the colony. Ballarat alone compares with Bendigo as an
Australian inland city, and there is no need to vex or pique either
with unwelcome comparisons, for each has its own particular
characteristics and charms. Their life periods are almost coeval.
They are of the Titanic period in Australia, when ? our
birth throes shook the world, and the enterprise of all nations
gathered to our making.
We speak of Bendigo as a winter city, as a city that is where winter
is delightful, and may always be enjoyed, where bleak Junes and
dreary Julys of the coast may be passed in clear sunshine and crisp,
cool air, where mornings and evenings are bracing, days perfect,
and nights chilled only to the most desirable sleeping temperature.
More and more of the Melbourne people go up to Bendigo with
every winter season. And indeed it is no marvel, for Bendigo, with
all the advantages of climate, contains also the accommodations,
refinements and luxuries of city life. It has its public parks and
gardens, with cricket grounds, lawn tennis and bowling greens,
all made in the most sterile of soil and with a vast expenditure
of money and labour. Its fern tree gullies, kept fresh, almost
in the city’s centre, by constant application of water, its streets
lined with deciduous trees, whose leafless boughs in the winter
months let all the sunshine through, while in summer forming an
impenetrable screen. It has public halls and picture galleries
and cathedrals, colleges and schools, good open air music from
well-trained military bands, a pleasant little theatre, and beyond
the busy streets and roaring, clanging batteries about the mines,
hundreds of homes luxuriously appointed and most beautifully
surrounded with foliage and flowers. A brief description of one
of these may be admitted here. It is that of Mr. Lansell, a
pioneer of the first years, who has lived all his life in the inland
city, resisting the seductions of the metropolis, sharing in and
mightily assisting its development, and showing to all who have
eyes to see what enterprise and genius can do, not only in fortune
building, but in house making.
Close to the batteries and the mines (his batteries and his
mines) Mr. Lansell has established his home, and despite the
barren rock-face which opposed him has made a garden where


all manner of flowers, fruits and vegetables grow, a lake where
good exercise may be had in a fair-sized boat, a grotto garden
where, amidst the rocks, ferns and flags, and reeds and bamboos
run up as in a tropical jungle, ponds where goldfish move in
thousands, and a half-dozen fountains making music and coolness
all the year round. There are vines on the walls which yield
tons of grapes in the season, oranges and lemons, bringing their
fruit to perfection ; pines fifty feet high, and a cedar with a trunk
nine feet in girth ; camellias also, almost out of the category of
shrubs, strewing down their blossoms of all tints, from crimson to
white, as if they were things of nothing worth. The Coliban
water runs through and through the garden now, and has, indeed,
been the chief factor in all the work of fertilisation. A very little
soil on that foundation of hardest rock will work wonders if only
the water supply is abundant and regular. About his wonderful
garden and luxurious home here, Mr. Lansell passes most of his
time, having returned from a six years’ sojourn in the old world
to the business which occupied most of his manhood, which
enriched, and still interests him more than anything else in the
broader fields of the world. It would be well if a larger number
of wealthy Australians arrived at a similar conclusion when met
with the problem of what to do, the necessary work of life being
ended.
But it is in the country around Sandhurst that the permanent
and abiding charm to the visitor will be found. Sandhurst folk
go out to the Crusoe to picnic in the summer time or drive further
on towards the Big Hill. And we find with pleasure now that
the digging ground is passed, and one of those new avenues
entered which are made by the saplings springing about the butts
of the old felled trees. Heavy gum foliage on either side of the
road, through which occasional clearings are seen, with pleasant
homes of some of the Sandhurst people, who have a love for fresh
air and a superior altitude. Easy driving there ; the road is good,
the atmosphere bracing, and all behind the landscape begins to
open. But when we are near the saddle crossed by the road a
halt is made, for to the left is the road to the hill’s summit. An
easy walk of not more than a mile and a half, in which there is


nothing to climb but an occasional fence, brings us to the very
topmost point. And the track, though easy, is not monotonous.
There are strange weather-worn rocks telling their tales on the
hillsides. There are beautiful mountain ferns, frequent and fresh,
and fair. There are rare cherry trees, the dainty strangers in the
eucalypti forest, and oaks budding brown after their fashion. It
is well to recognise all these as we pass along on the upward
journey, and not to turn about for a broad view till the topmost
height is reached. A fairly open grassy space will be found here,
whereon a rug or coat may be spread, sitting on which, you may
look out on every side and see more, perhaps, at a single glance
than you have ever been privileged to have seen before.
Look for the city first, and your eye is caught instantly by the
line of shafts which stretch away in parallel lines. You note them
first, and next the more than usually orderly trees catch the eye,
and through them the roofs and the towers are seen, and gradually
the irregular outline of the “ Forest City ” becomes clear in shape.
Something like a great skate or ray, with long tail extending down
the valley almost to the mountain’s foot. 700 feet below on the
left is the silver shield of the Crusoe Reservoir. A few miles
further are the peculiar smokes of the pyrites works, deadly white
vapours, each one shedding poisonous influences wherever it
touches, yet making striking contrast with the dark foliage
beneath. Farther on, the level but by no means bare surface of
the plains. They seem, indeed, all timbered. You can detect
but an occasional clearing, denoting a farmer’s green crop or
fallow or vineyard. Far away round stretch the plains, till a little
on the right Mount Ida and the rugged Heathcote country in the
line which runs down to Kilmore, breaks the flat surface, and
passing it by the eye ranges over rolling wooded downs, till two
hills far away are seen whose outlines seem familiar. They are
not quite as we have seen them before. We may say that we
have looked on their faces before, and now do but see their backs.
And yet they are unmistakably Warrenheip and Buninyong, whose
faces look down on Ballarat, whose backs are now visible to us as
we look down on Bendigo. But let us look a little further. Even
a little nearer, though more to the right as we turn around, now


facing the south and west, some of the highest of those rounded
hills by Creswick and Smeaton are seen, and then Mount Alexander
rises rugged and almost close, and Tarrangower, scarce distant
enough to take a mantle of blue, but, far away in the cobalt of
extreme distance, the Pyrenees.
It is a far cry, indeed, to the limits of vision here on any side,
but it is necessary to sit down and think in order to realise the
true significance of what is seen; and, indeed, before beginning
to think of the broader aspects and possibilities, it is not un-
profitable to look a little closely at the character, the form, the
colour of what lies immediately around. There is a very pleasant
southerly glimpse down the valley to Ravenswood. The train
comes thundering out of the tunnel which runs through the earth
some hundreds of feet beneath us, and carries its flying banner of
steam and smoke along by green fields and leafless orchards, and
red brick houses closed in with black clumps of gums. We do
not see the lordly mansion which a colonist of the last generation
raised there; but there is a very pleasant and well-occupied
Australian valley, picturesque in itself, and brightened and
diversified by its human occupation. It would make a fair
enough picture, that Ravenswood valley ; but there is more for
the painter to learn in the almost primeval forest, characteristically
Australian, though by no means lofty or grand, which shows on
the steep north-eastern slopes of the mountain, where the timber-
getter’s cart has never been, and the most eager selector has not
cared to set his pegs. A stunted box forest covers most of the
mountain side, though in the bed of the valley there is short,
bright-green grass ; and the colour of the foliage is Australian,
peculiarly beautiful in its tints, perhaps inimitable —certainly never
successfully copied. It consists of two varieties—the grey box,
and what is called amongst bushmen the apple-tree. The foliage
of this one is of the colour of the brown kelp when it heaves to
and fro beneath three feet of blue sea-water; the other, as of the
honeysuckle which overhangs the cliff, or as the myall kissing the
topmost sprays of the tall grass on the Riverina plains—the two


extremes indeed, of green which can be produced by blending
with silver and of brown. Further away, they meet in the
common blue or grey of the extreme distance.
And what now is that extreme distance, that meeting of earth
and sky to northward around a third of the visible horizon ? It
is “the plains,” as locally and vaguely put —the plains which slope
down to the Murray, the plains which begin again beyond the
Murray, and roll away north and north-east and north-west, and
whither? I have said before that this is a notable view, and
presents us with a notable outlook. It is indeed an outpost on
the southern rampart of Australia. It is the last mountain height
on our broad highway to the heart and the furthest limits of the
continent. Look right north as you stand, and if your visual
powers could be sufficiently extended, you should see the inmost
heart and the most northern cape of the continent. Somewhere
away in that grey blend of earth and sky is the channel of the
Murray, the father of Australian waters. Look right across the
Murray there and you should see the first great plains—the Old
Man Plain, stretching to Hay, on the Murrumbidgee; the One
Tree Plain, to Booligal, on the Lachlan ; and beyond, the scrub
and wastes which lead up to the Darling. No mountains
intervene, our highroad there is broad and clear, and un-
impeded. We should see the Darling now, did our eyesight
range as far, a fair stream, rolling through fertile plains, soon to
be swelled, and filled, and overflowed by the turbulent rush of
waters which comes down from all the western heights of New
England, and of the coastal ranges of South Queensland, to
become a mighty fertiliser and a great avenue of commerce
through half the summer months. We should look beyond the
Darling to the Queensland country; we should see away to the
westward the ever-increasing smoke of the furnaces on the
Barrier; and further north, and still to the west, we might see
miners picking out ore and packing it on camels for test and assay
in our own Bendigo or Ballarat works. Eastward again we might
catch a glimpse of that new born Queensland centre of Croydon,


and at length should see the foam of the tropic ocean breaking
against our northern coasts beyond which lies our neighbour
continent.
Verily it is a good place for a young Australian to stand. I
know none better in all the continent, but I think every wise man
would have him rather reflect than boast or glory the while. He
looks across heritage, endowment, not accomplishment. As
the silver speck of the Crusoe Reservoir is to the broad shield of
the Pacific, so is the result of human effort here to the sphere of
possible development, which so far is practically untouched.
Here he may stand, and in imagination look across the continent,
and, leaving the great cities on the narrow fringe of the coast
behind, what sees he ? What, still, but the old wilderness,
whereon, separated by tremendous intervals, are set firmly the
impressions of the worthy white man’s foot ? Ido not regard the
ordinary squatting occupation as worthy work of development.
Down there in Sandhurst is the good imprint in mines, factories,
chemical works, and progress of agriculture and viticulture ; away
yonder at Mildura is another. I would strike out to the water
bores on Dunlop Station, Darling River, for another; thence to
the prospecting works of Alice Springs, on the overland telegraph
line, and eastward once more to Queensland Croydon, or right
north to the sugar and cotton country, whose development is
only retarded by ignorance and jealousy. With more than seven-
league boots the white man has stridden across the continent,
just taking possession, little more.
He has to begin to fill in now, and what a marvellous great
work is that. It may very well be considered and tolerably well
comprehended from the summit of this Big Hill. Begin from
the foot of the mountains and look out across the wilderness of
the gums. What has been done there so far? Nothing but
feeble experiment, which has ever resulted in promise of success.
Shut your eyes to the present and open them to the future, and
you may easily imagine what a future day will see there. Not the
slightest doubt but all that first crop of natural growth of little
worth spread over the land as a mask to conceal its real wealth
will by-and-bye be cleared away, and in many a hollow a little


lake will be formed, beside which a hamlet will rise, whether with
a church spire, or athenaeum dome, you must judge according to
your habit; that vineyards and oliveyards, and plantations for
profit in all sorts will mingle with green fields and golden harvest
plots to make such a picture as may be seen from some of the
western slopes of the European Alps. It may be urged that there
are thousands of acres there absolutely sterile. The answer is
that some of the very best wine in Australia has been made from
ground apparently as sterile as that. It is the gross, and not the
choice produce of the world which grows on the fat furrows.
Dream your dream of the future, and never heed the objectors
and the pessimists. They will make more mistakes than you, and
never made or aided since the world began, any progress.
Picture your villages and your fields, your happy population
revelling in this climate which is unequalled in the world,
drinking in July sunshine, and ripening, like their own fruits, in
December heats, by no means wealthy, yet for ever rescued from
the poverty, the pain, the everlasting stress of ill-requited labour
to which they were born in the old world.
Nor ever deem that accomplishment is ended with the
redemption of the soil only. Sending contemplative rather than
delighted eye across the lower hills which half conceal the town,
the peculiar smoke of the pyrites works again challenges attention,
and it may be that in those works there is hope of a larger
development than has yet been dreamed of. They are taking the
ores now which a very few years since were deemed utterly refractory,
and roasting, grinding and treating them by various chemical
processes are forcing out the gold, which makes countless millions
of tons of rock valuable. Three of these pyrites furnaces may be
noticed in full blast just now, and there is a prospect that they
will increase. Why not ? Who can gauge the quantity of gold-
bearing rock in Australia ? We only know that it has been found
to exist wherever it has been sought. We know also that from
several mines in these colonies, so-called intractable ores are now
regularly shipped to England or to Germany for treatment. Is there
any good reason why the railway lines should not bring them into
Bendigo, why the process of teaching begun in the School of


Mines there should not be continued through practical and
profitable application of knowledge ? A time must come when
all the tall shafts along the existing lines of reef will be levelled,
when the gold-bearing lodes of quartz will be exhausted. It may
be long deferred. Such discoveries may be made before
impassable depths are reached as to cause booms and bursts
vast as any already noted in Bendigo’s history. Still a period
may be set, even to possibility, in that way. And is it not possible
to anticipate that time, to have, by its arrival, established permanent
mining industries, or industries dependent not on the quartz yield
of one district, but the gold stone of the continent ? It may, I
believe, be honestly said that the genius of Australia for the
scientific and commercial treatment of refractory ores exists chiefly
in Bendigo. The mechanical and chemical faculties here have
been educated by necessity, and there is very little in the way of
metallurgical process so far as gold is concerned which cannot be
accomplished here. Fame of this sort should in itself be the
foundation of fortune, if it be but maintained by bold and
persevering development. Much would it add to the prosperity
of the State, though little, perhaps, to beauty of the scene, if the
shafts of permanent works of this sort should become thick on the
hills about the city as are now the idle chimneys of the mines.
And, are not time and place fitting here for the beginning of the
wine-making on scientific basis ? Watch, as you may, from the
Big Hill the flying feathers of steam, which denote the tracks of
the trains by different routes. Here comes the express from
Melbourne along the vine-growing valleys out to the vine-growing
plains. There away goes the branch line to Inglewood, to Boort,
to Donald, to all the mallee country. Nearer still to the main
line is the Kerang track, with its tramway junctioning on the
Murray. Each one of these lines traverses the great grape and
fruit country of Australia, and Bendigo is their natural focussing
point. Why should not Bendigo also be the market for all their
products, and the scene of the manufacture of the great Australian
wines ? If Bendigo people really desire not only to raise their
city, but to increase its prosperity and power, they should consider
at once the idea of a great wine factory—a factory which should


acquire a name familiar in the world as the Chateaux brands of
France. We ought to do something better, or at least more
original, than adopt the old French style. Adelaide has led the way
here with her Auldana cup, but that is not so striking a designation
as might be desired. Bendigo should do better than that. But
it will be time enough to name the wine when it is made. The
point to be enforced in the present is the necessity of making the
wine. Within five years from the present time there is no doubt
whatever that many thousands of acres of vines will be in bearing
adjacent to all those lines leading on to Bendigo, and the quantity
would be vastly increased if growers could reckon on a sale of
their produce without converting it into wine. In fixing a price
and finding a market for this produce lies the work and the
opportunity of a great Bendigo company. Dotted about near
to the lines of the old paying leads, a man familiar with the
district will point out to you shaft after shaft, towering over huge
heaps of unprofitable rock. Twenty thousand, he will say, was
sunk there, and thirty there, and forty yonder ; and what profit is
there from them all ? None ; some are still working, others are
abandoned ; but hundreds of thousands of pounds have gone
down these holes, from which no single ounce of gold was ever
taken. If only a little of that ineffectual powder could be put
into the making of wine vaults, there would be no fear of barren
reckonings or of dolorous meeting when once the fruit began to
come in.
The establishment of a great factory on this fruit-buying basis
is the one link wanted to ensure the speedy establishment of our
wine industry. We have seen many and many a vat of good
wine spoiled in Victoria through lack of proper cellarage and care,
and many a cask of bad wine sent out to damn the fame of the
country because growers were compelled by circumstances to be
also manufacturers. Many of the great vintners are buying now
from all their neighbours, but still there is room and opportunity
left for the establishment of a factory which would not concern
itself with growing, but with buying and making. And there are
data enough available to make calculations. The value per ton
of grapes for the press has been very accurately ascertained ; the


quantity which can be grown to the acre may also be estimated
easily as the average yield of the wheat crop. Men of experience
could, indeed, set down and estimate the sure returns which
grower and producer might expect, and beyond which lie possi-
bilities of profit and gain, to understand which we must look to
the old cities and the great houses of the land of the Troubadours
of Provence in the past and the present. This at least is sure ;
there is never a mine in Bendigo, or Australia, or the world,
which has yielded as much hard cash as any one of a half-dozen
of the great wine-making houses of France.
Build us up that factory, then, some of you Bendigo men of
marvellous enterprise, and make so a little wise provision for the
coming time. And we may prophesy for you a certain and a
beautiful house of refuge. There is much glory for Australia in
that coming time, though it may be doubtful if we shall be able
to range at large on this Big Hill then. When the fragrance as
of mignonette is blown up from miles on miles of blossoming
vines below, when every train is bearing away its thousands of
cases of the great Australian brand, we shall see chateaux here on
each one of these little points of vantage. This last inland
mountain will not for many years be left as a dwelling-place for
the covey and the fox. The perfect atmosphere, its marvellous
prospect, will be regarded as priceless possessions, and the happy
proprietor of many a good house here will some future day bid us
come up and look at Australia.
After all, however, it is probable that the visitor to Bendigo will
always look first to the great, all pervading industry of the gold
mining. Arriving by way of Kangaroo Flat and Golden Square,
he will hear the incessant thud and clang of the thousands of
stamper heads always at work, and will look back to the days
when tens of thousands of wild, free, enterprising alluvial miners
were gathering up the easily won maiden riches of the land.
Armed every man, every man ready to defend his own at need,
yet kept in a very easy yet adequate control, because the man in
charge in those days understood men, and could govern without
tyrannising over them. Mr. J. A. Panton, senior P.M. of Melbourne
now, was warden of Bendigo in the fifties, and is still remembered


by the old pioneers with an affectionate regard. But it is all
scientific mining now. The most perfect machinery brings up the
stuff from the very bowels of the earth, the most scientific
appliances treat the most refractory ores, and only the honey-
combed hills speak to the visitor of the days which were. Yet
mining is the mainstay of the present, and will doubtless for ever
be held in honour in Bendigo. Mining and the old mining men
built that hospital, perfect in its accommodation and appliances
as any in the colony. Mining and mining men planned and
planted the streets, made the gardens, and in fact established the
city in the place of the wilderness. Mining, from its earliest
Australian beginning to its latest developments, may be studied
and understood in and about this city of Bendigo. And residing
in any of the many comfortable hotels—the City, Family, and the
Shamrock, chief perhaps amongst them —and strolling along the
busy Pall Mall, or walking amongst the fern groves, the garden
portions, or the flower starred lawns, no right-minded visitor will
deny that the old miners, wild and reckless as they frequently
were, planned for the future in a broad way, and on truly liberal
lines.
And whither should we travel from Bendigo? The junction line
—running by way of Heathcote to Kilmore —has already been
glanced at in connection with the north-eastern system. Perhaps
it is better to consider that as the main trunk still, which goes
right north to Echuca, connects by tram, so-called, but really an
extension of the Victorian railway with Deniliquin, and should go
on still farther to Hay and to Booligal, and across Lachlan and
Darling country, giving hundreds of people access to their proper
and natural port, and doubling or trebling the value of millions of
pastoral acres. Intercolonial jealousy, however, has hitherto
barred that extension, and we must keep within the limits of
our own colony. So, onward by the Huntly Valley, which
terminates at Huntly, and may be said to begin about the base of
the Big Hill, to come along by Kangaroo Flat to the city, and to
wind away thence due north. It is of the same character through-
out, worked deep or shallow everywhere, miles broad in places,
narrow as the bed of a mountain gorge in others ; here filled


30 feet deep with sludge, there showing the bared face of the
rock, but containing many thousands, well-informed local men
say thirty thousand, acres at the least, of land similar to that
which has been brought under cultivation as orchard ground and
vineyards.
And then a little way off the valley at Epsom, a pottery of
some note —Epsom Pottery—a very considerable and prosperous
establishment, employing nearly a hundred hands, and turning
out potteryware of every sort and shape and size. Here the
potter’s wheel spins to the treadle as in the days of Scripture ;
here the more powerful machinery kneads and moulds the clay,
and delivers it to the machines, whence great drain-pipes, flower-
pots, and all the heavier and simpler forms of the ware are turned
out and completed with scarcely the touch of a human hand. A
half-dozen kilns are for ever heating or cooling, and many a ton
of finished stuff must go out to the various parts of the continent.
Some of the finer work here is really artistic and nice. There are
finished jugs and teapots which would almost pass for Wedgwood,
and painted plaques which would not discredit a gentlewoman’s
drawing-room. The managers and proprietors have their little
troubles, of course, but they have pluck and strength, and last,
but not least, reasonable considerateness about them to ultimately
“ win through ” and establish their fame as successful pioneers of
a great Australian industry.
Goornong then, where grow many acres of vines, and Elmore,
with vines and farms and mines ; and Rochester, a centre of a
great wheat-growing country, which runs down the Campaspe
River and stretches east to the valley of the Goulburn, and west
to the valley of the Loddon, and north to the great valley of
Australia, down which flows the father of Australian waters—the
majestic Murray. At Echuca this main trunk, so far as Victoria
is concerned, makes halt \ and Echuca and Moama face each other
on the Murray here as do Albury and Wodonga, at the junction of
the two systems on the Sydney overland line. But here Victoria
has all the best of the comparison. Echuca is a very considerable
and busy township ; Moama is a very dull and non-progressive
village. Hundreds of farmers make Echuca their market town.


The great red-gum saw-milling industry had its headquarters here.
In olden days, before the railway had passed Bendigo, squatters
from all the north made Echuca their halting-place on the Mel-
bourne journey; and King Cobb kept splendid stables, and great
hotels were run on lines similar to those of ante-railway days in
the English counties. Sober business now has taken the place of
that ancient splendour. The new town is round about the railway
station, and the grand old hotel by the bridge had fallen almost
into disuetude, until the happy idea occurred to some practical-
minded people to make of it a consumptive hospital. For the
climate of Echuca is of the best of the world for all people un-
happily afflicted with weakly or diseased respiratory organs. The
hospital or asylum may, through years, grow into a very great
institution, and be of much service to sufferers of the metropolis,
or patients sent out from other lands where sunshine is less frequent
than cold, grey weather and chilling rain.
Echuca is Victoria’s outpost here, and in every sense a creditable
frontier city. Its people have from early days realised their evident
destiny, and planned and builded for a city to be. Even now it
has all the conveniences of modern life —gas and water supply—
and more of an Australian public garden, perhaps, than any other
town in the colony. For there the growth of native trees has
been encouraged, and pine and oak and myall and wattle have
marvellously increased the beauty of an old-time sand ridge. The
streets of Echuca were also planted with well-chosen and beautiful
shade trees a good many years ago, and now, through nine months
at least of the year, are pleasant, fragrant, shadowy avenues. In
the way of accommodation for travellers hotelkeepers provide well.
All sorts and conditions of purses can be accommodated, and at
the Palace and Commercial, entertainment of a very superior class
will always be found.
Connected with this north-western system there are also what
may be termed three other main lines—one from Bendigo to Swan
Hill, another from the same city to Wycheproof, and another from
Maryborough to Donald ; for the country which lies between
Maryborough and Ballarat may be more properly included in
what we have termed the Ballarat country. These lines follow


generally the valleys of the northern flowing rivers, and halt each
one just within the mallee country, to be pushed on through
coming years as mile after mile the mallee is mastered ; and
instead of the impenetrable and worthless scrub, a splendid agri-
cultural, horticultural, and wine-producing country stretches right
away from a line which might be struck from Serviceton, on the
Adelaide border, to Gunbower, on the Murray River.
From Bendigo to Swan Hill is a long line. With the Murray
and that section of the main trunk which joins the mining city
with Echuca, it forms an irregular triangle, and adding rail to
water carriage, renders all that tract uncommonly well served with
means of transit. Unless interested in the various phases of
Australian agricultural development, the visitor is not much
tempted to linger at any of its villages or roadside stations. He
runs north through partly well worn out mining country to well-
developed farming land as far as Kerang, thence on through
mallee and open plains to the pleasantly named stations about
the little lakes which are practically vents of the great sub-
terranean river making its way to the Murray or the sea. Reedy
Lake and Lake Charm, Mystic Lake and Lake Boga, and then
Swan Hill, our most westerly Murray port, but known now as
the starting point of the water journey to Mildura, but in years
to come, if we mistake not, to become a great frontier town of the
colony. At Swan Hill we shall endeavour to give an idea of
what our great river is when rolling down in the fulness of his
strength, and none better is available, perhaps, than the following,
penned in a season of flood and from the steamer’s deck on the
seaward journey ;
“ The father of Australian waters appeared to us again with
the sunrise, and most of the party were up early. Beautifully
still, fairly clear, a hundred yards broad, and making a bend at
least three times in every mile. What do we sec on the banks ?
Stunted redgums, a sparse sap-green scrub growth, frequent sand
patches, and a good deal of dead timber, fallen or still standing
—a dreary prospect enough. What shall we see around the next
bight? Just the same as we see now 7 . Just the same as we saw
around the last. It will be all the same—always the same—


throughout the journey, except where the river channel has cut
through a sand ridge or a sandstone band. There you may see
cliff faces white or whitey brown, or streaked and patched with
red, a hundred feet high in places, and picturesque in form as
varied in colour.
“ Evening came down on us without a rustle in the leaves of
the gums by the shore, or a ripple on the steely surface of the
water far ahead. And coolness came with the shadows, and a
delightful freshness with the later hours. There is glorious
compensation in the evening and night of a hot day on the river.
The moon comes out, revealing all the beauty of form which is
seldom lacking in Australian foliage, and concealing all the
ghastly barrenness of the shores. There is no sound save the
mellow churn of the paddles and the wash of the waters, and not
the slightest sensation of chilliness in the air. Everything is
restful, and as hour after hour passes, you have no desire to go
to bed or to talk, or to be bothered by anybody about anything
whatever. It is one of those gliding passages in life of which we
have all too few.
“We are afloat still, and in the darkness. An electric light
looks out from the bows of the boat, throwing a broad blue glare
a cable’s length ahead. We can see the black fringe of gum on
either hand, and the broad level breast of the flood, shining like
steel where smitten by the light, black and lustreless in the
shadows. We can feel the quick pulsations and the constant
vibrations of the boat, and have somewhat false evidence of pace
in the water rushing past the bows. The rate of the current must
be subtracted from the apparent pace of the boat. Still we are
going along, and comfortably. A delightfully cool breeze comes
rushing off the water to meet us. The cabin doors are all open,
there is no sign of a mosquito. We can rest delightfully now, we
shall sleep anon, and to-morrow we ought to be near the journey's
end —some time to-morrow night. Weird look the sable banks
of timber, strangely come the notes of the night birds, the whistle
of the wild ducks’ wings, the wail of the curlew, the ‘ Pretty little


creature!’ of the shepherd’s companion. Everything is mysterious,
solitary, shadowy, vast, and the mighty river gliding along beneath
the stars seem really one of the great things of the world.'’
To Wycheproof goes the second of these three lines by way of
Eaglehawk, that greatest suburb of Bendigo, which of itself
forms a very considerable township, and supports a busy and
thriving population of near 5000 souls ; and thence to the valley
of the Loddon, where mining and agriculture were carried on
many years ago, or rather a fair share of the returns of the
mines went into the fields, and farmers prospered well when the
mines were worked out. Marong comes first here as a mining
village chiefly, and Leichardt then, and Derby and Bridgewater,
as fair a specimen of good agricultural villages as the colony
knows. Right down the Loddon from Bridgewater, parallel with
the main direction of the line which joins Inglewood with Dunolly,
are nests of good farms about these villages, and north again on
the river they go right out to far Kerang, all long since settled,
and now and always to be worked to abundant profit.
Inglewood, but a short run beyond Bridgewater, is one of the
old towns, and until the advance of railways marked an outpost
of the mining industry on the southernmost skirts of the Mallee
and the unalienated pasture lands. But now right onward by
Wedderburn and Korong go the farms, and out by the Cockspur
to Boort, old Lake Boort, and away again by Wychetella and
Charlton to Wycheproof, at present the terminus. All these
names known—if known at all—as indicating sheep stations in
anti-railway days, now indicate places of some importance.
Wedderburn and Charlton, and Korong and Wycheproof are
newspaper, flour mill, church and school townships, with good
accommodation for man and beast at the various hotels, and
interesting studies of rural life in all the country round about.
Not much of the picturesque, perhaps, for the rivers here are all
of the tame Australian sort, and the hills are low and all unfledged
now, but still an industrious and resourceful country, in which
population will always increase and material wealth ever
grow. Should we start from Maryborough on the Donald route,
last line of our north-western section, we must glance backward


from Maryborough, first south as far as Clunes, on the skirts
of the beautiful Ballarat country, and then east and west along
two sections of that overland route afore mentioned, which runs
from Echuca on the Murray to Portland by the sea.
Maryborough was no mean city when depending on her own
resources, as centre of a great mining country and coaching
business; but when it was resolved that these two great routes —
from Melbourne to Donald, and Echuca to Portland —should
meet and cross at her station, her importance, from a railway
standpoint, was enormously increased, and station accommodation
was proposed and sanctioned, which might seem wholly dis-
proportionate to the size of the town. It has to be remembered,
however, that many villages lie round about Maryborough ; that
it is practically the Ballarat or Bendigo of its district; and that,
long before railway days, King Cobb maintained there an
establishment which, to one unfamiliar with the surrounding
country, would have seemed, doubtless, disproportionate and
ridiculous. A good place still to settle for a while and study the
digging life, is Maryborough ; and for recreation, a very charming
little plesaunce is provided by a mimic artificial lake close to
the town, with garden and recreation reserves around. Then
Talbot is near to Maryborough—a very considerable village, and
Clunes is half way on the lines which connects with Ballarat.
Clunes, by reason of its great and profitable mines, is very
familiar in our mining history. We must not, however, mislead
readers by mentioning Clunes in connection with this section.
The route from Melbourne to Clunes is by way of Ballarat, and
Maryborough lies but an hour farther along the same line. We
have only chosen to include Maryborough here, because the line
and the country beyond seem fairly within the north-western
section. The branch to Ararat may be divided between the two
systems, that to Castlemaine also ; and along either of these con-
necting links there is very pleasant and picturesque scenery, good
agriculture and mining, and interesting relics of old digging with
every mile.
Journeying northward, Havelock and Bet Bet are mining town-
ships both, while Dunolly is another famous centre, whence


strikes out the line connecting with Inglewood, on which are a
long succession of reefs and mines in the hard, rugged hills which
overlook the Loddon Valley. Tarnagulla here is an historical
name, Bealiba and Mt. Moliagul and Berlin are near by, honey-
combed hills and quarried mountains, where, in old days, many a
“jeweller’s shop ” and mammoth nugget were discovered. Nor is
the digging country left behind on this route till another culmina-
tion is reached at St. Arnaud —a town of very considerable
importance, with substantial banks and public buildings, and well-
kept and well-shaded streets. Silver was discovered at St. Arnaud
in the early years, and the promise seemed once fair as that
of those later born of Broken Hill and Mt. Zeehan. But it was
not similarly realised ; and now, though gold is still won all around,
and in very considerable quantities, and though the old mines of
Stuart Mill and Landsborough, on the old northern coach road,
still focus on St. Arnaud, the main staple is wheat. Wheat,
with the various produce of the farms, thanks to public spirit,
private enterprise, and Government encouragement, is ever in-
creasing. Tis but a brief run to Donald, the terminus here, and
all through a pleasant country lightly timbered, with eyes of light
at Swanwater and Cope Cope in picturesque little fresh water
lakes. But at Donald —a very substantial and thriving township,
with tillage and progress of many kinds around —vineyard planting,
wheat fields spreading, and homes forming on every side. A
little beyond Donald, the Richardson or Avon loses itself in the
Buloke Lake. And then all north, as north from Warracknabeal
and Nhill and Dimboola and Wycheproof and Boort and Swan
Hill, the mallee country, with its traditions, its mysteries, its tale
of late-born development, and its marvellous progress. A
comprehensive view should be given of all that land under the
head of
The Mallee Country.
The north-east corner of Victoria —a country that is bounded
on the south by an irregular line drawn about midway between
the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh parallels of latitude, on the
north by the River Murray, on the west by South Australia, and


on the east by a line which might run ten miles easterly still of
longitude 143. It is not a patch of country, not a corner, in the
ordinary acceptance of the term, but an area of 150 miles by 160
miles at the least, containing not less than 25,000 square miles.
It is a country that people generally know very little about, that
nobody has done much good with, that has broken the banks of
many men, the hearts of not a few; that contains the skeleton and the
ugly ghosts of many a bright dream. It is haunted by the spirit
of the heritage of our desolation; it is endurable only to those
who love the wilderness, or who dauntlessly labour for its redemp-
tion. It was through many years an absolute terra incognita —an
unapproachable country to people of the metropolis, and the
tame lands of the coast. But now, our railways run right to its
edge, and any man who desires to know what the mallee is like
can train to Wycheproof, or Donald, or Dimboola, or Warrackna-
beal, and from any of the little inland hills, which rise near to
most of these townships, look out and behold the monotonous
leaf-sea, which rolls away to the limits of vision, and only breaks
into the alluvial plains by the Murray, or about the lakes, great
and small, fresh and salt, which receive the northern flowing
rivers, or mark their mysterious courses to the Murray, towards
which they all tend. There is not much to be learned by such a
look at the mallee, the wilderness of dull green leaves, of ragged
brown stalks, seeming to afford nothing more nutritious or useful
than the arid soil which produces them. They are too stiff to
move wave-like to any wind that may pass over and through them,
nor under any circumstances do they yield any music or pleasant
forest sounds. There is a dry sort of rustle, like the inarticulate
murmur of many parched tongues, from the leaves, and the
innumerable strips and shreds of dead bark beat against the
stems like the wasting garments against the bones of a gibbet.
The broad wing of an eagle is frequently seen against the dismal
earth garment or the glorious blue of the sky, and black crows
are frequent, their croaks according well with the eerie rustle of


bark shreds. Even on a first look it is easy to understand and to
realise the many old stories of demented belated bushmen lost in
this horrid waste, the gradual increase of the fever of thirst, the
madness of fear, the feeble attempts to steer a straight course of
the first day or two, the wild rushes which followed, and then the
invariable casting away of every shred of clothing, and the head-
long fall in utter exhaustion, which left the bared body for the
dingo’s tooth and the beak of the crow ; and by-and-by a skeleton
or a few scattered bones, with nothing to give the faintest clue to
identity. Many and many a tragedy of that sort has occurred
between any of those southern hilltops and the distant banks of
the Murray. And yet there are evidences that the blacks have
from time immemorial ranged over the mallee. For sixty miles
north from the edge of the great desert we cross on the overland
journey to Adelaide their wells and the signs of their old encamp-
ments are seen. Thence they seem always to have struck
north-east, making to the Murray, probably by the underground
channel of the Wimmera River, whose course can sometimes be
traced by shallow surface lakes, and always by those indications
of water near to the surface which the blacks know so well. They
had pleasant camping grounds in their winter pilgrimages, for
frequent throughout the mallee there are sand-ridges with groves
of pines and little grassy plains about them. The numerous
dead pine boughs made the best of fuel, and the easily broken
pine foliage good beds or thatch for gunyahs, and wallaby or
kangaroo, or emu, would be easily enough taken, and the sand-
hills are in all weathers dry and warm.
The blacks would never approach Lake Tyrrell, which lies a
hundred miles to the east, shallow and salt and dreary, the whole
body of water moving with the wind, spreading sometimes on a
rough night over miles of apparent desert floor, right up to the
fires and tents of travellers, who have encamped far enough away
on the previous evening ; at others receding as if drawn by tidal
influence, and leaving other dreary miles. But often they would
encamp about other, fairer lakes, Hindmarsh on the one side,


Boort and Lalbert on the other, with all their contiguous waters,
which, in rainy years, team with fish and swarm with wild-
fowl. To the whiz of their boomerangs then, as to the crack of a
gun or the hoof-beat of a horse now, tens of thousands of swans,
of native companions, of ibis, crane, pelican, geese, ducks of all
sorts would rise with sounding flight. Louder the sound seems
at times on a frosty night than the beat of ten thousand hoofs on
the plain, thunderous and long continued, and breaking ultimately
into many diverse sounds ; greater and lesser splashes far out in
the water, swift passing whistles of air-cutting wings, and clamorous
flight far aloft of marshalled flocks making to other meres.
There were, and there are, many perfect beauty spots about the
mallee lakes, or the lakes on the malice’s edge, filled by the
occasional overflow of the rivers. Boort any time of spring or
autumn is well worth a journey, and offers also all the charms of
a perfect winter holiday, square miles of crystal water, fresh and
well stocked with fish, wild fowl by millions, miles of silver beach,
and a climate which is indeed divine.
The first pioneer, perhaps, was old Major Mitchell, whose track
is seen along the southern edge of the mallee, though before him
Captain Sturt had seen a little probably in his voyage down the
Murray. Then came the squatters, penetrating from the north
and the south, taking up vast areas, and in good seasons making
a little use of them. They held sway of the fat lands and the
poor, the plains and the scrub, from the date of their occupation,
to the enactment of that legislation which let the whole of the
rural population loose on the land, to plough and sow in suitable
localities, to duff cattle and levy blackmail on others. The
selectors harassed the squatters, and in many instances destroyed
them. They in turn felt the terrible invasion of the rabbits, and
were themselves in many instances impoverished or destroyed.
The rabbits entered into possession of the mallee. Ten years
ago they were in possession, and six years ago they had so far
destroyed the country that nobody cared to take up and hold
it under the tenure then obtainable. The rabbits made food for
the dingoes, the eagle-hawks and crows. These ghouls of the


wilderness were never so pinched by famine as to take the
poisoned bait, however seductively spread. In drought years
they increased therefore, and sad was the havoc amongst the
flocks. In some few instances the old process of shepherding
by day and yarding by night was resorted to ; in others the
stations were deserted, the whole of the stock having wasted
away. Drovers then saw dozens of red eye-balls gleaming within
gunshot of their fires, and no man in the camp got much sleep
till the open country was reached. It was very evident that a
new order had become necessary, and that the mallee, if it was to
be conquered, must be attacked in other ways.
Gradually, and in many ways, that new attack has been
proceeding. Some thoroughly enterprising people have taken
advantage of every opportunity reasonable legislation and inven-
tion of new means have afforded. A fair rental and tenure were
the first essentials, and these over all but the very poorest —the
desert or heath —country have now been granted. Then came the
cheap supply of wire netting and barbed wire. The one rendered
it possible to fence out the rabbits, the other the dogs. And
when once a man had only his own ground to deal with he went
to work with a will. Many mistakes were made, and much
money wasted. The ordinary rabbiters became in some instances
capitalists, in others thieves and spreaders of the plague they were
engaged to subdue. They did not do so much in this way in
Victoria as in New South Wales, for financial matters were a little
better managed here. Still, more than ,£200,000 was expended
on the Victorian mallee, and not to much purpose till the new
sort of squatters began to fence in and dig out, and poison.
Pioneers of another sort are the laborious selectors —the farmers
who have taken up the rich mallee land, and discovered that
under proper management it can be easily cleared, and will grow
magnificent wheat. Another, in his own peculiar way, was our
good friend, Mr. Bosisto, inventor and manufacturer of the
world-renowned eucalypti extract; and yet another was the first
exporter of mallee roots as fuel. These with the managers of the
great experiment at Mildura, are now engaged in subduing that


north-western province of our colony, and if we come to under-
stand them and their work a little better, we shall be prepared
to afford them a little more sympathy, and to help them in their
work in every reasonable and practical manner.
Undoubtedly the true great Victorian terminus of the Mallee
lines must be Mildura. There the greatest experiment Victoria
has ever seen is now being worked out. There already full
five thousand people are settled. There ultimately will be a
city marvellous as Broken Hill on the Barrier, or Bendigo or
Ballarat in the Victorian inlands in the fifties.


THE G I EPS LAND LINES.
I.—The Sale and Bairnsdale Line.
f'ROM Dandenong, the terminus of the suburban line, two
railways, with various branches, go off through Gippsland.
The main line, first constructed, runs now to Bairnsdale,
on the Mitchell River—Bairnsdale, which divides with
Sale the claim to be considered the chief city of the
Lakes country. Dandenong, and the country round about, might
come more properly within the tourist lines. Berwick and
Beaconsfield, Officer and Pakenham, are all centres of a rich
and picturesque country, divided into considerable holdings, held,
generally, by hotel and boardinghouse keepers, or well-to-do folks
of the city, who have established there their country homes. It
is not till Nar-Nar-Goon is reached that we come on anything
like true agricultural country. Thence onward for many a mile
the railway runs through rich scrub and forest land which, by
infinite labour through many years, has been brought under
cultivation, and is now to be classed amongst the richest and best
country of the colony. Never a railway in Australia has done


more to open up difficult country than this main Gippsland line.
Without it, such towns as Bunyip, Drouin, and Warragul could
never have had an existence. Very painfully, and with many a
breakdown, the coaches in the old days used to plough along
here, carrying the mails between Melbourne and Sale ; and it was
considered on many hands to be an utterly ridiculous matter
then to dream of making a railway which would not pay grease for
the wheels. The railway, which runs now, is not to be classed as
one of the very best paying lines of the colony, but really its value
is not to be assessed in this way. It gave to us a new territory;
it settled for us thousands of industrious, enterprising people, who,
by a single decade of labour, have made for themselves com-
petencies, and in some few instances, amassed very considerable
fortunes.
Warragul, in the anti-railway days, consisted of a shanty and a
cattle-yard ; but the Warragul of to-day is one of the most thriving
townships of the colony, with a branch line running north to
Neerim —to the heart of the big tree country. And Drouin,
reached before Warragul, is by no means a mean town. For far
away on either side of the line run bush tracks through the big
forests and the rich scrub lands, only broken as yet by patches of
cultivation. Some farms about Warragul are cultivated almost tc
perfection, and, happily, seem destined to be just as prolific in the
hands of the next generation as at present. For the great virtue
and value of these scrub lands consists in the fact that they are
practically inexhaustible. They never wear out, they cannot be
worked out; you may crop them with potatoes year by year, and,
so long as the cultivation is good, the yield will always be
satisfactory. A visitor, desirous of understanding how the big
scrub and actual jungle of Australia is dealt with by the settlers,
could not do better than settle down for a week or two at any
town between Bunyip and Traralgon, travelling over the various
short cockspur lines, or making occasional bush excursions. It is
almost melancholy at times, to those who desire to conserve
natural beauty, or who attach a proper value to the gigantic
harvests of the forests, to see the wreckage, waste, and spoliation


carried on here, of forests, the growth of hundreds of years, and
fern-tree gullies, whose beauty has been perfected through centuries.
All this must go, however, if the farmer is to live; and there is
some compensation in the fact that scores of these gullies have
been actually reproduced in and about Melbourne, and, indeed,
in many of our inland towns; even in Bendigo a fern-tree gully
exists, chiefly through the energy and skill of Mr. Gadd, curator of
the gardens, who has run pipes and taps innumerable over all their
ponds, and manages to keep a good trickle of water going, even
in the hottest summer.
Moe is a pleasant township on a river which now bears the
name of Mondarra; and a short coal line runs south from Moe
by Coalville, and Narracan to Thorpdale. A more important
cockspur is that from Morwell to North Mirboo, opening up a
tract of very rich country, and piercing right to the heart of that
broad area which lies between the two Gippsland lines. A little
further on from Traralgon the line runs out and in, like an
ana-branch of one of our great inland rivers, by Glengarry, Toon-
gabbie, Cowarr, Heyfield, and Tenambra, to Maffra, and in again
by Stratford, on the main line to Bairnsdale. This line serves a
very rich country, occupied chiefly by farmers and fattening
graziers. Down here come droves innumerable of big bullocks
from the Warrego and Western Queensland, many of them twelve
months on the road before they are turned in to the rich paddocks
of this country, where three months’ quiet feeding makes them
prime for the Melbourne markets. Maffra and Heyfield divide
claims for supremacy here. Both are busy towns, and business is
brought to Maffra by yet another short branch line, which runs
out by Boisdale to Briagolong. All this country lies at the feet
of the rough spurs of the Big Divide. Amongst it are many
isolated groups of miners, and the one great mining township of
Walhalla.
Walhalla is the centre of another forest country. Indeed, it
may be said that about as much of the glory of Victoria as could
be summed up in any hundred miles, would be found on a route


from Toongabbie, in Gippsland, to Mansfield, the present terminus
of a branch off the great north-eastern. Coaches run to Walhalla
daily; but thence onward to Wood’s Point, the track is very rough,
and not particularly well-defined. From Wood’s Point the road
runs to Jamieson, on the Jamieson River, a locality we have
already described.
The tourist, of course, in Gippsland, thinks first, at his
first start, to go to the lakes; those picturesque inlets of
the ocean, and great freshwater sheets, joined together by
rivers, and affording navigable water for a straight run from Sale
to the old Lakes’ Entrance, of more than xoo miles. Sale, which
we suppose will permanently claim the dignity of the chief town
of this Gippsland province, is very pleasantly and advantageously
situated on the Latrobe River. Sale is a town whose existence
dates from early periods in the colony’s history. They had a
settlement at Sale long before the digging days, for pioneer
settlers very early discovered and took possession of those rich
plains round about, and many a schooner-load of sheep and
cattle was sent round to Melbourne and across to Tasmania and
New Zealand, before even a bridle path was cut through the
scrubs of Warragul and Bunyip, where now runs the main trunk
line, joining town to town. Agricultural followed on pastoral
occupation, and many hundreds of farmers established homes in
the Sale district, depending on water carriage solely, to get their
produce to market. And when the railway came, the township
boomed apace, and all the old established institutions of church
and state and schools began to establish themselves in suitable
habitations. At the present time the town is well-built, the roads
well-made, the side-walks planted with trees, the river deepened
and locked so as to make navigation, even for crafts of very
considerable tonnage, easy and safe for the Lakes.
Of the Lakes we will speak a little further on. Just
now we may finish with the main line; nearly due north
from Sale to Stratford it runs. Stratford-on-Avon, though
not, except in its name, resembling in anyway that Stratford


of old. All farming country round about Stratford; and on
to Munro, and Fernbank, and Lindenow, and Bairnsdale,
on the Mitchell River, where every tourist should go, and
if he desire a quiet life with abundant opportunities for all
manner of sport, rowing, riding, fishing, or shooting, he cannot
do better than stay for a spell. The Mitchell at Bairnsdale, runs
for about ten miles, broad, deep, and tranquil, down to the Lakes.
The town is built on either bank of the river, and covers a very
considerable space of ground. It is rather a commodious than a
convenient town, well-provided with hotels, busy on market days
and show times, and seldom without some few visitors who have
come down for the Lakes.
The Lakes want something more than a cursory description.
Though local guide books and frequent newspaper articles have
made them pretty well known. A glance at the map will discover
them to consist of a series of inlets of the ocean, connected
with great fresh water sheets, fed by the largest and most steady
flowing rivers in Victoria. The Latrobe, the Avon, the Tambo,
the Mitchell receive all the rain which fall on the southern and
eastern slopes of the Main Divide and coastal range, and discharge
them into the three lakes. The Latrobe and the Avon both pour
noble streams into Lake Wellington, the Tambo into Lake
Victoria, and the Mitchell into Lake King, which is the nearest
great lake to the ocean entrance. A very well-conducted steamer
service runs between Sale and Bairnsdale, and occasional boats
make right round from Melbourne to the recently-constructed
Lakes Entrance, and thence up to Bairnsdale and Sale. The
interest of the Lakes to tourists and visitors is varied almost as
the tastes and dispositions of mankind. If sport is desired, there
is fishing of every sort. You may cast a fly and bring out a very
pretty perch within a couple of miles of Sale on the Latrobe; you
may hook whiting down on the shallows, or, as with all sail set
you scud across the water, catch the pike on Lake King. And if
a little adventurous work is desired, here is a bit of description
of a haul on the Ninety Mile Beach, outside the old Lakes
Entrance :
“Ten o’clock arrives, a clear, cold, starlight night. The boat


comes down from her moorings in Reeves River, and with nets
and crew on board puts out to the bar. The breakers hit her
hard, the spray flashes across her bows, but the crew know their
work, and in less than a quarter of an hour she is through and
inside a sand bank, which affords partial shelter from the long
ocean roll. The line attached to one end of the net is put
ashore, and the boat shoots round in a semi-circle, putting out
about 300 fathoms, and making the beach 100 yards further
down. Then all hands land, and we haul her up, and the
fishermen take to the lines and pull away steadily. The surf
comes in with a tolerable heavy roll, and they can only take in
when the inward rush gives them advantage against the backward
flow. There is nothing to be done but hold on. Fathom after
fathom is brought ashore, but so far nothing can be seen. The
water is inky black, the surf lines breaking with something of a
phosphorescent gleam. By degrees the hauling becomes harder,
the backward rush more vehement. It requires desperate effort
to hold on now, and flinging themselves on their back and
jamming their heels in the sand the fishermen are dragged down
the slope of the beach. There is evidently a terrible undertow,
or something heavy in the bunt of that net. We all go down
and put our weight on the lines, holding when the back rush
comes and running in hard when the inward surge helps us.
Twenty minutes’ work of that sort, perhaps, and then the punt is
right in amongst the rollers, and, as ill luck will have it, they came
in uncommonly heavy. We can see a huge netted sack full of
scaly monsters, all fighting like mad. The tide tumbles them
over, the sole of the net is drawn back by the undertow. * They
are all out,’ say the fishermen ; ‘ they have all escaped ; we have
lost them all.’ And we see a perfect shoal of kingfish, skipjack,
schnapper, and bass, flash away through the surf, and make out
to the deeps in wild fright. But the fishermen fight hard to
save all they can. One seizes a fifty pound monster by the tail,
another (his mate) by the gills, and they hurry up the beach.
The net is rolled over them, and all that are meshed or caught


in the folds are secured. They are dragged up and sorted out.
There are three great kingfish, a couple of skipjack, a schnapper,
and a good many baskets of bass. (The bass is the fish miscalled
salmon, about which I shall have more to say by-and-by.) About
half a ton in all, worth to the fisherman, clear of all expenses,
at least £6. Not bad pay for a couple of hours’ work, but it
must not be forgotten that the work has not been of a common
sort. There has been arduous labour, some little task in drench-
ing from heel to head in winter water, and some considerable
damage to the net. There would be time, however, for another
haul if the surf roll were not too heavy, and possibly with even
better results.”
For the man with the gun there are all manner of waterfowl,
from the great black swan and the cumbrous pelican to the dainty
little teal, least, yet, perhaps, most delicious of all the water game.
Frequently enough, also, quail and snipe available on the flats
and inland, not unfrequently fairly good sport amongst wongas
and bronzewings ; but of the scenery of the lakes, one cannot
truthfully speak with much enthusiasm, unless when on rare
occasions Nature chooses to make remarkable and exceptional
effects.
The general contour of the shore-line is flat and uninteresting ;
hills of a tolerable altitude rise inland occasionally; but stunted
gum, ti-tree, and the ordinary swamp growth make up the usual
margin.
’Tis a very pleasant trip down the river from Bairnsdale, the
hop and maize fields on either hand, the bank fringed with reeds,
and overhung with wattles. An hour after starting, the boat
steams through the broad channel which skirts the long, flat,
narrow cape into Lake King. The luminous home of waters
and of fish opens broad before us, and as we steam out the far
away blue mountains rise beyond the dark, low timbered hills.
There are streaks of snow in the clefts of Mount Wellington, but
every other height is far faint cobalt. The lake is smooth as glass,
and ten thousand swans and a hundred thousand ducks are sailing
or resting on its broad surface. And when the wooded point of


Rosherville is rounded, and the narrow waters of the Reeves River
reached, there is a near and picturesque beauty on either coast,
which does not disappoint the traveller whose taste is fastidious by
surfeit of the beauties of many lands. The new entrance is a bold
and, by grace of nature, a successful undertaking. Where the
united streams of all the inland waters converge, a channel was
cut through the sand bar, and training walls constructed on either
side. For a long time the ocean seemed to resent this intrusion,
and filled up the entrance way with sand, which seemed to
heap higher with every tide. At last, however, nature was
kind, and there were great rains on the hills and high floods
in the rivers, and the gathered volume of the fresh waters
making out between the walls tore away the bar and carried the
sand far out to sea. A broad, deep channel indeed was made,
which has since been kept open by the scour of the tide and the
river waters, which are always considerable. Steamers and sailing
craft now come in and out with perfect safety, and make away to
Bairnsdale across Lake King, or on the longer journey to Sale by
the two lakes and the river.
Hotels and accommodation houses are abundant on the lakes,
every picturesque or convenient spot being taken up in this way.
Indeed, it has been said, and with a good deal of truth, that just
as good meat, drink, and lodging can be obtained at Rosherville
or Cunningham, the old entrance, as at any hotel in the City.
Nightfall at the Lake’s Entrance shows, usually, much of beauty.
The hills lie around in lines of grace and grandeur, the whole
smooth surface of the water is slowly flushed with pink, the
honeysuckles gleam more silvery than any olives, and an
occasional flash of spray is seen where the breakers are booming
on the bar.
Paynesville is the true fisherman’s village of the lakes. It is
fairly situated on M'Lellan’s Straits, and lives and grows and
thrives on the fishing industry. Fishermen live in all the houses,
and support all the institutions of the place. There are 100
families at the least, forming a prosperous and well-ordered
community, and displaying an enterprise which compares more
than favourably with that of any agricultural village. They have


their well-built and well-found boats. They have at their own
cost run out jetties into the lake waters. They build comfortable
cottages, and cultivate patches of garden ground; are not prone to
over-exertion! but it has to be remembered that a fisherman always
looks lazy unless he is actually at work. There is, a mile from
the town, a factory just completed for the preserving of fish and
game. One can but approve and commend the enterprise which
established it, but why enter into competition in this way with the
establishes industries of all the world when this business of
supplying fresh fish to 300,000 people is open to anyone who will
undertake it ?
Leaving Paynesville at midday, early afternoon finds the boat
on the broad fresh waters of Lake Wellington, all of which the
local people desire to have closed against net fishing. It is a
great inland sea, upon which the stiff southerly breeze makes a
nasty jobling swell. And the wave motion seems to disturb a
muddy bottom, for the whole surface is a dull brown colour, such
as we see in mountain streams after a heavy flood. It becomes
cold, also, in the winter there, and the shore-line is far away, and
clouds come down and obscure the snow-streaks in the clefts ot
Mount Wellington. You are better in the cabin, and only leave
the cabin when, a little before sundown, the mouth of the river is
reached, and the little boat begins to cleave her rapid way between
the banks of the deep, still, narrow stream. You get on deck
then, and may be privileged to witness a bit of such strange
mysterious beauty as many a man has admitted he has not before
seen in all the travels and experience of a long life. The wind
has died utterly. The clouds are all still in the sky, and the
waters of the river have become a perfect mirror. They wind
hither and thither, forming deep pools around the long bends.
And in each pool the trees, the reeds, the scrub, and the changing
beauty of the sky are perfectly reflected. Pale brown, dark green
and black, rose and amber, and purple and violet. The captain
is at the wheel, and all his watchfulness is needed, for he can only
steer by the lines of the tree-tops. The reflections are so perfect
that there appear to be three rivers, with inverted trees —clear and
tangible, it would appear, as those which stand erect in their


familiar and natural form. The wild-fowl and the frogs are talking
in the swamps, and that strange creature, the musk-duck, rises
frequently, and flaps heavily in his abortive flight, which never
takes him fairly clear of the water. The boom of the bittern is
occasionally heard, the wail of the curlew, and the deep-throated
challenge of some short-horned lord of the pastures who scents
the approach of a foe. It is a very beautiful and somewhat weird
river journey up the Latrobe River to Sale on any clear still
evening, and the voyageur , if in any way of artistic mind, is not
disposed to rejoice greatly when the signal of “ Dead slow ” warns
him that the journey is almost done.
Bairnsdale, in the present, is the terminus of this main
Gippsland line, for beyond Bairnsdale lies that wild country,
though patched with resources of various sorts, which is known to
Victorians generally as Croajingolong. The Big Divide traverses
this country. The Dargo and Mitchell Rivers take their rise
on the southern slopes of its watershed. The Mitta Mitta and
Buffalo, and earliest Goulburn feeders on the north and west,
pushing thence their opposite courses. There is much that is
beautiful in the way of scenery in this country, and of it very little
is so far known. It lies off the main track of the tourist, and is
not very well provided with hotels. Its coach service is not
remarkable, and so many broad stretches are commonplace as
barren, that the visitor, even as the settler, resolves generally to
leave it alone. Railway surveys have been made from Bairnsdale
right along the coast to Orbost, on the Snowy River, and thence
right on to Maliecoota Inlet, the most beautiful and least
accessible of all land and sea waters of Australia. When the
railway will run to Maliecoota, or to the Genoa River, which
enters it 26 miles from the sea, is a problem we may leave to the
future. Some day—beyond doubt—we shall run a railway
right through this Croajingolong country, touching and
junctioning with New South Wales at Monaro, and so
opening up a tourist route right along the coast from Melbourne
to Sydney, of which almost every mile will be through picturesque
country. There is, however, one more tourist spot connected
with the Lake’s system here, and it should not be neglected. It is


Lake Tyers, another inlet of the sea, 14 miles on the coast from
Cunningham, at the old Lake’s Entrance. This little lake is
generally allowed by visitors to be the gem of Gippsland. It is
indeed a very beautiful spot. The water is almost completely
shut in by a high, wide sand bar, across which the waves only
break at high tide or in wild weather. Fair green hills run round
at the northern side. Honeysuckle, lightwood, and occasional
oaks fringe the beach, and long, deep arms run far inland, through
picturesque mountains, whose height and rugged character
increase with every mile. Boarding establishments on a very
grand scale have, for some years past, been in existence on Lake
Tyers, the chief house there having accommodation for 100 guests,
all of whom travel to Sale or Bairnsdale by rail, then making the
water trip to Cunningham, and the rest of the journey by coach or
private vehicle.
The Great Southern.
This latest constructed of what may be termed Trunk Lines
of Victoria strikes into country of which, prior to its
construction, very little was known —a rich country from
the beginning, and very near to Melbourne, yet neglected
until the projection of this line. Lyndhurst and Cranbourne,
Clyde and Tooradin, seemed, until the railway touched them,
as far removed from Melbourne as Echuca or Albury; and,
strange to say, all the country round about was rich and
eminently adapted to market gardening or dairy farming, or
any of the varied interests which go to supply the mighty and
multitudinous wants of Melbourne. Yet through many decades,
even while dairy farming was being carried on far w r est of
Warrnambool, and north of Rochester and Wycheproof, there
was not much done in this country beyond fattening cattle for the
Melbourne markets. A marvellous great change came, however,
with the beginning of the railway. It began to be understood
that this land had an exceptional value, that it was easily
cultivated, enjoyed an abundant rainfall, and could, with labour
and enterprise, be made profitable, almost as actual suburban
land. With the survey of the railway, allotments became


marvellously enhanced in value, and with the construction,
settlement progressed on either side. The townships grew as by
magic. Dairy farming became a settled, established industry.
Butter factories were started, and it was soon manifest that this
latest opened would become one of the richest and most popular
districts of Victoria. Driving right onward went the railway,
skirting the shores of Westernport, traversing the vast neglected
forests which grow there, running through swamps, and across
hard ridges, and over great tracts of rich unutilised volcanic soil,
every acre of which should be down in potatoes, or lucerne, or
clover, or any of the many crops which with good soil
accommodate an abundance of labour. Tooradin being opened
became at once, and continues, a favourite resort. It lies fairly
upon the shores of Westernport, and from it French Island, that
terra incognita to most people, is easily accessible. Indeed, all
the waters of this great bay are easily reached from Tooradin, but
the customary route is by way of Frankston to Stony Point. The
eastern shore of the bay, however, will be quite sufficient for most
tourists to explore; and in the numerous creeks and inlets there
any amount of good shooting and fishing can be obtained, while
ten miles inland will generally tap as wild a country as the man
who loves nature’s solitudes could desire. The great and beautiful
forest, which had the name of the Blackwood Reserve, lies near
upon the shore of Westernport here, though if that is sought by
rail, the marvellous developments of the Koo-Wee-Rup Swamp
are passed. We may first, however, take a glance at the
forest, the Blackwood Reserve, reserved in the old days primarily
as a permanent source for supplying blackwood timber for railway
carriage building. Great works were undertaken, and indeed
accomplished, in that reserve. Tram lines were run out from
scrub wilderness to forest depths, where the blackwoods run up
with stems like the Amygdalina, or true blue gum. Tens of
thousands —millions, indeed—of these straight blackwood sticks
may be seen there to-day, although there was a good deal of
felling when the trams were running and the mills at work. But
they tell us that the cost of obtaining this timber, dragging it into
the mills, carting it thence to the crown of the hill overlooking


Westernport, and shooting it down to the place of shipment, was
greater than that of obtaining it from the forests of Tasmania. It
seems to us that it ought not to have been so, and that even if
there were a little difference in the cost, this great reserve should
have been permanently maintained as Government property, and
the forest have been developed on scientific principles, so a
permanent source of revenue would have been created
and maintained ; and when, as must ultimately be the
case, Tasmanian forests utterly give out, Victoria would have had
a timber supply of her own. Thrown open to the selectors, the
beautiful reserve has been mercilessly hacked and chopped about.
A considerable portion, reserved as endowment for agricultural
colleges, has certainly been spared, and in this there is a
wildness and beauty, and a phase of original Australian life,
which will repay the appreciative visitor for all cost and trouble
of reaching it. Following one of the old tram lines —and even
that cannot be done without some difficulty, so frequently are they
overgrown by the jungle, or blocked by fallen trees —you pass
through a forest which seems indeed to be primeval. The great
gums rise towerlike from their roots, tapering as lances before they
throw out their first bows. The blackwood or the lightwood throws
up a straight clean barrel of full 50 feet; and that beautiful tree
of which we hear so much, the silver wattle, flourishes here
in mile-broad groves. The air is fragrant in the heat of the day
with the exhaled odours of the musk tree. The tall hazel scrub
rises like a mighty bamboo grove, and frequent, through the
denseness of the foliage, are heard the peculiar and imitative calls
of the lyre and bower birds. Often, too, on these tracts—sure sign
that they are practically deserts—may be found “ play-houses ”of
the lyre-birds, strange little conical mounds of earth, flattened on
top—pedestals, in fact, rather than cones —wherein these peculiar
creatures sport and play, and mimic all animated nature around
them. Apart from this reserve, fire and steel have been sent
through the forest, and, ruthless as it seems, that is the only way


of subduing it. The selector taking up his block must take his axe
in hand forthwith, and cut down the scrub before him, just as the
mower or reaper levels the field of wheat. Thousands of acres
may now be seen there submitted to this harsh but necessary
treatment, and when the summer’s sun has rendered the whole
fallen mass combustible, a match is put in, and quickly the whole
lot becomes a burning, fiery furnace. Very desolate, very
dismal, does the earth’s face appear when the fire has done its
work. Every great tree is scorched and blackened to its summit,
and all below is covered with ash and charcoal and charred logs.
A very little clearing up, however, exposes sufficient soil for the
grass seed, which is next scattered on, and all amongst the black
stems, and all over the ash-covered earth, in the next spring is a
magnificent growth of clover or grass. And working on, year by
year, the industrious selector gets stem after stem out, and tree
after tree down, until, ultimately, as about the older settlements
of Warragul and Morwell, most perfect fields and pastures are
formed around the homes of settlers, to whom financial trouble
will never more be known. But without the railway, be it always
remembered, this work would be impracticable, because the
produce of the land could never be got to town ; and by a railway
only is the country made accessible to the visitors, who, if
desirous of knowing what Australia is, and how in some respects
developed, cannot do better than take the Great Southern, and
halt for a while at Tooradin, or any of the half dozen stations
further along.
The Koo-Wee-Rup is a different class of business altogether.
Originally Koo-Wee-Rup was a gigantic swamp, lying between
the mountain feet and the sea—in its original condition
absolutely worthless, because saturated always with water which
could not get away, and sour and cold, and, save to the wild fowl,
very uncomfortable and very unprofitable. Many a great swamp
of this kind lies scattered through the colony, each and everyone


doubtless to be ultimately dealt with as this of Koo-Wee-Rup.
For, even prior to the advent of the railway, good engineering
skill was brought to bear on this black morass. Trenches were
cut through it in connection with the great system of subsidiary
drainage, and the bulk of its area, flooded from the overplus of
water, and mellowed by the sunshine for the first time let in,
broke up into a fine friable meadow-land, such as gladdens the
heart of every intelligent farmer. The great drainage works are
now approaching completion, and the great swamp, in a couple of
years’ time, will be transformed into one great garden, dairy, and
fruit farm, subdivided by dykes and ditches, and as well tilled as
any patch of the Netherlands of Europe. This great field of labour
is by no means unworthy of visitation, for we do not take it, that
the visitor to Australia, or even the Australian traveller, is led or
controlled solely by a desire for mighty mountain heads or forests
or waterfalls. The industries of the land, the sources of its
future wealth and prosperity have at least an equivalent interest,
and should have an equal power of attraction. We will not,
however, linger too long, either on swamp or forest, for this line
is attractive throughout its whole length. The Cape Paterson
country, and the watershed of the Powlett River lies south of the
line, and as it is accessible from Loch or Korumburra stations,
it should not be passed by. There is coal in this country, and
though, as yet, no seam has been pierced of a sufficient thickness
to pay for the working, the quality is very good. It is not lignite
at all, to break into dust at the first touch of the poker, but,
like the Newcastle, brakes up into flakes and splinters, yielding
an abundance of gas and flame. And all about this country there
is rich land, great forests, and a splendid country for agriculture
or dairy farming, or marine residences for those lucky people who
can afford to maintain two establishments. The coast line from
Woolamai to Cape Paterson, is frequently bold, though varied
by sketches of sandy beach and little nooks of bays lightly and
gracefully timbered, and furnished specially, as one might think,
for the picnickers’ or campers’ enjoyment. The Powlett River
may become the centre of a great tourist country here. Along
to the Powlett, travelling from San Remo, just within the eastern


hill of Westernport, there is as grand a beach, fringed with ag
lovely a sand ridge as one could find along the whole Australian
coast. The honeysuckle here attains a marvellous growth, rising
with a trunk two feet in diameter, to an altitude of full twenty
feet, and forming then a great symmetrical, shadowing crown,
beneath which is almost invariably spread a perfect carpet ot
grass. And the water coming down from the hills bright and
clear, flows over the flats, and right beside this honeysuckle the
Powlett makes a broad deep estuary, into which the tide flows,
rippling over the rocks, and in which, at low tide, the fresh water
makes to the sea, in which perfect bathing may be obtained,
and generally good fishing also, whiting and grey mullet coming
in at times in shoals. There is already a very large hotel built
on the Powlett River, about two miles from the coast, and if a
really good road were made to the railway station, and some
enterprise, animated by artistic principle, should develop down
there, there is little doubt that the Powlett would become the centre
of a most popular tourist country.
It is not a charming country which lies beyond, down
to Anderson’s Inlet, but there again the blending of land
and water makes beauty. The sea reaches far inland,
the hills encircle the water, which is gracefully clothed,
and beautifully fledged with the olive silver honeysuckle
timber; at its further end tire Tar win River comes into the inlet,
and on the Tarwin Flats is some of the richest riverside country
we know. Anderson’s Inlet has already been largely taken up
by the enterprising folks who provide and purvey for tourists and
visitors. At the township there are very good hotels, and large
and commodious boarding-houses. Boats also are available, and
generally pretty good fishing, but a tidal rush in the water at
times, if not very well understood, may carry the unskilful boatman
into danger. It is on the Tarwin, in the eastern bight of Ander-
son’s Inlet, that the great scrub country and the really rich
lands on this line begin. But before reaching Tarwin or Nyora,
about Korumburra, indeed some picturesque mountain scenery is
passed, and that great coal country traversed, in which we expect
some day to establish our Newcastle, with a port equal to Cardiff,


maybe, at Anderson’s Inlet. We know not yet what to expect
from the coal prospects of this country. Is it brown coal, and if
brown coal, can it be made into briquettes such as can be used,
and will pay for the making ? Coal there is in this country, in
quantities which would mock all attempts to exhaust them.
Coal in seams from eighteen inches to one hundred feet in
thickness. Accessible to the railway lines, not more than seventy
miles from the metropolis, and within a very easy distance of
what might be made good shipping ports. It is indeed a very
great railway question, this of the coal, and by no means yet
decided. It is not a question of cheap fuel, or even a question
of available fuel. Should any strike in New South Wales cut off
our supplies, or should we in any way come to such a condition
of quarrel with that colony as to render commerce with coal, as
with any other commodity, impossible, if good coal can be
obtained from off those Gippsland lines, or if the brown coal can
be so dealt with as to render good and cheap fuel available, then
the traffic will straightway become so great as to make the
Gippsland railways the best paying, perhaps, of all our country
lines. The Government did well in despatching Mr. Cosmo
Newbery to Europe to collect all possible information on this subject,
and the report which he was enabled to make encourages us to
hope that even from briquettes we may obtain a very useful and
payable article of commerce. Those who really desire to learn
or to understand from personal investigation the actual resources
and prospects of our coal country, could not possibly do better
than camp for a while at the little railway township of Korum-
burra, whence all the developed and prospected seams are readily
accessible.
It is at the Tarwin, however, that the Great Southern
line strikes the country in which we have the most immediate
hope. There is the rich land again, the fat pastures, the
fabulously rich clover flats whereon sheep are crowded through
spring and summer months, as if. to fold rather than to feed, and
yet they contrive to fatten, so marvellously rapid is the growth.
Settlers by the score have settled on or about the Tarwin, and
there goes on the work already described, of scrub-cutting,


burning, clearing, and grass-sowing, and undoubtedly the next
decade will see clusters of prosperous homes and thriving town-
ships frequent as on the elder land which, ten years ago, coupled
Melbourne with Sale. All along this line, we take it, dairy
farming will marvellously develop, for here, be it remembered,
irrigation is by no means necessary. The climate is moist as
that of England, and genial all the year round. Lucerne will
grow well in the summer, and clover, and rye and cocksfoot and
prairie keep green and growing the year through. No housing
of cattle is required, and very little winter feeding either of hay
or of ensilage. Indeed, we take it, that the perfection now-
reached in the manufacture and carriage of dairy products, and
the means made available to all Victorian farmers, those lucky
folks who manage to secure this country and hold and develop it
with perseverance, industry, and enterprise, will, as farmers in the
next decade, have the whole world handicapped. It is scarcely
necessary to say that the bulk of this country is already taken up.
Some of it has already changed hands, for, too frequently, the
selecting pioneers in Victoria look rather to the immediate profit
of the land-shark than to permanent endowment of settled in-
dustry. By Leongatha, the line runs dow-n south-west, till it
strikes the Hoddle Range beyond Fish Creek, and makes then
on a course generally parallel with the coast line, to Port Albert
on the sea, fairly at the entrance of the great Corner Inlet. Now
all this country is of a special interest. Foster may be taken as
the first of the inlet stations. Round about Foster, on every hand
lies a good country, and from Foster the road runs down to the
coast where there is a township called Bowen. The Franklin
River enters it a little later on. At the Albert, and Stony Creek,
and at Foster, and Welshpool, and Port Albert, and Tarraville,
townships are rapidly growfing, fed by a double source of pros-
perity, the sea and the shore. And fishermen and fish consumers
knowing anything of the resources of our coastal inlets, have long
desired that these wide waters of Corner Inlet should be open
for the nets of the craft, but it was not until the richer and
more permanent resources of the country had been made accessible
that railway construction could be justified. One train will bring


into town very many baskets of fish ; and, indeed, the fishing
business is so fluctuating, and in any one locality so frequently
altogether suspended by rough weather, that train service for it
solely would certainly become a permanent national loss. But, as
old settlers know, far and near around the Inlet is good
agricultural and rich pastoral land. In the old days cattle boats
innumerable left here, carrying supplies to tens of thousands of
diggers who went away in the early sixties to the inhospitable
grandeur of the west coast of New Zealand. Small settlers were
in no hurry to choose this locality, because their commodities did
not find a very ready market, and occasional searches after gold did
not result in any large or prominent find. It was frequently said,
and it is still hoped, that an outcrop of the famous Long Tunnel
Reef of Walhalla, would be discovered here, but so far that hope
has not been realised.
Forests there are in plenty, scrub land by the square mile.
Farms enough there will be ere may years have passed,
and the fishing industry, though now at its earliest
beginning, has already assumed very considerable proportions.
We shall look, by-and-bye, to Corner Inlet for our chief supply of
fish. It seems to afford all the conditions which every class of
fishermen requires. In the shallow waters, and over the almost
limitless mud flats, the flounders find a congenial habitat and
magnificent feeding grounds. Sandy beaches and shores by the
mile suit the grey mullet and whiting. Pike and barracouta
feed and breed in innumerable bays and bights, going out by the
tide to sea, and returning according to the season. Very
convenient is Corner Inlet also for any bold fishermen who may
contemplate fitting up crafts for real deep-sea fishing, and bringing
in to us those wholesale supplies of schnapper and trumpeter
which might so easily be obtained within hundreds of miles of our
own coast in the prolific waters of the Straits, or on the Tasmanian
shores but a day’s steam away. It is almost a matter of national
disgrace to us that we have so far done so little to gather the
harvest of the seas. We have paddled about in easy waters, we


have destroyed breeding grounds, vve have driven the good fish
away from their customary locations, and yet we have never gone
out to tackle the main crop of the great fish, which is only
accessible in bold water.
With the completion of these two lines, the one to
the Gippsland Lakes, the other to Corner Inlet, it was
hoped, and indeed expected, that fishing would be carried on in
better style; but that hope is not in a fair way of being realised.
The fisher folk are a good deal like the farmer folk. All that can
be done for them is done by railway enterprise, but still they do
not develop according to the opportunities afforded to them. To
obtain an adequate fish supply at Melbourne, it will be necessary
for private enterprise on bold, though by no means original,
lines —for fishing is a big business in every part of the world but
Australia —to subscribe and to embark capital sufficient to
build ships which will weather out all gales, and bring all cargoes
safe to port; to provide the latest and best appliances for deep-sea
fishing, and to pay adequate wages to plucky and experienced
men. When this is done, fish traffic, both from the lakes and
Corner Inlet, ought to largely supplement the railway revenues.
But at Corner Inlet, which must generally be regarded as the
terminus of this line, there are other interests quite apart from
fishing, which, by-and-bye, will do much to justify the construction
of the railway. Agriculture, as we have said, must always increase
and continue prosperous. Then also Corner Inlet is one of the best
tourist resorts we know. Just a few enterprising men know it well.
One or two of our leading barristers go down there regularly, and
yacht, and fish, and shoot, finding a haven of rest for a term from
all city cares such as no other marine resort affords. This
isolation must necessarily be broken through, now that the
railways touch there ; but still there is a vast area of wild country
round about the Inlet. There is also a great reserve, which it is
proposed, wisely and well, to retain in perpetuity as an asylum
and home for Australia’s native fauna. The bulk of the peninsula,
that is to say, all lying south of a line struck from Rabbit Island
across the mainland to Shoalback Island, is rugged and wild, and
worthless for agriculture or pasturage, and this it is proposed to


dedicate to all those wild creatures of Australia, which we are so
rapidly killing out, and which, in the absence of asylums and
breeding grounds being provided, will very shortly be exterminated.
Many a thousand acres of land lie there, heath or
scrub-covered, with patches of grass about little bays and
river banks, with rivers and brooks tumbling down to the
ocean, with miniature tarns and lagoons, where all manner of
wild fowl can breed ; with strange flowers, strange shrubs, in fact,
all in all, a patch of wild and original Australia, which we should
do very well to conserve as it is. The lighthouse, of course, at
the Cape—the southernmost cape of all Australia—will always be
maintained, and the road right up to Cape and Peninsula to
the railway line. But, beyond that, it would be very well that all
that area should be for ever maintained as a great reserve for
native game.
On the near shores of the Inlet, however, there is a
glorious country, w r hich will one day be as dear to Melbourne as
any length of the Devonshire coast is to London. From Mount
Singapore, the Cape at the southern entrance to the Inlet, right
round about a deep bight, is a coast of many miles in length,
which has a glorious silvery beach, sheltered against all winds,
shelving gently to deep water, made and ordained by nature as a
pastime place and playground for a great city; and back from the
beach the land slopes gently, beautifully grassed, lightly timbered,
with mountains behind, from whose summit all the ocean and
many leagues of the inland, may always be commanded. The
land about this bay has already been surveyed as a township, and
some time, doubtless, it will be sold and occupied, and many
thousands of travellers will go down to Foster or Port Albert, and
run across by boat for their weekly or summer holiday.
The locality is unknown as yet, save, as we have said, to a few
adventurous spirits, but really it is just as accessible as Lome, and
at some future date will become just as popular. And can we
not easily imagine, when once a tolerable population is established
about the Inlet, fishing and tourist trips in all fine weather out
and about that strange chain of islands, which geologists and men
of science tell us mark the crests of what was once the connecting


range between Australia and that outermost cape of Tasmania ?
It is altogether a wild, strange country, picturesque in the heights,
broad and free and beautiful in the greater breadth of the bay,
dreary in the extreme on the low, flat, sedgy islands, and yet
possessed of a sentiment which charms the wanderer and rests
the weary man, and in days to come will surely be most eagerly
sought after.
Of Port Albert there is not much to be said at present.
It had its day in the time of the shipping of the cattle
to New Zealand, and it will have another day, as it has already
seen another dawn far brighter and broader and more prosperous
than that. But that this may be, it is well, it is even necessary
that the opportunities, the delights, the advantages of the place
should even somewhat noisily be trumpeted abroad. Nine
hundred and ninety-nine per cent, of the people of Melbourne
know very little of this South Gippsland country, which lies
practically at their doors, which craves for labour, industry,
enterprise and capital—which can afford relaxation to mind-weary
men and labour to all who are willing yet find lack of employment.
Our territory, we know, is not broad. We have not the millions and
tens of millions of square miles which our sister colonies boast, but
did we but utilise it aright, did private enterprise but follow on
the public spirit which drives railways through these jungles and
wildernesses, we have a territory capable of supporting a population
equal to that of England, and keeping, as it might and should
do, the first place in Australia.
