exactly two thousand years old. Even for a goblin, this —/
<ms y t<A/Ji is a great old age. f 1 l/°\
''' \ Misty got his name because his eyes are kind and a
soft misty blue, and his little house is always in the j j r

Fairies love to visit him because he makes delicious .XpJ/

The Fairy you can see in the P icture 1S a good

sometimes as a very special treat she is allowed to dance
on the rainbow wearing the tiny golden slippers. How
\ lovely she looks when she dances in them, as her eyes /7 V\
and hair are honey gold. 11 lj ~)
All the other fairies look on and wish they could
dance only half as sweetly as Gillian, for that is her
name.

And now, to-day, every fairy is puzzling her brains
to find a present which she thinks Misty will like the
best of all. It isn't easy, as the stall holders bang on
gongs and yell at the top of their voices to attract
attention.
Gillian is quite puzzled by all the noise. She wonders
whether to choose a present that is beautiful, or one
suitable for a very, very old goblin. Here is her list of
things that she will try and choose from: —
1. Two Thistledown Blankets
2. One Robin Red Leather Jacket
3. One Golden Ring set with rainbow coloured
jewels
4. A silkworm spun Bed Jacket of brightest
yellow
5. A Bed Cover made of white owls 1 feathers
6. A flagon of Mountain Berry Wine, and
7. One yard of little fat Sausages.
(Misty loves sausages.)
Sitting down on a nearby mushroom, Gillian
looked at this list carefully, and happening to see Long
Tom, a goblin friend of Misty's, walking by, she called
him, and asked him to help her choose a present for
Misty.
Long Tom read Gillian's list, slowly stroking his W
long nose and shaking his head at each item. Nay,
L;\ little one," he said, "Wait here a while. 1 know of /^VuW
A something Misty would just love to comfort his old
B bones," and off Long Tom went.

7 She climbed up quickly, pricking her little hands 0 /,
and knees in doing so. Gently unhooking the frightened \(jf r
little man, she helped him down to the ground, where ) 'y,J
he sat holding his aching head. \
Laelie brought him water to drink and soon he was
feeling well enough to go on with his work. He had
been gathering rose petals to make into a gown for the
fairy Patricia to wear at the Royal Ball. When he
arrived back at his workshop it was late. He had been
hanging on the tree for a long time.
His little wife told him that Fairy Patricia had gone
to buy a dress at the Pixie Salon, and had waited for
him for over three hours. Poor Mr. Pintuck! How sad
he was. He had wanted to see a gown he had made
with his own hands at the Royal Rail.
Suddenly, he thought of Laelie, who had helped him
and been so kind, and he rushed to the nutshell house,
and offered to make a dress for her to wear at the Ball.
How pleased she was at the kind offer made to her,
and how delighted her father was that the handsome
Prince should see his beautiful Laelie. Then followed
a rush for pins, scissors, tape measure, needles and
thread, and then the gown had to be tried on.
While this was going on Mrs. Pintuck took Laelie
to the cobblers and bought her a pair of pale pink satin

There were lovely yellow primroses and starry
white and purple violets growing in the heart of the
wood, amidst the tiny baby ferns, peeping here and
there from the carpet of bluebells, stretching under the
trees in all directions.
In no time Dorothy had picked a lovely big
bunch, and bound it round with fern fronds.
Thinking she would rest a while, she sat down on a
mossy bank close to a shady stream. Birds sang in the
leaves overhead; the wood was quiet and beautiful.
Suddenly a most amazing thing happened; all the
bluebells round about started to ring! They played ,
such a merry lilting tune, and the tall stately pink
foxgloves chimed in with their deeper notes. \
This must have been the signal for the fun to %
begin, as there were excited squeaks and giggles coming
from a clump of bracken nearby, and tiny voices could
be heard hailing one another.
Then Dorothy saw something moving very quickly






the rustling bracken out popped a
\ wl|)/y white rabbit. Such a handsome white rabbit, dressed
v V\ in P a^e satin ' proudly carrying a magnificent hv
Wedding Cake. jj
He was followed by hundreds of the woodland \i r~t
» /j C* furry folk, squirrels, field mice, rabbits and moles and vf VS^trT
U , / jv many of the little folk. There were fairies, pixies, \) \( \V
goblins and elves, all laughing so happily together as y\
\ \i they trotted down the woodland path after the white / A? \ S /'

: /\ t^ie primroses and violets so that not a petal was v « /
I \ J / bruised or hurt, until they came to a clearing, and the p
| S J / j bluebells stopped ringing. 1
|l /j/\l All was so quiet and still. A speckled thrush piped \ J \
/ /•LkX three sweet, clear, notes, and immediately bluebells +
\\ I 2 parted across the clearing, forming an archway overhead, T + //
\y j an d the woodland furry creatures and all the little folk v\ j

fields she gave two rice cakes, and to each baby a jar of

Soon her baskets were empty and her servants were
bidden to return. When passing through the village
Wing Lo noticed some washing hanging out to dry
from a window in a house at the top of a flight of steps.
The breeze billowed out the garments, causing
them to dance in the air as though they were alive.

in glee. Unfortunately, the washing belonged to Hoo

jj Magic Flowers are grown by the fairies, and are

knew it must be the fairies because I would find
P art °f a broken fairy's wing or a tiny, tiny jewelled
Q slipper one day, and several days later a little jaunty
goblin cap; or perhaps a wisp of gossamer lace would
M be caught on the petals of a rock rose. I was very
'/hr\ happy to think that the fairies had come to live in my
In garden, and so I had to be careful where I stepped. /
b Wel b one lovely afternoon, I had gone to gather °*\
dead flowers and pull out weeds in the rock garden, Y ~
and not thinking of what I was doing, I threw down a . \
clump of weeds which landed right on top of a V
handsome green lizard, who was taking an old gentleman A
\oy i or a ride ' 1 ' dear '- f bad bowled them both
completely over. What a noise they made and how the


° oTlf • c X3
R § ent^eman scolded me. I was dreadfully sorry, and
/ told them so, as I helped them out from under the weeds. Z^*'
I Brushing the old gentleman down, I assured him \^L^-
. U \lf that he had no bones broken, and picking up his hat I
l \\ L put it on his little bald head. Next, I turned to help /kjo^-^V?
|\\W l/j the lizard, and on brushing him down was shocked when j J I /Q\
W\ I came to where his tail should have been; it simply was \
lir n0t tbere ' * n fright the poor lizard had lost it! /^i-
As I watched the old gentleman drag his beautiful
green tail out from under the weeds, I felt most clumsy

seen dancin g Wlth a lizard with only a stump for a tail.
/ |)Ar/ Sadly we all sat down and wondered what would be the
best thing to do.

The pixie lady had just finished bathing her baby
in a silver thimble that Dale s Mother had lost weeks
ago. When Dale and the bumblebee came to the door
she placed the baby in a walnut shell and invited them
to afternoon tea she was such a pretty pixie with a
red and white spotted dress, and a yellow handkerchief
tied round her hair.
Dale was quite sorry when the bumblebee said they
must go and gave the baby a chocolate out of his
pocket.
You will like the house I am now going to show
you the best of all, the bumblebee said.
Dale had to agree with him. It is the house you
can see in the picture, and is cunningly made out of
vine leaves. The pixies find the grapes very handy to

apricot tinted rose petals, and an eggcup made a
delightful bath; their beds were slung aloft in cobweb
hammocks, and were very comfortable.
A baker called with loaves of bread just as they
were leaving he left three large loaves, for quite a
large family lived there.
They all waved good'bye to Dale and the
bumblebee as they flew by .on their way home. On
their return, the fairy gave Dale a tablet to swallow,
which made him grow to his usual size.
Now the bumblebee has flown away, but Dale is
quite happy, knowing that the fairies are living in his
own garden, and that the bumblebee has promised to
take him some day to visit them all once again.

(( o In the grounds of the Royal Palace in Fairyland is \Mi*^
\ O 0 a beautiful water lily pond with a white marble rim \J!ffl "0^
) Q_ Floating on the surface are large pink, white and yellow
\ QG water lilies, with big flat green leaves, larger than fairy
! table tops. ~~
( ! The Royal children had been told it was dangerous
c '( to play amongst the lilies, in case they should fall in the \ •
\ I !' water, but I am afraid they sometimes did when their
I \\oV I nurse was not looking, as they thought it was such great
( I fun to play hide and seek amongst the flowers. There
' / were so many of them they took such a lot of finding. //
w Petal was the name of the youngest of the children o\
°f the Fairy Queen, and was tiny and sweet, with
V ' I forget-memot blue eyes and golden curls. Although not
quite two years old, Petal had crept into everyone's
hv ' heart with her lovable little ways. \
/ " One lovely summer day, Petal was playing in the \\
—- —-y garden near the lily pond, and seeing her nurse had JrLi\.
/S fallen asleep underneath a lovely red rose, Petal thought /
/V she, too, would go and play amongst the water lilies. {1LJ ?**•>-
/r j So off she toddled on her little fat legs, unsteadily
0 [l 1 ' stepping from one water lily leaf to the other. She had
o\ <' ' just stepped on to a rather wobbly one when a frog {
Jj C popped up from underneath it, causing Petal to lose her
0 balance, and fall with a large splash into the water.


A water rat who was swimming nearby nibbling
/[ water lily buds, heard the loud splash and saw Petal
\l ° sinking down deeper and deeper into the water.
j) Trembling with fear for her safety, he hastily tore •
(/ off his jacket and kicking off his old red slippers, he
u © " dived in where Petal had disappeared.
j j Down, and down he went, swimming faster and
'off faster. Twice he stretched down and nearly reached 1
§" her, and twice he missed. Again he reached and this jU/f
I time just managed to grasp the blue ribbon tied around
Petal's waist.
!, /, Skilfully he turned and holding the ribbon in his //
v \t\'' teet h, swam with her to the surface and gently lifted o\
' * tbe bab y Princess on to a water lily leaf, where anxious
\. hands quickly carried her to the safety of the marble rim.
Petal's nurse was found sleeping under the rose. W
V v She woke and learnt of Petal's accident. Hastily, she V\
/ " sent for the Royal nurse and the rabbit Keeper of pills \
and potions.
// Quickly they set to work to revive Petal and |jn
/A i anxiously everyone hovered round to wait for the first
off i fluttering of her eyelids.
0 \ , i The Fairy Queen was just in time to hold her baby
- \o tight in her arms and see her open her eyes, and soon
\( j) she was quite recovered, and smiling happily at everyone «

but was no longer afraid because the Queen of the -
