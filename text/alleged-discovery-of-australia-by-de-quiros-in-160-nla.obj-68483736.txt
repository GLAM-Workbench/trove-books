ALLEGED DISCOVERY OF AUSTRALIA BY DE QUIROS IN
1606?A REPLY TO CARDINAL MORAN?S
SECOND PAMPHLET.
A. C. Macdonald, F.R.G.S.
Read before the Royal Geographical Society, Melbourne, April 23, 1909.
Members of this Society no doubt remember that a long con-
troversy resulted, as far back as the year 1901, in consequence
of a theory put forward by His Eminence Cardinal Moran, of
Sydney, claiming that Australia was discovered by the Portu-
guese navigator, Ferdinand de Quiros, and that he landed at
Port Curtis, on the Queensland coast, on the Ist of May, 1606.
The Cardinal?s theory was first broached in his ? History of
the Catholic Church in Australia,? published some years pre-
viously, and, on the occasion of the consecration of the Roman
Catholic Cathedral, Rockhampton, in October, 1899, the Car-
dinal, ? accompanied by a large number of Bishops, prelates and
other devoted priests and members of the denomination, went
to Gladstone (Port Curtis) to view,? so it was seriously alleged,
? the very spot where de Quiros landed, and where the first mass
was celebrated by a Franciscan Friar on Australian soil, nearly
300 years before.?
His Eminence was presented on the occasion with an address,
part of which was quoted by me during a discussion that followed
the reading of a paper contributed by the late Mr. George
Gordon, F.R.G.S., on the 29th August, 1901, published in the
nineteenth volume of the Transactions of this Society, pages 31-
39-
Such a startling deviation from settled history and geographical
discovery, and so utterly opposed to fact, was called attention
to almost simultaneously in the press of ,New South Wales and
Queensland by the late Judge Macfarland, Captain W. C. Thom-
son and myself, and on the 9th May, 1900, the late Theodore
F. Bevan, F.R.G.S., an explorer and traveller in New Guinea
and the Pacific Islands (including the New Hebrides Group),
read a paper before this Society, which was followed by a long
discussion, both for and against the Cardinal?s theory.*
On the 3rd December following, Mr. Gordon contributed a
second paper on the subject, followed by papers and discussions
by Messrs. J. A. Panton, C.M.G., Captain W. C. Thomson, the
*Society?s Transactions, vol. 18, p.p. 7-20.


late Alexander Sutherland, M.A., the late Mr J. J.Shillinglaw,
Mr. W. H. D. Le Souef and myself.
On the ist of May, 1901, Cardinal Moran published a pamphlet
of 32 pages, entitled ? Was Australia Discovered by de Quiros
in 1606?? In the short preface, His Eminence adversely criti-
cised (with one single exception) the opinions expressed ?by
the authors of the papers referred to, as well as of those who
had taken part in discussing them," with some additional re-
marks.
At a meeting of the Society held 29th August, 19ï¿½!) the late
Mr. Shillinglaw, F.R.G.S., suggested ?that copies of all the
papers read bearing on the subject of de Quiros alleged dis-
covery, together with reports of discussions thereon, and also
a copy of the Cardinal?s pamphlet, be forwarded to the President
of the Royal Geographical Society of England, with a request
that a committee be appointed to consider and report thereon.
In compliance with that request, the following gentlemen were
appointed, namely, Sir Clements R. Markham, K.C.8., F.R.G.S.
(President of the Hakluyt Society), Admiral Sir W. J. L.
Wharton, K.C.B. (Hydrographer to the Admiralty), Admiral
Sir Richard Tracey, K.C.8., and William Foster, Esq., late Sec-
retary to the Hakluyt Society.
The report of that Committee, occupying seven pages of the
? Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of England ? (July,
1902), second paragraph, is as follows: ??The hypothesis that
the Bay of San Felipe and Santiago of Quiros can be identified
with Port Curtis, or any other bay on the Australian coast, is
entirely incompatible with the accounts of the voyage. Putting
on one side for the moment the disagreement of the description
given, both of the land and the natives, it would be necessary
to assume not only that the latitude of Espiritu Santo* was falsi-
fied, but that every latitude, every course steered and every detail
given of the whole voyage was also falsified. This would not
only 'be an astounding assumption, as the various accounts agree
very nearly with one another in all importaq|; details, with just
as much difference as affords evidence and truth, but would
make it hopeless to attempt to identify anything; whereas, by
following the description given by the two sailors, de Quiros and
Torres, leaders of the expedition (and also by the chief pilot),
every island seen or visited can be perfectly and satisfactorily
determined.?
The report includes an elaborate table of the courses and lati-
*New Hebrides.


hides of the voyage, from the start (Lima), on the 21st Decem-
ber, 1605, to the finish, on the 28th June, 1606.
In the journal of the Home Society (Vol. XIX., 1902), the
following article appeared;?
? The novel theory stated by Cardinal Moran a year or two
ago, that the Continent of Australia was discovered by de Quiros
in 1606, still excites interest among geographical circles in that
country,* and continues to be warmly debated We have re-
ceived a pamphlet, presented in May last to the Geographical
Society of Australasia, in which the Cardinal endeavours to
answer the objections of his critics, without, however, adducing
any new arguments of importance to support his hypothesis.
? Two points only need be alluded to, as indicating the insecure
nature of the grounds on which the new theory rests. When
sailing from the Bay of St. Phillip and St. Janies, in the land
of del Espiritu Santo, after the departure of de Quiros, Torres
first coasted along the western shores of the newly discovered
land (proving it to be an island). Then he held a south-west
course until a certain latitude was reached without gaining sight
of land, and finally turned north-north-west, by which course
New Guinea was in time reached. This fits in perfectly with
the supposition that the Bay of St. Phillip and St. James was
in the Island of Santo, but is, of course, utterly at variance with
the idea that the starting point was from Port Curtis, on the
Queensland coast.? (Yet Cardinal Moran considers ? that all
this fits in very well with the supposition that he has made
regarding Port Curtis).
? In order to reach this result, he has to make the gratuitous
assumption (which still removes only part of the difficulty)
that before sailing south-west Torres stood out to sea from some
point near the New South Wales frontier.
? The second point above referred to is the fact that in the
manuscript map made by Don Diego de Prado (one of de Quiros?
officers), reproduced by Mr. George Collingridge in his ?Dis-
covery of Australia,? we have a drawing of the Bay of St.
Phillip and St. James which, both in orientation and topographical
details, shows the closest agreement with the bay on the north
side of Santo, as drawn in the latest hydrographic charts. This
should sure'ly be sufficient in itself to settle the question.?
So milch for the Committee?s report.
It was thought that the decision of such eminent geographers
would have settled the question for all time, but the saying holds
* Australia,


good that ? Sometimes an exploded theory does not wake up the
theoristfor the Cardinal, who has been furnished by this
Society with copies of all papers, reports of all discussions, to-
gether with a copy of the Home Committee?s finding, from which
I have quoted, has recently published a second pamphlet of 32
pages, in which he insists that his version of the discovery of
Australia by de Quiros, and of his landing at Port Curtis, is
absolutely correct, and that all who have expressed contrary
opinions are absolutely wrong.
His Eminence quotes at length the description given by de
Quiros? narrative, in which it is represented ? that the houses
of the natives are of wood, roofed with palm leaves?that they
use pots of clay, weave cloths, make flutes, drums, spoons of
varnished wood; bread from three kinds of roots, which grow
in great abundance and without labour, only requiring to be dug
up and cooked, pleasant to the taste, etc.; that these roots are
a yard long, and half a yard thick; that there are bananas of
six kinds, great obos of the size and taste of peaches, oranges,
lemons and other great fruits, many large sweet canes, silver,
gold and pearls; that they have goats and pigs, and that there
were indications of cows (for which latter the Cardinal thinks
kangaroos were probably mistaken) ; murmuring streams and
springs, where might have been erected any number of wind
and water mills, sugar mills and other water engines, salt pits
and sugar plantations. The Bay,? he adds, ? contains twenty
leagues (60 miles) of shore, quite limpid, and is free to enter
by day or night?that it is surrounded with a large population,
and so capacious that it would contain at anchor 1000 ships with
four to four and a half fathoms? anchorage,? etc.
Then follows a description of two splendid rivers,* ? one of
them (the Jordan) as large as the Guadalquiver, in Seville, with
a bar of more than two fathoms; that our barques entered the
other freely,? and so on.
In his memorial to the King, de Quiros expressed the wish
? that this land be added to the Royal realms, with the grand
title of ? Austrialia del Espiritu Santo, f If we look,? says
de Quiros, ? round the coast of Spain so good a port will not
be found.?
The Cardinal then quotes de Torres? description of the Bay:?
* Page 4 Cardinal?s Pamphlet No. 57.
t De Quiros refers in his journal to taking possession on the 14th May,
1606, of the whole of the lands seen or to be seen as far as the South Pole,
which were to he called Austrialia del Espiritu Santo. The word was not
Australia, for he says ? for the happy memory of your majesty and for the
sake of the name of Austria I have called it.?

? This Bay," writes Torres, ? is very refreshing, and in it fall
many and large rivers. In circuit it is 25 We
named it the ?Bay de San Felipe y Santiago,? and the land?
(that is the island) ?that of ? Espiritu Santo.? At length we
sailed from this bay in conformity to the order, although with
intention of sailing round this island, but the season and the
strong currents would not allow this, although I ran along a
great part of it. All this did not prevent me reaching the men-
tioned latitude, 20 0 south, going into the said latitude on a
south-west course.?
The map shows that Torres, after leaving the Bay of Santo,
sailed along part of the western shore of the Island of Santo,
and thence on a south-west course to latitude 20ï¿½ 30' south, to
a point about 3 0 west of the western end of New Caledonia.
" From thence,? writes Torres, ? I stood back to the north-
west, to 11 0 30' south latitude. There we fell in with the begin-
ning of New Guinea. I could not weather the east point, so
1 coasted along to the westward on the south side,* thence on to
Manila? (where Torres died).
The Cardinal admits ? that the map of Prado y Tobar repre-
sents the Island of Santo.? He also admits ? that Prado was
a member of de Quiros? expedition.? Two letters of Prado y
l obar are published in Sir Clement Markham?s translation of
de Quiros' voyage. They accompanied the map, ?on which,?
says the Cardinal, ?my critics now rely. In these letters Prado
calls de Quiros an impostor, a liar and a fraud, who discovered
nothing but some reefs and small islands, and who should be
wholly discredited in the statements of his memorials and in his
pretence of having found The Great Austral Land.? ? The map
which he forwards is part and parcel,? says the Cardinal, ?of
this attempt to discredit de Quiros.?
The Cardinal, I think, gives himself away when he says in
his pamphlet (page 20) : ?It has been remarked that some of
the products commemorated by de Quiros, when he speaks of
the yams, oranges, limes, paupaus, almonds, nutmegs, mace, gin-
ger and pepper, are not indigenous to the Queensland coast. We
must bear in mind, however, he adds, ? that de Quiros refers to
these products of the various islands and other lands which he
had discovered, and not as characteristic of the territory around
the harbour of Vera Cruz (Port Curtis).* De Quiros?
+ In another report it is given as 27 leagues.'
* Through what is now known as Torres Strait.
* The Cardinal?s first pamphlet, published in May, 1901, p. 7, gives a
description ot the native products, fruit, etc., all indigenous to the Port
Curtis district, and nowhere else.


description of the natives is,? the Cardinal continues,
? that they are of various colours ?white, yellow, mulatoes
and black, and mixtures of each; their arms are bows
and arrows, wooden swords, etc.; the country very prosperous,
and, although the people were dark, they were well favoured.?
During my residence (considerably more than 75 years) in
Australia and frequent visits to Queensland, and travels extend-
ing over 850 miles from east to west, and 1300 miles from south
to north, I have not had the good fortune to 'meet with any of
these van-coloured or white, well-formed aborigines; nor have
I ever seen a native armed with a bow and arrows. Possibly
the white variety said to have been discovered by de Quiros have
died out during the last 300 years?or dyed black by the tropical
climate of Northern Australia.
Captain Flinders, who stayed at Port Curtis more than 100
years ago, and had a botanist with him, found none of the fruits
or fruit-bearing trees there; neither did he see any such weapons
as bows and arrows in the hands of any Australian aboriginal.
When the Cardinal's second pamphlet (No. 57, 1908) came
under my notice in May last (1908), I secured several copies, and
sent a copy to gentlemen whom 1 considered leading geographers,
accompanied by a request to read the pamphlet carefully and
then favour me with an unbiassed opinion as to the merits or
otherwise of the author?s theory.
The first reply in point of importance that has come to hand
is from the President of the Hakluyt Society (Sir Clements R.
Markham, K.C.8.), to whose translation of de Quiros? three
volumes*] have already referred. The letter is as follows:
20 Eccleston Square, London,
A. C. Macdonald, Esq. 30th June, 1908.
Dear Sir, ?1 have read the Cardinal Archbishop?s pamphlet,
maintaining that de Quiros landed at Port Curtis, which accom-
panied your letter.
His Eminence, at page 29, says ? that he is not concerned with
the details of the voyage of de Quiros.? Yet the details of the
voyage finally settle the whole question. He also ignores the
latitude given by de Quiros, Saga and Torres of the Bay of San
Felipe and Santiago, on ? the ground that Spaniards kept their
reports secret.? Certainly they did, but it does not follow that
they gave fictitious latitudes in their secret reports. It is quite
certain de Quiros did not. He gave the latitudes as accurately
as the faulty instruments of those days enabled him to do, and
in some instances they are remarkably accurate.

The latitudes harmonise in a remarkable degree with the
courses and distances, which proves their value. Only to follow
these observations from' ? Tuamaco, which de Quiros left on
the 18th April to the ist May, when he arrived in the Bay of
San Felipe and Santiago, the conclusion must be that the Bay is
in 15 0 10" south; so this is a fixed departure which cannot be
disputed. ?We left it,? he says, ?on the 18th April.?
On the 22nd he was off another island he gives the native
name of ? Tucopia,? and the correct latitude as 12 0 15' south, so
this is another fixed position, which cannot be disputed, with
a date.
On the 25th Quiros was off another island with a remarkable
peak (the modern ? Star Peak? on our maps), identified by his
latitude, 14 0 40" south.
From ? Star Peak ? Quiros steered west to a lofty island,
which he named ? Santa Maria ? (the modern ? Gauar ?), where
he was for two days.
Leaving Santa Maria, Quiros, in a day and a half, came to a
large bay on the ist May, which he named the ? Bay of Sanitago
and St. Felipe,? in 15 0 10' south, the latitude of the Bay in the
?Island of Espiritu Santo? (New Hebrides Group).
The details of the voyage, from 18th April to ist May, from
the latitude 15ï¿½ 10' south (or 15 0 15' given to the bay reached
on ist May) is correct, and that it is absolutely impossible that
Quiros could have reached Port Curtis, or any other part of
Australia on the ist May, 1606.
These details of the voyage from the 18th April to ist May
settle the question beyond reasonable dispute.
Ever yours faithfully,
CLEMENTS R. MARKHAM.
This letter alone is, in my opinion, sufficient to put Cardinal
Moran?s claim out of court.
Mr. George Collingridge,* a Spanish scholar, as well as a
master of other languages, an acknowledged authority on matters
geographical, who has given many years? study to this as well
as other discoveries in the Pacific and elsewhere, writes as
follows: Hnrnshv. New South Wales.
Hornsby, New South Wales,
19th July, 1908.
Dear Macdonald, ?I am sending a few notes on the de Quiros
? Land Fall ? in the year 1606.
No argument had ever been brought forth to attempt to
prove that the harbour where Columbus cast anchor was actually
* Author of ?The Discovery of Australia? (1895)


situated on the American continent, whereas it has been con-
tended that de Quires? Land Fall, and the harbour where he
cast anchor, and which has been so characteristically and minutely
described by his secretary, who was with him in that very har-
bour, is situated on the Queensland coast.
No voyage in ancient or modern times is so accurately de-
scribed and with such an accumulation of absolute and circum-
stantial evidence as de Quiros? voyage in 1606 and 1607.
The date of his departure from the ? Big Bay ? is given, the
course he followed before his landing took place, with the names
of the various islands he came across in close proximity to the
? Big Bay ? of Santo; all this, and more, is recorded, every item
of which information refers absolutely to the New Hebrides
and no other place.
When, after his sojourn in the Bay of Santo, he tells us of his
departure from there, of his attempt to put in at the rendezvous
in Granosa Bay (to the west of Santo), of the impossibility,
owing to contrary winds and currents, to make a westing, of his
decision to steer east and reach New Spain, of his sailing to those
parts and subsequent return to Spain.
Now, in the face of these statements, how is it possible to
maintain that he did no such thing, and that the whole thing
is a myth? De Quiros sailed on an easterly course after leaving
Santo, or he would never have arrived in Spain as early as he
did. The thing is too utterly absurd.
Yours very truly,
GEORGE COLLINGRIDGE.
A. C. Macdonald, Melbourne.
The Honorary Secretary of the Queensland branch of the
Royal Geographical Society, Dr. J. P. Thomson, LL.D., writes: ?
A. C. Macdonald, Esq. Brisbane, nth June, 1908.
Dear Sir, ?I have delayed an acknowledgment of your letter
of the 23rd ultimo, in which you invite me to write a paper
(or express an opinion) on Cardinal Moran?s theory concerning
the discoveries of de Quiros, in the hope that a favourable
opportunity might have presented itself for me to comply with
your request. Sorely tempted as lam to refute or challenge the
views expressed in the pamphlet which you were good enough
to send me, I am yet unable to take up the subject in any way,
as my time at present is more than fully occupied.
It is an easy matter to brush aside the Cardinal?s theory. There
is absolutely nothing in it. There is no bay at Port Curtis at all,


in a geographical sense, and everything advanced in favour of
the new theory is really against it, to those who know the actual
local conditions of both places. . . .
Yours sincerely, j p THOMSON.
A life member* of the Royal Geographical Society of Australa
sia. resident in Scotland, writes as follows: ?
Kinnaird Castle, Scotland,
14th October, 1903.
Dear Mr. Macdonald, ?I was immensely interested in the
volume of the Geographical Society you sent me. I read every
word of the papers and discussions in connection with the alleged
discovery of Australia by de Quiros. My opinion, of course, has
no intrinsic value; but, at the same time, ? how it strikes ? the lay
mind, so to speak, may interest and amuse you to hear. I can only
say that I do not think that the Cardinal has a leg to stand on.
The only arguments he brings to bear are founded on perfectly
groundless assumptions, to my mind; for I cannot see that there
is the least probability that, in this one particular case, de Quiros
should have utterly falsified his record of positions. The whole
thing only shows how much words can do when the mind is
bent on proving what it wishes to prove, for I will say for the
Cardinal and his supporters that if their statement of the case
is read without hearing the opposite side that it sounds very
plausible. But, when examined into, one is left in a condition
of wonder that anybody can be found to accept a series of
assumptions and presumptions as arguments.
A good deal, I see, is made of the possibility that de Quiros,
in giving a description of the countries (i.e., islands) he dis-
covered, mixed up into one general description all the particular
features and distinctive traits of the various islands. At this
rate one might equally say that, supposing he did land on some
part of the Australian coast (say, Port Curtis), he observed
the marble, but, appalled at the barren and unproductive character
of the country, never mentioned this particular position, but.
only to use a common expression, ? lumped ? in the marble when
giving an account of the beauties of the countries he had dis-
covered, This, of course, I only remark, not because there is
the smallest proof that he ever did reach Australia proper, but
taking a leaf out of the Cardinal?s book, to show that one may
as readily assume one thing as another.
With kindest regards, yours sincerely,
HELENA M. CARNEGIE.
of the late David Wynford Carnegie, F.R.G'S., author of ? Spinni-

Again, Lady Carnegie wrote on 18th June, 1904: ?
Dear Mr. Macdonald, ?Please forgive but a short note, as I
am very busy, being on the eve of departure for South Africa.
I must look back to 1902 volume of the ? Royal Geographical'
Journal,? and read the full examination (from which you quote
in your letter) of Cardinal Moran?s claims. The more I think
of it the more preposterous his claim seems. Ido not think
that the shades of de Quiros and Torres can be rejoicing over
what might truly be called the aspersions on their veracity, even
though they may be made in the interest of the Church to which
they belonged.
Believe me, with kindest regards, yours very sincerely,
HELENA M. CARNEGIE.

Mr. P. F Macdonald, who has resided in and near Rockhamp-
ton and in other parts of Central and Northern Queensland for
more than fifty years, writes from ?
Rockhampton, 4th June, 1908. ?
My Dear Brother,?l have just received a pamphlet, No. 57,.
recently issued by His Eminence Cardinal Moran, claiming for
de Quiros the credit of having discovered this eastern part of
Australia. His fertile imagination must be highly amusing to
those who are acquainted with the early history of discovery and
exploration of Central Queensland, *and his object in connecting
de Quiros? description of the Bay of Santo with Port Curtis is
a mystery to me.
I landed at Gladstone in 1857, but it did not occur to any of
our party that we had entered a ?large and beautiful bay 20
leagues in length by four leagues in width, with two large rivers
in sight which ships might enter, and which had been named
the ? Jordan ? and the ? Salvador,? about 250 years before our
arrival.
The creek now known as the ? Boyne,? which supplies the
inhabitants with fresh water, empties into a narrow point of Glad-
stone Harbour, and is hidden from the sea by dense mangrove
scrub. This cannot possibly be de Quiros? ? beautiful Jordan,?
nor the ? Salvador;? but what has become of these ? noble rivers,
which were said ? to empty into the bay with a depth of water
more than three fathoms, and even frigates could enter ??* The
only two rivers worthy of the name are the ? Fitzroy,? which
enters Keppel Bay, about 80 miles northerly from Port Curtis,
* Cardinal?s pamphlet, No. 57, p.p. 5, 6, 7


and the ?Burnett" River, which is 100 miles south of Glad-
stone (Port Curtis).
There is a small stream, called the ? Calliope,? which is fully
twelve miles northerly of Port Curtis, which empties into a
shallow channel separating Curtis Island from the mainland,
which cattle cross to and from the island at low tide.
I spent several years exploring Queensland, including all the
?country in the watershed of the Fitzroy and its branches, the
Dawson, Comet, Nogoa, Mackenzie and Isaac Rivers. I have
carefully studied the journals of Major Mitchell, Leichardt, Ken-
nedy, Favenc and others, and have compared notes with my pioneer
friends, Gregory, Landsborough, Macdonald, Dalrymple, Hood,
King, Murray, Walker, Connor and others, but I never saw or
heard of anyone having seen our aborigines using ? clay pots,
weaved cloths, marble flutes, drums, nor keeping goats or pigs,
nor possessing silver or pearls; nor are there any beautiful plains
or very large mountains visible from the coast within 100 miles
of Port Curtis, nor houses of wood,? etc.*
The only animal seen in this part of Australia in our early
explorations suggestive of ? pigs ? were the bandicoot and the
porcupine.
In common with my Port Curtis and Central Queensland
friends I would be delighted to support the Cardinal?s theory in
claiming for us the proud distinction of living in the felicitous
land described by those eminent navigators, de Quiros and
Torres; but, unfortunately, it does not in any respect agree with
de Quiros? Bay of San Felipe and St. James (Espiritu Santo),
and I am forced to the conclusion that de Quiros never landed
on this part of Australia, or why did he not mention anything
of our marsupials, dingoes, emus, curlews, laughing-jackasses,
and other birds and animals, so remarkable and distinct from those
of other countries known in 1606?
De Quiros mentions ? that he and his party experienced great
tremblings of the earth, some lasting an hour, and felt on board
their ships as if bumping on rocks, thus indicating the probability
of great earthquakes on the mainland.? And I think it would
be far more reasonable for the Cardinal to conclude that de
Quiros? ? land of promise ? extended to the well-known volcanic
islands in the North-Eastern Pacific, where volcanic eruptions
are fiequent. Yours affertionatelv.
Yours affectionately,
P. F. MACDONALD.

* Cardinal?s pamphlet, No. 57, p.B.


My friend, Captain W. C. Thomson, writes in reply to my
request: ?
S.S. Arawatta, 12th September, 1908.
Dear Mr. Macdonald,?l have read a small pamphlet by
Cardinal Moran, dealing with the de Quiros controversy, which
was thrashed out some time ago by members of your Geo-
graphical Society, and then referred to a Committee of leading
geographers in England, who unanimously decided against the
Cardinal.
The Cardinal ought to remember that there are others in pos-
session of the whole of the information re the voyage made by
those famous navigators, de Quiros and Torres, and the way
he so deliberately misquotes, not only the reports of de Quiros,
but also the statements made 'by his critics, one cannot but con-
clude that the Cardinal?s knowledge of the discovery of Australia
is of little value.
I really cannot treat seriously this last effort of the Cardinal?s
to establish such an absurd theory. It is a well-established fact
that de Quiros never reached Australia as we know it, but that he
discovered and entered the large bay in the Island of Santo, New
Hebrides Group, which he named ? Austrial del Espiritu Santo,?
and it is with this word ?Austrial? that he juggles, and en-
deavours to throw dust in the eyes of the people.
Yours faithfully,
A. C. Macdonald, Esq., Melbourne. W - C - THOMSON.
The opinion of the late Mr. Alexander Sutherland, M.A., is
worth quoting. He said, in the course of a discussion at a
meeting of this Society, 3rd December, 1900:?? That the land
around Port Curtis was flat and tame; there were no bold cliffs
rising up into densely wooded mountains, from which streamlets
cast themselves into the sea ?that there are no pigs. How, then,
did they come to be around Port Curtis ??
? I have,? says Mr. Sutherland, ? seen an Indian juggler bring
a young pig out of a gentleman s waistcoat pocket, and a live
baby out of the hat the skipper wore on his head. It would have
been a more surprising feat to bring a pig out of an aboriginal
native camp in Australia 300 years ago!?
Torres, in his narrative, distinctly calls the land he and Quiros
discovered an island. He says, ?We sailed around a great part
of it. After leaving Espiritu Santo, Torres sailed south in search
of a Great Southland, which would have been absurd had he
already found one. Then he changed his course to the south-


west, which would have been impossible had he sailed from Port
Curtis, as it would have taken him overland. When he reached
2iï¿½ south ?not far from the north-western end of New Caledonia
?he then turned to the north-east, and fell in with the coast
of New Guinea, about latitude nï¿½ 30' south. These courses
are all easily followed on the map?if we take the starting point
from Espiritu Santo, but inexplicable if the start was from Port
Curtis.
The Cardinal no doubt found it inconvenient to quote from the
log of the chief pilot (Caspar Gonzalez de Leza) of the fleet,
who sailed with de Quiros in the Capitana. He describes the
entrance of the fleet on the Ist May, 1606, into the ? beautiful
capacious Bay,? where the ships anchored in 20 to 40 fathoms;
the landing on the 4th of May, in latitude 15ï¿½ 10' south; the
departure of two boats and an armed party to see the rivers,
when it was seen that there were many streams flowing from
hills, high and low, with beautiful plains 60 leagues in extent
That on the 9th of May three natives came to us; one appeared
to be king over the others, for all did his bidding. The king,
with his two counsellors (both grey-headed men), drew a line
on the sand, giving us to understand we were not to cross it.
De Quiros, seeing that they put this limit upon us, ? told them
to go away, because we would come much further.? They re-
turned, making a great noise, and, as their audacity and insolence
was too great, de Quiros ordered some argubuses to be fired.
One of the natives fell dead, others fled wounded. The body
of the dead native was hanged on a tree by one foot, where all
might see him. The natives then appeared, armed, in all direc-
tions, shooting off many arrows and darts. The chief and many
others were killed. On another occasion the chief pilot says;
? As we descended to the plain we heard the natives making great
alarm with their drums. We made a rapid attack, pressed upon
them, and did great execution, also capturing many extremely
beautiful women.?* To the credit of de Quiros, it must be
recorded that he refused to allow any of the women to be brought
on board. It was while the fleet was at anchor in this bay, on
the 19th of May, 1606, ? that there were great tremblings of
the earth, some of them lasting an hour?felt on board as if
the ships were bumping on rocks. On the 20th 80 men embarked
in the tender and went to the River Jordan, twelve miles from
where the ships were anchored. This* river is described as

voyages.


navigable for frigates. On the 25th high mass was celebrated,
and it was not until midnight on the 25th of June that the Capi-
tana sailed out of the harbour. While in port three native boys
were kidnapped, and were only released upon payment of 30 pigs
for each boy, the natives fearing that the Spaniards intended to
eat the boys.
My object, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, in again bring-
ing this important matter before members of this Society and
the public is to prevent, if possible, the falsification of the history
of discovery and exploration of this Continent of Australia. Un-
fortunately, there are would-be historians who will neither retract
nor substantiate any statement they once publish, no matter
how false and unfounded the statement or theory is proved to be.
I am not, however, without hope that His Eminence Cardinal
Moran may now see his error, and that he will abandon what I
maintain is proved beyond all manner of doubt to be utterly
foundationless and misleading theory.
After the reading of the two previous papers,
Mr. Panton in reply said : In the paper which Mr. Macdonald has
just read, we have only had a repetition of the old arguments embodied in
papers read before this Society when the subject was first discussed. As to
the extracts read to us from letters of correspondents who had replied to his
request that they would express their views on his side of the question, I
may remark that it does not follow that such opinions are of any value, and,
as I pointed out on a former occasion, the manifestly coloured and fanciful
descriptions of the products and fauna of the land discovered, which the
supporters of the Santo Island rely upon as inapplicable to Australia, were
evidently inserted in the memorials of I)e Quiros by the learned scribes
entrusted with drafting them to add. to the importance and value of the
discovery. As an example of this fashion of the period, we find in the early
maps of the north-west of Australia illustrations representing places with
ladies and gentlemen in oriental robes promenading on their lawns and
numerous lions and camels roaming in the surrounding country. At the
same time the geographical features are clearly recognisable.
It is allowed that De Tobar was an open enemy of De Quiros. His map,
which has been accepted, although it bears the title of the bay of St. Phillipe
and Santiago, does not show any one of the features as has already been
pointed out, nor even the names of the rivers Jordan and St. Salvador,
nor the site of the new Jerusalem. Even Torres maintained that the great
Southland had been discovered, and he is supported by Torquinada and
others, and although De Quiros, through Ue Tobar?s persistent animosity
may have been discredited, I am not aware that any of these others were
accused of misrepresentation.
In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I have carefully studied all avail-
able evidence in this case. I have been on these seas, and amongst the
islands, I know the prevailing winds of the season of the south-east mon-
soon, aud I am of opinion that His Eminence, Cardinal Moran, deserves the
thanks of geographers for having drawn attention to this subiect, and that

he has proved that De Quiros did discover part of the east coast of Australia,
or Austrialia, as the discoverer named it for reasons given.
Capt. \V. C. Thomson, in moving a vote of thanks to the authors of
the papers, said he did so with very great pleasure. Mr. Mac Donald had
contributed valuable information and conclusive evidence that De Quiros
had discovered Santo in the New Hebrides group, and that neither De
Quiros nor Torres could claim discovery of Port Curtis, Queensland.
The Rev. Daniel Mac Donald, D.D., who for more than a quarter of
a century was stationed at the island of Santo, said he had never heard
any resident on the island express the least doubt that the Big Bay of
Santo was not identical with that described by De Quiros, which corres-
ponds in nearly every detail with that given by De Quiros and his com-
panions. A great range of mountains is visible from the bay; yams
more than a yard long and nearly half a yard in diameter are indigen-
ous, and from the head of the bay there is a large extent of rich
country full of sugar cane and various kinds of fruit-bearing trees. The
natives are undoubedly numerous and vary in colour, the majority being
copper colour, while some are darker and negroid, others lighter in
colour, and of the latter it is not unusual to find good looking men and
women. It is a mistake to say ? the natives weave cloth,? the so-called
cloth is the usual Pacific Island ? Tappa.? The Santo people still make
pottery; their arms are bows and arrow's and clubs and spears, some of
their clubs might easily be mistaken for wooden swords. De Quiros?
account of the singing of birds in the early morning is quite correct.
It may be held as certain that the views expressed by Mr. Macdonald
in his paper are correct, and should settle the matter in dispute.
Mr. A. C. Macdonald in returning thanks said that the map ot the
Bay of Santo which he had copied from De Quiros? narrative of the
the voyage w'as sufficient proof of itself that De Quiros? outward voyage
ended at the Island of Santo, and not at any spot on the Australian
coast. The map bore a close resemblance to that of the Ac.miialty map
of the present day of Santo Harbour, and in no respect whatever could
it be compared with the insignificant so-calhd harbour or baj? of Port
?Curtis.


THE PHYSICAL FEATURES, ETC., OF THE NEW HEBRIDES
GROUP IN 1908 COMPARED WITH DE QUIROS?
DESCRIPTION IN 1606.
A. C. Macdonald, F.R.G.S
Read before the Royal Geographical Society, Melbourne , Sept. 27, 1909 ?
At a meeting of members of this Society, held on the 23rd
April last, I contributed a paper on ? The Alleged Discovery of
Australia by de Quiros in the year 1606: A reply to His Emi-
nence Cardinal Moran?s Second Pamphlet, No. 57, 1905,? in which
I endeavoured to show that the ingenious theory put forward
by the Cardinal had been proved beyond all manner of doubt to
be utterly misleading and entirely without foundation.
A third pamphlet from the Cardinal's pen, No. 11, entitled
? Substance of the Commemoration Discourse of Cardinal Moran
at St. John?s College, November 14th, 1906,? has since been
brought under my notice, in which His Eminence repeats all his
previous arguments in support of his hypothesis?ignoring all
evidence to the contrary.
In the leading Roman Catholic newspaper (the ? Advocate ?)
of the 7th August, 1909, No. 2024, vol. xli., page 12, I find,
under the heading, ? Our Special Correspondence; Letter from
a Victorian,? dated Ist July, 1909, the following paragraph:
? The current number of the Annals of the Propagation of
the Faith contains an interesting letter from the Right Reverend
Monsignor Doucere, Vicar Apostolic of the New Hebrides.
Until a few years ago the New Hebrides formed part of the
diocese of New Caledonia. Now the group has a resident Bishop,
in the person of the Right Rev. Monsignor Doucere, who has 25
priests labouring under his jurisdiction, all members of the
Society of Mary, and several communities of Marist Sisters; 22
Catholic churches and congregations have been established on the
principal islands of the group ?Vate, Malicolo, Ambrym, Aoba,
Espiritu-Santo, Api, and Pentecost (Aragh-Aragh on the map).
Espiritu-Santo ?the Harbour of the Holy Cross ?is appro-
priately a Catholic centre, for it was so named by the early
Catholic navigator, de Quiros, the chaplain of whose expedition
celebrated Mass on the spot, doubtless the first Mass offered up
in the Australian section of the Southern Hemisphere. His
Eminence Cardinal Moran has broached the theory that Port
Curtis, Queensland, is the Harbour of the Holy Cross described


by de Quiros, and he has adduced some ingenious arguments in
support of that hypothesis. But His Eminence will probably be
the first to admit that the weight of geographical expert opinion
is against his theory, and that the belief that de Quiros never got
nearer to Australia than Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides,
must be held to be the official and orthodox one, until some sub-
stantial evidence to the contrary is discovered.?
Since reading the passage, I ventured to write to his
Eminence on the 17th of August last, calling attention to
it, and asking whether he had any comment to make upon
it. I pointed out in my letter that it would be satisfactory,
not only to myself as an Australian, but also to Mr. Panton ?who,
for many years past, had taken much interest in the question of
the early discovery of Australia (and especially in the Cardinal s
theory)?to have the matter settled, if possible, for all time.
His Eminence replied ?as follows; ?
St. Mary?s Cathedral,
Sydney, 30th August, 1909.
Dear Sir, ?I thank you very much for your letter relating to
the discovery of Australia by de Quiros. I am glad the ques-
tion is being discussed on historic grounds, and such discussion
cannot fail to throw light on the whole matter. I send you a
small popular pamphlet which I contributed, and which I am
happy to say has called the attention of a good many persons
to the subject.?Yours very faithfully,
PATRICK F. CARDINAL MORAN,
Archbishop of Sydney.
Since receipt of the Cardinal's letter, which I considered any-
thing but satisfactory, I made further search for evidence in
support of my contention; ?That de Quiros never landed at
Port Curtis, nor upon any other part of the coast of Australia
proper, but that his land-fall was the Harbour of Santo, in the
New Hebrides ? ?with the result that I found in my library, in a
report of Proceedings of the Linnaen Society of New South
Wales (Part 3, 25th October, 1905) an article on the geology of
the New Hebrides, by Mr. Douglas Mawson, 8.E., B.Sc., Lec-
turer on Mineralogy and Petrology at the University of Adelaide
(a member of the Shackleton Antarctic Expedition), being the re-
sult of six months? field work carried out under the auspices of
Captain E. G. Rason. R.N., Government Resident, during the win-
ter of 1903, assisted by Mr. W. T. Quaife (biologist of the expe-
dition). ? These gentlemen acknowledge their indebtedness to the
various missionaries in the group for their ever-ready hospitality.


and especially to the Rev, F. Bowie, M.A., of Tonga (one of the
small islands of the group), and the Rev. Daniel Macdonald,
D.D. (who for more than thirty years had resided there), by
whose assistance districts otherwise inaccessible were brought
within the sphere of their operations.
The geographical features of the New Hebrides Group?the
belt of islands shown on the map (which is a copy from the
report I have just quoted)?extend for a length of 550 miles
in a nor?-nor?-westerly direction, between the Island of Anyteum
on the south (latitude 20ï¿½, 15' South) to the North Island of the
Torres Group (13 0 , 10' South).
The group consists of twelve large islands, varying in size from
that of Espiritu Santo, with an area of 1500 square miles, to
Anyteum, with an approximate area of 40 square miles. Of
smaller islands there are about eighteen, averaging over five
square miles, making altogether an area equal to about one-
fourth that of the State of Victoria.
Earthquakes are of frequent occurrence, often assuming a
violent character, most undoubtedly proceeding from the local
volcanoes, which, when they increase in activity, are in a con-
stant state of tremor, punctuated at intervals by severe shocks,
felt at considerable distances. On some of the islands, when
the shocks are more than usually severe, wooden buildings are
demolished, iron tanks are thrown down and burst, and in the
mission houses pianos and heavy furniture are flung across the
rooms. De Quiros reports having experienced, during the few
days he was in harbour, one of these shocks, on the 19th
May, 1606, which he thus describes:?? This day, in the morn-
ing, and the day before, at night, there were great tremblings of
the earth, some of them lasting an hour, and we felt them on
board our ships, as if they were bumping on some rock.?
Here again is unmistakable evidence that de Quiros was at
anchor in the Bay of Santo, 800 miles or more from Port Curtis,
where no violent earthquake shocks nor earth tremors have ever
been felt or recorded.
Ambrym is 21 miles long, with an area of 160 square miles
It is a remnant of an immense volcano, with an extinct crater,
six miles in diameter, eighteen miles in circumference. The floor
of the old crater, 2100 feet above sea level, is now thickly
covered with ashes. Around the rim of the crater there is a
broken line of peaks, averaging 3000 feet in height. One of
these cones is 3720 feet (Mt. Benbow), and Mt. Marum 4380


feet in height. Each of these cones have craters about one mile
in diameter.
Lopevi is a remarkable volcano. It towers upwards in a
perfect cone 4755 feet. The crater is about a quarter of a mile
in diameter. At its base it is only three miles in diameter.
Tanna.?The volcano of Yassowa on this island was first
visited by Capt. Cook in 1774. It is continuously active. No
inconvenience is caused to the inhabitants. The cone is conical
in shape, 1300 feet in height. In 1878, during a series of earth-
quake shocks, the island jumped up a distance of 20 feet, and,
later, at another, 12 feet. In 1888 severe earthquake shocks
caused a further upheaval of the land of at least 30 feet.
Active volcanoes and hot springs, with a temperature of iooï¿½
to 107ï¿½, abound in the islands. Mountain ranges, from 5380
feet on Santo, 4750 feet on Lopevi, 4600 feet on Ambryrn, 2750
feet on Erromanga, 2202 feet on Efati, 2171 feet on Mai, besides
series of mountain peaks and ranges, from 1000 feet and up-
wards, are everywhere seen. *
The geographical, geological and topographical features de-
scribed in the report from which I have quoted, compared with
the descriptions given by de Quiros, in the report of his cele-
brated voyage, are, allowing for much exaggeration in the glow-
ing description given in the memorial of the luxuriant vegetation
on the shores of the bay, are in close agreement with those which
we find in the New Hebrides Group So also is his description
of the natives, their weapons and habits, the harbour, rivers,
native fruits, mountains, fertility of soil, etc. But none of these
bear the most remote resemblance with what obtains on the
Queensland coast at Port Curtis, where his Eminence persists in
claiming that de Quiros landed in 1606.
Some of my audience present to-night will no doubt recollect
that another of the many so-called arguments relied upon by his
Eminence in support of his theory, was the existence of ? marble
deposits near Port Curtis.? These so-called deposits were never,
I believe, worked for any other purpose than for converting into
lime.
De Quiros describes the marble quarries in glowing terms.
He says: ? Sumptuous and elegant edifices could be raised by
working the marble quarries.?
One of the illustrations in Mr. Mawson?s report shows beds of
coralline or miocene limestone, which, in situ, unless scientific-
ally examined, might very easily be mistaken for marble. Some
* See Map page 7 ante.


of these beds are from 50 to 100 feet thick, and occur on most of
the New Hebrides Islands.
Another argument relied upon by the Cardinal is ? that the
Port Curtis beach consists of ? black gravel and small, heavy
stones excellent for ballast.? ? Black sand and gravel along the
shores is a feature throughout the New Hebrides Group.
It requires very little stretch of imagination, when standing
upon some elevated position on the Island of Santo (and de
Quiros states ? that he climbed up a high mountain on the 21st
of May, 1606 ?) to mistake such a long stretch of high mountains,
ranges and peaks (extending for 400 miles in a south-easterly
direction) for an almost unbroken coast line, and such a view
evidently led de Quiros into the error of describing the country
he had discovered ? as a fourth part of the whole globe.?
De Quiros refers in his journal ? to having taken possession
on the 14th of May of the whole of the lands seen, and to be
seen, as far as the South Pole (which used to be called) or which
he called ? Austrialia del Espiritu Santo,? for, he adds, in his
memorial to the King, ? for the happy memory of your Majesty,
and for the sake of the name of Austria, I have called it Austri-
alia del Espiritu Santo.?*
I take the following extract from the Cardinal?s last pamphlet,
entitled ? Discovery of Australia by de Quiros in the Year 1606:
Substance of the Commemorative Discourse of Cardinal Moran,
at St. John?s College, 14th November, 1906?: ?
? The most famous of de Quiros? expeditions was that which
led to the discovery of the Great Austral Land in 1606. The
original sources, however, which would serve to illustrate this
expedition were little better than a sealed book to English
readers, till Mr. W. A. Duncan, Fellow of St. John?s College, l
published, in 1874, the Spanish text and translation
of an interesting memorial, addressed by de Quiros to the Spanish
monarch. A few years later Don Zaragosa, a distinguished
Spanish ecclesiastic, published at Madrid in three volumes the
same memorial, together with several other invaluable contem-
porary documents illustrative of de Quiros? voyage. The learned
President of the Hakluyt Society, Sir Clements Markham, in
1904, published a translation of these important records, with a
valuable introduction and several interesting notes,?
Zaragosa's translation is comparatively of modern date, pos-
sibly about the year 1870, or later, and I understand that Mr.
Panton reproduced a copy of a map published with Zaragosa?s

No such map is to he found in either of the three volumes of de
Quiros? narrative of his voyage. What proof such a map can pos-
sibly be in support of the Cardinal's theory I am at a loss to
understand. The map of the Harbour of Santo published in de
Quiros' volume agrees in nearly every detail with de Quiros?
description.
The Cardinal, in clause 6, page 33, of his 1906 pamphlet, says;
? It only remains to consider the difficulty (created) by Mr.
Ernest Favenc, who, in writing to the ? Australian Journal of
Education? (September, 1904), contends that the data furnished
by de Torres are irreconcilable with the claim of Port Curtis.
* De Torres,? he says, ? sailed from the newly discovered Harbour
of Vera Cruz (another name for the Harbour of Santo) on
a south-westerly course, till he reached the 27 0 of south lati-
tude,* and then, veering his course to the north-west, came upon
the coast of New Guinea, and discovered the strait which bears
his name. If we suppose him to start from Port Curtis on such
a course, he must have sailed through the Australian Continent.?
? In this statement of the case, however,? adds the Cardinal,
? it seems to me that Mr. Favenc does not do justice to the
genuine meaning of de Torres? narrative. I interpret him to
imply that he resolved to continue the voyage where de Quiros
had interrupted it, at the 26ï¿½ south latitude,* thus to carry out
what he believed to be the Royal instructions. According to
this interpretation he sailed some days along the Queensland
coast, but, finding the winds unfavourable, proceeded to the
latitude and longtitude where de Quiros had abandoned the
southern voyage.* Thence Torres sailed towards the south
to the f 30ï¿½ and even passed that latitude one degree .on a
south-west course. This would bring him, approximately, to
the longtitude 163ï¿½, as marked on our maplT Finding no land,
he directed his course to the north-west, where he eventually
fell in with the southern coast of New Guinea. This appears
to be the natural meaning of the words of Torres, and the course
of navigation he would thus have pursued is quite reconcilable
with the fact that Port Curtis was his starting point.?
Here, I venture to say, His Eminence is mistaken. Favenc
refers to Torres? narrative of his voyage after leaving
the Harbour of Santo, where he was deserted by de Quiros.
* The latitude given by De Torres according to Dalrymple?s translation
is 21 south, not 27 south.
t This latitude should be 24ï¿½.


Torres says, in effect, that ? he sailed along the west coast of the
newly discovered land as far as 21 0 south latitude, and, finding
no land, turned north-west and met with the south coast of New
Guinea.?
Here again we have further proof that the newly discovered
land was a long way east of the Queensland coast and identical
with the New Hebrides.
Had de Quiros accepted Torres? advice, when the expedition
had reached about latitude 24 0 south-about 6000 miles east of
Australia ?to sail to about the 40ï¿½, he would in all probability
have discovered either New Zealand or Australia.*
The Cardinal says; ?Juan Luis Arias, a lawyer of Santiago,
in Chili, addressed a memorial to King Phillip of Spain. He
derived his information from the Franciscan Fathers who
accompanied the expedition, and his memorial was written soon
after the death of de Quiros in 1615. He styles the newly
discovered land ? the Austral Hemisphere,? and describes the
harbour in which de Quiros landed as a magnificent expanse of
water. The land appeared to be more than 300 miles long,? etc.
But the Cardinal omits to quote what follows. Arias adds: ?
? Whether de Quiros really thought that in landing on Santo he
had discovered the traditional great Southern Continent?the
? Terra Australis nondum cognita ? of some maps ?is, I think,
doubtful. He (de Quiros) is so persistent in begging to be
allowed to proceed to these parts again that I think he felt that
he had not succeeded in discovering what he had hoped to dis-
cover, and that he magnified and embellished his real discoveries
with that object in view.?
In one of his memorials he writes: ?? I have told your Majesty
that in the region of the south is hidden the fourth part of the
whole globe, and that the discovery I have made in it is of 23
islands, which he enumerates, beginning with I?Encarnaceon,
longitude 125 0 W. and latitude 24 0 30' south, and ending with
the Island of the Virgin Mary, a little to the north of Santo
(Santa Maria of Quiros), with the adjacent three islands, called
the ? Austria'lia del Espiritu Santo ??in my judgment these three
form one extensive country.?
Evidently the object of Arias? memorial to the King was to
urge his Majesty to send out another expedition to explore these
parts of the Pacific Ocean.
In 1823 Captain Oxley, then Surveyor-General of New South
Wales, who examined Port Curtis by order of the Government,
says in his report; ?? The vegetation is scanty, timber none but

what would do for firewood.? De Quiros, Torres and Arias
say that the bay is easy of access by day or night, and that their
boats entered one of the rivers and got abundance of delicious
water.?
Oxley says:?? The harbour is difficult of access, and there
is no fresh water nearer than twelve or fourteen miles, and that
the place is unsuitable for settlement.?
Arias says:?? There are no shoals, reefs or sandbanks in the
bay.? The Pilot Leza describes it as ? being so deep that they
were three days beating up to the south against a strong wind,
and could find no anchorage, not being able sooner to reach the
port of Vera Cruz.?*
Flinders, about the year 1803, described Port Curtis in about
the same manner as Oxley.
Dr. J. P. Thomson, Hon. Secretary of the Queensland branch
of the Royal Geographical Society, writes: ?? There is no bay
at all at Port Curtis in a geographical sense.?
Major A. J. Boyd, an old resident of Queensland, expresses
the same opinion, and adds ? that de Quiros entered the Bay of
Santo from the north, and Port Curtis can only be entered from
the south.?
Sir Everard F. J. ini Thurm, K.C.M.G., Governor of Fiji
for over four years, in a paper contributed in May last, and
published in the ? Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of
England,? identifies the Harbour of Santo, New Hebrides, with
the land fall of de Quiros, ? which de Quiros believed?and
believed to the day of his death?to be part of the much sought
great continent, stretching to the southern limit of lands; and
he called the great land which he thought he had discovered
Austrialia del Espiritu Santo, the first word in compliment to
his Imperial Master of Austria. In the great Bay of St James,
on that island, and on the banks of the river which flows into
that bay, he christened the River Jordan, he founded the town
of the ? New Jerusalem,? and then he . . at once returned
by the way he had come to seek colonists and help. Quite in
vain; for the new * continent ? ?his ? continent ? ?was really a
small island of the New Hebrides Group?the island still called
? Espiritu Santo. ? ? f
Now which of these conflicting statements are we to believe?

I say, without the slightest hesitation, they are all true. De
Ouiros, Torres, Arias and Tobar describe the harbour and rivers
of Santo : Oxley, Macdonald, Dr. Thomson, Major Boyd, Flin-
ders, and Thurni the harbour and rivers of Port Curtis.
The Cardinal says in his third pamphlet, page 16: ? No rivers
as are described by de Ouiros can be found in Santo.? So much
the worse for his theory, I say. There are no such rivers falling
into the Bay of Port Curtis such as de Ouiros describes.
According to the Admiralty chart, Port Curtis is shown to be
full of shoals and sand banks; there arc no such high mountains
on that part of the Queensland coast as described in de Quires?
narrative; neither is there any bay corresponding in dimensions,
depth, etc.
It would be sheer waste of time to follow His Eminence any
further. My object on the present occasion is to deal finally
?as far as lam personally concerned?with what I contend is
a baseless and misleading theory, and, if possible, to correct the
past and present further falsification of the history of the early
discovery of this great Continent of Australia.
When this Society was instituted, nearly 27 years ago, its
objects were declared to be; ?First, scientific; second, com-
mercial ; third, educational; and fourth, historical?which latter
include the collection and publication of historical records of geo-
graphical interest, and of the memoirs of distinguished travel-
lers, explorers and geographers ?and the compilation from reli-
able data of all facts bearing upon the geography of Australia.
I consider it to be the bounden duty of everyone, whether a
member of this Society or not, to criticise and correct, as far
as possible, reports of geographical discoveries, no matter by
whom written or published, if they honestly believe such reports
to be false and misleading.
I am content to leave the issue of my criticism of the Car-
dinal's hypothesis to the unbiassed judgment and verdict of
members of this Society, and to the rest of the public, feeling
perfectly satisfied that it was the Harbour of Santo in which
de Ouiros? expedition anchored, and which both he and Torres
describe in their memorable narratives.*
I am indebted to my friend Captain Thomson, of the
s.s. ? Arrawatta,? for some information relating to the harbour
of Port Curtis, and the geology and geography of some of the
islands of the New Hebrides group. Captain Thomson reports
from personal observation, and his description of Malicolo and
Kfate bear unmistakable evidence that great changes have taken


place, ? that depression and upheaval are the two grand notes in
the harmony of nature that sound the requiem of past ages, and
the prelude to possible further changes.?
After the reading of the paper,
The Chairman (Mr. T. W. Fowler) invited discussion; he regretted
the unavoidable absence of Mr. J. -A. Panton, C.M.G., Henry Gyles Turner,
F.R.G.S , and Mr. W. Le Souef, C.M.Z.S., and the Rev. D. Macdonald, D.D.,
from the meeting.
Mr. Edward A. Petherick, F.R.G.S., said; The voyages of
Fernando De Quiros have been a pet subject of mine for more than thirty
years, and he is one of my heroes of discovery. The claim put forward for
his discovery of Australia is due to misapprehension on the part of the
cartographers. The longitudes of the early discoverers varied considerably,
and on some of the old charts the discoveries are hundreds of miles in error.
Both Beilin and Vaugondy, copying other charts, place the Solomon Islands
too far to the East, in the middle of the Pacific, and the Terre de Quir too
far to the west, and join it with dotted lines to Carpenteria on the North
West and Van Diemen?s Land on the South West. This is probably the
origin of the claim for De Quiros? discovery of Australia, put forward by
Cardinal Moran and others. But the latitudes of De Quiros and Torres were
very carefully recorded, and there is no doubt whatever, if his published
narrative and charts are authentic, tbat his Espiritu Santo was in the New
Hebrides group, and not upon any part of the coast of Australia.
Mr. Matthew Magpie, in response to the Chairman?s request, offered
a few observations. He said he did not claim to have studied the topic
under discussion so critically as to justify him in speaking with authority
as Messrs. Macdonald and Petherick were entitled to do, but he felt bound
to confess that he considered the arguments advanced in the excellent
paper which had been read irrefutable in favour of the view that the landing
place of De Quiros was not at Port Curtis in Australia but in the Island of
Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides group. All that Cardinal Moran had
stated in support of his belief, that the explorer referred to had discovered
the mainland of Australia, had been exhaustively tested by the author of
the paper, but it is found to be impossible to reconcile De Quiros? own
description of the coast and harbour he discovered with the well-known
features of Port Curtis, while that description tallied very nearly with the
harbour of Santo, and the coastal aspect presented by the Island of Santo.
Personally, Mr. Macfie added, I have no bias in the matter, but as one
impartially open to conviction, I can come to no other conclusion from the
facts so lucidly and exhaustively stated, than that the plea of the Cardinal
cannot be sustained.
Mr. E. D. Stocks remarked that De Quiros was very nearly correct in
regard to the latitude where he anchored (15ï¿½ 10' South), which marks the
Bay of Santo, but Port Curtis is about 24ï¿½ 30' South. ? His journal speaks
of easy access, deep waters, no islands or shoals? ; while the approaches to
Port Curtis from the sea are difficult to get through, then there is the
Barrier Reef, Curtis and other islands, and innumerable sand banks. In
the New Hebrides there are plenty of wild and other fruits to support life ;
at Port Curtis the best native fruit is the geebung, about one inch in length
by half an inch thick, the interior filled with a hard stony seed. De Quiros
describes two fine rivers in the harbour, in which he anchored. He


nonnfl/HQ
would have searched in vain for more than a tin}' stream had he entered
Port Curtis. De Quiros is said to have sailed west from the land he dis-
covered ; had he sailed from Port Curtis he would have performed the
impossible feat of sailing over Mount Morgan. The Cardinal?s theory has
been clearly disproved by Mr. Macdonald (applause).
Mr. FinucanE (who resided in the Rockhampton and other districts of
Queensland, for many }-ears) in proposing a vote of thanks, said that
although he had a limited acquaintance with De Quiros? travels, he was
personally well acquainted with Port Curtis, especially where Gladstone
is situated, and he could not possibly reconcile the description given by De
Quiros, of the harbour, rivers, natives, etc., that he is reported to have dis-
covered, with any part of Port Curtis. Mr. Macdonald had most conclusively
shown that the hypothesis put forward by the Cardinal was misleading.
The vote of thanks was carried by acclamation.
Mr. Macdonaed in returning thanks said that about two years ago,
when passing through Gladstone, he had had an opportunity of noting the
physical features of the Port Curtis Coast line. At high tides the sea
covered a considerable extent of land near the shore. The coast line of the
harbour entered by De Quiros is described by the Pilot Leza of De Quiros?
ship ?as being so deep that they were three days beating up to the South
against a strong wind, and could find no anchorage, and that the coast line
was precipitous.? To enter Port Curtis vessels have to approach the Port
from the South. The harbour of Santo could only be entered from the
North.
