THE PLYMOUTH HOE.
There was a sound of revelry
Upon the Plymouth Hoe,
One afternoon in bright July,
Three hundred years ago.?lsBB.
For men of race and chivalry
Were playing games at bowls
Whilst waiting for their Admiral, ?
All merry thirsty souls !
There were Southwell, Grevile, Raleigh,
Blount, Oxford, Cecil, Drake,
B'robisher, Wintour, ?to name all
Too long a time would take ;
But Hawkins must not be forgot,
Admiral of the Port,
A grave man he, as grave could be,
And little given to sport.
But on that day his blood was up
At thought of coming fray ;
He was their host, his wine was good,
He gayest of the gay.
?A toast,? he cried, ?and no heel taps 1
? Perdition to the foe,
? May they before the week is out
? To Davy?s locker go.?


Admiral Sir FRANCIS DRAKE.




One foot on table, glass raised, high,
These merry gentlemen
Echoed the toast, threw down the glass,
And breath?d a deep Amen.
So merrily these captains play?d,
Their ships lay in the Bay
In fighting trim, well manned with crews
All longing for the' fray !
Howard, of Effingham, meanwhile,
Impatient of delay,
Had with his fire-ships gone to drive
The foe from Calais Bay!
When hove in sight a Privateer,
Running before the wind,
Flemming the pirate, captain?s name,
His ship?s The Golden Hind.
The Pirate boldly sprang on shore
And with a sailor?s fling,
Said ??Take me to your Admiral
? For tidings good I bring.?
Frowning, the captains gather?d round ;
?Report your news,? said they,
The Pirate answered with a glare,
That raised their pulses? play ;
From half closed eyes, fierce, keen, as if
Facing furious blizzard,
? I sighted the Armada?s flag
? Sou?-sou?-west the Lizard !?
The words were few, but like to bolts
From heav?n they on them fell;
And each breast heav?d, as heaves the sea
In undulating swell.


And there was hailing of the boats,
And hurrying to the same ;
But Drake sung out, avast! belay !
Let?s finish first our game ;
And when we?ve made the ? winning cast ?
We?ll sail the foe to rake :
If ours is not the winning lot
My name?s not Francis Drake !
They played their game, then sailed forth
These belted knights so bold?
A very different game to play
Before the week was old.
But first Drake to the Pirate said,
? But that you?ve risk?d your neck
? To bring the news, I?d string you up
? On your own quarter-deck.
? And so I will if e?er we meet
? Upon the open main ;
? And now be off, and never come
?Athwart my beams again ! ?
The Pirate said, ? I love my Queen,
? I hate the King of Spain,
? And for my country and her flag
? I?d risk my neck again ! ?
No more he said, but sought his ship,
Lest Drake might change his mind ;
And set his sails and put to sea,
He and his Golden Hind.
For what port bound will not be found
On any shipping list;
He sailed east, he sailed west,
Just as his wild will list.


Sir WALTER RALEGH.
From the Zucchero Portrait.




But though a reckless pirate he,
He was a patriot too ;
And though a law unto himself,
To Queen and country true.
God give that pirate rest in heaven
At sea he could not find ;
A briny fame clings to his name
And to his Golden Hind.
Meanwhile the Spanish fleet came on,
Their flagship ?fore the rest;
Drake captur?d her?? First prize,? he said
? We?ll rout or take the rest.?
Drake from his prize her captain took
Ere towing her to port,
And like a gallant gentleman
Himself he did deport.
Still onward came the doomed fleet,
And up the Channel sailed,
In form ? half-moon like a simoom
The English ships assail?d.
They broke their form, drove in their ships.
Raking them fore and aft,
Then charged again when rounding them,
And raked them well abaft.
It was a fierce and running fight
For many and many a day.
At last the foe began to yield,
Tired of the bloody fray.
Some set their, sails and sped away
A kinder coast to gain,
When lo ! the elements combined
To drive them back again.


And some were sunk and some were wreck?d,
And few there did remain
To take the news that all was lost
To Philip King of Spain !
?Twould take a quill from angels? wing
To register each pray?r
Sent up to all the Saints in heav?n
For special aid and care,
By Spanish ladies, for their lords
They ne?er would see again :
But ah ! what pen can chronicle
Their agony and pain.
On Britain?s shores, and Ireland?s too,
Strange wreckage met the eye,
Which may be seen at Plymouth Hoe
This nineteenth of July :
Not for vain-glorious display
Of a great foe o?ercome,
But in defence of our own Isle,
To urge each mother?s son.
And in that fierce and bloody fight ?
That terrible affray
Where all fought well, who fought the best
It would be hard to say.
But Hawkins and brave Frobisher
Were knighted on the sea
By the Lord-Admiral himself
For feats of bravery !
Knighted before the fight was o?er,
Before the enemy,
On the ship?s deck that Hawkins led?
His flagship Victory !


Admiral Sir JOHN HAWKINS,




That was our Nelson?s flagship?s name,
A name replete with beauty ;
Let it not die with him who died
Urging, his men to duty.*
The Queen confirmed the Admiral?s choice
But did right proudly say,
? I have on board of my good fleet
? Hundreds as brave as they ! ?
She did not boast, she did not vaunt,
Over a vanquished foe ;
Her words in that triumphant hour
Her trust in God did show.
? He blew and they were scattered,?
His words the motto be
On medals'cast, our foe to show
In their extremity.
Long be it England?s proudest boast
She has a Queen as good,
And wise, and pious, too, as she
Who flatterers withstood.
Who gives impartially to all
The praise and honour due,
Her heroes brave with laurels crowns,
With bay her poets, too !
Long may Her name and England?s be
A Power throughout the world,
Victorious by land and sea
Where?er her flag?s unfurl?d.
* The Victory, on which Nelson died, was the last
ship of that name on England?s Navy List.


Long may she boast her sea-girt Isle?
A home?a shelter safe,
A refuge gives, to friends or foes
Who ?neath oppression chafe.
Long may she boast her ships are trim,
Ready and fit for fight;
All right, tight, and available
At any day or night.
Not napping, as when on that day
Van Tromp?s ships pass?d the Nore,
Sailed all unchalleng?d up the 1 hames,
To London City?s shore.
Long may she boast her gallant 1 ars
Have hearts of oak as bold,
Loyal, and true, ?neath jackets blue,
As in the days of old.
Long may she boast her nobles too
As bold a front can show,
As those who met to play at bowls
Three hundred years ago,
Then sailed forth to meet and beat
Their formidable foe
With hearts as gay as when at play
Upon the Plymouth Hoe ! ?l5BB.
