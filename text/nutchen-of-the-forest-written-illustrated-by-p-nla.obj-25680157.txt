jVutcherv
of the
forest
CHAPTER 1
upon a time, in a far-away country, there was
an old, old forest, so beautiful that the country people used to sav
that the fairies lived there and grew in its splendour for their
own enjoyment.
Certainly it seemed as though this might be true, for there
were whole carpets of bluebells mingled with pink and white
foxgloves, all standing there as though ready to ring out glad
peals of fairy music for their dancing; and there were fairy
circles of vivid emerald-green grass, set around with rings and
rings of little fat golden brown fungi, that seemed to be just
put there as seats for dainty fairy folk. Then, too, there
were large flat-topped toadstools like Chinese umbrellas, surely
made for tea tables; and, in the dark places, weird yellow ones
which glimmered in the dim twilight with a soft radiance:
they might be little street lamps set there to guide their tiny
feet home from the Fairy Court Balls.
Parts of the forest were deep and shadowed by immense
ancient trees, whose knotted roots twisted into strange shapes
deep into the mossy ground. Tucked away snugly among
these roots were the quaint little homes of many folk of the
wild, who found there the quiet peace they loved,
and where their babies played and rustled amidst
the fallen leaves that carpeted the
ground in a soft, thick
mat of golden brown.

PAGE THREE
But in a more open part of the forest, in a sunny glade,
through which ran a tinkling fenvlined stream, stood a tiny
stone cottage, set in its own fair garden. In its deeply
thatched roof were the nests of hundreds of birds, and at
sunset each night the whole of the roof seemed alive with the
fluttering of their wings as they flitted around before settling
down for the night. The chorus of their many twitterings
could be heard from far away, but it was true music in the
ears of the owner of the tiny house, and she knew and loved
each one of her tiny tenants.
Much of her life was given to the loving care of the birds
and animals of the woodland. She peeped in to see their
families and was welcomed by even the most
jealous of wild mothers; she nursed them back to health when
they were found sick or injured, and as she walked in the
forest her tiny friends would gather round her unafraid. Birds,
both great and small, would perch on her shoulders, and the
timid wild deer would rub against her legs to show their love
and trust, so that there was no wonder that the people of the
countryside knew her as “Nutchen of the Forest."
So long had she lived alone, with only her pets, in her
tiny home, that no one in the village outside could remember
her age, but knew only that she must be very, very old, for
her hair was white as snow, and her brown, kindly face deeply
wrinkled by the years.
In all weathers Nutchen, her furry pets running beside
her, might be seen hurrying along some leafy
forest track, picking faggots for her fire,
gathering roots of wildflowers for her garden,
or healing herbs for
her storehouse.

CHAPTER 2
TWICE a year the gypsies came, driving their gaily
painted caravans down the rough forest tracks leading to her
door. They came to buy from her the many medicines and
salves that she made from the bark of the trees, and the leaves
and roots of many strange plants, of which she alone knew
the secret powers. Healing draughts for the sick, and
soothing potions for the broken-hearted, were eagerly sought
by the gypsy folk. Each little phial or jar had meant many
days of careful preparation, and to the gypsies was worth
many times the golden pieces they paid for it to Nutchen.
Gladly would they have discovered her secrets, had they been
able, and often had they hidden themselves to spy on her
garnenngs.
Down by the secret swamp, veiled by slender reeds, grew
the tall white moonflowers. These Nutchen gathered only on
moonlight nights when the dew was fresh upon them. Some-
times on the way there spies had followed her, but little did
they know of the watchful eyes of Too-Hoo, the big brown
owl, who, watching from the tree-tops, floated softly down on
silent, outspread wings to warn her of the hidden watchers.
Then would Nutchen chuckle to herself, and, with nimble feet,
would lead along ways unknown to her trackers, until in some
desolate place she would disappear, leaving them to flounder
their tired way home through deep bogs and dense thickets.
Never did they discover any of her secrets, and so, from
year to year, she continued to dwell in happiness in her tiny
cottage, with her many strange pets.
There was Rik-Rak, the green lizard, who scurried madly
over wall and ceilings in pursuit of spiders and flies;
Kraak, named for his harsh cry of alarm, was a lordly
white pheasant, who, tired
of the gibes of his golden

brown relatives, had, like Felicity, the white mouse, come to
seek quiet sanctuary with Nutchen and to enjoy the many
dainty tit-bits that fell from her table.
Then, too, there was Chips, a squirrel, orphaned when
only a few weeks old, found lonely and weeping in the forest.
He had grown to be an impudent little rascal, full of tricks
and self-importance. For his sleeping quarters he had taken
possession of Nutchen’s work-basket, regardless of the wrath
of the field mice, who had brought up many families in it
long before Chips came to disturb their peace. Not easily
were they turned out, but Chips was determined to have his
own w'ay, and every night, taking no heed of their squeaking
and scolding, would patiently but firmly lift out each mouse
in turn by its tail. Then, with the basket all to himself, Chips
would burrow under the soft knitting wool and, with a sigh
of content, curl himself into a ball and settle down for the
night. The mice, having to sleep where best they might,
would finally give up the fight and go to nest under the wood-
box, where the warmth from the fire kept them cosy and snug.
Through many years of caring for the animals, Nutchen
had learned their speech, and had been able to train Fnppy,
a brown woodland rabbit, to tell her of the daily happenings
in the forest, particularly of the gypsies, and of where they
set their traps and snares, so that she could warn her many
friends of their danger.
Fnppy was very clever, but he had a rollicking, roving
nature that got him into trouble all his life. When he was
only a bunny, a little fat, round bunny you could hold in your
cupped hands, he had wandered off alone one fine day to see
the great world. He roamed too far
and fell into a deep, deep stream, but,
being a lucky little scamp,
he fell "PLOMP,"
right on top of the


PAGE SEVEN
largest, fattest old trout that lived in the stream That old
gentleman was sunning himself on the surface. He was
shocked at being bumped so roughly, and lashed out angrily
with his strong tail. The whack he gave Fnpp tossed him
THUMPITT f'BUMP" right hack on to the bank. Badly
shaken, wet through and feeling very sorry for himself. Frippy
cried himself to sleep. He slept and slept till something tickled
his nose, and he woke with a violent sneeze. A baby quail
had seen his nose wriggling, as rabbits’ noses do wriggle, and,
thinking it was some new sort of pink worm, had pecked at
it, to be blown over backwards by the sneeze. Frightened and
frantic, it yelled madly for its mother. She was in the long
grass nearby, and out she clucked, all furious and bristling'
feathered, to protect her baby, and exploded in screeching
wrath and with wildly flapping wings right in poor little
Fnppy s face. He, poor mite, was scared out of his wits, and
bolted blindly away. He did not stop until he had put much
space between himself and the tiny terror. Now he had done
it! He was lost! He looked round; there was no place he
knew; not a tree, not a bush nor a clump of grass to tell him
that home lay somewhere near. But Frippy did not greatly
care; he was a wandering scamp anyway, and, having recovered
from his fright, set out again to see all this large and lovely
world where so many things happened to a small bunny He
nibbled at short green grass and juicy dandelion leaves, and
enjoyed himself immensely. After a while he grew weary, and
his little legs began to ache, so that he thought longingly about
the nest in the burrow where he lived, and his soft warm
mummy rabbit. As he rested at the foot of a tree he heard
footsteps in the forest, strange steps such as he had
never heard before, and he crouched still and silent
to see what had made the noise. It was the strangest
animal he had ever seen. It had feet that seemed to
stick straight out of the blue fur that formed the
bottom half of its body. Above this was
reddish brown fur, and on top a large

lump that seemed to be made of sticks. You and I know it was
really old Nutchen, as we see in the picture, going heme with
a bundle of firewood; but to Frippy, it was something very
new' and very strange, and so no wonder he thought her blue
skirt was blue fur, and that she had no legs! But, queer or
not, she looked so kind that Flippy thought she must be some
sort of a mother, and, as at this moment a mother was what
he wanted more than anything in the world, away he trotted
after her, ran past her, then tumbled and rolled in her path so
that she would see him.
“Poor little bunny,” said Nutchen. “You must be lost.
Are you very lonely?” Frippy did not understand her words
then as he learned to do later, but the sound of them was so
comforting to a small rabbit that he was sure his idea was right,
so when she picked him up and put him in her basket, he lay
as still as any good baby does, and he actually was fast asleep
long before Nutchen got back to her cottage.
Fnppy’s old home was in quite another part of the forest,
and he was so happy with Nutchen that he never tried to go
back to his mother, but stayed with Nutchen till he grew up
big enough to be able to help her in all sorts of ways.
CHAPTER 3
SoME miles from Nutchen's cottage, on the edge of
the forest, lived one of the foresters. He had a snugly built
stone house, with a beautiful front garden of flowers, while at
V / \ «\ i 1 i r . i 1 _ _ C ‘a a
the back of the house were many fruit trees,
and a large kitchen garden, of which he was
very proud.
All this back part was plainly to be seen
by three young rabbits who lived in a hutch
placed against the wall of the woolshed.
There was Tuppy, a saucy black
and white rabbit, and her two
beautiful sisters, Tnnka and Dnna, who
both had long white fur and large pink
They belonged to


PAGE TEN
Michael the forester's young son, who fed them daily on
potato peelings, bran, and greens from the hedgerows. Little
did he know how his pets yearned to nibble the tender let'
tuces, the juicy young carrots and the other tempting
vegetables growing so near, and yet so far from reach.
On his trips to the gypsies’ camp, Fnppy had to pass the
forester’s lodge, and, if no humans were in sight, he would hop
over to the hutch and talk to the rabbits inside about the
happy, carefree life he lived in the forest.
One beautiful day he came lolloping along at his usual
pace. This time he had a companion. Chips, the squirrel, tired
of playing with the mice, had come to see the rabbits Fnppy
had told him about. When he saw them, so different from
the drab brown woodland bunnies, he stared and stared at the
long white silky coats, and the pink eyes of Trina and Dnna.
He was not a very polite little squirrel, and stood so long with
his mouth open that Fnppy became cross at his i ude behaviour,
and scolded him for his lack of manners. Chips was quite
downcast, and did his best to make amends by performing trick
to amuse everyone. He raced up and down the trees, peeped
round the trunks, and jumped from limb to limb, then down on
to the hutch and up again like a bouncing ball. In jumping
on to the hutch, however, he happened to unlatch the door
which swung wide open.
In a flash Tuppy had sprung out, and made straight for
the radishes. Tnnka, who followed her lead, scampered quickly
to the lettuces, but Drina was timid, and
only put her little pink wriggling nose out
of the doorway. After sniffing carefully
around, she drew back inside the hutch, too
scared to venture out. Longingly she gased
at her bolder sisters, her big eyes bulging and
her heart wildly beating with excite^
ment, but still not able to summon up
enough courage to jump out
and join them.


PAGE ELEVEN
Fnppy saw that she was afraid, and brought her some fat
carnation buds and a few sprigs of parsley to nibble, before he
hopped along to join the others. They were now at the
asparagus bed, and in the munch, munch, munch of their
nimbly working little jaws, the tender asparagus tips, the pride
of the forester’s heart, disappeared as if by magic. Then carrots,
radishes, crisp lettuces and many other delicious young plants
all in turn were sampled, until at last they had not room for
one more single leaf. being greedy, had pulled out far
more radishes than she could eat, and left them lying round on
the ground with little bits nibbled out of them here and there.
She had even tried to sample the raspberries, and had stood on
tip-toe to reach them, only to get her pink nose pricked for her
trouble.
Never had the world seemed so exciting and lovely to
Tnnka and Tuppy as they gambolled in the sunshine with
Fnppy and Chips. Scampering, jumping into the air, and
thumping the ground with their strong hind feet, they revelled
in their freedom, while Chips, chattering madly, raced up and
down the trees, showing off all his best tricks.
CHAPTER 4
this moment a red and gold horse-drawn caravan,
driven by Anna, a gypsy girl, rumbled slowly down the lane
beside the house. Anna was about twelve years old and very
clever at training animals. Her sharp eyes spied the rabbits
playing in the garden, and when the caravan
passed behind a high hedge where it could
not be seen from the house, she pulled it
to a standstill and

jumped to the ground,
hedge, she watched for


PAGE TWELVE
She was worried for the safety of her sisters, so drummed
on the floor of the hutch as a warning to them to return.
Trinka and Tuppy reluctantly lolloped slowly back, and mads
ready to jump inside the hutch. Oh dear, now they were in a
fix. The door was so high up that, no matter how they tried,
they could not quite manage to scramble inside. Fnppy and
Chips tried to help, but it was no use, they were out, and there
they had to stay. Hurry, dears! Hurry!' 1 said Dnna.
There s a gypsy girl behind the hedge waiting to pounce on
you. 11 “Oh, whatever shall we do? 11
For some time clouds had been gathering, as though it
might rain, and now, to make matters worse, heavy drops
pattered around and quickly became a downpour. Lightning
flashed in a summer thunderstorm, and in no time they were
all soaking wet. Trinka and Tuppy started to shiver and sneeze,
and their teeth chattered with the cold.
“Bob my tail, 11 exclaimed Fnppy, “What shall we do,
Chips? 11
I know, said the squirrel. We will shelter among the
cabbages while you run and fetch Nutchen to come to the
rescue. 11
And so it was arranged, and, quick as a flash, off Fnppy
went on his way through the forest to the part where he
knew Nutchen was gathering wild fruits and berries.
Soon he was telling her of the trouble Trinka and Tuppy
were in, and of the gypsy girl waiting to pounce on
them. Promptly she set out with him through the
dripping forest to their aid. Felicity, the white
mouse, was curled up snug and secure in one of her
pockets, and Rik'Rak, the lizard, climbed on to her
umbrella, because he liked the rain, and also because
from up there he could see all that was happening.
After a while the heavy summer
shower ceased, and sunlight glinting
through the treetops on to the dripping
ferns and wild flowers, clothed them
in a million sparkling diamonds

Irinka was still safely hidden inside a large c
:abbage.


PAGE FOURTEEN
As Nutchen pushed on through the rain-drenched bushes
and bracken, her clothes became soaked and her stout little
boots were covered in the mud of the tracks made by the deer
and other wild folk.
As she passed along, toiling moles, pushing their muddy
noses through the soft earth, paused in their labour long enough
to wave busy paws in greeting. A noisy blue jay, full of wood-
land gossip, flew to perch on her shoulder, but Nutchen was
too intent on her errand to give an ear to his chatter, so scold-
ingly he flew away to seek a friend with more time to spare.
As they came over the hill which overlooked the keeper’s
house, they could see the gypsy girl creeping stealthily around
in the garden. Before they were able to stop her, Anna
pounced on Tuppy, and, holding her closely, carried her to the
caravan, and quickly put her inside. Then she jumped into the
driver’s seat, and, whipping the drowsy old horse to a lumber-
ing canter, drove the caravan out of sight in the direction of
the gypsy camp.
Nutchen and Fnppy hurried to the garden, and were
relieved to find that Tnnka at least was still safely hidden inside
a large cabbage. Chips, of course, was seated' in the branches
of an apple tree, from where he had scolded and chattered in
vain at the gypsy girl. Drma, hidden in the back of the rabbit
hutch, was most upset by the loss of her sister, and she and
Tnnka, their pink eyes misty with tears, begged Nutchen to
do all she could to save Tuppy. There was no one at the
forester s home to tell of their loss, so Nutchen, promised to do
her best. Gently lifting Tnnka back into the
hutch, she kissed both bunnies “Good-bye” on
S the top of their silky heads, and hurried away
through the long evening shadows towards
the gypsy camp.
and Chips were reluctant to
leave their friends, and stayed
by the hutch talking to the two
white rabbits.


PAGE FIFTEEN
Her freedom during the afternoon had put ideas into
Tnnka’s head. She thought how nice it would be to escape
and join Nutchen’s pets in the forest home. Fnppy, of course,
was happy at the thought that he might have his friend for
always, and begged her to come. Dnna was asked if she
would come along also, but she was timid, and feared the free'
dom of the large world; besides, she was Michael’s most loved
pet, and knew he would miss her even more sadly than her
sisters, so she would not consent. Finally Tnnka gave up
trying to persuade her, and decided to go with or without her.
Asking Chips to open the door again, she jumped out for the
last time, and joined her friends for the long tramp back to
Nutchen’s cottage.
As they passed along the forest glades the setting sun
threw a golden glow over the world, turning the greenwood
into a beautiful fairy land, and lighting a rosy path for their
happy little feet. Merrily they tripped along, playing and leap-
mg in the sunset light. Tnnka’s mind was filled with hopes of
the happy days to come, in Nutchen’s care, and any fears she
had had for the safety of Tuppy were pooh-poohed by Fnppy.
who assured her that Nutchen would see that no harm came
to Anna’s captive.
CHAPTER 5
In the fast darkening night, gloomy shadows gathered
under the big trees; stealthy movements and scratchings told
of tiny prowlers astir about their nightly business of living.
Here and there faint specks and sparkles of light showed where
glow-worms and fox fire lived in the damp undergrowth. Under
cover of darkness, Nutchen crept stealthily forward as she
came close to the gypsy camp,
until at last she could see right
into the little clearing in which
the caravans were parked. Most
of them showed no lights, only
in one or two were there any

Irinka made tea for them all, while Frippy and Chip gathered mushrooms.

signs of activity, but in the centre of the camp things were
very different. Here blazed a great campTre, it dancing light
throwing a red glow over the entire clearing. Round this fire
were gathered almost all the gypsy folk. White teeth shone,
and eyes gleamed in the warm glare, as they sang and laughed
and clapped their hands and feet in time to the wild music of
violins, played by three or four of the gaily dressed menfolk.
Another of their number, whom Nutchen knew to be Beppo,
the leader of the gypsy tribe, was trying to teach a baby bear
to dance. It had been caught only a day or two before, and
was still wild, and very scared and angry. It snapped and
growled continually at Beppo, who poked at it with a stout
stick, and tugged and jerked on the chain by which he held it
fettered.
Nutchen's heart ached for the poor captive, and she
resolved that she would try and help it when an opportunity
arose, but at present she had another task to finish. It would
not be easy to get Tuppy away from Anna; it might even be
dangerous if Anna called on the excited gypsies to prevent
Nutchen freeing an animal stolen by one of the tribe. Great
care was necessary, and Nutchen stole silently through the
shadows to examine the caravans. The first three showed no
light, and proved, on closer search, to stand empty and with
open doors, with no signs of a captive rabbit. The fourth one,
standing a little apart from the others, showed a glimmer of
lampdight through its windows. It was a handsome caravan,
showily painted in red and yellow, with gilded scroll work
ornaments over its door and windows.
,1 ,*o. x In thef
golden
these hung curtains of red silk with
tassels, hiding the interior, and
as the door was closed Nutchen felt
that now the time had come to take
chances. Cautiously she crept closer,
keeping in the shadows until she was
able to dart up the steps and open the
door very quietly and slowly.


PAGE NINETEEN
Now she could hear a quaint little tune that before had
been drowned by the noise made by the gypsies round the
fire. Inside, someone was playing a jig on a mouth organ, such
a merry, merry jig it was, and there was the quaintest
"Thumpity, ThumpTThump'Thump,” in time to its lilt. Then
the music stopped and a girlish voice cried; “Oh, you darling
little rabbit, I could kiss you for that, 1 ' and a merry laugh rang
out in happiness. Nutchen pushed the door gently open and
peeped inside. There, with her elbows on a small table, sat
Anna, the gypsy girl; her mouth organ was lying on the table,
and she was holding Tuppy with both hands, cuddling her
closely under her chin. Tuppy was tricked out in a blue silk
sash, and had tiny red dancing shoes on her feet, and a little
red ear-ring on each long ear. She wriggled out of Anna s
hands and stood upright on the table thumping with one foot
as though to say; “Come on! Come on quickly! I want to
dance some more.” Anna started to play again, but as Nutchen
stepped into the caravan she dropped the mouth organ, and,
seizing Tuppy, held her fast in her arms. Then, jumping to her
feet, she called out excitedly, and all in one breath; “You shan t
have her! I love her, and she’s mine and she loves me you
can’t take her away and she doesn’t want to go.’’ Nutchen
was very happy to hear the love in her voice, and smilingly
said; “My dear, if she loves you, no one will want to separate
you. We only want to be sure that she will be well cared for
and happy, and I can see that you love her and will look after
her. Will you play again for me, please?”
Anna was wildly happy at the thought that she might
keep Tuppy, and that Nutchen would not take
her away. She put the little rabbit back on
the table, and, taking her mouth organ, played
the merry tune till the little house on
wheels seemed to sway with music and
laughter. After a while, Nutchen, putting
a hand on Anna’s arm, said: “It is
time I was going, but I can go now


The slippers were too big for him.
gladly and tell Tuppy's sisters that she has found someone who
will lovingly care for her always, Should you ever want my
help, Anna, remember to tell the wild rabbits that you need
me. They will pass on the news one to another like wildTre,
till it reaches my ears, and I will come to your aid wherever
you are/' So saying, she kissed Anna and, picking


PAGE TWENTY'ONE
up Tuppy, stroked her long, silken ears in farewell. Then she
slipped quietly and quickly out of the caravan. None of the
gypsies saw her, and Anna never told anyone of her visit, or
from where she had got the beautiful black and white rabbit.
The rising moon lighted Nutchen s way back through the
forest, and quite soon she was at her own house. There she
was not very surprised to find Trmka with the others, for she
had half expected something of the sort, and gladly accepted
her as one of the family.
“First of all, though,” she said, “you and Fnppy must go
and tell Dnna all about Tuppy,” and she told them what had
happened, and, word for word, all that had been said, making
them repeat it until they were quite sure they had it right.
Then, “Off you go,” she said. “Hurry up and tell Drina, and
make her happy. Then race back here, for it’s long past bed-
time, and we have such a lot to do in the morning.”
Away they galloped, over the moonlit forest carpet, away
to Drina in her safe hutch. Breathlessly they poured out
their story, interrupting each other, and gabbling excitedly
so that she could hardly make head or tail of the story. At
last, however, all was made clear, and Drina and Trinka kissed
“Good-bye” through the bars of the hutch. “Ell be seeing
you sometimes, Drina,” cried Trinka. “We’ll all come to see
you. Good-bye.”
CHAPTER 6
so that night there was a new member of the
family. It was cold, so Nutchen sat in
her large armchair in front of a blazing
fire, nursing Trinka on her lap, while
Frippy poured tea for them. Chips and
the mice, down in the work-basket, had
a squabble over some nuts, but they
quietened down when Nutchen started
to tell them tales of the forest, and
how she had come to live in the cot-
tage many, many years ago.


PAGE TWENTY 'TWO
As Nutchen told them stories, while making clothes for
Tnnka, who had heard all about Tuppy's new finery, the big
clock tick-tocked away the quiet moments. Too-Hoo, the big
owl sat blinking on top of the case, his usual perch at night
until he was put out to go home. After being out all night,
and going to bed at daybreak, he used to sleep all day in a hole
in a big tree, till he woke at sunset and came to the kitchen to
greet his friends.
All too soon Nutchen said: “No more stories to-night.
All off to bed/' So, tired but happy, each pet sought out its
usual sleeping place, and quickly all was quiet.
Fnppy and Trinka slept side by side on the carpet in front
of the fire-place, ready to dash out at the first peep of dawn
through the hole cut in the door, and roam in the forest for
fresh green grass and tender leaves. Trinka soon tired of the
wild fare, and much preferred to return to Nutchen's bread
and milk which she prepared every morning for her friends.
Next day, after helping clean up and sweep out the cot-
tage, they played till late afternoon; when Nutchen, who had
been busy making medicines, called them in, saying they would
all go to her secret store to bring back a needed supply of dried
roots. The gypsies were very anxious to get more of her
remedies before they went away. They had taken every
bottle she had in stock, and asked for many more.
The store house was some distance away from the cottage,
and Fnppy, clad in .his blue coat, dashed away ahead, this
time with Trinka, in her new dress, as his com-
panion, while Kraak sailed along overhead. Sud-
denly they were alarmed by a loud scream from
Kraak. Both froze still and watchful, ears
erect to catch the slightest sound, and noses
quivering and wriggling as they tested each
breeze and sorted out the many scents.
Nothing could they find to cause any scare,
but they waited for Kraak to come back
and tell them what had made him sound
the alarm.
In a few moments, over the trees
glided Kraak, and down, like a falling
rocket, to alight beside them.


PAGE TWENTY-THREE
“There are a couple of gypsies hidden up the hillside
above the path to the cave,'' said he. They must be waiting
to spy on Nutchen. Fnppy thought for a moment, and then
he and Kraak arranged a plan to outwit the spies.
As the waiting gypsies crouched behind bushes before
their eyes suddenly strolled a fine fat rabbit. He gave no sign
of knowing that they were there. Only just out of reach he
stopped and nibbled a blade of grass. There would be plent\
of time, they thought, to catch him and then spy on Nutchen.
but he moved on a yard or two just as they were about to
pounce. Eagerly they moved forward, only to find him again
out of reach, and so Fnppy, for Fnppy it was, of course, led
them to where years ago an old stone quarry had oeen dug
out of the hillside. To-day it was covered with bushes and
brambles so that no one, who did not know of its presence,
could have told it was there. This was a new part of the
forest to the gypsies, and they had no idea of what was in
store for them. At the edge of the quarry Fnppy stopped.
At once they rushed down from both sides to catch him.
All in a moment many things happened. The gypsies
grabbed at the rabbit, but Fnppy was ready, and hopped over
the edge where he knew there was a little ledge just big
enough to hold him. Their hands grasped at empty air, they
lost their balance, and then, as they clutched at the bushes
to save themselves, with a whirr of swift wings, Kraak dived
right into their dismayed faces. His big wings flapped like
whips in their eyes, his scream was enough to scare the bark
off the trees, and in their panic the two men had no chance
t-n c themselves. Backwards, down and over
to save themselves. Backwards, down and over
they went, right through the prickles and sticks,
rolling down the steep bank, bruising and scratch'
ing themselves, and finishing up with a splash in
the slimy, muddy, water, that had collected at
the bottom of the quarry, and which was used
as a wallow by the wild pigs of the j
forest. By the time they had man' r\j
aged to struggle out, our friends

chen. She laughed at their tale and praised them for their
bravery and cleverness. Tnnka was speechless with admira'
tion. She had taken no part in the scheme, but had sat, silent
and trembling, hidden under a log from where she had been
able to see all that happened. Several times she had felt like
running away, but had stayed to see what Frippy was going
to do, and now he was her hero, and she was quite sure that
there was nothing he could not do. Frippy, of course, had
told her many tales of his wonderful adventures, and if, per'
haps, he made himself appear to be rather more brave and
clever than he really was, well, we all do that at times, don’t we?
Nutchen led the way to the cave by a different path, and
soon they were hard at work by the light of the lantern she
kept there. Trinka was very curious about all the strange
things stored in neat rows along the floor of the cave, and
asked many questions as to what would be done with the
queer looking roots and bundles of dried herbs. As they
worked, Nutchen told her about the medicines and salves she
made, and stories about the people that had been cured by
their use, and how once a year she went to sell her wares at
the distant market town, where nobody knew whence she
came or where she went.
Another story she told about the gnomes who had made
the cave long years ago, and how she had been given the use
of it by them when they went away, and so had come to live
in the cottage to help the little creatures of the forest.
While they talked they also worked steadily, and later
Trinka made tea for them all, while Frippy and Chips gathered
many of the big mushrooms that grew in a nearby clearing.
They all loved mushrooms for tea,
and those you gather yourself taste
twice as nice as the bought ones,
don’t they?
After the refreshing cup of tea,
they all loaded up with their various
bundles ready to set off. Nut'
chen carefully arranged the moss
and twigs that hid the door of
the cave, and Kraak was sent
soahead as a scout to make sure
that there were no

Beppo lifted Irinka from the trap
spies in the forest. Soon he screamed three times quickly, the
signal for “all clear,” and they started for home, tired but
happy because of the good work they had done, and so glad
that Nutchens secrets had not been revealed to those who
would rob her. CHAPTER 7
A. DAY or two after the adventure with the spies,
Frippy and Tnnka met Anna coming through the forest to


PAGE TWENTY'SIX
visit Nutchen. She was carrying Tuppy, who was glad to see
her sister and her old friend Fnppy, so Anna put her down
while she went inside the cottage to talk to Nutchen.
You can imagine all the excited chatter that went on,
each trying to tell the other all that had happened since the
day in the forester’s garden, but soon Tuppy started to show
off her new accomplishment of dancing, and Fnppy was wild
to learn and to wear slippers as she did. There were some
little blue slippers in a cupboard in the cottage, so he slipped
quietly in and got them, and soon he was prancing and
twisting under Tuppy’s directions. The slippers were too big
for him, and kept falling off and tripping him, and naughty
Tuppy taught him kicking steps that sent his precious slippers
flying for yards, so that he had to run and put them on after
nearly every step. This made Tuppy laugh, and she had to
turn away so that he should not see how he amused her, but
Tnnka saw, and was cross because Tuppy made fun of her
friend Frippy. To tell the truth, Tnnka was a bit jealous, and
she left them hopping and skipping, and wandered off on her
own to show Frippy that he was not the only rabbit who
could have adventures.
That was a silly sort of rabbity thing to do, and she got
more adventure than she bargained for. As you might expect,
being a tame bunny and not at home in the forest, she soon
lost her way, and wandered round, bewildered and forlorn, till
dusk. Then, in the evening light she saw a nice piece of
carrot lying on the ground. She did not stop to think that
carrots do not grow in forests; her hunger and inexperience led
her into making a great mistake. Happily she hopped forward;
just one more step to go to get the carrot, but SNAP!
went the trap that was hidden, and the cold, hard steel jaws
had poor Tnnka by the paw, hurting her dreadfully, and
causing her to scream with pain. Screaming was no good,
nor could she wriggle her foot out of the
trap, though she
tried and tried. Night came and creepy
noises stirred among the bushes, bringing
‘fear of unknown dangers to her. Suddenly
she spied a light in the far
distance. Brighter it grew as


PAGE TWENTY'SEVEN
though it was being carried closer. “Oh, goody, goody, she
thought. “They have come to find me, and she squealed
again to show them where she was.
But poor Tnnka was wrong again; she was not being
rescued, and the person carrying the lantern knew quite well
where to find the trap, though he did not know who or what
was in it. And well he might know where it was, for he him'
self had set it there, and placed the carrot to catch some un'
wary one.
Beppo it was, the head man of the gypsies; he who had
had the baby bear at the camp, and had also been one of
those who fell into the quarry. A rabbit he had hoped to
catch, but now he had one of Nutchen’s pets, and he shouted
with evil glee because now he could be revenged on Nutchen
and her pets who had made a fool of him. He was not a nice
man, Beppo, and as he stood and looked at her by the light
of the lantern he earned, he made all kinds of nasty plans for
Tnnka.
He had Sardi, the baby dancing bear with him, and had
been making her dance at a village some miles away. She was
tired and cross, and Beppo was careless in his glee, so it came
about that he tied her up carelessly before he set himself down
to loose the trap.
Then, as he knelt bending over Tnnka, and lifted her
from the trap, Sardi, who had been able to bite the rope that
held her, saw her chance to escape from his hated bondage,
and, charging madly at his bended back, knocked him flying,
topsyturvy, head first into the hole in which he had hidden
the trap. Taken by utter surprise, Beppo let go of Trinka's
ears, and before you could have said “Scat,” she was away out
of his reach, and, in spite of her painful, bleeding paw, quickly
got out of the reach of his lantern light. How furious was
Beppo! He had lost his baby bear, |
the captured white rabbit, and his | i
chance of revenge;
Sardi’s charge had

knocked the breath out of his body, and his head was
bruised where it had bumped hard on the steel trap. He lost
his temper, and, like some children who ought to know better,
he thought to relieve his feelings by kicking.
This was unlucky for him, for he kicked the bundle that
he had put down when he knelt to get Tnnka, and, while
the bundle was light and would not have hurt him, he did
not see the large rock behind it, and the violent kick he gave


PAGE TWENTY-NINE
it nearly broke his big toe. That made him still madder with
rage, and he kicked the lantern with his good foot. Naturally
the lantern went out, and Beppo spent all the mg to g
round, lost in the forest until daylight showed him where he
Trinka, lying still meanwhile under some sheltering bushes,
licked her wounded foot till it felt better, and she was able
to sleep. Sardi had climbed a tree nearby, and was fast asleep
in the crook of a limb, dreaming gay dreams of freedom.
Next morning, Trinka set out to find her way home.
Soon she passed into a clearing and found sweet grass and
clover, on which she made her breakfast, for there had been
nothing to eat under the big trees. As she was nibbling she
heard a queer noise on the edge of the clearing. oo un B
to stop eating, she kept a watchful eye and an alert ear cocked
in that direction. The sound went on, but nothing showed,
and her curiosity became greater as her appetite became
satisfied
Soon she was scouting very cautiously towards the place
where the noise came from. Such a funny noise, like a pig
eating from a trough, gruntmgs and slobbenngs and little
squeals of pleasure. There was another noise, too; a sort ot
loud buzzing like a hundred blowflies on a window pane,
and a regular “Smack'thump’ going on all the time. Her
nose twitching with excitement, Trinka put her head round
a tree, and nearly fell backwards with surprise at what she saw.

look that Sardi started to giggle, and the giggling, on top of
too much honey, gave her the hiccoughs. Tnnka was at
first offended at being laughed at, but soon she, in turn,
was laughing at the sight of the fat brown roly-poly giggling
hiccoughing baby bear, and both of them laughed and laughed
till their sides ached and the tears rolled from their eyes. After
that they just had to be friends, and when Sardi showed her
friendship by licking Tnnka’s face, there was nearly as much
honey as love in the lick, and Trinka thought what a sweet
nature she must have! They played tag together, scampering
through the long grass and undergrowth, and splashing through
the tiny stream that ran whispering through the clearing.
When they tired of this they sat down to rest before
setting out for home. Trinka made a daisy chain which she
hung round Sardi’s neck, and Sardi was so pleased that she
stood and looked at her reflection in the pool till Trinka
became impatient.
“Come along, you vain thing," she cried. “It's time we
were on our way back to Nutchen's home. She'll look after
you and hide you from Beppo."
Sardi liked that idea, and as she knew the forest much
better than Trinka did, she was quite sure she could find the
way. Off they set, Sardi in the lead, all eagerness to find the
new home where loving care awaited her. She was too eager
for Trinka, who was not used to long trips, and soon got out
of breath and begged to rest.
“Why, you silly little one," said Sardi. “Hop up on
my back and ride." This pleased Trinka, who sat up proudly,
holding on to the daisy chain while Sardi cantered along so
gently that Trinka was never in danger of falling off.

there had been great
distress at the cottage when 1 rinka failed
to return, and Nutchen and each of the
pets had been out searching far and wide
, till nightfall, when Too' Hoo took up the
, search. Pm afraid he had not been much
use, however, because he had a lady
owl friend in quite another part of
the forest, and had easily
persuaded himself that Trinka


PAGE THIRTY-ONE
was sure to be somewhere in that direction. Also, he had spent
more time with his friend than searching for the lost one, and
had been too far away to hear her cries when trapped, so on
his return just before dawn had nothing to report.
After a hasty and sad breakfast, Nutchen and the pets,
with sorrowing hearts, took up the search again. Tuppy and
Frippy, most of all, were unhappy, for they knew why Trinka
had gone off in the sulks, and they felt a little bit guilty about it.
Nutchen divided the party into pairs, and sent each
couple in a different direction, telling them to call at intervals,
and wait for a reply. One of each pair was to come back
at midday to report, and hear what the others had done.
Chips and Felicity, one of the white mice, had been sent
in the direction from which it happened that Trinka and Sardi
were coming, and late in the morning they were overjoyed to
see the queer steed with its proud rider come prancing
through the trees. Trinka called and waved to Chips, and
when Sardi understood that she was with friends, she started
to dance, twisting and turning while Trinka sat bolt upright
holding tightly on to her daisy chain, while all the wild rabbits
of the district sat goggle-eyed with amazement to see the
strange sight.
Sardi soon became acquainted with her new friends and,
after Chips had stopped scolding, which he did always when
excited, they set off again to give the good news to the others.
By nightfall all were safely gathered in again at Nutchen’s
cottage, weary but rejoicing at the happy ending of Tnnka’s
adventure, and glad to greet a new member of the family.
Anna and Tuppy hurried back to the gypsy camp,
promising faithfully not to tell Beppo that they knew where
Sardi was, and all the pets gathered round the fire at tea time,
sleepy, but demanding to hear everything that had happened
to Trinka and Sardi
How the pets cheered when Trinka
told of how Sardi had bowled Beppo
over; and how they rocked with
laughter when Sardi told how he

stone, and then in his temper had kicked the lamp. Chips
was very fond of honey, and smacked his lips at the story o
the honey, and privately made up his mind to go to that tree
sometime to see if he could manage to get some for himse .
At last, all the tale was told and retold, and one by one the
pets’ eyes closed in sleep as they curled up beside the warm blaz,e.
Early next morning Nutchen took Sardi to a safe hiding
place, where she could stay till Beppo had gone away, and all
made great haste to make up all the medicine the gypsies
wanted, so that they would quickly take their departure. After
they had gone, not to be back for another six months, Sardi
came to live at the cottage, and soon she was growing so big
that she could hardly get through the door and had to sleep
in the woodshed.
The pets had many adventures in the lovely forest, and
made many friends of the dwellers of the woods, both great
and small. Sometime I will write more of these adventuies,
and about Nutchen, and how she came to live in the cottage,
and became the friend of all the creatures of the wild, but
just now we must leave them all for a while; Nutchen
continuing her loving care of the injured, and her
pets enjoying lives of safety and freedom in the
heart of the great forest
