THE CAT,
ETC., ETC.
Tiibre are useful and interesting little -volumes
published upon the natural histories of “ The
Dog,” “The Pig,” “The Cow,” and other animals.
The authoress of this work, having in vain sought
a similar work upon “The Cat,” an animal to
which she is herself very partial, she has deter-
mined to take up her pen on the subject, for the
benefit of those who have the same regard for the
Cat; regretting to be obliged to conclude, from
such an omission, that the Cat is not now con-
sidered w r orthy of notice, or its life worth pre-
serving.
The Almighty formed “ every creature for the
service of man,” and with the gift of dominion over
every living thing, it became man’s duty, as well
as his interest, to study and investigate their
capacities to serve him ; and in return for these
services, it was surely meant that he should also


study their diseases, attend to their comforts, and
not ill use them.
All creatures, in their different structures, are
“fearfully and wonderfully made,” and all ought,
therefore, to be worthy of the study, and interest-
ing to the only one, with a mind to appreciate
those wonders—the most noble of all the created
beings—Man.
Cats appear to have been known in every
country from time immemorial; to the Chinese,
Persians, and Hindoos, They were domesticated
with the Egyptians, Phoenicians, Homans, Jews,
and Greeks. They are admitted by some of these
nations into their Mythology; and they are proved
to have been regarded in a very different light to
what they now are, for we read that “ In Egypt
the cat was held in the greatest veneration; and
that when it died a natural death, it was actually
mourned for with demonstrations of grief ap-
pointed for the event; and that if the death were
caused by malice, the murderer was condemned
to be given over to the rabble to be buffeted to
death.”
Moncrieff mentions, “ That an insult offered to
a cat by a Homan was once the cause of an insur-
rection among the Egyptians, even when the fact
of their own vanquishment could not excite them
to rebel.” And it is also recorded, “ That Cam-


byses, who succeeded bis father, Cyrus, as King' of
Persia, about the year 530, availing himself of the
regard of the people for their favorite animals,
when he invaded Egypt to punish Amasis for an
affront, made himself master of Pelasis, which had
before successfully resisted his arms. The stra-
tagem he adopted was certainly an ingenious one ;
he gave a live cat to each of his soldiers instead of
a buckler; and the Egyptian soldiers, rather than
destroy these objects of .their veneration, suffered
themselves to be conquered.” This regard of the
Egyptians for cats was extended even beyond the
lives of the animals, for we know that caves have
been discovered filled with their bones and skele-
tons ; and that even embalming and making them
into mummies, to preserve their jemains, were
resorted to ; which process being very tedious and
troublesome, and most likely expensive also, proves
beyond any doubt the high estimation in which
they were held by that nation.
The Turks maintained large establishments of
cats at the public expense. Baumgarten, when he
visited Damascus, informs us, “ That he saw there
an hospital for cats. The building was very large,
and surrounded by'a wall, and was said to be filled
with inmates.” On inquiring into the origin of
this strange institution, he was informed “that
Mahomed, when he had once lived there, brought


with him a favorite cat, which he kept in the
sleeve of his garment, and carefully fed with his
own hands, taking off his sleeves rather than dis-
turb the repose of his pet; therefore his followers
paid superstitious respect to these animals, and
supported them in this manner by public alms,
which were found adequate to the purpose.” They
did not allow any cats to be destroyed, and they
even made it a penal offence to do so. It is to be
supposed they did not multiply so rapidly in that
country as they do in this, or their numbers could
not have been maintained.
There are other records in history of cats being
more generally and highly esteemed in former days
than they are at the present time, for we read,
“ That Howell the Good,” a prince of Wales, in the
year 948, instituted laws respecting them. /‘That
the price of a kitten, before it could see, was one
penny; until it caught a mouse, two pennies; and
when it commenced mousing, four pennies.” It
was then required “ to be perfect in its senses of
seeing and hearing, have all its claws perfect, and,
if a female, to be a good nurse; if the animal
failed in any of these specified qualifications, the
seller was to forfeit to the purchaser the third
part of its value,” “If any person stole the cat
that guarded the granaries of the Prince, he was to
forfeit a milch ewe, with its fleece and lamb ; or


in lieu of these, as much wheat, as when poured
upon the cat, suspended by the tail, her head
touching the floor, would form a heap high enough
to cover the tip of the former.”
Cats are recorded to have been used for other
purposes than mere catching rats and mice. The
Greek monks, in the island of Cyprus, used to
teach them (if they do not even now do so) to
catch the serpents with which that island is
infested.
In the present day, a love for cats appears
chiefly permitted to “ elderly spinsters,” and is
often even ridiculed; but persons who laugh at
these pets as unworthy, are not acquainted with
their history, either in their own or other coun-
tries, and with the characters of the celebrated
men who selected them for favorites; many of
whom, of the highest rank, and filling the most
important situations in the state, were nevertheless
not ashamed to own publicly their affection for
their favorite cats. The proud haughty Cardinal
Wolsey was accustomed to hold audiences, and
receive his guests, with his cat generally seated
on the arm of his state chair, or at the back of his
throne;. and an equally eminent statesman of
France is mentioned on one occasion as not rising
to receive an ambassador from a foreign court,
because his favorite cat and her kittens were


nestled in the train of his robes, and he could not
disturb them.
Petrarch, the great Italian poet, had his favorite
cat, which after its death, occupied embalmed a
niche in his studio. The celebrated painter,
Glodefroi Mind, who died at Berne, in the year
1814, and Avho was styled “ The Raphael of Cats,”
from his having devoted himself exclusively to the
painting of them, was unbounded in his affection
for them; and when at one time the hydrophobia
was prevailing in Berne, so that eight hundred
cats were destroyed by order of the magistrates of
the city, poor Mind was so grieved, that he is said
never completely to have been consoled. He con-
trived to hide his great favorite, Minette, until the
panic was past; and he always worked at his easel
talking to her; and was generally found with her
and her family, either on his knees or on his chair,
when his friends entered his room.
The wise and solemn Doctor Johnson, too, is
known to have had his favorite cat, which at one
time being very ill, and refusing its food, he dis-
covered was tempted to eat an oyster; conse-
quently, not trusting to the tender mercies of his
servant to feed her, he used to walk out, and
himself buy and carry home oysters, in his pocket,
to tempt her appetite, until she was quite re-
covered, and able to take her ordinary food.


The poet Gray did not deem the cat unworthy
his muse, and though the stanzas are known to
everyone of my readers, as being applicable to my
subject, they cannot be omitted,
VEESES BY GEAY
ON THE DEATH OF HIS FAVORITE CAT,
DROWNED IN A VASE OF GOLD FISHES.
’Twas on a lofty vase’s side,
Where China’s gayest arts had dyed
The azure flowers that blow,
Demurest of the tabby kind,
The pensive Selima reclined,
Gaz’d on the lake below.
The conscious maid her joy declared;
The fair round face and snowy beard,
The velvet of her paws,
Her coat that with the tortoise vies,
The ears of jet, and em’rald eyes,
She saw, and purr’d applause.
The hapless nymph with wonder saw
A whisker first, and then a claw,
With many an ardent wish;
She stretched in vain to reach the prize—
What female heart can gold despise ?
What cat’s averse to fish ?


Presumptive maid ! with looks intent,
Again she stretched, again she bent,
Nor knew the gulf between.
Malignant Fate sat by and smiled,
The slipp’ry verge her feet beguiled—
She tumbled headlong in.
Eight times emerging from the flood,
She mew'd to every watery god
Some speedy aid to send.
No dolphin came, no neriad stirr’d,
No cruel Tom nor Susan heard, —
A fav’rite has no friend.
Learn hence, ye beauties, undeceiv’d,
Know one false step is ne’er retriev’d,
And be with caution bold;
Not all that tempts your wond’ring eyes,
Nor heedless hearts, is lawful prize—
Nor all that glitters gold.
AH animals of tlie feline tribe, including the
lion, tiger, panther, leopard, &c., are distinguished
by their sharp and peculiar formidable claws, which,
concealed in a glove of velvet, they can protrude at
will. “ The footstep of the cat is noiseless, and
that of the larger animals of the species nearly so,
which renders them the more formidable, as they
creep stealthily along unheard, and when at a con-
venient distance, spring with a bound upon their
victims. Their teeth, to the number of thirty,
including the tusk, are formidable weapons, better


calculated for tearing than for masticating their
prey; for this reason they eat slowly, and generally
growl to alarm and prevent others sharing it with
them.” “They have not the swiftness of other
animals, they seize their prey hy stealth, watching
it with the most untiring patience for many hours,
often for the mere gratification of possessing it to
play with. I have frequently observed one of my
own cats seated on a low wall in the stable-yard,
watching a mouse in the straw, invisible to any eye
but her own; and in returning to the place many
hours after, have found her exactly in the same
position, and still watching with the same unabated
anxiety, certainly not prompted by hunger, as she
had regular meals. Indeed, starved cats are never
good mousers ; when eager for food, they pounce
upon their prey too soon, and consequently lose it.
They will brave wet and cold in its pursuit, though
of all animals they most like warmth and soft
warm beds to lie upon. They have naturally a
great antipathy to cold, and windy weather; wet
annoys them exceedingly, or getting their feet
damp; but nothing will deter them from the
pursuit of their victims when once bent upon their
destruction, for, notwithstanding their antipathy
to wet, I have seen a cat thrust her arm up to the
shoulder, in the coldest water, to seize a fish at
the bottom of a glass globe.


The eyes of cats are peculiarly and wonderfully
adapted to their nature. “In the eyes of man,
and in most animals, the pupils admit of a very
small degree of dilation and contraction, —dilating
in the dark, and contracting a very little when
exposed to strong light; the pupil of the cat’s eye,
which, found on examination by day to be very
narrow and small, at night expands over the whole
surface of the eye, and shines like a ball of fire;
thus beautifully and wisely adapted for the better
seeing their prey, which chiefly moves by night.
The Chinese can tell the hour of day by the eyes
of cats ; in the bright sun there is scarcely any
pupil visible at mid-day. They have a great dis-
like to some smells; but, on the contrary, have
great delight in others, and the odour of some
plants, rubbing themselves on them—such as cat-
mint, valerian, and the blue nemophilla, which
they discover at a great distance for them, for the
power of scent is not so strong as in the canine
species.
The extreme cleanliness of their habits renders
them nice household pets; and I do not agree
with Buffon, that “ the cat is a treacherous friend
to exterminate an insidious foe,” for I have found
them as capable of attachment as the dog; but
being shown in a different manner, it is not ob-
served, The dog, after a separation from his


master, immediately springs upon him, devouring
him with caresses; the cat cannot at the instant
understand its joy, it is evidently quite puzzled at
his appearance; requiring a few moments to re-
cover itself, and comprehend it, which it then
shows in its own way, creeping about him, ruhhing
itself against him, purring, and following him
closely, fearing, as it were, to lose him again.
Another recommendation is the remarkably pure
and sweet nature of the fur, to the dressing of
which they pay so much attention, that the soiling
of it to an irreparable degree, causes them to pine
away and die.
Kittens are fifty-six days before they are born,
at which time they are, like puppies, blind and
deaf, the eyelids and ears being firmly closed; and
the former, if opened, showing the power of sight
immatured. In about nine days, sometimes
sooner, sometimes later, they commence their
functions.
The untamed mother hides her kittens, but the
domesticated cat always forces them upon the
notice of her own protectors, bringing them and
anxiously recommending them to their care, and
expressing evident signs of pleasure on seeing
them caressed. It is curious to watch the mother
fetch her kittens one by one to remove them to
some place she has fixed upon for them. How


gently she carries her little treasure in her mouth!
looking carefully around to he sure that no enemy
is in sight, and then placing it down and smooth-
ing its coat. If the distance is great, she rests, as
the little burden is generally fat and heavy. The
mother nurses her progeny for a few weeks, scarcely
ever leaving them, and after that time she catches
and brings them small game, such as young mice
and birds, instructing them how to kill them. No
maternal love can exceed that of feline mothers
for their offspring; they will brave any danger in
their defence, and fight for them to their last
breath, fretting with lamentable cries for many
days if deprived of them; and frequently not for-
saking them even when dead, until they no longer
hear any resemblance to what they were. They
will also adopt and nurse the young of each other
even with their own. I had two Angora cats with
kittens at the same time, and they all occupied the
same nest; the two families were a joint concern,
and when one of the mothers went out, the other
nursed them all. One very remarkable circum-
stance I have always observed; when these fond
mothers, through illness, lose the sustenance with
which Nature has provided them for their young,
they are immediately conscious of the cause of
their cries, and become so distressed and irritated
that they invariably kill them. Kittens are gene-


rally bom in spring and autumn; male cats will
sometimes destroy them.
“ Of tbe wild cat there is supposed to be only
one species, which extends, with very trifling
variety in colour, over all parts of the world; the
differences from the tame variety is more in the
internal than in the external structure; its intes-
tines being the smallest and shortest of all the
quadrupeds. Those of the sheep, when measured,
will be found to be thirty times the length of the
body, whilst those of the wild cat will be found to
be only three times the length of it. It is sup-
posed to be common to both the old and new
continent, for when Christopher Columbus first
discovered the new, a hunter brought him one
from the woods.”* In our own climate they are
now chiefly confined to mountainous countries,
principally to the Highlands of Scotland. “ The
wild cat is larger than the tame English one,
especially its face, and this gives it a greater
appearance than it really has.” The hair is longer,
the face flatter, and the teeth and claws much
more formidable; the muscles are very strong,
being formed for rapine; the tail is of a moderate
h

so-called wild cat, but it is a marsupial animal; and the true
naturalists always call a foreign wild beast, seen for tbe first
time, after some tame animal.’'— Owen


length, but very thick and flat, marked with alter-
nate bands of black and white; the hips and hind
part of the lower joints of the legs are always
black; the fur is very soft and fine; the general
colour is a yellowish white, mixed with deep grey.
The colours, though they appear at first to be
confusedly blended together, yet on close inspec-
tion will be found to be disposed like the streaks
on the skin of the tiger, pointing from the back
downwards, and rising from a black cist that runs
from the head along the middle of the back to the
tail. It is the most destructive of all the carnivo-
rous animals in this country; it lives by day in
trees, and hunts by night. Bufibn tells us “ that
the wild cat of Spain, instead of having the colours
pale like ours, are more brought out by the climate
to be bright and marked; the yellow colour being
more red, the brown becoming black, and the grey
white; and that when transplanted to America,
they still retain their colour.” Le Perc de Tetre
tells us —then in the Antilles—“ there are a great
number of cats, which have been brought here by
the Spaniards,”
Hiertro dello Yalli evidently means the Angora
kind, when he says, “ There is in Persia a cat (par-
ticularly in the province of Choragan) of the
figure and form of our ordinary ones, but infinitely
more beautiful in the lustre and colour of its skin.


It is of a grey blue, without mixture, and as soft
and shining as silk. The tail is of great length, and
covered with hair six inches long, which the animal
throws on its back like a squirrel.” This is the exact
description of the Angora cat, only that they are
larger and do vary in colour like our own; though
the eyes, which he does not name, are generally
yellow like topaz. He further says “he purchased
a pair of them to introduce the breed into Italy.”
The Angora cat is by far the most beautiful,
gentle, and affectionate, and resembles more the
dog in intelligence and attachment to its owner.
Bosnian, in his ‘Voyage de Gurnee,’ says, “Cats
do not change like dogs when transported there;
and, though the tame cats vary in their colours,
they do not form a distinct species', and that Syria
or Choragan produces one constant sort, which is
perpetuated,” All the cats I myself saw in South
America and the islands of the West Indies were
of the poorest and smallest description, not larger
than a half-grown one of our country. Very thin,
with staring coats, and infested with vermin, —to
such an extent they were obliged to be washed to
keep them alive, Bosman also relates that “In
the province of Pe-chily, in China, there are cats
with long hair and drooping ears, which are in
great favour with the Chinese ladies:” others say
this is not a cat, but an animal called “ Samxee.”


Writing of the drooping ears, he further adds,
“ It is worthy of remark that there is in animals
evident signs of ancestry of their slavery. Long
ears, varied colours, long and fine hair, are effects
produced hy time and civilization, whilst all wild
animals have straight, round ears for instance the
wild pig, when the domestic one has ears always
inclined to fall. The ears of high-bred rabbits of
the present day also fall; but I am doubtful the
ears of cats or any of the feline race ever would
fall, as their hearing would then be less acute and
not so well suited to their habits of life.
Having now written as much as is interesting
upon the history of cats from the authority of
several learned authors, interspersed with my own
remarks and observations respecting them, I shall
proceed to write upon the management of them,
and their treatment under disease, which I have
found the most efficacious (believing no one has
yet done so) a study in which I have ever taken
interest and pleasure —the trying to alleviate, by
the best means in my power, the sufferings of
every creature formed by the Almighty hand that
made all.
Permit me to remark that no person with any
proper feeling will pamper their favorites with
unnecessary luxuries (that should be better
bestowed), and over-lavish them with caresses,


whilst they are in health and beauty, merely
because they contribute to their own vanity and
amusement; and then discard them from their
affection and even presence when they have the
misfortune to be ill and suffering ;* and because the
offices of cleanliness, in which they are in health
so strictly careful, and can no longer perform for
themselves, are obliged to be performed for them,
and are naturally not agreeable. Agreeable they
certainly are not, for all animals are fretful, and
even cross, when suffering or old; and a degree of
quiet courage and resolution is requisite to admi-
nister to their necessities. But I have always found
that I have been repaid for my trouble and annoy-
ances by the gratitude and increased attachment of
my patients of every kind, from the largest to the
smallest animals. And, after all, I have only done
my duty as a Christian, for is it not written, “ The
righteous man is merciful to his beast ?” He
“ who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb” meant
not His creatures to be ill-used or neglected by
man, for whose use they were created.
* Would I do so by thee ?


ON THE MANAGEMENT OE THE
DOMESTIC CAT.
It is a curious fact that cats will never prosper
without grass to eat! I have long observed and
been convinced of this ; and was ridiculed for my
opinion when I asserted it, even by some learned
members of the Zoological Society, who would not
believe that grass was necessary to the feline tribe
in general, or that they would even eat it, until
they witnessed the voracity with which it was
devoured after a deprivation of it for a few days.
I am perfectly certain it is essential for the main-
tenance of health and life in that species. In the
first place it cools the blood, preventing humours,
and contributes to the healthy condition of the
skin, rendering the fur fine and glossy. It has
also a material effect on the general health. Every
one must have observed the constant licking
bestowed on the coat, and the rough nature of the
tongue ? Consequently, the loose hair is conveyed
to the stomach and intestines, where it remains in
balls or long rolls, causing dulness and-loss of
appetite, and ending in death. The hair swallowed


adheres to the rough grass and is then digested, or
if the mass is too large (as is often the case in the
moulting season, especially with Angora cats), it
will he seen thrown up: long rolls of hair with
grass, perfectly exclusive of any other substance;
and the animal that a few moments previous was
dying, will now he relieved, and take its food as
usual.
Never alarm a sick animal; they are always
more nervous when ill, and fright is most pernicious.
Whatever is necessary to be done, must be done as
quietly as possible, and without talking and noise.
Sick and frightened cats always hide in dark
corners to die.


ADMINISTERING MEDICINE TO CATS.
This is a difficult process in imagination; but
easy in the performance, when undertaken with
firmness, gentleness, and courage, and without
noise.
As I previously remarked, there is no animal so
scrupulously cleanly as the eat; therefore the chief
care must be not to soil the fur with the medicine,
as it will not lick it off, and will pine away at the
smell.
Eoll gently the sick cat in a large cloth, such as
a table-cloth, carefully including all the claws of
both the front and back, so as to resemble a
mummy, leaving only the head out. Then place
it upright between the knees of a sitting person,
place another cloth under the jaw to keep that
clean, and then with a gloved hand open the mouth
wide, but gently, at one effort, holding it open and
pouring the medicine from a teaspoon down the
open throat; a very little at once, not to cause
choking; but letting it be comfortably swallowed
in very small quantities. Do not put the spoon
into the mouth, as the cat will bite it and spit out


the contents; hut pour it from the small spoon.
Then with a sponge and chilled water wipe off the
least impurity from the mouth and chin, rub it dry
with a clean cloth and unswathe the patient, and
put it in a quiet, warm, comfortable place for about
an hour and a half. Do not give food or drink
during that time, or the medicine will return again;
as in human beings, it is necessary to watch the
effect of your medicine. You must make a tem-
porary hospital of some unused, uncarpeted room,
with a fire, as warmth is half the cure, and every
creature in illness requires it more than at other
times. Have a comfortable bed for your patient,
leave a dish of water in case of thirst (where it
would not be pernicious), and do not allow any
one but yourself to enter, as quiet and sleep are
nature’s own and best remedies; without them
there is no cure.


CATS WITH KITTENS.
It is very injurious to the mother, to destroy the
whole litter, particularly at once; and if the prac-
tice is repeated, it is sure to cause cancers, a com-
plaint common to cats. Cats suffer much when
deprived of all their kittens, as may be seen by
examining them under the circumstances. They
will even nurse young rats or hedgehogs to be re-
lieved of their milk. When a litter of kittens must
all be destroyed take them away gradually one by
one, leaving a day or two between. Kittens can
be reared by hand by putting a small quantity of
brown sugar into new milk, and constantly wiping
them with a nearly dry sponge and soap and water
—to imitate the mother’s licking and saliva, which
is soapy. The sugar should always be in the same
proportion that is found to agree; plain milk is too
astringent.


DELIRIUM AND FITS
Are common to young cats just at their full growth:
most have one attack, particularly male cats.
Females are less subject to them, and never have
these complaints after they have once nursed young
ones, unless frightened into them, which all cats
easily are. An approaching attack of delirium or
fits maybe seen by a general difference of manner
in the animal, an uneasy restlessness, nervousness,
and peculiar appearance of the eye, which once
observed cannot be mistaken. It can generally be
prevented by a gentle aperient, such as you would
give a dog, only bear in mind that a much less dose
must be given, as cats cannot bear the same
quantity of medicine. Half a teaspoonful of common
salt in about two teaspoonsful of water is a good
alterative for them. When seized with delirium, a
cat rushes about suddenly, violently, its eyes wide
open and staring fearfully. It darts frequently to
a window in the first impulse, and then always
into the darkest place where it would remain and
die if not secured. If it amounts to a regular fit
(which symptoms in all subjects are alike), take a


sharp pair of scissors and slightly slit one of the
ears, but not to disfigure the cat, it must be in the
thin part of the ear. Have ready some warm
water, and hold the ear in it, gently rubbing, and
encouraging the blood to flow; a few drops give
relief. The most timid lady need not fear to per-
form this slight operation, as during the attack the
animal does not feel, nor does it resist in any way;
but I always use thick gloves in handling animals
myself, and recommend them to others. When
the attack is over, keep the cat very quiet, as you
will observe it is very nervous after, and alarmed
with the slightest sound ; and let its food be rather
less in quantity, and less nutritious in quality, until
it is past the time of fits.


DISTEMPER.
Cats have a very dangerous complaint, which I
call distemper, though it is different to the dis-
temper in dogs. I do not think it occurs more
than once; and it is well it does not, as it requires
every care and attention to save the life of the
sufferer. Sometimes it begins with constant vomit-
ing of a bright yellow frothy liquid, diarrhoea then
comes on which ends in dysentery. If you see the
yellow vomiting, give the small dose of salt and
water before named, in this case it will act as an
emetic. When the stomach it cleared, then, as the
vomiting will continue from irritation, and reduce
the strength to the last degree* very painful to
witness, stop it as soon as you can, by giving half a
teaspoonful of melted beef marrow, free from skin;
one dose is generally sufficient, hut if it is not
another half-spoonful may be given in half an hour.
To allay vomiting from irritation I have never seen
this simple remedy fail in either the human or
animal subject, I have tried it upon all species of
carnivorm with equal success; the former should
take it upon toast with salt without pepper, over-
coming the great repugnance it causes in sickness.


DIARRHŒA.
Cats of all ages are very subject to this complaint,
and its existence may be suspected before it is
actually proved, by any casual observer, by the signs
of a neglected toilette, staring coat, dull eyes, and
the animal becoming gradually more thin; the evil
will not cure itself, and the sufferer will die of that,
or its attendant dysentery, which is still more
obstinate to overcome. In the commencement
give new milk, with mutton suet melted into it;
the proportion of a piece of nice fresh suet without
skin, the size of a large walnut, to a teacupful of
milk. Keep the cat warm and quiet in a comfort-
able nest; and if it is too ill to lap give it every
two hours a teaspoonful of the mixture only just
warm enough to melt the suet; put it gently into
the mouth with a small spoon; you need not
swathe the cat, as after the first spoonful is settled
it will feel the benefit and swallow another; but
do not give much, it is better to give very little
that will remain and do good, than a larger quantity,
which will return. Treat the complaint in other
ways as in a human subject. Observe if there is
no bile, and if there is not, give to a full-grown cat


a grain and a half of the grey powder (Album, cum
Greta) used in similar cases. As I before observed,
you must watch the effect of your remedy, as the
complaint may change at once; if it does not, and
there is still no bile, give, in about two hours,
another dose.
If the diarrhoea continue give a teaspoonful of
chalk mixture used for the same complaint in
human beings, with seven or eight drops of tinc-
ture of rhubarb, and four or five of laudanum, every
few hours until it does. Cats will continue as
ill as possible for a few days, their eyes even fixed;
but still with watching and care can be cured. A
teaspoonful of pure meat gravy at a time should be
given now and then (but not until near two hours
after medicine) to keep up the strength until appe-
tite returns; then be careful what food you give,
and in small quantities at a time, as the digestion
will be weak.
Flies are very pernicious to cats; they make

CAT-POX.
A disease like chicken-pox in human subjects
will sometimes appear in spring and autumn,
chiefly on the throat and head, causing incessant
itching as well as the hair to fall off. Give the cat
cooling diet and plenty of grass. Eub the spots
with flour of brimstone mixed with as much as you
can possibly rub into fresh hog’s lard without salt;
besides doing good to the eruption, the cat will
lick it and swallow some, which will assist the
cure.
I have now written all that would be interesting
or useful on the subject of cats; and I have acceded
to the wishes of numerous friends who have applied
to me, saying—My poor puss is so ill! and I cannot
find any work upon Cats. Do tell me what I must
do for it ?
