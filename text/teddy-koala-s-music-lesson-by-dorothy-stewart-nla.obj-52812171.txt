One of the teacher** greatest problems is to fiad selections like “Witches at Midnight" which
are interesting musically and interpretatively, while consistently maintaining technical simplicity.
This attractive number offers a fine tone picture which the young beginner can fully comprehend and
adequately express. Based on two simple five-finger positions, this characteristic little selection is
developed most effectively through easy hand crossings.
