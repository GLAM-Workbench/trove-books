of undulations seawards, through fertile ground, watered by a

be found within its boundaries. Two curious rocks, named
the Bishop and Clerk, end the topmost ridge to the north,
and seem for ever gazing over the expanse of placid sea that


stretches between Maria and Sellouten Island. In the recesses
of the forests the aborigines lived and roamed in idle freedom,
unburdened by modern civilisation, and unfettered by con-
ventionality, Knowing nothing of white men, they did not
fear them ; and happy in their island home, desired no in-
trusion from a race that, although they did not know it,
would eventually drive them from the homes and the tombs
of their ancestors. The eminent French naturalist, M. Pcron,
visited the island in 1802, and discovered some very curious
tombs constructed by the natives. His account of the island,
its resources, climate, productions, and inhabitants, is of
sufficient interest to be reproduced. He says:
On the 18th of February, 1802, about 5 p.m,, we dropped
anchor over against Oyster Bay, in the channel which lies
between Yan Diemen’s Land and Maria Island. At day-
break, on the 19th, the large boat was sent under the com-
mand of M. Maurouard, to circumnavigate Maria Island, in
order to ascertain its shape, and to obtain a supply of fresh
water. Our geographical engineer, M. Boulanger (who was
scarcely convalescent from the illness which seized him at
Timor), was entrusted with this work. I accompanied him
for the purpose of examining the island with respect to its
productions, soil, climate, and inhabitants.
The most Southern point, which our geographers have
named Cape Pcron, was soon reached. Forward from this
Cape rises a solitary granite rock, 160 to 200 feet in height,
tind much worn by the waves. In shape it is somewhat like
an obelisk, so we named it the Pyramid.
From this point the coast trends sharply to the JST.N.E.,
and we stretched along, keeping at a little distance from the
land. A perpendicular wall of granite, like a rampart, faces
the sea along the whole length of this portion of the coast.
At many places one would believe that he could distinguish
the debris of a line of ancient fortifications. Various species
of parasitical plants, including bright red, and beautiful
sulphur-tinted lichens, grow against the face of this wall, the
outline of whose summit appears through the sheltering

outline of whose summit appears through the sheltering


shrubs, like the parapet of a citadel; indeed, at several
points, one would think he could distinguish the battlements
and embrasures. A great depth of water is found every-
where along the whole length of this part of the coast, but
as it lies exposed to the southerly winds, which come from
the Antarctic Pole, unbroken by any intervening obstacle, it is
incessantly lashed by tumultuous billows, which break
violently against its granite walls. Arrived at the eastern
point, which we named Cape Maurouard (the name of M.
Boulanger’s deserving assistant), we found the coast trend to
the N.N.W. Prom this point the mountains lessen in height
rapidly, and a break in their chain soon occurs, and a large
bay is formed. Into this we entered, and speedily landed on
the isthmus, which separates it from Oyster Bay.
It was then about 2 p.m., and leaving my companions on
the beach, busily occupied with their geographical labours, I
proceeded to the north side of the bay, and penetrated into
the interior of the country. My progress was at first slow,
owing to the tall strong grass which thickly covered the
surface of the soil; in many places the shrubs grew so closely
that my progress in those directions was quite impossible,
and I was about to retrace my steps, when I saw at a little
distance, a track made by the natives. I followed this path,
and soon the trees became more rare, and in less than
half an hour I arrived on the summit of a little hill, from
whence I could see the two bays of Maria Island, the isthmus
separating them, and the mountains of Van Diemen’s Land,
the outlines of the distant ranges of which could scarcely b e
distinguished among the clouds, which enveloped them.
Several species of fine grass formed a charming carpet of
verdure all around; the Melaleuca, Correa, Fagara, Gon-
chyum, Styphelia, and the Metrosideros, formed pleasant
groves, above which rose the immense Eucalyptus globulus
the giant Leptosperm, the Cypress-leaved Exocarpos, the
fibious Casuarina, the silver-leaved Banksia, and a multitude
of other trees peculiar to these southern regions. At the
foot of this hill ran a little rivulet of fresh clear water, on
the banks of which grew several species of Eteris, Limodonm,

the banks of which grew several species of Eteris, Limodonm,


a new species of Immortelle with white flowers, the beautiful
Aletris with red flowers, the JPersil creeping everywhere over
the banks, and a small variety of Daucus, with taste similar
to that of an ordinary carrot.
While I abandoned myself to the pleasurable sensations
inspired by this charming scene, and looked around with a
vague inquietude, I perceived a monument, the construction
of which surprised and interested me greatly, I approached
it rapidly, and this is what I beheld:
On a broad mossy green in the shade of some ancient
casuarinas rose a cone, rudely constructed of pieces of bark,
fixed in the ground at their lower ends and united above by
a wide strip of the same substance. Four long poles, firmly
planted in the ground by their lower ends, served as a
support and stay to all the pieces of bark under which they
were placed; these four poles likewise served as ornaments to
the edifice, for instead of their upper extremities simply coming
together, like the pieces of bark, and so forming a cone, they
crossed each other about the middle point of their length,
that is, exactly at the point of their projection out of the
roof of the monument. From this arrangement resulted a
kind of tetrahedonal pyramid, the apex of which was exactly
opposed to that of the cone. This contrast of form, and the
opposite arrangement of the two portions of the structure,
produced a very graceful and pleasing effect. To each of the
four sides of the pyramid a wide strip of bark was fitted,
the two ends of which were fastened below by that wide
band (which I mentioned as serving to unite the other pieces
of bark at their upper ends); each of these four strips of bark
in this way formed a kind of oval, wider and more rounded in
its upper portion, and more contracted in the lower. As each
of these ovals corresponded to each of the sides of the
pyramid, it is easy to conceive the elegant and picturesque
appearance presented by such an arrangement.
Continuing my examination of the monument, I raised
some of the large pieces of bark, and readily penetrated into
the interior of the enclosure. The whole of the top part was


a new species of Immortelle with white flowers, the beautiful
Aletris with red flowers, the JPersil creeping everywhere over
the banks, and a small variety of Daucus, with taste similar
to that of an ordinary carrot.

Continuing my examination of the monument, I raised
some of the large pieces of bark, and readily penetrated into
the interior of the enclosure. The whole of the top part was


open ; in the lower portion lay a large and smooth cone formed
of a fine, light grass, laid with much care in very deep con-
centric layers. My interest increased with my uncertainty.
Eight little sticks crossing one another at the top of the cone
of grass served to keep it together, and"each of these small
rods had its extremities fixed in the ground, and kept in
position by a large flat piece of granite rock. So many
precautions inspired me with the hope of making some
important discovery, and I was not deceived, for scarcely had
I raised the upper layers of the grass, than I beheld a large
heap of white ashes. These appeared to have been placed
there carefully. Plunging my hand into this heap, I felt
something which resisted more strongly and drew it forth.
It proved to be the jawbone of a man, to which some shreds of
flesh still adhered. A feeling of hrroor seized me—however,
reflecting on all that I had observed in the composition of
the monument, I was not long before I experienced sensations
very different to those I had at first. That mossy green,
those flowers, and those protecting trees under which the
monument was placed, and that deep layer of young grass,
which covered these ashes, all united to convince me that I
had discovered a tomb.
Raising the ashes carefully, I perceived a friable and light
carbon, very black and inflated. I recognised an animal
carbon, and at the same moment brought up a portion of the
thigh bone with strips of flesh still adhering to it, and the
little tubes of the larger blood vessels could be seen, filled
with calcined blood reduced to the state in which that fluid
approaches a resinous condition. Other bones, not less
recognisable, succeeded to these, vertebrae, fragments of the
bones of the arms and legs, the tarsal, and carpal bones, etc.
All were much changed by fire and crumbled easily to powder
(I possess some debris of them, however, with portions of the
grilled flesh which clung to them). These bones did not lie
on the surface of the ground, but were heaped together at
the bottom of a circular hole, 15 to 18 inches in diameter by
8 to 10 inches deep.

8 to 10 inches deep.


At the foot of the hill, on which the monument was
erected, ran a clear stream of fresh water, an advantage so
rare and precious in the hot season in which we then were.
Both sides of this stream were carpetted with a large number
of young plants, amongst which grew the Orchis, the Eichea
glauca, the Apium prostratum, and the species of carrot
already mentioned as peculiar to these regions.
Oh, with what pleasure, seated on the bank of this stream,
did I follow the train of reflections called forth by all these
combined circumstances. In the midst of these threatening
rocks, in the deep bosom of these ancient forests, natural
affection yet maintained its sway, since the first monument
that we found was consecrated by it. This tomb seemed to
have been erected in grateful remembrance of kindness—
and thus the first altars were raised by filial piety—by
gratitude. This tomb I discovered in that part of the
country lying to the south of the eastern bay, and the only
place where as yet we had found fresh water. On this point
the large shells from which the natives obtain their daily
subsistence are not found in any considerable quantity. My
conjecture, respecting the site for this tomb, being specially
selected for the purpose, was strengthened by an examination
next day of a similar construction, which also was situated
on an eminence, with a stream of fresh water running below.
This second tomb X found in the country near Oyster Bay,
and this stream was the only one in the whole extent of that
bay. Thus, the same feeling which prompted the erection of
these monuments, caused them to be raised in the choicest
and most interesting of places, where man, more often led by
his bodily wants, must feel the more strongly the sentiment
of gratitude.
From the perishable nature of these structures, it will be
readily understood why so few are met with. Indeed, the
bark which protects them will soon be destroyed by the
action of the atmosphere, or dispersed by the winds ; the fine
light grass covering the ashes will speedily decompose, and
the ashes in part scattered by the winds will then present

the ashes in part scattered by the winds will then present


simply the appearance of a fire having been previously lighted
at that place ; and the bones, heaped together at the bottom
of the circular hole, will remain there naturally buried, which
clearly explains to us the reason why they are not met with
on the surface of the soil.
When I returned to my companions, they had completed
their geographical labours, and we embarked for the purpose
of taking soundings in this large bay, which we named
Eiedle Bay (so called in memory of the eminent naturalist
whom we lost at Timor). After completing our survey of
Eiedle Bay, we returned to land and passed the night there.
At four o’clock next morning (February 20, 1802), we again
embarked, and continued our exploration of Maria Island.
After rounding the point at the north of Eiedle Bay, we
found the land bear to the E.IST.E., and we stretched along in
this direction until abreast of Cape Mistaken (so named by
Captain Cox, who explored Oyster Bay in 1789), the most
eastern point of the island. From this cape to the extreme
northern point of Maria Island, the coast line runs to the
W.N.W. All that portion of the island lying between the
Great Bay on the east, and the North Cape, is truly terrifying
in its aspect. Along its whole extent rise granite cliffs, 300
to 400 feet in perpendicular height. Vast caverns penetrate
far into the thickness of these walls, and the hoarse roarings
of the waters, as it rushes into them from the ocean, sounds
like distant thunder.
Scarcely had we rounded Cape Nord (which has been,
called by us Cape Boulanger, from the name of our engineer)
than we found the land much lower in elevation, and dis-
playing, under the shelter of the mainland of Yan Diemen, a
long sandy beach, stretching almost uninterruptedly from
this point to the furthest extremity of Oyster Bay. On the
east the ravages of the winds and waves are everywhere
apparent, while the appearance of the western portion
testifies to the tranquillity of nature, and to the peaceable
action of time. Off Cape Boulanger rises a huge rock, which
is connected with Maria Island by a chain of dangerous reefs,


simply the appearance of a fire having been previously lighted
at that place ; and the bones, heaped together at the bottom
of the circular hole, will remain there naturally buried, which
clearly explains to us the reason why they are not met with
on the surface of the soil.

this point to the furthest extremity of Oyster Bay. On the
east the ravages of the winds and waves are everywhere
apparent, while the appearance of the western portion
testifies to the tranquillity of nature, and to the peaceable
action of time. Off Cape Boulanger rises a huge rock, which
is connected with Maria Island by a chain of dangerous reefs,


and outlying from this rock is a small island of granitic
formation. It is sterile and of slight elevation. Between
the rock and this island is a narrow channel which is
practicable only for small boats. We called it North Island.
For great distances the surface of the sea to the N.E. of
the island was covered by enormous beds of seaweed. These
beds were composed of one species only, the Fucus gigan-
ticus, which is undoubtedly the largest of Pelagian plants.
We measured several of them, which were not less than from
260 to 300 feet in length. To raise these immense stems
to the surface of the water, and to support them there, Nature
employs a means as simple as it is efficacious. From distance
to distance, each leaf, moderately large, indented at the
edges, and honeycombed throughout its extent, bears on its
petiole close to its insertion to the stem, a large pyriform
vesicle of two or three inches in length with a diameter of
nearly an inch in the middle and most inflated part. All
these vesicles, which are filled with air, act like so many small
balloons, forcing the stems to rise to the surface of the sea,
and keeping the leaves spread out over the waves. Some of
these leaves attain a large size, and I have measured several
which were from 10 to 12 inches long.
Bounding Cape Boulanger, we stretched rapidly along the
N.W. side of the island. In the interior of the country one
could see fine forests, and the reverse of the mountains were
well timbered. About 5 p.m. we ran past Middle Island,
which we so named from its position in the middle of the
channel between Yan Diemen’s Land and Maria Island.
Middle Island is a large granite rock, about 250 yards across,
and elevated from 30 to 40 feet above the level of the sea.
It is very sterile, and the natives who crossed from the main-
land to Maria Island, being in the habit of resting here,
have destroyed all traces of vegetation.
At length we rounded Cape Sesueur, which forms the
northern point at the entrance to Oyster Bay (Long Point).
We were about to land to pass the night on shore, when we
perceived a band of from 20 to 30 savages, armed with long

the rock and this island is a narrow channel which is

vesicle of two or three inches in length with a diameter of
nearly an inch in the middle and most inflated part. All
these vesicles, which are filled with air, act like so many small
balloons, forcing the stems to rise to the surface of the sea,
and keeping the leaves spread out over the waves. Some of
these leaves attain a large size, and I have measured several
which were from 10 to 12 inches long.
Bounding Cape Boulanger, we stretched rapidly along the
N.W. side of the island. In the interior of the country one
could see fine forests, and the reverse of the mountains were
well timbered. About 5 p.m. we ran past Middle Island,
which we so named from its position in the middle of the
channel between Yan Diemen’s Land and Maria Island.
Middle Island is a large granite rock, about 250 yards across,
and elevated from 30 to 40 feet above the level of the sea.
It is very sterile, and the natives who crossed from the main-
land to Maria Island, being in the habit of resting here,
have destroyed all traces of vegetation.
At length we rounded Cape Sesueur, which forms the
northern point at the entrance to Oyster Bay (Long Point).
We were about to land to pass the night on shore, when we
perceived a band of from 20 to 30 savages, armed with long


spears, who, with loud cries, advanced towards us. That
numerous society suited us the less, that, fatigued as we were
by keeping to the sea during two whole days, we needed rest,
and with such neighbours it would have been necessary to
keep armed watch during the night. We therefore resolved
to proceed further up the Bay, believing that the savages
would not be able to follow us. However, they continued
their route towards the west and soon disappeared, and we
then landed.
At an early hour on the 21st we were rounding the southern
point of Oyster Bay, when we heard the firing of cannon from
the vessels—the shots followed at measured intervals, and
could not but understand their sad impor t—the last of my
colleagues, M. Mauge, was no more . . . funeral honours
were being accorded to him. . . .
His remains were interred on Maria Island, at the foot of a
large Eucalyptus, against which was attached a leaden plate,
recording the sad particulars of his death, and the name
Point Mange was given to that portion of the island where
our unfortunate comrade was buried.
Leaving Oyster Bay we came to the portion of the western
coast which we had yet to survey, after which we directed our
course for the ship, which we reached in the evening of
Pebruary 21st, 1802.
At dawn next morning I again set out, intending to cross
the isthmus and visit once more the tomb of the eastern
bay. M. Petit, our artist, accompanied me on this expedition.
A frail boat, known to sailors by the name dingey, was at
my orders; it carried only 3 men, and we were armed with
only one wretched gun, which M. Petit embarked secretly.
Our Commandant had strictly forbidden the carrying of arms
by the boats’ crews, although on the very same evening of
the day of which I speak, two carpenters belonging to the
“ Naturaliste ” succumbed to injuries inflicted on them by
the natives.
A large fire on the southern side of Oyster Bay attracted
our attention, and gave us the hope of finding some of the


spears, who, with loud cries, advanced towards us. That
numerous society suited us the less, that, fatigued as we were
by keeping to the sea during two whole days, we needed rest,
and with such neighbours it would have been necessary to
keep armed watch during the night. We therefore resolved

by the boats’ crews, although on the very same evening of
the day of which I speak, two carpenters belonging to the
“ Naturaliste ” succumbed to injuries inflicted on them by
the natives.
A large fire on the southern side of Oyster Bay attracted
our attention, and gave us the hope of finding some of the


natives there. We accordingly landed on this point, and our
expectations were realised; 14 savages were assembled round
this fire, who received us with transports, showing at once
astonishment, admiration, and pleasure. “ Medi, medi” (sit
down, sit down) were the first words addressed to us. We
seated ourselves ; they grouped themselves round us; the
larger number of these savages were armed with long spears,
and the others carried clubs. They laid their weapons on the
ground within reach, and the coxswain of the boat, M.
Bouget, to whom we had confided the gun, also laid it down
by his side, taking care not to quit it for an instant. We
regarded these natives attentively for a few moments, while
they in turn stared at us; we were so strange to each other!
The savages wished to touch the calves of our legs and our
chests, and expressed their astonishment at the whiteness of
our skins by oft repeated cries. But soon they wished to
extend their researches, doubting, perhaps, whether we were
constituted like themselves, and persisted with such deter-
mination that we could not well refuse.
The majority of these natives were from 16 to 25 years of
age, two or three might be from 30 to 35, and one man older
than any of the rest, appeared to be about 60 to 55 years old.
He had a kangaroo skin covering his shoulders, while the
others were perfectly naked. As a rule, all these individuals
were tall for their age. One of the adult men measured
quite 5 feet 6 inches in height, but he was of a much more
slender build, and leaner fleshed than his companions; the
height of the others varied from 5 feet 2 inches to 5 feet 4
inches.
All these savages had powdered their hair with a kind of
red ochre, with one exception. This was a young man, 24 or
25 years, named Bara-Ourou, of a finer build and figure than
any of the others. He possessed a well shaped head, ample
brawny shoulders, and the muscles of his loins and buttocks
were strongly developed, but, like all his race, his limbs, and.
especially the legs, were extremely slender and weak, and his
belly was much too large in proportion to the rest of his body.

The countenances of these uncivilised people are very
expressive, and the passions which succeed each other very
rapidly are strongly depicted there. Mobile like their
inclinations and affections, the features are modified to
pourtray their fickle emotions.
After some minutes passed in examining each other, M.
Petit executed before them some dexterous feats of sleight
of hand, palming and secreting small articles about his
person. They were greatly diverted, and showed their
pleasure and enthusiasm by the most whimsical demonstra-
tions ; but nothing astonished them so much as seeing M.
Pouget thrust a pin into the calf of his leg, without testifying
any anguish, and without losing a single drop of blood. At
this wonderful performance, the natives stared at each other
in silence, as if sharing the extreme astonishment which they
felt; and then they commenced to howl in chorus as if they
were possessed. Unfortunately for me, amongst our presents
given to these savages, were some pins, and one of these men,
wishing doubtless to prove whether I shared this insensibility
to pain, came near, and without saying a word, thrust a pin
into my leg with such force that I cried out in anguish, being
totally unprepared for such an attack.
In the meantime, in the moments during which the
savages were in good humour and well disposed towards us,
M. Petit occupied the time in sketching the young savage,
whose regular features, fine form, and expression of face, had
particularly attracted our notice. I applied myself to the task
of making these men understand our friendly feeling towards
them, using the words which I had picked up during our
stay in D’ Entrecasteaux Channel, and employing the language of
signs, the utility of which they appreciated with a sagacity
scarcely credible. Our conference at this point became really
interesting ; grouped together in the midst of the ashes from
their fire, we seemed mutually satisfied with each other. I
took advantage of this opportunity, so favourable for my

took advantage of this opportunity, so favourable for my

this way I obtained replies, giving the equivalent words in.
their language for laugh, to please, ivhistle, to breathe, to spit, to
wrestle, to rend or tear to pieces, choke, to tie to untie, burn, to
yawn, etc,, etc.
As a rule, they appeared to be possessed of much intelligence,
they readily comprehended all my gestures ; they seemed to
understand what I aimed at from the first moment; they
willingly repeated for me the words I did not catch at the first,
and often laughed noisily, when in trying to pronounce the
words, I made a mistake or pronounced wrongly. The idea of
“ caressing ” seemed to be altogether strange to them. In
vain I made signs, characterising the actions expressive of
affection. I asked them “ gouanarana ? ” which means in
their language, “What is that called?” “Mdego,” “I do not
know,” was the only answer I could get from them. So this
action, as well as that of “ embracing,” which also they
could not understand—so natural as it seems to us, and so
full of charm—kisses and affectionate caresses appeared to be
utterly strange to these fierce and rude people. While we
were most busily engaged, M. Petit with his drawing, and
I with my questioning, we heard on a sudden, loud cries in
the interior of the forest. At these cries the savages
hastily rose and seized their weapons; with looks expressive
of surprise, and ferocity, they gazed towards the sea. They
seemed to be violently agitated, when a boat from our vessels
came in sight, at a short distance from the shore. I did not
doubt that this boat, the approach of which was signalled
from several points by their sentinels, probably by their
women posted for the purpose on the cliffs, or high trees, was
the cause of their agitation and alarm. Soon fresh shouts
were heard, and, as they indicated, undoubtedly receded from
the shore, the natives calmed down a little ; I seized the
opportunity and endeavoured to make them understand that
the men whom they had seen, were, like us, their friends, and
from whom they might expect nothing but kindness and gifts.
They appeared to comprehend my meaning. They again sat
down, and laid their weapons on the ground. We wanted to

resume our interrupted work: M. Petit recommenced his
drawing, and I endeavoured to pick up more of the words of
their language; but, becoming more and more restless and
inattentive every moment, they refused at last to reply to my
questions. . -
Little by little they became more daring; they conversed
with each other in an earnest and agitated manner; their
looks became more and more fierce and threatening, and they
seemed to meditate some violence, but the resolute looks of
M. Eouget, one of the handsomest and most intrepid of our
whole crew, and the sight of the gun he carried, seemed to
keep them back. They pestered him continually, and tried
to get him to fire at the birds, but we judged our situation
too critical. Their audacity increased with their mistrust in
our weapon. One of them wished to have the flannel waist-
coat I was wearing, the bright colours of which had taken
his fancy ; I refused so positively that I did not think he
would come again. It happened otherwise, for at the moment
when I was paying least attention to him, he seized me by
this same waistcoat; directing the point of his spear towards
me, he brandished it violently and seemed to say to me,
“ Give me it or I will kill thee.” In such a situation it
would have been dangerous to be angry, for the wretch
would have certainly pierced me with the spear. I affected to
take his menaces as a joke, and opportunely seizing the point
of his weapon I turned it aside and pointing out to him that
M. Eouget was aiming the gun at him, I said the single
word Mata! which means in his language, Death! He
comprehended my meaning, and laid down his weapon with
the same indifference, like as if nothing hostile to me had
escaped him. Hardly had I escaped from this danger, when
I found myself in a position, if not so perilous, was to say
the least, extremely disagreeable. One of the gold earrings
I was wearing excited the cupidity of another savage, who
glided behind me and without saying a word, passed his
finger craftily through the ring, and pulled it so forcibly
that the ear would have been torn, if the clasp had not
given way.

Now, when it is considered that these men had been heaped
with presents, literally loaded with mirrors, knives, beads,
handkerchiefs, snuffboxes, etc., and that I had cut the very
buttons from my coat to give to them (these buttons were
considered as more precious than anything else), etc., etc.,
the treachery of behaviour towards us can then be fully
understood. But for M. Eoaget and his scarecrow gun, we
had fallen victims to these fierce men! Harassed by these
mischievous proceedings of the Maria Island savages, I
determined at length to put an end to this dangerous inter-
view. But, desirous at all haza.rds to repeat some observa-
tions which I had already commenced in the Channel, I
caused Eegnier’s dynamometer to be brought from the boat.
I hoped that the shape of this instrument and its use would
perhaps attract the notice of these wild men, and I intended
to test their physical power by means of it. I was not
disappointed; they admired the dynamometer, and all wished
to touch it at the same time, and I had great difficulty in
keeping it from being broken. Seven individuals had made
trial of it, when one of the first who had not been able to
move the indicating needle of the dynamometer, exasperated
by his inability, came near, seized my wrist and seemed to
defy me to get away. I freed myself with little trouble
however, and in my turn grasped him with all my strength
by the wrist. In spite of all his attempts he was unable to
release himself. He was ashamed of his weakness, and
became still more exasperated. Up to that moment the old
man, whom I mentioned before, had been a silent spectator,
but he now addressed some words to his countrymen;
without having the appearance of a command, these words
produced such an effect that from that instant no one wanted
to meddle with the dynamometer. Before leaving them, I
thought it expedient to give further evidences of our friendly
intentions, so I approached the old man, took him affection-
ately by the hand, and presented him with an empty glass
bottle, a knife, two gilt buttons, a white handkerchief, etc.
I made signs to him that we were going away, but would
return in the evening with fresh presents for his comrades

I made signs to him that we were going away, but would
return in the evening with fresh presents for his comrades


and himself. The old man appeared to be so much the
more satisfied with these gifts, because we seemed more
disposed to relieve him of our presence ; he smiled in a
contented manner though his countenance still expressed
wildness and inquietude. While I took my leave of the
old man, M. Petit had bartered a mirror in exchange for a
spear; I wanted to get a club in the same way, but the
savages suddenly rose to their feet, seized their weapons,
and with loud cries they threatened us in such a menacing
manner that M. Eouget was obliged in our defence to fire
at the savage who showed the greatest animosity to me.
This was the same Bara-Ourou, of whom I have spoken
previously, and who was sketched so carefully by M. Petit.
After that extreme act of violence, there was no time to be
lost in getting back to our boat; but fearing that these
ferocious savages would crush us with stones or throw their
spears at us during our retreat, we retired slowly, M. Eouget
with his gun bringing up the rear. We reached the boat
without mishap, and rowed towards the further end of the
bay. The natives followed along the beach for some time,
but, on seeing two boats from our vessels dredging for
oysters, they disappeared into the thicknesses of the forest.
We landed again, and crossed the isthmus to the tomb of
the eastern bay, which M. Petit wished to sketch carefully.
We made a rapid and successful journey, completed the
sketch, and returned to the ship, where we arrived towards
nightfall.
On the 27th of February, 1802, in the afternoon, we set
sail, and passed by the south of Maria Island. But before
leaving it, let me present a rapid sketch of the physical
features of this Island.
Maria Island, first discovered by Abel Tasman in 1642, is
situated on the eastern side of Yan Diemen’s Land, in the
Great Southern Ocean ; the southern point of Oyster Bay is
in S. latitude 42° 42' and E. longitude 148° 14'. Its shape is
very irregular; the northern and southern portions are
broadest and most elevated, while its middle portion is

wildness and inquietude. While I took my leave of the

lost in getting back to our boat; but fearing that these
ferocious savages would crush us with stones or throw their
spears at us during our retreat, we retired slowly, M. Eouget
with his gun bringing up the rear. We reached the boat
without mishap, and rowed towards the further end of the
bay. The natives followed along the beach for some time,
but, on seeing two boats from our vessels dredging for

We landed again, and crossed the isthmus to the tomb of
the eastern bay, which M. Petit wished to sketch carefully.
We made a rapid and successful journey, completed the
sketch, and returned to the ship, where we arrived towards
nightfall.
On the 27th of February, 1802, in the afternoon, we set
sail, and passed by the south of Maria Island. But before
leaving it, let me present a rapid sketch of the physical
features of this Island.
Maria Island, first discovered by Abel Tasman in 1642, is
situated on the eastern side of Yan Diemen’s Land, in the
Great Southern Ocean ; the southern point of Oyster Bay is
in S. latitude 42° 42' and E. longitude 148° 14'. Its shape is
very irregular; the northern and southern portions are
broadest and most elevated, while its middle portion is


extremely contracted, forming an isthmus only 250 to 300 yards
in width, and not more than 30 to 40 feet above high water
mai’k. The geographical situation of that island, its exposure
to the Polar winds from the south, its small extent, the con-
siderable elevation of the IST.E. and S.E. portions, its vicinity
to the high mountain ranges of Van Diemen’s Land, its
peculiar conformation, being so contracted in the middle
portion, that the interior of the island is occupied almost
entirely by water, and the considerable extent of marshy
ground lying on the IST. side of Oyster Bay, are so many
different circumstances tending to moderate the heats of
summer in this island. Indeed, although we visited the
island in the middle of the hot season in these countries,
the temperature never exceeded 65|° E. (18*75° C.), and the
mean temperature 61*025° P. (16*125° C.) The nights were
particularly cool, fresh and pleasant, and the thermometer
barely reached 50° F. (10° C.), at four o’clock in the morning.
The barometer showed many, even very, great changes; it went
down to 28*4", 27*10", and even as low as 27*9|" on several
occasions ; the atmospheric condition was strikingly similar to
that of the autumn in our own climate.
The productions of Maria Island are very varied. We
collected specimens there of two kinds of granite ; the first
kind, of a dark green colour, with small grains, forms the
rocks on the S. and S.E. points, and is again met with on the
southern side of Oyster Bay, and also towards the northern
point of the same bay ; the second variety is remarkable for
its yellowish crystals of feldspar, and by the greenish tint of
the mica, which is found with the quartz, interposed between
the crystals of feldspar. This magnificent variety of gx*anite
(that M. Bailly met with again in the Furneaux Islands) was
exposed to our observation in Eiedle Bay, below the hill of
the tombs. All the rocks in that locality, and the lofty cliffs,
forming the points on the JST.E. Coast, are composed of this
variety of granite.
Among the varieties of sandstone (freestone) two varieties
are worthy of note; the first kind is very close and fine-


extremely contracted, forming an isthmus only 250 to 300 yards
in width, and not more than 30 to 40 feet above high water
mai’k. The geographical situation of that island, its exposure
to the Polar winds from the south, its small extent, the con-
siderable elevation of the IST.E. and S.E. portions, its vicinity
to the high mountain ranges of Van Diemen’s Land, its
peculiar conformation, being so contracted in the middle
portion, that the interior of the island is occupied almost
entirely by water, and the considerable extent of marshy
ground lying on the IST. side of Oyster Bay, are so many
different circumstances tending to moderate the heats of
summer in this island. Indeed, although we visited the
island in the middle of the hot season in these countries,
the temperature never exceeded 65|° E. (18*75° C.), and the
mean temperature 61*025° P. (16*125° C.) The nights were
particularly cool, fresh and pleasant, and the thermometer
barely reached 50° F. (10° C.), at four o’clock in the morning.
The barometer showed many, even very, great changes; it went
down to 28*4", 27*10", and even as low as 27*9|" on several
occasions ; the atmospheric condition was strikingly similar to
that of the autumn in our own climate.
The productions of Maria Island are very varied. We
collected specimens there of two kinds of granite ; the first
kind, of a dark green colour, with small grains, forms the
rocks on the S. and S.E. points, and is again met with on the
southern side of Oyster Bay, and also towards the northern
point of the same bay ; the second variety is remarkable for
its yellowish crystals of feldspar, and by the greenish tint of
the mica, which is found with the quartz, interposed between
the crystals of feldspar. This magnificent variety of gx*anite
(that M. Bailly met with again in the Furneaux Islands) was
exposed to our observation in Eiedle Bay, below the hill of
the tombs. All the rocks in that locality, and the lofty cliffs,
forming the points on the JST.E. Coast, are composed of this
variety of granite.
Among the varieties of sandstone (freestone) two varieties
are worthy of note; the first kind is very close and fine-


grained, white and sparkling, and of a homogeneous texture.
It forms very large masses, and where it is cut through in the
valleys, exposes the granite on which it rests in an inclined
position. The second variety of sandstone is friable and
crumbles easily. It occurs in horizontal beds, formed, no
doubt, by a long series of deposits of sand.
Amongst the mineral productions of Maria Island I found
an ore, of the oxide of iron, of an earthy texture-like clay, and
of a deep red colour. It is found in many parts of the island,
and is the source from which the natives obtained the principal
ingredient of the powder which they put on their hair.
The vegetable mould lies in deep beds in the valleys, where
it is of the first quality, very oily and black, and when
strongly heated becomes red, showing the presence of an
oxide of iron, abundant in the marshy places to the north of
Oyster Bay. This earth, composed nearly entirely of vegetable
debris, is of a character analogous with that of a kind of turf.
The sand on the shore of Eiedle Bay is blacker, more
quartzose, and contains much more detritus of marine plants
than that of Oyster Bay, which is very white and fine, con-
taining much calcareous matter, arising from the debris of
the abundant shells.
No portion of Maria Island is of volcanic origin, and we
did not find the least trace of volcanic matter.
The aspect presented by the whole of the western portion
of Maria Island is pleasing. It is well wooded, and in many
parts produces herbage of the best quality. Among the
plants peculiar to the island, I must specially make mention
of a new variety of Typha, the trunks of which were
employed by the natives in the construction of their canoes.
I saw only one animal, a species of Dasyurus, belonging to
the class Mammalia. It was not much bigger than a mouse.
I obtained a live specimen from a native, in exchange for
some trifles. He was about to kill and eat it.
Amongst the Mammalia inhabiting the ocean, we saw large
numbers of dolphins and whales, with innumerable legions of


grained, white and sparkling, and of a homogeneous texture.

Amongst the Mammalia inhabiting the ocean, we saw large
numbers of dolphins and whales, with innumerable legions of


seals. These last-mentioned animals alone are sufficient to
give great importance to Maria Island.
The birds were of the same species that we had seen in
D’Entrecasteaux Channel, with the exception of a variety of
parroquet and a charming bullfinch, which we observed for
the first time on the shores of Maria Island.
Amongst the Eeptilia we obtained several species of lizards,
one belonging to a new genus, allied to the Sciriques.
The class of Fishes comprises several new species; as is
also the case with the Insects and Crustacea.
Among the class Crustacea we caught a large species of
Maia (crayfish) in such numbers that we were able to make
a general distribution of them to the crews of the two ships.
In the Testacea our collections were augmented by the shells
of the magnificent Valuta undulosa, many varieties of Turbo ,
a rose-coloured casque, of the most exquisite beauty, an
elegant Tellini, and a large variety of Phasianella, which
form very large banks on several places in Oyster Bay ; and
the interior portion of a shell, which seemed to belong to a
new kind, was picked up. It is similar in shape to the
Trochus, and a shell very much like it is found fossil at
Grignon, near Paris.
In the class of soft Zoophites, three varieties of sponge
were collected, as well as an elegant Medusa, several Ascidioe
and one fine Actinous. But to attempt to give a complete
classification or enumeration of these different and varied
objects would lead me much further than a work of this
kind can or ought to extend.”*
These fierce savages, who, amid all their surroundings, had
sufficient natural affection to rear monuments to their departed
friends, were not allowed long to remain in possession of a
place so desirable. White men had seen the island, and
wished to take it from the lawful owners. Shooting parties
from the mainland, in search of game, had no compunction in
taking the lives of the men whose colour was different from

their own, so that, twenty years after M. Peron’s visit, only a
few men of the Oyster Bay tribe were left. Then, too late y
measures were taken for their preservation, but, one by one,
they succumbed to a civilisation that was too strong for them.
In 1825 a convict station was formed at the northern end of
the island, a landing place made in a pretty and sheltered
bay looking towards the mainland, and the necessary
buildings erected. The settlement was named Darlington.
This epoch of the history of Maria Island was a dismal one ;
the unhappy convicts were treated with a harshness only
exceeded by their treatment at Macquarie Harbour, and the
“admirable system,” which made more criminals than it
cured, was allowed full scope ! Two of the convicts attempted
to swim from Long Point, at Oyster Bay, to the Tasmanian
mainland opposite. They were heavily ironed, and the
distance was four miles, while the probability of their escape,
even if they reached the shore, was very slight. Yet, with the
energy of madness, one swam half way before sinking, the
other held out for the entire distance, only to lie down and
die, as he reached the land, from exhaustion !
Smith O’Brien, who was transported with a number of his
countrymen after the rebellion of 1848, was, by order of the
Governor, Sir William Denison, sent to Maria Island, and
having refused as a political prisoner to give his parole , there
was no resource but to confine him strictly. A year of prison
discipline so undermined his health, that he was allowed, on
the surgeon’s recommendation, to walk about the island
where he liked, in company with a gaoler. A plan for his
escape, arranged by his friends in Hobart Town, was
frustrated by the vigilance of the authorities.
The schooner “ Victoria ” was engaged to cruise off Maria
Island, and take O’Brien away to San Francisco. One day
he was taking a walk along the coast, when a boat put off
from the schooner with three men in it, who, pretending that
they were going to cut firewood, had an axe with them in the
boat. Soldier’s Point, where they tried to land, was so
surrounded by seaweed that the boat became fast; Smith

O’Brien waded through the water and seaweed until he reached
the boat, when a constable who had been deputed to watch
him, arrived on the scene, followed the hapless prisoner
through the seaweed, and pointing his musket at the men,
called on them to surrender. Wholly surprised and half
stupefied, the men made no resistance, while the constable
springing into the boat, quickly seized the axe and stove in
the planks, then drove the would-be rescuers and the prisoners
to the stockade, The “ Victoria ” was taken in charge by the
Government while the case was investigated ; the master was
fined £6O and costs, on payment of which the vessel was
released, and went away one night soon after without clearing
at the Customs.
The cottage in which Smith O’Brien lived is still pointed
out to visitors, having been “ restored ” by Signor Bernacchi.
Political prisoners were not treated so badly as the criminals,
but undue laxity of discipline could not be laid to the charge
of the authorities. In the little graveyard of the settle-

of the Maori rising in New Zealand in 1846, The Rev.
George Clarke (Congregational minister at Hobart), who
was for many years in New Zealand as Interpreter and Pro-
tector of the Maoris, gives this account of the kindly (?)
way in which these unfortunates were treated:—
“ The story of the unfortunate Maoris who were sent to
Maria Island is not a very creditable one for our Government.
Near the end of 1846 there were disturbances on the Land
Question near Wellington, and one of the tribes were in arms
to support what they considered their rights. Though I was
in the service of the New Zealand Government at the time,
and had much to do with the natives, I was not then in the
Southern District, but I disapproved of what was being done
there, and, mainly on that account, resigned my office, and
came on to Tasmania early in 1847, a few weeks before the
death of Sir Eardley Wilmot. Shortly after my arrival here,
five Maoris reached Hobart who had been involved in the
rising. These “ rebels,” as it was the fashion to call them,

disgusted with Grey’s request, refused to let them herd with

The scale of rations was a liberal one in comparison with
the fare at Macquarie Harbour: each man received fib. of
meat, weighed after being cooked, 21bs. of flour, and abund-
ance of vegetables, for the gardens on the island were very
productive. These have become too wild to be of any use
now, but a few trees survive, to give some idea of what has
been. Of all the work performed during the years the island
was occupied as a penal settlement, only one work has lived
long enough to be of any use to the present occupiers.
A large lagoon on the mountain at the back of the town-
ship was converted into a reservoir, to supply the settlement
with water, and has since been utilised for the water supply
of San Diego, the present township.
The prison buildings, to judge from the few walls still
standing, were very extensive and substantial; one of them,
the Penitentiary for prisoners who were not sentenced to
solitary confinement, contained accommodation for over 300
men. For the slightest offence, as for the gravest, solitary
confinement was a convenient form of punishment, and was
always accompanied with loss of rations; the substitute being
a small allowance of bread and water. No beds were allowed
in the solitary cells, not even a blanket to soften the hardness
of the floor, but the climate was not cold enough to make
hem suffer as they did at Macquarie Harbour.
In 1831, when the question of removing the unfortunate
aborigines still in Tasmania to some place where they would
be under control, was being considered by the Aborigines’
Committee, Maria Island was recommended by Mr. Robinson,
the protector and friend of the hapless blacks, as the most
suitable place to found a colony for them. Mr. James Bonwick,
author of “ The Last of the Tasmanians,” says of the island:

*■' It possessed charms to alleviate the sorrows of banishment.
It was a lovely spot, abounding in picturesque scenery, noble
forests, undulating downs, mountain streams and fertile


valleys. The soil was known to be remarkably adapted to
cultivation. There was something in its aspect which would
rather suggest the idea of an isle of Calypso than of a St.
Helena. When Tasman, the Dutchman, first beheld its
wooded hilly shores in 1642, he could, think of no better
appellation for that Isle of beauty than the name of a distant
charmer, Maria Van Diemen, the daughter of the Batavia
Governor.”
“ Beneath the lordly occidental star,
Sailed Tasman down a great and glowing space
Whose softer lights were like his lady’s face.
In dreams of her he roved from zone to zone,
And gave her lovely name to coasts unknown ;
And saw, in streaming sunset everywhere,
The curious beauty of her golden hair.”

attractions were admitted, but objections ruled. It 1825 it
had been made a penal settlement. Darlington station stood
on the north side, near the curious rocks of the Bishop and
Clerk, hanging one over the other. There a coarse woollen
cloth was made by the men, and afterwards manufactured into
garments by the convict women of the Hobart Town Factory.
Apart from the loss in relinquishing the works of the penal
settlement, it was contended that the island had no good
harbour, and that its proximity to the eastern main, three miles,
would render it no secure encampment, as the natives could
readily cross the water and renew their distressing ravages.”
So the humane proposition was vetoed, and the officers and
soldiers in charge of the station were permitted to enjoy the
pleasures of life in a place so full of beauty and fertility that
it might well have been given to the miserable remnants of
the once numerous Tasmanian Natives, as some small
recompense for the wrongs inflicted on them by the European
race, which had then well-nigh exterminated these children
of Nature. In 1851, the settlement was abandoned, and the
hand of Time began its work of decay, only temporarily
arrested by the spasmodic effects of a stockowner or
overseer who wished to inhabit some of the deserted
cottages.

Gradually Dame Nature, in her own way, began to make

luxuriant sweetbriar, untended and unhindered, clasping in its

Gradually Dame Nature, in her own way, began to make
beautiful what had been made hideous by man, and the
luxuriant sweetbriar, untended and unhindered, clasping in its
embrace the walls which had been unconscious and unheeding
of the suffering they witnessed, hid them from sight in
festoons of green and pink. And once more the island

“ This beautiful island is no longer a penal settlement,
which is a matter of much gratification, as it is in very truth a
charming place, having some thousand acres of land capable
of cultivation, some very fine timber, and in many parts the soil
is excellent; altogether a more fertile spot is not in Tasmania.
There are several lagoons and running streams; the shores
abound with capital fish ; and the best oysters are found in
Oyster Bay. Several animals whose fur is valuable are
trapped in the woods and many birds of variegated plumage.
The climate is mild and warm, and whilst the settlement was
in being there were several most productive gardens. The
island ceased to be a penal settlement in 1851, and is now
rented by the Government: so still cheerily we predict that a
few years will see a thriving city here, adapted as it seems to
be, for a seaport town of some importance.”
For thirty years after that was written the island was
gradually falling into disrepute and the buildings into
disrepair. Lessee after lessee, attempting to depasture sheep
on it, with the invariable result that the sheep became flukey,
threw up the lease in disgust, with not the faintest idea that
the island could be turned to other and more profitable
uses, or ever dreaming that capital and enterprise would one
day fulfil the confident prophecy of Major Stoney.
The island has wonderful natural resources. It has gold-
bearing reefs, deposits of tin and copper, seams of coal and
quantities of ironstone.

The surrounding seas swarm with edible fishes; the lime-
stone cliffs, of the greatest value for cement, are of enormous
extent; the water supply is sufficient for the irrigation of the
agricultural land, which will produce almost anything; the
forests contain splendid timber, especially in the north; the
climate is warm and dry, with a remarkable freedom from
frost or hot winds; the clay land produces bricks of great
strength and tenacity; and the stone quarries contain a
practically unlimited supply of building stone, of a quality
that Victoria has been seeking for years to use in her public
edifices. The climate and soil are eminently suited for the
cultivation of the vine and the mulberry. These grand
potentialities of wealth were slumbering unperceived, and
waiting for the magic touch of the prince to arouse them

In 1884 an Italian gentleman, Signor Diego Bernacchi,
arrived with his family in Tasmania, and interviewed the then
Minister of Lands, Hon. N. J. Browu, to ask his opinion as
to the suitability of some part of Tasmania for the cultivation
of the vine and mulberry. He met with much encourage-
ment from the Minister, who afforded him all the assistance
and help in his power, in the confident belief that the
establishment of these industries, and the consequent ex-
penditure of capital would be of great advantage to Tasmania.
Signor Bernacchi first visited Hew Norfolk, but the climate
there was, in his opinion, not warm enough for the ripening
of grapes. He returned to Hobart and informed the Minister
of his waut of success. Mr. Brown kindly offered him the
services of one of his staff in the Survey Office, and
recommended him to visit the East Coast. Accompanied by
Mr. Counsel, of the Survey Department, he again left Hobart
with the intention of going on to Swansea to look at some
properties there, which were then in the market. The two
started on this eventful trip in a light chaise drawn by one

started on this eventful trip in a light chaise drawn by one
horse. Long before they reached Spring Bay, thirty-two
miles from Swansea, the horse became lame and hobbled
along painfully, and, on arrival at the township of Spring


Bay they decided to stay a day or two to rest the horse. The
time threatened to hang heavily on their hands in the quiet
little place, so, being informed that there was good shooting
to be had on Maria Island, they took a boat and landed at
Soldier’s Point. The day was a delightful one, the air soft
and mild, as they made their way northwards towards the old
settlement. When they reached the garden, overgrown as
it was with briars, Signor Bernacchi had a conviction that
some ripe peaches were not far off. It did not seem likely,
and no fruit trees could be seen for the enveloping briar
growth, yet the air was redolent of their perfume. Cutting
his way through the bushes with a tomahawk he came to a
tree loaded with large ripe peaches, of which he picked all he
could carry, and returned to his companion with the remark :
“ The climate and soil that will ripen these are just right for
the vine and the mulberry.” Mr Counsel informed him that
the island was at that time advertised for rental at <£3oo per
annum. Signor Bernacchi concluded that he had found what
he came to seek and returned to Spring Bay. The horse, to
the lameness of which he owed the discovery, was still unable
to travel, so he was left behind, and the two gentlemen
returned to Hobart. The public-spirited Minister, when Signor
Bernacchi communicated to him his discovery, and asked for a
lease of the island for the purpose of establishment of the
wine-making and silk industries, threw himself heartily into
the project, and drafted a bill to obtain Parliamentary sanction
for the occupation of Maria Island for the purposes of
viticulture and sericulture. In the meantime he granted a
lease of the island for six months to Signor Bernacchi, who
thereupon decided upon taking up his residence on the island,
in the hope that his health would be benefited by a life, like
Eobinson Crusoe’s, almost entirely in the open air, but unlike

they decided to take with them all the stores and animals
they would need for food, so a vessel was made to do duty
for the ark, and the whole family, with their impedimenta,
set sail for the place they hoped some day to call “ home.”
The menagerie on board consisted of dogs, horses, pigs, sheep,
cows, bullocks, fowls, ducks, geese and turkeys, so that
emergencies were amply provided for. The walls of one or
two houses were still standing, and in the corner of one of
these, with blue-gum leaves for beds, they camped at first,
though it was not long before some sheets of iron were put
on a roof, and doors and windows put in, to make one of the
cottages habitable. -
Mr. Thomas Bowers, now an officer of the company, who
had come with Signor Bemacchi to Tasmania, in the capacity
of private secretary, after nearly ten years’ experience as
junior clerk in the Signor’s employment in England, accom-
panied the family. Soon after they arrived, Mr. Bowers,

household, and had taken one private lesson in the art of
yoking bullocks, volunteered, not without some modest pride
in his newly acquired knowledge, to yoke up two of the
bullocks they had brought with them, and go with a cask in
a cart for water. But the ways of bullocks are dark and
mysterious ; the use of a stockwhip and “ language ” had not
been included in the aforesaid lesson. The bullocks calmly
endured the necessary harnessing, and stood for a few
moments deliberating on the best mode of resenting the insult
of being handled by a new chum, then, quickly resolving on
a course of action, galloped off into the bush, until the cart
and the cask were in a state of disintegration, not due so
much to the speed of the animals as to the nature of the
obstacles in the way of their progress. Mr. Bowers ruefully
gazed after the animals as they bumped the vehicle, while
any of it remained to be bumped, against the trees and

attempt to do what nature had evidently not intended as his
special line o£ life, and an “ old hand ” was soon engaged, who
reduced the refractory beasts to order.
Several men were engaged to come over from the mainland
to do the preliminary clearing for cultivation, but it seemed
that camping out would be the only thing possible for them.
The day before they were expected, Signor Bernacchi, in.
clearing away some of the gigantic briar growth with an axe,
came to a door, which he managed to open, and found that
hidden by the dense scrub, there was actually the room of a
house in good preservation! He hurried back to his wife
with beaming face to tell her he had found something she
must come to see. His elation was so great that her
curiosity was aroused, and she hurried oft to find the treasure
that had so pleased him. A large, low room, evidently the
cooking place of the old prison settlement, with good floor
and roof—it was just what was wanted to accommodate the
workmen. The Signora’s mind, which had been greatly
exercised on the subject of a shelter for the men, was set at
rest by the welcome discovery, for, though perfectly willing
to endure any hardship, she was, and is, most anxious for
the comfort of the employes on the island.
Before doing anything to unlock the treasures of the
island, it was necessary that Signor Bernacchi should obtain
a more secure tenure than could be obtained under a pastoral
lease, and he accordingly applied to the Tasmanian Parliament
for a lease of the island under certain conditions. These
were: That the lessee expend <£lo,ooo during a period of 10
years from the date of the lease, rent to be paid in that time
at the nominal rate of Is. per annum : That all building
material, stones, bricks, and improvements on the island,
shoud be paid for by the lessee at a rate to be decided by
valuation. At the end of the first five years, if the lessee
had in that time expended <£5,000, he was to be allowed
to select 500 acres in any part of the island as freehold, on
payment of <£l per acre. A further selection of 500 acres
might be taken up on payment of <£l per acre at the end of

the sum of ,£IO,OOO, and a lease of the island for a further
term of 40 years, at a rental of £3OO per annum.
A bonus of £2,000 will be paid by the Government if,
within 20 years of the passing of the Act authorising the
lease, £5,000 worth of marketable wine or silk be produced
on the island.
It will thus be seen that the colony had nothing to lose if
the conditions were not fulfilled, and a great deal, indirectly,
to gain if the enterprise succeeded. Yet the amount, and
the kind of opposition with which the proposal was met,
were more unreasonable than might have been expected, even
from Tasmanians. Almost every kind of objection, both in
Parliament and out of it, was brought forward ; and the
proposal of a stranger to embark money in an undertaking in
Tasmania was ridiculed by some, and stoutly opposed by
others, who drew tragic pictures of the many ills that would
follow on the unprecedented action. The then Minister of
Lands and Works (Hon. N. J. Brown), fully recognising the
importance of the establishment of sericulture and viticulture
in the island, and imbued with sufficient patriotism to work for
the good of Tasmania, had from the first warmly supported
Signor Bernacchi; and the bill he had draughted was
eventually passed with modifications, giving the lessee rights
which enabled him to begin the cultivation of the vine and
the mulberry. The public-spirited Minister has since had the
gratification of knowing that his action is now regarded with
almost universal approval; and the many advantages gained
by the colony through the expenditure of foreign capital has
even been made the basis of an argument in favour of certain
concessions to a tramway syndicate on the West Coast.
Within three years from the date of the Maria Island Leasing
Bill the Hon. H. J. Brown was invited to visit the island to
inspect the improvements, and cut the first bunch of grapes
from the vines that had been planted by Signor Bernacchi.

Bill the Hon. H. J. Brown was invited to visit the island to
inspect the improvements, and cut the first bunch of grapes
from the vines that had been planted by Signor Bernacchi.
Having obtained the concessions he desired, Signor
Bernacchi at once set to work. The first thing to be done


was to clear some land, and a beautiful slope was selected for
tlie first experiment in vine growing. The land was good,
but a thick growth of briars and scrub had to be removed,
then a number of boulders taken out before the ground
could be ploughed. The vines, carefully selected by Signor
Bernacchi, principally from the Be Castella vineyard in
Victoria, were planted, and other works were then taken in
hand. Some of the buildings which had stood the wear of
weather, and survived as melancholy reminders of the old
convict days, sans doors, sans windows, sans ceilings,
sans flooring, were taken in hand, and made to
look sufficiently respectable to house honest people,
after a liberal expenditure on timber and paint.
Signor Bernacchi contrived to make the walls which
had once formed the abode of the surgeon into a
dwelling, habitable and comfortable, if not over roomy. At
the time of the penal settlement there had been a jetty at
Darlington, now San Diego, but it had been allowed to
crumble away. The generous Parliament, when appealed to,
offered to provide men to make a new jetty, if Signor
Bernacchi found timber and ironwork. The proposal was
agreed to, and a substantial jetty erected, to enable steamers
to lie alongside when receiving or discharging cargo or
passengers. A small and handy screw steamer was purchased
to carry mails and passengers between Spring Bay, the nearest
port on the Tamanian Coast, and San Diego, the new
township which was rising on the site of the old penal
settlement of Darlington.
The Hon. M. H. Davies, the present Speaker of the
Victorian House of Assembly, accompanied by Mrs.
Davies visited the Island in 1885. They were so delighted
and interested in the enterprise, and so satisfied with the pro-
spects of the undertaking under Signor Bernacchi’s judicious
management, that Mr. Davies entered into partnership with him.
But the resources of the island were so vast, and opened up
possibilities for the profitable investment of so much capital,
that about a year after they decided to transform the under-
taking into a company, with a capital of <£250,000.

In 1887, the Maria Island Company was formed, the objects
of which were wine-making on a large scale, for which the
island had proved itself so well adopted, that many of the
grape vines planted by Signor Bernacchi were in bearing,
fruit growing, agriculture, the exportation of limestone and
marble, the manufacture of Portland cement, the fattening of
sheep and cattle, the development of the fisheries, the exporta-
tion of timber, the establishment of a sanatorium, and the
sale of , town and suburban allotments. Three gentlemen of
high standing in the Victorian commercial world, Messrs.
Groom, Jenkyns, and Mercer, visited the island to report on
behalf of the company, and value the improvements. They
were thoroughly satisfied with the capabilities of the island
for the purposes specified, and reported favourably of the
enterprise.

that every kind of fruit that can be produced in Victoria
appears to thrive in a wonderful manner, vines especially.

seems better adapted to the growth of vineyards (and the
probable production of excellent wines) than anything else.

and there was an utter absence of anything approaching
winter temperature. As regards the suitability of the climate
for the production of vines and other fruits, we can only state
that every kind of fruit that can be produced in Victoria
appears to thrive in a wonderful manner, vines especially.
The grapes ripen to perfection, and the island generally
seems better adapted to the growth of vineyards (and the
probable production of excellent wines) than anything else.
“ Soil. — We consider in the northern portion of the island
that there were about 7,000 acres of good agricultural land,
1,000 of which are specially adapted for vineyards, having
the necessary slope to the north, with a perfect drainage, and
about 2,000 acres are magnificent soil. About 10,000 acres,
in addition to the above, will carry good grass for stock, but


requires burning and the timber rung ; if this were done wo
consider that it would carry a sheep to two acres, and about
200 head of young cattle. We think this work of the
greatest importance, and should be taken in hand at once,
and is, comparatively speaking, inexpensive. The balance of
the island is rough and more or less mountainous, and not
capable of much improvement, and its carrying capabilities
nominal. We may state that we saw a very large number of
the sheep (probably two-thirds) and, without exception, every
one of them was fat, many too fat to eat, and this in the face
of the fact that they appeared to be totally uncared for, and
were met with on all parts of the island, and in the roughest
and barest places, and their condition was invariably the
same. The cattle were, with a few exceptions, also in
excellent condition, and we have little doubt that, if properly
managed, the island will carry a large number of stock which
will pay well.
“ Water. —The whole of the island is well watered by
permanent running creeks of fresh water, at intervals of two
or three miles all round, also by large lagoons and swamps.
There is also a large reservoir at the back of the Darlington
settlement (built by prison labour), which, with a slight
expenditure, could be made to hold some millions of gallons,
and afford a never-failing supply for irrigation purposes.
“ Timber. —The timber consists principally of blue gum, a
large proportion of which is very valuable for piles and
sawing timber, and should be conserved where it is of this
description. There is also, we understand, a valuable bed of
celery-top pine on the eastern slope of the mountains, but
owing to the wet weather and heavy mists we were unable to
inspect it.
“Limestone, Etc, —We saw inexhaustible supplies of the
finest freestone for building purposes, equal in quality, and
similar to that used in the Law Courts, Melbourne, which
came from the mainland opposite (Spring Bay). There are
solid cliffs of marble and limestone hundreds of feet high,
which must in the future be of immense value, as the lime


requires burning and the timber rung ; if this were done wo
consider that it would carry a sheep to two acres, and about
200 head of young cattle. We think this work of the

“Limestone, Etc, —We saw inexhaustible supplies of the
finest freestone for building purposes, equal in quality, and
similar to that used in the Law Courts, Melbourne, which
came from the mainland opposite (Spring Bay). There are
solid cliffs of marble and limestone hundreds of feet high,
which must in the future be of immense value, as the lime


burned from either is of excellent quality, as can be judged
from the fact that in the old buildings, erected over fifty
years ago, the bricks break asunder before the mortar gives.
The marble should eventually find its way to the Melbourne
market, as it is of good quality, and could be landed here at
a price little, if any, in excess of ordinary freestone. There is
also an immense deposit of cement, from which we believe a
cement equal to Portland can be manufactured at a nominal
cost. Trials of this are now being made, and if successful,
this deposit will be the source of a very large income in the
future.
“ For the purpose of either a summer or winter resort for
visitors, and as a sanatorium for invalids, Maria Island is
undoubtedly well suited, whilst its picturesque beauty,
splendid harbours, magnificent fishing, and every variety of
sport, must at no distant date ensure its becoming one of the
most favourite watering-places in the colonies, and we may
add that special facilities for visiting the island will shortly
be afforded, as steamers from Hobart to Sydney, Melbourne,
and Hew Zealand will regularly call there, when the new
jetty, now in course of construction, is completed.”
As soon as the Company was floated, increased activity was
observable in all the operations on the island. The large
reservoir at the back of San Diego, built by the convicts
when Darlington was the penal settlement, was repaired and
put in order, with the result that abundance of water is now
available for all purposes ; the town was laid out, whole rows
of new cottages were built and let at good rentals ; a butcher,
a baker, a shoemaker, and a storekeeper immediately commenced
profitable businesses; a provident association was formed to
secure the services of a good resident doctor; a State school
opened with a large attendance of scholars; a spacious club-
room and reading-room opened for the use of the residents;
avenues laid out and planted with choice trees; a spacious hotel,
on the plan of the best hotels at Nice and Mentone, with all
the modern improvements adopted on the European Conti-

finished in August, and terraces sloping down towards the
bay and the jetty, were laid out. The enormous deposits and
cliffs of fossiliferous limestone have been subjected to severe
tests, which have proved their great value for hydraulic lime,
and Portland cement.
The Daily Telegraph, of Launceston, thus reports on
the discovery of the limestone and clay of which
the Portland cement is made:—“For many years past
capitalists in Victoria have endeavoured to initiate in their
midst, cement works that would be able to compete success-
fully with the Portland cement imported from the old country,
but their attempts have in every instance proved abortive
But in Signor Bemacchi’s island home, limestone and clay
have been found that supply the desideratum desired, and
which a Victorian syndicate, with the true Yankee spirit of
turning an honest penny, have decided to work. The stone
and clay are obtained at the San Diego end of the Island,
known in days gone by as Port Darlington. This flourishing
little settlement at present contains a population of over 260
inhabitants, and numbers amongst its buildings a post office,
and a State school, which latter is well attended. The pro-
posed works will consist of from 17 to 20 kilns for burning
the lime and clay, for which a site has been selected about
three quarters of a mile from the pier, erected conjointly by
the Government and the Maria Island Company, the termini
being connected by a steam tramway. The ordinary Portland
cement of commerce is composed of carbonate of lime, silica,
and alumina, and the latter two ingredients are found
immediately adjacent to the site on which the proposed
works are to be erected. The limestone at Maria Island is
of a high hydraulic order. The raw material, as submitted
to Mr. Ward, the Government Analyst, for analysis, showed
that one specimen of the limestone agrees almost to a point
with the celebrated Aberthaw limestone in Monmouthshire,
Wales, which was used by Smeaton in the erection of the

Channel for many a long year. Another specimen corresponds
with the Thiel limestone in France, which was used through-
out the construction of the Suez Canal, by Baron de Lesseps.
The clay on the island selected for analysis agrees to a nicety
with the Thames and Medway clays, chiefly used in the
manufacture of Portland cement in England ; indeed, seeing
the analyses side by side we should almost think they had
been obtained from the same source.
“ Mr. Alexander Pirrie, Civil Engineer, who among the
fond memories of his career will doubtless retain very
prominently his quarantine experience consequent upon
the outbreak of smallpox in Tasmania, under instruc-
tions from the syndicate some three months ago, visited
Maria Island, and selected samples of limestone and clay,
which he subsequently took over to Melbourne to have tested
as to their capability as ingredients for manufacturing a
marketable cement, and the result has been, under severe
tests, the production of an article that will not only compare
favourably, but, if the samples may be relied on, surpass the
imported article from the Mother Country. As soon as his
days of durance vile had expired, Mr. Pirrie proceeded
to Melbourne and erected a sample kiln at Cornwall’s
Pottery Works, Brunswick, the proprietor of which is an
old Launceston resident, and yesterday we had the pleasure
of seeing the stone and clay from the quarry to the
marketable article, which promises a new and successful
departure in the industries of the colony. The clinker is the
earliest stage, after the stone has been submitted to calcina-
tion. The next sample showed the cement in powder ground
from the clinker passing through a sieve of 2,600 measures
to the square inch. We also saw wet and dry pat samples
showing no crack on the surface whatever, and exhibiting
great hardness and durability. JBrequettes were next
submitted for our inspection, which, in the presence of
the Victorian syndicate, made of the same cement, when
tested in one of Paijah’s patent cement testing machines, bore

Company can place a marketable article on the market. In
the mean time samples will be exhibited in the Melbourne
Centennial Exhibition. In referring to this matter, we cannot
understand why this industry should not have been promoted
and carried out by some of our island capitalists.”
Another discovery of very great commercial importance is
that of the granite forming the cliffs on the east side.
Magnificent blocks of the most beautiful granite to be found
in the world, resembling inlaid mosaic work, can be obtained
at comparatively a small cost, in any length not exceeding two
thousand feet. These gigantic pillars of granite, with their
lovely colours and marking, require only to be seen to' create
an enormous demand for them for porticos, pillars, and
monuments. The orchards produce a variety of fruits, not
to be found glowing in the open air in Tasmania, while
those which ripen late on the mainland are early on the island.
Brick works for the buildings are in full swing, and the doors
and window sashes are made on the island. The large forests
of the Tasmanian Blackwood are, as yet, almost untouched,
but they promise a certain remuneration for any outlay on
tracks to reach them. The sheep on the island number about
5,000; there are 300 head of young cattle, all in good
condition, and 50 horses. The grazing land is being rapidly
fenced and sub-divided into paddocks, when a larger number
of sheep will probably be introduced, as the island is now free
from fluke. Wild goats and wallabies abound on the island,
and many descriptions of land and water fowl. The thrift
and comfort of the employes of the company is illustrated by
the number and value of the deposits in the Savings Bank,
which received over £l,OOO in the few months since it was
opened.
The agricultural department, which includes the stock, is
under the charge of Mr. Somerville, a Victorian gentleman.
The horticultural and viticultural department is under the

late chief vigneron to Messrs. De Castella and Eowan, of
Victoria; the engineering department is managed by Mr,
Alex. Pirrie, C.E., and the whole is under the immediate
supervision of the managing director.
Hardly a case of sickness has occurred in the island, and
the people generally, but especially the children, have a fresh
rosy colour, and a healthy appearance, due in a large measure
to the presence of Eucalyptus globulus , which exercises a
beneficial influence in purifying the atmosphere. What the
Marittima Pine is to Arcachau, in France, the blue gum is to
Maria Island. As a healthy marine resort for invalids, and
a vast recreation ground for all tourists, travelling for
pleasure, sport, or rest, Maria Island is unsurpassed in the
Southern Hemisphere.
A writer in the Argus thus describes the view from the
island : —“ Looking across the blue shining water of the
narrow strait on a bright sunny morning, the varied outline of
the mainland stretches north and south in a splendid pano-
rama. Indeed, this part of the Tasmanian coast is not to be
excelled for the variety and beauty of its scenery. Lofty
ranges of mountains rolling away in the distance ; bold rocky
headlands standing out in the coastline ; bright patches of
sandy beach low down on the shore, with the surf breaking
upon them; the roofs and fences of some neat little
homesteads shining in the sunlight on the slope of a distant
hill; the smoke of half a dozen bush fires rising lazily from
amidst the trees, and spreading out fantastically as a light
breeze drives it hither and thither. These are some of the
materials from which an artist might gather subjects for
many a striking canvas. Some twenty miles to the north-
ward, the long range of lofty peaks, forming the chief
feature of Schouten Island, rises abruptly out of the sea, and
in the misty distance beyond, the faint outline of the western
coast of Freycinet Peninsula may be dimly discerned.”

If Major Stoney could confidently prophesy that the future
of Maria Island would be a great one, the company, with
the numerous industries and advantages at their command,
and so capable a managing director, may look forward to the
city that is to be, with conviction that is fast becoming a
certainty.
There is sweet music here that softer falls
Than petals from blown roses on the grass,
Or night dews on still waters between walls
Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass ;
Music that gentler on’the spirit lies
Than tir’d eyelids upon tir’d eyes ;
Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.
Here are cool mosses deep,
And thro’ the moss the ivies creep,
And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,
And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.”
THE EXHIBITS OF THE MAEIA ISLAND
COMPANY.
The Maria Island Company have prepared a number of
exhibits for the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, to repre-
sent the natural products, and the industries started, or to be
started, on the island.
In BUILDING MATERIALS they show Portland cement,
manufactured on the island, and hrequettes of the same, show-
ing strength by tester, six days after manufacture, in water,
and out of the water; samples of ground hydraulic lime
taken from the quarry which supplied that used in making
the reservoir in 1881; a portion of the brickwork taken
from the bottom of the same reservoir, over which the water
has flowed for nearly sixty years, which still shows extraordi-
nary strength and tenacity ; and a sample block of mortar,
left by the convicts when making the reservoir, which,
exposed to all atmospheric influences since 1881, is still hard
and firm as cement; a large block of brick wall taken from
an old windmill, built more than half a century ago, and two
blocks of the limestone as it is when taken out of the quarry.
A large block of white Freestone, quarried on the island.

is also shown, and the Tasmanian stone trophy (facing the
Maria Island exhibits) has its base composed of the same
stone. Small samples of Marble and Freestone, and two
large blocks of unpolished granite are shown, and the Maria
Island Trophy has a base of white freestone, an architrave of
the same, which is supported by two columns of marble and
one of granite. The inscription, “ Marble, Granite, and
Freestone from Maria Island, 1888,” is cut on the
Freestone. This trophy is entirely the work of an Italian
workman on the island, named Luigi Firenzi. A case of
granite gravel from one of the beaches is included in this
class of exhibits.
In TIMBER there are three half logs of green Blackwood,
a small log of She-oak, a log of Silver Wattle, and one of Native
Pear, all polished on one side, and six logs of green Blackwood,
unpolished, a log of Blue Gum cut from the piles of the
pier, which are long, straight, and flawless ; and samples of
polished Dogwood, Musk, Myrtle, Sassafras, Eucalyptus,
Oyster Bay Pine, He-oak, She-oak, etc.
An ornamental garden chair, made by an Italian workman
on the island, contains 32 varieties of Tasmanian woods.
The FOSSILS are represented by a rockery of fossils
taken from the beautiful terraces and enormous fossil cliffs
over 1,000 feet high, and by stalactites from the Maria Island
caves. The rockery is ornamented with wild goats, which are
very numerous in the neighbourhood of the cliffs, and shells
collected on the beaches of the island.
MINERALS are represented by specimens of gold, silver-
lead, tin, manganese, ironstone, coal, and pipeclay.
The FISH shown are specimens of the mutton-fish, smoked
trumpeter, oysters, and beche-de-mer, all of which abound in
the waters surrounding the island.
In BOTANY, there is a collection of ferns and mosses.
The WINE-MAKING INDUSTRY, though as yet in its
infancy, is represented by wines of this year’s vintage, com-
prising Reisling, Hock, Claret, and Cabernet Sauvignon, or
Mouton Rothschild. Within two or three years the Company
expect to be able to claim the bonus of <£2,000, offered by the

expect to be able to claim the bonus of <£2,000, offered by the


Government, when <£5,000 worth of marketable wine or silk
is produced.
Black wattle bark for tanning, which is very plentiful, is
shown, and some wallaby skins and rug.
AGRICULTURAL SEEDS, Indian corn, Egyptian lentils,
various kinds of beans and peas, are exhibited. The root crops
on the island are very large; the carrots weigh from 41bs. to
61bs., and turnips sometimes reach the weight of 801bs. One
of the London papers, some years ago, contained a notice of
the extraordinary weight of a turnip grown on Maria Island,
which was sent to England, in a cask made expressly
for it. This remarkable illustration of the fertility of the
soil, reached the enormous weight of lOOlbs.!
Twenty-four large photographs of places of interest in the
island, taken by Mr. J. F. Echlin, also six copies, enlarged,
from M. Peron’s “Voyage du Geographe Naturaliste et de la
corvette ‘ Casuarina ’ aux Terres Australes, 1802,” should give
some idea of the many natural beauties of the island, and the
numerous improvements made by the Maria Island Company.
The Board of Directors in Melbourne are the Hon. M. H.
Davies, Speaker of the Victorian House of Assembly, Messrs.
A. C. Groom, M.L.A., Joseph Harris, M.L.A., Geo. Jenkyn,
J. Johnstone, J. S. Mercer, and John Moodie, with Mr. C.
Thorpe, as Manager. In Tasmania the Directors are the
Hon. W.|H. Burgess, M.H.A., and Signor Bernacchi, the
resident Managing Director, on the island.
Being right in the track of the steamers which trade
between Hobart and Melbourne, and between Melbourne and
Hew Zealand, it is probable that it will shortly be made a
port of call for these vessels (it has already been made a
port of clearance), the largest of which can come alongside
the pier. At present steam communication with Hobart is
kept up by two steamers, which call weekly, and with Spring
Hay by the Company’s steamer “ Endeavour ” daily, which
connects with a coach running between Campania, on the-
Tasmanian Main Line Railway, and Spring Bay.
