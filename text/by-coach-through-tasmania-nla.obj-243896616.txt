BT COACH THROUGH TASMANIA.
I never thoroughly understood Ed-
gar Poe’s description of the vale of
Arnheim—with its purple glories of
wooded hill melting into a succes-
sion of lakes as the traveller sailed
in his golden barge straight into
the glowing sunset —until I went
up the Tamar to Launceston.
Not that mine was a golden
barge; not by any means. It was
just an ordinary and most prosaic
steamer, and was afflicted with the
marvellous smell of oil incident to
steamers. Moreover, during the
24 hours’ journey from Victoria
to Tasmania it didn’t glide—how
many times during my contempla-
tion of the candle-lamp swinging
to the accompaniment of crashing
crockery had I wished it did !
but progressed with much creak-
ing, and jumping, and rolling, and
fits of internal vibration, as though
it were a living creature affected
with palpitation of the heart. But
all the petty miseries of the pass-
age, all the ghastly merriment
and unnatural flourishes of appe-
tite, all the nautical pride that
goeth before a fall, all the hideous
hypocrisy of rude health and in-
tense appreciation of the sea breeze,
and all the utter prostration and
final abandonment to lying down
on one’s back and praying for the
day,—all were forgotten with the
first glimpse of the winding river.
It reminded me of the Scotch
lake scenes, more especially that
near Loch Katrine, where the
mountains roll forward and the river
doubles back, just as the Tamar
does. lam conscious that I ought
to have been reminded of some
place much less known and conse-
quently much more powerful for
illustrative purposes than Scotland,
but I wasn’t. As we steamed up the
wide river, with its swelling banks,
its purple mountains, and its scat-
tered wealth of house and hamlet
nestling in its nooks and bays, I
didn’t think of Switzerland, or Ve-
nice, or Kamtschatka, or Staten
Island, but only of the Trossachs.
The houses had a Scotch look about
them, and the big rocks had a
Scotch look about them; and the
little church that guards the little
village under the cliff had such a
very Scotch look about it, that one
almost expected to see a flat bon-
net and a green plaid peep from
behind the gateway.
But Launceston dispelled the
illusion at once. Launceston is
English; essentially English. Some-
thing like a mingling of Torquay,
Scarborough, and Kingston. It has
the hothouse warmth and the luxu-
rious hedge-rows of Torquay, the
terraced cliffs of Scarborough, and
the shining sleepy river of Kings-
ton. Launceston is generally a
sleepy place. The streets are nar-
row and hot, and the big trees
sway sleepily; and the old-fashioned
houses pull their blinds down to
keep the afternoon sun from their
old-fashioned furniture, and doze
comfortably undisturbed. The old-
fashioned Brisbane inn seems to
have been taken landlord and
landlady and all out of some
sleepy old English country town,
and to have accommodated itself
placidly to circumstances without
asking any impertinent questions.
There is also an old English church
in Launceston. A big, cool, shady,

old church, with diamond-paned
windows, and such an air of Kent
about it that one looks round in-
voluntarily for the rookery and the
big elm-tree, from which naughty
Giles Jolt broke that birds’-nesting
leg of his. At the coach-office —
a sort of valentine’s cottage em-
bowered in cool foliage—the world
was asleep also. The coach
stolen from that old English inn,
where the immortal Bagman’s im-
mortal uncle had such a terrible
dream—was roosting, so to speak,
in a sort of private garden of its
own; and the coachman, accord-
ing to the statement of a gentleman
who was twirling a mop to a hissing
accompaniment, was asleep too.
Could I go right on to Hobart
Town ? Of course I could. But
the gentleman with the mop gazed
into the blue English sky—an old-
fashioned sky too, if skies can be
called old fashioned—and seemed
to gently wonder, in an old-fash-
ioned manner, at the daring of
Victorian travellers. £ There was
an inn at Campbell Town,’ he said
with a resigned air, as if Launces-
ton had got itself used to being
passed through and passed over,
and didn’t mind it now at all. The
inhabitants generally appeared to
have the same idea, and seemed to
take it for granted that one would
make for Hobart Town without an
instant’s delay.
By and by, after dinner—exactly
the sort of dinner that was ordered
for little David Copperfield and
eaten by the waiter, with a couple
of glasses of Tasmanian ale—it
was the ‘ Real Stunning’ I am con-
vinced—we got ready, in an old-
fashioned way, for the coach.
I have said it was an old-fash-
ioned coach; and the coachman,
coming quite rosy, not to say jo-
cose, from his slumbers, was old-
fashioned too. He wasn’t quite
like Tony Weller, for he was bigger;
but he was about as like that illus-
trious man as he could be expected
to be, and the way in which he
tied himself up in a muffler, and
then put about half-a-dozen coats
on in a gravely business-like way,
had a Wellerian air about it that
is indescribable. The guard, more-
over, was in a red coat and blew a
horn; and the four horses—'tits’
the coachman called them —got
away towards the post-offlce, with
a decided desire to look as much
like the Bath Mail (price 20s. co-
loured) as they could do under the
circumstances.
The Wellerian coachman having
rattled the 'tits’ through the old-
fashioned straggling town, in lordly
disregard of the necks of a number
of old-fashioned folks who were
jogging homewards, grew communi-
cative, and informed me, over the
edge of the muffler, that he had
‘ driven’ for over thirty years, and
the times wasn’t as they used to
be. I asked him about a talked-
of railroad; but he seemed to think
that the prospect of it was so far
off as to be really nowhere. By
and by, what with changing of
horses at old-fashioned inns, and
discoursing upon the prospects of
the country and the state of the
near leader’s shoulder, we got into
the ambrosial night; and after a
mutual drink, at the conclusion of
which the old-fashioned coachman
tied another wrapper round his
throat with a jerk, as though he
was tying it on a gate-post, we got
to Campbell Town, and bed.
In the morning another coach,
brimming over with humanity. See-
ing it coming round the corner,
travelling companion hazarded a
delightful suspicion of prisoners on
the box-seat; but upon closer in-
spection we discovered nothing
more exciting than two young
gentlemen in mackintoshes, and so
fell to every-day life again. The
coach was declared full; and two
old-fashioned ladies, who avowed


that they hadn’t been to Hobart
Town for seventeen years, were in
high grief thereat. Eventually, by
everybody sitting on everybody
else’s lap, and the guard swinging
to straps and stray pieces of iron
and odd rails, we all got places, and
went bowling off to Hobart Town.
Here came more Scotch scenery,
expatiated and lectured upon by
one of the old ladies, who, if my
memory serves me rightly, invited
us all to tea, at half-past six to the
minute, the next time we passed
Campbell Town. The early por-
tion of the road lay through compar-
atively even country ; and though
the mountains were always on each
side, behind, and before, we seemed
to be getting no higher than at
starting. After dinner, however, —
at another old English inn : I re-
member its counterpart at Eltham,
—we got into wilder country. The
road went up almost perpendicular
hills, and drew suddenly round
gigantic rocks, and bowled away
on the tops of craggy precipices,
and grew more like Wales, with a
dash of the approach to Blair
Athol. The four horses did their
stages, however, right merrily, and
seemed to make nothing of hand
gallopping up hills and going at
full speed down again. The driver,
moreover —we have another one
now: a burly fellow in a fur-coat,
with an eye like a sloe, and a dar-
ing contempt for the constituted
authorities that was quite startling
—indulged in sudden shouts and
yells and violent whip-crackings, as
we flew down-hill and raced up
again, that smacked of diligence-
travelling and its concomitant ex-
hortations of beasts. But no mat-
ter how rough the country, the
broad smooth road wound away
remorselessly through it like a big
ribbon, spun out of the blood and
sweat of many a poor convict
road-maker, one could not help
thinking. But any continental re-
miniscence, brought up by the
conduct of the fur-coat, was dis-
pelled the instant we turned the
corner, behind which the ‘ change’
w r as waiting. Sometimes it was a
big hospitable inn, with white cloth
spread and beef and tongues galore
awaiting us. Sometimes a little
posting-house, with quaint pictures
on the walls, and quaint excite-
ment about the event of the day,
the arrival of her Majesty’s mails.
Sometimes only a solitary farm-
house, with gabled roof and cattle
lowing under the hedge-rows, and
busy ostlers running in and out of
the noonday shadow with buckets
of clear sweet river water. But
whatever it was, and wherever it
was, it was thoroughly English—as
English as any Kentish village or
Devonshire farm.
So through cool morning, burn-
ing noon, and sweet perfumed even-
ing to Bridgewater, with its narrow
black centipede of wood creeping
across the rushing Derwent and
its rattle and roar of echo, its salt
breeze and its low - lying farther
shore. Then broke the mountains
for the first time. All along our
left ran the river, and between us
and it house after house and gar-
den after garden. Here was the
Grange, there the Manse; the
rectory was yonder in the trees,
and that avenue led to the squire’s
house. The farm-buildings, black
against the sunset, were fifty years
old; and the old man who lived
in that ivy-covered cottage remem-
bered when the blacks massacred
the women at Greenponds. A tea-
meeting, or a church-gathering of
some sort, was going on in one
little sweet-briered school-house,
and the young school-teachers and
the handsome young men from the
‘ city’ were going side by side to it
as they might have done fifty times
in England. That young man in
a shooting-coat might be Arthur
Donnithorne; and the slight black


figure in sharp silhouette against
the schoolroom-window, sad-eyed
Dinah Morris. The place has ‘ as-
sociations.’ As the coach whirls
past, one catches a glimpse of old
men and young children, of stal-
wart fathers and young mothers —
of three, four generations. In that
English-looking churchyard lie the
forefathers of the hamlet; in the
cottage-door play children whose
fathers were ‘ born in the village.’
It is not like Victoria, with its
hideous air of newness, its stern
practicality of iron roofs and new
post - and - rail fences, and dusty
gum leaves that have no shadow,
and dusty flowers that have no per-
fume. In Victoria though the
pulse of the Australian colonies
may beat there, if you will—there
is a terrible barrenness, a dreadful
sacrifice of beauty to utility, an ab-
sence of memories, and a presence
of speculation, and rush and roar
of money-getting, that is wearying
enough. Victoria always seems to
me like a place of business —a big
shop that its inhabitants ought to
shut up every night at six o’clock
and not open again until nine the
next morning. Whereas Tasmania
is a £ native place,’ if my ears under-
stand the term. It has fields where
we have played cricket, and pools
where we have bathed, and schools
where we have been whipped, and
green lanes where we have courted,
and greener churchyards where our
loved ones lie buried; and we can
look at a Tasmanian landscape, even
from so prosaic a place as the top
of the Hobart-Town coach, and
feel something as we used to feel
in those days when all the world
was gay and all the trees so green,
and we were only naughty little
boys who read Robinson Crusoe and
wanted to ‘go to sea.’
But here, on the right, rises
Mount Wellington—gigantic, grim,
and sunset-smitten —like some giant
watching over the town. The broad
river bay spreads out beneath us,
the hill dips suddenly, lights begin
to twinkle in windows, children run
together at street-corners, a little
crowd is waiting on the pavement
there, the leaders wheel to the right,
and we are in Hobart Town.
