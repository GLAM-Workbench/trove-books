In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
Dearly beloved in the Lord, seeing that it is a common custom hallowed by use
in the Church throughout the ages to commend to God’s gracious keeping all His
servants departed this life in His faith and fear, we are gathered here to commend to
Him the soul of our late Sovereign Lord King George and to give thanks to our
Heavenly Father, through Jesus Christ, for his life and reign.
I heard a voice from Heaven saying unto me:
Answer: Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord.
PSALM 121
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills : from whence cometh my help.
My help cometh even from the Lord : Who hath made heaven and earth.
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved : and He that keepeth thee will not sleep.
Behold, He that keepeth Israel : shall neither slumber nor sleep.
The Lord Himself is thy keeper : the Lord is thy defence upon thy right hand;
So that the sun shall not burn thee by day : neither the moon by night.
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil : yea, it is even He that shall keep
thy soul.
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in : from this time forth
for evermore.
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost;
As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be: world without end. Amen.
THE
LESSON
Revelation of St. John,
chapter 7, verses 9 to end
HYMN
Palms of glory, raiment bright,
Crowns that never fade away,
Gird and deck the Saints in light,
Priests, and kings, and conquerors they
Yet the conquerors bring their palms
To the Lamb amidst the Throne,
And proclaim in joyful psalms
Victory through His Cross alone.
Kings their crowns for harps resign,
Crying, as they strike the chords,
"Take the Kingdom, it is Thine,
King of kings, and Lord of lords.”
THE
Round the Altar priests confess,
If their robes are white as snow,
’Twas the Saviour’s Righteousness,
And His Blood, that made them so.
They were mortal too like us;
O, when we like them must die,
May our souls translated thus
Triumph, reign, and shine on high.
Amen.
ORATION
Delivered by His Excellency the Governor of Tasmania
Sir Ronald Cross, Bart.


HYMN
The Saints of God! their conflict past,
And life’s long battle won at last,
No more they need the shield or sword,
They cast them down before their Lord:
O happy Saints! for ever blest,
At Jesus’ feet how safe you rest!
The Saints of God! their wanderings done,
No more their weary course they run,
No more they faint, no more they fall,
No foes oppress, no fears appal;
O happy Saints! for ever blest,
In that dear home how sweet your rest!
The Saints of God! life’s voyage o’er.
Safe landed on that blissful shore,
No stormy tempests now they dread,
No roaring billows left their head:
O happy Saints! for ever blest,
In that calm haven of your rest!
O God of Saints, to Thee we cry;
O Saviour, plead for us on high;
O Holy Ghost, our Guide and Friend,
Grant us Thy grace till life shall end;
That with all Saints our rest may be
In that bright Paradise with Thee. Amen
THE PRAYERS
Let us pray.
Lord, have mercy upon us.
Christ, have mercy upon us.
Lord, have mercy upon us
Our Father, etc.
V Enter not into judgment with Thy servant, O Lord;
R.: For in Thy sight shall no man living be justified.
V Grant unto him eternal rest
R.: And let perpetual light shine upon him.
V We believe verily to see the goodness of the Lord;
R.: In the land of the living.
V O Lord, hear our prayer
R.: And let our cry come unto Thee.
O Father of all, we pray to Thee for those whom we love, but see no longer.
Grant them Thy peace; let light perpetual shine upon them; and in Thy loving
wisdom and almighty power work in them the good purpose of Thy perfect Will:
through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
ACT OF COMMEMORATION
O Almighty God, the God of the spirits of all flesh: multiply, we beseech Thee,
to George our late beloved King, and to those who rest in Jesus, the manifold blessings
of Thy love, that the good work which Thou didst begin in them may be perfected
unto the day of Jesus Christ. And of Thy mercy, O heavenly Father, vouchsafe that
we, who now serve Thee here on earth, may at the last, together with them, be found
meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; for the sake of the same
Thy Son Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.


AN ACT OF THANKSGIVING
for the life and reign of King George V
of King George VI
Now thank we all our God,
All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
With heart, and hands, and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
The Son, and Him Who reigns
With Them in highest Heaven,
The One Eternal God,
In Whom His world rejoices;
Who from our mother’s arms
Hath bless’d us on our way
Whom earth and Heav’n adore,
For thus it was, is now,
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.
And shall be evermore. Amen.
AN ACT OF DEDICATION
HYMN
Saviour, Blessed Saviour,
Listen whilst we sing
Hearts and voices raising
Praises to our King;
All we have we offer,
All we hope to be,
Body, soul, and spirit,
All we yield to Thee.
Nearer, ever nearer,
Christ, we draw to Thee,
Deep in adoration
Bending low the knee;
Thou for our redemption
Cam’st on earth to die;
Thou, that we might follow,
Hast gone up on high.
Great and ever greater
Are Thy mercies here;
True and everlasting
Are the glories there:
Where no pain, nor sorrow,
Toil, nor care, is known,
Where the Angel-legions
Circle round Thy Throne
Dark and ever darker
Was the wintry past,
Now a ray of gladness
O’er our path is cast:
Every day that passeth,
Every hour that flies.
Tells of love unfeigned,
Love that never dies.
(During this Hymn your
Clearer still and clearer
Dawns the light from Heav’n,
In our sadness bringing
News of sin forgiven;
Life has lost its shadows,
Pure the light within;
Thou hast shed Thy radiance
On a world of sin.
Brighter still and brighter
Glows the western sun,
Shedding all its gladness
O’er our work that’s done;
Time will soon be over,
Toil and sorrow past,
May we, Blessed Saviour,
Find a rest at last.
Onward, ever onward,
Journeying o’er the road
Worn by Saints before us,
Journeying on to God;
Leaving all behind us,
May we hasten on,
Backward never looking
Till the prize is won.
Bliss, all bliss excelling,
When the ransom’d soul,
Earthly toils forgetting,
Finds its promised goal;
Where in joys unheard of
Saints with Angels sing,
Never weary raising
Praises to their King. Amen.
Offerings will be collected)


Let us pray
For the Queen and all in authority under her.
Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseeech Thee to bless
our Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth, the Parliaments in all her dominions, and all
who are in authority under her; that they may order all things in wisdom, righteous-
ness, and peace, to the honour and glory of Thy Holy Name, and the good of Thy
Church and people; through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
