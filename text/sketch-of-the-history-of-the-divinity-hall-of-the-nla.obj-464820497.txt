SKETCH OF THE HISTORY
THE DIVINITY HALE
OF THE
IlMjskjtmaw C'ftwwft uf (^iwmislanfl
The Members of the Presbyterian Church are aware that the
building known as the Presbyterian Divinity Hall has been with-
drawn from the Church. This took place towards the end of last
May. At the same time the unexpended portion of the funds that
had been provided for the establishment of the Divinity Hall-
amounting, it is believed, to above £7oo—was also withdrawn from
the Church.
The reasons for this proceeding are involved in considerable
obscurity. The only explanations that have hitherto appeared have
been given, first, in a circular issued towards the end of May last;
and bearing the printed signature of the Rev. Colin McCulloch,
and, secondly, in an article entitled, “Presbyterian Divinity
Hall,” and marked at the close, “ Communicated,” which appeared
in the Queensland Evangelical Standard of the 19th January last.
The circular referred to contained a statement by Mr. M‘Culloch,
a letter signed by him as “ Trustee for the Donors ” of Divinity
Hall Funds, requesting the Trustees of Wickham Terrace Church
property to take possession of the Divinity Hall, along with Library
and furniture, and a reply from the latter Trustees intimating their
willingness to comply with this request. The reasons assigned in
this circular for the withdrawal of the building, &c., were expressed
as follows—that


“ Whilst no efforts had been made to get the Churches to contribute
•< to the scheme (viz. for the Training of Young Men for the Ministry),
“ the General Assembly, by their late proceedings (at the meeting in
“ May last), gave strong proofs of their desire to ignore the authority
“ of myself (Mr, McCulloch) as Trustee of the funds, and to adopt a
u policy of dispersion —dispersion of funds and dispersion of
“ Students; ” and that there had been on the part of the General
Assembly a “ very flagrant, glaring, and continuous breach and
“ violation of the understanding on which they (the Donors) had
“ permitted their funds to be expended.” The Donors stated they
had seen it to be their duty to instruct Mr. McCulloch, “as their
“ Trustee, to put an end to the interference of the General Assembly
“ in the management of the Divinity Hall,” and the Trustees of
Wickham Terrace Church expressed their “ belief that Mr.
“ McCulloch should immediately communicate to the parties who
“ are assuming a position they have no right to hold, and exercising
“ or seeking to exercise, an authority over the property of others
“ for which they have no warrant, that steps have been taken to
“ prevent further action or interference on their part.” The
circular also intimated the wish of the Donors that a council of
gentlemen be appointed to carry out the scheme for the education of
young men for the Ministry, which was thus apparently to be taken
out of the hands of the General Assembly.
This circular was immediately followed by a letter, addressed to
certain officers of the General Assembly by the Solicitor of these
Trustees, intimating that they had taken possession of the Hall
building, and that the General Assembly was debarred from any
further use of it.
In the article in the Queensland Evangelical Standard of 19th
January last similar reasons are given for the withdrawal of the
Divinity Hall building, and the taking of the educational work of
the Hall out of the hands of the General Assembly. It is said,
“In erecting these buildings, the Donors further expected that
“ the Students should be kept at their studies there throughout the
“ year with as little vacation as the other public schools of the
“ colony,” “At last General Assembly, however, they were pain-
“ fully disappointed to find that that venerable body would consent
“ only to a six-weeks’ Session, and resolved to move away the
“ Students thereafter to each of the Presbyteries.”
The statements quoted are the only definite statements that have
appeared in explanation of the summary action taken by the Donors
and the Trustees of Wickham Terrace Church in the withdrawal of
the building erected for the meetings of the Divinity Hall. It
ought to be added that the circular from which we have quoted was
issued privately, no copy of it having, so far as is known, been sent


to any of the members of Assembly against whom it was chiefly
directed.
As the best refutation of the charges brought against the General
Assembly is to be found in the history of the Divinity Hall move-
ment, I purpose sketching that history, and that as far as possible in
the words of the printed Minutes, Deports, and Circulars that have
been issued by the General Assembly or its officials.
The movement for the Training of Young Men for the Ministry
among ourselves- —the outcome of much previous anxious thought
and discussion among the ministers and members of the Church—
took shape at the General Assembly of 1872, when “The Rev. Report of Pro-
“ Colin McCulloch presented an overture to the Assembly, calling l ssen i
“ attention to the fact that much spiritual destitution exists in the bly, May, 1872.
“ Colony of Queensland, and that the power of the Church to meet
“ the spiritual wants of the people is seriously obstructed by the want
“ of facilities for the religious education of the young, and praying
“ that the General Assembly take into consideration the subject of
“ educating the youth of the Church and the training of young men
“ for the Ministry.”
“In supporting this overture, Mr. McCulloch spoke of the vast
“ importance of making ample provision for the religious education
“ of the young, and of the difficulty of providing for such education,
“ especially in the case of young persons sent from the country
“ districts to attend the Grammar and other schools in towns. To
“ obviate these difficulties, and provide for the proper moral and
“ religious training of such pupils, he proposed the establishment of
“ such an institution as those established in some of the other
“ colonies, where pupils might not only be boarded, but instructed,
“ or at least aided and directed in their studies, and have their
“ moral and religious training attended to. Mr. McCulloch entered
“ into a variety of calculations to shew that such an institution
“ might be made self-supporting, and shewed how there might be
“ engrafted upon it an advanced seminary for the special preparation
“ of young men for the Ministry.
“ Mr. Hay approved highly of Mr. McCulloch’s proposal, but
“ thought so large a scheme premature at present. He thought
“ the energies of the Church should, in the meantime, he devoted to
“ the special training for the Ministry of young men who have
“ already received a fair measure of education. To effect this,
“ special departments of instruction might be undertaken by different
“ ministers or others, and evening classes opened on fixed days, in
“ the week, so as to suit the Students engaged during the day in
“ work or business. Too much should not be attempted at once ;
“ but a few subjects studied at two or three meetings weekly, the
“ teachers acting as private tutors, would result in very respectable

“ progress at tlie end of twelve months ; and this plan could be
“ carried out with more or less ease in any town in the colony.
“ Dr. Nelson approved of such a scheme as Mr. McCulloch’s,
“ and urged its claims on the ground of the necessity of beginning
‘‘ religious training at the earliest possible age. Other members
“of Assembly spoke to a similar effect; Mr. McKay suggesting
“ the delivery, from time to time, of courses of lectures by the
“ ministers of the Church on special branches of Theological study.
“ After a very long and full discussion, it was unanimously re-
“ solved that the following be appointed a committee to carry out
“ the object of the overture :—The Rev. Dr. Nelson, and Messrs.
“ McAra and McKay, the ministers of the Presbytery of Brisbane,
“ with Messrs. McKeachie, H. M. Nelson, and A. Thomson, elders,
“ with power to add to their number; Mr. McCulloch, convener.”
This extract has been given at full length, in order to meet what
is suggested in the circular quoted above —that tha movement for
the training of young men for the Ministry among ourselves began
with those who, at a later staye, offered their aid in this good work.
The credit is due to Mr. McCulloch of having first laid a definite
proposal on the subject before the Courts of the Church, nor is this
credit diminished by the fact that he did so after conference with
other ministers of the Church, who had been giving their minds to
the solution of the problem; but the movement originated and was
formulated in the Church, and not among the donors of the moneys
subsequently subscribed.
1873.—1 n May, 1873, the Convener reported that he had received
subscriptions for the scheme proposed amounting to £577, and among
them “a bag containing 500 sovereigns from a Christian donor,
“ who refuses to publish his name, and who couples his munificent
“ gift with this suggestion; —That in the event of the projected
“ institution assuming the twofold shape proposed, £2OO 'should be
“ devoted to the classical department, and £BOO to the special
« department of training young men for the Ministry.”
This 11 suggestion” is the only condition appended to any sub-
scription in this amount of £577, so far as noted in the Minutes or
Reports for 1873. It is also to be observed that the subscriptions
were reported by Mr. McCulloch as given to him as Convener of
the General Assembly’s Committee. No intimation was given that
they were placed in his hands as trustee for the donors ; and if the
anonymous donor and the others have, since May, 1873, transferred
these moneys from Mr. McCulloch, the Assembly’s Convener of
Committee, to Mr. McCulloch, as their trustee, it follows that they
have broken faith with the General Assembly. It is only further to
be noticed here that no intimation has been given that these £577
are not included among the Divinity Hall Funds which have been


■withdrawn from the General Assembly along with the Building and
Library.
1874. —No report of the Committee for the Training of Young
Men for the Ministry was published with the Assembly’s Minutes
of this year. By May of this year, however, the funds subscribed
for the Divinity Hall had risen to over ,£l2OO ; but intimation was
made by Mr, McCulloch that in the meantime they were to be held
by the donors, to serve as a Defence Fund on his behalf in a civil
action, with which, it was said, he was then threatened. This fact may
be noted along with the charges of “ gross, flagrant, and continuous
“ violation of understanding,” which have been so freely brought
against the General Assembly in name of the donors.
1875. —The meeting of the General Assembly in May of this
year was a very important period in the history of the Divinity
Hall. The Convener intimated that the subscriptions now amounted
to £1682; that the sum of £376 had been devoted to the procur-
ing of a Theological Library for the use of the students, and “ that Minutes of
“ the givers of the funds would consent to a limited outlay from e a y® r 1 a B V^ ssem "
u them for building a temporary hall for receiving the library, and Appendix B.
“ would furnish it as a class-room, and that a suitable corner on the
u Wickham Terrace Church grounds would probably be obtained
“ for a time, and that the whole would be transferred at the will of
“ the General Assembly to its own chosen site, so soon as tho
“ Church is prepared to do this.” These points were embodied in
the Report of the Committee laid before the Assembly by Mr.
McCulloch as Convener, together with a recommendation to the
Assembly “ to make arrangements for a six weeks Session, to termi-
“ nate a little before the meeting of each General Assembly, during
“ which the students shall be under the care and direction of a Board
* l of Examiners, whose main duties will be to aid, review, and sup-
“ plement the studies prosecuted under the care and direction of the
“ Presbyteries, within whose bounds the students reside during the
“ rest of the year, the Board of Examiners to be nominated by the
“ General Assembly, and to report to the Assembly the result of
“ their labours.”
This report was adopted by the General Assembly, the Board of
Examiners, or Divinity Hall, was constituted, and it was resolved,
among other things, “ that the Assembly instruct its to Minutes of
“ carry out at as early a date as possible the proposal for the erection e Mayf S i B 7s.
“ of a temporary hall for receiving the library, and furnished with No’. 52.
“ the requisite fittings for a students’ class-room ; and also to make
“ arrangements for holding a Session of six weeks’ duration,” as
recommended by the Committee.
Attention is here called to two points. First. — the
General Assembly has been charged “with assuming a position


“ they have bo right to hold, and exercising, or seeking to exercise,
“ sn authority over the property of others, for which they have no
“ warrant,” Mr. McCulloch was a consenting and leading party
to the above Resolution of Assembly instructing its own Committee
to carry out the proposal for the erection of a temporary hall for
library and class-room. This instruction, however, remained a dead
letter, as the hall was erected without the Committee being troubled
even to give its approval of the plan. Secondly. —lt is charged
against the Assembly, apparently as a capricious innovation on
Mr. McCulloch’s previous rule and practice, that in May last “ it gave strong proofs
Circular, May. u o f a to adopt a policy of dispersion of students or, as it
18r7 ’ . is otherwise put, “ that it would consent only to a six weeks’
Oueemiand “ Session, and resolved to move away the students thereafter to each
stan£d a Jan. “ of the Presbyteries ;” while the fact was that, the six weeks’ Session
19th, 1878. and the dispersion of the students over the Presbyteries for the rest
ef the year, was an arrangement adopted with Mr. McCulloch’s
concurrence, and at his recommendation, and by last May had been
in operation for two years.
As exception had been taken at this Assembly (1875) to certain
acts on the part of the Convener, chiefly touching the selection of
the books for the library, in which he ignored the members of his
Committee, it was agreed, in order to counteract the idea that
this scheme was confined to one congregation, to issue a circular
signed by all the members of the Committee, commending the
scheme to the Church. A note appended to this circular, dated
Wickham Terrace Manse, August 8, 1875, and signed “ Colin
Joint Circular, “ McCulloch, Convener,”, says, “ Immediate steps were taken to
Aug- 3rd, 1875. « carry out the plan of a Divinity Hall. The site was granted on
“ the Wickham Terrace Church ground.”
1876. —The Divinity Hall was opened in March of this year; and
in a pamphlet, issued on that occasion, Mr. McCulloch says, that
The Divinity though the Trustees of Wickham Terrace Congregation “ could not
Hail; account “ legally give away the ground on which the hall is built, they
PageT 11 ’ &C ’ “ offered every requisite guarantee for securing to the Assembly all
“ right to, and the sole disposal of, the hall and its furnishings.”
At the General Assembly of May, 1876, Mr. McCulloch inti-
mated that it had been put into the hands of a solicitor to make out
Minutes Of “ a lease for twenty-one years, by which time, perhaps, the Church
General Assem- « wou iq l )C able to accomplish the larger collegiate undertaking to
'Appendix ° “ which we look forward, and, if not, that the lease can again be
“renewed;” and that the solicitor “only awaited the complete-
“ ment of the incorporation of our Church, to take immediate
“ steps to draw the lease.”
A detailed statement of the moneys expended on the library and
class-room was laid before the Committee and General Assembly for


their approved, and showed a balance of still unexpended funds
amounting to .£7.31.
In its Minute regarding these matters the Assembly “ specially Minutes °| ssem _
“ expresses its hearty thanks to the generous donors of the means bly> May, is 76.
“by which so much has been accomplished, and also to the No - 48 -
“ Trustees of the Wickham Terrace Congregation for so kindly
“ leasing to the General Assembly the portion of their property
“ required as a site for the Divinity Hall.” By the same Minute
“ the General Assembly approved of the use of the hall for young
“ men’s classes, at the discretion and under the superintendence of
“ the Board of Examiners.” The Convener in his report had re-
quested the Assembly to sanction this use of the hall.
The history of the movement for the Training of Young Men for
the Ministry among ourselves has thus been traced from its biy, May, 1876.
adoption by the General Assembly of 1872 to the meeting of the Appendix B.
Assembly of 1876.
At this point I would call attention to the following facts as
established by the proceeding narrative ;-That the “ high aims ”
“of securing the means of raising' up a thoroughly educated 1877
« Ministryof “ keeping up, and not lowering, the standard of
“ qualification deemed necessary by the Home Churches.” were not
confined to the donors of these moneys, but were shared with, if
not suggested to, them by the General Assembly ;
That the Assembly, in virtue of its inalienable right and prero-
gative, made its own arrangements for the education of its students,
appointed the Examiners or Teachers, prescribed a course of study
for the students, assigned subjects of tuition to the examiners, and
required from them, and from the Committee for Training, through
their Convener, an annual account of their stewardship ;
That in making and carrying out all these arrangements the
Trustee of the Donors, in his capacity of Convener of the
Assembly’s Committee, was not only a consenting, but an active
agent;
That in asking the sanction of the Assembly for the expenditure Minutes
of moneys on the building and library, in reporting for the approval 1876.
of the Assembly the manner in which these moneys had been laid Appendix B.
out, in asking the Assembly to allow the use of the hall for holding
evening classes, in permitting the Assembly’s Divinity Hall to meet
within it, and in using the name of the Presbyterian Church of
Queensland to designate it, the donors virtually invested the
Assembly with that very authority over their property which they
charge the Assembly with seeking unwarrantably to exercise ;
That the lease “ granted ” by the Wickham Terrace Trustees
was for a period of twenty-one years, without stipulation of any


conditions as to the arrangements which the General Assembly
might make for the education of its students, and without any
impatient demand on the part of the donors, that the proportionate
effort for the same object should be made by the Church at large
immediately.
1877.—The Minutes of the Assembly of 1877 record little more
regarding the Divinity Hall than the resignation of the Convener
of the Committee and Board connected with it. What follows
then is written under correction, and with the sole desire to place
before the members of the Church the facts, out of which subsequent
complications have arisen.
When the Committee for the Training of Young Men for the
Ministry met, the Rev. C. McCulloch, as Convener, read a draft
report for adoption by the Committee preparatory to its being laid
before the Assembly. That draft gave no hint of any “ gross,”
“ flagrant,” or “continuous breach” of conditions, but contained the
two following proposals :
That a greatly extended Session of the Divinity Hall should
be substituted for the Session of six weeks; and
That the Board of Examiners should be converted into a College
of Professors.
Before considering these proposals, which were brought forward
without previous notice to the Committee or to the Board of
Examiners, Members of the Committee desired explanations from
the Convener regarding the following facts :
That the Committee had not been called together since the
Assembly of last year,—no new or unusual thing in the history of
this Committee ;
That the Committee had never been consulted in the selection of
books for the library,—a complaint also made before ;
That the lease of the site for the hall promised to the Assembly
in May, 1876, had not yet been executed;
That certain arrangements made for holding evening classes in
the Hall, during the recent Divinity Hall Session, had been made
without the authority of the Board of Examiners, and in such a
manner as materially to interfere with the efficient instruction of the
Divinity Students;
That no steps had been taken to lift a considerable number of
annual subscriptions that had been promised from various parts of
the Church.
In consequence of the discussion thus raised, the Convener with-
drew his Report, but was permitted to lay it before the Assembly in
his own name.


When the subject came up in the Assembly, the right to enquire
into the mode in which the affairs of the Divinity Hall were managed,
asserted in the Committee, was still more fully exercised, with the
result that Mr. McCulloch resigned his position both as a Member
and Convener of all the Committees of the General Assembly, on
which he had for so many years been serving; and it was only after
exhausting all the resources of expostulation and entreaty that the
Assembly accepted his resignation.
It will be apparent that the real ground of offence given by the
General Assembly was, —not that the Church as a whole had not yet
risen to the degree of earnestness and liberality to which the Donors
desired to stimulate and encourage it, for these were willing to wait
twenty-one years for the full result, —not that the Assembly was less
anxious than previously to rear a thoroughly educated Ministry, for
the very opposite was known to be the case, —not that it contemplated
any retrograde movement by limiting the means or methods of
theological training already adopted, for full proof had not yet been
made of these, —nor that the Assembly proposed to make any use
of the Divinity Hall which the Donors had not themselves sanctioned.
No breach of any conditions laid down by the Donors was charged
even by their Trustee, or could be charged, against the General
Assembly when it met last May. The alleged “ gross, flagrant, and
“ continuous breach of conditions ” is a mere pretext, subsequently
brought forward, to justify in the eyes of those not acquainted with
the facts a transaction for Avhich otherwise there was neither moral
nor legal justification. The occasion of the summary procedure
of the Donors and Trustees must be sought for in the stand taken
by members of last General Assembly in Committee, and in the
Assembly itself, in regard to the action of their Convener.
They declined to sanction without criticism or enquiry, the
unauthorised actions of the Convener. They resented the assump-
tion that he, as Trustee for the Donors, had a special right to control
the manner in which the education of the Assembly’s students was
to be carried on. They declined to proceed at his bidding to intro-
duce changes on the teaching machinery and arrangements of the
Divinity Hall, the wisdom or necessity of which had not yet been
proved.
c is not according to fact, that the Assembly “ would consent Article in
‘ only to a six weeks’ session, and resolved to move away the eensl^
‘ Students thereafter to each of the Presbyteries.” Neither the Standard? Jan
Committee nor the Assembly considered the proposal for a lengthened 19th ’ 187 a
session. They simply left matters as they were until they could
enquire whether any change were advisable. In like manner, the
proposal to substitute a College of Professors with a Principal for
the Hoard of Examiners and Convener, was not even discussed.

The change of title would not in any way augment the efficiency of
the Teachers in the Divinity Hall, while it was felt to be somewhat
out of keeping with the infantile dimensions of our Church.
If then there has been a breach of conditions anywhere, it lies at
the door of those who proposed to alter the arrangements on the
basis of which the lease of the hall site was promised, and the
building and library said to have been placed at the disposal of the
General Assembly, and who have made the Assembly’s non-adoption
of their new proposals a pretext for cutting it off from the use of the
hall and library.
I forbear to add further comments, or to notice the more recent
movements in this matter. To do so would be to anticipate dis-
cussions that must arise in the General Assembly.
Ministers and Elders of our Church of the highest standing,
ability, character, and loyalty to our cause, have been slandered and
insulted in the Circular and Article so often quoted —productions
not less remarkable for the suggestion of what is false than for the
suppression and distortion of what is true. These Ministers and
Elders have ‘borne this in silence; but the time has come for the
true state and bearing of this question being made known, and the
above is a contribution towards the attainment of this object.
The General Assembly of our Church is too deeply interested in
the thorough training of its Students to deal with it in a spirit of
levity or partisanship, and may be trusted to act both with justice
to others, and with a due regard to its own rights and privileges.
