THE
CONDITION AND PROSPECTS OF AUSTRALIA
AS COMPARED WITH OLDER LANDS.
The Right Worshipful the Mayor having introduced the Lecturer of
the evening,
Mr. H. J. Wrixon said:?Mr. Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, I can assure
you that it gives me great pleasure to appear before you this evening.
Indeed, I esteem it a great honour to have this opportunity of meeting such
a large assemblage of my fellow-colonists, and I venture to observe that it
would be well for us if the institution of the public platform had a greater
hold on this country than it has (hear, hear,) because we must bear in mind
that in such a community as ours everything depends on the proper enlighten-
ment of public opinion. The pulpit, the press, the political arena, our noble
system of jurisprudence, are all great agencies furthering the one good cause;
but I think that, in addition to them all, the public platform has its own
particular merits. From it you can hear the views and opinions of men
untrammelled by the restraints of etiquette, or by considerations such as
may limit the expression of opinion in other arenas. I certainly venture
to hope that as the progress of the country continues, and we get a class more
and more identified with Australia, we shall find the public platform become
one of our recognised institutions, doing its share of work in enlightening and
directing the public opinion of the country. (Hear.) Now, Mr. Mayoi, and
ladies and gentlemen, I am going to speak to you to-night about our country.
In any age, and in every clime, such a subject ought to be an interesting one
to those who are settled in the land to bo spoken about; but it seems to
me that there are particular reasons why we should inquire into the
condition and prospects of Victoria at the present time, because I think it
must be noticed by all who pay attention to our public and social affairs, that
we have a very considerable class of rather unreasonable critics among us.
(Applause.) I do not at all make any imputation on the motives or the


intention of those critics, but I only observe that it is a fact which I think
must have struck any of us who are attached to this country as a painful fact
?that we have a considerable number of persons, intelligent persons, persons
of position and rank in our land, who take the most gloomy and adverse view
of the condition and prospects of Australia. Now, some of these critics feel,
no doubt, that though with us they are not of us. They are looking forward
to going home, and spending the evening of their days in scenes that are
endeared to them by the recollection of childhood, and so they regard them -
selves as mere birds of passage, and not in any way particularly interested in
maintaining the credit and character of Australia. (Cheers.) But there are
others who are bound to this country, ?men who have given hostages, as
Bacon says, to fortune; men who are pledged to society, who have their
families here, whose home this country is, and yet whom you will hear day by
day expressing none but the most melancholy and craven views of this land,
which is to be their home and the home of their children after them. It is, I
can assure you, not a mere story, but a fact, that not very long ago, an
acquaintance of mine?and a worthy, intelligent man, too, an educated man,
and what is more, a young man, and not naturally entitled, therefore, to take
Very gloomy views of affairs, ?it is not long ago, I say, that such an acquaint-
ance of mine informed me that for a considerable period he had despaired of
Victoria, but that when recent occurrences, more or less present to the minds
of all, happened, he gave us up finally.
I think this, then, is a rather serious question for us who belong to this
country. Possibly, Ido not address many men who were born or, like myself
brought up here; but I certainly do address a great many who are fixed
permanently to Australia, who can look to no other country if this fails them,
and who have no other prospect if this land proves unable to afford them a home
such as they desire. It Is therefore, I say, a serious question for us to inquire,
if this gloomy view of our affairs is a sound one. It is an important matter
for us, by a wise, careful, and critical consideration, to determine whether we
really are all attached to a sinking ship; all inhabitants, as it were, of a city of
the plain, doomed to destruction, and with no mountains of refuge to fly to.
You will quite understand me, that I do not at all deprecate on the
contrary, I most highly approve of ?having a healthy sense of our
national defects. I think such a sense is a most important feature
of national character, and one without which no nation can make real
progress; but there is a great difference between being sensible of defects and
having a keen sense of the dangers that may encompass us, and being possessed
by that craven, abject, woe-begone spirit that marks too many of those who
ought to take a prominent interest in our affairs. Nations, in many respects,
are not unlike individuals. No single man can really become a worthy man,
develop his character properly, or perform his duty effectually, unless he is


conscious of his weak points, guards against them and endeavours to remedy
them. That is necessary for every individual who wishes to become a real
man. But what would you say if you saw an individual adopt towards himself
that craven tone which some of our citizens adopt towards this country.
What would you think of an individual if he went about among his acquaint-
ances saying, ? Well, lam certainly a most miserable fellow. I have no right
principles, I am utterly without energy, my prospects are barren; and as for
emulating my respectable parents,?why, the idea is absurd.? I think you
would be very apt to take such a man at his own valuation, and believe him
to be quite as miserable a fellow as he said he was. Now, I say, before we
give in?l speak as an Australian?to this abject tone of criticism, which
misrepresents equally our institutions and our social tendencies, we ought in
all seriousness to inquire whether such a view is reasonable or the opposite. Of
course, if it is true, it will be a most melancholy fact, but w<s must accept it.
But let us critically and carefully inquire whether it is so.
Now, the only way you can inquire is by comparing our condition with that
of older lands, because, let me say, I have noticed that these severe critics of
ours seem to think that their case is made out when they point to this that is
wrong, to that that is doubtful, and to a third that is dangerous in our state.
They seem to think that then their case is made out; and that they are
entitled, on pointing out certain defects, to profess despair of the country, and
to separate themselves entirely from its service. But you must recollect that, in
the whole of human society, in every age of the world for the last 6000 years in
which we have been acquainted with it, in every clime, and among every
people, there has been carried on a constant struggle between evil and good;
as one of the most philosophical statesmen of our age has remarked?l allude
to Guizot??Evil and good appear to dispute for the mastery of society,
because they simultaneously possess it, because they co-exist in it.? And the
whole of what is noble in human life depends on manfully maintaining the
struggle on behalf of good influences against evil influences, and so evolving from
that contest what is called progress. (Applause.) Therefore, I say, we will not
allow ourselves to be borne down by gloomy anticipations because certain defects
are pointed out, and certain difficulties shown in bur social and political condition.
We will recollect that there have always been difficulties to be met, always
been dangers to be avoided, always been 'prevalent in human society not a
little that good and honourable men cannot approve of ; and what we will do
before we despair of our future, give over this young country and renounce
its service?as most of these gloomy critics do?is, we will look to other states
of society in other countries and in other times, and see how they stand in
comparison. And I venture to say that if you will follow me to-night in that
inquiry, so far from having any reason to despond, so far from finding any
foundation for a craven distrust of the destinies of Australia, you will feel


more disposed than ever to regard cheerfully the present, and to look hopefully
towards the future. (Applause.) You quite observe, Mr. Mayor, and ladies
and gentlemen, the design of my argument. I want to show that, though
difficulties and dangers encompass our present position?as undoubtedly
they do, ?they are not only not in a greater, but are in a lesser degree,
than have faced men in other ages, and now face men in other lands.
For example, take the good old times, for often critics, such as I have
alluded to, look back with regret to ?the good old times.? If there
is anything wrong in our condition, if anything bad happens in our
political or social world, they advert at once to the good old times
when such things could not happen. Let us look, then, at the good old
times. Let us see how the good old times would have got on if those on whom
it then devolved to maintain the struggle on behalf of good influences quietly
despaired, said that things were too bad, and washed their hands of all trouble
and responsibility. Let us look and see what kind of difficulties they had to
contend with. Take a century ago as a fair test, because that period involves
a remarkable and brilliant period of English history. Take a century ago, and
look at the condition of England. At that time you know the aristocracy were
at the head of affairs. They were not, as now, merely ornamental in the
state. They were the real rulers of the nation. They led society; they
governed in politics ; they influenced the judicial department; and generally
constituted and represented the enlightenment of Great Britain. Now,
what was the condition of this aristocracy? Glance for a moment at
the state of religious thought and belief among them. You find it
forcibly expressed by Bishop Butler, in the advertisement to his great
work?the ?Analogy.? He describes it as taken for granted that Chris-
tianity is not so much a subject for inquiry, but that it is looked upon as at
length discovered to be fictitious, treated as such ?among all people of
discernment,? and set up as a ? principal subject of mirth and ridicule.?
If you would take the moral condition of the aristocracy, refer to the
literature of that day, and you get a striking picture of those who then led
and gave the tone to English society. I cannot well go into the details
which would be revealed by reference to that literature, but I might give you
a simple illustration, by which you can judge whether we are much worse
than the people who lived in that time. You have all heard, no doubt, of the
marriage difficulty of our day. It is the principal theme of lectures and rail-
ings in newspapers of all kinds in the old country; and the fact that young
men do not marry is regarded and represented as a clear proof of the bad
tendencies of our age. As to why they do not marry, and what can be their
objections, I am unable to say?it is not a subject I can speak of authorita-
tively, myself; (laughter)'Jbut if it is so, all I can say is that it is exceedingly
wrong. But now look at the good old times. You will find if you inquire


into the history of social life at that time, that they had then to contend with
a difficulty which does not seem, as well as I can gather, to be felt in an equal
degree now, viz., that the young ladies would not marry then, any more than
the young men. You will find in the fashionable world, in the aristocracy of
that day, just the same contempt for married life, for the honourable estate of
matrimony and home life, that is now attributed to our young men. If you
refer to the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague, you will find her
lamenting this condition of affairs in the fashionable world. She says that
she is extremely sorry for the forlorn state of matrimony, which is as much
ridiculed by the young ladies as it used to he by the young men. This is not
her opinion only, because in the letters of the Princess Dowager the same
complaint is made. That shows how apt people are, dwelling on the dis-
advantages of the present, to magnify them unduly and think them worse
than those of any previous age. They seem to think that the evils we meet
are some strange thing that has happened to us. Look at the home press to-
day, and you will find this neglect to marry treated as something new and
extraordinary, and yet just the same evil in a much worse form characterised
the aristocracy of England, at a time when that aristocracy influenced the
whole of English society and gave, a tone to the whole of English thought.
Now, in the same way we complain in our community here?justly too, I
think?of the spirit of gambling evinced. We say that our gold-mines propa-
gate that spirit and give it scope; and there can be no doubt that when we
take into account all the drawbacks, social and material, we pay dearly enough
for our gold after all. But look at the good old times! We find that same
evil present them in a greater and more aggravated form. Gambling was a
main element in social life, not merely of the aristocracy but of the middle
classes. If you take, for example, that notable instance of gambling and
swindling, the South Sea scheme, you will see involved in that gigantic
gambling fraud not a few speculators of doubtful character?men who live by
their wits?hut some of the foremost men in England. No doubt, most of you
have in your minds the particulars of the history of that scheme; but I may
say, for the information of the younger portion of the audience (I will not go
into detail,) that it was something like what you see now and then done in this
country. Often you will hear of a mine of extraordinary richness, somewhere
in the Gipps Land ranges ?in a very out of the way place, which people
cannot easily get at. Numbers are induced to pay money for shares and calls
to the enterprising directors, and to go on doing so, till at last they wake up
to the fact that no one can make out where the mine really is, and all that
they can learn about their money is, that it has gone into the pockets of the
directors. That is exactly like what the South Sea scheme was. Perhaps
you will say, ? Oh, but that is against your argument, it shows that we are so
bad as they were.? I say, no. For this reason ?in that South Sea affair there


were mixed up the Chancellor of the Exchequer?he was one of the participators
two or three state ministers, several members of Parliament, and actually
some of the favourites of the Sovereign himself. So that these gambling frauds
in the good old times were not confined to a few gentlemen who, it is said,
maybe seen ?Under the Verandah? (laughter,) hut were participated in by
the leading statesmen and principal men of the country. Now, this aristocracy,
thus marked by the characteristics I have only glanced at,?because I cannot
go fully into the matter ?exercised absolute sway in the political world. It
constituted the whole of the political world of Great Britain. It was not
merely that it had influence, but it was everything. A considerable number
of the aristocracy owned boroughs that gave seats to Parliament. These
boroughs they sold just as people sell their houses or any other portion of their
property. If you look at the journals and magazines of the time you will see
in them advertisements from men wanting boroughs, and ready to pay for
them. The aristocracy had thus not only the direct influence of their position,
but they had the vast additional influence of commanding seats in Parliament,
and it was only a few of the great towns that had any independent repre-
sentation at all.
And what was the condition of the political world in such hands ? We hear,
unfortunately in our own time?and lam sorry to say, too, in our own country
of corruption, and a serious matter it is. But in that day it presented a
different aspect ?it was a regularly organised system, not struggled against
and reprobated, as I trust it ever will be by the people of this country (cheers)
not engaged in by a few men,themere outcasts of political life (applause;) itwas, I
say, an organised system, and adopted as a recognised principle of political
action. You find it permeating every part of the aristocratic House of Com-
mons of the last century. Not merely were political votes openly bought for
particular occasions, but members were regularly kept in the pay of the
ministry of f�e day. We are told that from �SOO to �BOO a-year was the
range of the allowances these gentlemen got, and they were expected for that
sum to be ready to vote whenever they were called upon, to attend at any hour,
and to go for whichever side they were told. On particular occasions, when
the need was pressing, money payments were made directly and openly for
votes, just as you would go into a shop now, and pay for a coat or a pair of
boots; and a striking feature about this corruption was, that votes were bought
for questions on which, perhaps, the whole destiny and safety of the kingdom
hung. It was not, as we sometimes hear, of votes being influenced on matters
of small importance, but votes were bought and paid for, to be given on mea-
sures for, for instance, ?declaring war or making peace at critical periods?
measures which might affect, perhaps, the very existence of the country. I could
give you an example in point. When the question came before Parliament, in the
last century, of ratifying the peace which had been made with Spain?a mea-


sure strongly objected to by the patriotic party in England?in order to carry
it through Parliament, a pay-office was opened under the auspices of Henry
Fox. �25,000 were paid away in bribes to members of Parliament in one
morning, and the gentleman who was paymaster on that occasion was after-
wards made a peer for his services in that corruption, and his descendants
figure now among the aristocracy of Great Britain, as the holders of a peerage
bought by such public conduct. Lord Macaulay describes part of the period
to which I refer as a time when anything short of direct embezzlement was
considered quite fair in public men; and Lord Bolingbroke says, that not merely
a pamphlet, but a regular treatise, ? under distinct heads,? could be written of
the corruption, dishonesty, and fraud which tainted every part of the state,
and to which (as he justly observes,) the principal men in the land had made
themselves parties. Now, all this, you see, was done openly, and without
rebuke: it was all done as using the legitimate and proper means of political
warfare. Public opinion, then, was not alive to the guilt and shame of such
transactions. That feeling was only beginning to tell towards the close of the
century. Why, one great secret of the astonishing success and popularity of
the two Pitts?Earl Chatham, in the first instance, and his son, William Pitt,
in the second?was the simple fact that it was known that they were both
above personal meanness or corruption. That was thought something so extra-
ordinary?it s5 went home to the hearts of English people (I mean the
humbler classes,) that they were each able to take- the nation by storm, and,
notwithstanding all their mistakes, errors, and defects of character, they
have remained enshrined ever since in the memories of their countrymen,
not, I am sure, merely on account of their talents, but because they were known
to be above personal corruption, and to be animated by a patriotism pure as it
was ardent. (Applause.)
But, indeed, I need scarcely further illustrate, in detail, this view of the
condition of the political world of the last century. You all know that the
stage and the players are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time. I
suppose a good many of you have gone to see the ? Man of the World,? in
another place?to use parliamentary phrase. (Laughter.) 1 am, myself,
acquainted with a gentleman ?a very intelligent man, too, though not given
much to literature?who went to see that play, and came away with the firm
conviction in his mind that the play was expressly written with a view to our
political defects, or at least that it was touched up for and pointed at our political
evils. This friend of mine, I should say, looks at everything in the blackest
way possible and takes the very worst view of our condition, so when he saw
that play, he firmly believed that it referred to our difficulties. Now, I
suppose, you are aware that it really was pointed at political wrongs, but at
those of a century ago, when it was written for the express purpose of
satirising and exposing the political abuses of that day. If you look at


the original text of the ? Man of the World,? you will see in how much worse
a condition they were in at that time than we can he supposed to be now.
The ?Man of the World? shows how to achieve success in the walks of
political life. You will find that he described lords, members of Parliament,
judges, generals, and bishops as suppliant appendages to the minister in power.
He says, ?The places of fashionable resort are crowded with purse-proud
upstarts, who got their riches from lottery-tickets or gambling in Change
Alley.? He describes the distinction between a knave and an honest man as
mere nonsense; and he lays down the principle of the ?twa consciences, which
it is necessary, he declares, for men to have in public life. He describes his own
career in this way to his son, whom he is endeavouring to bring up in the way
he should go:?? Sir, I bowed, and watched, and attended, and dangled upon the
great man until I got into the very bowels of his confidence. Hah! got my
snack of the clothing, the foraging, the contracts, the lottery-tickets, apd all the
political bonuses, till at length I became a much wealthier man than one-half
of the golden calves I had been so long a-bowing to.? So that you see
members of Parliament in those days seem to have got rich by extracting
?snacks? from contracts and lottery-tickets. He also describes to his son how
he gained an election, viz., by bribing the electors all round. This, he says,
begat a friendship between him and them which bore fruit on the day of poll.
You will further find brought out in this play a conspiracy between two members
of the bar, one a sergeant-at-law, in a position of dignity, to betray a client for
a bribe; it is the sergeant-at-law who gets the bribe and betrays his client.
One of the good characters of the play says, ?that faction and public venality
are taught as measures necessary to the prosperity of the Briton and the pati iot;
while the ? Man of the World,? the successful man, significantly remarks that
all these fine principles might have done uncommonly well for the old Romans,
but were very ill-adapted for the modern Britons. (Laughter.) All this, you
see, is about the good .old times.*
If from the aristocracy we turn for a moment to the condition of th� mass of
* I am sure that it will not be supposed that I mean to convey any oblique excuse for
corruption in our own political sphere. Far from it. It seems to me that once cor-
ruption obtains sway in a democratic country, free institutions at all become of very
doubtful advantage, inasmuch as they only familiarise the people with the idea of
hypocrisy and dishonesty as conducing to success in life. Herein is the great distinction
between corruption in an aristocratic or despotic government, and corruption in a
democracy. In the former, a class only is tainted; in the latter, the whole people are de-
moralised. All see and know what is going on; and, what is more, can hope to participate
in it. Every time a public rogue succeeds, there is not a petty village schemer through-
out the country that does not secretly take heart, and look for his turn to come, when he
will be enabled to cheat constituencies as well as the best of them. And the people should
ever bear in mind that it is they, not the upper classes, who really suffer by dishonest
politicians. Those who can pay most, will be best served. I have asked to be allowed to
add this note, as I intended to have said something to the same effect, when touching on
the subject.


the people, it is very hard indeed to say anything about them, because they
were absolutely neglected and unknown. A competent authority Phillimore
?says that one in ten of the people of England was either a pauper or a felon.
They were utterly debased and brutalised. It was only now and then that
society got a glimpse of what they really were; when they broke out in riots,
such as the Gordon riots, and then they displayed all the ferocity and debase-
ment that could characterise a low grade of savages. It is almost impossible
to depict in detail the social position of the people at this period, because they
were so absolutely neglected that none cared or inquired about them. One
indication of their condition, however, was encouragement they gave to crime.
W'e have heard of bushranging in a neighbouring colony, and how the class of
small settlers was supposed to favour the bushrangers. Now, in the good old
times, highway robbers were an institution in England. Ihe highwaymen
were highly respected by a considerable portion of the people, were sheltered
by them, and served by them as heroes. You will find in the newspapers of
that day, that such a bold front were highway robbers enabled to show, not
merely in the country ?not in a distant bush?but in the middle of London,
that it was necessary for people going to the opera, or to an evening gathei iug
such as this, to have guards in order to see them safely home; and we read of
highwaymen in the middle of London and other fashionable places successfully
plying their trade. And this was not merely owing to the daring of the
highwaymen, but because so degraded was a large proportion of the people
that they regarded them as fine fellows enough till their time came and
they were actually hanged. Sydney Smith, you know, once said of a neigh-
bouring colony that no one was out of society there till he was hanged
(laughter;) and so in the good old times, these highwaymen were in good
repute enough among the people until they were taken from society altogether.
The only way in which crime was at all kept in check was by this same
Government that neglected the people and left them grovelling in ignoiance
and degradation, striking at it when it did come within their grasp with ruth-
less barbarity. You will find in the papers of that day painful details of the
punishments by which it was sought to protect society. For example, in one
year, at one place of execution?the Old Bailey?ninety-six persons were
executed. In one day, in the Old Bailey, fifty-eight persons were sentenced
to death, and nearly every morning, at the different places of execution in
London, numbers of those miserable wretches were strung up; in addition to
which wholesale butchery, all kinds of cruel and ferocious punishments, were
freely resorted to, in order to hold in check crimes that were the result of a
social state, that the institutions of the country left entirely without those
remedial measures which in modern times occupy so much, and so justly
public attention.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I will not dwell further on this point. This


part of my subject has been, I think, sufficiently put before you, and you see it
is important for us in this way to look back, because when we are told of
the difficulties which we have now to contend with, and the evils that now
mark our political and social state, it is important for us to see whether any
novelty has happened to us, and to consider whether we are much worse
or better than men were in other times. Look back to those olden times, and
you see that in every respect we are better. Why, just imagine the position
some of our critics, those who take such severe views of our state and prospects,
would have been in had they lived in that day. What would they have said
then ? ? Here,? they would say, ?is an aristocracy profligate and corrupt,
dominant in politics, and surrounding state affairs with an atmosphere of
corruption, while the mass of the people are neglected and brutalised. Why,
the case is hopeless! It is idle for us to try and stem the torrent. We-
have nothing to do but fold our arms, sit down and criticise evils that we are
not able to contend with.? That is the tone our critics would have adopted in
that day; but it was not by adopting such a tone that real progress was made.
It was by a few good-hearted and good-principled men, proposing to themselves
noble aims and just designs, uniting and struggling together with the ardour
that is inspired by love of country, and continuing to struggle, too, in the face
of difficulties, misrepresentation and reverses, struggling on, I say, bravely
and persistently, knowing that though they could not look for complete
success in that age, yet it was no small thing to maintain the good fight, and
to hold aloft the light of truth and knowledge, certain as it is, though
sometimes dimmed, to be caught up and reflected from age to age.
But now, Mr. Mayor, and ladies and gentlemen, it will be said that we
ought to compare ourselves, not with a century ago, but with the present day.
I think that is very true. I merely glance at these things to show you that
when we hear people refer, in an authoritative way, to the good old times as
something so admirable, they are talking of what they are not very well
acquainted with. I quite agree that we ought to look for progress, and see
how we stand in relation to other countries now. I suppose that it will not
be expected of me that I should entertain comparisons with any other lands
than the United States and the mother country. I think if we bear a fair
comparison to either one or the other we have no reason to despond. (Hear, hear.)
Now with regard to the United States, I want to say at once that I think a
casual glance will show that we are in a better and safer position. Not merely
have they got some terrible problems to struggle with?for example, the negro
question ?but, it seems to me, that they have started on rather a false prin-
ciple of democracy, and one which is bearing very bad fruits. I have no
doubt they will recover the effects of their error, but they will have some
trouble to go through before they settle down to a permanent and safe national
life. I think they have-adopted a false principle of democracy in laying down


?as was laid down by Jefferson and since adopted by some of the most impor-
tant political parties in that country ?in laying down the principle, that the
will of the people is not merely to he the rule of government,- -all must admit
that?hut that the will of the people is, in fact, the rule of right and wrong.
I think the laying down of such a principle has borne lamentable fruits in that
country. (Hear, hear.) That principle labours under this disadvantage it is
not true; it is false. Not only no individual, hut no number of people ha\e
the right to set up their will as the rule of right and wrong. Take the case of
an individual. Has any man a right to say that he intends to guide himself
by his mere will, and by it determine what is right and what is wrong? Not
for a moment. If it is not right for him, it is not right for a million men, or
twenty million men. (Hear.) Mind, I distinguish between accepting the will
of the people as the rule of government, and laying it down as indicating the
distinction between right and wrong. The two things are quite different.
The United States have, I think, then, fallen into that radical error, and it will
be found to entail?as it has already?some seriously bad consequences. No
doubt, however, they will work through, and I would prognosticate for that
country a great future; but I think they will have to pass through some severe
public sufferings and difficulties, all owing to that false doctrine, which seems
to have very much clouded in the popular mind the great truth that men, both
individually and collectively, ought always to remember that they are subject
to a Higher Power, and that no number of people have a right to disregard the
dictates of honesty and truth, or to scorn the voice of wisdom. (Applause.)
Well, now, if we come to the mother country, I am equally ready to main-
tain the argument here; but, before we consider the condition of England, I
have something which I wish to lay clearly before you. I think that, when
we are considering the condition and prospects of Victoria, we ought to direct
our attention, not so much to particular political difficulties or dangers, as to the
general question of how we stand with regard to that great principle on
which the safety of nations depends. Now, what is that principle? What
is the great problem on which the success or failure of national life in our age
depends? I maintain that it will be found to consist in combining the social
tendencies of the age with its political tendencies, so that, instead of any
antagonism being excited between them, they will act and react beneficially
on one another, and by their mutual action assist the progress of both. Now,
in so far as any nation does this, in so far as it combines the social tendencies
of the age with the political, in so far it will be a success as regards national
life. In so far as any nation fails to do this, dangers will be in its path. And
I must be allowed to say that I think how to do this well is by no means an
easy problem to solve. Ido not at all agree with some politicians who are of
opinion that they have nothing to do but let everything take its course, and
then everything will be right. Ido not agree with that view, and I will


tell you why. If we look at what we see going on about us we will notice
two great tendencies at work in the world, particularly among the Anglo-Saxon
race. One is the tendency of civilisation to heap up wealth, to the accumulation
of capital, to the making of millionaires, and to the spread of luxury: the other
is the tendency, which is visible everywhere, to democratic equality. ISow,
the first tendency, the tendency to the heaping up of wealth and the increase
of luxury, is visible enough in England, America, and here. The second
tendency towards democratic equality you may see throughout the world. It
is dominant in England; it is powerful, though for the present held in check, in
France; it is agitating the whole of the Continent; it is brooding uneasily over
the face of Russia. There are, therefore, these two great tendencies working
together, especially in Anglo-Saxon communities, and each is apt to run into
a dangerous excess. The tendency to accumulate wealth ?as will clearly
appear from the mother country ?is obviously apt to run into a perilous
extreme, viz., by accumulating and leaving accumulated enormous sums of
money in a few hands. The tendency to democratic equality is also apt to
run into another dangerous extreme, viz., the attempt to realise in practice
an ideal of absolute equality,?that, I am afraid, will be found in itself
impossible. However, these are the two great tendencies, and I hope you will
see clearly the view I wish to present to you. These are the two great ten-
dencies most powerful in this age, and among the Anglo-Saxon race. Now,
the grand problem for our time, and especially for a community such as ours,
is so to combine these two tendencies that they may act beneficially on each
other; that they may qualify rather than obstruct one another; that each may
mitigate what may be faulty in the other; and that so you may avoid provoking
between?them a dangerous conflict which, once it is provoked, must end either in
the throwing back of civilisation, as in Mexico, or the eclipse of democracy, as
in France.
Premising that view, let us come now to the mother country; and I
am sure I need not tell you, that I would not for a moment desire to say a
word in depreciation of that grand country from which we spring, with which
we are identified, and with which also we all trust to be long and long con-
nected. (Loud and continued applause.) That country, by the service it has
rendered to the cause of progress, has established claims to the gratitude of
mankind, which will never be forgotten so long as civilisation and enlighten-
ment exist among men. You will not for a moment imagine, that, in criticis-
ing the condition of our loved motherland, I have any other object or desire
than to consider seriously and reasonably whether it is true that our condition
is so bad in comparison. I want to consider whether it is true , that when you
take our social state, and compare it with that of the mother country, we have
any cause to despair, and whether these severe criticisms we frequently hear
launched against our country are justified by fact or not. Now, take the great


feature of English business life?the great system of factories, and the wealth
that springs from that system. If you look closely to the actual working of
that which produces such great results as regards the accumulation of capital,
I think you will see that it is eminently unsatisfactory and dangerous. You
have millions of people in the old country toiling away in the factories, engaged
in sustaining that industry that has spread its, results all over the world, that
has achieved such wonders and accumulated such wealth, and yet this people
themselves, these millions of toilers, are to a great extent in a state of semi-
barbarity, (hear, hear) all day long working away, the living appendages to
the great .machines that human ingenuity has invented. They have no idea of
home life or home virtues ?at least, the great majority of them have none, and
can have none. The places where they sleep are not entitled to be called
homes; ?places where men, women, and children congregate for short intervals
of sleep in their life?s toil at the mill, ? the men frequently resorting to stimu-
lants, or to debasing pleasures to give them some change from the ceaseless
monotony of labour, and the women and children of the family left unheeded
and degraded. You think that is strong language, perhaps; hut just
allow me to read an extract from an authority which you will not
suspect of over-statement ?a short extract as to the condition of those
millions of Englishmen who are working this great system of factories. I
read from the report of Mr. Baker, inspector of factories for 1865, an official,
you will see?a man who looked into the question merely as a matter of
business, and of course with no wish or desire to exaggerate what he might
see. He says:?? Most of the workshops of this great commercial country
have fallen into the inevitable track of competitive industry when unrestricted
by law, namely, to cheapen prices by the employment of women and children
?in the first instance, to increase production by protracted hours of work,
without regard to age, sex, or physical capability, or to the need of social
requirements. Thus we have thousands of the working-classes in a state of
semi-barbarity?parents who appear to have little or no natural affection,
fathers who are wholly sensual, mothers who are without domestic knowledge,
children utterly ignorant and without obedience, and masters who are not
perhaps regardless, but who have never duly considered the consequences of
congregations formed of such materials,? And another equally good authority,
the Quarterly Review ?the great conservative organ of England?for April,
1866, says that there are a million and a-half of children, young persons, and
women engaged in manufacturing employments, &c., ?subjected to an excess
of physical toil and an amount of premature exertion ruinous to their health,
fatal in many instances to their lives, and depriving them of every opportunity
of relaxation, and of the means of education and mental improvement.? Now, as
you may well imagine this dangerous state of affairs, millions of the working
classes in such a condition on the one hand, and men making rapid fortunes by


the toil of those millions on the other; all this is not going on without some
serious movements in the popular mind?in the minds of these people?as to
what the meaning of it is, and as to whether'this condition of things is
altogether a fair one. And you may guess the intensity of that feeling?you
may form some idea of the depth and force with which a sense of injustice has
penetrated the minds of the masses in England by the revelations of the
? Trade Unions? Commission,? of which we all heard a little time ago. You
had there proved on undoubted evidence that the intelligent working people of
England, steady English workmen, in large numbers, deliberately engaged in
schemes for assassinating and murdering men whom they supposed they had
grievances against. This ? Trade Unions? Commission? revealed that a system
was adopted by the working classes in England which was compared, and not
inaptly, to the Thuggism of India. But the real explanation?nobody would
say justification?of such things is to be found in the shocking inequality of
the social state in which these men find themselves. (Applause.)
Now, if you turn from the manufacturing population of England to the
agricultural population?if you turn to the smiling fields of England which
form such an- admirable topic for poets, and on which so much beautiful poetry
has been written, I venture to assert that there are few among us who really
know what the condition of the agricultural population in England is.
However, if you.refer to works of undoubted credit?in particular, I allude to
the treatise on ?Political Economy? by Professor Fawcett, a book of unques-
tionable authority, you will find the condition of the English labourer there
described to be that of penury and semi-starvation for the whole of his life, he
and his family struggling from morning to night for the sake of getting a
mere living, and that not a living such as the people of this country would call
a living (cheers,) but enough just to keep body and soul together. that
eminent master of political economy strikingly puts the condition of the
agricultural classes of England when he says, that if those classes were made
slaves to-morrow it would be for the interest of their masters to feed them
better than they are now fed. (Hear, hear.) This is not all. There is one feature
of the condition of the agricultural population of the mother country which
really passes belief, or certainly would pass belief, unless it were evidenced by
testimony which does not admit of doubt. Political economy, you know, has
declared against small farms; at least, the point has been much disputed among
political economists, but the weight of authority seems to be against small
farms in the mother country The result is, that the peasantry in the
agricultural counties of England have gradually, for some years back, been
subjected to the process of being driven off from their cottages and homes, and
turned into what are called open villages, where they live congregated
together in wretchedness, to be trooped out every morning to till those smiling
fields. Now, I say, you would scarely believe that state of affairs without


testimony that did not admit of doubt, and I will read you a short extract
from the same authority I gave you before, I mean the Quarterly Review., this
time for July, 1867. You will recollect that the Quarterly Review is not
merely the great conservative authority of England, hut is theorgan of the landed
gentry, and also a publication of undoubted weight and respectability. Isow,
let me read to you a description which this Quarterly Review, at so late a
period as July, 1867, gives of the condition of millions of the agricultural
population of England: ?
? The system (that system of turning people off the farms) to which we refer
is that peculiar organisation of rural industry known as the Agricultural Gang }
and which prevails extensively in Lincolnshire, Huntingdonshire, Cambridge-
shire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, and in a more limited degree in the
counties of Bedford, Rutland, and Northampton. * *
this reclaimed poi?tion of England, farm-houses, barns, and stables, sufficient
for all the requirements of a prosperous agriculture, were erected. The cattle
of the farm were housed in comfort, but no thought was taken of the labouiing
man. No cottages were built for his accommodation, and, as he could not
reside on the land where his services were required, he had to submit to the
hard necessity of rising an hour or two earlier than he otherwise would, and
of walking, perhaps, miles to his work. On those estates on which the tenant
was so fortunate as to secure some humble tenement to shelter him, he was
dispossessed of it as speedily as possible, lest he should one day become a pauper
and a burthen to the parish, and he was driven to find a home where and how
he could. One of the worst results of this mistaken policy on the part of
some great landed proprietors is the existence of these large ? open villages,
common to the midland counties and eastern parts of England. The aspect
of?these villages is generally repulsive in the extreme. The result is an
aggregation of wretched hovels; the houses are low, the rents high, and they
afford the most miserable accommodation. , These villages constitute what may
be termed the penal settlements of the surrounding neighbourhood, and to
them the scum of the country flows as by a natural affinity, and they afford a
natural asylum for every man who has lost his character, and for every woman
who has forfeited her virtue. The faculty of making little children work is
the peculiar art of the gang-master, and he obtains his living by pressing his
gang to the very utmost of their strength, his object being to extort the
greatest possible quantity of labour for the smallest possible remuneration.
He is thus, by the very condition of his occupation, a hard task-master; for he
must realise a profit on every woman, young person, and child, whom he
employs. The gang-master is frequently stigmatised as a slave-driver, and the
system has been denounced as little better than negro bondage. If the whip
is mot employed, other modes of compulsion are resorted to; and one of the
most painful facts elicited by the Commissioners? inquiries is, that children are


occasionally compelled to work in the gangs for two or three hours longer than
adults.? I should tell you that this is a comment upon an official document
presented to Parliament, so that we have not merely the high authority of the
Review, hut the fact that it is based on official reports to Parliament. ? Gang-
masters are generally men of indolent and drinking habits, and not unfre-
quently of notorious depravity. They are described as having almost the
entire control of the children in every district where the system prevails.
These men collect their gangs very early in the morning, and the scene when
500 or 600 women, boys, and, girls assemble at eaidy dawn, to be marshalled
by their respective gangs-men, and led off in different directions to their work,
is described as most revolting. There are to be seen youths who have never
known the restraints of parental discipline, or the humanising influences of a
respectable home; girls depraved by constant association with some of the
worst characters of their sex; married women who prefer the rude indepen-
dence of the fields to the restraints of domestic life; little children who should
be receiving their first lesson in the village school, instead of imbibing those of
premature and certain vice; and, above all, the gang-master, often hoary with
years, too, certainly profligate in character, ? corruptus simul et corrupter ,? and,
therefore, more disposed to encourage obscene language than to check it. As
it is important to the gang-master that the whole of his flock should arrive at
the scene of their labour quickly and simultaneously, the pace at which the
gang drives is trying to the strongest. When driving is found ineffectual, the
younger children are tempted to over-exert themselves by the promise of
sweetmeats. The ages at which young children commence work, and the
distances they have to walk, or rather to run, before they begin the labours of
the day, are astounding. Eight appears to be the ordinary age at which children
of both sexes join in the common gang, although seven is not unusual, and
instances are mentioned in which children only six years of age were found
regularly at work.? (Cries of ? Hear, hear!?)
Here, then, you have undoubted testimony of what the condition of a large
portion of the agricultural population of England is. I must just glance,
before I leave this topic, at another striking proof of what the condition of the
mass of the people is. It is a very short fact?a very small one; it is based
on a few figures very short and precise, but terribly telling. It is found by
careful inquiry, and statistics kept for a series of years, that the children of
the upper classes in Great Britain die at the rate of twenty per cent, under the
age of five. But you must, of course, recollect that children of the upper
classes often do not come of a very healthy stock, and are not as much in the
open air as they ought to be; therefore, they have difficulties of their own to
contend with. But the children of the working classes of Great Britain, taken
as a whole, under the age of five, die at the rate of fifty per cent., or more than
double the rate of the children'of the upper classes. I need not point out to


you the significance of that fact. It means that double the number of chil-
dren of the humbler classes die through sheer want, misery, and neglect. It
is found that in ten years, according to calculation, 1,150,000 children die,
which, if they had been taken proper care of, if their parents had had the
proper means to look after them, would have lived. This most pregnant fact
I take from Professor Fawcett. It is, indeed, a most startling fact, hut still,
more startling is it to find that political economists say, that after all it is not
of so very much consequence, and not really to be very much deplored, because
if they lived there would he nothing for them to do. (Applause, mingled with
laughter.) Is not the fact significant? If you could get a detailed account of
all the misery and wretchedness, vice and recklessness, fathers driven to despair,
mothers broken-hearted, children languishing in neglect?if you could get all
drawn out before you that that short fact indicates, I think you would he apt
to he more contented with this country of Australia. (Cheers.) I have quoted
from a political economist just now, and I will trouble you with one more short
extract from another authority on the same subject. I am going to quote to
you an observation of Dr. Arnold, late head master of Rugby school, a divine
of eminence, a scholar of great accomplishments, a man not accustomed to take
violent or extreme views, hut who looked fairly at things as they were presented
to his notice. He says? Men do not think of the fearful state in which we
are living; if they could be once brought to notice and to appreciate the evil,
I should not even yet despair that the remedy may he found and applied, even
though it is the solution of the most difficult problem ever yet proposed to
man?s wisdom, and the greatest triumph over selfishness ever yet required of
his virtue It seems to me that people are not enough aware of
the monstrous state of society, absolutely without a parallel in the history of
the world, with a population poor, miserable, and degraded in body and mind,
as much as if they were slaves, and yet called free men. And the hopes enter -
tained by many of the effects to he wrought by new churches and schools, while
the social evils of their condition are left uncorrected, appear to he utterly wild ?
And there is one further consideration about the condition of this miserable
population who are toiling away in the manner I have indicated, and it is this,
that these people, through all their life?s struggle, have no hope. Now, a man
in this and any other country may and will, I have no doubt, have difficulties
to contend with; he will here as well as elsewhere require the exercise of
energy and industry to succeed in life?hut at least he has hope. In all his
struggles, toils, and labours he can look forward to something. When he
thinks of his wife and family, he feels that by working for them he can secure
something for them?some end. But the great majority of the working classes
in the agricultural districts of England have no hope whatever but the work-
house. They barely keep themselves alive by their toil so long as they are able to
work, and they have no refuge?nothing to keep life in them whan they


become past work and are decrepit with old age?no refuge but the workhouse.
And this is such a recognised institution in the old country that it is quite a
matter of careful business inquiry to determine to what particular parish a
pauper belongs, so that paupers found in one parish to which they do not
belong are at once shifted over to that on which they can be saddled. They
are regarded as encumbrances to be disposed of. Somebody must keep them
?they cannot help that?but it is a strict business matter to say where they
can be put away best, and the greatest efforts are made by each parish to get
rid of as many as possible. Now, do you know what kind of homes these
union workhouses are, to which such numbers of persons go in their old age ?
Have you any idea of what they are? Just let me read a short account of the
subject, but before I do so let me give you a few figures, for it is important to
bring the circumstances clearly to mind. The average of paupers annually
maintained in this way in workhouses in England, for the ten years ending in
1860, was 1,109,275. That is the yearly average, and the sum paid for keeping
them alive was from �6,000,000 to �7,000,000 a year. The total spent in those
ten years, in keeping this host of paupers from starvation, was �92,285,965.
Here let me read you a short extract, to show what kind of home these people
have, and from an authority as good as any I have hitherto given. And in
selecting authorities to bring before you, I have been anxious to get such as
could not be suspected of any bias, or of presenting any unreasonable or
enthusiastic views one way or another. I read to you now from The Times,
the leading journal of England, and not given to depreciating that country;?
? There is hardly in all the earth a sadder sight than the multitudes of from
300 to 1000 shut up in workhouses. Broken hearts and fortunes, high spirits
still untamed, minds in ruin and decay, good natures corrupted into evil, cheer-
ful souls turned to bitterness, youth just beginning to struggle with the world,
and vast masses of childhood are there subjected, not to the educated, the
gentle and the good, but to the rude, the rough, the coarse, the ignorant and
narrow-minded. The qualifications for the governor of a workhouse are those
we expect in a gaoler or a policeman, or the keeper of wild beasts.? And, Mr.
Mayor, and ladies and gentlemen, just think for one moment of there being in
that condition, subject to that bondage?with such places for their home for
life?a number of the people of England equal to the number of the whole
populations of Victoria and South Australia put together. It is a terrible fact
that you have, in the condition thus described by the leading journal of
England, a number of people equal to the whole populations of those two
great and flourishing communities. (Applause.)
And now, ladies and gentlemen, to hurry on. Perhaps, you will say to me,
?But has not wealth greatly increased of late in England ? Do we not hear
of the wonderful expansion of trade; the vast growth of industry?? That is
all, undoubtedly, true; there is not a doubt about it. But that is one of the


most serious facts in the whole matter. The increase of wealth all the time
has been, on its side, almost incredible. For example, in the year 1849, the
exports of England amounted in value to �60,000,000; in 1861, just twelve
years after, those very exports reached to �120,000,000, so that, in these twelve
years, the commerce of the country had doubled; and, indeed, in the United
Kingdom on every side you see evidence of the accumulation of capital and
heaping up of wealth, in a manner and to a degree unprecedented in previous
ages. In the last century, when Pitt proposed his legacy duty, he only pro-
vided for fortunes up to �1,000,000. No provision was made for fortunes
beyond a million, because it was impossible that there would he any beyond
that sum: but now, every year you read of men in the old country leaving
fortunes of a million, and beyond a million. In the great cities of England,
you see on all sides evidence of the accumulation of boundless wealth, and the
growing up of luxurious classes who weary themselves only in the effort to
spend their riches. The country is brimful of capital-running over. They
scatter it ahroad-to build railways in Russia, for public works in Canada, or
to tunnel the Alps. They would send any quantity of it to us here tf we
would only give them their own terms, and take it as they like to give it.
(Laughter.) They do not know what to do with their wealth, and so it goes
on year after year heaping up; hut the serious point is, that pauperism,misery
and degradation go on increasing unceasingly as well. Refer to the best
authorities and you will find that pauperism in England is greatly on the
increase latterly. Indeed, the conflict between the two social influences
thus at work, is strikingly illustrated by the telegrams that from time to time
convey to us the mail news; the same mail that tells us that money is so
plentiful that the owners do not know what to do with it, also tells us that
the people are rioting for bread. Lately, we read of money being cheap beyond
precedent,?hut, at the same time, we also read of people being found in the
garrets of London starved to death. Why, at this very time when we here
are living in comparative independence, comparative wealth, and with plenty
of good employment, it has been calculated that there will he, in one district
of London alone, some 180,000 heads of families, not only without work and
without means of living, hut utterly without hope of getting either one or the
other to keep their families from starvation. And this in the midst of all the
wealth!
I have often thought that from one scene in London you may get an apt
picture of the social state of England. In the great cities at home you always
may find a number of persons who are outside the pale, as it were, of all the
agencies of relief, ?the very outcasts of civilised life, they are not reached by
the hand of mercy at all. In London there is a large number of such persons;
they keep prowling about all day to live as best they can, and they slink away
at night to sleep wherever they can. Go any night into St. James?s Park an


you will find some two or three hundred of these miserables trying to find a
refuge till morning. There they are, the disowned of the social state; broken-
down old men, boys and girls, young in years but long familiar with wretched-
ness, ?miserable women?nestling under the shrubs or crouching beneath the
seats or behind the trees?somewhere to rest and wait for morning. And all
around them rise the noble palaces of the proudest and wealthiest aristocracy
of the world, lit up with splendour and dazzling with all the brilliancy that
the resources of a luxurious age can impart. In that little scene you have an
apt illustration of the condition of English society?the mountains of wealth
and depths of poverty by which it is distinguished. And it is these extremes
that constitute the difficulty of England; the difficulty of England in working
out that problem which I have stated, namely, how to combine the social with
the political tendencies of the age. For when you come to add, as the mother
country has added and must have added, democracy to such a state of society,
you surely propound a tremendous problem for any people to solve. If there is
truth in the view I have endeavoured to present of what will constitute the
success or failure of national life in our age, which country, I ask you,?
England or Australia?has the best chance of working through ? Not that I
would at all wish to indicate any despair of the condition of the mother
country; but yet, seriously, when we find people pointing to our difficulties,
exaggerating our dangers, telling us that they despair of our country, and
that they long to take their children away to the old country, I think
they show that they are not aware of the real difficulties that old country
has to contend with, or the real immunities which we enjoy. (Cheers.) For
you must recollect, that there is this wide distinction between our condition
and that of England, viz., ?that let them there do their best, as no doubt they
will, act as energetically as they please, let all classes unite to face their social
difficulties in the best way, yet the fact remains?there are those crush-
ing difficulties formed and matured among them ?difficulties that with all
their efforts they may possibly not be able to adequately solve?while at the
same time we are free from those difficulties. No doubt they will gradually pre-
sent themselves here; but it is one thing to have precipitated against one another
two hostile tendencies, each fully developed, and it is another thing to deal with
them as they are both growing up together. It will, I imagine, be not impos-
sible, by a wise foresight, to indirectly mitigate the tendency to that alarming
extreme of social fortune that is so dangerously manifest in England. We
have the matter to some extent at least in our own hands. We have our des-
tiny a good deal under our own control, and if we do go wrong and do fail, it
will not be because of difficulties that we cannot overcome, but because we
ourselves are wanting, and do not bear ourselves in a manner becoming the
citizens of a free country. (Cheers.) It will, I say, be entirely our own fault,
and owing to a want of patriotic feeling on the part of our own people. Surely


there is a great difference in being in a country so situated, surrounded by the
elements of success, where all we -want is to evoke a sound tone of public feel-
ing (cheers,) and having our lot cast where, be as patriotic as we please, we
would still be paralysed by social difficulties such as I have adverted to.
Now, you see, Mr. Mayor, and ladies and gentlemen, the view which I endeavour
to present to you. If I had time, I ought now, by right, in order to complete
my subject with exactness, to go into the condition of Victoria. (Loud cries
of ?Go on.?) Well, ladies and gentlemen, I have now been engaging your
attention for nearly an hour and a-half. (A voice: ?Never mind that take
another hour and a-half,? and cheers.) lam sure lam very much flattered at the
attention you have shown; but, perhaps, Mr, Mayor, and ladies and gentlemen,
I had better not go into details on this part of the subject, for two reasons.
One is, that for the purposes of my argument ?which you see is as to the
relative prospect of our national success as compared with England?you know
of yourselves enough of our condition. You see our elements of prosperity.
You know that any man with energy, industry, and honest conduct, in any
position, can, relying on himself, achieve not only competence but wealth.
Not one of us is doomed to live outside the pale of citizenship and society. We
all know enough to support my argument. And further, if you will look at
our programme, you will see that the reverend gentleman who is to follow me
on this day fortnight will deal with the question of ? The Land we Live in,?
and you will probably hear from him in detail, and with greater ability than
I possess, a discussion of the aspect of the question that you desire. But
though I do not enlarge on our condition, you must not at all imagine that I
believe we are without dangers and difficulties. I believe nothing of the kind.
We have considerable difficulties facing us, and dangers which demand pru-
dence and care to avoid. I think that to indulge in % blind spirit of self-
congratulation would be as dangerous for the community as it would be to
give way to that craven tone of distrust that, by a considerable number, is
made a mere excuse for want of patriotism and public spirit. Ido not wish
you at all to believe that I mean to say that we have no difficulties, in fact
nothing to do, but to do as we like. On the contrary, I think it behoves us,
if we are at all concerned for Australia and the prospects of those who come
after us, to look closely to our weak points and endeavour to face them.
And what is the greatest difficulty we have to meet ? I fully believe
it is that which I have glanced at more than once. It is not that the evil
elements among us are of themselves so dangerous. There are such in every
age and among every people. But the real difficulty is, that we have not got
yet, I am afraid, a class of men who are interested in the state, who have a
patriotic regard for it?who really feel for Australia what men in other lands
feel for their country. If that were not so, we never could have these heart-
less criticisms and satires on our condition that a portion of the public seem


absolutely to enjoy. But these men look upon Australia as merely a resting-
place. They regard some other land as their country, and while they claim
here the rights, they scorn to undertake the duties of citizenship. That is a
real difficulty?a real danger in our condition. And to whom, now, do I chiefly
look for the remedy ? I must say?though yet a young man myself?that I
mainly look to the young men of the country ?those who, if not born here,
have been bred here, or at least are fixed here with their families, and who do
not look beyond Australia for a home. I look forward to this class as forming
a real body of Australian citizens, who will safely guide this land through
dangers that may beset us. I believe lam now addressing some such, and let
me say that it is but rarely in the world?s history that men have an opportu-
nity of taking a part in shaping their country?s destiny. Generally, men find
their nation with history made and fate fixed. In older lands, when they would
excite the patriotic feeling of the people, they remind them of their ancestors.
But we are the ancestors here. (Cheers.) We are the ancestors of this
country, and when I say this, I speak of the whole people of this Australian
continent. With us it lies to make or to mar the future of Australia. Never
was there an opportunity so grand, nor a responsibility so serious. A great
Grecian orator and statesman has said, in a moment of enthusiasm, that the
whole world was the monument of great men. The idea is grand, though per-
haps a little exaggerated. We may give it a limited application here, and say
that if we of this generation would only excite some patriotic feeling, and
strive to leave to those who will come after us good institutions, just prin-
ciples, and a sound social state, we may look forward to the whole future of
Australia forming a noble and abiding monument to the labours of us, its real
citizens. (Loud applause, during which the lecturer resumed his seat.)
On the motion of Judge Bindon, seconded by the Rev. A. F. Orn stein, a
vote of thanks to the Lecturer was agreed to by acclammation.
It was duly acknowledged, and, after a vote of thanks to the Right Wor-
shipful the Mayor for presiding had been similarly carried and acknowledged,
the audience dispersed.

LOYALTY, ROYALTY:
AND THE
PRINCE?S VISITS.
The sixth lecture in aid of the Early Closing
Association was delivered on Monday, July 12,
at the Academy of Music (Princess?s Theatre).
The lecturer was the Hon. A. Michie, Q.C.,
who took for his subject ?Loyalty, Royalty,
and the Prince?s Visits,? and whose great
popularity as a lecturer attracted an audience
not only sufficiently numerous to crowd
the theatre and its avenues, but also
comprising a large number of gentlemen
distinguished in politics and the learned pro_
fessions. Among them were the Hon. J.
M'Culloch (Chief Secretary), the Hon. Geo.
Higinbotham, the Hon. C. Gavan Duffy, his
Honour Judge Bindon, the Rev. Dr. Bromby,
Professor M?Coy, the mayor of Melbourne
(Mr. T. Moubray), .Mr. F. Wilkinson (master
in equity), and several members of the
Legislative Assembly. The chair was occupied
by the Hon. C. J. Jenner, M.L.C,
The Chairman having briefly introduced
the hon and learned lecturer,
Mr. Michie (who was heartily cheered
on his first appearance, and who came for-
ward amidst deafening applause) said: ?
Mr. Chairman and Ladies and Gentlemen, ?
If we ask of Dr, Johnson the question
? What is loyalty ?? we find his answer to be
rather bald, and meagre, and by no means
dispensing with the necessity for further
inquiry. He tells us that it is ?firm and
faithful adherence to a prince.? He cites
various instances of the application of the
terra by some of our leading writers. Besides
Shakspeare and Clarendon, he quotes Milton
and Butler, in two well-known passages?
? Abdiel, faithful found?
Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified?
His loyalty he kept.?
Butler is in another strain?
? For loyalty is still the same,
Whether it win or lose the game;
True as the dial to the sun,
Although it be not shone upon.?
You remember that Butler, in his Hudibras,
is the champion of the Royalists as opposed
to the Parliamentarians, in the great civil
?war generated of Charles the First?s efforts to
make himself an absolute and irresponsible
monarch. In the lines I have just quoted,
loyalty is represented as playing a game
against some other power which I must sup-
pose Butler would have us to understand to
be disloyalty, as represented in the persons of
the Parliamentarians. His metaphor, howso-
ever ingenious it may be thought, is neverthe-
less equivocal. If he meant to tell us that sin-
cere and genuine loyalty?as J understand the
sentiment, and as I shall hereafter attempt
to explain it?is, or ought to be, true and
faithful in its expression, irrespective of any
hope of favour or advantage to ourselves, I
am quite ready to subscribe to the position
he here lays down. But if, instead of the
meaning I have suggested, he would have
loyalty to be a mere blind, unquestion-
ing sentiment, I at once demur; for
what would this be but a man surrender-
ing his reason, his dignity, his independence,
nay, even his very existence as a human
creature, at the feet of another human crea-
ture like himself; and all, probably, for
naught ? The best specimen, perhaps, of such
a virtue as this is that afforded us by the
Highlandman?s extremely loyal wife, who
coaxingly requested her husband to come out
and be hanged to please the laird?an
affectionate request which Donald, not see-
ing it exactly as she did under the particular
circumstances, rather lingered about comply-
ing with. This Highland wife?s school of
loyalty, then, I reject, as absurd in itself,
and out of harmony with the nineteenth
century. (Cheers.) And yet, I think, as
we proceed we shall see that even a
devotion like this points to a kind of
sentiment which has not only existed and
flourished, but which will naturally grow out
of any patriarchal system of government
in any country. We need hardly, indeed, go
farther than to the admirable pictures of
society in the pages of Walter Scott to learn
the character of that devotion of clansmen to
their chief which, as a last surviving relic of
the feudal state of society, was common in
the Highlands of Scotland until a compara-
tively recent date. Before commerce had
dethroned force, different portions of society
were either at war with each other, or
they only preserved peace by constant
readiness for war. In such times pecu-
liar strength, prowess, or talent, would


necessarily make many individuals natural rate, be manifested in great measure indepen-
kings chiefs, leaders of men. The mutual dently of any moral or intellectual qualities m
attachment, springing out of the mutual in- the object thus regarded. It is this considera-
terests of protector and protected, must have tion which makes the whole subject as per-
been the first foundation of the sentiment of plexing as it is interesting to many minds.
loyalty. But when all the conditions of
society are changed, when justices of the peace
and constables come to be invented, such a
loyalty becomes rather a tradition and habit of
thought than a strong, living, active principle.
Modern civilisation and such loyalty as this
could hardly get on well together. But
civilisation which rested on industry would
grow impatient with the loyalty which fed on
rapine, and would put it down with any in-
strument that came to hand, as Baillie Nicol
Jarvie met the claymores of Rob Roy?s
caterans ?with the novel, but effective, and,
may we not add, the highly civilised weapon
of the red hot poker. (Laughter.) I believe
then that this blind and unquestioning
loyalty, which was based either on personal
attachment or on superstitious veneration for
absolute raonarchs, passed away with the
society which produced it, and which could
alone give it nourishment and strength.
If, however, this devoted and patriarchal
species of loyalty exists only in history, or in
states of society similar to that which once
obtained in the Highlands of Scotland, it is,
nevertheless, observable that a loyalty of
some sort still exists, for is it not constantly
referred to in public addresses and in after-
dinner speeches ? I would, then, respectfully
ask you to accompany me whilst I
endeavour to ascertain what is the ap-
parent nature of much of this loyalty
in our day, and what its apparent depth
or strength. In our own recent case, the
immediate object of the sentiment was a
young man between three and four and
twenty years old, the descendant, and to us,
in some, sort the living representative of
a line of princes, some of them illus-
trious, and some of them rather the
opposite, in any respectable sense. (Loud
cheers.) Of the talents or the endow-
ments of this young Prince, even were
it becoming to discuss them, we are not in a
position to speak with any degree of confi-
dence. If, however, we have no actual
knowledge that his intellectual qualities are
greatly above, neither have we any reason for
concluding that they are below the average of
those of other well-educated young men of
the same age. Thus much, however, alone
seems tolerably certain ?that on the Duke of
Edinburgh?s first arrival here, we knew little
more of him than that he was the second son
of our Queen and the captain of the Galatea.
And yet, to welcome and enthusiastically
greet this young man, there assembled here
in Melbourne, on that first day of his landing,
something not far short, perhaps, of 50,000
souls. At the same time, throughout the
length and breadth of the land the population
were equally on the alert to hail his coming,
when it should become his pleasure to appear
among them. Now, I think, we thus see at
the outset that loyalty may be felt, or the
demeanour that passes for loyalty may, at any
plexing as it is interesting to many minds.
How comes it that a simple, gentlemanly,
unaffected young man, possessing the one
mysterious advantage of Royal birth, should
drive a reflecting, sober people frantic with
the desire to gaze on him ? (Laughter.)
What did we gaze at, and why did we
gaze? (Renewed laughter.) I ask this
question because I think we must all be
distinctly conscious that we cannot ex-
plain the interest we take in a prince
exactly as easily as we are able to account for
the interest we feel in some eminent man,
who has distinguished himself in any way in
his generation. For this latter person, inde-
pendent of and apart from any factitious con-
siderations, we are conscious of entertaining
a respect as rooted as it is involuntary and
sincere. For instance, a Nelson gains a naval
victory, or a Wellington a land action, which
may change the balance of power in Europe ;
a Garibaldi, by the fascination of his indi-
vidual enthusiasm and bravery, infuses a new
national life into his countrymen; a first
Napoleon annihilates thrones, and becomes
a maker of kings?in all these cases
we have exhibitions of power. These ex-
hibitions deeply affect the interests of
millions of people. The names of the
principal actors are in everybody?s mouth,
and are mixed up in all political discussions.
The minds of the millions become heated as
they discuss the qualities or probable purposes
of these conspicuous persons, and nothing is
more natural than the desire to see those by
whom such remarkable actions have been
done, and of whom so much has been said
and heard. So with other forms of power.
A Gladstone or a Bright sways opinion in the
greatest deliberative Assembly in the world.
Their words may affect human interests
throughout the globe, A Tennyson wells
over with poetry which sounds the
depths of all human hearts; a Dickens
is the master of our laughter and
our tears, as he passes before us a portrait
gallery now as familiar to us as that of Shak-
speare. In all these cases we delight to look
on, and strive to know still more, and as far
as our eyes and ears will help us?and no
other knowledge ever seems equal to that we
get through our eyes and ears?the remark-
able persons who do these exceptional and
extraordinary things. All this is very intel-
ligible. But many people demand (some of our
English critics among them) ??Is it equally
intelligible that we should throng and crowd
together, and almost choke each other with
dust (laughter), and raise triumphal arches,
and make gold trowels, and pawn our pianos,
and go into general convulsions (prolonged
laughter and cheers), on account of one whose
pre-eminence consists of the accident of rank
alone ?? One is reminded, whilst urging such
an inquiry, of the Barber?s soliloquy on the
nobleman, in Beaumarchais?s Marriage of
Figaro, ? What has your lordship done to


earn all this?? ?Vous, vous etes donnela equal extravagance?if that must be the
peine de naitre.? (?You took the trouble word?of loyal demonstration in the mother
to be born.?) (Continued laughter.) Are
we provided with much more satisfac-
tory explanations than that of the Barber ?
Now, these, and similar questions, have been
put by our English critics about ourselves, as
if the conduct upon which they were com-
menting was something peculiar to colonists,
and unknown in the mother-country. One
able and caustic writer in the London Spec-
tator went the length of saying, some twelve
months back, that we plainly had ? Prince
upon the brain.? (Cheers and laughter.) I
therefore propose to show you, before I pro-
ceed to inquire further into the nature of
this moral phenomenon, that what some
English journalists have called ? the extra-
vagance of our enthusiasm? in connexion
with the Duke of Edinburgh?s first visit to
these shores, by no means exceeds English
extravagance on like occasions. W T ho can
forget the popular enthusiasm in England on
the occasion of the marriage of the Prince of
Wales ? And if English journalists are at a
loss for British parallels to some of the more
emphatic of our loyal demonstrations, such
parallels may easily be found scattered up and
down in English memoirs and diaries. What
can well be more ludicrous than the account
Miss Burney?afterwards Madame D?Arblay,
one of the ladies in waiting on Queen Char-
lotte?gives of the manner of George the
Third?s bathing at Weymouth. Whenever he
went out to take his morning dip in the sea
the people used to lie in wait for him, and a
second bathing-machine, with a band in it
(laughter), always pursued him into the water,
the band vigorously playing, ? God Save the
King,? until His Majesty had finished his
Royal headers, and returned to land. (Roars
of laughter.) Again, no obsequiousness of ours
seems to exceed that described by Miss Burney
as occurring on another occasion during this
Weymouth visit. A deputation, consisting of
the mayor and town council, waited on Queen
Charlotte to present an address, congratu-
lating her on the recent restoration of His
Majesty?s health. The mayor, as he ap-
proached the Queen to present the address,
was whispered by gold-stick, or silver-stick,
or some other stick in waiting (laughter)?
the name of whose office I forget?? that the
presenters of the address must kneel on
one knee whilst passing Her Majesty.?
To the horror and consternation of the
whole Court party, ?the right worshipful?
merely stiffly bowed, and passed on. The
official stick pursued the offender, tapped him
on the shoulder, and angrily whispered,
??You should have knelt, sir,? ?I can?t,?
cries the mayor, in an agony, ?I?ve got a
wooden leg.? (Prolonged laughter and cheers.)
To complete the catastrophe?it must have
appeared to the people of the court as if the
end of the world was at hand?the whole of
the councillors, taking the mayor as their
standard, filed along in the same fashion;
but whether from ignorance of court eti-
quette, or delicate respect for their chief, Miss
Burney does not say. Here, then, have we
country as in her colony. Our own acts and
the home instances may very well keep each
other in countenance. They are curious facts
in the natural history of the human animal,
and are well worthy of further examina-
tion. To say that such manifestations
are peculiar to those who live under
kingly government, will not account for them.
In the United States a few years back, as
dense, and even denser, crowds congregated in
streets and assembly-rooms to look at the
Prince of Wales. The feeling which brought
these American crowds together could not be
loyalty. What, then, was it? Was it merely
that universal, yet vague feeling of curiosity
which is excited by anything of which we have
heard much, and know little, and would learn
more ? Is it that we unconsciously estimate
every one, from a king down to a policeman,
according to the stamp of authority which
society and law have put upon them ? Has
this public sanction in some vague way led us
to conceive of a prince, that with all the ad-
vantages of education and training any mortal
can command, he will naturally have some-
thing in his own person to show for all this,
and that there must surely be some congruity
and proportion between the individual him-
self and his most exalted station ? Or is it
that we throng together in thousands to look
at a prince, in obedience to that infinite sus-
ceptibility to excitement within us which
draws us out in thousands to welcome the
arrival of a new governor, to meet an ?All
England Eleven,? to witness an execution or
a review, or even to gaze at the outside of a
house said to be haunted? (Laughter.) So
omnivorous is the human imagination, that
there is scarcely anything lying outside its
daily experience upon which it cannot be
whipped up into temporary excitement; an
excitement, too, frequently as superficial and
fleeting as it is noisy and demonstrative. I
well remember revolving this subject in my
own mind on the occasion on which the
Governor and the Royal Commission were at
the Heads awaiting the first arrival of the
Galatea. The commissioners were curiously
stowed away for the night, throughout the
numerous bedrooms of Mr. Adman?s Queens-
cliff Hotel, men of all shades of politics,
Loyal Liberals and Constitutionalists to-
gether, within easy hail of each other. For
once?
? Opposing factions nearly were allied.
And thin partitions did their bounds divide.?
Ostensibly we were all here to await the
coming of the Royal visitor, in order to escort
him to Melbourne. What depth or earnest-
ness of sentiment, thought I, is there at the
bottom of this proceeding? In how many
and in which of the commissioners? minds
may the feeling most operate ? Whose loyalty
will keep him awake to-night? Here, like
Don Quixote watching his armour, are we
supposed to be watching the arrival of the
Prince. How many people under this roof
are seriously thinking about this business, or


speculating as to what it may indicate or animating and interesting the eye could rest
portend? Now that the Australian are as- on. The day, opening sullenly in clouds,

suming almost the proportions of independent
states, a Royal personage condescends to
come, or is judiciously shipped, to look at us.
We are regarded at home as a somewhat
democratic community ; is Royalty commis-
sioned to fascinate us by its superior morals
and manners ? Now that the supply of
princes in Europe is so rapidly exceeding the
demand?(great laughter)?may it not be that
home Governments are on the look-out for
?pleasant fields and pastures new? for
Royal supernumeraries? (Renewed laughter.)
In the midst of my reflections, which
kept me awake some time for, like
Brindley, I can think most comfort-
ably in bed?a familiar voice struck on
my ear. It was that of a high legislative
functionary, the rotundity and comeliness of
whose figure proved that devotion to our
Constitution by no means necessitated any
foolish and uncalled for neglect of his own.
As the energy and impatience of this high
legislative voice showed me that, for the
nonce, its owner was in some way, and for
some moving reason or other, at present
among the non-contents, curiosity drew my
head out of the bed-clothes to listen.
(Laughter.) What ailed him at this dead hour
of the night? He soon made his case clear.
?Waiter! waiter! where is my night shirt?
(Great laughter.) What has become of my
night-shirt?? exclaimed he. ?I can?t sleep
without my night-shirt. ? (Continued laughter.)
Now, I am free to admit?as they say in
Parliament that I strongly sympathised
with the caller, for I labour under the
same sort of infirmity myself. ?Has he,?
thought I, ?forgotten to bring a night-shirt
with him, or has some fellow commissioner
furtively appropriated that indispensable gar-
ment.? (Fresh laughter.) In the intensity
of my sympathy I was on the point of get-
ting up and offering him my own, but pru-
dently reflecting that it would be a tight and
uncomfortable fit for him- (much laughter)
?I kept it myself, and sank to sleep vaguely
wondering about this mission we were all
upon. Here was one of the most loyal of us,
an important legislative functionary to boot,
and yet his loyalty had never in my hearing
imparted such moving tones to his voice as
those which the loss of his bedgown extracted
from him that night. (Laughter). Do I con-
demn or complain of this (at first sight) small
querulousness on a great occasion? By no
means. Which of us can say with perfect
sincerity that our common creature wants
have never kept fine sentiments waiting until
a more convenient time ? On the fol-
lowing day occurred other events, which
showed us how we are apt to con-
sider ourselves first and loyalty afterwards.
With fear and trembling I noted this as we
came up the bay. You remember that bay
programme, and the now historical escorting
flotilla of steamers. Perhaps some of you
were on board a portion of that flotilla. If so,
you will not easily forget the scene ; for, on
the whole, it was certainly one of the most
had cleared itself up ; and our blue sky, and
the almost equally blue waters of our bay,
seemed to join in the general joy. The hour
had come, and the man ; and as within a few
minutes to one o?clock the noble
rolled and plunged through the rip, reve-
rently and loyally mustered our flotilla to
take the Royal visitor into affectionate
custody. Salutes blazed away from the!
Queenscliff battery, from the Victoria, and the!
Pharos ; and the Galatea herself thundered
a salute as Her Majesty?s representative
approached her tall side. But here, unfor-
tunately for Captain Norman?s beautifully
arranged programme, the Galatea seemed to
become altogether unconscious of our ex-
istence. Instead of waiting to be escorted ?
according to our pre-arranged plans?the
frigate took to her Royal heels, and went
straight ahead for Melbourne, leaving us all
in the lurch. Thus this long-meditated and
elaborately prepared escort was not only
knocked into ? a cocked hat" at the very
outset (as one figurative gentleman called it),
but at the shortest notice it was converted
into a hopeless chase?a chase, too, as ludi-
crous as that of the wooden legged man
pursuing the hare, where the longer he ran
the further he fell behind. (Laughter.) Never
did I behold longer faces than on that occa-
sion. I trembled for the cause of colonial
loyalty. I had been for many days pasta mem-
ber of a commission of thirteen, consisting of
judges, of Ministers (past and present), of the
President of the Legislative Council, of the
Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, of the
mayor, and ex-mayor of Melbourne. Most
of us had given many meetings for the exclu-
sive purpose of making the best arrangements
we could devise for receiving and entertain-
ing with becoming respect our illustrious
visitor. A very prominent portion of these
arrangements consisted of this flotilla, most
liberally contributed by the owners of the
different steamers. Commodore Norman
having previously unfolded to us on paper
his impressive plans for the port and star-
board lines of vessels, the time had now arrived
to see how it all looked on blue water, and
now the blue water knew it not. Each and
every steamer seemed to come driving on,
smoking away on her own particular and
private account ?the little Pharos nearly last,
and apparently in the highest state of asthma,
but struggling along with a ? never say die?
look about her intermittent paroxysms of
smoke which was absolutely touching.
(Laughter.) Nobody said much, so I suppose
eveiybody thought the more. One dejected
and almost spirit-crushed commissioner did,
with suppressed emotion, _ say to me that
?Such behaviour was not nice in the Prince at
all.? (Laughter.) I could think of no more
original rejoinder than ?
? I?d excuse you, my dear, for disguising your love;
But why do you kick us down stairs ??
Royalty, decidedly, was not now shining on
us, and we were, as it seemed to me, doing,


or endeavouring to do, Butler?s sun-dial Is there any more incongruity in Colac than
under difficulties. lam disposed to think in Melbourne, or in Melbourne than in
that many even moderate and unexacting
people thought on this occasion that the
Galatea authorities might, and even ought
to have reflected that both the Government
and the owners of these steamers had put
themselves to much trouble and expense in
the spirited exhibition of these reception
courtesies, and that a loyalty to be warranted
proof against any amount of contempt and
indifference from its object would, possibly,
in our age and generation, require a larger
amount of nursing and weather-fending than
it was likely to receive. Other and subse-
quent incidents connected with the Royal
visit were calculated to excite similar re-
flections. On the Western tour the Prince and
his suite and attendants rushed through Colac
towards that day?s haven of refuge, Mr.
Robertson?s house. Divers Colacians were
known to be cruising in the neighbourhood
with ? a loyal address.? The Prince, how-
ever, ran the blockade ?the only blockade, I
believe, he contrived to run throughout his
country trips. (Laughter.) Did he exult?
If so, I cannot but think he did not know
all. Colac loyalty apparently never before re-
ceived so rude a shock. A day or two after,
the Colac Observer came out in the following
startling terms?(laughter) :?? The well-
known loyalty of this journal?(renewed
laughter)?forbids its attempting to give pub-
licity to the bitterness of feeling openly
expressed, and replied to only by an ominous
silence on the part of the more guarded, who
felt that an opportunity had been lost of
cementing more closely the union which
exists between this loyal colony and the glo-
rious empire from which the majority of its
inhabitants are privileged to hail.? Now here
we see what great events may from simple
causes spring. (Laughter.) To save himself
four or five minutes of a hot and dusty inter-
view in Colac, the Prince had alienated a
large number of persons. He is told that his
few minutes? stay would have furnished an
opportunity of cementing more closely this
colony to the mother country. But he would
not stay, and therefore, although the Colac
cement may be undiminished in quantity,
the ? ominous silence? shows that some of
the adhesive quality of the article is gone.
(Laughter.) Now, we smile at this little ex-
tract from the Colac Observer, and I confess
I laughed at it very heartily when I first read
it. But let us make the Colac case our own.
Suppose that, on the day of the levie, the
Prince, at the end of the presentations, had
rushed down the middle of the Exhibition-
building to luncheon, and said he would not
be bored with addresses at all, how would all
our be-gowned and gorgeously got up pre-
senters of addresses have looked under such
portentous circumstances ? Would they have
felt their own cement affected? Had they,
like the Colac Observer, done ? the ominous?

placent British Empire might e?en have
laughed at us, as we laugh at the ominous
silence of Colac, Everything is comparative.
London, fearing for the integrity of the
British Empire by reason of a Prince?s impa-
tience in one place or in another? Taking
with us, then, the little indications of indif-
ference or impatience to which I have re-
ferred as furnished from Adman?s Hotel,
from the bay, and from Colac, is it
too much to say that loyalty of this kind
is in large measure formal and mechanical ?
that it more unpleasantly resembles the mere
instinctive bustling and buzzing of bees
round their queen, than an operation of
man?s reason ; and that withal, it is at the
same time so complicated with our own self-
love that it is very apt to turn absolutely
sour, unless the vessel that contains it has
been previously well cleaned out from small
vanities and foolish desires for personal
notice ? I will not, however, venture to say
that I do not greatly admire or respect this
noisy and demonstrative loyalty, without
also giving you specific, and I trust not alto-
gether unsatisfactory reasons, for the want
of faith within me. I shall attempt, then,
first to show by evidence that this bee
loyalty not only almost necessarily cor-
rupts and deforms the moral character
both of the receiver and of the offerer
of it, but that it is a sentiment?if senti-
ment we can call it?so superficial, so
easily disturbed and displaced, that it affords
no reliable guarantee to any sovereign that
he may count upon it in any hour of need.
And first for the manner in which it corrupts
the character of the man who offers it. The
word courtier is synonymous with everything
that is hollow, insincere, and tricky in man.
Exeat auld qui vult esse plus (he must go from
court who would be honest). Histories,
biographies, and diaries of statesmen and
high officials, abound with the best authenti-
cated anecdotes touching the absurd and con-
temptible situations people about courts have
allowed themselves to be placed in, rather
than run any, the slightest, risk of falling
out of the Royal favour. I will, as my
memory serves me, give you one or two
of these anecdotes, to illustrate more dis-
tinctly what I here desire to convey to you,
A good story is told of a king who was once
curious to know which was the taller, himself
or a certain courtier. ?Let us measure,?
suggested the king. The king stood up to be
measured first; but when the person who
was selected to take their height came to
measure the nobleman, he found it quite im-
possible, as he first rose on tip-toe, then
crouched down, now shrugged up his shoul-
ders to the right, then twisted himself to the
left. Upon his friend afterwards asking him
the reason of these unaccountable gesticula-
tions, he replied, ?I could not tell whether
the King wished me to be taller or shorter
than himself ; and all the time I was making
those odd movements I was watching his
countenance to see what I ought to do.?
Here is another instance, not much less
absurd, although it also shows that
a man of a really independent spirit


can sometimes show it even at court, have thought that the English nation

related of Louis XIV. that, on the occasion of
a dispute with one of his courtiers over a
game of chess, no one of the bystanders
would give an opinion. ?Oh,? cried the
King, ?here comes Count Hamilton; he
shall decide which of us is in the right.?
?Your Majesty is in the wrong,? the count
replied, without looking at the board ; on
which the King, remonstrating with him on
the impossibility of his judging till he saw
the state of the game, he added, ?Does your
Majesty suppose that if you were in the right
all these noblemen would stand by and say
nothing?? If you desire, you may find
plenty more such indications of the courtier
character in the classes of works I have
mentioned. And now, on the other hand,
for the general effect on the recipient of this
kind of flattery. It evidently fosters an
egotism of so peculiar, and frequently of so
morbid a character, that it very often assumes
even the appearance of insanity. It puts
kings and princes above and beyond those
conditions and sanctions of social life which
surround and wholesomely limit and control
the pride and vanity of ordinary men. Upon
the Emperor Alexander of Russia once being
offered, when in England, a glass of wine by
a servant in livery, he started, it is said, as if
he had trodden on a snake. The mischievous
idiot King of Denmark, who married the un-
fortunate Caroline Matilda, the sister of our
George 111., among other Royal recreations,
used to amuse himself by ordering people to
box with him. If they refused, he punished
them for disobeying the Royal commands;
and if they complied and hit him too hard, he
punished them for assaulting the Royal per-
son. (Laughter.) It is an almost gross rude-
ness in Court etiquette to say anything to a
Royal person which can possibly imply that
his health is liable to disturbance like that of
ordinary flesh and blood. In the Table
Talk of Rogers, the Banker poet, he de-
scribes the following amusing incident
?Once when in company with William the
Fourth,? says Rogers, ? I quite forgot that it
is against all etiquette to ask a sovereign
about his health ; and on his saying to me,
* Mr, Rogers, I hope you are well, ? I replied,
? Very well, I thank your Majesty; I trust
that your Majesty is quite well also.? Never
was a king in greater confusion; he didn?t
know where to look, and stammered out,
?Yes, yes,?only a little rheumatism.?? Again,
in Kaikes'K Diary, where he comments on the
curious delusions of vanity under which the
Fourth George at times laboured, we find the
following remarkable testimony?? There is
no doubt that for several years before his
death, whether from early indulgence in
luxury, or from a malady inherent in his
family, his mind would occasionally wander,
and many anecdotes have been current of
the unfortunate impressions under which he
laboured. After the glorious termination in
1815, ot the long continental war, by the
battle of Waterloo, it would not, per-
haps, be unpardonable vanity in him to 1
event; but he certainly at times, in conver-
sation, arrogated to himself personally the
glory of subduing Napoleon?s power and
giving peace to the world. It was upon one
of these assumptions being reported to the
sarcastic Sheridan, that he archly remarked,
? That is all well enough, but what
he particularly piques himself upon is
the last abundant harvest.? (Laughter.)
We may add to Raikes by saying that
this form of delusion George the Fourth
inherited from his father. The latter once,
on the receipt of a despatch announcing
some advantage over the American colonists,
then in arms against the mother country,
rushed into the Queen?s room excitedly, ex-
claiming, ?Charlotte, Charlotte, I?ve beaten
all the Americans.? And when I speak of
the morbid and ungovernable self-will gene-
rated in the minds of princes by the flattery
of subjects, I know not where you may ob-
tain clearer proofs of the strength and the
manner of working of this feeling than from
the career of this very King. I apprehend
that few men possessed the domestic vir-
tues in larger measure than George the
Third. They were the basis of his
great popularity. He was a good husband,
an indulgent father, a kind friend, and,
moreover, a man; of the simplest tastes and
habits. His oft-quoted talent for making an
excellent dinner off a boiled leg of mutton
and turnips delighted his subjects, affording
such clear proof, as it did, that a Royal
stomach is human after all. One such touch
of nature?even through the digestive organs
?made him and all his subjects kin. Such,
then, being the original personal qualities of
George 111., one would naturally think that
he was about the least likely subject to be
spoiled by the regal attributes and liabilities.
And yet no man was more enslaved to a per-
fectly ungovernable wilfulness of character
where his claim to rule was actively opposed,
or even questioned. Witness his obstinate,
persistent, dogged determination to continue
the American war long after Lord North, his
Prime Minister, would have abandoned the
contest as at once unreasonable, hopeless,
and condemned by all the enlightened
statesmen of the day. In the mind of
a man naturally kind had grown up
a passionate sense of jealous authority,
which could not brook the merest show
of opposition ; and the destruction of thou-
sands upon thousands of human lives on
both sides was as nothing compared with the
intolerable abomination of a subject having
notions of taxation different from those of
his king. Again, look at the manner in
which this idol-worship of princes com-
monly relaxes in, and sometimes even obli-
terates from, their minds, not only a proper
regard for the opinions of others, but even
the ordinary virtues of gratitude, honesty,
truth, and friendship. A prince too fre-
quently comes to regard the world at large as
a huge bank of pleasure, on which he
may overdraw to any extent without his


cheques ever being dishonoured. Why is a Foxes, Sheridans, and Fitzpatricks of his day,
prince to have such a vulgar virtue as principally with the pious desire to vex his
gratitude, when the mere fact of his accept- father, for his subsequent conduct showed
ing a service or benefit is, in the ethics of that he was never a Whig at heart, assuming
most courts, a quite sufficient acknowledge- that he had a heart. He let his old com-
ing a service or benefit is, in the ethics of
most courts, a quite sufficient acknowledge-
ment and return of the service rendered ?
Look at the whole line of the Stuarts. Did
ever a more hopelessly selfish, ungrateful set
of men affront the moral sense of a nation ?
Even in the eyes of his apologist, Clarendon,
Charles the First was a man who knew no
touch of real friendship for any human crea-
ture ; he was truthful only when he could
gain nothing by falsehood. The using of
Strafford for the ends of his own Royal will,
or the signing of the death-warrant of Straf-
ford when those ends miscarried, was equally
justifiable and expedient for a king?s con-
venience. Charles the Second has been by
superficial popular opinion?ignorant of
Pepys?s account of him- considered rather
better than his father, because among other
good-natured sayings reported of him, is his
death-bed speech, ? Don?t let poor Nelly
starve.? Now, if he had really thought much
more about poor Nelly than he thought of
one of his spaniels, he might as well before
the time arrived for making this speech, have
settled a trifle on Nelly, and so have put her
above the possible neglect or caprice of survi-
vors. Follow the fortunes of this family as
you may, in their exile on the Continent, in
their heavy drafts on the blind and stupid
loyalty of the Scotch Highlanders, from the
flight of James the Second until the last
attempt of Charles Stuart in 1745, and you
see only a coarse, steadfast, undisguised egot-
ism?as if on an assumed inherent privilege
of the Lord?s anointed?manifested through-
out and in all things. These were the
undeniable things openly and commonly
uttered about the Stuarts by all men in the
days of the Regency. Had it been decent, or
courtly, or loyal to do so, even worse things
might with perfect truth have been openly, as
they were privately, said and known, of the
Regent himself. That a prince should cast
off old loves of which he is tired, is not much
thought of, and some allowance is, perhaps,
not unjustly made for the fact that he is not
generally able, as are men of more humble
rank, to choose a partner in life for himself.
Rut a prince is never under the necessity of
leaving an old lover to want and misery, and
this did George the Fourth by Mary
Robinson. He was equally heartless by
a still more serious connexion ; for
although he authorised his companion, Mr.
Fox, to go down to the House of Commons,
and deny, ? on authority,? Mr. Pitt?s asser-
tion of the Prince?s marriage with Mrs. Fitz-
herbert; yet it soon afterwards clearly
appeared that Mr. Fox had been duped, and
the lady?s feelings and reputation outraged,
inasmuch as the marriage had really taken
place. Again, mark this Prince?s conduct
among associates of his own sex. The case
must be a bad one, indeed, which can call for
the expulsion of the Heir Apparent from the
Jockey Club, and yet George Prince of Wales
tras so expelled. He mixed freely with the
panion Sheridan?his advocate and creature
in the House of Commons, and the panderer
to some of the least creditable of his Royal
pleasures?die almost wanting the necessaries
of life; and his manner of leaving Beau
Brummell to a like fate is so characteristic as
to be worth more than a passing glance.
When Brummell (presuming on an inti-
macy which to the poor beau had all the
appearance of that ease and mutuality of
licence common among equals) said, ?Wales,
ring the bell,? and Wales did ring the bell,
but only to order Bruramell?s carriage, the
latter realised for life the danger of presuming
too much on Royal condescension, however
familiarly that condescension may be mani-
fested. Too effectually poor cast-off Brum-
mell learned that a prince never forgets the
distance in rank between himself and an
ordinary subject, any more than a cat forgets
when you are romping with her that she has
sharp claws within those velvet paws of hers.
Banished at once, and for good, from the
sunshine of the Royal countenance, and
being unfit for any other sort of company, he
drifts into a sort of small consular employ-
ment somewhere on the Continent, and finally
dies in obscurity and want George IV.
thinking no more of him than of a cast-off old
shoe. Whilst unable to pity the poor fallen
parasite, we are compelled into despising the
miserable smallness of ?the first gentle-
man in Europe,? as he was called by
the Court journalists of the day. (Ap-
plause.) With such precedents of princely
bearing, then, as these before our eyes,
why should a people, with any preten-
sions to knowledge of human nature, be so
much put out, as many of our citizens were
the other day, on reading that �3,soo?(laugh-
ter) ?had been put on the Imperial Estimates
to defray the expense of the presents made by
the Duke of Edinburgh when in Australia?
When Captain Cook took out his stock of
glass beads, and looking-glasses, and red
cloth, with which to win the affections of the
artless savages of the South Sea Islands, who-
ever expected he was to bear the cost of, as
well as distribute, these harmless trifles?
? But the destruction of the sentiment of the
thing!? some one may, perhaps, object.
Well, there is something in that. (Cheers.)
I must admit this �3,500 looks too much as if
Romeo had kept a pocket-ledger, and had
therein duly entered to the debit of Juliet
the cost of any little presents?(laughter)
?he might have made her during his
moonlight courtship, with the object after-
wards of putting the values on old Capu-
let?s ?estimates? if the business should
ever come to marriage settlements. (Re-
newed cheers and laughter.) But to pro-
ceed. I think it can hardly have [escaped
you a moment back, when I was reporting
Sheridan?s facetious sarcasm at the expense
of George IV., how the satellites of kings are


accustomed to relieve their sense of humilia-
tion by ridiculing those idols behind their
backs, in the presence of which the irre-
verent scoffers can hardly stand upright.
A king, therefore, and more especially an ab-
solute king, must live, move, and have his
very being in an atmosphere of falsehood, and
if he happen to fall on evil times he may per-
haps have many courtiers, but assuredly he
will have but few friends. Cast back your
minds to a period which can be easily covered
by the memories of many now present. How
many thrones have fallen within our own
generation! Where are now the family of
Louis Philippe of France? Where the ex-
Royal family of Naples? With what ap-
parent unconcern did all Europe, a few years
back, behold the late King of Hanover, the
first cousin of our Queen, driven forth from
his little kingdom ! How coolly is Count Bis-
mark, even now, proceeding to appropriate
this ex-king?s immense private property, on
the plea that he and other refugees??reptiles?
as the count calls them ?are using the in-
come from this wealth in the subsidising of
journals to vilify and undermine the power of
Prussia. With what cold-blooded indiffer-
ence did those half savages, the Mexicans,
shoot the poor ill-starred Emperor, who
had been exported to them by his patron,
Louis Napoleon ! How summarily was
King Otho deposed by his restless sub-
jects, and another prince placed on the little
throne of Greece; and last, but not least,
look at the most recent Royal ruin of all?
the expulsion and flight of Isabella of Spain,
? the last of the Bourbons,? as she is called.
Disreputable as this woman was in her life,
and altogether contemptible in intellect, yet
you have to consider how hard it is to change
a nation?s habits ; and Spain has been for so
many centuries a monarchy that it is even
yet problematical whether she will, or rather
can, settle down to any other form of govern-
ment. Enough, however, has already been
achieved to show that courtiers melt away
before revolutions like morning mists before
the mounting sun ; and it is certain that
Europe, even in her darkest recesses, has lost the
old, simple, confiding, uninquiring sentiment
with which men once regarded the position and
character of a crowned head. And yet the fine
expression of Shakspeare, ? ? There is a divinity
doth hedge a king,? is, with some qualifica-
tion, as true now as ever it was. (Applause.)
But he must be a king who lives and rules
according to the age into which he is born.
(Cheers.) He must not be a solecism in go-
vernment, running counter to the best intel-
lect and the noblest purposes of the society
over which Providence has called upon him
to preside. (Renewed cheers.) In one word,
he must be what we call a constitutional
sovereign?such a sovereign as, I think, all
here present will admit our Queen Victoria
to be. (Continued applause.) With no spirit
of adulation would I profane this part of my
subject. But think for an instant of the
contrast between the two contemporaneous
queens?the Queen of England and the
Queen of Spain?the one an outcast from her
kingdom, seeking an asylum in a foreign
land ; the other, reigning secure in the hearts
of her people, and with a nation for
her body-guard. (Prolonged cheers.) Have
we far to seek to understand the difference?
Speaking from this side of the world about
our Queen, we may, perhaps, without indeli-
cacy, use almost the freedom of history. I
shall do so with all respect, and lam sure
with all truth. In her early youth it was the
peculiar good fortune of the Princess Victoria
to be surrounded by wise and constitutional
teachers, and their counsels fell on a kindly
soil. Her uncle, the Dube of Sussex, of all
the then Royal family the most liberal in his
views, and the most commonly coming in
contact with the people at public dinners
and at other popular gatherings, was one of
her most trusted advisers. She was carefully
trained, therefore, with special reference to
the future high destiny that awaited her.
We cannot read the graphic account which
has been published of the ease, the dignity,
and the thorough self-possession with
which the girl Queen presided at her
first Cabinet without perceiving
distinctly the care with which she had j
been trained to her exalted station. It was
her singularly happy fortune, too, to be I
wedded when young to a? partner whose re-
markable abilities and sound judgment were
equalled, if not exceeded, by a kindly dispo-
sition and an elevated and conscientious
character, ever mindful of the critical and
most important position he occupied. All
their subsequent history, apart from such re- j
velations as come down from Court circles to
society at large, has been made familiar to us
all in a narrative which affords an almost
perfect picture of thoroughly happy wedded
life. And throughout this life, so bene-
ficially influential as it must have been
on society, Queen Victoria held, and has
conscientiously discharged, the duties of
a British sovereign, holding her high
estate under the law. The will of the peo-
ple, as expressed through their Parliament,
has ever been to her the object of her peculiar
solicitude, of which truth many illustrations
have been afforded during'her prosperous and
memorable reign. The most interesting evi- \
dence of this has been afforded us within the i
last few months. I do not know how it
struck my hearers, but, speaking for myself, j
I must? say that I never read anything with I
greater interest, or anything which ever yet j
excited in myself so lively a feeling of admira- I
tion for the character of the Queen, as the I
account we recently received through the {
English newspapers, detailing the particulars [
of her interview with Mr. Bright on the occa- |
sion of his becoming a Cabinet Minister. I
(Applause.) Does history afford quite such I
another case of extremes meeting? Is such I
another proof to be found of the elasticity |
of the British Constitution ? Thirty years j
back politicians, either in or out of I
Parliament would as soon have thought of [
William Cobbett, or of Orator Hunt, as of [
Mr. Bright being tendered office under the I
Crown, much less an office which, if accepted, I


must necessarily bring the holder of it into
habitual communication with Majesty itself.
And in the present case, in estimating the
conduct of the Queen, we are not to lose
sight of the fact that her previous habits and
associations, and those of her new Ministry,
must necessarily have caused Queen and sub-
ject to form very different opinions from each
other on many most important questions.
The Queen?s whole life and conversation
have been among the very 4lite of Eng-
land?s wealthy, powerful, and (in favour
of their own order) naturally prejudiced
aristocracy. On the other hand, Mr.
Bright, born and bred in the middle
class, has, from his earliest manhood,
steadily held most liberal, not to say extreme,
opinions ; has sometimes stood almost alone
in his resolute opposition to the war policy of
successive Ministries; has frequently de-
nounced the large army and navy establish-
ments as being maintained merely as a mode
of supporting the younger and poorer scions
of the governing classes out of the public
purse; has habitually praised the economy
and efficiency of various Transatlantic insti-
tutions, and has dealt so many and such
vigorous blows at the aristocracy that they
could not possibly have grieved had he
broken a blood-vessel, and dropped down
dead in the midst of one of his ablest phi-
lippics. No wonder, therefore, that Mr. Glad-
stone felt some very natural embarrassment,
when the thought first entered his head of
offering Mr. Bright a post in the Cabinet. On
the one hand he saw a man who by talent,
by influence, and by character?for character
still counts for something in England, in a
public man, and more especially in aMinister
(applause)?was already indicated by the
public mind for high office; on the other
hand was Her Majesty, who might not un-
reasonably?if swayed merely by personal
considerations ?object to Mr. Bright?s ap-
pointment. But what course did she take ?
With a frankness and a candour, and a sub-
ordination of every other feeling to her
sense of public duty, she at once expressed
her willingness to receive Mr. Bright as one
of her advisers. Attended by one of her
daughters, she gave him a personal and
special interview, and as we read of _ Mr,
Bright?s happy compliments to the amiable
young princess, we almost see Milton?s genial
and sagacious elephant ? wreathing his
proboscis lithe, to make them sport.?
Such an historical picture as this is to
We, at the least, as delightful as that big
piece of work of Mr. Haydon?s hang-
ing on our walls, called the banishment
ef Aristides. (Laughter.) The loyalty, then,
ef which I spoke at the outset of these obser-
vations, as the loyalty I should seek to explain
and defend, as distinguished from the bee-
loyalty of which I have spoken, is that senti-
ment which any, the wisest man, may reason-
ably feel and heartily express, viz., the
fidelity of a citizen to a sovereign like this,
for it is the loyalty which at once respects
ffself and its object, as expressly symbolising
the morality and dignity of the state, and
whilst not exacting too much, with a ?proud
submission? gives homage where homage is
felt to be due. It is a loyalty which is alone
consistent with the stability of empires. For
does not that philosophy which teaches by
example show us that most of the revolu-
tions and changes of dynasties we read
of in history were the inevitable results
of princes and peoples losing sight of or
disregarding the duties owing by each to
the other?subjects too often forgetting
that princes were only men, and princes
as often appearing to think that subjects were
not men at all? (Applause.) ?The misfor-
tunes of princes,? said that poor Isabella the
other day, writing from her place of exile,
?fall heavily on their subjects.? Poor royal
refugee. She would have been nearer the
mark had she said, ?The misfortunes of
princes too frequently arise from their mis-
taking themselves for the state. ? Committing
this fatal error, their power is Hobbes?s levia-
than turned upside down ?a pyramid trying
to stand on its apex instead of on its base.
(Laughter.) Now, in the remarks which I
have thus far made on this subject, I have
considered it merely in connexion with mo-
narchical government. And butthat I should
not in the length of this lecture be properly
respecting the ? Early Closing Movement,? I
could say much?but I will say very little?on
loyalty under other forms of government,
and more especially under a republic.
It has been my good fortune at dif-
ferent times in my life to be thrown
into the company of cultivated and
well informed Americans, moving in poli-
tical circles in England. _ It is, of course,
quite natural and becoming, that, born and
nurtured under a republic, they should prefer
her institutions before all others. Accordingly
they would sometimes, in a quite polite and
good-humoured spirit, in the_ course of poli-
tical discussions, quietly quiz our English
loyalty, even of the more rational kind, as a
something scarcely comprehensible?a sort of
mild and harmless madness, perplexing to
political philosophers. (Laughter.) _ At the
same time they would delicately insinuate
that in America there were no subjects, that
every citizen was a sovereign, and, _ therefore,
entirely master of himself, which is the very
essence of true liberty. I confess there was a
time when such representations as these made
some impression on me. And even now,
perhaps, some of us may be prepared to grant,
conditionally, thatarepublicanform ofgovern-
ment is theoretically the best form of govern-
ment thathuman ingenuity hasever invented.
(Hear, hear). But the condition I would con-
tend for as accompanying such an admission,
is an important one, and it is this?that the
community to live under such a government
should be at once thoroughly wise, tho-
roughly honest, thoroughly unselfish, and
thoroughly free from all disturbing pas-
sions in the administration of that govern-
ment. (Cheers and laughter). In the exact
proportion in which any people fall
short of this description must, as I think,
republican government fail to answer the


expectations of its friends. The theory of
republican government necessarily presup-
poses that unfettered play of political forces
which shall bring the wisest and the best of
the citizens to the management of the state.
But that same play of the political forces
which amongst good and unselfish politicians
would yield the best and wisest men for
rulers, will and must, among selfish politi-
cians, give us inferior men even in the
highest places. (Cheers.) Thus all the most
respectable American writers are agreed, that
for many years past, no man of fine talents
or of large and statesmanlike qualifications,
has been elected to the presidential chair of
the United States. At the same time, this
?effect defective? is attributed by the same
authorities to the patent fact, that the
self-regarding jealousies of the ablest men
have led to compromises which put me-
diocrity at the head because higher
ability would not yield to his fellow
from any regard to the state. Now, a tem-
Eorary monarch of a republic, attaining to
is elevation under these circumstances,
is certainly not an object to evoke any very
enthusiastic sentiment of loyalty ; and ac-
cordingly we do not find that American
citizens either write or speak of their Presi-
dents in a spirit either of reverence or
respect. What, then, is the proper object of
American loyalty? They are consistent in
answering, ? It is the sovereign people them-
selves.? It is a thirty-million-headed sovereign,
instead of a sovereign of one head. Let us
look at this loyalty a little closer, and see
what the article is like. We are told by
American travellers, and it is not denied by
American statesmen, that every citizen?
being, of course, a thirty-millionth part of
a sovereign?conceives that he has the
right (and a very inconvenient number of
thirty-millionth parts exercises this right)
of calling on the President at the
White-house, and haying an interview with
him, although these visitors may not, in fact,
have any business whatever to transact.
(Laughter.) Only a few months back I was
reading in an English newspaper an utter-
ance of our old friend and fellow-colonist
George Francis Train?(loud laughter) ?whilst
E rotesting against the imprisonment to which
e was recently subjected in England, and I
was amused by the form of a threat which
he used, to the effect ?that he should
write to his servant, Mr. Johnson ?
(laughter)?the Mr. Johnson referred to
being no other than the then President
of the United States. Now, our loyalty may
be slavery, according to the George Francis
Train frame of mind ; but does not his
expression very strongly savour of absolute
tyranny?and is that much better? From
what can this monstrous feeling arise except
from pride or vanity, or both ? From what
but a rooted notion that the individual
citizen has a sort of undivided interest or
proprietorship in the person of the Pre-
sident, who is assumed to be always liable
to be inspected and spoken to, and to
have his hand shaken by any of his
owners (laughter) whenever they have
leisure or inclination to drop in upon him to
do so. (Laughter.) It will not do to say in
defence of this practice that it is intended as
complimentary to the officer. He has other
and higher business than to receive mere
time-consuming calls. No, I believe the true
motive of such calls to be what I have stated,
an ? I?m as good as you? sort of feeling, the
indulgence of which degrades a great officer
down to some mere show thing in a public
museum. (Laughter.) Rather vividly re-
curred to my mind this mode of dealing
with Presidents, when I saw all persons
whatsoever, the most delicate and weakly
women as well as the strongest men, on
various occasions and in almost every com pany
always standing in the presence of the Duke
of Edinburgh. Can there be no golden
mean, thought I, which will enable loyal sub-
jects to express all becoming respect for the
highest rank and position, without a super-
fluous self-abasement which is not altogether
free from the ludicrous ? May we not show all
reasonable reverence to the Pope without kiss-
ing his toe? (Laughter and cheers.) Must we
always either stand in the presence of Princes
and Presidents, or for ever see their right
arms wrung out of their shoulder-joints by
an endless succession of hand-shakers, who
claim to exercise their sovereignty by this
pump-handle process ? (Laughter.) If there
can be no mean between these extremes in
manners, the choice is unquestionably a nar-
row and unpleasant one. In the one case, we
seem to raise a mere human creature?perhaps
altogether irrespective of merit?into what
Lord Bacon calls ? a God upon earthin
the other case, we tolerate a democratic
tyrant who only worships himself, whilst
affecting a civility to the Constitutional head
of the state. After a little reflection, how-
ever, I decided for myself?l do not say I am
right; it is much a matter of taste?that were
I compelled to choose between the two, I would
rather stand before a stupid king until I was
ready to drop, than I would see a possibly
very wise President bored to death by an im-
prudent intruder, calling himself the public.
In the one case we abate our pretensions out
of a regard for what we deem necessary
and convenient restraints in human inter-
course ; in the other case, we defy all such re-
straints in the contemplation of our beautiful
and all-powerful selves. And as ceremony
is a portion of the necessary machinery
of society, I would prefer even the
pliant demeanour of a courtier of the
old sort to the insolent and ignorant self-
assertion which assumes to be always carry-
ing sovereignty about in its own private and
particular stomach. (Laughter.) I have
dwelt more particularly on this phase of Re-
publicanism, because our American cousins
are sometimes rather prone to float us pool
creatures of monarchy as down-trodden, and
as yet unacquainted, in our besotted
loyalty, with the true principles of civil
liberty. In this, I confess, their man-
ner of going to work too unpleasantly re-
minds me of the mode in which Diogenes


lectured Plato. "Thus I trample on your
splendour and pride,? cried the snarling and
self-complacent old cynic, "With still greater
pride, oh Diogenes,? returned Plato to the
celebrated tenant of the tub. Royalists and
Republicans then, respectively, may just as
well agree to mind their own business, and
learn and correct, as best they may,
the defects in the morals and manners
of their own governing men. There may,
perhaps, be in the one country too
coarse a sense of what is required in the
rulers of a great state. There is, I
humbly venture to think, too much obse-
quiousness to, and a too lax toleration of, the
vices of Royal persons in the other country.
The latter important consideration is our
business, and the business of every thought-
ful Englishman, to endeavour to understand,
and, if possible, to correct. But you may say
how is it possible to understand the ways of
Royal persons? and are not the causes of
their modes of feeling and action too
subtle and inscrutable to admit of any
remedy from art? Now, in answering
such a question, I must further respect-
fully submit that evils which have been
either produced or aggravated by art, ought
to be corrigible by art: and that you may not
think I am disposed to talk in enigmas, I
come at once to the point, by saying that I do
thoroughly believe that a disastrous effect has
been for many years produced on the n orale
of English princes by the Royal Marriage Act,
which, in the year 1772, and at the suggestion
of the proud, short-sighted, leg-of-mutton-
loving king already referred to, was passed
under very discreditable circumstances, and
with shamelessly indecent haste, by one of
the most contemptible and slavish Parlia-
ments that ever sat within the ancient chapel
of St, Stephen. As Mr. Timbs would say, it is
among the things not generally known, that
George 111. got conceded to him by this act
an additional point of prerogative (involving
a co-extensive derogation of private liberty)
to which no preceding English monarch had
ever made any pretensions. It was this. He
obtained the law?as it now stands in the
statute book?enacting ?That no descend-
ant of the body of George 11., other than
the issue of princesses married into foreign
families, shall be capable of contracting mar-
riage without the previous consent of the
sovereign, signified under the great seal;
and any such marriage without such
consent is declared void. But such de-
scendants, if above the age of twenty-
five, may, after twelve months? notice
given to the Privy Council, contract and
solemnise marriage without consent of the
Grown, unless both Houses of Parliament
shall, before the expiration of the year, ex-
pressly declare their disapproval of such in-
tended marriage. The penalties of praemunire
a re visitable upon all persons who shall
solemnise, assist, or be present at such mar-
riage,? The Royal message which was the
Precursor to the introduction of this extra-
ordinary bill is unique and interesting, and
m ay, without any great prejudice to " our
early-closing movement,? be quoted in its
very terms. It sets forth?? That His Majesty,
being desirous, from paternal affection to his
own family, and anxious concern for the
future welfare of his people [carry these ex-
quisite words carefully in your memory, as
they must be looked at again presently]
and the honour and dignity of his crown,
that the right of approving all marriages in
the Royal Family (which ever has belonged to
the kings of this realm as a matter of public
concern) may be made effectual, recommends
to both Houses to take into their serious con-
sideration whether it may not be wise and ex-
dient to supply the defects of the law now in
being, and by some new provision more effec-
tually to guard the descendants of his late
majesty [meaning, of course, all George
the Third?s brothers and sisters, and
their descendants, direct and collateral]
other than the issue of princesses who
have married, or may hereafter marry,
into foreign families, from marrying without
the approbation of his majesty, his heirs, or
successors first had and obtained.? The bill
introduced in pursuance of this message was
vigorously opposed in the House of Lords,
where it was first launched, and it was still
more resolutely fought in the House of Com-
mons, the most consummate genius of that
day, Edmund Burke, being there the fore-
most of its uncompromising assailants. All
opposition was vain against obsequious ma-
jorities of ? King?s friends,? the name
given to the legislative tools who had
been bought and paid for by the King?s
money. During the progress of the measure,
the opinions of the judges were taken on the
contested point of prerogative, and nine out
of twelve of these learned persons plainly said
that the King?s ? care and approbation? of
Royal marriages extended only to ?the
children of the King, and the presumptive
heir to the Crown (other than the issue of
foreign families); but to what other branch
of the Royal family such care and appro-
bation do extend, the judges did not
find determined.? Despite this judicial
condemnation of the King?s pretensions,
the bill passed the House of Lords in a very
few days, having been introduced late in the
month of February, 1772, and read the third
time on the 3rd of March, Its passage through
the Commons was equally triumphant; and
thus his most sacred Majesty became not
only King of Great Britain and Ireland, and
their then pendant nuisance, Hanover, but
he also became the legalised tyrant over
the natural affections of every other
member of his own family, with the
trilling exceptions mentioned in the bill,
The merely personal considerations on which
George 111. moved in this matter were
patent enough. Only a few years before, to
his great disgust, his brother the Duke of
Gloucester had married the Countess Dowager
of Waldegrave, but the duke had not publicly
acknowledged her as his wife, nor had she
assumed his title. At Court she was neither
received as his wife nor regarded as his mis-
tress, but she held in that august region?


where the rigour even of female virtue
was at times tempered by fashion?a sort
of suspended position, like Mahomet?s
coffin, between these two characters.
This alliance of itself was enough to
vex the pride of the King and outrage
his German wife?s passion for Royal quarter-
ings. But soon came another, and still
stronger outrage of the same kind. In the
latter end of 1771, another brother of the
King, the Duke of Cumberland, announced
his marriage with Mrs. Horton, whom he at
once recognised as Duchess of Cumberland.
As an aggravation of the bitterness of this
last dose, Mrs. Horton, a daughter of Lord
Irwin, was the sister of the Colonel Luttrell,
who had been assisted by all the Court party
in ousting Wilkes from his seat for Middlesex.
Walpole remaiks on this odd conjunction,
? Could punishment be more severe than to
be thus scourged by their own instrument
And how singular the fate of Wilkes, that
new revenge always presented itself to him
when he was sunk to the lowest ebb.? The
public acknowledgement by the Duke of Cum-
berland of his marriage was followed by a
similar avowal by the Duke of Gloucester in
favour of his wife, who was, of course, not
now disposed to remain any longer, coffin-
wise, socially suspended as aforesaid, while
her sister-in-law of Cumberland trod the
earth as a real, live, acknowledged Royal
duchess. And now, of course, George
the Third?s cup of bitterness was full. He
made one effort to annul these mar-
riages as illegal under the existing
Marriage Act, but failed, inasmuch as his
father had ingeniously contrived that that
act should not extend to the Royal family.
The best consolation, therefore, was to devise
this new Marriage Act, to the terms of
which I have just called your attention.
Never, perhaps, did a law more absurdly
fall short of its ostensible purpose. George
111 lived to verify in all its bitterness
the truth that even powerful kings must
fight a losing battle with Nature. It was from
paternal affection for his family, and anxious
concern for the future welfare of his people
forsooth, that his son the Prince of Wales
should have a goodly succession of English
concubines, but not one English wife ; that
his second son, the Duke of York, should be
under the thraldom of a Mrs. Clarke, and
that he should disgrace the office of
commander-in-chief as never before nor
since has it been disgraced, by allow-
ing his clever and commercially-minded
mistress to sell commissions in his
father?s army, which thus became the
fruitful exchequer of a shameless and ex-
travagant wanton ; it was for ? the welfare
of the people? that his son, the Duke of
Clarence, should be prevented from marrying
any daughter of England, and that in the
fulness of time he should confer on that
country the honour of supporting a family of
Eitzclarences, of whom Mrs. Jordan, the
actress, was the mother ; it was for the honour
of the Crown that the Duke of Cumberland,
another son, should become the most detested
man in England for profligate treacheries
which made his very name and title by-
words of hatred and contempt ; it was
?paternal affection for his family,? and a
regard for the dignity of his Crown, that his
brothers and sons should not degrade them-
selves by honest and honourable marriages
of affection with the daughters of English
noblemen and gentlemen, but that England
might enjoy the distinguished honour of
supplying his sons with mistresses, whilst
their wives should be supplied by a foreign
country ; a country, too, consisting of a con-
geries of petty electorates and shabby-gen-
teel principalities?of one of which the
not very bad story has been told (I
am afraid it is an old one) of a country-
man of ours once being stopped for his
passport by a soldier at the gate of a Ger-
man town, and being asked who he was,
made answer that he was ?An elector of
Middlesex.? (Laughter.) The whole guard
were at once turned out to present arms to
him as to a Royal person. (Loud laughter
and cheers.) Now, these immediate results
of the Royal Marriage Act are by no means
all, nor even the most important, moral and
social consequences of that measure. It has
produced in the public mind a sort of settled
and contented conviction that there must be
one sort cf morality for Royal personages, and
another sort of morality for their inferiors in
rank ; and this kind of conviction naturally
tends to the conclusion, in too many minds,
that all morality whatsoever is merely con-
ventional, and may be outraged at will, ac-
cording to the rank, or influence, or power,
of the offender. That such feelings as these
must inevitably tend to the demoralisation
of a people, there can be no doubt; and
therefore, if there were no more than this to be
said against the Royal Marriage Act, it must
be condemned. But when, in addition to
such weighty considerations, we find that it
necessarily fosters the notion in princes
themselves that they are not ordinary flesh
and blood; that they are an insulated and
sacred ? caste,? exempt from the judgments
visitable upon common men ; that the wages
of sin to them need not be death, but will
probably be a handsome Parliamentary grant
?(cheers and laughter)?we are presented
with matter for very serious thought indeed.
Nor are the evils merely of a moral character.
Royal marriages, exclusively Continental,
begetdynastic entanglements whichin time be-
come embarrassing to British Governments and
British interests, as statesmen have too fre-
quently discovered in these latter days. Such,
then, being the natural and the bitter fruits
of the Royal Marriage Act, it is not unreason-
able to think that in these reforming times
the supporters of this act, if there be any, are
very likely to be soon called upon to
cause why it should not be repealed, (Great
applause.) When we are giving liberty to all
lower men, why are we not to give an honour-
able liberty to the natural affections of Eng-
lish princes? (Cheers.) Why should not
they, especially those of them who are
never likely to come to the throne ?pas�


gracefully into general society, and thus by
marriage not only consult their own inclina-
tions, but perhaps make themselves inde-
pendent of the British taxpayer? Such
alliances were common enough in our earlier
history, and are certainly not less reasonable
now. If it shall be objected that we should
be unduly derogating from the dignity of the
Royal rank, we have two answers. What
was no derogation among our feudal fore-
fathers can be no derogation in this our
more liberal age, when wealth and more ex-
tended culture are so rapidly softening away
the hard edges of exclusiveness. But, secondly,
reason this matter as we may, there is a spirit
of progress abroad which will not be scared
from any question. Everything old and new
is being weighed in utilitarian scales ; and
even highest rank, in divers places, begins to
see that to be respected it must work.
(Great applause.) This weak notion of coming
down from position- where the coming down
involves nothing dishonourable appals
only the maudlin and the sickly sentimental.
Almost daily we see noblemen more en-
lightened than, and with moral purpose in
advance of, their fellows, beginning to dis-
cover that if they cannot maintain all their
children, they must put them to some form
of honest industry in this hard-working
world. The Duke of Argyle recently placed
?as we are told in the newspapers?one of
his younger sons in a wine merchant?s firm in
Edinburgh. What sensible man will think
the worse of him, if he only sells a good
article?(great laughter)?and distinguishes
himself in the trade by introducing our best
Australian vintages to the home markets?
(Renewed laughter and cheers.) The other
day another nobleman, Lord Claud Hamil-
ton, was a successful defendant in our
Supreme Court, sued as a late owner of
one of the now defunct Panama line of
steamers. Let us wish his lordship more
success in his next enterprise. Even the
Duke of Edinburgh himself, according
to the latest information, is a shareholder
in a gold mine in New Zealand. If
he be destined to know the delights of
dividends, it will add, I am sure, to his plea-
sant recollections of the southern hemisphere,
and if his fate shall be ? calls??(laughter)?it
will still be that valuable chastening of the
spirit?provided the calls be not put on the
estimates?(great applause and laughter)?
which has made so many of us wiser and
soberer men. Here, then, have we a few
only of the many indications signifi-
cant enough of coming changes in the
modes of thought and in the habits of
society. Upon the whole, surely?the latest
news notwithstanding?human affairs look
wholesome enough throughout the world.
Everywhere we see the loyalty to mere per-
sons rising into a loyalty to principles and to
truth. (Loud cheers.) A noble race seems to
oe going on almost all over the world be-
tween material progress on the one hand
and moral progress on the other. (Cheers.)
What a budget did that last mail bring us !
what were the conquests of Alexanders and
of Crcsars compared with the peaceful con-
quests now being made over this globe
itself. Suez canals, railroads from At-
lantic to Pacific, the rush of the locomotive
soon to be heard hundreds of fathoms down
in those old Alps which were mightier than
armies to a Hannibal and a Napoleon. And
the same papers that tell us of these wondrous
things have side by side in their columns not
less noble conquests over prejudice and igno-
rance and greed and oppression. We see that
old and crying injustice the Irish Established
Church tottering to its fall. (Cheers.) We
see a House of Commons apparently in
earnest, and we see a debilitated House of
Lords taking homoeopathic doses of life mem-
bers?(laughter)?two pills a yeartokeep it on
its noble legs?(laughter)?and oh, wonder of
wonders, we see Mr. Childers commanding
in person the Channel fleet! (Cheers and
laughter.) True, as a set-off to these amaz-
ing facts, we are told that war between
perhaps the two greatest powers in the
world, Great Britain and America, is possible,
if not imminent. Let us hope that wisdom
and moderation, a Christian consideration
for human life, a regard for their commerce
and industry, and a due prescience of the
ruinous expense and the enormous future
taxation attendant on hundreds of millions
shot away in war, will avert from them and
from us this direst of calamities to the ad-
vancing civilisation of the times. (Cheers.) But
should wisdom and moderation not prevail, we
are yet not without hope and a strong confi-
dence in the future. Let Mr. Sumner talk
his tallest ?(laughter)?let Louis Napoleon
plot his deepest?Childers commands the
Channel fleet! (Much laughter.) You may
read all about it for yourselves in The Times
of the 20th of May last. ? I believe,? writes
the special historian of this cruise, which
seems to have been off the Scilly Islands?
(laughter)??l believe that this cruise is the
only instance in which a first lord has
commanded a British fleet at sea in
person, and also attended Divine service
bn Sunday on board his own flagship.?
(Laughter and cheers.) We read that
the thunders of Pericles?s eloquence were
only heard, even as their sacred Sala-
minian galley was only brought out by the
Athenians on the most important crises of
the state ; and in like manner, the Lord
High Admiral Childers takes to the sea when
war lowers on the western horizon. In sober
earnest, let us express our gratification that
England has apparently found a very efficient
First Lord of the Admiralty in one who
received his political and administrative
education in this our own colony of Victoria.
And now, in saying good night, let me
apologise by anticipation, if, in the course
of handling a somewhat ticklish subject, I
have given pain to any one here. We are
not all equally endowed with the organ of
veneration ; and I may not have brought to
the treatment of my subject?regarded as a
very serious one by many? as much serious
ness as it demands. A Roman poet, how-
ever, of some authority on these points,


tells us that it is pleasant, and not
unbecoming, to relax our gravity, in
the proper place, and I can most honestly
assure you I have only laughed when I could
not help it. But what is of more account to
the young men of the early-closing move-
ment, I have sought to show, and I hope not
entirely without success, how all rank, even
the highest, is worthless, if not mischievous,
without personal character; that amidst
all the degrees and titles into which
kings and heralds can split the human
race, intellect and integrity must, in the
long run, rule the world ; that every indi-
vidual man has his personal dignity in his
own keeping, independent of any dignity any
other finite creature like himself can confer
upon him, and that, in short, prince and pea-
sant alike, must bow to the inevitable judg-
ment that?
? Honour and shame from no condition rise,
Act well your part, there all the honour lies.
Fortune in men hath some small difference made.
One flaunts in rags, one flutters in brocade,
The cobbler apron'd, and the parson gown?d,
The friar hooded, and the monarch crown?d :
?What differ more,? you cry, ?than crown and
cowl?? . . ,
I?ll tell you friend, a wise man and a fool.
You?ll find if once the monarch acts the monk,
Or, cobbler-like, the parson will be drunk,
Worth makes the man, and want of itthe fellow.
The rest is all but leather and prunella.
(Loud and continued cheering.)
Professor M'Cot proposed a vote of thanks
to the lecturer for the brilliant discourse he
had delivered. (Loud and continued cheer*
ing.)
Mr. T. Moobeay (mayor of Melbourne)
seconded the motion, which was carried by
acclamation.
Mr, Michxe briefly replied, apologising for
having infringed the principles of the Early
Closing Association by detaining his auditors
until such a late hour?(cheers)?and con-
cluded by proposing a vote of thanks to the
chairman, who, though he had had not a
very arduous task to perform that evening, had
exhibited that dignified repose and perfect
neutrality which were always happily attractive
and becoming m a member of the Upper
House.
Captain Amsinck, R.N., seconded the mo-
tion, which was carried unanimously.
The Chairman briefly acknowledged the
compliment, and expressed his entire sym-
pathy with the objects of the Early Closing
Association.
The proceedings then terminated, and the
meeting dispersed.

THE FROG AND THE OX.
The seventh of the series of lectures on be-
half of the Early-Closing Society of Mel-
bourne was given on Monday by Mr. James
Smith, who chose for his subject ? The Frog
and the Ox,? as told in one of La Fontaine?s
fables. The attendance was good. It was
intended that the Hon. T. H. Fellows should
preside as chairman, but in his unavoidable
absence on circuit, his place was taken by Mr.
K. Murray Smith.
The Chairman opened the proceedings by
apologising for Mr. Fellows? absence, and
briefly introduced the lecturer to the meet-
ing.
Mr. Jambs Smith came forward, amid ap-
plause, and said, ?Custom prescribes that
those who preach sermons should precede
them by the delivery of a text, and as a lec-
ture is a species of secular sermon, I will pre-
face my own with a few lines, which you will
find in one of the fables of La Fontaine.
They are as follow :
? A frog, no bigger than a pullet?s egg,
A fat ox, feeding in a meadow, spied.
envious little creature blew and swelled;
In vain to reach the big bull?s bulk she tried.
? Sister, now look ! observe me close !? she cried.
'ls this enough ?? ?No !? ? Tell me ! now then, see !?
?No, no !? ? Well, now I?m quite as big as he ??
You?re scarcely bigger than you were at first.?
One more tremendous puff?she grew so large?she
burst.?
Now, the ox, I think, may be looked upon as
typifying a great and venerable empire?like
that, for example, to which we have the
honour to belong; while the frog may be
accepted as the representative of some small
community?suppose we say that of Nomans-
land?which has a disagreeable habit of dis-
tending its dimensions in a vain effort to
emulate the bovine bulk, and of imitating?
though with indifferent success ?the bovine
bellow. If, by any chance, a newspaper has ever
reached you from the colony of Nomans-
land, you will find that its public speakers and
Public writers are greatly addicted to the
practice of asseverating that theirs ?is a
great country,? and that they ? are a great
people.? And within certain limitations this
is true. But it is only true relatively. The
frog is a remarkably fine frog of its age, with
a spacious marsh to pasture in; plenty of
nutritious food, a strong, healthy croak, and
a vigour of muscle that would do credit to
the celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras
before the sharp-witted American had filled
its inside with quail shot. But, for all that,
it is not so big as an ox. Were it not for its
overweening self-complacency, and its ex-
aggerated pretensions, no exception could be
taken to the lively little animal. As frogs
go, it is a credit to its species. And,
as colonial dependencies go, Nomansland
is a flourishing and progressive colony.
Nevertheless, it is not Great Britain.
Now, what is true of Nomansland is equally
true of other colonies?possibly, in some de-
gree, of our own. All young countries have
what may be termed a tumid tendency,
which is a very unhealthy symptom. They
resemble the immortal hero of a well known
nursery story. Providence having presented
them with a Christmas pie of noble dimen.
sions and savoury material, each of them
falls to pulling out the plums, and exclaiming,
? What a good boy ami!? I don?t wish to
detract one iota from the moral worth of
Master Horner, but I think that young gen-
tleman would have been much more esti-
mable if he bad been a little less boastful.
Depend upon it, that the man or boy, nation
or community, which is perpetually vaunting
his or its own greatness and goodness, is defi-
cient in some of the vital elements of both,
and is destitute of genuine self-respect. You
will remember, at the commencement of the
civil war in America, how loud and confident
were the boastings of the Northerners that
they would ? chaw up? the rebellion in ninety
days, and how numerous and severe were the
reverses they sustained. After a time this


vain-glorious talk was abandoned, and they Maories of New Zealand ? As the world grows
gathered up all their strength for a pro-
tracted struggle, which was brought to a suc-
cessful issue at the end of four years, under
the leadership of Ulysses the Silent. ? Brag ?
may have been, as the proverb says, a good
dog, though I think he is at all times a con-
temptible cur?but ?Holdfast was a better.?
Let us look our faults fairly in the face, and
endeavour to correct them. We boast of our
material progress and political freedom, and
are prone to consider these as our own handi-
work exclusively. But to what extent does
the credit of them belong to us ? In produc-
ing the sum of human wealth, two great co-
efficients have to be taken into account?the
gratuitous utilities of nature, and the skill
and industry of man. The first of these
we enjoy in wonderful variety and measure-
less abundance. The soil, the climate, and
the mineral resources of Victoria are factors
of material prosperity, for which we cannot
be sufficiently grateful, and they co-operate
with us to a degree which we inadequately ac-
knowledge. They are God?s gifts, and we can
claim no share in their creation. Their de-
velopment and usufruct alone are ours. Next
comes our own contribution to the work. I
have no intention of disparaging it. I am
proud, as every Englishman must be, of the
genius, the enterprise, the inventive ingenuity,
and the vehement industry of my country-
men. But I cannot forbear asking myself?
How much of the skill and ability the me-
chanical appliances, and powerful auxiliaries
which arm industry with such irresistible forces,
and render it so productive in our genera-
tion, is inherited and derived from the gene-
rations which preceded it ? Our forefathers,
and not only our forefathers but inventive
men in every age and country, have be-
queathed to us the magnificent estate of their
ideas and discoveries. Some portion of the
bequest is centuries old; another portion
may have been devised to us by the inventor
who died yesterday, or last week, or a year
ago. The screw which propels our steam
vessels was the legacy to mankind of a philo-
sopher of Syracuse, who flourished more than
2,000 years ago. To him, also, we owe the
crane, the pulley, and the lever. But why
should I multiply instances of our indebted-
ness to those who have gone before us ? Take
from us this incalculably precious inheritance,
and wherein should we be superior to the
older, and man?s capacity to utilise the forces
of nature increases in extent and power, his
own share in the work, and consequently
the credit due to him for what he does, di-
minishes from day to day and year to year, so
that there is a profound?indeed, one may say,
a pathetic?truth in Tennyson?s assertion that
? the individual withers, and the world is more
and more.? It may be mortifying to our self-
love that it should be so, but the hard, un-
alterable fact remains. Every addition to
the sum of our capacities, comforts, and en-
joyments, involves a corresponding addition
to the sum of our indebtedness to those who
have gone before us. We shine with a bor-
rowed lustre, and are sumptuous in trappings
which were bequeathed us by the dead. The
fabric of our greatness is erected, like the
coral islands of the Pacific, upon the remains
of millions of animated beings who have pre-
ceded us ; and we may apply to the whole
human race?although in a different sense to
that which was intended by the poet?the
observation?
? That men may rise on stepping stones
Of their dead selves, to higher things.?
And if we attentively examine the title-deeds
by which we hold our political franchises, we
shall find that they bear the endorsement of
names which the whole world holds in venera-
tion?patriots and philosophers of all ages
and of all countries ; that the true principles
of political science were as well understood
in the days of Plato and Aristotle as in
those of Bentham and Brougham; and
that the liberty we prize is, in a much greater
degree, an inheritance than a conquest.
Considerations of this kind should moderate,
I think, that spirit of arrogant self-assertion
which is the reproach of young communities,
end that everlasting ? cock-a-doodle-doo,?
and clapping of wings, which we nineteenth
century people are everywhere setting up over
our acquisitions and performances. The
foremost ripple on the sea-beach, as it breaks
into creamy foam upon the glistening shingle
and traces a sinuous furrow on the plastic
sand, might as well claim to be the highest
embodiment and grandest product of the vast
ocean by which its movements are impelled,
as we might plume ourselves upon our pre
eminence, simply because we happen to
? foremost in the ranks of time.? It is
old story of the wren mounted upon


eagle?s crest. The smaller bird soared higher houses like that of Overend, Gurney, and
and saw further than the king of the air ;
but it was upon the strong pinions of the
latter that the former was borne aloft. In
like manner the vantage ground which we
occupy was raised for us by the labour of our
forerunners. One of the consequences of this
overweening self-complacency is, that it in-
duces us to form erroneous estimates of his-
tory, and to pronounce unjust censures upon
the various states of society and forms of go-
vernment through which mankind has passed,
and out of which it has emerged into the light
of what is possibly a brighter day. A youth?
for in all probability the world is only in
its youth, with the down of early manhood
scarcely visible upon its upper lip?-might as
reasonably despise himself for ever having
been a child, as we disparage and contemn
phases of civilisation and forms of polity and
conditions of social existence which were the
natural growth or reflection of, and were
strictly appropriate to the circumstances, the
wants, the nabits, and the general intelligence
or ww-intelligence of times gone by. It is not
my intention, nor does it fall within the
scope of my lecture, to institute any com-
parison between what we are accustomed to
call the dark ages and our own epoch of
moral, mental, and spiritual enlightenment.
I am not absolutely certain that we are so
much wiser, better, and happier than our
forefathers as ?to justify us in speaking of
them .either with Pharisaical contempt or
Christian compassion. I cannot discover that
crime, vice, destitution, and disease, war,
pestilence, and famine were the special cha-
racteristics of any epoch, or have been entirely
banished from our owxr. When lam tempted
to pick up an objurgatory stone, and hurl
it at the wicked people who flourished cen-
turies ago in Europe, I pause for a moment
to reflect upon the baby-farms in the manu-
facturing districts of England, upon the ele-
vation of foeticide and other nameless hor-
rors into a distinct and lucrative profession
in New York and other American cities, upon
Mormonism, spiritualism, and free love, upon
the hundreds of thousands who perished by
famine the other day at Orissa, upon the
assassinations and explosions at Sheffield,
upon the awful carnage at Sadowa, upon the
re-establishment of Qcsarisrn in Prance,
upon the stupendous frauds perpetrated by
rings? in the United States and by great
Co. in the mother country; and upon the
terrible increase of insanity in Europe and
America, and I drop the stone with as
much precipitation as may be. Never-
theless, mankind may be better, wiser,
and happier, as it is undoubtedly richer, than
it was; and he can alwajs count on praise
and popularity who asseverates that it is so.
We will not stop to argue the point, but will
accept it as proved. Being so much wiser
than our predecessors, we can afford to pass
a lenient judgment upon their institutions
and their actions; as it is most fitting
we should study them in a philosophical
spirit. And bringing to their investigation
this spirit, and pursuing it without pre-
judice, what is the conclusion we arrive at?
I dare say many of those whom I have the
honour to address have been familiar either
in Europe or Australia with the magnificent
spectacle of the sunrise in a mountainous dis-
trict. They have seen the golden light smiting
the splintered crags and snowy peaks until
they seemed to stand transfigured in its stain-
less lustre. They have watched the warm
glow creeping down the mountain side, robing
its massive shoulders with a garment of
luminous beauty, penetrating dark rifts and
sombre chasms with its swift effulgence, and
droppin shafts of vivid radiance in amon '
the forest trees. In a little while the morning
sunshine has enveloped all the mountain and
flooded all the valley with its fervid glory and
its animating warmth ; and every object which
looked so wan and indistinct in the cold grey
light of early dawn, takes colour, form, and
shapeliness, from the all-beholding, all-
embracing light of cheerful day. Somewhat
similar have been the dawn of knowledge and
the incidence of political power. When
modern civilisation was in its infancy, it was?
in the first instance ?only upon the regal
eminences of society that the light of intel-
ligence was seen to rest and irrespon-
sible authority was permitted to devolve.
Uoth extended, in process of time, to the en-
nobled classes and the ecclesiastics Ana let it
be remembered, to the credit of the Church
of Rome, that, even then, it asserted the
equality of all men in the sight of God ; and
-in direct opposition to the aristocratic and
exclusive spirit of the governing classes-ac-
knowledged no hereditary distinctions within
its own pale, but adopted the elective pi in-


ciple with respect to some of its highest dig- illustrious of our English statesmen?have
nities and grandest offices, and did not
debar the meanest serf in Christendom from
ascending the Papal throne itself, provided he
possessed the capacity to rise and rule.
Eventually the trading classes in the great
cities, acquiring wealth and intelligence in the
pursuits of commerce, established their claims
to certain immunities and to some degree of
political influence; and then, as education
diffused itself through all grades of society,
the rights and privileges of citizenship were
gradually conceded to the whole body, and
thus we have reached the epoch of democracy
in modern Europe, and in English speaking
communities all over the world, to which we
now find ourselves brought. But, occupying
this novel stand-point, does it become us
to speak superciliously of the past ?
Looking at the state of society in the
middle ages, I think it is very doubt-
ful whether a better system could have been
devised for it than feudalism. Feudalism
would be intolerable now ; but feudalism was
well adapted to a period in which the masses
were ignorant, weak, superstitious, and de-
pendent ; and art, science, statesmanship,
and letters were the possession of an exclusive
few?it was exceedingly suitable to a rude and
warlike epoch, in which the governing classes
could offer substantial protection to the pro-
letariat, in which the Church was strong
enough to curb the licence of the Crown,.and
the monastery was the spiritual instructor,
the moral teacher, the doctor, the 'almsgiver,
and the protector of the poor, ?If,? as
Ruskin observes, ? the middle ages had their
wars and agonies, they had also intense de-
lights. Their gold was dashed with blood;
but ours is , sprinkled with dust. Their life
was interwoven with white and purple;
ours is one seamless stuff of brown.?
That monarchs misused their power, that
aristocracies did the same, that abuses and
corruptions crept into the church, and that
mixed forms of government have been be-
trayed into follies and crimes, is only tanta-
mount to saying that human beings in every
grade of life, in every age and country, and
under every kind of political institution,
are human beings still, and that, with
rare exceptions, the exercise of power tends
to the demoralisation of its possessor;
although this is true to a limited
tent only of men who?like the more
been born or educated to it. The worst
of tyrants is a parvenu. Only a pure
heart and an incorruptible and well-
balanced mind?calm, just, and passion-
less, like George Washington?s?are proof
against its terrible temptations. As I have
said, we have now reached that stage in the
political development of civilised mankind
in which the equality of all men before the
law has been finally, and I trust irrevocably,
established ; and it behoves us, instead of
casting contemptuous or commiserating
glances upon the past, and pluming ourselves
upon our superior enlightenment and sur-
prising attainments, to examine the dangers
by which we are surrounded, in what I must
venture to call our superficial and one-sided
civilisation. Nor could I name one which
appears to me to be more alarming than that
deification of material prosperity and that
sordid worship of success which is rapidly
supplanting all other forms of faith, and con-
ducting us to a species of idolatry, compared
with which, the belief of ?the Pagan, suckled
in some creed outworn,? or of
?the poor Indian, whose untutored mind
Sees God in clouds and hears him In the wind,?
is piety and poetry itself. Look, for instance,
at the ordinary method of estimating and de-
scribing the condition and progress of any
country?of our own, letussay. Somanyounces
of gold produced, so many million pounds of
wool exported, so many thousand gallons of
gin, rum, and brandy taken out of bond, so
much money lying to the credit of so
many depositors in savings banks, so
much merchandise consumed, and so forth.
Now, let me guard myself against being sup-
posed to disparage industry and frugality, or
to undervalue the rational enjoyment of the
fruits of both, I hold activity of mind and
body to be one of the most efficacious pro-
moters of human happiness, and I speak
from the experience of my own life, which
has been both a busy and a happy one, when
I say that industry is essential to bodily and
mental health. What I wish to convey is
this?that we ought to apply quite other tests
to the welfare and advancement of a people
than those which are commonly made use of.
Instead of searching for them in the Customs
Bill of Entry, or in that lively and entertain-
ing publication called the Journal of Com-
merce, I think we should seek them in


satisfactory answers to questions like earth,? as you will remember they have been
the following :?Are your schools full, and
your prisons empty ? Have the doors of your
courts of justice grown rusty on their hinges
from sheer disuse, and are your laws so few
in number that a little volume will contain
them all? Is a drunkard as much a
phenomenon in your streets, and as loath-
some in the public estimation, as a leper ? Is
the practice of any vice considered to be a
prima facie evidence of insanity? Is the
word of every man, in all the transactions of
daily life, as valid as his signature to a con-
tract or a bill of exchange, and is the crime
of perjury unknown? Is idleness reputed
infamous, and slander an abomination
Have pauperism and mendicity been reduced
to their minimum, and are life and property
as secure as they were when a daughter of
Erin, with a ?bright gold ring on her wand,?
travelled from one end of Ireland to the
other,
? And her maiden smile
In safety lighted her round the Green Isle.?
Would it be impossible to discover an adul-
terated article of food, or clothing, or utility,
of any kind, throughout the length and
breadth of the land ? And is justice the
supreme guide and regulating principle of
conduct among the whole community ? Now,
I think it is a painful proof that we are really,
as yet, in a very rudimentary stage of civili-
sation, and have advanced but a moderate
distance along the path of progress, that
the propounding of questions like these
would inevitably subject the propounder
to the imputation of being a dreamer,
and a visionary, if not a lunatic ; and that
the condition of society to which they point
is one which would be characterised by ninety-
nine people out of a hundred as Utopian in
the highest degree. Yet no one will be bold
enough to assert that upon any other than
the moral basis just indicated would it be
possible to construct a society which should
be Christian in deed as well as in name, in
sentiment as well as in profession ; and which
should endure as long as the human race en-
dures. Wanting this moral basis, every
great nation of antiquity has perished ; as
I will venture to assert, every great nation of
modern times will likewise perish, when
there is no longer a sufficiency of public and
private virtue to be found in the minority of
good men and women??the salt of the
called?to preserve the whole mass of society
from corruption and decay. This is no fan-
ciful speculation, or presumptuous pre-
diction of my own. It is a logical
deduction from the lessons of history,
and from the undeniable existence and in-
cessant operation of that moral law which is
written in our consciences, and every violation
of which, whether by individuals or nations,
is visited with its appropriate and unavoid-
able penalty. Seeing, then, that we are so
far from that stage of human progress,
towards which I hope and believe mankind is
slowly moving, it seems to me that we cannot
too steadily discourage, or too sternly re-
press those tumid tendencies, and that
disposition to look up to ourselves, and
to look down upon our forefathers,
upon which I have already animadverted.
It may be argued that we are young, and that
conceit and braggadocio are as natural to
youthful communities as they are to a good
many young people ; but such an argument is
scarcely tenable. We are a fragment chipped
off an old nation?a branch layered from an
old stock in a new soil?a portion of an
ancient edifice transferred to and re-erected
upon a fresh site, in conformity with the
general plan of the original structure. There-
fore the plea of youth is inadmissible in ex-
tenuation of the faults I have enlarged
upon. And these faults should be rigorously
discoutenanced, I think, because they are
hostile to real progress and incompatible with
true greatness. I do not think you will ever
find this dissociated from modesty. The vain
man?the man who is always sounding his
own trumpet, and perpetually absorbed in the
calculation and admiration of his own per-
sonal, moral, or mental qualifications?is
almost invariably as weak and shallow as he
is offensive and contemptible. The genuinely
great man may or may not be conscious of
the possession of distinguished gifts, but, in
any case, he bears himself as meekly as King
Duncan, as Michael Angelo, as Sir Isaac
Newton. And this holds true, I think, of
nations. There was a military commander
in the early part of the present century,
who, occupying a conquered country, at the
head of a fine army, officered by splendid
generals, arrogantly declared that he would
drive the opposing army -which was inferior
in numbers, in service and equ ; pment?into


the sea. That opposing army was led by aof them there is neither grandeur nor at-
man from whose lips no boast was ever beard
to fall. He was the servant of a nation which
is proverbially reticent and taciturn. He
possessed his soul in modesty and patience ;
and, in course of time, instead of being driven
into the sea, he himself swept the country of
its invaders, and drove them, defeated and
dejected, across the Pyrenees. He never in-
dulged in rhetorical flourishes about glory
and victory never wrote bombastic and
mendacious bulletins?never told his soldiers
that forty centuries were looking down upon
them from the Pyramids of Egypt, nor talked
grandiloquent rhodomontade of that kind,
?he would not brag, and he could not lie
? For this was England?s greatest son,
He that gain?d a hundred fights,
Nor ever lost an English gun.?
The magniloquent boaster suffered igno-
minious defeat, and died in exile; while his
antagonist?
? Great in council and great in war.
Foremost captain of his time,
And, as the greatest only are,
In his simplicity sublime
lived to a ripe old age, accompanied by
?love, honour, obedience, and troops of
friends,? and went down to an honoured
grave amidst ?an empire?s lamentation.?
Now, I suppose, it will be scarcely disputed
that it is better for a people to be modest and
abstinent from boasting, like Wellington,
than to be vain, arrogant, and gasconading
like Napoleon. There results, from the imi-
tation of the frog in the fable, that spirit of
provincialism in politics, art, letters, and
social life, which Poole has so pleasantly
satirised in ?Little Pedlington.? A fond
attachment to the land of our birth, or the
land of our adoption?to the neighbourhood
in which the best years of our life have
been spent, or to the particular circle in
which we prefer to move?is a natural sen-
timent. Most of us have felt?
? As in a pensive dream
When all our active powers were still.
A distant dearness in the hill,
A secret sweetness in the stream,
The limit of our narrower fate,
While yet beside its vocal springs
We played at counsellors and kings
With one who was our earliest mate.?
But the belief that these countries or neigh-
bourhoods excel all others, and that outside
tractiveness, neither excellence nor beauty, is
quite another thing; is, in fact, a very
mischievous and misleading delusion, almost
as much so as the notion that what is alien
must be necessarily hostile ; and that what is
unknown, because foreign or remote, must be
therefore undesirable to know, if not actually
eligible for aversion. The spirit of provin-
cialism is a debasing and demoralising spirit.
It dwarfs a man?s intellect, narrows the range
of his sympathies, and obstructs the full
development of his nature. It disintegrates
mankind ?breaks it up into little communi-
ties, sects, coteries, and cliques ; and is wholly
opposed to the Gospel of Christ and the
gospel of humanity. Show me a village,
town, or district in which the spirit of pro-
vincialism is particularly rampant, and I
will show you a hotbed of calumny and
slander?a field for the display of little fac-
tions and petty animosities?an arena for the
exercise of envy, hatred, malice, and all un-
charitableness?a place in which the inhabi-
tants dissipate no small proportion of their
energies in foolish litigation, in rancorous
quarrels, and perpetual backbiting. That
was a magnificent illustration of pro-
vincialism which Leech once depicted in
Punch: ??Who?s ?im, Bill?? ?A stranger.?
? ?Eave ?arf a brick at ?im.? How
many of the wars of modern Europe are in-
directly traceable to the rivalries, jealousies,
and prejudices of provincialism?to a feeling,
in short, like that which prompted the
Staffordshire man to ? ?eave ?arf a brick? at
the stranger. If you will just reflect for a
moment upon the sanguinary quarrels which
sprang up between one and another of the
petty kingdoms into which England was
formerly divided, you will find it impossible
to avoid being struck by their ludicrous ab-
surdity. It is as if the president of the
road board of Boroondara should organise
the able-bodied men of that sylvan dis-
trict for the purpose of making a raid
upon ?the wild wood-carters of Nunawading
harrying their cattle, destroying their crops,
emptying the bars of the bush inns of a good
deal of indifferent brandy without offering
to pay the reckoning, and burning down the
homesteads of the Forty-second Regiment of
bond fide settlers. Between such a war,
whether carried on in ancient Wessex or in
modern Nunawading, and the wars of Euro-


pean states, the difference is one of degree titled to send to Congress. Here is a really
only. Common sense, self-interest, huma-
nity, and the Christian religion if the
Christian religion may be mentioned without
impropriety in these days when everybody
doubts everything but his own omniscience?
all concur in condemning such wars. For, to
put the matter upon the lowest possible
grounds, any merchant or shopkeeper will
admit that the very worst use to which you
can put a profitable customer is to impale
him on a bayonet, or to bore holes through
his body with conical bullets. But this is
precisely what nations do when they fall out
and come to loggerheads ; and what it costs
them to destroy their neighbours and cus-
tomers defies all calculation, and would? if it
could be accurately estimated ?stagger belief.
That a time will come when the story of
the desolating and mutually destructive
wars which have taken place between neigh-
bouring nations will be read with mingled
feelings of incredulity and pity by our wiser
posterity, I no more doubt than I doubt that
the sun will rise with his accustomed punc-
tuality to-morrow morning; but before it
can be confidently asserted that ? the war
drum throbs no longer and the battle flag is
furled, ? the spirit of provincialism will have
to die out, and frogs will have to acquiesce
in that law of nature which confers supe-
rior dimensions and a lustier voice upon their
bovine associates in the succulent pastures.
And this leads me to speak of the political
institutions of the future. If those which
exist in the most advanced nations of the
earth were the final outcome of democracy?
or if democracy were the goal of humanity,
instead of being, as I hold that it is, a mere
stage of growth, a phase of development,
and a transitional form of government?we
might be tempted to despair of the future of
mankind. Let us look at America, for
example. Now, I think it must be acknow-
ledged that, in theory at least, and regard
being had to the popular notions on the sub-
ject, the Constitution of the United States is as
near perfection as possible. The popular
branch of the Legislature is chosen by the
People; the Senate is elected by the Legisla-
tures of the various states, and the President
is appointed by a species of electoral college,
composed of a number of electors from each
state equal to the whole number of senators
and representatives which such state is en-
model constitution, framed by men of rare
politic? I ability, who were actuated by the
loftiest patriotism; but has it secured the
ends for which all governments are ordained ?
Has it, in the language of the preamble,
? established justice, insured domestic tran-
quillity, and promoted the general welfare ??
I find it stated in the North American Review
for July, 1867, that justice is
bought and sold, and that the corruption
which prevails is without a para?Tel in the
judicial annals of any country. ?The most
shameful offences are constantly committed
by men placed upon the bench by the popular
vote. They listen privately to one or other of
the suitors in a case which is afterwards to be
brou ht before them, and openly take bribes
for their decisions. It is weT known that
one received 10,000 dollars for giving
jud ment in a case, and he still re-
mains upon the bench.? In the stat>
of New York, a l l the judges are
elected, and their appointment is in the
hands of the pickpockets, the prize-fi -liters,
the immigrant touters, the pimps, and the
lowest class of liquor dealers. And what is
the result ? I quote from an official docu-
ment?the report of the commissioners of
police for the year 1865 ?In no other city
does the machinery of criminal justice so
signally fail to restrain or punish serious and
capital offences As our laws and
institutions are administered, they do not
afford adequate protection to i; fe and pro-
perty. Some remedy must be found and
applied, or life in the metropolis will
drift rapidly towards the condition of
barbarism.? Only a few days ago, I
took up the New York Herald for the
7th of April last, and in that one issue I
found reports of no less than twelve mur-
ders, one of them being the assassination of
a judge ; together with the particulars of two
robberies?a burglary in South-street, New
York, where the thieves had carried off
100,000 dollars? worth of stock and shares ?
and another in Philadelphia, where the booty
in bonds and greenbacks amounted to a
million dollars. If we turn to the conduct of
political affairs, we find ourselves confronted
by corruption and peculation on all sides.
An influential member of the Senate has
stated?and the statement has never been
contradicted?that upon the article of whiskey


alone twenty millions sterling are collected
which never find their way into the Trea-
sury, but are stolen by the officials. The
estimated expenses of the two Houses of
Congress for the year 1868 were set down at
�1,060,000 sterling, of which more than three-
fifths are absorbed by the Lower House. At
one time its members were supplied with sta-
tionery ad libitum, but they carried off such
large quantities, besides franking their dirty
linen to their own homes by the Government
mails, that it was found necessary to compro-
mise the matter by allowing each member
�25 per annum to find himself in pens, ink,
and paper. Among the items on the Esti-
mates for the House of Representatives I find
�2BO for combs, brushes, and soap; but even
these articles disappear in a most rapid and
mysterious manner, and many members com-
plained, at the close of the last session of
Congress, that they had not received a comb,
a brush, or so much as a piece of soap during
the whole session. And considering the very
dirty work in which some of them must
have been engaged, a scarcity of soap
must have been a terrible privation.
The corruption of numerous members of Con-
gress is a matter of common notoriety ; and,
as regards the State Legislature of New York,
it has been openly asserted, and never denied,
that as many as 118 out of the 160 members
of which it is composed habitually sell their
votes to the highest bidder, and not unfre-
quently take money on both sides. It was
only in the month of April last that one
of these venal scoundrels, on returning by
rail from Albany to Troy, accidentally
left his pocketbook on the seat of the car-
riage. A brakeman found and opened it, and
discovered l,Boodol. in bills, besides some
papers which gave him a clue to the owner.
While the train was stopping, the brakeman
went in search of and found the owner, who
promptly rewarded him with twenty dollars.
As the brakeman turned to go away, however,
the legislator stopped him, took him on one
side, and whispered in his ear words to this
effect, ?When you get up to our place to-
morrow you needn?t say anything about
my losing my pocketbook. You see, they
wouldn?t know how I came by that
l,Boodol. exactly: in fact, I don?t think I
ever had so much money with me before ;
so you had better say nothing about it.?
It may be asked how it is that with so much
profligacy, rapacity, and corruption among
the representatives of the people in Congress
and in the State Legislatures, the American
cabinet should be composed, as it generally is,
of men distinguished for their ability and
probity ? The answer is to be found in the
fact that the President appoints his own
Ministers subject to the formal confirmation
of their appointments by the Senate ; and
thus the members of the Cabinet are
relieved from the humiliating neces-
sity of purchasing a precarious exist-
ence by trafficking departmental favours
for legislative votes. Removed from the sphere
of party conflict and of party intrigue in Con-
gress, they can give their undivided attention
to their administrative duties and to the pre-
paration of necessary laws. Reverting, how-
ever, to the subject of corruption, let us look
at the state of affairs in the ?empire city? of
the Union. The New York Tribune asserts
that an alderman who could rob the city of
�20,000, and squander half of it on the
? ? boys? who nominated and elected him,
would be regarded by the majority as a
smart clever fellow, and would probably have
an increased majority at the next election.
The municipal government of New York,
which raises a revenue of eight millions ster-
ling, is virtually in the hands of seven men.
They and their nominees, during the last
sixteen years?l quote from the North Ameri-
can Review for October last ??have stolen
not less than fifty millions of dollars, and not
one of them has ever been punished, nor even
made to disgorge.? The price of a vote in
the corporation of New York?l may add?
ranges from fifty to five hundred dollars, ac-
cording to circumstances. Finally, we arrive
at that other object for which governments
are instituted?namely, the general welfare of
the people. Now, the material prosperity
of the United States, taken as a whole,
is undeniable, but to what agencies is that
prosperity attributable? Upon this subject
let us consult an American authority, Mr.
David Wells, the special commissioner of
internal revenue, whose dictum carries con-
viction with it. He says These agencies
are mainly two?first, great natural re-
sources in respect to abundant and fertile
territory, great natural facilities for inter-
communication, abundant and cheap raw
material, and diversity without insalubrity of
climate ; and, secondly, a form and spirit of


government which heretofore has left man
and capital, over an area almost continental,
free and unrestrained, to work out their
own development.? In other words, in-
dustry flourished so long as the Go-
vernment let it alone. But when the
American Government is called upon to deal
with some of the problems which perplex the
statesmen of Europe, it proves to be unequal
to the task. In the United States, as in Eng-
land, the concentration of population pro-
duces an amount of crime and destitution
which the authorities are impotent to grapple
with. There are 52,000 paupers in the receipt
of outdoor relief in New York, 1,500 profes-
sional thieves, 25,000 women of the town,
and 15,000 of the dangerous classes; and
the condition of some thousands of needle-
women is no better than that of their
sisters, the white slaves of London,
?Murders,? says a recent number of tbe New
York Sun, ? are a daily crop. Dear friends
will in the morning go out to business, and
are brought home mutilated corpses. Old
men go out to sweep the pavement, and be
cut to pieces with knives. Gentlemen, sitting
quietly in their own rooms, awaiting com-
pany, are seized, bound, gagged, robbed, and
threatened with a bullet if they resist. Nay,
we have every reason to believe that some re-
creant members of the police force itself are
in league with the thieves, murderers, as-
sasins, and housebreakers. Vigilance com-
mittees are being formed in town and
country, and it is this alarming riot of crime
that has driven good citizens to this last
resort of desperation.? Tosumallup, ?Mr.
Horace Greeley estimated last January that
there were half a million persons within sight
of the city steeples of New York who were
hungry, destitute, and out of work.? But
New York, it may be objected, is the channel
through which flows the enormous stream of
immigration from Europe, and in that city
are deposited both the scum and the
sediment of that stream, of which the clear
and wholesome elements flow westward.
There is much force in the objection,
so let us shift the scene for a moment.
In the queen of the New England states,
Massachusetts?which has the ?modern
Athens ? for its capital?one person in every
twenty-two is a pauper. With a population of
1,250,000 there are upwards of 57,000 destitute
persons in the state, while there are between
10,000 and 11,000 prisoners, 2,500 inmates o
the lunatic asylums, and 1,600 pupils in the
reformatories, besides 5,000 deaf, dumb, blind,
and otherwise dependent human creatures.
In short, this is the picture of New England,
presented in a state document; laid before the
Senate in January last?A helpless crowd
of workers, the oppression of low wages, in-
evitable poverty, and a disguised serfdom ;
a rich master, a poor servant, and a mean
population.? Thus, then, you will perceive
that democratic institutions do not neces-
sarily ?establish justice, insure domestic
tranquillity, and promote the general wel-
fare and for these reasons I believe that
this principle of government will be no less
transitory than feudalism was. Let us en-
deavour, for the better understanding of this
important question, to survey it as the in-
habitant of another planet might do.
? These men,? he would say, ?in their
individual capacities, profess to be go-
verned by their reason. That is the law
of their lives, and in proportion as the
will of each person is subordinated to
enlightened judgment and moral principle (
will the conduct of that man be just, wise,
temperate, and prosperous. Yet, when they
come to act in a collective capacity as states,
what do these terrestrials do? They make
the representative bodies, which, as law-
givers and as administrators, have to fulfil
the same functions as conscience and reason
discharge in man, the image and expression
?of what ? Of the collective reason of the
people in its most dispassionate mood??of
its moral sense??of its weightiest expe-
rience and deepest sagacity??of the calmest
judgment of the ablest, the soundest, the
most discriminating and the most far-sighted
thinkers? No such thing. These representa-
tive bodies merely reflect the popular will ;
so that it has come to pass in one of
the foremost nations of Europe?in France,
to wit?the intelligence and moral prin.
ciple of the people are almost wholly un-
represented-are, in fact, hostile to and pro-
scribed by the Government of the day. And,
to make matters worse, these terrestrials, as
often as they have occasion to renew their
representative bodies, contrive to do so under
circumstances so exciting as to prohibit the
exercise of reflection and deliberation. In
all countries possessing Parliamentary go-
vernment, no party thinks of going to tho


hustings without what is called ?a good
cry.? Instead of a principle, they are invited
to swear by a phrase?a catch-word ?a shibbo-
leth. Party zeal, personal predilections or pre-
judices, national animosities, and religious
fanaticism, are all inflamed at the very mo-
ment when men are called upon to make a
calm and circumspect choice of enlightened
and disinterested legislators and administra-
tors. Verily, these terrestrials are strange
beings.? Now, this is how an ultra-mundane
critic would deliver himself, I fancy, with
respect to our method of managing our politi-
cal affairs, and we could not find much fault
with his strictures. But are we to be for ever
amenable to such a reproach? Will our in-
stitutions be the institutions of after genera-
tions ? If progress be the law of humanity,
we may unhesitatingly answer, ?No.? That
society must continue to rest upon a
democratic basis, and that the equa-
lity of all men before the law is a
sacred and eternal principle, I firmly
believe ; but I am also convinced that power
in the good time which is coming will find a
new depositary, a more satisfactory and en-
during resting-place. It is unfortunate for
the discussion of subjects like these that the
technical language we employ has lost its
original meaning, and has acquired improper
and perverted significations. Thus, the word
? aristocracy? has come to be confounded
with a privileged class?with an hereditary
caste ; whereas it really implies the best men
of a country, without respect to birth, or
wealth, or station. And such an aristocracy
I take to be the natural and rightful rulers
of a country. These were the rulers of
America when its Washingtons, its Hamil-
tons, its Madisons, its Jeffersons, and its
Quincy Adamses were at the head of its
affairs; and these will constitute the go-
vernments of the future in all English-
speaking countries when the moral and
intellectual elevation of the masses shall
have qualified them to make a prudent
and sagacious choice of rulers. That choice
will most assuredly fall upon the aristoi
of a nation. Whatever is most eminent
in moral worth?in disinterestedness and
purity of purpose ?in unselfish and self-sacri-
ficing devotion to the public interests ?in
splendid ability, shaped, directed, and
controlled by a lofty and incorrup-
tible integrity?a clear discernment and
a steadfast pursuit of the right?that will
the people honour and obey. But before this
comes to pass, the intelligence and the moral
sentiments of mankind?its instinctive sense
of justice and its fidelity to truth?must and
will have reached that high point of develop-
ment at which little will be left for Presi-
dents or Cabinets to do. When public virtue
attains its maximum, the power of Govern-
ments will fall to zero. The best code
of laws is that which is written in a
cultivated and healthily active conscience ;
and when every man carries such a code
about with him, and habitually defers to its
authority, mankind will be able to make a
bonfire of its statute books, though centuries
may elapse before the arrival of this golden
age, when men will be too just to require
lawyers, and too healthy to need doctors.
The best government, it has been said, is
that which governs least; and as all govern-
ments exist by the surrender of a portion of
our liberties for the better protection and
preservation of what remains, we shall be
wise to part with as few of them as we can,
consistently with the maintenance of law and
order, and to restrict the functions of govern-
ments within the narrowest possible limits ;
above all, we must regard with a jealous eye
everything in the shape of privilege. The
first great assertion of democracy as a po-
litical force in modern Europe was
when in 1789 it arose in its wrath
and smote down privilege in France,
and privilege?that is to say, a private and
particular law conferring special powers and
immunities upon a class or body?is just as
liable to be wrested to tyrannous uses by a
parliament as by a nobility or sovereign.
Privilege and democracy cannot co-exist;
they are a contradiction in terms. And
?Parliamentary privilege in a democracy,?
as was once remarked to me by the late Ebe-
nezer Syme ?one of the ablest and sin-
cerest champions of democracy I ever
knew??is only arbitrary power mask-
ing its features in a cap of liberty.?
Finally, although the epoch at which the true
aristoi of a country will govern its affairs
is distant, it is not to be despaired of ; and I
ground my expectation of a brighter chapter
in human history upon what may at first
sight appear to be a paradox, but which,
upon closer examination, will prove to be an
axiomatic truth. It is this?Morality is


identical with enlightened selfishness. To
be just, truthful, diligent, prudent, and
temperate, is to be healthy, happy, and
prosperous. Like many other truths, this
is one which is but slowly apprehended
by the mass of mankind; but we must not
be impatient of results, remembering that,
in the lifetime of our race, a thousand
years are but as a day in the lifetime of a
man. Each of us may do something to
accelerate the arrival of this desirable state
of things; and no person, howsoever in-
significant, can rightly estimate the value
of his own example or foresee the extent of
his individual influence, for good or for evil.
The hope of every generation, and the
promise of the future, are enclosed in its
young men and women. To them is en-
trusted the honourable and responsible duty
of bearing aloft, and carrying forward, the
torch of progress. In a few years the
political and municipal government of this
colony will fall?as it ought to fall ?into the
hands �f those who have been bom in the
colony, or who came hither in their childhood.
We who immigrated hither in the prime of
life are more or less conscious of ?adivided
duty.? We have been transplanted, and are
not like the Anglo-Australians proper?
?native and to the manner born.? We
cannot altogether forget the old country, nor
obliterate from our hearts and minds old
affections and old associations. Not so, how-
ever, our children. All their recollections
and aspirations will centre here. Here
will be found the past to which their
memories will revert, and the future
to which their hopes will be directed.
Theirs will be the opportunity, as, I trust,
theirs will be the honourable ambition, to
build up the stately fabric of a common-
wealth which will renew and perpetuate in
this southern land the greatness and renown
of that illustrious parent state,
? Whose deep foundations lie
In veneration and the people?s love;
Whose steps are equity, whose seat is law.?
Engaged in this exalted work, let them not
undervalue the lessons of experience, nor be
guilty of the filial ingratitude of despising
the example and defaming the character of
?that sceptred isle, that earth of majesty and
seat of Mars?that precious stone set in the
silver sea,? which Milton loved and Shak-
speare magnified. Hers is a great and
glorious past. Be it yours to create a bene-
ficent and brilliant future for this, almost the
youngest born, of that august and venerable
mother of nations; always maintaining that
sober self-respect and modest dignity which
best befit the children of such a parent, and
always remembering that
? Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control.
These three alone lead life to sovereign power.?

PRE-HISTORIC MAN.
The following lecture, the last of the series
given during the Winter of 1869, in connec-
tion with the Early Closing Association, was
delivered by the Rev. J. E. Bromby, D.D., in
the Princess Theatre, to a large and appre-
ciative audience. Upon the stage were a
number of clergymen and scientific gentlemen,
amongst whom were the following: His Lord-
ship the Bishop of Melbourne (in the chair),
the Revs. M. H. Beecher, H. S. P, Handheld,
J. S, Waugh, I. Moore, S.J., J. Potter, D. Mac-
Donald, Dr. Tucker, Professor M?Coy, Geo.
Foord, Esq., Dr. Barker, E. Gill, Esq. J.P.,
D. O?Donovan, Esq., Dr. Thomson, Captain
Amsinck.
Dr. Bromby said;?
It is my duty this evening, my friends, to
discourse to you for an hour or so on our
fellow-man before be emerges into the light
of history?or man still wandering in the dim
twilight of tradition ; or even in times still
earlier, while the vestiges which tell of his
existence are few and far between?rude im-
plements of stone maybe, or bones which he
has once dined off and then thown aside.
But in this long line of our primaeval ancestry
where must I begin ? Why, of course, many
of you will say, begin with Adam. Adam !
But then you must remember that the Hebrew
word Adam means only man ; nothing more,
and nothing less. And to begin my story of
man by allusions to man, would be very like
reasoning in a circle?the act of the tipsy
cripple, who, having got his wooden leg into a
plug-hole, went on walking round and round
the stump. It is true the Bible translators
have assumed a very arbitrary power in deal-
ing with this word Adam. In the very same
verse, or in consecutive verses, they translate
into man, and they transfer it untranslated ;
hut in the original Hebrew it is just the same.
The first time it occurs in Scripture is in the
Ist chapter of Genesis ??And God said, Let
� s make man in our image, after our like-
ness.? But they might just as well have
written, ? Let us make Adam in our image.?*
All that we can learn from Scripture is that
God created man by a special fiat of his
own. He made him Out of the dust of
the ground, but without showing how the
elements were put together, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life. This,
I say, is all the Bible teaches; it deals
only with the religious aspect of things; its
element of inspiration is concerned only with
the spirit. ? The kingdom of God consisteth
not in meat and drink.? ?Flesh and blood
shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven.?
If anything of science transpires through the
pages of Scripture, it is in light from that far
horizon where science and religion meet??
strange forms looming dimly in grandest out-
line, overwhelming us by their dread and
awe-inspiring shadows, or dazzling us with
the jewelled brightness of the mere skirts of
the Almighty?s clothing. And as with science,
so with history. It is just the same. Holy
writ does not profess to teach us history as
such. Even those parts of Scripture which
usually go by the na me of the historic books
are always classed as part of the prophetic
writings in that threefold division?the Law,
the Prophets, and the Psalms. They are
selections made by the prophets in their sacred
colleges at Bethel and Jericho, from the chro-
nicles of the time, to illustrate God?s dealings
with the world. Would you know more than
this? As for instance, Would you know ? the
rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did,
and the ivory houses which he made, and all
the cities which he built ?? Then they tell
you distinctly that you must go elsewhere for
your information. ? Are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the Kings
of Israel?? i. e., in those public annals
which were kept by the Government recorder.
Take a glance now at the chronology of
Scripture. With what perfect indifference?
does it treat all such accurate calculations,
upon which we are disposed to lay such


immense stress when we reckon up the years nology is as true of every other branch of
and the ages that are passed. We read in
the first chapter of Matthew that there were
fourteen generations between David and the
Captivity, and the individual names in the
pedigree are recorded one by one ; but when
we turn to the Old Testament history, we
find all these name indeed, but discover that
there are three others deliberately left out by
the evangelist, and that, too, for no good
reason that can be assigned. Nor is there any
deception intended in this ; it was simply the
custom of the people, with which inspiration
did not interfere. Examples abound. Take
this; ?Laban is said to be the son of Bethuel,
and Bethuel the son of Nahor, and yet we
find repeatedly that Laban is called the son
of Nahor. It came to the same thing in the
mind of a Hebrew historian. Then, again,
forty years seem to serve for any period of a
man?s life which did not happen to be known
exactly. Isaac married Rebecca when he was
forty years old ; Esau married Judith when
he was forty years old ; Moses visited his
brethren when he was forty years old ;
Israelites dwelt in the wilderness forty years.
At the time of the Judges the land had rest,
twice under Othniel and under Gideon, each
time forty years ; and was under the domina-
tion of the Philistines forty years. Eli judged
Israel just forty years. Saul, David, Solomon,
each reigned just forty years, and many
others; and what is true of forty years is
also true of forty days. In short, it is quite
clear it was a mere habit they had of con-
tenting themselves with a proximate round
number, without caring to be precise.
If, then, chronology is not taught in Scrip-
ture, what shall we say of its history ? In one
respect it is quite as good without the chro-
nology as with it. For spiritual truth does
not depend upon times and seasons ; indeed,
it would appear that in some cases it is
deteriorated by them, for the observance of
these may degenerate into superstition. And
so St. Paul remonstrates with the Galatians,
? Ye observe days and months, and times and
years; I am afraid of you.? But the great
spiritual truth is, that the times of all of us are
in God?s hand. So spake the prophet Daniel
in that magnificent exordium to his interpre-
tation of Belshazzar?s dream?? Blessed be the
name of God for ever and ever; for wisdom
and might are His, and He changeththe times
and the seasons.? And what is true of chro-
human knowledge. We have now long ceased
to fear lest Galileo?s telescope should under-
mine the basis of religion; and though, to
be sure, a similar panic from time to time
returns whenever Science penetrates deeper
into any of the arcana of nature ?as geology
did in the last age, and as everything, from
positivism to protoplasm, does in this?yet
Religion still holds her own, and never did
she number in her ranks more men dis-
tinguished for science and research than she
does at this very moment. In dealing, then,
with the Scriptural account of man?s crea-
tion, while we should always approach the
sacred precincts reverentially, and, in imagi-
nation, put off our shoes from off our feet,
for the place whereon we stand is holy ground,
yet truth demands of us that we should
not keep our eyes hoodwinked, but rather
watch with an almost jealous suspicion lest
the conventional traditions of man might
displace what are really and truly the aver-
ments of the Written Word. Spiritual things
can be discerned only by the spirit within us ;
but intelligible things come within the scope
of the eye of the understanding, and are left
to be made out by our own research.
On opening the Bible, in its earliest chapters,
the first thing that strikes us is that there are
at least two distinct accounts of man?s crea-
tion, just as in opening the New Testament
we see there are four distinct accounts of our
Lord?s ministry and death. And just as, in
the four gospels, where we find discrepancies
in detail?as we do?we infer that such detail
must be immaterial, so ought we to infer the
same in the differing accounts of the crea-
tion.
In the first account of man?s creation,
which concludes with the third verse of the
second chapter of Genesis, the Divine Creator
is called by the simple name of God (E lo-
him). In the second account he is called by
a more august title ?the Lord God (</ehovah
Elohim). The first commences with that
pregnant phrase ?In the beginning,? and
culminates in the statement, ?So God
created man in his own image, in the image
of God created he him ; male and female
created he them.? The second commences
with the customary formula, ? These are the
generations of the heaven and the earth,?
and evinces its fragmentary character by the
circumstance that, although it speaks of the


creation of plants and herbs, it omits all things then corresponded with the far-famed
mention of animals, but records the creation
of man thus, ? The Lord God formed man of
the dust of the ground, and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life.? Some Hebrew
scholars have supposed the passage beginning
with the fifth chapter to be a third record.
It certainly commences with the formula,
? This is the book of the generation of man,?
but, for all that, may be a resumption of the
first document, which had been broken by
the interposition of the second. It speaks of
the creation of man in much the same terms,
but is remarkable for speaking of both sexes
under the same name?man; ?Male and
female created he them, and blessed them,
and called their name Adam ; ? showing that
Adam could not, there at least, be a proper
name.
Before leaving this portion of Scrip-
ture there is one term ?? garden??which
needs a passing notice. It does not mean a
small enclosure planted with flowers, but a
large extensive park. The word which the
Greek translators employed to represent the
Paradise. These paradises were common
enough in the East. They were the parks or
hunting-grounds of the powerful monarchs of
the Babylonish and Persian dynasties. They
contained also choice trees of every kind,
both for ornament and delight. When the
Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity,
they received grants from the Persian mo-
narchs of the privilege to cut down timber in
the royal paradises during the rebuilding of
their city. The meaning of the writer would
therefore be that the place where man com-
menced his existence upon earth was a
natural park of vast extent, where edible
fruits and wild animals abounded. Here
would he find himself in the midst of every
comfort, abundance of nutritious fruit, and
venison to be had for the hunting. And it is
a remarkable fact also, which we may note
in passing, that almost all our fruit trees with
which this day our gardens and orchards are
stocked ?apples, pears, figs, peaches, plums,
vines, nay, even our coffee and our tea all
derive their origin from the East, emanating,
it would appear, from that great garden of
the Lord. While man lived in this delightful
region, he lived in comparative innocence.
He was, at all events, conscious of no sin.
He could do no great wrong, and at first there
would be no great temptation. This state of
golden age, of which nearly every nation
of antiquity held a tradition. This was the
happy legendary period when Oromasdes
reigned in Persia, Osiris in Egypt, Saturn in
Italy, and Ogyges in Greece. I say legendary ;
it could not be historic, for reasons ob-
vious enough; for not only had people not
taught themselves letters, in such uneventful
times there was really no history to write.
It is easy to see how rapidly, under such
circumstances, people would multiply in the
earth, and as people multiplied food would
become proportionately scarce; and now
man, instead of hunting down the sheep as
game, would begin to pasture them in flocks.
These would become his property, his wealth.
The old Latin word for money (pecunia) is an
immediate derivation from pecus, sheep?the
earliest representative of riches. The next
phase, after the nomadic and pastoral, would
be the agricultural In this young country
we have an example of this. The squatter is
driven off the face of the land by the selector,
and thus it comes to pass the words of
Scripture about Abel, the keeper of sheep,
being killed by Cain, the tiller of the ground,
seem almost to bear an allegorical sense, in
addition to their primary one. This it is
which lies at the root of that far-famed
struggle for the Agrarian law which forms
the leading feature of early Roman history,
as soon as ever it emerges from the legendary
period. Now, in order to show how rapidly
Scripture passes over these preliminary stages
of human life, it is but necessary to mention
that Cain, the eldest son of Adam, is repre-
sented as building a city, and calling that
city by the name of his eldest son, Enoch.
Yes! even Cain builds a city?the first man
after Adam.
But some will no doubt be disposed
to remind me of the great length of time
that men then lived, and therefore of
the possibility of men becoming numerous
enough even in two generations to build
cities and live in towns. Let us discuss that
topic next. All the days that Adam lived
were 930 years ; all the days that Enos lived
were 905 years ; and so on till we come down
to the oldest of them, Methuselah, who lived
969 years. Now I have no hesitation in saying
at once that I concur in the suggestion that
these years are nothing but months, and
these are my reasons: ?ln the first place,


the Hebrew word for year, mtp (though not, to be made from one dialect to another. A
indeed, so used elsewhere) will very easily
bear that meaning. Let me show you an
illustration. When we meet with the
word week, we think only of seven days,?
from Sunday morning, it may be, till
Saturday night; for that is its only
meaning in English. But the Hebrew
word for week conveys quite a different?
idea. It means merely a bundle of 7
a hebdomad. A Hebrew could quite as
easily speak of a week of weeks or a week
of years as he could a week of days. The
context decides it when the latter now is
omitted ; and when we read that Jacob served
a week for Laban and another week for Rachel
nobody doubts but that the writer meant
seven years in either case and not seven
days. Now when we come to the word for a
year, we find it to be a similar derivative
from the number 2. The verb derived from
it is to repeat?to begin at the same point
and go over the same ground again. There
can hardly be any doubt then that the
original meaning of the Hebrew word for year
was a revolution, as we call it?that is, the
revolution of the sun through the seasons of
the year. But in the primitive meaning of the
word it might apply equally well to a revolu-
tion of the moon ; and we must bear in mind
too that in subtropical countries the revolu-
tions of the moon are far more obvious and
easy to be observed than the revolutions of
the sun. In high latitudes indeed, where
the snow lies deep upon the ground every
winter, the revolutions of the seasons are ob-
vious enough ; but in that region which we
have every reason to believe was the cradle
of humanity this is by no means the case;
and men would first begin to reckon the
lapse of time by lunar periods, and
?Count their birthdays by the moon.?
The word annus in Latin, from which we
have our English word annual, meant only a
great circle or ring ; hence another English
word, annular, or ring-shaped. Admittingthen
that the word originally meant merely a
reiterated period of time, as its derivation im-
plies, it would stand in the earliest records of
mankind for a month, but when later lan-
guage appropriated it solely to a year, the
earlier records would be exposed to misinter-
pretation, especially when a translation had
. ludicrous mistake of this order actually
occurs in that very interesting account which
the truth-loving Herodotus has left us of his
travels. He had wandered (he tells us)north-
wards through Media till he arrived on the
borders of Scythia, and not feeling disposed
to travel further into those inclement regions,
he contented himself with gathering all the
information he could of what was further to
the north from those who were resident on
the spot. They told him?first you will come
to such a country, then to such a country,
till at last you come to parts which are utterly
uninhabitable, because the air is filled with
feathers. Though Herodotus puts this last
statement down, he tells us with the utmost
gravity that he don?t believe it. And yet
what doubt can there be but that these
feathers in the Scythian language meant
nothing more than flakes of snow ? So in
like manner, when we read that Adam, or
primaeval man, lived 930 years, we may, like
Herodotus, assume a solemn face and say ? we
don?t believe it.? But divide this number 930
by the number of lunations in a year, and we
have as the result a trifle more than seventy-
fiveyears, and seventy-three years is the average
age of all of them, except of Enoch, who died
by this calculation at the age of thirty. But
of his early death we have intimation in the
expressive language that he walked with God,
and was not, for God took him. Methuselah,
the oldest of them, was just seventy-eight. All
this is very natural. But now arises a diffi-
culty. On turning to the numbers again, we
find that Adam begat a son when he was 130
years old. Consider these 130 years as months,
and we find that ten and a half years was the
age of the father when Seth his third son
was born. Or, if Adam?s case be thought
peculiar, take that of Enoch, who was sixty-
five when his eldest son was born. Turn the
sixty-five months into years, and this would
make Enoch just five and a quarter years old
when the nurse brought to him the little
Methusaleh for his blessing. But mark now,
when I turn to the Septuagint translation of
the Scriptures?a work quite as authentic as the
Hebrew?a version accepted by all the Jews
prior to the Christian era who understood
Greek, constantly quoted by Josephus, gene-
rally by the writers in the New Testament,
and by all the Greek fathers, when?l say, I
turn to the Septuagint, I find that all these


patriarchs when their children are horn are through many chapters that Scripture passes
just 100 years older, with the exception of
Jared and Lamech, and their ages in the He-
brew are far the largest in the list. So that, if
these numbers are to be relied on, men in
those days died at an average age of seventy-
five, and became fathers at an average ago of
fourteen or fifteen. And that I think not
unlikely in a hot country, and when trous-
seaux were very inexpensive. I cannot leave
these sacred pages of Scripture without once
more reminding my hearers that their object
is not to teach either history or science ; and
perhaps no stronger proof could be given of
this than the manner in which they present
their opening view of pre-historic man. That it
is pregnant with vastly deeper meaning than
mere history is discernible at a glance. The
very names of the trees which grow in the
garden of Eden?the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil, and the tree of life ?are palpa-
bly allegorical; and the serpent speaking with
human voice, as in the didactic fables of sage
antiquity, bears testimony to the same fact.
The condensed wisdom of these early chapters
of inspiration is not history, and yet contains
the quintessence of all the histories of all the
peoples of the world up to the time of Abra-
ham. If all those histories had been written
in full, with their myriads of facts, and then
translated into every speech and language
under heaven, we may indeed say, in the
words of the apostle John, ?that the world
itself would not contain the books thatshould
be written.? To show the necessity for con-
densing knowledge for the use of ordinary
men take this illustration from natural his-
tory There are said to be no less than 40,000
different species of beetles preserved in
the cabinet cases of scientific museums,
each species with a different scien-
tific name, and each having some spe-
cialty with which the entomologist is
acquainted. What a tax upon the memory
to recollect them all; and yet all the wisdom
contained in these 40,000 learned tames is
sufficiently condensed for the use of ordinary
men into that one word ?beetle.? When,
then. Abel, the keeper of sheep, was gone, and
Cain had built his city Enoch, a portion of
mankind had passed from a nomadic to
what we should call a more civilised con-
dition of life. Well might he be said at this
juncture to have tasted of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil. It is are
before we are favoured with a peep into the
interior of one of these ancient cities. Yes,
ray friends, great as are the advantages of
civilisation, these advantages are purchased
at a fearful price. To this all the degrading
vices, which spring up in towns like poisonous
weeds, bear saddest witness. The knowledge
of good and evil may raise men to a higher
level in the scale of intellectual being, as no
doubt it does?they become as gods, knowing
good and evil, but they fall from a state of
comparate innocence. And were it not that
religion here steps in with its curative and
regenerative virtues, it might well be said of
most men, ? far better were it that they had
never known civilisation and of some, ?far
better that they had never been born.? Is
not that splendid Oriental metaphor true to
this hour of many daughters of Eve, that,
listening to the serpent?s voice, and tasting of
forbidden fruit, that very day they die.
If, now, we turn from the pages of Scripture,
and address ourselves tostudy the history of our
species by such tokens as we can discern with
our own eyes upon the surface of the earth, the
task becomes long and painful. Here a stone
utensil, there a broken bone, tells a portion of
the tale ; even the manner in which a nut-
shell has been cracked, taken in connexion
with the matrix which imbeds the relic,
conveys a meaning ; and the laboriously-
traced etymologies of the earliest written
languages serve as beacons in wandering
through the dark recesses of the past. It
requires, therefore, much enduring persever-
ance, coupled with great soberness of judg-
ment, on the part of the enthusiastic anti-
quarian. before he can crystallise his many
scattered facts into the transparent gem of
truth. It is pleasant enough, as you sit in
your easy-chair, to concoct all sorts of crude
theories out of the Scripture text; but to dive
to the bottom of a bone cave, whore all is
moist and dark, and ever and anon chill
drippings from above find their way into
jour neck-hole, and day after day nothing
perhaps to reward you for your pains, is a
very different thing. Hoc opus, hie labor
eat. It reminds me of an anecdote of a pains-
taking English pastor who had taught an
aged parishioner to read, and inquired one
day of the wife how the old roan got on in
reading his Bible. ? Bible,? she says, ?bless
you, sir, he has got out of the Bible and into.


the newspapers long ago.? The traces of heads. But there were others of much
man?s primaeval existence upon earth are, as
we might have expected, faint and few, but
where met with exceedingly significant.
They extend in some sort over the whole face
of the earth, and backwards in point of time
to a period so remote that the 6,000 years
estimated by Archbishop Ussher from the
Scripture records, sink into utter insignifi-
cance. This branch of study is quite new.
It began to dawn with the first year of the
present century, when a Mr. John Frere dis-
covered near Diss, in Suffolk, certain flints,
which he tells us ? were evidently weapons
of war, fabricated and used by a people who
had not the use of metals. They lay in great
numbers at the depth of about twelve feet of
a stratified soil, which was dug into for the
purpose of clay for bricks. . . . The
manner in which the flint weapons lay would
lead to the persuasion that it was a place of
their manufacture, and not of their acci-
dental deposit. Their numbers were so great
that the man who carried on the brick work,
before he became aware of their being ob-
jects of curiosity, had emptied basketsful of
them into the ruts of the adjoining road.?
Some of these implements are now in the
British Museum. Possibly some of my hearers
may have seen them ; I have not. But an-
other collection?one of the finest in the
world I was told at that time?was in process
of formation in the island of Guernsey during
my residence there. A local antiquary?Mr.
Lucas?conceived the idea of digging into
the floors of what are sometimes called
Druids? altars?the cromlechs. These altars,
which are really places of sepulture, and
abound in the Channel Islands, are rude
structures of massive stones, placed upright
round small enclosures, and roofed over with
enormous ponderous slabs. Here they have
stood for untold centuries, and the race of
men which built them has completely passed
away. Mr. Lucas?s labours were rewarded by
the discovery of a large number of these
stone tools (Celts, as they call them, from
the Latin celtis, a chisel), various in shape,
and evidently intended to be applied to uses
as different from each other as that of a
hatchet from a razor. One would be notched
that it might be fastened to a stick, and then
used either as a hammer or an axe, accord-
ing as the blunt side or the sharp one might
be turned forward. Some would be spear-
finer make and polish, and capable of per-
forming such work as is now done by
knife or scissors. The edge of them is so
sharp, notwithstanding the number of cen-
turies which have rolled over since they were
deposited, that if you should heedlessly run
yom thumb over the edge it would at once
cut you to the quick. Such, then, are among
the earliest tools which man taught himself
to use at the time when the first wave or
two of population was spreading itself over
the earth. We, in this era of the world?s
existence, are still able to assist our imagina-
tion by studying localities where these first
waves of population still exist? e.g., among
the Bosjesmen and Hottentots of South
Africa, or even On our own continent. But
they are now rapidly passing away. When
the West India Islands were first discovered
they swarmed with the aboriginal inhabi-
tants?inoffensive people, lying lazily under
the trees, and apparently happy as the day
was long. But now not a man is left. Many
of the savage races with which we have come
in contact?as for example, the Kaffirs in
Africa, the red men in America, and the
New Zealanders, are not the first but the
second wave of population.
Now what is it which proves the great antiq-
uity of man ? It is partly the bones of animals
found simultaneously deposited with these rel-
ics of him, and partly geological changes which
have since taken place, and the time of which
we are able in some degree to measure. Even
Mr. Frere, at the beginning of the century,
mentioned that in the stratum of sand above
the gravel where they found the stone tools
there lay ?the jaw-bone and teeth of an
enormous unknown animal ?i. e., unknown
then, but had it been preserved till now,
probably Professor Owen would have told us
more about it. Within the last thirty years
many similar gravel strata, and many bone
caves, have been carefully searched both in
England and France ; and great precaution
taken to ascertain exactly the manner in
which these relics of man?s handiwork are
associated with the bones of extinct animals.
These extinct animals are usually of large size.
There were two species of European elephant
?the e. primigenius, and the e. antiquus.
There was a hippopotamus, and a woolly
rhinoceros or two; there were bears and
hyenas in abundance* besides gigantic deer


and oxen, bisons, wolves, and swine. Let earth?s crust. But even then, if we do resort
me quote the case of the famous Brixham cave
in Devonshire, three or four miles west of
Torquay. At the bottom was a very perfect
flint tool, and at a higher level was a very
perfect leg of an extinct species of bear,
which must have been deposited there when
the sinews were entire, for every bone was in
its proper place, even the knee-pan; and
overlying all was a solid crust of hard stalag-
mite, requiring a pickaxe to break through,
and itself containing a reindeer?s horn, and
the bone of an extinct bear?of a bear that
is of a species now nowhere to be found in
the world. And though, to be sure, reindeer
still exist, yet if you were to bring from
Lapland any number of them to Brixham,
they would sicken and die in a few months-
The experiment was tried in Scotland. Now
what we have particularly to observe is, that
the Brixham cave is notan isolated instance of
the sort, but the type of a multitude of others.
In short, every year is adding to the testi-
mony we already possess, that a very long
time ago man, in his primitive condition,
before he had found out the use of any metal
whatever, was spread over all Europe ; and
that, at the same period, there lived elephants
and rhinoceroses, and gigantic deer of a sort
which now are nowhere to be found, being
readily distinguishable from those of Asia
and of Africa by the corrugation of their
teeth.
Now it may be urged that the disappear-
ance of these huge animals does not of
itself necessarily indicate any great lapse of
time. When the Cape of Good Hope was
first colonised by the Dutch, only two
centuries ago, animals as gigantic as the
e. antiquus swarmed in the rivers and
forests of Southern Africa ; but they have all
disappeared before the advance of man for
hundreds of miles to the northward. But
then, on the other hand, we must recollect
that it would take many more centuries for a
sparse and feeble race, whose deadliest
weapons were stone hatchets, or arrows tipped
with flint, to destroy these huge pachyderms
than it would a flowing stream of European
immigrants, agricultural in their habits, and
armed with first-rate Manton rifles?so much
more time, indeed, that many advocates of
the briefer existence of man have preferred
to attribute their disappearance from the
fauna of Europe to geological changes of the
to geology, we shall have to draw very largely
on the great bank of time for such phenomena
to take place ; for all geological evidence goes
to prove that whatever occurred in those
ancient eras occurred quietly, or at all events
with no more violent cataclysms and disrup-
tions than are occurring from time to time
somewhere on the earth?s surface now.
But let us turn to another page of man?s pri-
meval story. Denmark is particularly rich in
the tokens it furnishes of the great antiquity of
aboriginal man in Europe. The shores of
nearly all Scandinavia, especially the Danish
islands, are dotted with large mounds of shells
-oyster-shells, cockle-shells, mussels, and
periwinkles, interspersed with stone imple-
ments, and with bones of animals, which
have had the gristle gnawed off the ends. The
Danes call these mounds Kyoken-modding
words which we have in our own language
slightly modified in sound?Kyoken being
identical with kitchen, and modding with
midden, or the manure-heap, which used to
stand, and probably still stands, near almost
every rural cottage in the north of England.
The name is exceedingly expressive, for they
were evidently the kitchen refuse-heaps of
the Danish aborigines. There is no mistak-
ing their being the relics of many an excellent
dinner. The bones are almost all broken in
a peculiar way for the extraction of the
marrow, and then given to the domestic dogs
to feed upon. Similar bones have been given
to modern dogs to test this point, and are
always left in precisely the same state. These
mounds are some of them 1,000 feet long by
above 200 broad, and from three to ten feet
high. Take an average of five feet high, and
this gives us just 1,000,000 cubic feet in one
single mound. And if we suppose a cubic
inch of shell to have furnished a decent
mouthful of fish, that would give us just
144,000,000 mouthfuls in one single mound.
But we must remember we are only calculat-
ing the oyster-sauce ; there is plenty of evi-
dence to prove that many a good steak of
red-deer and of roe supplied the pieces de
resistance at these primitive feasts. So that
whatever it was which caused these ancient
people to disappear, they do not seem to
have been starved out. Now, what evidence
can we extract from these mounds to in-
dicate the lapse of time? It is this The
oyster shells, and especially the mussel shells,


are much larger?about twice the size of the
same species of shell found in that neighbour-
hood now, the diminution in size being
due to the deficiency of salt in the Baltic
water. Clearly, therefore, in the lapse
of pre-historic ages the Danish coast line
must have undergone some geological
change which has blocked up once-existing
channels, and excluded the full tide of
salt water which must have once flowed
in from the German Sea. But this is not
all. When we extend our examination from
the shells to the bones found in the refuse-
heaps in order to ascertain the kind of ani-
mals these Danish aborigines consorted with,
we find they are all of recent species. No
mammoth, no rhinoceros bones, but those of
roe and red deer, of lynx, and fox, and wolf-
all animals found in Europe still. There is,
to be sure, one apparent exception?the unis,
or wild bull, which now has disappeared ; but
we must remember that the urus is not pre-
historic, for Julius Ciesar, the first invader of
Britain, has left us a full description of it, so
that, like the dodo, it lived into historic times.
Old, then, as these Danish-mound people were,
they were not so old as those bone-cave
people of Brixham, or those of the gravel
drifts, who were contemporaneous with bears
and mammoths and hyenas of extinct sorts.
And this inference is further corroborated by
the comparison of the stone implements of
the two peoples. For of that earliest race of
man, the flints are so rude that it is some-
times difficult for any but a practised eye to
see that they are implements at all; but in the
mounds their edges are ground to greater
nicety, showing a marked progress in such
civilisation as these ancient peoples were
capable of.
And now comes in a further proof of
progressive advancement. There are in
Denmark, besides these shell-mounds, cer-
tain peat bogs varying in depth from ten
o thirty feet which have been accummu-
lated in hollows which once were swamps,
like those on the banks of the Yarra. Now
the lowest stratum of this peat is composed
entirely of swamp mosses. Above this
another growth of peat, but no longer ex-
clusively of swamp plants. We must observe
this stratified character of the bogs, for it
proves that they are in the state in which they
were originally formed, and not like some
Irish bogs, which, conceiving a passion for
travel, go on moving at a certain slow pace,
and fill up all the hollows which they cross.
In these Danish bogs everything is in situ;
and imbedded in the peat are found trunks
of trees which have grown on the margin of
the swamps, lived to a good old age, for many
are three feet in diameter, and then fallen in.
From these trees we are able, without much
cross-examination, to extort some very im-
portant testimony. For in the lowest stratum
the principal tree is the Scotch fir, and yet
that tree has long ceased to be a denizen
of the Danish islands. There is no record
of its ever being seen there in historic times,
and when curious acclimatisers try to plant it
there now, it will not thrive. From some
unknown cause, some gradual upheaval of
the continent?so gradual as to have left the
swamp still a swamp, and yet sufficient to
have shut out a certain atmospheric stimulus
?shut out, we will suppose, the benign in-
fluences of the Gulf-stream, which produce
those splendid mists which Scotchmen love
so much?whatever the cause, all these fir
trees in course of time died out in Denmark,
and were superseded by two species of oak in
succession, both of which still grow in Eng-
land. But the change did not stop here, but,
as the ages rolled, the oaks disappeared in
turn, and gave place to the common beech,
which, within historic times, has been the
great prevailing tree throughout Denmark.
Now, here is the place to introduce the single
connecting link which gives significancy to all
these curious facts. It is this : In the very
lowest stratum of one hog, and under the
prostrate trunk of a veritable Scotch fir, which
had lain there undisturbed so many untold
centuries, Professor Steenstruss (of Copen-
hagen) took out with his own hands a stone
hatchet. To estimate, then, the antiquity of
this venerable relic is the problem before us,
and is identical with that of reckoning up the
centuries which it must have taken the races
of trees we have been speaking of to be suc-
cessively exterminated. True, we are familiar
enough with examples of this kind of exter-
mination, A crop of thistles will soon exter-
minate a crop of wheat. The common rat,
which is now in all our sewers, was never seen
in Europe till it crossed the Wolga, after an
earthquake in 1727 : but so much stronger
was it than its softer cousin, the old black
rat, which previously had occupied all the
available rat-holes on the Continent, that it


speedily extinguished him. Nay, not content
with having all the continent of Europe to
himself, he quickly comes to Hamburg, finds
there a vessel bound for London ?coolly puts
his wife and family on board at dead of
night?and, the voyage over, as coolly brings
them all ashore at Wapping. That?s just the
way he came to Melbourne. And now the
brown rat is everywhere, and the black rat
nowhere ?all within less than a century and
a half. But was this the rate, I ask, at which
whole forests of Scotch fir gave way to oaks,
and then the oaks to beeches? Certainly
not. Thistle-down Hies fast and far; and
there are other weeds which, though possess-
ing no wings of their own, can borrow the
wings of birds which feed on them ; for not
only is their vitality not destroyed by passing
through the alimentary canal, but, like
guano-sown grain, they have their fertility in-
creased. Not so with the acorn. Every new
generation of oaks must grow within that
narrow forest-border over which the highest
wind can blow the acorn as it falls ; and they
must grow to maturity before they in turn
can shed their fruit. And yet Denmark has
three times changed its forests! What count-
less winters, then, must have annually shed
their coverlets of snow on those wondrous
swamps which tell of these progressive
changes! And, what is very striking?as the
forests of different trees succeed each other,
so also do tokens exhibit themselves of the
progressive advancement of man ; for in the
Scotch-fir period we find him using stone
implements and living upon shell-fish and
venison ; but when the oaks have superseded
the fir-trees, then bronze implements appear
for the first time, together with bones of sheep
and oxen. The conclusion of the whole re-
cord, then, is this: ?The lowest stratum
of peat presents us with indications of man
existing in no higher condition than he was
when the huge pachyderms roamed the con-
tinent ; but we trace him through this early
Scotch-fir period refining himself into the
practice of polishing his stone tools for finer
workmanship, and, probably, for the richer
ornamentation of his person. But when the
lapse of centuries has brought round the
oaks, then he has risen to the higher civili-
sation of bronze utensils ; and bronze, of
course, brings us to the borders of reliable
history.
Now, here we may pause to remark
upon the very interesting fact that just when
these stone implements of remote antiquity
had begun, within these few years, to attract
the ?attention of the antiquary, the stone
period of existing peoples should be just pass-
ing away. When Tasmania was first dis-
covered the aborigine of that island could be
seen manufacturing his stone knives with
great dexterity, and of a type closely resem-
bling those which the Scandinavian aborigine
manufactured such an incalculably long time
ago. Picking up a likely stone, he would
deftly chip off one side a few flakes and
leave the other round for the hand to hold
by. That was his knife, and when the edge
was blunted he would fling it away and make
another. But he has just ceased to be a living
illustration. The last Tasmanian man died
only the other day. (You read in the papers,
I dare say, how some enthusiastic savant
went in the darkness of the night and took
his skull; and public propriety was shocked,
and all with one accord cried fie ! But really
it is difficult to see what ought to have been
done. It was clearly wrong to walk off sur-
reptitiously with the poor fellow?s head, but
then would it not have been equally wrong
not to have secured it, in the cause of anti-
quarian science ? Perhaps the happy medium
would have best been hit by dividing the
cranium in two parts, polishing one half for the
Hobart Town museum, and burying the other
under the altar of decency.) Living, I say,
as we do at this peculiar era, when the stone
age is passing away from the remotest corner
of the earth, we resemble Moses on the top of
Pisgah, and see from the same stand-point
two totally distinct phases of human exist-
ence. The wilderness of the stone period, so
to speak, we have left for ever, and yet it
reaches to the very base of the mountain on
which we stand. We have had the oppor-
tunity of verifying by ocular inspection what
the degree of civilisation is which these stone
utensils indicate. Those old aboriginal in-
habitants of England and France whose im-
plements are found sepulchred with the
bones of rhinoceros and elephant in the
gravel drift would be very much in the con-
dition of the rude Tasmanian race who are
just passing away. (Women remain.) Where-
as the polished implements of the peat bog
immediately prior to the introduction of
bronze so closely resemble those of present
Polynesian and Maori workmanship that we


may estimate pretty fairly the kind of men
who peopled Scandinavia before the oak had
been exterminated by the beech. In a few
years the opportunity of making this com-
parison by ocular inspection of living races
will have passed away.
We must now take a rapid glance at
Switzerland. In the winter of 1853-4 an
unusual drought reduced the waters of
all the Swiss lakes to a level lower than
the oldest inhabitant could remember.
The thrifty people resolved to turn the occa-
sion to account, and to redeem some portion
of the lake by doing what was done in the
Botanic-gardens here during the last dry
summer?raising some parts by deepening
others. But the work was no sooner begun
than the diggers came upon piles of wood
driven into the mud, in which mud were also
found a great many celts ?axes and hammers
and other tools, all in first-rate condition.
In short, they had discovered the foundations
of an ancient village, and it was soon ascer-
tained that not one only, but seventy such
villages, once existed in the various Swiss
lakes, built upon piles in the middle of the
water, and nearly all belonging to the stone
period. Forty thousand piles have been cal-
culated as belonging to one single village.
Curiosity was highly excited, and every relic
as it came to light was carefully studied and
preserved. The pre-historic tale they tell is
this The people who constructed these lake
dwellings were decidedly further advanced in
civilisation than the Danish aborigines. For
we discover tokens of agriculture, three kinds
of grain, four sorts of domesticated animals,
fragments of pottery, even playthings for
children. A canoe had foundered in the lake
laden with stones; being intended, probably,
when overtaken with misfortune, to strengthen
the bases of the piles. The piles themselves
could not have been driven in without the
aid of ingenious mechanism. Stones of great
weight must have been raised by strong cor-
dage to do the work of the iron monkeys now
employed in driving piles. So that we may
be said to be contemplating a stage of ad-
vancement on a par with those extraordinary
people who constructed the megalithic circles
in England, of which the most celebrated
is that on Salisbury Plain. What im-
mense mechanical skill must have been
exercised by a people who did not possess
� single iron tool to drag stones of
such enormous weight from incredible dis-
tances (for they are not/the stones of the
neighbourhood), and having set some of them
upright to raise others equally ponderous to a
great height to 'place them horizontally on
the top. And.then, again, there is the great
serpent of Abury, which consists of massive
stones arranged within sight of each other for
miles upon miles in a serpentine line, in the
middle of which is a small megalithic circle,
the object of the long line of stones probably
being to guide the people of a scattered race
as they came periodically to attend their
central place of worship. Travelling from
east or west, they would find it much easier to
strike the serpent somewhere than to hit the
circle at once.
But to return to the lake-dwellers of
Switzerland. Surprising as these monuments
are of so remote an age, they are never-
theless the handiwork of a feeble race ?
of a race on the eve of extinction. The very
circumstance of their having recourse to
laboriously-constructed pile dwellings in the
middle of the water* with a narrow access
from the shore, seems to point to a sense of
imbecility, and to the existence of a stronger
race not far off of whom they were afraid.
Nor were their fears vain, for a close inspec-
tion of the ddbris around these piles proves in
the case of nearly every village that it has
been destroyed by fire. Charred remains of
rafters or other wood, and even of grains of
corn, shed a melancholy light on this tragic
story of a long-past age, when the bitter wail
of wife and child must have risen up t
Heaven as their burning homes sank in
smoke and flame within the bosom of the
once peaceful waters. There are two circum-
stances which make these lake dwellings par-
ticularly interesting?one is, that they present
a point of osculation with written history;
for Herodotus gives an account of a similar
habitation in a small mountain lake in Thrace,
five centuries before Christ, whose inhabit-
ants were enabled to escape subjection to the
Persian yoke during, the famous invasion of
Greece, through their inaccessibility in the
middle of the lake. And this very lake-vil-
lage, by means of following out Herodotus?s
description, was re-discovered by a French
savant, M. Deville, in 1862, i, e, seven years
ago.
The second point of interest connected
with the Swiss lake dwellings is, that we


have the means of approximating to the time
in which they were first constructed ; for the
waters which flow into some of the lakes
form deltas which gradually silt up at a
definite rate per annum. Now, as we know
how much has been silted up within historic
periods, we have an element of calculation
whereby to reach the building of the earliest
dwelling. Three scientific gentlemen, taking
quite different grounds, and making their
calculations in perfect independence of each
other, have come to very nearly the same
conclusion?viz. that the bronze age must
have begun about four or five thousand years
ago, and the earliest stone age about a couple
of thousand years before that. So that, if
we just step back some sixty centuries of time
we may see these ingenious savages actively
at work with their ponderous stone monkeys
driving their piles into the mud. And we
must bear, too, in mind, that what we see
being done in these few selected cases has
been done at various times by similar peoples
all over the world, sometimes attaining before
their extinction a high degree of civilisation.
In Central America the wandering traveller
comes across the ruins of what must once
have been extensive settlements of organised
society, of which the present inhabitants can
give no more account than we can of the
people who constructed the megalithic circle
at Stonehenge. And in the great basin of
the Mississippi and of the Ohio there are
hundreds of mounds which are the ruined
temples of an extinct people ; and so long ago
is it since these tombs and temples have been
buried in the earth, that large rivers have
had time to change their courses, and whole
generations of forests to succeed each other.
It is rather a curious circumstance that the
Scriptures themselves, though they pass over
the stone age historically, yet bear indirect
testimony to its having once existed, by their
mention of the use of stone implements in a
religious ceremony. We know perfectly well
how long religious usage will overlive when
other usages have become wholly changed by
scientific discovery, or by political revolution.
Indeed the very meaning of the word super-
stition is a surviving. When the Romans
expelled their kings there was one religious
ceremony which the king alone had been
accustomed to perform ; but rather than part
with this ancient rite they appointed a
special king to perform this special duty, and
called him rex sacrificulus?a little sacrificing
king. And exactly the same thing was done
at Athens, one of the archons being created
king for the self-same purpose. And so did
the stone-knife survive in religious ceremonies
long after it had been banished from the
dinner-table and from the carpenter?s shop.
The Egyptians in Herodotus?s time, when they
embalmed a corpse, would open it only with
a knife of stone. And so in Scripture we find
that circumcision was originally so performed.
Zipporah, the wife of Moses, discharged
angrily this duty with a similar implement.
And when Joshua, the son of Nun, died, at
the age of 110, and they buried him on the
north side of the hill of Gaash, the Septuagint
copy goes on to say (though the verse is not
in our present Hebrew text) that ?there
they laid with him in the tomb wherein they
buried him there the stone knives where*
with he circumcised the children of Israel at
the Gilgals, when he led them out of Egypt,
as the Lord commanded. And there they are
unto this day.? But though this verse is not
in the Hebrew text now, yet that it was in the
Hebrew text from which the LXX. translated
is made clear by the occurrence of a manifest
Hebraism in their version. ?In the tomb
wherein they buried him there the word re-
presenting ? wherein? in the Hebrew being
a mere particle, and requiring the addition
of ? there? to indicate its antecedent.
Accustomed as we are to associate all
branches of mechanical art and invention
with the use of iron, we are prone to attach
the idea of barbarism to an age when this
metal was as yet undiscovered. But the idea
is erroneous. A large amount of civilisation
existed during the period of bronze, and
before the introduction of steel. The ad-
mixture of the two metals copper and tin,
which constitute bronze, furnished a very ex-
cellent and enduring material for every sort
of work. If a tougher metal was required,
more copper must be added ; if a more brittle
and harder one, then more tin. In the far-
famed siege of Troy, which is as it were the
border ground between history and fable, the
weapons fought with were of bronze, not steel,
and we should gather that in the bronze the
quantity of tin was high, for of one doughty
champion engaged in single combat, and dis-
charging his spear against the foe, we read
that the spear-head on striking his adversary?s
shield was splintered into fragments, being


over-tempered, it would appear, to give greater
sharpness to the point. Compare with this
the combat of David with the giant of Gath.
Here too is bronze. Goliath has a helmet of
brass (ought to have been translated bronze)
upon his head. His coat of mail weighed 5,000
shekels of brass and he had greaves
of brass upon his legs, and a target of brass
between his shoulders. All his defensive
armour is of bronze. But, unlike that of the
Trojan hero, his spear-head was of iron, so
that we should argue that even in David?s
time steel was a costlier metal than bronze.
And with Homer still more so, for in the
Iliad he arrays his heroes in bronze, and in
the Odyssey classifies the treasures of Ulysses
in the keeping of Penelope as of bronze, and
gold, and iron. It was this costliness of
armour which gave such an enormous pre-
ponderance to the great heroes in ancient
war. Not only were they picked men of
superior strength, but, clad in their panoply of
bronze, they were each a host in himself; so
that Homer?s description of their mowing
down whole companies of men as a mower
mows the grass is hardly a poetic exaggera-
tion.
I may appear to be dwelling too long
upon this metal, but in point of fact
it was intimately concerned in altering
the whole face of the world, and advancing
man to a higher civilisation. Once discovered
and its uses known, pre-historic men became
as eager in pursuit of its constituent metals
as a prospector after a gold-field now. It is
wonderful what distances the great merchant
nations of antiquity went to secure posses-
sion of them. There is no doubt that the
Cornish mines, and those of the Scilly Islands
(called in those days the islands of tin), were
wrought by the enterprising Phoenicians. In-
deed in one Cornish mine a stone axe was
found, in a mine which had been worked out
and abandoned before history began. Even
prior to the time when the Tyrian
ships brought these metals through the
straits of Gibraltar, there is traditional
evidence that they came overland through
the Celtic nations. Hence Gaul was stimu-
lated to commercial enterprise ; and when
Julius Cmsar invaded the country he found
their ships on the west coast so large, and
standing so high out of the water, that the
Homan javelin could with difficulty reach
their deck. Those couldn?t be mere coasting
vessels; and though, to be sure, they burst
upon our view in the midst of an historic
period, yet the very circumstance of their
doing so without any previous intimation of
their existence is only the stronger proof of
the great advances in civilisation many
nations must have made without our hearing
a word about it through any channel what-
ever, When Gaul comes into the field of
view for the first time it is as a nation _ of
considerable wealth, enterprising, inquisi-
tive, fairly organised under kings, with tra-
velling merchants everywhere, and transit
duties systematically levied. And what is
true of Gaul is in a tenfold degree true of
many nations of the East. The old myth of
the Argo is the tradition of an actual expedi-
tion which went in search of gold: the
golden fleece is only the clumsy precursor of
the digger?s cradle. Herodotus mentions thata
Phoenician ship doubled the Cape of Good
Hope; and though he tells us he doesn?t _ be-
lieve it, yet the consistent detail he gives
leaves hardly any doubt about the fact. And
if some peoples were famous on the sea, so
were others on the land. The great pyramid
of Egypt, built at least forty centuries ago, is
pre-historic. And yet, so many curious pro-
perties has it, the results of precise calcula-
tion, that there is hardly any resisting the sur-
mise of Sir John Herschel, that it is really a
marvellous monument of science?an attempt
to perpetuate to posterity as in a book of stone
the accurate result of astronomic observa-
tion. In the first place, the circuit of the
base is 366 cubits ?indicating, it would ap-
pear, the number of days in the annual revo-
lution of the sun. To this very day we
divide our circle into 360�, the most con-
venient proximate number to the days in the
year; but this practice we did not obtain
from Egypt, but from the more recent Baby-
lonian college of Magi, at which college
there is some reason to believe that the great
prophet Daniel was professor of mathematics.
But this perimeter of the great pyramid,
though representing the yearly course of the
sun, was for building purposes made square
instead of circular, and so, of course, could
not have a radius. What must they do for a
radius ? They raised it vertically, and made
it the height of the pyramid. 366 divided by
211 gives the height of the building m cubits.
Then, again, 'the orientation of the building is
most exact, the sides standing within 5'
of the several points of the compass. But by
far the most interesting point is that the
entrance passage, which looks due north,
slopes upwards at just that angle which looks
towards the pole?but not exactly, for you are
aware that there is no star exactly at the
north pole, but by the precession of the
equinox sometimes one star and some-
times another in long cycles of years
will be nearest tbat point. At present the
Polar star is Arcturus, the tip of the Little
Bear?s tail. But some thousands of years ago
the most conspicious star nearest the Pole was
Andraconis. Sir John Herschel made an
astronomical calculation to ascertain when it
was that this star would be seen through this
entrance gallery. It was just about 4,000
years ago, and in one particular year in the
same century it has been found that while An-
draconis was crossing the field of view, the


Pleiades was crossing the same meridian,
right over head. I need not remind you what
an important constellation the Pleiades was
in ancient astronomy. The first astronomical
question which the Lord, speaking to Job out
of the whirlwind, puts to him is, ? Canstthou
bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades??
This first great pyramid was the tribute of
adoring wonder to the glories of astronomical
science, and we can well imagine the deep
enthusiasm its first fresh study would inspire.
We need not entertain any misgivings on the
score of the motive being too feeble to pro-
duce so massive a result. The conclusion we
arrive at is further corroborated by the fact that
the great pyramid contains no inscriptions ;
whereas the other pyramids, which appear to
be clumsy copies of this, and having a very
imperfect orientation, are full of mural
paintings and hieroglyphics of historic im
port. They were historic monuments ; this,
a mathematical one. The builders of it
doubtless fancied that they were fixing a date
from which all chronological calculations
might be made thenceforward with unerring
precision. We can imagine the great dis-
appointment they would feel on finding
that Andraconis, their polar star, soon began
to wander away from his position, and that
that which with so much trouble they had
fixed as a guide to all future chronology
should prove false to their anticipations.
This may be Daniel?s meaning when he says
of the Almighty, ?He changeth the times
and the seasons.? What, however, disap-
pointed them enables us to calculate back-
wards the time when they lived ; and it is a
curious circumstance that a great hiero-
glyphic scholar (William Osburn), by quite in-
dependent investigation, places the Egyptian
dynasty, to which we owe the great pyramid
in the same century, 2200 to 2100 B.C,
But it is time for me to be drawing to a close
I have selected, as you will observe, some of
the salient points of man?s unwritten history
which have escaped the deluge of oblivion.
They betoken a gradual advance from un-
cultivated barbarism to a high development.
It would have been impossible within the
compass of a single lecture to go into greater
detail. Taking a general view of the whole
subject, I see no reason, physical, moral, or
linguistic, to doubt that the earliest created
human beings sprang from a single pair. My
conviction is that the earliest of mankind
were rude in the extreme, and that they
continued a very long time in that condition
?that, in fact, the earliest command given
to man, ?Be fruitful and multiply and re-
plenish [or rather fill] the earth,? was literally
fulfilled before either Cain or Seth was
thought of?that during that long period man
might be comparatively innocent, having no
sense of sin, but his intellect was not stimu-
lated to any great activity, and this from the
very nature of the case. He lived in a genial
climate ; his wants were few ; land to hunt
over was plenty. If by natural increase par-
ticular localities grew over-peopled, all the
world was, so to speak, before him, and the
teeming prairies of the earth were ever in-
viting him to ?seek fresh woods and pas-
tures new. ? And thus the first wave of popu-
lation which encompassed the world hore a
striking uniformity of likeness in habits and
manners to our primitive type. But when
the second or third wave of population super-
vened, man had to enter upon quite a new
career. He had to make good his position
wherever he came against a race which had
already pre occupied the ground. And now
arose the necessity for some sort of social
organisation : now was there scope for
superiority of intellect to show itself. The
art of war sprang up; men built walled
towns and acquired property in sheep
and oxen ; the best grazing ground*
acquired a value, which if the occu-
piers would keep to themselves they must
do so by strenuous exertion and by force of
arms, by submission to discipline, by cir-
cumspection and forethought. Under such
influences, both intellect and strength of
character would grow apace. Power once
organised has a tendency to augment itself.
Some mightier mind is sure in time to arise,
and give such an impetus to the onward
movement that a single lifetime witnesses a
wondrous change. Weaker tribes, over-
powered by the stronger, must submit to do
their servile work. The innate passion for
sovereignty and sway becomes developed to
an extraordinary degree; and the world, at
last, gazes with astonishment on such mar-
vellous empires as disturbed the mind of
Nebuchadnezzar in the visions of the night.
And, strange to say, even these empires
reached the zenith of their power prior to the
commencement of what we now call history.
If now for one moment we turn back to the
book of Genesis, we shall find these views
confirmed. Except in that single tradition in
which Noah?s genealogy is traced, the word
?Adam? is not a proper name, but a common
noun, and takes the definite article, like
another noun, ?the man,? Cain is the first
man who is made to assume any indivi-
duality. He builded a city. He is the type
and representative of those who first culti-
vated the ground, and who by natural conse-
quence were thus first able to concentrate
population in a town. This is consistent.
Again, concentration stimulates intellect.
Mind clashes with mind ; and a city?s arti-
ficial wants bring ingenuity into play. And
therefore it is that among Cain?s immediate
descendants Tubal Cain is found as an in-
structor of every artificer in brass and iron.
But not only to mechanical arts does a city
life give birth, but also to the refinements of
poetry and music. Lamech, the fifth in
descent from Cain, furnishes us with a spe-
cimen of the earliest poetry extant; and his
son Jubal was the father of all who handle the
harp and the organ. The letter of Scripture
could not well hand down to us the tunes
which Jubal played, still less the sound of his
instruments; but Lamech?s poetry has sur-
vived. It is of the same order as are
most of the Psalms, or as those utterances


of the great Balaam when, he takes up his
parable and speaks. It consists of language
so balanced that the second half of a verse is
the repetition of the first, with the wording
changed. Lamech had, it would appear, acci-
dentally killed a man, and it is thus that his
conscience disburdened itself of its weight to
his two wives :
Adah and Zillah, hear my voice,
Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech.
For I have slain a man to my wounding,
And a young man to my hurt.
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold,
Truly Lamech seventy and seven fold.
And here the record suddenly stops. I will
take advantage of the circumstance, and stop
as suddenly. These old writings are the most
wonderful in the world. Simple in their style,
and of unknown authorship, they come before
us without any pretensions. They don?t claim,
like Mohammed?s Koran, to have been brought
to earth by an archangel?s hand. They are
merely ancient records; and no inspired
writer has ever said they were anything
more. But they are genuine records, and
replete with religious truth. It is our deep
reverence for the religious truths they contain,
and the greater truths they foreshadow, which
may sometimes have led us to regard them
with a prostration of mind amounting almost
to superstition. But this is no more than
befalls any other thing which is associated
with religion. Our Great Teacher rebuked
his countrymen for a too superstitious reve-
rence for the Sabbath. And the same fault
attaches to all who overvalue the husk_ of
religion in their great reverence for religion
itself ; whether that husk be a sacred day, or
a consecrated place, or a religious site, or the
dominical table, or a canonised saint. It is
the same reverent feeling which, in fervent
excess, has led to Mariolatry, toSabbatolatry,
to Bibliolatry. Let us ever bear in mind that
the letter killeth, but the spirit it is which
giveth life.
The Rev. I. Mooee, S.J., in moving a vote
of thanks to the lecturer, bore testimony to
the lucidity, comprehensiveness, and ability
with which he had treated the subject; and
whilst he could not receive all the interpreta-
tions and deductions from the scriptures
which the lecturer had drawn, he could yet
admire and appreciate the erudition which
had been displayed.
Dr. Barker seconded the motion, which
was carried with acclamation.
The Rev. Dr. Bromby briefly returned
thanks, and expressed his entire approval of
the objects the Early-closing Association
sought to attain, and his wish that they might
succeed.
The Rev. J. S. Waugh proposed a vote of
thanks to the Right Rev. the Bishop of Mel-
bourne for presiding.
Mr. G. Foord seconded the motion, which
was carried by acclamation.
The Right Rev. the Bishop of Melbourne,
in returning thanks, expressed his pleasure
at seeing the good account to which the asso-
ciation was trying to turn its influence, and
the advantages it had gained by attending to
the intellectual improvement of the people.
So far as he was able, he should be always
happy to promote their objects. He had de-
rived much pleasure from the able and in-
teresting lecture given by the Rev. Dr.
Bromby, and while he did not agree with all
the inferences he had drawn from his scien-
tific research, he (the bishop) felt that re-
ligion had nothing to fear from science. No
man who believed in the Bible should endea-
vour to restrain the progress of scientific men,
as there was nothing to fear from their dis-
coveries.
The Doxology was then sung, and after the
Bishop had pronounced the Benediction, the
meeting dispersed.

OBJECTS.
The Closing of all Retail Shops at Six p.m. from Monday to Friday,
and at Two p.m. on Saturday.
The Early Payment of Wages.
The Abolition of Late Markets, especially on Saturday Nights.
A large number of Retail Establishments are now closing at Six p.m.,
thus securing to many hundreds an invaluable blessing. You are respectfully
requested to assist in extending the benefit of this arrangement, by according
your sanction and ?upport to the efforts of the Association.
? The tendency of long hours of confinement at the desk, behind the counter, in the
dressmakers? room, or in the close atmosphere of the manufactory, is to weaken the physical
powers to irritate the sensitive system, to induce prostration and debility, often ending in
fatal consumption, to send them to rest with aching heads, not to enjoy profound repose, but
to slumber and dream, and start, during the few hours allotted for sleep, at the close of
which they must again drag themselves to the accustomed place, to go through the same
routine of duty.?
? There is in this metropolis (London) a sacrifice of a thousand lives annually through
the practice of keeping people in shops a greater number of hours than the human constitution
can bear. But this is not all; where a thousand persons die from that cause, there are a t
least eight thousand whose health suffers from it.?
The efforts of the Association in the way of printing, the holding of
meetings, advertising, rent, &c., involve a considerable expenditure. Sub-
scriptions and donations will be thankfully received by the Treasurer,
T. Alston, Esq., Collins Street West, or may be paid to the credit of the
Early Closing Association, at the Commercial Bank, Melbourne.
