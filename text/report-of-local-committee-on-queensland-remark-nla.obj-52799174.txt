Remarks by Colonial Defence Committee,
THE Colonial Defence Committee have had under consideration the
Deport drawn up by the Local Committee of Queensland.
They have already laid down the general principles which should, in
their opinion, govern the defence of the Australasian Colonies, and their
views have been embodied in the Colonial Office Circular despatch of the
14th January, 1890. Attack in force upon any of. the ports of these
Colonies is so highly improbable, that it need not be taken into consideration
so long as the squadron in Australasian waters is maintained at the strength
which it will shortly possess. Raids by a small force of cruizers, or a single
cruizer, might, however, be attempted by an enemy, with the object of
obtaining coal or other stores, or in order to destroy shipping and public or
private property. Such a raid might even be attempted with no more
definite object than to create alarm, and to obtain the prestige which might
appear to attach to an operation of no real military importance whatever.
3?rom its geographical position with respect to the possible bases of
other Powers, Queensland is liable to a raid of this nature, which, if under-
taken at all, would probably be attempted at the very outset of war. Such
vessels as are likely to he thus employed would be little able to face
defences on shore, and it would, therefore, be a principal object to deliver
an attack of this nature at a time when it might be hoped that the organi-
zation for defence was incomplete and confusion likely to occur.
Under these circumstances, it appears to the Colonial Defence Com-
mittee that Queensland should be in possession of a scheme of defence such
as now exists in other Colonies, in which all the measures, which might have
to be taken at short notice, are clearly laid down.
Erom this point of view, the scheme under consideration appears to
fall short of the requirements of the Colony. The measures which should
be taken are, for the most part, stated; but the means of carrying them
out do not appear to have been considered, and the consequent arrangements
are not laid down.
Thus, dealing with the defences of the capital, Brisbane, it is of the
utmost importance that a definite scheme of distribution of the available
force should be prepared, showing clearly where each unit of each arm would
come from, how it would be conveyed to its destination, and the time and
means required for the purpose. The general distribution of the forces for
the defence of Brisbane having been fixed, a garrison should be detailed for
each work of defence, and all arrangements for supply fully considered.
Unless this is done, there is no possibility of any proper utilization of the
resources of the Colony to meet a sudden attack, and the armaments which
have been provided at much expense would be practically useless.
[l7l j


The same principles apply to the Colony at large. It should he
decided what ports will he defended; forces should ho specially detailed
for each port, and the duties of the units clearly laid down; all
questions of transport, supply, and relief, if necessary, being fully considered,
so that the distribution of the troops might take place smoothly, and with
the minimum of disturbance to the civil life of the Colony.
Again, it appears of the utmost importance that the system of commands
should he laid down, and that the responsibility for carrying out special
measures should he attached to individual officers or civil officials.
The Colonial Defence Committee do not think it desirable to criticize in
detail the local Report at the present stage; hut they strongly urge that a
copy of their remarks should be forwarded to the Governor, and that the
great importance of dealing definitely and in peace time with such points as
they have referred to may he impressed upon the Government of Queensland.
They arc confident that, if the necessity for the preparation of a clear
and detailed scheme of defence, enabling the available resources to be at once
turned to account in the event of emergency, is more fully realized, the
Colony of Queensland will not be satisfied until the work is accomplished.
