RIFLE EXERCISES AND MUSKETRY INSTRUCTION
FOR CADET CORPS
ARMED WITH THE WESTLEY-RICHARDS AND THE
FRANCOTTE RIFLES.
CHAPTEE I.
RIFLE EXERCISES.
1. General Rules.
1. Cadets, before they commence the Rifle Exercises,
are to be taught the names of the different parts of the rifle
and the care of arms. (See Plate).
2. The Instructor should always be provided with a
rifle when at drill, in order that he may be able to show the
Cadet the required positions and motions. Such practical
instruction should, as far as possible, be substituted for the
minute detail given in the text.
3. Drilling by numbers should be restricted to the
instruction of recruit, and should be curtailed as far as
possible.
4. The rifle exercises are of special importance as being
required on parade in close order and for the ordinary
routine of drill. They must be taught thoroughly, and
carried out with smartness and precision. It is only by
constant practice that the Cadet will become expert in the
handling of his weapon in all positions.
5. For instruction in the Rifle Exercises the squad will
be formed in single rank.


2. The Order.
will fall-in with the rifle held perpendicularly
at his right side, the butt on the ground, its toe in line with
the toe of the right foot. The right arm to be very slightly
bent, back of the hand to the right, thumb against the thigh,
fingers slanting toward- the ground, the left arm to hang
easily from the shoulder, thumb behind the seam of the
trousers.
3. The Stand-at-Ease from the Order.
(Incline the muzzle of the rifle slightly to the
front with the right hand, arm close to the
side, at the same time keeping both legs straight,
carry the left foot about eight inches to the
left, the left arm steady.

2. When arms are inspected at the Port only, as in
inspecting a company on parade, or for the purpose of ascer-
taining that there is not a cartridge in the rifle, each cadet,
when the officer has passed the file next to him, will close the
breech, press the trigger, order arms (closing up one pace
if in the rear rank), stand at ease arid stand easy.
3. If it be necessary to examine arms, as before ball
practice, etc., the cadets will be cautioned to remain at the
Port.
' On the word Examine, the rear rank will take
two paces to tlie front and one of ten inches
„to the right front. On the word Arms, both
ranks will come to the position for loading with
the muzzle of the rifle so inclined as to enable
The officer to look through the barrel.
Examine —
Arms.
The officer will look through each barrel to see that it is
clean and free from rust. The cadet, when the officer has
passed the tile next to him, will close the breech, press the
trigger, order arms (stepping back a pace to the left rear,
and one pace to the rear if in the rear rank), stand at ease,
and stand easy.
10. Guards, Sentries.
Guards, including reliefs, rounds and patrols, will march
with sloped arms. In wet weather, arms will be carried at
the Secure. Sentries are to patrol with armsat the Slope.
11. Paying Compliments with Arms.
When a cadet, carrying a rifle, passes or addresses an
officer he will do so at the Slope, and will salute by carrying
the right hand smartly to the small of the butt, forearm
horizontal, back of the hand to the front, fingers extended,
saluting at the same number of paces, before reaching the
officer, and cutting the hand away, as directed when saluting


without arms. In passing an officer, the cadet will always
turn his head towards him in the same manner as when
unarmed.
A cadet, if halted when an officer passes, will turn
towards him and stand at the Order.
•' \W.y ■ _ ■■ !.>ii _ ■■■
Sentries, when saluting otherwise than by presenting
arms, will carry the right hand to the small of the butt as
directed above.

CHAPTER II.
MUSKETRY INSTRUCTION.
Care and Cleaning of Arms.
24. : General Instructions.
Open the breech ; wipe the inside of the body, the block,
and the cartridge chamber, with an oiled rag to prevent
rust and to remove dirt; then clean the outside of the barrel,
close the breech and press the trigger.
No hard substance, such as emery, sand-paper, etc.,
is ever to be used for cleaning either the inside or outside
of the rifle ; care is to be taken to prevent the browning being
rubbed off the barrel .
No oil other than the special rifle oil issued for the
purpose is to be used. This oil contains a proportion of
caustic soda, the alkaline character of which cauSes it to
neutralises any acid which may be in the fouling, and gener-
ally toi prevent rust. The oil should be well shaken up before
use. : il' ,-ilifi -
To prevent water soaking into the stock, and at the
same time to give it a polished appearance, it should be
well rubbed With raw linseed oil. French polish or varnish
is on ho account to be used.
16


A little beeswax may also be applied between stock
and barrel to prevent water from getting under the latter.
Before using the rifle all dust or sand must be removed,
and the bore should be lightly oiled.
The outside of the action and barrel should be wiped
quite free from oil.
On no account should a piece of rag, cork, wood, or other
substance he kept in the muzzle when the rifle is in the arm-
rack.
25: tB dMn 'di B6fe.
Open the breech, oil tlie gauze of t the pull-through
well with rifle oil, drop the weight through the bore from
the breech, and pull the gauze completely through. Then
insert in the loop nearer the gauze a piece of dry flannelette,
4 indies by 2 inches, and draw it through the barrel as before ;
the flannelette should never_ be pulled , back when, partly
through, as it would probably jam. f
Finally, an oiled piece of flannelette should be drawn
through, and the bore left oily. Close the breeeh, and press
the trigger. .
When the gauze on the pull-through, in consequence of
frequent use, ceaseS to fit the barrel-tightly,- narrow strips of
flannelette or paper may be inserted under each side, to
ipcrease itef diameter. No larger , piece of flannelette than
4 inches by 2 inches .should, ever be used. Water should on
no.account be, used.
The Bore is to' be cleaned immediately, after firing.
After -firing, either .with ball or blank ammunitions the arras
should, whenever practicable, be thoroughly cleaned im-
mediately firing liaff ceased. If this is not, dpue without
loss of time, rust will rapidly appear, which, will spread and
be difficult to remove, even if the barrels are not injured.
When cleaning before returning home is not possible, arms
17


must, under any circumstances, be wiped out with flannelette
soaked in oil immediately firing is over, and thoroughly
cleaned as soon as possible. A supply of oil and flannelette
must always be taken to the rifle range.
It is to be observed that although a rifle in which rust
has been allowed to form may be cleaned so as to be rag
dean, it may be so pitted or rusted that it would not he
view dean — i.e., in a state to be passed by an expert inspector.
It is necessary, therefore, that the greatest care should be
taken to prevent the formation of rust, which can only be
done by strictly carrying out the foregoing instructions.
26. Miscellaneous Instructions as to the Care of Arms.
The greatest care must be taken to prevent the barrel
being bent or dented, as either would be detrimental to
accurate shooting. A rifle must never be used for carrying
weights, or for any other unauthorised purpose. Placing
arms forcibly in a rack, or leaning them carelessly against
a wall or a fence so that they fall down, will often cause
serious damage to the barrel, especially at the muzzle.
Care must be taken not to run the muzzle into the
ground; should this be accidently done, the dirt must
be at once removed, for if the rifle be fired with any ob-
struction in the muzzle the barrel will probably burst.
The fore-sight must be carefully protected from being
injured ; and the rifle should never be carried with the leaf
of the back-sight raised. When not on parade the sight
protector should invariably be kept on the rifle.
The greatest care is to exercised in seeing that the leaf
of the backsight is not injured by bending. The slide must
be lowered immediately after use. If the leaf be lowered
and the slide allowed to remain up, very little pressure will
bend the leaf, and the rifle is made useless for accurate
shooting.


r am ount of pressure required to release the nose
°™ t ”gg er froni th e bent of the tumbler is called the “ pull-
ott. When it is too heavy or too light the defect is to bo
t armourer > must never be attempted by
, bhe direction of the pull-off is not straight backwards
btit slightly upwards, across the small of the butt, and the
trigger should therefore be pressed accordingly. In usine a
ngger-tester it should be held in a line diagonally across the
small of the butt. ‘
The mainspring should never be allowed to remain
compressed, except when the rifle is loaded. The position
ot the indicator shows when the spring is compressed and
when released ; in the former case it is raised, in the latter
it is depressed.
A miss-fire is the non-ignition of a charge. The pro-
portion of those which occur from defective caps is so small
that most miss-fires are probably due—
To a defect in the rifle, which should, on all occasions
when one occurs, be at once examined and tested
as to strength of spring and the protrusion of striker ;
the cartridge should also be tried in another rifle.
Ammunition should be kept perfectly dry. To prevent
cartridge cases jamming in extraction, they must be kert
tree from oil, dust, or sand,
No non-commissioned officer or cadet is ever to attempt
to take to pieces any portion of the action, nor to loosen
or tighten any of the screws.


MUSKETRY EXERCISES.
AIMING DRILL
27. General Rules.
■n r ns^ruc^i°n i n the Musketry Exercises the squad
will be formed in single rank. " !
2. The simplest method of forming single rank from
two ranks is as in Skirmishing Drill. On the command
1 o single rank-—extend ’ the squad, with the exception of
the centre cadet of the front rank, will come to attention,
turn outwards, and move off at the double, carrying the
rifles at the short trail; each rear rank cadet will move up on
the left of his front rank comrade ; on arrival in single rank
each cadet will halt, order arms, turn to the right (or left)
and stand at ease.
3. The object of aiming drill is to teach how to adjust
the backsight and to aim at stationary and moving objects.
This instruction is a most important one, for exactitude in
aim and in the adjustment of the backsight are absolutely
necessary for good rharksmanship.
4. Instruction in aiming will be divided into two stages
preliminary, and advanced.
In the preliminary stage cadets are taught the method
of adjusting sights to give elevation, and to aim with accuracy
at a bulls-eye ’ placed at such a distance as not to be a
strain on the eye. In all school playgrounds, tripods, formed
oi three stakes tied or looped near the top, supporting a bag
of sand, should be provided for practice in aiming the rifle
when standing, and aiming rests should be provided for
practice when lying. Each cadet should be shown a mark


to aim at; for this purpose small black “ bulls-eyes ” the size
of a shilling, on a white ring about two inches in diameter,
should be painted round the school fence 3 feet apart in two*
lines, 3 feet and 18 inches respectively from the ground.
(If the fence is white use white “ bulla-eyes ” on a° black
ring.) Cadets are also to be .instructed in making allowance
for wind, judging how much they should aim to on*' side,
or above or below the mark, .according to the wind that is
actually blowing, the officers correcting them when necessary.
• In the advanced stage natural objects are to te selected,
but this practice should be attempted with cadets only after
thorough instruction in the .preliminary stage.
28. Method of Instruction fn Aiming Drill.
I. Each cadet is to knoiv and understand the*following
three rules for aiming
Ist.—The backsight must be. kept perfectly upright.
2nd.—ln taking aim the left or right eye must be closed,
according to the shoulder from which, the cadet
shoots. ,
3rd.—Aim must be-taken, by aligning the sights on tire
centre of the lowest .part, of,, the bull’s-eye, the
of the foresight being in the centre of and in line
with the shoulders of the V of the backsight.
After the cadets have committed these'three rules to
memory, and have, thoroughly grasped their meaning, each
cadet will adjust his backsight to the distance ordered and
will then balance his rifle on the.sandbag on the tripod and
aim at the mark, with his eye at the point, above and in line
with the butt plate. Having carefully aimed and seen that
the aim is not disturbed when his hand is removed he will
step aside in order that the officer or instructor may see if


his aim is eorrect. Another cadet should then be directed
’ l°°k along the sights and say whether there is
should there he any* the first cUufS
can take a correct aim. This will fix oa,-h ~nf i ++ 1 ! 16

CORRECT.
TOO FINE.
TOO PULL.
. A good plan to adopt at the rifle range, when a cadet is
firing wildly, is for the officer to lie down beside him, place
the edge of the scoring card on the upper edge of the cap
of the backsight, hold it steady while the cadet is aiming
T ! m l )rovise . a “peep sight.” Officers who have
adopted this suggestion have had most satisfactory results.


[b) The correct centering of the foresight in the V of the
backsight.
If this be not done, the consequence is that aim will be
taken to the right or left of the mark. Cadets are to be
warned against incorrect centering, thus: —
(c) The fixing of the eyes on the object, and not on the
foresight.
If the eyes are not directed on the object, the sights
cannot be correctly aligned.
(and) The keeping of the backsight upright.
The rifle must not be canted to either side. If canted
to the right the bullet will strike low and to the right;
canted to the left, low and to the left.
29. Instruction in Firing.
M ijr. • 4V \ A,
1. Instruction in firing will be divided into four stages:
First stage—Loading.
Second stage.—Adjusting the backsight.
Third stage.—Aiming.
Fourth stage.—Pressing the. trigger (firing).
2. After a cadet has been thoroughly trained, firing will
be, carried out on the command standing, lying, kneeling
sitting ;At (object) ; At (distance) ; Fire.

Q. 31—Why are cadsts cautioned .gainst allowing the
barrel to become bent or dented ?
A.—Because cither would be detrimental to good shoot-
ing.
Q. 32.—For what purpose is a rifle forbidden to be used ?
A. —For carrying weights or for any unauthorised pur-
pose.
Q. 33.—1 n what manner are barrels of rifles likely to
receive damage ?
A.—By placing rifles forcibly in a rack, or by leaning
them against a wall or fence carelessly so that they fall down.
Q. 34.—What parts would be most likely to receive
damage if the rifle fell down ?
A. —The muzzle, the foresight, and the back-sight.
Q. 35. —Which part of the rifle is to be particularly
guarded ?
A. —The leaf of the backsight. On cadet rifles the leaf
is very slender. The slide is to be lowered immediately after-
use. If the leaf be lowered and the slide allowed to remain
up any distance, very little pressure will bend the leaf, and
the rifle is then practically useless for accurate shooting.
Q. 36. —What precautions are to be taken with regard
to the foresight ?
A.—lt must be carefully protected from being injured,
and the sight protector must be kept on when not on parade.
Q. 37.—What is done with the sight protector when
you come on prarade ?
A.—lt should be drawn back and turned completely
over to the right and pressed against the nose cap. (Brass
sight protectors are to be removed before coming on parade.
They should be left in the arm rack, or carried in the pocket,
and replaced on the rifles immediately after parade).

Q. 47. —What should be done when a miss-fire occurs ?
A.—The rifle should, be examined at once, and tested
as to the strength of the spring ; the cartridge also should
be tried in another rifle. If a miss-fire is continually occurring
with the same rifle, it should be returned to the Senior
Ordnance Officer, with a written explanation as to what has
happened. , , ,
Q. 48. —In order to prevent cartridge cases jamming

anywhere, with the indicator indicating “ loaded,’’ what
should you do ?
A.—Pick it up, open and close the breech, and, press
the trigger, and never press the trigger in such a ease before
opening the hreech, as the rifle may ball cartridge.

line with the butt-plate. Having carefully aimed and seen
that the aim is not disturbed when his hand is removed,
he will step aside in order that his officer or other instructor
may see if the aim is correct.
Q. 60. —Describe the method of testing the aim.
A.—Another cadet should be directed then to look along
the sights and to say whether there is any error ; should
there be any, the first cadet is to aim again until he can take
a correct aim.
Q. 61.—What is the effect of wind on the bullet ?
A. —Wind, which is ait in motion, will by its pressure
affect the progress of the bullet, driving it to the left of the
bull’s-eye if blowing from the right, and vice versa. If
blowing from the front, it will add to the resistance of the
bullet, and consequently the bullet will drop a little ; if
from the rear by diminishing the resistance it will prevent
the bullet from falling so soon, and consequently it will
strike the target a little higher.
Q. 62. —As no fixed rule laid down to guide the
firer as to the amount of allowance he should make for the
wind, what is he to do ?
A.—He must gain experience from his practice, noticing
how much it is necessary, under different conditions, to direct
his aim to the side from which the wind is blowing, or by giving
it a little more elevation when the wind is from the front,
and a little Iqss when it is from the rear.
ANNUAL COURSE OF MUSKETRY.
Q. 63.—When should the annual course be commenced ?
A. —As early as possible in July.
Q. 64.—8 y what date is the course to be completed ?
A.—Before 31st December in each year.

in a tone of voice loud enough to be heard, the name of the
firer and the result of the shot —r.f/.. Cadet T. Atkins,
magpie, 3.
q. 74._When, and how, must all scores be entered ?
A. —On the practice ground, and in ink. Should an
alteration to a figure become necessary, it is to be effected
by drawing a fine line through it, the new number to be
entered above it, which must be at once verified by the
initials of the officer superintending the practice.

TEN THINGS FOR CADETS TO REMEMBER.
1. Obedience is the first duty of a soldier, young or old.
Those best fitted ultimately to command are those who have
shown they can obey.
2. Your constant duty as a cadet, is to respect the
uniform you wear by good conduct on all occasions, and by
implicit obedience to orders.
3. Do not on any account reply to an officer or non-
commissioned officer when reprimanded for any neglect of
duty.
4. Do not talk in the ranks, nor look about, but give your
whole time and attention to the instructor.
5. Always appear in uniform clean and tidy, and with
your hair cut short.
6. Never appear in a mixture of plain clothes and
uniform.
7. See that every button is polished and buttoned before
you come on parade.
r 8. Do not have any shirt-collar, necktie, pocket hand-
kerchief, or watch chain showing outside your uniform.
9. Have your rifle thoroughly clean before you “ fall in.”
10. When in uniform, coming to, and returning from
parade, let your behaviour in the street be such as to show,
not only your officers, but the general public, that you fully
estimate the responsibilities of the young soldier. Never
lounge about the streets, but walk in an upright and soldierly
manner.


-There can be no better friend than a good
FOUNTAIN PEN.
We have had a large experience in Fountain
Pens, and unhesitatingly recommend the
Swan,” at 12/6 post free, as being one of the
best in the market. Those preferring a larger
pen could not do better than try the “ JUCO ”
at 14/6. We have a large range of cheaper
pens, from 4/6 up, all fitted with 14ct. gold nibs.
Any pen supplied by us may be exchanged if
not satisfactory after one week’s trial.
REPAIRS CAREFULLY and PROMPTLY
ATTENDED TO.
We supply metal cases to clip in pocket for
