CHAPTER I.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints was first organized, in the
Slate of New York, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty, on
the sixth day of April. At its first organization, it consisted of six members. Tha
first instruments of its organization were Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, who re-
ceived their authority and priesthood, or apostleship, by direct revelation from God—
by the voice of God —by the ministering of angels—and by the Holy Ghost. They
claim no authority whatever from antiquity, that is, they never received baptism nor
ordination from any religious system which previously existed; but being commissioned
from on high, they first baptized each other, and then commenced to minister the gos-
pel and its ordinances to others.
The first principle of theology as held by this Church, is Faith in God (he eternal
Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, who verily was crucified for the sins of the world,
and who rose from the dead on the third day, and is now seated at the right hand of
God as a mediator; and in the Holy Ghost who bears record of them, the same to day,
as yesterday, and for ever.*
The second principle is Repentance towards God; that is, all men who believe in tha
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are required to turn away from their sins, to cease from
their evil deeds, and to come humbly before the throne of grace with a broken heart
and a contrite spirit.
The third principle is Baptism, by immersion in water, in the name of the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, for remission of sins;f with the promise of the Holy Ghost to ail
who believe and obey the gospel.
The fourth principle is, the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus Christ, for th»
gift of the Holy Ghost. J This ordinance is to be administered by the apostles, or
elders of the church, upon all those who are baptized into this church.
Through these several sleps of faith and obedience, man is made partaker of tha
Holy Ghost, and numbered with children of God, as one of his Saints : § his name is
then enrolled in the book of the names of the righteous, and it then becomes his duly
to watch, to pray, to deal justly ; and to meet together with the saints as often as cir-
cumstances will admit of; and with them to partake of bread and wine, in remem-
brance of the broken body, and shed blood of Jesus Christ; and in short, to continue
faithful unto the end, in all the duties which are enjoined by the Law of Christ.
It is the duty and privilege of the saints, thus organized upon the everlasting gospel,
to believe in and enjoy all the gifts, powers, and blessings which flow from the Holy
Spirit. Such tor instance, as the gifts of revelations, prophecy, visions, the ministry of
angels, healing the sick by the laying on of hands in the name of Jesus, the working
of miracles, and, in short, all the gifts as mentioned in scripture, or as enjoyed by tha
ancient saints. ||
This is a brief outline of the doctrine of this church; and we believe that it is the
only system of doctrine which God ever revealed to man in a gospel dispensation, and
the only system which can be maintained by the New Testament.
* Acts Tiii. 37. f Ads ii. SB. Act xxii. 15. Romans vi. j Acts viii. 17, 18.
Acts xix. 6. { John iii. 5, || Ist Cor. xii.


Now m far as al other modern religious systems differ from the foregoing nrinci-
pies, so far we d.sfellowshtp them. We neither recognize their priesthood nor ordi-
nances as divine. But at the same time we wish well to the individuals of all societies
we believe that many of them are sincere, and that they have a right to cniov their re ’
Lgious opinions in peace We do not wish to persecute any people for •
SS J°„ l . nstr t uct them f? ? ose P rinci which we consider to be right as faJ
as they are willing to receive instruction, but no farther. 6
We also believe that the scriptures of the Old and New Testaments are true; and
LriS a f e i esi « ned IOTl 0T our P ro , fi t and learning, and that all mystical or private Inter-
pretation of them ought to be done away;* that the prophecies and doctrine the
covenants and promises contained in them have a literal application, according to
themost plain easy and simple meaning of the language in which they are written
We believe that the scriptures, now extant, do not contain all the sacred writings
which God gave to man ; for it is a fact easily demonstrated, that they contain a small
portion, indeed, of the things which God has made known to our race; for it is evi-
dent, that a communication has been kept open between God and man, from the days
ol Adam to the present day, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people • except
such communication has been withheld by reason of transgression. Thousands of com-
munications were received before the Bible began to be written. Thousands of com-
munications were received daring the progress of these writings, besides those which
are written in it, and thousands of communications have been received since the Bible
was completed. Thousands of communications have also been received among other
nations, and in other countries remote from the scenes were the Bible was written.
And in short, the Holy Ghost is a spirit of revelation and prophecy, and wherever it
has been enjoyed by mankind, there communications from God have been received. In
the following list, will be found the names of inspired books, which have been lost
but which God has promised to restore again, in this dispensation, which is to usher m
the mtllenial kingdom, see Acta, 3 ch., 19, 20, 21 verses.

We, therefore, believe in the Book of Mormon, which is an ancient American record
lately discovered, containing a sketch of the history, prophecies, and doctrine of the
ancient nations who inhabited that country ; which book has come forth in direct ful-
filment of prophecy. (See Isaiah c. xxix.)
And we also believe in many communications, which God has been pleased to make
to us, in the rise and progress of this church ; as he has often revealed his word to us
by visions, by dreams, by angels, by his own voice, and by the Holy Spirit of prophecy
and revelation.f J
We believe that God will continue to reveal himself to us, until all things are re-
vealed, concerning the past, present, and future ; until we have come in possession of
all the knowledge, intelligence, or truth which is in existence, j; We believe that the
Jews, and all the house of Israel, will soon be gathered home to their own lands, from
all the countries where they have been dispersed ; and that they will become one
nation in the land upon the mountains of Israel, never more to be divided, or over-
come, and that they will all be brought to a knowledge of God, and will become a holy
nation. §

We also believe that Jesus Christ will come in person, in the clouds of heaven, with
power and great glory, and all the saints with him, to reign on the earth a thousand
years; and that he will destroy the wicked from the earth, by terrible judgments, at
the time of his coming.*
We also believe that the saints will rise from the dead, at his second coming, aad
that they will live and reign, on the earth, one thousand years. We do not believe,
that the wicked will rise from the dead, until the thousand years are ended; but
that their resurrection is after the millennium, and connected with the last judg-
jjjgnt.f
We further believe that the restoration of Israel and Judah, and the second advent of
Messiah, are near at hand; and that the generation now lives, who will witness the
fulfilment of these great events; and that the Lord has raised up the church of Latter
Day Saints, and has set the truth in order among them, as a commencement of this
great restoration. J
It will be proper, however, before leaving this subject, to contradict certain reports,
which are in circulation, concerning our principles in regard to property, and also in
regard to matrimony. It is a current report, and often credited by those who have no
acquaintance with our society, that we hold our property in common. This is a base
falsehood without a shadow of truth. The members of this church have ever held
their property individually, the same as other societies, with the exception of that
which they freely give for the use of the society, to minister to the wants of the poor,
and for the building of houses of worship, &c. The property thus given is managed
by proper officers, who render a strict account of all their incomes and expendiiures,
and who have no right to apply one dollar for any other purpose than that for which it
is given.
It is also a current report among the ignorant, that we do away matrimony, and that
we allow of unlawful intercourse between the sexes. Now, this idea originated, and
has been kept alive by wicked and designing persons, and by the credulity of those
who are more willing and ready to believe a falsehood, than they are to believe the
truth. There has never been the shadow of anything to cause such a report; on the
contrary, our principles on this subject have been extensively published, both trom the
press and pulpit. We believe that it is lawful that a man should have one wife, and that they
are bound together until death shall separate them, and that all adultery and fornication are
strictly forbidden by the word of God, and in all our rules and regulations as a church
and society ; and whosoever is guilty of such abominations cannot inherit the kingdom
of God, without a strict repentance and reformation; and, without this, they can have
no place in our society.
There are many other reports in circulation which we think unworthy of any parti-
cular notice by way of contradiction, as they are in themselves too foolish and absurd,
to do a candid public, or ourselves, any harm. There is one story, however, which
I will notice here, because some religious journals have given some credit to it. It is
the story of Solomon Spaulding, writing a romance of the ancient inhabitants of Ame-
rica, which is said to be converted by Mr. Sidney Higdon into the Book of Mormon.
This is another base fabrication got up by the devil, and his servants , to deceive the
world. Mr. Sidney Higdon never saw the Book of Mormon until it had been published
more than six months; it was then presented to him by the author of this history. The
Book of Mormon is not a romance, but a record of eternal truth, which will stand
when heaven and earth shall pass away. It bears abundant evidence upon the face of
it, to show lo any candid reader of the least literary discernment, that there never was
the shadow of romance in its origin. It is reported of our society that they feel a dis-
position to stir up the Indians to hostilities against the whites. This is also without
foundation or truth.
We are true Americans, we love our country and its institutions; we wish all war
and bloodshed to come lo an end. We are also friends to the red men, as human beings,
and, more especially, as descendants of Israel. We wish them to become acquainted
with the fact, that they are descendants of Israel, and, also, with the knowledge of
Jesus Christ, which was had among their fathers ; and that they may repent and obey tho

During the summer and autumn of 1831, many families of our society from New
ork and from Ohio, emigrated to Missouri. They purchased lands in Jackson Coumv
and made improvements in agriculture, and in many of the useful branches of me’
chanism Iney established a printing press and a mercantile establishment and

Ihe same year, P. P. Pratt, assisted by E Fordham, introduced it into the city of
. w York, where it has gradually spread until now, gathering a society in the city and
in various parts of the country around, and up to the autumn of 1839, it is still spread-
mg m almost every country where it is known, and we anticipate a time, notfardis-
tant, when a knowledge of this system of theology will be enjoyed by all the nations
of the earth, for, for this end was it sent into the world. The apostles and elders of this
church have a special mission to fulfil, to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people
uoder heaven; and this is (he gospel of the kingdom which was to be preached, for
a testimony unto ail nations, and then shall the Son of Man come. If the people
oppose this great mission, it will only injure themselves. It will not hinder the rolling
forth of the work of God, nor the fulfilment of his purposes; for he has set his hand
the second time to bring about the Restoration of Israel, with the fulness of the Gen-
tiles." — Pratt's History.
CHAPTER II.
Soon after we commenced our settlement in Jackson county, Missouri, a spirit of
persecution began to evince itself, which finally resulted in the murder of some of our
brethren, the ravishing ot women, add the final expulsion, in 1839, of our whole
society Turn that worse than barbarous state, under circumstances the most fearful, and
of the most painful nature. In the midst of this horrible persecution, while many of our
brethren were in prison, and the main body of the society crowded together in the city


of Far West, without sufficient food, and many without shelter from the weather, and
a sentence of extermination hovering, as it were, over their heads, and ready to fall
upon them; they thought it best to ask the Government for justice and protection,
and to this end they drew up the following
Memorial to the Legislature of Missouri.
To the Honorable Legislature of the State of Missouri, in Senate and House of Repre-
sentatives convened.
We, the undersigned petitioners, inhabitants of Caldwell county, Missouri, incon-
sequence of the late calamity that has come upon us, taken in connection with former
afflictions, feel it a duty we owe to ourselves and our country, to Jay our case before
your honorable body for consideration.
It is a well known fact, that a society of our people commenced settling in Jackson
county, Missouri, in the summer of 1831, where they, according to their ability, pur-
chased lands and settled upon them, with the intention and expectation of becoming
permanent citizens, in common with others.
Soon after the settlement began, persecution began; and as the society increased,
persecution also increased ; until the society, at last, was compelled to leave the county.
And although an account of these persecutions has been published to the world, yet we
feel that it will not be improper to notice a few of the most prominent items in this
memorial.
On the 20th of July, 1833, a mob convened at Independence, a committee of which
called upon a few of the men of our church there, and stated to them that the store,
printing office, and indeed all other mechanic shops must be closed forthwith, and that
the society leave the county immediately. The following is a copy of a declaration,
which was signed by the mob at the commencement of their operations, in 1833 ; and
it may be considered as their articles of agreement in conspiring against the laws of
the land ; and the very foundation of that awful scene which has well nigh destroyed
a flourishing society of many thousands, and involved the whole State in irretrievable
ruin.
“ We, the undersigned, citizens of Jackson county, believing that an important crisis
is at hand, as regards our civil society, in consequence of a pretended religious sect of
people, that have settled and are still settling in our county, styling themselves Mor-
mons:* and intending as we do to rid our society, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we
must: and believing as we do, that the arm of the civil law does not afford us a guaran-
tee, or at least a sufficient one, against the evils which are now inflicted upon us, and
seem to be increasing by the said religious sect; deem it expedient and of the highest
importance, to form ourselves into a company for the better and easier accomplishment
of our purpose; a purpose which we deem it almost superfluous to say, is justified as
well by the law of nature as by the law of self-preservation. It is now more than two
years since the first of the fanatics or knaves (for one or the other they undoubtedly are)
made their first appearance amongst us; and pretending as they did, and now do, to
hold personal communion and converse, face to face, with the most high God—to receive
communications and revelations direct from Heaven —to heal the sick by laying on hands
—and in short, to perform all the wonder-working miracles wrought by the inspired
apostles and prophets of old. We believe them deluded fanatics, or weak and design-
ing knaves; and that they and their pretensions would soon pass away ; but in this we
were deceived. The arts of a few designing leaders amongst them have thus far suc-
ceeded in holding them together as a society, and since the arrival of the first of them,
they have been daily increasing in numbers, and if they had been respectable citizens'
in society, and thus deluded, they would have been entitled to our pity rather than to
our contempt and hatred. They brought into our country little or no property,
and left less behind them ; and we infer, that those only, yoked themselves to the Mor-
mon car, who had nothing earthly or heavenly to lose by the change. But their conduct
here, stamped their conduct in their true colours. More than a year since it was ascer-
tained that they had been tampering with our slaves, and endeavouring to sow dissen-
tions and to raise seditions amongst them. Of this, their Mormon leaders were informed;
and said that they would deal with any of their members who should again in like case
* The Society never styled themselves Mormons, it i§ a name vulgarly attached to
them. The true name is “ Latter Day Saints.”


Qffend. But how specious are appearances. In a late number of the Star, published
in Independence, by the leader of this sect there is an article inviting free negroes and
mulattoes from other states, to become Mormons, and remove and settle among us
This exhibits them in still more odious colors. It manifests a desire on the part of that
society to inflict on our society an injury that they knew would be to us insupportable
and one ot the surest means of driving us from the county; for it would require none
of the supernatural gifts that they pretend to, to see that the introduction of such a
caste among us, would corrupt our blacks and instigate them to bloodshed.
Ihey openly blaspheme the most High God and cast contempt upon his Holy Re-
ligion, by pretending to receive revelations direct from Heaven—by pretending to speak
in unknown tongues by direct inspiration—and by divers pretences derogatory of God
and religion, and to the utter subversion of human reason. They do declare openly
that God hath given them this county of land, and that sooner or later, they must and
will have possession of our lands for an inheritance; and in fine they have conducted
themselves on many occasions in such a manner, that we believe it a duty we owe to
ourselves, to our wives and children, and to the cause of public morals, to remove them
from among us. We are not prepared to give up our pleasant places and goodly pos-
sessions to them ; or to receive into the bosom of our families as fit companions for our
wives and daughters, the degraded free negroes and mulattoes, who are now invited to
settle among us. Under such a state of things, even our beautiful county would cease
to be a desirable residence, and our situation intolerable. We therefore agree that
after timely warning, and upon receiving an adequate compensation for what little’pro-
perty they cannot take with them, they refuse to leave us in peace as they found us
we agree to use such means as may be sufficient to remove them. And to that end’
we severally pledge to each other, our lives, our bodily powers, fortunes, and honors'
We will meet at the Court House in the town of Independence, on Saturday next, to
consult of ulterior movements.”
Hundreds of signatures were signed to the foregoing paper.
Before I proceed with this history, I will briefly notice a few items of the foregoing
bond of conspiracy, for I consider most of it as too barefaced to need any com-
ment.
In the first place, I would inquire whether our belief as set forth in this declaration,
as to gifts, miracles, revelations, and tongues, is not the same that all the apostles
and disciples taught, believed, and practiced, and the doctrine of the New Testa-
ment ?
Secondly -I would inquire when the New Testament religion ceased, and a law re-
vealed or instituted, which made blasphemy of the belief and practice of it ?or what
holy religion the Jackson mob were speaking of, which w r as thrown into contempt by
the revival of the New Testament religion ?
Thirdly—They complain of our Society being very poor as to property; but have
they never read in the New Testament that God had chosen the poor in this world,
rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom of God ? And when did poverty become a
crime known to the law ?
Fourthly—Concerning free negroes and mulattoes. Do not the laws of Missouri
provide abundantly for the removal from the state of all free negroes and mulattoes ?
(except certain privileged oens ;) and also for the punishment of those who introduce
or harbor them ? The statement concerning our invitation to them to become Mor-
mons, and remove to this state, and settle among us, is a wicked fabrication, as no such
thing was ever published in the Star, or anywhere else, by our people, nor anything in
the shape of it; and we challenge the people of Jackson, or any other people to
produce such a publication from us.
In fact, one dozen free negroes or mulattoes never have belonged to our society in any
part of the world, Irom its first organization to this day, 1839.
Fifthly—As to crime or vice, we solemnly appeal to all the records of the courts of
Jackson county, and challenge the county to produce the name of any individual of
our society on the list of indictments, from the time of our first settlement in the
county, to the lime of our expulsion, a period of more than two years.
Sixthly —As it respects the ridiculous report of our threatening that we would have
their lands for a possession, it is too simple to require a notice, as the laws of the
country guarantee to every man his rights, and abundantly protect him in their full
enjoyment. And we hereby declare that we settled no lands only such as our money


purchased, and that no such thing ever entered our hearts, as possessing any inheritance
in any other way. And
Seventhly—We ask what public morals were in danger of being corrupted, where
officers of the peace could openly violate their several oaths in the most awful manner,
and join with hundreds o t others in murder, treason, robbery, house burning, stealing,
&c .—Pratt’s History.
These propositions were so unexpected, that a certain time was asked for, to con-
sider on the subject, before an answer should be returned; which was refused, and our
men being individually interrogated, each one answered that he could not consent to
comply with their propositions. One of the mob replied that he was sorry, for the
work of destruction would commence immediately. In a short time, the printing office,
which was a two-story brick building, was assailed by the mob and soon thrown down,
and with it much valuable property destroyed. Next, they went to the store for the
same purpose, but Mr. Gilbert, one of the owners, agreeing to close it, they abandoned
their design. Their next move was, their dragging ot Bishop Partridge from his house
and family to the public square, where surrounded by hundreds, they partially stripped
him of his clothes, and tarred and feathered him from head to foot.* This
was Saturday, and the mob agreed to meet the following Tuesday, to accomplish their
purpose of driving or massacreing the society. Tuesday came, and the mob came also,
bearing with them a red flag, in token of blood. Some two or three of the principal
men of the society offered their lives, if that would appease the wrath of the mob, so
that the society might dwell in peace upon their lands. The answer was, that unless
the society would leave “en masse," every man should die for himself. Being in a
defenceless situation, to save a general massacre, it was agreed that one-half of the
society should leave the county by the first of the next January, and the re-
mainder by the first of the following April. A treaty was entered into and ratified,
and all went on smoothly for a while. After this, an express was sent to the Governor
of the State, stating the facts of the outrages, and praying for some relief and protec-
tion- But none was afforded, only some advice for us to prosecute the offenders, which
was accordingly undertaken But this so enraged the mob that they began to make
preparations to come out by night and re-commence depredations.
But some time in October the wrath of the mob began again to be kindled, inso-
much, that they shot at some of our people, whipped others, and threw down their
houses, and committed many other depredations; indeed, the society of Saints was
harrassed for some time both day and night—their houses were brick-batted and broken
open—women and children insulted, &c.
“ Having passed through the most aggravating insults and injuries without making
the least resistance, a general inquiry prevailed at this time throughout the church as
to the propriety of self-defence. Some claimed the right of defending themselves, their
families, and property from destruction ; while others doubted the propriety of self-
defence; and as the agreement of the 23rd of July, between the two parties had been
published to the world, wherein it was set forth, that the Mormons were not to leave
until the Ist of April, 1834; it was believed by many of the Mormons that the leaders
of the mob would not suffer so bare-faced a violation of the agreement before the time
therein set forth; but Thursday night, the 31st of October, gave them abundant proof
that no pledge, verbal or written, was longer to be regarded ; for on that night, between
forty and fifty, many of whom were armed with guns, proceeded against a branch of
the church, about eight miles west of town, and unroofed and paitly demolished ten
dwelling-houses; and in the midst of the shrieks and screams of women and children
whipt and beat, in a savage manner, several of the men ; and, with their horrid threats,
frightened women and children into the wilderness. Such of the men as could escape,
fled for their lives; for very few of them had arms, neither were they embodied ; and
they were threatened with death if they made any resistance. Such, therefore, ns
could not escape by flight, received a pelting by rocks, and a beating by guns and
whips.”---P» - a<£’s History.
The store-house of A. S. Gilbert and Co., was broken open, ransacked, and some of
the goods strewd in the streets.
• A Baptist Minister, the Rev. Isaac M'Coy, held the tar bucket, while they tarred
and feathered this worthy man. A man by the name of Allen was also tarred at the
same time.

This so alarmed them that they fled in different directions ; some took shelter in the
woods, while others wandered in the prairies till their feet bled. In the meantime the
weather being very cold, their sufferings in other respects were very great.
“ One party of about a hundred and fifty women and children, fled to the prairie
where they wandered for several days, mostly without food, and nothing but the open
firmament lor their shelter.’ ".-Pratt’s History. “ And in this exposed Situation three
women gave birth to children.—-Green’s History, *
The society made their escape to Clay county as fast as they possibly could, where
the people received them kindly and administered to their wants. After the society
had left Jackson county, their buildings, amounting to about two hundred, were either
burned or otherwise destroyed, and much of the crops, as well as furniture stock &c
which, if properly estimated, would make a large sum, for which they have not as vet
received any remuneration. J
“ When the news of these outrages reached the Governor of the state, courts of in-
qmry, both civil and military, were ordered by him; but nothing effectual was ever
done to restore our rights, or to protect us in the least. It is true, the attorney-general
with a military escort and our witnesses, went to Jackson county and demanded in’-
dictments, but the court and jurors refused to do anything in the case, and the military
and witnesses wore mobbed out of the county, and thus that matter ended. The Go-
vernor also ordered them to restore our arms which they had taken from us, but they
never were restored; and even our lands in that county were robbed of their t-’raber
and either occupied by our enemies for years, or left desolate.”— Pratt’s History op’
51 and 52.
CHAPTER III.
The Society remained in Clay county nearly three years; when, at the suggestionof
the people there, they removed to that section of the’ country, known as Caldwell
county.
“ Soon after Jackson county had rebelled against the laws and constitution, several
of the adjoining counties followed her example by justifying her proceedings, and by
opposing the saints in settling among them ; and soon this rebellion became general in
the upper country. The counties of Clay, Ray, Clinton, and various others, held public
meetings, the tenor of which was, to deprive the members of our society of citizen-
ship. and to drive them from among them, and force them to settle only in such places
as the mob should dictate j and even at that time in some of their proceedings they
went so far as to publicly threaten to drive the whole society from the state. The
excuses they offered for these outrages, were,
“ First—The society were. principally guilty of being eastern or northern
people.
“ Second—They were guilty of some slight variations, in manners and language,
from other citizens of the slate.


'‘Third—Their religious principles differed in some important particulars from most
other societies.
t “Fourth—They were guilty of emigrating rapidly from the different states, and of
purchasing large quantities of land, and of being more enterprising and industrious
than some of their neighbours.
“Fifth—Some of our society were guilty of poverty, especially those who had
been driven from time to time from their possessions, and robbed of their all.
“And lastly—They were said to be guilty of believing in the present government
administration of Indian affairs, viz : that the land west of the Mississippi, which go-
vernment has deeded in fee simple to the emigrating tribes, was destined by Providence
for their permanent homes.
“ All these crimes were charged upon our society, in the public proceedings of the
several counties; and were deemed sufficient to justify their unlawful proceedings
against us. The reader may smile at the statement, but the public journals published
in that county, in 1835, actually printed charges and declarations against us of the
tenor of the foregoing. By these wicked proceedings our people were once more com-
pelled to remove, at a great sacrifice of property, and were at last permitted to settle in
the north of Ray county; where, by the next legislature, they were organised into the
counties of Caldwell and Davies. Here they again exerted the utmost industry and
enterprise, and these wild regions soon presented a more flourishing aspect than the
the oldest counties of the upper country. In the mean time a majority of the state
so far countenanced these outrages, that they actually elected Lilburn W. Boggs, one
of the old mobbers of Jackson county, who had assisted in the treason, murder, and
house-burning, plundering, robbery, and driving out of twelve hundred citizens, in
1833, for governor of the state, and placed him in the executive chair, instead of a soli-
tary cell in the state penitentiary, as his crimes justly deserved This movement may
be said to have put an end to liberty, law, and government in that state.— Trait’s His-
tory, pp. 52, 53, and 54.
Here the people purchased out most of the former inhabitants, and also entered much
of the wild land, (Public Domain.) Many soon owned a uumber of eighties, (eighty
acres) while there was scarcely a man who did not secure to himself at least a forty,
(forty acres.) Here we were permitted to enjoy peace for a season ; but as our society
increased in numbers, and settlements were made in Davies and Carrol counties, the
mob spirit spread itself again.
For months previous to our giving up our arms to General Lucas’ army, we heard
little else, than rumors of mobs, collecting in different places, and threatening our
people. It is well known, that the people of our church who bad located themselves
at De Witt, had to give up to a mob and leave the place, notwithstanding the militia
were called out for their protection. From De Witt, the mob went towards Davies
county, and while on their way there they took two of our men prisoners and made
them ride upon the cannon, and told them that they would drive the Mormons from
Davies to Caldwell and from Caldwell to hell, and that they w'ould give them no quar-
ter only at the cannon’s mouth.
“ They had one field-piece, and were headed by a Presbyterian priest by the name of
Serciel Woods, who, it is said tended prayer night and morning, at the head of the
gang. In this siege, they say that they killed a number of our people. They also
turned one Smith Humphrey and his wife and children out of doors, when sick, and
set fire to their house, and burned it to ashes before their eyes. At length they suc-
ceeded in driving every citizen from the place, to the sacrifice of every thing which
they could not take with them.--JVa<*’s History, p. 61.
The threats of the mob induced some of our people to go to Davies to help to pro-
tect their brethren who had settled at Diahman, on Grand River.
The mob soon fled from Davies county ; and after they were dispersed and the
cannon taken, during which time no blood was shed, the people of Caldwell returned
to their homes, in hopes of enjoying peace and quiet; but in this they were disap-
pointed; for a large mob was soon found to be collecting on the Grindstone River,
from ten to fifteen miles off, under the command of C. Gillman, a scouting party of
which, came within four miles of Far West, and drove off stock belonging to our
people, in open daylight. About this time word came to Far West, that a party of the
mob had come into Caldwell county to the eouth of Far West—that they were taking
horses and cattle—burning houses, and ordering the inhabitants to leave their homes


immediately and that they had then actually in their possession three men prisoner*,
i his report reached tar W est m the evening, and was confirmed about midnight * A
company of about sixty men went forth under the command of David W Patten Z
disperse the mob, as they supposed.f A battle was the result, in which Cant Pa ten
and two of his men were killed, and others wounded. Bogart, it appears, ha ? d but one
killed and others wounded. Notwithstanding the unlawful acts committed by Captain
Bogart s men previous to the battle, it is now asserted and claimed that he was regu-
lar y ordered out as a militia captain, to preserve the peace along the line of Ray and
Caldwell counties. That battle was fought four or five days previous to the arrival of
General Lucas and his army. About the time of the battle with Captain Bogart, a
number of our people who were living near Haun’s mill, on Shoal Creek, about twenty
miles below Far West, together with a number of emigrants who had been stopped
there in consequence of the excitement, made an agreement with the mob which was
about there, that neither party would molest the other, but dwell in peace. Shortly
after this agreement was made, a mob party of from two to three hundred many of
whom are supposed to be from Chariton county, some from Davies, and also those who
had agreed to dwell in peace, came upon our people there, whose number in men was
about thirty, at a time they little expected any such thing, and without any ceremony,
notwithstanding they begged for quarters, shot them down as they would tigers or pan-
thers. Some few made their escape by fleeing. Eighteen were killed, and a number
more severely wounded.
I his tragedy was conducted in the most brutal and savage manner. An old man
after the massacre was partially over, threw himself into their hands and begged for
quarters, when he was instantly shot down : that not killing him they took an old corn
cutter and literally mangled him to pieces. A lad of ten years of age, after being shot
down, also begged to be spared, when one of them placed the muzzle of his gun to his
head and blew out his brains. The slaughter of these people not satisfying the mob
they then proceeded to mob and plunder the people. The scene that presented itself
after the massacre, to the widows and orphans of the killed, is beyond description. It
was truly a time of weeping, of mourning, and of lamentation. As yet we have not
heard of any being arrested for these murders, notwithstanding there are men boasting
about the country, that they did on that occasion kill more than one Mormon, whereas
all our people who were in the battle with Captain Patten against Bogart, that can be
found, have been arrested, and are now confined in jail to await their trial for
murder.
The following extract of an affidavit of Mr. Joseph Young, contains some additional
particulars in relation to this horrid massacre :
“ It was about four o’clock, while sitting in my cabin with my babe in my arms,:
and my wife standing by my side, the door being open, I cast my eyes on the opposite
bank of Shoal-creek, and saw a large company of armed men, on horses, directing
their course towards the mills with all possible speed. As they advanced through the
scattering trees that stood on the edge of the prairie, they seemed to form themselves
into a three-square position, forming a van guard in front. At this moment, David
Evans, seeing the superiority of their numbers, (there being 240 of them, according to
their own account,) swung his hat, and cried for peace. This not being heeded, they
continued to advance, and their leader, Mr. Comstock, fired a gun, which was followed
by a solemn pause of ten or twelve seconds, when all at once, they discharged about
100 rifles, aiming at a blacksmith'shop into which our friends fled for safety; and charging
up to the shop, the cracks of which between the logs were sufficiently large to enable
them to aim directly at the bodies of those who had there fled for refuge from the fire of
* This mob was commanded by one Samuel Bogart, a Methodist Preacher, who told
his men that in thus driving our brethren, they were doing God service.
f Captain Patten and his men were a part of the regularly organized militia of Cald-
well county, and on this occasion were ordered out by Colonel George M. Hinkle,
their legally authorised Colonel, who held his commission from the Governor of the
State, but as Caldwell county was mostly settled by our brethren, of course they
formed the principal part of its militia. In the United States, every male citizen, be-
tween the ages of eighteen and forty-five, U obliged, by law, to perform military
duty.


their murderers. There were several families tented in the rear of the shop, whose
lives were exposed, and amidst a shower of bullets fled to the woods in different direc-
tions.
After standing and gazing on this bloody scene for a few minutes, and finding myself
in the uttermost danger, the bullets having reached the house where I was living, I
committed my family to the protection of Heaven, and leaving the house on the opposite
side, I took a path which led up the hill, following in the trail of three of my brethren
that had fled from the shop. While ascending the hill we were discovered by the mob,
who immediately fired at us, and continued so to do till we reached the summit. In
descending the hill I secreted myself in. a thicket of bushes, where I lay till eight o’clock
in the evening, at which time I heard a female voice calling my name in an undertone,
telling me that the mob had gone, and there was no danger. I immediately left the
thicket, and went to the house of Benjamin Lewis, where I found my family, (who had
fled there,) in safety, and two of my friends mortally wounded, one of whom died be-
fore morning.
“ Here we passed the painful night in deep and awful reflections on the scenes of the
preceding evening. After daylight appeared, some four or five men, with myself, who
had escaped with our lives from the horrid massacre, repaired as soon as possible to the
mills, to learn the condition of our friends, whose fate we had but too truly anticipated.
“ When we arrived at the house of Mr. Haun, we found Mr. Merrick’s body lying
in the rear of the house; Mr. M’Bride’s in front, literally mangled from head to foot. We
were informed by Miss Rebecca Judd, who was an eye witness, that he was shot with
his own gun, after he had given it up, and then cut to pieces with a corn cutler, by a
Mr. Rogers of Davies county, who keeps a ferry on Grand River, and who has since
repeatedly boasted of this act of savage barbarity. Mr. York’s body we found in the
house, and after viewing these corpses, we immediately went to the blacksmith shop,
where we found nine of our friends, eight of whom were already dead ; the other, Mr.
Cox, of Indiana, struggling in the agonies of death, who expired. We immediately
prepared and carried them to the place of interment. This last office of kindness due
to the relicts of departed friends was not attended with the customary ceremonies, nor
decency, for we were in jeopardy, every moment expecting to be fired upon by the
mob, who, we supposed, were lying in ambush, waiting for the first opportunity to
dispatch the remaining few who were providentially preserved from the slaughter of
the preceding day. However, we accomplished, without molestation, this painful task.
The place of burying was a vault in the ground, formerly intended for a well, into
which we threw the bodies of our friends promiscuously.
“ Among those slain I will mention Sardius Smith, son of Warren Smith, about 9
years old, who, through fear, had crawled under the bellows in the shop, where ho
remained till the massacre was over, when he was discovered by a Mr. Glaze, of Carroll
county, who presented his rifle near the boy’s head and litterally blowed off the upper
part of it. Mr. Stanley of Carroll told me afterwards that Glaze boasted of this fiendlike
murder and heroic deed all over the country.
“The number killed and mortally wounded in this wanton slaughter was 18 or 19,
whose names, as far as I recollect, were as follows : Thomas M’Bride, Levi Merrick,
Elias Benner, Josiah Fuller, Benjamin Lewis, Alexander Campbell, Warren Smith,
Sardius Smith, Geo. Richards, Mr. Napier, Mr. Harmer, Mr. Cox, Mr. Abbott, Mr.
York, Wm. Merrick, (a boy 8 or 9 years old,) and three or four others, whose names I
do not recollect, as they were strangers to me.
“Among the wounded who recovered were Isaac Laney, Nathan K. Knight, Mr.
Yokum, two brothers by the name of Myers, Tarlton Lewis, Mr. Haun, and several
others. Miss Mary Stedwell while fleeing was shot through the hand, andjfainting, fell
over a log, into which they shot upwards of twenty balls.
“ To finish their work of destruction this band of murderers, composed of men from
Davies, Livingston, Ray, Carroll, and Chariton counties, led by some of the principal
men of that section of the upper country, (among whom I am informed were Mr. Ash-
by, from Chariton, member of the State Legislature, Col. Jennings of Livingston
county, Thomas O. Bryon, Clerk of Livingston co., Mr. Whitney, Dr. Randal, and
many others,) proceeded to rob the houses, wagons and tents, of bedding and clothing,
drove off horses and wagons, leaving widows and orphans destitute of the necessaries
of life, and even stripped the clothing from the bodies of the slain !
“ According to their own account, they fired seven rounds in this awful butchery,

We gave up our arms without reluctance; we were then made prisoners, and confined
to the limits of the town for about a week, during which time (he men from the country
were not permitted to go to their families, many of whom were in a suffering conditioJl

was des royed by the troops in town, during their stay there ; such as burning ho^se-

he kdhng of cattle, sheep, and hogs, and also the taking of horses not their own and
all this without regard to owners, or asking leave of any one. In the mean time men
were abused, women insulted and abused by the troops, and all this while we were
kept prisoners. Whilst the town was guarded, we were called together by the order of
General Lucas, and a guard placed close around us and in that situation, were com-
peted to sign a deed of trust for the purpose of making our individual property all
holden, as they said, to pay all the debts of every individual belonging to the church
and also to pay for all damages the old inhabitants of Davies may have sustained in '
consequence of the late difficulties in that county. ’
General Clark was now arrived ; and the first important move made by him was the
collecting of our men together on the square, and selected out about fifty of them
whom he immediately marched into a house, and confined close ; this was done without
he aid of a sheriff or any legal process. The next day 46 of those taken were driven
1^ e ( fl f F arCe of raenial slaves off t 0 Richmond, not knowing why they were taken, or
what they were taken for. '
“ \\ e were now marched to Far West, and each one was permitted to go with a guard
and take a final leave of our families, in order to depart as prisoners, to Jackson county
a distance of some 60 miles. This was the most trying scene of all. I went to mv
house, being guarded by two or three soldiers. The rain was pouring down without
and on entering my little cottage, there lay my wife, sick of a fever, with which she
hau been for some time confined. At her breast was an infant three months old and
by her side a little girl three years of age. These constituted my household, no’othe-
person belonged to my family. On the foot of the same bed lay a woman in travail'
who had been driven from her house in the night, and had taken momentary shelter
in my little but of ten feet square, (my larger house having been torn down.) I stepped
to the bed*—she burst into tears—l spakr? a few words of comfort, telling her to frV to
live for my sake, and her little babes, and expressing a hope that we should meet again
though years might separate us. She promised to try to live, and though an age should *
separate us, we would live for each other. I then kissed (he little babes and departed. *
Till now 1 had refrained from weeping, but to be forced from so helpless a family, who
were destitute ot provisions and fuel, in a bleak prairie with none to assist them, and
exposed to a lawless banditti, who were utter strangers to humanity, and this at the
approach of winter, was more than nature could well bear. I went to General Wtlson
m tears, and stated the circumstances of my sick, heart-broken and destitute family, in
terms which would have moved any heart that )iad a latent spark of humanity vet
remaining. But I was only answered with an exulting laugh, and a taunt of triumph
from this hardened murderer. '


" As t returned from my house towards the main body of the army who were to con
’duct us, I halted with the guard at tiio door of Hyrnm Smith, and heard the sobs and
groans of his wife, at his parting words. She was about to be confined in child-birth,
when he left her to accompany us. As we returned to the wagon we saw S. Rigdou
taking leave of his wife and daughters, who stood at a little distance in tears of anguish
inexpressible; whilst in the wagon sat Joseph Smith; while his aged father and vener-
able mother came up overwhelmed in tears, and took us all by the hand.
“In the mean time, hundreds of the brethren crowded around us, anxious to take a
parting look, or a silent shake of the hand, for feelings were too intense to allow of
speech. In the midst of these scenes, orders were given, and we moved slowly on, sur-
rounded by a brigade of Jackson and Van Buren county troops. After marching about
twelve miles, we. encamped for the night on Crooked River. Here General Wilson
began to treat us more kindly; he became very sociable, conversing freely on the sub-
ject of his former murders and robberies, committed against ns in Jackson. He did not
pretend to deny any thing, but spoke upon the whole as frank as if he had been giving
the history of something done in ages past, with which we were not personally concerned"
He also informed us that ho had been exhorted by many to hang ns on tire way to
Jackson, but he should not suffer us to be injured. Indeed, it was now evident (hat he
was proud of his prey, and felt highly enthusiastic in having the honor of returning in
triumph to the town of Independence, with the exhibition of his prisoners, whom his
superstition had magnified into Noble or Royal personages ; who would be gazed upon
as Kings, or as something supernatural.
“ Next morning we were on our march, and in the after part of the day, we came (o
the Missouri River, which separated between Jackson county and us. Here the brigade
was halted, and the prisoners taken to a public house, where we were permitted to
shave our beards and change our linen, after which wa partook of some refreshment.
This done, we were hurried to the ferry, and across the river with the utmost haste
when but a few of the troops had passed. This movement was soon explained to us.
The truth was, General Clark had sent an express to take us from General Wilson, and,
prevent us from going to Jackson, as both armies were competitors for the honor of pos-
sessing the wonderful, or in their estimation, Royal Prisoners. Clark and his troops
from a distance, who had not arrived in the city of Far West till after our departure,
was desirous of seeing the strange men, who it was said had turned the world upside
down; and was desirous of the honor of possessing such a wonderful trophy of victory,
or of putting us to death himself. And on the other hand Wilson, Lucas, and their
troops, were determined to exhibit us in triumph through the streets of Independence.
Therefore, when demanded by General Clark’s express, they refused to surrender ns,
and hurried us across the ferry with all possible dispatch; after which, marching about
a mile, we encamped in the wilderness for the night, with about fifty troops for our guard,
the remainder not crossing the ferry till next morning.
Next morning being Sunday, we were visited by some gentlemen and ladies. One of
women came up and,very candidly inquired of the troops, which of the prisoners
'was the Lord whom the Mormons worshipped ? One of the guard pointed to Mr.
Smith, with a significant smile, and said This is he. The woman then turning to Mr.
S. inquired whether he professed to be the Lord and Saviour ? Do not smile gentle reader,
at the ignorance of these poor innocent creatures, who are thus kept under, and made
to believe such absurdities by their men, and by their lying priests. Mr. S. replied,
that he professed to be nothing but a man, and a minister of salvation sent by Jesus'
Christ to preach the gospel. This answer so surprised the woman that she began to
inquire into our doctrine ; and Mr. Smith preached a discourse both to her and her
companions, and to the wondering soldiers who listened with almost breathless attention,
while he set forth (he doctrine of faith in Jesus Christ, and repentance and baptism for
remission of sins, with the promise of the Holy Ghost, as recorded in the second chap-
ter of the Acts of the Apostles. The woman was satisfied and praised God in the hear-
ing of the soldiers, aqd went away praying that God would protect and deliver us.
Thus was fulfilled a prophesy which had been spoken by Mr. Smith, a few months pre-
vious ; for he had prophesied that a sermon would be preached in Jackson county, by
one of our Elders, before the close of 1838.
“ About 10 o’clock the brigade had all crossed the ferry and come up with ns. We
were then marched forward in our carriages, while the troops were formed in onr front
and rear, with quite a martial appearance. As we went through (he settlements, hund-
reds of men, women, and children flocked to see us, and our General often halted the


whole brigade to introduce us to the ladies and gentlemen, pointing out each of his pri-
soners by name. We were often shaken by the hand ; and, in the ladies at least, there
often appeared some feeling of sympathy. In this way we proceeded until we arrived
at Independence. It was now past noon, and in the midst of a great rain. But hun-
dreds crowded to witness the procession, and to gaze at us as we were paraded in martial
triumph through all the principal streets—our carriages moving in the centre, while the
brigade on horseback was formed in front and rear, and the bugles sounded a blast of
triumphant joy.
“ This ceremony being finished, a vacant house was prepared for our reception, into
which we were ushered through the crowd of spectators who thronged every avenue.
The troops were then disbanded. In the mean time we were kept under a small guard, and
were treated with some degree of hospitality and politeness, while thousands flocked to
see us day by day. We spent most of our time in preaching and conversation, explana-
tory of our doctrines and practice, which removed mountains of prejudice, and
enlisted the populace in our favor, notwithstanding their old hatred and wickedness to
our Society.
“ We were soon at liberty to walk the streets without a guard ; and soon wd were
removed from our house of confinement to a hotel, where we wer& entertained in the
best style of which the place was capable, which was lodging on the floor, and a block
of wood for a pillow. We had no longer any guard—we went out and came in when
we pleased, a certain keeper being appointed merely to look to ns ; with him we walked
out of town and visited the desolate lands which belonged to our Society, and the place-
which, seven years before, we bad dedicated and consecrated for the building of a tem
pie, it being a beautiful rise of ground, about half a mile west of Independence. When
we saw it last it was a wilderness, but now our enemies had robbed it of every stick of
timber and it presented a beautiful rolling field of pasture, being covered with grass.
Oh how many feelings did this spot awaken in our bosoms! Here we had often bowed
the knee in prayer to Jehovah in by-gone years ; and here we had assembled with hun-
dreds of happy saints, in the solemn meeting, and offered our prayers, and songs, and
sacraments, in our humble dwellings ; but now all was solemn and lonely desolation
not a vestige remained to mark the place where stood our former dwellings; they had
long since been consumed by fire, or removed to the village and converted to the use of
our enemies. While at Independence we were once or twice invited to dine with Gen.
Wilson, and others, which we did with much apparent politeness and altention on their
part, and much cheerfulness on our own.
CHAPTER IV.
“ After about a week spent in this way, during which I was at one time alone in the
wilderness, more than a mile from town, we were at length (after repeated demands)
sent to General Clark, at Richmond. This place was on the same side of the Missouri
that Far West was, and about thirty miles distant. Generals Lucas and Wilson had
tried in vain to get a guard to accompany us ; none would volunteer, and when drafted,
they would not obey orders; for, in truth, they wished us to go at liberty. At last a
colonel and two or three officers started with us, with their swords and pistols, which
was more to protect us than to keep us from escaping. On this journey some of us
rode in carriages, and some on horseback. Sometimes we were sixty or eighty rods in
front or rear of our guard, who, by the by, were three sheets in the wind, in the whiskey
line, having a bottle in their pockets; but knowing that we were not guilty of any crime,
we did not wish to escape by flight. At night, having crossed the ferry, we put up at
a private house. Here our guards all went to bed and to sleep, leaving us their pistols
to defend ourselves in case of any attack from without, as we were in a very hostile
neighborhood.
Next morning we rode a few miles, and were met by an express from Gen. Clark, at
Richmond, consisting of Col. Price and a company of soldiers, who immediately sur-
rounded us with poised pieces, in regular military order, as if we had been Bonaparte
and his body guards, on a march to St, Helena; thinking perhaps, that if we could es-


Cape, the whole United Slates and all Europe would be immediately overthrown. In
this way we were escorted to Richmond, the head Quarters ofMaj. Gen. Clark and his
army, which was composed of three or four thousand men. Here, as usual, we had to
endure the gaze of the curious, as if we had been a caravan of exhibiting animals. We
were conducted with some military parade, into a block house, and immediately putin
chains, besides a strong guard, who stood over us rrfght and day, with presented rifles
and pistols. We were soon introduced to Gen. Clark, who seemed more haughty,
unfeeling, and reserved, than even Lucas or Wilson.
We inquired of the General what were his intentions concerning us ? I stated to
him that we had now been captives for many days, and we knew not wherefore ; nor
whether we were considered prisoners of war, or prisoners of civil process, or prisoners
of hope ;at the same time remarking that all was wrapt in mystery; for as cilzens of
the United States, and of Missouri, in time of peace, we could not be considered as pri-
soners of war ; and without civil process, we were not holden by civil authority ; and as
to being prisoners of hope, there was but little chance to hope from present appearances.
He replied that we were taken in order to be tried . “Tried ?by what aulhoiuy ? I
inquired. “By court martial,” said he.—“ What !” said I, “ministers of the gospel, who
sustained no office or rank in military affairs, and who are not even subject by law to
military duty, to be tried by a court martial, and this in time of peace, and m a re-
public where the constitution guarantees to every citizen the right of trial by jury ?
“Yes ” said he, “this is according to the treaty stipulations entered into at Far West,
at the time of your surrender, and as agreed to by Col. Hinkle, your commanding
officer.” “Colonel Hinkle, our commanding officer ?” inquired 1, has he to
do with onr civil rights ?he was only the colonel of the Caldwell militia.” “Why,
said the General, “ was he not the commanding officer of the fortress of Far West, the
head quarters of the Mormon forces ?” I replied that “we had no fortress, not
Mormon forces, but were part of the militia of the state of Missouri; ’ at which the
General seemed surprised, and the conversation ended.
We were astonished above measure at proceedings so utterly ignorant and devoid oj
all law or justice. Here was a Major General, selected by the governor of Missouri, and
senffto banish or exterminate a religious society. And then to crown the whole with
inconceivable absurdity, this officer and his staff considered the state of Missouri a sep-
erate independent government, having a right to treat with a foreign nation, a right
which belongs only to the United States, and not to any one state in the Union. And
then to cap the climax, he considers the Mormons a nation distinct from all other govern*
ments • and, in fact, enters into a treaty with the colonel of one of the regiments of their
own stale Militia, which was at that time under his immediate command, as a part ot
his own force. Thus Colonel Hinkle, is converted into a foreign minister, an envoy
extraordinary, in behalf of the Mormon empire, to enter into treaty stipulation^with
his Missouri Majesty’s forces, under Generals Lucas, Wilson, and Clark. The city of
Far West the capital of Mormonia, is the Ghent where this treaty of peace is ratified.
After which the standing army of Mormonia stack their arms, which are earned in tri-
umph to Richmond. The royal family, and other nobles, are surrendered in this treaty
to be tried by court martial and punished, and the inhabitants of the fallen empire, like
those of Poland, are to be banished to Illinois, instead of Siberia. But this banishment
Lore cruel than that of Poland by the Russians) is to include every man, woman and
child of the whole empire, with the exception of a few who are retained in prison, and
their women and children sent off from their homes and firesides to wander alone. And
a the same time a deed of trust is drawn up, and all the Mormons are compelled on
pain of death, to sign away their houses, lands, and properly, for the disposal of their
'°wLbund on our arrival at Richmond, that all these things had actually taken place ;
and in addition to all the rest of these unheard of outrages, eighteen of our citizens had

While he lay m tins situation his son-in-law, George Robinson, the only male member
of his numerous family, was chained by his side; and thus Mrs. Higdon and her danah
ters were lelt entirely destitute and unprotected. One of his daughters, Mrs. Robinson"
a young and delicate female, with her little infant, came down to see her husband, and To
comfort and take care of her father in his sickness. When she first entered the room
amid the clank of chains and the bristle of weapons, and cast her eyes on her sick and’
dejected parent, and sorrow worn husband, she was speechless, and only gave vent to her
feelings in a flood of tears. This faithful lady, with her little infant, continued by the bed
of her father till he recovered from his sickness, and till his fevered and disordered mind
assumed its wonted powers of intellect.
“ fn this mock Court of Inquiry, the judge could not be’prevailed on to examine the
conduct of the murderers, robbers, and plunderers, who had desolated our societv -
nor would he receive testimony except against us. And by the dissenters and apostates
who wtshed to save their own lives and secure their property at the expense of others ■
and by those who had murdered and plundered us from time to time, he obtained an abunl
dance of testimony much of which was entirely false. Our church organization was
converted by such testimony, into a temporal kingdom, which was to fill the whole
earth, and subdue all other kingdoms, Much was inquired by the judge ( who, by-the-by


"was a Methodist,) concerning the prophesy— <l In the days of these kings shall the God of
Heaven set up a kingdom which shall break in pieces all other kingdoms and stand forever,”
&c.* “ And the kingdom, and the greatness of the kingdom, under the whole Heaven,
shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High.” &c.f These texts, and many
others, were inquired into with all the eagerness and apparent alarm which characterized
a Herod of old, who feared a rival in the person of King Jesus, and who, after inquiring
diligently into the prophecies concerning the birth of Christ, and on learning that Beth-
lehem was the honored place designated by the Jewish oracles for the birth place of
Messiah, and on learning from the wise men of the east that he was already born, sent
forth a cruel order for the extermination of the children of Bethlehem, from two years
old and under. In this way Herod thought to falsify the oracles of God—to destroy
the King of the Jews, and maintain his own usurpation of power. But, lo !he was dis-
appointed. The angel of the Lord had caused the father and mother, and infant to flee
into Egypt. So this cruel judge decreed the destruction of the Church and Kingdom
of God, in the last days. But we shall see, in the sequel, that those whose destruction
was firmly decreed (by Gov. Boggs, the modern Herod, and his wicked coadjutors,) fled
into Illinois, instead of Egypt; for the predictions of Daniel and others must be fulfilled
now, as well as those concerning Christ were fulfilled, in spite of judges and governors.
Much inquiry was also had concerning our sending Missionaries to all nations to
preach the Gospel. And after all these inquiries, our religion was converted by false
testimony and by false coloring, into treason against the State of Missouri; and like flip
I'harisces of old, all these modern ignoramuses seemed to think, “ if we let them thus
alone all men will believe on them, and the Mormons will come and take away our place
and nation.” Here let me remark that it is, and ever has been, the firm and expressed
belief of our society, that religion is one thing, and politics another, and that the laws
of all governments should be respected and obeyed, so long as their administration pro-
tects the lives and properly ol their citizens, until the end ol the world, when Cluisjt
will reign as King of Kings and Lord of Lords.—But if self-defence and opposition to
tyranny and oppression amounts to treason, then 1 lor one, am a treusoncr with every
feeling of my heart; for had I 1 would restore the supremacy of the laws and
constitution, which have been violated by the authorities of Missouri. Justice should
be administered to the guilty Governor. Generals, Judges, and others, who have
murdered, plundered, and driven us; and those who have suffered should be restored to
their rights and their possessions, and the damages should he paid them. Mark the
saying, i am opposed to the unlawful proceedings of the highest authorities of Missouri
and would glory in laying down my life in opposing such abominations.
*< B ut tu return to my narrative : At the close of the Court of Inquiry, some twenty
or thirty were dismissed, among whom were A. Lyman, one of our number who bad
been with us in our captivity, and in our chains, and some twenty others were let to
bail; and Messrs. Joseph Smith, Jr., llyrum Smith, Sidney liigdon, Lyman Wight,
Cale'b Baldwin, and Alexander MTiae, were committed to the jail oi Clay county, on
the charge of treason. And Messrs. Morris i’helps, Luman Gibbs, Darwin Chase,
Norman Shearer and myself, were committed to the jail of Richmond, being accused
of treason and of defending ourselves in the battle with Bogart and his company.
This done, the civil and military authorities dispersed, and the troubled waters
became a little more tranquil. As our people were compelled by the memorable tieaty
of Ear West, to leave the state by the following spring, they now commenced moving by
hundreds and by thousands, to the state of Illinois, where they were received in the
most humane and friendly manner by (he authorities, and by the citizens in general.
Mean time, bands of murderers, thieves, and robbers, wore roaming unrestrained among
the unarmed and defenceless citizens; committing all manner of plunder, and driving
off cattle, sheep, and horses—abusing and insulting women, etc.
“ My wife and children soon came to me in prison, and spent most of Lie winter with
me in the dark, cold and filthy dungeon, where myself and fellow prisoners were con-
stantly insulted and abused by our dastardly guards, who olten threatened lo shoot,
hang us, &c‘. , . , , , . , .
“ The stale Legislature were soon in session, and from tins body, so high m responsi-
bility, we had hoped for some redress or protection. But what was our astonishment,

when, after much noisy debate on the subject, they refused to investigate the matter,

200,000 dollars for the payment of the troops engaged in this unlawful, unconstitutional
and treasonable enterprise, lias last act of unheard of outrage, sealed with eternal
infamy, the character of the state of Missouri, and established her downfall, to rise no
more She will be looked upon by her sister states as a star fallen from heaven, and a
ruined and degraded outcast from the federal union.-While the whole civilized world
will detest and abhor her, as the most infamous of tyiants. Nay, tyranny itself will
blush to hear her deeds mentioned in the annals of history ; and the most cruel persecu-
tors of the Christians or reformers, in Pagan or Papal Rome, will startle with astonish-
mem from their long slumbers, and with a shudder of the deepest horror, and a frown
ol the indignant contempt, they will look upon her unheard of deeds of blind infatuation,
and inconceivable absurdity. The spirits of the ancient martyrs will hail their brethren
° -i a j 6l " as greater suffererst han themselves, and the blood of ancient
and modern saints, will mingle together in cries for vengeance, upon those who are
drunken with their blood, till justice will delay no longer to execute his long suspended
mission of vengeance upon the earth.
“ These proceedings of the legislature were warmly opposed by a large
minority of the House, among whom were D. 11. Atchison, of Clay county, and all the
members from St. Louis, and Messrs. Rollins and Gordon, from Boon, and by various
other members from other counties, but the mob majority carried the day, for the <milty
wretches feared an investigation, knowing that it would endanger their Jives and liber-
ties.
“ Ma «y of ‘he state journals have tried to hide the iniquity of the state, by throwing a
cbvenng of lies over her atrocious deeds. But can they hide the Governor’s cruel order
for extermination or banishment ? Can they conceal the facts of the disgraceful treaty
of the Generals, with their own officers and men, at the city of Far West ? Can they
conceal the fact that twelve or fifteen thousand men, women and children, have been ban-
ished from the state without trial or condemnation ; and this at an expense of two hun-
dred thousand dollars, and this sum appropriated by the state Legislature, in order to
pay the troops for this act of lawless outrage ? Can they conceal the fact that we have
been imprisoned for many months, while our families, friends and witnesses have been
driven away ? Can they conceal the blood of the murdered husbands and fathers; or
stifle the cries ol the widow and the fatherless? Nay ! The rocks and mountains may
cover them in unknown depths—the awful abyss of the fathomless deep may swallow
them up—and still their horrid deeds will stand forth in the broad light of day, for tho
wondering gaze of angels and of men ! They cannot be hid !
“ Mr. Smith and his fellow prisoners In Clay county, applied for a writ
of habeas corpus to have their cases examined as to why they were in confinement.
At this trial, Mr. Higdon was let to bail under bonds of two thousand dollars, and the
rest were about to be dismissed, but the mob was so violent as to threaten the lives of
the Judges if they let them go. Therefore they were detained. In April, having been
confined near six months, they were taken to Davies county, to be tried by a band of
robbers, under the name of Grand Jury. Here a bill was soon found against them for
high treason, and various other offences.---Their venue was then changed, and they were
sent towards Columbia, Boon county, for trial. This was some F2U miles down the
country, towards Illinois. On their way to this place, they all made their escape from
the sheriff and three guards. Some say that the guards got beastly drunk, and let them
escape. Others, that they were bought for the paltry sum of 250 dollars, but be this as
it may, they escaped unhurt, and arrived safe in Illinois, where they were kindlv
received, and welcomed by the govenor, and by the community, as men who had escaped
from a long and terrible persecution. After being confined in Richmond more than
two weeks, about one half were liberated ; the rest, after another week’s confinement,
were, most of them, required to appear at court, and have since been let to bail.
Pratt's History.
Since Gen. Clark withdrew his troops from Far West, parties of armed men have
gone through the county, driving off horses, sheep and cattle, and also plundering
houses. The barbarity of General Lucas’ troops ought not to be passed over in silence.
They shot our cattle and hogs merely for the sake of destroying them, aud leaving them
for the ravens to cat. They look prisoner an aged man by the name of Tanner, and
without any reason for it, he was struck over the head with aguii, which laid his skull
bare. Another man by the name of Carey was also taken prisoner by them, and with-


out any provocation, had lus brains dashed out with a gun. He was laid in a wagon,
and there permitted to remain for the space of twenty four hours, during which time no
one was permitted to administer to him comfort or consolation, and after he Was
removed from that situation he lived but # a few hours. The destruction of properly, at
and about Far West, is very great. Many are stripped bare as it were, and others par-
tially so; indeed, take us as a body, at this time, we are a poor and afflicted people, and if
we are compelled to leave the state in the spring, many, yes, a large portion of. our soci-
ety, will have to be removed at the expense of the stale, as those who otherwise might
have helped them, are now debarred that privilege in consequence of the deed of trust
we were compelled to sign, which deed so operates upon our real estate, that it will sell
for little or nothing at this time. We have now made a brief statement of some of the
most prominent features of the troubles that have befallen our people since their first
settlement in this state, and we believe that these persecutions have come in consequence
of our religious faith, and not for any immorality on our part. T. hat instances have been
of late, where individuals have trespassed on the rights of others and thereby broken the
laws of the land, we will not pretend to deny, but yet we do believe that no crime can be
substantiated against any of the people who have a standing in our church, of an earlier
date than the difficulties in Davies county. And when it is considered that the rights
of this people have been trampled upon from time to lime, with impunity, and abuses
heaped upon them almost innumerable, it ought in some degree, to palliate for any
infraction of the law, which may have been made on the part of our people.
The late order of Gov. Boggs, to drive us from this state, or exterminate us, is a thing
so novel, unlawful, tyrannical and oppressive, that we have been induced to draw up
this memorial and present this statement of our case to your honorable body praying
that a law may be passed rescinding the order of the governor to drive us from the stale,
and also giving us the sanction of the legislature to inherit our lands in peace. We ask
an expression of the legislature, disapproving the conduct of those who compelled us to
sign a deed of trust, and also disapproving of any man or set of men taking our property
in consequence of that deed of trust, and appropriating it to the payment of debts not
contracted by us, or for the payment of damages sustained in consequence of trespasses
committed by others. We have no common stock, our property is individual property,
and w'e feel willing to pay our debts as other individuals do, but we are not willing to
be bound for other people’s debts also. ' _
The arms which were taken from us here, which we understand to be about oou,
besides swords and pistols, we care not so much about, as we do the pay for them ;
only we are bound to do military duty, which we are willing to do, and which we think
was sufficiently manifested by the raising of a volunteer company last fall, at bar West,
when called upon by Gen. Parks, to raise troops for the frontier.
The arms given up by us, we consider were worth between twelve and fifteen thou-
sand dollars, but we understand they have been greatly damaged since taken, and at
this time probably would not bring near their former value. And as they were, both
here and in Jackson county, taken by the militia, and consequently by the authority ot
the slate, we therefore ask your honorable body to cause an appropriation to be made
by law, whereby we may be paid for them, or otherwise have them returned us and the
damages made good. The losses sustained by our people in leaving Jackson county,
are so situated that it is impossible to obtain any compensation for them by law,
because those who have sustained them are unable to provelhose trespasses upon indivi-
duals. That the facts do exist,—that the buildings, crops, stock, furniture rails, timber, &c.,
of the society have been destroyed in Jackson county, is not doubted by those who aio
acquainted in this upper country, and since these trespasses cannot be proved upon
individuals, we ask your honorable body to consider this case, and if, in your liberality
and wisdom, you can conceive it to be proper to make an appropriation by law to these
sufferers, many of whom are still pressed down with poverty in consequence ot iheir
losses, would be able to pay their debts, and also in some degree be relieved from po-
verty and woe, whilst the widow’s heart would be made to rejoice, and the orphan s tear
measurable dried up, ard the prayers of a grateful people ascend on high, with thanks-
giving and praise, to the Author of our existence, for that benificent act.
In laying our case before your honorable body, we say, that we are willing, and ever
have been to conform to the constitution and laws of the United States and ot this state.
We ask in common with others, the protection of the laws. We ask for the privilege
guaranteed to all free citizens of the United States and of this state, to be extended to
us, that we may be permitted to settle and live where we please, and worship God


according to the dictates of our conscience, without molestation. And white we ask
lor ourselves this privilege, we are willing all others should enjoy the same.
We now lay our case at the feet of your legislature, and ask your honorable body to
consider it, and do lor us, after mature consideration, that which your wisdom patriot-
ism, and philanthropy may dictate. And we, as in duty bound, will ever pray, &c.

CHAPTER V.
The foregoing petition was presented to the legislature of Missouri, but they turned e,
deaf ear to it, and while many of our brethren were imprisoned, the whole body of the
society in that state, numbering from 12 to 15,000, was obliged to flee to the state of
Illinois, a distance of about 250 miles, and this to, in mid-winter, the ground covered
with snow and frost, the most of them on foot, without sufficient clothing or food, and
such was the intenseness of their sufferings that some perished by the way’ and for’want
of the necessary means to give them burial, they were obliged to leave some of them on the
prairie for the wolves to eat, and there their bones lie bleaching to this day, a spectacle
to God, and to his holy angels. The afflicted remnant, who lived through this fearful
persecution, and escaped into Illinois, were received with some show of kindness
by the people of that state, as will be seen by the following extracts from their papers. '
From the Quincy (Illinois) Argus, March 16, 1839.
We give in to-day’s paper the details of the recent bloody tragedy acted in Mis-
souri—the details of a scene of terror and blood unparelled in the annals of modern,
and under the circumstances of the ease, in ancient history—a tragedy of so deep and
fearful, and absorbing interest, that the very life-blood of the heart is chilled at the
simple contemplation. We are prompted to ask ourselves if it be really true, that we
are living in an enlightened, a humane, and civilised age —in an age and quarter of the
world boasting of its progress in every thing good, and great, and honorable, and vir
tuous, and high-minded—in a country of which, as American citizens, we would be
proud—whether we are living under a Constitution and Laws, or have not rather re-
turned to the mithless times of the stern Atilla—to the times of the fiery Hun, when
the sword and flame ravaged the fair fields of Italy and Europe, and the darkest pas-
sions held full revel in all the revolting scenes of unchecked brutality and unbridled
desire ?
We have no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our indignation and
shame at the recent transactions in a sister state—and that state Missouri— a state of
which we had long been proud, alike for her men and history, but now so fallen that
we could wish her star stricken out from the bright constellation ot the Union. We
say, we know of no language sufficiently strong for the expression of our shame and
abhorrence of her recent conduct. She has written her own chatacter in letters of
blood— and stained it by acts of merciless cruelty and brutality that the waters of ages


cannot efface. It will be observed that an organized mob aided by many of the civil
and military officers of Missouri, with Governor Boggs at their head, hove been the
prominent actors in this business, incited, as it appears, against the Mormons by politi-
cal hatred, and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge. They have but too
well put in execution their threats of extermination and expulsion, and fully wreaked
their vengeance on a body of industrious and enterprising men, who had never wronged,
nor wished to wrong them, but on the contrary had ever comported themselves as good
and honest citizens, living under the same laws and having the same right with them-
selves to the sacred immunities of life, liberty , and property.
Proceedings in the town of Quincy for the purpose of affording relief to the people usually
denominated <! The Latter Day Saints.”
At a meeting of the Democratic Association, held on Saturday evening, the 23rd
ultimo, Mr. Lindsay introduced a resolution setting forth, that the people called “ The
Latter Day Saints,” were many of them in a situation requiring the aid of the citi-
zens of Quincy, and recommending that measures be adopted for their relief; which
resolution was adopted, and a committee consisting of eight persons appointed by the
chair-—of which committee J. W. Whitney was chairman. The association then ad-
journed to meet on Wednesday evening next, after instructing the committee to
procure the Congregational meeting-house as a place of meeting, and to invite as many
of the people to attend the meeting as should choose to do so, in whose behalf the
meeting was to be held, and also all others, citizens of the town. The committee
not being able to obtain the meeting-house, procured the court-house for that pur-
pose.
Wednesday, Feb. 27th, 1839,
G o’clock, p.m.
The members of the Democratic Association, and the citizens of Quincy generally,
assembled in the court-house to take into consideration, the state and condition
of the people called “ The Latter Day Saints,” and organized the meeting by appoint-
ing Gen. Leach, chairman, and James D. Morgan, secretary.
Mr. Whitney, from the committee appointed at a former meeting, submitted the fol-
lowing report.
The select committee, to whom the subject was referred of inquiring into and re-
porting the situation of the persons who have recently arrived here from Missouri, and
whether their circumstances are such, as that they would need the aid of the citizens
of Quincy and its vicinity, to be guided by what they deem the principles of an ex-
panded benevolence, have attended to the duties assigned them, and have concluded on
the following
REPORT.
The first idea that occurred to your committee, was to obtain correctly the facts of
the case, for without them the committee could come to no conclusions, as to what it
might be proper for us to do. Without them they could form no basis upon which the
committee might recommend to this association what might be proper lor us to do, or
what measures to adopt.
The committee, soon after their appointment, sent invitations to Mr. Rigdon, and
several others, to meet the committee and give them a statement of the facts, and to
disclose their situation. Those individuals accordingly met the committee, and entered
into a free conversation and disclosure of the facts ol their situation, and alter some
time spent therein, the committee concluded to adjourn and report to this meeting, but
not without requesting those individuals lo draw up and send us, in writing, a con-
densed statement of the facts relative to the subjects in charge of your committee, which
those individuals engaged to do, and which the committee request may be taken ns
part of their report. That statement is herewith lettered A.
The committee believe that our duties at this time, and on this occasion, arc all in-
cluded within the limits of an expanded benevolence and humanity, and which arc
guided and directed by that charily which never failetli. From the facts already dis-
closed, independent ot the statement furnished lo the committee, we Icel it cm duty

Quincy, February 27, 1839.
fA.)
This, gentlemen, is a brief outline of the difficulties that we have labored under in
consequence of the repeated persecutions that have been heaped upon us; and as the
Governor s exterminating order has not been rescinded, we, as a people, were obliged to
leave the state, and with it, our lands, corn, wheat, pork, &c., that we had provided for
ourselves and amilies, together with our fodder, which we had collected for our cattle
horses, &c.—those of them that we have been able to preserve from the wreck of that
desolation which has spread itself over Davies and Caldwell counties.
In consequence of our brethren’s being obliged to leave the State, and as a sympathy
and friendly spirit has been manifested by the citizens of Quincy, numbers of our
brethren, glad to obtain an assylum from the hand of persecution, have come to this place.
we cannot but express our feelings of gratitude to the inhabitants of this place for the
friendly feelings which have been manifested, and the benevolent hand which has been
stretched out to a poor, oppressed, injured, and persecuted people; and as you, gentle-
men of the Democratic Association, have felt interested in our welfare, and have desired
to be put m possession of a knowledge of our situation, our present wants, and what
would be most condusiye to our present good, together with what led to those difficulties,
, U - t thßt th ose documents* would furnish you with as correct information of our
diniculties and what led to them, as any that we are in possession of.
It we should say what our presents wants are, it would be beyond all calculation, as
we have been robbed of our corn, wheat, horses, cattle, cows, hogs, wearing apparel
houses and homes, and indeed, of all that renders life tolerable.—We do not, we cannot
expect to be placed in the situation that we once were, nor are we capable, of ourselves,
of supply ing the many wants of those of our poor brethren, who are daily crowding here
and looking to us for relief, in consequence of our property, as well as theirs, being in
the hands of a ruthless and desolating mob.
It is impossible to give an exact account of the widows, and those that are entirely
destitute, as there ate so many coming here daily; but, from inquiry, the probable
amount will be something near twenty, besides numbers of others who are able-bodied
* Alluding (o a memorial and other documents.


men, both able and willing to work, to obtain a subsistence, yet owing to their peculiar
situation, are destitute of means to supply the immediate wants that the necessities of
their families call for. We would not propose, gentlemen, what you shall do, but after
making these statements, shall leave it to your own judgment and generosity.
As to what we think would be the best means to promote our permanent good, we
think that to give us employment, rent us farms, and allow us the protection and privi-
leges of other citizens, would raise us from a state of dependence, liberate us from the
iron grasp of poverty, put us in possession of a competency, and deliver us from the
ruinous effects of persecution, despotism and tyranny.

Met pursuant to adjournment.
The meeting was called to order by the chairman.
On motion of Mr. Morris, a committee of three was appointed to take up a collection ;
Messrs. J. T. Holmes, Whitney, and Morris, were appointed.
The committee subsequently reported that 48 dollars 26 cents had been collected.
On motion, the amount was paid over to the committee on behalf of the Mormons.
On motion of Mr. Holmes, a committee of three, consisting of S. Holmes, Bushnell
and Morris, were appointed to draw up subscription papers and circulate them among
the citizens, for the purpose of receiving contributions in clothing and provisions.
On motion, six were added to that committee.
On motion of J. T. Holmes, J. D. Morgan was appointed a committee to wait upon
the Quincy Greys, for the purpose of receiving subscriptions.
Mr. Morgan subsequently reported that 20 dollars had been subscribed by that com-
pany.
The following resolutions were then offered by Mr. T. J. Holmes.
Resolved, That we regard the rights of conscience as natural and inalienable, and
the most sacred guaranteed by the constitution of our free government.
Resolved, That we regard the acts of all mobs as flagrant violations of law, and those
who compose them, individually responsible, both to the laws of God and man for every
depredation committed upon the property, rights, or life of any citizen.
Resolved, That the inhabitants upon the Western Frontier of the State of Missouri in
their late persecutions of the class of people denominated Mormons, have violated the
sacred rights of conscience, and every law of justice and humanity.
Resolved, That the Gov. of Missouri in refusing protection to this class of people when
pressed upon by an heartless mob, and turning upon them a band of unprincipled
militia, with orders encouraging their extermination, has brought a lasting disgrace upon
the stale over which he presides.
The resolutions were supported in a spirited manner by Messrs. Holmes, Morris and
Whitney.
On motion, the resolutions were adopted.
On motion, the meeting then adjourned.

The following letter was written by a gentleman, not a member of our society.
LETTER FROM A GENTLEMAN AT TOE WEST TO HIS FRIEND IN BOSTON,
(From the Boston Atlas.)
Dear Sir, —You ask me for information concerning the Mormon troubles in Mis-
souri. la giving it, I shall be compelled to state particulars, that will stagger your belief;


and i shall be betrayed into a warmth of expression, which may be construed into (he
signs of partisan bitterness, but which will be, in truth, only U,e language of lionet
indignation, ihe senes of wrongs and outrages perpetrated on the Mormons and the
dosing act of injustice, by which those wrongs and outrages were suffered to escape
nut only unpunished but triumphant, from the elements of persecution, which in vain
seeks a paiallel in the history of onr country. For example of similar outrages on the
lights of justice and humanity, I am compelled to resort to barbarous nations and dark,
souri WUC 1 a on ° urnis 1 P recedei hs to excuse the conduct of the people of Mis-
-1 he Mormons, I need not say, aro a weak and credulous people, whose chief fault is
the misfortune of having become the- dupes of a villainous impostor.* They have an
excess of that, as to which the world at large is exceedingly deficient, i.e , faith

the Mormons were, in truth, a moral, orderly, and sober population. They were in-
dustrious farmers and ingenious mechanics. They were busy about their own affairs
and never intermeddled m the concerns of their neighbors. They were exceedingly
peaceful and averse to strife, quarrels, and violence. They had established schools
i icy encouraged education ; and they had all the rudiments of learning, taught under
our school system at the East. They had began to open fine farms, and put their lands
m a high state of improvement. Many of them were surrounded by numerous corn-
Jurts, ana some with even the elegancies of life.
In all these respects their condition presented a broad contrast to that of their neinh-
bors Of these neighbors, many had been there for years-miich longer in fact than
he Mormons -and had made tew advances upon the Indians they had displaced. Mud
hovels-'-a truck patch —hunting and buck-skin breeches were their highest aspira-
lions. Letters they despised as much as they did the conveniences or comforts of life
Bold, violent unscrupulous, and grasping—hating all who differed fiom, much more
who excelled them in the art of living, the relation between them and the iMormons
may readily bo inferred by'any man who has read a single chapter in the history of
human strife. J
'The Anti-Mormons (fori must, so distinguish this horde of demi-savages) are ex-
ceedingly intolerant. They are refuse Kentuckians and Tenesseeans, intermixed with
Virginians of the same caste, in whom the vice, sectional pride, which marks these
people, and a prejudice against all others, especially those belonging to the free states
whom they indiscriminately brand as Yankees—is exaggerated to the highest pitch!
Such persons, if they could do it, would incorporate in the constitution of Missouri a
provision^to prohibit emigrating thither of any body, not belonging to their own “ kith
■and km.” They have also personal pride to an excess, which loads them, however, not
to emulate a rival’s exertions, but to envy his success and hate his person. They have
however, a grasping disposition, which stimulates to acquire ; but not industry and en-
terprise enough to lead them to acquire honestly. They prefer plunder to fair
means, if they can only conceal the knowledge of their foul play; because rapine
gratifies their propensities to force, indolence, and acquisition. They are bold crafty,
and when inspired by revenge, energetic and persevering beyond almost any other race
of men.
The worst error committed by the otherwise cunning Smith and his coadjutors, was
that of transplanting his followers to such a soil. A pacific, rather timid,’ and
thrifty people, differing as the Mormons did from the out-skirt Missourians in manners,
sentiments and modes of life, just served to stimulate the worst passions of the latter,
■and held out the prospect of an easy prey to their cupidity and violence.

They were sagacious enough to know that their acts should have a “show of virtue,”
and they accordingly began to misrepresent the Mormons. The charges were at first
general. The Mormons were a “ mighty mean people.” They were “ great fools”
which, in common acceptation, is about as bad as being great villians. Then they were

t hoy ‘ tampered with the negroes, ’ which we know, in all slave states excites the most
intense odium against (ho accused, without, in (he nature of things, a possibility of
repelling the accusation, for a slave’s evidence is worthless. Finally, a fellow burnt his
own corn crib and charged it on the Mormons. Bad men hate those whom they have
injured. There is, therefore, plenty of reason why the Anti-Mormons should have
hated their rivals. Crimination provokes recrimination ; hate begets hale. Dissections
and quarrels sprung up between the parties; till, finally, it was evident that they could
not live in contact; and that the Anti-Mormons were determined the Mormons should
yield and abandon the country. Moreover the land sales were approaching, and it was
expedient that they should be driven out before they could establish their rights to pre-
emption. In this way their valuable improvements—the fruit of diligence and enter-
prize-—would pass into the hands of men who would have the pleasure of enjoying
without the toil of earning. * * * * *
The massacre at Harm’s Mills ought to be rung through Christendom. A body of
men commanded by a Senator from Chariton county, went down to that mill and there
fell upon their victims, precisely as the pirates of the Caribeau fell upon theirs. The
poor Mormons took refuge in a blacksmith’s shop, and were there murdered in detail
The attacking party leisurely and deliberately thrust their rifles between the logs of the
building, and there as the Mormons -were pent up like sheep in a fold, butchered them 1
An old man, M’Bride—said to have been a revolutionary soldier—begged for his life :
it was denied him, and he was put to death with the most savage violence. A mere
child-—only nine years old—-was chased, supplicating his pursuers, exclaiming “I am
an American boy.”'* But all would not answer.—lie was huntedto his place of refuge
under the huge bellows of the shop and his head was blown into fragments, by means
of a rifle deliberately aimed at it! It is said too, that some of the more desperate and
abandoned of the profligate villains, who joined in this affray, returned the next day,
and danced over the well in which their victims had been entombed! Certain it
is, that they plundered those whom they had killed. And be it remembered, that (his
party of assailants had no authority whatever for mustering and marching; and, there-
fore, in the eye of the law, are mere brigands, robbers, and murderers.
You ask, if this can be true? I tell you—yes. It is true —awful, atrocious and
abominable as it is, it is true. Yes, it is true —true in the nineteenth century—true in
republican, in Christian America ; true, while your good people of Boston-—a part of
the same people that committed these horrors, are sending the gospel of truth and love to
far away India and the isles of the ocean.
And how do you think the great Senator civilian, who led this onslaught, justifies it ?
“ Why,” says lie, ‘we were in a state of war ! It, was open tear ! Which party fired
first, I don’t know. It did not matter. We came to fight; we had a fight; and they
got whipped.” Yes, indeed they got whipped. Thirty Mormons killed outright or
dead of their wounds, and not a hair of a head touched on the other side. A fair fight !
Very likely! Men pent up in a blacksmith’s shop and butchered like cattle ! An old
grey haired man hacked up and shot through I A child chased and his brains blown
out! A fair fight! What ideas of regular war and legitimate battle—or rather what
notion of right, justice, or humanity must possess the head of a Senator (!) who can jus-
tify his acts as this one does ! It is really a pity that the Mormons did not make a
fight of it. If they had done so, this Senator might not now have been living to proclaim
bis own disgrace, with his own lips, to all the intelligence and humanity of Christendom.
From first to last—-but especially in the outset of the troubles-—the Governor of the
state was guilty of the most unpardonable remissness and partiality. He was formerly
of Jackson county, and came into office with strong prejudices against the Mormons.
At the time of the difficulty in Carrol, the Mormons sent and besought his interposition.
He refused it, on the pretext of expense: but in a few weeks afterwards, ordered out
against the Mormons, an army large enough to have prostrated ten times the force, sup-
posed to be arrayed against it.
The conduct, too, of Gen. Lucas, who commanded at the (so called) surrender at
Far West, was to the last degree absurd and tyrannical. Regarding the Mormons—-
not as American citizens—-but as prisoners of war, belonging to a strange and beligeront
people, he imposed upon them a “ treaty,” by which they bound themselves, through a
committee to indemnify (the innocent for the guilty) the sufferers in Davies, and to quit

to be American citizens. And this boy was, in fact, not a Mormon.


the state. Such stipulations, so flagrantly at war with the law of the land and with
common nght-did this notable general officer, in the execution of his high and delicate
think tit to exact ol his Mormon prisoners, supposing as he doubtless did, that the
Mormons were bound by it!
But worse—still more absurd and barbarous than all this, was one transaction which
happened immediately on the surrender. Will you believe it, that, on that event
General Lucas called a council, composed of some sixteen general officers which by a
large majority, decided to fry, on the next day, 40 or 50 of those Mormons whom they
considered ringleaders, by a Court Martial, the end of which no doubt would have been
death to all the accused! It was then that Gen. Doniphan, of Clay county-a man
respected for his legal attainments and high character, addressed Gen. Lucas in the
most indignant language. “ Sir,” said he, “ to-morrow at day light, I march all my
command back to Clay. I will not stay here to witness your cold-bloody butchery.”
Gen. Lucas was not, however, then averted from his purpose ; but the stand taken by
Gen. Doniphan, disconcerted both him and the restof these general officers, all of whom
placed great reliance on Gen. Doniphan’s judgement, and secretly (as well they
might) distrusted their own. At midnight, Gen. Lucas went to Gen. Doniphan and
begged him to stay. That he wished all things properly conducted and therefore he
intended to name General D, as President of the Court. Gen. Doniphan instantaneously
sprung to his feet, and exclaimed “ This very inducement which yon hold out is the
reason why I will march two hours earlier than I intended. I wash my hands of this
Court. It is murder in cold blood. I will have nothing to do with it.’’ Suffice it to
say, that Gen. Doniphan’s noble stand prevented the execution of this monstrous pur-
pose. The Court Martial was not held. r
By the villanies of their enemies and their own imprudence, (for just retaliation was
in their case imprudence) the Mormons were prostrated. Some sought safety in flight
Some turned what property they had left into the moans of removal. Others were
too poor to go, and were compelled to stay and suffer.
All suffered, and all lost. But the pre-emptors suffered most. They were stripped of
the fruits of their hard toils; for not one of them dared, at the appointed time, present
himself, to make good his rights. The earnings of years were thus in one moment
wrested from them by violence and fraud. The American citizen is not protected by
American laws ; but he is driven out from his lands and his home, by men, whom the
law cannot or will not reach, and whom the legislature of the state justify and applaud.
The General Assembly of Missouri refused investigation of the origin and history of
this unexampled persecution. They knew better than to do it. Impartial investigation
would have implicated the state and many of its legislators too deeply. It was a seiies
of enormities that would not bear the light; and they, therefore—so far as they could
do it—have quenched it in darkness.
But still there remained the sordid disposition for pay. The general officers called
out in such extraordinary numbers, had a claim upon the treasury. With many of
them it was a sheer speculation. Though in many cases they went unattended to the
field, they filed ludicrous accounts for extra servants, horses, &c., claiming full brigadier
and major general’s pay, as it in the actual service of the United States. The demands,
it is true, were regular; but showed a very unpatriotic desire to make money out of the
state. The Legislature finally, without inquiry, voted 200,000 dollars, but provided
that the pirates should be paid first. Even 200,000 dollars will not meet the regular
demands—thanks to Governor Boggs’ prudence and discretion in calling out this host—
and these celebrated generals and generalissimos will be knocking at the door of the
next General Assembly reminding one of Patrick Henry’s speech in Hook’s
case, where the plaintiff was supposed to be patrolling the patriot camp with cries of
“Beef!” “Beef!” I sincerely hope they will in vain cry “Pay!” “Pay!” until
they are willing to confine their demands within bounds.
And now do not suppose —let no man north of the Potomac suppose—that the faith
and fanaticism of the Mormons had any influence worth mentioning, in exciting this
persecution.
No—it was the cause I have already intimated, to which this affair maybe rightly
traced. And let me assure you that any body of men like the Mormons' in all other
respects, but in their religion , would in the same situation have shared their fate. I
wish you to understand it as my deliberate opinion, that, at this moment, any body of
people, accustomed only to the manners and sentiments of the free states, and rather
pacific and yielding in their dispositions, however industrious, thrifty and intelligent


'would, if they attempted a settlement on choice lands in Missouri fare as have the Mor-
m<Why conceal the truth ? Let me tell you that a body of farmers and mechanics from
Essex, Middlesex or Norfolk—however they might differ in points of faith—it they
should now be transplanted to the abandoned localities of the Mormons—would in five
years from the date be driven out by fire and sword precisely as the Mormons have, and
the General Assembly of Missouri would justify it. Do you ask me how the Germans
continue to slay in Missouri ? I will tell you. They have taken the worst soils in the
state-soils which nobody else will take. This is the true answer. Ihe Germans are
more disliked than the Yankees, and if they should once presume to interfere with the
Kentucky prerogative to occupy the best lands —woe to the poor Germans unless
indeed they will fight harder than the Mormons.
Yes. let it be understood that there is a portion of the public domain of the United
States, which is not common to people of all the states. The question is now settled.
The lettered yeomanry of the free states have met the unlettered yeomanry ot the slave
states; and by the latter have been banished, scattered and despoiled.
The game tried so successfully against the Indians, has been played off against the

CHAPTER VI.
The society now selected the county of Hancock, state of Illinois, for a settlement;
and on a beautiful point of land, on the east bank of the Mississippi river they laid out
a plot of ground for a city, and called it Nauvoo, which signifies, Beautiful for situation.
They also settled large quantities of land ; and by that untiring industry and indomitable
perseverance, which has always characterized our brethren, and by the steady flowing
in of the tide of emigration to that place, (for many of our dders were successfully
preaching in all parts of the states, and in Great Britain,) the church had in a measure
recovered from their calamities, and were prospering beyond all precedent. Nauvoo
bad in 1844 become a fine city of twelve thousand inhabitants, and our settlements had
extended over most parts of Hancock county, and in many parts of the counties adjoin-
ing on both sides of the Mississippi, so that in Illinois and lowa we numbered not less
than twenty-five thousand members. But a spirit of persecution and mobocracy began
to manifest itself soon after our settlement in Illinois, which finally resulted in one of
the most cold bloody and cruel murdeis that history ever chronicled. rnoT , optol Io
This persecution was difecled, chiefly, against Joseph Smith, and a respectable
monthly journal, the Times and Seasons, of July, 1843, thus speaks of it;
It has fallen to our lot of late years to keep an account of any remarkable circumstance
that might transpire, in, and about this, and the adjoining states; as well as of distant
provinces and nations. Among the many robberies, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
Tornadoes, fires, mobs, wars, &c., &c., which we have had to record, there is one circum-
stance of annual occurrence, which it lias always fallen to our lot to chronicle. We
allude not to the yearly inundations of the Nile, nor the frequent eruptions of esnv.us
or Etna, but to the boiling over of Tophet, alias the annual overflow of the excressence
of Missouri Not, indeed, like the Nile, overflowing its parched banks, invigorating the
alluvial soil and causing vegetation to teem forth in its richest attire; but ike the sul-
phurous flame that burns unnoticed in the bowels of a volcano; kept alive by the com-
bustion of its own native element, until it can contain itself no longer within ihe limits of
its crater, it bursts beyond its natural bounds; and not satisfied with burning what is
within its own bowels, it rushes furiously, wildly, and wantonly forth, and spreads its
sulphurous lava all around, scattering desolation in us path, destroying the cot of the
husbandman, the fisherman, and the palace of the nobleman in one general sweep;
covering vegetation with its fiery lava, and fuming the garden into a bed of cinders.
So Missouri has her annual ebulitions, and unable lo keep her fire within her own
bosom must belch forth her sulphuric lava, and seek to overwhelm others with what is
bS-Tier own bowels and destroying her very vitals ; and as it happens that we
are so unfortunate as to live near the borders of this monster, we must ever and anon,
be smooted with the soot that flies off from her burning crater.

the legality and constitutionality of the writ tested.


Governor Ford at that time manifested a friendly disposition, and seemed disposed
Vo put a slop to that executive influence which had sought the destruction an ! over-
throw of Mr. Smith.
But as ex-Governor Carlin, or the sheriff of Adams county, or both, were either
afraid of having their deeds investigated, or wished to set at defiance the law; the writ was
not forthcoming; and after the great hue and cry that has been made about Joseph
Smith’s fleeing from justice, he was absolutely under the necessity of petitioning Gov
Ford to issue another writ before he could obtain a hearing before
the court. For the purpose of answering the ends of justice, and that
Mr. Smith might be legally and fairly dealt with, Governor Ford issued another writ,
which was a copy of the one issued by Governor Carlin. Mr. Smith then petitioned
the United States district court for a writ of Habeas Corpus, which was granted, and he
appeared before that court on Saturday, the 30th of December, 1812, and gave bail
for his appearance at court on Monday. Mr. LambuUrn, the Attorney-General of the
state of Illinois, appeared on behalf of the state, and Mr Butterfield was counsel for
Mr. Smith.
On Monday Mr. Lambourn requested of the court a little time, stating that the sub
ject was new to him, that it was one of great importance, that he had not had an op
portunity of investigating it, and he hoped that the court would indulge him with one
or two days: the court granted him that privilege, and the trial was postponed until
Wednesday, the 4th of January. Mr. Lambourn objected to the proceedings, on the
ground that the United States Court had no jurisdiction in this case, and that it be-
longed to the courts of this state to adjudicate iu this matter; he moreover contended
that they could not go behind the writ to the guilt, or innocence of the accused party ;
his objections however were overruled by the court.
Messrs. Edwards and Butterfield showed in a very lucid manner that Mr. Lambourn
was in the dark concerning this matter —and Mr. Butterfield contended that in this
case, and under the circumstances of the issuing of this writ, the United States distric t
court not only had jurisdiction ; but that it had exclusive jurisdiction. He also showed
very clearly, that although they had no right to go behind the writ when judgment was
rendered, that they had a perfect right where that was not the case, flc quoted several
authorities in defence of the position that he took, and very clearly showed that the
course which he had taken in this affair, was strongly supported by law, that he was
sustained by the constitution of the United States, and by a law of Congress based
upon the constitution, and by all former precedents. He then exposed in a very able
manner, the corruption of Governor Reynolds of Missouri, and of Governor Carlin of
Illinois,' in relation to this matter, proving from their own documents that the steps
which thev had taken were illegal, that Governor Reynolds had no foundation to issue
a writ, or to demand Joseph Smith from Governor Carlin, on any thing that there was
in the'affidavit of ex-Governor Boggs of Missouri, and that he was obliged to add cer-
tain clauses in his demand which wore not found in the body of the affidavit, before
his claims upon this state could have the semblance of law, and that Governor Carlin,
with these lame documents before him wished to make it a little more plain, and added
another addition, by way of codicil to the charge. He clearly shewed the progress of
crime among those governors. Ex-Governor Boggs’ affidavit stated that “he believed,
and had good reason to believe that Joseph Smith was accessory before the fact, and
that ho was a resident of Illinois .” Governor Reynolds stated that it had been repre-
sented to him that Joseph Smith was accessory before the fact, and had tied from the
justice of Missouri; and to makeup the thing complete, Governor Carlin stated that
he was a fugitive from justice , consequently neither Governor Reynolds nor Go-
vernor Carlin had any foundation whereon to base tho issuing of a demand, proclama-
tion, or writ.
After showing very clearly, the ignorance and injustice of those executives, proving
to a demonstration that Joseph Smith had not been in Missouri for three years; that
he could not be a fugitive from justice, and that if he were guilty ot being an accessory
die thing was not done in Missouri, and he could not be taken there to be tried ; he
concluded by saying, that all the difference there was between the Mormons and other
professions was, that the different sects believed in the ancient prophets only, and the
Mormons believed in both ancient and modern prophecy. Another distinction


Mr. Smith returned in peace to the bosom of his family, and was received with
joyous acclamation by a numerous host of friends, who felt to rejoice that innocence
had triumphed over persecution, fanaticism, and despotism.
CHAPTER VII.
Feeling perfectly secure, he set off with his family to Mr. Wasson's to visit his wife's
sister, Mrs. Wasson, and family, who resided about twelve miles from Dixon, Lee
county, in this state. While he was there, a Mr. J. H. Reynolds, Sheriff of Jackson
county Missouri, (so he says) and Mr. Harman Wilson of Carthage, arrived at Dixon,
professing to be Mormon preachers; from whence they proceeded to Mr. Wasson’s at
whose house Mr. Smith was staying. They found Mr. Smith outside of the door, and
accosted him in a very uncouth, ungentlemanly manner, quite in keeping however, with
the common practice of Missourians. The following is as near the conversation as wo
ran gather. Reynolds and his coadjutor Wilson, both stepped up at a time to Mr.
Smith with their pistols cocked, and without showing any writ or serving any process,
Mr. Reynolds with his pistol cocked at Mr. Smith’s breast, cried out, “ G —d d n
you if you stir I’ll shoot —G —d d n you if you stir one inch I’ll shoot you, G—d
d n you—be still or I’ll shoot you by G—d.” “ What is the meaning of this ?”
interrogated Mr. Smith. “ I’ll show you the meaning by G —d, and if you stir one
inch I’ll shoot you, G— d d n you.” “I am not afraid of your shooting,” answered
Mr. Smith, “I am not afraid to die.” He then bared his breast, and said “Shoot
away, I have endured so much oppression I am weary of life, and kill me if you please.
I am a strong man, however, and with my own natural weapons could soon level both
of you ; bat if you have any legal process to serve, I am at all times subject to law, and
shall not offer resistance.” “ G—d d n you if you say another word we’ll
shoot you, by G —d.” “ Shoot away,” answered Mr. Smith, “I am not afraid of
your pistols.” They then hurried him off to a carriage that they had, and without
serving process, were for hurrying him oft' without letting him see, or hid farewell to
his family or friends. Mr. Smith then said, “ gentlemen, if you have any legal process
I wish to obtain a writ of habeas corpus,” and was answered, “ G—d d n you,
•you shan’t have one.” Mr. Smith saw a friend of his passing, and said “ These men
are kidnapping me, and I wish a writ of habeas corpus to deliver myself out of their
hands.” This friend immediately proceeded to Dixon, whence the Sheriff also pro-
ceeded at full speed. On arriving at the house of Mr. M'Kennie, tavern keeper, Mr.
Smith was thrust into a room and guarded there without being allowed to see anybody,
and horses were ordered in five minutes. Mr. Smith then stated to Reynolds—“ I wish
to get counsel,” and was answered, “ G—d d n you, yon shan’t have counsel, one
word more, G—d d n, and I’ll shoot you.” “ What, is the use of this so often ?”
said Mr. Smith, “ I have often told you to shoot, and now I tell you again to shoot
away ;” and seeing a person passing, he said, “ I am forcibly imprisoned here, and I
want a lawyer.” A lawyer came, and had the door banged in his face with the old
threat of shooting if he came any nearer, another afterwards came and received the
same treatment. Many of the citizens of Dixon by this time being apprised of his
was, that the ancient prophets prophecied in poetry, and the modern ones in
prose.
Judge Pope then stated that the court would give its decision the next morn-
ing.
On Wednesday morning the Judge in his decision investigated the whole matter, and
in a very able manner sustained the views of Mr. Butterfield, and adduced additional
testimony and evidence in favor of the acquittal of Mr. Smith; and after a very learned
and able address he concluded by saying, that “ The decision of the court is that the
prisoner be discharged; and I wish it entered upon the records in such a way, that Mr.
Smith be no more troubled about this matter.”


situation, stepped forward, and gave the Sheriff to understand, that if (hat was their
mode of doing business in Missouri, they had another way of doing it here : that they
were a law-abiding people, and republicans, that Mr. Smith should have justice dune
him, and have the opportunity of a fair trial, but that if they persisted in their course,
they had a very summary way of dealing with such people—and gave them to under-
stand that Mr. Smith should not go without a fair and impartial trial. Mr. Reynolds
finding further resistance to be useless, allowed one or two attorneys to come to Mr.
Smith, who gave them to understand that he had been taken up without process; that
they had insulted and abused him, and he wante'd a writ of habeas corpus. Up to
this time they had altogether refused to allow the counsel to have private conversation
with him.
A writ was sued out by Mr. Smith against Harman Wilson for a violation of the law
in relation to writs of habeas corpus, the said violation consisting in said Wilson having
transferred said Smith to the custody of Reynolds for the purpose ot removing Mr.
Smith to Missouri, and thereby avoiding the effect and operation of said writ contrary
to law.
There was also another writ sued out from the circuit court of Lee county, in favor
of Mr. Smith, against Reynolds and Wilson, for private damage, for false imprisonment,
upon the ground that the writ issued by the Governor of Illinois, was a void writ in law;
upon which said writ, said Reynolds and Wilson were held to bail; and were in the
custody of the sheriff of Lee county. Reynolds and Wilson obtained a writ of habeas
■corpus for the purpose of being discharged before Judge Young, of Quincy, but they
did not go before Judge Young, but gave bail at Carthage for their appearance at the
circuit court at Lee county in said action.
Mr. Smith obtained a writ of habeas corpus from the Master in Chancery of Lee
county, returnable before the Hon. John D. Caton, Judged the ninth judicial circuit,
at Ottawa, as far as Pawpaw Grove, at which last mentioned place it was ascertained
that Judge Caton was on a visit to New York. Upon which the party, Messrs, Smith.
Reynolds, Wilson and others in company returned to Dixon, where another writ was
issued by the said Master in Chancery, in favor of Smith ; returnable before the nearest
tribunal in the fifth judicial circuit, authorised to hear, and determine, writs of habeas
corpus. It was ascertained that the nearest tribunal authorised to hear and determine
upon writs of habeas corpus, was at Nauvoo. On their arrival at Nauvoo, a writ of
habeas corpus was sued out before, and made returnable to the Municipal court of the
city of Nauvoo, directed to Mr. Reynolds, upon which said writ Mr. Reynolds did pro-
duce the body of said Smith before such court, objecting, however, to the jurisdiction of
said court. It was ascertained by the counsel for said Smith, that the Municipal court
had full and ample power to hear and determine upon writs of habeas corpus. Upon
examination before said court he was discharged from such arrest upon the merit ol said
case, and upon the further ground of substantial defects in said writ so issued by the Gov.
of the state of Illinois.
Why Governor Ford should lend his assistance in a vexatious prosecution of this kind
we are at a loss to determine. He possesses a discretionary power in such cases, and
has a right to use his judgment, as the chief magistrate of this state ; and knowing, as
he does, that the whole proceedings, connected with this affair, are illegal; we think
that in justice he ought to have leaned to the side of the oppressed and innocent, par-
ticularly when the persecuted and prosecuted \vere citizens of his own state, who had
a right to his sympathies and to be shielded by his paternal care, as the father of this
state. Does not his Excellency know ? and do not all the citizens of the state know
that the Mormons have been robbed, and pillaged, and plundered in that state without
any redress? that the Moripons.en-masse were exterminated from that slate without
any legal pretext whatever? and how then could they have any legal claim upon Joseph
Smith or any Mormon ? , Have the Mormons ever received any redress for injuries
done in Missouri? No! Is there any prospect of their receiving remuneration for
their loss, or redress for their grievance ? No ! When a demand was made upon the
Governor of Missouri, byGovernor Carlin of this state for the persons who had kidnapped
several Mormons, were they given up by that state? No. Why then should our Ex-
ecutive feel so tenacious in fulfilling all the nice punctillios of law, when the very state
that is making these demands, has robbed, murdered, and exterminated by wholesale
wiihout law, and are merely making use of it at present as a cats-paw to destroy the inno-
cent, and murder those that they have already persecuted nearly to the death? It is


impossible that the state of Missouri should do justice with her coffers, groaning with
the spoils of the oppressed, and her hands yet recking with the blood of the innocent.
Shall she yet gorge her bloody maw with other victims ? Shall Joseph Smith be given
into her hands illegally ? Never ! No never!! NO NEVER!!!
CHAPTER VIII.
At this trial before the Municipal Court of Nauvoo, among other witnesses who were
examined was Hyrum Smith, whose testimony we give en extenso : it is a plain un-
varnished tale, and reads thus ;
Hyrum Smith sworn. Said that the defendant now in court is his brother, and that
his name is not Joseph Smith junior, but his name is Joseph Smith, senior, and has
been for more than two years past. I have been acquainted with him ever since he
was born, which was thirty-seven years in December last, and I have not been absent
from him at any one lime, not even the space of six months since his birth, to my recol-
lection, and have been intimately acquainted with all his sayings, doings, business
transactions and movements, as much as any one man could be acquainted with another
man’s business, up to the present time, and do know that he has not committed treason
against any state in the Union, by any overt act, or by levying rvar, or by aiding and
abetting, or assisting an enemy in any state in the Union, and that the said Joseph
Smith, senior, has not committed treason against the state of Missouri, nor violated any law
or rule of said state, I being personally acquainted with the transactions of the said
Smith whilst he resided in said stale, which was for about six months in the year, 1838;
I being also a resident in said state daring the said period of lime, and I do know the
said Joseph Smith, senior, never was subject to military duty in any state, neither was
he in the state of Missouri, he being exempt by the amputation or extraction of a bone
from bis leg, and by his having a license to preach the Gospel, or being in other words
a minister of the Gospel, and I do know that said Smith never bore arms, as a military
man, in any capacity whatever, whilst in the state of Missouri, or previous to that time;
neither has he given any orders or any command in any capacity whatever : but Ido
know that whilst he was in the state of Missouri, that the people commonly called
Mormons, were threatened with violence and extermination, and on or about the first
Monday in August, 1838, at the election at Gallatin, the county seat in Davies county,
the citizens who were commonly called Mormons were forbidden to exercise the rights
of franchise, and from that unhallowed circumstance an affray commenced, and a fight
ensued among the citizens of that place, and from that time a mob commenced gather-
ing in that county threatening the extermination of the Mormons. The said Smith and
myself upon hearing that mobs were collecting together, and that they had also mur-
dered two of the citizens of the same place, and would not suffer them to be buried ;
the said Smith and myself went over to Davies county to learn the particulars of the
affray, but upon our arrival at Diahman,we learned that none were killed but several
were wounded. On mounting our horses to return, we rede up
to Mr. Black’s, who was then an acting Justice of the Peace, to obtain some water for
ourselves and horses. Some few of the citizens accompanied us there, and after obtaining
the refreshment of water, Mr. Black was asked by the said Joseph Smith, senior, If he
would use his influence to see that the laws were faithfully executed and to put down
mob violence ? and he gave us a paper, written by his own hand, stating that he would
do so. He also requested him to call together the most influential men of the county
on the next day that we might have an interview with them ; to this he acquiesced, and
accordingly the next day they assembled at the house of Colonel Wight, and entered
into a mutual covenant of peace, to put down mob violence and to protect each other
in the enjoyment of their rights. After this we we all parted with the best of feelings and
each man returned to his own home. This mutual agreement of peace however did
not last long; for but a few days afterwards the mob began to collect again, until
several hundreds rendezvoused at Millport, a few miles distant from Diahman. They
immediately commenced making aggressions upon the citizens called Mormons, taking


away their hogs and cattle, and threatening them with extermination or utter extinction ;
saying that they had a cannon, and there should be no compromise only at its mouth ;
frequently taking men, women, and children prisoners, whipping them and lacerating
their bodies with hickory withes, and tying them to trees and depriving them of food
until they were compelled to gnaw the bark from the trees to which they were bound, in
order to sustain life-, treating them in the most cruel manner they could invent or think
of and doing everything they could to excite the indignation of the Mormon people to
rescue them, in order that they might make that a pretext of an accusation .or the
breach of the law, and that they might the bettor excite the prejudices of the populace
and thereby get aid and assistance to carry out their hellish purposes of extermination.
Immediately on the authentication of these facts, messengers were despatched from
Far West to Austin A. King, Judge of the fifth judicial distract of the st . at . e . of Mls *
souri, and also to Major-General Atchison, Commander-In-Chief of that division, and
Brigadier-General Doniphan, giving them information of the existing facts, and de-
manding immediate assistance. General Atchison returned with the messengers and
went immediately to Diahman, and from thence to Millport, and he found the facts
were true as reported to him ; that the citizens of ihat county were assembled ogether
in a hostile attitude to the amount of two or three hundred men, threatening the ultei
extermination of the Mormons; he immediately returned to Clay county and ordered
out a sufficient military force to quell the mob. Immediately after they were dispersed
and the army returned, the mob collected again soon after; we again applied for mili-
tary aid, when General Doniphan came out with a force ot sixty armed men to Par
West • but thev were in such a state of insubordination that he said he could not con-
trol them, and it was thought advisable by Colonel Hinkle, Mr. and olhe **
that they should return home ; General Doniphan ordered Colonel Hinkle m cad out
the militia of Caldwell and defend the town against the mob, for, said he, You have
great reason to be alarmed, for Neil Gillum, from the Platte country, had come
down with 200 armed men and had taken up their station at Hunter s miU. a place dis-
tant about seventeen or eighteen mile north west of the town of Par West where about
seventy families of the Mormon people had settled upon the bank of the Missouri river
at a little town called De Witt. A messenger, whilst he was yet,talk-
ing cam e in from De Witt, staling that three or four hundred men had assembled to-
gether at that place armed cap-a-pie, and that they threatened the utter extinction of
the citizens of that place if they-did not leave the place immediately, and they had
also surrounded the town and cut off all supplies of food, so that many ol them woie
suffering with hunger. Genera! Doniphan seemed to be much alarmed, and appeared
to be willing to do all he could to assist, and to relieve the sufferings of the Mormon
people; he advised that a petition be immediately got up and sent to the Governor. A
petition was accordingly prepared and a .messenger despatched to the
Governor, and another petition was sent to Judge King. Ihe Mormon people t.irough-
out the country were in a great state of alarm, and also in distress : they saw them-
selves completely surrounded with armed forces on the north and on the north west,
and on the south ; and also Bogart, who was a Methodist preacher, and who was then a
volunteer capt. over a militia company of fifty soldiers, but who hod added to his uam her
out of the surrounding counties about one hundred more, which made his force abom lm)
strong, was stationed at Crooked Creek, sending out his scouting parlies, taking men,
women, and children prisoners-driving off cattle,, horses, and hogs -entering into
every house on Log and Long Creeks, rifling their houses of their most precious arti-
cles, such as money, bedding, and clothing—taking all their old muskets or their ufles
or military implements—threatening the people with instant death it they did not de-
liver up all their precious things, and enter into a covenant to leave the stale oi go !o ihe,
city of Far West by the next morning, saying that “ They calculated to urtve the people
into Far West and then drive them into hell.” Gillum was also doing the same on the
north west side of Far West; and Serciel Woods, a Presbyterian minister, was the
volunteer leader of the mob la Davies county; and a vary noted man (the
Kevercnd Abbott Hancock) of the same society, was the leader oi
the mob in Carroll county; and they were also sending out their scout-
ing parties, robbing and pillaging houses, driving away hogs, horses, and cattle—taking
men, women, and children and driving them oft', threatening then lives, and subjecting
them to all manner of abuses that they could invent or think of.
Under this state of alarm, excitement, and distress, the messengers returned from tea


Governor and from the authoi ities, bringing tiro fatal hews that “Timur r, i
got into a difficulty with the citizens, and they niiglthghit buffer 111' T
he could not render them any assistance ! !!"’ S ° T all that he cared '
Ihe people of De Wilt were obliged to leave their homes and go into Far West • hut
anVseveral*

habitat,ontor houses to shelter them, and were huddled together some in tents
others under blankets, while others had no shelter from the inclement offfie wea her
fad' bCSd wiV!7 elia ; b | e T in this awful state of consfernation many
f ad ,® en whilst others had been whipped until they had to swathe uv their
bowels toprevent them from falling out. About this time, General Parks came
lonian 1 and 1 “h u ‘ he commission «d officers that was sent to
tmte oV'?f even! .7, r ” Sniitb ’ Benior ’ went there at the same
i me. On die evening that General Parks arrived at Diahman, Don Carlos Smith’s
wife came into Colonel Wight s about eleven o’clock at night, bringing her two children
"ami !n W* 7% f° 0t Tt Md y ™ B 0,d ’ » bfbe in arms She
came on foot, a distance of three miles, and waded Grand River : the water was
then about waist deep, and the snow about three inches deep. She stated that a party
j h f a gang °j had turned her out of doors, had taken her household goods
and had burned up her house, and she had barely escaped with her life. Her husband at
'XciSffilfeel'inI 1 ' I T,T’ and she was living alone. This cruel transaction
, ' Jp ft.eiings of the people in Diahman, especially Colonel Wight, and he asked
Gtnei al 1 arks in my hearing, How long ice had got to suffer such base violence ? Gen.
dimp ? Sa ri n p e i X n noV f. l 01,g ;” I CoL VViglil thun *sked him what should be
one . Gen. 1 arks told him He should take a company of men, well armed and go
and disperse the mob wherever he should lind any cohered together, and take away their
arms. Col, Wight did so precisely, according to the orders of Gen. Parks. And my
brother Joseph Smith Sen. made no words about it.—And after Col. Wight had dis-
persed the mob, and put a stop to their burning houses belonging to the Mormon people,
and turning women and children out of doors, which they had done up to that time to
the amount of 8 or 10 houses which were consumed to ashes—after being cut short iu
their mtended designs, ihe mob started up a new plan. They moved
their famihes out of the county and set lire to their houses, and not being able to incense
the Mormons to commit crimes; they had recourse to this stratagem to set their houses
mi fire, and sent runners into all the counties adjacent, to declare to the people that the
Mormons had burned up their houses and destroyed their fields, and if the people would
not believe them, they told them to go and see if what they had said was not tiue.
Many people came to see. They saw the houses burning, and being filled with prejudice
they could not be made to believe but the Mormons set them on fire, which deed was
most diabolical and ol the blackest kind, for indeed the Mormons did not set them on
fire nor meddle with their houses or their fields. And the houses that were burnt, to-
gether with the pre-emption rights, and the com in the fields, had all been previously
purchased by the Mormons of the people, and paid for in money, and with waggons
and horses, and with other property, about two weeks before; but they had not taken
possession of the premises; but this wicked transaction was for the purpose of clan-
ties ini ei y exciting the minds ot a prejudiced populace and the Executive, that they
might get an order, that they could the more easily carry out their hellish purposes, in
expulsion, or extermination, or utter extinction of the Mormon people. After witness-
ill? distressed situation of the people in Diahman, my brother Joseph Smith, senior,
amt myself letunied tu the city of Far West, and immediately despatched a messenger
with written documents to General Atchison, stating the facts as they did then exist,
praying lor assistance il possible, and requesting the editor of the “ Far West ” to in-
sert the same in bis newspaper, but he utterly refused to do so. We still hoped to
get assistance from the Governor, and again petitioned him, praying for as-
sistance, setting forth our distressed situation : and in the mean time the presiding Judge
<he County Court issued orders, upon affidavits made to him by the citizens, to the
she»i *l ot the county, to order out the Militia of the county to.stand in constant rcadi-


ness, night and day, to prevent the citizens from being masacred, which fearful situa-
tion they were exposed to every moment. Everything was pcrtentious and alarm-
ing. Notwithstanding all this, there was a ray of hope yet existing in the minds of the
people that the Governor would render us assistance; and whilst the people were wait-
ing anxiously for deliverance—men, women, and children frightened, praying and weep-
ing—we beheld at a distance, crossing the prairies and approaching the town, a large
army in military array, brandishing their swords in the sunshine, and we could
not but feel joyful for a moment, thinking that probably the Governor had sent unarmed
force to our relief, notwithstanding the awful forebodings that pervaded our breasts.
But to our great surprise, when the army arrived and formed a line in double
file in one half mile on the east of the city of. Far West, and despatched three mes-
sengers with a white flag to come to the city. They were met by Captain Morey with
r few other individuals, whose names Ido not now recollect. 1 was myself standing
alone by, and could very distinctly hear every word they said- Being filled with anxiety,
I rushed forward to the spot, hoping to hear good news but alas! and heart-
thrilling to every soul that heard them —they demanded three persons to be brought
out of the city before they should massacre the rest! The names of the persons they
demanded, were Adam Lightner, John Cleminsun, and his wife. Immediately the
three persons were brought forth to hold an interview with the officers who had made
the demand, and the officers told them they had now a chance to save their lives, tor
they calculated to destroy the people and lay the city in ashes. 1 hey replied to the
officers and said, “If the people must be destroyed, and the city burned to ashes, wo
tcill remain in the city and die with them .” The officers immediately returned, and
the army retreated and encamped about a mile and a half from the city. A messenger
was immediately despatched with a while flag from the Colonel of Mihtia of Far West,
reauesting an interview with General Atchison and General Domphan; but as the
messenger approached the camp, he was shot at by Bogart, the Methodist preacher.
The name of the messenger was Charles C. Rich, who ts now Brigadier-General in he
Nauvoo Legion. However, he gained permission to see General Doniphan; he also
requested an interview with General Atchison. General Domphan said 1 hat General
Atchison had been dismounted by a special order of the Governor a few miles bacic.
and had been sent back to Liberty, Clay county.” He also slated that the reason was,
that he (Atchison,) was too merciful unto the Mormons, and Boggs would not let him
have the command, but had given it to General Lucas, who was from Jackson county,
and whose heart had become hardened by his former acts of rapine and bloodshed, he
being one of the leaders in murdering, driving, plundering, and burning some two or
three hundred houses belonging to the Mormon people m that county, in the years ib.-i
an Mr 8 Rich requested General Doniphan to spare the people, and not suffer them (o be
massacred untilthe next morning, it then being evening. He coolly agreed that he
would not, and also said that “ He had not as yet received the Governor s order but
exuocted it every hour, and should not make any further move until he had received it;
but he would not make any promises so far as regarded Neil Gillum s army, he having
arrived a few minutes previously, and joined the mam body of the army; he knowing
well at what hour to form a junction with the, main body. Mr Rich then returned to
the city, giving this information. The Colonel immediately despatched a second mes-
senger' with a white flag, to request another interview with General Domphan, m order
to touch his sympathy and compassion, and if it were possible, for him to use ins best
endeavors to preserve the lives of the people. On the return of tins messenger, we
learned that several persons had been killed by some of the soldiers who were under
the command of General Lucas. One Mr. Carey had his brains knocked, out by the
batch of a gun, and he lay bleeding several hours, but his famny were not permuted to
approach him, nor any one else allowed to administer relief to him whilst he lay upon
the ground in the agonies of death. Mr. Carey had just arrived -in the country, from
tho state of Ohio, only a few hours previous to the arrival of the army. He had a family
consistin'* of a wife and several small children. He was buried by Lucius N. Scovil,
who fs now the senior warden of the Nauvoo Lodge. Another man at the same time
had his skull laid bare the width of a manjs hand, and he lay to all appeaiance, m the
agonies of death for several hours; but, by the permission of General Domphan, his
/fiends brought him out of the camp, and with good nursing he slowly lecoveml, and
is now ’lying. There was another man, whose name is Powell, who was beat on the

would Whoop and hail ,o and yell as nearly like Indians as they could and continued
to do so a.l that night. In the morning early the Cnlonot n f mu r ’ , nued
into the camp wnh a white flag, to have another interview with
bus return, he informed us that the Governor’s order had arrived. General Doninhan
said that the order of the Governor was, to exterminate the Mormons by G-d but
he would be d—-dxt he obeyed that order, but General Lucas
pleased. We immediately learned from Genera! Doniphan that “ the Governor’s
? rd f* , ba ‘ { iad f n " lv . ed onl y a copy of the original, and that the original order was
in the hands of Major-General Clark, who was on his way to Far West with an addi
tional army of s.x thousand men.” Immediately after this, there came in o the cUv a
messenger from Haun’s Mill, bringing the intelligence of an awful massac e of ff.e
people who were resnhng m that place, and that a force of two or three hundred de
tached from the mam body of the army, under the superior command of Colonel
Ashley, but under the immediate command of Captain Nehemiah Compstock who the
ay previous had promised them peace and protection, but on receiving a copy of the
Governor s order to exterminate or to expel ” from the hands of Colonel Ashley he
returned upon them the following day and surprised and massacred the whol° popula-
tion ot the town, and then came on to the town of Far West and entered inUcon-
junotmn with the mam body of the army. The messenger informed ns that he himself
w> ha few others fled mto the thickets, which preserved them from the massacre
and on he following morning they returned and collected the dead bodies of the people
and cast them mto a well; and there were upwards of twenty who were dead
tally wounded. 1 here are several of the wounded who are now living in this cS
oGne, of the name of Yocum, has lately had his leg amputated, in consequence of
'Kvoumls he then received. He had a ball shot through his head, which entered near his
eye and came out at the back part of his head, and another ball passed through one of
jus arms. °
biv wwl'fioi , dUr ! ng aU {he ' vhilc ' the y encamped in Far West, continued to
(ay waste fields of corn, making hogs, sheep, and cattle common plunder, and shooting
them down for sport. One man shot, a cow and took a strip of her skin, the width of
bis hand, from her head to her tail, and tied it round a tree to slip his halter into, to tie
his horse to. Ihe city was surrounded with a strong guard, and no man, woman, o-
child was permitted to go out or come in, under (he penalty of death. Many of the
citizens were shot, in attempting to go out to obtain sustenance for themselves and families '
there was one field fenced in, consisting of twelve hundred acres, mostly covered with
corn, which was entirely laid waste by the horses of the army. The next day after the
arrival of the army, towards evening, Colonel Hinkle came up from the eamp request-
ing to see my, brother Joseph, Parley, P. Pratt, Sidney Higdon, Lyman Wight! a >ul


George W. Robinson, stating that the officers of the army wanted a mutual con-
sultation with those men ; also stating that Generals Doniphan, Lucas, Wilson, and
Graham—(however, General Graham is an honorable exception : he did all he could
to preserve the lives of the people, contrary to the order of the Governor,) —he,
Hinkle, assured them that these generals had pledged their sacred honor that they
should not be abused or insulted, but should be guarded back in safety in the morning,
or so soon as the consultation was over. My brother Joseph replied That he did not
know what good he could do in any consultation, as he was only a private individual:
however, he said that he was always willing to do all the good he could, and would obey
every law of the land, and then leave the event with God. They immediately started
with Colonel Hinkle to go down into the camp. As they were going down about half
way to the camp, they met General Lucas with a phalanx of men, with a wing to the
right and to the left, and a four-pounder in the centre. They supposed he was coming
with this strong force to guard them into the camp in safety ; but to their surprise,
when they came up to General Lucas, he ordered his men to surround them, and
L inkle stepped up to the General and said, “ These are the prisoners I agreed to deli-
ver up.” General Lucas drew his sword and said “ Gentlemen, you are my prisoners,”
and about that time the main army were on the march to meet them. They came up
in two divisions, and opened to the right and left, and my brother and his friends were
marched down through their lines, with a strong guard in front, and the cannon in the
rear, to the camp, amidst the whoopings, hallooings, yellings, and shoutings of the
army, which were so horrid and terrific that it frightened the inhabitants of the city. It
is impossible to describe the feelings of horror and distress of the people. After being
thus betrayed, they were placed under a strong guard of thirty men, armed cap-a-pie,
which was relieved every two hours. There they were compelled to lay on the cold
ground that night, and were told in plain language, that they need never expect their
liberties again. So far for their honors pledged. However, this was as much as could
be expected from a mob under the garb of military and executfve authority in the state
of Missouri. On the next day, the soldiers were permitted to patrol the streets, to
abuse and insult the people at their leisure, and enter into houses and pillage them, and
ravish the women, taking away every gun and every other kind of arms or military im-
plements; and about twelve o’clock on that day Colonel Hinkle, came to my house
with an armed force, and delivered me up as a prisoner unto that force. They sur-
rounded me and commanded me to march into the camp. I told them that I could not
go : my family were sick, and I was sick myself, and could not leave home. They
-aid they did not care for that —I must and should go. I asked when they would permit
me to return. They made no answer, but forced me along with the point of the
bayonet into the camp, and pul me under the same guard with my brother Joseph
and within about half an hour afterwards, Amasa Lyman was also brought and placed
under the same guard. There we were compelled to stay all that night, and lie on the
ground. Along some time in the same night, Colonel Hinkle came to me and told
me he had been pleading my case before the Court Martial, but he was afraid he should
not succeed. He said there was a Court Martial then in session, consisting of thirteen
or fourteen officers, Circuit Judge A. A. King, and Mr. Birch, District Attorney; also
Serciel Woods, Presbyterian priest, and about twenty other priests of the different re-
ligious denominations in that country. Ho said they were determined to shoot us on
the next morning, in the public square in Far West. I made him no reply. On the
next morning about sunrise, General Doniphan ordered his brigade to take up the line
of march and leave the camp. He came to us where we were under guard, to shake
hands with us, and bid us farewell. His first salutation was, “By G--d you have been
sentenced by the court martial to be shot this morning ; but 1 will be d dif I will
have any of the honor of it, or any of the disgrace of it; therefore I have ordered my
brigade to take up the line of march and to leave the camp, for I consider it to be cold-
blooded murder, and I bid you farewell,” and he went away. This movement of Gen.
Doniphan made considerable excitement in the army, and there was considerable whis-
pering amongst the officers. We listened very attentively and frequently heard it men-
tioned by the guard, that the d d Mormons would not be shot this time. In a few
moments the guard was relieved with a new set; one of these new guard said That
the d -d Mormons would not be shot this time, for the movement of General Doni-
phan had frustrated the whole plan, and that the officers had called another court
martial, and had ordered us to be taken to Jackson county, and there to be executed.


In a few moments two large wagons drove up, and we were ordered (o get into them
and while wo were getting into them, there came up four or five men, armed, who drew
up, and snapped their guns at us; some flashed in the pan, and others only snapped
hut none of them went off. They were immediately arrested by several officers and
their guns taken from them. It was with much difficulty we could get Gen. Lucas'
permission to go and see our families and get some clothing; but after considerable
consultation, we were permitted to go under a strong guard of five or six men to each
t & Th We permiU f dto B P eak any one of our families, under pain of

within two minutes, and if she did not do it, I should go off without them. I was
obliged to submit to their tyrannical orders, however painful it was, with mv wife and
children clinging to my arms and to the skirts of my garments, and was not'permitted
to utter a word of consolation, and in a moment was hurried awav from them at the
point of the bayonet. We were hurried back to the waggons and'ordered into them
all ul about the same space of time. In the mean time our father, and mother, and
sisters, had forced their way to the waggons to get permission to see us; but were for-
bidden to speak to us; and we were immediately drove off for Independence, Jackson
county. We remained in Independence about one week, when an officer arrived with
author! y from General Clark, to take us back to Richmond, Ray county, where the
Genera had anved with his army to await our arrival. On the morning of our sta*t
lor Richmond, we were informed by General Wilson, that it was expected by the
soldiers that we would be hung up by the necks on the road, while on the march to that
place, and that it was prevented by a demand made for us by General Clark, who had
the command m consequence of seniority, and that it was his prerogative to execute us
himself; and he should give us into the hands of the officer, who would take us to
General Clark, and he might do with us as he pleased. We started in the morning
under our new officer, Colonel Price, of Keytsville, Chariton county, with several other
men to guard us. W# arrived there on Friday evening, the 9th day of November
and were thrust into an old log house, and a strong guard placed over us. After we
had been there for the space of half an hour, there came in a man, who was said to
have some notoriety in the penitentiary, bringing in his hands a quantity of chains and
padlocks. He said he was commanded by General Clark to put us in chains. Imme-
diately the soldiers rose up and pointing their guns at us, placed their thumb on the
cock, and their finger on the trigger; and the states prison keeper went to work, put-
ting a chain around the leg of each man, and fastening it on with a padlock, until we
we were all chained together, seven of us.
In a few moments came in General Clark ; we requested to know of him what was the
cause of all this harsh and cruel treatment.—He refused to give us any information at
that time; but he said he would in a few days ; so we were compelled to continue in
that situation, camping on the floor, all chained together, without any chance or means
to be made comfortable ; having to eat our victuals as it was served up to us, using our
fingeis and teeth instead of knives and forks. While we were in this situation, a young
man of the name of Grant, brother-in-law to my brother William Smith, came to see us,
and put up at the tavern where General Clark made his quarters ; he happened to come
in time to see General Clark make choice of his men, to shoot us on Monday morning,
the 12th day of November ; he saw them make choice of their rifles, and load them with
two balls in each, and after they had prepared their guns, General Clark saluted them
by saving Gentlemen, you shall have the honor of shooting the Mormon leaders on Mon-
day morning at eight o clock !’ But in consequence of the influence of our friends, the
heathen general was intimidated, so that he durst not carry his murderous designs into
execution, and sent a messenger immediately to Fort Levenworth to obtain the military
code of laws. After the messenger’s return, the general was employed nearly a week,
examining the laws: so Monday passed away without our being shot : however, it seemed
like foolishness tome that so great a man as General Clark pretended to he, should have to
search the military law to find out whether preachers of the gospel, who never did mili-
tary duty, could be subject to court martial. However, the general seemed to learn
that fact after searching the military code, and came into the old log cabin where we
were under guard, and in chains, and told ns he had concluded to deliver us over to the
civil authorities; as persons guilty of treason, murder, arson, larceny, theft, and stealing !
The poor deluded General supposed there was a difference between theft, larceny, and
stealing ! Accordingly, we were handed over to the pretended civil authorities. The


next morning our chains were taken off, and we were guarded to the court-house, where
there was a pretended court in session; Austin A. King being the Judge, and Mr.
Birch, the district attorney—-both of whom sat on the court martial when we' were sen-
tenced to be shot. Witnesses were called up and sworn at th e point of the bayonet and
if they would not swear to the things they were told to do, they were threatened with in-
stant death, and Ido know, positively, that the evidence given in by those men whilst
under duress, was false. This state of things was continued twelve or fourteen days :
and after that time, we were ordered by the Judge to introduce some rebutting evidence,
saying, “If we did not do it, we would be thrust into prison.” I could hardly understand
what the Judge meant, for I considered we were in prison already, and could not think
of any thing but the persecutions in the days of Nero ; knowing that it was a religious
persecution, and the court an inquisition : however, we gave him the names of forty
persons who were acquainted with all the persecutions and sufferings of the people.
The Judge made out a subpoena, and inserted the names of those men, and caused it to
be placed in the hands of Bogart the notorious Methodist minister, and he took fifty
armed soldiers and started for Far West. I saw the subpoena given to him and his
company, when they started. In the course of a few days they returned with most of
those forty men, whose names were inserted in the subpoena, and thrust them into
prison, and we were not permitted to bring one of them before the court; but the
.fudge turned upon us with an air of indignation and said, “ Gentlemen, you must get
your witnesses, or you shall be committed to jail immediately ; for we are not going to
hold the court open on expense much longer, for you any how.” We felt very much
distressed and oppressed at that time. Colonel Wight said, “ What shall we do ?
Our witnesses are all thrust into prison, and probably will be, and we have no
power to do any thing: of course we must submit to this tyranny and oppression ; we
cannot help ourselves.” Several others made similar expressions in the agony of their
souls; but my brother Joseph did not say any thing. However, it was considered best
by General Doniphan and Lawyer Reese, that we should try* and get some wit nesses
before the pretended court. Accordingly, I myself gave the names of about twenty
other persons; the Judge inserted them in a subpoena, and caused it to be placed iu
the hands of Bogart the Methodist priest, and he again started with his fifty soldiers
to take those men prisoners, as he had done to the forty others. The Judge sat and
laughed at the good opportunity of getting the names, that they might the more easily
capture them, and so bring them down to be thrust into prison, in order to prevent us
from getting the truth before the pretended court, of which he was the chief inquisitor
or conspirator. Bogart returned from his second expedition with only one prisoner,
whom he also thrust into prison.
The people at Far West had learned the intrigue and had left the stale, having been
made acquainted with the treatment of the former witnesses. But we, on learning that
we could not obtain witnesses, whilst privately consulting with each other what we
should do, discovered a Mr. Allen, standing by the window on the outside of the house,
and beckoned to him as though w>e woujd have him come in. At that time Judge King
retorted upon us again, saying, “Gentlemen, are you not going to introduce some wit-
nesses ?” also saying it was the last day he should hold the court open for us, and if we
did not rebut the testimony that had been given against us, he should have to commit
us to jail. I had then got Mr. Allen into the house, and before the court, so called. I
told the Judge we had one witness, if he would be so good as to put him under oath :
beseemed unwilling to do so; but after a few moments consultation, the stale’s
attorney arose and said he should object to that witness being sworn, and that he should
object to that witness giving in his evidence at all; stating that this was not a court to
try the case, but only a court of investigation on the part of the stale. Upon this
General Doniphan arose, and said “He would be G;—d d dif the witness should
not be sworn, and that it was a d d shame these defendants should be treated in
this manner; that they could not be permitted to get one witness before the court,
whilst all their witnesses even forty at a time, have been taken by force of arms, and
thrust into the ‘bull-pen’ in order to prevent them from giving their testimony.” After
Doniphan sat down the Judge permitted the witness to be sworn, and enter upon his
testimony. But so soon as he began to speak, a man by the name of Cook, who was
a brother-in-law to priest Bogart, the Methodist, and who was a lieutenant, and whose
place at that time, was to superintend the guard'stepped in before the pretended court,
and took him by (lie nape of the neck and jammed his head down under the pole or


log of wood, that was placed up around the place were the inquisition was sitting to
keep the by-standers from intruding upon the majesty of the inquisitors, and jammed
him along to the door, and kicked him out of doors. Ho instantly turned to some sol-
diers who by him, and said to them, “ Go and shoot him, d-n him, shoot
him, d—n him”. The soldiers ran after the man to shoot him :he fled for his life, and
with great difficulty made his escape. The pretended court immediately arose, and we
were ordered to be carried to Liberty, Clay county, and there to be thrust into jail. We
endeavored to find out for what cause, but all we could learn was because we were
Mormons. *
The next morning a large wagon drove up to the door, and a blacksmith came into
the house with some chains and handcuffs. He said his orders were from the Judge
to handcuff us, and chain us together. He informed us that the Judge made out a mit-
timus, and sentenced us to jail for treason; he also said the Judge had done this that
we might not get bail; he also said the Judge had stated his intention to keep us in jail
until all the M ormons were driven out of the state ; he also said that the Judge had
further stated that if he let us out before the Mormons had left the stale, that we
would not let them leave, and there would be another d d fuss kicked up ; I also
heard the Judge say myself, whilst he was sitting in his pretended court, “That there was
no law for us, nor the Mormons, in the state of Missouri: that he had sworn to see
them exterminated, and to see the Governor’s order executed to the very letter, and that
he would do so ! However, the blacksmith proceeded to pul the irons upon us, and we
were ordered into the waggon and they drove off for Clay county, and as we journeyed
along on the road, wo were exhibited to the inhabitants ; this course was adopted all
the way ; thus making a public exhibition of us, until we arrived at Liberty, Clay
county. There wo were tin ust into prison again, and locked up : and were held there
in confinement for the space of six months: our place of lodging was the square
side of hewed white oak logs ! and our food was anything but good and decent. Poison
was administered to us tßree or four times. The effect it had upon our system, was, that
it vomited us almost to death, and then we would lay some two or three days in a tor-
pid, stupid state, not even caring or wishing for life. The poison would inevitably have
proved fatal, had not the power of Jehovah interposed in our behalf, to save us from
their wicked purpose. We were also subjected to the necessity of eating human
flesh ! for the space of five days, or go without food, except a little coffee, or a little
corn bread, the latter I chose in preference to the former. We none of us partook of
the flesh except, Lyman Wight: we also heard the guard which was placed over us mak-
ing sport of us, saying that “They had fed us upon Mormon beef!” I have described the
appearance of this flesh to several experienced physicians, and they have decided that
it was human flesh. We learned afterwards, by one of the guard, that it was supposed
that that act of savage cannibalism, in feeding us with human flesh, would be considered
a popular deed of notoriety ; but the people on learning that it would not take, tried to
* The following is an extract from the testimony of Sidney Rigdon :
While I was laying sick in prison, I had an opportunity of hearing a great deal said
by those of them who would come in. The subject was the all-absorbing one. I
beard them say “ That wc must be put to death—that the character of the state required
it. The state must justify herself in the course she bad taken, and nothing but
punishing us with death, could save the credit of the state, and it must therefore be
done.”
I heard a party of them one night tolling about some female whose person they had
violated, and this language was used by one of them “ The d d bitch how she
yelled." Who this person was, I did not know ; but before I got out of prison, I heard
that a widow whose husband had died some few months before, with consumption, had
been brutally violated by a gang of them, and died in their hands, leaving three little
children, in whose presence the scene of brutality took place.
After 1 got out of prison, and had arrived in Quincy, Illinois, I met a strange man in
the street, who was inquiring, and inquired of me respecting a circumstance of this
kind—saying “ He had heard of it, and was on his way to Missouri to get the chil-
dren if he could find them.” He said the woman thus murdered was his sister, or his
wife’s sister, lam not positive which. The man was in great agitation. What success
he had I know not.


keep it secret; but the fact was noised abroad before they took that precaution. While
we were incarcerated in prison, we petitioned the Supreme Court of the Slate of Missouri
for habeas corpus, twice, but we were refused both times by Judge Reynolds, who is
now Govenor of that state. We also petitioned one of the county Judges for a writ of
habeas corpus, which was granted in about three weeks afterwards; but were not per-
mitted to have any trial; we were only taken out of jail and kept out for a few hours,
and then remanded back again. In the course of three or four days after that time',
Judge Turnham came into the jail in the evening, and said “He had permitted Mr!
Rigdon to get bail,” but said he had to do it in the night, and had also to get away in
the night, and unknown to any of the citizens, or they would kill him ; fur they had
sworn to kill him if they could find him; and as to the rest of us, he dared not let us
go, for fear of his own life, as well as ours. He said it was hard to be confined under
such circumstances, for he knew we were innocent men, and he said the people also
knew it; and that it was only a persecution and treachery, and the scenes of Jackson
county acted over again, for fear that we would become too numerous in that
upper country. He said “The plan was concocted from the governor down to the lowest
judge, and that that wicked Baptist priest, Riley, was riding into town every day
to watch the people, stirring up the minds of the people against us all he could, exciting
them, and stirring up their religious prejudices against us, for fear they would let u 3 go.”
Mr. Rigdon, however, got bail and made his escape into Illinois. The jailor, Samuel
Tillery, Esq., told us also, “ That the whole plan was concocted from the governor down
to the lowest judge in that upper country, early the previous spring, and that the plan
was more fully carried out at the time General Atchison went down to Jefferson county
with Generals Wilson, Lucas, and Gillum, the self-styled “ Delaware Chief.” 'Phis
was some time in the month of September, when the mob was collected at l)e Witt,
Carroll county. He also said “That the governor w-asnow ashamed enough of the whole
transaction, and would be glad to set us at liberty, if he dared to do it; but, said he, you
need not be concerned, for the governor has laid a plan for your release. He also said
that Squire Birch, the state’s attorney, was appointed to be Circuit Judge, on the cir-
cuit passing through Davies county, and that he (Birch) was instructed to fix the
the papers, so that we would be clear from any incumbrance, in a very short
time.
Sometime in April we were taken to Davies county, as they said, to have a trial ; but
when we arrived at that place, instead of finding a court or a jury, w e found another
inquisition, and Birch, who was the district attorney, the same man who w-as one of the
court martial when we were sentenced to death, was now the circuit Judge of that pre-
tended court; and the giand jury that were empannelled, were at the massacre at
Haim’s Mill, and lively actors in that awful, solemn, disgraceful, cool-blooded murder/,
and all the pretence they made of excuse, was, they had done it because the governor
ordered them to do it. The same jury sat as a jury in the day time, and were placed
over us as a guard in the night time. They tantalized and boasted over us, of their
great achievements at Haun’s Mills, and at other places, telling us how many houses
they had burned, and how many sheep, cattle, and hogs they had driven off, belonging
to the Mormons, and how many rapes they had committed, and what squealing and
kicking there was among the d d bitches; saying "That they lashed one woman upon
one of the d—d Mormon meeting benches , tying her hands and feet fast , and sixteen of
them abused her as much as they had a mind to, and then left her bound and exposed in
that distressed condition.” These fiends of the lower region boasted of these acts of
baibarity, and tantalized our feelings with them for ten days. We had heard of these
acts of cruelty previous to this time, but we were slow to believe that such acts of cruelty
had been perpetrated. The lady who was the subject of this brutality, did not recover her
health, so as to be able to help herself, for more than three months afterwards. This grand
jury constantly celebrated their achievements with grog and glass in hand, like the
Indian warriors at their war dances, singing and telling each other of their exploits, in
murdering the Mormons, in plundering their houses, and carrying off their property.
And all this was done in the presence of the great Judge Birch, who had previously
said in our hearing, “ That there was no law for the Mormons in the state of Missouri.”
His brother was then the district attorney in that circuit, and if any thing was a greater
cannibal than the Judge. After all these ten days of drunkenness, we were informed-
that we w'ere indicted for “ treason, murder, arson, larceny, theft, and stealing.” We
askedt for a change of venue from that county to Marion county, but they would not


grant if; but they gave us a change of venue from Davies to Boon county • and a mitti-
mus was made out by the pretended Judge Birch, without date, name, or place. They
fifed us out with a two horse waggon, and horses, and four men besides the sheriff to>
bo our guard : there were five of us. We started from Gallatin the sun about two
hours high, p.m., and went as far as Diahman that evening and staid till morning
There we bought two horses of the guard and paid for one of them in clothing which
we had with us, and for the other we gave our note. We went down that day as far
as Judge Morin’s, a distance of some four or five miles. There we staid until the
morning, when we started on our journey to Boon county, and travelled on the road
about twenty miles distance. There was bought a jug of whiskey, of which the
guard drank freely. While there the sheriff showed us the mittimus, before re-
ferred to, without date or signature, and said that Judge Birch told him never to carry
us to Boon county, and to show the mittimus; and said he, I shall take a good drink
of grog and go to bed; and you may do as you have a mind to. Three others of the
guard drank pretty freely of whiskey sweetened with honey; they also went to bed,
and were soon asleep ; and the other guard went along with us, and helped us to saddle
the horses. Two of ns mounted the horses, and the other three started on foot and we
look our change of venue for the State of Illinois; and in the course of nine or ten
days arrived safely at Quincy, Adams county, where we found our families in a state
of poverty, although in good health ; they having been driven out of the state pre-
viously, by the murderous militia, under the exterminating order * of the Executive of
Missouri; and now the people of that state, or a portion of them, would be <dad to make
the people of this state believe that my brother Joseph has committed treason, for the
purpose of keeping up their murderous and hellish persecution. They seem to be
unrelenting, and thirsting for the blood of innocence; for I do know most positively, that
my brother Joseph has committed no treason, nor violated one solitary item of law or
rule, in the state of Missouri.
But I do know that the Mormon people, en masse, were driven out of that state, after
being robbed of all they had, and they barely escaped with their lives : as well as my

HEAD QUARTERS OF THE MILITIA,
, City of Jefferson,
_ October, 27th, 1838,
Sir, —
Since the order of the morning to you, directing you to come with four hundred
mounted men, to be raised within your division ; I have received, by Amos Rees, Esq
and Wiley C. Williams, Esq., one of my aids, information of the most appalling
character, which changes entirely the face of things, and places the Mormons in the
attitude of an avowed defiance of the laws, and of having made war upon the people of
the state. Your orders are therefore, to hasten your operations and endeavor to reach
Richmond in Ray county, with all possible speed. The Mormons must be treated as
enemies, and must be exterminated, or driven from the state, if necessary for the
public good.
Their outrages are beyond all description. If you can increase your force, you are
authorized to do so, to any extent you may think necessary. I have just issued orders to
Major-General Wollock of Marion county, to raise five hundred men, and to march
them to the northern part of Davies county, and there to unite with General Doniphan
of Clay—who has been ordered with five hundred men to proceed to the same point for
the purpose of intercepting the retreat of the Mormons to the north. They have been
directed to communicate with you by express. You can also communicate with (hem
if you find it necessary. Instead, therefore, of proceeding as at first directed, to re-
instate the citizens of Davies in their houses, you will proceed immediately to Rich-
mond, and there operate against the Mormons. Brigadier-General Parks of Rav has
been ordered, to have four hundred of his Brigade in readiness to join you at Richmond.
The whole force will be placed under your command.

brother Joseph, who barely escaped -with his life, and all this in conse-
quence of the exterminating order of Governor Boggs, (he same being confirmed by the
Legislature of that state. And Ido know—so does this court, and every rational man
who is acquainted with the circumstances, and every man who shall hereafter become
acquainted with the particulars thereof —will know, that Governor Boggs, and Generals
Clark, Lucas, Wilson, and Gillum, also Austin A. King, have committed treason upon
the citizens of Missouri, and did violate the constitution of the United States, and
also the constitution and laws of the state of Missouri; and did exile and expel at the
point of the bayonet some twelve or fifteen thousand inhabitants of the state and did
murder some three or four hundreds of men , teamen, and children in cold blood, in
the most horrid and cruel manner possible, and the whole of it was caused by religious
bigotry and persecution, because the Mormons dared to worship Almighty God ac-
cording to the dictates of their own consciences, and agreeably to His divine will, as
revealed in the scriptures of eternal truth; and had turned away from following the
vain traditions of their fathers ; and would not worship according to the dogmas and
commandments of those men who preach for hire and divine for money, and teach for
doctrine the precepts of men—expecting that the constitution of the United States
would have protected them therein. But notwithstanding the Mormon people had pur-
chased upwards of two hundred thousand dollars worth of land, most of which was
entered and paid for at the land office of the United States in the state of Missouri—
and although the President of the United States has been made acquainted with these
facts, and the particulars of our persecution and oppressions, by petition to him and to
Congress yet they have not even attempted to restore the Saints to their rights, or
given any assurance that we may hereafter expect redress from them. And Ido also
know, most positively and assuredly, that my brother, Joseph Smith, senior, has not
been in the state of Missouri, since the spring of the year 1839. And further this de-
ponent saith not.

CHAPTER X.
After this trial, the Governor of Missouri requested the Governor of Illinois to order
out the militia to re-take Joseph, but this the Governor refused to do. However,
every effort was made to excite the minds of the people against our whole society, and
some outrages were committed. Parties of Missourians would cross the river, and kid-
nap individuals of our society and abuse them in the most barbarous manner, by strip-
ping, whipping, &c. Daniel and Philander Avery (father and son) were among those
treated in this manner. About this time Joseph Smith made the following “ Appeal”
to the citizens of the state or Vermont, (his native state) praying them to exert their
influence, in a legislative capacity, to bring Missouri to justice, and oblige her to desist
from her relentless persecutions; and from the life-like poitraiture of himself which
appears in every sentence, the reader can form some idea of the largeness of his
heart, the nobleness of his soul, and the true philanthrophy that burned within his
breast.


AN APPEAL,
TO THE FREEMEN OF THE STATE OF VERMONT, “ THE BRAVE GREEN
MOUNTAIN BOYS,” AND HONEST MEN.
I was born in Sharon, Vermont, in 1805,—where the first quarter of my life grew
with the growth, and strengthened with the strength of the “ first-born ” State of the
“ United Ihirteen. From the oid French war to the final consummation of American
Independence, my fathers, heart to heart, and shoulder to shoulder, with the noble fathers
of our liberty, fought and bled; and with the most of that venerable band of patriots they
have gone to rest—bequeathing a glorious country, with all her inherent rights, to’mil-
lions of posterity. Like other honest citizens, I not only, (when manhood came )
sought my own peace, prosperity, and happiness; but also the peace, prosperity and
happiness of my friends: and, with all the rights ana realm before me, and the revela-
tions of Jesus Christ, to guide me into all truth; I had good reason to enter into the blessings
and privileges of an American citizen the rights of a Green mountain boy, ♦ unmoles-
ted, and enjoy life and religion, according to the most virtuous and enlightened cus-
toms, rules, and etiquette of the nineteenth century. But to the disgrace of the United
States, it is not so. These rights and privileges, together with a largo amount of pro-
perty, have been wrested from me and thousands of my friends, by lawless mobs in
Missouri, supported by executive authority : and the crime of plundering our property ;
and the unconstitutional and barbarous act of expulsion 5 and even the inhumanity of
murdering men, women, and children, have received the password of “justifiable,” by
legislative enactments, and the horrid deeds, doleful and disgraceful as they are, ’have
been paid for by government.
In vain have we sought for redress of grievances, and a restoration to our rights and
the remuneration for our property, in the halls of Congress, and at the hands of the
President. The only consolation yet experienced from these highest tribunals, and
mercy seats of our bleeding country, is, that “ Our cause is just, but the government
has no power to redress us.”f
Our arms were forcibly taken from us by these Missouri marauders; and in spite of
every effort to have them returned, the state of Missouri still retains them, and
the United States militia law, with this fact before the government, still compels us to do
military duty, and for the lack of said arms the law enforces us to pay our fines.
Several hundred thousand dollars worth of land in Missouri, was purchased at the
United States’ Land Offices in that district of country ; and the money, without doubt,
has been appropriated to strengthen the army and navy, or increase the power and glory
of the nation in some other way : and notwithstanding Missouri has robbed and mobbed
me and twelve or fifteen thousand innocent inhabitants, murdered' hundreds, and ex-
pelled the residue at the point of the bayonet, without law, contrary to the express lan-
guage of the constitution of the United States, and every state in the Union ; and con-
trary to the custom and usage of civilized nations ; and especially, one holding up the
motto; “ The asylum of the oppressed;” | yet the comfort we receive, to raise our
wounded bodies, and invigorate our troubled spirits, on account of such immense sacri-
fices of life, property, patience, and right; and as an equivalent for the enormous taxes
we are compelled to pay to support these functionaries in a dignified manner, after we
have petitioned, and pleaded with tears, and been showed like a caravan of foreign ani-
mals, for the peculiar gratification of connoisseurs in humanity, that flare along in
public life, like lamps upon lamp posts, because they are better calculated for the
schemes of the night than the scenes of the day, is, as President Van Buren, said
“ Your cause is just, but government has no power to redress you,
No wonder, after the Pharisee’s prayer, the publican smote his breast and said,
“Lord be merciful to me a sinner!” What must the manacled nations think of free-
men’s rights in the land of liberty ?
* Green Mountain boy : a term, in America, applied to the citizens of Vermont,
f Such was the language of President Van Burcn.
t The motto of Missouri.


Now, therefore, having failed in every attempt to obtain satisfaction at the tribunals
■where all men seek for it according to the rules of right—l am compelled to appeal to
the honor and patriotism of my native state; to the clemency and valor of “ Green
Mountain Boys:” tor, throughout the various periods of the world, whenever a nation,
kingdom, state, family, or individual has received an insult, or an injury, from a su-
perior force, (unless satisfaction was made) it has been the custom to call in the aid of
friends to assist in obtaining redress. For proof we have only to refer to the recovery
of Lot and his effects, by Abraham, in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah; or, to turn
to the relief afforded by France and Holland, for the achievement of the independence
of these United States: without bringing up the great bulk of historical facts, rules,
decrees, treaties, and Bible records, by which nations have been governed, to show that
mutual alliance, for the general benefit of mankind, to retaliate and repel foreign ag-
gressions; to punish and prevent home wrongs, when the conservators of justice and the
laws have failed to afford a remedy, are not only common, and in the highest sense
justifiable and wise, but they are also, proper expedients to promote the enjoyment of
equal rights, the pursuit of happiness, the preservation of life, and the benefit of pos-
terity.
With all these facts before me, and a pure desire to ameliorate the condition of the
poor and unfortunate among men, and if possible to entice all men from evil to good ;
and with a firm reliance that God will reward the just, I have been stimulated to call
upon my native state for a “ union of all honest men;” and to appeal to the valor of
“ Green Mountain Boys” by all honorable methods and means to assist me in obtaining
justice from Missouri: not only for the property she has stolen and confiscated, the
murders she has committed among my friends, and for our expulsion from the state,
but also to humble and chastise, or abase her for the disgrace she has brought upon con-
stitutional liberty, until she atones for her sins.
I appeal also, to the fraternity of brethren, who are bound by kindred ties to assist
a brother in distress, in all cases where it can be done according to the rules of the
order, to extend the boon of benevolence and protection, in avenging the Lord of his
enemies, as if a Solomon, a Hiram, a St. John, or a Washington raised his eyes before
a wondering world, and exclaimed ;—“ My life for his !” Life, liberty, and virtue for
ever !”
I bring this appeal before my native state for the solemn reason that an injury has
been done, and crimes have been committed, which a sovereign stale of the Federal
compact, one of the great family of 11 E pluribus unum,” refuses to compensate, by
consent of parties, rules of law, customs of nations, or in any other way : I bring it
also, because the national Government has fallen short of affording the necessary relief,
as before stated, for want of power, leaving a large body of her own free citizens,
whose wealth went freely into her treasury for lands, and whose gold and silver for
taxes still fills the pockets of her dignitaries, “in ermine and lace,” defrauded,
robbed, mobbed, plundered, ravished, driven, exiled, and banished from the “ Inde-
pendent Republic of Missouri!”
And in this appeal let me say : Raise your towers; pile your monuments to the skies ;
build your steam frigates; spread yourselves far and wide, and open the iron eyes of
your bulwarks by sea and land ; and let the towering church steeples, marshall the
country, like the “dreadful splendor” of an army with bayonets: but remember the
flood of Noah; remember the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah; remember the dispersion
and confusion at the Tower of Babel; remember the destruction of Pharaoh and his
hosts; remember the hand-writing upon the wall, “ Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin ;”
remember the angel’s visit to Sennacherib, and the 185.000 Assyrians; remember the
end of the Jews and Jerusalem; and remember the Lord Almighty will avenge the
blood of his Saints that now crimsons the skirts of Missouri! Shall wisdom cry aloud
and not her speech be heard ?
Has the majesty of American liberty sunk into such vile servitude and oppression,
that justice has fled ? Has the glory and influence of a Washington, an Adams, a
Jefferson, a Lafayette, and a host of others for ever departed,—and the wrath of Cain,
a Judas, and a Nero, whirled forth in the heraldry of hell, to sprinkle our garments
with blood; and lighten the darkness of midnight, with the blaze of our dwellings ?
Where is the patriotism of ’76 ? Where is the virtue of our forefathers ? and where
is the sacred honor of freemen ?
Must we, because we believe in the fulness ef the gospel of Jesus Christ, the ad


ministration of angels, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, like the prophets and
apostles of old,—must we be mobbed with impunity—be exiled from our habitations and
property without remedy; murdered without mercy—and Government find the
weapons, and pay the vagabonds for doing the job, and give them the plunder into the
bargain? Must we, because we believe in enjoying the constitutional privilege and
right of worshipping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own consciences;
and because we believe in repentance and baptism for the remission of sins ; the gift of
the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the hands; the resurrection of the dead ; the mil-
leuium; the day of judgment; and the Book of Mormon as the history of the abori-
gines of this continent,—must we be expelled from the institutions of our country ; the
rights of citizenship, and the graves of our friends and brethren, and the Government
leek the gate of humanity, and shut the door of redress against us ? If so, farewell
freedom ; adieu to personal safety,—and let the red-hot wrath of an offended God
purify the nation of such sinks of corruption! for that realm is hurrying to ruin where
vice has the power to expel virtue.
My father, who stood several times in the battles of the American Revolution, till
his companions in arms had been shot dead at his feet, was forced from his home in
Far West, Missouri, by those civilized, or satanized, savages, in the dreary season of
winter, to seek a shelter in another slate; and the vicissitudes and sufferings consequent
to his flight, brought his honored grey head to the grave, a few months after. And my
youngest brother also, in the vigor and bloom of youth, from his great exposure and
fatigue in endeavoring to assist his parents on their journey, (I and my brother Hyrum
being in chains, in dungeons—where they tried to feed us upon human flesh—in Mis-
souri,) was likewise so debilitated that he found a premature grave shortly after my
father. And my mother, too, though she yet lingers among us, from her extreme ex-
posure in that dreadful tragedy, was filled with rheumatic affections and other diseases,
which leaves her no enjoyment of health. She is sinking in grief and pain, broken
hearted, from Missouri persecution.
0 death ! wilt thou not give to every honest man a heated dart, to sting those wretches
while they pollute the land ? and O grave wilt thou not open the trap-door to the pit of
ungodly men, that they may stumble in ?
1 appeal to the “ Green Mountain Boys ” of my native state, to arise in the majesty
of virtuous freemen, and by all honorable means help to bring Missouri to the bar of
justice. If there is one whisper from the spirit of an Ethan Allen; or a
gleam from the shade of a General Stark, let it mingle with our sense of honor, and fire
our bosoms for the cause of suffering innocence,—for the reputation of our disgraced
country, and for the glory of God ; and may all the earth bear me witness, if Missouri,
blood-stained Missouri—escapes the due demerit of her crimes, the vengeance she so
justly deserves, that Vermont is a hypocrite—a coward —and this nation the hot bed of
political demagogues!
I make this appeal to the sons of liberty of my native state for help, to frustrate the
wicked designs of sinful men—l make it to still the violence of mobs —I make it to
cope with the unhallowed influence of wicked men in high places—l make it to resent
the insult and injury made to an innocent, unoffending people, by a lawless ruffian state
—I make it to obtain justice where law is put at defiance—l make it to wipe off the
stain of blood from our nation’s escutcheon —I make it to show presidents, governors,
and rulers, prudence—l make it to fill honorable men with discretion—l make it to'
teach senators wisdom—l make it to learn judges justice—l make it to point clergymen
to the path of virtue—and I make it to turn the hearts of this nation to the truths and
realities of pure and undefiled religion, that they may escape the perdition of ungodly
men; and Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is my Great Counsellor.
Wherefore let the rich and the learned, the wise and the noble, the poor and the
needy, the bond and the free, both black and white, take heed to their ways, and cleave
to the knowledge of God; and execute justice and judgment upon the earth in
righteousness; and prepare to meet the Judge of the quick and the dead, for the hour
of his coming is nigh.
And I must go on as the herald of grace,
Till the wide-spreading conflict is over,
And burst through the curtains of tyrannic night,
Yea, I must go on to gather our race,


Till the high blazing flame of Jehovah,
Illumines the globe as a triumph of right.
As a friend of equal rights to all men, and a messenger of the everlasting gospel of
Jesus Christ.
I have the honor to be,
Your devoted servant,
XT T „. JOSEPH SMITH.
Nauvoo, Illinois, December, 1843.
CHAPTER XI.
However, nothing that he could do, or say, would satisfy the people. His religion
was odious to them; he professed to have the testimony of Jesus which is the Spirit of
prophecy he professed to be an apostle of Jesus Christ; he taught the doctrine of
faith, repentance, and baptism for the remission of sins, and the laying on of hands for
the gift of the Holy Ghost: he solemnly declared the Book of Mormon to be a true
record, which was revealed to him by an angel of God. He professed to believe in all
the gifts and blessings which flow from the Holy Ghost, such as is recorded in the
12th chapter Ist Corinthians. lie taught the literal gathering of the Jews to Jerusa-
lem on the eastern continent, and the Saints to Zion on the western. He taught the
literal and personal reign of Christ upon the earth for one thousand years previous to
the last judgment. He testified that God had given him revelations and had authorized
him to preach the gospel in its fulness, and to warn the people to repent or they would
perish. These were his crimes and his only ones. The compiler of this history was
personally acquainted with him, and resided near him for nearly a twelve-month; and
I can testify that Joseph Smith was a moral and an upright man: —he was just in all
his dealings; he was a kind husband, and an affectionate father : in his manly breast
glowed all the pure feelings of real benevolence and true philanthropy : he was ever
kind and forgiving,—was long-suffering, and patient; and endured his unheard-of-
persecutions and distresses with meekness and cheerfulness, and mourned only for the
sore afflictions and tribulations of his brethren : with them he truly sympathized, and
O how often was his warm heart melted at the sight of their sufferings. He was a man
ot God, mighty in word and in deed; and his comprehensive mind sought after know-
ledge as for hidden treasures, and brought forth many great and sublime truths, that
have lain hid for centuries ; and when eternal ages shall have passed away, and the
names of his persecutors and murderers shall have long been lost in utter forgetfulness,
his name, ana his deeds will shine brighter than the noon-day sun, and will never be
forgotten ! He was not a vicious man, but contrariwise, in his heart and in his life
the virtues shone resplendent; yet his life was hunted and sought after, as though he
was some fearful monster, spreading devastation and destruction in his course. But he
was a prophet and an apostle, alas this was his crime, and for it he must die !
Various plans were adopted and every effort made to excite the people against our
whole society. Falsehoods of the basest kind were published in many public journals.
Organized bands of thieves would steal from the surrounding neighborhoods and charge
it upon the Saints. And finally a paper was started in Nauvoo, by persons that we had
excommunicated from our church, for committing adultery. This paper upon its first
issue, was made up of such a mass of vulgarity and indecency, that the City Council
declared it a nuisance, and ordered the Sheriff to abate it. This made a great uproar
in the neighboring towns, arid was quickly seized upon as a pretext for commencing
another persecution against the church, and particularly against Mr. Smith. Armed
mobs began to assemble at Carthage and Warsaw, and a warrant was issued for Joseph’s
apprehension ; but he secreted himself for a time, until the mob had become so ex-
cited, and had swelled to so large a number, that Nauvoo was threatened with a general
massacre unless he was delivered up. At this juncture the Governor came with troops
to Carthage, some eighteen miles distant from Nauvoo, and told Joseph that if lie
would give himself up, he “ Pledged his honor and the honor of the state, that he should
be protected, and should have a fair trial: but if he did not, the mob could not be re-
strained from marching into Nauvoo and massacreing the town.” In order to avert so
dreadful a calamity he gave himself up to die tor ins friends ! It was a solemn
day when he left Nauvoo—there was many a strong arm and willing heart that would


gladly have went with him and protected him, hut he forbade them. He took with him
only two of the Twelve, (Elders J. Taylor and W. Richards) and his brother Hyrum.
He earnestly entreated Hyrum to remain, but he replied, “Joseph, if you die let
WE DIE WITH YOU ! LET US FALL TOGETHER !”
7'he following account is extracted from the book of “ Doctrine and Covenants,”
page 444:
MARTYRDOM OF JOSEPH SMITH AND HIS BROTHER HYRUM.
1. To seal the testimony of this book and the Book cf Mormon, we close with the
martyrdom of Joseph Smith the prophet, and Hyrum Smith the patriarch. They were
shot in Carthage jail on the 27th of June, 1844, about five o’clock p.m., by an armed
mob, painted black, of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first, and fell
calmly exclaiming, “I am a dead man.” Joseph leaped from the window, and was
shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming “ O Lord my God!” They were both shot after
they were dead in a brutal manner, and both received four balls.
2. John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only persons in
the room at the time : the former was wounded in a savage manner with four balls, but
has since recovered : the latter, through the promises of God, escaped “ without even
a hole in his robe.”
3. Joseph Smith, the prophet and seer of the Lord, has done more, (save Jesus
only,) for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it.
In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which
he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on
two continents: h s sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel which it contained, to
the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments
which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents
and instructions for the benefit of the children of men : gathered many thousands of
the Latter Day Saints: founded a great city; and left a fame and name that cannot be
slain. He li.'ed great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people, and like
most of the Lord’s anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and works with
his own blood —and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in
death they were not separated !
4. When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended require-
ments of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said —“ lam going
like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer’s morning; I have a con-
science void of offence, towards God, and towards all men—l shall die innocent,
AND IT SHALL YET BE SAID OF ME, HE WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD.” The
same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go—shall it be said to the slaughter ?
Yes, for so it was—he read the following paragraph near the close of the fifth chapter
of Ether, in the Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it;
5 “And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the
Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the Lord said
unto me, if they have not charity, it mattereth not unto you, thou hast been faithful;
wherefore thy garments are clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou
shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in
the mansions of my Father. And now I bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea,
and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment seat
of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.”
The testators are now dead and their testament is in force.
G Hyrum Smith was 44 years old last February, and Joseph Smith was 38 last
December; and hence forward their names will be classed among the martyrs of reli-
gion : and the reader in every nation will be reminded, that the “ Book of Mormon ”
and this Book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nine-
teenth century, to bring it forth for the salvation of a ruined world. And that if the
fire can scath a green tree for the glory of God, how easily it will burn up the “dry
trees” to purify the vineyard of corruption. They lived for glory ; they died for glory ;
and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down to pos-
terity as gems for the sanctified. *
7 They were innocent of any crimes, as they had often been proved before, and were
only confined in jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men ; and their innocent
blood on the floor of Carthage jail, is a broad seal affixed to Mormonism, that cannot


be rejected by any court on earth ; and their innocent blood on the escutcheon of (he
State of Illinois, with the broken faith of the state as expressed by the Governor, is a
witness to the truth of the everlasting gospel, that all the world cannot impeach ; and
their innocent blood on the banner of liberty, and on the magna charta of the United
States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of
honest men among all nations; and their innocent blood, with the innocent blood of all
the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts, till he
avenges that blood upon the earth : Amen.
The following extract is taken from a pamphlet published by a Mr. W. M. Daniels
who was an eye witness of the bloody scene, and who at that time was not a mem-
ber of our society ; it reads thus; —“When I had travelled nearly eight miles I inquired
my way, and, through accident or design, I was placed upon a road that led me directly
back to Warsaw. My mind was composed and tranquil as 1 came in sight of the place.
My attention was attracted by a group of men, apparently in earnest conversation. I
drew near and learned that the Carthage Greys had made them the proposition to come
to Carthage, on the following day, and assist them in murdering Joseph and Hyrum
Smith, during the absence ofthe Governor, to Golden’s Point, where he contemplated
marching with the troops. As soon as they discovered that I had heard the purpose of
their conference, they became suspicious of me, fearing exposure, no doubt, and put me
under guard. I was held in custody until the following day, when a company of volunteers
was raised, to march to Golden’s Point, to unite with the Governor. I desired to make
the Governor acquainted with what was contemplated against the lives of the prisoners.
To effect this object, I volunteered, and drew a musket. The company was paraded in
single file; roll was called and Capt. Jacob Davis, (the murderer, who was screened
justice by the late Senate of Illinois,) and Capt. Grover, selected ten men each
from their respective companies, who were to march to Carthage, in compliance with
the request ofthe Carthage Greys, to co-operate with them in committing themrlrder.—
These twenty men were marched a short distance tooneside, where they received their in-
structions from Col. Williams, Mark Aldrich, Cap. Jacob Davis, and Cap. Grover, and
they were sent off. I do not recollect the names of any of these twenty, with the
exception of two brothers—coopers, in Warsaw, by the name of Stevens. One of them
is about six feet three inches high, well proportioned and athletic. The other is near
live feet nine inches high, dark complexion and dark hair. When the officers were
interrogated as to the object of these twenty men being sent in advance of the troops,
they evaded the truth by replying that they had been detailed for a picket guard.
The troons were marched. We arrived at the crossing of the Rail Road at 12 o’clock.
We were there met by Sharp, and others, bearing despatches from the Governor, dis-
banding the troops. This unexpected order threw the troops into a perfect panic.
They cursed the Governor for not permitting them to march through to Nauvoo.
Their object in wishing to go—and this was understood with all the militia—was to
burn the city and exterminate the inhabitants. These designs were baffled by the dis-
banding of the troops Injustice to the character of Governor Ford, I would remark
that his object in disbanding the troops, was to prevent such an awful calamity. The
disbanding orders were read by Col. Levi Williams. Captains Davis, Grover and
Elliott, immediately called their companies together.
Thomas C. Sharp mounted his ‘big bay horse,’ and made an inflammatory speech to
the companies, characteristic of his corrupt heart. The following is a short extract, as
near as my memory will serve me :
“Friends and Fellow-Citizens The crisis has arrived when it becomes our
duty to rise, as freemen, and assert our rights. The law is insufficient for us; —the
Governor will not enforce it; —we must take it into our own hands ; we know what wrongs
we suffer, and we are the best calculated to redress them. Now is the time to pul a
period to the mad career of the Prophet ;—sustained as he is by a band of fanatical
military saints ! We have bore his usurpations until it would be cowardice to bear
them longer ! My Fellow Citizens; improve the opportunity that now oilers; lestthe oppor-
tunity pa°ss, and the despotic Prophet will never again be in your power. All things
are understood, we must hasten to Carthage and murder the Smiths while the Governor
is absent at Nauvoo. Beard the Lions in their den. The news will reach Nauvoo
before the Governor leaves. This will so enrage the Mormons, that they will fall upon
and murder Tom Ford, and we shall then be rid of the d d little Governor and


the Mormons loo.”-(Cheers.) This speech was likely to fail of having the desired
effect. None seemed willing to be the first to start: at last Capt. Grove® started, and
declared he would go alone, if no person would follow him. Soon one person followed
then another and another, until a company of eighty-four was made up. All the troops
that had not volunteered in this company were told to go home. The twenty men who
had been sent forward to commit the murder, were sent for and they formed a part of
the eighty-four. 1
Here I felt that the purpose for which I volunteered had been baffled. I expected to
have met with the Governor at Golden’s point, which could I have done, I entertained
no doubt, but 1 would have succeeded in putting a stop to the murder. But instead of
marching to Golden’s point as we anticipated, he marched to Nauvoo. Under these
circumstances I was at a loss to know what to do. I had not time to go to Nauvoo, and
laise a posse to surround the jail as a guard, before this company would arrive there I
was on foot, and would have had 10 or 12 miles farther to travel then they. As I could
not do anything better, I was determined to follow on with the companies, and see what
they would do. Several others, like myself, followed out of curiosity, without being
armed. Carthage lay directly on my route home. After we had arrived within nearly
b miles of Carthage, they made a partial halt. Col. Williams rode three or four times
backwards and forwards from the company to the Carthage Greys. He said he would
have the Carthage Greys come and meet them. They marched within four miles of
Carthage, when they were met by one of the Greys, bringing a note to the following
import.—“ Now is a delightful time to murder the Smiths. The Governor has gone to
Nauvoo with all the troops. The Carthage Greys are left to guard the prisoners. Five
of our men will be stationed at the jail; the rest will be upon the public square. To
keep up appearances, you will attack the men at the jail-a sham scuffle will ensue—
their guns will be loaded with blank cartridges—they will fire in the air.”
(Signed,) Carthage Greys.
r I hey were also instructed by the person, bearing this despatch, to fire three guns as
they advanced along the fence that leads from the woods to the jail. This was to serve
as a signal to the Carthage Greys, that they were in readiness. At this both parties
■were to rush to the jail, and the party that reached it first was to perform the deed.
After they had received their instructions, the company followed along up the hollow
that struck into the point of timber. Soon the mob made their appearance. They
advanced in single file along the fence, as they had been instructed. When they had
gained about half the distan'ce of the fence, the signal guns were fired. Both parties
made a simultaneous rush, and soon the jail was surrounded by the mob. They had
blacked themselves with wet powder, while they were in the woods, which gave them
the horrible appearance of demons. The most of them had on blue hunting-shirts, with
fringe around the edges. Col. Williams shouted out, ‘‘rush in!— there is no danger
boys—all is right!” A rush was made in the door at the south part of the building.
This let them into a hall, or entry, from which they ascended a flight of stairs, at the
head of which, turning to the right, they reached the door that lead into the prisoners’
room.
Hyrum stood near the centre of the room, in front of the door. The mob fired two
balls through the pannel of the door, one of which entered Hyrum Smith’s head, at the
left side of his nose. He fell upon his back, with his head one or two feet from the
north east corner of the room, exclaiming, as he fell, “f am a dead man !” In all, four
balls entered his body. One ball, (it must have been fired through the window, from
the outside,) passed through his body with such force—entering his back—that it com-
pletely broke to pieces a watch which he wore in his vest pocket. A shower of balls
were poured through all parts of the room, many of which lodged in the ceiling just
above the head of the fallen man. Elder Taylor took a position beside the door, with
Eider Richards a little at his right, and parried of their muskets with a walking stick,
as they were firing. He continued parrying their guns, until they had got them about
half the length into the room, when he found resistance vain and attempted to jump out
of the window, and a ball from within struck him on the left thigh;— hitting the bone it
passed through to within half an inch of the other Side. He fell on to the window-sill
and expected he would fall out, when a ball from without struck his watch, which he
carried in his vest pocket, which threw him back into the room. He was hit by two
more balls; one injuring his left wrist considerably, and the other entering at the side of


the bone, just below the left knee. He fell info the room, and rolled under a bed that
set at the right of the window, in the south east corner of the room. While under the
bed, he was fired at several times, and was struck by one ball which tore the flesh off
his left hip in a shocking manner, throwing large quantities of blood upon the wall and
floor. These wounds proved very severe and painful, but he suffered without a mur-
mur, rejoicing that he had the satisfaction to mingle his blood with that of the
prophets, and be with them in the last moments of their earthly existence. His blood,
with theirs, can cry to heaven for vengeance on those who have shed the blood of inno-
cence and slain the servants of the Living God in all ages of the world. This seemed a
source of high gratification, and he endured his severe sufferings without a single com-
plaint, being perfectly resigned to the will of God. Elder Richards was contending with
the assailants, af the door, when Joseph, seeing there was no safety in the room, and
probably thinking it might save the lives of the others if he could escape from the room,
turned calmly from the door, dropped his pistol upon the floor, saying, “There, defend
yourselves as well as you can.” He sprung into the window; but just as he was pre-
paring to descend, he saw such an array of bayonets below, that he caught by the win-
dow casing, where he hung by his hands and feet, with his head to the north, feet to
the south, and his body swinging downwards. He hung in that position three or four
minutes, during which time he exclaimed, two or three times, ‘0 Lord, my God ! ! !’'
and fell to the ground. While he was hangingin that situation, Col. Williams hallooed,
“shoot him! God d nhim! shoot the d d rascal !” However, none fired at
him. He seemed to fall easy. He struck partly on his right shoulder and back, his
neck and head reaching the ground a little before his feet. He rolled instantly on his
face. From this position he was taken by a young man, who sprung to him from the
other side of the fence, who held a pewter fife in his hand, —was bare-foot and bare-
headed, having on no coat —with his pants rolled above his knees, and shirt-sleeves above
his elbows. He set President Smith against the south side of the well-curb, that was
situated a few feet from the jail. While doing this, the savage muttered aloud, “This
is Old Jo ; I know him. I know you, Old Jo. Damn you ; yeu are the man that had
my daddy shot.” The object he had in talking in this way, I suppose to be this ; He
wished to have President Smith, and the people in general, believe he was the son of
Gov. Boggs, which would lead to the opinion that it was the Missourians who had come
over and committed the murder. This was the report that they soon caused to be cir-
culated through the country ; but this was too palpable a falsehood to be credited. '1 he
deed was too bloody for even Missouri barbarism to father ! After President Smith had
fallen, I saw elder Richards come to the window and look out upon the horrid scene
that spread itself before him. I could not help noticing the striking contrast in his and
President Smith’s 1 countenance and that of the horrid demon-like appearance of the
murderers. They were calm and tranquil, while the mob was filled with excitement
and agitation.
President Smith’s exit from the room had the tendency to cause those who were
firing into the room to abandon it and rush to the outside. This gave an opportunity
for Elder Richards to convey Elder Taylor into the cell, which he did and covered him
with a bed, thinking he might there be secure if the mob should make another rush into
the jail. While they were in the cell, some of the mob again entered the room ; but
finding it deserted by all but Hyrum Smith, they left the jail. Remarkable as the cir-
cumstance is, Elder Richards was not hit with a single ball, and it will long remain a
mystery, to the world, how he passed all the time through the thickest of the firing,
and escaped without there being made a “hole in his robe 1” When President Smith
had been set against the curb, and began to recover, Col. Williams ordered four men to
shoot him. Accordingly, four men took an easterly direction, about eight feet from the
curb, Col. Williams standing partly at their rear, and made ready to execute the order.
While they were making preparations, and the muskets were raised to their faces.
President Smith’s eyes rested upon them with a calm and quiet resignation. He
betrayed no agitated feelings and the expression upon his countenance seemed to
betoken his inly prayer to be, “O, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they
do.” The fire was simultaneous. A slight cringe of the body was all the indication of
pain that he betrayed when the balls struck him. He fell upon his lace. One ball then
entered the back part of his body. This is the ball that many people have supposed
struck him about the time he was in the window. But this is a mistake. I was close
by him, and I know he was not hit with a ball, until after he was seated by the well-
curb. His death was instant and tranquil, He betrayed no appearance 6t pain. Pis

noble veins, now congealed and blackened upon their garments, or still red and drippum
upon its mother earth, who quickly absorbed it that she might cry unto her Maker for
vengeance on the guilty hands that shed it: to behold those countenances, still smiling,
t hough cold in death, which in years gone by had beamed forth so brightly and serenely’
lailliiul indexes of the pure and generous souls within, whose effulgent rays had pene-
trated many a sorrow-laden heart, and by its hallowed influence, had cheered many a
droc'ping spirit— to reflect, how often the congregated thousands of Israel had sat under
the sound of their voices, now alas how silent! yet still, even in death, seeming to say,
‘ Onward ! brethren, onward ! you shall conquer though you die !” To reflect on the
many hours rendered sacred to our memory by the rich instruction which fell from those
bps, now O how pale ! To remember the many trying scenes in which we would have
tainted, had they not cheered us by their presence, strengthened us by their wise coun-
sels, and encouraged us by their example. To remember how many qualities of head
and heart (hey possessed that were so well calculated to endear them to us—these and a
thousand other reflections that crowded in upon our bursting hearts, as we gazed upon
their murdered corses, was more than we could well endure—in the agony of our souls
we wept!. But we were not a people to sit mourning as those without hope; but
having paid those last honors due to departed loved-ones, we set about finishing the
House of the Lord ; for in that building the Lord had promised to endow us with the
fulness of the priesthood, by which we could go into all the world, and raise the
standard of truth to the most distant nations, and warn them of the calamities that
will shortly come upon the earth, unless they repent, and obey the gospel.
the mob had now, by the murder of our prophet and patriarch, drawn the dividing
line between them and us, and fearing that the brethren would bring them to justice
they fully determined upon our expulsion or extermination. To accomplish this object
a wolf-hunt was projected. The mob was to collect at certain points under the pre-
tence of wolf-hunting, and on the 27th of September they were to concentrate their forces
and march against Nauvoo; but the Governor being warned of what was going on,
collected a body of troops from distant parts of the state, and marching in person with
them to Hancock dispersed them and frustrated their murderous designs. After this,
things went on calmly for a time, but the mob looked with a jealous eye upon the
Temple which we were building. This was an immense structure, the architecture of
which was exceedingly grand and beautiful. It was built of while marble. The mob
feared that if we completed that “House” they could never succeed in driving us
from it, but that like the ancient Israel we would defend it to the last. Therefore they


fnade a desperate effort to raise a sufficient force to drive us out of the state forthwith,
Boon Warsaw and Carthage were filled with raobbers, and they soon commenced driving
in our brethren from the most exposed settlements, burning their houses, stacks of
wheat &c., and driving of their stock.
The Sheriff of Hancock fearing the re-enacting of murderous scenes, and knowing
that no confidence could be placed in the old citizens to disperse the mob, came to
Nauvoo and called out the Nauvoo Legion, which at that time numbered over five
thousand men, and marched them as a posse committatus to Carthage and Warsaw, and
dispersed the mob.
However, the excitement still continued ; and as it was evident that it would be
impossible for the church to live in Illinois, an agreement was made with the mob,
that we would leave the state the following spring. The excitement now abated ; and
the brethren having completed the temple, assembled in it and received their endow-
ment : which endowment gives us power to preach the fulness of the gospel among all
nations, and to build up the church, or kingdom of God upon the earth, and thus pre-
pare a people to receive our Savior, when he shall come to Zion to reign a thousand
years among his Saints. Thus, having accomplished the object of building the House
of the Lord, the brethren hastened their preparations for departure, and in the winter
of 1816 commenced their removal. Most of the Church advanced into the Indian terri-
tory as far as Council Bluffs, a distance of about seven hundred miles, here, far beyond
the white settlements, surrounded by indians, they halted and put in a crop. But, O !
who can tell the sufferings they endured that long and dreary season, many sunk under
the fearful trial.
In the following September, the great body of the church having left Illinois, and the
remnantdeft behind being those who were too poor to remove, the mob -which at that
time numbered over 1600 men, with a park of artillery, marched against Nauvoo, for
the purpose of massacreing or driving the few Saints remaining there. They had
about 200 baggage wagons, with sectarian ministers to preach and orators to inspire
the rabble with the old idea, “that they were doing God service.” Thomas S. Brockman,
the commander of this mob, is a Campbellite preacher. On the 10th of September
they encamped near Nauvoo. On the next day they commenced their attack upon
the city, throwing cannon-balls and grape-shot in showers, but were stopped by our
domestic cannon which was made out of an old steamboat shaft. The next day they
commenced an action which lasted one hour and twenty minutes, when they were
repulsed, which seems a miracle when we consider that about one hundred and fifty
men stood against eight hundred of the mob. Two of the saints (William Anderson
and son) were killed. The mob confess one killed and twelve wounded. Hostilities
now ceased, and a treaty was entered into in which it was stipulated that, “ The city of
Nauvoo will surrender—the Nauvoo arms to be delivered up—the Quincy committee
to use their influence\ to protect persons and property from violence—the Saints to
leave the state, and disperse as soon as they cross the river.” This treaty, however
was not regarded by the mob, and the afflicted remnant of the Saints were ruthlessly
driven across the river at the point of the sword.

CHAPTER XII.
A few years ago, (said Colonel Kane), ascending the Upper Mississippi, in the
autumn when its waters were low, I was compelled to travel by land past the region of
the Rapids. My road lay through the Half-Breed Tract, a fine section of lowa, which
the unsettled state of its land-titles had appropriated as a sanctuary for coiners, horse
thieves, and other outlaws. * * * * * *
I was descending the last hill-side upon my journey, when a landscape in delightful
contrast broke upon my view. Half encircled by a bend of the river, a beautiful city
lay glittering in the fresh morning sun; its bright new dwellings, set in cool green gar-
dens, ranging up around a stately dome-shaped hill, which was crowned by a noble
marble edifice, whose high tapering spire was radiant with white and gold, lire city
appeared to cover several miles; and beyond it, in the background, there rolled off a
fair country, chequered by the careful lines of fruitful husbandry, ihe unmistakeablc.


marks of industry, enterprise, and educated wealth everywhere, made the scene one of
singular and most striking beauty.
It was a natural impulse to visit this inviting region. I procured a skiff, and rowing
across the river, landed at the chief wharf of the city. No one met me there. I looked,
and saw no one. I could hear no one move; though the quiet everywhere was such
that I heard the fires buzz, and the water-ripples break against the shallow of the
beach. I walked through the solitary streets. The town lay as in a dream, under
some deadening spell of loneliness, from which I almost feared to wake it; for plainly
it had not slept long. There was no grass growing up in the paved way; rains had
not yet entirely washed away the prints of dusty footsteps.
Yet I went about unchecked. I went into empty workshops, rope-walks, and
smithies. The spinner’s wheel was idle ; the carpenter had gone from his work-bench
and shavings, his unfinished sash and casing. Fresh bark was in the tanner’s vat, and
the fresh-chopped lightwood stood piled against the baker’s oven. The blacksmith’s
shop was cold ; but his coal heap, and lading pool, and crooked water horn, were ail
there, as it he had just gone off for a holiday. No work-people anywhere looked to
know my err md. If I went into the gardens, clinking the wicket-latch loudly after me,
to puli the marygolds, heart’s ease, and lady-slippers, and draw a drink with the water-
sodden well-bucket and its noisy chain ; or, knocking off with my stick the tall heavy-
headed dahlias and sunflowers, hunted over the bed for cucumbers and love-apples—
no one called out to me from any opened window, or dog sprung forward to bark an
alarm. I could have supposed the people hidden in the houses, but the doors were
unfastened; and when at last I timidly entered them, I found dead ashes wdiite upon
the hearths, and had to tread a-tiptoe, as if walking down the aisle of a country church,
to avoid rousing irreverent echoes from the naked floors.
On the outskirts of the town was the city graveyard; but there was no record of
plague there, nor did it in anywise differ much from Protestant American cemeteries.
Some ot the mounds were not long sodded ; some of the stones were newly set, their
dates recent, and their black inscriptions glossy in the mason’s hardly dried lettering
ink. Beyond the graveyard, out in the fields, I saw, in one spot hard by where the
fruited boughs of a young orchard had been roughly torn down, the still mouldering
remains of a barbecue fire, that had been constructed of rails from the fencing round it.
It was the latest sign oflife there. Fields upon fields of heavy-headed yellow grain lay
rotting ungathered upon the ground. No one was at hand to take in their rich harvest.
As far as the eye could reach, they stretched away—they sleeping too in the hazy air
of autumn.
Only two portions of the city seemed to suggest the import of this mysterious solitude.
On the southern suburb, the houses looking out upon the country showed, by their
splintered wood-work, and walls battered to the foundation, that they had lately been
the mark of a destructive cannonade. And in and around the splendid Temple, which
had been the chief object of my admiration, nrmed men were barracked, surrounded
by their stacks of musketry and pieces of heavy ordnance. These challenged me to
render an account of myself, and why I had had the temerity to cross the water with-
out a written permit from a leader of their band.
Though these men were generally more or less under the influence of ardent spirits,
after I had explained myself as a passing stranger, they seemed anxious to gain my
good opinion. They told me the story of the dead city : that it had been a notable
manufacturing and commercial marl, sheltering over 20,000 persons; that they had
waged war with its inhabitants for several years, and had been finally successful only a
few days before my visit, in an action fought in front of the ruined suburb ; after which
they had driven them forth at the point of the sword. The defence, they said, had
been obstinate, but gave way on the third day’s bombardment. They boasted greatly
of their prowess, especially in the battle, as they called it; but I discovered they were
not of one mind as to certain of the exploits that had distinguished it ; one of which,
as I remember, was, that they had slain a father and his son, a boy of fifteen, not long
residents of the fatal city, whom they admitted to have borne a character without
reproach.
They also conducted me inside the massive sculptured walls of the curious Temple,
in which (hey said the banished inhabitants were accustomed to celebrate the mystic
rites of an unhallowed worship. They particularly pointed out to me certain features
of the building, which, having been the peculiar objects of a former superstitious regard,
they had, as matter of duly, sedulously defiled and defaced. The reputed sites of cer-


tain shrines they had thus particularly noticed; and various sheltered chambers, in one
■of which was a deep well, constructed, they believed, with a dreadful design. Beside
these, they led me to see a large and deep chiselled marble vase or basin, supported
upon twelve oxen, also of marble, and of the size of life, of which they told some
romantic stories. They said the deluded persons, most of whom were emigrants from
a great distance, believed their Deity countenanced their reception here of a baptism of
regeneration, as proxies for whomsoever they held in warm affection in the countries
from which they had come. That here parents ‘went into the water’ for their lost
children, children for their parents, widows for their spouses, and young persons for
their lovers; that thus the Great Vase came to be for them associated with all dear and
distant memories, and was therefore the object, of all others in the building, to which
they attached the greatest degree of idolatrous affection. On this account, the victors
had so diligently desecrated it, as to render the apartment in which it was contained too
noisome to abide in.
They permitted me also to ascend into the steeple, to see where it had been lightning-
struck on the Sabbath before; and to look out, east and south, on wasted farms like
those I had seen near the city, extending till they were lost in the distance. Here, in
the face of the pure day, close to the sear of the Divine wrath left by the thunderbolt,
were fragments of food, cruises of liquor, and broken drinking vessels, with a brass
drum and a steam-boat signal bell, of which I afterwards learnt the use with pain.
It was after nightfall, when I was ready to cross the river on my return. The wind
had freshened since the sunset, and the water beating roughly into my little boat, I
headed higher up the stream than the point I had left in the morning, and landed where
a faint glimmering light invited me to steer.
Here, among the dock and rushes, sheltered only by the darkness, without roof
between them and the sky, I came upon a crowd of several hundred human creatures,
whom my movements roused from uneasy slumber upon the ground.
Passing these on my way to the light, I found it came from a tallow candle in a
paper funnel shade, such as is used by street vendors of apples and pea-nuts, and
which, flaming and guttering away in the bleak air off the water, shone flickeringly on
the emaciated features of a man in the last stage of a bilious remittent fever. They had
done their best for him. Over his head was something like a tent, made of a sheet or
two, and he rested on a but partially ripped open old straw mattrass, with a hair sofa
cushion under his head for a pillow. His gaping jaw and gazing eye told how short a
time he would monopolize these luxuries; though a seemingly bewildered and excited
person, who might have been his wife, seemed to find hope in occasionally forcing him
to swallow awkwardly, sips of the tepid river water, from a burned and battered bitter-
smelling tin coffee-pot. Those who knew better had furnished the apothecary he
needed ; a toothless old bald-head, whose manner had the repulsive dullness of a man
familiar with death scenes. He, so long as I remained, mumbled in his patient’s ear a
monotonous and melancholy prayer, between the pauses of which I heard the hiccup
and sobbing of two little girls, who were sitting upon a piece of drift-wmod outside.
Dreadful, indeed, was the suffering of these forsaken beings ; bowed and cramped by
cold and sunburnt, alternating as each weary day and night dragged on, they -were,
almost all of them, the crippled victims of disease. They were there because they had
no homes, nor hospital, nor poor-house, nor friends to offer them any. They could not
satisfy the feeble cravings of their sick : they had not bread to quiet the fractious hun-
ger-cries of their children. Mothers and babes, daughters and grand-parents, all of
them alike, were bivouacked in tatters, wanting even covering to comfort those whom
the sick shiver of fever was searching to the marrow.
These were Mormons, in Lee county, lowa, in the fourth week of the month of Sep-
tember, in the year of our Lord 1846. The city—it was Nauvoo, Illinois. The Mor-
mons were the owners of that city, and the smiling coirntry around. And those who
had stopped their ploughs, who had silenced their hammers, their axes, their shuttles,
and their workshop wheels : those who had put out their fires, who had eaten their food,
spoiled their orchards, and trampled unter foot their thousands of acres of unharvested
bread ; these were the keepers of their dwellings, the carousers in their temple, whose
drunken riot insulted the ears of the dying.
I think it was as I turned from the wretched nightwatch of which I have spoken,
that I first listened to the sounds of revelry of a party of the guard within the city.
Above the distant hum of the voices of many, occasionally rose distinct the loud oath-
tainted exclamation, and the falsely intonation scrap of vulgar song: but lest this


requiem should go unheeded, every now and then, when their boisterous orgies strove
to attain a sort of estatic climax, a cruel spirit of insulting frolic carried some of them
up mto the high belfry of the Temple steeple, and there, with the wicked childishness
ot inebriates, they whooped, and shrieked, and beat the drum that I had seen and rang
in chanvanc unison their loud-tongued steam-boat bell.
There were, all told, not more than six hundred and forty persons who were thus
ymg on the river flats, But the Mormons in Nauvoo and its dependencies bad b Q en
numbered the year before at over twenty thousand. Where were they ? They had
last been seen, carrying in mournful train their sick and wounded, halt and blind to
disappear behind the western horizon, pursuing the phantom of another home.
Hardly anything else was known of them : and people asked with curiosity, ‘What had
been their fate—what their fortunes?’
Since the expulsion of the Mormons to the present date, I have been intimately con-
versant with the details of their history. But I shall invite your attention most particu-
Jarly to an account of what happened to them during their first year in the wilderness •
because at this lime more than any other, being lost to public view, they were the sub-
jects of fable and misconception. Happily it was during this period I myself moved
with them ; and earned, at dear price, as some among you are aware, my right to speak
with authority of them and their character, their trials, achievements, and intentions.
The party encountered by me at the river shore were the last of the Mormons tliat
left the city. They had all of them engaged, the year before, that they would vacate
their homes, and seek some other place of refuge. It had been the condition of a truce
between them and their assailants ; and as an earnest of their good faith, the chief elders
and some others of obnoxious standing, with their families, were to set out for the
West in the spring of 1846. It had been stipulated in return, that the rest of the Mor-
mons might remain behind in the peaceful enjoyment of the Illinois abode, until their
leaders, with their exploring party, could, with all diligence, select for them a new
place of settlement beyond the Rocky Mountains, in California, or elsewhere, and
until they had opportunity to dispose, to the best advantage, of the property which they
were then to leave. J
Some renewed symptoms of hostile feeling had, however, determined the pioneer
party to begin their work before the spring, it was, of course, anticipated that this
would be a perilous service; but it was regarded as a matter of self-denying duty.
The ardour and emulation of many, particularly the devout and the young, were stim-
ulated by the difficulties it involved ; and the ranks of the party were therefore filled
up with volunteers from among the most effective and responsible members of the sect.
They began their march in mid-winter; and by the beginning of February, nearly all of
them were on the road, many of the waggons having crossed the Mississippi on the
ice.
Under the most favoring circumstances, an expedition of this sort, undertaken at
such a season of the year, could scarecely fail to be disastrous. But the pioneer com-
pany had set out in haste, and were very imperfectly supplied with necessaries. The
cold was intense. They moved in the teeth of keen-headed north-west winds, such as
sweep down the lowa Peninsula from the ice-bound regions of the timber-shaded
Slave Lake and Lake of the Woods; on the Bald Prairie there, nothing above the
dead grass breaks their free course over the hard rolled hills. Even along the scat-
tered water-courses, where they broke the thick ice to give their cattle drink, the
annual autumn fires had left little wood of value. The party, therefore, often wanted
for good camp fires, the first luxury of all travellers; but, to men insufficiently furnished
with tents and other articles of shelter, almost an essential to life. After days of
fatigue, their nights were often past in restless efforts to save themselves from freezing.
Their stock of food, also, proved inadequate; and as their systems became impover-
ished, their suffering from cold increased.
Sickened with catarrhal affections, manacled by the fetters of dreadfully acute rheu-
matisms, some contrived for a while to get over the shortening day’s march, and drag
along some others. But the sign of an impaired circulation soon began to show itself
in the liability of all to be dreadfully frost-bitten. The hardiest and strongest became
helplessly crippled. About the same time, the strength of their beasts of draught began
to fail. 'The small supply of provender they could carry with them had given out.
The winter-bleached prairie straw proved devoid of nourishment; and they could only
keep them from starving by seeking for the browse, as it is called, a green bark, and


tender buds, and branches of the cotton-wood, and oilier stinted growths of the
hollows.
To return to Nauvoo was apparently the only escape ; but this would have been to
give occasion for fresh mistrust, and so to bring new trouble to those they had left there
behind them. They resolved at least to hold their ground, and to advance as they
might, were it only by limping through the deep snows a few slow miles a day. They
found a sort of comfort in comparing themselves to the exiles of Siberia, and sought
cheerfulness in earnest prayers for the spring—longed for as morning by the tossing
sick.
The spring came at last. It overtook them in the Sac and Fox country, still on the
naked prairie, not yet half way over the trail they were following between the Missis-
sippi and Missouri rivers. But it brought its own share of troubles with it. The
months with which it opened proved nearly as trying as the worst of winter.
The snow and sleet and rain which fell, as it appeared to them without intermission,
made the road over the rich prairie soil as impassable as one large bog of heavy black
mud. Sometimes they would fasten the horses and oxen of four or five waggons to one.
and attem.pt to get a-head in this way, taking turns; but at the close of a day of hard
toil for themselves and their cattle, they would find themselves a quarter or half a mile
from the place they left in the morning. The heavy rains raised all the water-courses :
the most trifling streams were impassable. Wood fit for bridging was often not to be
had, and in such cases the only resource was to halt for the freshets to subside —a mat-
ter in the case of the headwaters of the Chariton, for instance, of over three weeks’
delay.
These were dreary waitings upon Providence. The most spirited and sturdy mur-
mured most at their forced inactivity. And even the women, whose heroic spirits had
been proof against the lowest thermometric fall, confessed their tempers fluctuated with
the ceaseless variations of the barometer. They complained, too, that the health of
their children suffered more. It was the fact, that the open winds of March and April
brought with them more mortal sickness than the sharpest freezing weather.
The frequent burials made the hardiest sicken. On the soldier’s march it is matter
of discipline, that after the rattle of musketry over his comrade’s grave, he shall tramp
it to the music of some careless tune in a lively quick-step. But, in the Mormon camp
the companion who lay ill and gave up the ghost within view of all, all saw as he
lay a corpse, and all attended to his last resting-place. It was a sorrow, too, of itself
to simple hearted people, the deficient pomps of their imperfect style of funeral. The
general hopefulness of human—including Mormon —nature, was well illustrated by the
fact, that the most provident were found unfurnished with undertaker’s articles; so
that* bereaved affection was driven to the most melancholy make-shifts.
The best expedient generally was to cut down a log of some eight or nine feet long,
and slitting it longitudinally, strip off its dark bark in two halt cylinders. These,
placed around the body of the deceased and bound firmly together with withes made of tire
alburnum, formed a rough sort of tubular coffin which surviving relations and friends,
with a little show of black crape, could follow with its enclosure to the hole, or bit of
ditch, dug to receive it in the wet ground of the prairie. They grieved to lower it down
so poorly clad, and in such an unheeded grave. It was hard—was it right, thus hur-
riedly to plunge it in one of the undistinguishable waves of the great land-sea, and
leave it behind them there, under the cold north rain, abandoned to be forgotten ?
They had no tomb-stones; nor could they find rocks to pile the monumental cairn.
So, when they had filled up the grave, and over it prayed a miserere prayer, and tried
to sing a hopeful psalm, their last office was to seek out landmarks, or call in the sur-
veyor to enable them to determine the bearings of valley bends, head-lands, or forks
and angles of constant streams, by which its position should in the future, be remem-
bered and recognized. The name of the beloved person, his age, the date of his death,
and these marks were all registered with care. This parly was then ready to move on.
Such graves mark all the line of the first year of the Mormon travel—dispiriting mile-
stones to failing stragglers in the rear.
It is ?n error to estimate largely the number of Mormons dead of starvation, strictly
speaking. Want developed disease, and made them sink under fatigue, and maladies
that would otherwise have proved trifling. But only those died of it outright who fell
in rather out of the way places, that the hand of brotherhood could not reach. Among
the rest no such thing as plenty was known, while any went an hungered. If but a


part of a group was supplied with provision, the only result was, that the whole went on
toe half or quarter ration, according to the sufficiency that (here was among them - and

those who should follow them Two of these, in the Sac and Fox country, and beyond
t, Garden Grove and Mount Pisgah, included within their fences above two miles of
land a-piece, carefully planted in grain, with a hamlet of comfortable log-cabins in the
neighbourhood of each.
Through all this, the pioneers found redeeming comfort in the thought, that their
own suffering was the price of humanity to their friends at home. But the arrival of
spring proved this a delusion. Before the warm weather had made the earth dry enough
for easy travel, messengers came in from Nauvoo to overtake the party, with fear-exag-
gerated tales of outrage, and to urge the chief men to hurry back to the city, that they
might give counsel and assistance there. The enemy had only waited till the emigrants
were supposed to be gone on their road too far to return to interfere with them, and
then renewed their aggressions. * * * *
From this time onward the energies of those already on the road were engrossed by
the duty of providing for the fugitives who came crowding in after them. At a last gen-
eral meeting of the sect in Nauvoo, there had been passed an unanimous resolve, that
they would sustain one mother, whatever their circumstances, upon the march ; and
this, rough made in view of no such appalling exigency, they now with one accord set
themselves together to carry out.
Heie begins the touching period of Mormon history; on which, but that it is for me
a hackneyed subject, I should be glad to dwell, were it only for the proof it has afforded
ot the strictly material value to communities of an active common faith, and its happy
illustrations of the power of the spirit of Christian fraternity to relieve the deepest of
human suffering. 1 may assume that it has already fully claimed the public sympathy.
Delayed thus by their own wants, and by their exertions to provide for the wants of
others, it was not till the month of June that the advance of the emigrant companies
arrived at me Missouri. * * * * *
I hough the season was late when they first crossed the Missouri, some of them
moved forward with great hopefulness, full of the notion of viewing and choosing their
new homes that year. But the van had only reached Grand Island and the Pawnee
villages, when they were overtaken by more ill news from Nauvoo. Before the sum-
mer closed their enemies set upon the last remnant of those who were left behind in
Illinois. They were a few lingerers, who could not be persuaded but there might yet
be time for them to gather up their worldly goods before removing, some weak mothers
and their infants, a few delicate young girls, and many cripples and bereaved and sick
people. These had remained under shelter, according to the Mormon statement at
least, by virtue of an express covenant in their behalf. If there was such a covenant it
was broken. A vindictive war was waged upon them, from which the weakest fled in
scattered the rest to make a reluctant and almost ludicrously unavailing
defence till the 1 / th day of September, when one thousand six hundred and twenty-five
troops entered Nauvoo, and drove ail forth who had not retreated before that time.
Like the wounded birds of a flock, fired into towards nightfall, they came straggling
with faltering steps, many of them without bag or baggage, beast or barrow, all asking
shelter or burial, and forcing a fresh repartition of the already divided rations of their
friends. It was plain now that every energy must be taxed to prevent the entire expe-
dition from perishing. Further emigration for the time was out of the question, and
Bie whole people prepared themselves for encountering another winter on the prairie.
This was the Head Quarters of the Mormon Camps of Israel. The miles of rich
prairie enclosed and sowed with the grain they could contrive to spare, and the houses,
stacks, and cattle shelters, had the seeming of an entire county, with its people and


improvements transplanted there unbroken. On a pretty plateau, overlooking the river,
they built more than seven hundred houses in a single town, neatly laid out with high-
ways and by-ways, and fortified with breast-work, stockade, and block-houses. It had
too, its place of worship, “ Tabernacle of the Congregation,” and various large work-
shops, and mills and factories, provided with water power.
They had no camp or settlement of equal size in the Pottowatamie country. There
was less to apprehend here from Indian invasion ; and the people scattered themselves,
therefore, along the rivers and streams, and in the timber-groves, where they found invi-
ting localities for farming operations. In this way many of them acquired what have
since proved to be valuable pre-emption rights.
Upon the Pottowatamie lands, scattered through the border regions of Missouri and
lowa, in the Sauk and Fox country, a few among the loways, among the Poncahs in a
great company upon the banks of the L’Eau qui Coule, or Running Water River, and
at the Omaha winter-quarters ; —the Mormons sustained themselves through the heavy
winter of 1846-1847. It was the severest of their trials; and if I aimed at rhetorical
effect, I would be bound to offer you a minute narrative of its progress, as a sort of cli-
max to my history. But I have, I think, given you enough of the Mormon’s sorrows.
We are all of us content to sympathize with a certain extent of suffering; but very few
can bear the recurring yet scarcely varied narrative of another’s distress without some-
thing of impatience. The world is full of griefs, and we cannot afford to extend too
large a share of our charity, or even our commiseration in a single quarter.
This winter was the turning-point of the Mormon fortunes: those who lived through
it were spared to witness the gradual return of better times; and they now liken it to
the passing away of a dreary night, since which they have watched the coming of a
steadily brightening day.
Before the grass-growth of 1847, a body of one hundred and forty-three picked men
with seventy waggons, drawn by their best horses, left the Omaha quarters under the
command of the members of the High Council who had wintered there. They carried
with them little but seed and farming implements, their aim being to plant spring crops
at their ultimate destination. They relied on their rifles to give them food, but rarely
left their road in search of game. They made long daily marches, and mpvcd with as
much rapidity as possible.
Against the season when ordinary emigration passes the Missouri, they were already
through the South Pass; and a couple of short days’ travel beyond it, entered upon the
more arduous portion of their journey. It lay, in earnest, through the Rocky Mountains.
They turned Fremont’s Peak, Long’s Peak, the Twins, and other King summits, but
had to force their way over other mountains of the rugged Utah range, sometimes fol-
lowing the stony bed of torrents, the head waters of some of the mightiest rivers of our
continent, and sometimes literally cutting their road through heavy and ragged timber.
They arrived at the grand basin of the Great Salt Lake much exhausted, but without
losing a man, and in time to plant for a partial autumn harvest.
Another party started after these pioneers, from the Omaha winter quarters, in the
summer. They had 566 waggons, and carried large quantities of grain, which they
were able to put in the ground before it froze.
The same season also, these were joined by a part of the Battalion, and other mem-
bers of the Church, who came eastward from California and the Sandwich islands.
Together, they fortified themselves strongly with sunbrick wall and blockhouses, and
living safely through the winter, were able to tend crops that yielded ample provision
for the ensuing year.
In 1848, nearly all the members of the church had left the Missouri country in a suc-
cession of powerful bands, invigorated and enriched by their abundant harvests there ;
and that year fully established their Commonwealth of the New Covenant, the future
State of Deseret. **' * * * *
The history of the Mormons has ever since been the unbroken record of the most
wonderful prosperity. It has looked as though the elements of fortune, obedient to a
law of natural re-action, were struggling to compensate to them theil undue share of
suffering. They may be pardoned for deeming it miraculous. But, in truth, the econo-
mist accounts for it all, who explains to us the speedy recuperation of cities, hid in
ruin by flood, fire, and earthquake. During its years of trial, Mormon labour has sub-
sisted on insufficient capital, and under many trials, but it has subsisted, and survives
them now, as intelligent and powerful as ever it was at Nauvoo; with this difference,


that it has in the meantime been educated to habits of unmatched thrift energy and
endurance, and has been transplanted to a situation -where it is in every ’respect more
productive. _ Moreover, during all the period of their journey, while some have gained
by practice in handicraft, and the experience of repeated essays at their various halting-
placed) the minds of all have been busy framing designs and planning the improvements
they have since found opportunity to execute.
the territory of the Mormons is unequalled as a stock-raising country The finest
pastures of Lombardy are not more estimable that those on the east side of the Utah
t kdke and Jordan River. We find here that cereal anomaly, the Bunch grass In May
when the other grasses push, this fine plant dries upon its stalk, and becomes a light'
yellow straw, full of flavor and nourishment. It continues thus, through what are the
dry months of the climate, till January, and then starts with a vigorous growth like
our oWn winter wheat in April, which keep on till the return of another May. ’whe-
ther as straw or grass, the cattle fatten on it the year round. The numerous little dells
and sheltered spots that are foilnd in the mountains are excellent sheep-walks • it is
said that the wool which is grown upon them is of an unusually fine pile and soft tex-
ttefe. Hogs fatten oh a succulent top or tuber, palled the Seacoe, or Seegose Root,
which I hope will soon bcunaturallied with us. It is high esteemed as a table vegeta-
ble by Mormons andJ|#ans, remark that they are cultivating it with interest at
the trench The emigrant poultry have taken the best care of
each other, o'rily ujjHEng liberty to provide themsejves with every other blessing.
The also been singularly happy in their Indian-relations. They have
not made mistake of supposing savages insensible to courtesy of demean-
our; but, taught by their religion' to regard them all as decayed brethren, have
always treated the silly, tyflketf souls wuh,kind-heilrted civility. Though their’outlay
for tobacco, wampum, and vermilion has%en of ihe very smallest, yet they have never
failed to purchase what g«oa%yLthey wanted,, * * *
Fiowi the first, >.loraions, Have had little or nothing to do in Deseret,
but attend to their strictly agricultural pursuits. They have made seve-
successful settlements xflHfaßUfljaest north, at what they term Brownsville, is above
forty miles ; ifeid tjus flirta called the Sanpe.cqb. two hundred miles
from that lir§t fonned; A of ifeUmnce Tiberias, or Gdnesareth empties its
waters into the Dead S«BPlseret, by a fine river, to which the Mormons
gave the name—it vfas five it any other —of the Western Jordan.
ItwasanjSie right bank ofam, at a choice spot upon a rich table land,
by a great streams falling from the highlands, that the
Pioneer band of Mormonsj|||tfing the mountains in the night, pitched their first
camp ih the Valley, ground. Curiously enough, this very spot
proved the most favourajEnhe for they? chief settlement, and after exploring the whole
country, they have fOun«;d on it their city of the New Hierusalem. Its houses are
spread to much as possible the farms,- which are laid out in
wards or cantons, wiKa common fence to each ward. The farms in wheat already
cover a space the district "of Colhmbia, over all of which they have com-
pleted the canals, dm .other arrangements, for bountiful irrigation, after the manner of
the cultivators ofahe East. The houses are distributed over an area nearly as great as
■ the City of Ne\y»c)rk. *, * * * • * *
They mean dfeek no other resting-place. After pitching camps enough to exhaust
many limes ojm the chapter of names in 33rd Numbers, they have at last come to their
Promised L ML, and, “behold, it is a good land and large, flowing with milk and
honeyaiJfh’ere again for them, as at Nauvoo, the forge siMkes and the anvil rings,
and whirring wheels go round. Again has returned the ntftk sport of childhood, and
the evenir#qdiet ofhtd age, and again dear house-pet bloom in garden plots
round homes. ”
We are also preparing to build a HOUSE unto the name of the Lord our God, on a
larger and grander scale than the one at Nauvoo. We are also sending the Elders
abroad among the nations to preach the gospel, who are calling on the people iorepent and be
baptized , iri rhe name of Jesus, for the remission of sins, and to gather “to the place of
the name of the Lord of Hosts, The Mount Zion,” in order that they may escape the
calamities that await the nations, and be prepared to receive ihe Sou of man, for ins
cToming is nigh at hand.
