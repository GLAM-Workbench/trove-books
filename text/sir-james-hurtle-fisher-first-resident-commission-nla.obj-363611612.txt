Sir JAMES HURTLE FISHER
First Resident Commissioner in S.A.
HIS LIFE and TIMES
Early History of the State by his Great Grandson
Geo. C. Morphett


PREFACE
In attempting to portray the "Life and Times" of my Great
Grandfather —Sir James Hurtle Fisher —First Resident Com-
missioner in South Australia —I have thought it fitter to rely
on the records available in the S.A. Archives, rather than
write an account from my own hearsay.
The result, though somewhat disjointed, has the advan-
tage of being from the records of contemporary actors and
onlookers. Further, being in chronological sequence, it
presents a clear picture of the controversies confronting the
early settlement of South Australia.
