FOREWORD.
This Note Book and Diary for 1919 is issued to
members of the A.1.F., as a gift from the Australian
Comforts Fund.
This Fund was established to distribute the gifts
provided by the Australian public through the
various State organisations. In the early days of
the war the Australian public determined that those
who remained should also serve, and endeavour
by means of Comforts to relieve, as far as possible,
the privations inseparable from active service, and
to maintain in close association with those Sons,
Husbands and Fathers who'answered the call to
patriotism.
In this fifth year we find no falling off in the
stream of comforts that carry the atmosphere of
Australia to wherever her Sons are fighting,
bearing a message of love and grateful thanks.
Attention is drawn to the Australian section at
the back of the Diary; it is hoped that the
information given will prove interesting and useful.
The six pointed star adopted by the Australian
Comforts Fund as their emblem represents the six
States comprising the Australian Commonwealth,
vis.: Queensland, New South IVales, Victoria ,
South Australia , Western Australia , Tasmania.

What the Bugle Says.
How many readers of this Diary can tell what the
blare of the bugle conveys every time its shrill notes
ring out in barracks, camp, or when on trek ? I venture
to say very few.
I have been in six regiments and have met few men
who knew all the calls or their meaning.
Many “ poets ” have been at work on the subject.
In the future some gifted devotee of the muse may
compose really good verses appropriate to the occasion.
Until then we must use those composed by the
trumpeters and buglers of the Army.
Perhaps the “Cookhouse’' is the first call to be
picked up. It sends out its invitation to
“ Come to the Cookhouse door, boj's ;
Come to the Cookhouse door.”
Next } r ou grasp the disturbing significance of
“ Revielle ” with its imperative
“ Get out of bed, get out of bed, you lazy devils ;
Get out of bed. get out of lazy devils ,
Get out and get on parade.”
Important parades are “ warned ” by a lengthened
call in which the bugle impresses all and sundry with
the requirements of the occasion. Here is what it
blares forth :
“ Warning for parade- there’s half-an-hour to go
To get good trim ; ,
Half an hour before the bugle sounds ‘ Fall in ;
Although there’s a lot to be done.
Shave, wash, and clean the old gun
Everything’s done at the run.
Listen ! hark ! it’s the same old remark.
That was heard in the ark.
Half-an-hour, half-an-hour, warning for parade.”
Five minutes before the “Fall in,” the “Gee” or
single blast is heard. Then comes the command—
“ Fall in A, fall in B,
Fall in all the Compan—ee.”


There is a touch of sympathy for the defaulters, who,
when off duty, are obliged to report themselves at the
guard room with monotonous regularity; lor they are
told that
“ You may be a defaulter as long as you like
So long as you answer your name.”
The fire alarm is, naturally, sharp and emphatic,
viz.:—
“ Fire, fire, fire ; fire, fire, fire ; fire, fire, fire.
Double up, double up, and get on parade.”
In announcing “ fatigues,” it may assumed tnat
the bugle’s prophetic vision is weak, for it says ;
“ I called him, I called him ;
He wouldn’t come.
I called him ; the beggar wouldn’t come.”
The parade for guard is announced thus :
“ Come and do a dut} r , bo} r s ; come and do a guard.
It isn’t very easy, nor it isn’t very hard.”
Pioneers keep the barracks or camp tidy and in good
repair. They are summoned to perform some urgent
duty by the call: —
“Pioneer, pioneer, pioneer, pioneer there’s dirt
dropped on the square;
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, for no
sake don’t leave it there.”
In calling “Officers” the bugle becomes appro-
priately polite
“ Officers, come if you please ;
Officers, come if you please;
Officers, come if you please;
One, two, three.
Officers, come if you please ;
Officers, come if you please ;
Come right now.
Fa** below the standard is the “Officers’ Mess’
call: —
“ Officers’ wives get puddings and pies,
And sergeants’ wives get skilly.


The dirty old cook fell into the soup,
And made it look awfully pretty.
The dirty old cook, the dirty old cook ;
She made it look awfully pretty.”
Orderly corporals are summoned to
“ Come for orders, come for orders.
Double up, double up, and bring your books.”
If they are required to clear the mails they are
informed that there’s
“ A letter from Lively Loo, boys ;
A letter from Lively Loo.”
A general is received with the “ General Salute ” :
“ Stand to attention, you raw recruit.
And don’t make a hash of the general salute.”
Lastly, what the average soldier considers next to
“ Cookhouse ” the most cheering of all calls, it is the
“ Dismiss all Parades,” which is given an exceptionally
lively flourish in this style:—
“ There’s no more parade to-day ;
There’s no more parade to day ;
The colonel and adjutant have gone away to stay.”

Some Useful Knots.
Every soldier ought to be able to tie knots. One of
our famous generals speaking of the South African
War said that out of one thousand men which he had,
none except one company of sixty men knew how to
make knots —even bad knots.
The knots shown in our diagrams are those appearing
in the “ Manual of Field Engineering.”
The Thumb (i) and Figure of Eight (2) knots are
used to prevent the end of a rope unfraying.
The Reef Knot (9) is used to join two dry ropes of the
same thickness. It is the only knot used in First-Aid
bandaging.
The Single Sheet Bend (10) is used for joining two
dry ropes of different thicknesses and the Double Sheet
Bend (11) for wet ropes of different thicknesses.
The Hawser Bend (12) is for joining large cables.
The Clove Hitch (4 and 5) is used for the commence-
ment and finish of lashings. When fastened to a spar
and pulled tight it will neither slip up nor down.
The Timber Hitch (3) is used for catching hold of
timber to haul it. The weight of timber keeps the
hitch taut.
Two Half Hitches (13) is used for securing the loose
ends of lashings, etc.
Round Turn and two Half Hitches (14) is used for
making fast a rope so that the strain will not jamb the
hitches.
Fisherman's Bend (15) for making fast a rope when
there is a give-and-take motion.
The Lever Hitch (x 6) is used for fixing bars to drag
ropes, and the Man Harness Hitch (17) is a loop on the
drag rope being of a size to pass over a man’s shoulder.


The Knots are all shown open to clearly explain.
To finish pull taut.
Some Useful Knots.


The Bowline (6 and 7) is used for making a loop that
will not slip.
The Bowline on a Bight (8) is much stronger than
the bowline, and is usually used for lowering a person
from a height such as a window in case of fire.
The Sheepshank (19). Never cut a rope unless
absolutely necessary. To shorten a guy rope on
tent or marquee, gather the rope in the form of two
long loops and pass a half-hitch over each loop. It
remains firm under a good strain and can be easily
undone when required,
Middleman's Knot (27). Somewhat similar to the
Fisherman’s Knot, but in this case only one rope is
used. Can safely be used as a halter.
The Slip Knot (25). You sometimes want to release
a knot quickly, so this knot is used. It is simply the
reef knot with one of the ends (A) pushed through one
of the loops. To release pull end (A).
Overhand Loop Knot (18). When pulling a rope 3;ou
may wish to gain more purchase on it or you may wish
to insert a short stick to pull with. Use the loop knot
shown in our Diagram.
The Running Bowline (22). This is the nautical slip
knot. First make the loop as in the ordinary bowline
but allow a good length of end (A). Pass it round the
standing part (left hand diagram) and up through the
loop, and continue as through the ordinary bowline.
The Half-Hitch (23). Pass the end round a pole,
then round the standing part, then through below itself
again.
The Fisherman’s Knot (28). Make this knot by
tying a simple knot on rope B with the end of rope A,
then tie a similar knot on rope A with the end of rope B.
Pull the standing parts and the knots will remain fast.
Some Useful Knots— continued.


Some Useful Knots.


The Garrick Bend (20) is for joining two hawsers for
warping, hauling a ship across a dock, where the bend
may require to pass round the capstan in winding it.
The Hawser (21) is a similar method of lengthening
a warp or tow rope.
The Halliard (24) is used on many things which
hoist close up, as the head of the jib, fore-and-aft, top
sails, and lug yards.
The Cat's Paw (26) is used to secure a sling to a
crane hook and is formed on the “ bight ” of the rope.
The Rolling Hitch (29) is for making a rope fast on
a mast or spar so that it won't slip down.
IMPORTANT. Many of the knots shown on these
pages are open so that you may more easily see their
working, but when in use they should always be drawn
taut.
Control by Whistle.
Cautionary Blast. —When controlling by signal,
a short blast of the whistle will first be blown, on which
each man will look towards the Commander, who will
then make the signal.
The men will not act on the signal until he drops
his hand to the side.
Rally Blast (a succession of short blasts) means —
close on the leader at the double and face the same
direction.
Alarm Blast (a succession of alternate long and
short blasts) means —turn out and fall in.

How to Set a Map.
Place the compass over the arrow on the map, and
revolve the latter, without disturbing the compass, until
the needle and arrow coincide.
If the true North line onty is shown, place the
compass upon it, and revolve the map until this line
makes with the needle an angle equal to the variation,
and on the side opposite to it.
For instance, with a variation of 145 degrees W,, the
line on the map should be 147} degrees E. of the needle.
You can set it by objects as follows : Pick out some
distant object you can see, and find its position on the
map. Also identify your own position. Join up these
two points on the map by a straight line. Now revolve
your map about the point marking j'our position until
this line points to the distant object.
A map is said to be set when the arrow r printed on the
map and marked North coincides, or is parallel to the
magnetic needle (if the arrow is pointing magnetic
North).
To find the North by your Watch.
Take your watch and point the hour hand to the sun.
Bisect the angle between the hour hand and the figure
XII, and the point obtained will be due South. Take
for example the hour of 10. The point between X and
XII is XI, which is due South, and V will be due North.
Every Watch a Compass.
The hands of a clock or a watch cut off exactly the
same number of minutes or quarters, no matter how
large or how small the face, or long or short the hands.
So no matter how r long the sides of an angle the
number of degrees that it would cut off from the cir-
cumference of a circle whose centre would be the point
of the angle, would be the size of the angle.
As a watch face is divided into 12 hours or 60
minutes, and a circle into 360 degrees—each “ hour ”
on a watch face cuts off or contains 30 degrees, and
each minute 6 degrees. Hence the hands of the watch
at 11 o’clock or 1 o’clock make an angle of 30 degrees,
at 10 o’clock or 2 o’clock 60 degrees, at 9 o’clock or 3
o’clock 90 degrees, and so on.


Hints for Judging Distances.
Judging distances is a branch of a soldier’s work
which can be readily acquired, but which requires
practice.
Never make a wild guess at a distance, have some
such method as is given in the following :
At 50 yards a person’s mouth and eyes can be
clearly seen.
At 100 yards a person’s eyes appear like dots.
At 200 yards all parts of the body, badges, etc., can
be seen.
At 300 yards the face is indistinct.
At 400 yards the movements of the legs can be made
out.
At 500 yards the head and hat can be seen and
colours distinguished.
At 600 yards the head is like a dot.
At 700 yards it is difficult to distinguish the head.
Points to be Observed.
The distance is usually over-estimated when —
Looking over broken ground.
In a dull light.
Object is in the shade.
Heat haze is rising from the ground.
Both background and object are the same colour.
Kneeling or lying down.
The distance is usually under-estimated when :
The air is clear and the sun is shining brightly on
the object.
Looking across level ground, snow, or water.
Colour of object is different from the background.
Looking uphill or down.


Points of the Compass.
The following points, not shewn in the diagram,
come between each of the points there shewn
From N. to E. : —N. by E., N.E. by N., N.E. by
E., E. by N.
From E. to S. E. by S., S.E. by E., S.E. by S.,
S. by E.
From S. to W. S. by W., S.W. by S. f S.W. by
W., W. by S.
From IV. to N. W. by N., N.W. by W., N.W,
by N., N. by W.
The use of the “ Points of the Compass ” is very-
inconvenient on land, and readings in degrees are
preferable. 32 points correspond with 360 degrees, each
point being worth 11? degrees.

First Aid in case of Accidents.
The following hints are only intended as a reminder
to assist you when in doubt.
To Stop Bleeding. —Place a pad of clean cloth on
the wound and bandage firmly. Raise the part
affected. If raising the limbs or applying a pad does
not control the bleeding, compress with your two
thumbs over bone and as near the wound as possible.
Give no stimulants as long as bleeding remains
uncontrolled.
Burns and Scalds. —Exclude the part from the
air at once , by dusting flour on it and covering with
cotton wool. If there is a blister do Not prick it for
applications are Carron Oil, Salad_ Oil,
Vaseline, Lard, etc. If there is severe shock, give it
immediate attention, even before attending to the
burn or scald.
Fractures.— The two main classes of fractures are
simple and compound and the first aid treatment you
give is to prevent the simple fracture from becoming
the more serious compound fracture, which has a
wound caused by the jagged end of the broken bone.
Attend to the patient on the spot, and fix the injured
limb, at once , by splints and bandages. Use great
gentleness. .
If there is a wound, cleanse it and apply antiseptic
dressing before putting limb in splints.
Disturb the limb as little as possible and make the
patient comfortable until arrival of doctor.
Snake Bites.— Tie something tightly round the
limb, between the wound and the heart. Give patient
a good dose of brandy or some other spirit.
Encourage the bleeding by squeezing the bitten
part and bathe with warm water. If breathing is bad,
use artificial respiration.
Poisons.— ln the first place endeavour to find out
the poison. If you cannot, and there are no stains


Arterial System.
a, temporal artery; b , carotid artery; c, vertebra!
artery; d, e, subclavian artery; f aorta, or great
axillary artery; h, brachial artery; i, celiac
artery;/, renal artery; k, iliac artery; I , femoral
artery; m, posterior tibial artery; n, anterior tibial
artery ; o, peroneal artery ;p, pedal artery.


about mouth or lips and no burning sensation in mouth
and throat give an emetic or tickle throat to make
patient vomit. Emetics are: three teaspoonfuls of
mustard in pint of tepid water; salt and water, two
babiespoonfuls to pint of warm water.
When there are stains, etc., give cream, white of
«cggs, olive or linseed oil (no oil with phosphorous
poisoning). Antidotes to follow.
Grit in the Eye. —Do not rub the injured eye.
By rubbing the other eye yon will bring tears, which
may wash the grit out. If grit is under the upper
lid instruct patient to lift it over the lower lid, look
•downwards, apply gentle pressure, and forcibly open
the eye, thus using the lower eyelashes as a brush.
If unsuccessful roll back the upper eyelid over a match,
or pencil, and remove the grit with the corner of your
/handkerchief or small camel hair brush.
If lime in eye, wash out at once with water, then
•drop olive or castor oil between lids.
Do not attempt to remove anything deeply
imbedded—drop in olive oil, bandage and send for
-doctor.
Fainting.— The patient is very pale and partially
■or completely unconscious. Pulse is weak and rapid
.and breathing quickened. No convulsions.
Place the patient in a lying-down position with the
head lower than, the rest of the body. Loosen his
•clothing at neck and chest. Keep the crowd back and
give patient plenty of fresh air. Sprinkle face and
.chest with cold water and apply smelling salts to nose.
Rub the limbs towards the body. Give stimulant
when patient is able to swallow.
Sprains.—Appl3 r cold water dressings so long as
they give comfort, and afterwards apply hot fomenta-
tions. Rest the part in an easy position. If movement
of limb be essential, bandage it tightly. If in doubt,
(■’treat as a fracture.

Horses and their Care.
1. Always look over your horse every morning-, he
may have been kicked during the night.
2. If your horse refuses to eat report the case at
once —a sign of illness generally.
3. Watch your horse’s eyes, if there are signs of
w r eeping, it is dangerous.
4. Always clean out your horse’s feet before you
go on a journey, and especially when you return ;
nails are easily picked up on the road, and are very
dangerous if they penetrate the feet.
5. Never strike your horse over the head,
6. Should your Horse Blanket be damp, coyer 3'our
horse’s back with hay or straw before j'-ou put it on.
7. If your horse becomes lame, ascertain which leg
it is lame on and then examine the foot. Should there
be great heat in the foot undoubtedly the trouble is
there.
8. Your horse should be re-shod once a month, in
many cases it is necessary to have new shoes every
three weeks.
9. If the weather is frosty, have your horses shoes
“roughed” before you go out, to prevent slipping.
10. Never water or feed your horse with a bit in
his mouth.
11. Always keep your horse’s bit clean and the
leather of your harness soft, however bad the
conditions.
12. If your horse is very hot and sweating, you
may give water, but he should be kept on the move
until he has cooled down.
13. Never water your horse from shell holes, it is
dangerous.
14. Always water your horses before feeding; if
desired and necessary water could be given one hour
after feeding.
15. Give your horse ample time to drink; do not
think he has finished when he raises his head, he is
only getting his wind after his first fill.


16. Always remove your horse’s nosebag as soon as
he has finished, or he will destroy it by rubbing it on
the ground.
17. When picketing your horse in a field, never
secure him to a peg that is protruding a few inches
above ground, If the horse should roll he will un-
doubtedly injure himself.
18. Your horse needs at least one hour’s good
grooming twice every day.
19. Always keep your horse’s heels thoroughly
clean, and in wet weather as dry as possible.
20. If by rubbing the skin of your horse you notice
him twitching and curling his lips, report the case ; he
undoubtedly has a slight skin disease.
21. Should your horse have the common complaint
of “colic,” keep him moving until you get assistance;
it is dangerous to let him lie down and roll.
22. Never forget to loosen the girth of a saddled
horse when about to eat or drink.
*********
A good horse should possess the following: —
Head not too large in proportion to its size.
Ears should be carried upright—bad tempered horses
usually carry their ears flat when they are approached.
Eye set well out at the side of the head—bad
tempered horses frequently show the white of the eye
in looking backwards.
Neck strong and muscular. Riding horses should
possess necks of good carriage and long rein.
Withers neither too narrow or too thick, and of
medium height. High withers are always liable to
injury from the saddle.
Back short and strong.
Loin muscular, broad and short.
Ribs well hooped and deep, giving plenty of room
for heart, lungs, etc.
Shoulder set well back on the ribs —rjeitner too
upright or too short.
Fore=Arm muscular and long.
Knee good size, broad and flat, deep from front to
back.

Semaphore Signalling.
By a Signalling Instructor,
This system of Signalling is an adaptation of that
in His Majesty’s Navy, in which the letters,
numerals, etc., are sent by means of two revolving
arms set on a large pillar or stand.
Semaphore is a very useful method of signalling and
is easily learnt. The secret of good signalling is to be
•able to hold your flags at the correct angle. To do so
liold them at the full extent of your arms, so that the
flag and arms form one straight line. The forefinger
should be along the pole and touching the cloth and
the butt of the flag stick against your wrist (not up
your sleeve).
To make sure of your angles being correct when
practising, stand between a light and the wall (facing
it and close to it), and the shadow cast on the wall will
give you the correct angle. Don’t practice reading by
signalling in front of a-mirror.
Now that you have learnt the correct way to hold
your flags and know the importance of making correct
angles, proceed to learn the alphabet.
With your feet 10 inches apart stand in a well-
balanced, easy manner and go through the letters in
the diagrams by means of circles.
First Circle—A to G. A, B and C are made with
the right hand; D with either hand; E, F and G with
the left hand. Never bring the arms across the body
in making these letters, e.g, don’t use the right arm in
making E, F or G, or left for A, B or C.
Second Circle —H to N, omitting J. Right hand
at A position, and the left hand moved round.
Third Circle — O to S. Right hand at B position,
left hand moved round.
Fourth Circle—T, U, Y and APINUL (or
Erase). Right hand at C position, left hand moved
round.
Fifth Circle —Numeral sign. Alphabetical sign
J) and V. Right hand at D, left hand moved
round.

Know one circle thoroughly before you proceed to

Practise making opposite letters A and O, fWS and w,
H and Z and so on. Four letters which have no
opposites are O, R, U and M.
NUMERALS
The letters A to I and K, are used for the numerals
I to 9 .and O.
Before sending numerals you send the “ numeral
sign” and then proceed. Using A for 1, B for 2,
K for O (not io), etc. When finished sending numerals
make the “ Alphabetical Sign ” (J), and go on with
the message.
Figures are always checked back by the receiver »
is checked by A, 12 by AB, 1916 by AIAF, etc.
LEARNING TO READ.
To become proficient at reading get a good signaller
to send to you. If you can't get a good signaller, or
if vou want to practice indoors, you can do better
than get a packet of Semaphore Signalling Cards.
By means of them you with practice, become
fairly proficient at reading. The cards are easily
carried in the pocket.
pot*se Signalling.
By a Signalling Instructor.
To many this system of signalling seems very
difficult, but it is not so difficult as one imagines, and
even if it were, it is more important and of greater use
than Semaphore, and when once you know it the gain
is greater.
It can be used in flag signalling at short and long
distances; lamp signalling for night work; helxo-

Morse Alphabet.
graphing by means of the sun’s rays ; and the telegraph
key for ordinary and wireless telegraphy.
The alphabet is made up of dots and dashes, the dot
being equal to one upit of time and the dash three
times the length of the dot. Between each letter there
is a pause equal to one dash, and between words or
groups of letters a pause equal to two dashes.
To learn the alphabet in the correct and easiest
manner do so as shown above. Learn the opposites a
few at a time, then the four letters which have no
opposites, making up words as you go along.
|V£oi?s@ Signalling — continued .


To memorise each letter call the dot “iddy” and
the dash “ umpty ” —representing the sounds made by
the telegraph key —thus the letter K ® mmirnssm
would be “umpty-iddy-umpty,” laying stress on the
“ umpty.”
NUMERALS.
In Morse the numerals are checked back by means
of the letters Ato K. 1913 is checked by A! AC.
HOW TO SEND A MESSAGE IN BOTH
SEMAPHORE AND MORSE.
The method of sending will be same both
Semaphore and Morse, except where shown in the
miscellaneous special signals on next page.
Bear in mind that the “ general answer” is one dash
in Morse and the letter Ain Semaphore. Each word
is acknowledged by the “ general answer.”
Call up by making the “ preparation.” Come down
to the “ready” position (Semaphore) or the “ prepare
to signal ” position (Morse) after each word.
Stand directly facing the person you are signalling
to. In Morse you may require to stand with your back
to the wind blowing from his direction.
The “caller” and “writer” should stand immediately
in rear of the “sender” and “reader” respective!}’, so
that they may be clear of the flags and yet close
enough to be heard and to hear the latter distinctively.
LETTERS WHICH SOUND ALIKE.
Certain letters in the alphabet being very like each
other in sound have been given names, and to avoid
mistakes you should always use those names.
A is called Ack. P is called Pip.
B „ Beer. S „ Esses.
D „ Don. T „ Talk.
M „ Emma. V „ Vick.
When reading out the word STAMPED you would
say '* Esses —talk —ack —emma —pip—e —don.”
This applies to both signalling systems.

Care of the Feet.
The real causes of sore feet are ill-fitting boots and socks
combined with uncleanliness.
The feet should be washed at least once a day, and if this
is impossible they should be wiped over with a damp cloth,
especially about the toes.
Excessive sweating may be relieved by bathing the feet in
water coloured a bright pink with permanganate of potash.
Socks when taken off should be stretched, well shaken, and
placed on the opposite feet when next worn. W here the socks
fit over tender parts of the feet they should be greased inside.
Blisters should be pricked with a clean needle and all tender
parts smeared with some simple ointment or with soap.
A good ointment is one of vaseline with 2 per cent, of salicylic
acid added, and various powders are in use for the same
purpose.

WAR MEDALS AND AWARDS.
The custom of awarding medals dates back to the
Chinese, several centuries before the Christian era, but
in the British Empire Queen Elizabeth was the first to
so award her fighting men, she however conferred
. mec^a^s on naval officers only, and it was left to
Charles I to make similar awards to the Army, and
then only to officers. It was not until the time of
Cornwell that a medal was awarded to a whole Army,
and that was to commemorate the battle of Dunbar,
165°. The first ribbon of special pattern to be
issued was with the medals awarded for the battle of
Culloden, 1746. Ihe first “Bar” was given with
the Peninsular Medals. Prior to the East India cam-
paign, medals were more frequently made oval in
shape, but since then chiefly round, some have been
faced with glass.
Formerly medals were worn suspended by ribbon
around the neck, then from the coat button, and as
ciow, pinned to the left breast of coat.
A great number of Bars have been issued with
some medals, the Naval General Service Medal of
1847, has 240.
The Ribbons herein illustrated are worn as indicated
with the following Medals
, V.C.—Victoria Cross. —lnstituted by Qn. Victoria

Points of the Compass.
It is not generally understood that the index pointer
of a Compass does not indicate true north. The daily
difference is about ten seconds varying from year to
year, the variation being less in the winter than in the
summer. The present variation at Greenwich is nearly
141 degrees west.
To “box” the Compass it is necessary for you to be
able to repeat the names of the different points right
round the Compass from N. to N. A better way to
learn the Compass is to learn it in sections, first the
Cardinal points, N., S., E. &W. Then pass on tothe
Half-Cardinal points which are between the Cardinal
points ; these are N.E., S.E., S.W., & N.W.
The next divisions are between the Cardinal and Half-
Cardinal points; these are called the three-letter or
intermediate points. There are eight: N.N.E., E.N.E.,
E.S.E., S.S.E., S.S.W., W.S.W., W.N.W., & N.N.W,
Note that two Easts or two Wests never come together

FIXING PICTURE HOOKS TO SOFT WALLS.
In many houses it is very difficult to fix nails in walls firmly
enough owing to the soft powdery condition of the plaster.
To overcome the difficulty cut a piece of wood as shown on
opposite page and bore six countersunk holes in_ it. _ Glue
the back of the block, stick to the wall and drive in six fine
nails. The job when set is quite firm and will hold a good
weight.

MAKING LEATHER BOOTLACES. Cut your
piece of leather into a circle about size of condensed milk
tin. With a sharp penknife cut round the edge the exact
thickness you wish the lace to be when finished. Now cut
the piece of wood shown in small sketch. Press point of
knife into table and place the piece of wood over the
.leather and in front of the knife to hold leather steady.
All you need to do now is to pull on the end of the leather
strip

AN OUTDOOR RAT-TRAP. This outdoor rat-trap
is easily made. Get a branch with a good spring in it and
press it into the ground just near the run of the rats.
Attach a piece of string to the branch and to the string
attach a piece of wire’with a loop. Just behind the loop is
fixed a piece of wood as shown in the small sketch. Another
piece of wood, with a notch in it, is pressed firmly into the
ground close to the run. Set the trap by drawing down
the string and hook the pieces of wood together. Arrange
the wire loop about two inches from the ground.

CUTTING SOAP. There is an art in doing everything,
even to the seemingly simple action of cutting a bar of soap
into cubes. As a rule the soap cutter takes up his knife and
rashly plunges it into the pasty mass, with the result that
it emerges in a sticky and unpleasant condition, necessitating
much washing before it can be used for other cutting
purposes. A much cleaner way is shown in the sketch.
Lay a sheet of paper on the soap and proceed to cut the
soap.

CAN’T GET THE CORK OUT. If when you are
trying to get the cork out of a bottle you accidentally push
it in it can be easily got out with a piece of thin wire or
string. Double the wire and insert the loop into the bottle.
Work the loop about until it catches round the end of the
cork, as in sketch on opposite page, then puli carefully and
the cork will come out.

MAKING A MALLET. A very useful thing to have,
either in your own garden or at camp, is a heavy, wooden
mallet for driving stakes, fence poles, etc. It is easily
made where good sized tree limbs are available. Select
the weightiest, saw it to the required length, and, with a
red-hot poker, bore it through the centre.
Then get a stout length of branch cut it to the necessary
length and drive it securely through the mallet head.

KEEPS THE CHAIN FROM RATTLING. Chains
are necessary things, but are sadly given to rattling, and to
listen to one clanking about at night, or being dragged along
the yard by the watch-dog, makes you think of all the ghost
stories you ever heard. It is a very irritating sound for
anyone who is sick.
You can prevent chains from rattling by weaving a rope
into the links as shown in the illustration.

WATCH YOUR MATCHES. It is “hard lines ”
when the match box in your pocket slips open and leaves
the contents loose in your pocket. Or you may be opening
the box and the matches fall to the ground.
To prevent this, place an elastic band from end to
end on the box as shown in the picture. This keeps the
box closed and also forms a spring which closes the box
automatically when you have taken out the match.

“HANG! THE BILLY.” It’s a strain on your
patience when the billy (or mess-tin) keeps on wobbling,
instead of sitting firmly on the fire. By using this tip
you can boil the billy safely and sit back and take it
easy.
Get a stout stick a few feet long and stick it into the
ground at a slant. Then cut a short stick, forked at
one end, force it in the earth, and lay the other branch
over this. Make a small notch in the end of the long
stick and hang the billy on.

THE HAT BUCKLE. In olden times most men had
to be ready to fight at a moment’s notice, and it was
important that no detail of their dress should interfere
in any way with the use of their weapons. For this
reason hang mg plumes and feathers were always worn
on the left side of the hat, so as to leave the right side
free for the movements of the sword. When ribands and
bands were worn round the hat or cap to pull it
tightly to the head, the bow was tied on the left side
for exactly the same reason.

TESTING JUDGMENT OF SHORT DISTANCES.
All good scouts should be able to judge and compare
distances accurately. An interesting test of this ability
is shown in the illustration.
Ask your chum to arrange three coins, washers, or
similar discs in triangle form, so that the distances A
are equal to the distance B. Almost invariably the third
washer, at the apex of the triangle, will be placed in a
position as indicated by the dotted line.

FIXING A HANDLE. When fixing a steel chisel
or hammer-head into a handle, never appty a blow to the
tool itself. Even though, as in the case of a hammer, the
tool has no edge, and is not likely to be damaged by a
blow, it is a mistake to bang it into the wood.
i By knocking the other end of the handle against a firm
oeject, the tool will fix itself firmlj T into the wood at a
minimum of trouble to yourself.

SUBSTITUTE FOR A RATCHET BRACE. It. is
often difficult to bore a hole in a corner when a ratchet
brace is not at hand. Get a brass door knob, a small bar
and a brace bit. Make a hole right through the knob just
big enough for the bar to pass through. When you want
to bore a hole, put the bit in the knob as you would in a
brace and the tommy bar through the knob. Start turning
the bit by the bar.

USE FOR FRETWORK WASTE WOOD. All fret-
workers have waste pieces which are generally thrown
away. Here is a useful hint. Collect all your small pieces
of different wood and cut it into triangular pieces one inch
each side. Take a piece of strong linen and glue on the
triangular pieces of wood in some kind of pattern. Use as
table mats to protect good tables from the heat of hot
pistes.

CORK JAWS FOR A VICE. Cork jaws are used for
holding a delicate article in a vice when the steel jaws
would only mark or damage it. Cut out two pieces of wood
about 5 in. thick and glue two pieces of cork on to the wood
as shown in Fig. 1. Screw two strips of hoop-iron on to the
ends of the pieces of wood in order to join both pieces of
wood together. It may now' be bent up as in Fig. 2 and
will fit down nicely between the jaws of the vice.

NO MUD IN THE HOUSE. _ When you have finished
gardening there is a certain amount of mud on your
boots, which would make the house dirty if you did not
scrape them on a mud-scraper, If you have not one handy
make this one. Get a piece of iron-hoop or slate about one
and a-half feet long and make a hole about one or two
inches from each end. Then you want two stakes about
two feet long and three inches in diameter. Make a deep-
groove in the top of the stake of 3 ins. Then fit the iron

FOR A SALE OF WORK. Here is something attrac-
tive to make—a hanging basket —for your next sale, and
you can have it for your own home. Cut a circular piece of
small mesh wire netting of about eighteen inches diameter
and take three pieces of strong ware about 23 feet long, and
fix them at equal distances round the netting as shown.
Then form a loop at the top to hang it up with by twisting
with a stick. Cut a piece of turf and place it in the basket

FLASH LAMPS. You often want to concentrate the
rays from your pocket flash lamp on a certain place, rather
than have them spread out as they are in most lamps. The
addition of a hood, which may be slipped over the lens,
concentrates the light. Take a strip of thin tin 4 inches long
and f inch wide, drill or cut a hole about size of lens out in
the centre. Solder a short tube to fit over the hole. Bend
the ends of the strip back at right angles to hold the hood
firmly to the side of the lamp case.

SPLIT YOUR AXE HANDLE ? A split axe handle
can be made stronger than new by using this tip. Bind the
whole length of the split evenly with light wire, then cover
carefully and tightly with three coverings of tape.
If the tape is wound the full length of the handle and a
thick coat of shellac is applied the axe will have a fine
appearance. It will also be stronger than ever.

DEVICE FOR A DRAUGHT CURTAIN. The best
cure for a draughty door is a curtain hung over the mside of
it. To be really effective, however, such a curtain must
come well down to the floor, and this is apt to hinder the
opening of the door.
You require 5 feet of cord, two screw eyes and a strong
safety-pin. Screw one of the eyes into the top of tne
door-frame and the others into the top of the door. Pass
cord down through these, there being a knot at its top end
to hold cord in place. Pin the end of cord to the foot of me
curtain.

CANDLE-FLAME HAS THREE PARTS. If you
look at a candle-flame you will see that it is made of three
parts. The first layer next the wick is faint bluish in colour
and transparent, next comes the luminous bright layer, and
outside an indistinct layer. The bluish layer is unburnt
vapour, the luminous layer is incandescent particles of
carbon. The faint outside layer is where the burning of
the vapour is completed. If you hold a piece of glass tubing
with one end in the blue flame and apply a lighted match to
the other end a flame will burn there.

Hold a lighted candle at the three positions shown in the

the bottom it will go towards the inside cl room because the
cold air is blowing in from outside. In the middle the flame
will be upright because of the rising current of warm air.

hold an inverted test tube full of water. Now apply heat
to the tin and bubbles will rise in the test tube, filling the
tube with a gas. A lighted match will burn in this gas,

KEEPING THE HAND DRY IN WATER. Buy

rub it well over the hand. Now plunge your hand into

particles of lycopodium powder, which, though not visible,
cover your hand. Dry puff-ball powder will do equally well.

HOW AN IRON FENCE IS FIXED, You havi
no doubt wondered how an iron fence is able to stand th
strain, standing on a stone pavement. How are the meta
supports fixed in the stone so firmly as not to give in an;
direction ? A common method is that shown in the sketcl
on opposite page. _
A cone shaped hole is cut in the stone base and into thi
the end of the iron support is stood. Note the base ha
three projections. When molten lead is poured in hoi
these projections keep the support firmly in position.

The recording of wind velocities and pressures is very
important from a metereological point of view. The wind
measurer, or anemometer as it is called, is shown on the
opposite page. The fodr cups catch the blowing wind and
turn the spindle. There is a worm on the spindle which
turns a small cog-wheel, and this in turn moves a number of
other toothed wheels. The velocity is worked out from the
number of revolutions indicated.

If you hang it as shown in fig. 2 nothing will prevent it
from falling and being broken should the cord give.
The safest way is shown in fig. 3. The picture is then
held securely, and its weight evenly distributed.

also often spoils your shoes or boots.
You can, however, avoid these inconveniences quite
easily. All you need do is to take a stick of sealing-wax

First tie a knot on the end of a duster or piece of rag,
and shut it in a drawer or door. Pass the lamp chimney
over the duster, the end of which is held secure in your
left hand. Rub the glass up and down and round and
round with your right hand until the inside is quite clean.
Do not try to force your hand into a lamp-glass, because if

the city boy put the nails in as in No. 3, but the country
boy put them in as in No. 4. The country boy was right,
because the town boy put the nail in so that it wedged open

THE AUSTRALIAN COMMONWEALTH.
The Australian Commonwealth is* a Confederation of
six States :—New South Wales, Victoria, South
Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and
Tasmania. Each of these States retains its own
Legislature and has sovereign rights within its own
borders, except in so far as these rights have been
passed to the Federal Parliament by the Imperial
Statute in which the Constitution is defined.
The Federal Government possesses a small strip of
territory, which will ultimately contain the Federal
Capital, made over to it by N.S.W., and also ,the
Central block of Northern Australia formerly adminis-
tered by South Australia.
At the present time, the Federal Government sits at
Melbourne, the capital of Victoria.
The Federal Government deals with Australian
external affairs and its interest in regard to other
countries, with —
Posts and Telegraphs.
General Taxation.
Customs and Excise.
Defence—Military and Naval.
Lighthouses and Quarantine.
Matters referred by States Government.
Matters in which the interests of more than
one State are involved ; such as arbitration,
etc,, etc.
The Federal Judicature consists of the Chief Justice
and four Judges who comprise the High Court, and
constitute a final Court of Appeal from the Courts of
the various States.

MEMORANDA.


They never fall who die
In a great cause. . . Though years
Elapse, and others share as dark a doom,
They but augment the deep and sweeping
thoughts
That overpower all others, and conduct
The world at last to Freedom.
Byron.
