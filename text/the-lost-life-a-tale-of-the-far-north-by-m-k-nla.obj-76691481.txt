?Tis said ?Alas ! that it should be ?
This is no land for minstrelsy ;
That ages yet must roll along,
And things assume the white of eld,
Before the poet or his song
Can be in estimation held ;
And those who say this cruel thing,
To prove it, point a warning finger,
To fruitless efforts which they bring,
Of many an ambitious singer.
I will not contradict their say,
Altho? I feel in Eden?s bowers,
The birds poured forth as blithe a lay,
As in this worn old world of ours I
Song is of nature, not of years ;
And if the world unheeded hears
Its voice, the bard can only wail,
The prejudices that prevail,
To mar the welcome of his tale.
For me, I do not care to know,
Whether or not the case be so,


THE PARTING.
And reckless of the world?s esteem,
My rude bush harp that long; has lain
At rest, to an Australian theme?
Couragiously I?ll tune again.
It is a melancholy lay
That in the North, far far away,
I heard its happless hero tell,
And thus it was his story fell?
? Ah ! yes, my heart is pulseless grown,
And gladness is to me unknown ;
For years of lonely sorrowing
Have drained and dried life?s every spring.
Till not a longing?s left me, save
The quiet of a Christian?s grave.
It was not so when I was young,
For hope?s bright star its radiance flung,
O?er every path my feet might tread ;
Alas ! its rays have long been dead,
And every joy?s been reft away ?
E?en she, my loved one, could not stay
To welcome me with smiles again,
Back to the homes of Christian men ;
I?d weep, but that the well of tears
Has been a-dry these many years.
It was an evening long ago,
So ]ong I scarcely dare to think,
That hand in hand and heart aglow,
We sat beside the river?s brink,


THE PARTING.
And gazed with love?s enraptured eye
Upon, it as it rippled by,
?towards the ever lustful sea,
As the soul to eternity?
And then the eye sought upward feast,
For love is greedy of delight,
And from the clouds that flecked the east
Wrought out a picture exquisite ;
Bewildering isles they seemed to be,
Set in a blue and waveless sea,
With hills whereon reposed at rest,
The shimmering sunset of the west,
And marvellous cliffs and rocky shores,
Where never fell the plash of oars ;
And, distant on the dreamy blue ?
As far as reach of human view?
Some fleecy specs the eye could meet,
Like sails of an advancing fleet.
Oh! ?twas a picture passing fair,
And long it kept us lingering there
Till night?s voluptuous embrace,
Left of the day no single trace.
Ah! me, the dream of love is sweet,
When youthful hearts in concord meet,
And hands are clasped and lips but move
To murmur words, whose breath is love !
What pity that it e?er should be,
Dispelled by stem reality ;
And sitting by that river-there


THE PARTING.
We lived in loves own atmosphere,
And tho? the words we spake were few,
Yet each the other?s feeling knew
To be unalterably true
Oh ! she was fair ?at least to me
She seemed the fairest that could be ;
Her rippling hair like threads of gold,
Was looped in many a simple fold;
Her eyes? soft blue, seemed to express,
The very soul of tenderness ;
A playful dimple
her chin ;
And just to show the pearls within,
Her lips ?the rose had touched so lightly
With its own hue ?were parted slightly ;
But ?twas not in her face alone,
Attraction sat upon his throne ;
?Twas round about her like a zone,
That you might neither see nor feel,
That to the heart like music?s tone,
Made constant and direct appeal.
No wonder that I loved her well,
Loved her as tongue nor pen can tell,
My own true hearted Ysohel!
From childhood I had sailed the sea,
And voyaged to many a distant shore,
To burning Inds intensity,
And the ice cliffs of Lahradoar ?
I loved it for its roving life,


THE PARTING.
And felt secure upon the deck,
E?en when the elemental strife
Threatened the ship with instant wreck
It was the only home I knew,
The only home I cared to have,
Till Yso?s eyes of rapturous blue,
Made me their sorrow and their slave.
Then yearning for a life of rest,
As earnestly my soul possessed ;
As unto one in agony
Of mortal pain, the wish to die !
Laying her little hand in mine,
Said Yso ? must again the brine,
Bear thee away from Yso?s side J
And is this glorious eventide
The last that we shall spend together,
Till weary moon?s both come and go,
And doubtful breezes waft you hither?
Oh, tell me Ernest, is it so ?
Can it not be ? Can love of mine,
Not stay this roving life of thine ?
Wide is the land, and there is still
Many a hoof untrampled hill;
Many a fair and flowery mead,
Where fleecy flocks may thriving feed,
That owns no lord as yet, where we
Might live and love and happy be!
Such, Ernest seek and make a home,
And conquer this desire to roam ;


THE PARTING.
For ?twas but y ester-night in sleep,
I had a vision of the deep,
And borne where?er the wind and tide
Listed, a something I espied,
?Twas not a ship, ?twas not a boat,
But some mis-shapen thing of note,
That neither sail nor oar did guide ;
And lying blistering side by side
Beneath the cruel sun of heaven,
Were human forms, in number, seven.
So weary were they and so weak,
That when they made essay to speak,
Their bloodless lips refused their aid,
And the words died away half made.
Oh ! it was pitiful to see,
And feel their every hope was gone ;
God grant that it may never be,
For of the seven thou wert one !?
? Dearest ! ?twas but a dream,? I said,
? And dreams should aye be backward read ;
At least, so sailor sages say,
And who more credible than they ?
For me, I do not heed them more,
Than the white surf upon the shore,
When mated by a hardy crew,
And a good boat to bear me through ;
And Yso, since with thee I met,
My heart upon a home has set;
A home in some sweet-sylvan nook,


THE PARTING.
By an acacia bordered brook.
With flocks and herds to browse around,
And a rich plot of garden ground,
And fruitful fields of golden corn,
And birds to wake us every morn;
Where year by year will glide along
Like the refrain of some old song.
That even when ended, leaves behind
A pleasing impress on the mind ;
And when my ship returns again,
Farewell for ever to the main.
But this one time I?m doomed to go?
For circumstances rule it so,
Which now to leave undone or thwart,
Would only injure thee, dear heart !
Duty to thee, and to myself,
Requires that I should gather pelf;
And by this voyage enough I?ll win,
A landsman?s labors to begin,
Without foreboding doubts or fears,
Of want of wealth in future years.
Nor will my absence be for long?
Two moon?s twice told will scarcely wane
Before my sailors anchor song,
Will cheer thee with its ring again.
The winds of heaven have heretofore,
Wafted me safe from shore to shore ?
; ' J
*


THE PARTING.
And this last time their aid from me,
Will surely not withholden be !
Nay, I can feel they?ll kindlier sing,
And pant thy lover back to bring,
To make of thee a wedded wife,
And lead a landsman?s settled life.
It is the faith ?the hope of this,
That bids me take the parting kiss,
The memory of which will cheer ?
As under skies unknown to me,
My good ship holds her brave career,
Merrily, so merrily !?
Leaning her head upon my breast :
? Ernest, whate?er you deem the best,
That do ; and I will strive with prayer,
To overcome my trembling fears,
And heaven may give me strength to bear.
And stay forebodings bitter tears.
1 know that woman?s thoughts are weak?
I know that visions falsely speak ?
I know our lives are in the hand
Of Him who heaven and earth has planned
And that His all protecting care,
Is present with us everywhere ;
On stable land or far at sea,
Where tempests hold their revelry ;
That not a leaf can fall to earth ?
That not a sound of woe or mirth ?
That not a bird can wing its flight?-


THE PARTING.
That not a lonely flower can blow,
Until the wonderous Infinite
Has first declared ? let it be so.?
And whilst we put our trust in him,
The lamp of hope will ne?er burn dim;
And take thou this,? she said, and placed
Around my neck, a silken string,
That her own lily throat had graced ;
And from it hung a treasured thing ?
A golden locket deftly chased,
With flowerets delicately traced,
And azure gems whose setting caught,
The form of a ? Forget Me Not
And guarded by a curious spring?
Her portrait and one tress of hair,
Gathered into a fairy ring?
From vulgar eyes secreted were.
? And when you?re far away at sea,
Sailing ?neath skies I cannot tell,
Twill haply make you think of me,
Your own true-hearted Ysobel.?
She ceased, and closer to my breast,
Her form I rapturously pressed,
And sealed again loves sacred vow,
Upon her lips and upturned brow ;
And kissed away the starting tears,
And soothed her trembling and her fears.
Oh ! moments of felicity,
How dear your memory is to me ;


THE PARTING,
How often have ye in these years,
Striven to keep hope?s star elate?
All fruitless tho? it now appears ?
And nerved my heart to hear its fate.
I almost cursed the cannon?s roar,
That told of rising wind and tide,
And the swift pinnace sent ashore,
To bear me from my Yso?s side!
Ah! me, the pleasure and the pain *
That mingles in the parting kiss?
Pleasure to think we?ll meet again,
And pain, lest love?s farewell it is.
We know not ?and perhaps ?tis well?
What in the future?s womb is hid,
For earth would be a howling hell
Could frail mortality foretell,
The secrets of the coffin lid,
Or even what lies beyond the morrow,
If known, would but engender sorrow!
And when the final moment came,
That tearful dalliance could claim,
One long, long look into her face,
One long and rapturous embrace,
One burning kiss was ours, and then?-
We parted, ne?er to meet again I


Silent the old man sat awhile.
And pressed his brow as if to stay ?
Alas ! it was no easy toil ?
The grief awakened by his lay.
For who unmoved can think upon
The dreams of youth for ever gone ?
And joys, whose promise lent to life,
A lure to battle with its strife,
Buried like early childhoods tears,
In the dark tomb of vanished years ?
And who on that mysterious spell,
That love threw o?er the heart, can dwell,
E?re the rough world through which we press
Had blunted passions tenderness ?
Which by inexorable fate,
Was broken and left desolate ;
Without some symbol of regret ?
A sigh, perhaps, or it may be
A tear, the withered cheek to wet
Or mute perspiring agony ?
But mastering his cruel pain,
The old man thus resumed again :
? The boat was waiting, and the rowers


TII E SIIIPWII E C K .
Impatient dallied with their oars,
Thinking each moment of delay
As so much good wind thrown away;
And scarcely had I ta?en my seat,
Before the blades the waters meet,
And quivering with renewed delight,
The boat sprang out into the might,
Bounding o?er billows stern and black,
Leaving behind a silvery track.
The vessel in the offing lay,
And by her night-lamp?s lonely ray
We steered our course, nor was' it long
Before the sailors gladsome song,
Upon the ear began to creep,
Blended with noises of the deep?
The wind?s moan, the sibilant dash
Of waters, and the sudden splash
Of porpoise bounding gaily on,
And the shrill shriek of sea bird lone.
Stroke followed stroke, the way grew less
It dwindled down to nothingness,
Then ere the boat was even tied,
I bounded up the vessel?s side,
And scanned her fair proportions over,
With all the rapture of a lover ?
While every ear and every hand,
Expecting, waited ray command.


TII E SHIPWRECK.
Quickly the anchor was a-trip,
The canvas to the wind was spread,
And to the rudder?s strain, the ship
Yielded, and seaward swung her head,
And soon the waters round her hissed,
And frothed and foamed and broke in mist
When the grey dawn became defined,
The mountains only lay behind
To break the vision?s utmost strain,
Like slumbering clouds upon the main,
And hour by hour they fainter grew,
Until even they were lost to view ;
And then, and not till then, I felt
My heart with strange emotions melt;
A kind of gnawing wretchedness,
That feeble words may not express,
Crept o?er me, and a sickening sense
Of loneness growing more intense.
My gallant ship had lost her charms,
The winds had lost their melody,
While unaccountable alarms
Took a mysterious hold on me ;
And ever and anon, my gaze
Was bent astern far o'er the swell,
Half hopeful, through the distant haze,
To see the form I loved so well.
For, never did I know till then
The half of parted lovers pain.


THE SHIPWRECK.
What need to tell of life at sea ?
Its wearisome monotony,
Repels the bard, or if he try
To let his muse essay a flight,
Quickly its spirit seems to die,
And faint and feeble ?twill alight;
Unless, when tempest rules the gale,_
And rends to shreds the shivering sail,
And makes the cordage howl with pain?
Strained till it can no further strain ?
And the sea yawns, and boils and roars,
And o?er the deck relentless pours,
Until the crew turn pale with fear,
And cling to rope or railing near,
While the brave ship with creak and groan
Plunges and rolls, yet holds her own.
Days ?weeks flew past, without a thing,
Or incident to mark their flight;
And all my fears had taken wing,
And hope was high, the future bright.
The winds continued fair to blow,
And warmer suns began to glow,
And brighter stars began to keep,
At night, a watch upon the deep,
And all things augured to the ship
A prosperous and speedy trip.
One night, the moon was at the full,
And promenading in the cool,


THE SHIPWRECK.
An old man touched his hat to me?
The boatswain of the ship was he,
Hard-featured, rough, but kind of heart,
And perfect in his seaman?s art.
* Well Ben, what news ?? I careless said,
? What think you of these favoring gales ?
It seems that we might lie a-bed
For ever without shifting sails V
* True,? he replied ? the winds I own,
From heaven were never fairer blown ;
But take my word lor gospel song,
They?ll alter before very long ;
That ring around the moon bespeaks
Foul weather on to-morrow?s cheeks,
And in these latitudes, I know
The winds, when so inclined, can blow ;
But, Captain, ?tisn?t that I dread ? ?
He lowered his voice as this he said,
As seemingly afraid to let,
The words go past where we were set ?
? But from the dawning of this day,,
I?ve seen a shark around us play ;
No common scavenger is he ?
No refuse eater of the sea ?
But one whose cunning?s kept him clear
Of snare and bait, harpoon and spear ;
And?hist! see, there he?s, holy rood !
I fear his presence bodes no good.?
? Foolish old man,? I laughing spake,


THE SHIPWRECK.
? I thought that story of the shark,
Following in a doomed ship?s wake.
Had, like the flying Dutchman?s barque,
Been laughed to scorn in every clime,
By sailors of the present time.?
� Foolish or not sir, as you please,
But I have sailed a-many seas,
And more than once been cast adrift,
And left as best I could to shift;
And once when I was young like you,
Out of as stout a hearted crew
As ever faced disasters gale,
But three were left to tell the tale,
Of how the ? Water Witch? was lost;
And I was one ?I do not boast,
Of that as any wond?rous deed
Of mine, or my companions twain,
?Twas providence from death that freed,
And brought us safe to land again !
I but allude to it, to show,
My knowledge of mishaps at sea ;
Has from experience grown, and no
Imaginative phantasy ;
And every time the like befell ?
Perhaps ?twas chance ?I cannot tell ?
A shark of hateful magnitude,
For days before, the ship pursued ;
Whose cunning kept him ever clear,
From spare and bait, harpoon and spear.


THE SHIPWRECK.
Just like that monster on the lee,
Showing his fins above the sea ;
And Captain, judging from the past,
This cruise will be our vessel?s last;
Misgivings grave, I entertain,
She?ll never reach a port again !?
* She?ll never reach a port ?why, Ben,
Have I too been delusions slave ?
I thought of all my sailor men,
That thou wert bravest of the brave !
But now ?go to ! your childish fears
Beserve for more believing ears,
For mine are deaf? I heard him sigh?
With words he did not deign reply?
As if his poor old heart was broken,
With the harsh words that I had spoken
?Twas long before an eye would close
That night, altho? I sought repose,
By every means within my power ? ,
I heard them strike the midnight hour-
I heard the careful watch re-set ?
I heard the password given, and yet
In weary wakefulness I lay,
Tossing, and longing for the day ;
Perhaps ?twas Ben?s recital drear,
That filled me with a feverish fear,
Of possible impending ill?
For startled superstition, will
Unhinge at times the sagest mind,


THE SHIPWRECK.
With phantoms of a troublous kind?
Perhaps ?twas thoughts of Ysobel,
Counting the suns that went and came ;
Striving with maiden?s prayer to quell,
The fears she hardly dared to name.
Perhaps ?but wherefore need I say.
In sleep at last I sank away.
It was a calm and peaceful rest
As ever weary mortal blest,
And had no dreamings to distress,
Its beautiful forgetfulness ?
Oh, had it pleased the Almighty then,
To have t?aen me from the world of men,
My soul was pure as at its birth,
Without a single stain of earth !
But suddenly its peace was broken,
By hurrying feet and hoarse words spoken ;
By sailors lusty ? oh, heave oh,?
And crack of canvas just let go ?
By furious waters dashing loud,
And winds that howled in every shroud.
And ere my thoughts had time to glide,
And grasp the grim reality ;
The proud ship rolled upon her side,
And down the ladder poured the sea.
Flooding the cabin to the knee I ,
I sprang on deck without delay,


THE SHIPWRECK.
Only alas ! a scene to find,
That nought but life's departing day?
Can wholly banish from my mind?
A boiling world of foam around ;
A sky all leaden and profound ;
And savage winds?that seemed to have
No object but to rend and rave,
Howled round us until I could feel
The good ship tremble to the keel.
And tapering spars ?long time my pride?
Went crashing by the vessel?s side ; [smashed
And ropes were fouled, and boats were
To pieces, by the waves that dashed
Over the deck with thundering shock ;
At last the very rudder stock
Was from its hinges torn away ?
And, oh, my God ! ?twas then dismay,
Rendered us all too mute to pray !
But life is sweet, and men will cling
To the last fibre of its string ;
And so, instinctively and fast,
Axes were laid to every mast,
As the one chance to live that fate,
Had left us in our crippled state.
Thundering they fell into the waves, [graves,
That boiled and foamed and yawned like
And the strained hull relief did feel,


THE SHIPWRECK.
From stem to stern, from deck to keel;
And tho? her timbers groaned with pain,
She lurched herself upright again ;
Defying in her stricken hour,
The wild tornadoes desperate power !
And bravest ol the crew was Ben ?
He labored like a dozen men ?
For superstition failed to make
His heart, once roused to action, quake
Wherever danger frowned the most,
He almost seemed to seek the post,
And his calm voice to others lent
The spirit of encouragement.
And as ?twas his to note at first,
The storm, before its fury burst,
Leaping along the midnight sky ;
Again it was his practised eye,
That through the blackness of the night.
Beheld upon our weather side,
A trembling streak of silvery light,
Bise slowly from the troubled tide ;
And, ?God be praised, it breaks,? he cried
Ah, then as if by one consent,
Each knee was reverently bent,
And high above the storm was raised,
A unisonous ? God be praised !?
Day dawned?the storm had disappeared,
The sky of every cloud was cleared*


THE SHIPWRECK.
And the great deep no longer white
With the rude passion of the night,
Convulsive heaved its laboring breast
And sobbed itself again to rest.
Uprose the sun too with a bound,
And flung its warm embraces round,
The infant day of our distress,
With all a lover?s tenderness ;
As if in mockery of our fate,
So cheerless and so desolate.
And there we lay upon the ocean,
A plaything to its rolling motion,
Without a helm, or mast, or sail,
To steer a course, or catch a gale ??
Without a boat, should need demand
To leave the wreck and seek the land!
But sailor wit is hard to kill,
And sailor hands have wond?rous skill,
And soon to mend our sad estate,
Each did the other emulate ;
Some sawed, some hammered and some hewed,
At pieces of misshapen wood,
Wherewith to form a rudder rude ;
Some reared a jury mast on high,
And lashed it with a master care,
Some made the glittering needle fly?
For not a soul was idle there.
One impulse reigned in every breast.
Out of the bad to make the beat \


THE SHIPWRECK.
But, what avail is human skill,
When fate obdurately decrees,
With an implacable I will,
To batfle all its energies ?
Scarce from the storm was taken breath,
Before again the jaws of death,
Gaped with insatiate desire,
As through the ship resounded File !
Fire ! fire ! oh God 1 in such an hour,
And not a boat to leave the ship!
It made the bravest of us cower,
And sealed with horror every lip ;
And yet we did not idle stand,
Water was passed from hand to hand,
And dashed into the hold below,
That roared all luridly aglow ;
And there it like a serpent hissed,
Then rose again in scalding mist !
? Bravo ! my hearties, fire away !
Cheerly! we yet will win the day.?
I strove with steady voice to say,
Adding, with grim attempt at sport,
? No fear of water running short,?
Faster the buckets plied and faster,
And once we thought ourselves the master
As the wild element became,
Subdued a moment, and more tame ;


THE SHIPWRECK.
And the men cheered and breathed more free,
And blessed the water of the sea !
But, oh, delusive cheers and thought
Vain respite for a moment caught ?
Twas but a lull in which the foe,
Was gathering strength, that soon became
No smouldering mass, no doubtful glow?
But one infernal sheet of flame !
That leaped and flared, and drove us back
With its impetuous attack.
Then passed the word from lip to lip,
? Make ready boys to leave the ship,
Nor be your preparations slow,
For there is powder down below
Enough to send us all to heaven,
With our unhappy souls unshriven.?
Oh ! dreadful words ! and not a boat
In a condition fit to float
Tho? some foolhardily possessed
Themselves of what they deemed the best?
Which in the sea was scarcely lowered,
Before a dozen jumped aboard,
And pulled like mad?no matter where,
To clear the ship their only care.
Alas ! but speedier was their fate,
The crank boat foundered with its freight.
Those of us that were left behind.
Our quickened energies combined.


THE SHIPWRECK.
And what with coops, and hatchway bars
And a few odd convenient spars,
A raft was formed, enough to bear
Our lessened number anywhere ;
So long as storms and tempests slept,
And tbe great deep its temper kept.
And Ben ?for by ray side he stood ?
Collected, calm and firm as wood ;
Nor had his horny hands, I ween,
In our hot toil the idlest been ?
With forethought, such as only springs,
From knowledge of disastrous things ;
Secured some rations and some rope,
And threw them on our raft of hope,
And the last man was he to leave,
The burning, brave old Genevieve I
The severed line soon set us free,
And then we drifted to the lee,
Borne by the ocean?s friendly swell,
That sadly rose and softly fell?
But scarcely had we cleared away
A cables length or so, before
The ship blew up, ah ! well a day !
With such terrific belch and roar,
That the foundations of the deep
Were startled from their ancient sleep.?


Again the old man made a pause
As if the memory of the wreck
Ran foul of some of nature?s laws
And brought his narrative to check-
All power of speech seemed lost to him,
And I could see his every limb
Shudder, like one whose sore distress
Defies all efforts to repress ;
And as he mutely sat, his eye
Was fixed upon vacuity,
Recalling, as it were, the feeling
That bitterly came o?er him stealing
When the rude raft was cut away,
And helpless on the ocean lay.
And yet he saw the tears I shed,
In sorrow at his tale of woe ;
? And God keep you from such,? he said,
? I would not that my bitterest foe,
Such suffering should undergo.?
The wish devout so fitly spoken,
Renewed again his story?s thread?
That temporarily had been broken?
And thus continuing, he said?
? The night closed in without a frown,


THE CAPTIVITY.
The stars from out their hidings crept.
The swell upon the sea went down,
And heavens eternal breezes slept.
There was no sound upon the sea,
Save the low rippling melody
That wavelets to each other sing,
When prone to amorous dallying ;
And the pale moon with generous light.
Flooded the brilliant brow of night ;
Leaving our lorn and helpless lot,
The only black unseemly spot,
That gave the heart or eye distress,
In such a world of loveliness.
The raft was more securely tied,
With the odd bits of rope, supplied
By brave old Ben ; and then we prayed
That heaven would send, not only aid,
But strength, to bear, whatever more
Disasters there might be in store.
Oh! Jesu ! ?twas as fervent prayer,
As ever cleaved the silent air?
As ever in the realms of grace,
All trembling sought a resting place?
As ever breathed, or soul, or sense ;
?lt was misfortunes eloquence !
And then with weariness oppressed,
Some curled themselves a-down to rest
As best they could ; those wakeful kept
A watch, whilst their companions slept,


THE CAPTIVITY.
Half hopeful that a timely sail,
Might pass within, or sight, or hail.
And thus the tedious night went past,
In weary watch and broken slumber
The first long night, but not the last.
Of miseries without a number.
Woe?s me ! the memory of them chill
The pulses of my withered heart;
And oft at night when all is still,
From sleep I give a sudden start.
Perspiring, panting with distress
As dreams restore their bitterness !
When morning dawned we reckoned o?er,
The wealth of our provision store,
On which we?d wholly to depend,
Till heaven relief or death would send.
It was so trifling and so scant ?
Scarcely enough to save from gaunt
Starvation for a week at most !
And then, and then? but that was lost-
A shudder shook each messmates frame,
At what he feared, but dared not name !
Oh, God ! it is a fearful thing,
To be adrift upon the deep,
When thoughts like those, 1 hint at, spring
Within the human heart and creep?
The feeling that the day may come ?
The last and bitter day to some ?
That others yet one chance may have.


THE CAPTIVITY.
To cheat starvation and the grave !
Days past ?long days of shine
Made fiercer by the glistening brine,
That crisped and curled its creamy crest,
And reveled in its own unrest
And dreary nights ?whose tardy feet,
Funereal marches seemed to beat
As down the path of time they stept,
To where their predecessors slept ?
Went past, affording no relief^
But added to our weight of grief;
For every eye and ever cheek,
All haggardly began to speak,
Sad stories of their baleful breath,
Fraught with the looming scourge of death.
Seven suns had dipped into the sea,
Seven nights had passed of misery,
And with the advent of the morrow,
Came greater grief and deeper sorrow.
For one we deemed the hardiest
Of all our comrades, prostrate lay ?
With eyes adroop and laboring breast,
And ? water? was the one request,
He muttered through the live-long day ;
Twas little that we had to spare,
But still we gave him more than share ?
The luxury of a moistened rag?
And when the sun advanced in power,
We made ah awning with a bag,


THE CAPTIVITY,
To shield him in his stricken honr.
And as he lay ?twas sad to see,
Such deep ?such silent agony.
For never a complaining tone,
His parched and fevered lips let fall;
Or if at times a feeble moan
Escaped, ?twas heard and that was all;
And even when the hours advanced
And brought delirium to his brain,
His mental vision only glanced
Backwards to boyhood?s years again
And all his ravings were of home,
Of joys o?ershadowed by its dome ?
01 early sports and youthful glee?
Of laughter, mirth and melody ?
Of holding with his widowed mother,
Some cherished sister, or some brother.
Such conVerse as hath ojily birth,
Beside the family sacred hearth ;
And often too there tripping came,
Upon his tongue a fair one?s name,
To whom all wandering address,
Was linked to words of tenderness ?
Words that alas ! were never meant
To be so vainly, idly spent.
And yet, perhaps it was as well,
They made us feel he knew no pain ;
But wherefore on his sorrows dwell ?
He ne?er recovered sense again,


THE CAPTIVITY.
But gradually weaker grew ;
And when the trembling rays were flung,
Of even o?er the world of blue,
He died with love upon his tongue !
And as he lay all stiff and stark,
The day scarce blended with the dark,
Some mutterings of hateful sound,
Some looks that boded more than ill,
Amongst the wretched men were found,
That made my- very blood run chill.
They seemed to think, but dared nor say,
Twas cheating them of lawful prey,
When Ben and I into the sea,
Dropped our dead comrade reverently !
Another night, another day,
Of weary watching passed away,
Of hunger and of thirst intense,
That maddened every human sense.
Some drinking in their agony
The bitter water of the sea,
Until their madness grew the more ;
And then by turns they prayed, and swore
Great oaths that fell upon the ear,
Like echoes from the depth of hell.
And then a penitential tear, [swell,
Their bleared and bloodshot eyes would
And sobs and meanings of dispair,
Commingled with the ocean air.
Again another night went past,


THE CAPTIVITY.
And happily to some the last,
Their wretched spirits slipped away,
Before the dawning of the day?
And when the glad sun upward rolled,
Their wasted forms lay stiff and cold,
With glassy eyes that seemed to crave
The quiet of a seaman?s grave ;
And one by one we dropped them there,
� God ! rest their souls,? our only prayer.
Without a cloud to break his power,
Without a breath to cool the air,
The sun attained his noontide hour,
And glowed*unmercifully there.
And then a stupor on us fell,
Our hearing faulty grew as well;
Our sight became as dim as stone ?
Our voices took an alteredtone?
And Hope defeated, crushed and cowed,
Her head in mute subjection bowed.
And yet with more than human might,
I strove to put despair to flight ;
I could not feel it was my doom.
To slumber in an ocean tomb?
My soul rebelled at such a thought ;
But when my fevered vision caught
The numbers that had so far striven,
And found them dwindled down to seven ;
My heart appalled its throbbing stayed,
And consciousness withdrew her aid,


THE CAPTIVITY.
As with a grasping breath I cried,
? ?Tis Yso?s vision verified !?
And like my comrades I became,
A living mortal but in name ;
My withered tongue refused to speak?
To move my limbs were all too weak ;
I turned to have no thought nor pain,
Nor fruitless working of the brain.
A lethargy came o?er me, sweet
'As suffering mortal well could meet
A kind of half completed death,
Suspended by a little breath !
How long I lay insensible,
I took no note, I cannot tell,
I felt the burning sun of heaven,
And knew thereby that it was day
I felt the chilly dews of even,
And knew that night was holding sway,
And once I thought I saw the moon,
Depending o?er a tree crowned height,
While accents of a measured tune
Came floating on the breath of night.
Oh, God ! the pleasure that they gave?
It seemed a flash of new born life ;
I strove to look out o?er the wave,
Alas ! it was a useless strife,
My feeble limbs and dizzied sight,
Sank back again into the night !
What followed must remain a blank


THE CAPTIVITY.
I found myself upon a bank
Of yielding turf, and by my side
Were savage forms as well could be ;
With glittering eyes all staring wide,
And fixed in wonderment on me.
I thought it was a dream at first?
A fevered vision of the brain ?
That out of suffering had been nursed,
To gladden and depress again
By speedy vanish ; but my ear
Caught sounds of human voices near,
?Tho strange and incognizable ?
And oh, how pleasantly they tell,
Surely the air was never broken.
By words so musically spoken !
And then I knew that I was saved,
And resting on the solid land,
And that the green trees o'er me waved,
With human beings near at hand.
What mattered that they were a race,
In whom the eye could only trace,
The lines ?the signs of savageness ?
They friended me in my distress ?_
They gave me of their daintiest things??
They gave me of their coolest springs?
They made for me a leafy bower,
To fend the sun?s oppressive power ;
And stay the dripping dews that fell
When night cast o?er the earth her spell;


THE CAPTIVITY.
And when my strength began to grow.
They told to me by mimic show,
How that at dawning they beheld
Shoreward, our crazy raft impelled,
Or what they took to be at first.
Some monster of the deep accurst ?
That when it reached the solid land,
They from a clifi projecting, scanned
Its substance with enquiring eye,
And, hesitating, ventured nigh.
They found me and ray comrades lying,
Some stiff and stark, some gasping, dying ;
And of the latter I was one,
With two that never rallying died,
What time the last rays of the sun,
Had dipped into the ocean tide ;
And one I knew was brave old Ben?
They said his hair was whiter than
The surf upon a rocky shore ?
The other?s years were scarcely more,
Than boyhoods, for his face was bare,
And like a woman?s passing fair.
They pointed to a heap of sand
New raised, and let me understand
By signs, that they were buried there.
How much I envied them that tomb.
For I was left alone to bear
The burden of my wretched doom 1


THE CAPTIVITY.
There was a peak of vasty height,
That lay a little to the right,
From where the eye could sweep the main,
Far?yond the surf that boiled and churned;
And when my strength came back again,
My steps were thither daily turned ;
And I would sit the whole day long,
And longing gaze across the throng
Of water, till my sight grew dim
With scouring the horizon?s rim.
But day by day did nightward creep
Without a speck upon the deep !
Nor was I left to watch alone,
For lurking near by shapeless stone,
Or favoring bush, I often met
A guard upon my movements set;
And when the infant moon was born,
And warblers ushered in the morn,
Much bustle in the camp I marked?
en to the very dogs that barked?
Much yabber that I did not know?
And haste and hurry to and fro;
Which, to my fancy, went to prove,
My sable friends were on the move.
I thought to stay behind, and keep
Continued watch upon the deep,
Until some sail might venture near,
To bear me from my prospect drear.
Alas ! the thought was scarcely born,


THE CAPTIVITY.
Before it from my breast was torn ;
For when they saw me loitering stay,
Some stalwart men in war array,
With gestures that bespoke command,
All ruthless seized me by the hand,
And tore me from my much loved sea,
Into a long Captivity.?


??XJclcagcu
? Ah ! me,? ?the old man thus again,
Resumed the burden of his strain,
After another pause in which
The past stept out of memory?s niche,
Revivifying and revealing
Many a long forgotten feeling?
Many a sorrow and distress,
And hour of lonely bitterness ?
? It was a long and weary trail,
Through sombre wood and tangled dale,
Round Mangrove swamps of wide extent,
Whose every breath was pestilent;
O?er lowlands dank, and uplands gay
With flowers as beautiful as heaven ;
We journeyed on our tedious way,
Nor rested in the noon-tide even.
God ! how I felt the cruel heat,
And how the earth assailed my feet;
And how I longed and often sought,
To rest me in some shady spot ;
But aye my swarthy friendly-foes,
With bitter words, and threatened blows,
Compelled me on the move to be
Regardless of my misery.
At last, despite of threat or frown,


THE RELEASE.
My sufferings fairly forced me down,
Groaning beneath the friendly shade,
That by a Leichardt-tree was made ;
I knew no words that could entreat
Their sympathy, but to my feet
All red with gore, and scarred and torn,
By jagged flint and cruel thorn,
I pointed with a look forlorn ;
And strove by signs to let them know,
Another step I could not go.
Some mocked, but others in whose breast.
Sweet pity like a gem was set,
Contrived a litter for my rest,
And thus my sore affliction met- -
(In fashion ?twas extremely rude,
Two poles and transverse slips of wood,
Lashed with a rushy kind of grass,
Plucked from a neighboring morass) ?
And I was laid upon it then,
And borne along by stalwart men,
Until the sun began to seek
The tree-tops of the mountain peak,
Whose shadows gradually fell
Over the wide expanse of dell;
And then our journey seemed to end,
For round a narrow runlets bend,
Whose waters stole along unseen ?
So rank the vegetation grew ?
The site where many a camp had been.
Burst suddenly upon the view !


THE RELEASE.
It was a wild secluded spot,
As silent as the land of thought;
Save when the bell-bird broke the charm
With ringing note of feigned alarm?
Or full-toned warbled roundelay,
Awoke or closed the eye of day ;
And from the bleached bones scattered round
I knew it was a hunting ground.
A score of fires were quickly laid,
And temporary gunyah?s made ;
And by the time that night closed in,
Had come the last o?erburdened gin,
With something almost like a smile,
Bejoicing at her ended toil!
What need to linger ? days went past,
And each one richer than the last.
In hunting gifts, and I grew strong
From rest and food so showered around ;
I felt my pulses bound along,
With something of their olden bound ;
And, but that every step I took,
Was followed by the hateful look
Of eyes suspicion-tinged and keen ?
I almost could have happy been ;
For I had schooled my heart to bear,
The burden of my lonely grief,
Till holy heaven thought fit to care
For my distress, and send relief.
And ?twas a raveled mystery ?


THE RE LE AS E.
Its key I strove in vain to find?
What cause my captors had to be,
At once so cruel, and so kind ;
They watched me with suspicious eye,
From dawning till the night closed in?-
They brought me every luxury,
That earth could yield or spear could win.
Perhaps ?may God forgive this thought,
That sometimes through my brain would
By feasting me they only thought, $ [steal
To fit me for some hellish meal!
And as it rankled deep and sore,
I cursed the day I reached the shore.
The days, I think, had numberedften?
For of them I kept then ?
And noontide?s shortened "shadows fell
From flowering shrubs and stately trees ;
And birds agape had ceased to well,
Aloud their mirthful melodies ;
And silence in the camp obtained,
Unless when childrens laughter broke it,
Like that which erst in Eden reigned,
Ere Abel?s dying groans awoke it !
For at the dawn, all who could wield
A spear, had sought the hunting field.
Save one o?er me a watch to keep ?
And even he was half asleep,
As were the grey-beards and their charge?
When from the neighboring thicket?s marge,


THE RELEASE.
One low whoop rang, and ere it died
A stranger band was at our side,
With spears uplift prepared to kill
Whoever might dispute their will.
The old men trembled at the sight,
The women shrieked as did the young;
My coward guard he took to flight?
But a swift spear unerring flung,
Soon stayed his progress ; then they seized,
Without a word in fashion rude, \
On any women that they pleased.
And dragged them far into the wood,
Leaving us speechless at their daring,
So sudden, skillful and unsparing.
It was the silence of suprise,
But when it had relaxed its spell,
The slumbering hills and peaceful skies,
Were startled by a dismal yell,
To which, before its echoes died,
Dimly a score of throats replied.
Not long before the hunters feet
Were hurrying homewards heard to beat,
For the sad unexpected yell,
Portentious on their hearing fell;
And when they saw their rifled camp,
And the prone form on whom the damp
Of death had hardly yet grown chill,
Their horror at the deed of ill


THE RELEASE.
Broke forth in lamentations long,
And vows revengeful for the wrong.
Alas ! they were but idle vows,
For ere the war-paint was applied,
Stealthily sneaking through the boughs.
The foemen were again espied ;
And when the fresh alarm was given,
Sprang out, no paltry six or seven,
But something like a score twice told
Of warriors, paint-begrimmed and bold.
From the first pitiful success,
That marked their murderous cunningness.
Sharp was the onset 1 fierce the strife !
Whirred through the air the boomerang,
Like a revolving two-edged knife,
And every spear a requiem sang 1
And when the conflict closer grew,
Many a skull the clubs crashed through
With a peculiar sickening thud,
Until they streamed again with blood!
There was no quarter given or sought,
Each hero to the latest fought,
As if some grudge of ancient date
Bankled the breast with deathless hate ;
And even as the vanquished fell,
Defiance was their latest yell!
But what by valor can be done,
When foemen number two to one,
Advantaged by matured address,


45
THE RELEASE.
And backed by warlike readiness ?
The conflict closed, but not until
There was not left a male to kill ;
Unto the last the latest fought,
And dearly was his death blow bought ;
For, round him stretched was many a brave
Fitted to fill like him a grave !
And when our cruel foemen failed
To steep their hands in living gore,
The prostrate dead they next assailed,
And carved and mangled them full sore 1
Ah ! me, it was a hellish sight?
Never was such inveterate spite?
Nor wonder is it, I should feel
A sickening horror o?er me steal.
Until, at last, I swooned away ?
How long insensible I lay,
What cruelties were perpetrated?
Before their thirst for blood was sated,
I cannot tell; I only know
I woke surrounded by the glow
Of other fires than those I knew,
And stranger forms and faces too;
And mingling with their muttered tones,
Were the subdued and sorrowing moans
Of helpless women captive made ;
And thinking on their wretched lot,
So lopped of every human aid,
My own distress was half forgot ;


THE RELEASE.
Nor did I realize its weight
Until my re-awakened state,
Was noted by the watchful eye
Of one who sat ray feet a-nigh,
With aspect fierce and figure nude,
Like a dark demon of the wood.
He seized his club, and raised his arm,
And made an understood alarm,
That in the whistling of a spear,
Summoned around a host severe ;
That filled me with unspoken fear??
For every eye "was fixed on me
With withering intensity;
And when some bolder then the rest,
To speak to me, themselves addressed,
I understood no word they said ?
I only shook a silent head.
For ?twas a language all unknown,
Of wild and unfamiliar tone.
They felt my skin where it was bare ?
?Twas little then I had to wear ?
And with a wetted finger strove,
Its whitened texture to remove ;
They pinched me till I almost yelled?
They handled me till I rebelled ?
Begardless what the cost might be,
Of such mistimed temerity ?
And well I did, it made them feel,
They had no slave with whom to deal,


THE RELEASE.
But one through whose pulsations van,
The pride and majesty of man !
And then, as if to calm the scorn,
That purpling flushed and fired mine eye,
They gave me food, and seemed to mourn,
Abashed their late discourtesy.
And as I ate they danced around,
In very wonderment and glee,
As if some marvel had been found,
That pleasured them exceedingly.
I almost laughed, altho : I had
But little spirit so to do,
To see them capering like mad,
And grinning and grimacing too.
But when the morning star uprist,
Above the mountains shroud of mist;
And the first footsteps of the breeze
Disturbed the slumbers of the trees-
And the blithe birds with matin lay,
Welcomed the advent of the day,
A sudden change came over all?
-?Was heard what seemed the leaders call,
To strike the camp, for at its sound
Each roof was levelled with the ground.
And burdened with their weapons keen,
Of mortal strife the warriors stood,
Erect and still, and haught of mien,
Prepared to penetrate the wood ?
That darkling limited the glance ?


THE RELEASE.
At the first signal to advance.
Nor was it long before ?twas given,
And midway in the warlike train ;
The captive girls and I were driven,
O?er many a weary hill and plain,
Until the day began to wane ;
And slender wreaths of smoke were seen
To issue from a deep ravine,
Co-mingling with the domes dark blue,
That closed the gazers upward view.
It was our captors home, and when
They rested in its shade again,
Not long before to willing ears,
Was told the triumph of their spears?
The look defiant and the yell,
Of every victim as he fell ?
The shrieks that every death-blow wrung
From terror-stricken women?s tongue ?
The helpless struggles of the dying,
When butchery its art was plying,
And last of all, but not the least,
The horrors of the nameless feast,
That followed when the strife had ceased !
And then, as if the grief to stem,
That victory even brought to them ?
For there were weeping widows there,
And children reft of father care,
And maidens that might wait in vain,
For lovers to come back again?


THE RELEASE.
The captives were exhibited,
With much of boasting and parade.
And of the bitter tears they shed
A cruel mockery was made.
Yet that was nothing to the fate.
Awaiting each unfortunate?
For deeper wrongs you might espy,
Lurking in every lustful eye,
O?er which the night-hours as they crept,
In silence and in sorrow wept!
But towards me they scarcely knew,
What line of conduct to pursue ;
Each act to which their fancy led,
Was balanced by a kind of dread, [birth
That stayed their hands and checked the
Of outrage and of ribald mirth ;
The pluck with which I foiled the first
Advances of their nameless thirst?
Still filled them with the fear, that I
Was some avenging deity.
But waiting for the fated hour
To rouse me and reveal my power !
And when betimes they weary grew,
Of having me exposed to view,
They led me to a place of rest,
And gave to me of food their best.
Days past, and I began to be
Resigned to my captivity.


THE RELEASE.
And tho? escape?s vain hope would cling,
And fret and agitate my brain :
I felt that time alone could bring,
My life of freedom back again ;
Like those around me, I became ?
What it would not be wrong to name
A savage?for my wardrobe grew
Unchristian-like, and scanty too ;
And when its wealth consisted solely,
Of one poor garment soiled and holey,
It roused the envy of the man
That seemed the chieftan of the clan ;
In vain I strove to let him know
It was not worth the battle blow,
That surely would be felt and given,
Ere from my shoulders it was riven?
I did not tell him why ?twas so ?
Enough I thought for me to know ;
It screened what well might make me brave,
The parting gift that Yso gave I
He only mocked me as I spake ?
And eyed me as a tiger snake,
The' bull-frog or the field-mouse eyes,
That powerless sinks and trembling dies ;
But when he found that I could brook,
Unawed the terror of his look ;
Without another wavering note
He sprang and seized me by the throat ?
And, breast to breast in deadly hold,
Together to the ground we rolled !


THE RELEASE.
Not long, alas ! ere I?d to mourn,
The garment from my shoulders torn,
For oeing the weaker of the two,
What could my best resistance do ?
And hardly had his victory,
Beceived the tribes applauding yell,
Before his red and wrathful eye,
Noted the gift of Ysobel!
Oh, God ! I knew at once the thought,
That lurked beneath its cruel glare ;
And instantly my spirit caught,
The maddened valor of despair !
One bound I made and seized a spear,
That stood as if to tempt me near,
And ? nought but death alone,? I cried
? Can tear this treasured gift from me.
And spear to spear let fate decide,
Which of us two shall victor be.?
He laughed, a fiendish laugh, and then
Bushed furiously at me again ;
Believing that my want of skill
Would stay ray hands from working ill ;
And that I would not fail to fling,
Without an aim the barbed thing ;
But there he, erring, little knew,
That I could practice cunning too ?
For calmly waiting his advance,
I used the weapon as a lance,
And with one well directed thrust.


THE RELEASE.
Brought his proud bearing to the dust;
And scarce a sound escaped his lips,
As closed his eyes in death?s eclipse !
Appalled his clan and kinsman stood,
And eyed me with a trembling fear,
As the earth drank his reeking blood?
For he was deemed by far and near,
Invincible to mortal spear ;
And being vanquished thus by me,
They took me for some deity,
Whose ire?whose skill in battle bout.
?Twere wrong to rouse, and vain to doubt!
Nor did they mourn their hero long,
For scarcely had the funeral song,
Revealed the burden of their grief,
Before I was acknowledged chief,
With only one provision, free?
?Departure was denied to me !
Ah ! then a dreary blank began?
I grew to be a hopeless man ?
As days, and moons, and seasons cast
Their thickening shadows o?er the past,
For what to me was chieftdoms awe ?
Or that my every word was law ?
Or that for me on every hill,
Was exercised the hunters' skill ?
Or that with one consenting voice,
I had of maids to wife the choice ?
-T was alone, without a friend,


THE RELEASE.
That to my griefs an ear could lend;
Elected?maugre my own will?
A chieftan, but a captive still!
AVliat need to linger o?er my tale ?
Oh, tongue would tire, and words would fail
To tell of all the bloody raids,
The rifled camps?the ravished maids,
That I have been a witness to?
Altho unwillingly, ?tis true?
Until my eye undimmed could see,
The savagest atrocity ;
And the last lingering Christian spark,
Expired midst hellish deeds and dark ;
And nature by surroundings taught,
The spirit of the savage caught,
Until it coloured every thought!
Enough that long long years went past,
?Till memory forgot at last,
The language that my youth-hood knew,
And all its aspirations high ;
Its friendships and affections true,
Its wish to live?its fear to die' ;
And even the dream of love that filled
Its brightest moments, fled me, chilled.
And left me like a blighted tree,
A prey to dull inanity !
And when at last some huntsmen came,
t And told of creatures they had met?
L nseen before?unknown their name?


THE RELEASE.
- Beside a neighbouring riverlet,
In number like the trees that grew?
In form most terrible to view? [crowned.
Their heads with threatening weapons
And feet that seemed to shake the ground ;
And voice?was never heard such sound ?
It filled the valley until fain
They stopt their ears from very pain
Not gladness nor regret was mine.
To tell them ?twas a herd of kine ;
And that the whiteman was at hand
To occupy their wasting land :
And alter each familiar scene,
Where long I had their captive been,
And that so sure as shone the sun,
Their lease from nature held was run ?
For interest was lost to me
In life?s remaining lottery.
I was released ?what need of more ?
? What cheer V that was the only store
Of words that I could bring to mind,
When rescued by my fellow kind ;
And months? elapsed ere words I found,
To tell the tale I?ve told to you,
Which, tho? incredible in sound,
Is like a death-wail sadly true.
