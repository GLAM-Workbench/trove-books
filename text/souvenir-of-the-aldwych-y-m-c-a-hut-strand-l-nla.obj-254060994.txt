HE ALDWYCH Y.M.C.A. HUT was opened for business on
1st June, 1916, under the
Presidency of Lady PI.UMER j Chairman, Baron Profumo ; Organising Secretary,
Mr. A. J. Green.
It was formally declared open on 23rd June, 1916, by HER MAJESTY
QUEEN ALEXANDRA, before a distinguished company, including Mr. Andrew Fisher,
High Commissioner for Australia, and Sir George Perley, High Commissioner for Canada.
Originally opened with 60 cubicle beds, the demand was so great that kitchens had
to be extended, and as many as 60 additional beds (camp beds and shakedowns) had to be
provided, principally at week ends, therefore another block of cubicles was built; still
later, two dormitories were added, and all cubicles were made into single rooms, this giving
a total sleeping accommodation of 186.
The Hut is under the regis of the English Y.M.C.A. Council, the Australian Council
making use of the Aldwych Hut as a Social Centre during the Winter and Spring of 1916-17,
afterwards moving to the Aldwych Theatre. During one month over 9,000 letters and
postcards were written and posted in the Hut, over 5,500 beds let, nearly 3,000 kits taken
into the cloakroom, and about 50,000 meals served.
The Social side of the activities of the Aldwych Hut has always been prominent.
Drives and Walking Parties across London, Theatre Parties, and Concerts at the Hut, with
an Enquiry Counter, where information may be obtained upon an infinite variety of subjects,
being the most prominent features of this side of the work.
