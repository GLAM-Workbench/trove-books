POCKET ALMANACK
AND COLONIAL
REMEMBRANCER
1806
Facsimile Edition


THIS little volume, the first almanac
to be published in Australia and only
the second printed book, was pro-
duced by George Howe the printer
of the Sydney Gazette and came out
in sections as paper was available
from January to May 1806. Besides
the usual almanac information on
moon and tides, on royal and relig-
ious anniversaries, on gardening and
agriculture in the new environment,
it contains also chronologies of local
events and shipping movements and
a digest index to the governors’
ordinances. It is here reproduced in
facsimile under the William Dixson
Foundation.

THE WILLIAM DIXSON FOUNDATION
sir william dixson was born in Sydney on 18th April 1870. He
devoted most of his life to collecting Australiana and in 1929 he
gave to the Trustees of the Public Library of New South Wales a
large and valuable collection of historical pictures of Australian and
Pacific interest. He subsequently added to this and, in addition, he
gave endowments of money. In recognition of these and other
benefactions he was knighted in 1939.
At his death on 17th August 1952 Sir William Dixson
bequeathed to the Trustees of the Public Library of New South
Wales the remainder of his great collection, together with large
capital investments to form the William Dixson Foundation. By
the terms of his will the income of the Foundation is to be applied
at the Trustees’ discretion principally in or toward the following
objects:
(a) the printing in modern type or reproduction by photo-
graphy of historical manuscripts relating to Australasia
and the Pacific in order that such manuscripts may be
made available to students and others;
( b) the translation from foreign languages into English of
manuscript books and documents relating to Australasia
and the Pacific;
(c) the reprinting of books and documents relating to
Australasia and the Pacific which have become so
scarce that they are not available to students or the
handling of the originals of which is deemed by the
Trustees to be inadvisable.
This book has been printed in accordance with these objects.

Principal Librarian and Secretary


NOTE
this book was the first almanac to be published in Australia. It
was compiled, printed and published by George Howe, the printer
of the Sydney Gazette, and such knowledge as we have of its
preparation is from that publication. The Almanack was an-
nounced in the Gazette of 20th October and 3rd November 1805
as to be published on Ist January 1806. Because of an acute
shortage of paper the edition was to supply subscribers only, and
these at first were even asked to contribute their own paper. An
advertisement of sth January 1806 explained that only the first
part as far as p. 36 was published on Ist January. The remainder
was “now in hand, and will be so executed as to be sewed in with
the part already delivered, with every possible despatch”. Delay in
completing this part was explained on 16th February 1806 as
due to a shortage of paper now overcome, and on 4th and 11 th
May 1806 the part was announced to have been completed and
delivered to subscribers. No issue was published for 1807.
Of the four copies in the Public Library of New South
Wales, the best preserved is one in the Dixson Library once
belonging to Mrs. Governor King and bearing her autograph.
Still in its original covers, it consists of a title page with text on
its verso, followed by pp. 1-52, 57-58. The gap seems due only
to an error in the numbering sequence, and the text appears
complete at that point. The end of the Observations on Gardening
was printed on one side only of an extra leaf without pagination.
This is not in the King copy, and is variously placed in two others.
The present facsimile is taken from the King copy, with the
extra leaf reproduced in its logical position from a copy in the
Mitchell Librarv.

ardfmvo. —I’oiaincs fltould now be planted, both
* in the garden and field, for a general ciop for the
winter ccniwpntion ; tins is the belt (eafan of the year
for planting this valuable root, as thefe potatoes will
co.lie into u:c in the middle of winter and beginning of
fpring. wlien cabbages, turnips, &c. gcncran/ run to
feed : Idry wheat ftubblc, where the land is light, or
new ground is the belt to plant them in ; 1 lie fc.s
fliould be the produce of the preceding winter crop ;
and w hen planted fhauld have a covering of light ma-
nure ; for if thev he planted without dung they v. ill
g reatly impoverish the ground : but if manured, be of
very chential fcrvice to it. —Currets mar alio be fotvn
this month for a general crop ; the nrouitti fhr.uld be dug
very deep, and broke vert fine. U the giotmd is light,
fotv the feed in a calm dav, and tread it in. Carrots
m.av no lawn fur table we at (eveial feafon.s of the year ;
a ?n J


and T.cttuccs. Rcdiflts, and fmrdl Sc.Uad for a conflant
lupply, may be fovtn every month.
.Ar-.Tticvi.TUßE. —The farmer (honlc! now be diligent
in cleaning his Ivlotzc. end breaking up the ground he
i'/irin's tu fow with Wheat ar d Btir/.-y. E:rpei ier.ee has
fbcvn: that no certain n op can he pioduccd il the ground
i> not ploughed or broken up two or three months be-
fore feed time. The longer it is e:\pofcd to the influence
<-.; the inn and air, the better it will be prepared for the
reception of the feed, as the fummer heat will tend to
hi. I ,' the words, meliorate the foil, and give the fanner a
greater probability of reaping the reward cf Ids toils.
Should he net. I eel to plough or hoe his ground till rear
('end time, the weeds will overrun it, ami greatly impo-
vt-riih the lend ; their ccflrndion will be much mere la-
borious and difficult ; and, fhonld the autumn prove wet,
then may prevent him from fovving the ground he in-
tended.
Snrr.p.—ln the beriming of this month the Ram
fliould he font to the eld Ewe Flocks, in order that they
nwv hrirr forth in winter. Winter lambs will always
he found much ftrorger and hardier ihecp than tbofc
lambed in fummer ; they will alfo be ready to wean the
latter end of Auguft or the beginning of September,
w hen the frrintr will aflord them plenty of grals; fo that
ti e young lambs will feel no check when taken from
it e mother. Young ewes lambed lafl May and June
fnnuld be felecled into a feparate flock, and kept from
the ram til! March; if they are fu the red to remain with
the flock, many of them will Ir.n.b in June, at the time
the old cues do. Young ewes generally rear their firfh
lambs with diiliculty ; on that account they fbould net
Janv* before fpiirg, when.the weather is warmer, and the
grafs better.
FEERUASi.
AttnFwivr, —fJiv.und fhculd now be prepared for
'- 3r Ctl-bngti and 1-ur; dj-s jat the latter end of the month
fhouiei


(hould there be any gentle (bowers Come turnips may
be (own. Cabbages mav be (own cvcrv three months
for a conftant fnpnlv ; all forts of five a- herbs Ibonbi be
dipt this month, 'trees of every hind fliould now be bud-
ded, bur the tops of the budded (lochs (hould not be cut
off till September following ; when fuch burls as look
well will make vigorous (hoots. Peaches may be budded
upon their own (locks, or upon plumbs, almonds, or apri-
cots. The Englift) Alulhcrry upon the cherry or Cape;
but thev will take better upon the former. Oranges
will fucceed well upon lemons. It is better to bud all
tendei trees in fummtr, than to graft them in fpring.
Agriculture.— Thofc farmers who intend to fow
turnips for (beep (hould now manure and prepare their
land ; turnip ground (hould be cleared from all weeds
and brought by digging or ploughing and harrowing into
the bed (late for cultivation. This is alio the proper icafon
for (owing winter barley, he:e commonly called Cape
barley, as green fcod for hcrics, cows, (liccp, and bogs,
]t will be ready for feeding in the beginning of April or
feoner; ore acre of winter barley will yield an incitdillc
quantity of green food, which may either be mowed and
gisen to cattle, or fed off with any kind of dock ; it will
continue in cor.flant vegetation, whether cut or fed, for
three or four months.—This is alfo the bed month to
prepare the ground for wheat by ploughing or breaking
it up with the hoe. When the ground is turned over in
dry hot weather, the weeds ate cafily dedroyed—an im-
portant objedf the experienced fainter never lofes light
of.—Gicu-.d (hculd aluavs if pcdiblc be turned up in
diy weather, tokill the weeds.

MARCH.
Z" 1 AR deicing. —This is the proper feafon for planting
Strauhirrits, all the limners and leaves fliould b e
cut clcfc off htfere pluming, as this will drengthen
hem greatly, arid they will get new leaves before the
winter ; they may either be kept in clumps, or fuffersd
to run


to run over the beds : by the former method they will
gio.v to a larger fize, but by the latter they arc lefs apt
to contract filth. As foon as the ftrawberrics are cut
ant! planted, a fprinklingof frefh earth fhould be thrown
over the beds ; and when the weather is dry they
fhould be plentifully watered two or three times a week.
Strawberries require much air, and ought theiefore to
be thinned in order to a free circulation. [When (owed
in beds, the method found belt to I'uccee l is the follow•
ing ; When the bet! is well prepared, plant the rows for
the larged kinds (inch as arc the Chilis and Carolinai)
two feet afunder. all<> allowing one foot between each
plant in the fame row. The (mailer kinds do no;: re-
quire to be kept fo far R-part ; fo that 18 inches between
the row. and 8 from plant to plant will be generally
fiifilcicnt]. —Tills is Hkewifc a proper fcafon for fowlng
Omens for immediate ide ; but for a general crop they
Ihould not be fovvn till the latter end of April or be-
ginning of Mav, as they will run too much to feed if
the fcafon fr.ould be favourable.—The Fruit 'Jrees
fhould now be examinee, and all the branches broken
by the fruit lopped off, as well as dead limbs. Peach
trees in particular will require a deal of trimming, as
many cf their limbs will be broken down.
Agricm.ture.— From the middle of this month to
the end at April all forclt land diou!d he fown witn
ft heat. As the late Maize is not ripe enough to gather
in .March, fome farmers low their wheat among the
{landing maize : this is very bad hufbandry, and ruinous
to the farmer; It would be much more to his i mere ft
to let his maize tland until it is ripe ; then clean and
prepare his ground for the next fcafon, and only low
fucli land with wheat as is ready and well prepared.—
7 urr.ips fr.ould be fovvn for a general crop the firfl week
in this month., (hould the weather admit, and (hey will
be readv to give to the fhecn in the bepir.nins: of May :
a 1 O t> .1
One pound of feed is fufficicnt fer an acre. During the
time of their growth they will want hccirg twice or
three lime.-, to thin them and keep them clean.— V.v;--


nips fhoitld be fownfor a general crop the fir ft week in
tliis month, fhould the weather admit, and they will he
read)' to give to the fheep the beginning of .Viay ; Inc
pound of feed is fulf.cicnt for an acre; during the time of
their grovvih thev will want hoeing twice or three times
to thin them, and keep them clean.—Turnips for do-
medic ufc may be Town at any time between March and
September.
Skf.f.p.—The ram fhould be put to the your; ewe
flock this month ; one not more than iS months old
would be better than an older inm.
OOt>»>-
JPRIL.
C Gardening. —Afparagus haulm fhould now he cut
1 down within two inches of the bed, and carried off
the ground : all the weeds arc to be cut up with a lharp
hoe ; th.cn feme good rotten dung mull be fpread over the
beds, and laid in equal thicknefs on every part ; the alleys
dug one fpadc deep, and the earth fpread upon the whole.
The feed of fmeli fallud may alfo be fown now —onions
nay be Town this month for agcncial crop,and cabbage
feed, lettuces, See.
Agriculture. —The farmers fettled upon the banks
of the Hawkefbury and Nepean fhould cenfidcr, that
from the mideleof April tot lie end of May is their hell
feafon for Towing H'hiat. Early Town wheat generally
yields better, is a much more certain crop, and not To
fubject to the caterpillar, friut, rud, ana blight, to which
late wheat is always liable. Forward wheat is tco near
maturity to be much injured in the beginning of No-
vember, when the dole hot fultry weather with fcarcc a
breath of air fets in, the feafon tire caterpillar, finut, mil,
and bi-ght mofl prevail. 'Eire farmer fhould guard as
much as pofnblc againfl every danger to which his crop
is cvpofed while in the field ; ai d the befl precaution is
early sowing.-— Outs may now be Town for a general crop ;
three bulhel? m e fullicier.t for an acre. Pca-s and hearts
mav likcwite bs fown in the field.
•2. May


MAY.
f~* ARDENtNG. — SmaII fallad herbs may be fown all
this month for a conflant fupply : about the end of
this month the leaves of artichokes fliould be cut down,
and the plants carthca up. —Omens may alfo he fown on
rich land for a general crop, if the weather is moift.
All kinds of fruit trees , excepting crer-grcens, fliould
now be pruned ; and fuch branches as are cut off fliould
be taken dole to the tree, that the wounded part may
foon heal, which will prevent the wet irom injuring the
tree.
Agriculture. —The farmer is to continue to fow
Wheat all this month as before dircdled, and to finifli
(owing before June ; fpring barley fliould alfo be fown
at this feafon upon all foreft lard : Three bulhels of bar-
ley is luflicient for an acre, or two and a half if well
cleaned.
Sheep.— The ewes that were put to the ram laft Ja-
nuary will begin to drop their lambs towards the end
of this month ; thofe that are weak thro’ age or poverty
fliould have a few turnips given to them a fortnight or
three weeks before they lamb, which will greatly aflift
them and enable them to bring up their lambs. If they
have no turnips or fome other fubftitute many of them
will die, the nights being long, and the grafs bad in the
woods at this feafon. Ewes that are in good condition
will want no more than common carebcforc they lamb.
——j~
JUNE.
AR dikin'G.— This is the proper feafon for tranfplan-
ting all kinds of fruit trees, except ever greens,
(horten the roots, and tri m them ; the roots of a tree when
planted fliould fpread Jikc a man’s open hand, and fhould
not be put more than three inches below the common
furface. When the hole is filled up let the earth be gen-
tW trodden r tm! the plant. Layers may be made, and
cuaings planted from hardy trees.
Agricul-


Agriculture. — Spring Barley fhouidbe Town this
month upon all rich land ; the ground muft be made fine
by ploughing, harrowing, and rolling before it is fown.
Barley is a tender plant, and will not bear fowing upon
rough ground, bccaufe it would be buried too deep when
harrowed in, which will prevent its coming up: three
bufhels of feed per acre will be fufHcient, or two and a
half if well cleaned.
Sheep. —This will be the principal lambing feafon »
Evres and lambs will now require the conftant care of
the fhepherd ; and it will be prudent in the fheep farmer
to put all tre ewes into one flock as they drop their
lambs, under the care of an attentive man; Let them be
fed twice a day with turnips, till the lambs get ftrong
and able to follow the other flock, as it is a great injury
to young lambs to drive them into the woods with the
ftrong flock for the firft ten days. Thofc who wifh to
preferve their lambs and ewes, muft fpare no expence,
cfpecially if the weather be wet, ftormy, and cold.
.Much may be done for their welfare in the fevereft
feafons by man’s care; for fhcep arc fo delicate, that
they will not do well withont afliftancc from Man.
JULY.
ARDENiNG. —Fruit Trees that were not tranfplanted
laft month muft now be removed. —StocJts to bud
and graft upon muft now be tranfplanted. —Cabbage feed
may now be fown for table ufe in fpring.—Ground
muft now be prepared for a general crop of Potatees,
both in the garden and field, —Garrets maj alfobe fown:
they will thrive heft in an open fituation, and upon light
fantiy ground, well dug. —Strawberries fhould now be
cleaned, and have their fprir.g drolling: the runners
muft be cut off from the plants, and the beds cleaned
from weeds: the ground muft then be Joofened, and a
little frelh earth or fire curg laid between the rows j
this will make the plants flreng, and produce Isrge fruit.
Agricul-


Agriculture. — PstaU:s planted in January fhonld
row he dug, and laid by for ufe in fpring : They diould
be dug in cloudy weather, and bruifed as little as pof-
fiblc ; they diould not be expofed to the Cun, but laid
under cover to dry, as they will rot if dried in the fun.
Potatoes being always valuable in fpring, when other
vegetables run to feed, too much care cannot be ta-
ken of the winter crop.
Sheep —Mud be attended as in the preceding month.
/]U (.7 Jj SI .
an drNll;c .—Cucumbers and Mellons fhonld now be
'- 7 fown; anl ever greens tranfplantcd : as thofc trees
are found to be very tender, the work mud he done with
great care ; they Chou Id he carefully dug round, taken up
vi'h a ball of earth, and placed in the ground with the
ball where they arc to remain ; ever.greens will not bear
to have their roots expofed to the air like the trees that
cad their leaves. The nurlcry will now wart cleaning,
and the young trees prepaiej for grafting. The weeds
■muff now be cut down and dclbroycd, or they will give
much trouble the next month. The gardener fhonld
carefully examine all the fruit trees, cut cS' every decay-
ed branch, and open the ground about the roots of thole
trees which appear fickly and (hinted. Vines mud be
cut early this month and their cuttings planted when new
vineyards arc to be made.
Agriculture. —Pctatecs mud now he planted for a
general Cummer crop ; and the larged and fined potatoes
(hould be chofcn for feed ; very rotten manure is rot fo
good for potatoes as frcfli liable dung and old thatch : if
the ground be rich and light, the potatoes will be much
better in quality without ary dung, tho’ not fo plentiful
a crop. Turnip ground mud now be cleaned, broke up,
and prepared for grabs and clover ; and as land cannot
be made too fine for grals feed, there diouldbe no weeds
nor any large clods left. Hy repeated lolling and har-
rowing, the ground will be pul verifed, the weeds dp-
Ihoycd


froyed, and the loil prepared for the reception of the feed.
Eight pounds of Dutch clover, and two bufheis of clean
rye giais feed will be fuHiciem tor an acre.—Grouud ma/
this month alfo be ploughed for maize, as Ihis will kill
the weeds, wmch if left to grow in September will bs
very (trong, and greatly impoverilh the ground ; weeds
fhould never be fullered to ripen their feeds.
Sheep. —The young ewes that were put to the ram
in March will now begin to drop their larrbs: turnips
being nearly expended, they thould have the beft paflure
the Farmer can give them. If pofTiblc feme open ground
that as been in cultivation fhould be referved for them.
"What food tney pick up in open ground will be moie
nourilbing than the gtals in the woods and will help
them to give more milk to the lambs ; as the days are
getting longer and warmer, and the grafs better, there
will nor be much danger of their doing well if they are
attended to and fed.
SEPTEMBER.
Gardening —This is the proper feafon to graft
fruit tiecs ; the (cions which are intended for grafts
fhould be cut off a fortnight or three weeks before. Sc
the ends which are cut ftuck in the ground till f hey are
wanted for ufejthc tops of all the trees which were oud-
ded iaft February mult now be cut down within about 8
inches of the bud ; this wood above the bud is left onto
tic the young Ihoot to, that it n ay not be bioken off by
the win’d. No fhoots mull be fullered to grow but the
eye that was budded, all others mult be rubbed off asfoort
as they appear.
Agriculture. —Ground fhould now be got ready (or
planting with maize, which maybe planted with fafety
r when


when the bud cfthe F.ng’.ifb Mulberry breaks and not be-
fuie. This will (hew the Hate of the foil and atmofphere,
tod that no danger is to be apprehended (run the tioft,
maize being a tender plant that will not bear the froft.—*
Grafs or clover may be fown either in autumn or tyring t
it will be better to low them the fit ti week in this month
if the weather fce favourable, and a prolpc£l of gentle
mins; they will grow vrsii after turnips if the ground is
properly cleaned and made fine.
Sheep. —Some of the early winter lambs maybe wean-
ed the latter end of this month; they fhoukl be kept in a
flock by themfelvcs for three months, and feci upon the
befi paflurcs; the fliorg wether lambs may then be turn-
ed into the old vvethet flock, as they will be able to travel
with them ; the female iambs had better be If ill kept by
thcmfdves till March, and no ram fufiered to tome rear
them: when they will be old enough to breed: they will
then drop tl-eir iambs in Augufl, the fafeftftalonforyom g
ewes to lamb, when both tyring and warm weather arc ac
hand,
OC'JOBER.
C< AuntNiKo. —All the young trees that were grafted
1 in thebegii t ing of iaft month Ihonld now he exa-
mined, and all yrung fronts btokc off. excepting one or
tw'o, both ftotn the gratis and flocks ; the clay muft be
taken off, and the bandages loefened ; the ground between
the rows of all kinds o( vuurg trees fhould be kept clean
from weeds, or they will not the treys of their proper
nourifhment.— Ap\uoti and Patch Trees fltould now be
examined, and where the fruit is let too thkk, as will
be thecafe in favourable featous, they mufl be reduced
to a moderate quantity: (his fhouid be done with care,
arid the llruu only that is ptoper to temaiu ickdled, and
left


left upon t l ’e tree?. The tops of onions will alfo want
breaking down this month, where they are forward, to
prevent their running to feed.
Agriculture.—The farmer fliould now plant as
much of his maize this month as pofliblc, in order that
he may finifh planting before his harveft fets in ; He
Aiould alio dean and earth up his potatoes. If this work
is not done now he will not have time to attend to it
when his wheat is ripe } aud by that means his tuture
crop will be greatly injured. Maize and potatoes are fuch
vciy dier.tial articles ol food, as well as almofi certain
crops, that the farmer cannot he too anxious and diligent
in their cultivation 5 as fliould his other crops fail, thefc
will rurnillr him with the certain means of lupport tor his
family.
Sheep.—l.amb* dropped from the middle of October
to the end of December will require particular care and
attention in the proprietor. Thefc dimmer lambs will
always be found very weak and delicate { and if they
receive no more than common care, many of them will
die after weaning in March or April. They fbould be
tfafted witr better food that what the woods produce,
in order to enable them to endure the winter icafon,
which is very trying to fun met lambs, — I urr.ips and
artificial grades ate the bell food that can be given to
them 1 and where thefc cannot be obraincM the lambs
fhould have a little maize tv.icon day lot iotnc tunc after
they ate weaned.

to them, to which the fhoot mud be tier! to prevent the
wind 'ram hi caking it off.—Huddcd andgrafted trees will
want conftant attention. —All other Ihoots but (uch as
grow from the eye of the bud, or from the graft, mud oe
t?ken off, that the graft or bud may receive all the nou-
rifhmcnt the dock can afford. —Ever Greens may now be
propagated bv lavers ; layers mud only be made from the
young fboois of the fame fummer’s growth; If proper
llioots are chofen, and theft properly laid, many of them
■will be well rooted by the following March, and in a
condition to be feparared from their mother plam.—
Cabbage, Lettuce , and 'lurnips may be Town for the tile of
the tabl .
Agricult'jke.— About the middle ofthis month the
harvcftbocomes pretty general thro’ the Colony; the f. ir-
merfhoiild have his daddies and tharch ready for his flacks,
that his labourers may have nothing to anend to, but the
fccuring of the grain the moment it is ready to cut. No
wheat ought to be flacked upon the ground, as the moif-
ture which arifes from the earth afcer.ds thro’ the flack, &
tends much in this warm climate to incrcafe the weevils,
which prove very deflruoiivc to the wheat. Hefhouid be
alfo very diligent infecuring hiswheatas foon as it is rca.
dv to flack for fear of rain, for ff he trults too much to
the weather he is liable to great rift,ue: when wheat b cut
and afterwards wet with rain t ! c ftraw becomes fo very
brittle that it will not bear to be handled the fiifl warm
day, and the wheat fhells very much, from whence great
lofs arifes.
Surrp.— lf the weather be warm the farmer may be-
gin early in this month toihear his flrong fkcep ; but
fhould the feafonhe wet, it would be better to defer this
work till the weather is fine and dry. Wet is at all times
very injurious to fheep, and particularly newly fhorn.—
Lambs that were dropped in April or May, may alfo be
fhorn, but it would be pru&iUilot lolh ar them till ths
end of December.
Decent er.


Gardening. — Cauliflower, Brecsli , and Carrot Seed
may now be (own, aud the ground prepared for plant-
ing potatoes next month, Peach trees fhould be thinned
of their fruit where they arc too thick; Ever-Greens
may alfo be propagated by layers, as directed laft month.
Agriculture.— This month muff be employed prin-
cipally in getting in and fecuringthe harveft.—Many, as
foon as their wheat or barley is reaped, immediately plant
their (babble ground with maize ; this is very badhufban-
dry ; a practice that can never anfwer for any length of
time. The farmer who drives to grow one cropof wheat
and another of maize upon the fame ground in one year,
does not confute his own intcrcft ; by this mode of cul-
tivation he greatly impoverifhes his ground, puts himfelf
to an additional expence of labour, and rifques the fucccfs
of both his following crops ; the farmer plants his ftubble
ground in December. If the froft hppens for one night
in April the whole of his maize is probably dedroyed be-
fore it comes to maturity. Should no accident happen to
his cropof maize, yet it will not be fit to gather till the
proper feafon for (owing wheat is over. Many, it is true,
low their wheat on thir corn ground when full of rubbifh.
and weeds, as the feed lime is too far advanced to permit
them to prepare their ground for wheat when the maize
coir.es o(F: this cuftom tends eventually to deceive and
ruin the fannei, for this rcafon ; a farmer lelaom calcu-
lates upon the probable quantity of gram his farm may
produce, but upon the number of acres he has in cultiva-
tion ; he docs not take into bis eftimate that to acres Town
st a proper feafon, and on land in good cultivation, will
produce more than 30 (own at an improper (salon and on
1.-nd in bad uiitii alien. Upon ibis miftaken principle he
Ju ts above his income, and coat!acts debts with a falls
hope of liquidating them in liarvcd; when to his own and
his crtditoiS diiappointment his crop has failed.
Sh Et P — On the fir ft ol this in on in the Rarr.a Should be put to
the £’.vn, in order to [hair brir,|ing fort 1 that Lambs mthe latter
end of April or beginning of May, which it the hell feafon, if
in) artificial food be prepared (or the F.wes ; for as the nights
ate lonj; and cold, llicy will require (onie aflilllooe of I hi* kind.
Should the Sheep Farmer not think ir an object te prepare Turnr'ps
so dolhrr food lor r.is Ewes, the Ram (houid not be put to thej
Flock till the fi:il of March ; and hii £we» will then l»mb near-
er Spring, and fltnd » better charceof bringing up their Lambs, as
the tvcaihtr will he tiarmer, and the days getting longer.
