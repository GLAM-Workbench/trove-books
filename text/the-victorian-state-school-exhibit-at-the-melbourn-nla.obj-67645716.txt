THE VICTORIAN STATE SCHOOL EXHIBIT
AT THE
MELBOURNE INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION, 1880.
?K�)�o(S^<?
The larger building is a specimen of the style of school-room and
teacher?s residence erected in country districts, where an attend-
ance of from 50 to 75 children is expected. The cost of such
a building ranges from �4OO to �5OO, according to the district
in which it is erected. The roofs, except in localities where
shingles are easily obtained, are of galvanized corrugated iron,
and the rain-water is stored in iron tanks. In a few localities,
however, underground brick-and-cemeut tanks have been substi-
tuted ; but the great cost of making them perfectly water-tight has
hitherto prevented their use to any great extent. The Teaching
Staff in a school of this size usually consists of a head teacher, a
workmistress (who teaches sewing and elementary work), a pupil-
teacher, and unpaid monitors. The head teacher?s income is
about �l7O a year, that of the workmistress �3O, and of the
pupil-teacher from �l6 to �5O, according to attainments. The
teacher pays rent for the four rooms at the rate of �l2 per
annum.
The portable building is designed for a locality in which an
attendance of about 30 children is expected. Two rooms are
attached to the school-room for teacher?s residence, for which a
rental of �4 per annum is charged. These portable buildings
are usually erected in remote districts, and cost from �lBO to
�220 each. The materials are prepared and fitted together in
Melbourne, and are then packed and forwarded to the sites upon
which they are to be erected. They are sent out at the rate of
about three a week, and a school can thus be established within
a short time after the site is secured. In the event of the
population shifting, the buildings can be removed in sections and
re-erected.


A school of this description is conducted by one teacher,
whose income ranges from �B5 to �l4O a year. The teacher
is usually a female who has just entered the service, and who
holds simply a ? License to Teach.?
When the windows face north, east, or west, they are tinted
green to take off the glare of the sunlight from the teacher?s
eyes ; and the desks are so arranged that the light falls upon
the books of the pupils from behind. End light, at a higher
elevation than the side windows, is also provided in all school-
rooms whenever it is possible to do so. Ventilation is usually
provided at the rate of one square inch of both inlet and outlet
to every 40 cubic feet of space. In galleried class-rooms, about
half as much again is provided. The inlet is by Tobin tubes,
rising to a height of about 7 feet above the floor, or by hopper
ventilators at the same level; the outlet is by ventilators in the
ceiling.
The desks in all schools are arranged in parallel rows, the
front row on the floor, and each successive row raised a few
inches higher. The seats are attached, and underneath the desks
are shelves for holding books, slates, &c. The hat-pegs on the
walls are made of wrought-iron. The gallery is arranged with
easy steps, and the seats are fitted with sloping solid backs. The
space underneath the gallery is used for storage. The maps,
usually hung on the walls, are taken down when required, and
suspended on an easel before the children. A set of maps is
supplied to every school.
The diagonal-lined blackboard is used for teaching writing on
what is known as ? Mulhauser's System .? The purpose of the
diagonal lines is to accustom the child to preserve a uniform
slope, and the intersections are of service in teaching the relative
lengths of the parts of a letter and of small and capital letters.
Copy-books similarly ruled, together with other copy-books in
use, may be seen on the desks in the specimen buildings.
The reading cards on the walls are made use of in the same
manner as the maps, the best teachers preferring to print on the
blackboard.
The Chart of Dangerous Snakes has been compiled by
Professor McCoy, of the Melbourne University, and is intended
to point out, what is not generally known, that very few of our


snakes can inflict fatal injury. In addition, an illustrated sheet,
showing the most effective means of preventing a fatal result,
should the snake prove poisonous, is supplied to each school.
This sheet, of which a specimen may be seen in the porch, has
been prepared by the Central Board of Health. Another sheet,
also prepared by the Central Board of Health, shows the best
methods of restoring the apparently drowned.
The Chart of Insect-eating Birds has been distributed to
all State schools, so that children may learn the value of these
birds, and be taught to guard them from destruction.
Colored Charts of Domestic and Wild Animals are dis-
tributed for use in the larger Infant schools. Lessons illustrative
of all these Charts are delivered at fixed periods.
The specimens of School Time Tables show how teachers
distribute the time at their disposal. The ordinary Course of
Instruction provided for is reading, writing , arithmetic, dicta-
tion, grammar, geography, home lessons, object lessons, drill, and
needlework.
The hours fixed by law are four?two before noon and two
after noon ?and it is compulsory that the Roll be marked in the
morning and the afternoon at least two hours before dismissal.
A child not attending the full two hours is marked absent. In
practice, most schools are open at least five hours a day.
The notation or ball frame is used for teaching numbers.
The copy-books and exercise-books ranged on the desks con-
tain specimens of the work done in the various classes. School
requisites are in most cases purchased by the pupils, but may
be obtained free on application to the teacher, without any
declaration of poverty being necessary. The books exhibited are
arranged in classes, and are not to be looked upon as competitive
work amongst schools. No.distinction is made between girls? and
boys? work, either in actual teaching or in the samples shown.
The school grounds in the country are usually spacious, five
acres being obtained as a rule, and in some cases are well fenced;
the urgent want of school accommodation, however, has hitherto
prevented any great expenditure upon this item. The planting of
the school sites with shade-giving trees is encouraged as far as
the means of the Department will allow.


The photographs , drawings , and model exhibited will convey
an accurate idea of the dimensions and style of architecture of
the larger school buildings. In some of the later structures there
are class-rooms 36 ft. by 25 ft., instead of 50 ft. by 20 ft., as in
those first erected.
The extent to which State schools now dot the country is
shown on the large map of Victoria in the first room to the left.
The money spent in buildings , from Ist January 1873, when
the present Education Act came into force, up to the present
time, exceeds �1,000,000, and the present cost of its administra-
tion is about �500,000 per annum.
The instruction is purely secular. The reading-books in use
have been carefully revised, and sectarian teaching has been ex-
cluded ; but the use of the school-rooms for imparting religious
instruction after school hours may be obtained with the sanction
of the Boards of Advice and the approval of the Minister.
No fees are charged for the ordinary school course , but
teachers are permitted to charge fees, fixed by Regulation, for
teaching extra subjects, such as Latin, Greek, Euclid, Algebra, &c.
Such instruction, however, must not interfere with the teaching
of the free subjects.
The system is compulsory. Every child in the colony over
six years of age must attend some State school, or his parents
must prove he is being efficiently taught elsewhere. In default
of such proof, a fine may be inflicted on the parent or guardian.
The minimum number of days? attendances required by law
during each quarter is 30 ; and the liability to come under the
compulsory clause continues till the child is 15 years old,
unless before that age he has passed an examination up to the
? Standard of Education .? This ? Standard ? consists in being
able to ?read fluently from any ordinary book or newspaper a
passage not containing any unusual scientific or technical words;
to write neatly in small hand from dictation, with correct spelling,
a short passage containing no words of exceptional difficulty;
and to state and work sums in arithmetic up to the four com-
pound rules and reduction inclusive.?
The nature of the examination of the pupils in the higher
classes may be gathered from the sets of papers worked by pupils
at the ordinary Result examinations by the Inspectors.


The standard of attainments required for teachers, trainees,
pupil-teachers, and drawing and singing masters, may be best
understood from an inspection of the examination papers ex-
hibited.
Eight exhibitions, each of the annual value of �35, and
tenable for six years, are annually awarded to children under
15 years of age attending State schools. Specimens of the
papers set at the competitive examination for these exhibitions
are shown.
The average attendance in all Government schools in 1872
was 68,456, in 1878 it had increased to 116,608, and in 1879 to
119,259.
Night schools, which are also free, have an average attend-
ance of about 5,500.
The Education Act is administered by a responsible Minister
of the Crown, and the only local control exercised is that by
Boards of Advice, elected by ratepayers. The colony is divided
into 317 School Districts, each under a Board of Advice. The
Boards are chiefly concerned with the selection of sites, the suit-
ability of the buildings, competitive examinations of schools, and
the enforcement of the compulsory clause ; but they have also
supervision of the schools within their districts, and may report
to the Department as to their condition and management.
Corporal punishment may not be inflicted on girls, and it is
discouraged even in the case of boys. When punishment is in-
flicted, a record of it is kept in a book provided for the purpose.
Payments to teachers are made in accordance with the
following scale :

* No first assistant can receive a higher fixed salary than �220 per annum.
t Workmistresses and pupil-teachers receive no payments by way of results.
I Certificated males not less than �100.
� Certificated females not less than �80.
** Workmistresses will not be appointed to schools of which the head teachers are females.
2. Teachers employed in
the establishment of new
schools, or the organization
of existing ones, or
temporarily employed in the
place of other teachers, or otherwise specially employed, may be paid by fixed salaries only, at rates from �2 to �7 per week,
the rates
to be in each
case determined by the Minister.


In addition to their fixed salaries, payments are made to
head teachers and assistant teachers hy way of results upon
examination of their schools by an Inspector. The maximum
payment which any teacher can obtain by way of results is an
amount equal to one-half of his fixed salary.
Among the circulars on the table in the school-room will be
found some containing directions from medical authorities as to
the best methods of preventing the spread of infectious diseases.
The Office of the Department is at the Government Offices,
Treasury Gardens, and visitors requiring official information for
statistical or other purposes can obtain it on application to the
Secretary.
Information relative to the working of the Victorian System
of Instruction may also be obtained at the State School, Exhibition
Building, from the Officer in Charge.
Authority; John Ferres, Government Printer, Melbourne.
