Western Australia had a public debt of �361,000 at the end of June, 1879, the total
including a loan of 4J per cent, raised in 1879 for the construction of a railway.
The valuable forests claim the first notice, on account of their extent and the variety and
quality of their useful products. The most important portion of these is situated to the south

But on this subject it may be sufficient to quote the opinions of Baron Yon Mueller, as
given in his report on the forest resources of Western Australia. Of the spontaneous resources
he writes thus:? 44 The forest regions of extra-tropic West Australia occupy an area equal to
the whole territory of Great Britain; and it is singularly fortunate for the colony that over
this vast extent of wooded country a species of eucalyptus (the jarrah) prevails, which tor the
durability of its timber is unsurpassed by any kind of tree in any portion of the globe. Under
such circumstances the timber resources must be regarded as among the foremost in importance
throughout the wide tracts of Western Australia, even if the many other kinds of utilitarian trees
occurring in the more southern portion of that colonial territory, and the more varied sorts of
timber trees to be found within the intra-tropic regions of West Australia, were left put of consi-
deration. It is furthermore of particular advantage to the colony that its highly valuable jarrah
timber is obtainable through, at least, five degrees of geographic latitude, and this within so short
and moderate a distance of shipping places as to render it easily accessible to foreign traffic.
Again? 44 The wood has attained a world-wide celebrity ; when especially selected from hilly
localities, cut while the sap is least active, and subsequently carefully dried, it proves impervious to
the borings of the chelura, teredo, and termites. It is, therefore, in extensive demand for
jetties, piles, railway-sleepers, fence-posts, and all kinds of underground structures, and it is
equally important as one of the most durable for the planking and frames of ships. And
a^ain ?? This much can be foreseen, that E. marginata is destined to supply one of the most
lasting of hardwood timbers for a long time to come, at the least costly rate, to very many
parts of the globe.? But it is not only the jarrah which the Baron celebrates among the
timber trees of Western Australia ; for example, the karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor), sometimes
styled E. colossea on account of its huge dimensions, stems having been 44 measured pOO feet
long up to the first limb, and one particularly gigantic tree 60 feet around at the base. Ims
wood, he says, is 44 elastic and durable, and particularly sought for large planks. Again,
oleosa and others he notes for the value of the oil which can be extracted from their foliage
?It has proved the best known solvent for amber and other fossil resins, and of india-rubber,
and unique in many technologic applications.? Nor in considering the utile does he forget the
dulce, but records of one species? 44 Hardly anything more gorgeous can be imagined than the
forest of E. ficifolia about the month of February, when brilliant trusses of flowers diffuse a
rich red over the dark-green foliage of the whole landscape.? .
To the eucalypts must be added the acacias, as well for beauty as utility: A. acuminata,
for its richly-scented and coloured wood, for the cabinetmaker and turner ; A. saligna, the bark
of which contains 30 per cent, of tannic acid; and A. microbotrya, for its enormous yield of
superior gum. Of more than 150 acacias standing on record from the hitherto explored
portions of Western Australia, he states ?that the seeds of every sort would be acceptable lor
horticultural export trade, Australian acacias being always in request for European glass-
houses.? To these must be added the fragrant sandalwood (Santalum cygnorum), the banksias,
yielding beautiful wood for ornamental work, and the cypress-pines of the north, valuable for
their splendid wood and resin, and which we cannot doubt will soon be utilised for masts,
yards, spars, and decks for ship-building, as they have been for rafters, joists, and flooring
houses. Of the value and beauty of West Australian woods for useful and ornamental
purposes many examples will be found in this Exhibition. .
With respect to the acclimatisation of exotic vegetation the Baron permits but small
limitation. 44 In this respect,? he says 44 West Australia is most happily situated; its wide


territory, stretching through twenty-two degrees of latitude, admitting, in reality, of the culture
of almost every kind of utilitarian tree in existence anywhere.? And, indeed, even now the trees,
shrubs, fruits, flowers, and edible vegetables of Europe, and very many of those of Asia, Africa,
and America, are under profitable cultivation, and flourish in the gardens of the colony. ?It
would,? he concludes, ? need a volume to enumerate whatever foreign countries could con-
tribute to the wealth of West Australia, which, so far as cultural capacities are concerned,
excludes from its zones, in reality, only the Arctic and Alpine vegetable organisms, and which
can afford apt space and shelter in select spots for every palm in existence.? Of the exotic
trees now naturalised in the colony, the more important are the orange, fig, mulberry, banana,
and the vine; the cultivation of these, which some have placed among minor industries, is
capable of development to a vast extent throughout the colony, as the specimens exhibited of
the more important?-the vine and mulberry?will sufficiently attest.
The wines of West Australia have already taken prizes and obtained honourable mention,
and require only to be produced in larger quantities to ensure them a high place in the
commerce of the world.
The silk produced from the mulberry plantations will compete with any produced elsewhere.
The dryness of the climate in summer is highly favourable to the preservation of the grape,
fig, and other fruits, as well as of cotton, tobacco, and coffee, for the cultivation of which the
soil and climate of many parts of the colony are particularly well suited ; as in the north, for
sugar, rice, &c.
Of more present importance even than the forest trees are the shrubs and grasses which
grow on the extensive plains and lower ranges of hills of West Australia, over an area, the
limits of which are at present unknown, but which is every year being largely opened up for
occupation. Of these particular districts, two alone?those of the north-west coast, and the
upper valleys of the Murchison river?will afford sufficient space for all the stock that can be
put upon them for many years to come. The area of land already leased for pasture is far in
excess of the requirements of the stock upon it?viz., 24,000,000 acres to 980,000 head of all
stock, or about 25 acres per head.
For want of capital in labour and in money, the agricultural lands in the colony have been
partially neglected for the pursuits of pastoral industry; but the experience of the past year,
which has given a supply of corn far beyond the wants of the colony, proves their capability
for supplying an increased demand. The quality of the produce has already competed favour-
ably with that of the other Australian colonies, and although the agricultural lands are
generally of comparatively small area, it is a great advantage that they are scattered over its
entire surface.
Wheat may be cultivated as far north as the river Murchison, and Indian corn throughout
the colony. As hitherto breadstuffs have been largely imported, it is evident that the agricul-
tural capabilities of Western Australia may be largely developed with advantage.
There were only 45,933 acres of land under cultivation at the end of 1877, out of a total of
626,111,323 acres.
The live stock consisted, at the same date, of 33,502 horses, 54,050 cattle, and 899,494 sheep.
The pastoral districts of south-west coast of the colony are particularly adapted to dairy-
farming, and are capable of supplying its products?butter and cheese?not for the possible
wants of the colony only, but largely for exportation.
It should be noted that so well suited are the climate and its vegetable productions to the
life of domestic animals, that horses and cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and poultry, if permitted to
run wild, increase so rapidly that a special Act of the legislature has been passed to regulate
their destruction.
Sandalwood has for some years past contributed largely to the productive industry and
profit of the colony; but unless new plantations are found it cannot very long continue to do
so, as the distance which even now it has to be carried to the ports of shipment raises its
price so much as to leave no great margin of profit.
The following table will show what are the present results of the utilisation of the vegetable
products of West Australia:?

The total value of the exports of 1878 was �427,268; and during last year (1879) they
amounted to the sum of �492,707.
The exports of the colony to Great Britain consist almost entirely of wool and lead ore.
The wool exports were of the value of �146,202 in 1878. Of lead ore the exports to Great
Britain amounted to �14,890 in 1878.

The mineral wealth of West Australia is very great naturally, and may be assumed to he
distributed over its entire area, as with two exceptions (to he hereafter noted) the same geo-
logical formations are found throughout it. Hitherto only lead and copper have been raised
for exportation, and then only from one district, because that alone is sufficiently near to a port
to make it profitable to work the mines. The rocks in which tin is found in the other colonies
are, however, widely distributed in this, and quartz reefs known to contain gold invite in many
places the expenditure of capital and labour upon them. Gold, as yet, has been found by
surface-washing, in one place only (Peterwangy, on the Upper Irwin), and then not in sufficient
quantity to pay for working; but even that has not been sufficiently tested. Other minerals
will not be found wanting, of which two may be noted ?plumbago, and a brown hoematite iron-
ore of the richest quality, which abounds in many places in the colony.
In the Mines district about Northampton, and on the lower course of the Murchison river,
sufficient ores of lead and copper have been raised to show that they exist in abundance, and
under such advantageous conditions as offer every inducement to work them for a fair market.
Hitherto the cost of carriage to the place of shipment has reduced the profit to a minimum;
but the opening of the Mines railway between Geraldton and Northampton has considerably
lessened that burden. The unexpected delay in providing this means of transport, and the
expenses consequently incurred, have, however, seriously affected the mining interest; and these
operating in combination with want of sufficient capital, in some cases, and with the depression
in the price of the mineral in the general market, have proved a temporary discouragement to
this industry. The specimens of ores exhibited will satisfactorily attest the quality of those
minerals in Western Australia.
The colony also possesses abundance of rock and stone for architectural purposes, whether
granitoid, arenaceous, or cretaceous. Some of the latter may be classed with the best free-
stones; while some of the sandstones are micacious, and consequently bissile, and make
excellent paving-stones. There is also good slate; clays for brick-making and pottery are
common, as are pipe-clay and fire-clay, and ochres for pigments of various colours.
Lime is abundant, and of various qualities. Salt is found in lakes and lagoons in almost
every part of the colony, some of which requires little preparation for domestic use. Gypsum
is also found in many places.
The contents of the cabinet of rocks, fossils, and minerals exhibited, when compared with
accompanying illustrative map, will not only explain generally the geology of the colony,
but also show the distribution of mineral-bearing rocks over its surface.
Western Australia may be conveniently separated into five principal geological divisions,
viz.:?First, the central table-land ; secondly, the surrounding mountain ranges which form its
supports and buttresses; thirdly, the coast districts; fourthly, the oolitic formations of the
south-east coast; fifthly, the districts of fiords, inlets, and river valleys of the north-east.
The first is formed on a base of granitoid rocks, having superficial deposits of sandstone and
limestone upon it over its eastern area ; and when these have suffered much denudation, lakes,
some of which are of considerable extent, are found on the west. It may be safely assumed
that wherever the clays which now form the basins of these lakes have been deposited from the
disintegration of the sandstones and limestone rocks, the water is salt; but when from the
granitoid, or erupted rock, it is fresh. The same rule will be found to obtain generally
throughout the colony in reference to natural springs and artificial wells.
The granitoid masses of the second division, which surround the central table-land, are
frequently broken by elevated peaks of erupted rocks, quartz or metamorphic and schistose


having usually at their bases ranges of sandstone and limestone, and are in many places
capped with magnetic and hoematitic iron ores. These erupted rocks are apparent in the
granite floor throughout the colony. In the south-west, basalt, both columnar and amorphous,
has been erupted.
The third district that of the coast presents, like the interior table-land, superficial
deposits of aqueous rocks, which in the north-west form terraces, and in the west inferior
ranges of hills, and the disintegration of these has resulted in extensive sand plains about
u eir i/ aSeS *? south-west the granitoid masses are more largely developed, and approach
the shore, in many places forming bold, rocky headlands; but where these do not present them-
selves the coast-line is formed by a range of low hills of concretionary recent limestone. The
central portion of the south coast has, as also some portion of the west, like the interior table-
land and under the same conditions, numerous lakes; and here the loftiest elevations in the
colony present themselves in ragged ranges and detached peaks of massy quartz and schistose
rocks, culminating in the Stirling range, 3640 feet above the sea.
?^ e _ fourth district that of the oolites?has not been sufficiently examined for accurate
knowledge, but there is no doubt that the rocks are related to the greater and older formations
of that class, and that they are several hundred feet in thickness. They afford stone for all
uses, whether ornamental or structural, and present a bold escarpment of some 200 feet in
sea * This is, in regard to Western Australia, an exceptional formation.
Ihe knowledge of the fifth district that of the north-east coast of the colony?is at present
confined to the valleys of the Glenelg and Fitzroy rivers. Here also the superficial sandstones
and limestones are known to be present; but the disintegration of the trap and basalt
rocks, which prevail in the valleys, appears to have left deposits unequalled for richness in
any other part of the colony. Here also, as on the south-west coast, the running waters are
perennial.
The natural productions of the waters of West Australia, if properly utilised, would be
scarcely valuable than those of the land. The abundance of fish in the sea round her
coasts, and in the estuaries and mouths of her rivers, is so great as to appear inexhaustible.
Although less numerous than formerly, both the right and the sperm whale are still to be
found, as are seals. The dugong is plentiful from Shark?s Bay round the northern coast, as
are several species of turtle, beche-de-mer, and many other valuable fish. Crayfish are common
both in salt and fresh water ; prawns are plentiful, as also are oysters in many places. These
would afford sufficient supply for a numerous population, as well as for export, and profitable
employment for many. Already the preserving of one class of fish has been tried successfully
as will appear from the specimens exhibited. ?
The fisheries for pearl-shells and pearls are at present the most productive, and, as the
suppiy remains constant, seem likely to continue so. This is the more advantageous, as latterly
these fisheries have been carried on almost entirely by native divers. The pearl-oyster is found
from Shark s Bay northward, but those of the south are greatly inferior to those of the north
Shells to the value of were exported during the year 1879, and the total export to the
end of that year since 1867 amounted to �368,819 in value.
Guano deposited by sea-fowl, now such an important item of colonial produce, was first
discovered in, and exported from, Shark?s Bay as early as the year 1840. The exportation
from the Lacepede Islands, off the north coast, began in 1876 ; but guano is now obtained from
other localities also. Chemical analysis shows that this manure belongs to the class of
phosphate guano, and in addition to phosphate of lime, contains organic matters yielding
nitrogen ; hut it is free from oxide of iron, alumina, and carbonate of lime, and therefore takes
its place among the best phosphatic guano of commerce. The quantity exported in 1878
was valued at �66,095, and in 1879 at �54,184.
There were 78 miles of railway open for traffic at the end of 1878.
In 1876 there were 58 post-offices; and 846,075 letters were despatched and received.
The length of the telegraph lines was 1159 English miles; the length of wire being 1159
miles also. �
According to the blue book for 1875, the receipts of that year for telegrams were �2251
18s. 6d.
There were 330 ships entered inwards and outwards at Western Australian ports in 1876
averaging 154,126 tons.
The expenditure on account of volunteers during the year ending 31st December 1875
was �559 3s. 2d. ? ?
In 1875 there were 62 free schools supported by Government, with a total of 2539 scholars
of both sexes. The assisted schools received a grant of �1331 19s. 9d. from public funds in
1875. _ They numbered 21, having an average attendance of 1328 scholars.
With so small a population as Western Australia has at present, there can be no very con-
siderable manufactures ; yet colonial wine and beer are fast superseding those imported; and
for the beer, barley (the produce of the colony) is now malted. Besides those of the domesti-
cated animals, the skins of the kangaroo, wallaby, boodie, dalghite, and dugong are tanned for
use with native bark. Salt is carefully prepared by native prisoners at the Convict Establish-

merit on Rottnest Island; but much salt is used throughout the colony in its natural state
without preparation. Dried fruits, olive oil, whale, dugong, and fish oil are also prepared, of
excellent quality, but mostly for the colonial market. Yet all these and other similar indus-
trial resources ?for example, the oils of the eucalypti, as shown by Baron Yon Mueller ?are
capable of development to any required extent.
The large collection of native weapons must not be taken as evidence of any serious antagonism
on the part of the aborigines of the colony to the settlers. In the more settled districts they
are too few to be dangerous, and are, in fact, dying out; and in the outlying pastoral districts
they find their advantage in making themselves useful to the settlers as shepherds, stock-
keepers, teamsters, &c. The weapons of the natives are now somewhat difficult to obtain, and
their implements and utensils are being rapidly superseded by those of European manufacture.
On this account the collection has been made as full as possible. The textile fabrics exhibited
will show that there are indigenous plants which produce fibre suitable for many purposes, and
which, accordingly, might be utilised to much advantage.
TIMBER.
Tuart timber is extremely hard, twisted and curled in the grain. It is very valuable
where great strength is required for shipbuilding, combing of hatches, engine-bearers, framing
for railway carriages, carriage-wheels, &c. It shrinks very little in seasoning, and will not
split during the process. It has been known to be exposed over thirty years without being
affected, will resist the Teredo navalis, and it is the strongest timber known. Large-size planks
and scantling, from 20 to 40 feet long, and 2 feet wide, can be cut from this timber.
Sandalwood is largely exported to Singapore and China, and some to India, the last year?s
exports being about 4700 tons, valued at �47,000.
Raspberry-jam wood is highly scented, and adapted for manufacturing purposes. It is
beautiful hard-grained timber, and will polish equal to Spanish mahogany, being very rich in
colour, and very useful for all descriptions of furniture and fancy cabinetware. Continental
and British manufacturers ought to secure samples of this timber from the Court.
Jarrah and karri timber are largely exported from the colony. Planks, scantling, piles,
and every description, can be had all lengths and sizes. The Harbour Trust of Victoria are
now using jarrah in preference to their local timber. The principal railways, marine
works, wharves, jetties, and telegraph lines in South Australia are constructed of jarrah
and karri. Large quantities have also been exported to India, New Zealand, and the Cape.
It has been proved, from practical experience, that these timbers are impervious to the
white ant and Teredo navalis (or sea-worm); and they have been used in South Australia and
this colony from twentyffive to forty years in marine and land works without showing any
signs of decay.
Specimens from the above are now being exhibited in the Court and outside the building.
This timber is equal to English oak and Indian teak, and it is also classed at English Lloyd?s
for shipbuilding purposes for twelve years.
