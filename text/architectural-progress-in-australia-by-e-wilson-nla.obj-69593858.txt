Architectural progress m Australia
Vitruvius, in the Introduction to the sixth book of
his De Architecture tolls us that Aristippus, the Socratic
philosopher shipwrecked on the coast of Rhodes, per-
ceiving some geometrical diagrams thereon, is reported
to have exclaimed to his companions, ?Be of good
courage, I see marks of civilization.? Now it is an
admitted fact that we have progressed ; and as it is a self-
evident truism that if man progresses Art must progress
too, assuredly our most prominent marks of civilization
will be our architecturally expressed ? geometrical
diagrams.? Therefore Architecture is the province of
Australia?s advance to which we will direct attention.
For some time?for fully 50 years, we may say?our
onward movement architecturally was of the festina lente
character ; at least, that is the most complimentary way
of putting it, but then one must also think of the
obstacles in that path of progress. Firstly , we have but
to refer to the principal bar to any architectural effort ,
viz., the very nature of the earlier settlements?to make
our contention plain. The greater portion of Australia
during that period was one huge penitentiary, having all
the sombre surroundings of such and a necessarily
severe style of structure for its buildings, although
Captain Arthur Phillip enthusiastically declared to
that historic gathering, just 104 years ago, at Sydney
Cove, that they were to found in the South a
new empire after the fashion of the older northern
nations. A practical difficulty, too, in the erection of
the early edifices was met with at the outset; for while
they had as motto for their undertaking ? Thus strong
Etruria strove,? and although the seal for the infant
colony was designed to encourage enterprize (showing on
its reverse Industry welcoming a party of prisoners by
striking off their fetters, and pointing to the rewards of
labor), still, strange to say, there was seemingly no pro-
vision made for erecting places of abode. Out of that
oddly assorted pioneer band of a thousand, not half-a-
dozen knew how to use the tools of a carpenter ; there
was only one bricklayer, and not a mechanic could be
found capable of erecting an ordinary corn mill. Conse-
quently, for a long period, even building languished,
while Architecture did not exist.
The officers and marines, however, first enjoyed the use
of tents, the others having to live in caves and hollow trees.
Rough dwellings of branches and bark, bound together
and plastered over with mud, constituted their sub-
sequent shelter, and such were considered really of sub-
stantial and superior construction. That was in 1789,
It was years before a church was erected in the
colony. Barracks, penal establishments, court-houses,
etc., in the very nature of things, were naturally thought
more necessary, and these latter were shortly afterwards
started?some of them still standing.
Then, secondly , that our early settlements had naught
of the charm of aesthetic effect is little to be wondered
at, for the close of the 18th century was no Art epoch
anywhere. On the contrary, Architecture was in a semi-
moribund condition, the natural outcome of a trying
time of transition ; for while the old faiths were dying,
there was doubt as to the new. The excesses of the
Ultra-Renaissance, too, had brought about an enervated
Rococo. True, in 1788 died James Stuart, who a quarter
of a century previously had, with Revett, first
shown English-speaking people over ancient Classic
ground, and popularized the same in their work, The
Antiquities of Athens. However, after all there is no
substitute for thought, and a revival of G-recian archi-
tecture applied to modern needs was yet only artifice,
and not Art. Still, for a time it went well, because it
was new to the majority, and, in a measure, vied with the
re-habilitated but decrepid Roman in doing duty in
designs for churches and other buildings. The chief reason
why these erections were contemplated with the more
complacency arose from the fact that no ancient
ensamples of the style existed in England, and the effect
they produced on the mind was nearly equal to that
excited by the view of works possessing a perfect
originality of form. Subsequently Gothic was attempted
to be revived by Wyatt and Walpole, but did not take
at first, because the then architects were practically
ignorant of that lost art, and there were no books to
direct them even to imitate properly. So the copying
style in this case was not satisfactory, because its
products lacked that venerable and correct character
which age gave to the extant examples scattered in such
profusion all over the Kingdom.
Thus, unfortunately, Archi ecture progressed but
slowly in Australia, hampered as it was by the con-
ditions of convictism aforesaid, fettered by tradition, and
paralysed by precedent with a semi-military mannerism
in the mode of building generally. At the best, the
accumulated wealth of the period found its only outlet in
extended commerce, and until the middle of the present
century mediocrity was stamped on nearly every build-
ing, either public or private. At this time, when things
seemed at their worst, the juncture of Artistic feeling
witli adequate funds for carrying out the same occurred,
and was brought about by a remarkable and eventful
epoch inaugurated almost simultaneously in both hemis-
pheres. This is represented by the Great International
Exhibition of 1851 in London, and by the discovery of gold
in New South Wales and Victoria at about the same
time. Thence transpired an era of re-vitalized energy in
English architecture. First of all, for that gorgeous
world?s fair a building of great ingenuity was designed
?Paxton?s glittering Palace of Crystal, which was the
beginning of the modern treatment of glass and iron?a
new departure that as yet, however, has not fulfilled all
expectations. Next, the accrued knowledge of what
tout le monde had to show in the realms of Art, aided by
the revival of the Classic schools, brought about in some
measure the re-birth of the Renaissance, while new
thoughts on the mediaeval times and better acquaintance-
ship with the work encouraged a Neo-Gothic spirit; from
which followed the ? Battle of the Styles.? That battle is
still being waged, and it brought about then an added
interest in, and a better condition of, Architecture, Art,
and msthetic aspirations, than had been in vogue for
centuries previously. The net result, architecturally, to
Australia was not so speedily patent. For a few years
it was decidedly the reverse of good, for the thousands
who flocked into the colonies overburdened the place.


Before the rush, a few stone buildings, weatherboard
houses and slab huts constituted the towns generally?
those of the older colonies being but little more advanced;
so the ever unceasing and increasing stream of emigra-
tion to this part of the world had the consequence of
necessitating the rushing up of any sort of shake-down
shanty to accommodate the gold seekers. Finally, tent
life had to be again resorted to, and ? Canvas Towns ?
(confused mazes of sheds and booths) sprang up.
Though things settled down a little after that, still
Architecture moved but slowly, necessarily checked by
the fever and fervor of the time; for though the
builder flourished, the architect was almost unknown.
Altogether the majority of the public buildings of that
period, besides being miracles of ugliness, were so small
and incommodious that most of them soon had to be
swept away, or converted to wholly different uses. This
applies well nigh equally to the capitals of all the colonies.
To-day, of the traces of our olden cities little but the bare
thoroughfares remain. The unseen yet cogent forces
latent in the community were placed in touch with the
synchronous growth of Art life in England, and a change
soon followed.
This is how a great architectural authority, Professor
Kerr, phrases that phase of contemporaneous culture, in
his editorial addenda to the new edition of Fergusson?s
History of Modern Architecture (London, 1891)1: ??The
great movement of 1851 in London, destined as it was to
awaken the energies of industrial art all over the globe,
if it made its very first impression in America, was very
soon after felt in Australia. Speaking generally, the
progress in architecture in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide,
Auckland, Wellington, and other towns at the antipodes,
has been on the same lines as in the United States of
America. The influence of English practice has been
similar, the same styles of design have been accepted,
and the same treatment has been followed.? That this
is true as far as it goes there is no gainsaying; for, of
course, the after-developments in America of the
Richardson-Romanesque, and the following France in
iron-framed, tile-faced structures as new national types,
are a special and subsequent departure. The outcome of
this time of intense interest in Art appertainings had been
encouraged during the period of unprecedented pros-
perity the colonies had experienced, and prodigality and
progress went hand in hand. The avowed idea of the
legislator Was to render each city a place of palaces.
This was the condition of affairs nearly all over Aus-
tralia, as instanced by the time when the present General
Post Office, Sydney, was designed, which is the finest
building in that city to-day, except for the blemish
caused by the Barneto (in) Sani carvings. Then the
graceful Gothicesque creation that was to have been,
the Sydney Houses of Parliament, is also of this decade.
That premiated design, having the appropriate motto,
? I Bide,? although it is practically impossible to carry
it out now?as the plan included all the Government
Departments in a group?is criticised as if erected, in Fer-
gusson?s History before referred to. Again the Government
House at Hobart, the handsomest in the colonies,
was finished in 1868. Knight and Kemp?s picturesque
prize design, in the Elizabethan style, for Government
House, Melbourne, belongs to the same era, and the pity
is that it was not carried into execution, This was the
| epoch, too, when the existing Parliament House of
Melbourne was planned and prepared, which has, up to
the present, cost at least half a million sterling, and will
cost fully a like sum to complete. But that even does not
bespeak all its original promised glories, for it is well
known that the first thought was to build it of pure
white Carrara marble. The Banks of New South Wales
and Victoria, in Coll ins-street, Melbourne, are also of this
period. Other instances could be cited ?the Universities
of Sydney and Melbourne, St. Patrick?s Cathedral and
Church of England Grammar School in the last named
city, and further the old Council Chamber, Adelaide, and
a great many more besides, but these will surely suffice.
Then the civic authorities, too, proved themselves right
guardians of the people?s privileges, by pushing on works
of great magnitude and magnificence shortly after-
wards, so that the Town Halls of the colonies can be
said to compare with those of the Belgian and other
Continental towns, whose Hotels de Ville are rare object
lessons in municipal munificence. Indeed, the boast
of Augustus Caesar as regards the Imperial City,
? Mavmorearn se relinquere quam lateritiam accepisset
describes a state of things which has almost been
paralleled in the capital cities of Australia within the
memory of man. Such is our legacy of the epoch of
1851.
Since that time what an extraordinary succession of
surprises are unfolded, what truly remarkable changes
time has wrought, as we view with admiration, mingled
with astonishment, fine buildings occupying ground
where there used to at one time stand mere hovels!
We may not fulfil an ideal conception of growth in
architectural grace, for how could that be, considering
our limitations ? Short and sharp has been the struggle
for existence in these Sunny South lands; still surely in our
brief day we moderns , who, as heirs of all the ages of
architectural lore and luxury, should really be termed the
ancients , have pressed on to our present proud position
with credit; and though ? these are the shores where, in
a dream of fear, Cathay saw darkness dwelling half the
year ? the paean of praise of this new world now can be,
undoubtedly, thus somewhat Tennysonially expressed?
? Through the shadow of the globe we sweep into the
younger day. Fifty Austral years are better than a
cycle of Cathay.?
In later times too much of a speculative spirit has been
shown in the architectural designs, with an absence of
{esthetic attainment; and though there has, here
and there, been progress made as the natural result of
evolution, encouraged by environment, it is, unfor-
tunately, not that of Australia as a whole. The
Art has been ancillary and, with few exceptions, still of
the imitative order. The consequence is that the great
proportion of the newer buildings appear lifeless, the
fronts being but as dead masks covering the form that
may exist behind. Of course, the structures are better
and more substantially erected, and the use of more
modern materials is evident, but still the charm
of the older world is wanting. For after the
generous outpouring of the people?s funds during the
fifties, the princely purses of the various Governments
were close clasped for some time, while cement stuccoed
facades formed the order of the day in many places as
regards public buildings, and tills affected the private


ones also, especially as the lack of means cut down the
amounts available for such structures. Again, the early
competitions in the colonies ?and for that matter later
ones too ?have been in many instances judged poorly,
the conditions being practically over-ridden. All this
checked advance in, and caused harm to, Architecture ;
for in that art, above others, to stand still is to stagnate ;
so if there be no progression, there must be retrogressive
resultings. Beside and beyond all this, the exigencies of
push and progress in other ways affected architecture,
for buildings have been run up and made to let; and so
long as business could be done in them, or the functions
of living be carried on, their projectors and progenitors
were satisfied, and thought nothing, about creating a
thing of beauty that would be a joy for ever. No I the
joy for ever was undoubtedly, as Ruskin puts it, its
price in the market, and nothing more; still, that is
gradually diminishing? and, despite the many obstacles
and deficiencies, there are good works yearly being
erected throughout the colonies. The vitiated copies of
Italian buildings, the base vulgarities of design, the
tawdry shop fronts, stuccoed terraces, and the thousand-
and-one-other abominations that were the reproach of
the British Isles themselves, not so very many years ago,
are being reproduced here in a lesser and lesser degree
each year. While things are altering for the better in
England, in the colonies the wants of climatic conditions
and comfort are beginning to be met, and the con-
structive adaptability of new materials is being attended
to. This Southern Empire, at length, is beginning to feel
the truth of Cicero?s saying, that ??Honors encourage
the Arts, for all are incited towards these studies by
fame, and their pursuit has always flagged whenever the
nation has held them beneath their consideration.?
To give anything of an analytical history, or even a
Catalogue RaUonm of the heterogeneous combination of
styles of architecture in the principal buildings erected
in the colonies, is not possible in the limited space at our
disposal, and to simply append a detailed account of the
date of the birth of such ?say during the last five years
or so?or to make out a sort of glorified guide-book cum
handbook, with a list of the prominent names connected
with architecture attached thereto, would convey neither
to the future historian nor the intelligent outsider aught
of a comprehensive idea of our latter-day 19th century
architectural motifs . One would need, besides analysis,
a series of pithy obiter dicta thrown out in the light of
sound theoretic criticism, appreciatively written, and
taking the form of crisp historiettes, in which the march
of material progress would be adequately depicted.
That, however, is clearly beyond the scope of the present
article, which is merely sent forth as an avant
courier , or (practically) as an introductory chapter, to
our intended seried reviews of The Year?s Architecture
in Australia.
Much might be written, did space permit, on the
progress' Architecture has made as a profession. Upwards
of 600 architects are now practising in Australia, while
100 or so are engaged besides in the different Government
offices. With assistants and pupils, it is easy to see
there must be well nigh 2,000 persons connected with
architectural work in these colonies. For their help and
aid there are Institutes in all the seven divisions of our
great dominion, except Western Australia and Tasmania,
and Architectural Associations are established in both
Melbourne and Sydney. The Institute in the first named
city rejoices in the prefix ? Royal,? and the Association
there embraces also Engineers and Surveyors in its body
corporate ?the first society in the world to do so. The
roll of all these various associations numbers fully 500, or
about a quarter of the estimated followers of the pro-
fession of Architecture in Australia. With federation,
registration, education, and examination, therefore, in
the air, as regards these different institutions, and with
Technical Colleges, and Departments of Architecture in
the Universities throughout the Australasian colonies,
the prospect of future progress and prosperity in
Architecture, under the Southern Cross, is both great and
vast; and the realization may, we trust, surpass all
expectations.
Though the haste of our modem life, with its stress
and strain, are alien to Art; though the greed for gold
that disfigures the nineteentli century has resulted in
injury, and though that monster ? Commercial Profit ?
has practically destroyed Beauty ; the springs of Art in
the human mind are deathless, and genius never dies.
There is no doubt, then, that in Australia Architecture
is becomiug regenerate, promising a vitality and appre-
ciation of proportion that may some day truly take us
back to the artistic glories of ancient Greece, with which
our climate lends so much association. It is to be
hoped, therefore, that these great colonies, in the glow
of their bright promise, will show the mightiness of their
power by the assthetic worth of their buildings, and
thus give greater grace to the land of which the poet so
sweetly sings;?
? O thou who hast thy splendid hair entwining,
A toil-wove wreath where are no blood-won bays,
Who standest in a stainless vestment shining
Before the eyes and lips of love and praise!
O wrought of old in orient clime and sunny,
With all His richest bounties largely decked,
With heart all virgin gold and breath all honey,
Supremest work of greatest Architect!?
