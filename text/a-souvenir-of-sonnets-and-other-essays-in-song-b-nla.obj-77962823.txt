A SOUVENIR OF A] vj D OTHER
Sonnets
?AUSTRALIAN ?
SONNET, PREFATORY AND APOLOGETIC.
E?en as some novice in shipbuilder?s art
On launched firstling of skill-taxing lor�
Lets fond gaze linger, much to yet deplore;
While hope, with fear alloyed, make sirely heart
To leap within him, as slow die apart
The waters? foamy dances ?welcome fit: ?
Round queenly hull that as on throne doth sit.
Soon mission o?er brine-moods to ply by chart;
So, in the conflict of strong hope and fear,
Scan I this venture of young novice thought
Aspiring to transfer the smile and tear;
And wonder how shall fare what hath been wrought.
Of my bark?s freight some dear as choice be found.
So to the Archmuse?s own its boon redound!


THE ROYAL VISIT CROWNING AUSTRALIAN
FEDERATION.
December, 1900.
Ye patriots of the sixfold colony?
Whose heart-wed brain, to found us commonweal,
Desired long, long hath planned!?at length the seal
Of grateful Gratulatlon?s ready by,
Pledged to be set by Britain?s royalty
On that young scroll where Austral loan of steel
Pregnant with Boer-stung prowess, rare as lead.
Hath blazoned fame in signs of Life?s own dye!
Let Federation?s herald, blythely hailed,
Due honours plan far-wafted visitors
Whose will, ushering, shall grace joint-parlia-
ment;
?Tis by her own seed that once more unveiled
Shall peerless Queenhood be! Well may these shores
Echo exultance, crowned with such event.
DIES MEMORABILIS.
(The Annunciation of the Australian Commonwealth,
1901, A.D.).
O day of days!?thou milestone marble-proud
Shall bruit Australia?s progress, bold as young,
Along that common steep where down have rung,
And ring, watchwords of realms ?some under shroud
That Luxury slowly wove; some loitering bowed
With creed or custom, to be left or lost among
Strenuous rivals: ?thou, of all Year?s throng.
ShalltJ sacred be to Patriotism, endowed
With Commonweal?s rare bfrth! How well might
seem
Sky?s cloudless favour (of experience grand
Such forecast prove!) earnest for southern hope
Of Heaven?s smile gracing fact to national dream
So borne by thee; yea, birthday thee this land
Shall honour still, when reached her utmost
scope.


SEQUENCE.
And who him prides on Austral birth or breed,
But finds such prayer from heart well, if not lip?
? Heaven speed our Commonweal, whether to out-
strip
Harelike, or tortoiselike, with slow-sure heed.
Press ploddingwise ?midst older States, the greed
Of some whereof with undue blood did drip.
While full-fledged wing of others Crime will clip;
Which ills befall not ours, Heaven?s grace at need!
Nay, prove Australia sisterly her will,
In furtherance of an Empire without peer.
As she at Loyalty?s call to War?s red strain
Hath sealed a daughter?s; never Faction spill,
Fraternal blood, Pelf crush or Luxury sear.
But Truth mild-mightj sway peace-prospered
gain!?


CRESCENS RESPUBLICA AUSTRALIENSIS.
Do! at the accoutred heroinely side
Of our Britannia?s zenith-nearing frame
Stands, creditable daughter?fit to claim
E?en younger-sistership?Australia?s pride.
By virtue of well-deveiloped aid, supplied
Almost ere might that mother ask the same,
Hath not her loyal arm proving strong to tame
The common traitor won her nerve stern-tried
The due of nation weaned? Heaven send her mail
Prove of such worth as Paul?s self would exhort
For Christian?s warfare: hers for helmet be
Salvation; Faith for shield; Truth make prevail.
Her sword two-edged; her breastplate Virtue?s sort
While shod with Peace foot swift for Charity!
ON THE DEATH OF QUEEN VICTORIA,
January, 1901.
O year eventful! ?that dost, ushering, speed
The car of century new; for commonweal.
Reared by south state-craft, wafting regal seal
Of Britain?s motherliness ?th? exultant heed
We pay thy dawn, paid none that such precede.
Must tempered be by cable cursed to deal
A dagger-thrust at all Australia?s leal;
For, pillar of Virtue and Peace, to Heavenly meed
One lately passed, who long upon this earth
Graced mightiest crown. Britons! the peerless
queen
Of peerless empire on its zenith glad
Hath smiled her last: so yield else-timely mirth
To Grief?s pomp, such as ne?er by nations seen?
Church joining State to blazon loss thrice-sad!
SEQUENCE.
Fate, sparing two and eighty years, at last
To rob Earth of one torch of Truth, hath failed
To quench its boon transmitted. As prevailed.
In life, her righteousness and power forecast


By such unconscious, e?en from War and Waste,
Pelf prompted oft, to win those councils mailed
To keep Europa?s balance; so bewailed
As lost be not that same whojpe queenly caste/
Need hover round this empire?guardian spirit:
To aftertime a model-foil must be
Her walk in fourfold just-proportioned sphere ?
Queen mother wife and friend. May who inherit
Leave, heirloom, such desert of loyalty
As hers whom God re-thrones by consort dear!
TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE TRANSVAAL, 1901.
Kruger!?thou would-be prophet, priest and king!
Hast not overreached thee, self deluding more
Than thine uncultured charge? Too late deplore
Thy countrymen that faith unquestioning
Based on thy groundless vaunts! How long did cling
Their hope to thine unprecedented store
Of pledges unredeemed, bestressed with lore
Of sacred writ perverted! Is to sting
Of foes? due censure proof thy conscience dull.
As to ripe curse of many a loyal dupe?
Hopest forged arbitration? Art the gull
Of peace-term?s forged mirage? Ere treachery droop
To real peace will thy promised courage flee
Where Age may cheat Desert with failure free?
TO THE EUROPEANS BELEAGURED IN
PEKING, 1901.
All glory to you, Japhet?s lordly seed!
In blood heroic dipped East?s blade has been,
On Fame?s scroll to record defence, of mien
Resourceful as romantic: yea, this deed
May well claim greater wonder, if not heed,
Than Britons hemmed in Lucknow. Well your
scene,
That) hath, belike, no precedent, might wean
From subtle weapon, for Fray?s pomp decreed,


Spruce Relief?s critic eye. What should but stare
Rajput and Sikh success, as in wild dream.
To find brocade all costly bagwise stay
Your barricade, Peace-claimed chattels dare
Bestead the lack of War?s wont, and eye-gleam
Of heroine?s wan smile worst of Dearth away?
ON COLONIAL PATRIOTISM, 1901.
Ah, surely must true Briton?s heart be blest
To mark the zeal of southern loyalty?
How humble cot with mansion proud will vie,
On staff conspicuous signalling its zest
With flag or cheap or costly. Surely, rest
Is due to lungs, aye ready to reply
With song and cheers to published victory
Or oft to Music?s means of praise addressed!
The very urchin?s play apes patriot fire,
Crying Britannia up and Kruger down;
Maid?s gentle breast keeps more than Fashion?s
law,
Decked with rosette three-coloured; nor is lyre
Backward in tribute; whilst the pulpits crown
Lay eloquence with praise, of pious awe.
ON THE TURN IN THE TIDE OF THE
TRANSVAALIAN WAR, 1901.
Thrice-welcome news, by cable late supplied!
Come is the turn of War?s tide; now is passed
Suspenseful crisis; clouds, that overcast
Britannia?s earlier warfare, far and wide
Are scattered like the Boer?s faithless pride;
Reached is the Transvaal?s capital at last.
Where now shall her chief hypocrite the fast
Exhorted keep? Where be once more belied
The white flag?s sacred token? Late the turn
To the foe?s come, mayhap, to learn worse siege
Than their three Briton-barriered towns could spurn.
So shall be seen how the compressing hedge
Of British weapons fares; and how will front
Guerilla?s desperate vow War?s transferred brunt.


ON IMPERIAL ENTHUSIASM, 1901.
Sons of Australia! yours is righteous pride!
?Tis rightly done ye praise an empire?s worth
Whose peer, nay like, ne?er was nor is on earth
Nor shall be, own all British Heaven as guide.
Ye are of Christian race, that far and wide
Spreadeth Salvation?s story to bring forth
High mood and manners where was heathen dearth;
Yours is the old flag three-cross?symbol tried
Of Liberty whose progress mothers Peace,
As she Prosperity. Such empire well
Might seem Heaven-favoured Israel?s seed re-
stored.
Dawns glory on your land. Her ready lease
Of patriot courage, when its need hefel
Britannia, shall bring back wide-famed reward.
OP BANISHED CRONJE, 1901.
How fares the Boer whose cruelty for him won
That surname of ?the black ?? A stolid heart,
Would he now ape that mood of Buonaparte
To which Ambition yielded, when undone
By fateful struggle of Waterloo? Nor lone
Nor haply long shall Failure?s prison-smart?
Mock Treachery?s son as last pathetic part
Pined out by Gallia?s demigod, tho? flown
Like less mirage from Cronje. Far aloof
From martial scene wave-wardered gaol doth keep
The latter?s fall as former?s. Is to wraith
Of like ambitions that Boer?s durance proof?
From him what thoughts doth War ironic reap.
Who wronged foes captured and uncaptured faith?
SEQUENCE.
Perchance the false barbarian?s spleen may brood
On that last stubborn desperate stand he made;
When brought to bay and cramped in stern
blockade
By foe?s enveloping manoeuvre, and the mood
Of hounded rabbit did all that withstood


So suddenly possess, till pick and spade
In Paardeberg?s ravine wrought shelter and shade
Of martial warren for those whom lack of food
And shell-spread havoc soon prevailed to teach
Surrender. Yea, perchance, vexation vain
Recurs with thought that his the tactics were
That put chance in scorned Britain?s wishful reach
To gild Majuba?s loss, her warfare?s stain,
With glorious capture?anniversary rare.
ON THE BOER ABANDONMENT OF
PRETORIA, 1901.
?Tis vainly o?erweening Transvaal nerves despair.
How long shall Boer?s sullen rally keep
At bay the hostile general?s cornering sweep,
Pretoria left to plundering alien?s care?
Lo! Kruger?s failure that late deigned to fare
By locomotive (haply deemed a cheap
Mobile metropolis) now bids his sheep
Esteem some noteless town the destined heir
To proud Pretoria?s government! O change,
By Britain?s foe undreamt as all unloved!
And, say, fail this town Leaguer?s train to foil.
Shall place of yet less note be doomed to range
Of foreign Siege?s havoc; or be moved
Pelf president to ease exhausted moil?
ON THE CRISIS IN CHINA, 1900 (AUGUST).
How stuns the crisis! War?s far rumour thaws
Into grim Action, at rage-breeding stress
Of Massacre?s red wrong that steels Redress:
Now elther?s tongue and pen, the other cause
Having or rightly or wrongly censured, pause
But to glean more for Censure. Lo! still press
Armed thousands of four nations? greediness
For Chinese soil, vainly debarred by laws
They deem mere bigotry that shames a date


By them enlightened! What aim, then, hath each?
Combine they for the weal of state-craft stunted?
In which scale means Japan to throw her weight?
?Twixt ill-yoked Powers, belike, will grown stern
breach
Ere quartered be what more than hath confronted!
ON THE FIRING OF PEKIN.
When shall the Cable?s mission cease to shock?
By flaw of Alliance erst, now Chance?s freak,
Vexed is print-ridden soul of less than week;
Waxes world-wide suspense of Christian stock
O?er plight of kin like-creeded. How to mock
The reassurance bred of brief-passed news
Seemeth this last, that dread may well infuse
At distance: ?Chinese Babylon would block
With fire?s rage foreign vengeance. But is asked:
Hath entry of the many-speeched Relief,
Moiling to quell this scorching check, but found
Legation charred at bay? How like was tasked
French capture of fired Moscow! Shall new leaf
Of History with Retreat?s like ill astound?
ON THE OCCUPATION OP PEKING, 1900.
Praiseworthy feat! At length th? allies have learned
? Union is strength ???maxim discarded oft:
Now purpose, whereat China?s justly scoffed ?
Scarce less by rebel Boxer stung?hath spurned
Dissension?s yoke. The Christians? wrangle turned
To force decisive, let the mask (soon doffed)
Of Europe?s trickery slip from mind, tho?, soft,
Embassy parley?s farce so late discerned!
Full time it was Union should baton wield,
Such strain to nerve as ensured Peking?s fall:
But three days? grace, it seemed, and her defence
Had made dischannelled Peiho?s flood a shield
For Reinforcement; as it chanced, the gall
Of one day?s siege bombed pig-tail spite to sense!


ON THE DECORATION OF MELBOURNE IN
HONOUR OF THE VISIT OF THEIR ROYAL
HIGHNESSES, THE DUKE AND DUCHESS
OF YORK, 1901.
Say, when, hath ever any nation tasked
Wedlock of Science and Art to breed eye?s pleasure
Magnificence of nobler type? Rare treasure
As triumph by cultured sense, therein that basked,
Shall this for memory prove. For, seeming masked
In decoration mute, glows what tells measure?
Ample as dignified?of hearts whose leisure
Royalty from urban and rural business asked,
And Loyalty thrilled to tender. Street with street,
Mansion with mansion vieing, queen-city shows,
In arch and bannered staff, festoonery hems.
Forgot her needy babehood: she doth greet
In bride?s wise royal-grace mission York bestows,
By night self-haloed with electric gems.
ON READING OF THE ASSASSINATION OF
PRESIDENT McKINLEY (SEPTEMBER, 1901).
Lo! once again is Civilisation made
To shudder and sicken thro? all her nation limbs;
Spreads horror; of whose twin-young, Grief now
dims ?
Now Wrath fires million eyes; blind bolt that stayed
This one heart hath all Christendom?s down-weighed.
While ghoul-fit covert seeks the worst of whims.
Brand Anarch guilt, unnerved is hand that brims
Columbia?s prosperous cup to find there laid
Spawn-gall of spite undreamed. Awake, arise,
Ye nations, self-styled Christian! Justice gird!
A hundred-headed hydra?s hiss is heard.
Discerned its fang Say, shall with death surprise
Fresh fiend fresh rule as late Truth-mirror?s
blurred?
Heaven send new Hercules shred Hell?s disguise!


ON A MASSACRE OF ARMENIANS.
(Recast from Original of 1896 A.D.)
O God! Whose wondrous plan Time?s every mood
Is busied to weave out ?whose wisdom knows
To reap from loathsome tares, Thy enemy sows,
Harvest of praise?give ear. Lo! many a rood
Blusheth Armenia fair, defiled with blood.
?Tis her own children?s blood that thus o?erflows ?
?Tis blood of Innocence whose ghastly throes
Have human vampires, tasting once, re-wooed
To rapish gluttony! List! heart-piercing shrieks,
From hundreds of unsuccoured victims wrung,
Dulling Bereavement?s wail, still back are flung
By helpless wall and hill; still Carnage wreaks
Pollution on sick air; still these, and more,
Rising before Thee vengeful aid implore.
SEQUENCE.
Be these all in Thy truthful balance weighed!
Oh, grant the prayers, by sympathy begot
From myriad hearts, avail to mend the lot
Of Thine afflicted! Grown mere selfish trade,
Shall modern statecraft to mere serf degrade
High Justice without shame? Shall raseless blot
Mar scroll of Christian nations; while, besot
With vice-brewed misrule. Turkey prompt each raid,
Mocking threats unfulfilled? How oft of old
Thine arm for Israel did deliverance work;
Haste, so, to save from wolfish Kurd and Turk
The residue of Thine Armenian fold!
So be Thy justice mercy and truth adored
By Thine and aliens owning Thee their Lord!
THE POET?S ART.
High is the poet?s duty, and as high
His privilege, and his desert no less!
The favourite son of Fancy, he will ply
The dues of Nature?s priest with faithfulness;
Interpreting, when influence due possess,


Such of her wonders as he may divine:
Enwrapt with her, his chastened skill will dress
What vulgar sense deem common with most fine
And lasting charm; yea, to old glories new assign.
The clef of rhapsody rare senses move.
Being jealous reverence of th? ideal in all ?
His privilege it is the soul to prove,
Teaching its wont to soar beyond the pall
That on Life?s loud arena oft will fall:
His theme, like fount refreshing droughty way.
Or like th? ambrosial cneer of Fancy?s hall.
Should serve man?s nobler need to sate and stay,
Love of the good infuse, and purge the ill away.
Then who his meed true poet would refuse?
Revere we that quintessence of all Brain,
What tho? some rare inheritor abuse ?
As oft, alas! ?God?s favour; yea, as gain
Desirable ?ennobling?count such vein
As on worn battling of Earth?s prose will breathe
Fresh courage thro? some Heavenly-thoughted
strain,
Souled with like rhythm! For stewards, who be-
queathe
Our fray song-cordial nerving, waits not more than
wreath ?
THE RIVALRY OF WATERS.
See! yon stream, for venture all alert.
Doth with e?er-growing speed his rivals race.
See! now, with crystal sinews all begirt,
Takes he, as cliff-set sheerness fronts his pace,
A featly leap, of far-descending grace;
With chilled air fluttering round his cleaving might,
Whence dazzlingly rebounds Day?s beamy mace,
Now, to drown boulder bald, thereon doth light;
Which in slow-deepening wounds bechurns his cease-
less spite.


What revelling chaos there the waters keep.
In dense foam fevering forth, and founting spray!
And, ere they gather them for second leap.
How far ear-stunning triumph vaunt alway,
That drowns the forced acclaims wherewith repay
Near steeps, and far, that awesome majesty;
The while, as sweeps their frenzy its lower way,
Seem quakes, like despot-ridden slaves, to ply
Along the deep vale?s dusk, into whose lap they hie.
Seems th? outdinned challenge of giant cataract
The triumph to swell of giant waterfall,
As on that lasheth o?er yon bouldery tract,
Unedging each obstruction?s stubborn gall!
How high against each would-be harrier tall
His spleen he?ll belch; how with foam-masked fang
Gnaweth the base thereof; in what stern brawl
His seething sport maketh drowned fragments
clang;
How spurns wave-worn decline, like shaft from bowy
twang.
THE DAWN OF MOTHERHOOD.
What strong-wing hopes thrill all her soul and sense,
As claspeth she that life?whereof her own
Well claims dear half with pangs but lately known?
To breast, long stranger to such bliss intense;
And feels that fairy-lipped need draw thence
The milky treasure, yearning to overflow;
While with sweet helplessness, of dimply glow,
Answers the babe that motherly consentience.
What dainty dances still her fingers keep?
What tender play round that dependent form;
How her smile-haloed lip will steep and steep
Each tiny limb in kisses proud as warm!
Oh, who shall tell what nothings passing sweet
She murmurs in that scarce-discerning ear;
Who such soft, subtle language might repeat,
Bestressed, as 'tis anon, with strange but meaning
tear?


THE HEART?S AWAKING: A SONG.
As when timeless waking
Snap the golden weft
Of a dream, bliss making,
Grief to shreds is left;
So the heart awaketh
From its dream of love
?Mid fair shreds it breaketh
Of bliss Fancy wove
As when waker thinketh
To put piece to piece
His rent dream it shrinketh.
And but shreds increase;
So when rent heart striveth
Love?s dream to reweave,
Memory but more riveth ?
Shredded shreds more grieve.
TO A PAIR OF LIPS: A FANTASIA.
? Sweet kisses, rare blisses! oh, who will them buy??
Ye rosy twin vendors so winsomely cry,
While, haloed with smiles
And perfumed as with spices
With unwitting wiles
Glean ye all the due prices
That passing hearts proffer thro? glance or thro? sigh.
Twin vendors! this charmed heart is thrilling to prove
Highest bidder in all the sweet offers ye move.
Ay, all its young hoard
It not falters to
E?en now that?s outpoured,
You to hold in sole right.
And lavish thereby all that Love may behove.
NOT ALL IN VAIN: A SONG.
O pain of all pain?
To have loved all in vain!


15
O lore to be rued.
So early imbued ?
That never again
Will dawn the blest mood
Cupid, so thwarted, once brought in glad tram.
But, say, is in vain
What proves Wisdom?s gain?
Nay, rather, I ween,
A blessing hath been
Love?s testing, tho? pain;
For thought word and mien
chasteneth. and crost Passion tames with silk
chain!
LOVE?S WRAITH: A SONG.
Ah, Love, defeated, scorneth
All such as dare despise,
Till victor victory mourneth
That trampled heart implies.
As with unmasked traitor,
With mighty Love I strove;
And. with wild utmost, later
From guestly rights him drove.
Yet still, like ghost, he haunteth
Once shrine, now ruin void;
And prayers for rest still taunteth
With promised joys destroyed.
Say, is it set for ever?
That bliss wherein I basked?
Shall no new dawn deliver
From gloom my heart so tasked?
Oh, for some spell elysian,
His ruthless wraith to lay?
To free from branded vision
Of pleasures passed for aye!
But Love, defeated, scorneth
All such as dare despise;
Till victor victory mourneth
That trampled heart implies!


LOVE TILL DEATH: A MELODY.
O make haste to this bosom, sweet maiden!
Here pillow that fair, tressy head;
Bid me press heart, with sighful love laden,
To mine, where like thrill has been bred.
My life?s dearest! delay not
To answer full trust,
That with life shall decay not
When flesh turn to dust:
Make thy haven these arms
Would aye cherish thy charms:
Canst spurn the fond soul that with thine would
wed?
When to grey hath the ebon tress faded,
When brow, once smooth, Time?s coulter know,
And long care have once-shapely cheek raided,
And dim grown the eye?s vernal glow;
O then, dearest! like lovers.
Together in gloam,
While the past round us hovers
We?ll speak of near home?
Of fruit that crowns love,
Passed abroad or above;
Yea, deeplier than erst shall our souls interflow.
NOT LOVE, BUT FRIENDSHIP; A MELODY.
Once having loved, and truly;
Once served and cherished duly,
Say, could I love again?
I might, methinks; but never
This heart from that could sever
Which swayed with sweetest reign.
For woe, thorn-crowned my wooing.
Hath been fond hope?s undoing,
And wraithlike Love?s pursuing
This mask of cold disdain.


Content thee, so, with pleasure
Of Friendship?s sober treasure,
Should still to me you turn.
May ours be no wild parting,
As when crost Passion, smarting,
In searing terms oufburn!
Know well some worthy lover
Soon round thy charms shall hover
Unlike this torn-heart rover;
And bliss thy virtues earn!
UNDECEIVED.
Her haughty overcharms, once met,
Lone meditation haunt ?
Fresh pleasure with fresh pain inset,
An oft-regretted vain regret,
Both vaunt and taunt.
Then be her guile another?s gain
Content am I with loss:
His suit won favour, mine disdain;
Gain that doth barb of loss be whet.
His cared I not to cross.
He offering gold,
She honour sold;
So, still be all my heart out-told
Despised as dross!
LINES TO A CHILD.
Sweet child! thy playful innocence
Need paint, nay mirror, Heaven,
Refining all my soul and sense
As with some potent leaven.
A lovelier, sweeter, purer clime
Seems with thy breath to breathe;
Simplicity seems all sublime
When it such nature wreathe!


A PAIR OF DARK EYES: A MELODY.
Seem they twin ebon lymphs
Where, late and rathe,
Like fable-gracing nymphs.
Disporting bathe
The daughters of the soul
Their glowing innocence;
Till stirred thereby be shoal on shoal
Of heaven-kindled beams
To lavishly dispense
Boon-bearing charms caught thence.
While breathe those nymphs mute eloquence
Of worthy themes.
And of all nymphs that there
Relave their grace,
Love seems divinest fair
To my lorn case;
There Mirth and Joy?s relay
May shatter their bath?s calm
To semblance of lucid foam and spray;
And grief fair tributes breed
Like stars in skyey qualm;
Love, that doth Heaven-taught psalm
There in unearthly light embalm.
Wins all my heed.
FANCY-FREE: A SONG.
Let slavish poet rave in praise
Of tyrant Love?s caprice?
Delate his wit in wildering maze
With aught for fare but peace!
But, as for me,
I?m fancy free;
And, know, this heart
By subtlest art
Shall never never chained be ??


Let craze-worn fool sole joyance claim
Fleet fondle sigh or kiss;
Still drowse and dream in trifling tame;
In cooing culture miss!
But, as for me,
I?m fancy free;
And, know, this heart
By subtlest art
Srall never never chained be!
THE PROFESSIONS OF THE UNFAVOURED
SUITOR.
Not hating my lot,
She loveth me not.
Yet, trust I, doth not scorn:
And, in sooth, did she scorn, or even hate
My plea, such mood being shown by her ?
When a misconcept all-luckless blurr
Her judgment?s careful weight?
Might never avail one jot.
Tho? to hoped rose as mocking thorn,
The love, scarce pent in my heart forlorn,
To embitter or to abate.
LIFE?S ? WILL O? THE WISP.?
Some brilliant-baiting cheat,
Winsome its charms as fleet,
Stirs in its hunter such desire
As whelmeth in a quenchless fire
Brief warnings of conception meet.
We strain, we sweat, we pant ?
And what ?say, what ?have we?
The ache of unexpected want ?
A hellish mockery!
Let her veneer and gild.
The world can never yield
One ace of pure and sterling joy.
But only some alloyed alloy,


Whose counterfeit too late?s revealed.
Then cease we to pursue
What charms but mortal sense;
None but Heaven?s charms are fadeless,
And duly recompense!
true,
LOVE?S CREED: A CANZONET.
Oh, sorrow hath its sweet
No less than joy;
Yea, maketh that complete,
When due alloy!
So, love! the very thought,
That I need leave
A soul so dear, hath taught
Me not to grieve.
The joy to meet again.
More dear than now.
Will best bloom sown by pain
Of parting?s plough.
For true love-tendrilled heart,
The more Event
To wrench from counterpart
May seem intent,
But closer, tighter ever
To that will cling;
From mischance, may not sever,
Faith holier spring.
Yes, sorrow hath its sweet;
And sweet it is
Twain hearts as one may beat,
Tho? each each miss.
