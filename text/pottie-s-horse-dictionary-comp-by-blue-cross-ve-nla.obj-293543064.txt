PREFACE
INDEXED DICTIONARY.
The use of this Dictionary is primarily intended
for the use of the Stockowner and Breeder far away
from veterinary aid, and yet desiring to adopt some
rational measures in the treatment of his horses in
sickness and disease.
In its approach to the subject it has been set out
in simple and concise language and indexed in order
to save time and trouble to the searcher for such
knowledge as it is possible to condense in a work of
this size and limitations.
This publication represents the sth edition of a
similar work and has been thoroughly revised and
brought up to the last minute in detailed treatment
of disease of the horse.
A simple procedure, of describing the cause, the
description of symptoms and an appropriate line of
treatment of each of the diseases herein dealt with,
has been followed throughout.

I. MANAGEMENT OF THE HORSE.
AGEING THE HORSE.
Away back in the dim past before books or records
were kept man had accumulated knowledge especially in
Animal husbandry and he had adopted the plan of
assessing the age of his domesticated animals by the teeth.
He found it reliable and especially so in the case of the
horse.
The same method handed down through countless ages
still persists and so today there can be found no better
way of coming to a fairly accurate estimation of the age
of a horse than by consulting the incisors or front teeth,
together with the tusks. The molars or grinders also give
verification, but the incisors are reliable within limits, so
there is a table given to illustrate the changes taking place
in the incisor teeth with the passing of years.
The young animal has temporary incisor teeth which
commence to be shed at two years and six months, when
the permanent (adult) teeth come into being and these
continue to grow throughout life. The front teeth are
known as the Central (centre), Lateral, and Corner
Incisors.
The Temporary Incisors are smaller, white and smooth
and are thumb-nail shaped whilst the Permanent (Adult)
teeth are stronger, larger, and grooved, with a distinct
depression in the wearing surface which will vanish at
certain ages according to the tooth.
At One Year: Six incisors in top and six in the bottom
jaw. All temporary, not worn.
At Two Years; Wearing surface will be slightly
obliterated.
At Three Years: The Central Permanent Incisors have
cut at two years six months and are now in wear.
At Four Years: The Lateral Permanent Incisors have
cut at three years six months and are now in wear. Tusks
are breaking through.

10
POTTIB’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


At Five Years: The Corner Permanent Incisors have
cut, but are shell-like and only the front edge is in wear.
The tusks are well through, but shelly.
At Six Years: The Centrals have lost the dark
depression on the table or wearing surface. In other
words this depression has both worn and grown out.
At Seven Years: The depression in the wearing
surface of the Laterals has disappeared and the top
Corners have formed a groove by their lower fellows
wearing into them.
At Eight Years: The depression wears from the
Corners and the horse becomes known thereafter as
"aged.”
At Eight to Ten Years: The Incisors become squarer
in outline while at ten years Galveyne’s Groove appears
in the gum end of the top corners, and grows down by
regular advances to reach the wearing edge at twenty
years. This Groove is most helpful in defining an old
horse’s age.
At Twelve Years: The teeth are slanting, rounder in
outline, and narrower.
Table of Descriptive Names.
Foal—young horse up to one year old.
Colt—young male.
Filly—young female.
Gelding—castrated male.
Rig —horse whose testicles have not come down.
Stallion—uncastrated horse.
Mare—female.
BREEDS OF HORSES.
Horses are divided into four classes:—
1. Heavy Draught Horses, e.g., Shire, Clydesdale,
Suffolk, Percheron.
2. Light Draught Horses, e.g., Cleveland Bay, York-
shire, Coach Horse, Highland Garron.
3. Saddle and Harness Class, e.g., Thoroughbred,
Hunter, Arab, Hackney.
4. Pony Class, e.g., New Forest, Dartmoor, Exmoor,
Dales, Welsh cob, Western Islands, Shetland Ponies.

POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


BEDDING.
Wheat Straw, Oat Straw, Barley Straw, Grass Hay,
Sawdust, Bracken, Fern, Shavings. The ideal bedding
is a material, light, absorbent, clean of dust, or offensive
odours, and easily kept clean and changeable, and withal
to keep a good thick body as a mattress under the horse’s
body at rest.
Straw is most commonly used in this State; its biggest
drawback is the fact that some horses will eat large quan-
tities of their bedding during the night and take Colic
therefrom. It is difficult to keep 'in bed” over a slippery
concrete floor. Sawdust and shavings have the reputation
of too hot underfoot.
The bed must be turned up during the day, properly
cleaned and changed; all the soiled bedding removed
and replaced by clean. Much of the bedding may be
saved by drying and aerating in the sun.
DIET.
All fodder is divided into proteins, fats, carbohydrates,
mineral, salts, Vitamins and roughage. These need to
be given in proper proportions to form a balanced ration;
and the requirements of the animal will differ with the
Breed and type of work the horse is required to do. Also
Climatic conditions and seasonal changes will influence
the ration.
The following example of a balanced ration in a 1200-lb.
horse may be useful as a guide in selecting balanced
rations adapted to various types of horses under various
conditions.

Watering. An ample supply of clean water is essential.
Ten to twelve gallons daily should be provided for each
horse. i
GROOMING.
It is a very important factor in management of horses.
The main object is (a) cleanliness; (b) prevention of
diseases of the skin by removing such parasites, e.g.,
lice, mange mites, etc.; (c) the massage which stimulates
the blood circulation in the skin; (d) removing the body
waste.
Some parts of the body are often neglected and these
should be carefully examined, e.g., the poll, jowl, under
the mane, between the fore legs, the thigh, the heels,
between the buttocks. It is best to groom the horse at
night after a day’s work so that he may rest comfortably.
Grooming utensils should not be harsh and hurtful to
the skin; there is the danger of producing Groomer’s
Rash as well as irritating the animal and defeating the
ends of a very necessary service to the horse.
HOUSING AND HYGIENE.
Horses should be housed in well ventilated quarters
and protected from draughts. Each horse should have a
separate manger and hay rack. The manger should be
made from material easy to disinfect. Floors should be
preferably wood on concrete, or puddled clay; concrete
alone is too cold and slippery. It is best to keep a horse
insulated from the surface with some non-absorbent and
non-slipping material such as neuchatel. Proper drainage
in large stables is essential; surface drainage is preferable.
Ventilation needs close watching, especially in the
warmer seasons. The nascent fumes arising from urine
and dung in a stable overnight should be eliminated from
the atmosphere as speedily as possible and replaced by
a constant fresh supply of air.

POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


II. SYMPTOMS LIST.
APPETITE.
Loss of appetite is one of the first indications that all
is not well with the horse, especially since this animal is
a continuous feeder whilst awake; providing the food is
appetising it should always be regarded with suspicions
of ill-health.
DEFECATION.
The horse should use his bowels from 10 to 15 times
in twenty-four hours.
If the dung hardens and dries with less number of
defecations per day then it is called Constipation, whilst
on the contrary, should the rate of defecation increase,
the faeces change to fluid, it is known as Diarrhoea; or,
if blood stained, as "Dysentery.” The colour and odour
change with the food and in most cases with the diseased
condition of the liver. In worm infestation, worms can
be detected in faeces.
HAEMORRHAGE.
Nasal haemorrhage found in cases of Bleeders, High
Blood pressure, Nasal Catarrh, Gleet, Injuries of the
region, internally—usually bursting large blood vessels in
strong exercise, heavy work, racing, worm Aneurism, the
result of deep punctured wounds.
PULSE.
Normally the rate is 40 per minute, usually taken by
placing the index finger on an artery running around the
edge of the lower jaw about 3-in. forward of the angle
of the jaw or at a spot inside the forearm close up to
the chest muscles. The Pulse is usually disturbed in its
frequency, and degree of force in all diseases, injuries,
exercise or emotions, as it is the heart indicator, being
dependent and controlled by the heart action or reaction.
It is most commonly relied on by the veterinarian in
forming a diagnosis in the following cases: Colic, Gripes,
15
POTTIE'S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Pneumonia, Pleurisy, Poisoning, Metritis, Laminitis
(founder), infectious diseases and Heart diseases.
RESPIRATIONS.
Normally 8 to 12 per minute. The frequency varies
greatly with exercise or work, and usually increases with
disease injury or pain.
Shallow breathing indicates some degree of debility.
Stertorous Breathing occurs in brain affections and
injuries : Lead poisoning, Paralysis of throat, Roaring,
Whistling, Tetanus. Breathing is accelerated and nostrils
dilated in Pneumonia, Pleurisy, Peritonitis and types of
Colic, Tetanus.
SPASMS.
Sudden painful muscular contractions of the body or
extremities. If it affects the body it is known as Convul-
sions or Cramp. Symptom of a great variety of diseases.
Colic Convulsions, Azoturia, Diseases of Spinal Cord
and Brain, Strychnine poisoning and Tetanus.
SKIN.
The Skin, together with its appendages, is always
regarded in Stock as a true indicator of the degree of
health an animal possesses.
It secretes perspiration under normal conditions and
it varies in this function with disease and temperature.
Perspiration voids large quantities of effete matter from
the body and it is increased in hot weather, work, and
febrile diseases.
Excessive perspiration reduces vitality and can be
regarded as an indicator of disease. This is seen in cases
of: Colic, Febrile diseases, e.g., Tetanus.
SWELLINGS.
May be hard, soft, or doughy; appear suddenly or
gradually, painful and hot, or cold and painless; may be
indicative of abscess. Tumour, Purpurea haemorrhagica
Uticaria (Hives), Rupture or Hernia, Strangles, Blood
Poison, Insect bites, Injuries, Hind Fetlock Joints, in
Influenza, Kidney Complaints, Heart Diseases.
16
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


HOT AND COLD SWEATS.
Hot Sweat is found in febrile diseases.
Cold Sweats are seen in pain, excitement, and some
nervous derangements such as "Race Funk.”
TEMPERATURE.
Normally 101-deg. to 102-deg. Fahr,
The thermometer should be kept at hand for every
emergency as the temperature often clenches the diag-
nosis. Temperature is taken per rectum and care is
necessary to have the mercury well shaken down before
exposure and not to take temperature immediately after
defecation, as a "cold” reading will result.
In the Horse a stub or pear-shaped bulb thermometer
is preferable to the long bulb so commonly in vogue.
The diseases that the thermometer will assist in detect-
ing are: Febrile conditions such as Pneumonia, Blood
poisons, Sunstroke, Tetanus, Enteritis, and most Colics,
Strangles, Laryngitis, Influenza.
Should the temperature on the other hand be lower
than normal it is spoken of as "Collapse” and may be
2-deg. to 4-deg. below normal and to be regarded as a
bad sign.
TREMBLING : TREMORS.
Usually seen in various parts of the body and may be
indicative of the onset of an attack of a febrile disease
such as Pneumonia, Lymphangitis, or Shivering, Internal
Haemorrhage, such as burst blood vessel, over the site
of a fracture after injury, or after shock.
URINATION.
An increased quantity of urine occurs in Diabetes, some
diseases of the Kidneys, in the first and last stages of
fever. Decrease of the amount occurs in the acute stages
of fever and in some Kidney diseases, Dropsy and
Diarrhoea.
Partial or complete cessation of urine may be caused
by some diseases of the spine (paralysis), kidneys,
17
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


bladder, e.g., stone in bladder, complete retention may
lead to severe complications and death.
Blood in urine occurfs in acute inflammations or injury
by stone or gravel of kidneys and bladder. It may occur
in diseases, e.g., Anthrax, Purpura Haemorrhagica,
Azoturia or poisons, e.g., Mineral Turpentine.
Normal urine is turbid, yellowish white or brownish
in colour, and of aromatic odour.
VISIBLE MUCOUS MEMBRANES.
Are the membranes lining the eye, nostrils, mouth and
vulva (female); these should be moist and of a salmon
pink colour. If they are dry it is symptomatic of a febrile
disease especially in the early stages, e.g.. Influenza.
In catarrhal diseases they will discharge mucous
varying in consistency from watery to thick pus or blood,
e.g., Pink Eye (Influenza), Gleet, Catarrh, Strangles.
Variations in the colour of Mucous Membrane is impor-
tant and may vary from a pallid hue, such as in Anaemia
or in severe haemorrhages, to a dull brick red (injected)
such as in poisons and fevers.
In some cases they are bluish such as in bad circulation
and strangulation, pneumoina or in new born foals. In
diseases as Jaundice, Azoturia and Congestion of the Liver
the colour will vary from a pallid yellow to a guinea gold.
When the membranes become spotted with blood
(petechia) and may be severely inflamed, this indicates
Purpura haemorrhagica or other acute febrile diseases.

III.—MANAGEMENT OF SICK HORSE.
A sick horse should be isolated, placed in a loose,
clean box with plenty of bedding. Should be provided
with plenty of fresh air and clean water. II the weather
is cold rug him. If the horse is down a long period
of time it should be slung, or if impracticable, turn him
over two or three times a day to avoid bed-sores. It is
preferable to feed a sick animal several times a day in
small portions.
The following food should be avoided in fevered
conditions: Oats, beans, peas, as they increase the acidity
of the blood and may upset important internal organs,
e.g., kidneys.
Common food indicated for sick Horses is:
1. Bran mash which is bran mixed with boiling water
and allowed to stand. WTen cool give after stirring
again.
2. Bran and linseed mash. Boil 1-lb. of linseed in
3 quarts of water for three minutes, add 2-lb. of bran,
stir and give when cool.
3. Oatmeal porridge.
4. Oatmeal gruel.
5. Linseed tea.
6. Hay Tea.
7. Boiled barley.
<°>. Greenstuff, carrots, turnips.
BALLING.
Usually required when the horse is to be physiced,
but is also carried out for other medicinal applications in
bolus form. Is carried out by the hattid or balling gun
with or without the aid of a gag. The latter is more
advisable, especially to obviate laceration of the hand.
The Balling gun should be guarded so that no injury
may result to the palate of the animal,
19
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


In the act of balling the horse should be haltered and
stood with his posterior to the wall, the attendant placing
the left hand over the bridge of the nose to prevent the
animal throwing the head too high, whilst the operator,
taking a good grip of the tongue in the left hand, and
at the same time keeping the mouth open by placing the
thumb of the same hand in the roof of the horse’s mouth,
he gently inserts the ball over the back of the tongue
where it is deposited; the gun is withdrawn and the tongue
released simultaneously.
Before physicing a horse he should be well prepared
by mashing 24 hours beforehand, and whilst physicing
care should be taken that he is kept warm, does not
receive excessive quantities of drinking water, nor is
worked for 48 hours at least afterwards.
BANDAGING.
Commonly used as a protection to a sore, cut, or wound,
is a support to an injured or swollen part; to promote
healing and prevent infection. Materials are gauze, cotton
wool, lint, calico, crepes, etc. In every case the material
is to be clean and sterile.
When the intention is to immobilise the part, then the
bandage is reinforced with splints, plaster of paris, pitch
or any such materials. When bandaging a limb, the
bandage should be applied so as not to impede circulation
and with this in view the bandage should be commenced
below and applied up the leg and each bandage should
be taken off the part massaged and readjusted once or
twice daily.
BLEEDING.
This method of treating certain ailments is still to be
regarded as a valuable adjunct, especially in acute
Laminitis, acute Colic with congestion and as a mode of
ridding the body of toxins or poisons in as expeditious
manner as possible.
The bleeding is carried out, using fleams at the jugular
vein, in the groove at the side of the neck. It should be
carried out by an expert.

POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


BLISTERING.
Blistering is the strong counter-irritation of a part, by
the application of some irritant medicinal substance.
Its uses are many and the commoner are here given.
In broken down, badly sprained tendons, ligaments, joints,
bony swelling, e.g., splints, in abscesses to bring to a
head, in Laryngitis, Laminitis. Blistering should be
avoided in acute inflammatory conditions such as a highly
inflamed joint with heat; these conditions should be
reduced before blistering. Do not blister large areais of
the body nor more than two legs of a horse at the same
time, nor when a horse is in physic.
To blister a horse it is best carried out early in the
morning, especially during the hot months and on an
empty stomach. Food may be given while the blister is
acting. Clip away superfluous hair from the part before
blistering and clean the skin. Tie the horse’s head up
whilst the action of the blister lasts to prevent him rubbing
or biting the part.
Apply the White Ointment to the spot 24 hours after
blistering or to any part which has become accidentally
blistered.
DOCKING.
Docking is the removal of several joints of the dock
or tail. It varies with the breed, but is not so commonly
practised now as formerly. It should be carried out by
an expert under control of an anaesthetic, as Tetanus is
a common sequel.
DRENCHING.
Drenching is the veterinary term for administering a
dose of medicine by mouth to the horse, and is most
commonly done with the aid of drenching bit—the more
correct and safest method. The drenching bit with the
straight bit is preferable to the bent mouth piece, especi-
ally in young horses. Others prefer the circular rearing
bit and syringe. This method is suitable also, but what-
ever method is used the horse should be allowed ample
time to swallow each mouthful before the next is added
21
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONAftV


to the mouth. If the head is pulled up a little above
the horizontal plane the swallowing process is not handi-
capped and the medicine flows down the gullet instead
of running out onto the doser or the ground.
However, if these simple rules are followed out,
drenching will be found to be safe.
ENEMA.
Enema is a douche into the rectum to help evacuation
of hard masses of manure in stoppage, constipation, e.g.,
Foals, or dealing with the seat wormls.
There are also nutritive enemas used to nourish a weak
animal in certain types of disease which would preclude
an animal eating or nourishing itself by the mouth.
The other types of enema are usually composed of
hot soap suds, or hot water and glycerine (1 gallon water
to cupful of glycerine) and injected into the rectum by
syringe or by gravitation with a funnel fitted to j-in. hose-
pipe (about 3 feet long) and the funnel to be held higher
than the horse’s back, the hose inserted into the rectum
and the enema fluid to be poured into the funnel.
In douching the vagina or womb the same equipment
is to be used together with a mild, but effective disin-
fectant in the water.
FIRING.
Actual Cautery is the application of heated firing irons
to weakened or strained joints and tendons or ossifying
enlargements.
The two main types are Pin Point and Line or Feather
firing.
Firing may be followed up immediately by a bliister such
as Newmarket Blister 10 to 14 days after the lodine
Plaster should be applied. Usually the horse is to be
rested 3 to 6 months after firing, according to the degree
of the breakdown.
In other horse breeding countries it is commonly used
in young colts or yearlings to strengthen weakly con-
formed joints ever before the animal is put to work.
22
LOTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


FOMENTATION AND POULTICES.
Fomentation is application of hot water sometimes
containing antiseptic and soothing agents, by means of
a saturated piece of cloth or flannel.
Poultices are soft, thermal, moist materials used as a
medium of applying heat over a prolonged period to an
injured or diseased portion of the body or extremities.
They are regarded as emollients and drawing agents.
Fomentations and Poultices commonly in deep
punctured wounds, abscesses, bruises, sprains and strains,
acute inflammations, injured, pricked, or staked hooves.
Linseed Meal or Bran, mixed with enough boiled water
to make a thick paste and then thoroughly applied to the
affected part with wrappings, which are waterproof and
retain the heat, give excellent results.
HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS.
The hypodermic syringe is ever playing a more
important part in the combating and the treatment of
disease, e.g., Anti-tetanus serum, Strangles vaccine. Everv
modern farm or breeding estate should carry a handy
sized syringe, i.e., 10 c.c. and several needles. The
modern instrument is easily sterilized and kept clean.
The needles should be of moderate calibre about 1-in.
to 11,-in.I 1 , -in. long.
The syringe should be sterilized before use by placing
in cold water and gradually bringing up to the boil or
an efficient and simple method in the field is to clean out
with methylated spirits.
To make a Hypodermic Injection a site about midway
down the neck is chosen, the spot cleaned with methy-
lated spirits or tincture of iodine and then the needle is
plunged through the skin and the injection made slowly.
Close the puncture in the skin after removing the needle
by digital pressure.
To make an Intravenous Injection the most convenient
site is the Jugular vein. The vein is to be ligatured by
tying a rope around the base of the neck tight enough to
cord the vein, cleanse the site with methylated spirits,
23
POTTIES INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


plunge the needle into the vein, whence blood will flow
freely through the needle; then remove the ligature and
proceed with the injection slowly. Evacuate all air
bubbles from the syringe before making the injection
An Intramuscular Injection is made into the muscles
of the neck or shoulder, observing above precautions.
RESTRAINT.
Methods for controlling an animal whilst operations,
clipping, or adjustments are being made on a horse are
varied in their application. They are blindfolding, use
of winkers, twitch stick to nose or ear, strapping up a
fore foot, side-lines, or hobbles, craddle, e.g., blistering,
crush. .' . '' >
The commonest and perhaps most effective is the
twitch to the upper lip or ear.
SHOEING.
From ancient times the horse has been shod with iron
to protect the hoof on long journeys or in doing fast or
hard work. In shoeing a horse a few cardinal facts
should be kept in mind. The hoof is to be level so as
not to disturb the normal balance of the animal; the frog
should come in contact with the ground after the hoof
it fitted with the shoe. The shoe should press on the
wall (ground surface) of the hoof but never on the sole.
Nails should not press on the sensitive membranes under-
lying the hoof wall. All these and other points are to
be observed in creating comfort to the shod hoof.
In diseased or abnormal hooves many and varied types
of shoes have been used and some of the commonest are
here illustrated.
SLINGING.
Horses do not make progress whilst in the recumbent
position for periods longer than 48 hours, and if possible,
it is always preferable to sling the horse, rather than
allow him to remain down.
Slinging is recommended in paralysis, injuries, frac-
tures, extreme debility. The sling under the belly and
strappings should be adjusted so as to avoid constant
24
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


A feather-edged shoe.
To prevent “brushing”
and cutting.
A hunter fore shoe, con-
cave and with single
fuller.
A bar shoe.
A threequarter shoe.
Commonly used in shoeing horses with
corns and contracted heels.
An anti knuckling
with projecting
or toe-piece.
This shoe is used
for hunters in
muddy, swampy
country. To prevent
“over-reaching”
and “clacking.”
shoe Rocker-bar shoe for
beak chronic laminitis.
A rolled-toe shoe.
Commonly used to relieve
stumbling, strained ten-
dons, or strain in long
pastern animals. To
assist the balance.
25
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


pressure causing chafes and bed sores on the skin. After
24 hours in them the horse soon adapts himself to their
use.
STEAMING.
Inhalation is carried out to relieve nasal catarrh or
discharge. The underlying idea is to cause the animal
to inhale medicated steam over the affected nasal mem-
branes and the mask is either a small sack or even a wide
mouthed bucket; the nostrils are to be kept in the steam
current for a few minutes; the length of time depending
on the strength of the inhalation. Straw saturated with
boiling water is placed in the bottom of the mask, the
medicine as inhalant, is poured onto the straw and then
the mask is placed over the nostrils, for as long as
necessary.
Subsequent to steaming in cold weather, care must be
taken to avoid further chills, draughts, and so relapse,
which will be certainly worse to treat.
Medicines commonly used are Eucalyptus, Friar’s
Balsam, Menthol, or a combination of these.
STITCHING : SUTURING.
In the horse this is to be used in cases of jagged open
wounds which have occurred in such a position as would
allow this adjustment.
It can be relied on to staunch haemorrhage and pro-
mote the more rapid healing of a wound.
If the wound occurs in a moveable part, then stitching
will not confer much benefit, as the horse by constant
motion tends to tear out the stitches. In this case the
wound should not be sutured but treated and healed as
an open wound. With effective modern remedies this can
be soon accomplished.
Where it is decided to suture a wound, first of all
cleanse with Healing Oil, or Carbolic Oil, or weak tinc-
ture of lodine. Chinese silk thread, tape, or catgut, is to
be recommended as the suturing material, whilst a flesh
or surgical needle will enable the stitcher to perforate
the skin the more easily. Adopt hygienic precautions.

Lime and Lime Water. Unslacked lime is very valu-
able as a controller of diseases in general. It should be
frequently scattered about the steadings and yards. It is
valuable as a pasture renovator and the best boned horses
come from limestone country. Lime Water is made by
boiling water and adding unslacked lime to it in these
proportions (1 lime to 700 water) and allowing to stand
12 hours. The clear fluid should be slowly decanted off
and is the lime water. Lime water mixed with equal
parts of Raw Linseed Oil gives Carron Oil, used for burns.

V. GENERAL.
HEREDITARY UNSOUNDNESS.
These are regarded with disfavor, especially in the
Stallion, and now a Stallion is prohibited from breeding
by the Stallion Act, 1940, if he displays any of the
following unsoundnesses:—
Cataract. Ringbone, Navicular Disease.
Roaring (Whistling). Sidebones.
Defective Genital Organs. Splints in Blood Breeds.
Bone Spavin. Shivering, Stringhalt.
In the light of present knowledge as the result of
recent research it may be proved that these unsoundnesses
are due to certain deficiencies in rations and the horse’s
system.
In selecting a stallion or brood mare, all these defects
should be borne in mind. The degree of importance of
certain of these unsou'ndnesses vary in the Blood and
Draught Breeds, although they remain as unsoundnesses
in any breed.
Th is code is not strictly adhered to in examining
working draught geldings. They pass under an easier
test, viz.: for general working soundness.
These standards are maintained in nearly all Agricul-
tural shows, and especially so in the Royal'and Yearling
Sales and Agricultural Department certificate of sound-
ness. f ; : 1 i *! ■c 11 !’| '

Treatment : In haemorrhage, stop bleeding. Rectify
diet; feed carrot and greenstuffs; blood tonic. (See
worms.)
ANTHRAX.
Cause: Bacillus of Anthrax; acute blood poison. Con-
tagious to man as well as our domesticated animals. Blood
from infected animals is contagious even after many
years; pastures and soils become contaminated —therefore
burn all carcases and discharges from the body, fleeces
and hides. It is dangerous to open or skin animals
affected.
Symptoms : Germ gains access by mouth or blood
stream. Colicy pains, uneasiness, high temperature.
Swelling about head, throat and chest.
Treatment : Case usually terminates fatally in 2 to 8
hours. Isolate all in-contacts. Do not open nor skiin
carcases, but burn everything. Notify your Veterinarian
immediately. Preventive measures in affected districts
is best, and is implemented by vaccination.

pass catheter if necessary.
BLEEDERS.
A term commonly applied to any horse which bleeds
or sneezes out c’ots of blood, from the nostrils, usually
shortly after work or exercise.
Cause: May be due to a form of Nasal Catarrh; a
certain condition of the blood mav be the indirect cause.
High pressure in blood vessels with rupture.
Treatment: In the cases due to Catarrh is Cough
Paste before working. Exercise horse in warmer air. The
other type may be treated with a Laxative Drench

Tonic; in some of these cases we recommend. "Bleeding,”
but the Urine should be tested by a Vet. Surgeon before
adopting this measure.
BLEEDING. See General Inform,ation.
This operation is carried out by letting the blood from
the Jugular vein with a Fleam or lance, observing all
hygienic precautions. As much as a gallon of blood can
be taken.
BLOOD BLISTER,
Is a soft filling under the skin, due to bruising of hips
or thighs; sometimes it may happen that the injury may
take place in the groin. The bruising may be caused by
a kick, but very often a horse may slip on the road and
fall, hurting the thigh. Very shortly afterwards a blub-
bery swelling appears.
Treatment: Cold compresses. After 2 or 3 days of
this treatment the blister should be lanced and the fluid
drained off. Syringe out with Healing Oil daily till
healed.
BOG. SPAVIN.
A puffy swelling on the front and to the inner aspect
of the hock at the point of flexion.
Symptoms: Horse may show no lameness; a distention
of hock joint capsule containing synovia or joint oil.

Treatment: Blister well, after 10 days apply lodine
Plaster. Rest. Actual Cautery in bad cases. Rest 3 to
6 months.
BOILS, PIMPLES, FURUNCULOSIS.
Pustular inflammation of skin (hair follicles). If small
superficial it is called Pimples, if deeper seated isolated
they are called Boils; if appearing in crops are called
Furuncles.
Symptoms: Hot, painful, surrounded by zone of
inflammation. When mature, has a yellow point in the
centre which bursts,
39
POTTIE’S indexed horse dictionary


Treatment: Hot antiseptic poultices or fomentations.
If mature, lancing and strong disinfectant. In stubborn
cases, mild Merc. Biniodide Ointment, follow with White
Ointment.
BONE SPAVIN.
A small bony enlargement situated on the inner lower
aspect of the hock or towards the front.
Causes: Heredity, concussion, bad conformation of
the hock or bad shoeing, rheumatism, injury.
Symptoms: Patient goes very lame when starting off.
Carries the affected
hindquarter lower
than the sound one.
Carries the toe low
to the ground.
Bony enlargement
may or may not be
visible.
Treatment: Apply
hot vinegar for 14
days, by bru s h,
then blister the
enlarged parts once
with Red Blister.
Firing has good
results. Rest for 3
to 6 months.
Bone Spavin.
BOTRIOMYCOSIS. See Collar Tumour (Scirrhus
Cord).
BOTS (Bot Fly).
The fly attaches creamy coloured eggs to the hairs of
legs, jowl and shoulders. About February and March
the larvae gain access to the horse’s mouth, when it licks
or bites. They attach to the mucous membrane of the
stomach. If in large numbers will penetrate the stomach,
giving rise to peritonitis and death.
Symptoms: Horse is unthrifty, dry hacking cough
when worked; passes an occasional pupa in the dung.

Treatment: On empty stomach give Bot Ball or Gas
Bomb and an hour later administer Laxative Drench or
Physic Ball. Apply Vermin Powder to the eggs exter-
nally.
BOTULISM (Forage Poisoning).
By stock, eating fodder that is contaminated by vermin,
chewing, or eating bones and carcases of dead animals,
e.g., rabbits. Toxins is cause.
Symptoms: Colicky pains, distension of abdomen with
nervous or brainy symptoms; staggers; involuntary twitch-
ing* and paralysis.
Treatment: Remove cause. Change feed and water.
Purgatives, e.g., Physic ball or Laxative Drench with Colic
Drench.
BROKEN KNEES.
Broken knees vary in degrees from a grazed surface
with contusion, to deep lacerations exposing the bones of
the knee, caused by a horse slipping and falling on the
hard, slippery macadamised roads.
Treatment is to wash away gravel or dirt with weak
antiseptic solution. Apply Healing Oil and dust on the
Antiseptic Powder afterwards. Repeat twice daily. Keep
the horse quiet, and on light diet,
t
Many horses are left with disfigured knees if not given
proper attention very quickly.
In valuable animals it is a safeguard to have an anti-
tetanic preventive dose given within 48 hours of receiving
the injury.
BROKEN WIND.
Respiratory trouble chiefly of the Draught breeds.
Disruption of certain tissues of the lungs.
Symptoms; Short, chronic, hollow, weakly coughs,
especially at night. Noticeable double lift of the flanks
with each expiration.
42
pottiE’S indexed horse diCti6nary


Treatment: If old, chronic case, incurable. Laxative
Drench followed by Cough Mixture. Rest off work. Feed
always with rich concentrated feeds, small in quantity.
Never let horse go to work on full stomach or bulky
feed, e.g., hay. Greenstuff, carrots.
BRONCHITIS.
Cause: Chill; may follow Laryngitis, Influenza or
Catarrh.
Symptoms: Painful, lungy cough, early stages no nasal
discharge; off food; feverish.
Treatment: Isolate, keep warm, fresh air, no draughts
nor sudden changes in temperature, plenty fresh water.
Clothe warmly, mustard plgster on chest and throat in
early stages, or rub with Liniment—Laxative Drench—
use Cough Mixture.
BURNS (Scalds).
Burns are injuries caused by dry heat, scalds by moist
heat.
Symptoms: Both are very painful. If very extensive
may cause shock, weakness, muscular trembling, loss of
appetite, and high fever.
Treatment: Apply linseed oil mixed with lime water
in equal parts. Use the White Ointment or Chafe Heal.
If affecting a large surface of the body, more than one-
third, the chances of recovery are very remote and it
would be kinder to destroy the animal immediately,
especially so if any of the vital organs have become
involved.
CANCER (Malignant).
Origin and cause of the disease unknown at present.
Arises in all parts of the body, manifesting itself as new
fungus-like growth attacking bone, cartilage, or flesh;
thriving on the body equally as well internally as
externally.
43
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


The original or first lesion is known as the primary,
whilst its progeny or offshoots in any other part of the
body are known as the secondary.
Generally speaking Cancer is regarded as incurable;
the surgeon’s skill is the surest combatant and then only
when the growth is in a favourable situation for an opera-
tion and taken early. Cancerous growths are frequently
encountered on the Haw or 3rd Eyelid; these should be
taken away as soon as they are noticed. Even growths
can be removed from the surface of the eye.
'''Mole” like growths on grey horses often give rise to
malignant cancers if not removed early. If the cancer
is in an advanced stage the animal should not be subjected
to more suffering and should be destroyed.
CANKER.
Cause: An affection of the foot caused by unhygienic
conditions. May start as Thrush on the frog and spread
to the sole and even wall of hoof. Fungoid growth;
bleeding easily; dirty, wet stables.
Symptoms: Horse is lame, irritable or sore about the
foot; foetid offensive discharge.
Treatment: If neglected it spreads rapidly. While not
contagious, still every precaution should be observed to
prevent its spread to other animals in the stable. If
extremely bad, destroy the animal; otherwise physic and
give Blood Tonic internally night and morning. Cut
away defunct horn about the growth frequently, observ-
ing to make the Canker bleed as little as possible. Dress
daily with strong antiseptic. If horse is working use a
leather foot protector to sole.
CAPPED ELBOW.
Symptoms: Hard lump formed on point of elbow.
May be painful; caused by bruising from lying on heel
of shoe.
44
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: Core
out with the Coring-
out Crystals. Allow
Crystal to remain in
for 8 days before re-
moving Core. After-
wards inject into the
wound. Remove the
shoe and pad the
heels. Has been cured
with hot foments and
vigorous massaging
with Liniment.
Pad to prevent Capped Elbow
CAPPED HOCK.
Symptoms: A hard or soft swelling on the point of
the hock. Caused by an injury; often kicking hard object
with point of hock.
Treatment: If soft, treat with repeated applications of
Mild Blister. If hard, massage with hot vinegar once
daily for two weeks and follow up with Red Blister and
especially the lodine Plaster.
CASTRATION : Complications.
The operation is performed either in the standing or
recumbent position. Horse should be without food or
water for 24 hours previous to the operation. Oil the
sheath before castration and apply the White Ointment
about the purse after the operation. Should pains develop
later administer a Colic Drench; also a Laxative Drench
if horse has not been physiced beforehand. Allow plenty
of green stuff and laxative diet for 2 or 3 days.
A complication that may develop commonly is excessive
oedematous, swelling of the sheath and purse.
Treatment: Cleanse the fingers and open up the
incisions in the purse to allow drainage. Syringe with
our Healing Oil; foment the sheath and then massage
with our White Ointment daily. Physic the horse if it
45
LOTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE faICfIONARY


has not been done already. Other complications may be
Tetanus, Peritonitis, Scirrhus Cord, Haemorrhage and
Hernia. (See under separate headings.)
CATARACT of the Eye.
An opacity of the Crystalline lens in the centre of the
eyeball; lying deep to the transparent external membrane
or cornea; the lens becomes cloudy or white. In well
established cases the eye is blind and incurable; it is
considered to be hereditary.
Physic and use the Kidney and Bladder powders. Keep
the horse on a laxative diet in a dark stable for 3 days.
Apply for our Specialised treatment also.
CATARRH.
Inflammation of the lining (mucous) membranes of
nose, nasal sinuses, throat, wind tube and evein other
organs may be involved.
Symptoms: Usually a mucous discharge from nostrils
with painful, harsh cough and pain in swallowing. May
become chronic; predisposing to cause "bleeding” in
racehorses.
Treatment; Laxative Drench, follow on with Cough
Paste or Mixture; keep warm and well clothed; light
application about the throat with Mild Blister or rub with
Liniment daily. No work till better; work in warmer air;
feed from manger placed on floor.
CLEANSING of the Mare.
Removing afterbirth from Mare after foaling.
The foaling membranes should come away from the
womb naturally, shortly after or at the time of foaling
If they do not come away within two or three hours of
foaling then they should be removed. Take weak disin-
fectant, warm water and soap. Wash the arms, the mare’s
bearing and soap the arm. Insert the hand gently per
vagina and by careful manipulation detach the membranes
46
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


from the surface of the womb, taking care to remove
every vestige. Insert a Uterine Pessary and administer a
Laxative Drench. Apply for specific treatment to
veterinary surgeon.
COLIC : GRIPES.
Cause; Stoppage of bowels, impaction, acute indiges-
tion, fermentation.
Symptoms: Acute or subacute pain, sweating, rolling
up and down frequently; uneasy; may look round at sides
and flanks indicating seat of pain; paws; bowels and
bladder cease functioning; the fact that he does not pass
water is commonly attributed to "Water Gripes,” which
is very rare; bowels may function spasmodically, passing
only small quantities of dung.
Treatment: In Common Gripes use Gripe and Laxative
Drenches. Repeat the Colic Drench in 2 hours if neces-
sary, Copious hot soap sud enemas; massage abdomen
with Liniment; allow horse plenty of room and soft
ground or bedding to roll in.
A reliable Colic Drench in case of emergency is:
Spirits of Turpentine—2 tablespoonsful.
Whisky—l teacupful.
Ground Ginger—l tablespoonful.
Raw Linseed Oil—l pint.
Other diseases simulating Colic are; Anthrax, diseases
of the Liver, Pneumonia, Peritonitis, Stones in bowels or
kidneys, Large numbers of parasitic worms, Enteritis or
Enteric Fever. (See under separate heading.)
COLLAR TUMOURS.
Symptoms; Hard swelling in the collar groove about
the point of the shoulder. Appears rather quickly; caused
by a germ, Botriomycosis.
Treatment: Core out with Coring Crystals. Remove
core in 6 to 8 days. Inject with Strong Antiseptic daily
after removing core. Blood Tonic internally.
47
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


CONCUSSION.
Cause: Due to a blow about the brain box or vital
parts of the head.
Symptoms: Animal is semi-comatose; upper eyelids are
dropped; holds head at a peculiar angle; pain on moving
neck, etc.; tongue may hang out; lips sag; blowing.
Treatment: Keep in quiet, dark box; laxative diet;
later absorbing medicine internally; Liniment or ice packs
externally about seat of injury.
CONSTIPATION.
Cause: Too much concentrated foods, dry diet, indi-
gestion, journeys by train, boat or float, liver derange-
ments, chills of liver and bowel.
Symptoms: Familiar to everyone; faeces dry and
difficult to evacuate. In Foals at birth it is especially
dangerous if neglected.
Treatment: Physic or Laxative Drench. Also Epsom
and Glauber Salts dissolved in warm water will give
temporary relief; warm enemas in bad cases. l!n young
foals at birth, use warm water and glycerine as enema
(one part of glycerine—B parts warm water). Also
administer slowly by mouth 4-oz. Castor Oil.
CONTRACTED HOOF.
Rather more common than realised amongst Blood
Stock. More in front than behind; goes short and propy;
shape of hoof alters, may be donkey footed.
Cause: Heredity; bad shoeing; for example, rasping
away heels and not allowing frog to come in contact with
the ground; extreme dry conditions; founder or laminitis;
seedy toe; corns.
Treatment: Dress the Coronary band with our Hoof
Ointment daily to grow a sound wall and hoof. Eradicate
cause. Apply to us for further particulars if necessary.

Normal Hoof and Contracted Hoof.
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.
Anthrax, Glanders and Farcy, Epizootic Lymphangitis,
Parasitic Mange, Contagious Influenza and Pneumonia,
Strangles, Rabies, Tuberculosis, Contagious Abortion,
Joint or Navel 111.
Should any of these diseases become apparent, immedi-
ately isolate the affected animal from all others until
proper veterinary aid may be secured.
CORNS.
The seat of Corns are in the heels of the hoof, between
the bars and wall; either one or both hooves are affected
in front and usually the inside heel of the hoof.
Is a common cause of lameness, which increases when
the horse is going down hill or is turned quickly or
shortly. The horse flinches to pressure with pinchers
over the spot. If of recent origin the corn is red; old
standing corns become infiltrated and suppurate.
Cause: Shape of some horse’s heels predispose to
corns; bad shoeing; leaving heels of shoes too short;
shoes being left on too long.
49
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: Remove the shoe; pare down over the
corn; cut out the bars and their "oyster shell” appendage;
repeat this at each successive shoeing and stress this point
to your farrier; don’t cut down the heel wall. Rub around
the coronet each day with Mild Blister until blisters; plug
up the crevice whence the corn has been removed with
cotton wool soaked in antiseptic. In cases of suppurating
corn syringe out daily with antiseptic in addition to the
above treatment. Replace shoes whe*i all soreness has
gone.
CORONITIS.
Symptoms: Inflammatory swelling of the Coronet of
the hoof due to an injury or acute condition of the hoof,
e.g., poisoned hoof. Horse is very lame and pain is
intense. Swelling extends right around the hoof and
overlaps in some cases the top of the hoof. Hoof may
appear to be parting with the softer structures beneath.
Treatment: Recovery slow. Physic, and sling animal.
Soothe with White Ointment; lance if necessary.
A—Curb.
CURB.
Symptoms: Sprained ligament imme-
diately at the back and at the base of
the hock. May be due to badly shaped
hocks or strain. Considered heredi-
tary, unsoundness. Typical hock
lameness; bow in the ligament when
examined from the lateral aspect.
Treatment: Fire and then blister,
later applying lodine Plaster. Rest
for 3 to 6 months. Sickle shaped
hocks are considered to be predis-
posing factors.
50
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


DIABETES (Polyurea).
Cause: Horse wastes in condition although doing well
at the manger. Caused by mouldy, musty oats or fer-
mented chaff, hay or fodder.
Symptoms; Horse becomes weakened; coat harsh and
standing; floods in his stall with frequent clear emissio'ns
of urine of aromatic odour.
Treatment: If in doubt forward a clean, fresh sample
(6-oz.) of urine to use for analysis and report. Take away
grain; allow damp bran and chaff (oaten); plenty green-
stuff; administer a Laxative Drench and follow up with
Diabetes Medicine; and do not overwork as remember
horse is in a weak state. Do not physic. Sugar Diabetes
is uncommon in our horses.
DIARRHOEA: Purging.
Causes: Frequent watery evacuations; musty feed,
wheat, chills, overdriving, weeds, debility and poisons are
all poslsible causes.
Symptoms: May be indications of pain; purging does
not abate; horse is thirsty, but no appetite; feverish.
Treatment: Colic Drench or Laxative Drench, followed
up by Astringent Diarrhoea Powders. A cupful of Brandy
or Port Wine; Glucose.
DYSENTERY.
Cause: Purging with bloody colouration; blood may
form almost a total percentage of the evacuations. Caused
by eating foreign substances, poisons, poisonous weeds
or neglected bowel complaints; worms; sewerage contam-
ination of water.
Symptoms: Horse is dejected, loses strength and
condition quickly; bloody flux; or very dark brown
motions; pain.
Treatment: Colic Drench mixed in a Laxative Drench;
follow up with Diarrhoea Powders and Arrowroot gruels.
No solid foods until quite recovered; greenstuff; fresh
boiled water.
51
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


ECZEMA.
Cause is usually digestive disorders (allergy); unhy-
gienic conditions; kidneys and nerves; blood impurities;
dry or moist; Trefoil.
Symptoms: Redness, heat and soreness of skin; irrita-
tion; itchiness; rubbing.
Treatment: Apply Sulphur Ointment or Sulphur
Wash externally, with Blood Tonic internally, and physic.
Remove cause if known.
ENTERITIS.
Inflammation of lining membrane of bowels, caused
by chill to bowels, bad feeding; contaminated water; or
neglected case of colic.
Symptoms: Dull, colicy pains; off feed; pains become
more intense and insistent; high temperature.
Treatment: Bleed from Jugular vein (see general
information), Colic Drench; allow only light laxative
diet, plenty greenstuff, fresh, clean tepid water in winter.
Table of Differential Diagnosis between
ENTERITIS, Symptoms. COLIC: GRIPES.
(Inflammation of Bowels.)
1. Pulse quick and small.
2. Lies down carefully;
rises suddenly again;
seldom rolling on back.
3. Legs and ears cold.
4. As a rule attacks gradu-
ally and is preceded and
attended by feverish
symptoms.
5. Pain is continuous.
6. Frequent, small, mucous-
coated quantities of
manure passed with pain.
1. Pulse nearer the normal,
except during spasms.
2. Prostrates carelessly and
rolls on back.
3. Extremities; generally
warm.
4. Attacks suddenly; never
preceded by fever.
5. Frequent intermissions
of pain.
6. No motion of bo\vel§.
52
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


ENTERIC FEVER.
Cause: Low form of bowel fever, caused by bowel
infection from drinking contaminated water or eating
unsuitable feed.
Symptoms. Are those of Enteritis only m a modified
form, together with costiveness, followed by foul smellin-
evacuations from the bowel.
Treatment: Give medicinal remedies as for Enteritis.
EYE (Ophthalmia). Diseases of the Eye.
Causes: Among the commonest causes are injuries
from blows, falls or presence of dust, and pieces of chaff
or corn husks, flies or worms. In some cases it is an
infection with a specific germ.
Symptoms: At first redness and swelling of the lining
membrane of the eye is noticed. Discharge of tears, and
the animal keeps the eye shut. The eye is sensitive to
light and pain extreme. In more severe cases the dis-
charge becomes thicker, more pus like, blisters the skin
and mats the hair together. If the cornea is injured,
the surface of the eye will be duller from a haze to a
dense opacity. In some cases a small projection varying
from a pin’s head up to the size of a pea is protruding
from the surface. Sometimes the injury is deep and the
inflammation involves the whole eye.
Treatment: If caused by a foreign body it must be
instantly removed. It is a delicate operation and should
be done by a Veterinary Surgeon. Bathing in warm water
cleans away the discharge. Use eye lotion in combination
with the white ointment. If pain is severe use the Pain-
less Eye Drops. Use Eye Wash in a teaspoonful of
Boracic Acid to a cupful of warm water. Castor Oil is
soothing to an inflamed eye.
FEVER.
Is indicated by high temperature and usually thirst and
quick pulse; trembling.

size of 3d. Repeat operation on other side if necessary.
Plug with tow.
Remove the cores in 7 to 8 days and then commence
injecting Strong Antiseptic till the wounds have dried up.
During treatment the animal must be stable fed and
watered out of a high manger; keep the head up as much
as possible. Operation may need repeating. Restrain
with twitch while treating. Apply for specific or surgical
treatment to a Veterinary Surgeon,
54
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


FITS.
May be due to old injury to head; Megrin,s, aftermath
of Bastard Strangles, Sunstroke, and emotional influences
on a highly strung, nervy animal. Treatment is found
under the respective headings.
FOALING.
This is a natural function of the mare and should be
regarded as such. A mare in foal may be asked to do
light duties with benefit to her general health up to a
week or so of her due date. Her period is 11 months,
which may vary a week either more or less without any
ill effect to the foal or mare. About the time of foaling
the mare should be given a Laxative Drench. She will
foal providing everything is normal, very quickly, com-
pared with the cow. The normal presentation of the
foal is the fore-feet coming first with the head lying
between them.
The mare should cleanse at the foaling or shortly after;
if she d oes not make a clean shift within three hours of
birth then the afterbirth should be carefully removed,
and then given a mild antiseptic douche, and Insert a
Uterine Pessary, leaving it to carry on the work of
keeping down sepsis. It must be borne in mind that a
mare is very susceptible to septicaemia, and every hygienic
precaution should be adopted in working with a foaling
mare as a preventive measure.
In cases where the foal is not presented normally, inter-
ference must be made quickly and with the idea of
getting the youngster into a normal position before
delivery can be made.
Untoward sequelae are metritis or inflammation of the
womb and laminitis or founder, with the soles of the hoof
dropping and in many cases the bone of the hoof pene-
trates the sole, necessitating the mare’s destruction (see
Founder).
In normal deliveries the mare is "in season” again from
the 3rd to 7th day and should be served if it is desired
to breed her the following year.

FOALS, Diseases Of.
Joint or Navel 111, Constipation, Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea—Treatment: Give mare a dose of our Laxa-
tive Drench; 4-oz. Castor Oil to foal; following with
repeated doses of Port Wine (1 dessertspoonful every
three hours) till improved.
Hernia (Navel and Inguinal).

FOUNDER ; Fevered Feet ; See Laminitis.
Inflammation of the sensitive membranes of the hoof;
acute or chronic; usually in the both fore hooves.
Symptoms: Lameness; may be very severe; animal
keeps off feet; refuses feed; results from overdriving
dulls, too rich food, wheat, colic or congestion of lungs,
56
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


or in mares after difficult foaling. In chronic form the
soles of the hoof drop aixl rings form around the wall.
Treatment: Bleed at the Jugular Vein immediately.
Remove shoes; Colic Drench and Laxative Drench, or
Posture in Laminitis of the Pore-feet.
Physic. Repeat Colic Drench if necessary; Blister around
the coronets with Mild Blister, Rasp down the front of
the wall of hoof till thin, to allow expansions within the
foot.
FRACTURES.
Generally speaking fractures of the bones of the limbs
or trunk in the horse are looked upon as incurable, owing
to the size, strength of bone, the unwieldiness of the parts
to be manipulated and set, the great opposing forces of
the powerful muscles, and in fact these are uncontrollable
excepting under a general anaesthetic; the severe pain
causes the horse to move or shift about even while in
slings, and this very fact militates against a sound union.
In nearly every case it is wisest to painlessly destroy the
animal.
In cases of undisplaced fractures or "greenstick” frac-
57
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


lures, recovery may be hoped for. Render the limb
immobile with splints, or bandages impregnated with
plaster of paris. A leather splint may be made to adapt
the part.
A note of warning is in place here in those cases where
a horse has been kicked on the uncovered inside portion
of the fore-arm or thigh bone, causing the horse lame-
ness. Throw the horse out of work for 2 or 3 weeks, and
blister the part with Mild Blister. Tie up the horse’s
head short, so that he may not lie down during this
period, otherwise the case may become a fracture.
GASTRITIS.
It is usually associated with young animals teething,
giving rise to Indigestion and Lampas.
Symptoms: Some sign<s of abdominal pains shortly
after feeding, fermentation, slight temperature.
Treatment: Give a Laxative Drench; give no grain in
feed; change on to light laxative diet. Teeth should be
given attention.
GLANDERS OR FARCY.
An infectious chronic disease. Characterised by copious
nasal discharge, also from the eyes, and ulcer-like sores
over the body; all body glands are enlarged. At present
not known in Australia. Contagious to Humans.
GRAIN POISON: Hyperacidosis: Allergy.
Supercharging of the blood with nitrogenous by-
products; found in racehorses which are heavily fed with
grain and other concentrates over a long period and not
given sufficient regular exercise to enable the system to
handle such heavy concentrations. The blood becomes
glutinous and impure, the circulation is impaired, the
oxygenation of the whole system is reduced below its
normal requirements.
The affected animal loses dash and stamina, "blows”
unnecessarily heavy, "shuts up,” thickens in the wind.
The urine test is diagnostic. Forward to our office a
58
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


morning and evening clean sample (6-oz.) and we can
make an analysis and give a report as to proper procedure
and treatment.
GRASS SICKNESS.
Disease amongst grass fed horses chiefly in Scotland
and North of England. Characterised by a general body
wasting in the chronic cases; colicy pains; tucked up. In
acute cases death soon occurs. Treatment is not suc-
cessful.
GREASE—Greasy Heels.
An eruptive disease of the skin at the back of the legs,
extending from the hoof and upwards about the pastern
and fetlock and may extend to the knee or hock; gener-
ally in the hind legs, but may affect the whole four. It
varies in degrees of severity from a moist, hot surface
with weeping at the back of the pastern to a copious
creamy exudation over a more enlarged surface in the
grosser bred animal. In the most advanced stage it is
commonly called "Grapes,” being identified by nodular,
fleshy lumps about the affected area of the leg.
Cause is chiefly a hereditary predisposition to a specific
blood disorder; thrushy feet; rich feeding in excess; filth
and bad management; bad shoeing.
Treatment: Keep the affected part dry. If the condi-
tion is localised about the fetlock, give White Ointment
in daily applications. Blood Tonic to be given internally.
Should the disease be constitutional, clip away the exces-
sive hair; clean away sebaceous exudation and use above
treatment and it should be varied with the Antiseptic
Powder. Internally, give a strong physic, bleed the horse
at the Jugular vein, taking about 4 quarts of blood. Give
green feed and soft laxative diet; reduce rich hard feed.
Grapes require the use of the knife and actual cautery.
GRIPES. See Colic.
GRUNTER.
Deep grunting or groaning sounds made by horse when
he suddenly starts, leaps, or rolls. The noise is made
when tested to the "stick.’ Grunting is considered by
59
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


many experts to be a direct indication of roaring and is
regarded with grave suspicions at examination. However,
the defect may never advance further than this stage
and may not evolve into the "Roarer.”
HAEMOALBUMENURIA. See Azoturia.
HEART, Diseases Of.
Uncommon in the horse. It can only be recognised by
the expert in life.
In Foals at birth a condition may arise in which the
foal is listless after birth, weak, circulation bad, blue
gums and tongue, death ensuing in from an hour to a
few days of birth.
Dilatation of the Heart is to be avoided by giving a
horse, recovering from a severe illness, a suitable, lengthy
spell. Expert advice should always be sought in such
cases. First aid treatment is suitable; stimulants, e.g.,
Whisky or Brandy in water. Dose, half cupful.
HERNIA.
Commonly understood to be the Protrusion of some
abdominal organ through a natural opening of the
muscle wall of the abdomen. Most common ones are:
Umbilical hernia or enlarged navel; common in foals.
Part of the bowel or omentum protrudes. Scrotal Hernia,
rupture of scrotum, or purse, mostly hereditary. Enlarged
scrotum. Difficult to castrate. Must be careful that the
bowel does not come through after operation. Inguinal
hernia found in the region of the groin. Hernia of dia-
phragm, very often cause of stricture of the bowel and
death follows.
Treatment of Umbilical Hernia in young foals. Apply
our Fly Blister to the swelling and then bandage up with
a many-tailed truss, made from chaff bag. Truss up
tightly and keep it on for a fortnight. The other Herbias
have to be treated surgically by the expert.
HYPODERMIC INJECTIONS. See General.
INFLAMMATION.
its cardinal characteristics are redness, heat, pain,
swelling and interference with the normal function and
60
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


blood circulation of any part of the body. The basic
idea in its treatment should be to assist the great healing
powers of Nature. Remove the cause if known, and theh
lend a hand to Nature in restoration.
INFLUENZA (Pink Eye).
A highly febrile disease; attacks suddenly; characterised
by its contagiousness amongst both young and old horses.
Symptoms: High temperature (104-deg. to 107-deg.),
great prostration, and subsequent weakness; breathing
accelerated; heart thumps against walls of chest; oede-
matous swelling about fetlock joints; cold, stiffness, dis-
inclination to move extremities; eyes partially closed and
discharging, but the disease does not always proceed to
an acute inflammation of these organs, giving the charac-
teristic "pink eye”; sore throat, making it difficult to
swallow. Mares, heavy in foal at the time of contracting
Influenza, are liable to abort. Stallions affected will
spread the affection at service; urine is a prevalent source
of infection, also drinking water.
Treatment: Isolate affected animals and take them off
work immediately; keep them quiet for a week to 10
days; keep warm with a light laxative diet; plenty of
greenstuff. Laxative Drench administered at once and
very slowly. Treat the throat with either Liniment or
Mild Blister. The eyes are to be dressed with a stringent
Eye Lotion and Eye Ointment daily. Diet should con-
tain carrots. Physicing is contra-indicated. If set to work
too quickly after recovery the heart may be permanent!''
affected. Complications to be guarded against are
Pneumonia, Pleurisy and Purpurea Haemorrhagica, and
Laryngitis. (See under separate heading.)
INSECT BITES.
Bee Stings are usually fatal in the horse, as they (the
bees) sting in such large numbers, where the horse is
concerned. Other insects such as flies, spiders, often
attack a horse about the head and throat, causing a
sudden swelling which is painful to the touch and a
61
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


certain amount of heat. If the exact location of the bite
can be detected, then it should be treated in the case of
poisonous insects with scarification and then an appli-
cation of powdered potassium permanganate (Condy’s
Crystals) rubbed well into the scarification. The swelling
should receive a copious application of Liniment exter-
nally to reduce both the size and heat of the swelling.
It allays the pain and neutralises the poison. Dress daily;
physic.
IMMUNITY.
Immunity is the degree of resistance to an attack of
disease. Immunity to attack of disease in animals is
either:—
(1) Inherited. Some animals inherit immunity and
e.g., horses are immune to Foot and Mouth Disease.
(2) Acquired naturally. Results from an attack of a
certain disease from which the animal recovers and that
makes it immune to that disease, e.g., Strangles.
(3) Acquired artificially. Results from using either
antitoxins as used in Tetanus or serum in Strangles or
Vaccines, e.g., Strangles.
ITCHY LEGS.
(See also under Mange.)
Commonly found in the Draught horse of the long-
haired variety; horse becomes very irritated when standing
in the stable at night; cannot rest well; scratches one leg
on the other; stamps or kicks throughout the night;
loosens shoes; damages legs and stables; hind legs mostly
affected.
Cause; A mite which burrows into the skin giving rise
to irritation; filth and neglect to keep the legs clean.
Treatment: Wash the legs with hot water and disin-
fectant, or washing soda. To remove greasy substance
sponge daily with Sulphur Wash till better. Blood Tonic
internally. Greenstuff in diet.
62
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


JAUNDICE: Yellow Jaundice.
Caused by congestion of the Liver, Biliary fever,
resulting after an attack of Influenza, Strangles, Colic!
Azoturia and during cases of poisoning, e.g., Phosphorus,
Arsenic, Lead, etc.
Symptoms: Foetid breath, yawning, turning up the
nose, yellowish tinge in visible mucous membranes, and
white of eye, tenderness about region of liver; costive-
ness; faeces pale color and not properly digested;
smelly.
Treatment: Give a physic ball. Another alternative
is Colic Drench. Light exercise; in cold weather keep the
horse well rugged, light diet, no cold water.
JOINT ILL: Navel 111.
A disease affecting young animals, characterised by soft,
painful and hot swellings of one or more of the joints;
suppurative swelling of the navel, which is regarded as
the seat of infection; foal becomes sleepy and lies about
a lot; later swellings appear about one or more joints,
and there is lameness; does not relish its milk; high
temperature.
Treatment: Keep the mare and foal quiet; administer
a Laxative Drench to the mare and follow up with the
Blood Tonic in her feed. If the navel of foal is infecte
it should be opened up and syringed out daily with
Healing Oil or lodine. Foment and massage the affected
joints with Liniments.
It is a rather common complaint amongst Clydesdales
in Scotland and the opinion is held there amongst
breeders that some mares are predisposed to have foals
which will become affected with Joint 111 soon after birth.
As a preventive the mares are inoculated with a serum,
30 days, and again 7 days, before foaling with good effect.
Also the navel string of the foal is to be ligatured and
dressed with Healing Oil immediately it is dropped (or
lodine).
The foal, on showing first symptoms, should be inocu-
lated with a serum.
63
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


JINKED BACK.
Usually result of a fall or injury to the spine about
the region of the coupling or pelvis. There may be
symptoms of partial paralysis, but always inco-ordination
of movement of the hindquarters, especially at turhing;
inclined to tread on one hind leg with the other, etc.
Treatment: Keep the animal quiet; put a charge or
blister along the spine, especially over the lumbar region;
absorbative medicines internally.
JINKED NECK.
Mostly occurs in handling young horses; breaking in;
result of fall or injury. The neck has an obvious twist
to the one side with a considerable bulge on the opposite
side; head is carried low.
Treatment: The horse is to be kept quiet and fed
at a reasonable height so that it is not necessary to bend
the neck, which should be supported. Give a Laxative
diet. Massage the neck with Liniment. The condition
may yield to treatment in a week to a fortnight, when the
horse should be turned out into a paddock until quite
recovered. To support the head, use a chaff bag, sus-
pended at proper height to enable the horse to rest his
chin and relieve tension on injured neck.
KIDNEYS, Diseases Of.
In the horse, chiefly Nephritis or inflammation of these
organs due to chills, weed or other poisons, improper
feeding, and due to some specific diseases.
Symptoms: Colicy pains; dull and depressed; urine
becomes thicker or may cease totally in worst cases if both
kidneys are affected; eyes glazy, sight impaired; breath
smells like urine; in extreme cases becomes comatose.
Treatment: Discontinue use of all grain or concen-
trates in food ; give gruels, linseed tea; mashes; milk;
green stuffs; keep loins warm and covered; massage;
physic; Colic and Gripe Drench; Kidney and Bladder
Powder; plenty fresh water,
64
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Stone in Kidneys: Rare and very painful. Chiefly
recognised by blood-stained urine and colicy pains in
spasms.
Treatment: Colic and Gripe Drench, Kidney and
Bladder Powders. Large quantities of clean, fresh water.
KNUCKLING OF
FETLOCK.
Due to paralysis, fracture,
strained or shortened back
tendons; common in newly-
born foals, which yields well
to treatment with Liniment
massaged into the back
tendons daily. (See Strained
Tendons.)
Foal with bowed legs.
LAMENESS of the Joints.
Elbow Lameness, tl il • j i n i
1.1." Ihe elbow is tender and swollen and
dropped somewhat. Very lame when moved. In the case
where the elbow bone can be waggled with crepitation,
then it is a fracture and not advisable to treat, excepting
in the case of a valuable animal; on recovery the leg will
remain stiff. In ordinary cases, foment with hot water
for 10 to 15 minutes, dry off well, and massage with
Liniment; in old standing cases apply a light blister once
only, and tie horse’s head up short. Allow the animal
complete rest until soundness returns; do not let horse
slip in walk, nor bed on slippery floor.
Fetlock Lameness. ** i ,
iviay be due to a sprain or concus-
sion; old standing condition gives rise to bony enlarge-
ment with rounding of the joint, termed 'apple joint”;
tenderness, heat and swelling are present; windgalls
appear above the fetlock.
65
f> OT 11 E’ S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment; If the condition is not serious enough to
prevent the horse working, then foment; later rub with
Liniment. In old standing cases, blister with Golden
Ointment and repeat the Application in 3 or 4 days if
necessary. In from 10 to 14 days, apply the lodine
Plaster and spell the animal for 3 or 4 weeks. The Sessa-
moid bones are two small kidney-shaped bones at the back
of the fetlock joint. Inflammation and tenderness of
these bones or their ligamentous appendages is often
present in the racehorse. Breakdowns in these regions
can only be effectively treated with the firing iron and
blister. Fracture of these bones is generally regarded as
incurable.
Hock Lameness. / vn j ma l goes very lame when starting
off; when moved over in the stall, carries the toe low to
the ground; the joint may be swollen or enlarged with
beat. If the hock is flexed the animal moves with
increased lameness. Carries hip lower in motion. May
be due to a sprain, kick, animal being cast; curb, bone or
bog spavin.
Treatment: Foments and Liniment to reduce swelling
and heat; later blister with mild blister and repeat; if an
old standing case use stronger blister, soothe off the
blister after 24 hours with White Ointment, and in 10
days wash off the joint, and when dry, apply the lodine
Plaster. Rest for three months.
Hip or Round Bone Lameness. u
« vjeneraiiy some en-
largement or inconformity when compared to the sound
hip; animal may flinch to pressure; moves away with
three-quarter gait; carries hip higher on affected side.
Treatment is to blister with mild blister, rubbing for 7
minutes about the affected part. Spell for six weeks.
Knee Lameness. t_t ~
" klor.se walks or trots stiffly; carries
the affected leg wide; swelling or unevenness about the
knee joint in front; to flex the knee causes a good deal
66
POTTI'E’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


of pain. Cause may be injury or due to concussion on
hard roads or tracks.
Capped Knee a so £ t? non .p am £ u i swe lling oi* the
knee, frequently seen in Hunters and Steeple Chaeers;
most often no lameness unless injured recently. Caused
by striking hard objects.
Treatment: Swimming in sea water is beneficial in
mild cases and keep the horse off the track; use Liniment
in conjunction with swimming. Where the small bones
of the knee joint have become injured or affected, pin
fire and blister; rest for three months. (See directions for
Fetlock Lameness.)
Shoulder Lameness. c tt- c \ i i i ,
dwelling of the shoulder; tender-
ness; horse resents manipulation of the limb; swings or
rotates the leg when extending the leg forward; inclined
to trip.
Treat with hot foments; Liniment well massaged over
the part. Complete rest and laxative diet; Physic. Blister
may be necessary to shift the seat of trouble, especially
if it is deeply laid.
Dropped Shoulder. j} ue tQ p ara £y s j s 0 £ R a< di a l Nerve;
leg badly flexed when weight is placed on it and cannot
be extended. Blister shoulder with mild blister. Rest for
three months.
Stifle. Joint Lameness, -pi • • . << ,
™ 1 he joint is swollen, tender,
and some heat; when the horse stands he lifts the leg,
holds it up for a short interval and theh replaces it gently
on the ground.
Treatment is tedious and lengthy; the animal requires
a long rest from work with frequent applications of Mild
Blister, rubbing for a few minutes, twice weekly.
67

Dislocation of the Patella (Lameness).
Locked Stifle Joint.
Loci jd Stifle Joint.
- J Due to strained joint ligaments
or ligaments of the knee cap (pa.tella); mostly seen in
young horses, especially when moved over in stall.
Symptoms: Either one or both stifle,s affected at the
same time; leg becomes stiff like a crutch when the joint
locks, but after the lock is sprung with a jerk the joint
moves normally again; may not be lame.
Treatment: Replace joint and then blister; keep horse
at rest for three to four weeks; in stubborn cases use
special surgical shoe, heightened at heel and well balanced.
LAMP AS.
A soft, pulpy swelling of the mucous membrane of the
hard palate in the roof of the mouth, behind the upper
tront of incisor teeth; the swelling hangs down below the
teeth. The cause is teething and indigestion. Molar
teeth uneven.
Treatment: As Lampas are only a symptom, treat the
cause; do not lance nor burn out; give a Laxative Drench
68
POTTIES INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARV


and follow up with Stomach Powder once daily. Attend
the teeth. Paint the Pampas daily with equal parts of
lodine and tannin.
LARYNGITIS.
Laryngitis is akin to Pharyngitis, and commonly called
a sore throat; swelling about that region, and tenderness
to pressure; sore cough when eating, varying discharge
from the nostrils; raised temperature; in bad cases horse
cannot swallow, and portion of drinking water returns
down the nostrils; difficulty in breathing dilates
the nostrils and makes a wheezing or roaring sound.
It is generally associated with chills in transport, Influenza,
Strangles in its early stages. It is to be regarded as con-
tagious, and the horse should be isolated from others and
fed and watered separately. It should always be taken
as a guiding principle that in any disease affecting the
wind, the case should be immediately laid off work and
kept quiet for a fortnight until a normal condition has
returned.
Treatment: Lay off work; isolate from other horses;
externally rub around the throat, where the throat strap
goes, with mild blister, or use Linimebt daily. Internally
drench with a Laxative Drench, and remember as the
throat is sore to drench slowly; should irritation of the
throat be too severe, quit drenching till next day. Follow
up with Cough Paste or Cough Mixture; Blood Tonic
later. Keep warm and dry. It will be found the horse
will take lucerne hay or greenstuff best. Under no cir-
cumstances put the horse back in work until quite nor-
ma 1 , as the risk of ruining the wind is paramount and
may become a Roarer or Whistler.
LIGHTNING STROKE: Electric Shock.
The horse is very susceptible to electricity in any
degree, as is well known to the racing fraternity in the
use of the battery. The fact is that the dog or cat will
Le only badly shaken by the same shock that would kill
69
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


the horse. Lightning Stroke is a very highly charged
Electric current and produces instant death. Horses have
been known to be struck seeking shelter under trees
during a thunderstorm or even standing near a wire fence;
there may be some scorching of hair and skin. Horses
may survive a mild stroke, but recovery will not be com-
plete. Horses have been killed or paralysed temporarily
by faulty electric currents short circuiting in poles on the
city streets and so giving a horse a bad shock when
passing, especially in wet weather.
Treatment: Sedatives and local treatment; massage.
Stimulants in other cases, e.g., Whisky, Brandy.
LIVER DISEASES.
Congestion of the Liver. Inflammation of liver.
Caused by irritants, wrong feeding, weed and other
poisons, chill, and secondary to many specific diseases.
Symptoms; Uneasiness, mild colicy pains, costiveness,
offensive smelling faeces, irregular appetite, changed dis-
position; urine dark colour; offensive sour breath; yellow-
ish visible membranes and white of eye; enlarged liver.
Treatment: Physic, Colic and Gripe Drench; Stomach
Powder. Bitter vegetables, liver purgative such as Epsom
and Glauber Salts. Laxative diet; greenstuff.
LYMPHANGITIS.
Weedy Leg, Big Leg, Monday Morning Leg. The
trouble comes on very suddenly, being preceded by
shivering turn. The horse seemed alright the night
before, but when seen in the stall next morning or goner-
ally Monday morning, after standing over the week-end,
he is stiff, very sore, breathing fast and very lame in the
affected hind leg (generally the near hind); the swelling
soon appears beginning near the groin; working down
the leg as it increases and with its increase the pain
decreases. It may affect a fore leg very rarely. Generally
70
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


it attacks a draught or
heavy van type of
horse. Predisposing
causes are a heavy
rich diet, chills, or
germ infection to the
large lymphatic ves-
sels running up the
inside of the thigh,
where they can be felt
to be corded and very
painful to the touch.
Treatment: Physic
out with Physic Ball,
following on with
Blood Tonic night
and morning and
Urine Powders. Hot
foment the leg, and
rub over the swollen
parts with Liniment;
repeat this massaging
every 12 hours; allow
Lymphangitis
exercise in a yard or paddock. Feed on greenstuff and
light laxative diet. In gross cases it may be as well to
bleed. One attack predisposes to its successors. As soon
as he is ready to work put him back into something light.
Lymphangitis: Epizootic. Rarely, if ever, seen in this
country. Infectious diseases caused by different germs;
characterised by swelling of mostly the hind legs,
thickening or cording of the large vessels inside the
thigh and leg; swellings form along the vessels; becoming
ripe and burst, forming ulcers with yellowish discharge.
Treatment: Should be carried out by an expert.
Lymphangitis: Ulcerative. Similar to the previous, but
may be met with in Australia.
Symptoms; Seat of trouble usually hind legs around
71
POTTIE ’ S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


the fetlocks. Ulcers form from size of pea to a walnut,
oozing a glazy, yellow discharge, or mixed with blood;
sore to touch.
Treatment: Treacherous to treat and must be classed
as a dangerous disease. Physic, Blood Tonic, dressing
with Healing Oil and Antiseptic Powder, or lodine
solution.
MALLENDERS AND SALLANDERS.
These are skin sores appearing, the former, in the
flexion behind the knee joint, and the latter, in front of
the hock. They may be hereditary; cause soreness and
lameness if neglected.
Treatment; Apply the Ointment fairly strongly and
repeat next day; afterwards use the Ointment daily till
quite better. Healing Oil and Antiseptic Powder. Blood
Tonic and physic.
Sallanders.
Mallenders.
72
POTTIE'S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


MAMMITIS; Inflammation of the Udder.
Rare in the mare; is sequence of some such disease as
flush of feed, or after loss of the foal where
it has been neglected to strip the udder. It occurs usually
on one side of the bag; chills and germ infection; mare
has shivery fits, colicy pains, breathes fast; pain locally,
with a hard hot bag; walks stiffly behind; milk turns
watery, to purulent and smelly.
Treatment: If the foal is still with the mother, remove
it; give her a Laxative Drench; foment the bag with hot
vinegar and water, or massage with Liniment twice daily;
strip out the bag 3 or 4 times daily; add a Colic Drench
to the Laxative Drench if the mare has much pain; keep
her on a light laxative diet, and warm.
MANGE.
The term commonly applied to the infectious skin
troubles, which are caused by parasites which attack
the skin; some forms are more difficult to cure than others
on account of the mode of the germs’ ingress into the
deeper layers of the skin by burrowing. Fortunately these
severe types of Mange are very seldom found in New
South Wales, as they are dangerous to man, and always
very difficult to cure. In these cases the irritation is
extreme and constant. The skin loses hair, small papules
form with exudation over the area; the skin becomes hard
and folds form.
Treatment: Isolate the affected animal; thoroughly
disinfect all harness, clothing and brushes; wash over
with hot water and washing soda (fairly strong) once or
twice weekly; alternate with Sulphur Wash and Sulphur
Ointment; Blood Tonic internally; all or any form of
treatment must be carried out methodically. The com-
monest type of Mange that is met with in our stables is
the Symbiotic, or "Itchy Legs,” caused by a mite in skin
about the legs, tail and mane. It causes extreme itching,
stamping in the stall and kicking; Papules and scabs will
73
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


be found. Treatment is to wash off with hot water, strong
in washing soda. Wash with Sulphur Wash daily when
not using the Ointments, and give Blood Tonic inter-
nally.
MEGRIMS.
Is indicated at the commencement by a nervous twitch-
ing of the head, lips and ears, or a shaking of the head;
when the attack comes on there is a period of insensibility,
the animal may rush violently forward or sideways, or
fall; with rigorous twitching of the head and neck all
the while; fainting fits. If the animal is rested at the first
onset of the attack for 15 minutes, the symptoms will
generally pass off; once the animal is attacked it is likely
to become affected at any time without much warning.
It is thought that the stomach and liver have some
indirect causal effect on the brain.
Treatment is not satisfactory in creating a permanent
cure; bleed and physic, turning out for a spell of three
months an green feed afterwards. If it is a sequela of
infection, e.g., Strangles, we would recommend a course
of Specific treatment.
MENINGITIS.
Inflammation of the covering membranes of the brain
and spinal cord. It may arise from injuries, worms, con-
cussion, strangles, tuberculosis, teething, ulceration of
ears, and indirectly from stomach derangements.
Symptoms: In the early stages the animal is dull and
hangs the head; eyes are bloodshot and partially closed;
no appetite; easily excited and later becomes unmanage-
able; is partially blind and seems to get some relief by
pressing the head into a fence or wall; temperature high;
trembling.
Treatment: Remove the cause; bleed at the Jugular
vein about 4 quarts; give our Laxative Drench or Physic
Ball to be followed up with Fever Drench; massage head
and neck with Soothing Oil; isolate animal in a dark,
quiet spot; and keep on soft laxative diet; ice packs to
head; Blood Tonic; specific treatment should be given
also (Sulphonilamide),
74
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


MOUTH, Diseases Of. (See Lampas.)
Sore Gums. Mouth wash regularly.
Broken Mouth. Use Mouth Wash.
Sore Lips. In mouthing young horses, use the White
Ointment.
Ulceration of Mouth. Use Mouth Wash.
Injured Tongue. Change bit if causing the trouble.
Do not drive or ride. Mouth Wash. Could use weak
dilutions of Boracic Acid, potassium permanganate as
mouth douche.
MUSCLE SORENESS.
Indicated by the horse being "tied up,” which may
arise from a number of causes. Young horses in work
are ready subjects; chills give their quota; horse may
become affected after a gruelling race. All the muscles
seem to become stiff and sore, tense and knotty, but it is
most evident in the shoulders. This trouble may become
confounded with Rheumatism or Azoturia, which are
usually confined to the loin and back muscles.
Treatment; Foment the muscles with hot water for 10
to 15 minutes; dry off well and massage with Liniment;
either a Laxative Drench or light physic. Cut off grain,
feed plenty of greenstuff; barley and linseed mashes,
laxative diet. Keep warm and light exercise till improved.
NASAL CATARRH or Gleet.
Cause: Most common cause is a germ and in such
cases it must be regarded as infectious. It may also be
caused by irritation with dust, pollen (hay fever), or
chemical agents as fumes of burning sulphur or ammonia.
Symptoms: Snorting and discharge which is first
watery, later becomes thick and turbid.
Treatment: The animal should be separated and put
in a warm and well ventilated box. In winter a rug is
necessary. A laxative drench is indicated; light diet;
inhalations may be helpful if carried out as following:
75
POTTIE'S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Place some chaff and Kay into the bucket, sprinkling on
to it oil of eucalyptus or creolin; then pour boiling water
over it and place it in a sack which is held over the
animal’s face; the eyes should be excluded. After inhala-
tions, keep him in a warm sheltered spot, no draughts.
NASAL DISEASE; Big Head. Miller’s Horse Disease.
Cause: It is caused by lack of certain minerals, mostly
lime in food. That brings about a deficiency in the
animal’s body which has an effect on its bones. Most
frequent changes are seen in the head, spine, ribs and
limbs.
Symptoms: The head becomes enlarged on both or
one side. The nose may become partially obstructed,
causing roaring. If limbs affected, there is lameness with
special difficulty in rising. Fractures are frequent.
Prognosis is usually bad, but if good care is taken
recovery may occur.
Treatment: Most essential is change of diet. A good
supply of oats with addition of bone meal and molasses
is recommended. Medicinally, a mild purgative, Blood
Tonic, lime, and Iron Salts are advised. Cod Liver Oil
shou'd also be supplied to diet. It is essential to maintain
an equilibrium of mineral salts in the system.
NAVEL ILL. (See Joint III.)
NAVICULAR DISEASE.
Chronic lameness, usually of the fore hooves, due to
an inflammation of the navicular joint of the hoof
(inside).
Cause: Predisposition, heredity, age, contracted hooves,
direct cause concussion on hard roads, tracks, high
actioned horses.
.Symptoms: Horse lame, action short, stiff and sore,
when cold or when first brought out of stables, but goes
sound when warm. "Points the toe" first of one and then
the other hoof in advanced cases; arched soles.
76
POtTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment; Well established cases are incurable.
Groove the hoof in contracted feet. Strong, comfortable
shoe and specific internal treatment.
OPEN JOINT.
Cause: A wound in the vicinity of a joint arising from
puncture on barbed wire, or fall on a sharp stone, kicks
or stab with a stable fork. Generally the wound is pene-
trating and infected.
Symptoms: The wound on the joint is discharging a
thin turbid fluid which becomes later more like pus. There
is severe lameness and pain, high temperature and fre-
quent pulse, and in severe cases, sweating and muscular
trembling. If injury not extensive and treatment applied
early the prognosis is favourable, otherwise it is bad.
Treatment: As the wound is usually infected it should
not be sealed. After the hair around the wound has been
clipped, pieces of dirt carefully removed, inject Healing
Oil and apply it later daily. Blister the joint and after
the wound has healed give exercise to prevent stiffness of
the joint. In place of our remedies use ice packs to the
joint and lodine diluted.
OPEN KNEE—BROKEN KNEE.
Cause; Usually caused by falls. Once the knee is
broken the horse is bound to fall on it again.
Symptoms: The wound may be superficial, affecting
the skin only. It may be deep, causing an open knee, or
it may involve some of the bones which are broken. In
the two latter mentioned cases there is a marked lameness.
Treatment: Apply Healing Oil and Antiseptic Powder
daily. Blister the knee and exercise the horse after the
wound has healed up.
ORCHITIS. See Testicles, Diseases of.
OVERGROWN FOOT.
Cause; Either due to long periods between shoeings
or unshod horses getting no wear on soft, marshy ground.
The condition predisposes to sprains, sandcracks.
77
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE. DICTIONARY


Treatment: Remove shoes at least once in four weeks.
If not shod should have their feet reduced once in eight
weeks at the most.
OVER-REACHING: Clacking.
Causes are usually bad conformation, shoeing, badly
balanced, young unseasoned horses overdriven; overtired.
Symptoms: Striking the front hoof, coronet, or heel
with the shoe of the hind hoof, generally when travelling
at speed. "Clacking” derives its name from the noise of
the hind shoe hitting the foreshoe.
Treatment: Remove loose skin; cleanse; stop haem-
orrhage by bandaging tightly with pad of cotton wool
covered with Antiseptic Powder, later use Healing Oil;
White Ointment. Remove cause to prevent recurrence,
especially the shoeing to receive attention.
PARALYSIS: General.
Loss of power of movement or sensation.
Cause; Is usually severe injury to the brain or spinal
cord; anaemia and debility; result of some specific diseases
and poisons.
Treatment; If the animal shows no sign of pain when
pricked in the hind legs below the hocks or in the tail
there is little hope of recovery as the back bone is likely
broken and bone is pressing on spinal column; animal
should be destroyed. If there is sensation, there is hope
of recovery. Give Laxative Drench; massage daily the
injured parts with Liniments; later blister. If unable to
rise, use the catheter at least once every 24 hours; give
warm enema; comfortable bedding; turn from side to
side at regular intervals so as not to lie too long on the
one side and so prevent "bed sores.” If possible raise
him in slings and support him until able to stand, say 10
days.

Paralysis: Partial or Total.
Facial Paralysis
(Partial)
Facial paralysis
(Total)
Facial Paralysis of Face; Caused by bad Keth or
injury; affects one side of face usually; lips hang pendu-
lous; drawn to one side; generally make good recovery.
Treatment: Massage side of face and cheek twice daily
with Liniments; Blood Tonic; complete rest and laxative
food.
Radial Paralysis. See Dropped Elbow, Lamenesses.
Slipped Shoulder. £) ue to i n j ur y of a nerve high up
in the shoulder.
Symptoms: The shoulder slips away from body with
each step of the affected leg.
Treatment, as for Radial Paralysis.
Recovery is usually good, but slow.
Crural Paralysis. £) ue to i n j ur y of nerve in hind leg
in casting.

PENIS: Diseases of.
Rupture G f penis is rare in horses, occurs mostly in
bulls.
Lesions, When the penis is exposed during erection it
is liable to wounds and contusions by kick from mare. If
these are superficial deal with them as with ordinary
wounds; penetrating may cause a severe haemorrhage. In
the latter case the haemorrhage must be arrested by
suturing. If nerve injured, paralysis of penis may follow
and it hangs swollen and useless from the sheath.
the penis from the sheath is
caused by anything which obstructs the orifice, e.g., swell-
ing, inflammation or tumour.
Treatment: Deal with the lesions giving rise to that
condition.
Inability to withdraw the penis. The causes are swell ,
ing, inflammation, tumour, or paralysis of the penis.
Symptoms: The penis hangs uncontrolled from the
sheath and if exposed long it may be fissured and ulcer-
ated.
Treatment: Remove the cause. Put in the penis and
hold it with a truss. If penis cannot be replaced in sheath,
wrap the organ in cotton wool soaked in our Healing Oil
and then truss it up close to abdomen. If the cause is
permanent paralysis, the only treatment is amputation of
the penis.
80
POTTIES INDEXED MORSE DICTIONARY


Tumours of the penis. Most common is papilloma,
but may be fibrona, or even cancer.
The papilloma or warts may be single or multiple.
Usually occur in clusters and become infiltrated with urine,
giving rise to a nasty smell.
Fibrona looks like an apple or potato.
_Cancer gives a granular looking, nasty smelling, mass
around the end of the penis.
Treatment; All tumours must be excised. In case of
cancer, amputation of penis may be necessary.
1 reat the Papilloma with Ointment locally, and
Blood Tonic internally; carrots in the feed.
PERITONITIS.
Inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity and
organs in the abdominal cavity.
Causes: Most commonly a wound in the abdominal
wall, stomach, bowels, bladder, uterus, in which case the
membranes become infected by germs. It may come after
castration, foaling or severe colic, or rupture of stomach
ulcers (bots).
Symptoms: The animal is very distressed and suffers
great pain, looks around the sides, paddles with hind feet.
Sometimes it stands with fore feet apart. The tempera-
ture is high, up to 106-deg., and the pulse is quick, small
and wiry. The urine and faeces may be retained.
Treatment: Colic Drench, and follow with special light
Fever Drink; diet; keep horse very quiet and warm; if
necessary, use warm sud enemas and pass catheter at
regular intervals. Apply for specific treatment to a Veter-
inary Surgeon.
PHARYNGITIS; Sore Throat, Angina.
It is an acute inflammation of the pharynx and may
involve the larynx and pouches.
81
POTT lE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Cause: Occurs usually in horses exposed to cold drafts,
when warm, or kept in cold, damp stables. The cause is
generally infection, e.g., in Strangles, or chemical irritant,
e.g., capsule of creolin or chloral breaks in the throat.
Symptoms: Loss of appetite and depression; sore throat.
Purulent nasal discharge; extension of the head; pain
and suppressed cough on pinching the throat; when
water is swallowed a portion is returned through the
nostrils.
Treatment: Segregate the horse to prevent spreading
of the disease. Keep it in a dry ventilated place. When
swallowing is difficult give him linseed or oatmeal water.
Inhalations as in Nasal Catarrh. Massage daily with
Liniments; apply hot poultices. If abscess formed, incise
and wash with disinfectant.
PLEURISY.
Inflammation of membrane which covers the lungs.
Cause: Usually results from exposure to cold, espe-
cially in winter and early spring. It may result from
bronchitis and Pneumonia.
Symptoms: It comes on suddenly. Usually the animal
is found sick in the morning following exposure. The
animal is depressed, has no appetite, paws with fore feet,
looks round to elbow. The breathing is rapid and shallow.
Cough is short, weak and painful. The temperature is
about 104-deg., pulse hard and wiry. Pressure with the
thumb in spaces between the ribs cause pain and cough.
Listening to the ribs may give a crackling noise.
Treatment: Give a laxative drench and follow it with
Cough Mixture. Apply mustard paste with 2 feet wide
warm packing round the chest, immediately behind the
shoulders. Feed as directed in Pneumonia.
Of all animals the horse has the most delicate and
highly sensitive lungs, as will be borne out by the fact of
great distances he can travel at sustained speed without
becoming "winded.” This high organisation of the lungs
causes the veterinarian a great deal qf anxiety in treating
these cas^s.
82
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


PNEUMONIA: Inflammation of the Lungs.
Cause: Chilling or infection by different germs. In
the latter case it might be a contagious disease. In foals
may be caused by lungworm.
Symptoms: Comes on suddenly and is well established
very often before it is noticed. Cough, rapid breathing
and high temperature are early symptoms. The horse
is dull, ears droop, anxious expression on face, no appe-
tite, remains standing in one place, does not care to move
or lie down. There is a slight discharge from the nostrils
which usually dries up. In fatal cases the discharge
becomes thicker, mattery, .stained with blood and has a
very bad smell. In such cases cough becomes weak and
distressing, breathing difficult, heaving at the flanks, eyes
red and bloodshot; horse becomes unsteady on his legs,
staggers a little and finally drops over dead.
Treatment: Give a Laxative Drench; apply Electric Oil
or Mustard paste to the chest. Cover well with warm
packs and bandage around the chest for 24 hours. Keep
animal quiet in an even temperature with good supply of
fresh air. Open air is beneficial if the weather is suitable.
Give lung stimulant every six hours, then every 12 hours.
When convalescent give Cough Mixture. In administering
medicines, great care must be taken, especially in all
diseases of the respiratory organs. The passage of anv
mto the. wind pipe may lead to fatal gangrene of the
lungs. Apply for specific treatment immediately. Diet
should be light and laxative; plenty greenstuff and
carrots.
POISONS.
These may be administered intentionally or accidentally;
they may be instantaneous in their action, such as Hydro-
cyanic (Prussic) Acid or they may be delayed such as
feeding on potato tops; the commoner met with are of
metallic salt in origin or common weeds.
Symptoms: Vary with the type of poison; but poison-
ing should be suspected if the animal becomes suddenly
83
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


ill, soon after feeding, or on change of feed, after spring
rains with a good resultant growth of weeds; new pastures
or pastures that may have become contaminated by their
close proximity to smelting works or factories, e.g., bullets,
lead poison, copper, zinc.
Treatment varies with the poison and will be found
under separate headings.
Arsenic Poison May be chronic or acute. Chronic
type is found in horses which have received large and
increasing doses of the drug whilst in training, or from
contaminated pastures near smelting works.
Symptoms: Falling of hair, harsh coat; white scurf:
red line around gums; loss of condition and wasting of
muscles after discontinuance of drug; craving for drug.
Treatment: Bleed the horse; Blood Tonic; repeated
small doses Epsom and Glauber Salts.
ftl—' May be obtained from arsenical sprays care-
lessly made on green fodder by roadsides and public
highways. This practice is to be strongly condemned as
it causes the loss of many horses annually.
Symptoms: Extreme pain; dark, smelly diarrhoea, later
blood stained; temperature high; eyes dilated and visible
membranes highly injected; definite diagnosis made by
chemical analysis; death usually occurs in a few hours.
Treatment: Use hyposulphate of soda, two table-
spoonsful to 10-oz. of water; potassium permanganat
crystals, one teaspoonful in 10-oz. water. Repeat dose
in two hours if necessary. Later control pain with Colic
and Gripe Drench.
Botulism. See Forage Poison.
JPoison occurs rarely in horses from
eating the bracken fern. There are acute and subacute
types.
Symptoms: Temperature very high; head held low:
salivation; pain,. ""

Symptoms; Gastro enteritis.
Treatment: Give plenty of milk, arrowroot gruels.
Colic and Gripe Drench.
Cyanide Poison; Prussic Acid. Cause . Usually f)ne of
the following: Young Sorghum, Sudan Grass and thistles;
a Linseed Meal may give this poisoning. Seven pounds
weight of these grasses is enough to poison.
Symptoms: Difficult breathing; staggering; twitching
of muscles; foaming at mouth; characteristic cry before
death, which takes place suddenly and quickly.
Treatment: Five per cent, water solution of Ammo-
nium carbonate (10-oz.) given straight away as soon as
an animal has had a feed of the causal fodders; inhala-
tions of Ammonia.
P°' son - i Horses pastured on fields thick
with dandelion; the poison gradually accumulates in
system.
Symptoms: Loss of co-ordination of hindquarters;
characteristic strmghalt-like gait of the hind leg; loss of
condition.
Treatment: See Australian Stringhalt.
Caused by eating excessive amounts of Ergot
or grass seeds, during flush seasons.
Symptoms: Dull, listless, sweating; breathing slow;
temperature subnormal; spasms; abortion in acute cases
of mare.

Lead. May be obtained by drinking water through lead
pipes; eating or licking white lead paints, or tin containers;
contaminated pastures, feed.
Symptoms: Dull, listless; painful gastro-ententis;
thumping of heart, easily heard; knuckling of fetlock
joints, sometimes convulsions; chronic type becomes a
"roarer.”
Treatment: Epsom salts; glauber salts; potassium per-
manganate, 1 teaspoonful to 10-oz. water.
Mercury. Most re j horse blisters contain Mercurial
salts; horse licking the blister will become affected with
severe gastro-enteritis; severe pain, passing blood.
Treatment: As for Lead.
Phosphorus. Treatment, see under Lead.
nc ‘_ Only case under our notice was from horses
licking plates of a discarded motor battery. Treatment

POLL EVIL.
It is a hard or soft swelling or purulent fistula on the
poll. i
The Cause is injury and infection in that region.
Symptoms: The mentioned swelling may be seen on
the sides of the middle line of the poll; usually hot and
painful.
Treatment: If only small may be reduced and absorbed
by using the fistula liniment. If the swelling is large,
lance it at the spot where the overlaying skin is thinnest.
Drain off contents and put in a piece of coring crystal,
size 3d., plug with tow. Remove the cores in 7to 8 days,
and then commence injecting strong antiseptics till the
wounds have dried up.

PURPURA HAEMORRHAGICA: Petechial Fever.
Characterised by distinct dropsical swellings of head,
throat, chest under abdomen and extremities; usually
follows some other severe illness, e.g., Strangles, Influenza,
Pneumonia. Swellings pit on pressure and indentation,
remains for a short time as in dough; swelling of lips,
may interfere with feeding, and of the throat with
breathing.
Purpura Haemorrhagica.
Symptoms: Characteristic swellings and petechial
haemorrhages or blood spots in visible mucous mem-
branes; no temperature; may present severe colicy pains;
sweating; spasms, difficult breathing.

QUEENSLAND ITCH.
A dry eczema, causing great irritation to the affected
animal; starts about mane, spreads down the neck and
right along the back to the tail; it appears to be seasonal,
and recurs in the affected animal about same time each
year, becoming worse each year. It does not appear to be
contagious to other horses, but at present its mode of
spread and actual is Hot understood.
Symptoms; Dry, scurfy rash along neck, and back hair
denudes in patches, extends onto head and face; animal
is very irritable and rubs on fences, trees, posts until the
surface bleeds.
Treatment: Physic; Blood Tonic; Sulphur Wash.
Specific treatment in unyielding cases.
QUITTOR.
Cause: Due to injury and infection of the cartilages
in sides of the horse’s foot. Usually results from treads,
picked up nails, sandcracks, suppurating corns.
Symptoms: Lame-
ness may or may not
be very marked. Ani-
mals which have
been injured near
the coronet instead of
getting better become
more lame. The ori-
ginal wound may heal
up, but the sides of
the coronet swell up
and become tender to
pressure. After a
time it bursts, pus
comes out. May im-
properly heal and
break out in an-
Quitter,
other part of the coronet, heal and break out again and
so on, rendering the animal a cripple.
88
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: The sinuses must be destroyed; enlarge
the opening and insert a piece of coring crystal; plug
with tow; remove the core after 7 to 8 days, and then
commence injecting strong antiseptic till the wound has
healed up. Give Physic Ball; feed on greenstuff and
soft laxative foods and rest until well; when healed, apply
the Hoof Ointment. In stubborn cases surgical inter-
ference is recommended.
RABIES.
Highly contagious disease, caused by a bite of a rabid
dog usually; animal becomes rabid within a short period
(1 to 2 weeks). Fortunately, it does not occur in
Australia.
RHEUMATISM.
Generally associated with lameness; stiffness; tender-
ness; the seat of lameness moves at intervals.
Caused by chills, colds, inflammation, sequel to infec-
tious diseases, bad management; inflammation of kidneys
and bladder.
Symptoms: In acute cases, high fever, dull, limps,
joints swollen, painful and hot; lack of appetite; when
the loins are affected the name given is Lumbago, In
chronic cases it attacks the joints, giving rise to arthritis
and heart disease. Lameness moves from spot to spot.
Treatment: Proper management; Laxative Drench;
Kidney and Bladder Powder; massage painful joints with
Liniment; bandaging; Blood Tonic; Glauber Salts regu-
larly in feed.
RIBS, BROKEN.
Cause: Blow, fall or collision; commonest site is
between 6th to 11th rib.
Symptoms: Depends on the extent of damage. The
broken rib may perforate the lungs, or it may perforate
the chest wall. In both cases the prognosis is very bad.
In more simple cases only the displacement can be seen
89
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


as a depression or flattening of the affected region. Some-
times two or three ribs may be involved.
Treatment! Keep the patient at rest until union
ensues. Blister. In complicated cases Veterinary advice
is indicated. Strap up the chest,
RICKETS.
Very uncommon in young horses; akin to Osteoporosis
or Nasal Disease.
RIG.
Has one or both testicles up in the abdomen; in some
cases one testicle has been removed as a yearling at cas-
tration; other testicle may come down into purse at second
or third year; if not, it is advisable to castrate; operation
is risky and animals needs starving out and operated on
under unaesthetic. Rigs are always troublesome, will
perform services quite as well as an entire, and may leave
mares in foal.
RING BONES.
It is a bony enlargement situated between foot and
fetlock joint. If it occurs (1) near the fetlock joint it is
high ringbone; (2) near the foot joint it is low ringbone;
and (3) false ringbone if it does not involve either of
the joints, but occurs upon the shaft of the pastern bones.
Cause: Hereditary; conformation; concussion; in-
juries; straight pastern or rheumatic origin.
Symptoms: Lameness especially when working on hard
roads. The bony enlargement can be seen or felt.
Treatment: Give the animal rest. When enlargement
is developed blister it. Firing is indicated, but must be
carried out very carefully. Rest after treatment for three
months.
RINGWORM.
Cause: Ringworm is caused by a parasitic mould.
Symptoms: May occur in young and old horses. The
hair becomes highly infectious, matted in patches and
90
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


subsequently bare; in size from sixpence to a five shilling
piece. At first the head, neck, withers are affected, but
after a few weeks large areas of the body are involved.
Itchiness is milder than in mange and it responds easy
to treatment.
Treatment: Use Blood Tonic internally; externally
use Sulphur Ointment. Disinfect rubbing posts, rails,
harness, rugs, brushes, etc.
ROARING, WHISTLING.
This is a diseased condition of the throat, due to
paralysis of the muscles of the left side of the larynx.
Cause: Hereditary; neglected throat affection; send-
ing back to work too soon on recovery from foregoing;
conformation; Lead Poison. Whistling is a modified form
of roaring.
Symptoms: The horse makes a loud, roaring noise
only when inspiring or breathing in; when exerted sound
is greatly increased; there is neither sound nor difficulty
when breathing out. The only successful treatment is
surgical.
SADDLE GALL, GIRTH GALL. SITFAST.
Cause: A wound or chafe on shoulder or back caused
by ill-fitting harness or uneven pressure upon the back by
some part of the saddle or girth.
Symptoms: The injury consists of a bare patch, in
size from 1-in. to 3-in. in diameter; may be hard and
leathery; may heal over with rest and treatment, but if
neglected may advance into the Sitfast stage.
Treatment: Remove the cause by paying attention to
the saddle and harness. Apply Chafe Heal twice daily.
In some cases the dead tissue must be removed with a
knife and forceps, then apply mild blister around the
wound or Antiseptic Powder to the wound daily.

SANDCRACKS.
This is a split or division in wall of the hoof extending
downwards from the coronet and usually involving the
whole thickness of the wall. Generally at the sides or
Sand Crack.

parting the crust.
quarters in the
forefeet and down
centre of toe in
the hind-feet.
Cause; Weakness
of the horn. Alter-
nate moisture and
dryness, hard, fast
work and injuries.
Symptoms; I n
some cases bleed-
ing, or when in-
fected, suppuration
is a common occur
rence. In severe
cases swelling of
the coronet above
the crack. Gener-
ally lameness is
marked.
Treatment: Open
the edges of crack
so as to set free the
contents, blood or
pus; remove, the
shoe, stand the
foot in a hot antiseptic solution daily for a couple of
hours. Dress the foot with Hoof Ointment; blister the
coronet with mild blister; immobilise the crack by binding
the hoof firmly with tar string or driving a nail trans-
versely through the crack and clench it at both ends.
Some cases require special treatment by a Veterinary
surgeon.
92
POT TIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


SCIRRHUS CORD.
Is an enlargement of the cut end of the spermatic cord
in castrated horses. It may have one or more openings
discharging thick, white pus through the open purse. The
swelling is increasing slowly and may, in some cases, be
nearly as large as a man’s head. When the swelling is
inflamed there are signs of discomfort, especially when
going downhill.
Treatment is entirely surgical in bad cases; consult your
Veterinary surgeon as soon as you become suspicious of
the condition.
SEEDY TOE.
Seedy toe is separation of the wall of foot from sensitive
wall or sole, generally affecting the front of hoof.
Symptoms: A ridge forms from the coronet to the
sole of the foot in the front of hoof. The condition is
usually first recognised by the farrier when preparing the
hoof for shoeing. If the wall on its outer aspect is struck
with a hammer a hollow sound will be heard.
Treatment: Instruct the farrier to keep the toe of foot
short and shoe with a heavy shoe. Clean out the hole
in the wall, wash it with strong antiseptic and plug with
a piece of tow and tar. Blister the foot around the
coronet with Golden Ointment.
SEPTICAEMIA: Blood Poisoning.
Septicaemia is a condition in which the blood becomes
infected by a germ. The latter is carried by the blood
stream to all tissues and organs of the body.
Cause: Extensive wounds, especially in joints, bones
or blood vessels, common after parturition. Some infec-
tious diseases, e.g., Anthrax, give rise to Septicaemia.
Symptoms: In some cases there is only high tempera-
ture followed by sudden death. In less acute cases there
is shivering, sweating and high temperature. The animal
is distressed and there may be small haemorrhages the
size of a pin’s head on the membranes of the mouth and
nostril.
Treatment; Pay strict attention to extensive and
93
POT TIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


infected wounds (look around); keep the animal in a
quiet place and nurse it well. Occurring after parturition
(see Foaling).
SHEATH, Inflammation Of.
Cause: Mostly due to urination into the sheath,, or
lying in dirty, wet litter; injury, resulting in swelling.
Treatment comprises in removing the cause. Withdraw
the penis and wash the sheath with warm water and soap.
Apply Healing Oil or White Ointment afterwards.
SHIVERING.
Is a nervous disease occurring chiefly in heavy draught
horses; less common in smaller breeds.
Cause: Usually hereditary. May be affection of the
spine or nerves. May follow Strangles, Influenza
Symptoms; In early stages difficult to detect. In well
marked cases the muscles of hind quarters quiver or
tremble when the horse is made to back. In some cases
it is difficult to pick up either of the hind feet. To detect
an early stage, back the horse forcibly over rough ground
or up a hill. Tapping the hind canons, knees, stifles.
Treatment: There is no curative treatment. Regular,
steady, .slow work can be carried out for years. Do not
breed from horses affected with this disease.
SIDEBONES.
Ossification of the lateral cartilages of the foot, situated
above the heels and quarters, usually inside or outside of
both fore feet, less common in the hind.
Cause: It is hereditary. Concussion from working on
hard roads. Injury.
Symptoms: The upper part of the cartilage, usually
flexible, becomes hard and usually appears as a hard
bony swelling. While forming there is lameness and pain
on palpitation, which disappears after it has formed.
Treatment: Blister the hard enlarged part with mild
blister three mornings in succession, then turn him out
for a month. Shoe with a bar shoe, and apply Hoof
Ointment. Thin the waU of hoof below the sideborie and
94
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DIC TION A R Y


then make a groove in V-shape with a blacksmith’s knife
so as to allow the hoof to expand.
Never breed from horses affected with sidebones.
SNAKE BITE.
Death is usually swift and sudden as the bite may not
be seen. Should the snake be observed in the act of
striking a horse the treatment should be as follows, and
carried out with the utmost rapidity.
Treatment: Place a tight ligature between the spot of
the bite and the heart. Scarify the place; and rub into it
powdered potassium permanganate (Condy’s Crystals).
Failing this, use nicotine out of a smoker’s pipe.
Stimulants such as Whisky or Brandy at frequent
intervals.
SORE SHINS.
Mostly affects young racehorses up to two years old.
Cause: Immature condition of the animal; concussion.
Symptoms: Lameness usually in both forelimbs. There
is pain and swelling in front of the canon bone, the
latter becomes thickened and assumes a more convex shape
in front; pressure on shin bone increases pain.
treatment: Rest the horse. While inflamed apply
fomentation and Liniment. Later, blister with mild
blister.
SPECIFIC OPHTHALMIA: Periodic Ophthalmia:
Moon Blindness.
Cause: Unknown. Possibly infective. Damp climate
and poor feeding predisposes. Believed to be hereditary.
Symptoms: Occurs suddenly. In the morning the horse
is found with his eyes half closed. Tears running down
the face, and resents examination of the eyes. The
temperature may be raised. After a few days they
become more inflamed. The cornea becomes blurred.
This may last up to 10 days, after which the inflammation
disappears, and after three weeks from the start the eye
is nearly normal. Then there is a period with no
symptoms which last from three days to three weeks, after
95
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


which a recurrence usually occurs. After it has recurred
three times total blindness follows.
Treatment: Keep the horse under hygienic conditions,
feed him well. Separate the horse into a shaded stable.
Give a laxative drench and syringe the eye with Eye
Lotion. Also Kidney and Bladder Powders are helpful
in many cases where the kidneys are incurred.
SPLINTS.
Splints are an outgrowth of borne between the knee
and above fetlock below. May be on inside or outside
of leg, or both. More often found in the fore limbs.
Causes: Bad conformation. Concussion often by work
ing young horses on hard roads, knocks, injuries from
Brushing and Cutting. Considered hereditary and is
unwise to breed from Blood horses or Draught Stallions.
Symptoms: Lameness is sometimes persistent and acute,
usually increases with work on hard ground. The animal
may walk sound but trots lame. As a rule splints are
not serious in adult horses, but may cause trouble in
young animals.
Treatment: Apply hot vinegar with brush for two
weeks, once daily. Blister afterwards with Red Blister.
STERILITY.
It means failure on the part of an animal, male or
female, to breed.
Cause: Diseases and injuries of the genital organs in
male and female. Most important in the female are
diseases and injuries during and after parturition or
contagious abortion. Feeding and condition: e.g., exces-
sive fatness, or under-nourished sire. Heredity. Climatic
conditions and management.
Prevention and treatment: Rational feeding and exer-
cise is essential. Add to the diet 5% lucerne meal or
green lucerne, sprout some oats till the sprouts are 2-in.
long, give 5-lb per day per head.
Diseases and injuries to the genital organs, treat as
directed under separate headings. In some cases it is
96
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


difficult to establish the cause of sterility. In such cases
veterinary assistance is indicated. In cases which are not
yielding to these simple measures advise specific treatment
should be sought from a Veterinary Surgeon.
STRAINED NECK.
The head is carried low, twisted to one side, the
opposite side to which the injury is located.
Causie: It is caused by animal being suddenly pulled
or jinked, falling over fence, or otherwise injured in
breaking-in young horses.
Treatment: Foment and apply Liniment.
STRAINED TENDONS.
Very common condition in all types of horses, more
often in fore than in the hind limbs.
Causes: Conformation, over-exertion, heavy draught,
slippery ground.
Symptoms: Back tendons are hot, sore and tender on
pressure. Swollen from side to side and from knee to
fetlock, or at the back giving the leg a bowed appearance
called "Bowed” tendons. Where all the back tendons are
gone, it is termed "Broken Down,” and treatment is not
hopeful.
Treatment: (I) Reduce the heat and inflammation with
fomentation and Liniment, and then blister with
blister, follow with lodine plaster, and give about four
to six weeks’ spell. (2) Firing gives, especially in chronic
cases, good results. (3) lodine plaster. Give in every
treatment a spell from four to six weeks.
STRANGLES.
Is a contagious disease of horses, mostly the young
under six years old.
Causes: Is caused by germ infection, Strept. Equi.
There are, however, factors which predispose the animal
to the infection, e.g., Badly ventilated and overcrowded
stables, overworking young horses, bad weather, draughts
and rain, long journeys.
Symptoms: There are two forms of Strangles: Typical
and Bastard Strangles. In the first form there is a tem-
97
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


perature about 104 F. Discharge from the nose, which is
watery at first, soon becomes thicker and of a creamy
yellowish colour, usually running from both nostrils.
Very sore throat indicated by difficult swallowing. A
few days after the first symptoms are noticed the lymph
glands under the jaws in the jowl become enlarged, hot
and painful to the touch. In some cases the swelling
may be situated over the side of the throat. In the latter
case it interferes with swallowing and breathing, and the
neck is held stiff. When drinking the water returns
through the nostrils. It takes 3-5 days for the abscess to
develop and burst, discharging thick yellowish white pus,
which is very infective for other horses. The bursting
or lancing of the abscess brings relief to the animal and
afterwards the horse starts to improve.
Bastard Strangles: j n type there is no swelling of
lymph glands under the jaw, but some other glands in
the body may be affected, e.g., on the neck, in front of
the shoulder. If it affects some internal glands it gives
rise to colicy pains, loss of condition, and should it burst
near a vital spot, death will result quickly. Abscesses
may form in the groin or udder of the mare, and these
need careful local treatment to avoid Blood Poison sub-
sequently. Complications are Pneumonia, Arthritis, and
Purpurea Haemorrhagica.
Treatment: In the early stages give a Laxative Drench
and massage the throat and abscess swellings with Lini-
ment or Mustard paste. Quick action often cuts short
the period of the attack. Later, as the attack develops
swallowing becomes markedly difficult, and then if
drenching is attempted at all it should be done with great
care and patience, giving only a portion of the drench
and the rest to follow on next day. If the throat is
paralysed owing to the severity of the attack do not
attempt to drench at all. Use specific treatment. There
is a recent discovery in drugs which is of great value in
treating this disease. It may be given in capsule form
and can be obtained on application to any veterinary
surgeon.

POTT I E' S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Isolation and Vaccine Treatment: It is very necessary
to isolate an infected animal immediately and take all
precautions to check the spread. Disinfect all stalls, feed-
ing boxes and utensils, drinking troughs especially. Use
Londy s Crystals for this purpose and a pinch placed in
a drinking trough daily will assist to keep the supply from
contamination. The use of the Vaccine is attended with
disappointing results as a curative, but can be relied on
to give better effect as a preventive. The inoculation is
to be made under the skin on the neck. (See Hypodermic
Injections.)
STRINGHALT.
It is a nervous affection of hind legs and sometimes
of fore.
Cause: The cause may be an affection of the Brain,
Spine, Nerves. It may be due to the animal eating exces-
sively of Dandelion plant when in flower, producing an
altered condition of the blood.
Symptoms: The animal suddenly jerks one or both
hind legs up, and as suddenly drives them down when
walking, less often when trotting. Difficult to shoe.
Treatment; Remove the horse out of the paddock into
the stable or on to different pasture. Pay attention to
shoeing to diminish concussion. Administer a Physic
Ball. Rub loins and hindquarters with Liniment.
SUNSTROKE, HEATSTROKE : Thermal Fever,
Insolation.
Causes; Exposure to excessive heat either from the sun
or from over exertion in hot humid atmosphere.
Symptoms: The horse suddenly becomes dull, stum-
bles, breathes frequently and collapses. That may be
followed by convulsions, restlessness, and the animal is
unable to get up; high temperature.
Treatment: Bleed from the jugular vein, remove if
possible to a cool place. Douche head with cold water,
best by putting the animal under a shower or ice packs
to head. Give Colic Drench every three hours till'better
Give one Laxative Drench—Stimulants.

POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


SYNOVITIS : Inflammation of Synovial Sheath of
Joints and Tendons.
Cause; Mostly infection due to open wounds of synovial
sheath. For symptoms and treatment of these look Open
Knee, Open Joint. In some cases there is a closed
synovitis due to strain of tendon or capsule.
Symptoms: In the latter case there is inflammation in
region of the sheath, which are distended with serous
fluid, well marked lameness, heat and pain.
Treatment; Apply hot fomentation, cold compress, and
after inflammation subsides blister with mild blister.
lodine Plaster. Brine packs bandaged over swellings
where possible. Cold hose played on swelling.
TEETH : Diseases of.
It comprises: (1) Abnormal Development.
(2) Irregular Wear.
(3) Diseased Substance of Teeth.
(1) Abnormal Development: Sometimes a double
row of incisors can be seen which is caused by irregular
shedding. The milk teeth persist and the permanents
appear behind, growing in an abnormal direction.
Treatment: Extract the milk teeth. Syringe with mouth
Wash or Salt Solution.
(2) Sharp Teeth; outer border of the upper jaw
and the inner border of the lower jaw become sharp.
Symptoms: Difficult mastication. Hard food like oats
or hay is partially chewed and drops out of the mouth,
salivations and wounds on the cheeks and tongue, poor
condition.
Treatment; Have the tongue taken out to the opposite
side and rasp the outer edge of the upper and the ijmer
edge of the lower jaw. Syringe the mouth with Mouth
Wash.
Fractured Teeth causec [ ky a kl ow: If portion of a
tooth involved, rasp it down. If the whole tooth is
affected, extract it.
100
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Parrot or Sow Mouth; w/u .u
_________ When the upper incisors over-
hang the lower it is known as Parrot Mouth, and when
the lower protrudes beyond the upper it is called Sow
Mouth. Both conditions prevent the horse from grazing
and may make the mastication difficult and painful.
Treatment: Shorten or extract offending teeth.
(3) Caries. Disease of the hard substance of the teeth
infected by a germ.
Symptoms: Persistent foul smell from the mouth.
Chewing becomes difficult and the horse tries to change
the food to the other side of the mouth. A drink of cold
water will cause great pain.
Treatment: Remove the diseased tooth or teeth.
Syringe the mouth with Mouth Wash. The operation of
removing a cariesed molar tooth will involve casting and
anaesthetic in many instances, and it is always a difficult
job.
TESTICLES, Diseases Of.
Not Descended Testicle. (See Rig.)
ORCHITIS: Inflammation of Testicle.
Causes: It may result from injuries during service,
bites of dogs, jumping over fences, or in some specific
diseases as Strangles and Influenza.
Symptoms: The whole region is swollen and painful
to the touch. Horse is feverish and finds difficulty in
movement.
Treatment: If skin unbroken, foment for 15 minutes
daily, hot water and washing soda. Massage afterwards
with Liniment in cases resulting from bruises. If the
skin is broken, rub on the White Ointment. Keep the
horse on light, laxative diet and physic, or give a Laxa-
tive Drench. In those cases finding difficulty to make
water, use the Catheter to relieve.
TETANUS.
It is an acute highly febrile disease of all animals, the
horse being very susceptible.
101
POT TIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Cause: Caused by a germ infection (Clostridium
Tetani) of deep, punctured wounds, e.g., picked up nails,
injuries from the prongs of stable forks, Castration,
Docking, unhygienic conditions during foaling, may be
the cause of Tetanus.
Symptoms: In the early stages the symptoms are very
slight and difficult to recognise. Later the horse becomes
slower in work, starts dragging the toes along the ground,
breathing becomes distressed and the ears are continually
Tetanus.
moved backwards and forwards. The muscles of the
neck and back are rigid and the tail is carried high. In
later stages the characteristic tetanic spasm of body
muscles develops. The animal holds itself stiff and rigid.
Head and neck slightly raised, the lips are stretched back-
wards exposing the clenched teeth. The ears are rigid
and their points turned to each other, and the two jaws
are "locked.” The fore legs are splayed outwards to
enable better to retain its balance. If head is lifted
sharply up, the third eyelid is seen to cover the eye. The
spasm is caused by any sudden movement, daylight or
unusual sound, e.g., slamming the doors.
102
POT TIE ’ S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment and Nursing: Try to find the site of
wound by which the germ has gained entrance, Disinfect
it with strong solution of Condy’s Crystals, Hydrogen
Peroxide. Place the horse in a dark loose-box and while
attending take all precautions not to frighten the animal.
As long as the animal can swallow, plenty of green food
and fluids should be provided. After the jaws have
become locked, feed him on very thin bran mashes, linsec
or hay tea, gruels, milk, etc. Keep the bowels open by
adding Epsom salts to the food or water. The most
reliable treatment is injections of Anti-tetanic serum into
the Jugular Vein.
Prevention: In all cases of deep penetrating wounds a
dose of anti-tetanic serum should be injected within three
days at least of receiving the wound.
THOROUGHPIN.
It is a soft swelling on both sides of
the hock about the level of the point of
the hock.
Cause: Distention is due to accumu-
lation of synovia (joint oil) caused by
sprain of the tendons by over exertion,
such as: Violent kick, backing on slip-
pery ground.
Treatment: Blister the swelling with
Red Blister. After 10 days apply lodine
p 1 aster and rest for six weeks. In
advanced cases firing gives best results.
THRUSH.
Thoroughpin.
It is a diseased condition of the frog of foot in which
the cleft opens and discharges foetid matter. It is fairly
common in hind feet of heavy draught horses. When
lifting the foot a foul smell is noticed and the horn in
the cleft is soft, black on the outside but whitish grey
inside.
Cause: Damp, filth, neglect, bad drainage from stalls.
103
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: Cleanse the parts thoroughly with a knife
until healthy horn is obtained. Dress with Antiseptic
Powder, worked well into the foot. Give a dose of Physic
and afterwards Blood Tonic. If not lame the horse is
better at work after preliminary treatment, and the
affected hoof covered with leather or adaptable pad.
TREADS.
Injuries to the coronet.
Cause: Either the shoe of the other foot or by the
adjacent horse when working in pairs.
Symptoms; XKere is inflammation in tKe region of the
coronet and lameness. If situated in the vicinity of
lateral cartilage quarters and the damage involves the
latter, quittor may result.
Treatment: The area should be clipped and washed
with an antiseptic solution. If the wound is deep, syringe
it with strong antiseptics. Do not work until all soreness
is gone.
TUBERCULOSIS.
It is a chronic contagious disease, very rarely occurring
in horses. Caused by a germ, Mycobacterium Tuber-
culosis.
Symptoms: The animal gradually becomes thinner in
spite of good food and does not react to improved
management or to tonics. If lungs are affected there is
high fever, distressed breathing, refuses to eat and
generally dies in a few days (pneumonia). Bones of the
neck are very often affected, which makes the movement
of the head difficult, and the horse develops a stiff neck
and is unable to eat from the ground.
Treatment is not attempted. Diagnosis must be con-
firmed by T.B. test done by a Veterinary Surgeon, and,
if positive, the animal destroyed.
TUMOUR: or New Growth.
A Tumour is lump or enlargement forming on almost
any part of the body. They are divided into Malignant
Tumours, such as: Cancers, Cancerous Growths, or
Simple Tumours, such as: Fibrous, Fatty, Bony or Muscle
104
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Tumours. Cancers generally form on the eye, lips, old
wounds, in the stomach, on the penis, and womb. Simple
Tumours situated in a vital place may be sometimes as
harmful as malignant. It is very important to distinguish
a tumour from a rupture and abscess.
Treatment: In the majority of cases is complete sur-
gical excision and should be dealt with by a Veterinary
Surgeon. If small superficial growth use a caustic stick.
If circumscribed and on a pedicle ligature tightly around
the neck with strong silk, or linen thread, which will
generally remove the tumour in course of a few days.
URTlCAßlA—Hives—Nettle Rash,
It is a disease of the skin in which small areas on the
surface become raised.
Cause: Exposure to the leaves of the stinging nettle,
insect bites, bad management, feeding on too much oats,
and not giving enough exercise, giving rise to auto-
intoxication.
Symptoms: Sudden appearance of swellings on the skin
which vary in size from a pea to a walnut, no pain in
touching. The skin of the eyelids, nostrils, throat and
hips are mostly involved and swollen.
Treatment: Give the horse enough exercise. Cut down
the oats specially in horses which are not in full work,
give bran mash instead. Give a Purgative Drench or
physic with Kidney and Bladder Powders. Large swell-
ings rub with Liniment.
UTERUS, INFLAMMATION OF, OR METRITIS.
Cause: If before foaling is due to the death of the
foal and subsequent abortion. If after foaling is usually
caused by infection brought into the Uterus by the hands
of the attendants, ropes, etc.
Symptoms: The mare is distressed, loses the appetite,
temperature is high, is lying most of the time and has
great difficulty in getting up. There is a greyish blood-
stained smelly discharge .from the vagina. Only a small
percentage of cases recover. Some develop into chronic
Metritis. Most cases become complicated with Laminitis,
Pneumonia, Peritonitis, Abscess formation in neighbour-
ing organs, etc., and as a rule terminate fatally.
105
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: More important than treatment is preven-
tion. Great care should be paid. to cleanliness during
and after the act of foaling. If Metritis has developed
put her in a warm, dry, well ventilated, clean loose box.
Supply her with plenty of fresh easy digestible food and
clean water. Give her a Laxative Drench and Stimulant.
If very weak, a stimulant, e.g., whisky or brandy is
indicated. The Uterus should be washed out with an
antiseptic solution, e.g., Potassium Permanganate 1:2000
in boiled water, cooled down to body temperature, and
drain off all the fluid. Then insert a Uterine Pessary.
Repeat the use of the Pessary daily until recovery is
complete. In bad cases specific treatment should be
given by a Veterinary Surgeon.
UTERUS, Prolapse of: Everted Uterus or Womb.
Cause: After foaling, injury to womb in foaling, organ
displaced, causing mare to strain and press after foaling
until she everts the womb.
Symptoms: Red cone-shaped bag found hanging out
the bearing. Cleansing usually detached.
Treatment: Cleanse the womb with warm disinfectant
water, not too strong. Gather up the organ in a moist
towel or sheet. Gradually replace by gentle massage and
fomenting. Any injuries should be attended before
replacing. Insert a Pessary after replacement of the
organ. Repeat daily. Give the mare a Colic Drench. If
there is much pain, repeat Colic Drench, and later follow
on with Tonic. Complications same as for Metritis. Case
usually ends fatally.
VERTIGO: Stomach Staggers.
Cause: Either affection of the brain or intoxication
from the stomach after some food.
Symptoms: Attacks of falling when the horse is driven
or when it starts. Tries to remain standing but eventually
falls and lies quietly. The loss of consciousness lasts
aoout five minutes, then it rises and is normal again. The
attacks recur often, specially when the animal is worked
heavy and fast.
106
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: Light diet and light exercise. Stomach
Powder or small doses of Glauber and Epsom Salts.
WALL EYE.
Occurs in horses with a white glaze coming over one or
both eyes. It is an absence of colouring matter in the
Iris. It is regarded as a vice only in tropical countries
where the horses are exposed to intense light. More
common in the Clydesdale breeds.
WARTS.
Are small solid growths on the surface of the sk;n in
size from a pin’s head to an apple. Seldom cause harm
or pain except if they appear in places where they inter-
fere with the movement of some part of the body, e.g.,
on penis, sheath, vulva, lips.
Cause: May be irritation, e.g., skin chafed by harness,,
but the real cause is unknown. Lately regarded as a
deficiency of some mineral salts, especially in the young.
Treatment: Remove by excision, or caustic pencil.
After having removed, dress with White Ointment. If
the wart has a distinct neck, tie a piece of fine string or
silk tightly round the stalk, then the wart will die and
drop of! in a few days. Where the warts are diffuse and
numerous, treat with Wart Powder and specific Internal
treatment. As an alternative, use an iron tonic and feed
green stuff and carrots; Crude Castor Oil applied
externally.
WIND GALLS.
Soft swellings in the vicinity of the fetlock.
Causie: Sudden strain or concussion. May be here
ditary.
Symptoms: The swelling may appear on either side
and slightly above the fetlock joint or behind the fetlock.
They vary in size and may obtain the size of a pear.
Common in old horses and rarely cause lameness.
Treatment: In the early stages apply strong Liniment
for ten minutes daily and bandage over night. In severe
cases blister well. After ten days apply lodine Plaster.
107
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Rest. Mild cases may be assisted with cold brine com-
presses bandaged overnight in the stall; swimming or
standing in sea water.
WORMS.
Worm Infestation in horses is very common. The best
known are:—
IN THE STOMACH: (1) Bot Fly. (See Bots and
diagram.)
(2) Stomach worm Habro-
nema.
LIFE HISTORY of a STOMACH WORM OF HORSES
See diagram. Small iin.—lin. long, thin, threadlike,
live in the stomach, causing inflammation of the stomach.
Treatment: Bot Ball.
108
POTTIES INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


IN THE INTESTINES: Large round worms. Asca-
ridae. Is large, yellowish white in colour as thick as a
pencil and about 6in. to 1 foot long.
Large Roundworm of the Horse. Natural Size.
Symptoms: Colic, loss of appetite, irregular bowel
motions, loss of condition and worms detected in faeces.
Treatment: Give Worm Powders and Worm Drench or
Worm Ball.
(2) Small Round Worms—Strongilidae,
(a) Redworms: l-3rd to 2 inches long, reddish in
colour, adheres to one’s arm when back-racking a horse.
Symptoms; The small round worms are the most
serious parasites in horse. By biting the intestines and
sucking the blood they cause heavy loss of condition,
109
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


loss of flesh and anaemia. Depraved appetite, coat is
harsh and dry and starving, hide bound.
Treatment: Bot Ball or Worm Drench.
LIFE HISTORY OF A LARGE ROUNDWORM.
(b) Pin Worm, Thread Worm. Seat Worm — Oxyuvis.
Is 1½ —2½ inches long, is thick at one end and slender
at the tail.
Symptoms: Does little harm. There is a yellowish-
white crust round the anus due to eggs being deposited
by the female worm. This causes irritation and persistent
rubbing of the tail and hindquarters on rough surfaces,
posts or trees.
110
POT TIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


Treatment: Give Worm Powders and Worm Drench.
Give an enema of warm water and salt or vinegar. Use
the Rectum Ointment as directed.
TAPE WORMS are not very common in horses. 1 3
inches long, consisting of white segment.
Symptoms: Unthriftiness and segments of the worm
may be noticed in the faeces.
Treatment: Give Worm Powders.
Prevention and Management in Worm Infestation;
trend the pastures, which should be well drained and
dressed with lime or salt, and if heavily infested, left fre-
from horses for I—2 years. Graze cattle or sheep over
t ese pastures m meantime. If worms are suspected the
horse should be taken up from pasture and put into a
stall, wormed, then fed on highly nutritious dry food
include beetroot and carrots in the diet specially if
Kedworms be present.
WOUNDS.
Cause: (1) May be caused by sharp instrument,
.leaving a clean cut known as Incised wounds.
(2) By a long pointed instrument, e.g., stable fork,
horn of ox, known as Punctured wounds.
(3) By Blunt bodies, e.g., kick from shod horses, falls,
known as contused wounds.
(4) If tearing takes place it is called lacerated wounds,
e.g., wire or barbed wire cuts.
(5) If infection takes place they develop into suppurat-
ing or poisoned wounds.
Symptoms; (a) Haemorrhage, the amount of which
depends whether a blood vessel is damaged. Pain,
gaping of the lips of wounds.
Treatment: Bring the animal under control to prevent
doing itself further injury. Stop haemorrhage by stitch-
ing or plugging. Large blood vessels need ligaturing.
Use the Healing Oil for cleansing the wound. Remove
a naif, clip away soiled hair. Bandage if possible, using
111
POTTIE’S INDEXED HORSE DICTIONARY


calico and cotton wool, saturated in Healing Oil or a
weak solution of Condy’s Crystals or Tincture of lodine.
Where bandaging is impossible, apply the Healing Oil
to wound surfaces and then dust on the Antiseptic
Powder, dressing once or twice daily as case may need.
In case of the Punctured Wounds, Tetanus (Lockjaw)
is more likely to complicate and should be guarded
against by a light injection of Anti-tetanus Serum.
Syringe under pressure with Healing Oil or Tincture of
lodine into the puncture.
Infected or Poisoned Wounds: Dress with Healing Oil
twice daily, taking great pains to make the dressing
penetrate all portions of the wound. Tincture of lodine
is also to be recommended. Allow good drainage from
wound.
WRY NECK—(See Strained Neck).
Occurs particularly in foals before birth. The head
is turned to the right or left side of the body. It may
hinder or prevent foaling. It is difficult to straighten out
the head even after the foal has been born.
Treatment: It is rare that a foal with Wry Neck is born
alive, but even if that occurs it is not advisable to rear it.
