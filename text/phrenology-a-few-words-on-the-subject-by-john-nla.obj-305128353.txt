FOR THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC.
The following is a Bye-Law of the Tasmanian

BYE-LAW.
That the President and Secretary be a Committee
to wait on all travelling Phrenologists, to ask to sec
their diplomas or certificates, if they have none, to
tell them that the Society will he willing to assist
them if they will allow themselves to he examined
as to their knowledge of the science. If they refuse
to he examined, two notices will appear in each paper,
warning the Members that the Society do not recognise
them as exponents of Phrenology.


Introduction.
On Thursday evening, the 3rd June, I had the
pleasure of listening to a very able address by Mr. John
J. Sheridan, on the subject of Phrenology. This Science
has been so degraded by the utterances of itinerant
Charlatans who have lectured for gate-money, and pro-
fessed to delineate character at half-a- crown a-head, that
it was quite refreshing to hear the principles of the
Science intelligently expounded by one who understands
them thoroughly.
As the inventor of a new method of marking charts,
and also of a most ingenious instrument for measuring
the head (now known as the Craniocentiometer),* Mr.
Sheridan may justly claim a place among the leading
Phrenologists of the day. As a student of the subject
Mr. Sheridan has been most indefaticable, and when he
enters upon the course of lectures he is now preparing
for, I trust the public at large will take advantage of the
opportunity to gain a knowledge of Phrenology from one
who is well able to teach its principles and advocate its
claims to be recognised as a Science.
It is as well that the public should get to know the
value of the Charlatans who talk about “ bumps, and
who hunt for hills and hollows in the configuration of
the skull. It is just as well also that the public should
learn the value to be placed upon the utterances of some
leaders of thought in the Scientific World, who have
condemned Phrenology without understanding first
principles. Pigotry is not confined to narrowminded
Theologians and Sectarians. It may also be found in the
*An illustration and description of this Instrument appeared in
the September number of the Phrenological Journal, published in
New York,


ranks of the Scientists. Fortunately, the objections to
Phrenology alid the higotted opposition to its teachings
are now crumbling away before the discoveries of Perrier
and others; and I have little hesitation in predicting
that the time is not far distant when the Science of
Phrenology will he rated at its true value, and when manv
of those who now occupy the seat of the scorner will
become its most earnest desciples.
As an indication of the value of the svstem of
marking devised by Mr. Sheridan, and practised by the
members of the Tasmanian Phrenological Association
I may mention that at the conclusion of his address on
Thursday last, Mr. Sheridan retired from the room. A
gentleman was then selected from the audience, and the
numbers representing his temperament and Phreno-
logical developments were marked by Mr. W. Connor,
on an ordinary Head Chart, drawn on a blackboard. Mr
Sheridan was then admitted, and, after contemplating
the chart, in less than two minutes picked out the in-
dividual the audience had selected.

P R E F A C E.
Truth needs but plain and careful statement, that
its divine light may he appreciated, by the intelligent
mind. ’Tis the bigot who clothes himself with the un-
penetrable veil of error, which will not let its benign
light enter his mind.
The following little work is an humble endeavour
by the Author, to state in clear and unmistakable
language, the principles of Phrenology —What it is and
what it is not.
Phrenology is a Light —a Sun around which the
Sciences of Histology, Physiology and Anatomy, as
Satellites revolve in constant attendance, I heartily
commend the little work to all honest and intelligent
minds, and, in conclusion, would say that it is one of the
first fruits of the Tasmanian Phrenological Society put
before a thoughtful public.
WILLOUGHBY CONNOR,
President, T.P.S*
Phrenological Rooms,
June 9th, 1890.


Before describing what Phrenology is, I will en-
deavour to sketch the extreme misconceptions of the
science, by the masses, and by the scientists.
. masses being the most numerous, if the least
intelligent, attract our first attention by the ludicrous
ideas they have of Phrenology. One in particular calls
oudly foi 1 exposure the notion that the science is a
method of fortune telling. It is not unusual (even in
this city) for practitioners to be addressed in this fashion.
“ Please Mr. I’ve come to have my fortune told ”
is - not necessar 7 me to tell the audience
that this is a false view of the subject—it is simnlv
idiotic. 1 J
The most widely spread fallacy, one in fact not con-
lined to the masses, is the idea of bumps—to the un-
initiated the term bumps means Phrenology, and
Phrenology means bumps—it begins in bumps and ends
in bumps, and is divided into bumps good, and bumps
bad—as though they thought that the Phrenologist
believed God had made one half of man, and the devil
the other half. Whence the notion originated it is hard
to trace—it certainly was not with the Phrenologists.
This term has been used as the chief weapon of attack
by opponents from the earliest times. Their aim was to
cast ridicule and in order to do so, it was necessary to
invent a falsity—it has been used, and used, and twisted
and turned, like a thread-bare carpet, for tea party
to prance out their wit upon; it has become so
monotonous, that by this time it should be only capable
of amusing the nonentities who employ it. Time after
time this has been explained but without much effect •
the Philosophical replies to the groundless accusation
have not as yet been couched in sufficiently vigorous
language to receive the attention they deserve. Were I
to retaliate on our critics, the epithets they apply to us
RENO LOGY.


I would say : —Bump is a term invented by rascals and
used by fools—there is no such thing in the science of
Phrenology.
The scientific critic next deserves attention.
He is frequently an individual with a string of
letters at the end of his name sufficient to awe the
average reader into an acceptance of his views without
further investigation, but spite of the number of his
degrees, and the boldness of his assertions, the Phre-
nologist dissects his objections and invariably finds them
founded on ignorance, yes, ignorance of even the
fundamental principles of Phrenology, such as might be
learned by the study of a Id. hand-book. This does not
speak highly for the boasted science of the nineteenth
century, and I venture a personal opinion that if half the
theories at present accepted are founded on no deeper
investigations than those made into the merits of this
science, if these theories are as crudely and hastily formed
as the judgments on Phrenology, then the next generation
will be occupied in Herculean tasks of demolishing the
rubbishing structures raised by biased so called seekers
after truth.
To prove the statement I have made I will quote an
assertion by Dr. M. A. Starr in the “ Popular Science
Monthly,” he says “ that it is impossible to draw any
conclusion from the size or shape of the head as to the
extent or surface of the brain, and so, as to the mental
capacity. It is absurd to judge of the brain surface by
either the size of the head or the extent of the super-
ficial irregular surface which ip covered by the skull,
without taking into consideration the number of folds
and the depth of the creases.” “ Por a little brain with
many deep folds may really, when spread out, have a
larger surface than a large brain with few shallow
folds.”
The inference evidently intended to be drawn from
the foregoing statement, is that Phrenologists are
ignorant of this seeming obstacle. That such conclusion


has been drawn is evident, by its quotation by the press
of the world as the death blow to Phrenology.
Had Dr. Starr read a work on the science be would
never have made the objection; bad be seen the book
I will now quote from, be would have feared to pose as a
fool or worse. The book is old enough to satisfy any-
one that it is not a recent innovation, as it was published
in 1849, it not only shows that Phrenologists were con-
versant with convolutions as affecting the area of brain
surface, but that they bad a means of ascertaining their
relative development in the living brain. Sidney Smith,
in “ The Principles of Phrenology ” remarks, “Size of
brain is, therefore, not altogether measured by the skull,
but by the number of folds and depth of convolutions, a
matter, as shall be afterwards explained, to J)e ascer-
tained from temperament and development.” Again,
“The depth of the cerebral convolutions, or of the
cineritious, or grey matter which forms the outer part of
the brain, and which, during life is of a deep flesh color
containing a great quantity of blood, is, as has been
already explained, intimately connected with, and is,
indeed, the index of mental activity or energy. In
animals of the lowest grade of intelligence these con-
volutions are almost wanting, and they increase in
number and depth as the scale of mind ascends, —being
deepest and largest in man. They are most profound
and most numerous in the intellectual or anterior
regions of the brain, not so numerous in the coronal
surface, the site of the moral sentiments, and still less so
in the locality of the propensities.”
This is treated at greater length in other portions
of the work quoted from.
My space will not admit further comparison though
materials for such could be readily obtained.
The recklessness manifested by some scientists when
treating this subject is one of the greatest blots on the
intelligence of the age, and the spread of Phreno-
logy is exposing them to justly merited contempt. But
6


as this science is rapidly spreading, their theories in the
near future will not he received with the respectful
wonder and ready acquiesence of the past.
The study of mind began in selfishness; the desire
to fathom motives, and estimate the abilities of one’s
fellows, appears to be as old as the formation of society,
and we can trace the evidence of such study in the
proverbs of the nations. As man emerged from bar-
barism, the observation of characteristics expanded into
two schools, namely, the Physiognomists, or those who
affected to discern the habitual and possible manifesta-
tions of mentality from organism; and the Metaphysicians
or those who endeavored to evolve from the con-
templation of their inner consciousness, the component
parts of the human mind.
In the latter part of the eighteenth century, a new
direction to the study of mind was given by Dr. Gall.
Dr. Gall was born in the Grand Duchy of Baden,
Germany, on the 9th of March, 1758. Prom his youth
he was an earnest student of character, and while still a
young man had succeeded in detecting certain connec-
tions between manifestation of mind and cranial develop-
ment. Having taken his degree of Physician at Vienna,
he investigated the claims and studied the works of his
forerunners in the field of mind; the conflicting opinions
of opposing schools determined him to accept the dogma
of no man. His youthful observation of the connection
between organism and manifestation, srave him the key
to the true means of gaining the desired end, and at last
despairing of reconciling natural phenomana with the
theory of the schools, he abandoned the barren labours
of thinkers for the observation of the one true and
unbiased teacher —Nature. After many years of patient
investigation he gave his first lecture on the observations
he had made, at Vienna, in the year 1796, and for five
years he discoursed publicly upon his views. On the 9th
January, 1802, the Austrian Government ordered him
to cease, as they considered his doctrines dangerous to
7


religion. The endeavour to silence the innovator met
with the usual fortune of mistaken legislation—it simply
increased public curiosity—Gall could not be silent—his
sense of duty to the race—his appreciation of truth, was
stronger than “ general orders.” To remain in Austria
was to be silent—filled as he was with the importance
of his discoveries, to him silence was living death. But
the efforts already made were not without fruit, his
lectures had attracted the attention of Dr. Spurzheim,
who after four years investigation became an active
propagator of the new system, and in 1804 was associated
with Gall in efforts to unvail the indications of
mental faculties; and in 1805 they left Vienna
to pursue their investigations and to disseminate
the results already obtained. In 1807 Gall made Paris
his permanent home. The publication of the “The
Anatomy and Physiology of the Nervous System, &c.,”
took place in 1809, the joint work of Gall and Spurzheim.
They continued their investigations together until 1813
when Spurzheim left Paris to visit Vienna, and
ultimately to commence a campaign in Great Britain.
Gall died at Paris in 1828, in the seventy-first year of
his age. Spurzheim broached the subject in Great
Britain, Ireland and America, where he died from a
fever contracted through over exertion. I cannot pass
the death of this earnest advocate of the new doctrines
without commenting on the noble tribute paid by a
citizen of Boston to the illustrious dead; it was the
erection of a beautiful Italian monument marked with
the single name “ Spurzheim.”
The circumstances of his death from over work in a
foreign land, will, I feel convinced (from the direction of
modern investigations), cause his epitaph to be written in
the annals of the world’s sages as,
Spurzheim
Died in the cause of Truth,
1832.


George Combe was the next great leader of the
new School and has left in his works a fitting monu-
ment to his genius. After his death the Powler Bros,
extended the influence of the science in the United
States, and ultimately founded the American School of
Phrenology, which has been further adorned with the
geniuses of Wells, Sizer, and Drayton.
Among the opponents of Spurzheim in Great
Britain, Sir William Hamilton posed as leader, on
account of his persistent hostility and the reputation he
at that time possessed as an authority on Anatomy and
Physiology.
He merely succeeded in displaying to impartial
observers that he was inferior to the Phrenologists both
in Anatomy and Physiology.
As he succeeded in retarding the acceptance of this
science, and his exploded views are still spoken of as
objections, I quote from Professor Huxley in order to
indicate the worth of Hamilton’s testimony.
Huxley states in the “ Nineteenth Century,” “ Sir
William Hamilton, learned historian and acute critic as
he was, not only failed to apprehend the philosophical
bearing of long established physiological truths, but
when he affirmed that there is no reason to deny that
the mind feels at the finger points, and none to assert
that the brain is the sole organ of thought, he showed
that he had not apprehended the signification of the
revolution commenced, two hundred years before his
time by Descartes, and effectively followed up by Haller,
Hartley, and Bonnet, in the middle of the last century.”
So much for Sir William Hamilton. But what of
Professor Huxley ? Has he examined the claims of the
science ? He denies the ability of the judge, what of the
judged ? Surely it should have occurred to one of his
ability that it was just possible that Phrenology was not
granted a fair hearing.
But the scientific generations run in adulatory
grooves—to be an object of ridicule is not respectable


is not scientific, so these men hang in unbroken series
on the clever exponents of systems not too far in advance
of the age.
The religious aspect of the subject is grossly mis-
construed. My answer to objectors on this ground is
simply, —if Phrenology is false it cannot endure, if it is
true —can truth oppose truth ?
Whenever an opponent professes to review this
science he invariably chooses the Phrenology of G-all,
Spurzheim and Combe; he never for a moment con-
descends to imagine that it has advanced since their
time —oh dear no —hut if one should he daring enough
to review Geology and condemn it on account of the
crude conceptions of its founders, the scientific world
would immediately write him down ignoramus. Still,
in spite of their indifference, it has advanced by slow
and sure degrees to a condition that can challenge any
science of similar age to produce results equal in
magnitude and accuracy.
Another source from which many people glean their
information on this matter is the Encyclopedias.
Some time ago when examining an edition of
“ Beeton’s Encyclopedia”, (an excellent work by the way
on general topics). I was much amused with the
description of and critique on Phrenology, they had evi-
dently been unhappy in their choice of a reviewer, he
was one not yet wise enough to understand that there
might possibly he a few subjects that his Solon-like
intellect had failed to grasp. lie had obviously
directed his attention to one of the oldest works on the
subject, without troubling to enquire into the progress
made since the period of its publication. What would
he your judgment of a man, who, on being asked to
view a river and express his opinion of it, proceeded to
the spring from which it took its rise, and then, without
seeking further, exclaimed. “ This is not a river ! It is
only a puddle.” According to iEsop a healthy ass may
kick a dying lion, the reviewer has evidently acted upon


this, hut he made the mistake of choosing a remarkably
flourishing victim to exercise his heels upon. We must
follow the reviewer’s wild career. He mentions only 35
organs, whereas there are 42. He uses the Pathological
temperaments instead of the Phrenological ones which
have been in use so long, and does not mention the
qualifications. Again, he states that “ The science of
the mind is the most complex and incomprehensive
of all sciences,” and yet in the next line; “If
Phrenology he true, mental philosophy is so simple
that he who runs may read.” Which I suppose to mean
that, that which is beyond his ability should he a mere
bagatelle to others.
I admire a well constructed fiction, and when
meeting such a flight of fancy as that which follows I
can quite appreciate the grand scorn for facts dis-
played by its Author, he asserts, “ Phrenology was not
discovered, it was invented.”
Phrenology is a system of mental philosophy,
founded on observation of manifestation of mind, through
organised matter. In its more restricted sense, it is the
philosophy of mind, founded on observation oi the
connection between the Physiology of the brain, and
mental manifestation.
It is a Philosophy and an art. Phrenology does
not as yet claim to be perfect either as a science or an
art; hut that it is nearer to truth (as man can at present
perceive it) than any system previously developed.
Its chief Principles, are the folloAving: —
Ist. The Brain is the organ of the mind.
2nd. Each Eaculty of the mind has its separate or
special Organ in the Brain.
3rd. Organs related to each other in function are
grouped together in the Brain.
4th. Size, other things being equal, is the measure
of Power.
sth. The Physiological conditions of the Body effect
Mental Manifestation.


6th. Any Faculty may be Improved by Cultivation,
and may deteriorate through Neglect.
7th. Every Faculty is normally Good, but liable to
perversion.
What mind is, apart from organism we do not
pretend to state, as we only judge of the existence and
quality of a faculty in the mind, through the class of
function performed by its organ in the brain. This
being a science of facts it does not build up theories
without tangible evidence, it does not either deny or
assert that of which it knows nothing. Put still this
does not shut out speculation on the nature of mind,
and its connection with the brain, which is called
advanced Phrenologists the “ Inner Philosophy,” and
there have been and are practical teachers of the art,
who scarcely dream of the vast field of speculation open
to their fellows ; greater than, and absorbing all of the
past and present, that will stand the test of the science.
I have known a man attracted to the art by the vulgar
desire to pry into his neighbours’ fads and failings, when
confronted with the grand structure of the scarcelv
dreamed of speculative Phrenology, stand like a timid
child at the threshold of a dark room. This is the turn-
ing point with many : some plunge into the Philosophy
and j>ay little attention to the art, others practice the
art and scarcely heed the Philosophy.
Phrenology, as an art, next deserves our attention,
and the portion I will treat is confined to human nature.
I his department of Phrenology has been sadly misused
and misrepresented by so called Phrenologists who by
their presumption and ignorance lowered it in the
eyes of the public.
I will now describe the system used by the
Tasmanian Society.
The art of character reading is divided into two
branches, viz., chart marking and delineation.
Chart marking is a term applied to the recording of
mental and physical developments as approximated by


a Phrenologist; the means by which this end is arrived
at are too lengthy and technical to he readily explained
so 1 will merely indicate the developments to he
observed and the effect they have on manifestations.
Ist, By measurements the size of brain is estimated,
and by this means the key to the marking
of the chart; for around this as a centre,
cluster regional, and bodily development.
Having obtained the number of the head we next
proceed to the
2nd. Step. The estimation of bodily development.
The body is divided into three temperaments,
and each of these are sub-divided into three.
Ist. The Motive Temperament.
2nd. Vital
3rd. Mental „
The Motive Temperament serves the purposes of
locomotion, and consists of the bones, muscles and
ligaments.
The Vital Temperament nourishes the organism and
consists of the lymphatics, the blood vessels, and the
glands.
The Mental Temperament is made up of the organs
ot sense, the brain, and the nerves.
Having recorded the development of each temper-
ament, we proceed to estimate the Qualifications, of
IctTvity 1 er6 thr6e ' viz ‘~ Excitability, and
Excitability is connected with the sensory system
and its development is one of the indications of
susceptibility to environment.
Activity is connected with the motor system, and
its development is one of the indications of ability to act
on environment.
Quality is basic, underlying the whole system, and
v hen the quality is fine it intensifies all manifestation.


It has long been recognised in this degree of development
as blood or breeding.
The next stage is to estimate the health of the
ndividual under examination. When this is indicated, we
proceed to judge of the regional development of the
brain, which is divided into —
Ist. The propensities which consist of the Social
and the Selfish Groups.
2nd. The Intellectual Faculties comprise the
Perceptives, Pcflectives, and Literary Groups.
3rd. The Moral Sentiments, divided into the Selfish
Sentiments, the Semi-Intellectual, and the
Religious organs.
The approximation of the individual organs is the
next procedure, which are at present 42 in number. The
mere repetition of their names which is all my space
affords would be rather wearisome, so I omit them and
pass on to the last stage of the marking, the indication
of the relative activity of the organs of the brain. This
is obtained by regional heat and other means, known
only to the experienced Phrenologist.
The uses of a properly marked chart are to indicate
the direction of a harmonious development, or the means
by which the mental and physical powers can be best
trained to a given end, also to restrain or develop strong
or weak faculties, etc. Unfortunately the “Chart
System ” is a means by which the unscrupulous may
gull the public, as, being divided into so many organs
and conditions, it is impossible for the to
detect discrepancies between marking and characteristics.
The art of portraying the individual, and displaying his
peculiarities (which may be successfully performed
without seeing him) is called “ Delineation.”
This is the most intricate part of character reading,
and until he can perform the feat of marking a chart
and delineating the character therefrom, no one is in a
position to pass an intelligent judgment on the Science
of Phrenology.


It is somewhat difficult to convey the means by
which this end is arrived at, hut I may state that by
noting the development of the regions and organs of the
brain, and calculating the effect of bodily and other
conditions, somewhat after the fashion of the parallelo-
gram of forces, we succeed in describing appearance and
characteristics.
But Phrenology does not stop here, it estimates
individuals, and also the relations of individuals to one
another and to their surroundings. Its philosophy answers
many old world problems such as—what is the cause of
social inequality ?—mental inequality. This is the
answer to the Political Economists, the Socialists, and
the Unionists. While they rave of physical equality and
neglect to develop mental equality, they follow the
will-o’-the-wisp that has led scores of civilized states to
anarchy and destruction. They may argue that they
will educate the intellect by the wide spread state school
system. Phrenology replies—The intellect is only one
part of man’s mentality, it is not the best educated or
the most intellectual, who at present hold the wealth of
the world ; but those (or their immediate heirs) who
manifested the most ability to acquire and to hold, in
other words, those best suited to the present conditions of
society. The race as a whole presents wonderful varia-
bility, and it is the realization of this fact that places the
Phrenologist far above the old Metaphysician who set his
own mental development before the world as a standard
for humanity. The Phrenologists established an ideal
standard, the average development of the race, in which
all human faculty was equally represented. The know-
ledge of this fact makes me state that any sudden
change in the present state of society will create a.
dominant order of that class best suited to the new con-
ditions. The world is at present in a state of turmoil,
there is a gathering of the peoples, the clashing of classes,
the ranting of wordy demagogues, who, whether learned
or unlearned, are prophesying future Utopias, heedless


of the fact that Mental Inequality guards their portals
as of old.
The present strength of the science deserves attention,
its followers are numbered by millions, and it is spreading
in all classes of society; the literature of the day is
saturated with its terms and portions of its philosophy :
its very opponents are using its results undesignedly,
much to the amusement of the initiated. The sale of
its literature is vast and is rapidly increasing.
The true path has at last been struck, the only road
that can lead to satisfactory results. The hour for the
general acceptance of the science is at hand. The
Anthropologists have trespassed on Phrenological ground
and are unknowingly proving its truth, the physiologists
with their brain centres have blindly supported the
assertions of Gall; the acceptance of hypnotism by the
learned is paving the path, for it has demonstrated
Phrenology for the last 48 years. Everywhere rents are
apjiearing in the fortress of scientific opinion: for years
Phrenologists have been collecting their forces : for years
they have been studying the advances of their opponents.
As a breach appears it is filled by a Phrenologist, ready
to attack, ready to fight against ignorance and prejudice.
The means used by opponents have turned against them-
selves, the ridicule they have so unsparingly used has
eliminated from the ranks of the science the foppish and
sapless. It has left men of vigour, men of indomitable will,
men on whose armour ridicule strikes only to fail, men
who fight for truth and fight to win. Eor the father-
hood of God is the Religion of Phrenology. It’s objects,
the brotherhood of man and the progress of the race.

To the Hon. Sec.,
PHRENOLOGICAL SOCIETY.
Dear Sir,
Having heard, that statements reflecting on the ability of Mr.
Sheridan, to read character, have been made bv people who do not
understand the science of Phrenology, or who are prejudiced against
that gentleman, allow me to state, that I consider it impossible
for any person to do what Mr. Sheridan has done, without a thorough
knowledge of the science. While Mr. Sheridan was locked in a small
room, my head was examined by Mr. Connor, and marked on a
blackboard. When completed, Mr Connor left the room, after which
Mr. Sheridan was allowed to look at the board. After a few remarks
such as “ this gentleman is tall, strong limbed, very excitable, a good
speaker, a member of Chalmer’s Literary Society”—he turned round
immediately, and without the slighest hesitation pointed to me, as I
sat amongst the audience. There could be no collusion about this,
as I was entirely unacquainted with Mr. Sheridan, previous to this
meeting, and further, he did not speak to any person in the room
before reading my character. Not being an adept in the Science, but
taking a great interest in its development. I consider that I am in
duty bound to contribute my share of praise to Mr. Sheridan for his
excellent and interesting essay.
I have the honor,
Sir, to be
Yours most respectfully,
S. J. HYDE.
