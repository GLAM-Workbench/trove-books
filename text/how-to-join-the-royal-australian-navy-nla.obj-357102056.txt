The Royal Australian Navy.
The Royal Australian Navy affords men and boys fond of sea life
an opportunity of following a calling congenial to their tastes.
Service in the Royal Australian Navy will appeal strongly to the
men and youth of Australia, for the Commonwealth Navy crystallizes
Australian aspirations for Naval Defence, and, whilst it will continue
to cherish and maintain the worthiest traditions of the Mother Navy,
the Royal Australian Navy will be administered and controlled by
the Government elected by the people of the Commonwealth.
The rates of pay have been fixed after careful consideration of the
average earnings in equivalent employments on shore. It will be
found that the Royal Australian Navy rates of pay compare not
unfavorably with those ruling on shore, but when one takes into
account the permanent nature of the Naval employment; the fact
of being doctored, clothed, lodged, fed, at no cost to oneself; the
leave given from tune to time on full pay (and extended in case of
illness); and the additional amounts it is possible for one to earn
whilst acting in certain capacities, the scale tilts decidedly in favour
of the Naval vocation.
Men in the Navy are not always at sea when earning pay, as in
the Merchant service. In the Navy, as far as the numbers available
and the exigencies of the Service permit, men get alternative periods
of shore and sea-going service. In a few of the posts on shore married
quarters are also provided.
At the age of about 45, men are eligible, as far as vacancies permit,
for permanent Naval service on shore in connexion with the various
Auxiliary Naval Services, and, if not so employed, receive preference
of employment in a civilian capacity in H.M.A. Naval Establishments
as vacancies occur.
Advancement, in due course, brings with it increased pay; and
a special allowance to married men, according to size of family,
makes it possible for men to take up the Navy as a permanent
profession.
The food is good and varied.
The attention of parents and guardians is drawn to the value of
the technical training imparted in the Royal Australian Navy to
boys entered in the Training Ship, fitting them to be “ Handy Men,”
and enhancing their earning capacity should they ultimately return
to shore employment.
Officers are entered through the Royal Australian Naval College at
Jervis Bay, where they start their career as Cadet-Midshipmen at
the age of 13 to 14 after selective examination. (The Regulations
regarding the Royal Australian Naval College are published
separately.)
C. 3449,


Commissioned rank can also be obtained, in limited numbers,
according to vacancies, by Petty Officers and Men ; also Warrant
Rank, to a larger extent.
The entry and training of boys and men, shortly put, is as follows :
(a) Seaman boys are entered between the ages of 14| and 16,
and carry out twelve months’ training in H.M.A. ship
Tingira (moored in Sydney Harbor). They are then sent
to a sea-going ship to complete training.
(6) Youths between the ages of 18 and 25 are entered as stokers,
and, after a preliminary training at the Naval Depot,
Williamstown, are sent to sea-going ships.
(c) The requirements of the R.A.N. necessitate, in addition to
the main divisions of seamen and stokers, men competent
to carry out the work of carpenters, blacksmiths, sail-
makers, plumbers, painters, coopers, shipwrights, elec-
tricians, bandsmen, cooks, butchers, stewards, writers,
&c., &c.
Mechanics, such as engine -fitters, coppersmiths, boiler-
makers, enginesmiths, instrument makers, &0., are
accepted, if suitable, and are graded upon entry in the
Chief Petty Officer rating—a rating which carries special
privileges.
PERIOD REQUIRED TO SIGN ON FOR.
Seven years from date of entry {or from age of 18 if subsequent to
entry).
In peace time, when sufficient reasons can be given (such as being
sole support of dependent parents), purchase of discharge will be
permitted (as an act of grace and not of right) under such conditions
as may be prescribed by the Naval Board. The purchase money
payable represents a proportion of the expense incurred by the
Government in training the individual concerned.
On completion of first engagement, men who are desirous of re-
engaging will be allowed to do so (subject to the decision of the
Naval Board as to suitability), for further periods of five years at a
time, and will, generally, be retired from the sea-going service at
the age of 40. In special cases men may, as far as vacancies permit,
be retained for five or ten years. When finally discharged from the
sea-going forces further employment may be given on shore, as
already explained, in connexion with the Naval Auxiliary Forces.
Men discharged other than for misconduct, and not so employed, will
be given preference in civil employment in or connected with His
Majesty’s Australian Naval Establishments.


Don't be afraid of signing on for seven years. You cannot be trained
for the Naval Service in a day, and everything is done to make life
in the Royal Australian Navy a happy and comfortable one. A
Naval career subjects you to no more restrictions than are necessary
in the general interests of any other body of men, and, in most
ways, is a freer life altogether.
Youths and boys are particularly desired who intend to take up
the Navy as a permanent career. Australia will maintain in its
Navy conditions as to pay, prospects and life generally, such as
compare favourably with other walks of life on shore.
It is to the interest, as well as being the desire, of responsible
Officers to take every care of the professional, physical, mental, and
social welfare of lads entrusted to the Naval Service, and to
make the conditions such that they will be attracted to re-engage
from time to time.
Allotments. —Facilities are given for allotting money to families and
friends, free of expense, and in special cases an allowance out of
public funds is made to dependent relatives.
Rations. —A free and liberal ration is given. When not given in
kind an allowance in lieu is made.
Medical Attendance and medicine are given free of charge ; in
cases requiring it, treatment in a general hospital is allowed, full
pay being continued, except when under medical treatment for
disease resulting from their own indiscretion or misconduct.
Outfit.—- A free kit is given on first entry, and, after twelve months,
an allowance for upkeep.
Promotion.- —The special rules governing promotion in each class
are shown under the various classes. Promotions to Warrant and
Commissioned rank, and advancement from one grade to another,
are made as vacancies exist, and are subject to such regulations as
may be prescribed.
Compensation. —Men who are retired from the service on account
of injuries received on duty may receive compensation varying up
to a maximum of three years’ pay, according to circumstances, and
similarly the widows and children of men who lose their lives on
duty, or from the effects of injury or disease contracted on duty
may receive compensation not exceeding three years’ pay.
Leave.- —Twenty-eight days’ leave per annum is granted when the
exigencies of the Service permit, and six months on full pay after
20 years’ service.
Married Allowance. —When a man becomes married his pay is
substantially increased.

PHYSICAL AND EDUCATIONAL TESTS.
Medical. —Candidates are subject to a strict examination by a
Naval Medical Officer before entry, to ascertain if they are free from
any physical defect or disability. At places where no Naval Medical
Officer is available, the Military Area Officer arranges for a provisional
medical examination by a local medical practitioner.
Height measurement is taken without shoes ; chest measurement
without clothes. The chest measurement is the mean between the
maximum measurement with chest inflated and the minimum with
chest deflated.
Candidates should ascertain that they come up to the standard
in these respects, and should, as a rule, apply by letter or on the
form attached hereto before incurring travelling expenses in pro-
ceeding to a recruiting office.
Candidates who are accepted by Recruiting Officers are sent, free
of cost to themselves, to the Naval Depot, Williamstown, or Training
Ship at Sydney.
Candidates rejected at the final examination at a Naval Depot are
granted a free travelling pass to their homes.
Educational Test. —The lowest test for any candidate is that he
shall be able —(a) to read a short passage from a IV.
reading-book, or, if not available, from a newspaper ; ( h ) write a
similar passage of about six lines slowly read over, and then dictated ;
to have a fair knowledge of the first four rules of arithmetic. The
further test for special ratings is shown against each rating.
Physical Standard. —The following is approximately the standard
height and mean chest measurement required. It must be under-
stood, however, that these figures are merely a guide to save candi-
dates expense or disappointment, and not the official standard required
(which is subject to alteration): —


SEAMAN BOYS
Age— l4J to 16,
Boys are entered for training in H.M.A.S. Tingira as seamen,
signalmen, telegraphists, writers, or ship’s stewards. The selection

according to suitability and vacancies existing, the wishes of
candidates being considered as far as possible. Candidates must he
of very good character ; they must produce the written consent of
their parents or guardians to their entering the Royal Australian
Navy and to their signing an engagement to serve therein up till the
age of 18, and for a period of seven years thereafter.

branches :—Seaman, Signal, Wireless Telegraphy, Writers, and Ship’s
Stewards. Promotion may be gained in special cases to Warrant
Officer (Gunner, Boatswain, Signal Boatswain, Warrant Telegraphist,
Warrant Writer, or Warrant Steward), and, in a limited number of
cases, promotion to Commissioned rank.
Boys commence to count their seven years’ service from the age
