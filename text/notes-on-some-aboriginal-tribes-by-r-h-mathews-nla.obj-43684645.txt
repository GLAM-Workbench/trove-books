NOTES ON SOME ABORIGINAL TRIBES.

In this paper I have supplied some genealogies which have
never before been published respecting the intermarrying
laws of the aborigines in different parts of the Australian
continent. The genealogies referred to, contained in
Tables 11., IV., and Y., are the results of several years’
careful inquiry, and it is believed that their accuracy is
unassailable. The application of these genealogical tables
to the sociology of several tribes is briefly and clearly
explained, A few remarks are added on the absence of
exogamy among any of the tribes treated in this article.
Since 1895 I have been devoting some attention to the
sociology of the Arranda tribe, amongst others, in the
Northern Territory. Mr. W. H. Wiltshire, who resided at
Alice Springs from 1881 for a number of years, gave this
region the name of “Central Australia,” being a specious
and romantic name for his book. That name was adopted
by Spencer and Gillen for the same reason. There is,
however, no such place as Central Australia known to
geographers —that portion of the continent being shown on
our maps as the Northern Territory. I have not personally
visited the country occupied by the Arranda, but I have
been fortunate enough to collect much information, from
persons who went out to the mineral fields, from managers
of cattle and horse stations, from telegraph operators,
the police and others; all of whom have resided in that
district for many years.

I had the subject sufficiently in hand by 1898 to enable
me to take the responsibility of communicating a short
article to the American Philosophical Society containing
the following table of the intermarrying laws of the
Arranda tribe, 1 in which I stated that descent was through
the females.
The four women in the column headed “Wife” in the
upper half of the table constitute the Cycle A, and have
perpetual succession amongst themselves. Purula has a
daughter Bangata, who has a daughter Ngala, who has a
daughter Paltara, who has a daughter Purula, thus revert-
ing to the commencement of the series. The lower half
of the table or Cycle B has exactly the same constitution.
This is sufficient evidence that the devolution of the section
names is through the women. Every one of the daughters
would of course have brothers belonging to the same
section name as herself.
Taking the first line in the table, we see that Pananka
marries a Purulu woman, who is his tabular or No. I wife,
and the offspring is Bangata. But Pananka could instead
marry a Ngala woman, as his alternative or No. II spouse.
Bev. L. Schulze 2 was the first to report the alternative

marriages among the Arranda. Mr. Schulze, however,
arrived at the conclusion that descent was paternal, and the
same opinion was subsequently adopted by Spencer and
Gillen in their book dealing with the natives of that district. 1
With the view of throwing additional light upon the dis-
puted question of succession, I obtained from one of my
most capable correspondents, residing in that locality, the
names of more than a dozen married pairs, with their
pedigrees, reaching back one generation, and forward one
generation, from which I have taken at random the four
couples given in the following table. In these four cases,
each man is married to a tabular or No. I wife :
An explanation of one of the married couples in the above
table will answer for all the rest. I have given the English
name of each person, so that they can be easily found and
further interrogated. No. 1, Paul, a Mbitjana, marries
Helena, No. la, a Bangata, and their children are Ngala.
On the same line and to the left of Paul, we find Knuraia,
the section of his mother; and a little farther to the left,
in the next column, is Ngala, the section to which Paul’s
father belongs. Taking No. 1a we find that Helena’s

mother was Purula and her father Pananka. We have,
therefore three generations on the same line across the
page, the parents, the grand-parents and the children. We
also observe that the sections of each married pair, the
sections of their parents, and the section name of the
progeny are exactly in accord with Table I. If we had
selected a list of men who had married alternative or No.
II wives, the details would have been different. 1
When the Arranda people are in camp, the fathers and
sons will have their resting places near each other, because
the sons belong to their father’s tribe and inherit their
father’s hunting grounds. For example, the Pananka and
Bangata men will be close together; the Purula and
Kamara men will also be near one another; and so on for
all the men of the other sections who stand in the relation-
ship of fathers and sons. This fact has caused superficial
observers to believe that the sections which camp together
in this way are those belonging to the same cycle or phratry.
Just the contrary is the fact —the fathers and the sons
belong to opposite phratries or cycles, although they belong
to the same local division of the tribe and frequently roam
about together.
In order to further test the line of descent among tribes
possessing eight subdivisions, I requested another com-
petent correspondent to obtain genealogies of several
married pairs in the Chingalee tribe about Powell’s Creek
and Daly Waters. To enable us to understand the genea-
logies, it will be necessary to tabulate the eight inter-
marrying sections, first published by me in 1900:— 2

most of the section names has the termination inja, as Chungaleeinja,

The above table shows that the tribe is classified into
two cycles or phratries A and B, like the Arranda, each
cycle containing four sections. The women of a cycle, A
for example, have perpetual succession in a prescribed
order the same as the Arranda. Every woman has brothers
of the same section as herself.
If we take the first name in the table, it will serve as an
illustration of all the others. Chimitcha’s “tabular” or
normal wife is Chungalee, whom we shall call No. I. He
can in certain cases marry Ohula, whom we have denomin-
ated his “alternative” wife or No. 11. Or he can take a
Chuna woman, distinguished as No. HI. And further,
Chimitcha may espouse a Chimitcha maiden, whom we
shall set down as his No. IV wife. Looking at the table
we observe that two of Chimitcha’s possible wives belong
to Cycle B and two to Cycle A, and it is manifest that the
denomination of his children will depend upon the woman
he takes for his wife.
In further explanation of Table 111., a woman may like-
wise be alloted a partner from any one of four sections, two
of whom belong to the opposite cycle and two to her own.
Chungalee the first woman in the table may marry Chimitcha
as her No. I husband, Chuna as No. 11, or Chula as No. 111,

or Ohimitcha as No. IV. But it is immaterial to the
descent of the offspring which of these men she marries;
her children are Taralee just the same, because the devolu-
tion of the sections as well as of the cycles is unalterably
through the mother only.
From a list supplying the details of upwards of twenty
marriages among members of the Chingalee tribe, person-
ally known to my correspondent, I have selected the
following eight individuals or four married pairs as examples
This table is the same in structure as Table 11. No. 1,
Long Dick, a Chungalee, marries No. la, Minnie, a Chula,
and their children are Tungaree. On the same line to the
left of Dick we find Tungaree, the name of his mother’s
section. And in the next column to the left is Champina,
the section to which Dick’s father belongs, and so on for
all the rest. In comparing this table with Table 111, we
discover that Nos. 2 and 3 are married to the normal or
tabular wives. No. 1 has a No. 11l wife, whilst No. 4 has
a spouse of the No. IV type. Again, the fathers of Nos, 1a
and 3b have No. 11l wives. The fathers of Nos. 2a and 4a
have No. II wives. It may be mentioned that Table IV,


although nominally dealing with four married pairs, actu-
ally gives the section names of twelve men, as well as the
sections to which their wives belong. The same remark
applies to Table 11, ante.
Although I have occasionally collected lists of native
words for different degrees of relationship, I have not yet
published any of them. There' are generally so many
different persons who could come under any given name,
that a list would not be of much value other than as a
vocabulary. For example, a man’s father, mother’s father,
father’s father, son’s wife, daughter’s husband, etc., could
belong to any one of four sections. Unless we first of all
have the section name, we cannot identify the division of
any one of the people just mentioned, by their so called
“relationship terms.” These terms do not define either
kinship or consanguinity.
In the same way there are many other names of kindred
whose section names differ with the man or woman the
individual has married. To hear one man address another
gives no definite idea of either the cycle or the section to
which the person addressed belongs. In the Chingalee
tribe a man’s father is Keeta. 1 Looking at Table IV, if we
take No. la, Minnie, a Chula, we see that her father,
whom she speaks of as keeta, instead ef being Ohemara as
in Table 111, is actually Tungaree, a man of the opposite
cycle to Chemara.
With regard to the well known sexual license which is
permitted at important native ceremonies all over Aus-
tralia, I requested some of my correspondents in the
Northern Territory to obtain the names of the sections of
the men who participated. 2 The result was that in most
1 Queensland Geographical Journal, xvi., (1901), p. 87, in my Vocabu-
lary of Chingalee words.

cases the women whose favours were obtained by a given
man, belonged to the sections from which he could claim a
No. 1,2, 3or 4 wife. Exceptions were of course observed
as we should expect, judging by the variations in other
native rules. I notice that Spencer and Gillen 1 in report-
ing cases of sexual liberties of this kind, give examples
which would mostly fall respectively within the scope of
Nos. 1,2, 3 and 4 marriages. The authors were not aware
of the Nos. 3 and 4 types of marriage, but certain women
whom they mention answer the description.
Anyone advocating paternal descent among theOhingalee
might perhaps lay stress upon the fact that the child is
always assigned the section name of its father’s father.
There is, however, no weight at all in that argument,
because the very same thing happens in the Karailaroi,
Wiradjuri, Barkunjee, etc., where the descent is unmis-
takably through the mother only. Not only so, but in every
tribe I know possessing female descent all over Australia,
the child takes the section name of its father’s father.
This law holds good no matter whether the tribe be divided
into two, or four, or eight intermarrying sections.
In former articles I have described the social organisa-
tion of the Barkunjee 2 and Karailaroi tribes. It will be
interesting to show the resemblance of the social structure
of these tribes to that of the Ohingalee and Arranda. In
the Barkunjee there are only two principal divisions —the
cycles —and the name of the offspring is determined through
the women. The men of one cycle marry the women of
the opposite one or else the women of their own cycle,
which is tantamount to the statement that the aggregate
of men in one cycle can marry all the women of the tribe.
* Northern Tribes, 134-136 and 138-139.
* This Journal, xxxix., 118.


Then comes the Kamilaroi organisation with two part-
itions of each cycle. 1 The men may marry into the
opposite cycle or else into their own, while the cycle and
section name of the progeny is in all cases regulated
through the mothers. In other words, the men of one
cycle, taken collectively, can marry into all the divisions
of the tribe.
Next we take the Chingalee people, Table 111, and find
that the community is segregated into two cycles just as
in the Barkunjee, but each cycle contains four parts instead
of one. The*men of a cycle can marry into the opposite
one or into their own and the section names of the offspring
are fixed through the females. Therefore the men of one
cycle collectively can intermarry with all the women of
the community.
From what has been said, the conclusion seems inevitable
that the social structure of the Barkunjee, Kamilaroi and
Chingalee is essentially and radically the same in all its
leading elements. The chief or only difference is that in
the two first named the totems have succession through
the mothers, whilst in the latter their succession does not
depend upon either parent, but is fixed by the locality
where the mother first became conscious that conception
had occurred. In previous articles 2 1 have described the
native belief in regard to this matter and will only briefly
allude to it here.
The component parts of a tribe having this form of
organisation are in many respects similar to the Kamilaroi.
For example, there is a local division of a tribe, in which
tliere are persons bearing the totem names of animals, trees,
the elements, etc. People whose totems may belong to
any or all of these departments of the universe roam about
1 American Antiquarian, xxym., 85, 83.
‘ This Journal, xl., 110.


together, or at any rate fraternize when they meet in any
part of their common territory. There are certain spots
scattered up and down at short intervals in this territory
which are traditionally haunted, some by one animal or
object and some by another, from which the children
receive their totemic names instead of from the mother.
It appears then that, like the Kamilaroi, the totems are
dispersed throughout the tribal hunting grounds, but are
allotted to the offspring according to the locality of con-
ception instead of parentage.
In the greater part of New South Wales descent of the
totems is counted through the mother. A totemic clan or
group possesses a more or less extensive tract of country
which all the members of the clan occupy as their common
birthright. The hunting grounds of every Australian tribe,
and consequently of all the partitions and repartitions of
the tribe, descend from the fathers to the sons for ever.
The children of every marriage belong to the father’s tribe,
no matter whether the totems descend through the mothers
or the fathers, or are acquired by the accident of con-
ception. Among the Ohingalee, Arranda, Wombaia, and
other tribes there are similar tracts of country occupied
by totemic clans or groups, but instead of taking the totem
from the mother, this matter as already stated is deter-
mined by locality. In other words, the totems, instead of
being inherited from living subjects scattered over their
hunting grounds, are obtained from certain hills, trees,
rocks, etc,, similarly scattered at random throughout the
ancestral territory.
Again, in all Australian tribes, whether the descent of
the children is maternal or paternal, or acquired by acci-
dent, the privilege of working incantations, making rain,
performing initiatory ceremonies and other important func-
tions, descends from the men of the tribe to the sons. This


law is the same in the Kamilaroi, Wiradjuri, Ohingalee,
Arranda, and other tribes, and is no evidence of paternal
descent. Moreover, all the ceremonies in connection with
the totems are likewise handed down through the men,
quite irrespective of how the totems descend. In sum-
marizing the social laws of the aborigines, whether in the
Northern Territory, New South Wales, or in the other
States, we discover that although they vary in all sorts of
details yet they agree in the main lines of their organisation.
In 19041 contributed an article to this Society containing
a brief account of the sociology of the Ngeumba tribe, in
which I reported the existence of certain castes, which I
provisionally named Blood and Shade divisions. 1 In order
to obtain the bearing of these castes on the social organi-
sation it was necessary to prepare the pedigrees of several
families to illustrate the laws of intermarriage among them,
as well as the descent of the castes to the progeny. I did
not at the time publish these genealogies because I had
quite sufficient information to satisfy myself, and thought
it unnecessary to do any more. Since the publication of
my article and its circulation amongst the anthropologists
of England, some of them have asked me to publish some
of these genealogies so that the people of England and
elsewhere may have a chance of forming their own con-
clusions from my observed facts. lam therefore now
submitting one of the genealogies tor publication.
Before proceeding with the annexed table the reader is
invited to peruse my former article which describes the
division of the Ngeumba tribe into cycles, sections, and
totemic families, with explanatory examples. Besides the
divisions just mentioned and quite independently of them,
there is another bisection of the community into Guaigulir
or active blood, and Guaimundhun or sluggish blood. There
1 This Journal, xxxvm., 209, seq.


is still another partition of the community into Nhurrai,
the shade cast by the butt or lower portion of a tree and
Winggu, the shade thrown by the higher branches. The
Shades are apparently an extension of the Blood divisions,
and regulate the camping of the people under umbrageous
trees, A Guaigulir is always a Winggu and a Guaimun-
dhun is always a Nhurrai.
The castes of Blood and Shade are not necessarily coin-
cident with the other divisions. For example, each cycle,
every section and every totemic group contains people
belonging to the Guaigulir and Guaimundhun Bloods with
their corresponding Shades. Then as regards the descent,
a Guaigulir mother has a Guaigulir family of the Winggu
Shade, and a Guaimundhun mother’s children inherit her
Blood and Shade nomenclature; just in the same way that
the children of a woman of the Bandicoot totem are
Bandicoots like herself.
I shall now tabulate the pedigrees of ten couples or
twenty married persons belonging to the southern portion
of the Ngeumba territory.' Every one of these individuals
was examined by myself and I am supplying the names of
my native informants.
Examining the following table, we find the person we are
dealing with whom we have called the “Individual,” in the
central column. No. 1, Jack Onze, of the section Ippai,
and a Guaigulir. No. la, Nellie his wife, a Matha and a
Guaimundhun, contracted to G’dhun to make it fit into the
narrow column. I have not encumbered the table with
Shades, because in every instance yet met with a Guaigulir
is a Winggu and a Guaimundhun a Nhurrai. In the next
column to the right of Jack and Nellie is their child, a
Kubbi, who has the same Blood and Shade as his mother
Nellie. On the left of No. 1 is Jack Onze’s mother, an
Ippatha and of the same blood as himself. In the extreme

left hand column is Jack Onze’s father, a Guaimundhun.
All the other married pairs can be followed out at sight in
the same manner.
It will be seen by Table Y that although most of the
marriages are normal or mixed Blood, as Guaigulir to
Guaimundhun, there are some which are irregular or the
same Blood, as Guaigulir to Guaigulir. We also notice
examples of the wellknown variations in the intermarriages
of the sections, such as in one case Murri marries Ippatha,
in another Butha, and in another Matha. Other examples
show that Kubbi espouses Butha or Matha, or Ippatha or
Kubbitha. The examples likewise disclose the fact that
members of the Guaigulir and Guaimundhun Bloods, with
their corresponding Shades, are found indiscriminately in
all the four sections and consequently in both the cycles,
I have not supplied the totems of the parties in the table
because their succession is invariably through the mother.
None of the old blacks could give me any reason for the
blood and shade castes any more than they can assign a
reason for the divisions into cycles or sections, or for the
origin of the totems. The natives say that all Guaigulir
folk are friendly among themselves and the Guaimundhun
people have the same mutual bond of friendship, much in
the way that totem kins acknowledge a common tie. The
Ippai and Kumbo people of both sexes belong to the Ngur-
rawun cycle, whilst the Murri and Kubbi folk belong to the
Mumbun division. 1
If we take a given number of natives, say thirty for
example, and classify them according to their cycles into
separate lots of Ngurrawun and Mumbun, then each lot
will contain people of the Guaigulir and Guaimundhun
bloods. Or, if we arrange the thirty men according to
1 This Journal, xxxvm., 207.


their bloods into two lots of Guaigulir and Guaimundhun,
then each lot will contain representatives of the Ngurrawun
and Mumbun cycles. Not only are the cycles and bloods
inextricably mixed up, but there is no exogamy in either
of these systems of division.
The facts set forth in the foregoing pages incidentally
raise the question whether exogamy has a place in the
social structure of the Australian aborigines. It is impos-
sible to bisect a tribe in such a way that the two parts
shall be quite -independent, so that the men of one part or
cycle shall marry the women of the other cycle, and such
women only. In dealing with the tribes in the Northern
Territory a few pages back we classified the community
into two cycles, because there are two sets of women,
each set comprising four sections, with perpetual succession
in a certain rotation.
The daughters belong to the same cycle as their mothers
and become the wives of the men of their father’s cycle.
The brothers of these girls, who also belong to their
mother’s cycle, in like manner become the husbands of the
women of their father’s cycle. These rules however, only
hold good for what we have distinguished as No. land No.
II wives. When we come to No. 11l and No. IV wives or
husbands, they are taken from the other cycle (see p. 71,
ante). Hence our Table 111 is not an example of exogamy.
When Spencer and Gillen reported the divisions of the
Chingalee in 1901,' four years after the publication of my
Table 111, they came to the conclusion that descent was
counted through the men, and prepared a table to the
following effect. lam using my own spelling of the section
names for the sake of uniformity.

In the above table each of my cycles of women (see the
“wife” column of Table III) is bisected, and the men of a
cycle are similarly divided. We will now deal with Phratry
Aas it appears in Table VI. Taking the first man in the
“Husband” column, Chimitcha, we see that his son is
Taralee, who belongs to the same phratry as his father.
Taralee marries Chemara, a woman of his mother’s phratry.
This classification is diametrically opposite to my report.
But when we look for Chimitcha’s No. 11l wife Ohuna and
his No, IV spouse Chimitcha, they are found in Phratry B.
Then Table VI does not exhibit an exogamous division any
more than Table 111 does. I cannot understand why Spencer
and Gillen bisect the cycle or series of women, Chungalee,
Olmla, Taralee and Tungaree, given as A in the “Wife ”
column of Table 111, and also the corresponding series shown
as B in that table, because nothing seems to be gained by
it. It neither establishes exogamy nor proves descent of
the sections through the fathers.
Looking at Table VI it is seen that if Chimitcha marries
Chungalee his children will be Taralee ; if he takes a Chula
wife they will be Tungaree; if he be allotted a Chuna they
will be Chemara; and if he weds a Chimitcha his family
will be Champina. The devolution of the sections must
consequently depend upon the mothers only. Moreover,


two of Ohimitcha’s possible wives and two of his possible
families belong to one phratry and two of his possible wives
and families to the other phratry. There cannot therefore
be any partition of the community into two exogamous
moieties.
Another point of interest in the sociology of the Chingalee
tribe, which lias escaped the notice of other investigators,
consists of the fact that there are two sets of names for
the sections —one set being used from birth to puberty and
another set which is adopted from puberty onward through
life. The first.may be distinguished as the “temporary”
and the second as the “final” nomenclature. That is, the
section name of every male and every female who has
passed through the ceremonies connected with the attain-
ment of puberty is amended or changed altogether.
Looking at Table 111 of this article, a few examples will
be given. The “final” section name Chimitcha is known
as Chukaday from birth to puberty; ChampachinaasTam-
palilly; Chungalee as Chukala; Taralee is known as Tapala,
and so on for the rest.
I have also discovered two sets of names among the
Inchalanchee tribe in the north-west district of Queensland.
Referring to the table published in this Journal in 1898,
Yol. xxxii., pp. 251 -252, the following are a few of the
“temporary” forms of the section names given in that
table. From birth to puberty Narachee is used instead
of Burralanjee; Boonongoona instead of Kommeranjee ;
Warkee instead of Narrabalanjee; Thimmermill is the
temporary form of Yakamurri, etc. In Western Australia
there are similar double forms of the section names.
For the purpose of showing that the descent of the totems
does not follow the father in the Chingalee, Warramonga,
Binbingha and adjacent tribes, 1 have tabulated a list of
Chingalee natives with whom my correspondents are

personally acquainted, and have given their English names
by which they are known to the European residents of the
district.
Entering the above table we find No. 1, Charlie, whose
totem is the black-striped snake. To the left of No. lis
his mother of the fish totem; and still further to the left
is his father, a black-striped snake the same as Charlie.
No. 2 also takes his father’s totem. Nos. 3 and 4 have the
totem of their mother. Nos. 5 and Gdo not follow either
parent. Nos. 7 and 8 have the totems of both parents.
This table therefore demonstrates that the totems do not
uniformly follow' the fatiier.
Spencer and Gillen state that “in the Warrainunga,
Ohingalee, etc., the totems are divided between the two
moieties, with the result that a man must marry a woman
of some other totem than his own.” 1 Some of my most
capable correspondents who have resided a number of years
in the region occupied by tiie various branches of the
Ohingalee tribe, have supplied me with comprehensive lists
of the totems for three generations. Examination of these
lists shows that the black-striped snake and the sleepy
lizard are claimed by individuals in the Tungaree, Ohuna
and Oharnpina sections. The wallaby appears in the Ohuna,
Tungaree, Champina and Chungalee sections. Honey bee

is found in the Chula, Chuna and Ohemara sections. The
iguana is a totem in the Taralee, Chula, Champina, Chuna
and Tungaree sections.
If we compare these examples with my bisection of the
Chingalee tribe, Table 111, or witli Spencer and Gillen’s
bisection, Table VI, we discover that the totems are
scattered up and down in both' moieties. Moreover, if
we look again at Table VII we observe that the father and
the mother of No. 5 both have the same species of animal
for their totem. The father and mother of No. 8 are like-
wise both of the same totem. It is erroneous therefore, to
state that the totems are divided into two groups or cycles;
and the assertion that a man never marries a woman of his
own totem is equally in error.
Spencer and Gillen in dealing with the Warramunga,
Chingalee and Biubingha tribes, have reported that the
descent of the phratries (cycles) as well as of the sections
is determined through the men; that the descent of the
totems is almost without exception in the paternal line;
and that the totems are markedly divided into two groups. 1
It is hoped that the facts which I have set forth in the
preceding pages have made the following facts sufficiently
conspicuous: (1)-That the sections devolve through the
mother only. (2) That the cycles (or phratries) also have
descent through the women. (3) That the descent of the
totems is not in the paternal line, but follows the same
rules which I formerly explained in regard to the Chauan
tribe." (4) That the totems are not divided into two groups
but are to be found in both parts of every possible bisection
of a tribe. (5) And that a man can occasionally marry a
a woman of his own totem.

In the foregoing pages we have been dealing witli tribes
containing eight sections in their organisation, and it is
thought that a brief review of a tribe comprising only four
sections may further enable the student of Australian
ethnology to more readily grasp the subject. The follow-
ing table exhibits the constitution of the Kamilaroi,
Ngeumba and kindred tribes. The feminine forms of the
section names are omitted.
In this table the women of the tribe are classified into
two cycles which reproduce themselves for ever, just the
same as in the Oliingalee, Binbingha, Warramonga and
other tribes, except that there are only two sections in a
cycle instead of four. It is unnecessary to explain how the
cycles, and the sections have descent through the women
and that there is an absence of absolute exogamy, because
all -this has been abundantly illustrated by me in other
publications. 1
But if we bisect the cycles of women the same as
Spencer and Gillen have bisected the cycles of the women
in the Ohiugalee, etc., we get the following table:
In this rearrangement of the sections in the table,
have taken half the women in Cycle A, Table VIII, namely
1 This Journal, xxxix,, 116, 117 ; American Antiquarian, xxvm., 86.


Kumbo, and half the women of Cycle B, namely Kubbi,
and with them have constructed Cycle A of Table IX.
Taking the first man in the column,Mufri, we
see that his son is Ippai, who belongs to the same cycle as
his father. Ippai marries Kubbi, a woman of his mother’s
cycle, A. And when we look for Murri’s No. 11l and No.
IV wives they are found in Cycle B.
Further study of Table IX would reveal to us the
remorseless fact that quite regardless of the cycle or the
section from which Murri gets his wife, the descent of the
cycle and the section of his offspring is determined by their
mother. It is also manifest that notwithstanding our
repeated attempts to divide a tribe into two such parts,
that the men of one part shall marry the women of the
other part, and such women only, the conclusion forces
itself upon ns that there is no absolute law of exogamy
which answers the conditions.
