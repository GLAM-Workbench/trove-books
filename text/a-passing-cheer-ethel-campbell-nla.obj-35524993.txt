THANKS IN VERSE
“Girl in the Sailor Suit”
Appreciates Diggers’ Gift
“The Girl in the Sailor Suit," other-
wise Miss Ethel Campbell, of Durban,
South Africa is a pleasant recollection
to many a Digger. She met every
vessel carrying Australian soldiers
which touched at that port, personally
welcomed the men, and worked un-
ceasingly for their comfort and enter-
tainment.
In affectionate remembrance of her
generous treatment, the soldiers who
returned by the Boonah sent her some
time ago a beautiful writing desk of
Australian wood.
Under the date of July 25 Miss
Campbell has written to Captain Llew-
ellyn Griffiths-through whom the gift
had been fdWVarded, expressing her
surprise and her thanks. The com-
munication, which is to “Dear Aussie
Soldiers,” is in verse, and in the course
of it she says:—
I give up wondering at the Aussles’ ways.
I’ve been at It for years and months and
days.
The way they appreciate the slightest thing
Has got me beat and right outside the ring.
So I accept the desk and leave the grind
Of trying to fathom the strange Aussie
mind. . . .

And could we wish you safe at home.
When England’s call went forth,
And the flower of Britain’s manhood rose
In East, West, South, and North?
’Tis such as you have raised her up,
An Empire strong and free,
’Tis such as you have kept her long
The mistress of the sea.
’Tis such as you will keep her still
Unfettered by the foe,
And lead her on to victory
Where’er her legions go.
Your hero-fathers died to give
—„This mighty Empire birth,
They set her boundaries far and wide,
Nigh conquering half the earth !
Their hero-sons will die again
To pay ‘the glorious toll,
To keep the Red Route open still,
To keep the Empire whole.
Then could we wish you better, lads,
To-day than see you go,
With England in her hour of need?—
A thousand times, lads—No!

ANZACS.
What mean these great white ships at sea, ploughing their Eastward tack,
Bearing their precious human freight, bringing the spent men back?
They mean that Australia has been there, they mean she has played the game,
And her wonderful sons have won their share of everlasting fame.
Battered, and worn, and war scarred —those who had left their land
Strong in their glowing manhood, by England to take their stand;
Those who had sailed, when the war cloud burst, out on a distant foam
To the tune of “Australia will be there” —thus are they coming home'.
What mean these absent numbers, the gaps in the stricken line?
you will find the graves which tell you, on the trail by Lonesome Pine:
On the slopes of Aki Baba, on Koja Chemen’s brow,
They died the death of heroes, as Australia’s sons know how.
Eager for battle they leapt ashore at the cove where their name was won,
They stormed the cliffs of Sari Bair, where the death trap gullies run;
In the lead-rent scrub by Krithia, on the banks of the Kereves Dere,
High on the shell-swept ridges —Australia has been there!
•
There is silence on the beaches now, the battle-din has fled
From the gullies, cliffs, and ridges where they charged up, fought and bled.
There’s a little cove that’s sacred —north of Gaba Tepe Hill —
To the glory of the men who died, and a name that never will!
And now on the fields of Flanders, ’tis eternised once more:
At Pozieres, Armentieres, Messines, Bapaume, and Bullecourt,
At Polygon Wood, and Broodseinde, by the frozen Somme and Aisne,
In the snow-clad front-line trenches —Australia is there again.
There are great white vessels sailing, and they bear the joy and pain,
And the glory of Australia’s sons who have not bled in vain;
Tho’ crippled, helpless, maimed for life, tho’ more than death their loss,
There is more than life in the glory of the burden of their cross.
Greater than jewel-decked Emperor, greater than ermined King,
Clad in their faded suits of blue, the men that the white ships bring;
What tho’ their crown a bandage, stretcher or cot their throne,
Splints or a crutch their sceptre —the Anzac name is their own!

AUSTRALIANS.
(1916).
Written after hearing a wealthy mer-
chant speak disparagingly of Australians
“We are not cotton-spinners all, but some
love England and her honour yet.”
We stand on the shore of Durban,
And watch the transports go
To England from Australia,
Hurrying to and fro.
Bearing the men of a Nation—
Who are heroes to the core—
To stand or fall by the Motherland,
And they’re sending thousands more!
We’ve watched the ships returning
With the cripple and the maim,
With limbs that trail and falter—
Theirs an immortal name!
The deathless name of “Anzac,”
That thrills from Pole to Pole,
The remnants of the heroes
On the long and glorious Roll.
And now in their tens of hundreds
Come the men to fill their ranks,
And what can we do to show them
Our love, our pride, our thanks?
We can’t do much, I own it.
But give them a passing cheer—
While the real elite heat a shocked
retreat—
Why, they saw one drinking beer!
O God, could we show these misers
The path that the Anzacs went!
Could they rest in their beds at night-
time ?
Or live in their damned content?
Could they talk with a sneer of
Australians
When one or two get drunk?
I’d rather a drunk Australian
Than a wealthy Durban funk!
He’s a better man than you are,
You dear teetotal saint!
You do not drink—you will not fight!
What wonderful restraint!
We stand on the shore of Durban,
For we are not all like you,
And the glorious name of “Anzac”
Thrills us thro’ and thro’!
But all we can do is to cheer them,
And throw them an orange from the
shored
We’re not millionaires (like some are),
Or perhaps we would try to do more.
They’re coming in tens or thousands,
And here’s to their honour to-day—
Here’s to the Sister Dominion
Who is showing us the way!

SONG OF H.M.A.S. “SYDNEY.”
Three long black lines of troopships
From Albany they steer,
The “Melbourne” proudly at the head,
The “Sydney” in the rear—
The answer to old England’s call,
The flower of her Southern sons—
When hark I there comes a call for help
Tho’ blurred by the Pirate Huns.
The “Melbourne” was the flagship,
And dare not leave her place,
So off the “Sydney” streaked full speed,
Nigh thirty knots her pace;
They guessed ’twould be the “Emden,”
And o’er the foam they sped
To catch the raider at her work,
Now sixty miles ahead.
The stokers worked like demons,
And soon the Germans saw
Smoke plume, and mighty bow wave.
Von Muller dropped his jaw;
Then he laughed, “If that’s a cruiser
On the skyline which I see.
It won’t remain one very long,
For ’twill be sunk by me!”
Chorus:—
But then he had to reckon with Australia,
He didn’t know the dinkum Aussie Jacks,
But he met them by the Cocos,
And he got some broken bokos,
And that’s what comes of boasting near
Australia I
And now the “Sydney” checked her speed,
And onward came foe,
The lads stood calm beside their guns
With hearts and eyes aglow;
The youngest Navy in the world
Was out to win her spurs,
And men would fight, and men would die,
And glory would be hers!
And there they fought a valiant fight,
And there they stoushed the Hun;
They plugged the pirate raider till
She hadn’t an answering gun;
And when the proud Von Muller
Had skied the flag of white,


Brave Glossop shook him by the hand,
For ’twas a good straight fight.
He made him a guest of honour,
And gave him back his sword:
Then they took the captives with them.
Tending their wounds on board,
And back to join the convoy,
The “Sydney” steamed away.
On Southern Seas the pirate Hun
Had seen his long last day.
Chorus;—
Because he had to reckon with Australia,
He didn’t know the dinkum Aussie Tars,
But he met them on the ocean,
And now he has a notion
What happens when he raids too near Australia
In fair Colombo harbour,
That wonderful array
Of forty great black transports
Swarming with soldiers lay;
Waiting to greet the conqueror,
With pent emotion thrilled,
The ships hung gay with bunting
But never a whistle shrilled.
Thro’ lines of towering troopships.
The little “Sydney” steered,
Beneath those stalwart khaki throngs,
And never a soldier peered!
With hat in hand, and silent,
They watched her steaming by,
In young Australia’s crowning hour:
The ’wildered Huns gasped, “Why?”
As there were wounded prisoners
Aboard—they came to learn—
No noisy demonstration
Must mark the ships return.
“You have been kind, but this crowns all,”
Von Muller tried to speak,
“We cannot hope to thank you”—
The tears streamed down his cheek.
Chorus:—
But then he had to reckon with Australia,
He didn’t know the dinkum “Ginger Micks,”
But now he’s “getting wise,”
And the tears that filled his eyes
Are not the least of tributes to Australia!

Sonnet to the Rising Sun.
(Written at dawn on the North with Australians
nearing from the East.)
Steams, silhouetted ’gainst the rising sun,
A great black transport out of steep beyond,
Upward she steers till the horizon fond,-
Which held her from my sight so long, is won,
Apollo floods her course with shimmering light,
As though the brave new army sailing west —
With his own emblem as its chosen crest —
Was his especial charge to cherish bright.
Avaunt, vain monarch ! cease this toil and strain
To lend that badge reflection from on high,
Though clouds o’erhang, tho’ you have left the sky,
Though darkest Midnight at her blackest reign—
It’s glory pales your wildest dream of light,
Because Australia bears it in the fight! .

ipig
(Oiigiualiy written for CariuichaeTs Thousand.)
Here’s luck, brave Reinforcements!
Australians true and bold,
You’ll give the Hun the “dinkum oil”
The Anzacs gave of old;
You’ll add new bays of glory
To Australia’s peerless name,
For new recruits are on the tide
And off to play the game.
In your ranks are men of Anzac
Who have stouched the Hun before,
And those now passed the doctor
Who’ve been turned-down times galore,
What matter if they’re fit or not?
They’re of the Anzac breed,
Their spirit makes them mighty,
And they’re “there” in England’s need!
1 hey’re “there” to take the places
Of the strong men gone before,
1 hey’re “there” the boys of seventeen
Who gave their age as more,
And grey-haired men of fifty
Who put their ages back—
For nothing stops an Aussie
When he wants to do his whack.
And if he tells a lie or two
Because he wants to go,
D’you think Saint Peter will go crook
And “count him out,” lads? No!
He’ll reckon that square-dinkum lie
Is worth the truth in tons,
For it takes another hero “there”
To back old England’s guns.
Bravo ! brave Reinforcements !
And may you soon pass through
On your return —via Durban.
Good luck to all of you !
And when you join your unit
Gi\;e my love to every one
Of the lads you see in Flanders,
Who wear the Rising Sun.

Gorblimey.
“The war has not killed the ‘knut’; it
has transformed him. Senior officers
call him ‘Gorblimey.’ The origin of this
phrase is found in the lines of an obscure
song: ‘My ole man’s a fireman, wot d’er
fink of that? ’E wears gorblimey trousis,
an’ a’ little gorblimey ’at.’ The gorblimey
’at is the sign of the regenerated knut,”
says a senior officer to the “Daily
Sketch,” “you know the kind, soft and
puffy round the edges, the very counter-
part of the caps the ‘knut’ used to wear
in his mufti days. These soft hats are
worn at the front, because the wire rim
of the old military caps deflected bullets;
this gives the ‘knut’ his excpse for wear-
ing them in town, and some of the old-
fashioned army officers tick him off
rather badly. But in peace time let the
‘knut’ have been what he may; in war
time he is just a brave merrj 7 lad, serv-
ing his country for the love of her, in a
gorblimey ’at.”


He’s wearing a little gorbluney ’at,
Our “knut” of a year ago—
In a khaki suit there’s a new recruit
Gone out to face the foe—
What tho’ he once wore flaming ties,
And socks with clocks of enormous size,
He’s helping to wipe the German’s eyes,
Gorblimoy!
Was lie a swank, or a waster then?
Or was he known as a fop ?
The “knock-ajbout-town,” with his gloves
of brown,
The “knut” with the gold cane-top.
He wasn’t a “shirker,” despite his kit,
He has proved his pluck, he has proved
his grit,
He’s serving old England—he’s doing his
bit,
Gorblimey!
He’s giving his life for a mighty cause,
In a little gorblimey ’at,
And the socks are gone that the clocks
were on,
But his feet aren’t “cold” for that.
Did we speak with scorn of the way he
dressed ?
Ah! we did not know that the gaudy
vest
Covered the heart in a hero’s breast!
Gorblimey!
There’s a lonely grave by a broken road
“Somewhere in France,” to show
That game to the last, from the fight he
passed,
Our “knut” of a year ago.
Did we look at him coldly in bygone
years?
We hail him to-day with a nation’s
cheers!
An Empire’s gratitude, and tears!
Gorblimey I

To THE MARCH TO FREEDOM MEN.
March to Freedom men! Australians,
Here’s to you upon the way!
Off to reinforce the Anzacs
Battling still against “'Ihe Day.
From the Land of Golden Wattle,
Hark, the shibboleth rings out
Clear and true —“Advance Australia!”
And they follow up the shout!
Follow up, from farm and city,
Leaving all, their homes, their wives;
Not by force, but gladly offered
To the Empire are their lives.
Men from mine, from plough, from counter.
Men with riches, men with none,
Join alike to shield the Empire
From the cruel, savage Hun.
Never does their purpose alter,
Nor their splendid vigour sag
(There no rich young wowser merchant
Hides behind his money bag.
“Profiteering’-’ ’s not the war-cry
Of Australia’s “upper ten,”
For they scorn not patriotism,
And they also send their men).
March to Freedom, march to Glory,
West, nor’-westward on they hie.
Till the Southern Cross starred banner
Floats beneath a cold grey sky,
Till the trenches ring with “Coo-ees,”
As out o’er the top they bound,
On with glorious deeds of valour
Till the hour when victory’s crowned.
When the goal of Freedom’s sighted
In the dawn of Liberty,
When they’re forcing Fritz to goose-step
Back across the Rhine and Spree,
When the cause of Right has triumphed,
There Australia will be in,
On the glorious day of reckoning,
When the Allies take Berlin!

TO THE FURLOUGH MEN A.I.F.
What paean for the Furlough Men
More dowered than “They were at the Landing!’’
’Twere meet no song from my poor pen,
Those words a greater epic standing:
Those words —with proud remembrance fraught,
More precious than gold’s vaunted power,
More hallowed for a nation’s tears —
Recall Australia’s crowning hour,
When they were at the Landing !
I
And when long years have passed, and aged
The heroes on her glowing roll,
Will honours won through worldly pomp
Have power to stir her people’s soul?
No! —still the vision of these men,
Tho’ bowed with age, and slow of gait,
Will spur their children on to prove
Still worthy of Australia’s great,
Still worthy of the Landing!

ANSWER TO AN AUSTRALIAN.
And know I not Australia? —as you say,
I never passed that way, so how should I?
Lad! 1 have seen in your young dauntless eye
The soul of your Australia far away;
And I have seen her giant mountain crag
Reflected in her mighty steadfast men.
What! did you think to keep her secret, then,
For those who roam her hills and share her flag?
Vain thought! her open-hearted men and free
(Uncurbed by sordid tyranny of class),
Give up the secret as their troopships pass,
And knowing them, I know what she must be.
And know I not Australia? Lad, I know!
She keeps no secret where her thousands go.
Tho’ 1 have never seen her blue-gum trees,
I know the men she reared beneath their shade,
1 know her fame resplendent they have made,
And knowing them, I know that all of these
Her stalwart sons —whose weal she holds so dear —
Stand true as her great forest trees aloft,
With hearts of jarrah-oak —yet wond’rous soft,
Perchance because the wattle bloom grew near.
I have not seen where bushmen pitched their tent,
But well I know their brave, unconquered mien,
And I can picture where their tent has been,
Sons of the Empire-builders, Britain-lent.
Then know I not Australia? Yea, and more,
Because I know the glorious men she bore !

“DIGGERS’ MOTHER”
EXPRESSES THANHS
Miss Ethel Campbell in Verse Re-
plies to the Soldiers Who
Sent Her a Writing Desk
I _ Miss Ethel Campbell, of Durban,
daughter of the highly popular doctor of
that port, has endeared herself to tens
of thousands of Australian soldiers who
have passed that way. It was largely
owing to her indefatigable and most un-
selfish labors that Durban came to fame
and honor as the place that gave the
Diggers the best time they had on earth.
Miss Campbell met every ship and saw
| every ship away. She kept the men
supplied with flowers and fruit and news-
papers and invitations, and whatever else
she had time to think of. She became
known as “The Diggers’ Mother.” A
few months ago men who returned in
the Boonah joined with others and sent
Miss Campbell a writing desk made of
beautiful Australian woods. Her ac-
knowledgment of the gift came to Major
Griffiths yesterday. And so Miss Camp-
bell makes another appeal to the Aus-
tralian heart —she writes verses. Here
is her letter:
DURBAN (Natal), 25/7/1919.
To the Australian Soldiers of H.M.A.T.
Boonah (who sent me the beautiful
writing desk), c/o Major Llewellyn
Griffiths (late 17tu Battalion, A.1.F.),
Imperial Service Club, Sydney.
Dear Aussie Soldiers,—
How am I to say
A “thank you” meet unto you all to-day ?
Though I would rather have no gifts
from those
Whom I can never thank in verse or
prose
For what they’ve done already. Soldier
men !
Too hard a task you put upon my pen.
I could not fight like you ; all I could do
A worthless bit to show I’m British, too;
And when I’m sad that little I can stake
To help the Empire, or for Britain’s
sake.
Or show fit gratitude in war’s dark
hours,
“To you, great men, who fought and
kept it ours.”
Then just imagine how I feel to see
This splendid present you have sent to
me.
I give up wondering at the Aussie’s
ways,
I’ve been at it for years, and months,
and days
Way they appreciate the slightest thing.
Has got me beat, and right outside the
ring ;
So I accept the desk, and leave the grind
Of trying to fathom the strange Aussie
mind.
I signal from the pier a stray “Hullo !”
And gratitude no end the Aussies show.
And think it’s “war work,” which is just
plain rot.
For others quite agiee that ft is not.
So do you wonder I feel rather queer
To get such gifts from those mad Aus-
sies dear ?
I love the desk, for those who gave it
me,
The great, brave men who came across
the sea.
Nor needed I this trophy as we part,
To keep the Aussie ever in my heart.
He’s there already ; nor can I forget
Until the end of Time —and then not yet.
Fond thanks—l’ll prize your gift for
evermore.
That it was sent from you its greatest
store ;
I’m writing at it now, and it’s just fine.
With silver boomerang, and graceful
line.
I love it, for ’tis beautiful to see ;
I love it, for its use is great to me ;
I love it, for of bygone days it tells.
And one thing more, I love it—for it
smells !
’Tis made of dinkum-grown Australian
wood,
I’ve smelt Australia now, and it smells
good.
I’ll treasure it and prize it all my life.
With memories, dear memories, ’tis rife.
Again I thank you—ere I cease this
ramble
From <
Your sincere friend ever,
ETHEL CAMPBELL.

WHAT WE ALL SAY.
Miss Campbell has welcomed every Australian
Transport to and from Durban.
Ihe following lines are in reply to her Poem,
"Australian,”
There s a name that all Australians,
Will cherish for many a day,
Someone who s been a Pal to us,
And stood in the critic’s way.
She welcomed us in with Semaphore
And gladdened the hearts of all.
When the Lads expected a right turn down,
As their share in another’s brawl.
She knows that “ to err is human,’
And concedes to “forgive is divine,”
Sentiments so rarely practised,
Towards!those “fighting shrapnel and mine.”
But those are the lines she’s championed,
Miss Campbell, we all knew in white.
And so we will ever remember,
When she “ Morsed ” as we went out of sight.
Keep up the Glories of Anzacs !”
Why it just makes us thrill again,
We ll do it by God, or we'll die first ;
Nothing must blemish the name.
She’ s given us something to try for.
And when we have Peace once more,
Those who come back must tell her,
Of the Part She played in the war.

DR. S. G. CAMPBELL.
DIES IN SOUTH AFRICA.
FATHER OF THE ANGEL OP
Dr. Samuel George Campbell, who with his
daughter, Mias Ethel Campbell, devoted him-
self untiringly during the war to the in-
terests of Invalided and visiting soldiers,
including many thousands of Australians, died
at Durban on March 12.
Self interest was his last consideration, and
it was devotion to duty, not only as a
physician, but as a servant of the public,
that hastened his death, which occurred at
his residence In Musgrave-road. Durban. Dr.
Campbell, who was born in 1860, was the son
of a pioneer. His father was William Camp-
bell who went to Natal in 1850, and founded
the Muckleneuk Estate, near Verulam, in the
Victoria County, where Dr. Campbell was
born.
Dr. Campbell’s services in the war received
recognition in 1924. when he was appointed a
Companion of the Order'of St. Michael and St.
George. Miss Ethel Campbell was named by
members of the A.I.F, , the “angel of
Durban.”


ANZACS.
What mean these great white ships at sea, ploughing their Eastward tack,
Bearing their precious human freight, bringing the spent men back?
They mean that Australia has been there, they mean she has played the game,
And her wonderful sons have won their share of everlasting fame.
Battered, and worn, and war scarred —those who had left their land
Strong in their glowing manhood, by England to take their stand;
Those who had sailed, when the war cloud burst, out on a distant foam
To the tune of “Australia will be there”—thus are they coming home'.
What mean these absent numbers, the gaps in the stricken line?
You will find the graves which tell you, on the trail by Lonesome Pine.
On the slopes of Aki Baba, on Koja Chemen’s brow,
They died the death of heroes, as Australia’s sons know how.
Eager for battle they leapt ashore at the cove where their name was won,
They stormed the cliffs of Sari Bair, where the death trap gullies run;
In the lead-rent scrub by Krithia, on the banks of the Kereves Dere,
High on the shell-swept ridges—Australia has been there!
There is silence on the beaches now, the battle-din has fled
From the gullies, cliffs, and ridges where they charged up, fought and bled.
There’s a little cove that’s sacrecf —north of Gaba Tepe Hill—
To the glory of the men who died, and a name that never will.
And now on the fields of Flanders, ’tis eternised once more:
At Pozieres, Armentieres, Messines, Bapaume, and Bullecourt,
At Polygon Wood, and Broodseinde, by the frozen Somme and Aisne,
In the snow-clad front-line trenches —Australia is there again.
There are great white vessels sailing, and they bear the joy and pain,
And the glory of Australia’s sons who have not bled in vain;
Tho’ crippled, helpless, maimed for life, tho’ more than death their loss,
There is more than life in the glory of the burden of their cross.
Greater than jewel-decked Emperor, greater than ermined King,
Clad in their faded suits of blue, the men that the white ships bring,
What tho’ their crown a bandage, stretcher or cot their throne,
Splints or a crutch their sceptre—the Anzac name is their own!

SONG OF H.M.A.S. “SYDNEY.”
Three long black lines of troopships
From Albany they steer,
The “Melbourne” proudly at the head,
The “Sydney” in the rear—
The answer to old England’s call,
The flower of her Southern sons—
When hark! there comes a call for help
Tho’ blurred by the Pirate Huns.
The “Melbourne” was the flagship,
And dare not leave her place,
So off the “Sydney” streaked full speed,
Nigh thirty knots her pace;
They guessed ’twould be the “Eraden,”
And o’er the foam they sped
To catch the raider at her work,
Now sixty miles ahead.
The stokers worked like demons,
And soon the Germans saw
Smoke plume, and mighty bow wave,
Von Muller dropped his jaw;
Then he laugbed, “If that’s a cruiser
On the skyline which I see,
It won’t remain one very long,
For ’twill be sunk by me!”
Chorus:—
But then he had to reckon with Australia,
He didn’t know the dinkum Aussie Jacks,
But he met them by the Cocos,
And he got some broken bokos,
And that’s what comes of boasting near
Australia 1
And now the “Sydney” checked her speed,
And onward came the foe,
The lads stood calm beside their guns
With hearts and eyes aglow;
The youngest Navy in the world
Was out to win her spurs,
And men would fight, and men would die,
And glory would be hers!
And there they fought a valiant fight,
And there they stoushed the Hun;
They plugged the pirate raider till
She hadn’t an answering gun;
And when the proud Von Muller
Had skied the flag of white.
Brave Glossop shook him by the hand,
For ’twas a good straight fight.
He made him a guest of honour,
And gave him back his sword:
Then they took the captives with them,
Tending their wounds on board.
And back to join the convoy,
The “Sydney” steamed away.
On Southern Seas the pirate Hun
Had seen his long last day.
Chorus: —
Because he had to reckon with Australia,
He didn’t know the dinkum Aussie Tars,
But he met them on the ocean,
And now he has a notion
What happens when he raids too near Australia!
in fair Colombo harbour,
That wonderful array
Of forty great black transports
Swarming with soldiers lay;
Waiting to greet the conqueror,
With pent emotion thrilled,
The ships hung gay with bunting
But never a whistle'shrilled.
Thro’ lines of towering troopships,
The little “Sydney” steered,
Beneath those stalwart khaki throngs,
And never a soldier ''hsered!
With hat in hand, and silent,
They watched her steaming by,
In young Australia’s crowning hour:
The ’wildered Huns gasped, “Why?”
As there were wounded prisoners
Aboard—they came to learn—
No noisy demonstration
Must mark the ships return.
“You have been kind, but this crowns all,”
Von Muller tried to speak,
“We cannot hope to thank you”—
The tears streamed down his cheek.
Chorus:—
But then he had to reckon with Australia,
He didn’t know the dinkum “Ginger Micks,”
But now he’s “getting wise,”
And the tears that filled his eyes
Are not the least of tributes to Australia!
