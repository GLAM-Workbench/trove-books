PREFACE.
AS no more remarkable crimes than the series
of murders committed at Rainhill, near
Liverpool (Eng.) and at Windsor, Victoria, have
been recorded for many years, the publishers feel
that a succinct narrative of the life and career of
the dastardly perpetrator will be acceptable to
the million. They fully recognise that while the
newspapers of the colonies have excelled themselves’
in their efforts to supply their readers with every
detail connected with these sensational tragedies,
O 7
yet they are aware that much remains to be related
in a continuous and narrative form. Press work
must necessarily be ephemeral, and the publishers
plead this in justification of the present book.

THE CRIMINAL OF THE CENTURY
CHAPTER I.
THE WINDSOR MURDER.
“ Every crime
Has, in the moment of its perpetration,
Its own avenging angel.”
There was nothing remarkable about the villa
which stands in Andrew-street, Windsor, a
populous Melbourne suburb, when a gentleman
calling himself Mr. Drewn took possession of it to-
wards the close of the year 1891. It was only one
of the many ordinary suburban villas which cluster
round a great city, and the new tenant when he signed
* o
bis agreement as lessee expressed himself thoroughl y
satisfied with all the conveniences which his new
home offered. He even waxed confidential, and
informed the landlord that he was a recent arrival
from the old country who, with his sister, had come
to seek fortune in the Sunny South. His personal
appearance indicated that he was a man of sub-
stance, though his manner was unquestionably
tinged with vulgarity. Diamonds glinted on his
fingers, and flashed their effulgence from his shirt-
front. He was prompt in payment, however, and
the landlord was thoroughly satisfied with the new
occupant he had secured for “ No. 57.”

front. He was prompt in payment, however, and
the landlord was thoroughly satisfied with the new
occupant he had secured for “ No. 57.”


Next day several heavy boxes were delivered’,
from a city free-store by a local carrier. Mr.
Drewn and a lady were several times seen about
the place by the neighbours, but all efforts at friend-
liness were repudiated by the newcomers, who were
adjudged by the local quid mines as a strange and
unsociable pair. The man apparently was hasty
tempered and violent. But no open quarrel reached
the ears of those residing in the vicinity. Yet the
reserved and retiring mode of life practised by
Drewn and his alleged sister made them objects
of much gossip for the time being. Before the
neighbours, with all that instinctive curiosity begot
by residence in a jmpulous suburb, could actually
make up their minds as to who and what the new
tenants of “No. 57 ” were, the house was vacated.
So completely had the supposed brother and sister
refrained from any intercourse with the neighbours
that but little heed was taken of their sudden
departure—even if it were observed.
“No. 57” remained untenanted and unvisited
till March 3rd, 1892. On that day a lady, attracted
by the surroundings of the villa, decided to inspect
it with a view to occupancy. She called upon Mr.
Stamford, of High-street, Windsor, the owner, and
with him went over the house. It was a brick
villa, one storey in height, containing seven rooms.
A small garden relieved the front, and a paling fence
divided it from the surrounding dwellings. The
front rooms, which were first visited, were found to>
be entirely satisfactory, but a sickly odor permeated
the whole establishment. This smell induced the
lady to inquire into the drainage of the house..

She was assured by the landlord that the sanitary
arrangements had only recently been overhauled
and placed in most perfect repair. A close search
was then made to trace the source of the offensive-
ness, and it was finally located in one of the back
bedrooms, where it seemed to emanate from beneath
the hearthstone. Mr. Stamford promised to
thoroughly overhaul the premises, and if possible
to remove the cause of the obnoxious exhalations.
With this purpose in view, he communicated with
Mr, Connop, his agent, who, with one of his men,
paid a visit to the house. From room to room
they continued their search with little result until
the back bedroom was reached. Here the effluvium
was almost overpowering, and some moments elapsed
before they were able to pursue their work. To
their astonishment the hearthstone was noticed to
stand several inches above the level of the floor, a
position which could only be due to pressure from
below. This fact, combined with the putrid smell,
suggested in an instant—foul play !
No time was lost in communicating with the
police. Two constables promptly answered the
call, and at once set to work to investigate. They
lifted the hearthstone and found that it had been
laid on a bed of cement, which was gaping, and
emitted a most noisome odor. A spade and pick-
axe were hastily procured, and after the cement
had been slightly broken, the police were horrified
to see protruding a human leg in an advanced stage
of putrefaction. A little more chipping and cutting
and a whole human body was disclosed. The form
was nude. It was of a woman, and though much

■decomposed there was sufficient evidence that in
life she had been youthful and more than ordinarily
prepossessing. The case could only be one of
murder —wilful, foul, and deliberate. The body
was doubled up so as to pack easily in a small
eompass. The arms were pinioned to the sides,
the ankles to the thighs ; and the head was bent
forward and downward. Upon the skull were
murderous wounds, and the throat was cut from ear
to ear. The murderer had done his work skilfully.
Nothing was found in the house but a pound of
butter, a tin of condensed milk, a loaf of bread,
an empty cognac bottle, and a phial containing raw
spirits. All the most observant of the neighbours
could say was that after the stranger first rented
the house boxes arrived, and a lady, well and even
extravagantly dressed, was seen about the place.
Two weeks later the boxes were removed, and the
stranger was seen with his female companion
apparently in the best of spirits, and happy in each
other’s company. A lapse of two months, and then
the body of a woman corresponding with that of
the stranger’s companion was found huddled together
in a shocking manner in a hole 2 feet by 18 inches,
which had been dug under the hearthstone.
Never did it seem more probable that justice would
be defeated and yet another crime added to the
already long roll of undiscovered and unexpiated
offences. But the blood of the woman cried aloud
for vengeance, and it was at hand !

CHAPTER 11.
DETECTIVES ON THE TRAIL.
“ Man’s crimes are his worst enemies, following
Like shadows, ’till they drive his steps into
The pit he dug.”
AT the outset a hopeless task seemed to have
been set the police. Detectives Considiue
and Cawsey, who were placed in charge, were not
men easily daunted or willing to acknowledge them-
selves beaten. True there was very little for them
to go on, but Detective Considine had no further
clue when he commenced his inquiries into the
Ringwood murder some years ago. Yet piece by
piece he wove the net of evidence with such intelli-
gence, skill, and energy that at last he enmeshed
the murderer and brought him to the gallows.
“ Why,” he asked, when people suggested that only
a Vidocq or a Gaboriau could successfully handle such
a case as this, “ should he not do the same now ? ”
He did not pretend to be so distinguished in his
work as the great detectives named, but he would
do his best. Assisted by his companion he decided
upon the course to follow. They must first discover
the method of the murder, then the approximate
time at which it had been committed, and if possible
the motive. The first could only be done with the
assistance of medical men, and a careful autopsy of
the body was made by two doctors skilled in post-
mortem work. The doctors found that the wounds

the method of the murder, then the approximate
time at which it had been committed, and if possible
the motive. The first could only be done with the
assistance of medical men, and a careful autopsy of
the body was made by two doctors skilled in post-
mortem work. The doctors found that the wounds
on the skull would not have been sufficient to cause


death, and they surmised that the woman had been
struck from behind with some blunt instrument, such
as the back of a tomahawk, and her throat cut while
she lay in an unconscious state.
The detectives then propounded the following
theory as to how the murder was committed : The
murderer had despatched his victim on some errand
which would keep her absent from the house suffi-
ciently long to enable him to prepare the grave in
the back bedroom, and make ready the cement with
which he was to encase the body, in the hope that
it would for ever conceal his terrible secret. The pre-
paration of the grave must have occupied some con-
siderable time. The mantelpiece was first carefully
removed, the hearthstone raised, and a hole exca-
vated amply large enough to contain the body. All
these arrangements completed, the murderer waited
for his victim. On her return he no doubt persuaded
her to have a bath to refresh her after her walk.
The woman readily fell in with the suggestion—for
it was the height of summer time—and while she
was undressing the mail suddenly entered the bath-
room, struck her on the head, and stunned her. He
then dragged her body into the bedroom, where he
completed his bloody deed by cutting her throat.
The body was stripped of the little clothing it had
on, for two reasons ; first, to allow more room for
the earth and cement in the narrow grave; and
second, to make identification more difficult should
the body ever be unearthed. The body w T as trussed
and bound by a silken cord, so that it would pack
into the smallest possible space ; the cement
was poured over it and carefully levelled. The

hearthstone was relaid, and the mantelpiece fixed
back in its position in a way that denoted a skilled
workman. But the murderer either forgot, or never
knew, that a body in decomposing generates gases
which cause it to swell; and the action of these gases
cracked the cement, and raised the hearthstone out
of position, thus providing a vent for the escape of
the noisome smell which first led to the detection of
the murder. The most cunning general plans are
frequently marred by some trivial blunder, and in
the interests of justice it is well that this should be
so. Had the murderer only smothered the body of
his victim in some destructive agent, such as quick
lime, he might still have been pursuing his blood-
thirsty career. So much for the method of the
murder.

rented by “ Mr. Drewn” on December 17th, 1891.

worth of sand, a trowel, a spade, and a broom were

The neighbours saw the woman about until

of a laundry in the vicinity, saw hei that day when
he called to deliver some washing entrusted to him


by “Mr. Drewn.” Thereafter she was never seen,,
and the detectives arrived at the conclusion that she-
was murdered that very night. The only question
which now remained to be solved was the motive.
Before any theorising was possible, it was necessary
to ascertain the identity of the murderer and his.
victim. The only clues that a careful search of the
house revealed were a small piece of a copy of the
Liverpool Guardian , a baggage ticket bearing the
stamp of Messrs. F. Tate and Co., baggage agents,
of Melbourne, and an invitation card, much blurred,
but which, under powerful magnifying glasses, was
deciphered to read :
“Mr. and Mrs. Albert Williams request the pleasure of
at a social evening in the Commercial Hall
on evening.”
This information was published in the Melbourne
newspapers along with a description of the man who
had rented the house and ordered the cement ; and a
Mr. Max Hirschfeldt immediately waited upon the
detectives and informed them that he believed the
man calling himself “ Drewn ” was identical with a
man named Albert Williams, who, accompanied by
Mrs. Williams, came to \ ictoria in the Gferman mail-
steamer Kaiser Wilhelm 11., arriving in Melbourne
on December 16th, 1891. Mr. Hirschfeldt had been
a passenger by the same steamer, and had seen a
good deal of the couple, whom he described as an
ill-assorted pair. Ihe husband was a blustering y
blatant, self-assertive, bullying man ; while the wife
was a mild-mannered, intelligent, ladylike woman,
who appeared to live in constant dread of her

was a mild-mannered, intelligent, ladylike woman,
who appeared to live in constant dread of her
iiusband. She had confided to some of her fellow-


passengers that her relatives lived near Liverpool,.,
and that she had been married a few weeks before
the commencement of the voyage. Her husband
was also communicative to the passengers, par-
ticularly about his wife, whom, in his more affable
moments, he described as the “ dearest little
woman in the world,” and told, with much
apparent self-satisfaction, how as a girl she
had been left fatherless, and was obliged to
struggle to support her mother and sisters. This
she bravely did by selling newspapers, and her
industry, combined with her winning ways, attracted
the attention of the Liverpool representative of the
great newspaper distributing firm of W. H. Smith
and Son, who established her mother and herself in a
stationery business, which had turned out a great
success. Out of all the presents she received on her
wedding day that she prized the most was the
handsome gift made her by this great firm. Such
was one of the many stories which W illiams told,
and it was a matter of wonderment amongst the
passengers that he was not just a little more consider-
ate of the “ dear little wife,” who certainly merited
all the encomiums her husband ever passed on her.
Mr. Hirschfeldt was taken to the Melbourne
morgue and at once identified the corpse of the
murdered woman as that of Mrs. Williams. He
also provided the officers of the Criminal Investiga-

passengers that her relatives lived near Liverpool,.,
and that she had been married a few weeks before
the commencement of the voyage. Her husband
was also communicative to the passengers, par-
ticularly about his wife, whom, in his more affable
moments, he described as the “ dearest little
woman in the world,” and told, with much
apparent self-satisfaction, how as a girl she
had been left fatherless, and was obliged to
struggle to support her mother and sisters. This
she bravely did by selling newspapers, and her
industry, combined with her winning ways, attracted
the attention of the Liverpool representative of the
great newspaper distributing firm of W. H. Smith
and Son, who established her mother and herself in a
stationery business, which had turned out a great
success. Out of all the presents she received on her
wedding day that she prized the most was the
handsome gift made her by this great firm. Such
was one of the many stories which W illiams told,
and it was a matter of wonderment amongst the
passengers that he was not just a little more consider-
ate of the “ dear little wife,” who certainly merited
all the encomiums her husband ever passed on her.
Mr. Hirschfeldt was taken to the Melbourne
morgue and at once identified the corpse of the
murdered woman as that of Mrs. Williams. He
also provided the officers of the Criminal Investiga-
tion Branch with a full description of the husband.
The murderer was, he said, sft. Bin. in height,
stoutly built, with a fair complexion and a fair
moustache. He spoke with a Lancashire accent,
described himself as an engineer, and always wore a


large quantity of jewellery. There could be no
doubt this was the murderer; but now the detectives
had discovered his ide'ntity they could conceive no
motive for the crime. It could not be irain, for the
O 7
woman was known to have no money. Jealousy
was out of the question, since all the passengers of
the Kaiser W ilHelm 11. whom the detectives
interviewed were unanimous in their opinion that
there could not have been a more devoted wife.
could the idea of his having murdered her
in a sudden fit of anger be accepted. Every cir-
cumstance connected with the tragedy showed that
it had been skilfully planned and deliberately pre-
meditated. The murderer was, as far as could be
ascertained, thoroughly sane, and the only conclusion
that remained for the detectives to accept was that
the woman had discovered some secret in her
husband s past life which lie feared she might
betray. They shrewdly decided that that secret
must be of some portentous nature when the fear
of its disclosure prompted the man to murder the
wife whom he had wedded only a few months before.
Their success in tracing the criminal had so far
exceeded their most sanguine expectations, and,
though no details were vouchsafed, the public were
astounded by a published statement that the
detectives were confident they would have the
murderer arrested within a week. Detectives
Considine and Cawsey were never known to be idle
boasters, or boasters at all for the matter of that;

ment was made that the detectives for Once had
been carried away by their extraordinary good luck.

already long list of swindles. Living at the same
hotel with him was a gentleman holding a respon-
sible position under a prominent city firm of
jewellers. Williams took special pains to ingratiate
himself with this gentleman, and gave the firm a few
minor jobs, the most remarkable of which was
having the wedding ring of the woman whom he
had murdered mounted on a black ebony stick he
constantly carried. For these few trifles he paid
promptly, making a great display in drawing his
cheques, which were always met. Having succeeded,
however, in establishing a reputation for commercial
probity, he obtained on approbation two diamond
rings, one of which he promised to return, and to

inquiries as to how Mrs. Selby had prospered. since

that his wife, who had been great friends with Mrs.

years ago, from fever, and that he had lost his
children from a similar cause. The more Mrs.
Selby considered the matter the more convinced was
she that something was wrong, and finally her
suspicions became so strong that she disclosed them
to the detectives. Closer inquiries were made, and
it was soon established that Frederick Bailey
Deeming was identical with “ Albert Williams,”
“ Mr. Drewn,” “ Mr. Duncan ” and the host of other
aliases.
No sooner was this announcement made public
than from almost every part of Australia came tales
of dishonesty, fraud, and theft practised by this
remarkable man. But the coping stone to his
iniquitous career had yet to be added. It was done
through the enterprise of the Melbourne Argus.

patch a representative to Liverpool, whence Williams
and his wife were said to have hailed. This repre-

DEEMING’S FIRST CRIME.
“ That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain.”
FBEDK. BAILEY DEEMING was born at
Birkenhead, Cheshire, England, in # 1853. He
had, as far as can be ascertained, two brothers. The
parents were respectable, hard-working people, and
the boys, when they reached an age at which they
might be expected to shift for themselves, were
apprenticed to the trade of plumbing and gasfitting.
Fred, who was the youngest of the family, developed
at an early age a tendency to vain display, and a
desire for travel. Frequently he twitted his
brothers with lack of enterprise, and as soon as he
had qualified himself as a tradesman he announced
his intention to see the world. From their youth
he and his brother Albert had courted two sisters
named James, natives of Pembrokeshire, Wales,
and whose father was a quarryman. Early in 1880
both brothers were married on the same day.
Almost immediately afterwards an opportunity was
afforded Fred of emigrating to Australia. He was

No language was too glowing to describe his wife,

came therefore as a terrible shock to his friends and
acquaintances when on the eve of the wife’s arrival
in Sydney in 1882, that Deeming was suspected of
stealing some brass fittings of trivial value from his
employers. The charge appeared to affect him

fact that a youth, also in the employ of Messrs.

prosecutor on this occasion, with remarkable legal
acumen, promptly applied for a remand in order
that the authenticity of the document might be
tested. The prisoner, with overweening confidence,,
offered no objections. Inquiries soon disclosed the
impudent subterfuge.. While the case was still
under hearing, and Deeming was at liberty on
bail readily provided for him by friends who
could not believe him guilty, he visited the
firm in question at an early hour in the morning
when no one was on the premises but a carter.
Providing him with a list of the aitides, he assuied
the carter that he had purchased them from the
firm, and was anxious to pay, as he had to leave the
city before the bookkeeper could be in attendance.
The carter, suspecting no fraud, readily gave a
receipt on one of the firm s invoice forms, and when
he told the bookkeeper of the occurrence, the latter
considered it merely a mistake on the part of the
purchaser, who would not be slow in remedying it.
No further notice was therefore paid to the
incident until the police called. Then it was clearly
shown that it was impossible for Deeming to have
purchased the artides from this firm since they had
no such materials in stock. The prisoner s second
appearance in the dock was brief. There was an


for the jury to do aught but find him guilty,.
Deeming produced, to the astonishment of judge,
jury, counsel, and spectators, a receipt from a well
known Sydney firm for the identical articles which
had been found in his possession, and which he was
accused of having stolen. In nine cases out of
ten the ruse would have succeeded, but the crown
prosecutor on this occasion, with remarkable legal
acumen, promptly applied for a remand in order

appearance in the dock was brief. There was an


air of assumed innocence on his face when, arrayed
in a faultless suit of sombre black, he took up his
position in court; but he was much disconcerted
when the first witness called announced himself as
bookkeeper to the firm of ironmongers from whom
the purchases were alleged to have been made, and
rapidly detailed the circumstances under which the
spurious receipt had been obtained. Nothing more
was needed to convince the jury of the prisoner s
guilt, and he was sentenced to six weeks’
imprisonment. The leniency of the punishment
astounded everyone except the prisoner, who pro-
fessed to be thoroughly unnerved by the disgrace
which had overtaken him, and he fell fainting
upon the floor of the dock. This display, in the
face of the further development of Deeming’s
personality, bears the strong impress of idle
theatrical posturing. It may have been, how-
ever, that the man’s grief was genuine, and that
this was the first indication of the triumph of a
perverted moral nature over better instincts.
Be that as it may, there can be no doubt that
the incident seriously affected his youthful wife.
She had come to join him with bright hopes for the
future. Her naturally joyous disposition had
expanded and blossomed in anticipation of a happy
life in this sunny clime. Her husband, who till
this time had borne an irreproachable character,
now stood branded as a convicted thief. She was a
stranger in a strange land, and it is not surprising
to learn from those who were acquainted with her
that her cheeriness changed to gloom, and that from

“ Oh, how will crime engender crime ! throw guilt
Upon the soul. and like a stone, cast on
The troubled waters of a lake,

Each wider than the first.”
AFTER Deeming’s release from gaol he expressed
the deepest and most sincere repentance for
his misdoing. He pleaded he had fallen the victim
to a sudden temptation, but promised to “ woo the
ano-el virtue for the future.” Towards his wife he
behaved with the greatest tenderness and afrection,
but all his kindness failed to revive in her the hearty
spirits she possessed when she first came to the
colonies. Her idol had been sadly shattered, yet
she believed in him still, though with a deeper if
less patent credence. With a hope of outliving
this first disgrace they left for Melbourne, where his
ready assurance and extraordinary power of inspiring
confidence soon secured for Deeming a position with
Messrs. John Danks and Sons, of Bourke-street, and
he prospered so well that in July, 1883, they recom-
mended him for the position of manager with Messrs.
Williams Brothers, plumbers and gasfitters, of
William-street, Rockhampton. In the practical
work of the position he did not prove himself as

Prosperity soon revived his vaulting ambition, and
he had not been in his new situation many months
when he was seized with a desire to start business
on his own account. To that end he addressed the
following letter to Mr. I)anks, who had befriended
him in Melbourne :

« Dear Sir,—l am happy to say that Rockhampton is a fine
place for business. I started the above shop four months ago
with one man, and now I have got 10 men and sixboys, and I
can see there is plenty of room for another plumbei s shop , and
a great many of the gentlemen here, and two of the M.P. s,

think of doing so, will you lend me a stock to the amount of
about £lOO (one hundred pounds), and give me about six months
to pay the money. I have my life insured for £5OO, to be drawn
when I am 50 years of age, and, if you wish for surety, I will
send you the deeds. It is only a little start that I shall want, as
I know the business will go ahead well. There is many gentle-

would rather go to those I have dealt with before. Kindly
answer this letter and let me know what you think.—From

first child was born there. Things went badly with


him for a time. He held situations at different
plumbers’ shops, but could never keep them long, as,
by a strange coincidence, wherever he was sent to
do work in the city or suburbs some loss of
jewellery or other valuables followed his departure.
He was also remarkable for his persistent attentions
to the ladies of any house he might be sent to. His
attentions were not ordinary civilities, but extra-
ordinary manifestations of devotion, which he used
to tender in the direction of matrimony. He
would bombard the kitchen with the same evi-
dent satisfaction in search of the servant if he
failed in his higher bight to the parlour; and
the strange part of the whole business is that
he was generally successful in making an im-

a Burwood household, occupied by an old and
respected clergyman, Deeming was sent by his
employer to do some plumbing. While engaged at
his occupation he found time to make love to a
pretty parlourmaid employed in the house. She
was susceptible, and he was successful. They
became engaged, his existing marriage leaked out,
and a painful ending followed. The girl broke her
heart, and retired into obscurity.

them with him, he made for Adelaide, where he


assumed the alias of Ward, and at once set his wits
to work to enable him to get out of the colonies.
His method was as follows : —He and his wife put
up at an hotel in Port Adelaide where they stayed
for about a month or five weeks, explaining that they
were waiting for a vessel to South Africa, which was
their ultimate destination. Deeming made a great
display of the money he possessed, and, as he was
liberally supplied with jewellery, the proprietor of
the hotel regarded him as a wealthy man, though
his conduct at times created some suspicion. At the
same hotel lodged two brothers named Howe, with
whom Deeming rapidly struck up an acquaintance,
which deepened into warm friendship, Mr. and
Mrs. Deeming and the brothers Howe were con-
stantly about together, and it was not until the eve
the Howe’s departure for St. Helena on the 31st
January, 1888 that they had any reason to doubt
the bona jides of their new acquaintance. On the
afternoon of the same day the Howes, accompanied
by Deeming, visited Adelaide, where the brothers
drew from one of the banks £6O in gold, in the
presence of their friend. They were robbed of that
money in the night-time, and they openly expressed
their suspicions of Deeming, who was the only person
who knew that they had the money and where
they kept it. They were obliged, however, to sail
on. the following day, and nothing came of the
matter in Adelaide. With characteristic impudence
Deeming took passages for himself, wife and two
children on board the “ Barossa,” by which the
brothers Howe were sailing for St. Helena.
Deeming and his family did not join the boat till she


assumed the alias of Ward, and at once set his wits

Howe interpreted this action as a further proof of
Deeming’s guilt, When they were at sea they
openly accused Deeming of having stolen their
money, and laid a full statement of the facts before
the captain and the passengers, with the result
that during the rest of the voyage Deeming
was “sent to Coventry.” On the voyage Mrs.
Deeming was confined of a male child, which was
christened Sidney. At St. Helena Deeming
approached the brothers Howe, and, after remon-
strating with them for having falsely accused him,
said that by reason of the friendship which had
existed between them at Port Adelaide he could not
now see them in want of money, and would provide
them with the necessary funds to pay their passage
to Capetown. They all went ashore with that
understanding, and soon afterwards the “ Dunrobin

raised some paltry excuse for not taking passages
by this boat, but just as the steamer was about to

impudent boastfulness, and his specious manner
afforded him an easy livlihood. He had in addition
an aptitude for imitating signatures which he also


pressed into service ; and it was not long before he
met his first victim. Two gentlemen who had been
up country at the diamond fields had returned to
Capetown, and one of them was just about to leave
by a steamer for England when Deeming introduced
himself. He asserted, with much circumstantiality,
that he too had been in the interior, and while there
discovered a valuable diamond field in the Transvaal,
which was still under offer to him. The price was
said to be £2,000, and as he could not command
so much capital himself he was anxious to find some
speculators to join him in the venture. He gave
glowing descriptions of the mine, and produced
several rough stones which he claimed had been
found on the field, and finally persuaded these
gentlemen to seriously consider his proposals. The
scheme remained in abeyance for a few days, during
which Deeming continued to enlarge on its merits.
As a further proof, if any were necessary, that all
was as he represented it to be, he requested these
gentlemen to investigate the place for themselves.
They fell in with this idea, and an agreement was
arrived at that should the property on inquiry coin-
cide with the description given, Deeming was to
receive £2,000. One of the gentlemen then sailed for
England, deputing his friend to make the investiga-
tion and purchase the propeity if he was satisfied
the transaction was a good one. In pursuance of
these plans this gentleman left for the Transvaal
immediately. While in the Transvaal he received a
telegram alleged to be from his friend in England,
requesting him to pay over the amount agreed upon

self turned up with a similar message, which
was also a forgery. The gentleman, however,
was deceived, and handed the money over to
Deeming, who at once took his departure for Cape-
town under the excuse that it was necessary tor him
to visit that city before he could obtain portion of
the papers necessary to complete the transfer. Of
course he never was seen again, and it did not take
the stranger long to learn that the whole sale was
bogus, and that he had been victimised. The second
gentleman concerned in the transaction was apprised
of the outcome of the dealing, and he at once set the
detectives in England at work on the case. Nothing
could, however, be done as no extradition treaty
exists between England and the Transvaal. A few
months later the victim of this plot received infor-
mation that Deeming had made his way to England,
and was at that very time on board the mail steamer
“ Jumna,” sailing for Brisbane, Australia. The
detectives were again set to work and cabled to the
Brisbane police, who met the “ Jumna on her
arrival. The Brisbane police then learnt from the
captain of the steamer that a passenger correspond-
ing in all details with the description provided of
Deeming had taken a passage on the boat from
England under the name of Levy, but that he had
left her at Aden, under the pretence of awaiting
the arrival of a coffin containing the body of a
very dear friend of his who had died in South
Africa. Still later the gentleman who had
been swindled in the Transvaal received infor-
mation that a man resembling Deeming had

was also a forgery. The gentleman, however,
was deceived, and handed the money over to
Deeming, who at once took his departure for Cape-
town under the excuse that it was necessary tor him
to visit that city before he could obtain portion of
the papers necessary to complete the transfer. Of
course he never was seen again, and it did not take
the stranger long to learn that the whole sale was
bogus, and that he had been victimised. The second
gentleman concerned in the transaction was apprised
of the outcome of the dealing, and he at once set the
detectives in England at work on the case. Nothing
could, however, be done as no extradition treaty
exists between England and the Transvaal. A few
months later the victim of this plot received infor-
mation that Deeming had made his way to England,
and was at that very time on board the mail steamer
“ Jumna,” sailing for Brisbane, Australia. The
detectives were again set to work and cabled to the
Brisbane police, who met the “ Jumna on her
arrival. The Brisbane police then learnt from the
captain of the steamer that a passenger correspond-
ing in all details with the description provided of
Deeming had taken a passage on the boat from
England under the name of Levy, but that he had
left her at Aden, under the pretence of awaiting
the arrival of a coffin containing the body of a
very dear friend of his who had died in South
Africa. Still later the gentleman who had
been swindled in the Transvaal received infor-
mation that a man resembling Deeming had
been frequently seen about Birkenhead, England.


He visited that town with the idea of laying the
swindler by the heels, and though he learnt that such
a man had been in the place, he had now disappeared,
leaving no clue as to his whereabouts.
This was not the only fraud by many which
are placed to Deeming’s credit during his short
sojourn in Kaffirland. He was not slow to dis-
cover the flaw in the extradition law, and, re-
cognising he was safe from prosecution for his
first fraud so long as he remained where he
was, he once more set his wits to work.
Making his way to Durban and Natal, he spread
stories of discoveries of gold mines, and, by aid of
an accomplice, who has not been detected, he
obtained £6OO for the sale of rights which he never
owned. Next he resorted to Johannesburg, in the
South African Republic, and there worked himself
into the confidence of two gentlemen named Messrs.
Grice and Ansell, who held good positions in the
settlement. Through their good offices he obtained
from a local banker an advance of £3,000, si vino-
-7 ' O fc"'
references to well-known business people in Caj)e-
town, By some mysterious means, the letters
testing these references were intercepted and replied
to by Deeming’s accomplice in Capetown, and were
not discovered to be fictitious till some months
afterwards. In this case, however, Deeming made
good the money advanced him, but subsequently
obtained a further sum, with which he levanted.
Capetown again became the scene of his exploits,
and here he ordered from time to time several articles
of jewellery from a local tradesman named Mr.
Courtney, who to this day has never been paid.

Deeming had now reached the end of his tether in
South Africa. Recognising that there must be a
limit to his frauds in this colony, he had provided
against the contingency of hasty flight by sending
his wife and children to his relatives in Birkenhead,
and now that the extradition treaty provided him
with no protection, he was not slow to make himself
scarce. Every effort was made to arrest him before
he could leave the colony, but once again his cunning
was successful, and he evaded the watchfulness of
the police.

The detectives, however, getting scent of his where-

was advised by the landlord of the hotel to take
lodgings in the peaceful locality ot Beverley. He
was specially recommended to a large lodging-house
kept in New Walk by a Mrs. Matheson, who had
two daughters. The elder daughter has been
described by those who know her as a stylish, light-
hearted, taking girl, and her physical attributes
soon aroused Deeming’s amativeness, which had
never been very latent. He rapidly set himself
to woo her affections. This was in November,
1889. Miss Matheson’s life up to this time was
one in which few opportunities for enjoyment had
offered themselves. Her father died whilst she
was yet a child, and she had been taken care of
by her grandparents, who resided in Edinburgh.

ceipt of a permanent income of £1,500 per annum,
which in good seasons might be trebled or even
increased ten-fold. When, therefore, at last he
proposed to her, Miss Matheson fell a ready victim

He certainly was not handsome, and looked the full

mother for life.

on February 18th, 1890, Deeming sent Miss Mathe-

which cost 190 guineas. He also forwarded her a

in Beverley. The bride looked radiant, and in her
hair she wore the diamond crescent which was the
gift of the bridegroom. The village carriages were-
not regarded as worthy of the occasion, and special
turnouts were ordered from Hull. Thebellringershad
been given £5 by the bridegroom, and were so much
impressed by this extroardinary liberality that their
vigorous ringing of the joy bells menaced the safety
of the old church tower. A handsome gratuity to
the organist ensured a full choral service. The
Wedding March was played again and again, and
the white-robed choristers sweetly carolled “ The
voices that breathed over Eden.” Half the residents
of Beverley turned out to see the wedding, and there
were not a few envious hearts amongst the crowd
who witnessed the going away of the Scotch lassie.
The newly-married couple spent a honeymoon of
three weeks in the south of England, and returned
to Hull about the beginning of March, where they
took up quarters at the Station Hotel. Deeming
still seemed devoted to the girl whom he had so
cruelly entrapped. He often drove her to Beverley
to visit her mother and her friends, and all seemed
to be going happily till on the morning of March
15th, he left her in the hotel, saying he was
going to get shaved, and would soon be back. He
never returned. After waiting some hours for him, her
anxiety became unbearable ; she sent messengers to
inquire for him in his usual haunts, but he had not
been seen. Mrs. Matheson was communicated with,
and, after a short consultation with her daughter,
decided to approach the police. No suspicions that

this time, and the reason for calling in the assistance
of the police was that the ladies anticipated some
serious accident to their new relative. The police
were not long in discovering the true character of
this soi disant squatter from Northern Queensland.
He had gone to the jeweller’s immediately after
leaving his bride in the hotel, and obtained the
diamond bracelet previously ordered from London,
besides a necklet and ring to match, of the value in
all of £285. For these and the articles which he
had purchased before the wedding, Deeming paid
with two cheques on the local bank. This was on
Saturday, which is observed as a half-holiday in
Hull, and the banks were accordingly closed.
When on Monday morning the cheques were pre-
sented they were dishonoured. Revelation then
followed revelation. It came to light that Deeming
had sailed for South America in a vessel bound to
Monte Video. He had taken his passage before
ever he had commenced paying court to Miss
Matheson, and the whole of his love-making and
marriage was merely a blind to deceive the local
tradesmen and lend colour to his stories of great
wealth. Not satisfied with swindling the trades-
people, he was contemptible enough to rob the girl
whom he had so cruelly betrayed. He took from
her all the presents he had made her, and also those
which had been given her by relatives and friends.
He obtained her wedding ring by the mean device
that it did not fit her, and he would have it altered ;
and he even decamped with her trousseau. The poor
girl was almost broken-hearted, and returned to the
village which she had left amid so much joy-making.

in this instance it was successfully executed. He
was apprehended in Monte \ ideo, extradited to
England, and there sentenced to nine months’ im-
prisonment on charges of false pretences. Released
from prison early in 1891, Deeming returned to
Hull, and renewed his attentions to Miss Mathe-

his side as his wife, when she learnt that he was
already a married man, and had a wife and family
living at Birkenhead. Out of consideration for her

FINDING that Miss Matheson declined to have-

long-suffering wife. One would have thought that
if reproach were necessary in this domestic circle it
should have been the wife’s prerogative; but

with the information which enabled them to trace
him to Monte Video, but also with doing her utmost

public may be left to judge how much truthfulness
there was in these accusations. Too often had the
woman, at the risk of her own liberty, shielded him
from the officers of the law, and enabled him to
escape from justice ; and it is scarcely likely that at

Deeming’s indignation was shortlived, and he
and his wife once more resumed their conjugal rela-


tions. The reconcilation did not, however, last long.
After a few weeks of respectability Deeming
absconded from home, taking with him a hundred
pounds of his wife’s hard-earned savings. He
crossed the river to Liverpool, and resumed his
former extravagant method of living. He forged
cheques which he passed oft* on the local trades-
men, adopted several aliases, and made love to a
young woman whom he chanced to meet at one ot
the hotels that he patronised. He commenced his
suit with splendid presents of jewellery, sub-
sequently discovered to be spurious, and would have
induced the lady to marry him had not his wife
opportunely appeared upon the scene. Further
reproaches ensued, and Deeming, hoping to elude
his wife’s importunities, made his way to Rainhill,
a village of about two thousand inhabitants, two
miles and a half from Prescot, Lancashire, and nine
miles from Liverpool. Here he established himself
at the Commercial Hotel under the sobriquet of
Albert Williams. He announced himself as a
military officer home on furlough from India. His
habits of good living, and the ready manner in
which he spent his money, attracted attention to
his movements ; and his wife had no difficulty in

daughter of an old and respected village resi-

a suitable lie. She was his sister, he told the hotel-

keeper, and Miss Mather; but Mrs. Deeming’s per-
sistency made the situation complicated, and
threatened to defeat his latest amourette. He
accordingly conceived the diabolical plan of mur-
dering his wife and family, and so clearing away all
obstacles to his designs.
With perfect self-possession and fiendish malig-
nancy he commenced to arrange the details of his
devilish scheme. He rented a house known as
Denham Villa, which was situated on the outskirts of
Bainhill, and entirely isolated. On July 30th, 1891,
he signed an agreement for six months occupancy of
the villa, and paid the rent in advance. He pre-
tended to act as the agent for a certain Col. Brooks,
and one of the conditions attached to the lease was
that the new occupant should be permitted to
cement the floor at his own expense. The villa was
then fairly well furnished by a local firm, and five
barrels of cement which had been ordered in Li ver-
pool by Deeming in Miss Mather’s name were
delivered at the house. Col. Brooks, as may be
imagined, failed to put in an appearance, but a lady
and some children were noticed to take up their
residence in the villa. Deeming was a constant
visitor. Though he informed the neighbours that the
o o

and nieces, the tenants were in reality his wife and
family, whom he had decoyed to the house in order
to butcher them.

one of those extraordinary blunders which seem


inseparable from all great crimes, Deeming had
poured upon the bodies of his victims a large
quantity of chloride of lime in the belief, no doubt,
that it would destroy them. On the contrary the
chloride of lime had quite the opposite effect ;
instead of promoting decomposition it checked it,
and when the bodies were exhumed they were found

The bodies had been placed in a grave dug under
the kitchen floor. The woman was laid with her

The murdered children had been buried in their night-
shirts only, but the woman was fully dressed. From
this circumstance it is concluded that the murders
were committed early in the evening, just after the
children had been put to bed, and before Deeming
and his wife had retired. Mrs Deeming’s corpse
was tied tightly with a rope, though for what
purpose it is difficult to surmise. After the bodies
were placed in the ground they were covered with
oilcloth and Turkish towelling, and over all was
poured large quantities of wet cement. During the

inseparable from all great crimes, Deeming had
poured upon the bodies of his victims a large
quantity of chloride of lime in the belief, no doubt,
that it would destroy them. On the contrary the
chloride of lime had quite the opposite effect ;
instead of promoting decomposition it checked it,
and when the bodies were exhumed they were found
in so excellent a state of preservation that the
manner of doing to death was readily observed, and

tioned him as to what had become of the lady and

gone to Port Said to join her husband. Deeming
was smoking while at work, and on the table was
O '
noticed a half-emptied bottle of port wine. Next
day he engaged a Rainhill tradesman to complete
the cementing of the floor, and that night returned
to his old quarters at the Commercial Hotel.
During the course of the evening he complained of
having caught a severe cold, which had culminated
in shivering fits, and he indulged very freely in nips
of neat brandy. As he had always posed as a tem-
perance man, this excess was remarked upon by
several persons in the hotel, but Deeming’s ex-
planation disarmed further comment.
Soon afterwards it was given forth that Col.
Brooks had changed his plans and was not coming
to Rainhill. The furniture with which the villa had
been stocked was, therefore, placed in the hands of
an auctioneer, and disposed of without reserve.
Several heavy trunks were despatched to Plymouth,
addressed to Col. Brooks, but that mythical gentle-
man never claimed them, and when they Anally
passed into the hands of the police they were found
to contain the earth which had been taken from
under the kitchen floor of the Rainhill Villa to
make room for the corpses, and a quantity of blood-
stained garments which had evidently been used to
remove all traces of the tragedy. Still further to
avert suspicion, Deeming, before abandoning the
villa, paid local workmen to cement the floor of the
pantry and one of the outhouses. He also employed
a charwoman to thorougly scrub out the house, and

the strange odour was due to the fact that having
found the drainage bad he had used a disinfectant.

“ Maidens like moths are ever caught by glare,
And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.
THESE obstacles to his latest designs having

To lend colour to the statements that he was a

visit to London and the Continent. He gave
various reasons for his departure, but the real
object was revealed some months later when it came
out that he had swindled several merchants in Ant-
werp, where he masqueraded under the name of Lord
Dunn. Similar practices were carried on in London,
till he obtained sufficient money to enable him to
celebrate his marriage with Miss Mather with the
display he so much loved, and leave enough to carry
him and his bride out of the country.

During his brief absence the residents of Rain-

at the conclusion that there was something not
altogether right about him. The stories which he
o o
scattered broadcast did not dovetail with an accuracy
that guaranteed their foundation on fact. The non-
appearance of the mysterious Colonel Brooks, and
the disappearance of the mysterious sister and her
children were also discussed, and the verdict was
much against Deeming. These were trifles light as
air to a man of his resources, and a few more facile
falsehoods explained away the discrepancies which
were hinted to him, and further prodigality of enter-
tainment gained him many of the waverers. Some
of the more level-headed declined to be deceived by
his specious stories, and as these possessed
considerable influence in the community, Deeming
recognised the necessity of hurrying on the marriage
and leaving the place before he should be unmasked.

nothing ao-ainst her future husband, and when the

After further protests from the members of Miss

the wedding day was fixed for September 22nd,
1891. On the eve of the wedding Deeming, as he
had done when he contracted the bigamous marriage
with Miss Matheson at Beverley in the preceding


year, gave an elaborate farewell “ bachelor ” ban-
quet. So strong, however, had the feeling against
Deeming grown in the meantime that several of
the invited guests failed to put in an appearance on
this festive occasion, a circumstance which made
him exceedingly furious. Following out a
biblical precedent, he sent the landlord out into the
highways and by-ways to search for worthy occu-
pants of the vacant chairs. Amongst the guests
was the tradesman who had completed the cementing
of the floors at Denham Villa. Deeming, for some
reason, known only to himself, had given him five
guineas to purchase a dress suit so as to be able to
be present. The wedding day was a day of great
festivity. Deeming entertained the villagers at a
fete, and the bride and bridegroom left the place
amid a perfect salvo of “ Hurrahs ” and “ God
bless you’s.” India, he told the bride and her
relatives, was their destination. He had, he said,
to return to Bombay to resume his position of
Comptroller of Military Stores, and they were to
sail in the Kaiser Wilhelm II at the end of
October.
The honeymoon was spent at Hastings, and
during its continuance Deeming succeeded in adding-
several hotelkeepers and tradesmen to the lengthy
list of persons whom he had victimised. The
steamer was a few days late in turning up at
Southampton, and this delay caused Deeming some
anxiety, for he recognised that there was more than
a possibility of his being tracked by the police, and
his trip indefinitely postponed. The phenomenal
good luck which had hitherto attended Deeming in

all his efforts to escape the law was not yet
exhausted, and on November 2nd the steamer
started for Australia with him and his wife safely
on board. The passengers provided his boastfulness
with a new field of exercise. He posed as the
much-travelled man, who had worked camps of
negroes in Mexico, hunted the buffalo on the
prairies of the United States, toiled on the diamond
fields, and followed the course of the Congo in
Africa, and been carried by servants for days
together under the burning sun of India. For a
O C ' J
time he was allowed to monopolise the pedestal of
attention, but ultimately his government grew too
arbitrary, and some of the passengers who had had
acquaintance with the countries mentioned by
Deeming grew tired of his reminiscences, and, by
well-directed examinations, proved him to be
lying ; and at last he was left with only the diamond
fields of South Africa and the pitiless suns of India
to boast about. Here he held undisputed sway,
because no one on board the steamer in his class had
been in either place, and could not therefore cross
swords with him and find whether he lied about
them as he had done about the others. Deeming
was not easily vanquished. Having, by reason of
contradictions, exhausted the subject of travel, he
figured as an authority on military matters, and
claimed to be an ex-major of the British army. He

playing his jewellery, and his diamonds passed from
hand to hand on exhibition, and were generally
admired.
While Deeming was thus passing his time, and,
by reason of his consistent lying and exaggeration
and his overbearing disposition, earning the heartiest
dislike and contempt of the passengers, his wife was
making quite an opposite impression. She was
'petite, quiet, intelligent, ladylike, and altogether
loveable. She had a kindly heart and quick
sympathies, and her word was as much respected as
her husband’s was disbelieved and contemned. She
is thus described by Mr. Bradley, of Petersham,
Sydney, who was one of her fellow passengers .
“ She was just in the flower of her womanhood, all the
stages of girlhood passed, and the thoughtful,
serious, solicitous, ministering woman of twenty-
seven was before us. But the beauty of girlhood
was not passed, No wrinkle or grey hair or anxious
line was visible. It seemed that she had reached, but
not passed, the full meridian of woman s beauty and
strength, and ere that stage had begun to recede
had taken the supreme departure in a woman s life.
She was of medium height, of rather full figure,
complexion dark, but skin clear, of a slightly tawny
tint, with a surface soft as satin. A pair of large
lustrous brown eyes shone underneath a beautifully
arched forehead. Nose prominent and aquiline, and
told of considerable force of character. Mouth
small and prettily cut, as though to enhance the
witchery of a smile. A rich profusion of dark hair
brushed smoothly and straightly across the forehead,

calm and satisfiedness about the countenance gener-

approach was somewhat shy, but in no sense
awkward. There was the quick, momentary Hush
at times, natural to a newly-married lady, but that
would pass ; and as she talked the eyes would fill
with earnestness, and the whole countenance become
radient. She spoke often of her widowed mother,
to whom she had evidently been more than a
daughter. She read much ; not the flippant book-
stall novel, but from the great authors who have
laid hold of humanity. At the Sunday services,
when held-—for the captain would not always permit
them —she was an interested worshipper. She
would turn over the pages of my little daughter s
copy of ‘ Hymns Ancient and Modern, and point
out the hymns she loved most, relating that these
had been her favourites in church service from child-
hood. Her dress reflected her general character.
Well-fitting, appropriate, in perfect taste, except an

speech would have withered her like an east wind.

Deeming cannot have been too considerate in his


method of disclosing his altered plans to his wile.
Fellow passengers distinctly remember how, when she
came to tell them she was going all the way to
Australia, she was red-eyed and unusually agitated.
The ‘scales had apparently fallen troin her eyes, and
the warnings of her friends at Ramhill wei e recalled
with no uncertain voice. The first disappointment
over, she soon resumed her former contentedness.
To Deeming s credit it must be recorded that he was
in public very attentive to his wife and treated her
well. So marked was his devotion that, apart
altogether from her youth and the statement that
she had been recently married, his loving attitude
would have been ample to prove to the passengers
that they had not yet passed through the realm of
honeymooning.
Shortly afterwards an unpleasant incident oc-
curred, in which Deeming was the chief actor, and
which served to reveal to his latest bride the tiue
character of her lord and master. Prompted either
by a malicious disposition, or a desire to raise money
by a process of blackmailing, Deeming reported to
the captain that a necklace of heavy gold set with
diamonds and other precious stones, and valued at
upwards of £IOO, had been stolen from his cabin.
The trinket had been worn by Mrs. Deeming for
some days after the ship left England, and was
certainly missing when the complaint was made.
Deeming pretended to be highly incensed over the
theft, and repeatedly asked that the captain should
order the ship to be searched from hold to mast-
head in order that the culprit might be discoveied.
The captain was naturally averse to doing anything

which might create discord and engender ill-feeling
among his passengers. He accordingly instituted a
private inquiry, and was soon convinced that
Deeming’s accusations were altogether false, nor.
was he slow to inform the accuser of this fact.
Deeming was simply beside himself with wrath
when the commander thus publicly branded him as
a liar. He rated the stewards at table, growled at
the cooking, and adopted many other methods of
showing his ill-temper. When his passion had
exhausted itself, he resorted to cunning. A note
was pinned to one of the doors of the second-class
saloon to the effect that a certain lady passenger,
whose name was given, had been seen by two wit-
nesses to take the missing jewellery, and that these
witnesses would be glad to come forward and give
evidence as soon as a reward was offered. The lady
accused was the wife of a prominent resident of
Brisbane (Q.), and when she was informed of the
charge thus anonymously laid her consternation

having once proved Deeming’s untrustworthiness,
suspected him to be the author of the anonymous
document, and took steps to establish his surmise.
Deeming, unabashed by this slap in the face, offered
a reward of £lO for the return of the necklace.
But the bribe failed in its object, and the captain
having satisfied himself and the lady who was
accused that Deeming had really concocted the

Deeming next made himself notorious by his
conduct in connection with a subscription which was


raised for one of the poorer passengers on the Kaiser
Wilhelm. As a consequence of his loudly-professed
charity, and the keen interest which he displayed in
this case of distress when first mooted, Deeming was
appointed to receive donations from the occupants
of the second saloon. His energy in working up
subscriptions went far to retrieve his character which
had suffered severely in the necklace episode, but
popular prejudice was quickly revived when it came
to light that he had pocketed the money instead of
handing it over to the deserving woman for whom
it had been collected. Later a further sensation
was caused, and the evil opinions against Deeming
were emphasised by a report that he had robbed one
of the Cingalese crew of three valuable pearls.
These several events confirmed the most observant
of those on board the steamer in the belief that
Deeming was an adventurer, and though he boasted
largely of going to Australia to invest his fortune,
he had, in reality, little beyond what was repre-
sented in his own and his wife’s jewels to tide over
temporary demands. The correctness of the general
surmise that Deeming’ was nothing more nor less
O O
than a Chevalier d Industrie is borne out by his con-
duct towards a young traveller who represented him-
self to be heir to a substantial fortune, and in
command of plenty of ready cash. Deeming took
especial pains to cultivate this young fellow’s good
opinion, and even went so far as to cordially invite
him to make his home with Mrs. Deeming and him-
self when they reached Melbourne. The youth
agreed, but unfortunately, or fortunately, perhaps,
his supply of money ran out before the voyage was


raised for one of the poorer passengers on the Kaiser
Wilhelm. As a consequence of his loudly-professed
charity, and the keen interest which he displayed in
this case of distress when first mooted, Deeming was
appointed to receive donations from the occupants
of the second saloon. His energy in working up
subscriptions went far to retrieve his character which
had suffered severely in the necklace episode, but
popular prejudice was quickly revived when it came
to light that he had pocketed the money instead of
handing it over to the deserving woman for whom
it had been collected. Later a further sensation
was caused, and the evil opinions against Deeming
were emphasised by a report that he had robbed one
of the Cingalese crew of three valuable pearls.
These several events confirmed the most observant
of those on board the steamer in the belief that
Deeming was an adventurer, and though he boasted
largely of going to Australia to invest his fortune,
he had, in reality, little beyond what was repre-
sented in his own and his wife’s jewels to tide over
temporary demands. The correctness of the general

him to make his home with Mrs. Deeming and him-

agreed, but unfortunately, or fortunately, perhaps,
his supply of money ran out before the voyage was


concluded, and when the boat arrived at Williams-
town he had only a small amount to his credit,
which the purser, who had been made his treasurer
by his parents, retained and only handed over on
the termination of the trip. No sooner did Deem-
ing ascertain that his temporary protege was
financially stranded than he discovered Ins company
to be uncongenial, and rudely gave him the cold
shoulder.
During the passage Deeming constantly indulged
in pharisaical attitudinising. He discountenanced
all games of cards, deprecated dancing, and
preached many a homily on the vanities and wicked-
ness of the world. He was always first in attendance
at the church services held at irregular intervals,
and his voice was always loudest in offering hymnal
praise.

CHAPTER X.
AUSTRALIA AGAIN.
“ Foul deeds will rise,
Though all the earth o’erwhelm them,
To man’s eyes.”
THE history must now revert to the incidents
mentioned in the opening chapter. On
December 16th, 1891, the steamer Kaiser Wilhelm
11. came to her moorings in the fairway off Williams-
town, and Deeming, who retained the soubriquet
of Williams, made his farewells and departed to
Melbourne. His first night ashore was spent at the
Federal Coffee Palace, Collins-street. Next day he
commenced his search for a suitable residence, and
the villa, 57 Andrew-street, Windsor, was the house
selected. To this place his luggage and belongings
were transferred, and having completed the arrange-
ments already detailed, Deeming committed the
atrocity which ended in his undoing. Subsequent
events have shown that the main motive of his visit
to Australia was the facilitation of the murder of a
wife who had already become tiresome to him. The
crime and the method of its committal have already
been fully described. As soon as the deed was com-
mitted Deeming assumed the name of Dawson, and
went to Mr, P, Kemp, a house and estate agent in
Elizabeth-street, and rented for one week a shop
situated at 348 Little Collins-street. He explained

went to Mr, P, Kemp, a house and estate agent in
Elizabeth-street, and rented for one week a shop
situated at 348 Little Collins-street. He explained


that he had a collection of plate and curios which lie
desired to sell, and as he wanted them exposed to
view he thought a private shop would suit his pur-
pose better than a public auction room. The greater
portion of this collection consisted of the wedding
gifts made to the victim of the Windsor tragedy.
Wi. Kemp readily let the shop to Deeming,
and a day or two later the goods were set out
leady for sale. Having made his arrangement
with the landlord, Deeming visited the well known
auction mart of Beauchamp Bros., and arranged
with them to sell the goods by auction on Thursday,

He explained to the auctioneers that his reason
for offering the articles without reserve and for cash
was that he wanted the sale out of hand and the
proceeds in his pocket the same day. The firm
agreed, and the sale was held. The goods included
the articles mentioned in the advertisement, and
also several others which were not thus publicly
specified. Among the latter were large quantities
of linen and ladies’ clothing, books, oriental curios
and nick-nacks, as well as a spade, a trowel, a
night-pan, and a claw-hammer. These last articles
were those which had been purchased at the
Prahran ironmonger’s on the same day on which
Deeming rented the Windsor Villa, and they are
undoubtedly the implements with which the grave
of the victim was dug, and the bricklaying and
cementing: done. The books sold contained amongst
O <->
their number works of travel, two volumes of
Criminal Life, and an edition of Foxes Book of
Martyrs. The sale realised £6O, and this sum was
handed over to Deeming immediately in accordance
with the arrangement. The only articles unsold
were some dresses, which Deeming disposed of
privately to the dealers who were in attendance at
the auction.
Among his possessions was a canary contained
in a highly ornamental cage. The bird was a
beautiful singer, and was trained to perform several
interesting tricks. Deeming took special delight in
displaying the bird and descanting on its cleverness
to the passengers on board the Kaiser Wilhelm 11,
until it became better known than the captain him-

displaying the bird and descanting on its cleverness
to the passengers on board the Kaiser Wilhelm 11,
until it became better known than the captain him-
self. When Deeming and his wife took possession


of the house at Windsor he hung the cage and the
bird in the front verandah, presumably with the
object of leading passers-by and the tradesmen who
called to believe that the house was furnished. He
did not oifer this for public auction, for the obvious
reason that it was just possible some of the old
passengers of the Kaiser Wilhelm 11. might drop
into the sale and recognise the bird. And as
Deeming had stated just before leaving the ship
that no money in the world would induce him to
part with his pet, this sudden change in his inten-
tions might arouse suspicion. Later on, however,
he disposed of this much-prized bird and its gaudy
cage to Mr. Solomon, a dealer in Elizabeth-street,
for £3.
The proceeds of the sale and the money obtained
by the frauds on Melbourne jewellers mentioned in
the earlier chapters, provided him with a fairly good
supply of ready cash. He took a run down to the
Gippsland lakes where, under the style of Baron
Dobson, a tourist, he whiled away a few idle days.
Returning to Melbourne he became Frederick
Duncan, and took up his residence at the Cathedral
Hotel. Under this same alias he made application
to Holt’s Matrimonial Agency for a wife, but failed
to keep the appointment to meet several desirable
ladies who the conductor of the agency wrote to
inform him were registered on the books of the
establishment. On January 12th he changed his
alias again, and under the title of Baron Swanston
took passage for Sydney in the steamer Adelaide.

A most important action of his while in Mel-
bourne has almost been overlooked. On December


29th, 1890, or four days after tbe'murder of his wife
is supposed to have taken place, he wrote a long
letter to her mother at Rainhill, explaining that
they had come on to Australia instead of going to
India, because he had been offered a highly lucrative
position as manager of a tea business in Hong Kong,
and had decided to take it. “We have,” he wrote,
“ spent a very' happy Xmas. Emily is the happiest
woman ever seen. She does enjoy herself.” And
this while her corpse was yet green in the hideous
orave he had himself fashioned for it! He concluded
O
his letter by telling Mrs. Mather that they were
about to sail by the steamer Catterthun, and that
she had better not write till she heard from them
again, because they could give her no definite
address. As it would be some weeks before they
reached their destination it might be some time,
he devilishly added, before Emily would be able to
write.
On board the steamer Adelaide during the voyage
to Sydney Deeming was on his very best behaviour.
He was smitten by the charms of one of the lady
passengers, and was so much occupied in paying her
attention that little time was left him to indulge in
his favourite practices of vain boasting and constant
grumbling. When he arrived in Sydney he was
somewhat staggered to find on the wharf a man
named Mr. Garn, who had known him intimately
when he was only a working plumber of thievish
propensities. With his customary impudence, he
took the bull by the horns and saluted Mr. Garn as
soon as he stepped from the ship, telling him at the
same time that affairs had prospered with him since

he had left Sydney, and that he had come back to
pay all the creditors he had left lamenting in 1887.
He excused himself from entering into further details
then by explaining that a young lady had been placed
in his charge in Melbourne, and that he was obliged
to look after her luggage. Mr. Gram gave him his
OO O o
address, and Deeming promised to call and have a
long chat with him next evening. This appoint-
ment he kept in the most punctual way, and
remained with Mr. and Mrs. Garn for several
hours. He chatted freely while at the house,
referring particularly to his fortune and the fates of
his wife and family since they had left Australia.
Mrs. Deeming, he said, with tears welling into his
eyes, had died of fever at Johannesburg in the
Transvaal. Bertha, his eldest child, had been killed
by a buggy accident at the same place, and only
little Marie was left to him. He refrained from
mentioning the two other children who had been
born outside Australia, doubtless considering that
as nothing was known of their birth it would be
ridiculous to tax his inventiveness with explanations
of their deaths.
He played the part of the pious penitent for a
while. Money had come freely to him, he said, but
its acquirement had given him no happiness since he
had lost his dear wife and child, who should have
lived to enjoy the. pleasures which his wealth could
have provided for them. In their sudden and
early decease he recognised the hand of God chas-

in his more unregenerate days, and his conscience

return to the colony and make what reparation his
money would enable him to do to those he had
wronged. He first took little Marie to Eng-
land, and left her with her uncle in Liverpool,
where, from a letter which he had received since
his arrival in the colonies, she seemed thoroughly
happy, and to be having “ quite a holiday time.”
Then his fancy took an adventurous flight, and he
told his hosts some hair-raising stories of his
experiences among the Kaffirs, always managing to
shape his story so that he should appear the hero.
Their rapt attention made him venturesome, and he
overreached himself. Turning back one of the locks
of his hair he disclosed an ugly, raw-looking wound
upon his head : “ Do you see this dint upon the top
of my head?” he asked. “Well, I received that in
one of my affrays with the Kaffirs.” Mrs. Garn was
a sensible woman, and, however much she might
7 O
have been astray in her knowledge of South African
affairs, she was on solid ground where cuts and
wounds were concerned, and, after closely examining
Deeming’s head, and seeing that the wound had not
yet commenced to heal, she said ; “ Why, you must
be an extraordinary man if you got that wound so
long ago, and it has not yet commenced to mend.”
The woman’s shrewdness disconcerted him for the
moment, but, quickly recovering himself, he passed
the remark off jokingly, and soon after took his
departure, promising to call again before he left
Sydney. That was the last Mr. and Mrs. Garn saw
of him, but during the course of the same week they

THE MURDERER’S SECOND WOOING.
“ Was ever woman in this humor woo’d 1
Was ever woman in this humor won 1
I’ll have her, but I will not keep her long.”
DEEMING was no more truthful than usual
when he confided to Mr. Garn, on the wharf,
that a young lady had been confided to his charge
before the steamer left Melbourne, and that he was
obliged to look after her luggage. It was certainly
correct that he had promised to look after a lady’s
luggage, but he had only made her acquaintance
during the voyage, and had at once been seized with
a desire to make her his next victim. How far he
succeeded, and the methods which he employed to
gain his end are best described by the lady herself,
whose name was Miss Kate Rounsefell, With the
frankness of youth she unbosomed herself freely to
a representative of the Melbourne Aligns who
waited upon her after Deeming’s arrest. Miss
Bounsefell had been housekeeping for her brother, a
storekeeper in Broken-Hill, but in consequence of
the unsuitability of the hot climate to her health
she determined to go for a change to Bathurst, in
New South Wales, where her sister resides. She
left Adelaide in the steamer Adelaide, on January
9th, and arrived in Melbourne two days later. On

the 12th the boat sailed for Sydney, and Deeming
was amongst the first-class passengers who joined
her at Melbourne. As to future developments le*t
Miss Rounsefell herself speak. To the representa-

can tell you anything that you have not heard in
much more intelligent fashion than I can tell it, and
lam so weary of it all. Still if you desire me to
tell it I shall do so with as good grace as I can
command, because I recognise that I had better con-
fide it to some newspaper which will publish it
without exaggeration and misrepresentation. I met
Deeming—Williams as you knew him Baron
Swanston as I know him for the first time on board
the steamer Adelaide, just after we left Melbourne,
on January 12. When the ship had got outside the
Heads there was the usual amount of sea-sickness.
I was myself somewhat affected, though not much,
and consequently one of the stewardesses compli-
mented me upon being a good sailor. In the
evening, when I was almost alone on the deck, a
gentleman came up to me and said, ‘ Are you ill ?
Can I fetch you anything ? ’ I told him I was not
ill, and that I needed nothing. He pressed me with
his offers of assistance ; but I declined them all, and
after a short conversation he left me. Next day he
met me on the deck, and was again solicitious about
my health, and desirous of doing me a favour in
some way or other. Later on he asked if I played
whist, and when I told him I did he went away and
got a couple of gentlemen, who, with us two, made
a four-handed game. We played for a while, and
afterwards had a few words of conversation. Next

day, the 14th, we reached Sydney, and on the way
up the harbour he lent me a powerful pair of marine
glasses, which enabled me to see the full beauty of
the harbour scenery. As we were nearing the pier
I went up to him and said, 1 Well, Mr. Swanston, I
shall say good-bye to you now, and thank you for
your kindness to me"on board. I may not have an
«/ a t/
opportunity later, because of the rush there is bound
to be made for the luggage.’ He said, ‘ Oh, don’t
say good-bye yet, Miss Rounsefell. Let me help
you with your luggage to your hotel or to the
train.’ I said, ‘Very well, though lam afraid you
are troubling yourself too much.” He answered,
‘Not at all.’ We began discussing our destination,
and when I told him I was o-oinef to Bathurst he
o o
said he would go that far with me, as he had deter-
mined to go some distance further along the same
line. ‘ You know,’ he continued, ‘lam an engineer.
I have just come to the colony, and am desirous of
getting employment as soon as possible. I think
there should be a chance of employment in one of
the New South Wales mining townships.’ Then he
proposed that I should marry him. I thought he
was joking, and said ‘ No ! I couldn’t think of it. I
don’t know much about you, and cannot say I like
even what Ido know.’ When the ship arrived we were
too late to catch the morning train to Bathurst, so
I had before me a late night train journey or a night
in Sydney. Mr Swanston took my luggage and his
own to the railway station parcels office, and then we
dined at the Wentworth Hotel. After dinner he sug-
gested that we should go to Coogee. I consented.

gested that we should go to Coogee. I consented.
On the way he appeared to be very familiar with


the streets of the city, and I told him that for a
stranger he certainly did contrive to learn his way
about the place quickly. He answered that he had
been in Sydney four or five years before, and now
found the city so little altered that he had no
difficulty in finding his way in and around it. When
we ofot to Cooofee, and were seated on the rocks, he
O O 7
renewed the subject of marriage. He told me I was
young and attractive, and had quite fascinated him.
He said if I would consent to become his wife I
should never regret it, but would always congratulate
myself upon having entered into matrimony with
him. I told him I couldn’t think of marrying a
stranger whom Hhad only known several days. He
persisted and said, ‘ I have had my loves before, but
they were nothing in intensity to the passion I have
for you.’ He became so earnest in his expressions
of affection that I said, in order to put him off,
‘ Well, lam going to live with my sister. Wait till
I see her and ask her opinion on the subject.’ That
satisfied him, and during the rest of the day, which
we spent at the Aquarium, he seemed as happy as
possible. At the Aquarium he asked me if I would
wear a ring as a keepsake and to remind me of him.
I had previously refused to accept a ring from him
as a present, but seeing now that he was in earnest
about his proposition of marriage I consented to
take the ring. The one he gave me was set with
diamonds and sapphires. That night I was too ill
and too tired to go on by the train, so I stopped
at the Wentworth Hotel, and Swanston, I under-
stand, stopped there too, though he left me

going to the Grand Hotel, or one of the coffee
palaces. Next morning we started for Bathurst.
During the journey he was most attentive to me,
and at Mount Victoria, the refreshment station, he
got me something to eat and to drink, fetching it
to the carriage himself. When we reached Bathurst
he saw me safely to my sister’s place, and then
went and booked a room at Hurley’s Royal Hotel.
The same afternoon (January 15) he called to see
me, but I declined to give him an interview. He
sent several messages round to inquire after my
health during the day and evening, and early next
morning came in person. I had a long chat with
him, and so had my sister ; and after he had gone
my sister said to me, ‘ If you are going to settle
down, I don’t see any objection to you marrying
Mr. Swanston. He looks like a respectable man,
and should be able to give you a comfortable
home.’ Next day he took me for a drive, and
again, and in more earnest tones than he had yet
used, he implored me to be his wife. At last I
was worn down by his persevering nature, and I
consented to marry him. He asked me if I should
care to settle down in Sydney, and I told him I
would not like to do that, as I was prejudiced
against the city. He suggested several other
localities inland in New South Wales, but I had
objections to offer to them all, and at last he
turned to me and said, ‘ Where shall 1 go then ?
I replied, ‘Why not try West Australia. It is a
new colony, and is said to be a go-ahead place,
where an energetic and skilled man has a chance
to rise quickly.’ He caught at the idea readily,

and on Monday morning (18th) he went to Sydney
to make arrangements for his passage. While there
he wrote me a letter full of loving messages and assur-
O O
ances of a happy future, and sent me also a silver-
mounted riding-whip, with the remark, ‘ I remember
you said you would probably have some riding exer-
cise, so I send you my whip.’ I had almost forgotten,
in my anxiety to get through my story, that before
he left he gave me two other rings, a large five-
stone diamond ring, and a boat-shaped diamond
ring, and also an opal brooch set in gold. I remarked
that it was curious that he should have these ring's
O
in his possession, and his answer was that he had
courted a young lady in England and had bought
the rings to present to her, when one night, as he
was taking her into the box of one of the theatres,
a gentleman tapped him on the shoulder and said,
‘ I trust you do not forget that is my wife you are
escorting.’ He was so astounded at the woman’s
duplicity that he left her standing at the entrance,
and walked away with the intention of renouncing
her and the sex. After this little reminiscence he
said that he had a lot of clothes which had belonged
to his dead sister, and if I liked I might have them.
I told him that I could not wear the clothes of a
dead woman, even if I could overcome my objection
—which I did not think possible—to taking gifts of
clothing from any man not my husband.

me from Melbourne, telling me that he was going
to West Australia by the steamer Albany, which
was to leave on the next day. I got another letter


from Adelaide, one from Freemantle, and another
one from the Shamrock Hotel, Perth, under date
February 6. In this letter he enclosed the copy of
an advertisement clipped from one of the papers,
which called for applications from engineers desiring
employment, by the Fraser’s Mining Company,
Southern Cross, Yilgarn Goldfields, He told me
that he had applied for the position, and that, as his
application had been accepted, I might join him at
once, as I had agreed to do before he left Bathurst.
He asked me to reply by telegram, for which he
paid. I excused myself on the score of illness, and,
m answer to a further telegram urging me to go, I
declined on account of unpreparedness. Then he
sent me £2O through the Commercial Bank, Sydney,
for my travelling expenses, and prayed me to go
over to him as soon as I possibly could. I got my
trousseau ready, and then on Thursday last, in
answer to a wire from him, ‘ Come at once or the
rains will set in and travelling will be impossible.’
I answered, ‘Coming by the R.M.S. Oceana.’ I
left Bathurst the same day, and arrived in Mel
bourne at a quarter to 10 o’clock on the night
of Friday. On the journey over I read of
the Windsor murder for the first time. Of
course, I had heard that there had been a murder,
but I didn’t care to read about it, and there-
fore I knew none of the particulars. In the
train, however, a gentleman had a copy of The
Australasian , which he permitted me to read, and 1

to the Federal Coffee Palace. There I found
awaiting me a telegram from my sister— ‘ For God’s
sake go no further.’ I showed it to my friend, and
he wired asking to know the reason. Xaturally I was
much distressed, and was unable to sit down or rest.

the crowded streets, that I might (ret some little

distraction for my thoughts. Presently we noticed
a crowd in front of a newspaper office, and, inquiring
the reason, were informed that Williams, the
murderer, had been arrested. I felt strangely
moved, and I asked my companion to buy a paper.
He did so, and read— ‘ Williams, alias Swanston,
arrested at Southern Cross.’ I knew then the
meaning of the telegram from my sister, and, over-
come with a nameless terror, I fainted. When I
recovered I was at the Federal Coffee Palace, and
Detectives Cawsey and Considine were there to

had little difficulty in satisfying them of my utter

proposed marriage. It was not in the man’s
manner—that was in every way unblameable, except,
perhaps, on the score of being too kind. I cannot
say what it was, but I ‘ felt ’ there was something
wrong.”
Miss Rounsefell did not say, because modesty
prevented her, that her letters or telegrams from
Williams, or Swanston, were those of the most
ardent lover—frequent and fulsome. He addressed
her “My dear Topsy ” as a rule, with “My dear
Kitty ” occasionally, and invariably wound up with
“Your own Baron.” His letters were stamped on
the left-hand top corner with an embossed stamp
“From B. Swanston,” followed by the name of the

Miss Rounsefell is barely 20 years of age, and is
a nice, refined-looking young woman. She came

CHAPTER XII.
RETRIBUTION
“ For I knew my secret then was one that earth refused to keep,
Or land or sea—though he should be ten thousand fathoms deep !
So wills the avenging sprite, till blood for blood atones.”
LOVE-MAKING affairs having reached this
satisfactory stage, Deeming started forth to
exploit West Australia, which was the only one of
the Australian colonies that he had not previously
favoured with his attention. The instinct or neces-
sity which jlrove Deeming to take this step was
the turning point of his diabolical luck. The rem-
nants of the old convict system still linger in the
western colony, and every stranger that arrives is
submitted to close but unobtrusive espionage by the
police, who note down in a record book, kept for
that purpose, a minute description of each new
arrival, and any details that can be quietly ascer-
tained of his projected movements. Deeming’s
presumption and love of notoriety did not allow him
to hide his light under a bushel, and he blazed a
track in this scarcely populated community which
was easily followed. The Melbourne detectives
being thoroughly cognisant of these facts knew
when they traced the murderer to West Australia
that his arrest could only be a question of a few
days, if not hours. But this is slightly anticipating
the narrative.

After leaving Miss Bounsefell at Bathurst with
assurances of his deep and eternal affection for her,
he returned to Sydney, where, in the event of any-
thing serious transpiring, he took steps to cover his
tracks. He booked a passage in one of the mail
steamers, and at the same time secured, by tele-
graph, a passage in the steamer Albany from
Melbourne to West Australia. Needless to say
he did not go by the mail steamer, but made his
way by train to Melbourne, and there joined the
Albany. He made his entree in characteristic
fashion at tea that night, He told the captain and
the purser, both of whom were at the table, that
the boat was not fit to carry dogs. The purser
replied satirically that they were accustomed to
chain some of their passengers up by the necks,
and Deeming, highly incensed at this answer, got
up and stormed out of the cabin in a terrible rage.
From that time he cherished a grievance against
o o
the captain and the purser, and when Adelaide was
reached he promptly visited the police station and
reported that on the voyage from Melbourne his
dressing-case, containing valuables worth £l3O, had
been stolen from his cabin. He also jdaced the
matter in the hands of an Adelaide solicitor, with
instructions to proceed against the owners of the
steamer for damages. The detectives, after making

Deeming met on board the steamer a Miss Maud
Branch, who, in company with her uncle and aunt,
Mr. and Mrs. Wakeley, was on a voyage to West
Australia. To this lady Deeming attempted to pay
his addresses, but she quickly referred him to the
relatives with whom she was travelling, and Deeming
attempted to ingratiate himself with Mr. Wakeley.
He told Mr. Wakeley of the loss of his travelling
bag, and stated that portion of the stolen property
had been discovered in an Adelaide pawnshop, and
that both the captain and the purser were to be
arrested as soon as the vessel reached port. Mr.
Wakeley pointed out that Deeming would be com-
pelled to return to Adelaide to prosecute, but the
latter met this assertion that his lawyer would
identify the goods and prosecute.
“But how,” said Mr. Wakeley, “is your lawyer
to identify goods which he has never seen ? ”
Deeming, in default of any explanation, turned
on his heels and walked away, and the subject was
religiously tabooded thereafter. During all this
time Deeming persisted in his courteous attentions
to Miss Branch, and at last, when his conduct com-
menced to be remarked upon by the passengers,
Mrs. Wakeley warned her husband that she
suspected Deeming to be an adventurer. She also
gave her niece a hint to the same effect, and as a
consequence the whole party were somewhat distant
to Deeming. With the object of breaking down
this very apparent reserve, he took every opportu-
nity of thrusting his acquaintance on Mr. Wakeley,
and of posing as a man of position and wealth.
Among other statements he mentioned that he had

identify the goods and prosecute.
“But how,” said Mr. Wakeley, “is your lawyer
to identify goods which he has never seen ? ”
Deeming, in default of any explanation, turned
on his heels and walked away, and the subject was
religiously tabooded thereafter. During all this
time Deeming persisted in his courteous attentions
to Miss Branch, and at last, when his conduct com-
menced to be remarked upon by the passengers,
Mrs. Wakeley warned her husband that she
suspected Deeming to be an adventurer. She also
gave her niece a hint to the same effect, and as a
consequence the whole party were somewhat distant
to Deeming. With the object of breaking down
this very apparent reserve, he took every opportu-
nity of thrusting his acquaintance on Mr. Wakeley,
and of posing as a man of position and wealth.
Among other statements he mentioned that he had


just concluded a large contract for an English
engineering firm ; that the contract price was two
and a-half millions, and that he had been able to
clear half-a-million of profit for his employers. The
firm, he said, had offered him the highest position,
but, unfortunately, business affairs in West Aus-
tralia had compelled him to close his connection
with them. Mr. Wakeley replied that if the state-
ments were true the firm would certainly not have
allowed themselves to lose Swanston’s services, but
would have given him two years’ leave of absence
and the position of travelling representative in the
colonies. This sort of thing was continued through-
out the voyage, Deeming continually boasting of
his wealth and position,-and Mr. Wakeley treating
him with scarcely concealed sarcasm.
Finally, just before reaching Albany, Deeming
approached Mr. Wakeley with a definite proposal
for Miss Branch’s hand. He was, he said, a single
' 7 O
man, with plenty of money and anxious to settle
down. Hitherto he had been strange and reserved
with the opposite sex, but he had come to the con-
clusion that Miss Branch was a girl who would
make him thoroughly happy. Mr. Wakeley scouted
the proposal, and told Deeming in unmistakeable
terms that he did not believe his stories, and that he
was not in the habit of allowing men of his class to
enter their family circle. This event would have
squelched a man with any susceptibility, but
Deeming was irrepressible, and at Albany he again
approached the party and asked that he might be
allowed to escort Miss Branch ashore and take her
for a drive. The request was indignantly refused,

and at Freeman tie the travellers separated. The
last circumstance of Deeming’s connection with the
Wakeleys was a letter addressed from Southern
Cross, in which he merely inquired after her health
and expressed a hope of seeing her again.
Arrived at Perth, Deeming immediately set
about to find something to do. As a first step he
inserted the following advertisement in the local
paper :
XT7~ANTED, by a thoroughly Practical Engineer, with
' ' 14 years’ testimonials, who understands all
classes of machinery, including brewing, mining, and
electric, well up in municipal work, an engagement as
Manager or Foreman in any of the above, or Mining
Engineer. Apply, by letter or otherwise, “Baron,”
at the office of this paper,
The only reply he received to this advertisement
was from the Fraser’s Gold Mining Company, at
Southern Cross, a new goldfield, about 200 miles
interior from Perth. The Company asked that the
advertiser should forward his testimonials, and
Deeming, to be quite certain that these should be
entirely satisfactory, had drawn them out himself,
and had them engrossed in old English text at
Messrs. Fergusson and Mitchell’s establishment in
Melbourne, The supposed signatures were not
written, but printed with india-rubber stamps, and
it is astonishing that sane business men should have
accepted them for a single instant. None the less
this paltry deception proved sufficient, and Deeming
was engaged at a salary of £6 per week as engineer
to the mine.

tive to Miss Branch on the voyage round to Perth,

Though Deeming had been objectionally atten-

he had by no means forgotten Miss Rounsefell. At
each port of call he despatched a telegram to her in
the most affectionate terms, and wrote equally
perfervid letters as often as an opportunity for
sending them occurred The last letter sent to Miss
Rounsefell from Swanston was a remarkable one,
and for several reasons may aptly be quoted. It is
dated the Bth of February, 1892, and in the left
hand top corner, imprinted by a rubber stamp, are
the words, “ From B. Swanston, M.M.S., Southern
Cross, Yilgarn Goldfields, W. Australia.” It urged
“My dear Kitty ” to lose no time in leaving
Bathurst to voyage to West Australia, and said :
“ Don’t keep me waiting, dear. If you love me half as much
as I love you, you would not keep me waiting a day. As we are to
be man and wife, dear, why not let it be at once. I have
written to your brother at Broken Hill, informing him of our
approaching marriage, and I have got everything in readiness
here, so do come quickly, dear. The appointment I have got
gives me £6 a week for the first six months, and thereafter
<£B 10s. a week ; and, in addition, I have a house rent free, and
should he able to earn £3 a week extra. I do not intend to stay

that we may take a trip to England, so that you may look

wire if you can come at once. lam longing to hear from you.
Send me your photo. I feel very lonely here, and that would be

the cost, &c., of the journey, and the letter wound
up —“Your own loving Baron. God bless you.

The method by which he hoped to increase his
salary by at least fifty per cent, has not been made


dear, but the fact that the returns from the Frasers
Gold Mining Company fell off to a very large extent
during the fortnight that Deeming was engineer,
and that they have since resumed their former
average, suggests an excellent explanation. Deeming
at any rate established for himself during his brief
stay in Southern Cross the reputation of being an
excellent engineer, and by his decorous conduct
made many friends who could not at first believe him
guilty of the terrible crime for which he was
arrested.
As soon as he secured the appointment he com-
menced the preparations for his marriage with Miss
Rounsefell, and busied himself in constructing a
house in which to receive his bride. There is a
gruesome significance in the circumstance that his
fiist pin chase of building materials was a barrel of
cement, > and that he would allow no one to have a
hand in the building of the fireplaces except himself.
Tfe also ordered the floor of the main room to be
cemented, and personally supervised the work. All
the fittings and nick-nacks about the place were put
up by Deeming himself, and the building was very
near completion when the constables rode up to
arrest him. Deeming was standing outside the
house, and had just received some papers by the
mail. In one of these there was a brief telegram
conveying the announcement that a woman’s body
had been discovered buried in cement beneath a
hearthstone in a house in Windsor. Thus at the

refused to keep his awful secret the constables laid


their hands upon him and arrested him for the
murder.
Deeming was staggered for a moment, but
quickly regaining his composure, he pointed to the
telegram in the paper in his hand, and said “ Is this
the murder lam accused of ?’” No reply was given
him, and presently he continued, “ I think I know
the party who has been murdered. She was such
a good little thing, I can’t believe anyone could hurt
her.”
“ There is always some motive,” one of the con-
stables said. “ Perhaps she was murdered for her
money.”
“ The girl I knew had no money at all,” he
answered, and then it seemed to flash upon him that
he had been recklessly incriminating himself, so he
changed his tactics. He denied that he had ever
passed under the alias of Williams, declared that he
had never been in Windsor in his life, and that he
knew nothing about the suburbs of Melbourne.
Above all things he protested his innocence, and
called upon Heaven to witness the injustice that
was being done him. In the lock-up at Southern
Cross he repeated his protestations, and fretted so
constantly that at last he thoroughly wore himself
out, and fell in a faint which lasted several hours.
“ Don’t worry,” said the lock-up keeper to him
when he commenced to revive. “ Many innocent
men have been arrested before now, but it did not
take them long to prove away the charge, and so it
will be in your case if things are as you say,”
Deeming replied that it was not for himself that
he was fretting, but for the poor girl he was about


their hands upon him and arrested him for the
murder.

to be allowed to send some message to stop her on
her journey, that at last the constables agreed to
send her a telegram, and Deeming wrote the
following message :

office, Melbourne.
Do not come. Go home. I am.leaving here to-morrow.

CHAPTER XIII.
THE JOURNEY WESTWARD.
“ Past all shame—so past all truth.”
0N Monday, March the 14th, Deeming, in the
custody of two constables, left Southern Cross
for York, a distance of 160 miles. A special coach
was chartered for the journey, which was taken by
easy stages. They travelled only during the day-
time, and when a halt was called and the camp
pitched for the night, the constables took watches
in guarding the prisoner, who was kept handcuffed
all the time. He ate little and slept little, and on
the way fainted twice. In spite of this, however,
he maintained a cheerful appearance and
spoke confidently of his ability to prove his
innocence. He often spoke about the charge, and
tried to get some further details of the crime,
but as the arresting constables knew nothing beyond
the fact that they were instructed to arrest him on
a charge'of murder, they were unable to enlighten
him, and he then entertained them with a long
sermon on womankind. Just at this time a good

was severe enough for such a scoundrel. He also
spoke in scathing terms against the wickedness of
allowing girls of tender years to marry, and main-

himself a wife under 20 years of age.
-A-t \ ork he was astonished to find a large crowd
awaiting his arrival, and the groans with which he
was greeted increased his nervousness, but did not
deprive him of his self-possession. Turning to them,
he addressed them briefly, asserting that he was an
innocent man, and would soon return to them with
his character cleared of this vile accusation. At
each of the stations on the railway journey to
Perth similar crowds were encountered, and at one
place, where women largely predominated on the
platform, he took off his hat in a most gallant
and said, “ Good-bye, ladies ; I hope soon to see you
all again. At Perth so much excitement pre-
vailed over his expected arrival that business was
practically suspended in the town, and the police
had to adopt a ruse to get him to the gaol. Here
he reiterated his protestations of innocence,

in the Kaiser Wilhelm 11. Then, to shield

woman whom he had so foully murdered. After
his arrival in Melbourne he and his wife, he ex-

Hedge was in Perth, and he was unexpectedly
ushered into the cell which Deeming occupied. The
murderer was engaged in a game of draughts with
another prisoner, and had his back to the door, so
that he did not see Mr. Hedge when he came in.
As soon as he entered the cell Mr, Hedge called out,
“Hello, Deeming, you haven’t altered much.” On
hearing these words Deeming turned slowly round
and raised his head, as though collecting his
7 O O
faculties. He then lifted his eyes to the face of his
visitor, and as he recognised him made a convulsive
grasp at the edge of the table at which he was
sitting. Recovering his calmness in an instant, he
gazed steadily before him without giving utterance
to a syllable. The last link in the chain of testi-
mony had been clinched.

days. The Melbourne Detective Department had
had previous painful experiences of this profes-
sional gentleman’s subtleties in law, and had pro-
vided Detective Cawsey with two forms of warrant,
and when objection was taken to the first the
second was promptly put into execution. Deeming’s-
last appearance in the Perth Police Court resulted
in an extraordinary scene. The building, which


The identifiction was rapidly and successfully
completed. Deeming was ranged up in the gaol
yard with live or six other prisoners. He was in
his shirt sleeves, and wore a broad-brimmed soft felt
hat. Owing to the idle chattering of some of his
attendants he had ascertained that Mr. Hirschfeldt
was in Perth, and at the last moment took oft* his
spectacles. When Detective Cawsey and Mr.
Hirschfeldt came into the yard Cawsey said, “ Do
you see anyone here whom you know ? ” Mr.
Hirschfeldt replied “ Yes,” and pointed out the
prisoner. “ What is his name ? ” asked the detec-
tive, and the answer “ Williams ” came promptly
from Mr. Hirschfeldt. Nothing could better illus-
trate the natural force of Deeming’s character than
the coolness with which he passed through this
ordeal. He stared Mr. Hirschfeldt full in the face,
and when that gentleman replied to the second
question of the detective, a slight sarcastic smile
played on Deeming’s face. Though able to main-
tain his composure, the mental strain had told upon
his physical capabilities, for Mr. Hirschfeldt asserted
that he must have lost nearly three stone in weight
since he left the Kaiser Wilhelm 11. From the
various articles found in Deeming’s possession there
was no moral doubt of his identity, but legal proof
was still needed, and this was forthcoming. Mr. R.
W. Hedge, engineer of the Union Co.’s Foundry
Works, Freemantle, had worked with Deemino- in
Sydney in 1886, and he came to Perth to see the
prisoner. He had met Deeming on his arrival at

weeks before his arrest, but Deeming at that time


CHAPTER XIV.
EXTRADITION.
“ It is the masterpiece of villainy
To smooth the brow and to outface suspicion.”
DIRECTLY the police authorities in Melbourne
were apprised of Deeming’s arrest, they des-
patched Detective Cawsey to West Australia. He
was armed with the necessary documents for the
murderer’s extradition, and was accompanied by Mr.
Max Hirschfeldt, who had come out with Deeming
and his Windsor victim in the Kaiser William 11.,
and was, therefore, competent to give the evidence
as to identification which the formalities of the law
demand. The detective and his companion reached
Perth within a few days after Deeming’s arrival in
that city, but in the meantime the prisoner had not
been inactive. He secured the services of the most
able criminal lawyer in Perth, and under the pretence
of failing eyesight provided himself with a pair of
gold-rimmed eye-glasses, with the object of partially
disguising himself. He was not aware at this time
that one of his fellow-passengers w T as coming over
to identify him, and he hoped that if the police were
merely relying upon the photographs in their
possession to guide them the spectacles might prove
a stumbling block, and give him a short respite in
which to frame some scheme for escaping the dire
penalty of his crimes.


he obtained by fraudulent pretence from the Mel-
bourne jewellers, and the other, worth about £25,
he purchased “on approbation ” from a friend
and forgot to pay for.
A silver pocket flask, with the monogram
“ F.8.D., identifies him as F. Duncan, who stopped
at the Cathedral Hotel, Swanston-street, between
the 30th of December and the 12th of January,
and wrote to Holt’s Matrimonial Agency for a
wife on the 2nd of January, and it also carries
him forward to the journey to Bathurst, where he
passed as Swanston, on the 16th of January.
A parchment testimonial, dated September 21,
1891, signed Benjamin Goodfellow, Hyde, Hamp-
shire, and addressed to Baron Swanston, heralds
the last stage in the identification by the mis-
cellaneous articles of luggage. This testimonial
he had engrossed in Melbourne for the purpose of
use in West Australia, and it is known that upon
it, more than anything else, he obtained the situa-
tion in Southern Cross.
From the “ F.8.D.” of Frederick Bailey Deeming
on the Sydney photographs through the various
changes from Deeming to Williams, Lawson,
Williams, Dawson, Duncan, and Swanston, it is
easy to trace the man. And lastly, a very im-
portant piece of evidence, because it assisted to
unite the whole chain, was an envelope addressed
by rubber stamp to “ Miss K. Bounsefell, Cambria-
terrace, Havannah-street, Bathurst, New South
Wales.”


The identifiction was rapidly and successfully
completed. Deeming was ranged up in the gaol
yard with live or six other prisoners. He was in
his shirt sleeves, and wore a broad-brimmed soft felt
hat. Owing to the idle chattering of some of his
attendants he had ascertained that Mr. Hirschfeldt
was in Perth, and at the last moment took oft* his
spectacles. When Detective Cawsey and Mr.
Hirschfeldt came into the yard Cawsey said, “ Do
you see anyone here whom you know ? ” Mr.
Hirschfeldt replied “ Yes,” and pointed out the
prisoner. “ What is his name ? ” asked the detec-
tive, and the answer “ Williams ” came promptly
from Mr. Hirschfeldt. Nothing could better illus-
trate the natural force of Deeming’s character than
the coolness with which he passed through this
ordeal. He stared Mr. Hirschfeldt full in the face,
and when that gentleman replied to the second
question of the detective, a slight sarcastic smile
played on Deeming’s face. Though able to main-
tain his composure, the mental strain had told upon
his physical capabilities, for Mr. Hirschfeldt asserted
that he must have lost nearly three stone in weight

was no moral doubt of his identity, but legal proof
was still needed, and this was forthcoming. Mr. R.

Sydney in 1886, and he came to Perth to see the

remarkable. At each country station the platform
was crowded with men, women, and children, who
struggled to get a view of the prisoner, and assailed
him with loud cries of ‘ Murderer,’ ‘ Jack the
Ripper,’ and so on. At first the prisoner met
these attacks with unmoved composure, but their
constant repetition soon told on his nerves. At
the station before York he called out nervously,
‘ Stand in front of me. Don’t let them see me ’ ;
and afterwards he said, ‘ That’s Western Australia
all over. They might wait till a man’s proved
guilty.’ So far the crowd had been sarcastic
rather than violent. It was not until York was
reached that their attitude changed. The whole of
the population for miles around seemed to have
gathered on the platform, and long before the train
drew up yells and execrations could be heard. The
shutters of the carriages were drawn up, but these
were of the flimsiest construction, and the police
officers tried to conceal the prisoner by standing
around him. Before the train stopped the foot-
boards of the carriage on both sides were stormed,
and dozens of hands were busy at every window
trying to tear down the shutter, while those inside
tried to resist the pressure. Every moment one of
the shutters would fall with a crash, and there
would be a momentary free-fight before it could be
raised again. All the time the people were yelling
out ‘ Lynch him,’ ‘ Murderer,’ ‘ Coward,’ ‘ You can
only kill women,’ A respectable-looking woman on
the platform shrieked through the window, * Drag
him out; put him on a pole. There’s only a few of

at not seeing’ Deeming. Most of the sightseers
took tickets to Guildford, so that little was gained
by the police manoeuvres. Deeming made his ap-
pearance smoking a cigar, and wearing the same
cynical smile which has distinguished his public
apearances since he was arrested. For a few
moments before the carriage started he leaned back
easily against the seat, quietly puffing his cigar and
watching with an aparently amused interest the
crowd who peered in through the windows. It was
noticeable that he took great precautions to hide his
handcuffs, and seized the first opportunity of hinting
that they should be taken off. Detective Cawsey
was showing a new style of American handcuff, and
Deeming remarked, 4 I don’t see the use of those
things unless a man’s obstropulous. They did not
handcuff me on the way down from Southern Cross.’
The subject was quietly dropped, much to Deem-
ing’s irritation. Presently he drew a book from his
pocket, and asked for his spectacles. There was a
search made, and it was found that the spectacles
had been left behind. Deeming was greatly
annoyed, and he favoured Detective Cawsey with
an exceedingly unpleasant scowl, and muttered to
himself once or twice, 4 That’s done for a purpose.’
Not long afterwards he complained of a headache.
Mr. Hirschfeldt offered him a bottle of smelling-
salts, which Deeming ungraciously refused. 4 It’s
no use,’he said pettishly, 4 The pains are in the
back of my head. The Kaffirs smashed my brains,
and I have not been right since.’
O


The escort with the prisoner left Perth for
Albany on Friday afternoon, March 25th. The
completion of the extradition is thus described by
a special representative of the Melbourne Argus
who formed one of the party ; The mail train
was timed to leave the Central station at 1 o’clock,
but in order to avoid the crowd the prisoner was
driven to Guildford, some miles outside Perth.
Before his departure in the morning Deeming made
another of his ingenious attempts to render his
identification difficult. A photographer made an
application to be allowed to take his portrait, and
Deeming, after a good deal of hesitation, determined
to grant the request. He applied, therefore, for
permission to shave, and a barber was sent for.
His first act was to direct the barber to shave off
his moustache, and the plan would doubtless have
succeeded had not the barber, with the garrulity of
his profession, called out—‘What, take off your
moustache I ’ and thus attracted the attention of
the lock-up keeper. After this it was judged wiser
not to let Deeming be shaved at all, and as a conse-
quence he commenced the journey with a three
days’ growth of beard, which greatly intensified
his haggard and unkempt appearance.
“At about 11 o’clock Detective Cawsey, with
whom were Inspector Waldock and Sergeant
Farley, of the West Australian police, got quietly
away from Perth almost unobserved, and drove to
Guildford. The other members of the party, Mr.
Max Hirschfeldt, Constable Williams, and The
Argus special representative, left at 1 o’clock from
the Central station. A laro’e crowd assembled to

:is very small and inconvenient, was crowded to
suffocation. The most striking feature of the pio-
ceedings was the unusual number of Justices of
Peace on the Bench, no less than 30 being present.
The accommodation on the Bench was altogether
inadequate, and, though some stood two deep
against the wall, there were others still to be
provided for, and, after much hustling and bustling,
they took up a position on the rail, and dangled
their legs from the edge of the platform. One of the
spectators described the sight as more closely
resembling the traditional American backwoods
trial than the decorous proceedings of an Australian
Court in a capital city. Deeming, when he entered
the Court-house, looked thinner, and occasionally
wore a haggard and hunted expression on his face.
As a rule, however, he kept his features well under
control and barely moved a muscle when looked at
until Mr. Hirschfeldt gave his evidence. Deeming’s
lace then settled into a scowl, and he scarcely
removed his eyes from the witness. He smiled
occasionally at what he considered points made
by his counsel. His chief betrayal of restlessness
■was when he caught anyone engaged in making a
sketch of his features, and to prevent them doing
this he frequently changed his position. Only a
short time was occupied in hearing the evidence.
The prisoner’s counsel endeavoured to raise objec-
tions to the new warrant, but on this occasion the
Magistrate overruled every point raised, and the
necessary forms were quickly signed ; and Deeming,
without further delay, was handed over to the
Victorian detectives.

“ This scene completely unnerved Deeming, who
lay back pale and biting his moustache, trying his
utmost to hide his face. The violence of the crowd
was constantly increasing, and presently one of the
shutters was smashed to pieces, giving the excited
crowd a full view of the prisoner. Only the ener-
getic action of Inspector Waldock saved the carriage
from being rushed, and a Hank charge of the police
dispersed the crowd on that side. Leaning out of
the window Waldock pointed out the man who had
broken the window. A local sergeant disappeared
among the crowd, and presently returned very
crestfallen. ‘ It’s no use, sir,’ he explained, ‘ ever-
one of the people will swear black and blue that you
broke it yourself.’ The yells and hootings increased
as the traid left the station, and a lusty fellow hung
to the foot-board for some distance, yelling out,
‘ Good-bye, old man. You’re going to get your neck
stretched.’ This was the worst episode of the
journey, although the scenes continued with little
variation along the route.
“ At Beverley, where there is a delay of lialf-
an-hour, and the carriages are changed, there was
another riotous scene, but the excellent arrange-
meats of the station-master prevented any inter-
ference with the prisoner, who was at once placed in
a private room in charge of two of the local police.
The crowd amused themselves with shouting,

broken the window. A local sergeant disappeared
among the crowd, and presently returned very
crestfallen. ‘ It’s no use, sir,’ he explained, ‘ ever-
one of the people will swear black and blue that you
broke it yourself.’ The yells and hootings increased
as the traid left the station, and a lusty fellow hung
to the foot-board for some distance, yelling out,
‘ Good-bye, old man. You’re going to get your neck
stretched.’ This was the worst episode of the
journey, although the scenes continued with little
variation along the route.
“ At Beverley, where there is a delay of lialf-
an-hour, and the carriages are changed, there was
another riotous scene, but the excellent arrange-
meats of the station-master prevented any inter-
ference with the prisoner, who was at once placed in
a private room in charge of two of the local police.
The crowd amused themselves with shouting,
O 7
‘ Give him some cement, the murderer.’ After
leaving Beverley the demonstrations at the stations
quickly ceased, but the prisoner was evidently very


nervous. He had been thoroughly frightened at
O »7 o
York, and the scene at Beverley had not tended to
calm him. He lay down at full length on the seat,
and dropped off into an uneasy sleep, which lasted
for about two hours. Suddenly he woke up with a
start, and asked for some water. There was none
in the carriage, but he was given a little brandy,
which he had no sooner swallowed than he fell
down in a faint. Fortunately the train just then
drew up at a siding, and a little water was pro-
cured at the roadside. For about a quarter of an
hour the efforts to rouse him were continued
without success. Then he was apparently seized
with a fit. The four men in the compartment threw
themselves upon him, but although his arms were
useless his struggles were so desperate that it was
hardly possible to hold him. The fit was succeeded
by a collapse, and then the seizure was renewed
constantly with such violence that the next hour
and a half of the journey was nothing but a con-
tinual struggle. When at 2 a.m. the train arrived
at Katanning, .Deeming completely collapsed, and
fell into a sleep which lasted until late in the
morning, when he woke up, to everybody’s astonish-
ment, without showing the slightest sign of
exhaustion. Looking l at his wrists, which were
badly swollen by his struggles with the handcuffs
he said, ‘ Hello, what’s this ? I must have been
doing something last night.’ Nobody answered,
and no one is able to tell whether the fits were
really genuine or not.
“ At Albany, which was reached at 8 o’clock on
Saturday morning, precautions were taken to avoid


nervous. He had been thoroughly frightened at
O »7 o
York, and the scene at Beverley had not tended to
calm him. He lay down at full length on the seat,

he said, ‘ Hello, what’s this ? I must have been
doing something last night.’ Nobody answered,
and no one is able to tell whether the fits were

“ At Albany, which was reached at 8 o’clock on
Saturday morning, precautions were taken to avoid


a disturbance, as a rumour had been circulated that
a plan existed to seize the accused and publicly
lynch him. Accordingly, before reaching the
terminus, the train drew up at the roadside opposite
the gaol, and Deeming was quickly placed under
lock and key. Certainly if the lynching rumour
really had any truth in it the crowd concealed its
feelings wonderfully well, for nobody either hooted
or groaned. In the gaol Deeming was again
searched and handcuffed, a proceeding to which he
strongly objected. He declared again that he was
perfectly innocent, and that there was no necessity
to handcuff him, because he had not the faintest
intention of trying to escape.”
The surmise that the fits were only pretence was
amply sustained on the Sunday morning when the
detectives visited the gaol at Albany in order to
make their preparations for embarkation on board
the K.M S. Ballarat, which was to convey them to
Adelaide. Detective Cawsey saw the prisoner in
his cell at 10 o’clock on Saturday night, and found
everything all right; but when the door was opened
at half-past five a.in., Deeming was clean shaved.
When questioned Deeming laughed, and said that
he wanted a shave badly. In some mysterious way
he had succeeded in obtaining a broken piece of
glass, with the. sharp edge of which he had
deliberately chopped off his moustache. The fit in
the carriage was only a ruse to be relieved of the
O «/
handcuffs which had hampered him ever since Ins
arrest at Southern Cross. The shaving of the

ably, so much so that he looked at least 20

also so much changed that his fellow-travellers
could scarcely believe that he was the same man.
He could not disguise his triumph at the success of
the manoeuvre, and his face wore a sardonic grin all
the way to the steamer. Prior to his departure
from Perth, Deeming penned the following epistle
to the Governor of the Gaol
Mr, Hyde, gaoler. Dear Shy—Before leaving Perth 1
feel it would be ungrateful on my part if I did not thank you for
the kind treatment which I have received from you while in your
charge; and as for the kindness of Mrs. Hyde, I am at a loss to
find words with which to thank her ; but as J know that my in-
nocence will carry me through my trial, and that I shall have
the opportunity of returning to Perth, I shall then show my
.gratitude in a way' that your kindness demands. I have also to
express my thanks for the kind way in which I have been treated
by all the police force. Believe me when I say that I shall
always remember your kindness to me in the great trouble which
i have had to go through—-a stranger in a strange land, with no
■one to say a word in my favor. Thanking you sincerely, I
remain, yours very grateful, Baron Swanston.

Melbourne, but the accommodation provided by the
P. and 0. Company made his transport by this
steamer much easier and safer than it could be by
