Some months ago it was announced from Canada that
the corrected draft of the Imperial Naturalisation Bill
had been approved by the Canadian Government. With
the settlement of the point which had been raised at
Ottawa the last technical obstacle appears to have been
removed from the path of a long-delayed reform, the
accomplishment of which would mark a further step
towards Imperial unity. What is still needed is only
that in Britain and each self-governing Dominion public
opinion should be moved to insist that the requisite
legislation, being non-contentious, shall not be postponed
to measures of party interest, but shall be introduced
and passed in each legislature without delay. As regards
Britain, promises to that effect have been publicly made
by a cabinet minister, Mr Herbert Samuel, both at home


and in Canada. In the following pages an attempt is
made to trace the history of the impending reform and
to explain its Imperial importance.
Naturalisation is the process whereby ? aliens ? who
settle in any part of the Empire may acquire the privi-
leges and responsibilities of natural-born British sub-
jects, i.e. persons who owe allegiance to the King by
virtue of their birth. The main anomaly to be rectified
is that, under present conditions, an alien naturalised in
any Dominion or Colony ceases to be a British subject
whenever he goes outside its territorial limits. He then
becomes a foreigner again, reverting to his original
nationality, unless he lost it under the laws of his father-
land by swearing allegiance elsewhere. If he is still
accorded the privileges of a British subject?e.g. by
being granted a passport from the Foreign Office for
purposes of travel abroad ?that is only by courtesy.
Strange to say, the same limitation perhaps applies
even to the status conferred by naturalisation in the
United Kingdom itself.* In recent years the practical
importance of the anomaly has been aggravated owing
to the greatly increased volume of foreign immigra-
tion into the Dominions, especially Canada. At the
Imperial Conference of 1911 Sir Wilfrid Laurier made
an eloquent plea for the principle, ?A British subject
anywhere a British subject everywhere.? He instanced
the case of the American settlers, who readily take
out naturalisation papers in Canada, only to find that
when they come to Europe they are no longer British
subjects, but foreigners again. f The same applies to
* The following considerations suggest that naturalisation in the
United Kingdom has no effect outside its borders: (1) In a circular dis-
patch of September 10, 1874, the Colonial Secretary informed the Colonial
Governments that, as he was advised, ?a certificate of naturalisation
granted under the authority of the Acts of 1844 or 1870 confers upon an
alien no rights or privileges in a British Colony.? (2) The Committee of
1899 state that the authorities are divided in opinion as to whether
section 7 of the Act of 1870 confers upon an alien naturalised in the
United Kingdom ?the status of a British subject outside the United
Kingdom either in a foreign country or in a British Colony.? (Cd. 723,
pp. 9-10.) (3) The argument of the Canadian Minister of Justice, sum-
marised below, p. 21.
f Mr Keith remarks (p. 1323), ? A man who is naturalised in a British
Colony may be a minister of the Crown there, but becomes when he goes
outside the territory a foreigner.?


settlers of any foreign nationality in any of the
Dominions. Sir Wilfrid Laurier?s statement of the
position was afterwards disputed, but in the opinions
collected for Mr Sargant by the editor of ?United
Empire? the weight of authority seems to uphold it.
The Naturalisation Act of 1870 is still the principal
law.* It recognised the right of the colonies to regulate
naturalisation within the limits of their own territories,
following in that regard an earlier Act passed in
1847. But it made no provision for securing that
an alien duly naturalised in a colony should pass as a
British subject throughout the Empire at least.
To understand precisely the nature of the existing
difficulty and the scope of the impending reform, one
must start with a clear idea as to what actually are the
privileges and responsibilities which aliens acquire by
naturalisation. Popular misconception, confusing subject-
hood with citizenship, has been one of the main obstacles
in the path of reform.
The rights or privileges of a British subject appear
to be principally the following :
(1) first and foremost, the right to invoke anywhere
the protection of the Crown against personal oppression,
especially in a foreign country; 4
(2) the right to sue or be tried by British law in
those foreign countries where Consular Courts have been
established under the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890 ;
(3) the right to be married in foreign countries under
the provisions of the Foreign Marriages Act, 1892 ;
(4) the right to have an owner?s interest in a British
ship. Formerly there were restrictions on the liberty
of aliens to acquire and hold property generally, but in
the main these have long since been removed except as
regards the ownership of ships.
The responsibilities or liabilities of a British subject
consist principally in whatever may be implied in the
oath taken by an alien, on naturalisation, that he or she
4 will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the Sovereign.?
In addition, there is the liability to be sued in the Consular
courts in foreign countries; to be brought to trial in
* The 1870 law was based on the report of a Royal Commission which
sat in 1869. There were subsequent Acts in 1872 and 1895.


British courts for treason, murder, bigamy, or certain
?other offences committed in a foreign country ; and to
be extradited, if a refugee from justice, from countries
which have treaties with Britain for that purpose.
It is sometimes suggested that the status of British
subject carries with it ?political? rights. But that is
hardly correct. Nowhere in the Empire is there any
political privilege which a person can exercise by sole
virtue of being a British subject, whether natural-born
or naturalised. For example, a British subject cannot
vote in any election unless qualified under the local
electoral laws, which generally prescribe certain con-
ditions of residence at least, and which often exclude
females and always exclude minors?two important
classes of British subjects. In some parts of the Empire
there are also special restrictions which exclude persons
of non-European descent from voting or holding certain
public offices. Again, no British subject is free to migrate
from one part of the Empire to another unless he or she
can satisfy the requirements of the local immigration law.
In some parts there are laws requiring that every im-
migrant must show a clean bill of health, sometimes also
a clean social record, produce some financial guarantee,
or pass an education test. Confronted with such laws a
migrant British subject has no advantage within the
Empire over a migrant foreigner, except in so far as the
mere prestige of his status, or his right of appeal to
the Sovereign against oppression, may gain for a British
subject more respectful treatment than if he belonged to
some petty State. But, while it is true that British sub-
jecthood does not itself confer any political rights, it
is also generally true that no political rights can be
obtained without it. Thus the local laws in any part of
the Empire generally require that a person must be a
British subject as the first and main qualification for the
franchise or for holding any important public office. But
the local laws may prescribe further, as sometimes in
Australia and South Africa, that the applicant must be
a person of European descent. So, British subjecthood
does not carry any political right, but it is none the less
the most important among preliminary qualifications for
acquiring political rights.
For the sake of clearness it is well to avoid the popular


habit of using ?British citizen? and ?British subject? as
interchangeable expressions. We enjoy an advantage
over the Americans, who use only ? citizen,? in that we
are able and not ashamed to call ourselves subjects of
a King or Emperor, and can thus avoid the confusion
which arises when citizen and subject are used synony-
mously. According to Dr Westlake, a citizen is an
entity unknown to English law, except in the narrow
sense of the ? burgher of a municipal corporation which
enjoys the purely honorary rank of a city.? * There may
be a legal citizen of London or Bristol. But there is
none of Britain or Canada, still less of the Empire as
a single State. If in its conventional use ?citizen? is a
democratic term and implies a right of voting, there are
in practice citizens of the United Kingdom, or of Canada
or any other Dominion (though not of India, where the
form of government is non-elective). But there are still
no citizens of the Empire, because there is no common
government of the Empire in which all British subjects
may take part according to a common electoral law. If
we had Imperial Federation, the federal voters might
conventionally be called British or Britannic citizens.
Otherwise there can be no appropriate use for that
expression; unless, indeed, it might be applied to the
electors of the national parliaments in Britain and each
self-governing Dominion under some future system in
which each of those Governments would occupy a
sovereign and identical status in relation to matters
of foreign policy, defence, India, shipping, and other
matters of common concern for which at present a
superior responsibility is vested in the Government of
Great Britain.
In February 1899 aq inter-departmental committee
was appointed by Sir Matthew White Ridley, who was
then Home Secretary, to inquire into the ?doubts and
difficulties ? which had arisen as to the proper interpre-
tation and administration of the naturalisation laws,
and to suggest improvements. The report of this
Committee, which appeared in 1901, is an interesting
introduction to the whole question. Its matter falls
into two parts: first, the history and meaning of the
* ?British Citizenship,? p. 11.


status of a British subject; secondly, the law of
naturalisation. In their historical sketch they begin by
pointing out the ?fundamental difference between those
countries whose law is derived mainly from feudal
principles and those countries whose law comes more
directly from Roman sources; the former regarding the
place of birth as the determining factor in constituting
the relation of Sovereign and Subject, while the latter
look to the nationality of the parent and disregard (more
or less) the place of birth. Although the statute law of
most countries has introduced certain modifications of
each of these principles, the difference springing from the
original sources of the system of law still remains.?
From this difference of principle cases arise of what is
called ? double nationality,? when two Governments are
able to claim simultaneously the allegiance of the same
person. The Committee urged that efforts should be
made to conclude conventions with foreign countries with
a view to settling the nationality in such cases according
to definite rules.
In Britain the law of naturalisation has been partly
Common Law and partly Statute Law. ?To the Common
Law belongs the fundamental principle that any person
who is born within His Majesty?s dominions is from the
moment of his birth a British subject, whatever may be
the nationality of either or both of his parents, and
however temporary and casual the circumstances deter-
mining the locality of his birth may have been.? The
Common Law regarded the status thus acquired as
indelible. Its rule was, Nemo 'potest exuere patriam.
But that rule has been modified by modern legislation,
which has provided means for terminating in certain
cases the status of a British subject. The Committee
thought that the procedure might be improved. But
they did not recommend any extension of the principle,
feeling that ? evidence as to the place of birth affords in
most cases a simple and easy proof of British nationality
for which it would be difficult to find a satisfactory
substitute.?
Some apparent exceptions to the rule that British
nationality is determined by place of birth are not really
exceptions at all. The real principle is that all persons
born ?within the ligeance? of the Crown are British


subjects. Accordingly the child of a foreign invader,
born in the invader?s camp on British soil, would not be
a British subject. Nor would a foreigner?s child born in
the Embassy, which is regarded as part of the territory
of the foreign country. The only real exception seems
to be the case of the King?s son, who by Common Law
is recognised as a British subject wherever born. For
the rest, the acquisition of British subjecthood by virtue
of parentage rests on Statute law. ? A person whose
father or paternal grandfather was born within His
Majesty?s dominions? is deemed a natural-born British
subject, although he or she was born abroad. Feeling
that on this point the law was somewhat confusing, the
Committee recommended that no person born outside
the King?s dominions should be deemed a British
subject unless the father had been born within the
ligeance and was himself a British subject at the time
of the child?s birth. And, since some doubt existed as to
whether the law did or did not apply throughout the
King?s dominions, they recommended that, with the
suggested modification, it should be made of universal
application. The proposal that no progenitor more
remote than the father should be regarded in determining
what persons are British subjects by virtue of parentage,
was the principal reform suggested by the Committee in
respect of natural-born British subjects.
Another and minor difficulty is that it is not certain
what places come into the category of the King?s
dominions. The Committee thought that Protectorates
and Spheres of Influence ought to be excluded. But
a British ship should be included wherever it happens
to be ; and, they suggested, a person born on a foreign
ship should not be deemed a British subject merely
because the ship was in British waters at the time.
The other part of their inquiry, relating to the
admission of foreigners to British subjecthood, led
them to proposals of wider scope. The existing law is
itself comparatively modern, and remarkably liberal
compared with the condition of affairs which preceded
it. Prior to 1844 an alien could only acquire any of the
rights of a British subject in one of two ways. He
might get a special act of parliament passed for his
benefit; and acts of this kind used to be numerous both


in Britain and in the colonies. Or, he might get ? letters
of denization,? i.e. a certificate direct from the Sovereign,
who still retains the ancient prerogative of in this way-
creating British subjects at his own discretion. The
Committee did not quarrel with the survival of denization.
As regards the other method, however, they thought
that a further improvement in the existing law of
naturalisation should practically obviate occasion for
any further special acts of parliament, and prevent the
confusion which has been apt to arise through the
negligent drafting of these instruments.
The year 1844 witnessed the passage of an Act* intended
to facilitate the naturalisation of aliens by affording a
comparatively simple process, namely, the issue of a
certificate by the Secretary of State at his own discretion.
The applicant was required to submit a memorial stating
his age, profession, etc. In 1856 the Secretary of State
was advised that it would be lawful to require the alien
to declare his intention of residing and settling in some
part of the United Kingdom; and this advice was acted
upon. It may here be noted that the absolute discretion
of the Secretary of State (subject to any limiting con-
ditions that parliament may prescribe) is a principle
which the Committee of 1899 upheld.
The next important Act (1870) introduced changes
summarised in the Committee?s Report as follows :
? (1) Removal of the restrictions upon the acquisition and
holding of real and personal property by aliens in the United
Kingdom, except property in British ships.
? (2) Requirement, as a condition of a grant of a certificate
of naturalisation, of (prior) residence of five years in the
United Kingdom, or of service under the Crown for the same
period, and of intention of continuing so to reside or serve
after naturalisation.
? (3) Limitation of the principle that British nationality is
indelible (a) by permitting a natural-born British subject,
who also at his birth became a subject of a foreign State,
to divest himself of British nationality, (b) by making the
loss of British nationality a necessary and immediate con-
sequence of voluntary naturalisation in a foreign country.
? (4) Detailed provisions as to the effect of naturalisation
* Repealed by the Act of 1870.


or loss of nationality by the husband or father upon the
status of the wife and children.
? (5) Provisions for the readmission or renaturalisation of
a person who had lost his British nationality.?
The second of the above innovations has had the
effect of aggravating the Imperial anomaly of localised
naturalisation. An alien in process of qualifying for
British subjecthood by residence in the United Kingdom
or any Dominion cannot migrate to another part of the
Empire without losing, so to speak, the residence already
performed. He must begin all over again. And when,
having completed the required term of residence, he
applies for his certificate, he will disqualify himself at
once if he announces his intention of migrating to any
other part of the Empire instead of continuing to reside
in the country where he is applying.
In considering what further changes might now be
desirable, the Committee had regard to the reasons why
foreigners wish to be naturalised in the United Kingdom.
The incapacity of aliens to hold property, which used
to be the chief motive, had long since disappeared,
surviving only in respect of British ships. But an
alien remains incapable of being a member of the Privy
Council, or of either House of Parliament, or of holding
any municipal office, or of voting in any municipal or
parliamentary election, or of holding any office or place
of trust, civil or military. It is to overcome these dis-
qualifications that many of the applications are made.
Another frequent motive is when a parent desires
to enter his children for commissions in the army or
navy, or for the Civil Service examinations, which are
closed to aliens. In the, same way, Englishmen who
have become naturalised in a foreign country sometimes
wish for the sake of their children to revert to their
status as British subjects.
A less respectable motive is that of a foreigner who
seeks in ? double nationality ? a refuge from compulsory
military training in his own country while continuing
to reside there. But the Committee remark that the
belief prompting this manoeuvre is ?usually mistaken,?
because if the man still owes allegiance to his own
country, under its laws, a concurrent status as British


subject will not protect him in that country, however
it may protect him elsewhere.* Similarly it has often
happened that a foreigner has made the required
declaration of intention to reside in the United King-
dom without ever meaning to carry it out, simply in
order to acquire a document which he thinks may gain
respect for him in some foreign country. Having regard
to frauds of this kind the Committee recommended that
the Secretary of State should be given the power, which
he lacks at present, of subsequently revoking a certi-
ficate when found to have been obtained by fraudulent
representations.
A further point in which the Committee found that
the existing law needed simplification was in respect
of wives and children. The Act of 1870 had followed
the general principle that ? a married woman shall be
deemed to be the subject of the State of which her
husband is for the time being a subject.? But the law
was not clear as to the effect of divorce or widowhood
upon an alien woman who by marriage has become
British. The Committee thought that the woman should
revert to her original nationality; but, if she liked, she
could again become a British subject by going through
the ordinary process of naturalisation. In this con-
nexion they expressed the opinion that there is no
need to maintain any distinction between naturalisation
and ?readmission, ? the only proper method of readmission
being by naturalisation.
Then, as regards children, what is the status of a
child born (a) before, or ( b) after, naturalisation of the
father? Under the existing law, apparently, the child
is in any case deemed to be a British subject if in
infancy it resides with the father or widow in the
United Kingdom. It is deemed to be an alien if in
infancy it resides in a foreign country where the parent
has been naturalised and the law claims its allegiance
* It was reported last May that three Canadians, formerly Russians,
on revisiting their native country had been sentenced to Siberia for life
on a charge of evading military service. Sir Wilfrid Laurier cited it as
an example of the incompleteness of Canadian naturalisation, the Foreign
Office having declined to interfere. But Sir Edward Grey explained that
it was immaterial whether they were naturalised in Canada or in Britain,
as in all such cases ? the law of Russia would be the governing law.?


to the State. The Committee recommended that as
regards children born before naturalisation of the father,
their names might be included in the father?s certificate,
on his declaring his intention that they should reside
with him somewhere in the King?s dominions; but on
coming of age the child should have the option of making
a ? declaration of alienage ? so as to put off his or her
British nationality. And as regards children born after
naturalisation of the father, the child should be deemed
to be British wherever born. In the case of a British
woman losing her nationality by marrying an alien and
being left a widow with young children, the Secretary
of State should have discretion to naturalise the children
without requiring fulfilment of the ordinary conditions.
By this concession the sons, for example, might be
enabled to enter the British army before they were too
old. In the case of a British father making a declara-
tion of alienage, the children under age should thereby
become aliens too.
But our main concern is with the great anomaly. In
1899-1901 it was less flagrant than it has since become,
the volume of foreign settlement in the Dominions being
then comparatively small. But already it was sufficiently
real for the Committee to give it their best attention.
The position was, and is, that persons naturalised under
the local law of any Dominion or colony, or possibly
even in Britain too, remain aliens everywhere else, even
in other parts of the Empire. It is true that the Foreign
Office often recognises the claim of such a person to its
good offices; but, say the Committee, ? this is a matter
not of law but of discretion.? They point out that,
while such a state of affairs continues, little progress
can be made with the policy of negotiating treaties for
eliminating ? double nationality.? Foreign Governments
could not be expected to agree to cancel the allegiance
of their emigrant subjects unless the British Government
could offer to those settlers a nationality as �biquitous
in intention as that which they would have lost.*
* Conventions were made with the United States in 1871 and 1872 for
the purpose of preventing double nationality. But their effect seems to be
doubtful, owing to the language of the English and Colonial laws, which
suggests that with us naturalisation is a local status only.


The remedial proposal of the Committee became the
starting point of the negotiations with the Dominions
which at length have culminated in the present Bill.
Looking back over the long discussion, it is easy to per-
ceive and distinguish two alternative methods by which
the desired reform might be constitutionally effected.
Imperial legislation is necessary in any case, but it might
take either of two forms. One plan would be for the
Imperial Government to retain in its own hands the
exclusive power of making full British subjects, employ-
ing for this purpose oversea the Governor or Governor-
General as its own servant. But it would not be
surprising if the Dominions were shy of that plan.
Their own parliaments follow Westminster in being
sensitive to anything which may appear at all to threaten
the powers which they have acquired, and which to
them are the safeguards of public liberty. Having already
acquired a certain power in regard to naturalisation,
they might easily be jealous of the reappearance of
the Imperial Government side by side with their own
officers in that field, even if the distinction between
* local ? and * Imperial ? (or world-wide) naturalisation
would clearly delimit the respective spheres of authority.
The other plan would be for the Imperial Parliament to
pass an enabling measure, enabling Dominion parliaments
to give extra-territorial validity to a certain class of law,
viz. laws of naturalisation. Or, to put it in a possibly
more accurate way, the Imperial Act would recognise
the extra-territorial validity of the specified class of
colonial statute. Far from threatening Dominion auto-
nomy, such an Act would strengthen it in a most im-
portant manner, by emphasising a principle which marks
a long step towards giving the Dominions the status of
Nation-States constitutionally equal with Britain.*
But it is not quite clear which of those two methods
was followed in the proposal of the Committee in 1901.
Broadly, their suggestion was that the Governor should
be empowered, by Order-in-Council from Downing Street,
to grant certificates of full naturalisation to persons
* The Extradition Act of 1870 and the Copj'xight Act of 1886 are cited
by Mr Mulvey as examples of Imperial Statutes enabling the Dominions
to legislate with extra-territorial effect.


who had fulfilled conditions ? substantially the same ? as
those required for naturalisation in the United Kingdom,
leaving intact the existing power of the local Govern-
ments to grant local naturalisation on such conditions
as the local legislatures might ordain. Described in that
way, the proposal seems to illustrate the first of the two
methods. In up-to-date Canadian parlance it would be
described as the ? centralist ? method. A 'priori it is what
one would have expected to issue from a British official
committee at that time, because they would instinctively
assume, like Mr Keith, that ? naturalisation is essentially
an Imperial concern.? Subsequently, however, we find
the secretary of the Committee explaining, in reply to
some criticisms from Ottawa, that their proposals were
? that the Government of the United Kingdom shall have
no greater powers than those which we recommend to
be conferred on the Governments of other parts of His
Majesty?s dominions.? That seems to be a negative way
of saying that the powers of Dominion Governments
were to be raised to an equality with those of the British
Government. It would accord with the other of the two
methods ?in Canadian parlance the ? autonomist ? method.
But students may be excused if they find a difficulty in
understanding the precise intention of a proposal which
seems to have been found equally perplexing by the
practical statesmen who in various parts of the Empire
were called upon to deal with it. A characteristic feature
of the whole discussion, which has lasted from 1901 to
1913, is that the matter which seemed so simple at first
sight became more and more complicated the further it
was examined.
The question of constitutional principle was one of
three main difficulties which delayed the progress of
reform ; although, being entangled in a mass of other
detail, it did not emerge clearly until later. The second
great difficulty lay in the differences subsisting between
the conditions prescribed for local naturalisation in
Britain and in the various Dominions, representing to
some extent differences of social policy. After the
Imperial Act of 1844, and again after the Act of 1870, the
self-governing and other colonies in most cases proceeded
to pass local naturalisation laws, modelled generally on
the British Act. Thus they followed the British exemplar


in permitting aliens to hold property excepting ships.
This provision was adopted in Canada as elsewhere, and
it affects the notion that American settlers in Canada
apply to be naturalised only in order to obtain title to
their land. Again, the colonial laws followed the British
model in reserving full discretion to the minister to refuse
a certificate without having to explain why. As showing
the instinct of Britannic solidarity, it is worth noting
that in several instances (though Canada came into line
only at a later date) it was provided that persons who
had already obtained certificates in another part of the
Empire, or at least in the United Kingdom, should be
granted local naturalisation forthwith.
In respect of detail, however, the colonial laws often
differed not only from each other but from their English
prototype. In the case of the self-governing colonies
the most important differences may be classified as
follows: (1) The condition of five years? preliminary
residence was generally felt to be too exacting; the
policy oversea being to turn settlers into citizens as
quickly as possible, and naturalisation being the primary
condition of political rights. Thus in Canada the term
was reduced to three years; while in New Zealand
no term was stipulated at all, reliance being placed
on the test of character and education. (2) As to other
conditions, there was a tendency to stiffen rather than
relax the English standard. Whereas in the British
Act nothing was said about criminals or other classes of
social undesirables, some of the colonial Acts contained
safeguards against such classes. One has to remember
that in Britain there was an old tradition of affording
? asylum ? to political refugees (a class which can contain
undesirables); while in the young countries oversea the
instinct of selection was more alive than in the old
country, where the permanent population was already
too large to feel nervous, as yet, about the social effects
of unrestricted immigration or naturalisation. (3) The
introduction of a racial test in some of the colonial laws
signified a radical departure from the spirit of the English
law. By an Act passed in Queensland in 1867 no Asiatic
or African alien could be naturalised unless married,
and with his wife also living in the colony ; and even
when naturalised he could not become a member of the

Executive or Legislature. In Natal, while still a Ciown
Colony, the policy of restricting naturalisation to persons
?of European parentage or descent was adopted by law
in 1874. In New Zealand a special fee of IZ. was imposed
on the naturalisation of a Chinese by an Act of 1892.
Later, in 1896, Chinese were explicitly debarred from
naturalisation. In Australia naturalisation was one of
the matters in regard to which the Federal Council, the
precursor of federal union, was empowered to legislate
at the request of two or more colonies. The Council in
1897 promulgated a law applying to Victoria and Queens-
land for facilitating the naturalisation of persons ? of
European descent.? Having regard to such discrimina-
tions, it is not surprising to find that these laws of Queens-
land, Natal, and the Federal Council did not contain the
provision that British certificates might be recognised;
though at a later date it came to be recognised that the
risk was not really sufficiently important to justify
withholding the Britannic amenity.
The remedial proposal of the Committee in 1901 was
circulated to the Dominions by Mr Chamberlain, and
came before the Colonial Conference over which he pre-
sided in 1902. Correspondence was continued under the
Liberal Government which succeeded to office at the end
of 1905. The matter was carried another stage at the
Colonial Conference of 1907, by which time the first draft
of the proposed Imperial Bill had been prepared, em-
bodying largely the views of the Committee. The dis-
cussion revealed not only the instinctive dislike of some
of the Dominion statesmen for the proposed procedure
by Imperial legislation, but also their feeling that the
English law of naturalisation, which was to set the
standard for the Empire, was deficient in safeguards
against criminals and undesirables. Nor were they
wholly convinced on this point by the arguments of the
Home Secretary (Mr, afterwards Viscount, Gladstone)
that the Aliens Act, 1905, was now restraining the influx
of low-class foreigners, and that the actual administration
of the naturalisation law was much more stringent than
might be supposed from its terms.* A resolution was

passed, contemplating the holding o� a Subsidiary Con-
ference if the matter could not be settled otherwise. In
the following year (1908) another inter-departmental
committee was arranged in Downing Street, under the
presidency of Sir M. D. Chalmers, with a view to modify-
ing the Bill so as to meet the objections which had
been raised. As to procedure, the Committee argued
that, since colonial naturalisation laws could have no
effect outside the colony, Imperial legislation was indis-
pensable, in order to give them extra-territorial effect,
which could be no curtailment of self-governing powers.
They further proposed to insert a statutory condition
that in the United Kingdom the applicant should ? adduce
evidence of good character and evidence that he has an
adequate knowledge of the English language.? The Com-
mittee?s report was circulated and further correspondence
ensued, conducted now through the new * secretariat ? of
the Imperial Conference, but without avoiding the
roundabout methods of negotiation. In the case of
South Africa the business was interrupted, the several
Governments feeling that the whole matter should be
referred to the Union Government which was about to
be established. No Subsidiary Conference was held, the
negotiations being continued by correspondence up to the
next session (1911) of the Imperial Conference. By that
time the South African Government had already passed
a Naturalisation Act (No. 4 of 1910), in which the term
of residence was fixed at two years, racial differentiation
was omitted, and provision was made for recognising
British certificates. The latter amenity had now been
established in Canada also, by a special Act of 1906. In
Australia naturalisation continued to be governed by a
federal law, passed in 1903, which adopted the two-year
term of residence and excluded aboriginal natives of
Asia, Africa, or the Pacific Islands. With the exception
of those, it franked aliens who had been naturalised in
the United Kingdom.
Within the present limits of space it is possible to
indicate only the salient features of the protracted con-
troversy and the final solution. The constitutional
question and the difficulty arising from diversity of local
naturalisation laws have already been mentioned. Closely
connected with the last named was the third great


obstacle, which was sheer misunderstanding. In South
Africa, New Zealand and Australia, not only the public,
but many of its leaders were haunted with the idea that
their countries could not become parties to any joint
scheme of complete naturalisation without opening their
doors to a possible flood of undesirables and Asiatics,
whom they would be obliged not merely to admit but to
endow with political rights. Visions of Asiatics swarm-
ing over from Hongkong and Singapore, where the
conditions of naturalisation are very easy, or even via
Britain, clouded their horizon.
This apprehension arose from the popular confusion,
which had so long prevailed, between the ideas of citizen
and subject. The notion persisted that somehow subject-
hood per se conveyed political rights, including a right of
entry to any part of the King?s dominions, and a right to
vote in the case of a country possessing elective institu-
tions. As we have already seen, subjecthood does not in
itself carry any such rights, and so the apprehension was
entirely groundless. The strength of the fallacy had,
however, been sufficiently apparent as an obstacle to
progress for the Committee of 1908 to take pains to
demolish it once for all. They insisted that the Naturali-
sation Bill had ? very little bearing on the coloured race
question ?; in fact, that question was a matter ? entirely
untouched by the present Bill.? Naturalised aliens, they
pointed out, were to have only the same rights as natural-
born British subjects, who already numbered some
260,000,000 of Asiatic and African origin. If those rights
were really any danger to the self-governing Dominions,
that danger could hardly be affected by the addition of a
few more persons to so vast a total. ? Any colonial law ?
(e.g. an immigration or a franchise law) ?affecting the
coloured race, which applies to natural-born British
subjects, must apply equally and continue to apply to
naturalised persons.? When next the Imperial Conference
met, in 1911, the true appreciation of the matter had
taken root, and the old apprehension had almost died.
It was a point which had never troubled Mr Deakin, who
represented the Commonwealth at the previous session
in 1907. But his Labour successor, Mr Fisher, ably
assisted at the Conference of 1911 by the late Mr
Batchelor, had shared with Sir Joseph Ward and the


South Africans the fear that somehow the proposed
Imperial Bill might ? override ? the racial policy of those
Dominions. In 1911 it was nearly superfluous for Sir
John Simon to repeat that there was nothing in the
rights of a natural-born British subject?which are the
utmost that naturalisation can ever confer?that could
? the least affect the legislative power of each and every
Dominion either to exclude? a coloured British subject
? or, if he comes inside the area of a Dominion, to deny
him privileges which white people or persons speaking a
European language enjoy.?
Having thus touched upon the three most contentious
points of this ten-year negotiation, let us now consider
the ultimate agreement which was reached at the
Imperial Conference of 1911. The general aim may be
summed up in two postulates, (1) that a British subject
anywhere should be a British subject everywhere, and
(2) that the process of naturalisation should be uniform.
As an obvious corollary to the first, and as part of the
arrangement of the second, it had always been felt that,
if anywhere the conditions of naturalisation include a
certain period of prior residence, residence in any part
of the Empire should count for that purpose, superseding
the existing rule that the whole of the prior residence,
or of the intended future residence, must be in that part
of the Empire where the certificate is asked for. But as
to ? uniformity ? of process, there was room for differences
of opinion, arising from differences in the conception
of what is meant by Imperial unity. All would agree
that the process of complete naturalisation should be
uniform throughout the Empire, at least in the sense
that it should be effected in the name of the common
Sovereign and under constitutional laws. But to go
beyond that, and demand that in each part of the Empire
the statutory conditions for being received into the
King?s ligeance should be identical, or even ? substantially
the same,? is to raise an issue between two different con-
ceptions of Britannic unity, of which the one idealises
uniformity, while the other discerns a truer harmony in
diversity. Representing the latter school, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier advocated as a guiding maxim in this matter,
? uniformity of effect, diversity of method.? Apparently
he wished to solve the problem quite simply by means


THE IMPERIAL NATURALISATION BILL 19
of an Imperial Act, if necessary, giving extra-territorial
effect to the naturalisation laws of the Dominions,
quite regardless of any local variations in the period of
residence or any other conditions. By this simple expe-
dient any confusion which would arise in any country
from the co-existence of two kinds of naturalisation,
the local and the world-wide, would be avoided alto-
gether.
In principle Sir Wilfrid Laurier s plan could hardly
be resisted at the stage which the discussion had now
reached. The autonomists, if they ever had any real
ground for alarm, had already won the day. * The object
of the Bill in its application to the Dominions,? said the
Committee of 1908, ?is to give extra-territorial effect to
the laws passed by the local legislatures. If so, it could
hardly be demanded as a matter of principle that the
conditions prescribed by those laws should be everywhere
identical. The actual objections made to Sir AVilfrid
Laurier?s plan were based, however, not on Imperial
principle, but on local and administrative convenience.
The Australian ministers feared that under such a system
foreign immigrants would evade the intention of the
Australian naturalisation law, which prescribes two years
residence, by first getting naturalised in neighbouring
New Zealand, where there is no requirement of prior
residence. To meet this difficulty Sir Joseph Ward began
to speak of amending the New Zealand law in that
regard. But the British Government cut the Canadian
proposal short with a decisive objection of their own.
They could not possibly consent, the Home Secretary
(Mr Churchill) declared, to accept in the United Kingdom
the certificates of any persons who had not spent at least
five years within the Empire. Their objection was
grounded on the modern tendency of social legislation in
Britain, illustrated by the old age pensions law and the
insurance law, to which Mr Churchill specifically referred.
The pecuniary benefits conferred by this class of legisla-
tion are confined to British subjects, though aliens have
the privilege of contributing to the cost. Apparently the
Government feared that if naturalisation were made any
easier there might be a larger influx of pauper aliens,
intent on insurance or pensions benefits.
One would have thought that the risk apprehended by


the Home Office might be met by safeguards indepen-
dently of naturalisation law. The immigration restric-
tion law of 1905 might be stiffened, and a special period
of prior residence might be required as one condition
of receiving an old age pension, as in Australia.* But
whether or not their resistance was really prompted by
the instinct of preserving Imperial control, the attitude
of the British Government excluded Sir Wilfrid Laurier?s
proposal and threw the Conference back upon the inferior
plan of having to tolerate a dual system, under which
? local ? and ?world-wide? naturalisation would everywhere
co-exist, unless in any part of the Empire the former
were abolished. The ? Imperial ? or world-wide status
would contain the local, but the local would not contain
the Imperial. The compromise actually arranged was
that, under powers to be taken by the United Kingdom
and conferred on Dominion legislatures by the Imperial
Act, world-wide naturalisation should be granted by
local law to any alien who, in addition to any other
requirements, (1) has resided not less than five years
within the Empire, or has served the Crown for five
years out of the last eight years ; (2) is of good character
and has an adequate knowledge of the English or other
official language ; and (3) intends to reside within the
Empire or serve under the Crown. A proviso that the
last twelve months must be spent in the country where
application for the certificate is made, overcomes some
obvious difficulties. For instance, the discretion of the
responsible minister would be hampered if he could
discover nothing about the applicant without having
to seek information oversea. As the proposal stands,
the minister could easily find out the alien?s record and
reputation for the last twelve months at least. It was
suggested that the several Governments might exchange
lists of persons to whom naturalisation had anywhere
been refused, so as to check such persons if they applied
in another part of the Empire.
It was not found practicable to redraft the Bill in
time for the matter to be finally settled at the Conference.
Moreover, some of the Dominion ministers felt that it
was not their proper function at the Conference to

undertake the final adjustment of technical points in a
matter of this kind, without the assistance of their
departmental advisers. But Mr Harcourt, directing the
Dominions Department, pushed on the work. As before,
the purpose of the Bill was twofold, (a) to reform the
naturalisation law of the United Kingdom, and ( b ) to
give extra-territorial effect to certain legislation of the
Dominions. By November (1911) the new Bill had been
approved by the South African Government, who had
been among the keenest critics of the previous draft; and
by the end of the next year (1912) there was wanting
only the endorsement of the Canadian Government.
Thanks to the initiative of Mr E. M. Macdonald, the
member for Pictou, the subject was thrice discussed by
the Commons at Ottawa, first on December 4, 1911, next
on February 2,1912, and again on January 29,1913. These
discussions were on a high level, displaying a full appre-
ciation of the Imperial importance of the reform and of the
technical difficulties attending it. The new Government
(Mr Borden having succeeded Sir Wilfrid Laurier since
the Conference) explained that the delay in giving their
approval was due to their anxiety to prevent any impair-
ment of the autonomy conferred by the British North
America Act of 1867, which is the charter of the Dominion.
Papers having been called for, a valuable memorandum
was prepared by Mr Thomas Mulvey, Under-Secretary
of State. In the third debate Mr Doherty, the Minister
of Justice, explained the position in a very lucid
and interesting speech, which deserves more than. a
passing mention. From a Dominion point of view the
Imperial Bill purported, he pointed out, to do two things ;
to make naturalisation in the United Kingdom effective
in the Dominions and elsewhere ; and to confer on the
Dominion legislatures the power, provided they ? adopted ?
certain sections of the Act, to create a naturalisation
which would be effective in the United Kingdom and
elsewhere. But as to the first, he protested that only
the Canadian Parliament, not the British Parliament,
could constitutionally give to persons naturalised outside
Canada, e.g. in Britain, the status of British subjects in
Canada. This was a flaw which he thought ought to be
remedied in the form of the Bill. And as to the second,
he considered that the Dominion Parliaments were not


placed ? on a footing of equality ? with the British Parlia-
ment; because, under the Bill as drafted, their powers
were made conditional upon their adopting certain
sections of that extraneous measure.
The political argument upon which Mr Doherty
based these views was briefly as follows. Legally
the British Parliament can legislate as it pleases for the
whole Empire or any part of it. But legally is not the
same as constitutionally. Constitutionalism has regard
to considerations of ? national honour and good faith ?;
which would be violated if the British Parliament passed
legislation impairing any powers conferred on a Dominion
by previous legislation. Section 91 of the B.N.A. Act
had delegated to the Canadian Parliament the power
to legislate in regard to naturalisation, and that power
was limited only by what was understood to be the
meaning of ?naturalisation? at that time (1867). Some
Canadians had gone so far as to contend that this
section gave Canada all the power required for con-
ferring the complete, not merely the local, status of
British subject.* If so, no Imperial legislation would
now be necessary, but only an amendment by the
Canadian Parliament of its own law, by deleting the
restrictive words, ? within Canada,? wherever they oc-
curred. But, he held, that view was wrong. The power
delegated by section 91 of the B.N.A. Act must be inter-
preted in the light of the conception which in 1867 pre-
vailed in England as to the effect of the status conferred
by naturalisation. What that conception was could be
ascertained by comparing certain earlier legislation in
Britain, in the forties, which clearly showed that the
British Parliament had, at the outset, proceeded *on
the assumption that naturalisation was in itself a local
thing,? i.e. that the status conferred by it was of local
effect only. The power actually exercised at that time
by the British Parliament, and, therefore, the similar
power delegated to Canada, was evidently the power
only of creating a local, not a world-wide, status. No
doubt the transference of power had been complete,
and could not constitutionally now be resumed from
Canada by the British Parliament. But in the present

Law Times, Nov. 1911.


Bill the British Parliament was enlarging for itself the
scope of the status conferred in Britain by naturalisation;
and some Imperial legislation was required for similarly
enlarging the scope of the status which Canada could
confer by virtue of the power delegated in 1867. The
Canadian Government, recognising that necessity, would
give their approval to the introduction at Westminster
of the present Bill as soon as the technical flaw in it
had been amended. Mr Doherty was able to state that
the British Government, after first disputing his inter-
pretation of the clause in question, had agreed that he
was probably right, and had readily promised to make
the required correction of the draft. In reply to a
question, he intimated that as soon as the Canadian
Government should hear that the corrected Bill had
been ?enacted? at Westminster,.they would introduce
the requisite legislation at Ottawa.
Mr Doherty?s political argument rather discourages the
idea that the reserve power of the British Parliament
to legislate for the whole Empire has still a potential
value in the interests of Imperial unity. But that is
an incidental reflection which cannot here be further
pursued. In June last the British Government took
occasion to promise that on receiving Canada?s endorse-
ment of the revised draft they would at the first oppor-
tunity introduce the Bill and press for its speedy passage.
At the end of August it was reported from Canada
that the Dominion Government had met that condition.
Apparently it remains only for the British and Dominion
Governments to redeem their pledges.
When the scheme which has thus ripened is carried
into effect, which should be accomplished before the next
session of the Imperial Conference (1915), we need not
think that finality has been reached. The perpetuation
of a ? local ? status, alongside a world-wide status, must
tend to popular confusion. In the debates at Ottawa
the opinion was expressed that ninety or more per cent,
of aliens in Canada would be content when, after three
years? residence in the Dominion, they were able to
obtain the ?local? certificate and acquire the privileges
of Canadian citizenship. The Government replied that,
even so, the remainder who recognised the value of the
full status would have the means of obtaining it which


had hitherto been lacking altogether. Questioned as to
whether it might not be the future policy of the Govern-
ment to discontinue local naturalisation, Mr Doherty
replied by suggesting that, while it might be advantageous
to continue the three-year system for local purposes,
there would be no necessity to call it ?naturalisation?
at all, and thus the prospect of popular confusion might
be reduced. That suggestion may have been inspired
by the report of the Committee of 1899, which deprecated
the use of the term ?naturalisation? for the status
conferred under colonial laws.
In any event, the passage of this legislation will
undoubtedly mark an important development in the
political relationship of the Dominions to Britain. The
principle of recognising the extra-territorial effect of
Dominion laws has an important bearing on other
matters, e.g. questions of merchant shipping law, which
have long been the subject of controversy on the
constitutional point. But the larger aspect of the im-
pending reform must always lie in its effect on the
development of a Britannic citizenship. Is there to be
a definite citizenship of the Empire, as the corollary
to uniform subjecthood under the common Crown ?
And, if so, is that citizenship to be common to all the
many races within the Empire ? Could an Empire
parliament enact an Empire naturalisation law, having
regard to the ? colour ? difficulty which the more elastic
system of the Imperial Conference has been able to get
round ? Or, is there to be no uniformity of citizenship,
but instead an equality of national rights, each national
legislature determining for itself on what conditions
subjects of the Crown may become local citizens, and
concerting policies through the Imperial Conference for
investing these local citizenships with a common measure
of Britannic privileges and Britannic responsibilities?
That is the grand, ulterior issue which the present Bill
opens up, but leaves for the future to decide.
