JIMBOUR.
SITUATION.?A freehold property, belonging to the Darling
Downs and Western Land Company, Limited, situated about the
most northern part of the famous Darling Downs of Queensland
at a distance of 167 miles from Brisbane, and 15 miles from the
market town of Dalby.
The main trunk line of railway, from Brisbane to the north
and west, divides the property, and renders it easy of access from
north or south. The railway station of Macalister is 12 miles
from the homestead, which occupies a most convenient and favour-
able position for controlling and working the property in the most
economical manner. Here are substantially well-built manager?s
house, stores, stables, coachhouses, yards, cottages, and workshops,
the latter containing a complete set of tools for all station pur-
poses. There is also a steam sawmill driven by a 12-horse power
engine, which can be utilized for pumping water when the wind-
mill is not available, in calm weather, to a large tank, from whence
a constant supply by gravitation is given to all the houses and
stables around.
The wash pool and wool sheds are situated at the western end
of the property, abutting on the railway and Condamine River,
where 5000 sheep can be washed and shorn with ease daily.
EXTENT AND CHARACTER.?The property covers an
area of 125,859 acres, or 197 square miles, having a frontage to
the railway of about IQ?!- miles and 20 miles in depth.


The Condamine River is on the western boundary of the lands,
into which the Jimbour, Coorangah, Cattle, and Myall Creeks,
with their tributaries, empty themselves on their course from the
Bunya Mountains.
The country consists of plains, intercepted with belts of timber,
giving a pleasant aspect to the scene, resembling some of the
finest park lands of England. The soil is of a rich black and
chocolate loamy character, and upon being analyzed by Mr. Staiger,
the Government analytical chemist, was pronounced as being most
suitable for growing wheat. The whole is divided and enclosed
with strong substantial iron fencing, and, where necessary, with
galvanized wire dog and marsupial proof netting
WATER SUPPLY. ?Perhaps in no part of Queensland are
they so independent of dry seasons.
In addition to the natural supply of water in the rivers and
creeks, twenty-two dams have been constructed, some of which
throw the water back a distance of two miles. Twenty reservoirs
and seventeen wells have been sunk at convenient parts of the
property, with all necessary appliances for raising the water, in
the shape of windmills, whims, etc., thus securing a large and
plentiful supply throughout the driest seasons.
PLANT. ?The plant is very extensive and in good working
order, and consists of the following :
At the wash pool?one 50-horse power engine, spout washing
apparatus, sweating sheds, Lane?s tanks, centrifugal pump, etc.
Wool shed capable of containing about 80 shearers, and accom-
modation for dumping machinery and storing wools.
At the head station and farm ?a large quantity of the most
modern agricultural implements, including drays, wagons, and a
complete set of engineers, blacksmiths, and wheelwrights? tools.
At various points upon the station?sufficient drafting and
sorting sheds, and also, at convenient places, 17 wells, about 100
to 200 feet deep, with windmill, pumps, and pumping gear of the
best description, pumping the water for the stock into large dams,
constructed at convenient places adjacent.


STOCK.?Consists of about 122,405 sheep, of various ages
and sexes ; 668 horses, of all ages, including 5 draught, 2 thorough-
bred, and one Norfolk trotter stallions; 171 cattle for slaughter-
ing purposes
Special.care has been taken in securing a first-class breed of
sheep, by importing fine Spanish merino rams, and careful selection
of ewes, until the Jimbour flock has attained perhaps the first
position in Queensland for good stock, and in England the wool is
well known and realizes the highest prices.
MINERAL.?CoaI is found throughout the greater part of the
property. At the head station a shaft has been sunk to a depth
of 60 feet, where is worked, at a small cost, a seam 48 inches
thick?for the requirements of the station, including the manu-
facture of gas, which is laid on to all the. principal points, and
found a considerable saving upon any other method of lighting.
The engineer of the Brisbane Gas Works reports of a sample
from this pit, that it is a magnificent gas coal. It costs at present,
with the very inadequate means at hand of working, about 6s.
per ton, but when the production increases it will be done at a
much less cost.
At another part of the property and within easy access to the
railway, whilst sinking a well a most valuable seam 28 feet thick
has been struck, and by experts the quality has been pronounced
as one of the finest specimens they have seen in Australia; it is
of a hard character, well adapted for steam purposes, and will
stand transit either by land or water?differing in that respect
from any coal yet found in Queensland.
CULTlVATlON.?Cultivation, up to the present time, has
been conducted upon only an area of 300 acres, or sufficient for
the feeding of the horses and stud flocks upon the station, but
the demand for all sorts of agricultuaal produce is increasing
with the popul xtion so rapidly, that steps are being taken to bring
into cultivation a much larger area. Two steam ploughs,
having the latest improvements, are now on their way from
England, and when they are fairly started it is estimated

that the land, so well adapted for agriculture, will increase in
value enormously?perhaps in no part of the world are there such
natural advantages for farming with economy as here.
The crops now produced consist of imphee, a plant well adapted
for stock, is exceedingly productive, and lasts for several years
without replanting?in a field of about 40 acres an average for
three years of nearly 30 tons to the acre has been obtained.
Oats, maize, and lucerne are equally as prolific, the latter being
the most useful for feeding sheep, and will be extensively grown
on the arrival of the ploughing plant.
A market for any quantity of produce is within easy access by
rail, and for stock rearing purposes alone it is estimated that
nearly 50 per cent, more will be kept for every square mile of
country.
Taking into consideration, therefore, the favourable position
occupied, the extent and character of the soil, the valuable coal
seams, the excellent water supply, commodious accommodation,
efficient plant, and the favourable prospects of bringing the
country under agricultural cultivation, the annexed estimated
value of the property, as it now stands, is a very moderate one
indeed.

BUARABA.
SITUATION.?This property is situated in the West Moreton
District of Queensland, on the eastern elopes of the main range,
about 60 miles from the capital (Brisbane) and 15 from the
Southern and Western Railway, at Gatton. Its close proximity
to the railway and the metropolitan markets is of the greatest
advantage in the sale of fat stock, for which it is most admira-
bly adapted, besides which it forms a depot for fat stock from
the western stations.
AREA. The freehold lands consist of 25,908 a. Or.
comprising timbered ridges, with large alluvial flats, which have
been proved as well adapted for cultivation. It is well watered
by the Buaraba Creek and its tributaries. In addition to the
freehold land there is an area of 53 square miles, leased from
the Crown at an annual rental of �lO6.
IMPROVEMENTS.?The improvements are substantial and
complete. On the homestead there are the manager?s house,
men?s huts, store, blacksmith?s shop, and stables for stud cattle
and horses, to which are attached yards and small paddocks for
the different kinds of breeding stock. The whole of the
foregoing buildings have the water laid on by the means
of a tank, supplied by a windmill from Buaraba Creek,
which has a never-failing supply. The whole of the
freehold lands are surrounded by good substantial two-rail
fences, and, in consequence of the several descriptions of breed-


ing stock, the subdivisions are very numerous, in addition there
are two large drafting and hording yards, capable of working
the Mhole herd, and over 150 acres are cultivation with
lucerne, oats, imphee, mangold wurzell, &c., as fodder for the
stud stock.
STOCK.?The stock on the property consists of various kinds;
first, the pure herd of cattle, which has been formed at
considerable expense, now numbering 296; and the
demand for bulls from the herd, at remunerative prices, is
practically unlimited ; secondly, the steers and bullocks which
have been brought down from the other stations or purchased
for fattening purposes, and now numbering about 3,467;
thirdly, the horses consisting of 130 draught and 138 saddle
(blood stock), besides 6 stallions.
From what has been pointed out, the special advantage
attached to a freehold such as this can readily be discerned, and
fully bear out the following estimated value of the property.

400 from Brisbane.
IMPROVEMENTS.?The improvements consist of first-class
dwelling-house, kitchen, store, meat store, stables, men?s huts,
stock-yards, etc., two horse paddocks at the head station ; at
the out station there are three huts, two horse paddocks, herding

about 100 miles.
AREA.?This property, held under the Pastoral Leases Act
of 1869, comprises the blocks of country known as Mizpah No. 1,
Mt. Eden, Finure, Myrtleville, Ravenswood, Sunville, Merivale and
Mt. Howe, with a total area of 379 square miles, for which an annual
rental of =�2Bo Bs. 6d. is paid, and the leases do not expire until
1892 and 1896, but the rent is increased by 10�/ o every five years.
The land consists of open undulating forest country, well and
thickly grassed, with blue, barley, kangaroo, and other descrip
tions of grass. The timbers are box, ironbark, myall, apple, and
pine. The run is watered by the Merivale River, which runs
through the property for 25 miles. The other principal water-
courses are the Cochrane, Clyde, Smyth, and Sandy Creeks,
besides numerous lagoons, which afford a never-failing supply of
water.

AYRSHIRE DOWNS.
AREA.?This property is situated in the North Gregory Dis-
trict, and comprises the blocks known as Wokingham 1/3, 5/7,
and 9, Goongarry 1/3, with a gross area of 820 square miles, or
524,800 acres, rented from the Crown under the Pastoral Leases

WESTLAND.
This property is situated on the Thompson River, in the Mit-
chell District, and comprises the several runs known as Bunda-
berina, Moselle, Hazlewood, Colston, Quorn, Cropwell, Widner-
pool, and Melton, with a superficial area of 737 square miles,

under the Pastoral Leases Act of 1869, which extend to 1892
and 1896; the present rental is �584 10s., but under the Act
provision is made for the gradual increase of the rents, which
takes place every 5 years, of 10�/ o . Under the provisions of the
above quoted act, preemptive right can be exercised on all
the leasehold properties to the extent of 2,560 acres on each run,
at the upset price of 10s. an acre, and, with a view of securing
as much as possible, when the necessity for purchase arises, the
runs on all the properties have been subdivided into 2 or 3
blocks. Ihe country consists of. plains and rolling downs,
covered with an abundance of Mitchell, Blue, and other
first-class grasses, and a plentiful supply of saltbush and herb-
age. In addition to the Thompson Eiver, to which it has a
