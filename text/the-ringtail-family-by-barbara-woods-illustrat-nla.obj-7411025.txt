My dear," said Mr. Ringtail, rubbing his paws
together in excitement, "I have heard of a really
marvellous house."


THE
RINGTAIL FAMILY
Mr. Ringtail, a fine grey mouse, hurried
into the room, rubbing his paws together in
excitement.
"My dear/' he said to his wife, "I have just
heard of a really marvellous house. If we are
lucky we shall be able to move in on Friday."
Mrs. Ringtail dropped her knitting in
surprise. "Oh, where is it? Ido hope it is in
a good locality."
"Yes, indeed it is. No. 5, Pantry Place, 4 The
Large House', is the address."
Ah, thank goodness for that," said Mrs.
Ringtail. "We must go and look through it."
"I intended to go this afternoon," her


husband replied. "Will it be convenient for
you?"
'Yes, I think that would suit me."
At that moment, Ting, their eldest daughter,
came into the room, a pile of darning in her arms.
What would suit you, Mamma? she asked.
"We are going to look through a house this
afternoon, said Mrs. Ringtail. "You may come
too, if you wish."
"Oh, I will," said Ting. "Where is it? Is it
in 'The Large House ?"
"Well, it is, young lady. Why do you want
to live there in particular?" Mr. Ringtail enquired.
"The Mayor lives there, and Lady White
Mouse, and Sir Reginald Dunnley, and lots of
other important folk."
"Really," said her father sarcastically.


■ .pju
That afternoon they arrived at No. 5 Pantry Place.
Mrs. Ringtail was charmed with the place. .


4 'What part of 'The Large House* is it?" Ting
enquired.
"Pantry Place, No. 5," Mrs. Ringtail said as
she glanced at the clock. "Oh, dear, just look
at the time. If we want to go out this afternoon
I had better get lunch ready. Come and help
*»
me, 1 ing.
That afternoon, they inspected the house. It
was in a sheltered position in the pantry of "The
Large House". There were two doors, which,
as Mr. Ringtail said, would be very useful in an
emergency.
Mrs. Ringtail was charmed with the place.
"Th ere are just enough rooms," she
announced at last. "A bedroom and nursery for
the boys, and the same for Tiny. Ting can have
a separate room, too."
"Well," smiled Mr. Ringtail, 'as you seem to
like it, we will move in on Friday."


"I'm sorry I'm late" said Ting to her worried family
as she came in, "but look what I've brought you."


Friday came at last, and the Ringtail family
arrived at Pantry Place.
The boys, from big Phil down to baby Morry,
were delighted with the place. The twins, Rip
and Tip, liked it even better than Phil and Morry.
Tiny did not like the new house very much.
She was a shy little mouse, and the bustle of
Pantry Place was too noisy for her.
A few days after they had moved in, Mr.
Ringtail came in with an armful of biscuit
crumbs.
"I went into the kitchen/' he explained, 'and
found them on the floor.''
"How lovely,'' said little Morry, "I do like
biscuit crumbs.''
"And we like toasted cheese," said the twins.
"Phil brought some home, and Mummy is going
to toast it."


The Ringtail Family had a lovely party that
night, and how they all enjoyed themselves!


'Where is Ting?" asked Mrs. Ringtail
anxiously.
Tiny looked up from laying the table. "She
went out a long time ago. I don't think she's
come back yet.''
"I hope nothing has happened to her.'' Mr.
Ringtail was worried.
'Why, what's wrong?'' asked Phil as he
entered the room.
'Ting hasn't come in yet," said everyone at
once.
"Oh, yes, she has," called a cheery voice, and
Ting hurried up to her worried family. "I'm so
sorry I'm late. But look what I've brought you."
"What is it?" cried Morry.
"Milk. Wasn't I lucky to get it?"
"Oh, yes, yes," said the family, for milk was
indeed a luxury.


?;
Mrs. Ringtail and Ting went exploring one night
in one of the bedrooms of "The Large House,"
where they found many pretty things.


We will have a lovely party to-night/' said
Phil.
They did, too, and how they enjoyed them-
selves!
Several nights later, Mrs. Ringtail and Ting
went exploring. Up the stairs of ' The Large
House" they went, and into one of the bedrooms.
Here they found many pretty things, and had to
get the help of Mr. Ringtail to carry them down.
There was a pom-pom Ting had chewed off a
slipper. "It will make a beautiful cushion, she
said. Mrs. Ringtail had a handkerchief, a hair
ribbon, and a small bottle of perfume. "It has
been a very profitable evening," they told each
other.
Meanwhile, the twins had been exploring in
the kitchen, and got themselves into trouble.
They had seen a mouse-trap with cheese on it.
Together they tried to nibble the cheese, but
alas! the trap went off and both were caught.
Their frantic squeals and cries for help soon
reached their father's ears, and he hurried to the
rescue. What a surprise he got when he saw his
twin sons caught in a mouse-trap.

The twins had gone exploring too, in the kitchen,
and found a mousetrap with cheese on it.


"Stop making that noise," he ordered, "and I
will soon set you free."
But it was no use, Mr. Ringtail could not
release Rip and Tip. Of course, they began to
struggle and scream again.
"Hush, be still," their father said. "You are
only making things more difficult. I will go and
get help." He scurried away to the pantry.
In a few minutes he returned, Phil following
close behind, but even with their united efforts
the steel band would not move an inch.
The two prisoners were crying bitterly by
this and no kind words could soothe them.
"I ll get Mother and Ting to help," murmured
Phil, as he ran off.
Soon he was back with Mrs. Ringtail and
Ting, with Tiny and Morry bringing up the rear.
This time, with all the family pulling, pushing

and tugging, the spring was raised and the twins
were released and carried home, both with
broken legs.
When their legs had been put in splints and
bandaged and they were put to bed, Mr. Ringtail
gave Rip and Tip a lecture.
"I will not punish you this time," he said,
"for your fright and injuries have been punish-
ment enough, but listen carefully to what I have
to say. You must not go into the kitchen again,
and you must only go into the pantry at night.
You are not to nibble the food on the shelves;
in fact, you must not play on the shelves at all."
"Father," said Rip, "we won t be able to do
anything."
"Nothing at all," said Tip.
"It is for your own good, my sons. Take
heed of my warning, or something worse than
what happened to-day will befall you. Remember
what I have said."


v ii*\ ' .... ... ....... : , .• V ■: '-*&
After a lot of pulling and pushing by the whole
family, the spring was at last raised and the twins
were released.


But Rip and Tip could not have listened very;
carefully to their father, for when they could get
about again they ventured into the pantry and
on to the shelves.
4 Took at the jellies," said Rip.
44 And the cakes," cried Tip.
4 4 And the cheese," they said together.
44 1 must try these things," Tip said, licking
his lips.
44 1 must, too," said Rip.
And so they had a nibble here and a nibble
there, a bite here and a bite there. Sad to relate,
while they were in the middle of their feast, the
cook came into the pantry.
"Mice!" she screamed. "Mice in my nice
clean pantry, and in broad daylight, too." She
picked up her skirts and ran screaming away.
"I don't suppose it matters," said Rip easily.


When the twins' broken legs were put into splints
and bandaged, they were put to bed, and Mr.
Ringtail gave them a lecture.


"Neither do I," replied Tip.
But it did matter, very much indeed. When
they came home Mr. Ringtail met them with a
whip.
"I am going to punish you for disobedience,"
he told them. "I warned you not to leave the
house in the daytime, or to go onto the shelves."
Later that day, Mr. and Mrs. Ringtail were
talking over the matter.
I think it would be a good idea if you bought
some books for the twins," said Mrs. Ringtail.
They have missed a lot of school because we
have had to move so often."
'What sort of books do you suggest?" asked
Mr. Ringtail.
Oh, about the dangers of mouse-traps, how
to look for food, perhaps one about cats. That
would be useful, even though there are no cats
about here."

Sad to relate, while they were in the middle of
their feast, the cook came into the pantry. "Mice!"
she screamed.


"Hmm," Mr. Ringtail pondered. "It would
certainly be a good idea. I will buy some
to-morrow."
The next day he brought in an armful of
books. "How to Dodge the Cat", "Mouse-traps
and Their Dangers", "Food and How to Get It",
were some of the volumes.
The twins liked best the book on dodging the
cat —it was all a game to them, and just as well,
too, for several days later Mr. Ringtail came home
with some bad news. " 'The Large House' people
have a cat," he informed his family. "Someone
must have seen Rip and Tip." He looked
piercingly at the twins. "Who was it?"
"The c —cook," stuttered Rip.
"Tha—that's right," stammered Tip.
"Well, it is all your fault. The mice of this
district will now live in danger because of you."
"Oh, we are so sorry,'' chorused Rip and Tip.


The twins liked best the book on dodging the cat
—it seemed a great game to them.


'lt is too late to be sorry. I hope you have
learned a lesson and will obey your father," said
Mrs. Ringtail.
From then on, the Ringtail family and the
other mice lived in constant dread of the cat. It
was a big black and white creature, with
great green eyes. It was not safe to venture out
of their homes, even at night, for the cat was
always on the alert. Food, of course, was scarce,
and many mice grew ill. Starving mice children
crouched in their holes, or peered out of doorways
at the black and white monster. Many families
were leaving Pantry Place to go to other homes,
or to the country.
The event which made the Ringtails leave
was Baby Morry s accident.
Another mouse had dared him to go into the
pantry one afternoon, and Morry had gone. The
cat walked into the pantry, saw Morry, and made
one gigantic spring. Luckily he just missed the
tiny mouse.
A long chase followed, Morry running round

and round until he was exhausted. At length he
ran under a cupboard to escape the cruel cat's
claws. The cat, being big, could not crawl under-
neath, and so it waited, waited for Morry to
come out.
Many anxious hours followed, and the cat
grew weary at last and went away. Morry ran
home and into his mother's arms. The poor little
mouse had to stay in bed a few days after his
fright, and when he got up the family decided
to move.
"We will go to the country," Mr. Ringtail
decided. "It will be much safer there."
"I saw an advertisement in the 'Mouse Town
Times'," said Phil.
"Where is the place?" asked Ting.
Some miles west of the town of Lindsey-
ville."
"We must see about it," Mrs. Ringtail said.


Morrie ran home and into his mother's arms. The
poor little mouse was terrified.


The following week, the family arrived
outside their new home. It was in a hollow stump,
overgrown with a pretty creeper. It was a beau-
tiful place. The surrounding countryside was
inhabited by several families of mice, so the
Ringtails had plenty of friends.
They all loved their new home, especially
quiet Tiny. And there they lived peacefully and
happily among their lovely surroundings for the
rest of their days.


At last they arrived outside their new home. It was
a hollow stump overgrown with a pretty creeper.
