PORTABLE & DURABLE MEDICINE CASES,
FITTED WITH
Pare, Portable and Active “Tabloids” of
Compressed Drags.
The B. W. & Co. Medicine Cases have acquired a world-wide repu-
tation through their convenience and efficiency. The “ Tabloids ”do
away with the necessity for carrying scales, weights and measures,
and prevent possible mistakes, for each “ Tabloid ” contains a spe-
cified quantity of the drug, thus enabling the most illiterate person
to calculate his dose of medicine with precision.
B. W. & Co.’s Medicine Cases are really indispensable to PLAN-
TERS, EXPLORERS, MISSIONARIES and Others.
Mr. H. M. Stanley, in “ The Congo,” vol. ii., pp. 325 and 327, says “ They (the
Tabloids) keep well in all climates, and are unaffected by heat and moisture ; ” and
in “ Darkest Africa ” he says: “ Every drug was in Tabloids, mixed with quick
solvents ; every department was well stocked with essentials for the doctor and
surgeon. Nothing was omitted, and we all owe a deep debt of gratitude, not only
for the intrinsic value of these chests and excellent medicines, but also for the
personal selection of. the best that London could furnish, and the supervision of the
packing, by which means we were enabled to transport them to Yambuya without
damage.”
The British Medical Journal reports : “ Surgeon Parke has personally
informed us that the Concentrated Preparations and Tabloids
retained their efficiency throughout the whole journey, and were
of the utmost value by reason of their efficiency and portability.”
Mr. W. S. Caine, M.P., in his work, “ Picturesque India,’’says ; “The Compressed
Drags of Burroughs, Wellcome & Co. are thoroughly reliable. I showed some I had
taken round the world, and afterwards to India and back, to a distinguished physician,
who, after a careful examination, pronounced them as good as ever ; they were then
three years old. A whole medicine-chest of these Tabloids can be packed into a
small cigar box.”
Sir William Moore, in his well-known book, “ Diseases of India and their Treat-
ment,” gives a list of Tabloids and Valoid Extracts suitable for residents in India. The
Indian Teak Chest, fitted complete, according to his list, is suitable for any country
station.

ENGLISH MANUFACTURES & AUSTRALASIAN TRADE
CHAPTER I.
HISTORY OF TRADE DEVELOPMENT IN THE
AUSTRALASIAN COLONIES.
Particulars of Imports and Exports.
When the vast area of Australasia (covering 3,100,000
square miles) is considered in connection with the enormous
variety and importance of its natural resources and the rapid
increase of its population, which already borders on 4,000,000
of European descent, the possibilities of the future trade of
the seven great antipodal Colonies with England may be
regarded as practically boundless. The object of the present
brochure is to afford such information to the manufacturers
of the parent country in reference to Australasian commerce
as may assist in developing Direct Trade between them and
distributors in Australasia, in the interests of both. The
Avhole tendency of British mercantile organisation in relation
to distant markets is to supersede the middleman, with the
result of securing better prices to the manufacturer on this
side, and a considerably reduced cost to the buyer on the
other.
The author is on a widely different footing from the great
majority of Avriters on trade subjects in weekly periodicals
dealing with Australasia for the edification of British
readers. He must also be distinguished from the bulk of
London advertising agents, who undertake to guide English
manufacturers and others in spreading their advertisements
over Australasian newspapers. He has an intimate personal
acquaintance with the business requirements of nearly every
Colony in the group, extending over many years. While
most of the editors and writers referred to are confined to
mere second-hand knowledge derived from books, news-
papers, and occasional interviews with Colonists visiting
this country, the present writer has been privileged to
reside long, and travel extensively in the Colonies. His
duties as a member of the Australasian Press brought him in


close and constant contact, in the Colonies, with people
engaged in every leading department of trade, and he thus
claims to possess qualifications for directing manufacturers
both as to the classes of goods likely to obtain a ready sale
in Australasia, and as to those advertising mediums through-
out the Colonies, which are best fitted to serve their
interests.
If the imports alone, including those from one Australasian
colony to another, have grown, in a single century, from a
few articles for the supply of a small convict settlement to
consignments amounting to about £70,000,000 at the present
time, the expansion of the same division of trade in the
future cannot fail to be watched with interest by the manu-
facturers of the United Kingdom, and to constitute to them
an increasing source of profit.
Foreign countries notably the United States and
Germany—already realise the stupendous magnitude which
the total of Australasian trade must soon attain, and have
entered the competitive lists with irrepressible and per-
sistent energy, to win as large a share of it as possible. If the
fellow-subjects of the Colonists in this country are to make
sure of that substantial portion to which they are entitled,
they must at once exchange apathy on the subject for in-
domitable zeal and enterprise. They must spare no effort in
bringing their names and their productions under the notice
of consumers at the Antipodes, and adopt, in prosecuting
business to the utmost, a system of direct representation.
New South Wales. —This pioneer settlement, which
to-day contains the largest population of any Australasian
colony, and which stands on a more solid basis of productive
wealth, than any other member of the group, inaugurated
European civilisation and commerce on the Australian
Continent in 1788, under peculiarly unfavourable conditions.
The first settlers, 1,030 in number, chiefly comprised in-
voluntary exiles from English prisons. The cargoes of the
ships which conveyed them consisted of the stores required
for their use. Towards the end of the first year of Colonial
existence, the Colonists were reduced to the verge of starva-
tion, and vessels were sent to Cape Colony, Batavia, Java,
and the South Sea Islands, in search of provisions ; but as
these could only be procured in small quantities, the infant
Colony soon relapsed into a state of semi-starvation, and
every one, from the Governor downwards, was placed on
short allowance. When the lowest ebb of distress was
reached, three ships laden with stores from England
brought timely relief. Four years from the start of the
Colony, the first trading vessel made its appearance in an


Australasian port. The brigantine “Philadelphia,” hailing
from the United States, dropped anchor in Sydney harbour
with an assorted cargo for sale. About the same time, coal,
which has proved to be one of the main sources of wealth in
Great Britain, was discovered at a place which has since
become the seaport of Newcastle, about 70 miles from
Sydney. So potent a factor has this mineral become in
enriching New South Wales, that its annual output now
amounts to about £3,000,000 per annum. The first year
of the second decade of colonial existence was signalised
by the opening of the sandal wood trade with Fiji. To this
was added the introduction of cocoa-nut oil and trepang.
The first year of the present century was marked by the
arrival of the merino sheep, which has ever since furnished
the staple export of Australia. At the same time, the first
cargo of coal was exported, its destination being the Cape
Colony. The valuable qualities of New South Wales cedar
becoming known, this species of timber came into general
use about this period, locally and for export. Boat-building
was begun, but this latter industry was long hampered by
an absurd Colonial law, which prohibited the building of
any vessel by private individuals, whose keel exceeded four-
teen feet.
Meanwhile, Sydney was rapidly becoming an important
commercial centre, especially as a port of call for vessels
engaged in the whale and seal fisheries, and the contraband
trade of the Western Coast of South America. The trade
with the South Sea Islands and China also began to
assume considerable proportions. By the end of the second
decade, local manufactures were initiated on a small scale ;
the Colony became possessed of a fleet of vessels, mostly
engaged in coasting and whaling, and within the same
period the first shipment of wool was made to England,
although in quality it was heavy and coarse compared with
exports of this product which took place after the superior
fleece of Spanish sheep subsequently predominated, under
the able and successful efforts of Mr. MacArthur, of Camden,
to improve this, the chief of Australasian resources.
Beyond quiet and steady improvement there is no feature
of moment to record in the trading interests of New South
Wales in the immediately succeeding ten years. But at the
-end of 1821 very general progress characterised the whole
Colony. The population numbered 30,000. The public
revenue averaged more than £1 per head ; roads and bridges
were multiplied in the Colony, and during the twelve
months ending January, 1824, sixteen ships left Sydney and
Hobart for London, of an aggregate burden of 5,500 tons
and with cargoes valued at £lOO,OOO. - * h


The wealthier settlers were rapidly gathering around them
comforts and luxuries, as well as bare necessaries, while
manufacturing, agricultural, and pastoral pursuits were
extending in all directions. The shipping, inwards and
outwards, totalled 166 vessels, with an aggregate of 41,000
tons. At the end of the third decade there were 67 vessels
owned by Sydney merchants, from 15 to 360 tons burden.
In the year 1828 occurred the first great commercial crisis,
caused principally by over-speculation in sheep and cattle.
This grave visitation was intensified by a drought which
lasted three years, and raised prices of provisions of all kinds
to an exorbitant figure. Sixty years ago, 54 mills, 84 fac-
tories, and other works were in full operation in the Colony.
At the same period, 70 whales were killed annually by the
whalers of Sydney, on the New Zealand Coast, and as many
as 37 Sydney whaling ships were counted in Cloudy Bay at
one time. In 1832 the first steamer ever built in the Colonies
was launched, and in the same year the first steamer from
England arrived. Trade received an impetus by the forma-
tion of the Australian Steam Conveyance Company. 320
vessels arrived and departed from the chief seaport in the
year just mentioned, and the collective exports rose to half a
million sterling, the value of the whale oil then exported
being considerably larger than that of wool.
At the end of the first half century of Australasian
colonisation, the Colonists had increased by births and
immigration from 1,030 to 132,000. They had brought
under cultivation 174,000 acres of agricultural land, and
owned 28,000 horses, 600,000 horned cattle, and 4,000,000
sheep.
The total import and export trade of the settlements of
Australasia exceeded £2,000,000 sterling per annum, and
although the imports still, as might be expected, exceeded
the exports, yet their respective values were rapidly approach-
ing equality. Besides the articles of export already named,
there were now added ambergris, tallow, hides, horns, flour,
wheat, maize, dairy produce, bark, and skins of native
animals.
The fifth year of the second half century witnessed the
advent of financial and commercial disasters on a scale
immeasurably more widespread and severe than the one
which had occurred fourteen years previously. The dark
cloud did not pass away for two years, and was long
remembered as “ bad times.” While the depression lasted,
the imports of New South Wales in two years shrank from
£2,500,000 to <£1,300,000, and the exports likewise were
considerably reduced. So acute was the crisis in 1843, that
Mr. Wentworth, a Sydney merchant, wrote ; “ Unless some


remedy be provided, the five or six millions of sheep in the
Colony must be turned into the wilds of the bush to be eaten
by savages and wild dogs.” Prices of stock fell to the lowest
limit. When the gloom was at the worst, however, a squatter
at Yass, a Mr. O’Brien, made the fortunate discovery that
about six shillings’ worth of tallow could be obtained from
each sheep by boiling down. As whole flocks were then
freely sold as low as eighteen-pence per head, the value of
the discovery may be easily imagined. The advance in the
value of live stock which followed relieved the pressure
under which the squatters, merchants, and traders had
suffered. In 1844 the exports exceeded the imports for the
first time in the history of the Colony, and the same
experience occurred in the following twelve months. Prices
of wool rose, importation of general commodities was
resumed, and trade recovered its former sound condition.
In the years 1838-47 the population of the Colony more
than doubled, and despite the blow inflicted by the crisis
above described, the growth of new industries and agri-
culture seem to have kept pace with the increase.
In 1846 a movement was started for the establishment
of regular steam communication between England and
Australia, at the suggestion of Lieutenant Waghorn, whose
name has become imperishably associated with the overland
route, via the Red Sea, to India, Up to this date, sailing ves-
sels alone had been employed, the passage between London
and Sydney seldom occupying less than four months, and
often a very much longer period. The mail route proposed
was via Trieste, Singapore, Batavia, and Torres Straits.
The inhabitants of Sydney eagerly supported the scheme,
and their agitation soon led to the desired end. The Colony
now has trade relations with nearly every civilised nation,
and its growing productiveness is shown in a notable excess
of exports over imports. Nearly 1,000 vessels, of an aggregate
burden of half-a-million tons per annum, entered and cleared
from the ports of New South Wales.
In 1851 a powerful impulse was given to every branch of
local industry, beyond the anticipation of the most sanguine,
by the discovery of gold in the mountains of New South
Wales. Rumours of the finding of the precious metal arose
as far back as the first year of the Colony’s existence. In
1840, Count Strzlecki expressed his conviction that gold was
obtainable in certain districts of the Colony. This view was
subsequently endorsed by the Rev. W. B. Clarke, “thefather
of Australian Geology,” and in 1844 by Sir Roderick
Murchison. Gold was actually found in the Port Phillip
district three years later without much public notice being
attracted to the subject. But the origin of gold mining as a


practical industry dates from the 12th February, 1851, when
Edward Hammond Hargreaves, a returned miner from
California, was struck with the geological resemblance of
that State to Australia, and began to search for gold in the
dry bed of Lewis Bond Creek, a small mountain watercourse
in the Colony. A few months later gold was taken in
quantities from several creeks in the neighbourhood, includ-
ing a nugget weighing eight ounces.
Immediately afterwards, 1,000 persons were engaged in
working the soil in the bed of a single creek, and many
nuggets were unearthed, from £5 to £2OO in value. A few
weeks had only passed when an aboriginal shepherd,
employed on a sheep station, discovered a lump of gold
lying on the surface, weighing a hundredweight, and worth
about £4,000. The effect of the gold fever produced by this
exceptional find was to paralyse all ordinary industries and
bring trade temporarily to a standstill. The amount of wool
exported was reduced by one-half as compared with the
previous year. The imports of New South Wales rose to
£1,900,000, and the exports to £4,600,000, of which latter,
however, £2,660,000 represented gold. In 1857 the
population had increased to about a third of a million. In
the same year the number of vessels entering and leaving
the Colony was 2,304 of 728,500 tons burden, and the im-
ports reached £6,729,000. Five years later there occurred
the largest export of wool yet made by New South Wales
alone, comprising 37,000,000 lbs., valued at £2,830,000. Five
years later still the shipping further advanced to 3,972
vessels of 1,373,700 tons, and the imports to £7,624,800, the
latter exceeding the exports by nearly one half. In
further evidence of the general prosperity, the bank
deposits reached £6,883,100, 204 miles of railway had
been constructed, 3,567 miles of telegraph wires were
erected, and 1,146 factories of all kinds were in operation.
In 1877, as compared with ten years previously, imports,
exports, and tonnage had nearly doubled, bank deposits were
about £10,000,000 higher, the extension of railways and
telegraphs trebled, and although the output of gold had
declined, the total value of the various minerals and metals
reached £2,233,000.
Coming down to the present time, the exports and imports
together amount to about £50,000,000, being respectively
in 0 almost equal values. In the port of Sydney there is a
daily average of about 75,000 tons of shipping, sailing
vessels and steamers included, the daily average of tonnage
at Newcastle being 38,000 tons. The largest value in imported
goods from any one country comes from the United Kingdom,
whose annual shipments to Noav South Wales reach about

£9,000,000, the exports to the mother country approximating
an equal amount.
Following in the order of value, Queensland comes next
with about £5,000,000 sent to New South Wales, and
£1,800,000 received therefrom; Victoria with £2,500,000
sent, and £5,500,000 received; South Australia about
£2,000,000 sent, and £3,000,000 received; New Zealand
£1,200,000 sent, and £500,000 received. Next ranks the
United States with £1,100,000 sent, and £1,200,000 received.
Germany follows with £600,000 sent, and nearly an equal
value received.
It is of vital moment for British exporters to notice that
the two countries last named show signs of a firm determina-
tion to contest the ground in Australasia, inch by inch with
Great Britain, as regards trade competition. In timber, iron,
steel, cotton, and woollen fabrics, carpets, bacon, boots and
shoes, watches, etc,, the United States are advancing by leaps
and bounds compared with the pace at which these manu-
factures move in England ; and the States already take the
lead among foreign countries in exporting to Australasia.
As regards Germany, the rate at which she continues to
compete with British manufacturers in all the Australasian
Colonies, as w*ell as in foreign countries, is nothing short of
formidable. This may be inferred from the general extent
of her progress as an exporting nation. In ten years the
total value of the German exported manufactures rose 157
per cent. In that period her net exports of silk rose 884
per cent., woollens 296 per cent., cottons 302 per cent.,
machinery 260 per cent., glass 264 per cent., paper 322 per
cent., spirits 258 per cent., beer 446 per cent. ; pig-iron,
from a net import of 280,000 tons, to a net export of
151,080 tons ; and sugar, from a net import of 247 tons, to
a net export of 565,247 tons. To Australasia, within the
same decade, imports from Germany increased no less than
346 T per cent., while from the United Kingdom, the rate of
increase was only 32T per cent. The relative values of the
principal imported articles for a recent year are as follows :

Bibbs’ Ministry passed a pro-

is generally anticipated that this policy will be completely
reversed at the next General Election,
Victoria.— On the 15th February, 1802, the bay of Port
Phillip was discovered by Lieut. Murray, and the surround-
ing district afterwards included in the Colony of Victoria.
About a month later this region was formally taken posses-
sion of by the Sydney Government. Subsequently, the river
Yarra, on which Melbourne now stands, was first seen by a
white man. An attempt was made in 1805 by Lieut. Collins
to colonise the Port Phillip district with a cargo of convicts
from England. But a site (close to where the watering-
place of Sorrento is now situated) being chosen where the
land was poor and fresh water scarce, the project was
abandoned in the following year.
The first permanent settlers within the boundaries of
Port Phillip were the brothers Henty, who came from
Tasmania in 1834, and established a whaling station at Port-
land Bay, which now forms a thriving town on the south-west
coast of Victoria. John Batman, a native of Parramatta, in
New South Wales, who spent the greater part of his life in
Tasmania, united with thirteen others in the purchase of a
small sloop, in which, after a nineteen days’ voyage, he
entered Port Phillip with a view to settlement. He negotiated
a grant from the natives of 600,000 acres of land, which how-
ever, the Imperial Government, under advice from the
18
Origin of Victoria.


Governor of New South Wales, refused to confirm. John
Pascoe Fawkner followed Batman from Tasmania in the
following year with five associates, Batman being the pioneer
on the Yarra, and Fawkner, the founder of Melbourne.
By the middle of 1836 the population numbered 170, and
owned 5,000 sheep and a number of cattle and horses, which
were depastured on the plains stretching towards Geelong
and Sunbury.
In the same year the new settlement was duly recognised
by the Sydney Government. In 1837 the Governor of New
South Wales paid the new Colony a visit, which was rendered
memorable by the site and plan of Melbourne being decided
upon. Already Port Phillip had commenced an export trade
in wool, tallow, and hides, the wool being valued at about
£12,000 in the first year it was exported. In 1839 Melbourne
became a free warehousing port, although, as yet, it could only
boast a single wharf for the accommodation of shipping. The
facilities for loading and unloading being restricted, no vessel
was allowed to remain alongside the wharf for a longer period
than six days, as the berth might be wanted for a fresh arrival.
The population of the settlement, almost immediately,
reached 3,500. Imports, in the year last named, rose to
£205,000, and the exports to £78,000, chiefly in connection
with pastoral pursuits. With rare prophetic insight, a Tas-
manian newspaper alluding to the bright hopes which were
formed of the new Colony, wrote of it thus : “ It is by no
means improbable that, at some future day, Port Phillip will
rise to be the queen of the Australasian Colonies, and that
Tasmania will become merely a place of resort for its wealthy
inhabitants.”
Owing to the scope for the employment of money so
greatly exceeding its supply at this period, almost the entire
business of Melbourne was transacted on credit. The settlers
on the coast turned their attention to shipbuilding and ship-
ping ; and in 1841 the first two vessels were constructed,
locally, of 136 tons register, while nine others were registered,
aggregating 413 tons. The population in a year increased
150 per cent., to 10,000, and the imports equalled £4O per
head, while the exports increased 65 per cent, compared
with those of the previous twelve months. When, how-
ever, the bills on which most of the purchases of land
and merchandise had been made fell due, and it was found
there was no money to meet them, a panic ensued, goods
and properties alike being sacrificed under financial pressure.
Sheep which had cost as much as £5 a head Avere sold as
low as two shillings a head, including the “ station ” or
“ run ” on which they were shepherded. Goods sent out
on speculation from England became almost unsaleable.


Imports declined in 1842 40 per cent., and in the following
year they sank to a considerably lower point.
In 1844, the darkest year in that long interval of depression,
they were little more than a third of what they had been
three years previously, although the population had doubled
in the same period. To add to the prevailing troubles, wool
had been steadily falling for some years in the London
market, and but for the boiling down process already
referred to, the ruin to the squatting interest would have
been inevitable. But the importance of that interest in 1847
appears from the fact that, out of a total of £700,000 in exports,
£648,000 represented wool and tallow. At that date traces
of dull trade had passed, ship-building and the erection of
houses were renewed with vigour, agriculture was extended,
imports and exports expanded, and the same year was
specially notable for the proclamation of Melbourne as a city.
In 1851 two events occurred which were destined to
•exercise a momentous influence on the future of the Colony.
Previous to that year Port Phillip was subject to the juris-
diction of New South Wales, but then the province was
separated and was raised into an independent Colony under
the name of Her Majesty the Queen. On the very day
when the separation was celebrated, Esmond, as a dis-
coverer of auriferous wealth, did for Victoria what Har-
greaves had done, shortly before, for New South Wales.
He found gold in the quartz rocks at Clunes, and soon
..afterwards at Anderson’s Creek, a few miles from Mel-
bourne, These discoveries were quickly succeeded by
others at Ballarat and Bendigo, and \ the excitement which
seized the male population in consequence knew no bounds.
At the close of 1851 the population was 98,000, but six years
later it had grown to 463,000. In 1851 the number of ships
arriving in Hobson’s Bay was 427. Two years afterwards
they numbered 2,594, representing 721,500 tons. In the year
following the value of the imports amounted to nearly
£18,000,000. The total exports in 1857 were more than
£15,000,000, of which, of course, the bulk was gold.
In 1856 the European and Australian Navigation Company
engaged to carry monthly mails between Melbourne and
Southampton, and shortly afterwards the Peninsular and
Oriental Company took over the contract and continued the
service.
At the end of a decade from the date last mentioned we
find agriculture in a flourishing condition, and the wool
exported 198 per cent, greater in weight, and 186 per cent,
greater in value, than previously. The area under agricul-
ture had increased 165 per cent., while the grazing lands of
the Colony were largely appropriated, and railways were


constructed with Government loans—raised chiefly in Eng-
land—to mining and agricultural centres ; banking assets, a
vital test of prosperity, had advanced to £15,800,000, and
telegraphic communication was formed between Yictoria
and Tasmania.
In 1889 the total vessels, inwards and outwards, numbered
5,741, of 4,599,178 tons. In 1890 the total imports to Victoria
from different countries amounted to £19,453,871. Of this
£9,607,193, or 41-85 per cent., was received from England
£6,569,987, or 28-63 per cent., from New South Wales..
Chief among foreign countries, as a source of Victorian
imports, as in the case of New South Wales, is the United
States, which contributes £1,069,297, or 4-66 per cent., and
immediately succeeding, in the order of value, is Germany
with £682,166.
Despite the shortsighted and mischievous system of Pro-
tection, forced upon the Colony by imperfectly informed
and incompetent politicians in order to placate a consider-
able section of demagogues, as ignorant as themselves, for
the purpose of securing Parliamentary election, the imports,
are very various in character. The heaviest items are
timber, sugar, iron in many forms, hardware, steel, cotton,,,
silk, haberdashery, apparel, coal, machinery, beer, spirits,,,
wine, cement, oils, leather, boots and shoes, uncut printing-
paper, bags and sacks, agricultural implements, preserved
fish, preserved fruit and jams, maize and corn flour, nuts,
glass, and glass bottles. These imports are given, as nearly
as possible, in the order of their respective values, but, for
want of space, numerous others are omitted.
Exports consisting of the products of the soil have for
some years shown a downward tendency, owing to the
attractions offered to farmers by town life, which has been
rendered abnormally lively by the expenditure of large sums
of borrowed money, on public and private account, and by
protected industries. But the recently appalling financial
collapse, especially in Melbourne, by which thousands have-
been ruined, and thousands more thrown out of skilled
employment, has been attended with the happy result of
directing more general attention to the soil as a sphere for
the profitable application of energy.
But for the total production of £230,000,000 in gold taken
out of Victorian mines and put in circulation, £43,000,000
expended in public works, and, at least, half the latter sum in
private loans and investments received from abroad, the evils;
of protection would have been practically revealed long ago.,
The strong efforts made by Sir Graham Berry, the present
Treasurer and arch-Protectionist in the Shiel Government,,
to hamper the import trade of Victoria by oppressive duties,,


amounts to fiscal insanity. The tariff increases he has carried
have rendered him as notorious in the Southern Hemisphere
as McKinley is in the United States. But the result must
inevitably be an ultimate revulsion in the public mind
against the outrageous follies of Protection.
New Zealand. —The islands included under this desig-
nation, standing next to Victoria in population, seem
entitled to consideration in this place, with special reference
to their trade development. They had been joined with the
other territories at the Antipodes in 1777, as available for
settlement under proclamation by Royal Commission, in
virtue of the sovereignty established by Cook, In 1808
several white men took up their residence in the Middle
Island, and the Australian whaling vessels had begun to use
the ports of the North Island for refitting and obtaining
fuel and fresh water. Many sealers were, at this time, per-
manently settled in New Zealand, and such was the enter-
prise shown by them that in 1814 they built a vessel of 150
tons burden at a place called Dusky Bay. In 1825 a
company was formed in London for the colonisation of New
Zealand, and, in the following year, about 60 persons pro-
ceeded thither under its auspices.
Flax was a leading article of export from New Zealand in
the “ thirties,” the nearest market of importance for it being
Sydney. In 1814 the Church of England Missionary Society
established a mission at the Bay of Islands, and they were
followed, in 1822, by the Wesleyans at Whangaroa, and in
1838 by the Roman Catholics at Kororareka. Traders from
the older Colonies established agencies at several places on
the coast, and many whaling and timber stations were
formed. In 1837 the New Zealand Company petitioned the
British Government that they should be incorporated by
royal charter with power to colonise the islands. Two years
later the Company sent out an expedition under Colonel
Wakefield, which chose for their first settlement Port
Nicholson (now Wellington). By the end of 1840 the popu-
lation was over 1,200, including immigrants from Australia.
Captain Hobson, who had been appointed “ Consul to and
Eventual Lieut.-Governor of the Colony of New Zealand,”
under the Governor of New South Wales, established in the
same year another settlement in the North, which was
named Auckland.
In 1840 the treaty of Waitangi was made, by which the
principal native tribes ceded the sovereignty of the islands
to Great Britain. In the following year the Company
founded New Plymouth and Nelson, But, unfortunately,
the progress of the settlers was interrupted by differences


with the Home Government, and the outbreak of the Maori
war in 1845, which imperilled the very existence of all
European settlements in New Zealand. An addition to the
population of the islands took place in 1848 by the founding
of Otago. This scheme was undertaken by a Scotch Com-
pany, under the auspices of the Free Church of Scotland,
co-operating with the New Zealand Company.
In 1850 a settlement was formed by the Church of
England at Canterbury. This made up, in all, six settle-
ments in New Zealand, three in the North and three in the
South Island, and the Colonists soon zealously applied them-
selves to pastoral and agricultural industries, for both of
which the climate and the soil were found singularly
favourable. The population increased in the decade 1858-
1867 from 50,000 to 219,000. Cattle trebled, and sheep
multiplied eight times their number at the beginning of this
period, to 8,410,000 at its close. Exports, also, which
amounted to £458,000 at the beginning of the ten years,
rose to £4,644,700 at the close. A corresponding increase
occurred in imports, which advanced within the same
period from £1,141,300 to £5,344,600.
In 1861 gold was discovered at Tuapeka, in the province
of Otago (South Island). This was speedily followed by
finds at Coromandel, near Auckland, in the North Island,
and, still later, rich deposits were unearthed at Hokitika, on
the sand beaches of the West Coast, and, to a much smaller
extent, near Wellington.
The richest year in New Zealand gold mining was 1866,
when the value of the precious metal realised was
£2,844,500. At the same time there is little doubt that the
progress of white settlement was materially retarded by the
unfortunate Taranaki war, which brought the Maoris and
the Colonists into collision in 1860, and lasted four years. A
further check was given to Colonial expansion and the
development of internal resources by the war with the
natives, which broke out eight years later. Notwithstanding
the ill-feeling of the Maoris towards the settlers for years,
consequent upon the defeat of the powerful chief Te Kooti
in 1869, population rapidly increased, as likewise did the
area under cultivation, and the number and value of mineral,
metallic and timber resources. It cannot be said that the
disturbing influences of the Maori rebellion were entirely
at an end till 1887, although during the previous fifteen
years they had not been formidable compared with the
experience of the twelve years preceding 1872.
The population of New Zealand is now 650,000, and its
public revenue about 4J millions sterling. Its shipping has
reached 1,500 vessels, and 1,320,000 tons. Its imports amount


to about £6,290,000, and its exports to £9,800,000. The large
excess of the latter over the former presents a feature of
commercial improvement in the history of New Zealand
worthy the imitation of the other Colonies in the group.
In the thirty-three years ending 1887, the total mineral
products exported were valued at no less a sum than
£50,108,000, the two leading articles being gold (£44,843,600),
and Kauri gum £4,686,500. The value of the coals exported
was £264,400, and of silver £124,800. The other items in-
cluded are chrome ore, copper ore, antimony, manganese,
mixed mineral ores and coke.
The staple exports, in addition to those already mentioned,
are wool, frozen meat, flax, and wheat. The imports are
much of the same description as those of the Colonies
already dealt with.
The Colony has unquestionably suffered from reckless
Government borrowing in the English market. The result
is, that in some respects, the taxation imposed to meet the
interest charges on a debt of £38,000,000 is enormous.
Indeed, the proportion of public revenue derived from
heavy import duties being exceptionally high, the influence
of these duties upon trade is adverse, and must continue to
operate unfavourably till either the Colonial debt is consider-
ably reduced, or the tax-payers are greatly increased.

Queensland. — Captain Flinders, in 1799, discovered the
Moreton Bay district, which has since become a portion of
the colony of Queensland. The Brisbane River debouching
into Moreton Bay was first seen in 1823 by Oxley, and was
found navigable for many miles. The Moreton Bay settle-
ment was founded in the following year. It was not,
however, till seven years afterwards that special, attention
was directed to Moreton Bay. The Bremer River was then
traced from its junction with the Brisbane to the site of the
present town of Ipswich, which was at first called Limestone,
owing to coal and limestone being discovered in quantity
near the latter place. In 1845 Sir Thomas Mitchell was
commissioned by the Imperial Government to find a port
suitable for the shipment of horses to India. He discovered
several new rivers, and reported vast tracts of splendid
grazing country in what is now known as Central Queensland.
The Colony now under review remained an appanage of
New South Wales till December 1859, when by an act of
the Imperial Legislature it was erected into a separate Colony
under its present name, with Brisbane, then a town of 7,000
inhabitants, as its capital. From the date of its separation
the Colony advanced rapidly in wealth and importance, and
soon outstripped several Australian settlements of much.


older growth. Between 1860 and 1867, the population in-
creased 400 per cent, to 100,000, the pastoral industry pre-
dominating. Cotton and sugar cane, however, were found
peculiarly suited to the soil and climate. During the last
American war the former commodity was cultivated at a
handsome profit, and while prices of the latter remained
high, large amounts were invested in sugar plantations.
But owing to the excessive cost of labour both productions
ceased to be profitable. It was from gold, copper, and coal,
that Queensland was destined to derive, for a time at least,
the largest share of advantage. To say nothing of the
auriferous mines at Canoona and Rockhampton, Mount
Morgan and Gympie can be quoted among the auriferous
wonders of the world, and already the aggregate gold
returns of Queensland considerably exceed those of Victoria.
Imports rose between 1860 and 1867 from £742,000
to £1,747,000, and exports from £523,000 to £2,198,600,
and the shipping, inwards and outwards, from 383 vessels,
totalling 85,000 tons to 936 vessels with a tonnage of 295,000.
During the same years the deposits in the banks rose
from £287,000 to £869,000. The General Government
Revenue grew in proportion. The population of Queensland
is now about 400,000. In 1890 its total gold production was
610,000 ozs., against 581,000 ozs. raised in Victoria, and its
tendency is still towards the leadership in this department of
Australian mining.
Three consecutive bad seasons, however, have thinned
materially its flocks and herds. It is indisputable, moreover,
that its trade is somewhat severely affected by the mercantile
crisis which at present prevails throughout the Colony. Its
imports have temporarily receded to little over £5,000,000,
these being very similar in variety to those of New South
Wales ; but its exports—over £6,000,000 —are by no means
unsatisfactory, although cotton has practically ceased, for the
time being, to be included among them. Still it is expected
that the re-introduction of Kanaka labour, on a large scale,
under the aegis of the law, will greatly aid in the revival of
both the cotton and sugar industries.
RaiLvay, telegraphic, and other public works are quickly
extending. Owing to the credit of the Colony, however,
being temporarily depressed in the London market, no more
money can, for the present, be borrowed for railway
construction, and the Government has passed a Bill for the
making of lines on the land grant system of payment instead
of money.
South Australia. —In 1834 an Act had been passed in
England authorising the formation of a Colony on the


following principles : —No free grants of land ; proceeds of
all land sales to be devoted to the introduction of free
emigrants, and the extension of facilities of inter-communica-
tion ; the Government of the Colony to be self-supporting,
and in no way a charge upon the Mother Country. This
new Colony, founded under these conditions, was South
Australia, Kangaroo Island being the first of its settlements,
but this location proving unsuitable, the Colonists were
removed to Holdfast Bay, on the mainland, now called
Glenelg. The landing took place in 1836, the population at
that date being 546. Within a very few years of the founda-
tion of the Colony extreme depression occurred, and English
merchants and shippers having lost heavily in consequence
by their operations, curtailed their shipments. Through
scarcity of money, and of articles of local production, the
goods imported by the Colonists could not be paid for.
Speculation in land appears to have occupied the time and
money that should have been devoted to such solid
reproductive industries as land culture and pastoral pursuits.
The lesson was laid to heart, and reproductive industrial
undertakings were begun in earnest. Wool, wheat, and
flour were largely exported, and copper and lead figured in
the list of exports. In twenty-one years, the copper exported
Avas valued at £4,000,000. The amount of profits paid to
shareholders in the Burra-Burra Mine in the period was
equal to £315 for every £5 share. The year 1848 was a
prosperous one for the Colony, the exports having risen to
£504,000, or £120,000 in excess of imports for the same
period. But the surplus was almost entirely due to the
large amount of copper raised in the Colony. In 1850
ship-building had become an industry of considerable
importance. The total tonnage in that year was 483 vessels,
19 vessels having been built within the Colony since its
foundation. In common with Tasmania and Western Australia,
South Australia suffered much by diminished population,
due to the gold fever which caused adventurers to gravitate
towards the newly discovered gold mines of New South
Wales and Victoria. Nevertheless, a recovery in numbers
took place in 1857. The wealth and enterprise of the Colony
received a strong impetus from the discovery and working
of the rich copper mines of Wallaroo and Moonta, and, on
the whole, the third decade of the Colony’s existence was a
period of general prosperity. The value of wool, minerals,
and bread-stuffs exported was much enhanced. In the ten
years, 1857-67, the population increased from 110,000 to
173,000, and the exports from £1,744,300 to £3,164,600. In
1863 the export of wine showed marked progress, and the
revenue from sheep, cattle, horses, and wheat-fields was large,


while the merchants of Adelaide owned 123 vessels of a
registered burden of 15,229 tons. The gradual decline
which took place in copper mining resulted in the more
extended development of pastoral and agricultural resources.
The annual export of wool was more than £1,000,000 higher
than it had been ten years previously, and the ratio of
increased wheat exported was hardly less remarkable. In
1872 a telegraph was completed 1,800 miles from Adelaide
to Port Darwin on the shores of the Northern territory,
across a desert for the most part stony and trackless, one of
the greatest works ever undertaken in Australia. It may be
mentioned that South Australia is far ahead of all the other
Australasian Colonies in the extent of acreage under
cultivation, considerably over 3,000,000 acres being now
under crop. Of this area, about two-thirds are under wheat,
the remainder being under hay, green fodder, potatoes, and
farm produce generally.
Viticulture has also firmly taken root as a prominent
industry, there being about 5,000 acres exclusively devoted
to grapes. The present population is 320,000 in the entire
Colony. The value of the imports is between £5,000,000
and £6,000,000, the chief portion being sent from Great
Britain. The exports have of late years been usually in
excess of the imports, and about two-thirds of the former
in value are shipped to England. The shipping, inwards
and outwards, has risen to about 1,900 vessels of 1,750,000
tons burden.
About 250 sailing vessels and 93 steamers are owned in
the Colony. The enormously rich silver mines of Broken Hill,
although situated in New South Wales, have contributed an
important addition to the wealth of South Australia, owing
to Adelaide being more accessible than Sydney as a port of
shipment, and some of the largest shareholders are residents
in the province. The conveyance of silver to Adelaide, and
of stores from Adelaide to the mines, has brought a great
increase to the traffic of the local railways, enabling them of
late years to pay the whole of their interest on the portion
of the Public Debt expended on the construction and
maintenance of the lines as it falls due, leaving a good
surplus to the credit of general revenue.
Tasmania. —Before New South Wales was 20 years old,
the majority of the settlers, who were engaged in agriculture
and sheep farming, were beginning to feel inconvenienced
by the limited extent of arable and pasture land then known
to exist in the parent Colony, and many attempts were made
by them to find new country suitable for their industries.
Endeavours to cross the mountains, which up to that tim e


veiled from their knowledge the magnificent and fertile
Darling Downs, had failed, and a small party of settlers
embarked for Tasmania, then known as Yan Diemen’s Land.
They landed at Risdon, in the estuary of the river Derwent,
and there proceeded to form an agricultural colony.
In the same year Lieut. Collins, who had unsuccessfully
tried to find country in which to locate a cargo of English
convicts in the Port Phillip district, transferred the people
under his charge to Tasmania, and they joined the party
which had only just preceded them from New South
Wales.
The hostility of the natives, however, compelled the whole
settlement to move to a more secure position, now occupied
by the city of Hobart. The Sydney Government despatched
later a third party, who took possession of the locality on
which Launceston now stands. Yet another party of
Colonists were placed on territory about fifteen miles from
Hobart, called New Norfolk, in memory of Norfolk Island,
which the New South Wales Government had resolved to
vacate as a penal settlement. Hobart became a centre for
the sale of oil brought by whaling ships, which were also
refitted in the same port.
In the five years, from 1812 to 1817, the population of the
island had advanced from 1,500 to 3,100, and in 1821 it had
further increased to 7,400. In the following year a con-
siderable number of immigrants arrived from Leith, in
Scotland, under the auspices of a Company formed in that
seaport.
They brought with them a capital of £lOO,OOO for the
purpose of carrying on the business of receiving the produce
of the Tasmanian settlers in return for merchandise, an
advantage which the young Colony did not fail to appreciate.
In 1835 Tasmania was separated from New South Wales, and
soon afterwards became a self-governing Colony. The year
1840 was a period of exceptional prosperity for the island, as
the new settlements of South Australia and Port Phillip
continued, from the date of their formation, to provide
markets for the disposal of stock and produce. Agricultural
products were obtained chiefly from Tasmania for the supply
of the surrounding Australian Colonies, and many large
fortunes were made by those who took advantage of the
high prices then ruling.
Exports of whale oil, timber, grain, flour, hay, and other
staple products increased enormously in quantity and
value.
The number of vessels arriving at Tasmanian ports in 1846
was 332, representing 37,455 tons. In the year following
bark and wheat were sent to England with profitable results.


On the other hand, the produce of whale fishery seriously
fell off. Again, the predominance of land culture in Tas-
mania constituted an important source of wealth to the
inhabitants, when the gold excitement occurred in New
South Wales and Victoria.
The vast influx of population from all parts of the world
on that occasion, and the withdrawal of farmers from the
accustomed occupation,, created an immense demand for
articles of food, and Tasmania assisted largely in supplying
it, together with sawn hard wood for building purposes in
Melbourne.
In 1853-4 the trade of the island colony attained its
maximum, the exports in the former year being £1,756,300,
and the imports in the latter year £2,604,700. At the close
of 1857 both exports and imports had fallen off considerably
and continued to decrease. The public revenue receded in
proportion, and the coin in circulation shrank about 50 per
cent. A corresponding decadence was noticeable in the
shipping returns, and excessive depression prevailed all
round. The first gleam of revival was visible in 1871, when
the metallic and mineral resources of the island began to
excite special attention, the most notable discovery in this
department being the famous Mount Bischoff, with its
extraordinary deposits of tin. In 1877 the value of the tin
exported for the year was £300,000. The export of gold
doubled in the same period, and Tasmania entered on a fresh
career of prosperity. The export of tin has reached of late
nearly half a million, and the export of gold £150,000. The
exports of wool amount to more than £400,000, the popula-
tion being about 150,000. Great importance is attached
to the promising silver lodes of Mount Zeehan and
the coal deposits of St. Nicholas and Cornwall. The
export of orchard fruit in the season is already assuming
such magnitude that ocean-going steamers proceed from
Sydney to Hobart to load with fruit for England in the
season.
Western Australia.—A new settlement was founded
in King George’s Sound, in 1828, by the New South Wales
Government, who sent Major Lockyer with a detachment of
soldiers to form a military post in that place. This after-
wards became the Port of Albany, the coaling station for
steam vessels to and from England and the Australian
Colonies. The year 1829 saw a second settlement formed in
Western Australia. Mr. (afterwards Sir) Robert Peel com-
bined with some of the principal Sydney merchants, and
founded Swan River, on the West Coast. Within two years
of its being proclaimed, 55 ships arrived, bringing 1,125


immigrants and cargoes to the value of £145,000. The
embryo capital was named Perth, and the port Free-
man tie.
This rate of progress, however, was not long maintained,
and immigration to Western Australia practically ceased foi
a considerable period after the first quarter of 1832. Mean-
while the military post established at King George’s Sound
was transferred to the Swan River, and for some time the
trade returns show nothing but imports. The poverty of the
Colonists caused enterprise to languish.
Such are but a portion of the numerous obstacles which
have retarded the development of Western Australia beyond
that of any other colony. Trade continued to decline, and
not until twenty years had elapsed after the origin of the
settlement did the Colonists begin to reap the reward of
their patient labour. Even till 1857 no brighter prospects
had dawned upon them than those of the barest subsistence.
Their number, as yet, was under 1,400, in a colony equal to
one-third the territory of the United States of America, ex-
cluding Alaska. In the year just mentioned, however, twelve
lead mines had been opened. In the ten years immediately
following, the increase in the population was only 9,000. In
1867 there were not more than 50,000 acres under cultiva-
tion the staple exports being wool, lead, and jarrah timber.
Up to the present the most important exports next to wool
are pearls and pearl shells, which have collectively reached
from £126,000 to £130,000 per annum.
The shipments of wool in 1890 realised £771,422, and
timber of various kinds about £IOO,OOO. Nearly one-half
the imports, amounting in all to £1,000,000, came from
England, and embrace as great a variety of articles as it is
possible to conceive. Within the past five years the dis-
covery of rich alluvial and quartz diggings has proved a
more powerful attraction to population than any ever pre-
viously presented by the Colony.
Only as recently as 1886 was the first small parcel of gold
exported, amounting in value to £1,207. Rich discoveries
of the precious metal have been made at Kimberley, the
Murchison, the Ashburton, and other rivers in the north-
east section of the country. Reefs have been traced in a
continuous line from Mount Magnet and Austin Lake for
hundreds of miles to the South Coast, including the promis-
ing district of Yilgarn, in which a number of quartz mines
are being profitably worked.
In 1891 the declared value of the gold exported, as re-
turned at the Customs, reached £120,000, and it is expected
that the returns for the current year may be from 50 to 100
per cent, higher. Many hundreds are gradually entering


the mining and agricultural localities, and a great accession
of imported merchandise must follow.
The seven Colonies of Australasia, despite the incompetent
Parliaments and Governments possessed by several of them,
cannot fail to grow steadily in population, and their growth
will necessarily be accompanied with an increasing demand
for goods which the manufacturers of the United Kingdom
can advantageously supply. Full particulars of their require-
ments can best be learned from the Government Blue Books
of the several Colonies, which can be obtained through the
Agents General, whose offices are in Victoria Street, West-
minster.

The Seven Colonies.


CHAPTER 11.
PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE.
Origin and Growth op Protective Tendencies in the
DIFFERENT COLONIES.—THE PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE
op Protection on Australian Prosperity.
The fiscal question in Australia first became the subject of
popular discussion in 1859. The occasion was the foreseen
decline in the enormously rich alluvial diggings which had
been discovered in Victoria nine years before. This dark
outlook for miners was soon realised, the result being that
many thousands, who had left skilled trades in the parent
country to join in the general search for gold, were reduced
to the necessity of agitating for the creation in the Colony of
those technical handicrafts to which they had been previously
accustomed in their native country. A minority of those
who had been compelled to abandon the gold digger’s occu-
pation, from the cause just referred to, tried the experiment
of tilling the ground, or engaging in some other pursuit
foreign to their early training and associations. Usually,
however, the effort ended in failure. Here and there the
tailor, the coach-builder, the painter, the cabinet-maker, or
the engineer, who ceased to find work at the diggings, took to
sheep or cattle farming, agriculture, or road-making. In
rare instances, however, was the change of employment
crowned with success. The problem, therefore, pressed for
solution : How can men familiar with different skilled in-
dustries find scope for their trained powers in a new country
unless special means are taken to establish the industries
they know best ? The working classes almost universally
demanded a solution of the difficulty by urging upon their
rulers the adoption of a protective tariff against all manu-
factured imports which could be produced by Colonial
labour. The slower but sounder idea did not, unfortunately,
lay hold of the uneducated masses, namely, that those
industries which the physical conditions of the Colony
showed to have the surest prospect of being profitably con-


ducted should receive chief attention. It is noteworthy that
at the beginning of the fiscal controversy no educated man
in the country favoured Protection, For ten years Yictoria
was converted into a great debating club on the subject, and
when the better class of politicians, who were at first on the
Free Trade side, began to waver, there is little doubt that their
change of mind was not caused by argument; it was rather
due to considerations of party expediency. A section of the
public leaders sought political power at almost any prite.
Instead of boldly and honestly combating the tariff fallacies
with which ill-informed stump-orators were misleading the
working classes, and with which they were sowing the seeds
of economic error, loss and suffering, to be reaped by their
victims, these self-seeking politicians “ swallowed ” their real
principles, grovelled to the crowd, and professed belief in
the system of Protection.
Up to the date above mentioned, and for more than thirty
years afterwards, New South Wales prospered without im-
posing a protective tariff. Even now the opinion of the
highest political authorities in the latter Colony is that the
retrograde step taken by the Government of Sir George
Dibbs in imposing protective duties will be reversed at the
next Parliamentary election. Although the import duties
levied in South Australia, New Zealand, Western Australia,
and Queensland are higher than they ought to be, they have
only been imposed thus far for revenue purposes. But the
working men of Victoria and the demagogues Avho sway
them were too impatient to allow local industries to develop
gradually, as the need for them came to be felt. The rational
determination to adapt themselves to their altered circum-
stances did not apparently occur to them. The simple notion
was foreign to them that they should turn their attention to
the cultivation of products which their soil and climate
would enable them to raise far more advantageously than
was possible in any part of the Northern hemisphere. Their
acquaintance with political economy was too slight for them to
know that by giving their chief strength to exports, for which
there is an inexhaustible market on this side of the world,
they could buy their imports most cheaply, purchasing them
with their exports. Thus, under Free Trade, they could make
profit on the latter and save on the cost of the former. From
both these sources wealth would have rapidly accumulated.
It would have been far more evenly distributed throughout
the community by the petit culture on a large scale of export-
able articles than it could be by skilled industries planted
in towns disproportionately populated. Nor would pro-
tected industries necessarily employing a limited number
of hands at best, in a small population, ensure better


wages—that is, wages having a greater purchasing power—
than are obtainable in a country in which Free Trade predo-
minates. But the senseless theory which triumphed with the
demagogues, and which forced the political power-hunters
into surrender, was that which, alas ! has beguiled, to their
injury, the rank and file of the working classes. I refer to
Protection. While New South Wales was subject to Free
Trade, the average wages of the working classes not only had
a higher purchasing power, but the average rate paid to men
in all branches of handicraft was distinctly greater than it is
in Victoria under Protection.
There can be no doubt that the Protectionist movement in
Victoria was greatly stimulated by the well-known passage
in J. S. Mill’s “ Political Economy,” in which the author
so fatally weakened the force of his arguments in support
of general Free Trade by conceding that it was permissible
for a young country to enforce a protective tariff for the
express purpose of building up local industries, after which
Protection could be dispensed with. But the eminent
economist was only a theorist, and had no opportunity of
testing his theories in practice. A residence in a Protectionist
country Avould soon have undeceived him as to the supposed
ease with which Protection, once established, can be replaced
by its opposite. Nothing short of the felt injustice and
disaster, which sooner or later Protection entails (as when
the toiling masses of England were reduced to penury and
want by that system for years before the passing of Sir
Robert Peel’s Free Trade measure in 1846), will force it to
relax its hold. On the contrary, its exactions grow from
one degree of unreasonableness to another, until hardly a
single import is allowed to escape its fangs.
Previous to the imposition of protective duties in Victoria
in 1865 (the first Australian Colony to deviate from the
noble Free Trade example set by the parent country),
Customs duties had only been levied on spirits, ales, to-
bacco, tea, sugar and coffee. As none of these articles could
be absolutely deemed necessaries of life, orthodox Colonial
Free Traders, early in the Fifties, did not consider it unfair to
tax them for revenue. But the pioneer offender in fiscal
matters was a Mr. (afterwards Sir) George Verdon, who was
entrusted with the responsibilities of Colonial Treasurer
while yet a young man barely out of his teens, and wholly
dependent for any slender knowledge of political and fiscal
questions he had picked up upon a little desultory reading.
He had no wide experience of finance, or of mercantile
business. He possessed no remarkable abilities, and beyond
a little amateur interest in art, he has never throughout life
showm special financial ability, although he was subsequently


pitchforked by a fortuitous concourse of circumstances into
the position of manager of the bank of which he had been
a director. Mr. Yerdon was reminded, when proposing his
Protective Budget in the Legislative Assembly, by members
of the Opposition, who had mature commercial experience,
that Melbourne was destined to be a great mercantile em-
porium, and that Protection would kill its commerce and mar
its prosperity. For a few years the prevalence of this latter
view checked the progress of the Protectionist party. But
an increasing army of mob orators, finding that the misguided
masses had strong leanings towards Protection, flattered their
vanity, and climbed up to power, and ultimately to pay, on
their shoulders. The contention of the Free Trade Party
was that the commerce of the Colony was already sound and
prosperous under their fiscal policy. But their opponents,
who waxed more and more violent, were carried away by the
false assumption that Protection would infallibly multiply
local manufactures in the interest of the poor. The actual
outcome of Protection, however, has been that a few em-
ployers have been enriched at the cost of the working classes,
who pay the bulk of the high duties imposed by Protection,
and who work at a lower scale of wages than obtains in Free
Trade populations. Moreover, the industries it was intended
to promote artificially are still in a state of helpless infancy.
Some of them have declined in proportion as duties were
raised, and, as a rule, the goods which a prohibitory tariff
was meant to exclude have been imported in steadily in-
creasing quantities. The Free Traders fought with unflagging
courage till 1866, when they found themselves outnumbered.
From the following year the position of the Colony com-
mercially has been that of a young giant, whose forward
movement has been impeded by fetters. Yictoria has
advanced solely in spite of Protection, and not because
of it.
To the credit of the Legislative Council be it said that its
members repeatedly rejected the protective measure attempted
to be passed by the Lower House. The Assembly, represent-
ing demagogues and their followers, claimed the right to tack
the new Bill to the ordinary money Appropriation Bill of the
year, but the Tipper House resisted this attempt to abolish
Free Trade as a breach of the constitution. As the popular
Chamber insisted on passing the obnoxious measure tacked
to the ordinary Appropriation Bill, the two Houses came to
a deadlock. For months the civil servants of the Crown
were obliged to remain unpaid, and the only way in which
money could be released from the Treasury to pay them was
by their first suing the Government for the discharge of their
claims in the Supreme Court. Judgment being confessed,


the Court had no alternative but to give a verdict in favour
of the plaintiff. After prolonging this conflict for the best
part of a year, the Legislative Council, convinced that its
members were out of harmony with the majority of Parlia-
mentary voters in the country on the question, reluctantly
passed the protective tariff for the sake of peace. Meanwhile
the Governor of the day, Sir Charles Darling, was charged,,
and probably without sufficient reason by the Imperial
Government, with taking sides with the multitude in the dis-
putes, and recalled in consequence. But it is unlikely that
Protection would have taken such deep root in Victoria had
its establishment not been associated with excessive party
excitement and so many dramatic incidents. Besides, in
the latter phase of the controversy the main question was
obscured, and drifted into a totally irrelevant issue. The
Upper House, which sought to retain Free Trade, was
denounced by the mob-leaders as an oligarchy which
endangered the people’s liberties, and the persistent refusal
of that House to sanction Protection was held to be equiva-
lent to an attack on the rights and privileges of the people’s
representatives, and, it was affirmed, this attack must be
opposed to the bitter end in their interests.
The first effect of Protection in Victoria, when duly
recognised as “ the settled policy of the country,” was the
immediate growth, to a limited extent, of manufacturing
industries in the clothing department, including the manu-
facture of boots and shoes. But it was soon found that, as
in the treatment of physical ailments, so in the body-politic,
the fiscal medicine approved by the masses, while benefiting
one complaint, was. certain to aggravate, if not actually to
produce, another. The farmers met and resolved that the
new tariff would be unfair unless protective duties were
imposed on cereals. The tanners thought the duty put upon
leather was too low. On the other hand, the saddlers were
content with the duty on saddles, but wanted the duty on
leather to be wholly remitted. The clothiers and hat manu-
facturers protested that all duties on materials used in the
making of their goods should be removed. So in scores of
instances industrial derangements became apparent, which
noisy and superficial Radicals, in their hurry, did not
anticipate.
The moderate and discriminating duties imposed by the
original Protectionist Tariff of 1865 continued without
important alterations until 1871, an interval which might
fairly be considered long enough to test their efficacy. Yet
at the latter date the occupations of the city population
wero not materially diversified by the establishment of
new industries, as the advocates of Protection predicted. No


extraordinary demand had been created for skilled labour.
The flow of imports had not been appreciably lessened,
although the latter division of trade had been, undoubtedly,
vexed and hampered by Protection. The Treasurer of 21
years ago, a blind and ignorant votary of the system, attri-
buted the failure of the restrictive tariff, which had already
been in operation six years, to its lacking proper stringency.
Accordingly, he addressed himself to the task of increasing
the volume of protection, which had the natural effect of
further disturbing all trade arrangements. To quote the
Treasurer’s words on the occasion : “To describe the
principle which has guided me in making the division into
10 per cent, and 20 per cent, duties, I may say that among
the articles on the 20 per cent, list are all those manufactures
which are finished or in a forward state for actual use,
whereas the 10 per cent, list consists mainly of progress
manufactures on which a further amount of labour will have
to be employed.” Thus the principal features of the tariff of
1871 were an addition of 10 per cent, to the protective
duties already existing, as well as a similar imposition on
many articles previously free. It is marvellous that the
author of the tariff should fail to see that his course was
most illogical. If he required to increase by 100 per cent,
the duties already in existence, it was tantamount to a
confession that they had all along been inadequate to
keep out imported goods competing with those made
in the Colony, and which were supposed to be pro-
tected. If he found it necessary to sweep all the goods
previously free into his protective net, was a 10 per cent,
duty not likely to be as unavailing to protect them as
it had been in protecting the articles formerly subject to
the same rate of duty ? Mr. (now Sir) Graham Berry,
recently Agent-General for Victoria, in England, was the
Treasurer in 1871. He then indulged the vain confidence
that Victoria, in common with the United States, would
some day arrive at that stage of development when, having
completely fortified herself by protection against foreign
competition, the policy of high duties might be relaxed, if
not abandoned, and an export trade in the protected goods
with foreign countries fostered. As regards America, how-
ever, the answer to these visionary anticipations is the
McKinley Tariff of 1890, and the preposterously high tariffs
passed in Victoria in 1889 and 1892. “We are going to
make a perfect tariff,” said Mr. Gillies, in the former year.
Meanwhile, the protected manufacturers have continued,
unceasingly, the refrain : “ Our trade is languishing, our
workmen are only partly employed ; give us more Protection
or we shall perish.” As Mr. Murray Smith, in a lecture on this


subject, remarks, “ Protection never is but always to be blest.” 1
In 1875, Mr. Service, Treasurer of the Kerford Ministry, was
at heart a free trader ; but on the theory that the majority
must rule, he proposed to strike off the duties from articles
never likely to be manufactured in the Colony, to reduce
from 20 to 15 per cent, the duties on articles which had been
highly protected for some years, and which might fairly be
considered able to compete successfully with foreign importa-
tions. As to articles whose manufacture had not yet been
established in the Colony, but which were capable of being
manufactured locally, he proposed to leave the duties as
they were. These moderate proposals, however, were
rejected by a Parliamentary majority pledged to support the
views of Protectionist demagogues and their plastic allies
among workmen. In 1879, Mr. Berry was once more in the
position of Treasurer. On this occasion his method was
even more drastic on protective lines than previously. The
result was that new industries flocked to the Treasury for
protective support, and any one could obtain it at the cost of
raising prices exorbitantly to consumers by hiring a man
and a boy to work for him in an infant trade. Duty on
corks for example, to select one case out of many, induced
one man to engage in cutting corks, and to employ another
to assist him, and ultimately that other man started in
business for himself. These two insignificant cork-cutting
establishments impose a most unjust tax on the manu-
facturers of aerated drinks by whom they are largely
supported, and the duty on corks still appears in the
Victorian tariff, although the value of rough cork imported in
Victoria is barely £I,OOO a year !
The man who showed such rabid Protectionist tendencies
in 1865, and as Treasurer of Victoria both in 1871 and in
1878-9, is once more head of the Colonial Treasury in the
present year (1892).
During the last six years Sir Graham Berry has represented
his Colony in London, and so insensible does he seem to
have been throughout that period to the splendid results of
Free Trade principles as illustrated in the industrial and
mercantile expansion of this country, that his first act on his
return to Melbourne, after his election to the Victorian
Assembly, and his appointment as Treasurer of the Colony,
was to intensify his fallacious policy of Protection, notwith-
standing its conspicuous failure to produce any other effect
than mischief without intermission for a period of 27 years.
His first Budget speech, delivered on July 28th last,
announced that Customs duties would be increased. At the
same time large additions were made by him to the duties
on wines, beer, and spirits, and to some extent on tea. He


further increased the duties on clothing, boots, and iron-
mongery, thus adding to the fiscal burdens of consumers from
these sources no less than £625,000 in a population slightly
over 1,000,000. He has also imposed heavy stamp duties having
a harassing effect upon trade. Worst of all, Sir G. Berry has
increased what is known as the Stock Tax, an impost which
is specially irritating to the neighbouring Colony of New
South Wales, and which not improbably had much to do in
determining New South Wales recently to adopt Protection
as a retaliatory measure. The Stock Tax, and now its increase,
are undoubtedly sops thrown by the Protectionist Govern-
ment to Victorian farmers in order to reconcile them to the
import duties enforced for the protection of manufacturing
industries carried on in the towns of the Colony. Those
who derive no profit from town or country industries which
are protected, however, are severely mulcted for the support
of both these classes of industries, while the farmer pays
heavily for the manufactured articles, and the artizan is fined
to protect certain pastoral and dairy products. To take a
single case out of many of the hardships imposed on Victorian
settlers by the new Stock Tax, there is the young and
promising settlement of Mildura, situated on the Murray,
a few yards across the river, from New South Wales. The
official Customs return shows that the daily meat importation
into that population amounts to 1,200 lbs. of beef, and as the
tax is now 7s. Bd. per 100 lbs., the consumers in this small
community have to pay £25 per week to the State for the
privilege of purchasing meat supplies. If the fruits of this
elaborate system of trade restriction were realised according
to the anticipations of those who profess belief in it, one
of the first advantages we should expect from it would
naturally be the decrease of imports and the increase of
exports. But statistics show the very opposite of this to have
occurred. The total import in to Victoria of protected articles
in 1866 was £15,000,000. In 1889 it had risen to £24,000,060.
In 1890 the total was £1,400,000 less. Imported woollen
goods, the local manufacture of which is protected by a duty
of over 30 per cent-, increased in the interval referred to
from £701,000 to £969,000 ; furniture from £36,000 to
£149,000 ; apparel and slops from £282,000 to £473,000,
Per contra , exports of Victorian protected articles fell off at
a serious rate ; boots from £40,000 to £16,000 ; woollens
from £12,000 to £2,500 ; apparel and slops from £246,000 to
£98,000. If we compare the first and last years of the decade
1879-89 in respect to exports, we shall look in vain for any
of the boasted results of Protection. The year 1879 was
remarkable as exhibiting a very small export trade, being a
decrease of two and a-half millons in 1878 and three and


a-half millions below that of 1880. Yet, if we compare this
attenuated trade with that of 1889, we find that the exports
of 1879 amounted to £12,454,170, and of 1889 to only
£12,734,734, showing a trifling increase in the ten years of
only £286,564, the value per head having fallen from
£l4. 18s. Bd. in 1879 to £ll. 10s. Bd. in 1889. In 1890 the
total exports were about half a million better. If we take
the total exports in each half of the decade the result will
appear still more unsatisfactory, while in the first half
of that period the Victorian exports amounted to £80,849,569,
in the latter half they only reached £65,286,721.
Protection claims to enlarge the scope for the employment
of labour, but,' tried by this test, it is found 1 wanting. In
sixteen protected Victorian factories the hands declined
from 15,128 in 1883 to 12,495 in 1890, while in Melbourne,
abundantly enriched as it is supposed to be by the special
advantages of Protection, there are only 13,000 more hands
than in New South Wales. Out of these by far the greater
number are understood to be women and children who
constitute mainly the hands employed in the industries
which owe their existence directly to Protection. The other
industries carried on would have sprung up in Victoria, as
they have done in New South Wales, in a normal and healthy
manner, without any artificial aids whatever.
For the support of about 10,000 persons, chiefly women
and children, who are solely indebted for their employment
to Protection, Victorian consumers, as a whole, pay about
£2,800,000 in restrictive duties, tending gravely to obstruct
the freedom of commercial exchange, and, consequently, to
diminish the volume of Colonial wealth. But this is far
from exhausting the financial sacrifice exacted from the
citizens by the policy we condemn. The importer charges
an average of 25 per cent, profit on the large amount of duty
above specified, as well as upon the invoice value of the
goods with freight, insurance, dock dues, and other costs
added. The profit of the retailer may be estimated at an
additional 35 to 40 per cent. This would make the total
extra charges upon the duty 60 per cent., which would
represent £1,680,000, and this, added to the duty, gives in
round numbers £4,480,000, which a population of 1,140,000
is compelled to pay for the luxury of conferring wealth
upon local employers of labour, who enjoy the lion’s share
of benefit, and of providing a poor wage fund for the small
and feeble fraction of the population, who are supplied with
work directly by a protective tariff. The few following
tabulated examples, out of many, of the difference in
prices of ordinary articles of consumption in Protected

introduced by the Bibbs’ Government—speak for them-
selves :
Now, in regard to wages, Protectionists affirm that these
are higher in protected countries as compared with those in
which Free Trade rules. But, as a matter of fact, the very
reverse is the case. Subjoined is a table showing a scale
of wages furnished by leading trades unionists in the
Colonies:—
Trade. Melbourne. Sydney.
In several cases the rates are equal, and in a few they are
higher in Sydney. Sydney under Free Trade, however, has
decidedly an advantage on the whole over Melbourne in
the above comparison. But, even if the ivages in the two
Colonies were equal , the labourer ivould be in a much
worse position in Victoria than in New South Wales, as
the difference in the prices of articles of ordinary consump-
tion, as quoted above, is nearly 20 per cent. Indeed, the
additions to the tariff under the Gillies-Deakin Administra-
tion so appreciably raised the cost of living, especially to
persons earning small wages, that the Victorian State
Railway Labourers sent a deputation to the Railway
Commissioners to ask for an extra 6d. per day. The


petitioners based their demand on the fact that the action
of Parliament in increasing the tariff had compelled each
of them to pay 3s. a week more than previously for the
bare necessaries of life. They told the Commissioners that
protective Customs duties as they stood deprived them of
no less than Bs. per week, or £2O. 16s. per annum. Other
classes of State servants demanded an increase from the
same cause.
The protective system is further discredited by the
hindrance it opposes to settlers tilling the soil and reaping
adequately the fruits of their labour. There was actually
a smaller area of land under cultivation in 1890 than in
1884. This decline in rural industry is not entirely due to
the capricious inducements offered by Protection to draw
the country population to the large towns in the hope of
getting plenty of artizan work and good pay. It is equally
owing to the fact that Protection raises the price of
everything the farmer buys, and diminishes the price of
everything he has to sell. It can easily be demonstrated
that a farmer cultivating 150 acres of land has, on an average,
to pay £3l. Os. 6d. per annum more for articles necessary to
the support of his family and household than he would
under Free Trade. When to this burden is added the extra
cost of his plant, wagons, implements, &c., it will be found
that the total result of protective duties, as regards what he
purchases, is equivalent to a charge of 7s. 4d. per acre per
annum more than would have to be paid if Protection were
abolished.
Thus far Ave have only dealt, with the
effect of this system on Avhat the farmer buys. There is
almost a corresponding loss on Avhat he sells. The sparse
population of most of the farming districts, caused by the
Avithdrawal of many settlers to the toAvns, increases the
railway freights on grain and other produce in these
districts. The shipping freights on grain are raised by
Protection, the system being expressly contrived to lessen
imports. FeAver ships in consequence arrive, and facilities
for exporting produce to England are proportionately
restricted. From this cause freights in Melbourne are
increased, at intervals during the year, by 12s. 6d. per ton,
which is equal to a tax of per bushel of Avheat exported,
so that the collective burden on Avhat the cultivator of 15(1
acres buys and sells amounts to about 13s. 7d. per acre
cultivated, or £lOl. 17s. 6d. per annum.
Another important evidence of the criminal Avaste for
Avhich the same fiscal policy is responsible appears in the
enormous loss to the Colony incurred to the adverse effect
the system has on the purchasing poAver of the forty odd


millions sterling borrowed by the Government and chiefly
expended on public works. These loan moneys are largely
used to support local industries in carrying out the public
works, often regardless of the efficiency of the articles locally
manufactured and always regardless of the lower cost at
which they can be produced of better quality in England
and exported to Australia. A remarkable correspondence
took place a few years since between the Melbourne Harbour
Trust and the Premier of Victoria, which shows in a clear
light the influence of local protection in enhancing prices of
heavy apparatus connected with public works procured with
Government loan moneys subscribed in England. The
subject of the correspondence was a protest from the chief
officers of the trades unions in Melbourne against the
Trust for buying their dredges in England instead of con-
structing them in Victoria, thus encouraging local manu-
factures. The Harbour Trust Commissioners addressed the
head of the Colonial Government as follows : “ The
contract time for the Government hopper dredge . . . which
was constructed in the Colony was eighteen months, but she
was not delivered until two and a-half years. Her cost to
the Government was £51,000, and it is known that her
builders sustained a heavy loss on the work. She is inferior
in dredging power to the Trust's dredge ‘ Crocodile ' which
was delivered in Melbourne (from England) for the sum of
£22,700, three months after she was due." The Commis-
sioners proceed to state that in the case of the dredge last
mentioned the Colonial tender teas 54 per cent, more than
the English price , six months' valuable time was lost in
the experiment , and the dredge had ultimately to be built in
Scotland."
Imperfectly informed Protectionist Treasurers quote, ad
nauseam , the example of the United States of America in
defence of Protectionist principles. But there exists the
indubitable evidence that the States prosper, not because of
Protection, but in spite of it. Besides, it must not be for-
gotten, that although the Great Republic is Protectionist
against the outside world, it comprises upwards of forty
States and Territories, numbering 63,000,000, which carry on
the most unfettered Free Trade among themselves. To this
there can be no possible analogy in the experience of Victoria
or any other Protectionist or quasi-Protectionist Colony in
Australia.
The attitude of Victoria or New South Wales as pro-
tected Colonies towards each other and towards other
Australian Colonies is as ridiculous as the case would be if
Lancashire were to protect itself against Yorkshire, and
Yorkshire against Lancashire. The conduct of Victoria and


New South Wales in relation to each other and the sister
Colonies is nothing short of economic insanity, notwith-
standing what interested proprietors of the misleading
Protectionist daily Australian prints may affirm to the
contrary.
In reference to New South Wales, it can safely be said that
the Protectionist Tariff, introduced into that Colony early in
the present year (1892), cannot fail to retard the satisfactory
progress which that Colony was making in every department
before the recent retrograde change in the tariff took place.
It is obvious that the new Protective Tariff is a mere bid by
the Bibbs’ Government for the support of the direct repre-
sentatives of labour in the Legislative Assembly, who
mustered in strength at the last election far beyond what
had generally been looked for, forming about one-third of
the entire membership of the Lower House. This is the key
to the political situation in New South Wales. Ministers
knew that they could not retain their seats for a single day
without deferring to the wishes of so strong and determined
a body of its supporters. But diplomacy required that an
arriere pensee should displace a statement of the naked truth.
Accordingly, the Governor’s speech ascribes the necessity of
adopting a protective tariff to the unfavourable condition in
which the Government had found the public finances
“ which demanded an immediate and solid addition to the
revenue.”
If Sir George Bibbs thinks that strengthening the financial
position of New South Wales in the London Market can
best be accomplished by surrendering the only sound
basis on which a progressive trade can be carried on, and
adopting an effete and mischievous fiscal policy in its place,
he proclaims to the world his total incompetency for ad-
ministering the finances of the Colony. The test of Colonial
Government credit in England is the readiness with which
the subscribing public, as distinguished from intriguing
syndicates, come forward when a Government loan is placed
openly on the market, and when capitalists are invited
through the Press to put their money into it. But there is
a widespread belief that when the next triennial parlia-
mentary election takes place in New South Wales, the chance
victory Avon by the Protectionists at the last election will be
reversed, and the Free Trade policy, Avhich has never been
disturbed in New South Wales till recently, Avill be reha-
bilitated. If, on the other hand, there be anything that can
prevent the commerce of Victoria from being hopelessly
strangled by Protection previous to its total abandonment by
the Avorking classes (who must sooner or later be rudely
aAvakened by the groAving exactions it imposes upon them


beyond the burdens it casts upon the wealthier orders), it
will be the fiery discipline through which Victoria is now
passing owing to the recent land-booming mania. One
happy result of the false prosperity in which Melbourne has
basked of late years, from the enormous influx of borrowed
capital from England on Government and private account,
but which is now exploded, is that much of the artificial
activity and enterprise thus induced is at an end. Tens of
thousands of bread-winners are thrown out of employment
in the large towns, and all who can will be compelled to
turn their attention to the cultivation of the land. The result
of increased land culture will appear in due time in a large
increase of exports, including dairy produce, orchard fruit,
wine, raisins, olives, tobacco, hops, cereals, frozen beef and
mutton, etc. If the rural population extends and the urban
population declines to the point of merely what is needful
for the supply of town wants, present suffering will prove
the seed of future and solid expansion in wealth and
happiness.
As regards the other Colonies, there is hardly an exception
to high duties, although in all cases, except the two above
mentioned, these duties are levied for revenue only. There
is not much to choose between South Australia, Queensland,
and West Australia in their respective scales of Customs
duties on the whole. The least onerous duties for the
present in the Australian group proper are those contained
in the Tasmanian list. Not a few of the New Zealand
duties are heavy, although there is hardly an instance in
which an import from abroad is excluded from that
Colony, or any other in Australasia, by the pressure of
Customs taxes, whether it is manufactured in the Colonies
or not.
It will be desirable for British manufacturers and others
who seek to cultivate direct trade with Australia to exercise, at
present, the utmost caution in opening accounts by correspon-
dence, or through agents, while the prevailing stagnation of
trade continues. At the same time, it appears probable, from
the most trustworthy information obtainable, that the worst
stage of depression is already past. If so, the time may be
considered favourable for tentative efforts to develop busi-
ness in the mercantile centres. It may be stated, for the
guidance of manufacturers and other exporters in this
country practically unacquainted with Australian markets,
that there is a plethora of banking facilities, there being about
sixteen banks of issue having either their chief offices, or
their branches, in Australia or in London. The Exchanges,
hitherto, have been against Australia, and in favour of
England, that is, when money is sent out. Occasionally,


in the Wool Shipping season however, when the supply
of bills may exceed the demand, the opposite effect occurs.
As a rule, if the customer is drawn upon from England, the
operation is just as if the money were sent here from Aus-
tralia. The Exchanges vary according to the amount
remitted, but the average rate is about per cent., although
it is often higher in Sydney and Brisbane than in Melbourne.
Trade between Australia and Europe cannot fail steadily to
improve, and British exporters who are early in the field,
and aim only at doing a judicious business, will reap the
largest harvest of profit in the end.

CHAPTER 111.
DIRECT TRADE WITH AUSTRALASIA.
(PART FIRST.')
Australian Tastes in Aeticlbs of Consumption,
and how British Manufacturers should Adver-
tise their Wares.
While the majority of British manufacturers who do
business with the Australasian Colonies are ever ready to
admit that existing methods of commercial intercourse are
far from being satisfactory, and that the adoption of a
properly devised system of direct trade might lead to a large
increase in the volume of business transacted, yet, with a
conservatism peculiarly English, they seem reluctant to
make any departure from established custom in this regard.
Either it is that they are afraid that such an innovation
would involve a complete or partial severance of their
present wholesale connections in the Antipodes, and prefer
“ a bird in the hand to two in the bush ” ; or their inertness
and apparent diffidence are due to inexperience and a lack
of knowledge in respect of the requirements and conditions
■of Colonial trade, particularly in relation to the means best
calculated to foster it and promote profitable intercourse
with these far-off commercial fields.
As matters stand, it cannot be said, except in isolated
instances, that British manufacturers are efficiently repre-
sented out there by capable and energetic agents. Nor do the
firms or individuals who represent English houses confine
themselves, as a general rule, to the work of pushing the
goods of one house. The majority of them represent a very
large number, not only of British, but of Foreign manufac-
turers, many of them dealing in and making the same class of
goods. One may see in the show-room of a hardware agent
ten or twenty different kinds of (say) filters or lamps, a
dozen different brands of revolvers and guns, the manu-
factures of twenty or thirty Sheffield cutlers, and so on. The
same argument applies in the case of soft goods agents,
though, perhaps, less generally, and, indeed, to other classes
of agents. These representatives, for the most part, work on
commission, and this circumstance alone argues an inability
on their part, since they act for so many, to serve all manu-
facturers with the same amount of energy and zeal. And if
it be added that greater prominence is given in their show-
rooms to the display of some manufacturers’ goods and


show-cards than to others’, it may be reasonably inferred that
some houses allow better terms than others to Australasian
agents. Hence, presumably, the houses that allow the best
commission are those best represented. As a rule, such
British manufacturers as allow agents liberal advertising
expenses, over and above a substantial commission, complain
least of their Australasian turnovers. But it is only a very
small minority indeed who allow advertising expenses.
The rule is to allow a commission, which is expected to cover
not only advertising, but incidental expenses as well. This
system has its disadvantages. No agent cares about laying
out his own money for somebody else’s benefit, with the off-
chance of getting it back again, with interest, in the remote
future. Prospective commissions, however tempting, afford
but little inducement to agents to invest their money in
a speculative means to a speculative end. If advertising
be necessary—and it is invariably necessary in the Colonies,
as is shown in another part of this treatise, —it should be
done through representatives of the newspaper advertising
mediums, and not through agents of manufacturing and
exporting firms.
While it cannot be expected that agents out there
should pay for any necessary advertising out of their
own pockets—that is, if they are to serve British manu-
facturers loyally and well, —yet it is undesirable, for many
reasons, that they should be annually allowed fixed sums
for purposes of this kind. Without going into minute
detail, it will, perhaps, be sufficient for the present purpose
to state that the agent who represents (say) fifty firms, and
receives an annual allowance for advertising expenses from
each, cannot hope to do justice to all unless he advertises
the manufactures of each separately and singly. But this is
rarely done. It is the custom of some of these agents to take
a certain amount of space, quarterly or annually, in leading
papers, and to crowd into it the names of all the firms whom
they represent, thus :
MESSRS. BROWN, JONES & ROBINSON,
Little Collins Street,
MELBOURNE,
Are Agents for the following Firms :
Dunville & Co., Belfast (Irish Whisky) ;
John Robertson & Son (Scotch Whisky) ;
Huntley & Palmers (Biscuits) ;
Price’s Patent Candle Co. ;
Richard Kell & Co. (Newcastle Grindstones);
The Rossendale Belting Co., Manchester ;
Burroughs, Wellcome & Co. (Patent Medicine Manufacturers) ; '
The United Alkali Co. ;
The Torbay Paint Co.;
Bullivant & Co. (Wire Rope Manufacturers.)
And so on. Of course, the above firms are taken at random,


merely for the purpose of illustrating the point at issue, which,
however, may have no relation to their case. It is patent that
this sort of advertisement is not calculated to augment, to
any very large extent, the sale of any of the firms’ goods
above enumerated. Such announcements are seldom, if ever,
read, much less when they appear in organs the chief aim of
whose proprietors—who vie with one another in issuing
oppressively ponderous sheets, large enough, on occasion, to
paper the walls of a small villa residence —would seem to be
the production of the best pennyworth (or two-pennyworth)
avoirdupois.
It is extremely unlikely that Messrs. Dunville & Co., or any
other firm of distillers, would sell one bottle of whisky more
through the influence of such an advertisement as has just been
described. Not one man in a thousand whose eyes happened,
while scanning his morning paper, to rest for a moment on
such an announcement would be likely to put on his hat and
repair to the nearest hotel to “ sample ” the whisky, the
recommendation that it had been matured in the cellars of
the first house in Belfast notwithstanding.* Nor is it
probable that the name would ring in his ears so pleasantly
all day as to induce him to order a case from his wine
merchant, to “ sample ” in the evening by his own quiet
fireside. A displayed advertisement, drafted by an expert,
might, however, have this effect One, for example, some-
what after this fashion :
THE COURT BLEND.
The Whisky of the Nineteenth Century.
A Perfect Scotch Whisky ; Ten Ybaes Old ; deliciously
mellow ; pure and soft as new milk.
As supplied to the West End Gluts of London,
and to the Nobility.
Recommended by the leading Physicians in Europe as
the best and safest beverage, in combination with potash
water, for gouty patients and those aifected with renal
complaint or with other functional derangement.
The Medical Puffer says : “We can honestly recom-
mend this whisky. It will be found highly serviceable
in all cases of gout, or of gouty diatheses, where dif-
fusible stimulants are indicated.”
This is the sort of advertisement that would be likely to
“fetch,” —fetch gouty Israelitic usurers from their stools of
repentance, adipose magistrates from their benches, and
corpulent merchants from their desks to the nearest fount
* Be it distinctly understood that the foregoing remarks are not aimed
at Messrs. Dunville & Co.’s whisky, which has a splendid reputation in the
Colonies, where it is deservedly popular. Dunville’s “ Irish ” and John
Robertson’s “ Scotch ” are household words in Australasia, as here.


of Bacchus, whereat the nectar, so conveniently combining
exhilarating with therapeutic virtues, might be quaffed. It
is advertising of this kind that is productive of the best
results.
The circumstances and conditions of advertising in the
Antipodes are different in many important respects from
those which prevail in England. It is imperative, therefore,
that this department should be entrusted only to experts,
men whose knowledge and experience have been obtained
in Australasia. The majority of English advertising agents,
while fully qualified to pronounce an opinion on the rela-
tive merits of newspapers in this country, very ojiten dis-
play amusing ignorance and incompetency when consulted
about some important Australian up-country medium, the
necessary information concerning which is not contained in
the numerous newspaper directories that are circulated
freely in the United Kingdom. And it sometimes happens
that they do not know even the geography of the country
on the requirements of which they claim to be authorities.
Here is a case in point:—
A gentleman, who contemplated doing some advertising
in Australia, called on an agent the other day for the purpose
of consulting him as to the papers best suited to his require-
ments. In the course of conversation, he said, “ But you
haven’t yet mentioned a Geelong paper ? ” “ Geelong , sir ?”
repeated the astonished agent, with emphasis ! “Do you
want, then, to advertise in New Zealand also? Geelong, you
know, is one of the chief towns in New Zealand ! ” “I
was not aware of it,” sarcastically replied the gentleman,
who happened, since he regularly received letters from a
sister wlio resided there, to know the precise locale of this
important Victorian town, that boasts a population of 26,000
and four daily papers. It is nicknamed “ Sleepy Hollow,”
and is noted for its sylvan beauties and picturesqueness, as
well as for the grandeur of its bay and harbour. It is almost
superfluous to add, that the would-be advertiser straightway
sought the counsel of someone whose geography was
decidedly less shaky.
We cannot wonder at such ignorance, when it is taken into
account that the majority of these agents have seldom been
beyond the shores of England, and have never dwelt under
the Southern Cross —amongst races as far removed from us in
ideas and sentiment, in habits, customs, and manners, as we
are from them by the interposition of twelve thousand miles
of stormy ocean. What is effective here in respect of
advertising may be ineffective there. Quiet, unpretentious
advertisements, such as we come across in English news-
papers, fall fiat there upon a people more accustomed to


sensational effects. Australians are even louder in their
tastes than Americans. Brother Jonathan is surpassed in
love of display, both as regards dress and household decora-
tion. In this respect the Colonists are hardly loyal to
English traditions and to the flag under whose aegis they are
always glad to seek protection. This tendency to copy
Americans appears in particular in connection with the
drama. A second-rate American actress or music-hall
artiste will draw immense audiences in Melbourne, though
she come sans ceremonie; while many talented English
actors and actresses meet with but a cool reception. But we
have other evidences of this tendency. To take one or two
instances at random, it is illustrated in the adoption of saloon
carriages on the railways; in the cable tramway system; in
the “ wide-awake ” and Fenian-like slouch hats affected by
young and old alike ; in the almost universal demand for
Virginia plug and stick tobacco and New York cigarettes ;
in the sensational headings in some newspapers, and in their
“ get up ” and ensemble; in the admiration evinced for the
best American prose and poetry ; in architectural design ;
in the growing disposition to subordinate all else in the
construction of a building to appearance, “ tallness ” and
pretentious design and effect. These, however, form but a
few of the indications of this spirit of imitativeness.
Australians evince peculiarities also in commerce. Take
their preferences in relation to the selection of goods as an
example. It is rather the appearance than the quality that
impresses them ; as long as an article looks well, it is of
secondary importance whether or not it wears well. They
live for the present, Government and people alike, as is
pretty well indicated by their extravagant borrowing, and
leaving it to posterity to pay, at least their public debts.
Price, too, is an element in a bargain that with them weighs
heavily in the balance of selection. Though they wont
have what is out there called “ English shoddy ” at any price,
if they know it, still it is but a very small minority indeed
who will pay the price at which the “first quality” is
ticketed. For instance, while the “ man about town ” might
disdain to wear a seven-and-sixpenny silk hat, yet he would
grudge thirty shillings for one of the best quality if he could
get one for a guinea that would look just as well, from, at all
events, the back of a galloping horse. Australians favour the
price known as “the happy medium” when they go out
shopping.
It is the same with everything, wearing apparel, jewellery,
furniture, machinery, wine, spirits, ale, etc.—everything ex-
cepting, perhaps, watches and horses. Your true Colonial
prides himself on having a good watch and a good nag. He is


generally instinctively a good judge of horse-flesh ; to know
the points of a horse is as much a national heritage with
him as it is a characteristic hobby. And though the
chain which adorns his vest should be steel or silver, you
may depend that the timepiece at the end of it will be, to
use his own expression, “A lat Lloyd’s.” But he is not
quite so particular about the wine or the whisky he drinks,
or the cigars he smokes. He may, perhaps, he able to distin-
guish between Scotch and Irish, and between a Savannah
and a Manila cigar, if he sees the boxes from which each is
taken. But that is all; his judgment ends there. It is
somewhat singular that the Australian bourgeoisie should be
such poor judges of these things, for while they are by no
means intemperate in their habits, they certainly cannot be
considered abstemious in a country where it is the custom
to transact business in the bar-room or the wine-saloon.
If the bargain is opened in the office, it will be clinched in
the buffet. A pipe and a glass are as essential to the proceed-
ing as pen, ink, and paper. If the transaction has been a big
one, and it is not too early on in the afternoon, nothing more
may be done that day. The merchant goes back to his office,
elated at his success, locks up his desk, and repairs, with
sprightly gait and beaming countenance, to his club or to a
neighbouring hostelry, there, perhaps, to spend the remainder
of the day between playing “ Yankee Grab ” with “ mine
host ” and other equally convivial spirits, and imbibing
doubtful liquor. This, be it understood, is not an overdrawn
picture; it is a typical illustration of the Australian “ city
man,” who is not given to doing things by halves. When he
goes in for a little pleasant diversion of this kind, he throws
his whole heart and soul into the effort.
It is doubtful, it may be mentioned in passing, if the
nouveaux inches know any more about wine than they do
about the Fine Arts, and assuredly they cannot be accused of
possessing exalted tastes in this direction, though they like
to be dubbed virtuosi, a word affording them as much comfort
as Mesopotamia did to the old woman under a sermon of
Whitfield’s. I doubt if it were possible to get a bottle of
good French claret in all Australia; not even at the swell
clubs or in the mansions of the wealthy. As for Chateau
Lafite, Chateau Latour , Chateau Pichon Longueville, or
Chateau Margaux —the Grand Vins , bottled at the chateaux,
and bearing the year of vintage on the cork—at from £7 to
£2O per case, these are wines never heard of in the
‘‘Land of the Golden Fleece.” No; Australians cannot be
accounted recherche in their taste for claret. The vin ordi-
naire of the common English restaurant is quite good
enough and expensive enough for their palates. Perhaps


in the cellars of a dozen establishments of the Avell-to-do
classes might one find claret worth 60s, or 70s. a dozen. A
good deal of the native wine is drunk, hence, presumably,
the prevalence of kidney disorders and gout.
The well-to-do, however, do drink champagne, and stock it
in their cellars. Indeed, Australians proudly believe them-
selves to be a champagne-drinking people. This is a little
exaggeration on their part to be sure, but, taking into account
their physical isolation from Western civilisation and prac-
tices, we may in these circumstances pardon it, and allow them
to bask undeceived in their Limbus Fatuorum. On special
occasions they do partake freely of the “ foaming cup,” but
with them it is rather a luxury than an everyday practice.
They would be a little nonplussed, I suspect, if they could
be permitted to see how certain classes absorb champagne in
this country. Moet & Chandon may be said to have almost a
monopoly of the Australasian trade in champagne, that done
by other houses being insignificant in comparison. Yet, I
very much doubt if Mr. Simon, the senior partner of the
English house of this colossal firm, would, if he were asked
for an opinion, credit the Australians with being what might
be termed a champagne-drinking community. I have been
in that gentleman’s office on more than one occasion when a
cablegraphic order from Australia for a couple of thousand
pounds worth of wine has been brought in to him. But,
'per contra , I have also met Mr. Simon coming from the
West End after having sold fifty thousand pounds' ivorth of
ivine in one order.
For the information of such whisky distillers in the United
Kingdom as have expressed astonishment at the demand
only for cheap spirits in a country where “money is no object
and gold is as plentiful as the proverbial blackberries,” I
may state that sixpence is the universal price of a “nobbier ”
of spirits, whether it be diluted with aqua pura or alkalised
with soda-water. Though you ask for and obtain a glass of
“Special,” the charge is no more.* Scotch distillers may
well complain that they cannot place a really high-class
whisky on the Australian market. They have formidable
rivals, too, in the Colonial distillers. The working man and
a certain section above them plank down their sixpences,
and are not, as a rule, very particular about the liquor they
get in return. They receive and imbibe with evident gusto
a glass of fiery spirit that has been manufactured about a
month previously at some insignificant local distillery in the
experimental stages of its career, the age of which is about as
recent as the technical knowledge of the firm that gave it origin.
* Since the late increase of duties on imported spirits this arrangement
has been modified.

DIRECT TRADE WITH AUSTRALASIA.
{PART SECOND.)

and Continental Competition.—Germans succeed
where Britishers fail —lnequalities op present
Systems op Commercial Intercourse. How to
stem the Tide of Foreign Mercantile Invasion
out there. British Manufacturers cannot

the German Manufacturers go to work.
There are many drawbacks to prevailing systems of com-
mercial intercourse with the Australasian Colonies. It is not
my intention to enumerate the shortcomings of indirect, but
rather to indicate, as clearly and succinctly as may be, the
advantageousness of direct trade in contra-distinction.
Opinion would appear to be divided as to the profitableness
of the latter and the need for its adoption. Some manu-
facturers, while admitting the reasonableness of the theory
in argument or on paper, nevertheless profess to believe that,
reduced to practice, it might not turn out so promising ; they
therefore decline to adopt a system that has not been previ-
ously submitted to the ordeal of practical test and whose
claims have not been proved beyond doubt. They aver that
any tentative steps in this direction might result in their
losing such customers as they have already on their books,
and they do not, therefore, feel justified in running any risk
of this sort merely on the suggestion of itinerant newspaper
writers, or of “ Globe-trotters ” who read papers before
Chambers of Commerce on their return from a few months’
sojourn in the Antipodes, Advice that emanates from such
sources is regarded as an argumentum ad crumenam. Such
arguments are weak and illogical, and suggest an inertness
singularly at variance with the characteristic clear-sightedness,
sober-mindedness, and shrewdness of the typical business
man. It is this apathy, these objections, this wrong-
headedness, united, perhaps, to a stubborn conservatism, that


are largely responsible for the present unsatisfactory state of
our business relations with the Colonies in question. The
curious part about this sort of reasoning is that it is singu-
larly out of keeping with the characteristic discernment and
sagacity displayed by these gentlemen in the organisation of
their home trade.
There is, too, a small section of British manufacturers
that professes absolute unbelief in the claims of Direct
Trade. This is composed for the most part of large manu-
facturers of branded commodities, the public demand for
which, perhaps, would not undergo very material alteration,
whatever system of exportation were adopted. For instance,
it is probably matter of indifference to Messrs. Horrocks,
Crewdson & Co., what mode of distribution in Australasia
should be adopted by the generality of English firms. It is
not British, but American competition that this firm has to
fear. There is a growing demand in the Antipodes for the
heavier American longcloths, which in course of time may
effectually oust the English article altogether. This cannot
be checked except by the immediate adoption of direct trade
relations with the small distributors, who, since more directly
en rapport with the consumer than the larger importers, are
in a better position to maintain public preference for the
British article. This is the nemesis that threatens English
manufactured cotton goods in the future. There will always
be a fair demand for Horrocks’ and Crewdson’s longcloths
as long as these manufactures are kept before the Antipodean
public. Every draper is obliged to keep their calico in stock.
The public out there, as here, have become familiar with the
name and the article, and ask for it, just as they ask for
Christy’s hats, or Lea and Perrin’s sauce, or Blackwood’s inks.
This statement, however, needs slight qualification. It must
not be supposed for a moment that a firm can live and
prosper in the Colonies on its name and reputation alone.
This is contrary to fact and to experience. They who bask
in such delusive sunshine will soon feel their Icarian wings
slowly but perceptibly dissolve under the fierce rays of
foreign competition. Any manufacturer who indulges the
vain belief, and acts up to it, that name and reputation are
sufficient allurements to the Colonial purchasing public to
insure a continuance of their custom for all time, will soon
realise his mistake. American and German competition are
too keen and too active out there to propitiate any dignified
stand of this sort. Many well-known British firms have lost
caste through placidly resting on laurels won in the United
Kingdom. And once a firm has lost its hold on the Austra-
lasian public and another has usurped its place, very difficult,
if not impossible, will be the task of regaining its former


footing. It might almost as well whistle jigs to the pro-
verbial milestone, as attempt to contest the ground with any
firm that has successfully supplanted it by virtue of energetic
competitive strategy, even though such rival should be a
foreigner.
I have referred briefly to American and Continental compe-
tition. It is this, rather than competition amongst them-
selves, that British exporters have to fear in the near future.
And it may be worthy of mention in this connection,
as an indication of one of the effects of the passing
of the McKinley Tariff Bill, that one or two English firms
who were at the outset seriously affected by it, have removed
plant and capital to the United States, and are now preparing
to supply their Australian customers from America instead
of from here, as formerly. It is extremely probable, there-
fore, that unless this senseless tariff be abrogated, or at least
shall undergo early revision and reduction, many other
British manufacturers will follow suit, and become, in
course of time, formidable rivals in these Colonies of
their former industrial allies in England. Apart altogether,
however, from possible competition of this sort, there is still
staring British exporters in the face the imposing and dis-
quieting circumstance that the foreigner is rapidly gaining
ground in these far-off fields. There is no mistake about
this. Australasia is overrun with foreigners, with Germans
in particular. The Teutonic tongue is en evidence every-
where. Every province has its German town, just as
every city has its Chinese quarters. Germans live and prosper
where Englishmen would starve. They do not pick and
choose their work, but tackle anything. Farming is, perhaps,
the universal metier of their choice. But they are not, as a
rule, very particular what kind of work they take up. One
comes across them following a plough, herding sheep or
cattle, sinking wells, shearing sheep, boundary riding, road-
making, gold-digging, navvying—doing, in fact, anything
and everything.
They do not, perhaps, make such good handicraftsmen as
their Colonial and British confreres , but, none the less, they
are very industrious and energetic, and stick at their work,
never allowing the festal allurements of the “ grog shanty ”
or the wine-saloon to interfere with their work—praise
which cannot always be bestowed without qualification on
their English co-workers. Germans, moreover, are generally
much better off in the Colonies than their English brethren ;
they always manage to improve their circumstances some-
how. They work longer, and consequently make more
money than the generality of Britishers who knock about the
Antipodes, than whom, too, they live more frugally. They


are, however, somewhat clannish, and do not readily
fraternise with men in their own sphere who hail not from
the Fatherland. On the whole, too, they are well-behaved,
law-abiding and orderly, and manage to keep well without
the walls of prisons and criminal law courts. In the cities,
they make good citizens and hospitable neighbours, and are
generally respected, though they may at the same time be
secretly contemned by the ignorant on national grounds.
Curious to say, all Germans receive the appellation of
“ Dutchmen ” in Australia, a reflection on their race and
country which fires their indignation more perhaps than any
other gibe that could be hurled at them.
I have so far referred only to the German working classes.
The educated and better classes are equally prosperous. They
are to be found occupying positions of distinction in every
sphere of what is termed society. Not only do they radiate
in the social constellation, but now and again scintillate in
the political empyrean as well. Here and there they sit on
magisterial benclaes and fill aldermanic seats with their portly
forms. The German in Australia handles the lancet with
as much skill as, with ease and grace, he wields the mayoral
mace in some important provincial burgh, in which, perhaps,
he has become famous for the excellent quality of the bread
he makes, and has sold for upwards of a quarter of a century
to the townsfolk who elected him. As a municipal and
civic dignitary the honour and distinction sit lightly and
becomingly on him. His Teutonic accent, though not imper-
ceptible, is not always sufficiently pronounced to mar the
rhythm and cadence of his public utterances, which, on occa-
sion, indicate a knowledge and grip ofQueen’s English” that
would do credit to many an educated Englishman. Society
being so cosmopolitan in the Antipodes, Germans are received
in it as readily and with as much deference as the representa-
tives of any other nation, provided, of course, the recipients
of its hospitality and its homage be fairly well-to-do and
observe its due convenances. Especially fortunate are they
in ingratiating themselves with the ladies, who seem always
to prefer their characteristically oleaginous suavity and lavish
adulation to the rugged, though far more sincere attentions
of our own countrymen. At the “ swell ” Australian clubs
the well-to-do German is always respected, is gripped by the
hand with unaffected heartiness on entering, and by reason
of his volatile spirits, his irrepressible facetiousness, and his
child-like naivete, is invariably dubbed a right down good
fellow, and is very popular in club coteries. Of course he
has his own club, where naught but his mother tongue is
spoken. There are German and French clubs in every city,
and these, and the fact that in every town of any importance


may be found a maison doree , a Vienna cafe and a German
buffet or two, unmistakably attest the large foreign population
in Australasia. Two great German and French lines of
steamers contribute, each outward trip they make, to swell
the list of foreign settlers. As I said in an article in the
Manchester Guardian , nearly two years ago, if this increase
of foreign settlers goes on as it has been doing for the last
few years, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to predict
what will be the prevailing nationality of Australians born
in a.d. 1992.
I must now turn from this somewhat irrelevant and pro-
tracted social apergu io questions more practical and pertinent.
Before, however, I revert to a consideration of the best
means of promoting direct trade relations with buyers and
distributors in these Colonies, I must perforce enter upon an
examination of the more important details associated with
the working of present systems and with existing conditions
of trade. As a reference to figures given in another chapter
will show, the collective volume of trade transacted by
British manufacturers by no means represents either the
relative commercial capabilities of the Australasian markets,
or the purchasing capacities and abilities of the Australasian
people. Our trade with the Antipodes is capable of great
expansion. But united effort and a readjustment or abolition
of present systems of mercantile intercourse will be necessary
to the achievement of this desideratum. It is of no use
trying to conceal the fact that the American and the
Continentals are filching our trade from us, and insinuating
themselves and their wares into public esteem. Goods in
which formerly Great Britain did a large business out there
are now almost entirely supplied by German, Austrian, or
American houses.
Look at the trade with America in agricultural and
mining machinery, in machinists’ tools, in sewing-machines,
type-writers, and cash registers, in watches and clocks, in
electrical apparatus, in carriage manufacturers’ and wheel-
wrights’ sundries, in hop bitters and pharmaceutical prepara-
tions, in textile fabrics and clothing accessories, in fictile
manufactures, in pianos, organs, and musical instruments, in
kerosene and oil-stoves, in india-rubber fire and garden hoses,
in gardening tools and farming implements (particularly axes,
pitchforks, spades, shovels, and so forth), in lager beer, in
harness and saddlery accessories, in furniture and chairs, in
tobacco and cigarettes. Germany and Austria, too, follow with
a similarly long list of goods that find their way into
Australasia, to the exclusion, partial or total, of the British
article.
The only way effectually to stem this tide of foreign


mercantile invasion into these, indisputably our own,
commercial territories, is for British exporters to depend
less upon the energies and exertions of agents and of
uncolonised representatives—young men, perhaps, who have
had all the advantages of technical training in England, but
who lack Colonial experience, without which it is almost
impossible that they can succeed in their new sphere of
operations,—and to pay an early visit to this far-off country,
which is to them, at present, at once a terra incognita and a
Tom Tiddler’s ground. Their action, moreover, must be
united. They must band themselves together, and, with
inflexible resolution, drive foreign competitors out of these
markets altogether, as chaff before a hurricane. It is quite
possible to do this now, though it might not be so easy later
on. There must be in the effort an absence of that apathy,
dilatoriness and self-consciousness, that have hitherto
marked the attitude of many British manufacturers towards
Antipodean customers. Great Britain cannot afford to ignore
the Australasian markets any more than she can afford to
lose the custom of small communities nearer home. Accord-
ing to the last Board of Trade returns, exports from the
United Kingdom are £16,000,000 below those of last year,
the principal falling off being in cotton, piece goods, iron
and steel, coal and machinery. Sir John Lubbock ascribed
a considerable portion of this decrease to a fall in prices.
He was, however, singularly guarded in his remarks about
the ill-effects on our export trade of the McKinley Tariff,
and made no reference at all, I believe, to the growth of
foreign competition in Australasia and its baleful influence
on British mercantile expansion out there. Certainly he did
not stop to consider whether any proportion of this decadence
in our export trade might not be due, perhaps, in some
measure, to influences of the kind just mentioned. But
this is quite of a piece with the usual insouciance displayed
by English Chambers of Commerce in their attitude towards
Australasia.
If British manufacturers are altogether independent of, and
indifferent to, what some of their number loftily regard as
the “insignificant trade of a country with a mere handful of
people,” they had better leave it severely alone, and direct
their energies to markets nearer home. Australian buyers are
quite as independent as they. The mere fact that a firm has
been established for a century or more is neither a sufficient
recommendation nor a sufficient inducement, per se, to win
over Australasian patronage; still less enticing is the bait
when it is accompanied by a demeanour at once aggressively
supercilious and unceremonious. Far be it from my inten-
tion to suggest that this sort of conduct applies with equal


relevancy to all British manufacturers. But Ido hold, and I
have authority for the statement, that some of their number
give themselves airs of this kind, much, sometimes, to their
own detriment in a business Avay. In a Avord, the English
manufacturer is very often not only too conservative ; he is
too independent in his dealings Avith Colonial buyers,
and affects far too lofty and unconciliatory a mien Avhen
approached by them on business.
A New Zealand gentleman, on a visit to this country
in the declining part of 1889, Avas, while travelling from
Euston to Cottonopolis, thrown into the company of a
Manchester manufacturer who happened to be in the same
compartment. The conversation, quite naturally, turned on
the Colonies. British trade Avith Australasia Avas discussed
in all its bearings, as was also the improvement in the com-
mercial and industrial outlook in Maoriland. The manufac-
turer contended that, as the population of this Colony was no
larger than that of Liverpool, its trade Avas not Avorth the
having, when circumstances of freight, duties, and distance
Avere taken into consideration. “The place is too far aAvay,
sir,” he argued ; “and the orders, Avhen they come, are too
small. Why, one of my Continental customers will buy more
pieces of stuff in an hour than half-a-dozen of your Noav
Zealand houses would take in a year. No, sir; I don’t intend
to spend any money in pushing trade in Maoriland, as you
are pleased to name it. We are Avell enough knoAvn. We’ve
been established since 1830, and if Messrs. BroAvn, Jones
and Robinson, of Noav Zealand, Avant our goods, they’ll very
soon write to us and order. But Ave are not going to incur
the expense of sending out any representatiA'e or of adver-
tising our goods there. We never advertise; it’s infra dig.
We’ve enough to do nearer home, without bothering
our heads about the Colonies.” This is, in substance, what
Avas said ; and, perhaps, this kind of argument expresses
pretty clearly and adequately the opinion of many other
manufacturers.
No wonder, then, Australian and New Zealand buyers
prefer to do business with the foreigner. The foreigner is
polite, and his urbanity is sufficiently irresistible to secure
him orders that might have gone to an English firm, had it
manifested a similar desire to obtain them, and displayed
in the effort a like measure of courtesy. He knoA\ r s his
business, and brings art and ingenuity to bear in the making
of the bargain, though these attributes may have been
lacking in the making of the Avares that he is trying to sell.
It is the art, perhaps, of the patent medicine vendor or of
the “cheap Jack” ; but it is effective, it is resultful, and that
constitutes the aim and object of every business man, that


is tlie experimentum crucis of his suasive ability. I main-
tain that it is his irresistible suavity and dogged persistency,
his modest assurance and his insinuating modus operandi ,
that make the foreigner so popular amongst buyers in the
Colonies. But he is active, too ; he does not allow the grass
to grow under his feet. The foreign manufacturer takes a
trip to the Colonies ostensibly for pleasure or health, but
virtually to see what sort of a field there is for the disposal
of his own particular wares. He keeps his weather-eye open,
and his ears likewise. If he goes out to dine, he is ever on
the qui vive; or for a drive to see the country, he looks at
the scenery through mercantile spectacles. As a rule, he
spends several months in the Colonies travelling through
them, inquiring, observing, and taking copious mental notes.
He keeps a watchful eye on trade prospects ; studies the
requirements of the people, their tastes and preferences. He
introduces himself to merchants and storekeepers, invites
them to dinner or to the theatre, finds out their little weak-
nesses and idiosyncrasies, and then pampers them ; admires
their pictures or their horses, bestows praise on the tasteful
arrangement of their furniture, eulogises his host’s cigars
(though the last one was so rank that he had to throw it
behind him in the garden while his host’s attention was
diverted), takes up the latest infantile addition to the house-
hold and implants a kiss upon its innocent brow, slips a
shilling into its dumpy hand and declares that it is “se
budeefullest schild I have ever put ice on”; and, altogether,
ingeniously affects to be of them and like them. In this
way he establishes sympathy and confidence with his hosts.
Then, having thus ingratiated himself and left behind him
everywhere a good impression of himself and the com-
modities he makes, he returns to his native country, after
having appointed an efficient Colonial representative, and
prepares a set of samples designed to suit Australasian tastes.
Note. —l may here take occasion to mention, parenthetically, that
Messrs. S. & P. Erard, the well-known high-class pianoforte manufac-
turers, have resolved, at my suggestion, to adopt a system of direct trade
with Australasia. They will shortly indicate their decision in their
Colonial advertisements. The enterprising manager of this firm, Mr.
Wallace, formerly musical critic of the Pall Mall Gazette , while discus-
sing the matter with me the other day, was good enough to express his
unqualified concurrence with my views anent this subject. If, therefore,
a firm like this, which assuredly stands facile princeps amongst musical
instrument makers, condescends to supply a single piano to buyers in
Australasia, surely those manufacturers, who now refuse or hesitate to
execute small orders from the Colonies, might profit by following, tenta-
tively at least, this laudable example.


CHAPTER Y.
DIRECT TRADE WITH AUSTRALASIA.
(PART THIRD.)
English Manufacturer on the “ War Path.”—Goes
after Kangaroos instead op after Orders.—
Raw Representatives from England.—Commer-
cial Travellers, whom to Appoint.—Centrali-
zation op Trade.—On Working all the Colonies
prom One Centre.—New Zealand not in touch
with Australia.
Does the English manufacturer, his son, or his accredited
representative make such good use of his time ? I think
not. When the first-named sets out on a pilgrimage of this
sort, he not unfrequently subordinates business to pleasure.
He soon forgets the primary object of his mission, amid the
alluring distractions of scenery and altered environment.
He changes with the changed surroundings. Intellectual
energy gives place to intellectual ease, commercial activity
to commercial sluggishness, thoughts of business to thoughts
of pleasure. The sudden transformation has been too much
for nerves strained by business cares ; it overpowers him,
and he forthwith yields passively to the new influences that
dominate his mind, and to the sense of buoyancy that
gradually steals over him.
When he lands, his loose knickerbocker suit of plaid, his
sunburnt face, and his airy manner give him rather the
appearance of the English tourist than of the English manu-
facturer. In the eyes of the Australians the former is what
he appears to be. The other hotel guests refer to him as “the
wealthy English tourist,” and he likes it: it flatters his vanity.
He would not for the world that they should be undeceived
after this—that they should ever learn that he is simply a
blacking manufacturer or a match maker on the commercial
“ war path.” Therefore, he forthwith resolves to confine
himself to pleasure, to play the role of tourist instead of
commercial traveller ; and he seeks the companionship of
other tourists. Parties are formed, and fishing, shooting,
driving, boating, and kangaroo hunting occupy his mind
and time, to the exclusion of trade matters. Business and


the extension of Ms trade connection he leaves for his son,
whom he determines to send out on his return to England.
Of course, I am referring specially to the type of a certain
class. The son follows very much in the father’s footsteps.
The newer, freer life, the exhilarating effects of the stimu-
lating Australian air, the countless outdoor amusements and
attractions, and the temptation of a full purse to enjoy
them—all these things conspire to please and dazzle him,
and to divert his thoughts from the serious and prosaic
occupation of business ; and one cannot marvel at it either,
when a previous artificial life amid the smoke and fogs of an
English city is taken into account. lam referring, of course,
to manufacturers’ sons who make only a few months’
sojourn in the Colonies. If they stop out there for a year or
two, their appetite for pleasure has by that time become
cloyed, the allurements to which I have referred cease to tempt
them, and they settle down to business in real earnest. They
get on intimate terms with buyers and country storekeepers,
grow familiar with the tastes and requirements of the people,
get to know who is and who is not solvent, learn just what
kinds of goods to keep always at hand, and altogether make
excellent headway in their new sphere of operations. But
all this takes time—a year or two at least. Colonial experience
is not to be picked up in a month or two, any more than are
Oreek or Arabic,
Then there is the young man who quits the home of his
parents and gives up two or three pounds a week, more or
less, to try his fortune in the Colonies. In an advertisement
in the Times , the Daily Telegraph, or the Manchester Guar-
dian, he states that he is going to sail for Australia on such
and such a date, and will be glad to undertake two or three
agencies. As he has had five or six years’ experience in a
shipping house, is well connected, and has the reputation of
being an energetic and smart young business man, he
succeeds, perhaps, by these qualifications alone, in obtaining
the representation of several firms, who consider him to be
just the sort of young man to push their trade in the
Antipodes. The results of the appointment, however, do not
always justify these favourable anticipations. It is one
thing to go out to Sydney or Melbourne and take an office ;
it is quite another to sell English goods on commission. He
finds that simply putting his name and those of the firms he
represents on the office door does not help him much. It is
not unnatural, too, that he should feel a little homesick.
In these circumstances, it is scarcely to be wondered at
that these appointments should not always turn out satisfac-
torily. There are, however, other obstacles to the success of
these young men. A young Englishman finds himself at


first quite “at sea ” in his new sphere. He may under-
stand office and warehouse work in England, and be able, by
reason of his technical training, to tell to a fraction the value
of an article put in his hands; but, until he is better known,
throws off some of his English reserve and hauteur , studies
his manner and bearing more than his dress, performs the role
he has chosen less timorously and with greater resoluteness,
and establishes something like an intimate personal sympathy
with those whose orders he seeks, his efforts will be un-
attended with the success he desires. He must adapt him-
self to the circumstances and to the people. No doubt he
will experience many difficulties at first, and get into
innumerable metaphorical fogs ; but by dint of indomitable
perseverance and pluck, these will in time disappear, as dn
atmospheric fogs before the kinetic energies of King JEolus.
But he should not remain in the towns. Let him venture
into the country ; it is there that he will swell his order
book and become possessed of real Colonial experience. He
will find it rough enough, no doubt ; but he had better
stop in England if he feels unequal to spending a night
“in the open,” living a week or two on mutton and
“ damper ” and doubtful water, or sweltering for two or
three days at a stretch on the top of a buggy or a primi-
tive coach in the height of the Australian summer. He
must put up with all this if he would succeed “on the
road ” in Australia. Many young fellows who go out
there never attempt these trips but once. They remain
in the cities, and that is why, perhaps, they don’t succeed.
They have been so accustomed from their cradle to the
refinements of a comfortable English home, that the hard-
ships of commercial travelling in the Bush of Australia,
though sometimes attended with danger and romance, have
no charm for them when once experienced. The expense,
too, often deters these young men from making these trips.
It is the old Colonial C. T. who can make these trips into
the interior pay. He knows every inch of the ground and
every trait of the people, can endure privation and fatigue
as easily as he can smoke dubious tobacco or imbibe animated
water, and can rely always with tolerable certitude on doing
a payable modicum of business with up-country customers.
I cannot impress too strongly upon manufacturers the
advisability of their arranging with men in the Colonies, who
know the country and the people, who have an extensive
connection of their own, and who by many years’ experience
on the road have become familiar with the requirements
and the tastes of buyers in communities far or near. Such
men cannot be found in England. They must be sought in
the Colonies. And it will be found necessary to appoint


travellers for each Colony. A traveller’s connection never,
as a rule, extends beyond the borders of the Colony in
which his home and headquarters are located. Moreover,
each Colony differs from its sisters in the circumstances and
conditions of its trade and in the tastes of its inhabitants.
For example, South Australian farmers and bushmen wear
a different kind of felt hat from that for which the same
classes in Victoria evince a strong preference ; and the New
South Wales bushman prefers a hat distinct from either, —he
likes the Californian breadth of brim and high crown.
And, since it can be truly said of the bushman that when
his hat is on his house is thatched, one cannot wonder that
he should be a little particular about the appearance of the
straw or felt of which his roof is to be made. New Zealanders
are no less singular in their preferences. And as with hats,
so with other kinds of wearing apparel. The argument holds
good, indeed, in respect of many other classes of goods ; and
it applies with equal relevancy to all the Colonies.
Some English firms, presumably in order, as it is thought,
to save expense, are essaying to work the whole group of
Colonies from one centre. The impracticability of this
system has long been apparent to me, as indeed it must
become, sooner or later, to firms who have been foolish enough
to adopt it. It may be to the interests of Melbourne or
Sydney agents to stipulate with English firms at the outset
for their sole representation throughout Australasia, but I am
doubtful if it is always to the interests of the latter ; indeed,
lam quite convinced of the contrary. No wonder that some
British manufacturers are for ever complaining of the un-
even distribution of their goods over the Australian con-
tinent, and of the centralization of their trade in one Colony.
How can it be otherwise, if their sole representation is placed
in the hands of a local agent or firm ? For the proverbial
hundred and one reasons, it is utterly impossible for any
local firm properly to work the neighbouring Colonies from
its own head centre: the attempt will prove abortive.
The traveller of a Melbourne firm is received by buyers
in another Colony with frigid formality and undisguised
ill-grace. He is regarded as an interloper, and his zealous
solicitations of business meet with but a poor return. Unless
the intruder can offer an article at a price below that charged
for it by any of the band of local travellers who regularly
ply the same rounds, he is not at all likely, in face of inter-
colonial jealousy, to make much commercial headway in
neighbouring Colonies. I agree with Henry George’s dictum
that “ in the Australasian Colonies there are many little in-
dications of that spirit which, if suffered to grow and intensify,
may give justification to the adage that peoples separated by


creeks may more bitterly hate each other than those separated
by oceans.”
If it is impossible to work one continental Colony from
another, it is even more difficult still to work New Zealand
from an Australian centre. Attempts have been made to do
this, but such efforts have invariably ended in failure.
Apart from distance, there are other obstacles to the success
of this system. For one thing, the cost of travelling between
Maoriland and Melbourne or Sydney is an expensive item.
There is also the expense of getting over the Colony by rail,,
steamer and coach, and of hotel accommodation. Then, again*
as the orders of New Zealander buyers are small by com-
parison with those obtained in Australia, there is the
additional expense of transhipment in Sydney or Melbourne
to be taken into account; for it is, I believe, the rule with
these representatives, in the case of small consignments, to
have them sent direct to the Australian headquarters, where
the packages are re-directed and re-shipped to their respective
destinations in the island Colony. Motives of economy, it
may be presumed, constitute the raison d'etre of this circuitous
mode of distribution. It is probably less expensive to send
out large quantities of goods at the same time and to the
same port of arrival, than to ship small orders direct to New
Zealand from London. However this may be, I have good
authority for the statement that this roundabout course is in
vogue.
To return, however, to the main point. Other unpropitious
circumstances might be mentioned as having a tendency to
militate against the success of operations of the kind referred
to. The New Zealand people are not in touch with Aus-
tralia. The inhabitants of the island Colony are as far
removed from their continental neighbours in thoughts and
feelings, in fashions and fancies, in preferences and predi-
lections, mentally, physically, morally and spiritually, as the
Maoris are -from the Blacks. New Zealanders carry their
insularity into everything. They are a quiet, easy-going,
unobtrusive sort of people, and live—or, rather, dream away
—a happy-go-lucky, come-day-go-day-God-send-Sunday kind
of existence. But they are independent withal. They are,
and consider themselves, isolated from the rest of the world,
and inwardly feel themselves capable of managing their
own affairs, of fighting their own battles in life, and of
supplying their own requirements. New Zealanders are
more loyal to the Throne and to the Empire than Australians;
and they are loyal to each other, if not to their continental
neighbours. They resent Australian interference openly,
and regard as impertinent the suggestions and advice periodi-
cally offered by Melbourne or Sydney newspaper writers and


politicians as to the administration of their public affairs.
New Zealand has Parliamentary statutes and law codes
entirely different from the political and legal precedents in
the other Colonies. The fact that her continental neigh-
bours have decided on making any legislative change or
innovation is not accounted a sufficient reason for herself
making any sudden departure from established custom
in relation to her Parliamentary enactments or her civil
and criminal judicature. Neither is she influenced or
guided in the re-framing of her fiscal policy by any recent
change that may have been effected in that of New South
Wales, Victoria, or any other Colony. When any change in
the Customs’ duties is felt to be needed, it will be made of
the Colony’s own accord, by influence brought to bear on
the authorities by Protectionists (otherwise the local manu-
facturers), or by Free Traders (otherwise the merchants
and importers). New Zealand plays a “lone hand” in every-
thing. The native barrister who leaves Maoriland to improve
his circumstances in Melbourne has to pass certain examina-
tions in Victorian law ere he can take a brief in the last-
named Colony. He may be a lawyer in New Zealand, but
he is only a layman in Melbourne till he shall have been
enrolled in the Victorian law list as a full-fledged attorney.
There are in Maoriland other manifest indications of this
spirit of separateness, of these insularities, idiosyncrasies,
and intercolonial prejudices, a relation of which, though it
might perhaps interest students of ethnology or of ethology,
would be conspicuously out of place in a book on trade topics.
Note. —Messrs. Richard Kell & Co., of Newcastle, the great grindstone
people, who have been established since 1784, and who do a large business
with Australia and New Zealand, write me to say that they have for some
years past been suffering from the competition of Yorkshire grindstones.
“ These,” they write, “ are being shipped (very dishonestly, we think, if it
be so) as ‘ Yorkshire Newcastle Grindstones,’ which is as accurate a de-
scription as to call Scotch coal ‘Scotch Newcastle Coal.’” lam very
pleased to have this opportunity of drawing the attention of Colonial
buyers to the circumstance. iThere can be no doubt that Newcastle
grindstones are, and always have been, superior to any made in any other
part of England ; and if there be any foundation in fact for the fears of
this firm, that “ the inferior Yorkshire stones arriving in the Colonies as
‘Yorkshire Newcastle Grindstones, ’ soon drop the adjunct of Yorkshire,
and pass as genuine Newcastle stones, much to the discredit of the latter,”
then I am at one with Messrs. Richard Kell & Co., and contend that the
deception should be exposed at once. In another letter they say, “ The
false colours under which ‘ Yorkshire Newcastle’ stones are shipped is not
the act of the Yorkshire quarry owners, as far as we know. It is done by
shippers in London, who buy the Yorkshire stones, which are cheaper,
although of very inferior quality, and ship them under this misleading
description.” Newcastle grindstones, as everybody in the United Kingdom
knows, enjoy the reputation of being the best. And, as my correspondent
says truly, “A Scot, a rat, and a Newcastle grindstone are proverbially
understood to be found in any part of the world.”

The remarks which follow may carry more weight if I pre-
mise that my experience has not been confined to the cities and
towns of Australia and New Zealand. I have, as the repre-
sentative of leading newspapers, been privileged to travel
incessantly in the country, the interior, the “Bush.” It
was during these internal journeyings that I learned the
requirements of communities scattered over distant areas of
wild, pastoral, agricultural and “Bush” territories. And,
after all, it is not the trade of the cities, but of the country,
that is the more important to British manufacturers. It is
up-country requirements rather than the requirements of
cities on which some enlightenment is needed. English
exporters know something about the tastes of Melbourne, of
Sydney, and of Dunedin people, but they are unacquainted
with the wants of ruralists of the interior. This ignorance,
indeed, as regards the country, is very often shared by the
heads of Australian city importing firms, who, except through
their travellers, know little more about the prevailing re-
quirements and tastes of their “ country cousins ” than do
manufacturers in England. Two-thirds of the urban inha-
bitants of Australasian capitals never, I venture to say, go
inland a hundred miles beyond the city boundaries. Many
residents live and die amid the comforts and conveniences
of modern city life, never visiting the interior in their lives.
I have known people in Melbourne and Sydney who never
saw a kangaroo or a wallaby, and who had never set eyes on


a black fellow until curiosity took them to a show in town
at which there were performing natives. Verily, one may
live in Melbourne or Sydney, and except, perhaps, for the
heat and the brilliant sky, easily imagine oneself to be a
resident of some English provincial town, so modernised are
the surroundings and life. Curiosity is not a sufficient in-
ducement to city folk to undergo the discomforts of a trip
into the Far North or the Far West. Unless the necessities
of business render it absolutely imperative, very few towns-
peojfie venture on these excursions.
It was during my peregrinations through little fre-
quented parts that I became aware not only of the need for
direct trade with Great Britain, but of the universal desire
for it among country storekeepers. There are two kinds of
storekeepers in the Colonies, the tied and untied : those
under the thumb of city merchants and importers, and those
untrammelled, who in many cases are not only independent
in action but in means. Many country storekeepers are
wealthy men. Not only do they own a well-stocked store,
and the ground on which it stands, but, in many instances,
the lion’s share of the neighbouring land and property. In
fact, in some cases, they often occupy themselves with farming
and squatting pursuits as well. I know men in these Colonies
who combine rustic occupation and sheep-breeding with
general storekeeping and hotel-proprietorship. As a rule,
they were pioneer settlers in the district in which they reside ;
their names are often associated with the founding and colo-
nisation of the township in which they are domiciled. In some
cases, the place, or, at any rate, a street in it, has been called
after them. Nor is their reputation always purely local. Their
names sometimes are familiar enough two or three hundred
miles away. So much for the independent or “ untied ” store-
keeper. Now for his counterpart. This is a man who, as a rule,
wears a troubled air, if one may judge from the gloom that
steals over his countenance as you question him about busi-
ness. He, too, has land and houses, but all mortgaged. He lives
in constant dread of the uncertain morrow. He has been in
the district all his life, but latterly the dark shadows of bank-
ruptcy proceedings have incessantly haunted him. Unlike
his business competitor just described, who basks in the sun-
shine of prosperity, his lines have not been cast in pleasant
places. Providence has not permitted him to delve in
Pactolian sands ; rather, indeed, has she bequeathed to him
the luckless shirt of Nessus. The reason is not far to seek.
He is bound, financially, hand and foot to one or two
city firms, and dare not deal elsewhere, lest they should
foreclose.
Storekeepers in this unenviable position are generally


easy-going, good-natured sort of men, who are too often
tempted to buy goods unsuitable for their customers by the
bland ‘ importunity of commercial travellers, the chief in-
ducement being long credit. Quite unconsciously do many
of these storekeepers become the dupes of unscrupulous
travellers, whose employers not unfrequently abet their sharp
practices, even if they do not exclusively measure the quali-
fications of their representative by his ability to ensnare
unwary country buyers. When a line of goods turns out a
failure in the cities, it is either sold by auction or handed
over to one of these enterprising representatives, who con-
trives to foist it on some credulous up-country storekeeper.
I have been told by men who have been victimised in this
way, that sometimes, quite unsuspectingly, they get “ let in ”
to the extent of five or six hundred pounds. And where a
traveller succeeds in “ placing ” a large order of unsaleable
goods, the chances are that, so far from losing his customer,
he may ultimately secure him permanently. The storekeeper,
finding himself crippled by the transaction, is obliged to ask
the merchants for longer credit, and, in order to procure it,
yields up his independence, gets inextricably in the clutches
of his creditors, and thus, by degrees, sinks deeper and
deeper in debt.
It need hardly be said that merchants who once succeed in
getting rural traders into their power offer them but little
scope in the selection of goods, carrying into practice, in-
deed, the principle that beggars cannot and must not be
choosers. The result is that all the unsaleable shoddy that
won’t “go off” in town is thrust upon these vassals, who dare
not complain. The duration of their serfdom depends very
much upon circumstances. Sometimes they are at the mercy
of their creditors all their lives. At all events, when once
they are caught in the toils thus set for them, their chance of
escape is as remote as was that of sixteenth-century State
prisoners when once inside the portals of Traitors’ Gate.
I may here take occasion to advert, parenthetically, to an
intermediary between the debt-bound up-country storekeeper
and the British manufacturer, as being, indirectly, in some
degree the cause of the long-suffering storekeeper’s troubles.
I refer to the London buyer. This gentleman usually gauges
the tastes of the Australians by his own notions, and supplies
their wants according to his own standards of what is becom-
ing in design. It is to him that Antipodean communities
look for light and leading in regard to fashion. He leads
and stimulates, though he does not mould their tastes. In
the matter of dress, he is expected to select from London and
Continental current fashions such designs as, after allowing
for peculiarities of people and difference of climate, will be


likely to suit the somewhat volatile tastes of Australasians,
who, let me not omit to add en passant , with all the deference
they pay to English and Parisian canons of fashion, yet have
distinctively Antipodean notions of their own as regards the
fitness or unbecomingness of this or that imported article of
personal attire. They import, perhaps, something of national
bias into their choice of design. The London buyer for the
Colonies of ladies’ mantles and dresses generally performs
his duties satisfactorily enough up to a point. He manages
to hit on a design that is not likely to miss the mark, not-
withstanding that he may have lived only in the Imperial
metropolis for the last twenty years. But it may be doubted
whether his success in this direction is due to himself or to
salutary influences and changes originating and occurring in
the Colonies. It may be that with the introduction into its
midst of skilled London and Paris dressmakers, the Austra-
lasian feminine wox-ld has become more Europeanised of late
in its ideas, and is, therefore, more plastic than it was a
quarter of a century ago, when the gentleman just referred
to personally knew it. Certainly English and Continental
dressmakers command almost princely salaries in Melbourne
and Sydney, and are in great request.
If the leaders of fashion in Melbourne and Sydney are
becoming less un-English, and are conforming more to
Western canons of taste and design in ladies’ dress mate-
rial, the circumstance is doubtless due, in no small measure,
to the influence and teachings of the ladies just referred
to. Possibly the London buyer, too, may have contributed
his quota to this comparatively recent evolution in Aus-
tralasian tastes in relation to women’s attire.
But it must not be supposed, from what I have said, that
Australian ladies are guided entirely by London buyers and
imported dressmakers in their choice of material. This is
contrary to fact. A buyer may send out a “ line ” that will
turn out a complete failure in the Colonies, although the
material may have been greatly in vogue in England and
on the Continent. London and Paris fashions are undoubt-
edly copied to some extent; but certain laws govern this
spirit of imitation. For instance, the Melbourne lady may
like her “ Cup dress ” * made up after the latest London or
Paris fashion ; but in the selection of the material of which
it is to be composed, she is guided, to a large extent, by her
own instincts, and by the peculiarities of the Victorian
climate.
From what I have said, it will be seen that a London
buyer, even of ladies’ dress materials, must know something
* Dress worn at the great Annual Cap Race, run at Flemington in
November each year.


of the country, and of the people for whose tastes he is
catering. It is not enough for him to have been born in
the Colonies, and to have spent the first half of his life
there and the latter half in London. To be familiar with the
present requirements and tastes of Colonial communities,
a buyer’s experience must be fresh, and his knowledge up-
to-date.
Australians like what is novel. Recent inventions are
very often in vogue there long before they become popular
in conservative England. Nearly every hotel in Melbourne
and Sydney adopted the “ cash register ” in less than three
months after its introduction into the country, notwithstand-
ing the heavy price. It was the same with type-writing
machines. It is, in fact, the same with everything. You
can read a newspaper with comparative ease in most of the
railway carriages in Victoria. That is more than one can
do always in England. Then, again, sumptuously furnished
elevators are common in the hotels and large business
erections of “ Marvellous Melbourne.” Electric lighting is.
no new method of illumination to Australians. The streets
are ablaze with electricity, and the entrances and interiors
of theatres and other places of amusement are quite as
brilliantly lighted as in London. The Princess Theatre, in
Melbourne, will compare favourably with any in England,
in point of elegance and luxury.
As regards railway appliances, these embrace the very
latest improvements. The American saloon carriages obtain
both in Australia and New Zealand. You can, while re-
clining in the comfortable armchair seats and speeding
away at the rate of forty miles an hour from Melbourne
and civilisation, buy the latest novel, or the daily papers,
from the newsvendor who passes through the train from
end to end throughout the journey ; and if you want to
refresh the outer man with a “ wash,” and the inner with a
“ snack,” .en route , this you can do likewise. Though the
railway train should land you at a “ God-forsaken” look-
ing station in the heart of some desolate “ Bush ” region,
you will find a substantial hot meal awaiting you, whatever
may be the time of day or night ; and it will cost you only
eighteenpence. Nor will there be any necessity for you to
bolt your food, and thereby suffer the hypochondriacal and
excruciating tortures of dyspepsia in order to catch your
train. You are timed to stop twenty minutes, and a bell
will ring five minutes before the expiration of the allotted
stoppage. Nor is travelling by intercolonial steamers less
comfortable. The vessels of the Union Steamship Co., of
New Zealand, are models of comfort. They are as fast as
the best Atlantic liners, and hardly less luxurious ; and the


fare they provide is a good deal better than is obtainable at
many an English provincial hotel. They are admirably
fitted out with the electric light, and the saloons, state rooms,
music rooms, libraries, ladies’ boudoirs, and fumoirs are
perfect in their way.
To return for a moment, however, to the London buyer.
I said, some pages back, that this gentleman may indirectly
have something to do with the bringing about of the troubles
of the class of storekeeper to whom I last referred. He very
often buys, as I have said, “ lines ” that turn out a failure in
Melbourne and Sydney, and, as these goods have to be dis-
posed of somehow and somewhere, they are subsequently
thrust upon such up-country storekeepers as are simple-
minded enough to be cajoled into “grabbing ” them, at on©
of those philanthropic reductions in price that the generous,
give-away-an-ornament-with-a-pound-of-tea grocer, who sells
a pound of eighteenpenny tea and a farthing glass vase for
half-a-crown, would call startling or ruinous prices. In
this way, then, is the London buyer responsible.
Inefficient or ignorant London buyers and agents used, a
few years ago, to suppose that anything would sell in the
Colonies, however rubbishy. If it was found impossible to
“ get off ” in the United Kingdom some line that had been
damaged or spoiled in the process of manufacture, it used to be
shipped off to Australia, with the remark, “ It will go off all
right out there; Colonials Avon’tknow the difference,” “ Ship
it off to the Colonies ” was a remark that, not many years
ago, used to be applied to a line that had turned out a failure
in this country. The supposition was that any defect in
manufacture or error of taste in design would not be noticed
by ignorant Antipodeans. But that is all changed now.
Shippers have grown wiser in their generation, and have
lived to discover the indubitable fact that, although Australians
will not pay for the first quality in regard to most goods, or
buy things at “fancy prices,” yet they will not, if they
know it, have rubbish thrust on to them at any price. Cer-
tainly many Colonial drapers, and storekeepers generally, did
not know much about goods, technically, twenty or thirty
years ago. They had undergone no technical training, such
as drapers and drapers’ salesmen have to pass through in
England before they are considered efficient. Many of them
had started as gold-diggers, or well-sinkers, or road-makers,
or bullock-drivers, and having saved up enough money to
buy a shop or a store, found the occupation of measuring
calico or weighing tea or sugar more congenial (and in some
cases more profitable) than burrowing the earth, cracking the
whip, or wielding the pick and shovel. I question very much
indeed, whether, even to-day, 20 per cent, of the gentlemen


who own drapery establishments in Australia and New Zea-
land ever served an apprenticeship. The majority of them
have picked up only a superficial knowledge of their trade by
observant attention and unflagging industry. Nor, at the time
to which I refer, did many salesmen behind the counter
possess a more technical acquaintance with the business
than many of their employers. If a salesman for, say, the
Manchester department were advertised for, drapers and
drapers’ assistants were so scarce in those days, that an utterly
unpractised hand might be taken on to fill the vacancy. A
young man might apply who had last been post-cutting or
boundary-riding in the Bush, and, if of respectable appear-
ance and fair address, would stand a good chance of obtain-
ing the appointment. Yet his only knowledge of calico
might perhaps be mainly derived from the white shirt or
handkerchief he wore. Now it is different. With the
development of steamship communication with the Old
World, facilities have since been offered to young men who,
having served their apprenticeship in England, seek under
the sunny skies of the “Land of the Golden Fleece” better
wages and healthier surroundings than are offered in the
United Kingdom.
Let me revert once more to the influential storekeeper.
The necessity for direct trade was first brought to my notice
by the observations of these gentlemen, with whom, during
my insular peregrinations in Australia and New Zealand, I
got on terms of intimacy and, in some cases, friendship. It
was invariably over a cup of tea or a pipe and a glass in the
evening under the verandah that they used to tell me their
tales of woe. The conversation was generally ushered in
with a despairing sigh and a lugubrious “ Ah, me ! ” “If
things were only different —if we only had Direct Trade ! ”
As this seemed to be the zenith and apogee of my host’s
ambition, I naturally, the first time I heard the exclamation,
felt curious to know the why and the wherefore. “Why,
what then ? ” I asked. This was the answer : “ What then,
sir ? Well, with Direct Trade, I should personally be far
better off, and should be less subjected to accusations of
wilfully overcharging my customers, who are repeatedly
taunting me with the statement that, as there is no other
opposition but ’s, I therefore charge just what I like
for everything. Nothing of the sort, sir, I assure you. They
don’t know how I am hampered, and it would be quite use-
less to explain the real circumstances to them.”
“ What are the real circumstances, then, may I ask ? ”
“ Simply this, sir,” would be the reply. “ Though I pay
my way—pay cash, in fact, for most of my goods—l am as
much at the mercy of the large Melbourne or Sydney im-


porters as is poor old , over yonder. [The allusion was
to another storekeeper on the other side of the road a little
lower down, who was in the hands of a large city company,
and mortgaged up to the hilt.] He is merely a tool in their
hands ; and, in a sense, so am I. For there is no escape
from their thraldom, I have to pay through the nose for
my goods just as much as he, and it is practically because
of his dependence that lam not independent of them. Why
don’t I deal elsewhere ? Pooh ! they are all alike ; they all
work hand in hand—merchants, banks, loan companies, and
all. The whole system, sir, is rotten from beginning to end.
And it will never be any better till we can get our goods
direct from home.”
“ Then why don’t you do so ? ” I said.
“ Can’t. British manufacturers won’t deal with us. They
are afraid of losing the custom of the big importers. That’s
one reason. But they decline on other grounds. For in-
stance •”
“ Have you tried, then, to establish business relations of
this kind ?” I asked, interrupting him.
“ Several times. But excuse me a moment,” with which
remark my host repaired to an adjoining room, from which
he emerged a moment after, with a letter, which he read
aloud. It was from a large Birmingham firm, and ran some-
what as follows :
Dear Sir,
We are in receipt of your favour of , for which we are obliged.
We regret, however, that we are unable, from a variety of circumstances,
to comply with your request that we should open an account with you in
our books on the lines you suggest.
Apart from our disinclination to open up accounts with small Colonial
storekeepers with whom we have had no previous dealings, and of whose
ionafides we have at this distance no means of judging (for, as no doubt
you are aware, we have no branch office in Australasia, and therefore no
channels are available to ns through which information might be obtained
respecting the integrity and stability of country storekeepers desiring to
do a credit business with us direct), there are other circumstances that
render the adoption of the system you suggest impracticable and, so far
as we are concerned, undesirable.
We consider that, in view of our present arrangements with wholesale
importers in the large Australian and New Zealand centres, we are in
honour bound to coniine our business relations with these firms. More-
over, irrespective altogether of feelings of sentiment, any departure on
our part in the direction you have indicated, might lead to an estrange-
ment with our present customers which we can ill-aiford to encounter.
We are loth to encourage possible ostracism of this sort by any act of
ours which could be construed, by the firms with whom we at present do
business, into either an attitude of defiance or a disposition to transgress
the laws of etiquette subsisting between us. Besides, we must openly
confess to being far from convinced that Direct Trade relations with
small up-country storekeepers would very materially advance our interests
in the Colonies, unless such a trade were conducted on cash principles ;
even on this basis we should not be very sanguine about results, in view
of the existence of other opposing influences to which we have referred.


We are of opinion, indeed, that we might lose a great deal more than we
should gain by, at any rate, the exclusive adoption of such a system. We
should be very glad to deal direct with you, or, in fact, with any other
respectable storekeeper out yonder, should the system come into general
use, and should other English houses adopt the same methods. But we
do not feel disposed, for the several reasons we have stated, singly to
launch out boldly in a direction diametrically opposed to the interests of
those firms on whom we are at present dependent for our Australasian
turnover, and whose custom we cannot afford to forfeit. There is one
other point we had almost omitted to mention. We should not, under
any circumstances, care to undertake any orders of less value than £SO.
We trust that you will accept our remarks in the spirit in which they
have been written, and that you will not resent our candour in having
presented to you, in outspoken terms, our objections, not to the proposals
which you have made to us, but to the principles that would be involved
in carrying them into effect.
We remain, etc.,
“ There,” said mine host, flinging the letter on the table,
“there you have the whole position in the compass of a
nutshell. You see how we storekeepers are handicapped.
If I could deal direct, I could land many goods from England
25 and (in some cases) even 30 per cent, cheaper than they
now cost me. I should be able to supply my customers at a
figure more nearly approaching town prices. The demand
would be brisker and the returns quicker. The purchasing
abilities of my customers would be stimulated ; they would
spend more and buy oftener.
“As matters stand, the Melbourne, Sydney, or Dunedin
importer and the London middleman, between them, get
the cream of the profits, and we have to be content with the
scummy residuum. However, I may take a trip to the Old
Country in a bit, and then I shall see what I can do. I in-
tend, at all events, to come back with a few thousand pounds’
worth of stuff.”
The foregoing dialogue, together with the letter I have
quoted, will give a good idea at once of the need for direct
trade and of the absurd contentions of many British manu-
facturers in repudiating its claims. The letter is a typical
one. Of course, lam well aware that a few English manu-
facturers, more sensible than the rest, do deal direct as it is.
But they are few and far between. A little incident worth
recording occurred when I was staying at a well-known
hotel in a New Zealand provincial town. We were seated at
dinner, and the proprietor accidentally let a hot plate fall on
the floor. “ There goes another shilling, old man,” said one
of the diners, grinning all over his face. He was a clerk in a
local hardware importer’s. The landlord was a little nettled
at the remark, and he did not attempt to conceal his sense of
irritation. He retorted, “If I had bought it at your store,
certainly it would have cost me a shilling, or more, to replace


it. But I didn’t. I got it direct from the Old Country. I
get everything there now, in fact. That plate cost me just
twopence.”
Upon inquiring after dinner, the landlord told me that he
got everything from England. He took me into his store.
It was literally packed from floor to ceiling with goods of all
descriptions. He informed me that he had a five years’
stock in there. I asked him how he first thought of the idea
of getting his things direct. He replied that he saw an
advertisement in a Home paper, that some guest had left
behind him. It was a cutlery advertisement, and the prices
were given in full, “ I happened to know,” he said, “ that
the firm was ‘ all right,’ and so I sent along my order, and
the money with it, and got my goods in a little under four
months. Finding that I was saving so much by dealing
direct, I, in course of time, put myself in communication
with other well-known English firms. Some refused point
blank to supply me direct, and referred me to their Austra-
lian agents. Eventually, however, I dropped on such manu-
facturers as were not so particular.”
“By the way,” said I, “ this is a good cigar you have
given me. Did you import this yourself ?” “I did, I
bought 20,000 only the other day. The brand was recom-
mended to me by an English nobleman, who was staying
with me for some time, and who used to be always
complaining about those he got in the bar. He gave me the
address of the firm who have a monopoly of these cigars,
and said that the brand was smoked by the Prince of Wales
and the nobility, and was a cigar favoured at the West-end
Clubs in London. On his recommendation, I ordered 5,000,
and travellers liked them so well, that I sent for 20,000 more.
Fifteen thousand of these are pre-ordered already. What’s
the brand, do you say ? Dos Cabanas. The bands which
encircle them are all stamped with the Prince of Wales’s
feathers. If you buy them anywhere else in New Zealand
you will have to pay just threepence more per cigar than
I charge for them. Oh, yes; lam well satisfied with
Direct Trade, as you call it.”
I think I have said sufficient to convince the most
sceptical that there is a good deal more in Direct Trade than
meets the eye at first sight. The best course for British
manufacturers to adopt is to go straightway to Messrs. Thomas
Cook & Sons—they will get better terms and more information
here than anywhere else —and take a return ticket to the
Colonies, available for twelve months. Cook’s have branches
all over Australasia—in the remotest corners—and not only
can they give you the most reliable information as to how to
get to this or that place, but they are most obliging in


giving advice, even when their own interests are not con-
cerned. Their coupon system is very convenient too. But
manufacturers or their sons must not remain in the towns.
They must go into the agricultural, pastoral and mining
districts, and see and make arrangements with these store-
keepers themselves. A good deal of business will, prac-
tically, come to them unsought. Thus they will be able to
pick and choose their customers—find out good and bad
“ marks.” A reference to terms will be found in another
chapter. Such manufacturers as are unable to journey out
themselves I would advise to arrange either by letter or
through their advertisements to supply small buyers on the
cash principle. The method which seems to me the most
satisfactory is this : A storekeeper orders, say, fifty pounds*
worth of goods, from a printed and illustrated catalogue or
from sample, and he instructs one of the Australasian banks
to pay the manufacturer on presentation of invoice and
bill of lading.
It goes without saying, from what I have pointed out in
another chapter, that manufacturers will be constrained to do
a little advertising. If advertising is the soul of business in
this country, it is the backbone of success in the Colonies.
But they should be careful in whose hands they put this
responsible work. They may easily throw away hundreds
and even thousands of pounds by inefficient guidance. It is
not always advisable to advertise in the large city papers, and
no man who has not resided for many years in the country,
and been afforded opportunity for personal observation, can
possibly direct British manufacturers as to the best up-
country (or indeed any) mediums for their advertisements. It
is one thing to be in a position to say that such and such a
paper is the oldest and most influential, and the best adver-
tising medium in all Australasia. Most English manufac-
turers know this much themselves. But it is quite another
thing to be in a position accurately to state which mediums
will be best suited to bring a firm’s particular goods promi-
nently before the particular classes of people, scattered hither
and thither over continent and island, likely to be induced
to buy them. This is knowledge of a kind that cannot be
found or purchased in England.
I find that I have left myself too little space in which to
deal as exhaustively as I could have wished with the subject
of this chapter; There are other important points, having
collateral bearing on the theme, a discussion and examination
of which might well have been calculated to strengthen the
main arguments thereof. However, though the exigencies
of space prevent me from doing so now and here, I may,
perhaps, be afforded an opportunity, in a later edition, of


giving additional particulars, thereby enhancing the value of
the chapter, if not of the book, to the reader. Something
more, for instance, might have been said about the best
methods of advertising British manufacturers’ wares in the
Colonies. Then, again, those manufacturers who cannot
afford the time necessary to make a voyage out there would
doubtless be glad to know the names of such storekeepers
as would be likely to do business direct. I shall, therefore,
in the meanwhile, be pleased to furnish the heads of firms
with information of this description if they will be good
enough to put themselves in communication with me ; or I
should even be glad to see through their establishments
with a view to offering advice as to the articles, or samples
of them, best suited to the various and varying tastes of
different Colonies and districts. #
Before concluding, let me quote the words of Mr. John
Girdwood, who acted as Special Commissioner for Lancashire
at the late Melbourne International Exhibition. In a letter
to the newspapers on Direct Trade, he says, “. . . the Germans
having obtained such a hold upon these [Australasian] marr
kets as to render it almost an impossibility for British firms
to have their goods looked at by many of the buyers. Our
mode of doing business with Australasian houses is radically
wrong. It has fallen into the hands of London buyers, many
of whom have never been out of the United Kingdom. I
have always advocated the doing of business direct, and not
through agents, and this is the only way in which the British
manufacturer can regain his former position. He must go
direct to the consumer. The time is past when the margin
of profit allowed of three or four intermediaries making a
living out of an article sold to the consumer for, say, three-
pence or fourpence per yard. . . . The reason the German
manufacturers are always ready to adapt themselves to the
wants of a market is simply that, doing their business as I
have mentioned, they can spend, to their own advantage,,
money which, in the case of Home manufacturers, finds its
way, at present, into the pockets of agents and buyers.”

CHAPTER VII.
METHODS OF PUSHING THE SALE OF BRITISH
MANUFACTURES IN AUSTRALASIA.
Competition of England.—Three Ways op Pushing
English Goods.—Manufacturers’ League.
Different modes of introducing the saleable products of
the United Kingdom to Australasian markets must neces-
sarily be regulated by the status and means of the vending
firms. There • are makers whose brands in their own
particular lines are deemed indispensable throughout the
civilised world. To take a few instances at random, we
have great manufacturers of thread like Coats and Clark, of
Paisley, and Evans, of Derby ; calico printers like Lee, of
Manchester ; needle manufacturers like Millward, of Red-
ditch ; tinned and enamelled holloware manufacturers like
Kenrick & Sons, of West Bromwich ; makers of earthen-
ware like Hammersley, of Burslem ; cutlers like Rodgers,
of Sheffield ; electro-platers like Elkington & Mason, of
Birmingham; the Patent Nut and Bolt Company, of
Wednesbury ; saddlers and curriers like Middlemore, of
Birmingham ; makers of hooks and eyes like Newey
Bros., of Birmingham ; brass founders like Cartland &
Son, of Birmingham; edge tool makers like Edwards
& Son, of Wolverhampton ; manufacturers of india-rubber
goods like Macintosh & Co., of Manchester; paint and
varnish makers like Blundell, Spence & Co., of Hull, or
the Torbay Paint Company, London ; manufacturers of
wrought-iron nails like Cordes, of Newport (Mon.) ; manu-
facturers of cocoa like Fry, of Bristol; manufacturers of
elastic boot webs, linings, and laces like Faire, of Leicester;
manufacturers of grindstones like Richard Kell & Co., of
Newcastle; makers of belting like the Rossendale Belting
Company; alkali manufacturers like the United Alkali Com-
pany, Limited, of Liverpool; makers of lubricating oils like
A, B. Fleming & Co.; soap manufacturers like the “ Sunlight”
people; patent medicine manufacturers like Burroughs,
Wellcome & Co.; whisky distillers like John Robertson &
Son, of Dundee, or Dunville, of Belfast; velveteen manu-
facturers like Louis, of Manchester ; biscuit makers like
Huntley & Palmers ; seedsmen like Sutton & Sons ; candle
makers like Price’s (who deservedly have the lion’s share of


the Australasian trade); cycle manufacturers like Rudge, of
Coventry. Some of these would not unnaturally prefer to
have one or more agents exclusively devoted to their own in-
terests and supplied with stock as well as samples. In the case
of some makers of the same kind of article, it has happened that,
while they are unfettered competitors with each other in the
parent country, they unite in Australasia and agree to sell
similar qualities of articles at the same prices, and to employ
the same agent. There are others who decline to supply
goods direct at all, preferring to sell for foreign countries
and the Colonies through shippers in London and other
home centres. But not a few British manufacturers have
felt compelled to have their own agents abroad, either solely
occupied with their business, or engaged for them in
common with manufacturers in other branches of trade.
The reason is that shippers on this side, receiving indents
from Australasia, are found not to be in keen touch with
the markets for which they are commissioned to buy.
Travellers, representing Continental makers in the Colonies,
on the other hand, take pains to study the precise require-
ments of wholesale and retail purchasers with greater care.
Traders in Australasia send fewer and fewer orders for
particular wares to their English commission agents in
consequence of many of their wants being more suitably met
by Americans and Germans and makers of other nationali-
ties. The English maker feels his Colonial trade to be
dwindling without being able, at so great a distance from
the consumer, to detect exactly the cause. If the British
manufacturer thinks the Colonial trade under such circum-
stances worth cultivating, it is only a question of time
before he is unavoidably impelled to rely less on the
shipper and do business direct through agents acting
immediately for him on Colonial ground.
In another chapter allusion has been made to the rapid
strides made by the manufacturers of Germany in gradually
displacing many descriptions of British goods in the
Colonies. The same remark applies to articles introduced
and pushed from Belgium, France, Austria, and other
European countries, irrespective of the United States, the
greatest competitor of all. Makers in these foreign countries
spare neither trouble nor expense in finding out the wares
that are suitable for the markets of Australia, and I can
testify from extensive personal observation that they have
succeeded beyond their most sanguine anticipations. Con-
tinental representatives making it their business to learn
the sorts of goods best adapted to the markets, in passing
from warehouse to warehouse, from town to town, and from
Colony to Colony, must surely be in a vastly better position
85
Competition of England.


to judge of the ever-varying tastes of local merchants than
London commission merchants employed at present to buy
for Australian dealers. These commission merchants rarely,
if ever, visit, or, at least, make a prolonged stay, in the
Colonies. The old notion among middlemen and specu-
lative merchants living in England was that any rubbish
unsaleable in this country could be profitably got rid of in
Australasia. Hence the system of miscellaneous consign-
ments of job-lots bought cheaply at bankrupt sales or
elsewhere in England sent out to be sold by auction or
otherwise. As might be expected, when so little regard
is paid to the actual necessities of the Australasians, the
consignments are knocked down at a sacrifice, and a heavy
loss is incurred by consigners.
There are three ways in which British manufactures may
be efficiently submitted to the notice of Colonial purchasers
without the aid of middlemen, whether as shippers on com-
mission or Colonial merchants having branches in London.
One of these ways has been already mentioned. I refer to
the establishment of agencies in the leading capitals of
Australasia under the administration of an intelligent,
trustworthy, and energetic man practically acquainted with
the business of the British firm he represents, in direct
communication with that firm and ever on the watch to
suggest ideas for modifying the make of goods to suit more
nicely market wants. These, of course, are circumstances
under which the sales of a single firm would be large
enough to justify the cost of exclusive agencies. A second
way is already sometimes adopted by makers who accept
the services of a general commission agent, resident in the
Colonies, who undertakes agencies for as many British and
other manufacturers as he thinks he can do justice to. Such
an arrangement may occasionally work well, especially
if the agent is a man of tact, perseverance and character,
and holds no agency already which would clash with that
of the manufacturer who desires to appoint him as his
representative for the first time. But there is a third, and
perhaps a more excellent way still, that offers, as I think,
much larger advantages to manufacturers whose prospects
of business in the Colonies would not warrant them in
employing respectively agents whose attention is confined
solely to their individual businesses. The plan to be
stated combines a minimum of cost with a maximum of
business. Each manufacturer following it would have ground
for hope that his interests would be as carefully looked after
as if he employed a sole agent to attend to them, while he
would only be responsible for a fraction of the expense inevit-
able in conducting a sole agency. The scheme proposed
86

might be called the “ British Manufacturers’ Australasian
League.” It might easily be initiated by a committee of Eng-
lish manufacturers of different descriptions of goods not in
competition with each other. A given number up to, say,
thirty or forty, or more, might be admitted to membership,
always provided that their branches of trade could be consist-
ently grouped under one administration in the Colonies. It
would be quite sufficient, in the first instance, that a complete
set of samples should be prepared by each member of the league
and sent out, and that an agent should be appointed who
knows Australasia and its markets. A levy should be made
on the members of the league by its committee of so much a
head according to the extent and value of the business likely
to be done in the case of each manufacturer, to be contributed
for hiring and furnishing premises in which to exhibit
samples, advertising, and covering travelling expenses. The
amount thus collectively subscribed could be accounted for
by the agent, and he might also have advanced to him a
certain sum towards his support, to be superseded by
commissions when the trade was established and yielding
adequate returns to meet the agent’s requirements. When
business should be brought into full operation through the
taking of orders on sets of samples, it might be found
convenient for the agent of the league to move into premises
in which limited supplies of stock could be kept for the
convenience of regular customers. Having built up in this
way a flourishing trade in Melbourne, similar experiments
could be tentatively made in the other great Colonial centres,
especially Sydney, Auckland, Brisbane, and Adelaide.
Ultimately some of the larger interior cities might be
added. But as business confidence revives in Australasia, a
British Manufacturers’ League thoughtfully organised and
carried out on the lines now laid down could not fail to grow
and develop into one of the most important mercantile
enterprises in the Colonies. It may be further affirmed that
if steps be not taken to maintain the supremacy of British
manufactures in the manner indicated, demonstrating to
Australasian consumers that at least as much care is taken
by the United Kingdom to meet the commercial wants of
the Colonists as is taken by foreign competitors, British trade
must decrease, and trade with other countries increase.
It will afford me pleasure to assist to the utmost of my
power, with the knowledge and experience I have gained in
Australasia, in co-operating with any manufacturers in this
country, who may do me the honour to communicate with
me on.the subject, in giving effect to the manufacturers’
league which I have taken the liberty to propose after
lengthened premeditation.


CHAPTER VIII.
THE FUTURE OF AUSTRALASIAN TRADE.
Australia, Past and Present—The Seven Colonies.
—Bright Future of Australasia—Prospective
Markets for Australasia. —Relation to Poly-
nesia. Favourable Climate. Minerals and
Agriculture.—Wine and Pastoral Resources.
NOT the least solid ground of assurance that the trade of
Australasia has a bright future is that its development in the
past has been so singularly rapid. It is but a century since
the first thousand settlers from the parent country landed at
Botany Bay, little more than a tenth of whom had left their
native shores voluntarily. About seven-tenths of that num-
ber were convicted criminals, the remaining fraction being
their guards. So completely beyond the pale of prospective
civilisation did Australia and its present dependencies
appear to England’s aristocratic rulers at the close of last
century, that they were content to devote the country solely
to the ignominious use of a penal settlement for transported
malefactors. Not the faintest hope was entertained at the
date of that memorable disembarkation in Port Jackson, that
Australia would ever be erected into a number of self-
governing and self-supporting states; and the vast capabilities
of the island continent were absolutely unknown, and even
undreamt of. The locality inhabited by the pioneer Colony,
and the neighbouring territory, seemed so barren and
inhospitable, that the first Governor was long haunted by the
fear of perishing from hunger, and at first guests invited to
dinner parties at Government House were politely asked to
bring a supply of bread with them. Behold the startling
transformation wrought by the touch of that Aladdin’s lamp,
intelligent human enterprise ! As an eloquent writer has
remarked : “ There is now in existence a cluster of pros-
perous states, individually strong, steadily increasing, self-
governing and self-respectful. They are indissolubly linked
together by mutual affinities and common interests, the
tendency of which, even apart from external pressure, must
inevitably be in the direction of closer union and firmer
consolidation. Collectively, they already constitute a nation
sufficiently important to exercise a powerful influence on the
policy of the Empire of which it forms a part. The territory


which this nation occupies is of sufficient extent to admit of
practically indefinite expansion in population, and is so
situated that it must necessarily continue dominant in that
section of the southern hemisphere to which it belongs.
Sufficiently isolated to run little risk of being involved in
the strifes of nations that are nearest to it, Australia is not
too distant from any of these for peaceful intercourse and
the purposes of trade. The densest populations of the world
are within easy reach of its northern ports, and in its capacity
for supplying many of their wants, there exist commercial
possibilities without limit. To the north-eastward lie the
thickly clustering islands and Archipelagoes of the Pacific,
the latent wealth of which has excited the cupidity of
European nations. In them Australasian enterprise and
energy may find abundant scope.”—(Burgess.)*
The seven Colonies comprised in Australasia have their
respective capitals, each of which has its distinctive feature
of excellence. These attractive cities, which have long been
the wonder of visitors, are interlaced by the electric wire
measuring a total distance of 44,000 miles, and stretching
from the north to the south and from the east to the west of
Australia, and extending thence to New Zealand. The total
population is nearly 4,000,000. The entire group of Colonies is
served by 11,000 miles of railway. The postal returns show
between 6,000 and 7,000 post offices ; through these, in a
recent year, there passed 182,964,326 letters and post cards,
and considerably over 102,465,329 newspapers. The annual
revenue derived from this source is upwards of £2,000,000.
The amount of land in cultivation approaches 10,000,000
acres, from which are raised 35,000,000 bushels of wheat,
half that quantity of oats, and other crops in smaller pro-
portion. The live stock of the Colonies includes 117,000,000
sheep, 1,800,000 horses, and 11,000,000 cattle. The annual
wool exports reach a total of 604,000,000 lbs., representing
an annual and increasing value of nearly £25,000,000. The
aggregate value of gold exported from Australasia up to 1890,
inclusive, was £341,504,963. The Public Saving Banks, in-
cluding both general and Post Office Savings Banks, held in
the same year £17,571,303 on deposit, owned by 695,506
depositors. The collective shipping of the Colonies for 1889
amounted t 015,993,658 tons. In the latter year the grand total
of exports and imports was £51,000,000, the aggregate
revenue about £30,000,000, and the aggregate expenditure
about the same amount.
Yet the vigour of the youth of Australasia may be
taken as the certain prelude of a stalwart manhood. Its

this Chapter.


present immaturity, however, can best be judged by the fact
that the Colonies are still a congeries of unfederated states,
without unity or common organisation, each one erecting
fiscal barriers against its neighbour, and all fomenting reci-
procal jealousy and bitterness in consequence. This attitude
of mutual isolation cannot last very much longer. When it
is remembered that fifty years ago some of the Australasian
Colonies had no existence, and that the fate of others was
doubtful, our surprise is lessened that they should not yet be
united under a federal government. But when federation
does take place, there is no danger of reaction such as
developed in the United States of America on the Negro
question. Nor can any trouble be apprehended from the
proximity of an overpowering multitude of hostile natives.
In Australia and New Zealand the blacks and the Maoris at
best are not numerous, and die out at the approach of the
white man. No part of Australasia can ever be disturbed
again by a native war. No breach of the peace can be
dreaded such as sometimes threatens colonists in South
Africa from the presence of enormous hordes of Kaffirs and
the proximity of disaffected Boers. Owing to the notable
dearth of real statesmen and the occasional trickery of pro-
fessional politicians, who live —not always scrupulously—by
their public vocation, it cannot be denied that mischievous
errors in policy have been committed. In too many of the
Colonies a certain measure of false prosperity has been built
in the last ten years on excessive borrowing from English
investors and reckless loan expenditure. Ruinous speculation
has in too many instances jostled sound and cautious trade
out of its rightful position. Egregious fiscal follies, perpe-
trated by ignorant Treasurers and backed up by still more
ignorant Parliaments, have been described in another chapter
as having seriously crippled trade. These are but transient
outbursts of youthful indiscretion, which cannot fail in time
to be succeeded by sobriety and prudence—the attributes of
mature experience and wise manhood. The day will as-
suredly dawn when Australasia, which fills a position so
transcendently important, geographically, will reign as Queen
of the southern hemisphere, and extend her sceptre over
widespread adjacent insular territory, and the magnitude of
her commerce will be commensurate with her political
supremacy. When that period arrives, her trade will be as
eagerly competed for as her friendship. Her products will
be largely shipped to every coast washed by the ocean, and
in return the shipping of the whole civilised world will
unceasingly pour the wealth of the factory and the field into
her harbours all the year round.
If we recall the cardinal elements of national great-


ness, it will be found that Australasia possesses them all in
embryo. Her territory is sufficiently extensive and pro-
ductive to provide for an immense population. It is true
that size is not always co-ordinate with productiveness, but
as acquaintance with the soil of Australasia increases, it is
found that wastes once regarded as hopelessly barren, shrink
into smaller and smaller proportions. Tried by the test of
territorial extent, Australasia may fairly claim eventual pre-
dominance south of the line. A hasty glance at the map
almost conveys the impression that Australasia is incon-
veniently remote from the busy haunts of civilisation, and
especially from the centre of the British Empire. But
already passengers are conveyed to Sydney by the overland
route to Italy, thence by sea to Adelaide, and from the latter
port by rail to Sydney in as many days as the first fleet occu-
pied weeks on the voyage. Overland telegraphs through
Europe, Asia and Australia, and under-sea cables between
the Stiaits Settlements and Port Darwin, have practically
annihilated the space dividing the Antipodean Colonies from
the parent country. The prices of all leading commodities
in the markets of Europe, Asia, Africa and America are
known daily in every leading town of Australia, from Christ-
church in New Zealand to Perth in Western Australia. The
Australian exporter of wool, fruit, wine, frozen meat, or
dairy produce, through the telegraphic facilities at his com-
mand, is able as accurately to choose his foreign market as
if he were übiquitous. Nor have we by any means reached
finality in the reduction of the time required to pass from
England to Australia.
There is very little doubt that the shortest route to that
destination will ultimately be by railways through Europe,
Asiatic Turkey, India and the Malay Peninsula. From Sin-
gapore a fast line of steamers will run to Port Darwin in the
north of Australia. From that port a central railway will be
laid through the imiddle of the country, and branches will
diverge east and west, connecting with the various Colonies,
while the existing railway running without a break from
Brisbane in Queensland to Port Augusta in South Australia,
will be continued across Western Australia to join the pro-
posed line from York to Yilgarn, and the present Government
line from Beverley to Fremantle. Meanwhile the marvellous
and rapid development of the metallic and mineral resources
of Western Australia, the vast tracts of superior arable land
available, and the fine climate in the south-western district
of that Colony, combine to draw population from the eastern
Colonies and other parts of the world, by whose skill and
energy countless profitable industries will be established.
The writer already quoted, remarks : “ The increasing


appreciation of tropical products, and trade with the Poly-
nesian islands, introduces another aspect of the case. Both
European and American traders are competing keenly for
ascendancy in that part of the world, and in some cases,
they are strongly sustained by their respective governments.
Geographical relations render it inevitable that the Eastern
Australian ports will become more and more the em-
poriums for the Polynesian trade, receiving and utilising
the products of those islands, and sending them, in exchange,
commodities which will always be in increasing demand.
Proximity to New Guinea, which has splendid but un-
developed capabilities, to the great Archipelago sometimes
called Malaysia, including Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and many
other islands and island groups, and still farther to the
north-east, to the densely inhabited peninsulas of Southern
Asia, must also be reckoned as a geographical advantage that
may be fraught with immense results. Most important of all
is the prospect in relation to China and India. Should the
demand arise, which it is reasonable to expect, among the
swarming millions of these countries for Australian products,
the impetus it must give to Australian progress is incalculable.
Australian horse stock is favourably known in India, and the
practicability of obtaining remounts for the Indian Cavalry
—bred on unsurpassed grazing plains, acclimatised while
travelling through the Continent, and shipped from Port
Darwin—has received powerful support. Australian fabrics
are scarely known to Asiatics, but the Chinese Commissioners
who recently visited Australia, gave strong grounds for the
belief that their introduction would be followed by a general
demand. These facts open up a view of almost boundless
trade, for, with the interchange of staple commodities, others
will necessarily be associated, and the manufacturing, as
well as producing and commercial interests be stimulated in
a very high degree. The abbreviation of time and space by
modern art and science, the geographical relation of
Australia to Polynesia, Malaysia, and the dense populations
of Southern Asia, and its capability for supplying many of
their wants, make the conclusion irresistible, that instead of
being out of the way, Australia is exactly in the way of what
must contribute to make it a great industrial and commercial
nation.”
A climate favourable to the development of internal
resources by white men is an indispensable condition of
great national expansion, and this advantage, for the most
part, is enjoyed by Australasia. About three-fifths of
the Australian continent lies to the south of the tropic
of Capricorn. Consequently, the major part of the great
island continent lies within the temperate zone, which


also incloses Tasmania and New Zealand. Judging by the
example of Queensland, there seems a disposition to employ
natives of the tropics to bear the heat and burden of
Australian labour within the tropics. In the northern
hemisphere, the proportion of the habitable land in the
temperate zone, and, as a matter of course of population, is
immeasurably greater than within the corresponding latitudes
in the southern hemisphere. In addition to parts of
Australasia there are only two terrestrial portions of the
world’s surface included in the temperate zone. I refer to
that section of the African peninsula which terminates with
the Cape of Good Hope, and the South American peninsula,
ending at Cape Horn. “ The Australasian Colonies embrace
about one-third of the total land just described. The corre-
sponding thermal division of the northern half of the globe
comprised in the temperate zone takes in part of Africa,
nearly the whole of Asia, Europe and North America.
Beyond the lower boundary of the arctic circle, the eternal
ice cap opposes a barrier to great national development. On the
other hand the vertical rays of the sun at the tropics tend to
wither up human energy, and restrict the progress of human
enterprise.” The dominant types of mankind always have
occupied, and always will occupy temperate latitudes.
If residing in a temperate zone conduces to the highest
development of civilisation, it is plain that Australians in-
habiting a larger proportion of land within that zone in the
southern hemisphere than any other branch of a progressive
race, must assert and maintain ascendancy over all other
nationalities in the same hemisphere.
It is suggestive of the splendid future in store for Australa-
sia, that the latitude of the leading Colonies is almost the
exact counterpart of that of the Mediterranean in the northern
hemisphere, on which the most magnificent achievements
of the human mind were enacted. “ Sydney and Adelaide
border on the corresponding parallel of latitude in the south
to that which runs through Cyprus. Similarly, the capital
of New Zealand is about equidistant from the equator with
Rome, Melbourne with Athens, and Hobart with Florence.
If the Australasian Colonies were placed on identical
parallels of latitude in the north to those they actually
occupy in the south they would stretch from Switzerland,
over Italy, Greece, and Egypt. It would be absurd to reckon
absolutely upon similar climate ensuring the reproduction
in Australia of Swiss patriotism, Roman power of adminis-
tration, Greek culture, and Egyptian industry. It must not
be forgotten that the modern inhabitants of Greece, Italy,
and Egypt, as a whole, fall far below the standard reached
by an exceptionally large proportion of their immortal


ancestors. On the other hand the process of transplanting is
admitted to be favourable, under given conditions, to vege-
table life, and we know the effect is not less beneficial upon
animal life. There seems no reason to doubt that the hardy
Anglo-Saxon race will improve under the sunny skies of
Australasia.” The ozone generated in the vast Eucalyptus
forests and swept by northerly winds towards the southern
coast, renders the air balmy with health-giving vitality.
Active employment in the open air is possible throughout
the habitable parts of Australasia all the year round. The
few days of hot wind recurring annually "kill malaria, and
the winter cold, which rarely assumes the forms of frost and
snow on the Australasian coasts, except in the south of New
Zealand, has a wholesome bracing effect on healthy constitu-
tions. Of the far north it is not necessary to speak, except
to repeat that the territory within the tropics can always be
cultivated by ttopical labour. Provided no corrupting influ-
ences in social and domestic life, in parliamentary regime , in
government, or in the tastes and habits of the population,
are allowed to creep in and counteract aspirations after
exalted ideals, it would not be easy to find a country in
which the conditions of climate are better suited for the
development of a type of mankind superior in physical and
intellectual attributes.
If superabundant latent wealth can mark out any terri-
tories as a real “ land of promise,” we are specially justified,
in applying this designation to Australasia. In Minerals—
coal, iron, gold, silver, copper, tin, zinc, lead, platinum,
antimony, bismuth, plumbago, manganese, cobalt, and many
others may be specified, although in some instances, includ-
ing iron, the cost of labour is too high for profitable working,
relatively to the present market value of the product. Apart
from gold which is almost universally distributed through-
out Australasia, silver, in the last few years, has enriched
mining proprietors beyond the dreams of avarice. Regions
bearing silver, copper, and gold are already discovered which
cover tens of thousands of square miles. Burgess states that
concurrent testimony of geologists, mineralogists, and
practical miners is that the minerals which have been
exhumed are no more to those that still lie hidden than is
the froth on a glass of champagne to the sparkling wine
beneath it.” As regards Agricultural products , it may be
mentioned that the extent of arable land actually under the
plough in the entire country is greater than the kingdom of
Belgium, and the total cultivation covers a larger area than
that of Greece. Besides cereals indigenous to the temperate
zone, the tropical latitudes in the north produce rice, sugar,
coffee, and many other articles under the head of necessaries


or luxuries. The oranges and grapes match the best to be
found in the South of Europe.
The wine industry bids fair to be be one of the most pros-
perous connected with the soil in these Colonies. “ Among
Australian hills and valleys, in Tasmania and some parts of
New Zealand, apples, pears, plums, peaches, apricots, straw-
berries, currants, and, in short, the entire range of horticultural
products attain a size and delicacy of flavour which, in de-
scription, provokes incredulity. Hitherto, extremely little has
been done to preserve and utilise for export these choice gifts
of nature. The prodigal waste in our gardens and orchards
is shameful. ... So far from these resources having been
fully developed, a modification of their treatment is even
now taking place that will be tantamount to a recommence-
ment, involving possibilities and prospects that can scarcely
be over-estimated.”
The capacity for increasing Pastoral ivealth , which is
already prodigious, is practically illimitable. In live stock
Australasians are proportionately the richest people in the
world. Expressed in cash value, the ever-increasing produce
of their flocks and herds is immense. Taking the export of
wool alone, the average increase is about a million sterling
per annum. The export of frozen meat expands into large
dimensions. As to Population , it is estimated to double itself
in less than twenty years. Should nothing occur to check
this rate of increase, it is expected that at the end of the
third half-century of Australasian history the number of
inhabitants will exceed that of any European nation, except
that of the leading Powers, Russia, Germany, France,
Austria, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. In enter-
prise, courage and perseverance, the rising generation are in
no sense unworthy of their fathers ; and when all the vital
factors surrounding them have time to tell, with due force,
upon their individual, domestic, social and national life, it
may be confidently affirmed that business relations between
so energetic and dauntless a race and the outside world must
gradually develop upon a gigantic scale. It is for British
manufacturers to determine whether they will take full
advantage of the exceptional trade opening thus presented,
and are prepared to adopt measures promptly for studying
the tastes and meeting the trade requirements of their kins-
men in this group of Colonies, which in process of time will
inevitably become welded into national solidarity; and, with
federation, which cannot be far off, they will burst that
odious fiscal bondage by which their acquisition of trading
wealth has been so seriously hampered.


fl SHORT HISTORY Op fl FAMOUS HOUSE
ON October 13, 1889, there died, at her palatial residence, the
Chateau la Muette, near Paris, a venerable lady reputed to be
one of the wealthiest in Europe, and as generous as she was wealthy.
The name borne by this lady was one that, for a century and a quarter,
has been well and honourably known “ the wide world o’er.” The lady
in question was none other than Elizabeth Camille Erard, the widow of
Pierre Erard, and the niece, through him, of Sebastian Erard, the
founder of one of the grandest manufacturing firms in the world, and
of whom it has been truly said, “ that, in his own peculiar line, he was
doubtless the greatest mechanician that ever lived.”
The recent recurrence of the anniversary of Mme. Erard’s death
leads to the reflection, that while the history of a violin by Amati,
Stradivarius, or another celebrated maker, is one of perennial and
unceasing interest to its proud possessor, her sister, the gentlewoman
who has as one of her most valued belongings a pianoforte by these
most celebrated makers, knows little or nothing concerning the circum-
stances of its history. This is the more remarkable seeing how close
is the bond linking the instrument and its owner, and the capabilities
the pianoforte possesses of doubling her joys and sharing her griefs.
Is it possible that if she knew some of the many vicissitudes through
which her friend had passed, before it became possessed of all its
marvellous powers to charm, she would appreciate it less ?
We incline to the belief that, on the contrary, the gentlewoman
"would value her possession the more if she knew that the pianoforte
lias at least as romantic a history as any of which its fair owner can
boast. Unfortunately for our purpose, we have not the space at our
disposal afforded by a three-volume novel, and we have consequently
to be as brief as the interesting nature of the topic will permit. We
■can only hope, however, that our account will prove sufficiently
.entertaining to induce our fair readers to follow up the romantic history
■of the pianoforte in general, and the Erard pianoforte in particular.
We suppose that all are aware that “ Once upon a time ” the pianoforte
“was not,” or did not occupy the distinguished position it now does
among our Lares and Penates. The mother, grandmother, and great-
grandmother of the pianoforte were respectively the harpsichord, the
spinet, and the virginal. The virginal (so named in honour of the


maidens who played upon it) was an instrument upon which Queen
Elizabeth and her kinswoman and rival, Mary Queen of Scots, both
excelled. Indeed, the Scotch Queen’s ambassador to the Court of
Elizabeth once found it difficult to reply to the latter’s inquiry as to
which Queen was the better performer. Nowadays, these relics of
bygone ages are looked upon simply as such, and their place is more
than filled by the modern pianoforte.
To no one, more than to Sebastian Erard, is the present perfection of
the pianoforte due. The precocious youth who, at the age of thirteen,
climbed the Strasburg steeple and sat on the top of the cross, may be
said—albeit ever a peaceable and law-abiding citizen—to have breathed,
actively and passively, revolution all his days. The crude attempts of
his early contemporaries to improve the harpsichord were overwhelmed
by Sebastian Erard’s masterly developments of the pianoforte; and
five years after the foundation of his firm in Paris, he had so turned the
tide in his favour by his marvellous ingenuity, that the jealousy of his
rivals and their fear was excited lest their occupation should be gone,
and their craft endangered by the popularity of the new instrument.
Had it not been for the intervention of the Duchess of Villeroi (one
of Sebastian Erard’s noble patrons), who influenced King Louis XVI. to
bestow a special “brevet” in 1785 upon the enterprising brothers,
Sebastian and Jean Batiste Erard, empowering them to carry on their
factory without molestation, it would probably have gone hard with
them. That they prospered amazingly is evident from the fact that
only seven years later, Sebastian Erard was able to purchase the
Chateau la Muette, a favourite hunting-box of Louis XVI. This he
did when, during the imprisonment of the unfortunate King, the Royal
palaces were put up for sale by auction.
The story is told of Sebastian Erard’s visiting the King in the
Temple, to announce the fact that he had purchased the Chateau, only
with the intention of returning it to his Royal benefactor when happier
days should come. The King is reported to have replied that he
“ could not have wished the place to fall into better hands.” The
Chateau la Muette, however, still belongs to Sebastian Erard’s descend-
ants, and here it was that, as we mentioned above, Madame Erard died
in 1889. Some idea of the vast size of the estate may be gathered
from the fact that, in Madame Erard’s lifetime, no less than thirty
gardeners were kept constantly employed upon the ornamental grounds'.
But to return to Sebastian Erard. Revolution drove him and his

brother from Paris in 1794, and for two years they were refugees, laying
then the foundation of that splendid business at 18, Great Marlborough-
street, London, which is still in our day in the very heyday of its pros-
perity. “The crowning achievement of Sebastian Erard’s life and still
the proudest distinction of the firm he established was undoubtedly,”
says the writer of a leading article in The Daily Telegraph of January 5,
1888, “the invention of the famous repetition action,” whereby the
power of repetition of a note is increased about fourfold. This invention
was patented in 1821, and on account of its great value and the heavy
losses sustained in working and perfecting it, the very exceptional
privilege was granted to the firm by the Privy Council of Great Britain,
in 1835, of a renewal of the patent.
The question of imparting instantly and unimpaired the beauty, in-
tensity, and sensibility from the touch of the fingers on the ivory keys
to the strings was one that had long occupied Sebastian Erard’s head.
“ He had grown old,” writes Mr. Hipkins, “ before the full accomplish-
ment of his idea, and his famous repetition action—whereby power is
regained over the hammer before the key returns to equilibrium—was
patented in London by Pierre Erard, his nephew.”
The Times of May 7, 1851, speaking of the Erard pianos in the Great
Exhibition, very lucidly refers to the piano before the introduction of
Sebastian Erard’s invention. “ Not only,” says The Times , “ was the
touch heavy, but a positive limit was imposed upon the player, which no
skill or ingenuity could exceed. When the key was depressed so as to
strike the note, it was necessary before the same note could be repeated
to allow it to rise to its position of rest. The rapidity and promptitude
of this ascent was not under the performer’s control. It had to be re-
peated before the same note could be repeated at shorter intervals than
those which were compatible with the complete elevation of the keys.”
All these disadvantages were removed by Erard’s invention of the
repetition action or “ double escapement,” and a new era dawned for
the pianoforte. Hummel, Liszt, Thalberg, Mendelssohn, Moscheles,
Wagner, and other great pianists and musicians of a bygone generation,
and Rubinstein, Mme. Schumann, Paderewski, and Stavenhagen among
those still living, have testified how much of their success is due to the
marvellous powers of the Erard pianoforte. It is a truism to say, that
without the repetition action invented by Erard, many of the compositions
of the above-named distinguished musicians, owing to their excessive
rapidity, simply could not be played.
98
A Short History of a Famous House.


If imitation be the sincerest flattery, which, as children, we have
written so many times at school, what better testimony can be adduced
than that of a most unimpeachable, impartial, and well-known writer,
who, in a popular guide to the Inventions Exhibition of 1885 (where,
by the way, Messrs. Erard did not exhibit), wrote in reference to Erard’s
repetition action as follows : —“ Every maker since Erard has adopted
some modification of it;” and again, “some makers adopt actions which
are copies of Erard’s.” And then there is the unbiassed testimony of
the famous Anton Rubinstein, who said, “ But there is only one piano—
the Erard; as to the others, they are but imitations ! ”
We cordially recommend our readers, before deciding on purchasing
their pianos elsewhere, to discover for themselves the virtue of our
recommendation by visiting Messrs. S. & P. Erard’s establishment at
18, Great Marlborough Street, Regent Street, London, the better that
an opinion can be formed as to the sweetness of tone and beauty of
construction of these world-famed pianos.
No pleasanter half-hour could be spent other than in the showrooms
of this famous firm, under the guidance of some of those employes who
have grown old in the service of the famous house, and to whom the
name of Erard is a honoured one indeed.
But to those who are unable, through distance, to personally select
the instrument required, we can confidently recommend them to apply
for particulars of these pianofortes and harps. Messrs. Erard make a
great feature of personal attention to foreign trade, and will take special
pains to themselves select any order for Australia or New Zealand, as
they most firmly believe in dealing directly with their customers, and
know that the sterling value of their world-famous pianos can command
the market wherever they are known.
In affording this short history of the firm of Erard nearly the whole
history of the pianoforte is comprised.
