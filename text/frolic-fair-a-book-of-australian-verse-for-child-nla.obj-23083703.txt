“I have nothing but good to say of this
little book. Its whole plan shows a very
practical and sympathetic knowledge of
the difficulties of little children. If the
hints given in the preface are followed,
spelling may be made an interesting game
that will add many new words to the
child’s vocabulary.”

AN ADVENTURE STORY
was once a man who was elephant
strong,
Who trundled a rabbit-o barrow along,
Till the wind blew him on with a squeal and a
whiff, .
Right up to the edge of the Beaumaris Cliff.
But he didn't fall over —
No! He didn’t fall over —
An aeroplane passed, and he cried, What a
boon!”
And stepped on its tail and flew up to the moon.
The pilot said “Drop it,
Or I’ll have to stop it,
I don’t want to go into Heaven so soon!
But he didn’t let go it!
No! He didn’t let go it!
The rabbit-o man who was elephant strong
Caught hold of a star as they hurried along;
And he said: “I shall carry this planet with
me!”
And when he got home and had finished his tea,
He hammered it into small sparkling bits,
And day after day at our school-gate he sits;


And when all the children come out for their
lunch,
He sells them the sparklets a penny a bunch;
And evening by evening, as everyone knows,
Richer and richer and richer he grows.
Furnley Maurice.
A POEM ’BOUT ME
‘ y\RE you really the poetry-maker,
That writes in the papers we see?
Oh! I like little poems ’bout children —
Will you make a poem ’bout me ?
I m not sick, like the hospital babies,
I know I’m as strong as can be;
Can t you write about well little people?—
Please make up a poem ’bout me!”
‘T am really the poetry-maker,
My darling,” I said with a smile;
‘T can write about ‘well’ little people,
r In verse that would stretch to a mile.
You can stand and look over my shoulder
To say what I’ve written is true;
Hold the sheet with your fat little finger—
I’m writing a poem ’bout you.”


“There’s a certain small girl in the city,
Her face is as round as a rose;
She has curled, sunny hair, all a-tangle,
Blue eyes and a snub little nose;
Rosy lips has this dear little maiden,
The reddest of cheeks ever seen,
And the brownest of wee, dimpled fingers
I see they are not over clean!
“Now, this dear little girl in the city,
(Her face is as round as a rose),
Tears most terrible rents in her dresses,
And wears all her shoes at the toes.
Listen, reader, I'll tell you a secret,
Of what this small lady can do.
Now, my dear little midget, stand steady,
Bm writing a poem ’bout you.
“Up the biggest old gum in the garden
Those worn little slippers can climb . .
“Oh! yes, say all about the tame possum
I got for the children that time.
And do tell how the fat gander chased me
’Till I was as scared as could be—
You are really a good poetry-maker—
I do like this poem ’bout me!
“Say the puppies got into the garden,
And spoilt all the plants that I set;
Tell how Kitty’s poor dolly was ruined
Through being left out in the wet.


And you might as well say I’m not speaking
To Nellie or Millicent Fife;
They are truly the horridest children
I ever played with in my life.
‘‘Put in all about Alec’s new pony —
I’m going to ride him some day;
And the cat with the snow r y white kittens,
That mother is giving away;
And say, too, we have got a retriever,
That swims like a fish in the sea —
Oh! I think you are getting on grandly;
This is a nice poem ’bout me!”
So I write in the sunshiny morning,
My dear little friend at my side,
With her pretty lips rosily parted,
The clear childish eyes open wide;
And I pray that her innocent sweetness
Unspoilt and unsullied may be,
That no future may mock the soft query,
“Can you make a poem ’bout me?”
Jennings Carmichael.


A SAD DOG
PUPPY saw a pussy-cat
( Girr! bow-wow!)
And on a gate the pussy sat
(Pht! meee-ow!).
Though pussy’s tail began to whisk,
The puppy-dog began to frisk;
And then he took an awful risk:
He said “bow-wow!”
A rude “bow-wow!”
“Pht! meee-ow!”
Then up the angry pussy rose,
The claws came out from all her toes
She scratched the puppy on the nose
For saying “bow-wow!”
Though dogs delight to bark and bite
’Tis better far to be polite.
Ann O’Nym.


ASLEEP AND AWAKE
WHEN John is asleep, he is tucked up in bed
With a fat little fist doubled under his head,
His faithful old golliwog clutched in one arm,
As if to protect that dark treasure from harm;
His books and his toys neatly packed on their
shelves,
And his dreams a queer medley of fairies and
elves,
A cherub, though possibly not quite so grubby,
Has never been painted more peaceful and
chubby.
When John is awake, and he’s dressed for the
day,
Our cook hides the jam and the biscuits away;
The cat disappears with her tail in the air,
And the pup makes a bolt for his own secret
lair.
All over the house there is romping and noise,
It sounds, you imagine, like dozens of boys.
Of sitting quite still, John has not the least
notion —
I believe we’ve discovered perpetual motion.
Alex. Scott.


A PUSSY-WILLOW PUSSY
J have asked a lot of people,
But they always answer me,
“You can never find a pussy
In a Pussy-Willow Tree.”
And it seems so strange and silly;
For wherever should they be?
It’s the proper place for pussies,
In a Pussy-Willow Tree.
I will always look up quickly,
Never think to pass one by,
'Cos I think they must be hiding,
For they may be rather shy.
If you ever, ever miss me,
I will tell you where I’ll be;
I’ll be looking for a pussy
In a Pussy-Willow Tree.
Sonia Hardie.


BEDTIME
JF once I didn’t go to bed, I shouldn’t get the
blame,
For everybody that I know calls bed a different
name;
Mummie says, “Come, sleepy boy, away to
Bye-Low Land,”
How can a chap know what that means. How
can he understand?
Then sister says, “The Sandman s here, to
carry you away,
You’re going to sail the Sea of Dreams, and
stop at Blanket Bay,’ .
While every night the Hello Man says, Time,
I think, don’t you,
For boys and girls to go to sleep?—so off to
Bunkey-doo.”
And though I stretch my eyes out wide as wide
as anything, . , , . .
My brother says, “Its eight o clock, come on,
old boy, turn in.”
No wonder that I’m puzzled at what they all
have said,
It’s simply great to hear dad say, Low, Sonny,
off to bed.”
Joyce Owen Starr.


BROLGAS
gROLGAS, Brolgas, out on the plain,
Do go on with your dance again—
In and out, in and out,
Set to partners and turn about;
Skip and hop, skip and hop,
Flap your wings, and then you stop.
Brolgas, Brolgas, out on the plain,
Dance for me, dance for me, once again;
Stretch your necks, and clap your beaks,
I could watch you for weeks and weeks.
Brolgas, Brolgas, out on the plain,
Why do you dance in the wind and rain ?
In and out, in and out,
Set to partners and turn about;
Skip and hop, skip and hop,
Flap your wings, and then you stop.
The Perfesser and Alter Ego.


CAREERS
'Y\/HEN Timothy grows up to be
The age of nine or ten,
He wants to follow in the steps
Of dashing tramway men;
The guard who yells out “Right you are"
And wears a peaky cap,
And hands a sort of spanner, to
The other tramway chap.
But when the winter’s awfully cold,
Or in the summer heat,
He’d like to be a gang-way man
And shout out “Mind your feet.”
He’d drop the gang-plank with a plonk,
And pull the fog-horn cord,
He’d twine the rope with dead-shot aim
To hold her tightly moored.
And then, how choc-a-block of thrills
A policeman’s life must be!
Oh! What a lot of murderers
And burglars he must see!


CHILD SONG OF THE RAIN
But Timothy would like to plod
A slow and weary beat,
A pair of handcuffs stowed away,
And pistol all complete.
He’d bail the frightened burglars up,
And ply his baton well,
He’d march them to the station-house
And lock them in a cell.
But when it’s dark at half-past six
And cold, he’ll oft confide,
He’d rather be a little boy,
So snugly warm inside.
Joan S. Mackaness.
CHILD SONG OF THE RAIN
green rain from the dark of the sky;
I am sure you are green, for the grass was
so dry,
And you painted it over and made it all spring
Till the little birds listening could hear the
blades sing.
And somebody peeping
Saw God Himself weeping,
With the world for a handkerchief pressed to
His eye.


Perhaps He was crying for Brian and me.
For the little birds chirped and were happy and
free;
And we must stay in with a doll and a book,
And could only tiptoe to the window and look
Through a sprinkly old pane,
While the little green rain
Was kissing the spiders away from the tree.
Little green rain, go away by and by,
And tell the good sun to come out in the sky;
And if God feels so sorry for Brian and me,
Just tell him how cleanly you’ve washed His
old tree,
And perhaps He’ll be kind,
And to-morrow we’ll find
He’s spread His big handkerchief nicely to dry.
David McKee Wright.


CLEANING DAY
is a fairy who must work
To mend the holes of heaven,
Another fairy shines the stars
And hangs them up by seven.
A fairy, on a fairy steed
Must pass through lands by night,
To gather all the blue she can
To fill her bucket bright.
Then, when 'tis fairy cleaning day,
To make the world look new,
The fairies all, paint-brush in hand,
Then paint the heavens blue.
Eva Lawton.


CRADLE SONG
O baby, fain you are for bed,
Magpie to mopoke busy as the bee;
The little red calf’s in the snug cow-shed,
An’ the little brown bird's in the tree.
Daddy’s gone a-shearin’, down the Castlereagh,
So we’re all alone now, only you an’ me.
All among the wool-O, keep your wide blades
fnll-O,
Daddy loves his baby, parted tho’ he be.
Baby, my baby, rest your drowsy head,
The one man that works here, tired you must
be.
The little red calf’s in the snug cow-shed,
An’ the little brown bird’s in the tree.
Louis Esson.


DOCTOR BROWN
WHEN I am old (say, twenty-three),
A doctor’s what I mean to be;
I’ll have a car, but when I call,
My patients won’t be sad at all,
For I shall say, “Now, Mrs Green,
These children must have no quinine,
No castor oil, no plates of rice,
And porridge once a week, not twice;
Don't give them nasty stuff to drink
That smells like tar, and tastes like ink.”
Therefore, instead of looking glum.
They’ll all be cheerful when I come.
My bottles will be good to take,
And whooping-cough I’ll cure with cake;
No horrid medicine will be made,
I’ll recommend some lemonade,
And one ice-cream, at least, per day,
Will keep a host of ills away.
But if the children do feel queer
This is what you are sure to hear,
“Please send at once for Doctor Brown,
He’s quite the nicest one in town.”
Alex. Scott.


DREAM-TRAVEL
W? HO would go to Egypt?
Who would go to Spain ?
Take a fairy ticket
There and back again.
Here’s a browny date-stone
On it I have been
Far away to deserts
With the palm-trees green.
I have been to Cairo
I have seen the Nile,
And the lovely lady
Cleopatra smile.
She was standing waiting
By the Sphinx that night;
And she laughed and showed me
Every wondrous sight.
There I saw old ruins,
There I saw the sand —
Pyramid and palace,
Holding tight her hand.


When she stooped to kiss me
Bidding me good-bye
Mother came and waked me
With a little cry.
I was only sleeping
With a brown date-stone
Under my white pillow;
But I went alone
Far away to Egypt.
When night comes again,
On a lemon blossom
I shall go to Spain.
Zora Cross.
DUSK IN THE DOMAIN
J7LF-LIGHT, owl-light,
Elfin-green sky;
Under the fig-trees
Bats flit by.
Under the fig-trees
Sprawl in a ring
Slim-limbed courtiers,
Brown Elf King.


Crowned with autumn’s
Tawny gold,
Lizard-eyed, cricket-thighed,
Neither young nor old:
Like the fig-leaves’
Broad yellow wreath
Round each forehead —like
The waves beneath
Lipping the weed-hung
Low sea-wall—
Ageless, careless
Lords of all!
Grey rock-monsters
Out of the grass
Heaved, lie staring;
Moths drift past
On their business —
None have the elves,
Who hold high festival
By themselves.
So I saw them
Very plain,
Green-dusky Elfland,
Their Domain.


So I saw them
As I went through:
Seven slum children from
Woolloomooloo!
Dorothea Mackellar.
FOUR AUSTRALIAN NURSERY
RHYMES
'“pHE man from Menindie was counting sheep;
He counted so many he went to sleep.
He counted by threes and he counted by twos,
The rams and the lambs and the wethers and
ewes;
He counted a thousand, a hundred and ten —
And when he woke up he’d to count them again.
David H. Souter.
Little Billy Bandicoot
For potatoes loves to root,
Eats them till his skin is tight,
All the long black foggy night.
E.M.T.


Little Ji-ka Ji-ka! All the darkies like her
In her dainty Sunday dress and pinny.
Give her wattle-blossom and a joey possum —
She’s a good Australian piccaninny.
And she lives outside Benalla with her father,
Doutta Galla,
Who eats snakes for breakfast till he’s pale.
He kills them with a waddy, and devours the
head and body—
And little Ji-ka Ji-ka eats the tail!
What are you doing
O little grey bear ?
What are you chewing
O little grey bear ?
Sitting on mother’s back
Having a ride,
Eating the gum-leaves
Among which you hide.
You are so happy
A-hiding up there,
Can baby come up to you,
Little grey bear?
Ethel Pawley.


HIST!
J-JIST! Hark!
The night is very dark.
And we’ve to go a mile or so
Across the Possum Park.
Step light,
Keeping to the right;
If we delay, and lose our way,
We’ll be out half the night.
The clouds are low and gloomy. Oh!
It’s just begun to mist!
We haven’t any overcoats
And—Hist! Hist!
(Mo poke!)
Who was that that spoke?
This is not a fitting spot
To make a silly joke.
Dear me!
A mopoke in a tree!
It jarred me so, I didn’t know
Whatever it could be.


But come along; creep along;
Soon we shall be missed.
They’ll get a scare and wonder where
We—Hush! Hist!
Ssh! Soft!
I’ve told you oft and oft
We should not stray so far away
Without a moon aloft.
Oo! Scat!
Goodness! What was that?
Upon my word, it’s quite absurd,
It’s only just a cat.
But come along; haste along;
Soon we’ll have to rush,
Or we’ll be late, and find the gate
Is—Hist! Hush!
( Kok\ KorrockX)
Oh! I’ve had a shock!
I hope and trust it’s only just
A frog behind a rock.
Shoo! Shoo!
We’ve had enough of you;
Scaring folk just for a joke
Is not the thing to do.
But come along, slip along—
Isn’t it a lark
Just to roam so far from home
On —Hist! Hark!


Look! See!
Shining through the tree,
The window-light is glowing bright
To welcome you and me.
Shout! Shout!
There’s someone round about,
And through the door I see some more
And supper all laid out.
Now, run! Run! Run!
Oh, we’ve had such splendid fun —
Through the park in the dark,
As brave as anyone.
Laughed, we did, and chaffed, we did,
And whistled all the way,
And we’re home again!; Home again
Hip Hooray!
J. Dennis.


HOME
'Y\/HEN I go down the village,
To buy the things for tea,
Each house I pass along the way,
Calls something out to me.
There’s Mr Brown’s, named “Wevegotfun,
With garden paths askew,
It winks a window-sash at me,
And cries, “How do you do?”
But Mrs Harley-Smithson-Jones’
Home in Clarence Square
Says, “Hurry now, please, little boy,
And do not stop and stare.”
While Miss Prim’s spotless bungalow
In Abercrombie Street,
Shrills, “When you pass, tread on tiptoe
And do not drag your feet.”
At last I pass old Mr Bright’s,
It smiles, “You’re welcome here,”
While just next door, old Mrs 'Gloom’s
Groans out, “Oh dearie dear!”


But when I’ve scampered up the hill
Past gable, roof and dome,
There is a house I love the best,
It says, “Come in. You’re home.’’
Joyce Owen Starr.
JOHN’S BATH
bath a boy like John, aged three,
May seem as simple as can be;
But if you think that this is so,
It’s clear that John you do not know.
The bath you fill with quite a lot
Of water, hot, but not too hot;
Then into this you quickly plunge
Young John, a loofah, and a sponge;
Next you must find a rubber frog,
An empty tin, a gollywog,
Two clothes-pegs (one’s the Manly boat),
A duck that long has ceased to float.
A nail-brush —not to make John clean—
It really is a submarine.
With elbow-grease and lots of soap
The imp should soon be scrubbed, you hope
But still your task is far from done,
For now begins the nightly fun.


John dives and splashes, whoops with joy,
And says, ‘‘lt’s just like Collaroy.”
“Once more,” he begs, and then, “once more.’
A header swamps the bathroom floor.
All evening would the fun go on
If no one vetoed Master John.
You steel your heart, and with a tug
At last you quietly pull the plug.
Alex. Scott.
LOLLIPOPS
QH! Lollipop city is modern and pretty,
The people who live there are sweet;
There is Peppermint Pop, he keeps a small shop,
And knows everyone in the street.
He’s acquainted indeed, with Annette Aniseed
Who married a Jelly Bean brown,
And he’ll tell you, will Pop, of old Aunt Acid
Drop,
With her Hundreds and Thousands up town.
He will talk of Sherbert, who’s his nephew
alert,
And the Mixtures he meets everyday,
He knows Marzipan, an old foreign man,
And the Allsorts just over the way.


Pop rather looks down on the Hardboiled in
Town
When they whisper, and giggle and nudge,
And in accents elated, says he is related
To that rich old American Fudge.
Oh! Lollipop Town is quite full of renown,
With its bungalows Chocolate Cream,
The Hotels in a block of Bulgarian Rock,
In fact, the whole city’s a dream.
Pixie O’Harris.
MAKE BELIEVE
QH! I will be an Esquimo, and build a wee
igloo,
Or I will be an Indian, with feathers red and
blue.
Perhaps I’ll be a little Jap, and wave a little fan,
Or else I’ll paint my face so black, and be an
African.
A Chinese boy will Billy be, his eyes he down-
ward slants,
Or else a Dutchie with his pipe, and patches in
his pants.
A Maori also he will be, a haka he will dance,
Then be a little Don from Spain, and then a
boy from France.
Charles W. Hilsox.


MOTHER SAYS
MOTHER says
Have you done your scales, Peter John?
Have you cleaned your nails, Peter John?
Go and tidy up your toys, Peter John,
Don’t make such a dreadful noise, Peter John
If she said
Put your lesson books away, Peter John,
And let’s go to the beach to-day, Peter John,
No, you needn’t eat that rice, Peter John,
Come and have a strawberry ice, Peter John?
If Mother said that,
Well!
Joyce Owen Starr.


NOT A CENTIPEDE
J’M very, very glad indeed
That I am not a centipede,
For think of walking in the street
Or garden with a hundred feet!
For how they would get in my way
Whenever I went out to play,
And oh, how cross my nurse would get
If all my hundred feet got wet!
Suppose, when I began to run.
That half my feet should stop, for fun,
While fifty more went rushing past —
What would become of me at last ?
And oh, what pain if some one chose
To tread on my five hundred toes!
Oh, yes, Pm sure I’m quite agreed
I would not be a centipede.
Ruth M. Bedford.


OITHONA’S LULLABY
do you hear your mother sea
Calling, calling, calling,
Where the long white breakers be,
Where the waves are falling?
Calling Oithona,
Calling Oithona,
Calling Oithona, “Come, come to sleep.”
J. Le Gay Brereton.
PADDY’S MARKET
WENT down to Paddy’s Market
On a Friday night.
Lights aglitter, fruit alitter,
Pleasant smells, so queer, and bitter.
I went down to Paddy’s Market
On a Friday night.
I went down to Paddy’s Market
Just to have a look.
Chinese fellow, old and yellow,
Selling melons, ripe and mellow.
I went down to Paddy’s Market,
Just to have a look.


PUFF-TAIL PETER
I went down to Paddy’s Market
Feeling very gay.
Dusty pages —birds in cages,
I bought one with my week’s wages.
I came back from Paddy’s Market,
Let it fly away.
Pixie O’Harris.
PUFF-TAIL PETER
pUFF-TAIL Peter
Lives in a burrow.
He nibbles the wheat
In the farmer’s furrow.
He pops up his head
Like a Jack-in-the-box,
And pops it down,
When he sees Bill Fox.
Leslie H. Allen.


RACING THE MOON-MAN
RUNNING, running down the street
As fast as I can go!
The pavement flies beneath my feet,
The moon is hanging low.
The Moon-Man runs along with me
Past chimney-tops and tiles;
He dodges now behind a tree,
Pops out again and smiles.
He has no legs, but he can run
With nothing but his face;
And when my panting breath is done
He winks and wins the race.
Leslie H. Allen.


MISS MINCHIN
MISS MINCHIN is a friend of ours; we
often go to tea,
She has a lot of interesting things we like to
see;
Of course there are no children there, and she
is rather old,
But there is heaps and heaps to do and nobody
to scold.
Miss Minchin has a garden that we’d like to
have ourselves,
But what she says are terraces are really little
shelves,
Little shelves of stone they are, where plants
and creepers grow,
Heliotrope and rosemary and lilies in a row.
And crooked rocky steps go down where you
can sit and talk —
There isn’t room for many games, nor very far
to walk,


But there are shady trees above and lots of
birds to sing
And locusts in the summer-time that drum like
anything!
Miss Minchin lets us pick the flowers and hunt
for snails that crawl
Beneath the ivy and the vines along the wet
stone wall;
And then there is a loquat-tree, but oh! it’s such
a waste —
We're never there in loquat-time—we’ve never
had a taste.
It’s just as nice on rainy days; we’re never dull
at all,
She shows us all the books and toys she had
when she was small;
And all her dolls she kept, she says, for children
of her own,
But now we play with them instead—the
queerest dolls we’ve known.
For moths have eaten off their hair, and they
look half afraid,
And wear such strange, old-fashioned clothes,
but beautifully made;
Miss Minchin tells us all their names and what
they used to do,
Or else she tells us stories then, both fairy tales
and true.


We always have hot buttered toast or tiny
scones for tea,
And sometimes pink and white meringues, as
sweet as sweet can be,
Then if we like —(we always do) —we sit down
on the floor
And all explore her cabinet when she’s unlocked
the door.
To look at curious things through glass she
knows is never fun,
She lets us take them in our hands —we’ve
never broken one;
And when at last it’s six o’clock —it comes so
soon! —I know
She’s just as sad to say good-bye as we are sad
to go.
Ruth M. Bedford.


MIRIL YIRIL YIRI
(The Blue or Fairy Wren)
JAUNTY little Bluecap
To our garden welcome!
Whither hast been roving?
From what secret dell come?
Miril Yiril Yiri,
All thy ways are winning;
Welcome, with thy brown mate
Modest Minning Minning!
If in early summer,
Through the wild we ramble,
We may spy the grass nest
Hidden in a bramble.
Miril Yiril Yiri,
When the brushwood’s thinning,
Seek ye then our hedges
Thou and Minning Minning.
Darting through the bushes,
O’er the greensward hopping;
Trailing low, sweet love-notes;
Scarcely ever stopping;


Miril Yiril Yiri,
What tales art thou spinning
All day to thy dainty
Mistress, Manning Minning?
Truly thou’rt a fairy
Bonnie azure-bonnet,
Elf or sprite of birdland;
Theme for song or sonnet!
Miril Yiril Yiri,
Here, no noises dinning,
Stay and rear a russet
Brood with Minning Minning.
But beware the cuckoo,
Kerguling the lazy,
Lurking round the thickets,
Driving small birds crazy I
Miril Yiril Yiri,
Don’t give her an inning
Or there’ll be an outing—
Mark that, Minning Minning.
Should she drop an egg in
Through your open doorway,
Bv and by your nestlings
Will be in a poor way.
Miril Yiril Yiri,
Right at the beginning
Chase the sly intruder,
Chase her, Minning Minning!


Dusky vanished people
In far inland places
Gave those names, soft-sounding
Suiting well your graces,
Miril Yiril Yiri,
Thou and Minning Minning
Gained their love, and our love
Thou art surely winning.
James Thomas.
RE WILLIAM WINKLETOPP
pOR boys who go to bed at eight
And girls who never stay up late
I have a storyette to tell
About the casting of a spell
On Master William Winkletopp.
Because he drank a single drop
Of clover-dew one starry night
A fairy banished him from sight.
Now when a fairy casts a spell
You may believe she does it well.
The boy Pm telling you about
Was never in the slightest doubt;
In vanishing she specialized,
And tho’ his parents advertized
And sought in every lolly-shop,
They found no William Winkletopp.


If boys go out when all is dark
And pixies tumble in the park,
They should be careful what they say,
And very careful how they play.
And never spill (’twixt me and you)
One little drop of clover-dew,
Nor drink one single crystal drop
Like foolish William Winkletopp.
If only he had gone to bed
Each night at eight o’clock, instead
Of sneaking out (the naughty lad!),
Not even asking, “May I, Dad?”
He might have been at home that night
Instead of being out of sight
And crying (so I understand)
For his mamma in Fairyland.
Tho’ fairies never are unkind,
When once a fay makes up her mind
To punish naughty girls and boys,
She doesn’t fuss and make a noise,
But touches them behind the ear,
And right away they disappear;
For fairies know that after dark
No children should be in the park.
Now Master William Winkletopp
Who drank the dewy crystal drop
When in his bed he should have been,
Was noticed by the Fairy Queen,


And she was very cross indeed.
So, mounted on her glossy steed,
Escorted by the royal train
She galloped there and back again.
And having thus expressed herself,
She beckoned to a dainty elf.
“Go, bring me hither, Winkletopp,
Who drank the dewy crystal drop
And place him on the magic green;
Away!” Thus spake the Fairy Queen.
Swift sped the elf; without a stop
She stood before Will Winkletopp
(Her wand uplifted) on a bud
And froze the stream of William’s blood.
“You drank the drop of crystal dew;
Her Majesty’s awaiting you."
Thus spake the elf in accents clear,
And tickled Will behind the ear.
Next moment he was on the green
And bowing to the Fairy Queen.
“Bold mortal,” she addressed him thus,
“You have been brought to dwell with us
In Fairyland, where naughty lads
Who do not heed their Mums and Dads,
And little girls who disobey
Are not allowed a moment’s play.
Until you profit and are wise
You are a bug—with beetle’s eyes."


And straightway William Winkletopp
Grew smaller . . . smaller . . . couldn’t stop
He found a tiny blade of grass
An obstacle too big to pass,
And, tripping o’er a fearsome crack,
Lay upside-down upon his back
Insulted by a monster slug
Who called him Willie Winklebug.
“Oh, dear! If I was home,” he said
“I'd really truly go to bed
At eight o’clock as good as gold,
And always do what I am told.”
The fairies must have overheard,
Because a saucy little bird
Caught William by his beetle’s toe,
And flew with him to Rotten Row.
Next morning when his mother came
To wake him up, with eyes aflame
He told her of his awful plight.
She thought he’d dreamed it in the night,
But he knew better, we surmise ;
A little bug with beetle’s eyes
May learn a lot, I understand
(And learn it quick) in Fairyland.
So, girls and boys, take my advice;
Although it may seem very nice
To be out playing after dark
And running up and down the park,


A thousand dangers lurk unseen;
And then . . . there is the Fairy Queen!
So, put such thoughts out of your head . .
There’s eight o'clock . . . now, off to bed!
James J. Stroud.
RIDING SONG
pLIPPITY-FLOP! Flippity-flop!
Here comes the butcher to bring us a chop,
Cantering, cantering down the wide street
On his little bay mare with the funny white
feet;
Cantering, cantering out to the farm,
Stripes on his apron and basket on arm.
Run to the window and tell him to stop —
Flippity-flop! Flippity-flop!
C. J. Dennis.


SHOPPING
gHOPS, shops, lots of shops,
Full of cakes and lollipops,
Kegs of ice-cream, cherries sweet,
Everything that’s nice to eat,
Rows and rows of mandarins,
Pineapples with prickly skins,
Cakes with icing, some without,
Fruity odours round about,
Slabs of chocolate, tins of jam,
Sausages and rosy ham.
All the shopmen stoop and say,
“How is Timothy to-day?
What would Madam like; some cheese
Cauliflower, beans, or peas.
Peaches, passion-fruit, or eggs,
Bags of sugar, rice, and pegs?”
Everything you just could think,
Pencils, writing-pads, and ink.
Short-loin chops for Father’s tea,
And marzipan for you and me.
Joan S. Mackaness.


SO COLD
HOW cold it is outside to-night, how cold
upon the stairs;
Poor little seals in homes of ice, poor little polar
bears.
Charles W. Hilson.
SPRING SONG
S ING out and be happy!
The Spring is at hand,
The grass green, and sappy
The trees o’ the land.
Sing! for the breeze is
Rustling and silky,
And toys with and teases
Long blossoms and milky.
Sing out! for the bees in
Their quest of wild honey
Are haunting the trees in
Green places and sunny.


Sing out! and let trouble
Another pursue:
It will burst like a bubble,
And vanish for you.
Rodekic Quinn.
SUNSET BAY
[ ITTLE wavelets, curly-wet, sipping at our
toes,
This is pretty Sunset Bay, as everybody knows.
White foot, brown foot, little fishes’ tails —
Oh, there’s lots of laughing water where the big
ship sails!
Little wavelets, curly-wet, do you go to school ?
Do you like the sands to shear all your pinky
wool ?
Red light, gold light, little nibbled moon —
All the world’s a cherry tart, and no one has a
spoon.
Little wavelets, curly-wet, turn and run away.
Thank you for a merry splash; come another
day.
Brown head, gold head, little fishes’ fins—
Oh, the sky is catching bed-time up on small
star pins!
David McKee Wright.


SUN-UP AND SUN-DOWN
JN a little pink cottage, three clouds from
Skytown,
Live two little pixies, Sun-up and Sun-down;
They wear little cocked caps and tiny blue
suits,
And have bells on their fingers and bells on
their boots.
Sun-up awakes in the dark morning hours,
And sprays all the trees, and bathes all the
flowers;
He shouts at the sun, till it pops up its head,
Then yawning and nodding he goes back to bed.
But Sun-down sleeps on till the day’s at its
close,
Then he tucks up each bird, and kisses each
rose;
He shines up the moon, and the stars —one by
one,
And puffing his cheeks, he blows out the sun.
Then hurrying off, with a shout and a leap,
He jumps into bed, and he, too, goes to sleep.
Now could you find pixies outside of Skytown,
As quaint as Sun-up or as cute as Sun-down?
Joyce Owen Starr.


SUSAN ANN
gUSAN ANN has short dark hair,
And a little turned-up nose,
But in her dreams, she’s divinely fair,
And her name is “Cordelia Rose.’’
Susan Ann gets up at seven,
And breakfasts on porridge and milk,
But in her dreams, she’s in bed at eleven,
In a room hung with velvet and silk.
Susan Ann wears sturdy shoes,
And little blue gingham frocks,
But in her dreams, she has gowns of all hues,
And gems for her golden locks.
In the marvellous fancies of Susan Ann,
There’s a footman and private maid,
Her shabby four-poster’s a cushioned divan,
And her brushes are turquoise and jade.
In Susan Ann’s dreams, she sits on a throne,
And is queen of a wonderful land,
And Prince Charming comes riding a marvel
lous roan,
To beg for her lily-white hand.


But not always is Susan away in the clouds,
Sometimes she wakes up with a start,
Most times are meal-times, and especially when,
For dessert there is gooseberry tart.
Joyce Owen Starr.
TEDDY BEAR
Bear
Sat on a chair,
With ham and jam
And plum and pear.
“This is queer,”
Said Teddy Bear,
“The more I eat
The less is there!”
Leslie H. Allen.


THE BILLYCART
THE windows of the Sydney shops
Are full of quite expensive toys;
Meccano sets, and trains, and tops,
And other birthday gifts for boys;
For bikes and trikes of varied size
A lot of money might be paid;
Yet more than these our youngsters prize
The billycart that Hector made.
The wheels, I fancy, once propelled
Some squalling infant in a pram;
The body (so it says) has held
Six dozen tins of apple jam.
From father’s workshop bits of wood
And sundry nuts and bolts have strayed;
If pots could speak, they might be rude
About the cart that Hector made.
Now, up and down our peaceful street
This car of juggernaut careers;
And sober citizens retreat
With heavy heart and sudden fears.


If pleasure can be gauged by noise
Or happiness by din portrayed,
Its cargo is a thousand joys,—
The billycart that Hector made.
Alex. Scott.
THE BLUE-NOSED BUTTER-MAN
QUR blue-nosed butter-man comes in with
butter on his tray;
He puffs, and tells our mother what a lovely
day to-day.
Then mother tells him it will rain and often
tells him twice;
He says it’s getting warm again, and then he
says the price.
He tells us what big boys he’s got and when
they get awake,
He tells us they’re as big as “that” and what
size boots they take.
His money’s in a marble-bag, with strings on,
and of course
We always ask the butter-man to say about
his horse.


THE BABIES’ BAY 5i
He asks us when we’re going to school; we tell
him we don’t know;
He wakes his horse up then, and says it’s time
for him to go.
And sitting in his waggon is a smooth, round
butter-wife;
She never leaves the waggon, just eats butter
all her life.
He’s got a wife, he’s got a whip, he’s got cream
in a can;
He never talks of butter, though, our blue-
nosed butter-man.
Furnley Maurice.
THE BABIES’ BAY
As i came down to the shore to-day
With a tripping toe for a pint of play,
I saw swing high
Where the white fish ply
A silver ship with a poop of gold;
With a captain bold and a bos’n old,
Who shouted, “Ho!
If you wish to go
To a laughing land with a winking way,
Come along with us to the Babies’ Bay.”


I dropped Age and I climbed on deck.
Oh the boards were bright as a starry speck.
And Jack and Jill
With their buckets still,
Came running down to collect my fare.
For a happy heart and a childish air
A smile forsooth
From the lips of Truth
Will procure you a bunk in the silver ship
At the sunset hour when she takes her trip.
Away we sailed on a sea of pearl
And the Bos’n Time made the billows swirl
With “Heave, heave ho!
For a jolly row
And safe return to the good ship Sleep
With her freight of dreams and Little 80-Peep,
Whose tiny fold
Is the golden hold.”
And the skipper Love sang a song of glee
As he steered us along through the Nursery
Sea.
And when we got to the Babies’ Bay
Where the stars spin mirth and the rainbows
play,
The girls and boys
With their rosy toys
Rang Nonsense bells till the moon ran out;
Till I heard a hush through the pearly rout:


A tinkling tap
Like a Fairy’s rap,
And wee Willie Winkie stilled the bliss
At the stroke of eight with a good-night kiss.
Zora Cross.
THE ENGINE
0 H I’m an engine-driver, and Billy is the
guard,
To make me start my engine he blows his
whistle hard.
The engine starts its noisy “a-puff, puff, puff,
—away,”
The big wheels round go spinning, and “Clanka
clank” they say.
And Billy, trainward swinging, waves high a
hand so black,
And then my little engine I race right down the
track.
Charles W. Hilson.


THE FAIRY MAN
JT was, it was a fairy man
Who came to town to-day;
“I’ll make a cake for sixpence
If you will pay, will pay.”
I paid him with a sixpence,
And with a penny too;
He made a cake of rainbows,
And baked it in the dew.
The stars he caught for raisins,
The sun for candied peel,
The moon he broke for spices
And ground it on a wheel.
He stirred the cake with sunbeams,
And mixed it faithfully
With all the happy wishings
That come to you and me.
He iced it with a moonbeam,
He patterned it with play,
And sprinkled it with star dust
From off the Milky Way.


He put it in a pearl shell —
O, white it was and new!
He took the cake of rainbows
And baked it in the dew.
Mary Gilmore.
THE FANTAIL
fTLIT-a-
Flirt-a-
Fantail —
Flutter down the creek;
Once his tail
Is open,
Can’t shut it for a week;
All he has
To sing about,
Just a little squeak;
All he has
For supper, just
A ’squito in his beak;
Flit-a-
Flirt-a-
Fantail —
Flutter down the creek.
The Perfesser and Alter Ego.


THE BRUMBIES
'Y'HE brumbies out on the mountain top
Said, “Let us gallop and never stop,
Gallop away, and gallop away,
From evening light till break of day,
And gallop still till daylight’s come,
Gallop away till the set of sun —
Over the mountains, over the plains,
Through the dry weather, and through
rains;
Gallop away, and never be caught,
Gallop away and never be bought —
We’ll gallop away through night and day,
Gallop away, and gallop away.”
Adele Hobson.


THE GARDEN HOSE
PLAYING with the garden hose
I love the squishy way it goes;
First of all, it hangs its head,
Flabby—just like something dead;
Then I turn the tap, and see!
It’s as lively as can be,
Spurting water fast and far
Where the thirsty blossoms are.
How it wriggles in my hands!
Don’t you think it understands
It must hurry up, and let
All the leaves get dripping wet,
All the drooping flower-heads
And the hot, dry garden-beds ?
It’s no end of fun to play
Like I did the other day;
I’m a brave and trusty knight,
Always ready for a fight,
And the hose is splendid then
As a serpent in his den;
But I rout him out, and he
Makes a fierce attack on me.


Very desp’rately we fought
All across the tennis court!
Oh, it was a dreadful slaughter!
Blood was flowing just like water;
But he never cared a rap
Till at last I reached the tap —
Turned it off, and with a moan
And a kind of gurgling groan,
Down he sank, completely slain,
And he never stirred again!
Ruth M. Bedford.
THE OWL AND THE MOREPORK
Boobook Owl was angry
As he sat up in the gloom,
While the old Morepork called softly
“Oom — Oom — Oom.”
The Boobook Owl said “Morepork!
Hark to his stupid boom!
He can’t say Morepork, or anything else
But Oom — Oom — Oom.
“These empty-headed humans
Will drive me to my tomb;
Imagine mixing me with him
And his Oom — Oom — Oom !


“It comes of his sitting about by day
Instead of keeping his room,
When I say Morepork, they think it is him!
Old Oom — Oom — Oom.”
The Morepork didn’t answer back,
For this is the Morepork’s doom —
He can’t say anything else besides
“Oom — Oom —Oom
The Perfesser and Alter Ego.
THE PIEMAN
J’D like to be a pieman, and ring a little bell,
Calling out, “Hot pies! Hot pies to sell!”
Apple-pies and Meat-pies, Cherry-pies as well,
Lots and lots and lots of pies—more than you
can tell.
Big, rich Pork-pies! Oh, the lovely smell!
But I wouldn’t be a pieman if ... .
I wasn’t very well.
Would you?
C. J. Dennis.


THE PORTER
J’D like to be a porter, and always on the run,
Calling out, “Stand aside!” and asking leave
of none,
Shoving trucks on people’s toes, and having
splendid fun;
Slamming all the carriage doors and locking
every one —
And, when they asked to be let in, I’d say,
“It can’t be done.”
But I wouldn’t be a porter if . . .
The luggage weighed a ton.
Would you?
C. J. Dennis.


THE RAINBOW
£)OWN in the garden the rainbow is spinning
Little loose bobbins of beryl and blue;
Creamy-white fairies their curls are unpinning,
Shaking pink pinafores woven of dew.
Hurry up, little girls! Hurry up, little boys!
And catch the big bow with its lapful of toys,
Where Puck and his Pixies are clinging and
flinging
Pale, pearly-white bells from their fingers and
toes —
Their round little toes' —
And when the breeze blows,
It’s only the children who hear the bells swing-
ing
High-ringing and singing,
As all the world knows.
Get out your bucket, and put on your bonnet.
Quick, or the little blue bobbins will go.
Dig up the gold, with the roses upon it,
Hiding in heaps at the end of the bow.
Hurry up, little girls! Hurry up, little boys!
You’ll miss the bow bending with junkets of
joys,


Where Mab and her maidens are tripping and
dipping
On tiny, green slippers, like slim little girls —
Like rosy-white girls—
All ribbons and curls,
That over the lavender beaches are skipping,
Are flipping and tipping,
All bubbles and pearls.
Zora Cross.
THE KOALA
H IGH in the fork of a blue-gum tree,
Where far through the bushland he can see,
Sits Booraby all day long;
Though half asleep in the noon is he,
He harks to the wild birds’ song.
Flung over the hills that his valleys gird,
The warning note of the soldier-bird
Comes sharp to his listening ear,
When Warrigal down in his lair has stirred
And Reynard is slinking near.
He sees the brolgas that march and dance,
And quaint furred creatures that hop and
prance
In the flowerful vales below,
A parrot flock in his roof, perchance,
And a fossicking old black crow.


He quakes anon at the thunder’s boom,
That sounds above like the crash of doom,
And blinks at the lightning’s flash;
And he tightens his grip as the brush and broom
Are tossed by the storm-wind’s lash.
But the sun succeeds, and the world looks fair;
Then he shakes the wet from his ears and hair,
And utters a loud deep cry
That wakes the sluggards in nest and lair,
And tells them the storm’s gone by,
E. S. Sorenson.
THE SLEEPIKINS
W/’HEN the sun has set and all the stars,
a-twinkling and a-peeping,
Spread like a blinking dust across the sky,
The Sleepikins from Dodoland come slyly, slyly
creeping,
Each crooning soft a tender lullaby.
For the Sleepikins tread softly ’neath the
beaming of the moon,
And gently, when the night is dark and
lonely,
And the little girls they sing to, all get sleepy
pretty soon,


As the music buzzes through each curly head.
They drop their dolls and teddy-bears, they
stop their tricks, and only —
They only, only want to go to bed . . .
By-by!
It is nightie-time, my dearie, time for bed!
The Sleepikins have fingers soft, delicious and
caressing,
With a honey-scented soothing in their tips;
On drooping, drooping eyelids they’re a-coax-
ing and a-pressing,
They’re a-toying with bewitching little lips.
Each Sleepikin comes creeping with a box of
magic dreams
Of things the most delightful and beguil-
ing .. .
There are troops of snowy angels, there are
woods and fields and streams,
There are sweets and cakes and cherries ripe
and red;
There are heaps and heaps of pleasant
things to keep wee girls a-smiling,
A-smiling all the time that they’re in
bed . . .
By-by!
It is nightie-time, my sweetheart, time for
bed!
Frank Morton.


THE SLEEP SEA
'pHE Sleep-Sea calls
To my mariner bold,
“Come hither to me,
The night is cold.
“Mine arms are wide
And my deeps are kind,
For never to me
Comes stormy wind.
“My rocks are dreams,
Where, a-drift, a-drift,
My cradle-ship
May fall and lift.
“My shoals are isles
Of slumbery sweets
Where never a wave
In anger beats.”
Do shut thine eyes
My mariner bold:
The Sleep-Sea calls,
The night is cold.
Mary Gilmore.


THE SPOON GAME
"\yHEN there are visitors to lunch
I mustn’t talk that day,
And so I make the spoons and forks
A kind of game to play.
Of course I play it in my head,
But still it’s rather fun;
It is a sort of story-game
That lasts till lunch is done.
The tablespoons are grannies—yes,
And sometimes nurses, too,
They all wear bonnets large and high
Like grannies used to do.
The mothers are dessertspoons then,
You see how that would be,
And all the teaspoons little girls
About as big as me.
The saltspoons all are baby things
And they must always stay
Inside their cellar-cradles, ’cos
They’re far too small to play.


The gravy-ladle drives about,
Much grander than the rest;
And all the forks are men, of course —
I like the ladies best.
But when the grannies all look stern
The mothers rather sweet,
I often think how rude it is
To use them when I eat.
Ruth M. Bedford.
THE BOOFOOLITES
QNE day the King of Boofoo Land
Thought he would go a-cruising:
Not in the dark, you’ll understand,
But long wax-candles using
To find his way along the bays
And up the mountains through the haze.
So he should not get lost o’ nights,
He took quite forty Boofoolites.
Each had two heads and twenty toes,
Each wore a Firefly in his nose.
To see them sliding on the floes
With all their Lanterns slung in rows
(To keep the whales off, I suppose)
Was really most amusing!


But that’s the fun of cruising
Along the bays and o’er the floes
Upon bright Boofoolandish nights,
With those deep-pinkish Boofoolites,
Who catch Red Herrings with their Toes —
It really is amusing!
Next noon the King of Boofoo Land
Lay down to play the Fiddle,
And all the Oysters on the strand
Went waltzing down the middle.
The Jelly Fish and Artichokes
Laughed loudly at the Lobster’s jokes.
While all the golden Boofoobees
Were singing to the Cabbages,
And spilling honey all day long
(Such waste I thought was very wrong)
The Dingbat toasting on a prong
A captivated Boofoobong,
Upraised his voice so calm and strong
To ask the moon a riddle.
The King still teased the Fiddle
To soothe the toasting Boofoobong,
And still the downy Boofoobees
Were whispering to the Cabbages,
While straight the heaving floes among
The moon let fall the Riddle,


THE CAREFUL GIRAFFE
But here’s the thing that puzzles Me, —
Whatever could that Riddle be!
So if you want to know the thing,
Stand on your heads and dance and cling
And catch the Bootit on the wing
With Dimples and a Piece of String;
Then give three Feathers to the King
And ask the Boofoolites to sing.
And then, as soon as prayers are said,
Tuck in your toes and go to bed.
Frank Morton.
THE CAREFUL GIRAFFE
“ M Y throat is sore,” said the Giraffe,
“My bedtime draught I cannot quaff
I cannot make a witty speech
That might bring on some laughter;
My doctor says I need a rest,
And country air will suit me best,
I’ve such a lot of throat, you see,
It takes some looking after.
“He says I must not work at night
And meals must all be very light,
With one raw carrot every day,
Or I’ll be much the sadder;


To grasp high things I must not try,
’Twould be an awful thing if I
Should lose my present power of reach,
And have to use a ladder.”
He went inside to make a note
Of things to carry for his throat,
And took a suit-case from the shelf,
And packed them all together,
Some ointment of uncommon strength
A blister quite a yard in length,
And then a piece of drainpipe for
Protection in cold weather.
Nellie A. Evans.
THE CIRCUS
H EY, there! Hoop-la! The circus is in
town!
Have you seen the elephant? Have you seen
the clown?
Have you seen the dappled horse gallop round
the ring?
Have you seen the acrobats on the dizzy swing?
Have you seen the tumbling men tumble up
and down?
Hoop-la! Hoop-la! the circus is in town!


Hey, there! Hoop-la! Here’s the circus
troupe!
Here’s the educated dog jumping through the
hoop.
See the lady Blondin with the parasol and fan,
The lad upon the ladder and the india-rubber
man.
See the joyful juggler and the boy who loops
the loop.
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Here’s the circus
troupe!

THE TASSEL-PEOPLE
HEN I was ill for weeks in bed
And mother had to rest,
The game I often used to play,
The one I liked the best,
Was making stories in my mind
About the tassels on the blind.
Round little heads those tassels had
And most of them were fat,
Like people walking in a row,
Some this way and some that,
With fluffy dresses sticking out,
Where the wind caught their skirts, no doubt


And one or two would stop and talk
While others walked so fast
They hadn't time for gossiping,
And some would saunter past—
All stiff and trim and prim they went,
And some were old and hunched and bent
Then Nurse would come and light the gas
And pull the blind down low;
I couldn’t see what happened then
The whole way down the row,
But in the morning I would find
New tassel-people on the blind.
Ruth M. Bedford.
THE TEA PARTY
Miss Muffit and Little Boy Blue,
Pubsky and Fiddle-de-Dee,
Went on a day when the Cow Bird flew
Up to the Moon to tea.
Story seems almost too good to be true,
But it was told to me
By Little Miss Muffit and Little Boy Blue,
Pubsky and Fiddle-de-Dee,
Little Red Riding Hood, Inky-Poo,
Humpty-Dumpty (a crackpate he,
Cousin of Boobies and Mad Gloo-Gloo), —
All of them went to tea.


The Man in the Moon spread a cloth that night
That dazzled the folk below,
It was big as a mountain, and white, so white
That it worried the white, white snow;
And they sat down at tea-time by candle-light
(You would have liked that, I know),
While the Moonies all chuckled to see the sight
And startled demure Peep-80,
And dimpled Peep-Bo fell right off in her fright
And landed in O-H-I-O.
(This story, remember, is awfully true;
For I had it first hand, you see,
From little Mass Muffit and Little Boy Blue,
Pubsky and Fiddle-de-Dee,
Little Red Riding Hood, Inky-Poo—
A very bad pixie unknown to you;
He says it put him in no end of a stoo —
They all came last night and confided to me
How they went to the Moon and had cakes and
tea —
And crayfish and grapes, you know,
And how all the Moon-men laughed out at the
sight —
They couldn’t help that, but it wasn't polite—
So that dimpled Peep-Bo fell right off in her
fright,
Which certainly suited Ohio all right
But was dreadfully hard on Peep-Bo!


And all were so busy with cup and with spoon
That they used all the tea that they had in the
Moon.
This proves that the story is true:
As I heard it, I tell it to you.
The story’s as true as a story can be:
They went to the Moon, and they drank all
the tea
But if \ou should doubt it, just look up and
see.
\ ou 11 see not a scrap of tea left in the moon.
There are mountains, a Man, and (I dare say)
a spoon!
Frank Morton


THE TRAIN
rjOWN goes the signal: all aboard the puff-
puff! t Ull
Janga-langa-janga-langa-lang goes the bell,
and
People come a-hurrying, and bang go the doors,
and
Click! go the keys as they lock ’em up well,
and
Feee! goes the whistle, and waggle goes the
flag, and
Ooo! says the engine, choo-choo-chof,
Choo - rumble - rumble - rumble - choo - rumble -
rumble-rumble,
Rattle-bump-rumble as the train moves off.
Ann O’Nym.


THE TRAVELLER
AS I r °de in to Burrumbeet,
I met a man with funny feet;
And, when I paused to ask him why
His feet were strange, he rolled his eye
And said the rain would spoil the wheat;
So I rode on to Burrumbeet.
As I rode in to Beetaloo
t met a man whose nose was blue;
And, when I asked him how he got
A nose like that, he answered, “What
Do bullocks mean when they say ‘Moo’ ?”
So I rode on to Beetaloo.
As I rode in to Ballarat,
I met a man who wore no hat;
And, when I said he might take cold
He cried, “The hills are quite as old
As yonder plains, but not so flat,”
So I rode on to Ballarat.
As I rode in to Gundagai,
I met a man and passed him by


Without a nod, without a word.
He turned, and said he’d never heard
Or seen a man so wise as I.
But I rode on to Gundagai.
As I rode homeward, full of doubt,
I met a stranger, riding out:
A foolish man he seemed to me;
But, “Nay, I am yourself,” said he,
“Just as you were when you rode out.
So I rode homeward, free of doubt.
C. J. Dennis.
THE WALLABY AND THE BULL-ANT
Wallaby sat on an ironbark stump,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy —
Wondering how far he was able to jump.
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy.
The Bull-ant sat on the Wallaby’s tail,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy —
And the Wallaby started off full sail,
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy.
The Bull-ant’s face wore a satisfied smile,
Budgeree, Budgeree , Bingy —
For the Wallaby found he could jump a mile
Budgeree, Budgeree, Bingy.

THE WATTLE IS A LADY
'"y'HE wattle is a lady, in her yellow satin
gown,
The Gum-Tree is a gentleman, with suit of
green and brown,
The Hakea is a cross-patch, and he’ll scratch
you if he can,
The Cabbage Tree’s a vain coquette, with every
leaf a fan.
The Christmas Bells are tell-tales, for they
whisper in the breeze,
Tecoma’s very lazy, for she sprawls and takes
her ease,
Lambertia is a soldier, in his straight spiked
coat of red,
Grevillea is an acrobat, see how his arms are
spread.
A pale bride is Clematis, with her wreath so
waxy white,
Hibbertia is a little girl, with face so round and
bright,


Wild Violet is a baby shy, the sweetest ever
seen
And Waratah with crown of red is a tall and
stately queen.
Amy Eleanor Mack.
TOMTIT
' HAVE a little gardener
Who works for me all day;
He never grumbles, never lags,
And never asks for pay.
He’s always up and busy
At the hedges or the lawn,
He works away till sundown
Though he started at the dawn
He doesn’t go to fetch his coat
’Round four o’clock or so,
But “Twit-a-twit,” says Thomas Tit,
“These grubs have got to go.”
And let it shine or let it rain,
He’s merry as a grig,
For “Twit-a-twit,” cheeps Thomas Tit
“There’s aphis on this twig.”
And since he works so cheerily
And since I love him so,
I hope no horrid catapult
Will lay my gardener low.
Ella McFadyen.


TWILIGHT
j\T twilight when the crickets chant
And bats begin to dart and skim
And half the sky is pale and clear
And all the earth is trembling-dim,
I love to walk alone —don’t you?—
In case things might be coming true
I run down to the garden’s end :
The earth smells damp and very sweet
Nurse doesn’t like my going, ’cause
She says I always wet my feet.
The crickets stop at once; and when
I m past they all begin again.
Between the twisty passion-vine
And our big jacaranda tree
There is a little curly seat
Just wide enough to cuddle me.
I know it by the morning light,
They never let me stay at night.


It is a very magic place.
If I could stop there I suppose
I’d see through all those scented leaves
The story-people coming close.
I’ve sometimes felt things just begin
But then Nurse always calls me in
Dorothea Mackellar.
TWO SONGS
Clip-Clop !
clip-clop!
The tap in the paddock
went “drip-drop;”
The horse put his lip
L T nder the drip —
Shoo\
Clippety cloppety, clip-clop!
J. Le Gay Brereton.
The Locust
M —mm —mm —mm —
Don’t you hear the locust
in the tree-ee-ee,
Singing a song
Drowsy and long,
Droning a lullaby to me-ee-ee.
J. Le Gay Brereton.


WALKING TO SCHOOL
NOW I am five, my father says
(And what he says you’ve got to mind)
That mother’s not to hold my hand,
Or even follow me behind
To see I’m safe. But down the road,
And all the way up the next street,
I am to walk now quite alone,
No matter what the things I meet.
Though horrid horses rear and plunge,
And cows come trampling, big and bold,
And fighting boys are strutting out,
I shall have no one’s hand to hold.
Still, five is really very old;
It’s pretty close to being a man
Since I a soldier wish to be,
I s’pose it’s time that I began.
I’ll swell my chest right out, like this,
And swing my books behind, just so,
And wear my hat stuck side-ways on,
And whistle all the way I go. *


There is a little boy I pass,
He’s always swinging on the gate,
He’ll think that I am very old —
Perhaps he’ll think I’m seven, or eight.
There is a little girl I see,
She’s always standing at her door.
When I come whistling boldly past,
She’ll wish that she were more than four
What I mind most of all are dogs;
My sister says dogs seldom bite,
But how can I be sure of this?
Your sisters are not always right.
There is an awful dog I hear;
It barks and barks as I go by,
I know some day it will get loose,
And fiercely at my throat will fly.
And other dogs come round and sniff
(I’ve sandals, and my legs are bare);
Perhaps it’s true they will not bite,
Perhaps some day I shall not care.
When you were five and walked to school
And you met things to tremble at,
Were you as brave as great big men,
Or did your heart go pit-a-pat?
Ethel Turner.


WANTED
jobs are few and far between,
There’s not the slightest doubt.
The thing to do, it’s easy seen,
Is wander further out.
If I could get a spotted pup,
No longer would I bide;
I'd go in search of penning-up
Along the Lachlan side.
There’s dogs about of every breed,
And any size and kind;
But just the sort of tyke I need
Is mighty hard to find.
A novice any hound will sool
On sheep when penning-up;
We experts, as a general rule,
Prefer a spotted pup.
No matter if the spots are large,
Or only here and there,
I’ll gladly pay whatever charge
The owner reckons fair.


If I can buy a little dog,
One with a spotted hide,
To look for penning-up, I’ll jog
Along the Lachlan side.
Ellenvale.
WATCHING THINGS PASS
(~JREEN maiden hair
By the round little pool,
Quivery, shivery,
Quivery cool.
Soft mossy earth
With the leaves swinging low,
Fluffily, fleecily,
Baby clouds blow.
Who is that there
Lying still in the grass?
Jonathan Timothy
Watching things pass.
Joan S. Mackaness.


WHEN I WAS SIX
AACHEN I was only six years old,
Heigh-ho! for Folly O!
I wandered in a fairy fold,
Heigh holly! to and fro.
I rode upon a blossom’s back
Up hill and over sea;
And all the little pixie pack
For fun would follow me.
O, golden was the gown I wore
Of buttercups and air,
And twenty diamond stars or more
Were pinned upon my hair.
All day I chased the laughing sky
Above the busy town,
But when the moon unwinked her eye,
Ho, ho! I hurried down.
And then within the baby’s shoe
I hid my lady’s pearls.
From maid to merry maid I flew
And knotted all their curls.


I pulled the preacher's saintly gown,
And lost his open page.
I tickled out the withered frown
Of every sallow sage.
And when the children were abed,
I tapped the window-pane,
And laughed as someone softly said
“Whist! goblins there again!”
Ho, ho! I flitted here and there
Amid my elfin band,
While on the green, in frolic fair,
We tripped it hand in hand.
As air and moonlight I was free
Within that fairy fold,
For all the world belonged to me
When I was six years old.
