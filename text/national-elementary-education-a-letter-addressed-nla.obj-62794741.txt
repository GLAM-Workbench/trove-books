A LETTER.
My Brethren,
You may, perhaps, ask why a
member of the military profession, and a person
altogether unknown to the mass of society in Eng-
land, should come forward at this particular moment
to address you on such a subject as that of ?National
Elementary Education My answer to this question
will he, that I have been striving for nearly twenty
years, in Australia and India, to promote education;
and having, during this period, arrived at some
definite convictions on this subject, I wish to bring
these before you; as anything bearing upon a question
which is now attracting the attention of the people
and the Government in England may be useful, as
suggestive of modes of dealing with a subject of such
acknowledged importance, in a manner less likely to
create angry feelings than that which has, I am sorry
to say, been for some years past stirring up party
spirit and strife in the Church.
A brief sketch of the positions in which I have
been placed, and of the difficulties I encountered in
dealing with the question of education, will be the
best introduction to the account of the convictions
which the work and thought of the last twenty-two
years have impressed upon me.
In 1846 I was sent as Lieutenant-Governor to Yan
Diemen?s Land, then the depository of a large portion
of the criminals of the mother country. The work-
ing population of the colony was composed in great
measure of criminals, many of whom might have
? b 2


traced their crime, and the expatriation which was
its punishment, to the selfish neglect which had kept
them in ignorance when young; hut very many of
whom were in no respect to be classed as ignorant in
the ordinary sense of the term; on the contrary, they
were intelligent, well read, quick of apprehension?
to use an American phrase, they were very smart men;
they were, however, all classed under one general
category as ?poor ignorant people,? and this assumed
ignorance was supposed to he the principal cause of
the crime which had brought them within reach of
the law. Such being the case, knowledge was of
course the proper remedy to apply; and in my anxiety
to bring about a better state of things, I adopted the
current dogma of the day, that it was the duty of a
paternal Government to look after the education of its
children. I pressed upon the Legislature measures
based upon this aphorism; I tried to induce it to
make education, to a certain extent, compulsory, by
the imposition of a personal rate, or poll-tax, to meet
the expense of establishing and maintaining schools,
&c. I could, however, only obtain a general admission
of the excellence of education, with a scanty provision
out of the general revenue?very much like that which
has been squeezed out of the Government in England
during the last few years?the object being, in both
cases, to make the greatest display of anxiety to
promote education at the least possible cost.
From Yan Diemen?s Land I went to Sydney, as
Governor of New South Wales. There the convict
system had been put an end to for several years; most
of the original convicts had disappeared; and the
labour market was supplied by the importation of free
emigrants; but though these men came to the colony
without the stamp of crime upon them, their training
at home had not been of such a character as to pro-
duce any very marked change in the moral condi-
tion of the people: the grosser crimes were less


frequent, but the general tone of morality was not, of
course, higher than that of the class in England to
which the emigrant belonged. There was in New
South Wales, as there has been in England of late
years, a sort of intellectual fever, a craving for know-
ledge, not so much for the pleasure of acquiring,
nor for that derived from the consciousness of pos-
sessing intellectual wealth, as for the purpose of
using it to aid in the accumulation of material wealth.
An university was established at Sydney; encourage-
ment was given to many of the better class of schools;
but in the pastoral districts, and generally in those
which were scantily peopled, schools could not be
established, and the children of the small farmers,
being left to themselves, became, in many instances,
as lawless and violent, as much worshippers of self,
as the convicts.
While I was in New South Wales I was directed by
the Secretary of State to transfer to Norfolk Island
the members of the small community ?I might almost
say congregation?of Pitcairn Islanders, the descend-
ants of the mutineers of the Bounty. I did so ; and
I visited the island in 1857, and again in 1859. I
found the people ignorant, of course ; I may say very
ignorant, using the word in its ordinary sense; but
they lived together as brethren; they knew their duty
to God, and their duty to their neighbour; and, what
is more, they carried this knowledge into practice to
the best of their ability.
In 1861 I went to India. I found myself at
Madras governor of a country containing about
24,000,000 inhabitants, with but a scanty sprinkling
of Europeans to guide and direct them. There were
Mahometans worshippers, in name, of one God;
Hindoos of various castes and denominations?wor-
shippers of hundreds *of gods ; but all, whether
Mahometans or Hindoos, worshippers of self in every
brutal form in which such idolatry can develop itself.


Here, the effect of school-teaching (religion being
kept altogether in the background) was but increased
knavery; the knowledge given was just enough to
induce the people to throw off the checks (trifling as
they were) which their own religion imposed upon
them; while it was not such, either in quantity or
quality, as to give them any moral principles for their
guidance.
In Australia, in the South Seas, and in India, I
found many earnest and zealous men devoting them-
selves, as Missionaries, to spread the light of the
Gospel among the heathen; in some places their
labours yielded a promising return, in others this
was merely nominal. The great stumbling-block in
the way of the Missionaries was the conduct of pro-
fessed members of the Church of Christ. The saying
of St. Paul to the Jews, ? The name of God is
blasphemed among the Gentiles through you/? may
be reiterated by all those who preach the word of
God among the heathen. The name of God is
blasphemed among these through us, who, while
calling ourselves Christians, deny by our conduct our
belief in Him whom we profess to worship and obey.
It is, I say, blasphemed through us, Englishmen, a
large proportion of whom are professedly Christians,
whose Government is professedly Christian, and
who are, both people and Government, I believe,
desirous that Christianity should spread its influence
far and wide.
How is this ? may well be asked ; and I think a
reply may be found in the state of England itself.
I landed in England in 1866, after an absence of
nearly twenty years. My first impressions were
delightful; the contrast between the green fields of
England and the burnt-up plains of India, or the
sandy desert of Egypt, was most cheering to the
eyes, and there was evidence of order, method, and
a purpose, in everything, which is wanted in conn-


tries inhabited by people of Asiatic descent. In a
short time, however, the changes which had taken
place during the twenty years of my absence
forced themselves upon my notice ; and while there
was much to admire; much exhibition of mental
energy, especially in matters bearing upon the mate-
rial prosperity of the country; while there was
evidence of wealth far beyond anything which I
could have anticipated, there was much which was
unsatisfactory, much which was painful. The
population had increased to the extent of about
5,000,000 in these twenty years, but the whole of
this increase had found domiciles in the towns: in
these the people were packed together in small
tenements ; little provision had been made for their
material comforts?none, or next to none, for their
training, either secular or religious. While wealth
had increased, and while the numbers of the com-
paratively rich had multiplied, so had the poor, in
as great, or a greater ratio; and it seemed to me
that a more marked line of. separation was drawn,
than heretofore, between the two ?the rich had
become richer, and the poor relatively poorer and
more dependent. The action of the railways, and
other causes, on the habits of society seemed to have
lessened the sympathy between the possessors of pro-
perty and those immediately dependent upon them;
while the efforts made to educate (as it is termed)
the poor, had, by giving them a smattering of
knowledge, enabled them to appreciate the dis-
comforts of their position, and had created a sort of
craving for enjoyments which the possession of
increased means alone could enable them to procure.
They appeared to be dissatisfied with their position,
with themselves, and with those whom God had
placed over them. In the state of England we may
see the cause of the difficulties which the Missionary
encounters. If the Englishman at home is restless,


discontented, always crying out for change?seeking
from the Legislature a remedy for that which is
the product of the evil of his own heart?always
clamouring for the reform of the political institu-
tions of the country, as if these were answerable for
the evils of which he complains; but never dreaming
of looking within, to the evil of his own nature, as
that most requiring reform ; how can we expect the
Englishman abroad to hold out a good example to
the heathen among whom he is thrown ?
This is a brief sketch of the last twenty-two years
of my life, and work and thought have produced
in me a conviction that it is not Ignorance, in the
ordinary sense of the word, which is the parent
of sin and of crime, but ignorance of that which
ought to form the basis of our education ?of our dutij
towards God and our duty towards our neighbour.
This conviction dawned upon me when I began to
watch the development of thought in my children; it
grew and strengthened when I scrutinised the work-
ing of education (so-called) upon the conduct of
others; but it became fixed and positive when I looked
carefully into my own conduct, and traced in my
actions the result of the evil of my heart. We, the
(so-called) educated class, know much; with many,
the habit of thought, the tastes developed by study,
operate beneficially; they keep us from the grosser
kinds of vice ; but we too often become worshippers
of self, and are either ignorant of, or careless in the
fulfilment of, the two great duties of life?our duty
to God and our duty to our neighbour. Every day
serves to strengthen and confirm this conviction.
The evil effects of this ignorance of our main duties,
of our idolatry of self, show themselves in every
phase of life?in the conduct of the people, in the
action of the Legislature, in all our social relations;
it is an elementary evil, one which lies at the root
of our nature, partly as men, specially as English-


men?and the only effectual remedy is that which
can he applied but at the commencement of our
career in this world, namely, ? National Elementary
Education.?
I am afraid, however, that my definition of this
phrase will not harmonise with that in common use ;
it is better, therefore, that I should explain clearly
the meaning which I attach to this combination of
words.
Education. ?This, according to my idea, is the pro-
cess by which the powers of the mind, the passions,
affections, &c., are drawn forth, moulded into form,
and have a specific direction given to them. It
embraces in its meaning the whole process by which
man is trained, and made fit to perform the duties
of his position. Instruction, tuition, or any other
synonym by which we define the process of fur-
nishing material for the mind to act upon, is, in
point of fact, but a branch or portion of Education.
The mind, when properly educated, arranges, com-
bines and brings these materials into such a state
of assimilation as may enable it to derive nourish-
ment and strength from them ; but when improperly
educated, or left to the operation of its own untrained
and unassisted power, it is more likely to turn these
elements into poison than into nutriment.
The process of education is continuous: it does
not, as is too commonly supposed, terminate when
a boy or a man leaves school or college, when he
enters upon the business of life; but is modified by
that very work: I use, therefore, the term, ?ele-
mentary,? as explanatory of the fact that in youth
nothing but a foundation can be laid. It is needless
to say that this should be sound, for it is the basis
upon which the superstructure of life, both here and
hereafter, has to be raised.
The term ? national,? I have added to bring my-
self into harmony with the language, I might almost


term it the ? slang,? of the day. All I mean to imply
by it is, that each individual of the nation should
he properly educated; but I by no means intend
to infer that it is the business of the Government to
educate the people.
Education, then, is a necessity. If a man he not
properly trained, the devil takes him in hand, and
turns all that is supplied to him from without into
poison. Were men such as they should he; were
parents wise, in the scriptural sense of the word;
the education of children would be a simple matter,
for every one would allow that it would he best left
in the hands of those whose love for their children
is untinged with any selfish feeling. Men, however,
are not such as they ought to be; neither are all
parents wise; many are ignorant of their duties,
and the time which might and ought to be spent in
training their children is wasted in self-indulgence.
Many are poor, and their whole time is given to the
labour required to enable them to procure the
necessaries of life for their families. There are
some who ignore altogether the claims which their
children have upon them, who throw them delibe-
rately upon the charity of society. There are too
many who, while expiating the offences committed
against the law, are compelled to place their chil-
dren in charge of others. To whom, then, is the
great charge of training up these poor waifs and
strays to be entrusted ?
The answer to this question, if put to the people
whose children are to be cared for, would, in nine
cases out of ten, be, that the trust should devolve
upon those wdio might be supposed to have some
sympathy with their children; and, failing relations,
upon those who are, in the highest sense of the
term, brethren, the members of the Church or con-
gregation to which they belonged. To this, that is,
to the Church, if we accept the teaching of the


Apostles, me duty of educating the young, or, more
generally, the ignorant, most indubitably apper-
tains. When, however, I affirm this, I must take
care that the meaning which I attach to the term
? Church ? is clearly understood. St. Paul brings
before his readers, in various analogies, his idea of
the Church of Christ; it is described by him as a
spiritual Temple, in which each individual stone
hears its portion of the weight of the building ; it is
likened to the human body, in which each limb or
member, however humble or minute, has some special
and necessary function. I accept these analogies in
their broadest meaning: I believe that the duties of
the Church are distributed among all its members;
that while the clergy, the ministers of the Church,
have their own special duties to perform, we, the lay
members, are not entitled to remain idle, or to throw,
as is too often done, the whole work of the collective
body upon the clergy. A Church is, or should be,
a family, a brotherhood, so far as the affection of
the members for each other is indicated by such a
term. It is a society, a municipality, so far as it is
necessary that the members should combine their
efforts in order to carry out much which individuals
cannot properly perform. I use the term ? muni-
cipality? for the express purpose of pointing out that
our duties, as members of a Church, include many
which we have been in the habit of considering as
purely secular, and as affording many points of
analogy, in the mode in which municipal duties are
performed, to that in which a Church must neces-
sarily act in carrying out its appointed work, its
labour of love. While the family tie would induce
every member to take a lively interest in the fate of
the widow and the orphan, in the education of
children, in the support of the sick, the aged, and
the needy; reason and example would indicate the
necessity of municipal, or joint action, instead of


individual effort, for the purpose of securing the
maximum benefit from the means at the disposal of
the body.
It is to the failure of the Church to provide the
means of educating its people; to the tendency of
the laity to throw both the labour and cost of main-
taining the schools upon the clergy, that we owe
the appeals which have been made of late years to
the State for pecuniary aid. It has been asked by
the Church to provide a proportion of the cost of the
schools, and it, naturally enough, has taken upon
itself to dictate the conditions upon which such aid
is to he granted. So long as any Church provides
from its own means for the support of its schools,
&c., it is master of the situation, and may dictate
the terms upon which it will admit children to be
educated at its schools; but as soon as it appeals
to the Government for help the state of things is
reversed. The Government, being the represen-
tative of the whole nation, claims that all the
children within given territorial limits should he
admitted to a school to which it has given aid.
From this spring religious jealousies, or rather
jealousies which are, most erroneously, considered
to be based upon religious principles. Fears are
expressed that the master should inculcate his own
religious principles, and from thence springs the
startling demand that the children in these ?Na-
tional Schools? should receive no religious instruction,
that the so-called Education should be wholly secular;
that religious principles should not be enforced as
motives to regulate the conduct ; that morality
should be inculcated, not as based upon Christianity,
but upon the general principle of expediency and
convenience, of which we have seen such bitter
fruits in St. Paul?s description of the heathen world,
and of which we have living evidence in America,
where this system of education has been carried out.


The Rev. Dr. Edson, of Lowell, Massachusetts,
says, after entering into a variety of details as to the
working of the American system : ?It consists with
my observations here, during many years past, that
the great majority of those now growing up cannot
he said to hold more than belongs to mere natural
religion : I look upon this prevalent condition of
mind with very great apprehension, for all history
shows that this is only the first downward step to
complete irreligion and infidelity, and thence to a
corruption of morals such as was exhibited in the
heathen world. I much fear that we are making
sure and not very slow strides in that direction; and
while I bitterly lament it, I am free to confess that
I see no present remedy for it in this country.?
It is true that the remedy would be difficult to
apply in America; the evil has been long preva-
lent, it has produced such an effect upon the
habits of the people, that the thorough change re-
quired can hardly be hoped for. For us, however,
who have not as yet plunged into this slough, but
have merely wetted our feet at the brink, it would be
simple enough, could we but make up our minds to
the effort. We, that is, the members of each particular
congregation, have but to assert our right to act as
we think best for our children; have only to repu-
diate any aid from the State; have only to show our
capacity to provide the means which may be required
to train up our children in the way they should go,
and we are at perfect liberty to carry out our views
in practice.
I may be asked, How is this to be done ? how can
we find the amount of money which will be required
in order to secure to our children a sound religious
and practical training ?
My reply must consist, first, of a reference to
statistics, to show what the extent of the means at
our disposal amounts to; and, next, to the Bible,* to


show what proportion of these means we ought to set
apart for the service of God; and I think that I shall
be able to show that we have not only sufficient to
educate the people thoroughly, but also for all those
purposes which God intended should be provided for
out of His share of our means ; namely, the support
of the clergy; the maintenance of the aged, the infirm,
and the sick, as well as of the poor and needy.
Some twenty-two years ago, on looking into
questions hearing upon the relation of income to
expenditure in England, I arrived at the conclusion
that the annual increase of capital?that is, the
annual excess of income over expenditure?amounted
to �20,000,000 sterling. lam told that the annual
increase of capital is now nearly �100,000,000, and
that the income of the country may be estimated
at �800,000,000. Assuming, however, that the income
does not exceed �600,000,000, what proportion of this
ought we to set apart for the service of God ?
From the beginning of the History of Man, whether
we refer to the Bible or to heathen authors, we find
that it was usual for men to set apart a tenth or tithe
of their income for the service of God in various
ways. I use the term income in its widest sense, as
applicable to all the property of which a man might
come into possession: a tenth of the spoil taken in
battle (or of capital) was dedicated to God, as well as
a tenth of the annual produce of the soil, or of the
annual increase of the flocks and herds. We find, in
the Bible, that this practice was antecedent to the
Law by which Moses defined the various modes in
which this tithe was to be applied, and by which he
added to the original tenth a second tithe to cover
the expense of ceremonial observances and for cha-
ritable purposes. We are in the habit of saying that
the new Covenant under which we live has abrogated
the Law, and we avail ourselves of this plea to get
rid, not only of the obligations imposed by the Law,


but of those which were antecedent to it. Have we,
in using such a plea, rightly interpreted the declara-
tions of our Saviour and his Apostles ? I do not
believe that we are in any way justified in asserting
that the obligation to pay an honest tithe of our income
has been done away; Ido not believe that the great
rule of love laid down by our Saviour was intended
to lessen the amount which the Law so positively
asserts to be due to God; on the contrary, the
intention was to enhance the amount.
Assuming, then, that one tenth of our income
belongs to God, the annual amount at the disposal
of the different Churches for His service would be at
least �60,000,000.* What proportion of this would
be required for Elementary Education ?
The population of the country may be taken at
about 25,000,000; if we assume that one sixth
of these, or 4,200,000, are, or ought to be, at school,
the number of schoolmasters, at the rate of one for
every fifty children, would be 84,000; and if each
of these were to receive �lOO per annum, on an
average, the total amount expended would be
<�8,400,000 per annum; or, allowing for con-
tingencies, �10,000,000. This would leave a balance
of �50,000,000, available for the other purposes
alluded to before, namely, the maintenance of the
clergy, and the support of the aged, the infirm, the
sick, and the helpless, as well as the poor and needy.
If one clergyman, with a salary of �3OO per an-
num, were placed in charge of every 100 families, or
every 500 of the population, the annual charge
* The simple tenth is here taken, but, practically, God?s share
would amount to very much more than this; for instance, A has
an income of �l,OOO per annum, of this he devotes �lOO to the
service of God; of the remainder, a large portion goes to make up
the income of those with whom he deals, they in their turn paying
their tithe to God; so that one seventh would probably be nearer
the mark than one tenth.


would be <�15,000,000. The present poor-rate is about
<�10,000,000; when administered by the Church,
as part of the sum set apart for the service of God,
the amount would probably be doubled, as it would
be administered in a loving, instead of a niggardly,
spirit. The whole charge for education, for the
maintenance of the clergy, for the support of the
aged, the sick, and the poor, would amount to
.�45,000,000; and there would still be a surplus of
.�15,000,000 to be employed in missionary labour, or
in any work which would conduce to the Glory of
God and the good of our fellow creatures.
I would earnestly intreat you, my brethren, to con-
sider whether we have not been dealing dishonestly
with God for very many years past; whether, in
imposing a tithe upon real property only, we have
not been acting unfairly by our neighbour, as well
as defrauding God. I would press upon you the
wisdom of God?s law, which set apart a fixed pro-
portion of our income to be expended in His service,
as removing from us the temptation to deal in a
niggardly manner with our brethren.
We are too much in the habit of looking to
Parliament to relieve us from difficulties which our
own conduct has entailed upon us; but in the pre-
sent case no legislation is required; it rests with
each individual to relieve himself from the im-
putation of dealing dishonestly with God, and it
rests with the members of each Church, or con-
gregation, to make such an appropriation of God?s
revenue as may conduce most to His glory and to the
good of their brethren. That He may guide our
hearts to will and do that which is right in His sight
is my earnest prayer.
