Hymn
No. 400.
Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth.’'
Into Thy hand I commit my spirit;
There the penitents who turn
To the cross their dying eyes,
All the love of Jesus learn
At His feet in Paradise :
Father, in Thy gracious keeping _
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
Now the labourers task is o’er ;
Now the battle-day is past;
Now upon the farther shore
Lands the voyager at last: _
Father, in Thy gracious
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There no more the powers of hell
Can prevail to mar their peace ;
Christ the Lord shall guard them well,
He who died for their release :
Father, in Thy gracious keeping _
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the tears of earth are dried ;
There its hidden things are clear ;
There the work of life is tried
By a juster Judge than here :‘ !
Father, in Thy gracious keeping _
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
“ Earth to earth, and dust to dust,”
Calmly now the words we say ;
Leaving him to sleep in trust
Till the resurrection day:
Father, in Thy gracious keeping _
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
There the Shepherd, bringing home
Many a lamb forlorn and strayed,
Shelters each, no more to roam,
Where the wolf can ne’er invade :
Father, in Thy gracious keeping
Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.
