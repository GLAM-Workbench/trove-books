PREFACE
With this lamentable example before me, I trust that in the
following sketches I have abstained from any positive moral.
I might have painted my villains of the blackest dye, —so
black, indeed, that the originals thereof would have contem-
plated them with the glow of comparative virtue. I might
have made it impossible for them to perform a virtuous or
A SERIES of designs—suggested, I think, by Hogarth’s familiar
cartoons of the Industrious and Idle Apprentices—l remember as
among the earliest efforts at moral teaching in California. They
represented the respective careers of The Honest and Dissolute
Miriers : the one, as I recall him, retrograding through successive
planes of dirt, drunkenness, disease, and death ; the other
advancing by corresponding stages to affluence and a white
shirt. Whatever may have been the artistic defects of these
drawings, the moral at least was obvious and distinct. That
it failed, however —as it did —to produce the desired reform
in mining morality may have been owing to the fact that the
average miner refused to recognise himself in either of these
positive characters ; and that even he who might have sat for
the model of the Dissolute Miner was perhaps dimly conscious
of some limitations and circumstances which partly relieved him
from responsibility. “Yer see,” remarked such a critic to the
writer, in the untranslatable poetry of his class, “it ain’t no
square game. They 've just put up the kecrds on that chap
from the start.”


generous action, and have thus avoided that moral confusion
which is apt to arise in the contemplation of mixed motives aud
qualities. But I should have burdened myself with the
responsibility of their creation, which as a humble writer of
romance and entitled to no particular reverence, I did not care
to do.
I fear I cannot claim, therefore, any higher motive than to
illustrate an era of which Californian history has preserved the
incidents more often than the character of the actors, —an era
which the panegyrist was too often content to bridge over with
a general compliment to its survivors,—an era still so recent
that in attempting to revive its poetry, I am conscious also of
awakening the more prosaic recollections of these same
survivors, —and yet an era replete with a certain heroic Greek
poetry, of which perhaps none were more unconscious than the
heroes themselves. And I shall be quite content to have
collected here merely the materials for the Iliad that is yet to
be sung.

THE LUCK OF EOAEING CAMP.
There was commotion in Roaring Camp. It could not have been
a fight, for in 1850 that was not novel enough to have called
together the entire settlement. The ditches and claims were not
only deserted, but “Tuttle’s grocery’’had contributed its gam-
blers, who, it will be remembered, calmly continued their game
the day that French Pete and Kanaka Joe shot each other to
death over the bar in the front room. The whole camp was col-
lected before a rude cabin on the outer edge of the clearing. Con-
versation was carried on in a low tone, but the name of a woman
was frequently repeated. It was a name familiar enough in the
camp, —“ Cherokee Sal.”
Perhaps the less said of her the better. She was a coarse, and,
it is to be feared, a very sinful woman. But at that time she was
the only woman in Roaring Camp, and was just then lying in sore
extremity, when she most needed the ministration of her own sex.
Dissolute, abandoned, and irreclaimable, she was yet suffering a
martyrdom hard enough to bear even when veiled by sympathising
womanhood, but now terrible in her loneliness. The primal curse
had come to her in that original isolation which must have made
the punishment of the first transgression so dreadful. It was,
perhaps, part of the expiation of her sin, that, at a moment when
she most lacked her sex’s intuitive tenderness and care, she met
only the'half-contemptuous faces of her masculine associates. Yet
a few of the spectators were, I think, touched by her sufferings.
Sandy Tipton thought it wasV rough on Sal,” and, in the contem-
plation of her condition, for a moment rose superior to the fact
that he had an ace and two bowers in his sleeve.
It will be seen, also, that the situation was novel. Deaths were
by no means uncommon in Roaring Camp, but a birth was a new
thing. People had been dismissed the camp effectively, finally,
and with no possibility of return ; but this was the first time that
anybody had been introduced ah initio. Hence the excitement.
“ You go in there, Stumpy,” said a prominent citizen known as
“ Kentuck,” addressing one of the loungers. “Go in there, and
see what you kin do. You’ve had experience in them things.”
Perhaps there was a fitness in the selection. Stumpy, in other
climes, had been the putative head of two families; in fact, it was


owing to some legal informality in these proceedings that Roar-
ing Camp—a city of refuge—was indebted to his company. The
crowd approved the choice, and Stumpy was wise enough to bow
to the majority. The door closed on the extempore surgeon and
midwife, and Roaring Camp sat down outside, smoked its pipe,
and awaited the issue.
The assemblage numbered about a hundred men. One or two
of these were actual fugitives from justice, some were criminal, and
all were reckless. Physically, they exhibited no indication of
their past lives and character. The greatest scamp had a Raphael
face with a profusion of blonde hair; Oakhurst, a gambler, had the
melancholy ah’ and intellectual abstraction of a Hamlet; the
coolest and most courageous man was scarcely over five feet in
height, with a soft voice and an embarrassed, timid manner. The
term “ roughs ” applied to them was a distinction rather than a
definition. Perhaps in the minor details of fingers, toes, ears, etc.,
the camp may have been deficient, but these slight omissions did
not detract from theh aggregate force. The strongest man had
but three fingers on his right hand ; the best shot had but
one eye.
Such was the physical aspect of the men that were dispersed
around the cabin. The camp lay in a triangular valley, between
two hills and a river. The only outlet was a steep trail over the
summit ’of a hill that faced the cabin, now illuminated by the rising
moon. The suffering woman might have seen it from the rude
bunk whereon she lay—seen it winding like a silver thread until
it was lost in the stars above.
A fire of withered pine boughs added sociability to the gather-
ing. By degrees the natural levity of Roaring Camp returned.
Bets were freely offered and taken regarding the result. Three to
five that “ Sal would get through with it ” ; even, that the child
would survive ; side bets as to the sex and complexion of the
coming stranger. In the midst of an excited discussion an ex-
clamation came from those nearest to the door, and the camp stopped
to listen. Above the swaying and moaning of the pines, the swift
rush of the river, and the crackling of the fire, rose a sharp, queru-
lous cry, —a cry unlike anything heard before in the camp. The
pines stopped moaning, the river ceased to rush, and the fire to
crackle. It seemed as if Nature had stopped to listen too.
The camp rose to its feet as one man ! It was proposed to ex-
plode a barrel of gunpowder, but, in consideration of the situation
of the mother, better counsels prevailed, and only a few revolvers
were discharged; for, whether owing to the rude surgery of the camp,
or some other reason, Cherokee Sail was sinking fast. Within an
hour she had climbed, as it were, that rugged road that led to the
stars, and so passed out of Roaring Camp, its sin and shame for ever.
I do not think that the announcement disturbed them much, except
in speculation as to the fate of the child. “ Can he live now ? ” was
asked of Stumpy. The answer was doubtful. The only other


being of Cherokee Sal’s sex and maternal condition in the settle-
ment was an ass. There was some conjecture as to fitness, but the
experiment was tried. It was less problematical than the ancient
treatment of Romulus and Remus, and apparently as successful.
When these details were completed, which exhausted another
hour, the door was opened, and the anxious crowd of men who
had already formed themselves into a queue, entered in single file.
Beside the low bunk or shelf, on which the figure of the mother
was starkly outlined below the blankets, stood a pine tablh. On
this a candle-box was placed, and within it, swathed in staring red
flannel, lay the last arrival at Roaring Camp. Beside the candle-
box was placed a hat. Its use was soon indicated. “ Gentlemen,”
said Stumpy, with* a singular mixture of authority and ex officio
complacency,—“ Gentlemen will please pass in at the front door,
round the table, and out at the back door. Them as wishes to
contribute anything toward the orphan will find a hat handy.”
The first man entered with his hat on ; he uncovered, however, as
he looked about him, and so, unconsciously, set an example to the
next. In such communities good and bad actions are catching.
As the procession filed in, comments were audible, —criticisms
addressed, perhaps, rather to Stumpy, in the character of Show-
man, —“ Is that him?” “ mighty small specimen” ; “hasn’tmor’n
got the color”; “ ain’t bigger nor a derringer.” The contributions
were as characteristic: A silver tobacco-box ; a doubloon ; a navy
revolver, silver mounted ; a gold specimen ; a very beautifully
embroidered lady’s handkerchief (from Gakhurst the gambler) ;
a diamond breastpin ; a diamond ring (suggested by the pin, with
the remark from the giver that he “ saw that pin and went two
diamonds better”) ; a slung shot; a Bible (contributor not de-
tected) ; a golden spur ; a silver teaspoon (the initials, I regret to
say, were not the giver’s) ; a pair of surgeon’s shears; a lancet; a
Bank of England note for £5 ; and about S2OO in loose gold and
silver coin. During these proceedings Stumpy maintained a
silence as impassive as the dead on his left, a gravity as inscrutable
as that of the newly born on his right. Only one incident occurred
to break the monotony of the curious procession. As Kentuck bent
over the candle-box half curiously, the child turned, and, in a
spasm of pain, caught at his groping finger, and held it fast for a
moment. Kentuck looked foolish and embarrassed. Something
like a blush tried to assert itself in his weather-beaten cheek.
“ The d—d little cuss ! ” he said, as he extricated his finger, with,
perhaps more tenderness and care than he might have been deemed
capable of showing. He held that finger a little apart from its
fellows as he went out, and examined it curiously. The examina-
tion provoked the same original remark in regard to the child.
In fact, he seemed to enjoy repeating it. “He rastled with my
finger,” he remarked to Tipton, holding up the member, “ the
d—d little cuss ! ”
It was four o’clock before the camp sought repose, A light


burnt in the cabin where the watchers sat, for Stumpy did not go
to bed that night. Nor did Kentuck. He drank quite freely, and
related with great gusto his experience, invariably ending with his
characteristic condemnation of the new comer. It seemed to re-
lieve him of any unjust implication of sentiment, and Kentuck had
the weaknesses of the nobler sex. When everybody else had
gone to bed, he walked down to the river, and whistled reflect-
ingly. Then he walked up the gulch, past the cabin, still whistling
with demonstrative unconcern. At a large redwood tree he paused
and retraced his steps, and again passed the cabin. Half-way
down to the river’s bank he again paused, and then returned and
knocked at the door. It was opened by Stumpy. “ How goes
it?” said Kentuck, looking past Stumpy toward the candle-box.
“All serene,” replied Stumpy. “Anything up?” “Nothing.”
There was a pause—an embarrassing one—Stumpy still holding
the door. Then Kentuck had recourse to his finger, which he
held up to Stumpy. “ Eastled with it, the d —d little cuss,” he
said, and retired.
The next day Cherokee Sal had such rude sepulture as Roaring
Camp afforded. After her body had been committed to the hill-
side, there was a formal meeting of the camp to discuss what
should be done with her infant. A resolution to adopt it was
unanimous and enthusiastic. But an animated discussion in re-
gard to the manner and feasibility of providing for its wants at
once sprung up. It -was remarkable that the argument partook of
none of those fierce personalities with which discussions were
usually conducted at Roaring Camp. Tipton proposed that they
should send the child to Red Dog,—a distance of forty miles, —
where female attention could be procured. But the unlucky sug-
gestion met with fierce and unanimous opposition. It was evident
that no plan which entailed parting from their new acquisition
would for a moment be entertained. “ Besides,” said Tom Ryder,
“ them fellows at Red Dog would swap it, and ring in somebody
else on us.” A disbelief in the honesty of other camps prevailed
at Roaring Camp as in other places.
The introduction of a female nurse in the camp also met with
objection. It was argued that no decent woman could be pre-
vailed to accept Roaring Camp as her home, and the speaker
urged that “ they didn’t want any more of the other kind.” This
unkind allusion to the defunct mother, harsh as it may seem, was
the first spasm of propriety,—the first symptom of the camp’s
regeneration. • Stumpy advanced nothing. Perhaps he felt a
certain delicacy in interfering with the selection of a possible
successor in office. But when questioned, he averred stoutly that
he and “Jinny”—the mammal before alluded to—could manage
to rear the child. There was something original, independent, and
heroic about the plan that pleased the camp. Stumpy was re-
tained. Certain articles were sent for to Sacramento. “ Mind,”
said the treasurer, as he pressed a bag of gold-dust into the ex-


pressman’s hand, “ the best that can be got, —lace, you know, and
filigree-work and frills, —d—n the cost! ”
Strange to say, the child thrived. Perhaps the invigorating
climate of the mountain camp was compensation for material de-
ficiencies. Nature took the foundling to her broader breast. In
that rare atmosphere of the Sierra foot-hills, —that air pungent
with balsamic odour, that ethereal cordial at once bracing and
exhilarating,—he may have found food and nourishment, or a
subtle chemistry that transmuted asses’ milk to lime and phos-
phorus. Stumpy inclined to,the belief that it was the latter and
good nursing. “Me and that ass,” he would say, “ has been father
and mother to him ! Don’t you,” he would add, apostrophizing
the helpless bundle before him, “ never go back on us.”
By the time he was a month old, the necessity of giving him a
name became apparent. He had generally been known as “ the
Kid,” “Stumpy’s boy,” “the Cayote” (an allusion to his vocal
powers), and even by Kentuck’s endearing diminutive of “the
d—d little cuss.” But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfac-
tory, and were at last dismissed under another influence. Gam-
blers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and Oakhurst
one day declared that the baby had brought “the luck” to Roaring
Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful.
“ Luck” was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for
greater convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and
the father was unknown. “ It’s better,” said the philosophical Oak-
hurst, “to take a fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start
him fair.” A day was accordingly set apart for the christening.
What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine, who
has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of
Roaring Camp. The master of the ceremonies was one “ Boston,”
a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest
facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days in pre-
paring a burlesque of the church service, with pointed local allu-
sions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to
stand godfather. But after the procession had marched to the
grove with music and banners, and the child had been deposited
before a mock altar, Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd.
■“ It ain’t my style to spoil fun, boys,” said the little man, stoutly,
eyeing the faces around him, “ but it strikes me that this thing
ain’t exactly on the squar. It’s playing it pretty low down on this
yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain’t going to understand,
and ef there’s going to be any godfathers round, I’d like to see
who’s got any better rights than me.” A silence followed Stumpy’s
speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said, that the first man
to acknowledge its justice was the satirist, thus stopped of his fun.
“ But,” said Stumpy, quickly, following up his advantage, “ we’re
here for a christening, and we’ll have it. I proclaim you Thomas
Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of
California, so help me God.” It was the first time that the name


of the Deity had been uttered otherwise than profanely in the
camp. The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous
than the satirist had conceived; but, strangely enough, nobody
saw it, and nobody laughed. “ Tommy” was christened as seriously
as he would have been under a Christian roof, and cried and was
comforted in as orthodox fashion.
And so the work of regeneration began in Roaring Camp.
Almost imperceptibly a change came over the settlement. The
cabin assigned to “ Tommy Luck ” —or “ The Luck,” as he was
more frequently called—first showed signs of improvement. It
was kept scrupulously clean and white-washed. Then it was
boarded, clothed, and papered. The rosewood cradle —packed
eighty miles by mule— had, in Stumpy’s way of putting it, “ sorter
killed the rest of the furniture.” So the rehabilitation of the
cabin became a necessity. The men who were in the habit of
lounging in at Stumpy’s to see “ how The Luck got on ” seemed to
appreciate the change, and, in self defence, the rival establishment
of “ Tuttle’s grocery ” bestirred itself, and imported a carpet and
mirrors. The reflections of the latter on the appearance of
Roaring Camp tended to produce stricter habits of personal clean-
liness. ° Again, Stumpy imposed a kind of quarantine upon those
who aspired to the honor and privilege of holding “ The Luck. ’
It was a cruel mortification to Kentuck —who, in the carelessness
of a large nature and the habits of frontier life, had begun to
regard all garments as a second cuticle, which, like a snake’s, only
sloughed off through decay—to be debarred this privilege from
certain prudential reasons. Yet such was the subtle influence of
innovation that he thereafter appeared regularly every afternoon
in a clean shirt, and face still shining from his ablutions. Nor
were moral and social sanitary laws neglected. “ Tommy,” who
was supposed to spend his whole existence in a persistent attempt
to repose, must not be disturbed by noise. The shouting and yell-
ing which had gained the camp its infelicitous title were not per-
mitted within hearing distance of Stumpy’s. The men conversed
in whispers, or smoked with Indian gravity. Profanity was tacitly
given up in these sacred precincts, and throughout the camp a
popular form of expletive, known as “ D—n the luck ! ” and
“ Curse the luck ! ” was adandoned, as having a new personal
bearing. Vocal music was not interdicted, being supposed to have
a soothing, tranquillizing quality, and one song, sung by “ Man-o’-
War Jack,” an English sailor, from her Majesty’s Australian
colonies, was quite popular as a lullaby. It was a lugubrious
recital of the exploits of “the Arethusa, Seventy-four,” in a
muffled minor, ending with a prolonged dying fall at the burden
of each verse, “On b-o-o-o-ard of the Arethusa.” It was a fine
sight to see Jack holding The Luck, rocking from side to side as if
with the motion of a ship, and crooning forth this naval ditty.
Either through the peculiar rocking of Jack or the length of his
song,—it contained ninety stanzas, and was continued with con-


scicntious deliberation to the bitter end, —the lullaby generally
had the desired effect. At such times the men would lie at full
length under the trees, in the soft summer twilight, smoking their
pipes and drinking in the melodious utterances. An indistinct idea
that this was pastoral happiness pervaded the camp. “ This ’ere
kind o’ think,” said the Cockney Simmons, meditatively reclining
on his elbow, “is ’evingly.” It reminded him of Greenwich.
On the long summer days The Luck was usually carried Jo the
gulch, from whence the golden store of Roaring Camp was'taken.
There, on a blanket spread over pine-boughs, he would lie while
the men were working in the ditches below. Latterly, there was
a rude attempt to decorate this bower with flowers and sweet-
smelling shrubs, and generally some one would bring him a cluster
of wild honeysuckles, azaleas, or the painted blossoms of Las
Mariposas. The men had suddenly awakened to the fact that
there were beauty and significance in these trifles, which they had
so long trodden carelessly beneath their feet. A flake of glittering
mica, a fragment of variegated quartz, a bright pebble from the
bed of the creek, became beautiful to eyes thus cleared and
strengthened, and were invariably put aside for “ The Luck.” It
was wonderful how many treasures the woods and hillsides yielded
that “ would do for Tommy.” Surrounded by playthings such as
never child out of fairy-land had before, it is to be hoped that
Tommy was content. He appeared to be securely happy albeit
there was an infantine gravity about him, a contemplative light in
his round grey eyes that sometimes worried Stumpy. He was
always tractable and quiet, and it is recorded that once having
crept beyond his “ corral,” —a hedge of tessellated pine-boughs,
which surrounded his bed, —he dropped over the bank on his head
in the soft earth, and remained with his mottled legs in the air in
that position for at least five minutes with unflinching gravity.
He was extricated without a murmur. I hesitate to record the
many other instances of his sagacity, which rest, unfortunately,
upon the statements of prejudiced friends. Some of them were
not without a tinge of superstition. “ I crep’ up the bank just
now,” said Kentuck one day, in a breathless state of excitement,
“and dern my skin if he was n’t talking to a jay-bird as was a
sittin’ on his lap. There they was, just as free and sociable as
anything you please, a jawin’ at each other just like two cherry-
bums.” Howbeit, whether creeping over the pine-boughs or lying
lazily on his back blinking at the leaves above him, to him the
birds sang, the squirrels chattered, and the flowers bloomed.
Nature was his nurse and playfellow. For him she would let slip
between the leaves golden shafts of sunlight that fell just within
his grasp ; she would send wandering breezes to visit him with the
balm of bay and resinous gums ; to him the tall red-woods nodded
familiarly and sleepily, the bumble-bees buzzed, and the rooks
cawed a slumbrous accompaniment.
Such was the golden summer of Roaring Camp. They were


“ flush times,” —and the Luck was with them. The claims had
yielded enormously. The camp was jealous of its privileges and
looked suspiciously on strangers. No encouragement was given
to immigration, and, to make their seclusion more perfect, the land
on either side of the mountain wall that surrounded the camp they
duly pre-empted. This, and a reputation for singular proficiency
with the revolver, kept the reserve of Hearing Camp inviolate.
The expressman —their only connecting link with the surrounding
world —sometimes told wonderful stories of the camp. He would
say, “ They Ve a street up there in ‘ Roaring,’ that would lay
over any street in Red Dog. They’ve got vines and flowers round
their houses, and they wash themselves twice a day. But they ’re
mighty rough on strangers, and they worship an Ingin baby.”
With the prosperity of the camp came a desire for further improve-
ment. It was proposed to build an hotel in the following spring,
and to invite one or two decent families to reside there for the sake
of “ The Luck,” —who might perhaps profit by female companion-
ship. The sacrifice that this concession to the sex cost these men,
who were fiercely sceptical in regard to its general virtue and
usefulness, can only be accounted for by their affection for Tommy,
A few still held out. But the resolve could not be carried into
effect for three months, and the minority meekly yielded in the
hope that something might turn up to prevent it. And it did.
The winter of 1851 will long be remembered in the foot-hills.
The snow lay deep on the Sierras, and eveiy mountain creek
became a river, and eveiy river a lake. Each gorge and gulch
was transformed into a tumultuous watercourse that descended the
hillsides, tearing down giant trees and scattering its drift and
debris along the plain. Red Dog had been twice under water,
and Roaring Camp had been forewarned. “ Water put the gold
into them gulches,” said Stumpy. “ It’s been here once and will
be here again 1 ” And that night the North Eork suddenly
leaped over its banks, and swept up the triangular valley of
Roaring Camp.
In the confusion of rushing water, crushing trees, and crackling
timber, and the darkness which seemed to flow with the water
and blot out the fair valley, but little could be done to collect the
scattered camp. When the morning broke, the cabin of Stumpy
nearest the river-bank was gone. Higher up the gulch they found
the body of its unlucky owner ; but the pride, the hope, the joy,
the Luck, of Roaring Camp had disappeared. They were return-
ing with sad hearts, when a shout from the bank recalled them.
It was a relief-boat from down the river. They had picked up,
they said, a man and an infant, nearly exhausted, about two miles
below. Did anybody know them, and did they belong here ?
It needed but a glance to show them Kentuck lying there,
cruelly crushed and bruised, but still holding the Luck of Roaring
Camp in his arms. As they bent over the strangely assorted pair,
they saw that the child was cold and pulseless. “He is dead, ’


said one. Kentuck opened his eyes. “ Dead ? ” he repeated
feebly. “ Yes, my man, and you are dying too.” A smile lit
the eyes of the expiring Kentuck. “ Dying, he repeated, “ he’s a
taking me with him, —tell the boys I’ve got the Luck with me
now ” ; and the strong man, clinging to the frail babe as a
drowning man is said to cling to a straw, drifted away into the
shadowy river that flows for ever to the unknown sea.
THE OUTCASTS OF POKER FLAT.
As Mr. John Oakhurst, gambler, stepped into the main street of
Poker Flat on the morning of the twenty-third of November, 1850,
he was conscious of a change in its moral atmosphere since the pre-
ceding night. Two or three men, conversing earnestly together,
ceased as he approached, and exchanged significant glances.
There was a Sabbath lull in the air, which, in a settlement unused
to Sabbath influences, looked ominous.
Mr. Oakhurst’s calm, handsome face betrayed small concern in
these indications. Whether he was conscious of any predisposing
cause, was another question. “ I reckon they’re after somebody,”
he reflected; “ likely it’s me.” He returned to his pocket the hand-
kerchief with which he had been whipping away the red dust of
Poker Flat from his neat boots, and quietly discharged his mind
of any further conjecture.
In point of fact, Poker Flat was “after somebody.” It had lately
suffered the loss of several thousand dollars, two valuable horses,
and a prominent citizen. It was experiencing a spasm of virtuous
reaction, quite as lawless and ungovernable as any of the acts that
had provoked it. A secret committee had determined to rid the
town of all improper persons. This was done permanently in
regard of two men who were then hanging from the boughs of a
sycamore in the gulch, and temporarily in the banishment of cer-
tain other objectionable characters. I regret to say that some of
these were ladies. It is but due to the sex, however, to state that
their impropriety was professional, and it was only in such easily
established standards of evil that Poker Flat ventured to sit in
judgment.
Mr. Oakhurst was right in supposing that he was included in
this category. A few of the committee had urged hanging him as
a possible example, and a sure method of reimbursing themselves
from his pockets of the sums he had won from them. “ It’s agin
justice,” said Jim Wheeler, “to let this yer young man from
Roaring Camp—an entire stranger —carry away our money.” But
a crude sentiment of equity residing in the breasts of those who
had been fortunate enough to win from Mr. Oakhurst overruled
this narrower local prejudice.
Mr. Oakhurst received his sentence with philosophic calmness,
none the less coolly that he was aware of the hesitation of his
judges. He was too much of a gambler not to accept Fate.


With him life was at best an uncertain game, and he recognised the
usual percentage in favour of the dealer.
A body of armed men accompanied the deported wickedness of
Poker Flat to the outskirts of the settlement. Besides Mr. Oak-
hurst, who was known to be a coolly desperate man, and for whose
intimidation the aimed escort was intended, the expatriated party
consisted of a young woman familiarly known as “ The Duchess
another, who had won the title of “ Mother Shipton and “Uncle
Billy,” a suspected sluice-robber and confirmed drunkard. The
cavalcade provoked no comments from the spectators, nor was any
word uttered by the escort. Only, when the gulch which marked
the uttermost limit of 'Poker Flat was reached, the leader spoke
briefly and to the point. The exiles were forbidden to return at
the peril of their lives.
As the escort disappeared, their pent-up feelings found vent in a
few hysterical tears from the Duchess, some bad language from
Mother Shipton, and a Parthian volley of expletives from Uncle
Billy. The philosophic Oakhurst alone remained silent. He
listened calmly to Mother Shipton's desire to cut somebody’s heart
out, to the repeated statements of the Duchess that she would die
in the road, and to the alarming oaths that seemed to be bumped
out of Uncle Billy as he rode forward. With the easy good
humour characteristic of his class, he insisted upon exchanging his
own riding-horse, “ Five Spot,” for the sorry mule which the
Duchess rode. But even this act did not draw the party into any
closer sympathy. The young woman -readjusted her somewhat
draggled plumes with a feeble, faded coquetry ; Mother Shipton
eyed the possessor of “ Five Spot” with malevolence, and Uncle
Billy included the whole party in one sweeping anathema.
The road to Sandy Bar—a camp that, not having as yet experienced
the regenerating influences of Poker Flat, consequently seemed to
offer some invitation to the emigrants—lay over a steep mountain
range. It was distant a day’s severe travel. In that advanced
season, the party soon passed out of the moist, temperate region of
the foot-hills into the dry, cold, bracing air of the Sierras. The
trail was narrow and difficult. At noon the Duchess, rolling out of
the saddle upon the ground, declared her intention of going no
farther, and the party halted.
The spot was singularly wild and impressive. A wooded am-
phitheatre, surrounded on three sides by precipitous cliffs of naked
granite, sloped gently toward the crest of another precipice that
overlooked the valley. It was, undoubtedly, the most suitable spot
for a camp, had camping been advisable. But Mr. Oakhurst knew
that scarcely half the journey to Sandy Bar was accomplished,
and the party were not equipped or provisioned for delay. This
fact he pointed out to his companions curtly, with a philosophic
commentary on the folly of “ throwing up their hand before the
game was played out.” But they were furnished with liquor,
which in this emergency stood them in place of food, fuel, rest,


and prescience. In spite of his remonstrances, it was not long
before they were more or less under its influence. Uncle Billy
passed rapidly from a bellicose state into one of stupor, the
Duchess became maudlin, and Mother Shipton snored. Mr.
Oakhurst alone remained erect, leaning against a rock, calmly
surveying them.
Mr. Oakhurst dfd not drink. It interfered with a profession
which required coolness, impassiveness, and presence of
in his own language, he “could n’t afford it.” As he gazed at his
recumbent fellow-exiles, the loneliness begotten of his pariah-
trade, his habits of life, his very vices, for the first time seriously
oppressed him. He bestirred himself in dusting his black clothes,
washing his hands and face, and other acts characteristic of his
studiously neat habits, and for a moment forgot his annoyance.
The thought of deserting his weaker and more pitiable companions
never perhaps occurred to him. Yet he could not help feeling the
want of that excitement which, singularly enough, was most
conducive to that calm equanimity for which he was notorious.
He looked at the gloomy walls that rose a thousand feet sheer
above the circling pines around him; at the sky, ominously
clouded ; at the valley below, already deepening into shadow.
And, doing so, suddenly he heard his own name called.
A horseman slowly ascended the trail. In the fresh, open face
of the new comer Mr. Oakhurst recognized Tom Simson, otherwise
known as “ The Innocent ” of Sandy Bar. He had met him some
months before over “ a little game,” and had, with perfect
equanimity, won the entire fortune—amounting to some forty
dollars—of that guileless youth. After the game was finished, Mr.
Oakhurst drew the youthful speculator behind the door and thus
addressed him : “ Tommy, you ’re a good little man, but you
can’t gamble worth a cent. Don’t try it over again.” He then
handed him his money back, pushed him gently from the room,
and so made a devoted slave of Tom Simson.
There was a remembrance of this in his boyish and enthusiastic
greeting of Mr. Oakhurst. He had started, he said, to go to Poker
Flat to seek his fortune. “Alone?” No, not exactly alone ; in
fact (a giggle), he had run away with Piney Woods. Did n’t
Mr. Oakhurst remember Piney ? She that used to wait on the
table at the Temperance House ? They had been engaged a long
time, but old Jake Woods had objected, and so they had run
away, and were going to Poker Flat to be married, and here they
were. And they were tired out, and how lucky it was they had
found a place to camp and company. All this the Innocent
delivered rapidly, while Piney, a stout, comely damsel of fifteen,
emerged from behind the pine-tree, where she Mid been blushing
unseen, and rode to the side of her lover.
Mr. Oakhurst seldom troubled himself with sentiment, still less
with propriety ; but he had a vague idea that the situation was not
fortunate. He retained, however, his presence of mind sufficiently


to kick Uncle Billy, who was about to say something, and Uncle
Billy was sober enough to recognise in Mr. Oakhurst’s kick a
superior power that would not bear trifling. He then endeavoured
to dissuade Tom Simson from delaying further, but in vain. He
•even pointed out the fact that there was no provision, nor means
■of making a camp. But, unluckily, the Innocent met this
objection by assuring the party ‘that he was provided with an
extra mule loaded with provisions, and by the discovery of
a rude attempt at a log-house near the trail. “ Piney can stay
with Mrs. Oakhurst,” said the Innocent, pointing to the Duchess,
■“ and I can shift for myself.”
Nothing but Mr. Oakhurst’s admonishing foot saved Uncle Billy
from bursting into a roar of laughter. As it was, he felt com-
pelled to retire up the canon until he could recover his gravity.
There he confided the joke to the tall pine trees, with many slaps
of his leg, contortions of his face, and the usual profanity. But
when he returned to the party he found them seated by a fire —
for the air had grown strangely chill and the sky overcast—in
apparently amicable conversation. Piney was actually talking in
an impulsive girlish fashion to the Duchess, who was listening with
an interest and animation she had not shown for many days. The
Innocent was holding forth, apparently with equal effect, to Mr,
Oakhurst and Mother Shipton, who was actually relaxing into
amiability. “Is this yer a d—d picnic ? ” said Uncle Billy, with
inward scorn, as he surveyed the sylvan group, the glancing fire-
light, and the tethered animals in the foreground. Suddenly an
idea mingled with the alcoholic fumes that disturbed his brain.
It was apparently of a jocular nature, for he felt impelled to slap
his leg again and cram his fist into his mouth.
As the shadows crept slowly up the mountain, a slight breeze
rocked the tops of the pine trees, and moaned through their long
and gloomy aisles. The ruined cabin, patched and covered with
pine-boughs, was set apart for the ladies. As the lovers parted,
they unaffectedly exchanged a kiss, so honest and sincere that it
might have been heard above the swaying pines. The frail
Duchess and the malevolent Mother Shipton were probably too
stunned to remark upon this last evidence of simplicity, and so
turned without a word to the hut. The fire was replenished, the
men lay down before the door, and in a few minutes were asleep.
Mr. Oakhurst was a light sleeper. Toward morning he awoke
benumbed and cold. As he stirred the dying fire, the wind, which
was now blowing strongly, brought to his cheek that which caused
the blood to leave it, —snow !
He started to his feet with the intention of awakening the
sleepers, for the*e was no time to lose. But turning to where
Uncle Billy had been lying, he found him gone. A suspicion
leaped to his brain and a curse to his lips. He ran to the spot
where the mules had been tethered ; they were no longer there.
The tracks were already rapidly disappearing in the snow.


The momentary excitement brought Mr. Oakhurst back to the-
fire with his usual calm. He did not waken the sleepers. The
Innocent slumbered peacefully, with a smile on his good
humoured, freckled face ; the virgin Piney slept beside her frailer
sisters as sweetly as though attended by celestial guardians, and
Mr. Oakhurst, drawing his blanket over his shoulders, stroked his
moustaches and waited for the dawn. It came slowly in a whirling
mist of snow-flakes, that dazzled and confused the eye. What
could be seen of the landscape appeared magically changed. 'He
looked over the valley, and summed up the present and future in
two words, —“ snowed in ! ”
A careful inventory of the provisions, which, fortunately for the
party, had been stored within the hut, and so escaped the felonious
fingers of Uncle Billy, disclosed the fact that with care and pru-
dence they might last ten days longer. “ That is, said Mr. Oak-
hurst, sotto voce to the Innocent, “if you’re willing to board us.
If you ain’t —and*perhaps you’d better not—you can wait till
Uncle Billy gets back with provisions.” For some occult reason,
Mr. Oakhurst could not bring himself to disclose Uncle Billy’s
rascality, and so offered the hypothesis that he had wandered from
the camp and had accidentally stampeded the animals. He
dropped a warning to the Duchess and Mother Shipton, who of
course knew the facts of their associate’s defection. “ They ’ll
find out the truth about us all when they find out anything,” he
added significantly, “ and there’s no good frightening them now.”
Tom Simson not only put all his worldly store at the disposal of
Mr. Oakhurst, but seemed to enjoy the prospect of their enforced
seclusion. “ We’ll have a good camp for a week, and then the
snow ’ll melt, and we ’ll all go back together.” The cheerful
gaiety of the young man, and Mr. Oakhurst’s calm infected the
others. The Innocent, with the aid of pine-boughs, extemporized
a thatch for the roofless cabin, and the Duchess directed Piney in
the rearrangement of the interior with a taste and tact that
opened the blue eyes of that provincial maiden to their fullest
extent. “I reckon now you ’re used to fine things at Poker Flat,’ r
said Piney. The Duchess turned away sharply to conceal some-
thing that reddened her cheeks through its professional tint, and
Mother Shipton requested Piney not, to “ chatter.” But when
Mr. Oakhurst returned from a weary search for the trail, he
heard the sound of happy laughter echoed from the rocks. He
stopped in some alarm, and his thoughts first naturally reverted to
the whiskey, which he had prudently cachdd. “ And yet it don’t
somehow sound like whiskey,” said the gambler. It was not until
he caught sight of the blazing fire through the still-blinding
storm, and the group around it that he settled to the conviction
that it was “square fun.”
Whether Mr. Oakhurst had cached his cards with the whiskey,
as something debarred the free access of the community, I cannot
say. It was certain that, in Mother Shipton’s words, he “ did n’t


say cards once ” during that evening. Haply the time was beguiled
by an accordion, produced somewhat ostentatiously by Tom Simson
from his pack. Notwithstanding some difficulties attending the
manipulation of this instrument, Piney Woods managed to pluck
several reluctant melodies from its keys, to an accompaniment
by the Innocent on a pair of bone castinets. But the crowning
festivity of the evening was reached in a rude camp-meeting
hymn, which the lovers joining hands, sang with great earnestness
and vociferation. I fear that a certain defiant tone and Cove-
nanter’s swing to its chorus, rather than any devotional quality,
caused it speedily to infect the others, who at last joined in the
refrain :
“ I’m proud to live in the service of the Lord,
And I’m bound to die in His army.”
The pines rocked, the storm eddied and whirled above the
miserable group, and the flames of their altar leaped heavenward,
as if in token of the vow.
At midnight the storm abated, the rolling clouds parted, and
the stars glittered keenly above the sleeping camp. Mr. Oakhurst,
whose professional habits had enabled him to live on the smallest
possible amount of sleep, in dividing the watch with Tom Simson,
somehow managed to take upon himself the greater part of that
duty. He excused himself to the Innocent, by saying that he had
“ often been a week without sleep.” “ Doing what ? ” asked Tom.
n Poker ! ” replied Oakhurst, sententiously ; “ when a man gets a
streak of luck, —nigger-luck,—he don’t get tired. The luck gives
in first. Luck,” continued the gambler, reflectively, “is a mighty
•queer thing. All you know about it for certain is that it’s bound
to change. And it’s finding out when it’s going to change that
makes you. We’ve had a streak of bad luck since we left Poker
flat, —you come along, and slap you get into it, too. If you can
hold your cards right along*you’re all right. For,” added the
gambler, with cheerful irrelevance, —
“ ‘ I’m proud to live in the service of the Lord,
And I’m bound to die in His army.’ ”
The third day came, and the sun, looking through the white-
curtained valley, saw the outcasts divide their slowly decreasing
store of provisions for the morning meal. It was one of the pecu-
liarities of that mountain climate that its rays diffused a kindly
warmth over the wintry landscape, as if in regretful commiseration
•of the past. But it revealed drift on drift of snow piled high
around the hut, —a hopeless, uncharted, trackless sea of white
lying below the rocky shores to which the castaways still clung,
through the marvellously clear air the smoke of the pastoral
village of Poker Flat rose miles away. Mother Shipton saw it,
and, from a remote pinnacle of her rocky fastness, hurled in that
direction a final malediction. It was her last vituperative attempt,


and perhaps for that reason was invested with a certain degree of
sublimity. It did her good, she privately informed the Duchess.
u Just you go out there and cuss, and see.” She then set herself
to the task of amusing “ the child,” as she and the Duchess were
pleased to call Piney. Piney was no chicken, but it Was a soothing
and original theory of the pair thus to account for the fact that
she didn’t swear and wasn’t improper.
When night crept up again through the gorges, the reedy notes
of the accordion rose and fell in fitful spasms and long-drawn
gasps by the flickering camp-fire. But music failed to fill entirely
the aching void left by insufficient food, and a new diversion was
proposed by Piney,—story-telling. Neither Mr. Oakhurst nor his
female companions caring to relate their personal experiences, this
plan would have failed, too, but for the Innocent. Some months
before he had chanced upon a stray copy of Mr. Pope’s ingenious
translation of the Iliad. He now proposed to narrate the principal
incidents of that psem—having thoroughly mastered the argument
and fairly forgotten the words —in the current vernacular of Sandy
Bar. And so for the rest of that night the Homeric demigods again
walked the earth. Trojan bully and wily Greek wrestled in the
winds, and the great pines in the canon seemed to bow to the
wrath of the son of Peleus. Mr. Oakhurst listened with quiet
satisfaction. Most especially was he interested in the fate of
“ Ash-heels,” as the Innocent persisted in denominating the
“ swift-footed Achilles.”
So with small food and much of Homer and the accordion, a
week passed over the heads of the outcasts. The sun again
forsook them, and again from leaden skies the snow-flakes were
sifted over the land. Day by day closer around them drew the
snowy circle, until at last they looked from their prison over
drifted walls of dazzling white, that towered twenty feet above
their heads. It became more and more difficult to replenish their
fires, even from the fallen trees beside them, now half hidden in
the drifts. And yet no one complained. The lovers turned from
the dreary prospect and looked into each other’s eyes, and were
happy. Mr. Oakhurst settled himself coolly to the losing game
before him. The Duchess, more cheerful than she had been,
assumed the care of Piney. Only Mother Shipton—once the
strongest of the party—seemed to sicken and fade. At midnight
on the tenth day she called Oakhurst to her side. “ I’m going,”
she said, in a voice of querulous weakness, “ but don’t say
anything about it. Don’t waken the kids. Take the bundle from
under my head and open it.” Mr. Oakhurst did so. It contained
Mother Shipton’s rations for the last week, untouched. “ Give ’em
to the child,” she said, pointing to the sleeping Piney. “ You’ve
starved yourself,” said the gambler. “ That’s what they call it,”
said the woman, querulously, as she lay down again, and, turning
her face to the wall, passed quietly away.
The accordion and the bones were put aside that day, and Homer


was forgotten. When the body of Mother Shipton had been com-
mitted to the snow, Mr. Oakhurst took the Innocent aside, and
showed him a pair of snow-shoes, which he had fashioned from
the old pack-saddle. “ There’s one chance in a hundred to save
her yet,” he said, pointing to Piney; “but it’s there,” he added,
pointing towards Poker Flat, “If you can reach there in two days
she’s safe.” “ And you ?” asked Tom Simson. “ ITI stay here,” was
the curt reply.
The lovers parted with a long embrace. “You are not going,
too ?” said the Duchess, as she saw Mr. Oakhurst apparently wait-
ing to accompany him. “As far as the canon,” he replied. He
turned suddenly, and kissed the Duchess, leaving her pallid face
aflame, and her trembling limbs rigid with amazement.
Night came, but not Mr. Oakhurst. It brought the storm again
and the whirling snow. Then the Duchess, feeding the fire, found
that some one had quietly piled beside the hut enough fuel to last
a few days longer. The team rose to her eyes, but she hid them
from Piney.
The women slept but little. In the morning, looking into each
other’s faces, they read their fate. Neither spoke ; but Piney,
accepting the position of the stronger, drew near and placed her
arm around the Duchess’s waist. They kept this attitude for the
rest of the day. That night the storm reached its greatest fury, and,
rending asunder the protecting pines, invaded the very hut.
Toward morning they found themselves unable to feed the fire,
which gradually died away. As the embers slowly blackened,
the Duchess crept closer to Piney, and broke the silence of many
hours : “ Piney, can you pray?” “No, dear,” said Piney, simply.
The Duchess, without knowing exactly why, felt relieved, and,
putting her head upon Piney’s shoulder, spoke no more. And so
reclining, the younger and purer pillowing the head of her soiled
sister upon her virgin breast, they fell asleep.
The wind lulled as if it feared to waken them. Feathery drifts
of snow, shaken from the long pine-boughs, flew like white-winged
birds, and settled about them as they slept. The moon through
the rifted clouds looked down upon what had been the camp. But
all human stain, all trace of earthly travail, was hidden beneath
the spotless mantle mercifully flung from above.
They slept all that day and the next, nor did they waken when
voices and footsteps broke the silence of the camp. And when
pitying fingers brushed the snow from their wan faces, you could
scarcely have told from the equal peace that dwelt upon them,
which was she that had sinned. Even the law of Poker Flat
recognised this, and tinned away, leaving them still locked in
each other’s arms.
But at the head of the gulch, on one of the largest pine-trees,
they found the deuce of clubs pinned to the bark with a bowie-
knife. It bore the following, written in pencil, in a firm
hand :


BENEATH THIS TREE
LIES THE BODY
JOHN OAKHURST,
WHO STRUCK A STREAK OP BAD LUCK
ON THE 23RD OP NOVEMBER, 1850,
AND
HANDED IN HIS CHECKS
ON THE 7TH DECEMBER, 1860.
And pulseless and cold, with a Derringer by his side and a bullet
in his heart, though still calm as in life, beneath the snow lay he
who was at once the strongest and yet the weakest of the outcasts
of Poker Flat.
HIGGLES.
We were eight, including the driver. We had not spoken during
the passage of the last six miles, since the jolting of the heavy-
vehicle over the roughening road had spoiled the Judge’s last poeti-
cal quotation. The tall man beside the Judge was asleep, his arm
passed through the swaying strap and his head resting upon it, —
altogether a limp, helpless-looking object, as if he had hanged
himself and been cut down too late. The French lady on the
back seat was asleep, too, yet in a half-conscious propriety of
attitude, shown even in the disposition of the handkerchief which
she held to her forehead and which partially veiled her face. The
lady from Virginia City, travelling with her husband, had long since
lost all individuality in a wild confusion of ribbons, veils, furs, and
shawls. There was no sound but the rattling of wheels and the
dash of rain upon the roof. Suddenly the stage stopped and we
became dimly aware of voices. The driver was evidently in the
midst of an exciting colloquy with some one in the road, —a col-
loquy of which such fragments as “bridge gone,” “twenty feet of
water,” “ can’t pass,” were occasionally distinguishable above the
storm. Then came a lull, and a mysterious voice from the road
shouted the parting adjuration—
“ Try Miggles’s.”
We caught a glimpse of our leaders as the vehicle slowly turned,
of a horseman vanishing through the rain, and we were evidently
on our way to Miggles’s.
Who and where was Higgles ? The Judge, ouf authority, did
not remember the name, and he knew the country thoroughly.
The Washoe traveller thought Higgles must keep a hotel. We only
knew that we were stopped by high water in front and rear, and
that Higgles was our rock of refuge. A ten minutes’ splashing
through a tangled by-road, scarcely wide enough for the stage,


and we drew up before a barred and boarded gate in a wide stone
wall or fence about eight feet high. Evidently Miggles’s, and
evidently Higgles did not keep a hotel.
The driver got down and tried the gate. It was securely locked.
“ Higgles ! 0 Higgles ! ”
No answer.
« Higg-ells ! You Higgles ! ” continued the driver, with rising
wrath.
“ Higglesy! ” joined in the expressman, persuasively. O
Higgy ! Hig ! ”
But no reply came from the apparently insensate Higgles, The
Judge, who had finally got the window down, put his head out
and propounded a series of questions, which if answered
categorically would have undoubtedly elucidated the whole
mystery, but which the driver evaded by replying that “if we
did n’t want to sit in the coach all night, we had better rise up
and sing out for Higgles.”
So we rose up and called on Higgles in chorus; then separately.
And when we had finished, a Hibernian fellow-passenger from the
roof called for “ Haygells ! ” whereat we all laughed. While
we were laughing, the driver cried “ Shoo.”
We listened. To our infinite amazement the chorus of
“ Higgles ” was repeated from the other side of the wall, even to
the final and supplemental “ Haygells.”
“ Extraordinary echo,” said the Judge.
“ Extraordinary d—d skunk ! ” roared the driver, contemp-
tuously. “ Come out of that, Higgles, and show yourself ! Be a
man, Higgles ! Don’t hide in the dark ; I would n’t if I were
you, Higgles,” continued Yuba Bill, now dancing about in an
excess of fury.
“ Higgles ! ” continued the voice, “ 0 Higgles ! ”
“Hy good man ! Hr. Hyghail! ” said the Judge, softening the
asperities of the name as much as possible. “Consider the
inhospitality of refusing shelter from the inclemency of the
weather to helpless females. Really, my dear sir—” But a
succession of “ Higgles,” ending in a burst of laughter, drowned
his voice.
Yuba Bill hesitated no longer. Taking a heavy stone from the
road, he battered down the gate, and with the expressman
entered the enclosure. We followed. Nobody was to be seen. In
the gathering darkness all that we could, distinguish was that we
were in a garden—from the rose-bushes that scattered over us a
minute spray from their dripping leaves —and before a long
rambling wooden building.
“ Do you know this Higgles ? ” asked the Judge ok Yuba Bill.
“ No, nor don’t want to,” said Bill, shortly, who felt the Pioneer
Stage Company insulted in his person by the contumacious Higgles.
“ But, my dear sir,” expostulated the Judge, as he thought of
the barred gate.


“ Lookee here,” said Yuba Bill, with fine bony, “ had n’t you
better go back and sit in the coach till yer introduced ? I’m
going in,” and he pushed opened the door of the building.
A long room lighted only by the embers of a fire that was
dying on the large hearth at its further extremity ; the walls
curiously papered, and the flickering firelight bringing out its
grotesque pattern ; somebody sitting in a large arm-chair by the
fireplace. All this we saw as we crowded together into the room,
after the driver and expressman.
“Hello, be you Higgles?” said Yuba Bill to the solitary oc-
cupant.
The figure neither spoke nor stirred. Yuba Bill walked wrath-
fully toward it, and turned the eye of his coach-lantern upon its
face. It was a man’s face, prematurely old and wrinkled, with
very large eyes, in which there was that expression of perfectly
gratuitous solemnity which I had sometimes seen in an owl’s.
The large eyes wandered from Bill’s face to the lantern, and
finally fixed their gaze on that luminous object, without further
recognition.
Bill restrained himself with an effort.
“ Higgles ! Be you deaf ? You ain’t dumb anyhow, you know
and Yuba Bill shook the insensate figure by the shoulder.
To our great dismay, as Bill removed his hand, the venerable
stranger apparently collapsed,—sinking into half his size and an
undistinguishable heap of clothing.
“Well, dem my skin,” said Bill looking appealingly at us, and
hopelessly retiring from the contest.
The Judge now stepped forward, and we lifted the mysterious
invertebrate back into his original position. Bill was dismissed
with the lantern to reconnoitre outside, for it was evident that from
the helplessness of this solitary man there must be attendants near
at hand, and we all drew around the fire. The Judge, who had
regained his authority, and had never lost his conversational amia-
bility,—standing before us with his back to the hearth, —charged
us, as an imaginary jury, as follows :
“It is evident that either our distinguished friend here has
reached that condition described by Shakespeare as ‘ the sere and
yellow leaf,’ or has suffered some premature abatement of his men-
tal and physical faculties. Whether he is really the Higgles—”
Here he was interrupted by “ Higgles ! O Higgles ! Higglesy I
Hig ! ” and, in fact, the,whole chorus of Higgles in very much the
same key as it had once before been delivered unto us.
We gazed at each other for a moment in some alarm. The
Judge, in particular, vacated his position quickly, as the voice
seemed to come directly over his shoulder. The cause, however,
was soon discovered in a large magpie who was perched upon a
shelf over the fireplace, and who immediately relapsed into a
sepulchral silence, which contrasted singularly with his previous
volubility. It was, undoubtedly, his voice which we had heard in


the road, and our friend in the chair was not responsible for the
discourtesy. Yuba Bill, who re-entered the room after an unsuc-
cessful search, was loath to accept the explanation, and still eyed
the helpless sitter with suspicion; He had found a shed in which
he had put up his horses, but he came back dripping and sceptical.
“ Thar ain’t nobody but him within ten mile of the shanty, and
that ’ar d—d old skeesicks knows it.’ J
But the faith of the majority proved to be securely based. Bill
had scarcely ceased growling before we heard a quick step upon
the porch, the trailing of a wet skirt, the door was flung open, and
with a flash of white teeth, a sparkle of dark eyes and an utter
absence of ceremony or diffidence, a young woman entered, shut
the door, and, panting, leaned back against it.
“ O, if you please, I’m Higgles ! ”
And this was Higgles ! this bright-eyed, full-throated young
woman, whose wet gown of coarse blue stuff could not hide the
beauty of the feminine curves to which it clung ; from the chest-
nut crown of whose head, topped by a man’s oilskin sou’wester, to
the little feet and ankles, hidden somewhere in the recesses of her
boy’s brogans, all was grace ; —this was Higgles, laughing at us,
too, in the most airy, frank, off-hand manner imaginable.
“ You see, boys,” said she, quite out of breath, and holding one
little hand against her side, quite unheeding the speechless dis-
comfiture of our party, or the complete demoralization of Yuba
Bill, whose features had relaxed into an expression of gratuitous
and imbecile cheerfulness, —“ you see, boys, I was mor’n two miles
away when you passed down the road. I thought you might pull
up here, and so I ran the whole way, knowing nobody was home
but Jim, —and —and—I’m out of breath—and—that lets me out.”
And here Higgles caught her dripping oil-skin hat from her
head, with a mischievous swirl that scattered a shower of rain-
drops over us ; attempted to put back her hair ; dropped two hair-
pins in the attempt; laughed and sat down beside Yuba Bill, with
her hands crossed lightly on‘ her lap.
The Judge recovered himself first, and essayed an extravagant
compliment.
“ I T 1 trouble you for that thar hair-pin,” said Higgles, gravely.
Half a dozen hands were eagerly stretched forward ; the missing
hair-pin was restored to its fair owner ; and Higgles, crossing the
room, looked keenly in the face of the invalid. The solemn eyes
looked back at hers with an expression we had never seen
before. Life and intelligence seemed to struggle back into the
rugged face. Higgles laughed again,—it was a singularly eloquent
laugh,—and turned her black eyes and white teeth once more
toward us.
“ This afflicted person is ” hesitated the Judge.
“ Jim,” said Higgles.
“ Your father 7 ”
“No,"


44 Brother 1 ”
“ No.”
“ Husband 1 ”
Higgles darted a quick, half-defiant glance at the two lady
passengers who I had noticed did not participate in the general
masculine admiration of Higgles, and said, gravely, “ No;
it’s Jim.”
There was an awkward pause. The lady passengers moved
closer to each other ; the Washoe husband looked abstractedly at
the fire ; and the tall man apparently turned his eyes inward for
self-support at this emergency. But Higgles’s laugh, which was
very infectious, broke the silence. “ Come,” she said briskly,
41 you must be hungry. Who’ll bear a hand to help me get tea ?”
She had no lack of volunteers. In a few moments Yuba Bill
was engaged like Caliban in bearing logs for this Hiranda ; the
expressman was grinding coffee on the verandah ; to myself the
arduous duty of slicing bacon was assigned ; and the Judge lent
each man his good-humoured and voluble counsel. And when
Higgles, assisted by the Judge and our Hibernian “ deck-passen-
ger,” set the table with all the available crockery, we had become
quite joyous, in spite of the rain that beat against the windows,
the wind that whirled down the chimney, the two ladies who
whispered together in the corner, or the magpie who uttered a
satirical and croaking commentary on their conversation from his
perch above. In the now bright, blazing fire we could see that
the walls were papered with illustrated journals, arranged with
feminine taste and discrimination. The furniture was extem-
porized, and adapted from candle-boxes and packing-cases, and
covered with gay calico, or the skin of some animal. The arm-
chair of the helpless Jim was an ingenious variation of a flour-
barrel. There was neatness, and even a taste for the picturesque,
to be seen in the few details of the long low room.
The meal was a culinary success. But more, it was a social
triumph,—chiefly, I think, owing to the rare tact of Higgles in
guiding the conversation, asking all the questions herself, yet bearing
throughout a frankness that rejected the idea of any concealment
on her own part, so that we talked of ourselves, of our prospects,
of the journey, of the weather, of each other, —of everything but
our host and hostess. It must be confessed that Higgles’s con-
versation was never elegant, rarely grammatical, and that at times
she employed expletives, the use of which had generally been
yielded to our sex. But they were delivered with such a lighting
up of teeth and eyes, and were usually followed by a laugh—a
laugh peculiar to Higgles—so frank and honest that it seemed to
clear the moral atmosphere.
Once, during the meal, we heard a noise like the rubbing of a
heavy body against the outer walls of the house. This was shortly
followed by a scratching and sniffling at the door. “ That’s Joa-
quin,” said Higgles, in reply to our questioning glances ; “ would


you like to see him ? ” Before we could answer she had opened
the door, and disclosed a half-grown grizzly, who instantly raised
himself on his haunches, with his forepaws hanging down in the
popular attitude of mendicancy, and looked admiringly at Higgles,
with a very singular resemblance in his manner to Yuba Bill.
“ That’s my watch-dog,” said Higgles, in explanation. “0, he
don’t bite,” she added, as the two lady passengers fluttered into a
corner. “ Does he, old Toppy 1 ” (the latter remark being ad-
dressed directly to the sagacious Joaquin.) “ I tell you what,
boys,” continued Higgles, after she had fed and closed the door on
Ursa Minor, “ you were in big luck that Joaquin wasn’t hanging
round when you dropped in to-night.” “ Where was he 7” asked
the Judge. “ With me,” said Higgles. “ Lord love you ; he trots
round with me nights like as if he was a man.”
We were silent for a few moments, and listened to the wind.
Perhaps we all had the same picture before us, —of Higgles
walking through the rainy woods, with her savage guardian at
her side. The Judge, I remember, said something about Una and
her lion ; but Higgles received it as she did other compliments,
with quiet gravity. Whether she was altogether unconscious of
the admiration she excited, —she could hardly have been oblivious
of Yuba Bill’s adoration, —I know not; but her very frankness
suggested a perfect sexual equality that was cruelly humiliating
to the younger member’s of our party.
The incident of the bear did not add anything in Higgles’s
favour to the opinions of those of her own sex who were present.
In fact, the repast over, a chillness radiated from the two lady
passengers that no pine-boughs brought in by Yuba Bill and cast
as a sacrifice upon the hearth could wholly overcome. Higgles
felt it; and, suddenly declaring that it was time to “ turn in,”
offered to show the ladies to their bed in an adjoining room.
“ You, boys, will have to camp out here by the fire as well as you
can,” she added, “ for thar ain’t but the one room.”
Our sex—by which, my dear sir, I allude of course to the
stronger portion of humanity—has been generally relieved from
the imputation of curiosity, or q fondness for gossip. Yet I am
constrained to say, that hardly had the door closed on Higgles
than we crowded together, whispering, snickering, smiling, and
exchanging suspicions, surmises, and a thousand speculations in
regard to our pretty hostess and her singular companion. I fear
that we even hustled that imbecile paralytic, who sat like a voice-
less Hemnon in our midst, gazing with the serene indifference of
the Past in his passionless eyes upon our wordy counsels. In the
midst of an exciting discussion the door opened again, and Higgles
re-entered.
But not, apparently, the same Higgles who a few hours before
had flashed upon us. Her eyes were downcast, and as she
hesitated for a moment on the threshold, with a blanket on her
arm, she seemed to have left behind her the frank fearlessness


which had charmed us a moment before. Coming into the room,
she drew a low stool beside the paralytic’s chair, sat down, drew
the blanket over her shoulders, and saying, “ If it’s all the same to
you, boys, as we’re rather crowded, I’ll stop here to-night,” took
the invalid’s withered hand in her own, and turned her eyes upon
the dying fire. An instinctive feeling that this was only premoni-
tory to more confidential relations, and perhaps some shame„at our
previous curiosity, kept us silent. The rain still beat upon the
roof, wandering gusts of wind stirred the embers into momentary
brightness, until, in a lull of the elements, Higgles suddenly lifted
up her head, and throwing her hair over her shoulder, turned her
face upon the group and asked, —
“ Is there any of you that knows me ? ”
There was no reply.
“ Think again ! I lived at Marysville in ’53. Everybody knew
me there, and everybody had the right to know me. I kept the
Polka Saloon until I came to live with Jim. That’s six years ago.
Perhaps I have changed some.”
The absence of recognition may have disconcerted her. She
turned her head to the fire again, and it was some seconds before
she again spoke, and then more rapidly :
“Well, you see I thought some of you must have known me.
There’s no great harm done anyway. What I was going to say
was this : Jim here ” —she took his hand in both of hers as she
spoke—“ used to know me, if you did n’t and spent a heap of
money upon me. I reckon he spent all he had. And one day—
it’s six years ago this winter—Jim came into my back room, sat
down on my sofy, like as you see him in that chair and never
moved again without help. He was struck all of a heap, and
never seemed to know what ailed him. The doctors came and
said as how it was caused all along of his way of life, —for Jim
was mighty free and wild like, —and that he would never get
better, and could n’t last long anyway. They advised me to send
him to Frisco to the hospital, for he was no good to any one and
would be a baby all his life. Perhaps it was something in Jim’s
eye, perhaps it was that I never had a baby, but I said ‘ No.’ I
was rich then, for I was popular with everybody,—gentlemen like
yourself, sir, came to see me, —and I sold out my business and
bought this yer place, because it was sort of out of the way of
travel, you see, and I brought my baby here.”
With a woman’s intuitive tact and poetry, she had, as she
spoke, slowly shifted her position so as to bring the mute figure of
the ruined man between her and her audience, hiding in the
shadow behind it, as if she offered it as a tacit apology for her
actions. Silent and expressionless, it yet spoke for her ; helpless,
crushed, and smitten with the Divine thunderbolt, it still stretched
an invisible arm around her.
Hidden in the darkness, but still holding his hand, she went
on :


“ It was a long time before I could get the hang of things about
yer, for I was used to company and excitement. I could n’t get
any woman to help me, and a man I dursent trust; but what with
the Indians hereabout, who’d do odd jobs for me, and having
everything sent from the North Fork, Jim and I managed to worry
through. The Doctor would run up from Sacramento once in a
while. He’d ask to see ‘ Miggles’s baby,’ as he called Jim, and
when he’d go away, he’d say, ‘ Higgles ; you ’re a trump,—God
bless you ;’ and it did n’t seem so lonely after that. But the last
time he was here he said, as he opened the door to go, ‘ Do you
know, Higgles, your baby will grow up to be a man yet ‘and an
honour to his mother ; but not here, Higgles, not here 1 ’ And I
thought he went away sad,—and —and—” here Higgles’s voice
and head were somehow both lost completely in the shadow.
“ The folks about here are very kind,” said Higgles, after a
pause, coming a little into the light again. “ The men from the
fork used to hang around here, until they found they was n’t
wanted, and the women are kind, —and don’t call. I was pretty
lonely until I picked up Joaquin in the woods yonder one day,
when he was n’t so high, and taught him to beg for his dinner; and
then thar’s Polly—that’s the magpie—she knows no end of tricks,
and makes it quite sociable of evenings with her talk, and so I
don’t feel like as I was the only living being about the ranch.
And Jim here,” said Higgles, with her old laugh again, and
coming out quite into the firelight, “ Jim —why, boys, you would
admire to see how much he knows for a man like him. Sometimes
I bring him flowers, and he looks at ’em just as natural as if he
knew ’em; and times, when we ’re sitting alone, I read him
those things on the wall. Why, Lord 1 ” said Higgles, with her
frank laugh, “ I’ve read him that whole side of the house this
winter. There never was such a man for reading as Jim.
“ Why,” asked the Judge, “ do you not marry this man to whom
you have devoted your youthful life ? ”
“ Well, you see,” said Higgles, “it would be playing it rather
low down on Jim, to take advantage of his being so helpless. And
then, too, if we were man and wife, now, we’d both know that I
was bound to do what I do now of my own accord.
“ But you are young yet and attractive —”
“ It’s getting late,” said Higgles, gravely, “and you’d better
all turn in. Good-night, boys ” ; and, throwing the blanket over
her head, Higgles laid herself down beside Jim’s chair, her head
pillowed on the low stool that held his feet, and spoke no more.
The fire slowly faded from the hearth; we each sought our
blankets in silence ; and presently there was no sound in the long
room but the pattering of the rain upon the roof, and the heavy
breathing of the sleepers.
It was nearly morning when I awoke from a troubled dream.
The storm had passed, the stars were shining, and through the
shutterless window the full moon, lifting itself over the solemn


pines without, looked into the room. It touched the lonely figure
in the chair with an infinite compassion, and seemed to baptise
with a shining flood the lowly head of the woman whose hair, as
in the sweet old story, bathed the feet of him she loved. It even
lent a kindly poetry to the rugged outline of Yuba Bill, half
reclining on his elbow between them and his passengers, with
savagely patient eyes keeping watch and ward. And then I fell
asleep and only woke at broad day, with Yuba Bill standing over
me, and “All aboard ” ringing in my ears.
Coffee was waiting for us on the table, but Higgles was gone.
We wandered about the house and lingered long after the horses
were harnessed, but she did not return. It was evident that she
wished to avoid a formal leave-taking, and had so left us to depart
as we had come. After we had helped the ladies into the coach,
we returned to the house and solemnly shook hands with the para-
lytic Jim, as solemnly settling him back into position after each
hand-shake. Then we looked for the last time around the long
low room, at the stool where Higgles had sat, and slowly took our
seats in the waiting coach. The whip cracked and we were off!
But as we reached the high-road, Bill’s dexterous hand laid the
six horses back on their haunches, and the stage stopped with a
jerk. For there, on a little eminence beside the road, stood
Higgles, her hair flying, her eyes sparkling, her white handkerchief
waving, and her white teeth flashing a last “ good-by.” We waved
our hats in return. And then Yuba Bill, as if fearful of further
fascination, madly lashed his homes forward, and we sank back in
our seats. We exchanged not a word until we reached the North
Fork, and the stage drew up at the Independence House. Then,
the Judge leading, we walked into the bar-room and took our
places gravely at the bar.
“Are your glasses charged, gentlemen?” said the Judge,
solemnly taking off his white hat.
They were.
“ Well, then, here’s to Miggles, GOD BLESS HBB ! ”
Perhaps He had. Who knows ?
TENNESSEE’S PARTNER.
I do not think that we ever knew his real name. Our ignorance
of it certainly never gave us any social inconvenience, for at
Sandy Bar in 1854 most men were christened anew. Sometimes
these appellatives were derived from some distinctiveness of dress,
as in the case of “ Dungaree Jack” ; or from some peculiarity of
habit, as shown in “ Saieratus Bill,” so called from an undue pro-
portion of that chemical in his daily bread; or from some unlucky
slip, as exhibited in “ The Iron Pirate,” a mild, inoffensive man,
who earned that baleful title by his unfortunate mispronunciation
of the term “ iron pyrites,” Perhaps this may have been the begin-


nincr of a rude heraldry ; but I am constrained to think that it
was because a man’s real name in that day rested solely upon his
own unsupported statement. “ Call yourself Clifford, do you ? ”
said Boston, addressing a timid new-comer with infinite scorn ;
“ hell is full of such Cliffords ! ” He then introduced the unfor-
tunate man, whose name happened to be really Clifford, as “ Jay-
bird Charley,”—an unhallowed inspiration of the moment, that
clung to him ever after.
But to return to Tennessee’s Partner, whom we never knew by
any other than this relative title ; that he had ever existed as a
separate and distinct individuality we only learned later. It seems
that in 1863 he left Poker Flat to go to San Francisco, ostensibly to
procure a wife. He never got any farther than Stockton. At that
place he was attracted by a young person who waited upon the
table at the hotel where he took his meals. One morning he said
something to her which caused her to smile not unkindly, to some-
what coquettishly break a plate of toast over his upturned, serious,
simple face, and to retreat to the kitchen. He followed her, and
emerged a few moments later, covered with more toast and victory.
That day week they were married by a Justice of the Peace, and
returned to Poker Flat. lam aware that something more might be
made of this episode, but I prefer to tell it as it was current at
Sandy Bar, —in the gulches and bar-rooms, —where all sentiment
was modified by a strong sense of humour.
Of their married felicity but little is known, perhaps for the
reason that Tennessee, then living with his partner, one day took
occasion to say something to the bride on his own account, at
w r hich, it is said, she smiled not unkindly and chastely retreated, —
this time as far as Marysville, where Tennessee followed her, and
where they went to housekeeping without the aid of a Justice of
the Peace. Tennessee’s Partner took the loss of his wife simply
and seriously, as was his fashion. But to everybody’s surprise,
when Tennessee one day returned from Marysville, without his
partner’s wife, —she having smiled and retreated with somebody
else, —Tennessee’s Partner was the first man to shake'his hand and
greet him with affection. The boys who had gathered in the
canon to see the shooting were naturally indignant. Their indig-
nation might have found vent in sarcasm but for a certain look in
Tennessee’s Partner’s eye that indicated a lack of humorous ap-
preciation. In fact, he was a grave man, with a steady application
to practical detail which was unpleasant in a difficulty.
Meanwhile a popular feeling against Tennessee had grown up on
the Bar. He was known to be a gambler ; he was suspected to be
a thief. In these suspicions Tennessee’s Partner was equally com-
promised ; his continued intimacy with Tennessee after the affair
above quoted could only be accounted for on the hypothesis of a co-
partnership of crime. At last Tennessee’s guilt became flagrant. One
day he overtook a stranger on his way to Bed Dog. The stranger
afterwards related that Tennessee beguiled the time with interesting


%
anecdote and reminiscence, but illogically concluded the interview
in the following words : “ And now, young man, I’ll trouble you for
your knife, your pistols, and your money. You see your weppings
might get you into trouble at Red Dog, and your money’s a tempta-
tion to the evilly disposed. I think you said your address was San
Francisco. I shall endeavour to call.” It may be stated here
that Tennessee had a fine flow of humour, which no business
preoccupation could wholly subdue.
This exploit was his last. Red Dog and Sandy Bar made com-
mon cause against the highwayman. Tennessee was hunted in
very much the same fashion as his prototype, the grizzly. As the
toils closed around him, he made a desperate dash through the
Bar, emptying his revolver at the crowd before the Arcade Saloon,
and so on up Grizzly Canon ; but at its further extremity he was
stopped by a small man on a grey horse. The men looked at each
other a moment in silence. Both were fearless, both self-possessed
and independent; and both types of a civilization that in the
seventeenth century would have been called heroic, but, in the
nineteenth, simply “ reckless.” “ What have you got there ? —I
call,” said Tennessee, quietly. “ Two bowers and an ace,” said the
stranger, as quietly, showing two revolvers and a bowie-knife.
“ That takes me,” returned Tennessee ; and with this gambler’s
epigram, he threw away his useless pistol, and rode back with his
captor.
It was a warm night. The cool breeze which usually sprang
up with the going down of the sun behind the chaparral- crested
mountain was that evening witheld from Sandy Bar. The little
Canon was stifling with heated resinous odours, and the
decaying drift-wood on the Bar sent forth faint, sickening
exhalations. The feverishness of day, and its fierce passions, still
filled the camp.. Lights moved restlessly along the bank of the
river, striking no answering reflection from its tawny current.
Against the blackness of the pines the windows of the old loft
above the express-office stood out staringly bright; and through
their curtairiless panes the loungers below could see the forms of
those who were even then deciding the fate of Tennessee. And
above all this, etched on the dark firmament, rose the Sierra,
remote and passionless, crowned with remoter passionless stare.
The trial of Tennessee was conducted as fairly as was consistent
with a judge and jury who felt themselves to some extent obliged
to justify, in their verdict, the previous irregularities of arrest and
indictment. The law of Sandy Bar was implacable, but not
vengeful. The excitement and personal feeling of the chase were
over ; with Tennessee safe in their hands they were ready to
listen patiently to any defence, which they were already satisfied
was insufficient. There being no doubt in their own minds, they
were willing to give the prisoner the benefit of any that might
exist. Secure in the hypothesis that he ought to be hanged, on
general principles, they indulged him with more latitude of


defence than *his reckless hardihood seemed to ask. The Judge
appeared to be more anxious than the prisoner, who, otherwise
unconcerned, evidently took a grim pleasure in the responsibility
he had created. “ I don’t take any hand in this yer game,” had
been his invariable, but good-humoured reply to all questions.
The Judge—who was also his captor—for a moment vaguely
regretted that he had not shot him “ on sight,” that morning, but
presently dismissed this human weakness as unworthy of the
judicial mind. Nevertheless, when there was a tap at the door,
and it was said that Tennessee’s Partner was there on behalf of
the prisoner, he was admitted at once without question. Perhaps
the younger mefhbers the jury, to whom the proceedings were
becoming irksomely thoughtful, hailed him as a relief.
For he was not, certainly, an imposing figure. Short and stout,
with a square face, sunburned into a preternatural redness, clad in
a loose duck “ jumper,” and trousers streaked and splashed with
red soil, his aspect under any circumstances would have been
quaint, and was now even ridiculous. As he stooped to deposit at
his feet a heavy carpet-bag he was carrying, it became obvious,
from partially developed legends and inscriptions, that the ma-
terial with which his trousers had been patched had been origin-
ally intended for a less ambitious covering. Yet he advanced with
great gravity, and after having shaken the hand of each person in
the room with laboured cordiality, he wiped his serious, perplexed
face on a red bandanna handkerchief, a shade lighter than his
complexion, laid his powerful hand upon the table to steady him-
self, and thus addressed the Judge :
“ I was passin’ by,” he began, by way of apology, “ and I
thought I’d just step in and see how things was gittin’ on with
Tennessee thar, —my pardner. It’s a hot night. I disremember
any sich weather before on the Bar.”
He paused a moment, but nobody volunteering any other meteo-
rological recollection, he again had recourse to his pocket-hand-
kerchief, and for some moments mopped his face diligently.
“ Have you anything to say in behalf of the prisoner ?” said the
Judge, finally.
“ That’s it,” said Tennessee’s Partner, in a tone of relief. “ I
come yar as Tennessee’s pardner,—knowing him nigh on four year,
off and on, wet and dry, in luck and out o’ luck. His ways ain’t
allers my ways, but thar ain’t any p’ints in that young man, thar
ain’t any liveliness as he’s been up to, as I don’t know. And you
sez to me, sez you,—confidential-like, and between man and man, —
sez you, ‘ Do you know anything in his behalf ?’ and I sez to you,
sez I, —confidential-like, as between man and man, —‘ What should
a man know of his pardner ?’”
“Is this all you have to say?” asked the Judge, impatiently,
feeling, perhaps, that a dangerous sympathy of humour was be-
ginning to humanize the Court.
“ Thet’s so,” continued Tennessee's Partner. “It ain’t for me to


say anything agin’ him. And now, what’s the case? Here’s
Tennessee wants money, wants it bad, and does n’t like to ask it
of his old pardner. Well, what does Tennessee do? He lays for
a stranger, and he fetches that stranger. And you lays for him,
and you fetches him ; and the honours is easy. And I put it to
you, bein’ a far-minded man, and to you, gentlemen, all, as far-
minded men, ef this is n’t so.”
“ Prisoner,” said the Judge, interrupting, “ have you any ques-
tions to ask this man ? ”
“No ! no ! ” continued Tennessee’s Partner, hastily. “ I play
this yer hand alone. To come down to the bed-rock, it’s just this :
Tennessee, thar, has played it pretty rough and expensive-like on
a stranger, and on this yer camp. And now, what’s the fair thing ?
Some would say more ; some would say less. Here’s seventeen
hundred dollars in coarse gold and a watch, —it’s about all my
pile—and call it square ! ” And before a hand could be raised to
prevent him, he had emptied the contents of the carpet-bag upon
the table.
For a moment his life was in jeopardy. One or two men sprang
to their feet, several hands groped for hidden weapons, and a
suggestion to “throw him from the window” was only overridden
by a gesture from the Judge. Tennessee laughed. And appa-
rently oblivious of the excitement, Tennessee’s Partner improved
the opportunity to mop his face again with his handkerchief.
When order was restored, and the man was made to understand,
by the use of forcible figures and rhetoric, that Tennessee’s offence
could not be condoned by money, his face took a more serious and
sanguinary hue, and those who were nearest to him noticed that
his rough hand trembled slightly on the table. He hesitated a
moment as he slowly returned the gold to the carpet-bag, as if he
had not yet entirely caught the elevated sense of justice which
swayed the tribunal, and was perplexed with the belief that he
had not offered enough. Then he turned to the Judge, and
saying, “ This yer is a lone hand, played alone, and without my
pardner,” he bowed to the jury and was about to withdraw, when
the Judge called him back. “If you have anything to say to
Tennessee, you had better say it now.’.’ For the first time that
evening the eyes of the prisoner and his strange advocate met.
Tennessee smiled, showed his white teeth, and, saying, “ Euchred,
old man 1 ” held out his hand. Tennessee’s Partner took it in his
own, and saying, “ I just dropped in as I was passin’ to see how
things was gettin’ on,” let the hand passively fall, and adding
that “it was a warm night,” again mopped his face with his
handkerchief, and without another word withdrew.
The two men never again met each other alive. For the unpa-
ralleled insult of a bribe offered to Judge Lynch—who, whether
bigoted, weak, or narrow, was at least incorruptible—firmly fixed
in the mind of that mythical personage any wavering determina-
tion of Tennessee’s fate; and at the break of day he was marched,
closely guarded, to meet it at the top of Marley’s Hill.


How lie met it, how cool he was, how he refused to say any-
thing, how perfect were the arrangements of the committee, were
all duly reported, with the addition of a warning moral and
example to all future evil-doers, in the Red Dog Clarion, by its
editor, who was present, and to whose vigorous English I cheer-
fully refer the reader. But the beauty of that midsummer
morning, the blessed amity of earth and air and sky, the awakened
life of the free woods and hills, the joyous renewal and promise of
Nature, and, above all, the infinite Serenity that thrilled through
each, was not reported, as not being a part of the social lesson.
And yet, when the weak and foolish deed was done, and a life,
with its possibilities and responsibilities, had passed out of the mis-
shapen thing that dangled between earth and sky, the birds sang,
the flowers bloomed, the sun shone, as cheerily as before ; and
possibly the Red Dog Clarion was right.
Tennessee’s Partner was not in the group that surrounded the
ominous tree. But as they turned to disperse, attention was drawn
to the singular appearance of a motionless donkey-cart halted at
the side of the road. As they approached, they at once recognized
the venerable “ Jenny” and the two-wheeled cart as the property
of Tennessee’s Partner,—used by him in carrying dirt from his
claim ; and a few paces distant the owner of the equipage himself,
sitting under a buckeye-tree, wiping the perspiration from his
glowing face. In answer to an inquiry, he said he had come for
the body of the “ diseased,” “ if it was all the same to the com-
mittee.” He didn’t wish to “ hurry anything ” ; he could “ wait.”
He was not working that day ; and when the gentlemen were
done with the “ diseased,” he would take him. “Ef thar is any
present,” he added, in his simple, serious way, “ as would care to
jine in the fun’l, they kin come.” Perhaps it was from a sense of
humour, which I have already intimated was a feature of Bandy
Bar, —perhaps it was from something even better than that; but
two-thirds of the loungers accepted the invitation at once.
It was noon when the body of Tennessee was delivered into
the hands of his partner. As the cart drew up to the fatal tree,
we noticed that it contained a rough, oblong box,- apparently
made from a section of sluicing,—and half filled with bark and
the tassels of pine. The cart was further decorated with slips of
willow, and made fragrant with buckeye-blossoms. When the
body was deposited in the box, Tennessee’s Partner drew over it a
piece of tarred canvas, and gravely mounting the narrow seat in
front, with his feet upon the shafts, urged the little donkey
forward. The equipage moved slowly on, at that decorous
pace which was habitual with “ Jenny ” even under less solemn
circumstances. The men half curiously, half jestingly, but all
good-humouredly—strolled along beside the car ; some in advance,
some a little in the rear of the homely catafalque. But, whether
from the narrowing of the road or some present sense of decorum,
as the cart passed on, the company fell to the rear in couples,


keeping step, and otherwise assuming the external show of a formal
procession. Jack Folinsbee, who had at the outset played a fimeral
march in dumb show upon an imaginary trombone, desisted, from
a lack of sympathy and appreciation, —not having, perhaps, your
true humourist’s capacity to be content with the enjoyment of
his own fun.
The way led through Grizzly Canon, —by this time clothed in
funereal drapery and shadows. The redwoods, burying their
moccasoned feet in the red soil, stood in Indian-file along' the
track, trailing an uncouth benediction from their bending boughs
upon the passing bier. A hare, surprised into helpless inactivity,
sat upright and pulsating in the ferns by the roadside, as the
cortege went by. Squirrels hastened to gain a secure outlook from
higher boughs ; and the blue-jays, spreading their wings, fluttered
before them like outriders, until the outskirts of Sandy Bar were
reached, and the solitary cabin of Tennessee’s Partner.
Viewed under more favourable circumstances, it would not
have been a cheerful place. The unpicturesque site, the rude and
unlovely outlines, the unsavoury details, which distinguish the nest
building of the California miner, were all here, with the dreariness
of decay superadded. A few paces from the cabin there was a rough
enclosure, which in the brief days of Tennessee’s Partner’s matri-
monial felicity had been used as a garden, but was now overgrown
with fern. As we approached it we were surprised to find that
what we had 'taken for a recent attempt at cultivation was the
broken soil about an open grave.
The cart was halted before the enclosure ; and rejecting the
offers of assistance with the Isame air of simple self-reliance he
had displayed throughout, Tennessee’s Partner lifted the rough
coffin on his back, and deposited it, unaided, within the shallow
grave. He then nailed down the board which served as a lid ;
and mounting the little mound of earth beside it, took off his hat,
and slowly mopped his face with his handkerchief. This the crowd
felt was a preliminary to speech ; and they disposed themselves
variously on stumps and boulders and sat expectant.
“ When a man,” began Tennessee’s Partner, slowly, “ has been
running free all day, what’s the natural thing for him to do 1
Why to come home. And if he ain’t in a condition to go home,
what can his best friend do ! Why, bring him home! And here’s
Tennessee has been running free, and we brings him home from his
wandering.” He paused, and picked up a fragment of quartz,
rubbed it thoughtfully on his sleeve, and went on : “It ain't the
first time that I’ve packed him on my back, as you see’d me now.
It ain’t the first time that I brought him to this yer cabin when
he could nVhclp himself ; it ain’t the first time that I and ' Jinny ’
have waitM for him on yon hill, and picked him up and so
fetched him home, when he could n’t speak, and did n’t know me.
And now that it’s the last time, why —” he paused, and rubbed
the quartz gently on his sleeve - “ you see it ’s sort of rough on


his pardner. And now, gentlemen,” he added, abruptly picking
up his long-handled shovel, “ the fun’l’s over ; and my thanks,
and Tennessee’s thanks, to you for your trouble.”
Resisting any proffers of assistance, he began to fill in the grave,
turning his back upon the crowd, that after a few moments’ hesi-
tation gradually withdrew. As they crossed the little ridge that
hid Sandy Bar from view, some, looking back, thought they could
see Tennessee’s Partner, his work done, sitting upon the grave, his
shovel between his knees, and his face buried in his red bandanna
handkerchief. But it was argued by others that you could n’t tell
his face from his handkerchief at that distance ; and this point
remained undecided.
In the reaction that followed the feverish excitement of that
day, Tennessee’s Partner was not forgotten. A secret investiga-
tion had cleared him of any complicity in Tennessee’s guilt, and
left only a suspicion of his general sanity. Sandy Bar made a
point of calling on him, and proffering various uncouth, but well-
meant kindnesses. But from that day his rude health and great
strength seemed visibly to decline ; and wdien the rainy season
fairly set in, and the tiny grass-blades were beginning to peep
from the rocky mound above Tennessee’s grave he took to his bed.
One night when the pines beside the cabin were swaying in the
storm, and trailing their slender fingers over the roof, and the
roar and rush of the swollen river were heard below, Ten-
nessee’s Partner lifted his head from the pillow, saying, “ It is
time to go for Tennessee ; I must put ‘ Jinny’ in the cartand
would have risen from his bed but fpr the restraint of his atten-
dant. Struggling, he still pursued his singular fancy : “ There,
now, steady, ‘ Jinny,’—steady, old girl. How dark it is ! Look
out for the nits, —and look out for him, too, old gal. Sometimes,
you know, when he’s blind drunk, he drops down right in the trail.
Keep on straight up to the pine on the top of the hill. Thar—l
told you so ! —thar he is, —coming this way, too, —all by himself,
sober, and his face a-shining. Tennessee 1 Pardner ! ”
And so they met.
THE IDYL OF RED GULCH.
Sandy was very drunk. He was lying under an azalea-bush, in
pretty much the same attitude in which he had fallen some hours
before. How long he had been lying there he could not tell, and
didn’t care ; how long he should lie there was a matter equally
indefinite and uuconsidered. A tranquil philosophy, born of his
physical condition, suffused and saturated his moral being.
The spectacle of a drunken man, and of this drunUfen man in
particular, was not, I grieve to say, of sufficient novelty in Red
Gulch to attract attention. Earlier in the day some local satirist
had erected a temporary tombstone at Sandy’s head, bearing the
inscription, “ Effects of McCorkle’s whiskey,—kills at forty rods,”


with a hand pointing to McCorkle’s saloon. But this, I imagine,
was, like most local satire, personal ; and was a rejection upon
the unfairness of the process rather than a commentary upon the
impropriety of the result. With this facetious exception, Sandy
had been undisturbed. A wandering mule, released from his
pack, had cropped the scant herbage beside him, and sniffed
curiously at the prostrate man ; a vagabond dog, -with that deep
sympathy which the species have for drunken men, had licked- his
dusty boots, and curled himself up at his feet, and lay there,
blinking one eye in the sunlight, with a simulation of dissipation
that was ingenious and dog-like in its implied flattery of the un-
conscious man beside him.
Meanwhile the shadows of the pine-trees had slowly swung
around until they crossed the road, and their trunks barred the
open meadow with gigantic parallels of black and yellow. Little
puffs of red dust, lifted by the plunging hoofs of passing teams,
dispersed in a grimy shower upon the recumbent man. The sun
sank lower and lower ; and still Sandy stirred not. And then the
repose of this philosopher was disturbed, as other philosophers
have been, by the intrusion of an unphilosophical sex.
“ Miss Mary,” as she was known to the little flock that she had
just dismissed from the log school-house beyond the pines, was
taking her afternoon walk. Observing an unusually fine cluster
of blossoms on the azalea bush opposite, she crossed the road to
pluck it, —picking her way through the red dust, not without cer-
tain fierce little shivers of disgust, and some feline circumlocution.
And then she came suddenly upon Sandy !
Of course she uttered the little staccato cry of her sex. But
when she had paid that tribute to her physical weakness she
became overbold, and halted for a moment, —at least six feet from
this prostrate monster, —with her white skirts gathered in her hand,
ready for flight. But neither sound nor motion came from the
bush. With one little foot she then overturned the satirical head-
board, and muttered “ Beasts !” —an epithet which probably at
that moment, conveniently classified in her mind the entire male
population of Bed Gulch. For Miss Mary, being possessed of
certain rigid notions of her own, had not, perhaps, properly ap-
preciated the demonstrative gallantry for which the Californian
has been so justly celebrated by his brother Californians, and had,
as a new-comer, perhaps, fairly earned the reputation of being
“ stuck up.”
As she stood there she noticed, also, that the slant sunbeams were
heating Sandy’s head to what she judged to be an unhealthy
temperature, and that his hat was lying uselessly at his side. To
pick it up and to place it over his face was a work requiring some
courage, particularly as his eyes were open. Yet she did it and
made good her retreat. But she was somewhat concerned, on
looking back, to see that the hat was removed, and that Sandy was
sitting up and saying something.


The truth was, that in the calm depths of Sandy’s mind he was
satisfied that the rays of the sun were beneficial and healthful;
that from childhood he had objected to lying down in a hat; that
no people but condemned fools past redemption ever wore hats;
and that his right to dispense with them when he pleased was
inalienable. This was the statement of his inner conciousness.
Unfortunately, its outward expression was vague, being limited to a
repetition of the following formula —“Su’shine all ri’! Wasser
maar, eh ? Wass up, su’shine ? ”
Miss Mary stopped, and taking fresh courage from her vantage
of distance, asked him if there was anything that he wanted.
“Wass up? Wasser maar? ” continued Sandy, in a very high
key.
“ Get up, you horrid man ! ” said Miss Mary, now thoroughly
incensed ; “ get up, and go home.”
Sandy staggered to his feet. He was six feet high, and Miss
Mary trembled. He started forward a few paces and then stopped.
“ Wass I go home for ? ” he suddenly asked, with great gravity.
“ Gcyind take a bath,” replied Miss Mary, eyeing his grimy
great disfavour.
To her infinite dismay, Sandy suddenly pulled off his coat and
vest, threw them on the ground, kicked off his boots, and,
plunging wildly forward, darted headlong over the hill, in the
direction of the river.
“Goodness heavens! —the man will be drowned 1 ” said Miss
Mary ; and then, with feminine inconsistency, she ran back to the
schoolhouse, and locked herself in.
That night, while seated at supper with her hostess, the black-
smith’s wife, it came to Miss Mary to ask, demurely, if her husband
ever got drunk. “ Abner,” responded Mrs. Stidger, reflectively,
“ let’s see : Abner has n’t been tight since last ’lection.” Miss
Mary would have liked to ask if he preferred lying in the sun on
these occasions, and if a cold bath would have hurt him ; but
this would have involved an explanation, which she did not then
care to give. So she contented herself with opening her grey eyes
widely at the red-checked Mrs. itidger—a fine specimen of South-
western efflorescence, and then dismissed the subject altogether. The
next day she wrote to her dearest friend, in Boston ; “ I think I find
the intoxicated portion of this community the least objectionable,
I refer, my dear, to the men, of course. Ido not know anything
that could make the women tolerable.”
In less than a week Miss Mary had forgotten this episode,
except that her afternoon walks took thereafter, almost un-
consciously, another direction. She noticed, however, that every
morning a fresh cluster of azalea-blossoms appeared among the
flowers on her desk. This was not strange, as her little flock
were aware of her fondness for flowers and invariably kept her
desk bright with anemones, syringas, and lupines; but on
questioning them,‘they, one and all, professed ignorance of th«


azaleas. A few days later Master Johnny Stidger, whose desk
was nearest to the window, was suddenly taken with spasms of
apparently gratuitous laughter, that threatened the discipline of
the school. All that Miss Mary could get from him was, that
some one had been “ looking in the winder.” Irate and in-
dignant, she sallied from her hive to do battle with the intruder.
As she turned the corner of the school-house she came plump,upon
the quondam drunkard, —now perfectly sober, and inexpressibly
sheepish and guilty-looking.
These facts Miss Mary was not slow to take a feminine advantage
of in her present humour. But it was somewhat confusing to
observe, also, that the beast, despite some faint signs of past dissipa-
tion, was amiable looking,—in fact a kind of blonde Samson,
whose corn-coloured, silken beard apparently had never yet known
the touch of barber’s razor or Delilah’s shears. So that the
cutting speech which quivered on her ready tongue died upon her
lips, and she contented herself with receiving his stammering
apology with supercilious eyelids and the gathered skirts of un-
contamination. When she re-entered the schoolroom, eyes
fell upon the azaleas with a new sense of revelation. And then
she laughed, and the little people all laughed, and they were all
unconsciously very happy.
It was on a hot day—and not long after this —that two short-
legged boys came to grief on the threshold of the school with a
pail of water, which they had laboriously brought from the spring,
and that Miss Mary compassionately seized the pail, and started for
the spring herself. At the foot of the hill a shadow crossed her path,
and a blue-shirted arm dexterously, but gently relieved her of her
burden. Miss Mary was both embarrassed and angry. “If you
carried more of that for yourself,” she said, spitefully, to the blue
arm, without deigning to raise her lashes to its owner, “ you’d do
better.” In the submissive silence that followed she regretted her
speech, and thanked him so sweetly at the door that he stumbled.
Which caused the children to laugh again,—a laugh in which Miss
Mary joined, until the colour came faintly into her pale cheek. The
next day a barrel was mysterio«sly placed beside the door and as
mysteriously filled with fresh spring-water every morning.
Nor was this superior young person without other quiet atten-
tions. “ Profane Bill,” driver of the Hlumgullion Stage, widely
known in the newspapers for his “ gallantry ” in invariably
offering the box-seat to the fair-sex, had excepted Miss Mary from
this attention, on the ground that he had a habit of “ cussin’ on up
grades,” and gave her half the coach to herself. Jack Hamlin,
a gambler, having once silently ridden with her in the same coach,
afterward threw a decanter at the head of a confederate for men-
tioning her name in a bar room. The over-dressed mother of a
pupil whose paternity was doubtful had often lingered near this
astute Vestal’s temple, never daring to enter its sacred precincts,
but content to worship the priestess from afar.


With such unconscious intervals the monotonous procession of
blue skies, glittering sunshine, brief twilights, and starlit nights
passed over Red Gulch. Miss Mary grew fond of walking in the
sedate and proper woods. Perhaps she believed, with Mrs
Stidger, that the balsamic odours of the firs “ did her chest good,”
for certainly her slight cough was less frequent and her step was
firmerperhaps she had learned the unending lessen which the
patient pines are never weaiy of repeating to heedful or listless
ears. And so, one day, she planned a picnic on Buckeye Hill, and
took the children with her. Away from the dusty road, the
straggling shanties, the yellow ditches, the clamour of restless
engines, the cheap finery of shopwindows, the deeper glitter of,
paint and coloured glass, and the thin veneering which barbarism
takes upon itself in such localities, —what infinite relief was
theirs ! The last heap of ragged rock and clay passed, the last
unsightly chasm crossed, —how the waiting woods opened their
long files to receive them I How the children —perhaps because
they had not yet grown quite away from the breast of the
bounteous Mother —threw themselves face downward on her
brown bosom with uncouth caresses, filling the air with their
laughter; and how Miss Mary herself —felinely fastidious and
intrenched as she was in the purity of spotless skirts, collar, and
cuffs —forgot all, and ran like a crested quail at the head of her
brood, until, romping, laughing, and panting, with a loosened
braid of brown hair, a hat hanging by a knotted ribbon from
her throat, she came suddenly and violently, in the heart of the
forest, upon —the luckless Sandy !
The explanations, apologies, and not over wise conversation
that ensued, need not be indicated here. It would seem, however,
that Miss Maiy had already established some acquaintance with
this ex-drunkard. Enough that he was soon accepted as one of
the party ; that the children, with that quick intelligence which
Providence gives the helpless, recognised a friend, and played
with his blonde beard and long silken moustache, and took other
liberties, —as the helpless are apt to do. And when he had built
a fire against a tree, and had shown them other mysteries of
wood-craft, their admiration knew no bounds. At the close of
two such foolish, idle, happy hours he found himself lying at
the feet of the schoolmistress, gazing dreamily in her face, as
she sat upon the sloping hillside, weaving wreaths of laurel and
syringa, in very much the same attitude as he had lain when first
they met. Nor was the similitude greatly forced. The weakness
of an easy, sensuous nature, that had found a dreamy exaltation
in liquor, it is to be feared was now finding an equal intoxication
in love.
I think that Sandy was dimly conscious of this himself. I
know that he longed to be doing something,—slaying a grizzly,
scalping a savage, or sacrificing himself in some way for the sake
of this sallow-faced, gray-eyed schoolmistress. As I should like to


present him in a heroic attitude, I stay my hand with great diffi-
culty at this moment, being only withheld from introducing such
an episode by a strong conviction that it does not usually occur at
such times. And 1 trust that my fairest reader, who remembers
that, in a real crisis, it is always some uninteresting stranger or
unromantic policeman, and not Adolphus, who rescues, will forgive
the omission.
So they sat there, undisturbed, —the woodpeckers chattering
overhead, and the voices of the children coming pleasantly from
the hollow below. What they said matters little. What they
thought—which might have been interesting—did not transpire.
The woodpeckers only learned how Miss Mary was an orphan ;
how she left her uncle’s house, to come to California, for the sake
of health and independence ; how Sandy was an orphan, too ;
how he came to California for excitement; how he had lived a
wild life, and how he was trying to reform ; and other details,
which, from a woodpecker’s view-point, undoubtedly must have
seemed stupid, and a waste of time. But even in such trifles was
the afternoon spent; and when the children were again gathered,
and Sandy, with a delicacy which the schoolmistress well under-
stood, took leave of them quietly at the outskirts of the settlement,
it had seemed the shortest day of her weary life.
As the long, dry summer withered to its roots, the school term of
Red Gulch—to use a local euphuism—“ dried up” also. In another
day Miss Mary would be free ; and for a season, at least, Red
Gulch would know her no more. She was seated alone in the
school-house, her cheek resting on her hand, her eyes half closed
in one of those day-dreams in which Miss Mary—l fear, to the
danger of school discipline—was lately in the habit of indulging.
Her lap was full of mosses, ferns, and other woodland memories.
She was so pre-occupied with these and her own thoughts that a
gentle tapping at the door passed unheard, or translated itself into
the remembrance of far-off woodpeckers. When at last it asserted
itself more distinctly, she started up with a flushed cheek and
opened the door. On the threshold stood a woman, the self-asser-
tion and audacity of whose dress were in singular contrast to her
timid irresolute bearing.
Miss Mary recognised at a glance the dubious mother of her
anonymous pupil. Perhaps she was disappointed, perhaps she was
only fastidious ; but as she coldly invited her to enter, she half
unconsciously settled her white cuffs and collar, and gathered
closer her own chaste skirts. It was, perhaps, for this reason that the
embarrassed stranger, after a moment’s hesitation, left her gor-
geous parasol open and sticking in the dust beside the door, and
then sat down at the farther end of a long bench. Her voice was
husky as she began :
“ I heerd tell that you were going down to the Bay to-morrow,
and I could n’t let you go until I came to thank you for your kind-
ness to my Tommy.”


Tommy, Miss Mary said, was a good boy, and deserved more
than the poor attention she could give him.
“ Thank you, Miss ; thank ye I” cried the stranger, brightening
even through the colour which Red Gulch knew facetiously as her
“ war paint,” and striving, in her embarrassment, to drag the long
bench nearer the schoolmistress. “ I thank you, Miss, for that!
and if I am his mother there ain’t a sweeter, dearer, better boy
lives than him. And if I ain’t much as says it, there ain’t a
sweeter, dearer, angeler teacher lives than he’s got.”
Miss Mary, sitting primly behind her desk, with a ruler over her
shoulder, opened her gray eyes widely at this, but said nothing.
“ It ain’t for you to be complimented by the like of me, I
know, she went on hurriedly. “It ain’t for me to be coming
here in broad day, to do it, either ; but I come to ask a favour ;
not for me, Miss, —not for me, but for the darling boy.”
Encouraged by a look in the young schoolmistress’s eye, and
putting her lilac-gloved hands together, the fingers downward, be-
tween her knees, she went on, in a low voice :
“You see, Miss, there is no one the boy has any claim on but me,
and I ain’t the proper person to bring him up. I thought, some,
last year, of sending him away to ’Frisco to school, but when they
talked of bi’inging a schoolma’am here, I waited till I saw you,
and then I knew it was all right, and I could keep my boy a little
longer. And, 0, Miss, he loves you so much ; and if you could
hear him talk about you, in his pretty way, and if he could ask
you what I ask you now, you couldn’t refuse him.”
“It is natural,” she went on, rapidly, in a voice that trembled
strangely between pride and humility,—“ it’s natural that he
should take to you, miss, for his father, when I first knew him,
was a gentleman,—and the boy must forget me, sooner or later, —
and so I ain’t a’ goin’ to cry about that. For I come to ask you to
take my Tommy,—God bless him for the bestest, sweetest boy
that lives, —to—to—take him with you.”
She had risen and caught the young girl’s hand in her own,
and had fallen on her knees beside her.
“ I’ve money plenty, and it’s all yours and his. Put him in
some good school, where you can go and see him, and help him to
—to —to forget his mother. Do with him what you like. The
worst you can do will be kindness to what he will learn with me.
Only take him out of this wicked life, this cruel place, this home
of shame and sorrow. You will; I know you will, —won’t you?
You will, —you must not, you cannot say no ! You will make him
as pure, as gentle as yourself; and when he has grown up, you
will tell him his father’s name, —the name that hasn’t passed my
lips for years,—the name of Alexander Morton, whom they call
here Sandy ! Miss Mary ?—do not take your hand away I Miss
Mary, speak to me ! You will take my boy ? Do not put your
face from me. I know it ought not to look on such as me. Miss
Mary I —my God, be merciful I —she is leaving me I ”


Miss Mary had risen, and, in the gathering twilight, had felt
her way to the open window. She stood there, leaning against
the casement, her eyes fixed on the last rosy tints that were fading
from the western sky. There was still some of its light on her
pure young forehead, on her white collar, on her clasped white
hands, but all fading slowly away. The suppliant had dragged
herself, still on her knees, beside her.
“ I know it takes time to consider. I will wait here all night;
but I cannot go until you speak. Do not deny me now. You will!
—I see it in your sweet face, —such a face as I have seen in
my dreams. I see it in your eyes, Miss Maiy!—you will take
my boy ! ”
The last red beam crept higher, suffused Miss Mary’s eyes with
something of its glory, flickered, and faded, and went out. The
sun had set on Red Gulch. In the twilight and silence Miss Mary’s
voice sounded pleasantly.
“ I will take the boy. Send him to me to-night.”
The happy mother raised the hem of Miss Mary’s skirts to her
lips. She would have buried her hot face in its virgin folds, but
she dared not. She rose to her feet.
“ Does —this man—know of your intention ? ” asked Miss Mary,
suddenly.
“ No, nor cares. He has never even seen the child to know it.”
“Go to him at once, —to-night,—now ! Tell him what you
have done. Tell him I have taken his child, and tell him—he
must never see—see —the child again. Wherever it may be, he
must notcome; wherever I may take it he must not follow! There,
go now, please,—l’m weary, and—have much yet to do ! ”
They walked together to the door. On the threshold the woman
turned.
“Good night.”
She would have fallen at Miss Mary’s feet. But at the same
moment the young girl reached out her arms, caught the sinful
woman to her own pure breast for one brief moment, and then
closed and locked the door.
It was -with a sudden sense of great responsibility that Profane
Bill took the reins of the Slumgullion Stage the next morning, for
the schoolmistress w r as one of his passengers. As he entered the
high-road, in obedience to a pleasant voice from the “ inside,” he
suddenly reigned up his horses and respectfully waited, as
“ Tommy ” hopped out at the command of Miss Mary.
“ Not that bush, Tommy,—the next.”
Tommy whipped out his new pocket-knife, and, cutting a branch
from a tall azalea-bush, returned with it to Miss Maiy.
“ All right now ? ”
“ All right.”
And the stage-door closed on the Idyl of Red Gulch.


BROWN OF CALAVERAS.
A subdued tone of conversation, and the absence of cigar-smoke
and boot-heels at the windows of the Wingdam stage-coach, made
it evident that one of the inside passengers was a woman. A dis-
position on the part of loungers at the stations to congregate before
the window, and some concern in regard to the appearance of coats,
hats, and collars, further indicated that she was lovely. All of
which Mr. Jack Hamlin, on the box-seat, noted with the smile of
cynical philosophy. Not that he depreciated the sex, but that he
recognised therein a deceitful element, the pursuit of which some-
times drew mankind away from the equally uncertain blandish-
ments of poker,—of which it may be remarked that Mr. Hamlin
was a professional exponent.
So that, when he placed his narrow boot on the wheel and
leaped down, he did not even glance at the window from which a
green veil was fluttering, but lounged up and down with that
listless and grave indifference of his class, which was, perhaps, the
next thing to good-breeding. With his closely-buttoned figure
and self-contained air he was a marked contrast to the other pas-
sengers, with their feverish restlessness, and boisterous emotion ;
and even Bill Masters, a graduate of Harvard, with his slovenly
dress, his overflowing vitality, his intense appreciation of lawless-
ness and barbarism, and his mouth filled with crackers and cheese,
I fear cut but an unromantic figure beside this lonely calculator of
chances, with his pale Greek face and Homeric gravity.
The driver‘called “‘All aboard !” and Mr. Hamlin returned to
the coach. His foot was upon the wheel, and his face raised to
the level of the open window, when, at the same moment, what
appeared to him to be the finest eyes in the world suddenly met his.
He quietly dropped down again, addressed a few words to one of
the inside passengers, effected an exchange of seats, and as quietly
took his place inside. Mr. Hamlin never allowed his philosophy
to interfere with decisive and prompt action.
I fear that this irruption of Jack cast some restraint upon the
other passengers,—particularly those who were making themselves
most agreeable to the lady. One of them leaned forward, and
apparently conveyed to her information regarding Mr. Hamlin’s
profession in a single epithet. Whether Mr. Hamlin heard it, or
whether he recognised in the informant a distinguished jurist,
from whom, but a few evenings before, he had won several
thousand dollars, I cannot say. His colourless face betrayed no
sign ; his black eyes, quietly observant, glanced indifferently past
the legal gentleman, and rested on the much more pleasing features
of his neighbour. An Indian stoicism —said to be an inheritance
from his maternal ancestor—stood him in good service, until the
rolling wheels rattled upon the river gravel at Scott’s Ferry, and
the stage drew up at the International Hotel for dinner. The


legal gentleman and a member of Congress leaped out, and stood
ready to assist the descending goddess, while Colonel Starbottle,
of Siskiyou, took charge of her parasol and shawl. In this multi-
plicity of attention there was a momentary confusion and delay.
Jack Hamlin quietly opened the opposite door of the coach, took
the lady’s hand, —with that decision and positiveness which a
hesitating and undecided sex know how to admire, —and in an
instant had dexterously and gracefully swung her to the grotmd,
and again lifted her to the platform. An audible chuckle on the
box, I fear, came from that other cynic, “ Yuba Bill,” the driver.
“ Look keerfully arter that baggage, Kernel,” said the express-
man, with affected concern, as he looked after Colonel Starbottle,
gloomily bringing up the rear of the triumphant procession to
the waiting-room.
Mr. Hamlin did not stay for dinner. His horse was already
saddled, and awaiting him. He dashed over the ford, up the
gravelly hill, and out into the dusty perspective of the Wingdam
road, like one leaving an unpleasant fancy behind him. The
inmates of dusty cabins by the roadside shaded their eyes with
their hands, and looked after him, recognising the man by his
horse, and speculating what “ was up with Comanche Jack.” Yet
much of this interest centred in the horse, in a community where
the time made by “ French Pete’s ” mare, in his run from the
Sheriff of Calaveras, eclipsed all concern in the ultimate fate of
that worthy.
The sweating flanks of his gray at length recalled him to him-
self. He checked his speed, and, turning into a by-road, some-
times used as a cut-off, trotted leisurely along, the reins hanging
listlessly from his fingers. As he rode on, the character of the
landscape changed, and became more pastoral. Openings in
groves of pine and sycamore disclosed some rude attempts at culti-
vation, —a flowering vine trailed over the porch of one cabin, and
a woman rocked her cradled babe, under the roses of another.
A little farther on Mr. Hamlin came upon some barelegged
children, wading in the willowy creek, and so wrought upon them
with a badinage peculiar to himself, that they were emboldened
to climb up his horse’s legs and over his saddle, until he was fain
to develop an exaggerated ferocity of demeanour, and to escape,
leaving behind some kisses and coin. And then, advancing deeper
into the woods, where all signs of habitation failed, he began to
sing,—uplifting a tenor so singularly sweet, and shaded by a
pathos so subduing and tender, that I wot the robins and linnets
stopped to listen. Mr. Hamlin’s voice was not cultivated ; the
subject of his song was some sentimental lunacy, borrowed from
the negro minstrels ; but there thrilled through all some occult
quality of tone and expression that was unspeakably touching.
Indeed, it was a wonderful sight to see this sentimental blackleg,
with a pack of cards in his pocket and a revolver at his back,
sending his voice before him through the dim woods with a plaint


about his “ Nelly’s grave,” in a way that overflowed the eyes of
the listener. A sparrow-hawk, fresh from his sixth victim pos-
sibly recognising in Mr. Hamlin a kindred spirit, stared at him in
surprise, and was fain to confess the superiority of man. With a
superior predatory capacity, Tie could n’t sing.
But Mr. Hamlin presently found himself again on the high-road,
and at his former pace. Ditches and banks of gravel, denuded
hill-sides, stumps, and decayed trunks of trees, took the place of
woodland and ravine, and indicated his approach to civilization.
Then a church steeple came in sight, and he knew that he had
reached home. In a few moments he was clattering down the
single narrow street, that lost itself in a chaotic ruin of races,
ditches, and tailings at the foot of the hill, and dismounted before
the gilded windows of the “ Magnolia ” saloon. Passing through
the long bar-room, he pushed open a green baize door, entered
a dark passage, opened another door with a pass-key, and
found himself in a dimly lighted room, whose furniture,
though elegant and costly for the locality, showed signs of
abuse. The inlaid centre table was over-laid with stained disks
that were not contemplated in the original design. The em-
broidered arm-chairs were discoloured, and the green velvet lounge,
on which Mr. Hamlin threw himself, was soiled at the foot with
the red soil of Wingdam.
• Mr. Hamlin did not sing in his cage. He lay still, looking at a
highly coloured painting above him, representing a young creature
of opulent charms. It occurred to him then, for the first time,
that he had never seen exactly that kind of a woman, and that, if
he should, he would not, probably, fall in love with her. Perhaps
he was thinking of another style of beauty. But just then some
one knocked at the door. Without rising, he pulled a cord that
apparently shot back a bolt, for the door swung open, and a man
entered.
The new-comer was broad-shouldered and robust, —a vigour not
borne out in the face, which, though handsome, was singularly
weak, and disfigured by dissipation. He appeared to be also under
the influence of liquor, for he started on seeing Mr. Hamlin, and
said, “ I thought Kate was here,” stammered, and seemed con-
fused and embarrassed.
Mr. Hamlin smiled the smile which he had before worn on the
Wingdam coach, and sat up, quite refreshed and ready for
business.
“ You did n’t come up on the stage,” continued the new-comer,
“did you ?”
“ No,” replied Hamlin ; “ I left it at Scott’s Ferry. It is n’t due
for half an hour yet. But how’s luck, Brown ?”
“ D bad,” said Brown, his face suddenly assuming an ex-
pression of weak despair ; “ I’m cleaned out again. Jack,” he
continued, in a whining tone, that formed a pitiable contrast to
hia bulky figure, “ can’t you help me with a hundred till to-mor-


row’s clean np 7 You see I ’ve got to send money home to the old
woman, and—you’ve won twenty times that amount from me.”
The conclusion was, perhaps, not entirely logical, but Jack
overlooked it, and handed the sum to his visitor. “ The old woman
business is about played out, Brown,” he added, by way of com-
mentary ; “ why don’t you say you want to buck agin faro ? You
know you ain’t married 1”
“ Fact, sir,” said Brown, with sudden gravity, as if the mere
contact of the gold with the palm of the hand had imparted some
dignity to his frame. “ I’ve got a wife —a d good one, too, if
Ido say it—in the States. It’s three year since I’ve seen her,
and a year since I’ve writ to her. When things is about straight,
and we get down to the lead, I’m going to send for her.”
“ And Kate ?” queried Mr. Hamlin, with his previous smile.
Mr. Brown, of Calaveras, essayed an archness of glance, to
cover his confusion, which his weak face and whiskey-muddled
intellect but poorly carried out, and said, —
“ D it, Jack, a man must have a little liberty, you know.
But come, what do you say to a little game ? Give us a show to
double this hundred.”
Jack Hamlin looked curiously at his fatuous friend. Perhaps
he knew that the man was predestined to lose the money, and
preferred that it should flow back into his own coffers rather than
any other. He nodded his head, and drew his chair toward the
the table. At the same moment there came a rap upon the door.
“ It’s Kate,” said Mr. Brown.
Mr. Hamlin shot back the bolt, and the door opened. But, for
the first time in his life, he staggered to his feet, utterly unnerved
and abashed, and for the first time in his life the hot blood crimsoned
his colourless cheeks to his forehead. For before him stood the
lady he had lifted from the Wingdam coach, whom Brown —
dropping his cards with a hysterical laugh—greeted as
“ My old woman, by thunder !”
They say that Mrs. Brown burst into tears, and reproaches of
her husband. I saw her, in 1857, at Marysville, and disbelieve
the story. And the Wingdam Chronicle, of the next week, under
the head of “ Touching Reunion,” said : “ One of those beautiful
and touching incidents, peculiar to California life, occurred last
week in our city. The wife of one of Wingdam’s eminent pioneers,
tired of the effete civilisation of the East and its inhospitable cli-
mate, join her noble husband upon these golden shores.
Without informing him of her intention, she undertook the long
journey, and arrived last week. The joy of the husband may be
easier imagined than described. The meeting is said to have been
indescribably affecting. We trust her example may be followed.”
Whether owing to Mrs. Brown’s influence, or to some more suc-
cessful speculations, Mr. Brown’s financial fortune from that day
steadily improved. He bought out his partners in the “ Nip and
Tuck” lead, with money which was said to have been won at


poker, a week or two after his wife's arrival, but which rumour,
adopting Mrs. Brown's theory that Brown had forsworn the
gaming table declared to have been furnished by Mr. Jack Hamlin.
He built and furnished the “Wingdam House,” which pretty
Mrs. Brown’s great popularity kept overflowing with guests. He
was elected to the Assembly, and gave largess to churches. A
street in Wingdam was named in his honour.
Yet it was noted that in proportion as he waxed wealthy and
fortunate, he grew pale, thin, and anxious. As his wife’s popu-
larity increased, he became fretful and impatient. The most
uxorious of husbands, he was absurdly jealous. If he did not in-
terfere with his wife’s social liberty, it was because it was malici-
ously whispered that his first and only attempt was met by an out-
burst from Mrs/Brown that terrified him into silence. Much of this
kind of gossip came from those of her own sex whom she had sup-
planted in the chivalrous attentions of Wingdam, which, like most
popular chivalry, was devoted to an admiration of power, whether of
masculine force or feminine beauty. It should be remembered, too,
in her extenuation, that, since her arrival, she had been the un-
conscious priestess of a mythological worship, perhaps not more
ennobling to her womanhood than that which distinguished an
older Greek democracy. I think that Brown was dimly con-
scious of this. But his only confidant was Jack Hamlin, whose
infelix reputation naturally precluded any open intimacy with the
family, and whose visits were infrequent.
It was midsummer, and a moonlit night; and Mrs. Brown,
very rosy, large-eyed, and pretty, sat upon the piazza, enjoying
the fresh incense of the mountain breeze, and, it is to be feared,
another incense which was not so fresh, nor quite as innocent.
Beside her sat Colonel Starbottle and Judge Boompointer, and a
later addition to her court, in the shape of a foreign tourist. She
was in good spirits.
“ What do you see down the road 1 ” inquired the gallant
Colonel, who had been conscious, for the last few minutes, that
Mrs. Brown’s attention was diverted.
Dust,” said Mrs. Brown, with a sigh, “ Only Sister Anne’s
* flock of sheep.’ ”
The Colonel, whose literary recollections did not extend farther
back than last week’s paper, took a more practical view. “It
ain’t sheep,” he continued; “ it’s a horseman. Judge, ain’t that
Jack Hamlin’s gray?”
But the Judge didn’t know ; and, as Mrs. Brown suggested the
air was growing too cold for further investigations, they retired to
the parlour.
Mr. Brown was in the stable, where he generally retired after
dinner. Perhaps it was to show his contempt for his wife’s com-
panions ; perhaps, like other weak natures, he found pleasure in
the exercise of absolute power over inferior animals. He had a
■certain gratification in the training of a chestnut mare, whom he


could beat or caress as pleased him, which he could n’t do with
Mrs. Brown. It was here that he recognized a certain gray horse
which had just come in, and, looking a little farther on, found his
rider. Brown’s greeting was cordial and hearty ; Mr. Hamlin’s
somewhat restrained. But at Brown’s urgent request, he followed
him up the back stairs to a nan’ow corridor, and thence to a small
room looking out upon the stable-yard. It was plainly furnished
with a bed, a table, a few chairs, and a rack for guns and whips.'
“ This yer’s my home, Jack,” said Brown, with a sigh, as he
threw himself upon the bed, and motioned his companion to a
chair. “ Her room’s t’other end of the hall. It’s more’n six
months since we’ve lived together, or met, except at meals. It’s
mighty rough papers on the head of the house, ain’t it 1 ” he said,
with a forced laugh. “ But I’m glad to see you, Jack, d glad,”
and he reached from the bed, and again shook the unresponsive
hand of Jack Hamlin.
“ I brought ye up here, for I didn’t want to talk in the stable '
though, for the matter of that, it’s all round town. Don’t strike a
light. We can talk here in the moonshine. Put up your feet on
that winder, and sit here beside me. Thar’s whiskey in that jug.”
Mr. Hamlin did not avail himself of the information. Brown,
of Calaveras, turned his face to the wall, and continued :
“If I did n’t love the woman, Jack, I would n’t mind. But
it ’s loving her, and seeing her, day arter day, goin’ on at this
rate, and no one to put down the brake ; that ’s what gits me !
But I’m glad to see ye, Jack, d glad.”
In the darkness he groped about until he had found and wrung
his companion’s hand again. He would have detained it, but
Jack slipped it into the buttoned breast of his coat, and asked
listlessly, “ How long has this been going on ? ”
“ Ever since she came here ; ever since the day sTie walked into
the Magnolia. I was a fool then ; Jack, I’m a fool now ; but I
did n’t know how much I loved her till then. And she has n’t
been the same woman since.
“ But that ain’t all, Jack ; and it’s what I wanted to see you
about, and I’m glad you Ve come. It ain’t that she does 'n’t love
me any more ; it ain’t that she fools with every chap that comes
along, for, perhaps, I staked her love and lost it, as I did every-
thing else at the Magnolia; and, perhaps, foolin’ is natural to
some women, and thar ain’t no great harm done, ’cept to the
fools. But, Jack, I think, —I think she loves somebody else.
Don’t move, Jack ; move ; if your pistol hurts ye, take it off.
“It’s been more ’n six months now that [she’s seemed unhappy
and lonesome, and kinder nervous and scared like. And some-
times I Ve ketched her lookin’ at me sort of timid and pitying.
And she writes to somebody. And for the last week she’s been
gathering her own things,—trinkets, and furbelows, and jew’lry,—
and Jack, I think she’s goin’ off. I could stand all but that. To
have her steal away like a thief —” He put his face downward


to the pillow, and for a few moments there was no sound but the
ticking of a clock on the mantel. Mr. Hamlin lit a cigar, and
moved to the open window. The moon no longer shone into the
room, and the bed and its occupant were in shadow. “What
shall I do, Jack ? ” said the voice from the darkness.
The answer came promptly and [clearly from the window-side,
—“ Spot the man, and kill him on sight.”
“ But Jack ? ”
He’s took the risk ! ”
“ But will that bring her back ? ”
Jack did not reply, but moved from the window towards the
■door.
“ Don’t go yet, Jack ; light the candle, and sit by the table.
It ’s a comfort to see ye, if nothin’ else.”
Jack hesitated, and then complied. He drew a pack of cards
from his pocket and shuffled them, glancing at the bed. But
Brown’s face was turned to the wall. When Mr. Hamlin had
shuffled the cards, he cut them, and dealt one card on the opposite
side of the table and towards the bed, and another on his side of
the table for himself. The first was a deuce ; his own card, a
king. He then shuffled and cut again. This time “dummy”
had a queen, and himself a four-spot. Jack brightened up for the
third deal. It brought his adversary a deuce, and himself a king
again. “ Two out of three,” said Jack, audibly.
“ What’s that, Jack ? ” said Brown.
“ Nothing.”
Then Jack tried his hand with dice ; but he always threw sixes,
and his imaginary opponent aces. The force of habit is sometimes
confusing.
Meanwhile, some magnetic influence in Mr. Hamlin’s presence,
or the anodyne of liquor, or both, brought surcease of sorrow, and
Brown slept. Mr. Hamlin moved his chair to the window, and
looked out on the town of Wingdam, now sleeping peacefully,—its
harsh outlines softened and subdued, its glaring colours mellowed
and sobered in the moonlight that flowed over all. In the hush
he could hear the gurgling of water in the ditches, and the sighing
of the pines beyond the hill. Then he looked up at the firmament,
and as he did so a star shot across the twinkling field. Presently
another, and then another. The phenomenon suggested to Mr.
Hamlin a fresh augury. If in another fifteen minutes another star
should fall He sat there, watch in hand, for twice that time,
but the phenomenon was not repeated. * ■
The clock struck two, and Brown still slept. Mr. Hamlin
approached the table, and took from his pocket a letter, which he
read by the flickering candle-light. It contained only a single
line, written in pencil, in a woman’s hand, —
“ Be at the corral, with the buggy, at three.”
The sleeper moved uneasily, and then awoke. “ Are you there,
Jack?” •


“ Yes.”
“ Don’t go yet. I dreamed just now, Jack, —dreamed of old
times. I thought that Sue and me was being married agin, and
that the parson, Jack, was—who do you think ? —you ! ”
The gambler laughed, and seated himself on the bed, —the
paper still in his hand.
“ It’s a good sign, ain’t it ? ” queried Brown.
“ I reckon. Say, old man, hadn’t you better get up ? ”
The “ old man,” thus affectionately appealed to, rose, with the
assistance of Hamlin’s outstretched hand.
“ Smoke ? ”
Brown mechanically took the proffered cigar.
“ Light 1 ”
Jack had twisted the letter into a spiral, lit it, and held it for
his companion. He continued to hold it until it was consumed,
and dropped the fragment—a fiery star—from the open window.
He watched it as it fell, and then returned to his friend.
“ Old man,” he said, placing his hands upon Brown’s shoulders,
u in ten minutes I’ll be on the road, and gone like that spark. We
won’t see each other agin ; but, before I go, take a fool’s advice :
sell out all you’ve got, take your wife with you, and quit the
country. It ain’t no place for you, nor her. Tell her she must
go ; make her go, if she won’t. Don’t whine because you can’t be
a saint, and she ain’t an angel. Be a man, —and treat her like a
woman. Don’t be a d fool. Good by.”
He tore himself from Brown’s grasp, and leaped down the stairs
like a deer. At the stable-door he collared the half-sleeping
hostler, and backed him against the wall. “ Saddle my horse in
two minutes, or I’ll —” The ellipsis was frightfully suggestive.
“ The missis said you was to have the buggy,” stammered the man.
“ D n the buggy 1 ”
The horse was saddled as fast as the nervous hands of the
astounded hostler could manipulate buckle and strap.
“ Is anything up, Mr. Hamlin? ” said the man, who, like all his
class, admired the elan of his fiery patron, and was really concerned
in his welfare.
“ Stand aside ! ”
The man fell back. With an oath, a bound, and clatter, Jack
was into the road. In another moment, to the man’s half-
awakened eyes, he was but a moving cloud of dust in the distance,
towards which a star just loosed from its brethren was trailing a
stream of fire. * •
But early that morning the dwellers by the Wingdam turnpike,
miles away, heard a voice, pure as a sky-lark’s, singing afield.
They who were asleep turned over on their rude couches to dream
of youth and love and olden days. Hard-faced men and anxious
gold-seekers, already at work, ceased their labours and leaned upon
their picks, to listen to a romantic vagabond ambling away against
the rosy sunrise.


HIGH-WATER MARK.
When the tide was out on the Dedlow Marsh, its extended dreari-
ness was patent. Its spongy, low-lying surface, sluggish, inky pools,
and tortuous sloughs, twisting their slimy way, eel-like, toward the
open bay, were all hard facts. So were the few green tussocks,
with their scant blades, their amphibious flavour, and unpleasant
dampness. And if you choose to indulge your fancy,—although
the flat monotony of the Dedlow Marsh was not inspirihg,—the
wavy line of scattered drift gave an unpleasant consciousness of
the spent waters, and made the dead certainty of the returning
tide a gloomy reflection, which no present sunshine could dissipate.
The greener meadowland seemed oppressed with this idea, and made
no positive attempt at vegetation until the work of reclamation
should be complete. In the bitter fruit of the low cranberry-
bushes one might fancy he detected a naturally sweet disposition
curdled and soured by an injudicious course of too much regular
cold water.
The vocal expression of the Dedlow Marsh was also melancholy
and depressing. The sepulchral boom of the bittern, the shriek
of the curlew, the scream of passing brent, the wrangling of quar-
relsome teal, the sharp querulous protest of the startled crane, and
syllabled complaint of the “killdeer” plover were beyond the
power of written expression. Nor was the aspect of these mourn-
ful fowls at all cheerful and inspiring. Certainly not the blue
peron standing midleg deep in the watdr, obviously catching cold
in a reckless disregard of wet feet and consequences ; nor the
mournful curlew, the dejected plover, or the low spirited snipe,
who saw fit to join him in his suicidal contemplation ; nor the
impassive kingfisher,—an ornithological Marius —reviewing the
desolate expanse ; nor the black raven that went to and fro over
the face of the marsh continually, but evidently couldn’t make up
his mind whether the waters had subsided, and felt low spirited
in the reflection that, after all this trouble, he wouldn’t be able
to give a definite answer. On the contrary, it was evident at a
glance that the dreary expanse of Dedlow Marsh told unpleasantly
on the birds, and that the season of migration was looked forward
to with a feeling of relief and satisfaction by the fullgrown, and
of extravagant anticipation by the callow, brood. But if Dedlow
Marsh was cheerless at the slack of the low tide, you should have
seen it when the tide was strong and full. •When the damp air
blew chilly over the cold, glittering expanse, and came to the
faces of those who looked seaward like another tide ; when a steel-
like glint marked the low hollows and the sinuous line of slough ;
when the great shell-incrusted trunks of fallen trees arose again,
and went forth on their dreary, purposeless wanderings, drifting
hither and thither, but getting no farther toward any goal at the
falling tide or the day’s decline than the cursed Hebrew in the


legend; when the glossy ducks swung silently, making neither
ripple nor furrow on the shimmering surface ; when the fog came
in with the tide and shut out the blue above, even as the green
below had been obliterated ; when boatmen, lost in that fog, pad-
dling about in a hopeless way, started at what seemed the
brushing of mermen’s fingers on the boat’s keel, or shrank from
the tufts of grass spreading around - like the floating hair of a
corpse, and knew by these signs that they were lost upon Dedlow
Marsh, and must make a night of it, and a gloomy one at that, —
then you might know something of Dedlow Marsh at high water.
Let me recall a story connected with this latter view which
nevdlf failed to recur to my mind in my long gunning excursions
upon Dedlow Marsh. Although the event was briefly recorded
in the county paper, I had the story, in all its eloquent detail,
from the lips of the principal actor. I cannot hope to catch the
varying emphasis and peculiar colouring of feminine delineation,
for my narrator was a woman ; but I ’ll try to give at least its
substance.
She lived midway of the great slough of Dedlow Marsh and a
good-sized river, which deborrched four miles beyond into an
estuary formed by the Pacific Ocean, on the long sandy peninsula
which constituted the south-western boundaiy of a noble bay.
The house in which she lived was a small frame cabin raised from
the marsh a few feet by stout piles, and was three miles distant
from the settlements upon the river. Her husband was a logger,
—a profitable business in a county where the principal occupation
was the manufacture of lumber.
It was the season of early spring, when her husband left on
the ebb of a high tide, with a raft of logs for the usual transporta-
tion to the lower end of the bay. As she stood by the door of the
little cabin when the voyagers departed she noticed a cold look in
the south-eastern sky, and she remembered hearing her husband
say to his companions that they must endeavour to complete their
voyage before the coming of the south-westerly gale which he
saw brewing. And that night it began to storm and blow harder
than she had ever before experienced, and some great trees fell
in the forest by the river, and the house rocked like her baby’s
cradle.
But however the storm might roar about the little cabin, she
knew that one she trusted had driven bolt and bar with his own
strong hand, and he feared for her he would not have
left her. This, and her domestic duties, and the care of her
little sickly baby, helped to keep her mind from dwelling on the
weather, except, of course, to hope that he was safely harboured
with the logs at Utopia in the dreary distance. But she noticed
that day, when she went out to feed the chickens and look after
the cow, that the tide was up to the little fence of their garden-
patch, and the roar of the surf on the south beach, though miles
away, she could hear distinctly. And she began to think that she


would like to have some one to talk with about matters, and she
believed that if it had not been so far and so stormy, and the trail
so impassable, she would have taken the baby and have gone
over to Ryckman’s, her nearest neighbour. But then, you see, he
might have returned in the storm, all wet, with no one to see to him;
and it was a long exposure for baby, who was croupy and ailing.
But that night, she never could tell why, she did n’t feel like
sleeping or even lying down. The storm had somewhat abated,
but she still “ sat and sat,” and even tried to read. I don’t know
whether it was a Bible or some profane magazine that this poor
woman read, but most probably the latter, for the words all ran
together and made such sad nonsense that she was forced at-last
to put the book down and turn to that dearer volume which lay
before her in the cradle, with its white initial leaf as yet unsoiled,
and try to look forward to its mysterious future. And, rocking the
cradle, she thought of everything and everybody, but still was
wide awake as ever.
It was nearly twelve o’clock when she at last laid down in her
clothes. How long she slept she could not remember, but she
awoke with a dreadful choking in her throat, and found herself
standing, trembling all over, in the middle of the room, with her
baby clasped to her breast, and she was “ saying something.” The
baby cried and sobbed, and she walked Up and down trying to
hush it, when she heard a scratching at the door. She opened it
fearfully, and was glad to see it was only old Pete, their dog, who
crawled, dripping with water, into the room. She would like to
have looked out, not in the faint hope of her husband’s coming,
but to see how things looked; but the wind shook the door so
savagely that she could hardly hold it. Then she sat down a
little while, and then walked up and down a little while,
and then she lay down again a little while. Lying close by the
wall of the little cabin she thought she heard once or twice some-
thing scrape slowly against the clapboards, like the scraping of
branches. Then there was a little gurgling sound, “ like the baby
made when it was swallowingthen something went “ click-click”
and “cluck-cluck.” so that she sat up in bed. When she did so she
was attracted by something else that seemed creeping from the
back door towards the centre of the room. It wasn’t much wider
than her little finger, but soon it swelled to th.e width of her hand,
and began spreading all over the floor. It was water.
She ran to the front door and threw it wide open, and saw
nothing but water. She ran to the back door and threw it open,
and saw nothing but water. She ran to the side window, and,
throwing that open, she saw nothing but water. Then she remem-
bered hearing her husband once say that there was no danger in
the tide, for that fell regularly, and people could calculate on it,
and that he would rather live near the bay than the river, whose
banks might overflow at any time. But was it the tide ? So she
ran again to the back door, and threw out a stick of wood. It


drifted away towards the bay. She scooped up some of the water
and put it eagerly to her lips. It was fresh and sweet. It was
the j-iver, and not the tide !
It was then—O, God be praised for his goodness! she did
neither faint nor fall; it was then —blessed be the Saviour, for it
was his merciful hand that touched and strengthened her in this
awful moment—that fear dropped from her like a garment, and
her trembling ceased. It was then and thereafter that she never
lost her self-command, through all the trials of that gloomy night.
She drew the bedstead towards the middle of the room, and
placed a table upon it and on that she put the cradle. The water
on the floor was already over her ankles, and the house once or
twice moved so perceptibly, anid seemed to be racked so, that the
closet doors all flew open. Then she heard the same rasping and
thumping against the wall, and, looking out, saw that a large
uprooted tree, which had lain near the road at the upper end of
the pasture, had floated down to the house. Luckily its long
roots dragged in the soil and kept it from moving as rapidly as
the current, for had it struck the house in its full career, even the
strong nails and bolts in the piles could not have withstood the
shock. The hound had leaped upon its knotty surface, and
crouched near the roots shivering and whining. A ray of hope
flashed across her mind. She drew a heavy blanket from the bed,
and, wrapping it about the babe, waded in the deepening waters
to the door. As the tree swung a'gain, broadside on, making the
little cabin creak and tremble, she leaped on to its trunk. By
God’s mercy she succeeded in obtaining a footing on its slippery
surface, and, twining an ami about its roots, she held in the other
her moaning child. Then something cracked near the front
porch, and the whole front of the house she had just quitted fell
forward, —just as cattle fall on their knees before they lie down, —
and at the same moment the great redwood tree swung round and
drifted away with its living cargo into the black night.
For all the excitement and danger, for all her soothing of her
crying babe, for all the whistling of the wind, for all the un-
certainty of her situation, she still turned to look at the deserted
and water-swept cabin. She remembered even then, and she
wonders how foolish she was to think of it at that time, that she
wished she had put on another dress, and the baby’s best clothes ;
and she kept praying that the house would be spared so that he,
when he returned, would have something to come to, and it
would n’t be quite so desolate, and —how could he ever know what
had become of her and baby ? And at the thought she grew sick
and faint. But she had something else to do beside worrying, for
whenever the long roots of her ark struck an obstacle, the whole
trunk made half a revolution, and twice dipped her in the black
water. The hound, who kept distracting her by running up and
down the tree and howling, at hist fell off at one of these colli-
sions. He swam for some time beside her, and she tried to get the


poor beast upon the tree, but he 4! acted silly ” and wild, and at
last she lost sight of him for ever. Then she and her baby were
left ‘alone. The light which had burned for a few minutes in the
deserted cabin was quenched suddenly. She could not then tell
whither she was drifting. The outlines of the white dunes on the
peninsula showed dimly ahead, and she judged the tree was
moving in a line with the river. It must be about slack water,
and she had probably reached the eddy formed by the confluence
of the tide and the overflowing waters of the river. Unless the
tide fell soon, there was present danger of her drifting to its
channel, and being carried out to sea or crushed in the floating
drift. That peril averted, if she were carried out on the ebb
toward the bay, she might hope to strike one of the wooded pro-
montories of the peninsula, and rest till daylight. Sometimes she
thought she heard voices and shouts from the river, and the
bellowing of cattle and bleating of sheep. Then again it was only
the ringing in her ears and throbbing ,of her heart. She found at
about this time that she was so chilled and stiffened in her
cramped position that she could scarcely move, and the baby cried
so when she put it to her breast that she noticed the milk refused
to flow ; and she was so frightened at that, that she put her head
under her shawl, and for the first time cried bitterly.
When she raised her head again, the boom of the surf
was behind her, and she knew that her ark had again swung
round. She dipped up the water to cool her parched throat, and
found that it was salt as her tears. There was a relief, though,
for by this sign she knew that she was drifting with the tide. It
was then the wind went down, and the great and awful silence
oppressed her. There was scarcely a ripple against the furrowed
sides of the great trunk on which she rested, and around her all
was black gloom and quiet. She spoke to the baby just to hear
hersclf speak, and to know that she had not lost her voice. She
thought then, —it was queer, but she could not help thinking it, —
how awful must have been the night when the great ship swung
over the Asiatic peak, and the sounds of creation were blotted out
from the world. She thought, too, of mariners clinging to spars,
and of poor women who were lashed to rafts, and beaten to death
liy the cruel sea. She tried to thank God that she was thus spared,
and lifted her eyes from the baby who had fallen into a fretful
sleep. Suddenly, away to the southward, a great light lifted
itself out of the gloom, and flashed and flickered, and flickered
and flashed again. Her heart fluttered quickly against the baby’s
cold cheek. It was the lighthouse at the entrance of the bay. As
she was yet wondering, the tree suddenly rolled a little, dragged a
little, and then seemed to lie quiet and still. She put out her
hand and the current gurgled against it. The tree was aground,
and, by the position of the light and the noise of the surf, aground
iipon the Dedlow Marsh.
Had it not been for her baby, who was ailing and croupy, had it


not been for the sudden drying up of that sensitive fountain, she
would have felt safe and relieved. Perhaps it was this which
tended to make all her impressions mournful and gloomy. As the
tide rapidly fell, a great flock of black brent fluttered by her,
screaming and crying. Then the plover flew up and piped mourn-
fully, as they wheeled around the trunk, and at last fearlessly lit
upon it like a gray cloud. Then the heron flew over and around
her, shrieking and protesting, and at last dropped its gaunt legs
only a few yards from her. But, strangest of all, a pretty white
bird, larger than a dove, —like a pelican, but not a pelican,—
circled around and around her. At last it lit upon a rootlet of the
tree, quite over her shoulder. She put out her hand and stroked
its beautiful white neck, and it never appeared to move. It stayed
there so long that she thought she would lift up the baby to see it,
and try to attract her attention. But when she did so, the child
was so chilled and cold, and had such a blue look under the little
lashes which it did n’t raise at all, that she screamed aloud, and
the bird flew away, and she fainted.
Well, that was the worst of it, and perhaps it was not so much,
after all, to any but herself. For when she recovered her senses
it was bright sunlight, and dead low water. There was a confused
noise of guttural voices about her, and an old squaw, singing an
Indian “ hushaby,” and rocking herself from side to side before a
fire built on the marsh, before which she, the recovered wife and
mother, lay weak and weary. Her first thought was for her baby,
and she was about to speak, when a young squaw, who must have
• been a mother herself, fathomed her thought and brought her the
“ mowitch,” pale but living, in such a queer little willow cradle
all bound up, just like the squaw’s own young one, that she
laughed and cried together, and the young squaw and the old
squaw showed their big white teeth and glinted their black eyes
and said, “ Plenty get well, skeena mowitch,” “ wagee man come
plenty soon,” and she could have kissed their brown faces in her
joy. And then she found that they had been gathering berries on
the marsh in their queer, comical baskets, and saw the skirt of her
gown fluttering on the tree from afar, and the old squaw could n’t
resist the temptation of procuring a new garment, and came down
and discovered the “wagee” woman and child. And of course
she gave the garment to the old squaw, as you may imagine, and
when he came at last and rushed up to her, looking about ten years
older in his anxiety, she felt so faint again that they had to carry
her to the canoe. For, you see, he knew nothing about the flood
until he met the Indians at Utopia, and knew by the signs that
the poor woman was his wife. And at the next high-tide he
towed the tree away back home, although it wasn’t worth the
trouble, and built another house, using the old tree for the
foundation and props, and called it after her, “ Mary’s Ark! ”
But you may guess the next house was built above High-water
mark. And that’s all.


Not much, perhaps, considering the malevolent capacity of the
Dedlow Marsh. But you must tramp over it at low water, or
paddle over it at high tide, or get lost upon it once or twice in the
fog, as I have, to understand properly Mary’s adventure, or to
appreciate duly the blessings of lining beyond High-Water
Mark.
A LONELY BIDE.
As I stepped into the Slumgullion .stage I saw that it was a dark
night, a lonely road, and that I was the only passenger. Let me
assure the reader that I have no ulterior design in making this
assertion. A long course of light reading has forewarned me
what every experienced intelligence must’confidently look for from
such a statement. The story-teller who wilfully tempts Fate by
such obvious beginnings ; who is to the expectant reader in
danger of being robbed, or half-murdered, or frightened by an
escaped lunatic, or introduced to his lady-love for the first time,
deserves to be detected. lam relieved to say that none of these
things occurred to me. The road from Wingdam to Slumgullion
knew no other banditti than the regularly licensed hotel-keepers ;
lunatics had not yet reached such depth of imbecility as to ride
of their own free-will in California stages; and my Laura,
amiable and long suffering as she always is, could not, I fear,
have borne up against these depressing circumstances long enough
to have made the slightest impression on me.
I stood with my shawl and carpet-bag in hand, gazing doubt-
fully on the vehicle. Even in the darkness the red dust of Wing-
dam was visible on its roof and sides, and the red slime of Slum-
gullion clung tenaciously to its wheels. I opened the door ; the
stage creaked uneasily, and in the gloomy abyss the swaying
straps beckoned me, like ghostly hands, to come in now, and have
my sufferings out at once.
I must not omit to mention the occurrence of a circumstance which
struck me as appalling and mysterious. A lounger on the steps of
the hotel, whom I had reason to suppose was not in any way con-
nected with the stage company, gravely descended, and, walking
towards the conveyance, tried the handle of the door, opened it, ex-
pectorated in the carriage, and returned to the hotel with a serious
demeanour. Hardly had he resumed his position, when another
individual, equally disinterested, impassively walked down the
steps, proceeded to the back of the stage, lifted it, expectorated
carefully on the axle, and returned slowly and pensively to the
hotel. A third spectator wearily disengaged himself from one of
the lonic columns of the portico and walked to the box, remained
for a moment t in serious and expectorative contemplation of the
boot, and then returned to his column. There was something so
weird in this baptism that I grew quite nervous.


Perhaps, I was out of spirits. A number of infinitesimal
annoyances, winding up with the resolute persistency of the clerk
at the stage-office to enter my name mis-spelt on the way-bill,
had not predisposed me to cheerfulness. The inmates of the
Eureka House, from a social view-point, were not attractive.
There was the prevailing opinion—so common to many* honest
people—that a serious style of deportment and conduct toward
a stranger indicates high gentility and elevated station. Obeying
this principle, all hilarity ceased on my entrance to supper, and
general remark merged into the safer and uncompromising
chronicle of several bad cases of diphtheria, then epidemic at
Wingdam. When I left the dining-room, with an odd feeling that
I had been supping exclusively on mustard and tea-leaves, I
stopped a moment at the parlour door. A piano, harmoniously
related to the dinner-bell, tinkled responsive to a diffident and
uncertain touch. On the white wall the shadow of an old and
sharp profile was bending over several symmetrical and shadowy
curls. “ I sez to Mariar, Mariar, sez I, ‘ Praise to the face is
open disgrace.’ ” I heard no more. Dreading some susceptibility
to sincere expression on the subject of female loveliness, I walked
away, checking the compliment that otherwise might have risen
unbidden to my lips, and have brought shame and sorrow to the
household.
It was with the memory of these experiences resting heavily
upon me that I stood hesitatingly before the stage door. The
driver, about to mount, was for a moment illuminated by the open
door of the hotel. He had the wearied look which was the
distinguishing expression of Wingdam. Satisfied that I was
properly way-billed and receipted for, he took no further notice of
me. I looked longingly at the box-seat, but he did not respond
to the appeal. I flung my carpet-bag into the chasm, dived
recklessly after it, and —before I was fairly seated —with a great
sigh, a creaking of unwilling springs, complaining bolts, and
harshly expostulating axle, we moved away. Eather the hotel
door slipped behind, the sound of the piano sank to rest, and the
night and its shadows moved solemnly upon us.
To say it was dark expressed but faintly the pitchy obscurity
that encompassed the vehicle. The roadside trees were scarcely
distinguishable as deeper masses of shadow ; I knew them only by
the peculiar sodden odour that from time to time sluggishly
flowed in at the open window as we rolled by. We proceeded
slowly ; so leisurely that, leaning from the carnage, I more than
once detected the fragrant sigh of some astonished cow, whose
ruminating repose upon the highway we had ruthlessly disturbed.
But in the darkness our progress, more the guidance of some
mystcrioils instinct than any apparent volition of our own, gave
an indefinable charm of security to our journey, that a moment’s
hesitation or indecision on the part of the driver would have
destroyed.


I had indulged a hope that in the empty vehicle I might obtain
that rest so often denied me in its crowded condition. It was a
weak delusion. When I stretched out my limbs it was only to find
that the ordinary conveniences for making several people distinctly
uncomfortable were distributed throughout my individual frame.
At last, resting my arms on the straps, by dint of much gymnastic
effort I became sufficiently composed to be aware of a more refined
species of torture. The springs of the stage, rising and falling
regularly, produced a rhythmical beat, which began to painfully
absorb my attention. Slowly this thumping merged into a sense-
less echo of the mysterious female of the hotel parlour, and shaped
itself into this awful and benumbing axiom, —“ Praise-to-thc-face-
is-open-disgrace. Praise-to-the-face-is-open-disgrace.” Inequal-
ities of the road only quickened its utterance or drawled it to an
exasperating length.
It was of no use to seriously consider the statement. It was of
no use to except to it indignantly. It was of no use to recall the
many instances where praise to the face had redounded to the
everlasting honour of praiser and bepraised ; of no use to dwell
sentimentally on modest genius and courage lifted up and strength-
ened by open commendation ; of no use to except to the mysterious
female, to picture her as rearing a thin-blooded generation on
selfish and mechanically repeated axioms,—all this failed to coun-
teract the monotonous repetition of this sentence. There was
nothing to do but to give in, —and I was about to accept it weakly,
as we too often treat other illusions of darkness and necessity, for
the time being,—when I became aware of some other annoyance
that had been forcing itself upon me for the last few moments.
How quiet the driver was !
Was there any driver ? Had I any reason to suppose that he
was not lying, gagged and bound on the roadside, and the high-
wayman, with blackened face who did the thing so quietly, driving
me—whither ? The thing is perfectly feasible. And what is this
fancy now being jolted out of me. A story ? It’s of no use to
keep it back, —particularly in this abysmal vehicle, and here it
comes : I am a marquis,—a French Marquis ; French, because the
peerage is not so well known, and the country is better adapted to
romantic incident, —a Marquis, because the democratic reader
delights in the nobility. My name is something Vigny. lam
coming from Paris to my country-seat at St. Germain. It is a dark
night, and I fall asleep and tell my honest coachman, Andr6, not
to disturb me, and dream of an angel. The carriage at last stops
at the chateau. It is so dark that when I alight Ido not recognise
the face of the footman who holds the carnage door. But what
of that ?—Paste ! I am heavy with sleep. The same obscurity
also hides the old familiar indecencies of the statues on the ter-
race ; but there is a door, and it opens and shuts behind me
smartly. Then I find myself in a trap, in the presence of the
brigand who has quietly gagged poor Andr6 and conducted the


carriage thither. There is nothing for me to do, as a gallant
French Marquis, but to say, “ Parblcu I ” draw my rapier, and
die valorously! lam found a week or two after, outside a
deserted cabaret near the barrier, with a hole through my ruffled
linen and my pockets stripped. No ; on second thoughts, I am
rescued, —rescued by the angel I have been dreaming of, who is
the assumed daughter of the brigand, but the real daughter of_ an
intimate friend.
Looking from the window again, in the vain hope of distin-
guishing the driver, I found my eyes were glowing accustomed to
the darkness. I could see the distant horizon, defined by India-
inky woods, relieving a lighter sky. A few stars widely spaced
in this picture glimmered sadly. I noticed again the infinite depth
of patient sorrow in their serene faces ; and I hope that the Van-
dal who first applied the flippant “ twinkle” to them may not be
driven melancholy mad by their reproachful eyes. I noticed
again the mystic charm of space that imparts a sense of individual
solitude to each integer of the densest constellation, involving the
smallest star with immeasurable loneliness. Something of this
calm and solitude crept over me, and I dozed in my gloomy
cavern. When I awoke the full moon was rising. Seen from my
window, it had an indescribably unreal and theatrical effect. It
was the full moon of Nonna, —that remarkable celestial pheno-
menon which rises so palpably to a hushed .audience and a sublime
andante chorus, until the Casta Diva is sung,—the “inconstant
moon” that then and thereafter remains fixed in the heavens as
though it were a part of the solar system inaugurated by Joshua.
Again the white-robed Druids filed past me, again I saw that im-
probable mistletoe cut from that impossible oak, and again cold
chills ran down my back with the first strain of the recitative. The
thumping springs essayed to beat time, and the private-box-like
obscurity of the vehicle lent a cheap enchantment to tlje view.
But it was a vast improvement upon my past experience, and I
hugged the fond delusion.
My fears for the driver were dissipated with the rising moon.
A familiar sound had assured me of his presence in the full
possession of at least one of his most important functions.
Frequent and full expectoration convinced me that his lips were
as yet not sealed by the gag of highwaymen, and soothed my
anxious ear. With this load lifted from my mind, and assisted
by the mild presence of Diana, who left, as when she visited
Endymion, much of her splendour outside my cavern, —I looked
around the empty vehicle. On the forward seat lay a woman’s
hair-pin. I picked it up with an interest that, however, soon
abated. There was no scent of the roses to cling to it still, not
even of hair-oil. No bend or twist in its rigid angles betrayed any
trait of its wearer’s character. I tried to think that it might have
been “ Mariar’s.” I tried to imagine that, confining the
symmetrical curls of that girl, it might have heard the soft


compliments whispered in her ears, which provoked the wrath of
the aged female. But in vain. It was reticent and unswerving
in its upright fidelity, and at last slipped listlessly through my
fingers. .
I had dozed repeatedly,—waked on the threshold of oblivion by
contact with some of the angles of the coach, and feeling that I
was unconsciously assuming, in imitation of a humble insect of
my childish recollection, that spherical shape which could best
resist those impressions, when I perceived that the moon, riding
high in the heavens, had begun to separate the formless masses of
the shadowy landscape. Trees isolated, in clumps and assemblages,
changed places before my window. The sharp outlines of the
distant hills came back, as in daylight, but little softened in the
dry, cold, dewless air of a California summer night. I was
wondering how late it was, and thinking that if the horses of the
night travelled as slowly as the team before us, Faustus might
have been spared his agonizing prayer, when a sudden spasm of
activity attacked my driver. A succession of whip-snappings,
like a pack of Chinese crackers, broke from the box before me.
The stage leaped forward, and when I could pick myself from
under the seat, a long white building had in some mysterious way
rolled before my window. It must be Slumgullion ! As I
descended from the stage I addressed the driver :
“ I thought you changed horses on the road ? ”
“So we did. Two hours ago.”
“ That’s odd. I didn't notice it.”
“ Must have been asleep, sir. Hope you had a pleasant nap.
Bully place for a nice quiet snooze, —empty stage, sir ! ”
THE MAN OF NO ACCOUNT,
His name was Fagg—David Fagg. He came to California in ’52
with us, in the “ Skyscraper.” I don’t think he did it in an
adventurous way. He probably had no other place to go to.
When a knot of us young fellows would recite what splendid
opportunities we resigned to go, and how sorry our friends were
to have us leave, and show daguerreotypes and locks of hair, and
talk of Mary and Susan, the man of no account used to sit by and
listen with a pained, mortified expression on his plain face, and say
nothing. I think he had nothing to say. He had no associates
except when we patronised him ; and, in point of fact, he was a
good deal of sport to us. He was always sea-sick whenever we had
a capful of wind. He never got his sea-legs on either. And I
never shall forget how we all laughed when Rattler took him the
piece of pork on a string, and But you know that time-
honoured joke. And then we had such a splendid lark with him.
Miss Fanny Twinkler could n’t bear the sight of him, and we
used to make Fagg think that she had taken a fancy to him, and


sent him little delicacies and books from the cabin. You ought to
have witnessed the rich scene that took place when he came up,
stammering and very sick, to thank her ! Did n’t she flash up
grandly and beautifully and scornfully ? So like “ Medora,”
Eattler said, —Rattler knew Byron by heart, —and was n’t old
Fagg awfully cut up ? But he got over it, and when Rattler fell
sick at Valparaiso, old Fagg used to nurse him. You see he was a
good sort of fellow, but he lacked manliness and spirit.
He had absolutely no idea of poetry, I’ve seen him sit stolidly
by, mending his old clothes, when Rattler delivered that stirring
apostrophe of Byron’s to the ocean. He asked Rattler once, quite
seriously, if he thought Byron was ever sea-sick. I don’t remem-
ber Rattler’s reply, but I know we all laughed very much, and I
have no doubt it was something good, for Rattler was smart.
When the “ Skyscraper ” arrived at San Francisco we had a
grand “feed.” We agreed to meet every year and perpetuate the
occasion. Of course we did n’t invite Fagg. Fagg was a steerage-
passenger, and it was necessary, you see, now we were ashore, to
exercise a little discretion. But Old Fagg, as we called him, —he
was only about twenty-five years old, by the way, —was the source
of immense amusement to us that day. It appeared that he had
conceived the idea that he could walk to Sacramento, and actually
started oif afoot. We had a good time, and shook hands with one
another all around, and so parted. Ah me ! only eighty ears ago,
and yet some of those hands then clasped in amity have been
clenched at each other, or have dipped furtively in one another’s
pockets, I know that we did n’t dine together the next year,
because young Barker swore he would n’t put his feet under the
same mahogany with such a very contemptible scoundrel as that
Mixer ; and Nibbles, who borrowed money at Valparaiso of young
Stubbs, who was then a waiter in a restaurant, did n’t like to meet
such people.
When I bought a number of shares in the Coyote Tunnel at
Mugginsvillc, in ’54, I thought I’d take a run up there and see it.
I stopped at the Empire Hotel, and after dinner I got a horse and
rode round the town and out to the claim. One of those indi-
viduals whom newspaper correspondents call “our intelligent
informant,” and to whom in all small communities the right of
answering questions is tacitly yielded, was quietly pointed out to
me. Habit had enabled him to work and talk at the same time,
and he never pretermitted either. Ho gave me a history of the
claim, and added : “You see, stranger” (he addressed the bank
before him), “ gold is sure to come out ’er that theer claim (he put
in a comma with his pick), but the old pro-pri-e-tor (he wiggled
out the word and the point of his pick) warn’t of much account (a
long stroke of the pick for a period). He was green, and let the
boys about here jump him,” —and the rest of his sentence was
confided to his hat, which he had removed to wipe his manly brow
with his red bandanna.


I asked him who was the original proprietor.
“ His name war Fagg.”
I went to see him. He looked a little older and plainer. He
had worked hard, he said, and was getting on “ so, so.” I took
quite a liking to him and patronized him to some extent. Whether
I did so because I was beginning to have a distrust for such
fellows as Rattler and Mixer is not necessary for me to state.
You remember how the Coyote Tunnel went in, and how awfully
we shareholders were done ! Well, the next thing I heard was
that Rattler, who was one of the heaviest shareholders, was up at
Mugginsville keeping bar for the proprietor of the Mugginsville
Hotel, and that old Fagg had struck it rich, and didn’t know
what to do with his money. All this was told me by Mixer, who
had been there, settling up matters, and likewise that Fagg was
sweet upon the daughter of the proprietor of the aforesaid hotel.
And so by hearsay and letter I eventually gathered that old
Robins, the hotel man, was tiying to get up a match between
Nellie Robins and Fagg. Nellie was a pretty, plump, and foolish
little thing, and would do just as her father wished. I thought it
would be a good thing for Fagg if he should marry and settle
down ; that as a married man he might be of some account. So I
ran up to Mugginsville one day to look after things.
It did me an immense deal of good to make Rattler mix my
drinks for me, —Rattler 1 the gay, brilliant, and unconquerable
Rattler, who had tried to snub me two years ago. I talked to him
about old Fagg and Nellie, particularly as I thought the subject
was distasteful. He never liked Fagg, and he was sure, he said,
that Nellie did n’t. Did Nellie like anybody else? He turned
around to the mirror behind the bar and brushed up his hair ! I
understood the conceited wretch, I thought I’d put Fagg on his
guard and get him to hurry up matters, I had a long talk with
him. You could,see by the way the poor fellow acted that he was
badly stuck. He sighed, and promised to pluck up courage to
hurry matter's to a crisis. Nellie was a good girl, and I think had
a sort of quiet respect for old Fagg’s unobtrusiveness. But her
fancy was already taken captive by Rattler’s superficial qualities,
which were obvious and pleasing. Ido n’t think Nellie was any
worse than you or I. We are more apt to take acquaintances at
their apparent value than their intrinsic worth. It’s less trouble,
and, except when we want to trust them, quite as convenient.
The difficulty with women is that their feelings are apt to get
interested sooner than ours, and then, you know, reasoning is out
of the question. This is what old Fagg would have known had he
been of any account. But he was n’t. So much the worse for
him.
It was a few months afterward, and I was sitting in my office
when in walked old Fagg. I was surprised to see him down, but
we talked over the current topics in that mechanical manner of
people who know that they have something else to say, but are


obliged to get at it in that formal way. After an interval Fagg in
his natural manner said, —
“ I’m going home 1 ”
“ Going home 7 ” •
“ Yes, —that is, I think I ’ll take a trip to the Atlantic States.
I came to see you, as you know I have some little property, and I
have executed a power of attorney for you to manage, my affairs.
I have some papers I’d like to leave with you. Will you take
charge of them 7 ”
“ Yes,” I said. “ But what of Nellie 7 ”
His face fell. He tried to smile and the combination resulted in
one of the most startling and grotesque effects I ever beheld. At
length he said, —
“ I shall not marry Nellie, —that is,” —he seemed to apologise in*
ternally for the positive form of expression,—“ I think that I had
better not.”
“ David Fagg,” I said, with sudden severity, “ you ’re of no
account!”
To my astonishment his face brightened. “ Yes,” said he,
“ that’s it, —I’m of no account! But I always knew it. You see
I thought Rattler loved that girl as well as I did, and I knew she
liked him better than she did me, and would be happier, I dare
say, with him, But then I knew that old Robins would have pre*
ferred me to him, as I was better off, —and the girl would do as
he said, —and, you see, I thought I was kinder in the way,—and
so I left. But,” he continued, as I was about to interrupt him, “for
fear the old man might object to Rattler, I’ve lent him enough to
set him up in business for himself in Dogtown. A pushing, active,
brilliant fellow, you know, like Rattler, can get along, and will
soon be in his old position again,—and you need n’t be hard OU
him, you know, if he does n’t. Good by.”
I was too much disgusted with his treatment of that Rattler to
be at all amiable, but as his business was profitable, I promised to
attend to it, and he left. A few weeks passed. The return
steamer arrived, and a terrible incident occupied the papers for
days afterward. People in all parts of the state conned eagerly
the details of an awful shipwreck, and those who had friends
aboard went away by themselves, and read the long list of the
lost under their breath. I read of the gifted, the gallant, the
noble, and loved ones who had perished, and among them I think
I was the first to read the name of David Fagg. For the “ man
of no account” had “gonehome !”


MUSS.
CHAPTER I.
Just where the Sierra Nevada begins to subside in gentler undu-
lations, and the rivers grow less rapid and yellow on the side of a
great red mountain, stands “ Smith’s Pocket.” Seen from the red
road at sunset, in the red light and the red dust, its white houses
look like the outcroppings of quartz on the mountain-side. The
red stage topped with red-shirted passengers is lost to view half a
dozen times in the tortuous descent, turning up unexpectedly in
out-of-the-way places, and vanishing altogether within a hundred
yards of the town. It is probably owing to this sudden twist in
the road that the advent of a stranger in Smith’s Pocket is usually
attended with a peculiar circumstance. Dismounting from the
vehicle at the stage-office, the too confident traveller is apt to
walk straight out of town under the impression that it lies in quite
another direction. It is related that one of the tunnel-men, two
miles from town, met one of these self-reliant passengers with a
carpet-bag, umbrella, Harper’s Magazine, and other evidences of
“ Civilization and Refinement,” plodding along over the road he
had just ridden, vainly endeavouring to find the settlement of
Smith’s Pocket,
An observant traveller might have found some compensation for
his disappointment in the weird aspect of that vicinity. There
were huge fissures on the hillside, and displacements of the red
soil, resembling more the chaos of some primary elemental up-
heaval than the work of man ; while, half-way down, a long
flume straddled its narrow body and disproportionate legs over the
chasm, like an enormous fossil of some forgotten antediluvian.
At every step smaller ditches crossed the road, hiding in their
sallow depths unlovely streams that crept away to a clandestine
union with the great yellow torrent below, and here and there
were the ruins of some cabin with the chimney alone left intact
and the hearthstone open to the skies.
The settlement of Smith’s Pocket owed its origin to the finding
■of a “ pocket” on its site by a veritable Smith. Five thousand dol-
lars were taken out of it in one half-hour by Smith. Three thou-
sand dollars were expended by Smith and others in erecting a
flume and in tunnelling. And then Smith’s Pocket was found to
be only a pocket, and subject like other pockets to depletion.
Although Smith pierced the bowels of the great red mountain,


that five thousand dollars was the first and last return of his
labour. The mountain grew reticent of its golden secrets, and
the flume steadily ebbed away the remainder of Smith’s fortune.
Then Smith went into quartz-mining ; then into quartz-milling ;
then into hydraulics and ditching, and then by easy degrees into
saloon-keeping. Presently it was whispered that JSmith was
drinking a great deal; then it was known that Smith was„ a
habitual drunkard, and then people began to think, as they are
apt to, that he had never been anything else. But the settlement
of Smith’s Pocket, like that of most discoveries, was happily not
dependent on the fortune of its pioneer, and other parties projected
tunnels and found pockets. So Smith’s Pocket became a
settlement with its two fancy stores, its two hotels, its one express-
office, and its two first families. Occasionally its one long
straggling street was overawed by the assumption of the latest San
Francisco fashions, imported per express, exclusively to the first
families ; making outraged Nature, in the ragged outline of her
furrowed surface, look still more homely, and putting personal
insult on that greater portion of the population to whom the
Sabbath, with a change of linen, broitght merely the necessity of
cleanliness, without the luxury of adornment. Then there was a
Methodist Church, and hard by a Monte Bank, and a little
beyond, on the mountain-side, a graveyard ; and then a little
school-house.
“ The Master,” as he was known to his little flock, sat alone one
night in the school-house, with some open copy-books before him,
carefully making those bold and full characters which are
supposed to combine the extremes of chirographical and moral
excellence, and had got as far as “ Riches are deceitful,” and was
elaborating the noun with an insincerity of flourish that was quite
in the spirit of his text, when he heard a gentle tapping. The
woodpeckers had been busy about the roof during the day, and the
noise did not disturb his work. But the opening of the door, and
the tapping continuing from the inside, caused him to look up.
He was slightly startled by the figure of a young girl, dirty and
shabbily clad. Still, her great black eyes, her coarse, uncombed,
lustreless black hair falling over her sun-bumed face, her red
arms and feet streaked with the red soil, were all familiar to him.
It was Melissa Smith, —Smith’s motherless child.
“ What can she want here ? ” thought the master. Everybody
knew “ Mliss,” as she was called, throughout the length and
height of Red Mountain. Everybody knew her as an incorrigible
girl. Her fierce, ungovernable disposition, her mad freaks and
lawless character, were in their way as proverbial as the story of
her father’s weaknesses, and as philosophically accepted by the
townsfolk. She wrangled with and fought the school-boys with
keener invective and quite as powerful arm. She followed the
trails with a woodman’s craft, and the master had met her before,
miles away, shoeless, stockingless, and bareheaded on the


mountain road. The miners’ camps along the stream supplied her
with subsistence during these voluntary pilgrimages, in freely
offered alms. Not but that a larger protection had been previously
extended to Mliss. The Rev. Joshua McSnagley, “ stated ”
preacher, had placed her in the hotel as servant, by way of
preliminary and had introduced her to his scholars at
Sunday school. But she threw plates occasionally at the landlord,
and quickly retorted to the cheap witticisms of the guests, and
created in the Sabbath school a sensation that was so inimical to
the orthodox dulness and placidity of that institution, that, with a
decent regard for the starched frocks and unblemished morals of
the two pink-and-white faced children of the first families, the
reverend gentleman had her ignominiously expelled. Such were
the antecedents, and such the character of Mliss, as she stood
before the master. It was shown in the ragged dress, the unkempt
hair, and bleeding feet, and asked his pity. It flashed from her
black, fearless eyes, and commanded his respect.
“ I come here to-night,” she said rapidly and boldly, keeping her
hard glance on his, “ because I knew you was alone. I would n’t
come here when them gals was here. I hate ’em and they hates
me. That’s why. You keep school, don’t you ? I want to be
teached ! ”
If to the shabbiness of her apparel and uncomeliness of her
tangled hair and dirty face she had added the humility of tears,
the master would have extended to her the usual moiety of pity,
and nothing more. But with the natural, though illogical in-
stincts of his species, her boldness awakened in him something of
that respect which all original natures pay unconsciously to one
another in any grade. And he gazed at her the more fixedly as
she went on still rapidly, her hand on that door-latch and her
eyes on his : *
“My name’s Mliss, —Mliss Smith ! You can bet your life on
that. My Father ’s Old Smith, —Old Bummer Smith, —that’s
what’s the matter with him. Mliss Smith, —and I’m coming to
school! ”
“ Well 1 ” said the master.
Accustomed to be thwarted and opposed, often wantonly and
cruelly, for no other purpose than to excite the violent impulses
of her nature, the master’s phlegm evidently took her by surprise.
She stopped ; she began to twist a lock of her hair between her
fingers ; and the rigid line of upper lip, drawn over the wicked
little teeth, relaxed and quivered slightly. Then her eyes dropped,
and something like a blush struggled up to her cheek, and tried to
assert itself through the splashes of redder soil, and the sunburn
of years. Suddenly she threw herself forward, calling on God to
strike her dead, and fell quite weak and helpless, with her face
on the master's desk, crying and sobbing as if her heart would
break.
The master lifted her gently and waited for the paroxysm to


pass. When, with face still averted, she was repeating between
her sobs the mea culpa of childish penitence—that “ she’d be good,
she didn’t mean to,” etc., it came to him to ask her why she had
left Sabbath school.
Why had she left the Sabbath school ? —why ? 0 yes. What
did he (McSnagley) want to tell her she was wicked 'for 1 What
did he tell her that God hated her for ? If God hated her. what
did she want to go to Sabbath school for ? She didn’t want to'be
“ beholden ” to anybody who hated her.
Had she told McSnagley this ?
Yes, she had.
The master laughed. It was a hearty laugh, and echoed so
oddly in the little school-house, and seemed so inconsistent and
discordant with the sighing of the pines without, that he shortly
corrected himself with a sigh. The sigh was quite as sincere in
its way, however, and after a moment of serious silence he asked
about her father.
Her father ? What father ? Whose father ? What had he
ever done for her ? Why did the girls hate her ? Come now !
what made the folks say, “ Old Bummer Smith’s Mliss ? ” when
she passed ? Yes; 0 yes. She wished he was dead, —she was
dead, —everybody was dead ; and her sobs broke forth anew.
The master then, leaning over her, told her as well as he could
what you or I might have said after hearing such unnatural
theories from childish lips; only bearing in mind perhaps better
than you or I the unnatural facts of her ragged dress, her bleed-
ing feet, and the omnipresent shadow of her drunken father.
Then, raising her to her feet, he wrapped his shawl around her,
and, bidding her come early in the morning, he walked with her
down the road. There he bade her “ good night.” The moon
shone brightly on the narrow path before them. He stood and
watched the bent little figure as it staggered down the road, and
waited until it had passed the little graveyard and reached the
curve of the hill, where it turned and stood for a moment, a mere
atom of suffering outlined against the far-off patient stars. Then
he went back to his work. But the lines of the copybook there-
after faded into long parallels of never-ending road, over which
childish figures seemed to pass sobbing and crying into the night.
Then, the little schoolhouse seemed lonelier than before, he shut
the door and went home.
The next morning Mliss came to school. Her face had been
washed, and her coarse black hair bore evidence of recent struggles
with the comb, in which both had evidently suffered. The old
defiant look shone occasionally in her eyes, but her manner was
tamer and more subdued. Then began a series of little trials and self-
sacrifices in which master and pupil bore an equal part, and which in-
creased the confidence and sympathy between them. Although obe-
dient under the master’s eye, at times during recess, if thwarted or
stung by a fancied slight, Mliss would rage in ungovernable fuxy, and


many a palpitating young savage, finding himself matched with
his own weapons of torment, would seek the master with torn
jacket and scratched face, and complaints of the dreadful Mliss,
There was a serious division among the townspeople on the subject;
some threatening to withdraw their children from such evil com-
panionship, and others as warmly upholding the course of the
master in his work of reclamation. Meanwhile, with a steady per-
sistence that seemed quite astonishing to him on looking back after-
ward. the master drew Mliss gradually out of the shadow of hex-
past life, as though it were but her natural progress down the narrow
path on which he had set her feet the moonlit night of their first
meeting. Remembering the experience of the evangelical
McSnagley, he carefully avoided that Rock of Ages on which that
unskilful pilot had shipwrecked her young faith. But if, in the
course of her reading, she chanced to stumble upon those few words
which have lifted such as she above the level of the older, the
wiser, and the more prudent,—if she learned something of a faith
that is symbolised by suffering, and the old light softened in |;her
eyes, it did not take the shape of a lesson. A few of the plainer
people had made up a little sum by which the ragged Mliss was
enabled to assume the garments of respect and civilisation ; and
often a rough shake of the hand, and words of homely commen-
dation from a red-shirted and burly figure, sent a glow to the cheek
of the young master, and set him to thinking if it was altogether
deserved.
Three months had passed from the time of then- first meeting,
and the master was sitting late one evening over the moral and
sententious copies, when there came a tap at the door, and again
Mliss stood before him. She was neatly clad and clean faced, and
thex-e was nothing, perhaps, but the long black hair and bright
black eyes to remind him of his former apparition. “ Are you
busy ?” she asked. “ Can you come with me ?”—and on his signi-
fy irg his readiness, in her own wilful way she said, “ Come, then,
quick 1”
They passed out of the door together and into the dark road.
As they entered the town the master asked her whither she was
going. She replied, “To see my father.”
It was the first time he had heard her call him by that filial title,
or indeed anything more than “ Old Smith or the “ Old Man. ’ It
was the first time in three months that she had spoken of him at
all, and the master knew she had kept resolutely aloof from him
since her great change. Satisfied from her manner that it was
fruitless to question her purpose, he passively followed. In out-of-
the-way places, low groggeries, restaurants, and saloons; in
gambling-hells and dance-houses, the master, preceded by Mliss,
came and went. In the reeking smoke and blasphemous outcries
of low dens, the child, holding the master’s hand, stood and
anxiously gazed, seemingly unconscious of all in the one absorbing
nature of her pursuit. Some of the revellers, recognizing Mliss,


called to the child to sing and dance for them, and would have
forced liquor upon her but for the interference of the master.
Others, recognising him mutely made way for them to pass. So
an hour slipped by. Then the child whispered in his ear that
there was a cabin on the other side of the creek crossed by the
long flume, where she thought he might still be. Thither they
crossed, —a toilsome half-hour's walk, but in vain. They were
returning by the ditch at the abutment of the Hume, gazing at the
lights of the town on the opposite bank, when, suddenly, sharply,
a quick report rang out on the clear night air. The echoes caught
it, and carried it round and round lied Mountain, and set the dogs
to barking all along the streams. Lights seemed to dance and
move quickly on the outskirts of the town for a few moments, the
stream rippled quite audibly beside them, a few stones loosened
themselves from the hillside and splashed into the stream, a heavy
wind seemed to surge the branches of the funereal pines, and then
the silence seemed to fall thicker, heavier, and deadlier. The
master turned towards Mliss with an unconscious gesture of pro-
tection, but the child had gone. Oppressed by a strange fear, he
ran quickly down the trail to the river’s bed, and, jumping from
boulder to boulder, reached the bpse of lied Mountain and the
outskirts of the village, Midway of the crossing he looked up and
held his breath in awe. For high above him on the narrow Hume
he saw the fluttering little figure of his late companion crossing
swiftly in the darkness.
He climbed the bank, and, guided by a few lights moving about
a central point on the mountain, soon found himself breathless
among a crowd of awe-stricken and sorrowful men. Out from
among them the child appeared, and, taking the master’s hand,
led him silently before what seemed a ragged hole in the moun-
tain. Her face was quite white, but her excited manner gone,
and her look that of one to whom some long-expected event had at
last happened,—an expression that to the master in his bewilder-
ment seemed almost like relief. The walls of the cavern were
partly propped by decaying timbers. The child pointed to what
appeared to be some ragged, cast-off clothes left in the hole by the
late occupant. The master approached nearer with his flaming
dip, and bent over them. It was Smith, already cold, with a
pistol in his hand and a bullet in his heart, lying beside his empty
pocket.
CHAPTER 11.
The opinion which McSnagley expressed in reference to a
“ change of heart ” supposed to be experienced by Mliss was more
forcibly described in the gulches and tunnels. It was thought
there that Mliss had “struck a good lead.” So when there was
a new grave added to the little enclosure, and at the expense of
the master a little board and inscription put above it, the Red


Mountain Banner came out quite handsomely, and did the fair
thing to the memory of one of “ our oldest Pioneers,” alluding
gracefully to that “bane of noble intellects,” and otherwise gcuteely
shelving our dear brother with the past. “He leaves an only
child to mourn his loss,” says the Banner, “ who is now an
exemplary scholar, thanks to the efforts of the Rev. Mr. McSnagley.”
The Rev. McSnagley, in fact, made a strong point of Mliss’s
conversion, and, indirectly attributing to the unfortunate child the
suicide of her father, made affecting allusions in Sunday school to
the beneficial effects of the “ silent tomb,” and in this cheerful
contemplation drove most of the children into speechless horror,
and caused the pink-and-white scions of the first families to howl
dismally and refuse to be comforted.
The long dry summer came. As each fierce day burned itself
out in little whiffs of pearl-gray smoke on the mountain summits,
and the up-springing breeze scattered its red embers over the
landscape, the green wave which in early spring upheaved above
Smith's grave, grew sere and dry and hard. In those days the
master, strolling in the little churchyard of a Sabbath afternoon,
was sometimes surprised to find a few wild-flowers plucked from
the damp pine-forests scattered there, and oftener rude wreaths
hung upon the little pine cross. Most of these wreaths were
formed of a sweet-scented grass, which the children loved to keep
in their desks, intertwined with the plumes of the buckeye, the
syringa, and the wood-anemone ; and here and there the master
noticed the dark blue cowl of the monk’s-hood, or deadly aconite.
There was something in the odd association of this noxious plant
with these memorials which occasioned a painful sensation to the
master deeper than his aesthetic sense. One day, during a long
walk, in crossing a wooded ridge he came upon Mliss in the heart
of the forest, perched ui>on a prostrate pine, on a fantastic throne
formed by the hanging plumes of lifeless branches, her lap full of
grasses and pine-burrs, and crooning to herself one of the negro
melodies of her younger life. Recognising him at a distance, she
made room for him on her elevated throne, and with a grave
assumption of hospitality and patronage that would have been
ridiculous had it not been so terribly earnest, she fed him with
pine-nuts and crab-apples. The master took that opportunity to
point out to her the noxious and deadly qualities of the monk’s-
hood, whose dark blossoms he saw in her lap, and extorted from
her a promise not to meddle with it as long as she remained his
pupil. This done, —as the master had tested her integrity before,
—he rested satisfied, and the strange feeling which had overcome
him on seeing them died away.
Of the homes that were offered Mliss when her conversion
l>ccamc known, the master preferred that of Mrs. Morpher, a
womanly and kind-hearted specimen of South-western efflorescence,
known in her maidenhood as the “ Pcr-rairie Rose.” Being one of
those who contend resolutely against their own natures, Mrs,


Morpher, by a long series of self-sacrifices and struggles, had at
last subjugated her naturally careless disposition, to principles of
“ order,” which she considered, in common with Mr. Pope, as
Heaven’s first law.” But she could not entirely govern the orbits
of her satellites, however regular her own movements, and even
her own “ Jeemes” sometimes collided with her. Again her old
nature asserted itself in her children. Lycurgus dipped into the
cupboard “ between meals,” and Aristides came home from schdol
without shoes, leaving those important articles on the threshold,
for the delight of a barefooted walk down the ditches. Octavia
and Cassandra were “keeriess” of their clothes. So with but one
exception, however much the “ Prairie Eose” might have trimmed
and pruned and trained her own matured luxuriance, the little
shoots came up defiantly wild and straggling. That one exception
was Clytcmnestra Morpher, aged fifteen. She was the realization
of her mother's immaculate conception,—neat, orderly, and dull.
It was an amiable weakness of Mrs. Morpher to imagine that
“ Clytie” was a consolation and model for Mliss. Following this
fallacy, Mrs. Morpher threw Clytie at the head of Mliss when she
was “ bad,” and set her up before the child for adoration in her
penitential moments. It was not, therefore, surprising to the
master to hear that Clytie was coming to school, obviously as a
favour to the master and as an example for Mliss and others. For
*• Clytie ” was quite a young lady. Inheriting her mother’s physical
peculiarities, and in obedience to the climatic laws of the lied
Mountain region, she was an early bloomer 1 . The youth of Smith’s
Pocket, to whom this kind of flower was rare, sighed for her in
April and languished in May. Enamoured swains haunted the
school-house at the hour of dismissal. A few were jealous of the
master.
Perhaps it was this latter circumstance that opened the master’s
eyes to another. He could not help noticirrg that Clytie was
romantic ; that in school she required a great deal of attention ;
that her pens were uniformly bad and wanted fixing; that she
usually accompanied the request with a certain expectation in her
eye that was somewhat disproportionate to the quality of service
she verbally required ; that she sometimes allowed the curves of a
round, plump white arm to rest on his when he was writing her
copies ; that she always blushed and flung back her blonde curls
when she did so. I don’t remember whether I have stated that
the master was a young man, —it’s of little consequence, however;
he had been severely educated in the school in which Clytie was
taking her first lesson, and, on the whole, withstood the flexible
curves and factitious glance like the fine young Spartan that he
was. Perhaps an insufficient quality of food may have tended to
this asceticism. He generally avoided Clytie ; but one evening,
when she retunred to the school-house after something she had
forgotten, and did not find it until the master walked home with
her 1 , I hear 1 that he endeavoured to make himself particularly


agreeable,—partly from the fact, I imagine, that his conduct was
adding gall and bitterness to the already overcharged hearts of
Clytemnestra’s admirers.
The morning after this affecting episode Mliss did not come to
school. Noon came, but not Mliss. Questioning Clytie on the
subject, it appeared that they had left the school together, but the
willful Mliss had taken another road. The afternoon brought her
not. In the evening he called on Mrs. Morpher, whose motherly
heart was really alarmed. Mr. Morpher had spent all day in
search of her, without discovering a trace that might lead to
her discovery. Aristides was summoned as a probable accomplice,
but that equitable infant succeeded in impressing the household
with his innocence. Mrs. Morpher entertained a vivid impression
that the child would yet be found drowned in a ditch, or, what
was almost as terrible, muddied and soiled beyond the redemption
of soap and water. Sick at heart, the master returned to the
school-house. As he lit his lamp and seated himself at his ‘desk,
he found a note lying before him addressed to himself, in Mliss’s
handwriting. It seemed to be written on a leaf torn from some
old memorandum-book, and, to prevent sacrilegious trifling, had
been sealed with six broken wafers. Opening it almost tenderly,
the master read as follows :
Respected Sib, —When you read this, lam run away. Never
to come back. Never , Nevek, NEVER. You can give my
beeds to Mary Jennings, and my Amerika’s Pride [a highly
coloured lithograph from a tobacco-box] to Sally Flanders. But
don’t you give anything to Clytie Morpher. Don’t you dare to.
Do you know what my oppinion is of her, it is this, she is pcrfekly
disgustin. That is all and no more at present from
Yours respectfully,
Melissa Smith.
The master sat pondering on this strange epistle till the moon
lifted its bright face above the distant hills, and illuminated the
trail that led to the school-house, beaten quite hard with the
coming and going of little feet. Then, more satisfied in mind, he
tore the missive into fragments and scattered them along the
road.
At sunrise the next morning he was picking his way through
the palm-like fern and thick under-brush of the pine-forest,
starting the hare from its form, and awakening a querulous protest
from a few dissipated crows, who had evidently been making a
night of it, and so came to the wooded ridge where he had once
found Mliss. Thei-e he found the prostrate pine and tasselled
branches, but the throne was vacant. As he drew nearer, what
might have been some frightened animal started through the
crackling limbs. It ran up the tossed arms of the fallen monarch,
and sheltered itself in some friendly foliage. The master, reaching
the old seat, found the nest still warm ; looking up in the inter*


twining branches, be met the black eyes of the errant Mliss. They
gazed at each other without speaking. She was first to break the
silence.
“ What do you want 7 ” she asked curtly.
The master had decided on a course of action, “ I want some
crab-apples,” he said humbly.
“ Sha’ n’t have ’em ! go away. Why don’t you get ’em of
Clytemnerestera ? ” (It seemed to be a relief to Mliss to express
her contempt in additional syllables to that classical young
woman’s already long-drawn title.) “ 0 you wicked thing ! ”
“ I am hungry, Lissy. I have eaten nothing since dinner
yesterday. lam famished!” and the young man in a state of
remarkable exhaustion leaned against the tree.
Melissa’s heart was touched. In the bitter days of her gipsy
life she had known the sensation he so artfully simulated. Over-
come by his heartbroken tone, but not entirely divested of
suspicion, she said, —
“ Dig under the tree near the roots, and you T 1 find lots ; but
mind you don’t tell,” for Mliss had her hoards as well as the rats
and squirrels.
But the master, of course, was unable to find them ; the effects
of hunger probably blinding his senses. Mliss grew uneasy. At
length she peered at him through the leaves in an elfish way, and
questioned,—
“ If I come down and give you some, you ’ll promise you won’t
touch me 7”
The master promised,
“ Hope you ’ll die if you do ! ”
The master accepted instant dissolution as a forfeit. Mliss slid
down the tree. For a few moments nothing transpired but the
munching of the pine-nuts. “Do you feel better ? ” she asked,
with some solicitude. The master confessed to a recuperated
feeling, and then, gravely thanking her, proceeded to retrace his
steps. As he expected, he had not gone far before she called him.
He turned. She was standing there quite white, with tears in her
widely opened orbs. The master felt that the right moment had
come. Going up to her, he took both her hands, and looking in
her tearful eyes, said, gravely, “ Lissy, do you remember the first
evening you came to see me 7”
Lissy remembered.
“ You asked me if you might come to school, for you wanted to
learn something and be better, and I said—”
“ Come,” responded the child, promptly.
“ What would you say if the master now came to you and said
that he was lonely without his little scholar, and that he wanted
her to come and teach him to be better 7”
The child hung her head for a few moments in silence. The
master waited patiently. Tempted by the quiet, a hare ran close
to the couple, and raising her bright eyes and velvet forepaws, sat


and gazed at them. A squirrel ran half-way down the furrowed
bark of the fallen tree, and there stopped.
“ We are waiting, Lissy,” said the master, in a whisper, and the
child smiled. Stirred by a passing breeze, the tree-tops rocked,
and a long pencil of light stole through their interlaced boughs
full on the doubting face and irresolute little figure. Suddenly
she took the master’s hand in her quick way. What she said was
scarcely audible, but the master, putting the black hair back from
her forehead, kissed her; and so, hand in hand, they passed out of
the damp aisles and forest odours into the open sunlit road.
CHAPTER 111.
Somewhat less spiteful in her intercourse with other scholars,
Mliss still retained an offensive attitude in regard to Clytemnestra.
Perhaps the jealous element was not entirely lulled in her
passionate little breast. Perhaps it was only that the round
curves and plump outline offered more extended pinching surface.
But while such ebullitions were under the master’s control, her
enmity occasionally took anew and irrepressible form.
The master in his first estimate of the child’s character could
not conceive that she had ever possessed a doll. But the master,
like many other professed readers of character, was safer in
a posteriori than a priori reasoning. Mliss had a doll, but then it
was emphatically Mliss’s doll, —a smaller copy of herself. Its
unhappy existence had been a secret discovered accidentally by
Mrs. Morpher. It had been the old-time companion of Mliss’s
wanderings, and bore evident marks of suffering. Its original
complexion was long since washed away by the weather and
anointed by the slime of ditches. It looked very much as Mliss
had in days past. Its one gown of faded stuff was dirty and
ragged as hers had been. Mliss had never been known to apply
to it any childish term of endearment. She never exhibited it in
the presence of other children. It was put severely to bed in a
hollow tree near the school-house, and only allowed exercise
during Mllss’s rambles. Fulfilling a stern duty to her doll, as she
would to herself, it knew no luxuries.
Now r Mrs. Morpher, obeying a commendable impulse, bought
another doll and gave it to Mliss. The child received it gravely
and curiously. The master on looking at it one day fancied he
saw a slight resemblance in its round red cheeks and mild blue
eyes to Clytemnestra. It became evident before long that Mliss
had also noticed the same resemblance. Accordingly she
hammered its waxen head on the rocks when she was alone, and
sometimes dragged it with a string round its neck to and from
school. At other times, setting it up on her desk, she made a pin-
cushion of its patient and inoffensive body. Whether this was
done in revenge of what she considered a second figurative


obtrusion of Clyde’s excellencies upon her, or whether she had
an intuitive appreciation of the rites of certain other heathens,
and, indulging in that “ Fetish ” ceremony, imagined that the
original of her wax model would pine away and finally die, is a
metaphysical question I shall not now consider.
In spite of these moral vagaries, the master could not help
noticing in her different tasks the working of a quick, restless, and
vigorous perception. She knew neither the hesitancy nor the
doubts of childhood. Her answers in class were always slightly
dashed with audacity. Of course she was not infallible. But her
courage and daring in passing beyond her own depth and that of
the floundering little swimmers around her, in their minds
outweighed all errors of judgment. Children are not better than
grown people in this respect, I fancy ; and whenever the little red
hand flashed above her desk, there was a wondering silence, and
even the master was sometimes oppressed with a doubt of his own
experience and judgment.
Nevertheless, certain attributes which at first amused and
entertained his fancy began to afflict him with grave doubts. He
could not but see that Mliss was revengeful, irreverent, and wilful.
That there was but one better quality which pertained to her semi-
savage disposition,—the faculty of physical fortitude and self-
sacrifice. and another, though not always an attribute of the noble
savage—Truth. Mliss was both fearless and sincere ; perhaps in
such a character the adjectives were synonymous.
The master had been doing some hard thinking on this subject,
and had arrived at that conclusion quite common to all who think
sincerely, that he was generally the slave of his own prejudices,
when he determined to call on the Rev. McSnagley for advice.
This decision was somewhat humiliating to his pride, as he and
McSnagley were not friends. But he thought of Mliss, and the
evening of their first meeting ; and perhaps with a pardonable
superstition that it was not chance alone that had guided her
willful feet to the school-house, and perhaps with a complacent
consciousness of the rare magnanimity of the act, he choked back
his dislike and went to McSnagley.”
The reverend gentleman was glad to see him. Moreover, he
observed that the master was looking “peartish,” and hoped he
had got over the “ neuralgy ” and “ rheumatiz.” He himself had
been troubled with a dumb “ager” since last conference. But he
had learned to “ rastle and pray.”
Pausing a moment to enable the master to write his certain
method of curing the dumb “ ager” upon the book and volume of
his brain, Mr. McSnagley proceeded to inquire after Sister
Morpher. 11 She is an adornment to Christianity, and has a
likely growhT young family,” added Mr. McSnagley; ‘"and there’s
that mannerly young gal,—so ■well behaved, —Miss Clyde.” In
fact. Clytie’s perfections seemed to affect him to such an extent
that he dwelt for several minutes upon them. The master was


doubly embarrassed. In the first place, there was an enforced
contrast with poor Mliss in all this praise of Clyde. Secondly,
there was something unpleasantly confidential in his tone of
speaking of Mrs. Morpher’s earliest born. So that the master, after
a few futile efforts to say something natural, found it convenient to
recall another engagement, and left without asking the information
required, but in his after reflections somewhat unjustly giving the
Rev. Mr. McSnagley the full benefit of having refused it.
Perhaps this rebuff placed the master and pupil once more in
the close communion of old. The child seemed to notice the
change in the master’s manner, which had of. late been con-
strained, and in one of their long post-prandial walks she stopped
suddenly, and, mounting a stump, looked full in his face with big,
searching eyes. “ You ain’t mad?” said she, with an interrogative
shake of the black braids. “ No.” “ Nor bothered ?” “ No.”
“ Nor hungry ?” (Hunger was to Mliss a sickness that might attack
a person at any moment.) “ No.” “ Nor thinking of her ?” “Of
whom, Lissy 7” “ That white girl.” (This was the latest epithet
invented by Mliss, who was a very dark brunette, to express Cly-
teranestra.) “ No.” “ Upon your word ?” (A substitute for
“ Hope you T 1 die !” proposed by the master.) “ Yes.” “ And sacred
honour ? ” “ Yes.” Then Mliss gave him a fierce little kiss, and,
hopping down, fluttered off. For two or three days after that she
condescended to appear more like other children, and be, as she
expressed it, “ good.”
Two years had passed since the master’s advent at Smith's
Pocket, and as his salary was not large, and the prospects of
Smith’s Pocket eventually becoming the capital of the State not
entirely definite, he contemplated a change. He had informed the
school trustees privately of his intentions, but, educated young men
of unblemished moral character being scarce at that time, he con-
sented to continue his school term through the winter to earlyspring.
None else knew of his intention except hisonc friend, a Dr. Duchesne,
a young Creole physician known to the people of Wingdam as
“ Duchesny.” He never mentioned it to Mrs. Morpher, Clytie, or
any of his scholars. His reticence was partly the result of a con-
stitutional indisposition to fuss, partly a desire to be spared the
questions and surmises of vulgar curiosity, and partly that he never
really believed he was going to do anything before it was done.
He did not like to think of Mliss. It was a selfish instinct,
perhaps, which made him try to fancy his feeling for the child, was
foolish, romantic, and unpractical. He even tried to imagine that
she would do better under the control of an older and sterner
teacher. Then she was nearly eleven, and in a few years, by
the rules of Red Mountain, would be a woman. He had
done his duty. After Smith’s death, he addressed letters to
Smith’s relatives, and received one answer from a sister of Melissa’s
mother. Thanking the master, she stated her intention of leaving
the Atlantic States for California with her husband in a few


months. This was a slight superstructure for the airy castle which
the master pictured for Mliss’s home, but it was easy to fancy that
some loving, sympathetic woman, with the claims of kindred,
might better guide her wayward nature. Yet, when the master
had read the letter, Mliss listened to it carelessly, received it sub-
missively, and afterwards cut figures out of it with her scissors,
supposed to represent Clytemnestra, labelled “ the white girl,” to
prevent mistakes, and impaled them upon the outer walls of the
school-house.
When the summer was about spent, and the last harvest had
been gathered in the valleys, the master bethought him of gather-
ing in a few ripened shoots of the young idea, and of having his
Harvest Home, or Examination. So the savans and professionals
of Smith’s Pocket were gathered to witness that time-honoured
custom of placing timid children in a constrained position, and
bullying them as in a witness-box. As usual in such cases, the
most audacious and self-possessed were the lucky recipients of the
honours. The reader will imagine that in the present instance
Mliss and Clytie were pre-eminent, and divided public attention ;
Mliss with her clearness of material perception and self-reliance,
Clytie with her placid self-esteem and saint-like correctness of
deportment. The other little ones were timid and blundering.
Mliss’s readiness and brilliancy, of course, captivated the greatest
number and provoked the greatest applause, Mliss’s antecedents
had unconsciously awakened the strongest sympathies of a class
whose athletic forms were ranged against the walls, or whose
handsome bearded faces looked in at the windows. But Mliss’s
popularity was overthrown by an unexpected circumstance.
McSnagley had invited himself, and had been going through
the pleasing entertainment of frightening the more timid pupils by
the vaguest and most ambiguous questions delivered in an im-
pressive funereal tone; and Mliss had soared into Astronomy,
and was tracking the course of our spotted ball through space,
and keeping time with the music of the spheres, and defining the
tethered orbits of the planets, when McSnagley impressively arose,
“ Meelissy ! ye were speaking of the revolutions of this yere
yearth and the mo ve-ments of the sun, and I think ye said it had
been a doing of it since the creashun, eh ? ” Mliss nodded a scorn-
ful affirmative. “Well, war that the truth?” said McSnagley,
folding his arms. “ Yes,” said Mliss, shutting up her little red
lips tightly. The handsome outlines at the windows peered fur-
ther into the schoolroom, and a saintly Raphael face, with blonde
beard and soft blue eyes, belonging to the biggest scamp in the
diggings, turned towards the child and whispered, “ Stick to it,
Mliss 1 ” The reverend gentleman heaved a deep sigh, and cast a
compassionate glance at the master, then at the children, and then
rested his look on Clytie. That young woman softly elevated her
round, white arm. Its seductive curves were enhanced by a gor-
geous and massive specimen bracelet, the gift of one of her


humblest worshippers, worn in honor of the occasion. There was
a momentary silence. Clytie’s round cheeks were very pink
and soft. Clytie’s big eyes were very bright and blue. Olytie’s
low-necked white book-muslin rested softly on Clytie’s white,
plump shoulders. Clytie looked at the master, and the master-
nodded. Then Clytie spoke softly :
“ Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and it obeyed
him! ” There was a low hum of applause in the school-room, a
triumphant expression on McSnagley’s face, a grave shadow on
the master’s, and a comical look of disappointment reflected from
the windows. Mliss skimmed rapidly over her Astronomy, and
then shut the book with a loud snap. A groan burst from
Mcßnagley. an expression of astonishment from the school-room,
a yell from the windows, as Mliss brought her red fist down on the
desk, with the emphatic declaration, —
“ It’s a d n lie. I don’t believe it! ”
CHAPTER IV.
The long wet season had drawn near its close. Signs of spring
were visible in the swelling buds and rushing torrents. The pine-
forests exhaled the fresher spicery. The azaleas were already
budding, the Ceanothus getting ready its lilac livery for
spring. On the green upland which climbed red Mountain at its
southern aspect the long spike of the monk’s-hood shot up from its
broad-leaved stool, and once more shook its dark-blue bells.
Again the billow above Smith’s grave was soft and green, its crest
just tossed with the foam of daisies and buttercups. The little
graveyard had gathered a few new dwellers in the past year, and
the mounds were placed two by two by the little paling until they
reached Smith's grave, and there there was but one. General super-
stition had shunned it, and the plot beside Smith was vacant. _
There had been several placards posted about the town, inti-
mating that, at a certain period, a celebrated dramatic company
would perform, for a few days, a series of “ side-splitting and
41 screaming farces ” ; that, alternating pleasantly with this, there
would be some melodrama and a grand divertisement, which would
include singing, dancing, etc. These announcements occasioned
a great fluttering among the little folk, and were the theme of
much excitement and great speculation among the master’s
scholars. The master had promised Mliss, to whom this sort of
thing was sacred and rare, that she should go, and on that
momentous evening the master and Mliss “ assisted.’
The performance was the prevalent style of heavy mediocrity ;
the melodrama was not bad enough to laugh at nor good enough
to excite. But the master, turning wearily to the child, was
astonished, and felt something like self-accusation in noticing the
peculiar effect upon her excitable nature. The red blood flushed


in lier cheeks at each stroke of her panting little heart. Her
small passionate lips were slightly parted to give vent to her
hurried breath. Her widely opened lids threw up and arched her
black eyebrows. She did not laugh at the dismal comicalities of
the funny man, for Mliss seldom laughed. Nor was she discreetly
affected to the delicate extremes of the corner of a white handker-
chief, as was the tender-hearted “Clytie,” who was talking with
her “ feller” and ogling the master at the same moment. But
when the performance was over, and the green curtain fell on the
little stage, Mliss drew a long deep breath, and turned to the
master’s grave face with a half-apologetic smile and wearied
gesture. Then she said, “ Now take me home ! ” and dropped
the lids of her black eyes, as if to dwell once more in fancy on the
mimic stage.
On their way to Mrs. Morpher’s the master thought proper to
ridicule the whole performance. Now he shouldn’t wonder if
Mliss thought that the young lady who acted so beautifully was
really in earnest, and in love with the gentleman who wore such
fine clothes. Well, if she were in love with him it was a very
unfortunate thing ! “ Why ? ” said Mliss, with an upward sweep
of the drooping lid. “Oh I well, he could n’t supjwrt his wife at
his present salary, and pay so much a week for his fine clothes,
and then they wouldn't receive as much wages if they were
married as if they were merely lovers, —that is,” added the
master, “ if they are not already married to somebody else ; but I
think the husband of the pretty young countess takes the tickets
at the door, or pulls up the curtain, or snuffs the candles, or does
something equally refined and elegant. As to the young man
with nice clothes, which are really nice now, and must cost at
least two and a half or three dollars, not to speak of that mantle
of red drugget which I happen to know the price of, for I bought
some of it for my room once, —as to this young man, Ifissy, he is a
pretty good fellow, and if he does drink occasionally, I don’t
think people ought to take advantage of it and give him black
eyes and throw him in the mud. Do you ? I am sure he might
owe me two dollars and a half a long time, before I would
throw it up in his face, as the fellow did the other night at
Wingdam.”
Mliss had taken his hand in both of hem and was trying to look
in his eyes, which the young man kept as resolutely averted. Mliss
had a faint idea of irony, indulging herself sometimes in a species
of sardonic humour, which was equally visible in her actions and
her speech. But the young man continued in this strain until they
had reached Mrs. Morpher’s, and he had deposited Mliss in her ma-
ternal charge. Waiving the invitation of Mrs. Morpher to refresh-
ment and rest, and shading his eyes with his hand to keep out the
blue-eyed Clytemuestra’s siren glances, he excused himself, and
went home.
For two or three days after the advent of the dramatic company,


Mliss was late at school, and the masters usual Friday afternoon
ramble was for once omitted, owing to the absence of his trust-
worthy guide. As he was putting away his books and preparing
to leave the school-house, a small voice piped at his side, “ Please,
sir ? ” The master turned, and there stood Aristides Morpher.
“ Well, my little man,” said the master, impatiently, “ what is
it ? quick 1 ”
“ Please, sir, me and ‘ Kerg’ thinks that Mliss is going to run
away agin.”
“What’s that, sir?” said the master, with that unjust testiness
with which we always receive disagreeable news.
“ Why, sir, she don’t stay home any more, and ‘ Kerg’ and me
see her talking with one of those actor fellers, and she’s with him
now ; and please, sir, yesterday she told ‘ Kerg’ and me she could
make a speech as well as Miss Cellerstina Montmoressy, and she
spouted right off by heart,” and the little fellow paused in a col-
lapsed condition.
“ What actor ?” asked the master.
“ Him as wears the shiny hat. And hair. And gold pin. And
gold chain,” said the just Aristides, putting periods for commas to
eke out his breath. .
The master put on his gloves and hat, feeling an unpleasant
tightness in his chest and thorax, and walked out in the road.
Aristides trotted along by his side, endeavouring to keep pace
with his short legs to the master’s strides, when the master stopped
suddenly, and Aristides bumped up against him. “ Where were
they talking ?” asked the master, as if continuing the conversation.
“ At the Arcade,” said Aristides.
When they reached the main street the master paused. “ Run
■down home,” said he to the boy. “If Mliss is there, come to the
Arcade and tell me. If she is n’t there, stay home ; run ! ” And
off trotted the short-legged Aristides.
The Arcade was just across the way,—a long rambling building
containing a bar-room, billiard room, and restaurant. As the
young man crossed the plaza he noticed that two or three of the
passers-by turned and looked after him. He looked at his clothes,
took out his handkerchief and wiped his face, before he entered
the bar-room. It contained the usual number of loungers, who
stared at him as he entered. One of them looked at him so fixedly
and with such a strange expression that the master stopped and
looked again, and then saw it was only his own reflection in a
large mirror. This made the master think that perhaps he was
a little excited, and so he took up a copy of the Red Mountain
Banner from one of the tables, and tried to recover his composure
by reading the column of advertisements.
He then walked through the bar-room, through the restaurant
and into the billiard room. The child was not there. In the
latter apartment a person was standing by one of the tables with
a broad-brimmed glazed hat on his head. The master recognised


him as the agent of the dramatic company ; he had taken a dislike
to him at their first meeting, from the peculiar fashion of wearing
his beard and hair. Satisfied that the object of his search was
not there, he turned to the man with a glazed hat. He had
noticed the master, but tried that common trick of unconscious-
ness, in which vulgar natures always fail. Balancing a billiard-
cue in his hand, he pretended to play with a ball in the centre
of the table. The master stood opposite to him until he raised his
eyes ; when their glances met, the master walked up to him.
He had intended to avoid a scene or quarrel, but when he
began to speak, something kept rising in his throat and retarded
his utterance, and his own voice frightened him, it sounded so
■distant, low, and resonant. “ I understand,” he began, “ that
Melissa Smith, an orphan, and one of my scholars, has talked with
you about adopting your profession. Is that so ? ”
The man with the glazed hat leaned over the table made an
imaginary shot, that sent the ball spinning round the cushions.
Then walking round the table he recovered the ball and placed it
upon the spot. This duty discharged, getting ready for another
shot, he said, —
“ S’pose she has ? ”
The master choked up again, but, squeezing the cushion of the
table in his gloved hand, he went on :
“ If you are a gentleman, I have only to tell you that I am her
guardian, and responsible for her career. You know as well as I
do the kind of life you offer her; As you may learn of any one
here, I have already brought her out of an existence worse than
death, —out of the streets and the contamination of vice. lam
trying to do so again. Let us talk like men. She has neither
fathet, mother, sister, or brother. Are you seeking to give her an
equivalent for these ? ”
The man with the glazed hat examined the point of his cue, and
then looked around for somebody to enjoy the joke with him.
“ I know that she is a strange, wilful girl,” continued the mas-
ter, “ but she is better than she was. I believe that I have some
influence over her still. I beg and hope, therefore, that you will
take no further steps in this matter, but as a man, as a gentleman,
leave her to me. lam willing—” But here something rose again
in the master’s throat, and the sentence remained unfinished.
The man with the glazed hat, mistaking the master’s silence,
raised his head with a coarse, brutal laugh, and said in a loud
voice,—
“ Want her yourself, do you ? That cock won’t fight here,
young man! ”
The insult was more in the tone than the words, more in the
glance than tone, and more in the man’s instinctive nature than
all these. The best appreciable rhetoric to this kind of animal is
a blow. The master felt this, and, with his pent-up, nervous
energy finding expression in the one act, he struck the brute full


in his grinning face. The blow sent the glazed hat one way and
the cue another, and tore the glove and skin from the master’s hand
from knuckle to joint. It opened up the corners of the fellow’s
month, and spoilt the peculiar shape of his beard for some time
to come.
There was a shout, an imprecation, a scuffle, and the trampling
of many feet. Then the crowd parted right and left, and two
sharp quick reports followed each other in rapid succession. Then
they closed again about his opponent, and the master was standing
alone. He remembered picking bits of burning wadding from his
coat-sleeve with his left hand. Some one was holding his other
hand. Looking at it, he saw it was still bleeding from the blow,
but his lingers were clenched around the handle of a glittering
knife. He could not remember when or how he got it.
The man who was holding his hand was Mr. Morpher. He
hurried the master to the door, but the master held back, and
tried to tell him as well as he could with his parched throat about
“ Mliss.” “ It’s all right, my boy,” said Mr. Morpher. “ She’s
home ! ” And they passed out into the street together. As they
walked along Mr. Morpher said that Mliss had come running into
the house a few moments before, and had dragged him out, saying
that somebody was trying to kill the master at the Arcade.
Wishing to be alone, the master promised Mr. Morpher that he
would not seek the Agent again that night, and parted from him,
taking the road toward the school-house. He was surprised in
nearing it to find the door open, —still more surprised to find Mliss
sitting there.
The master’s nature, as I have hinted before, had, like most
sensitive organizations, a selfish basis. The brutal taunt thrown
out by his late adversary still rankled in his heart. Iff was
possible, he thought, that such a construction might be put upon
his affection for the child, which at best was foolish and Quixotic.
Besides, had she not voluntarily abnegated his authority and
affection ? And what had everybody else said about her ? Why
should he alone combat the opinion of all, and be at last obliged
tacitly to confess the truth of all they had predicted ? And he
had been a participant in a low bar-room fight with a common
boor, and risked his life, to prove what ? What had he proved ?
Nothing ? What would the people say ? What would his friends
say ? What would McSnagley say 1
In his self-accusation the last person he should have wished to
meet was Mliss. He entered the door, and, going up to his desk,
told the child, in a few cold words, that he was busy, and wished
to be alone. As she rose he took her vacant seat, and, sitting
down, buried his head in his hands. When he looked up again
she was still standing there.. She was looking at his face with an
anxious expression.
“ Did you kill him ? ” she asked.
“ No. ” said the master.


“ That’s what I gave you the knife for! ” said the child,
quickly.
“ Gave me the knife ? ” repeated the master, in bewilderment.
“ Yes, gave you the knife. I was there under the bar. Saw
you hit him. Saw you both fall. He dropped his old knife. I
gave it to you. Why did n’t you stick him ? ” said Mliss rapidly,
with an expressive twinkle of the black eyes and a gesture of the_
little red hand.
The master could only look his astonishment.
“ Yes,” said Mliss. “If you’d asked me, I’d told you I was off
with the play-actors. Why was I off with the play-actors ?
Because you would n’t tell me you was going away. I knew it. I
heard you tell the Doctor so. I was n’t a goin’ to stay here alone
with those Morphers. I’d rather die first.”
With a dramatic gesture which was perfectly consistent with
her character, she drew from her bosom a few limp green leaves,
and holding them out at arm’s-length, said in her quick vivid way,
and in the queer pronunciation of her old life, which she fell into
when unduly excited, —
“ That’s the poison plant you said would kill me. lil go
with the play-actors, or lil eat this and die here. I don’t care
which. I won’t stay here, where they hate and despise me 1
Neither would you let me, if you did n’t hate and despise me
too 1 ”
The passionate little breast heaved, and two big tears peeped
over the edge of Mliss’s eyelids, but she whisked them away with
the comer of her apron as if they had been wasps.
“If you lock me up in jail,” said Mliss, fiercely, “to keep me
from the play-actors, lil poison myself. Father killed himself, —
why should n’t I ? You said a mouthful of that root would kill
me, and I always carry it here,” and she struck her breast with
her clenched fist.
The master thought of the vacant plot beside Smith’s grave,
and of the passionate little figure before him. Seizing her hands
in his and looking full into her truthful eyes, he said, —
“ Lissy, will you go with me?"
The child put her arms around his neck, and said joyfully, “Yes.”
“ But now—to-night ?”
“ To-night.”
And, hand in hand, they passed into the road, —the narrow road
that had once brought her weary feet to the master’s door, and
which it seemed she should not tread again alone. The stars
glittered brightly above them. For good or ill the lesson had been
learned, and behind them the school of Red Mountain closed
upon them for ever.


THE RIGHT EYE OF THE COMMANDER.
The year of grace 1797 passed away on the coast of Calfornia in
a southwesterly gale. The little bay of San Carlos, albeit shel-
tered by the headlands of the blessed Trinity, was rough and
turbulent; its foam clung quivering to the seaward wall of the
mission garden ; the air was filled with flying sand and spume, and
as the Senor Comandante, Hermenegildo Salvatierra, looked from
the deep embrasured window of the Presidio guard-room, he felt
the salt breath of the distant sea buffet a colour into his smoke-
dried cheeks.
The Commander, I have said, was gazing thoughtfully from the
window of the guard-room. He may have been reviewing the
events of the year now about to pass away. But, like the garrison
at the Presidio, there was little to review ; the year, like its pre-
decessors, had been uneventful, —the days had slipped by in a
delicious monotony of simple duties, unbroken by incident or
interruption. The regularly recurring feasts and saints’ days, the
half-yearly courier from San Diego, the rare transport-ship and
rarer foreign vessel, were the mere details of his patriarchal life.
If there was no achievement, there was certainly no failure.
Abundant harvests and patient industry amply supplied the wants
of Presidio and Mission. Isolated from the family of nations, the
wars which shook the world concerned them not so much as the
last earthquake; the struggle that emancipated their sister
colonies on the other side of the continent to them had no sug-
gestiveness. In short, it was that glorious Indian summer of
California history, around which so much poetical haze still
lingers,—that bland, indolent autumn of Spanish rule, so soon to
be followed by the wintry storms of Mexican independence and
the reviving spring of American conquest.
The Commander turned from the window and walked toward
the 'fire that burned brightly on the deep oven-like hearth. A pile
of copy-books, the work of the Presidio school, lay on the table.
As he turned over the leaves with a paternal interest, and surveyed
the fair round Scripture text, —the first pious pot-hooks of the
pupils of San Carlos, —an audible commentary fell from his lips :
“ ‘ Abimelech took her from Abraham ’ —ah, little one, excellent ?
—‘ Jacob sent to see his brother ’ —body of Christ 1 that up-stroke
of thine, Paquita, is marvellous ; the Governor shall see it! ” A
film of honest pride dimmed the Commander’s left eye,—-the right,
alas I twenty years before had been sealed by an Indian arrow.
He rubbed it softly with the sleeve of his leather jacket, and
continued :“ ‘ The Ishmaelites having arrived —’ ”
He stopped, for there was a step in the court-yard, a foot upon


the threshold, and a stranger entered. With the instinct of an
old soldier, the Commander, after one glance at the intruder,
turned quickly toward the wall, where his trusty Toledo hung, or
should have been hanging. But it was not there, and as he
recalled that the last time he had seen that weapon it was being
ridden up and down the gallery by Pepito, the infant son of
Bautista, the tortilio-maker, he blushed, and then contented himself
with frowning upon the intruder.
But the stranger’s air, though irreverent, was decidedly peaceful.
He was unarmed, and wore the ordinary cape of tarpauling and
sea-boots of a mariner. Except a villainous smell of codfish, there
was little about him that was peculiar.
His name, as he informed the Commander, in Spanish that was
more fluent than elegant or precise,—his name was Peleg Scudder.
He was master of the schooner “ General Court,” of the port of
iSalcm, in Massachusetts, on a trading-voyage to the South Seas,
but now driven by stress of weather into the bay of San Carlos.
He begged permission to ride out the gale under the headlands of
the blessed Trinity, and no more. Water he did not need, having
taken in a supply at Bodega. He knew the strict surveillance of
the Spanish port regulations in regard to foreign vessels, and
would do nothing against the severe discipline and good order of
the settlement. There was a slight tinge of sarcasm in his tone
as he glanced towards the desolate parade-ground of the Presidio
and the open unguarded gate. The fact was that the sentiy,
Felipe Gomez, had discreetly retired to shelter at the beginning of
the storm, and was then sound asleep in the corridor.
The Commander hesitated. The port regulations were severe,
but he was accustomed to exercise individual authority, and beyond
an old order issued ten years before, regarding the American ship,
“ Columbia,” there was no precedent to guide him. The storm
was severe, and a sentiment of humanity urged him to grant the
stranger’s request. It is but just to the Commander to say, that
his inability to enforce a refusal did not weigh with his decision.
He would have denied with equal disregard of consequences that
right to a seventy-four gun ship which he now yielded so
gracefully to this Yankee trading schooner. He stipulated only,
that there should be no communication between the ship and
shore. “ For yourself, Senor Captain,” he continued, “ accept my
hospitality. The fort is yours as long as you shall grace it with
your distinguished presenceand with old fashioned courtesy,
he made the semblance of withdrawing from the guard-room.
Master Peleg Scudder smiled as he thought of the half dis-
mantled fort, the two mouldy brass cannon, cast in Manilla a cen-
tury previous, and the shiftless garrison. A wild thought of
accepting the Commander’s offer literally, conceived in the reckless
spirit of a man who never let slip an offer for trade, for a moment
filled his brain, but a timely reflection of the commercial unim-
portance of the transaction checked him. He only took a capa-


cious quid of tobacco, as the Commander gravely drew a settle
before the fire, and in honour of his guest untied the black silk
handkerchief that bound his grizzled brows.
What passed between Salvatierra and his guest that night it
becomes me not, as a gr%ye chronicler of the salient points of
history, to relate. I have said that Master Peleg Scudder was a
fluent talker, and under the influence of divers strong waters,
furnished by his host, he became still more loquacious. And think
of a man with twenty years’ budget of gossip ! The Commander
learned, for the first time, how Great Britain lost her colonies ; of
the French Revolution ; of the great Napoleon, whose achieve-
ments, perhaps, Peleg coloured more highly than the Commander’s
superiors would have liked. And when Peleg turned questioner,
the Commander was at his mercy. He gradually made himself
master of the gossip of the Mission and Presidio ; the “ small
beer” chronicles of that pastoral age, the conversion of the heathen,
the Presidio schools, and even asked the Commander how he had
lost his eye! It is said that at this point of the conversation
Master Peleg produced from about his person divers small trinkets,
kick-shaws, and new-fangled trifles, and even forced some of them
upon his host. It is further alleged that under the malign influence
of Peleg and several glasses of aguardiente, the Commander lost
somewhat of his decorum, and behaved in a manner unseemly for
one in his position, reciting high-flown Spanish poetry, and even
piping in a thin, high voice, divers madrigals and heathen canzo-
nets, of an amorous complexion ; chiefly in regard to a “little one,”
who was his, the Commander’s, “ soul” 1 These allegations, per-
haps unworthy the notice of a serious chronicler, should be
received with great caution, and are introduced here as simple
hearsay. That the Commander, however, took a handkerchief and
attempted to show his guest the mysteries of the sembi cuacua ,
capering in an agile but indecorous manner about the apartment,
has been denied. Enough for the purposes of this narrative,
that at midnight Peleg assisted his host to bed with many protes-
tations of undying friendship, and then, as the gale had abated,
took his leave of the Presidio and hurried aboard the “ General
Court.” When the day broke the ship was gone.
I know not if Peleg kept his word with his host. It is said
that the holy fathers at the Mission that night heard a loud
chanting in the plaza, as of the heathens singing psalms through
their noses ; that for many days after an odour of salt codfish pre-
vailed in the settlement ; that a dozen hard nutmegs, which were
unfit for spice or seed, were found in the possession of the wife of
the baker, and that several bushels of shoe-pegs, which bore a
pleasing resemblance to oats, but were quite inadequate to the
purposes of provender, were discovered in the stable of the black-,
smith. But when the reader reflects upon the sacredness of a
Yankee trader’s word, the stringent discipline of the Spanish port
regulations, and the proverbial indisposition of my countrymen to


impose upon the confidence of a simple people, he will at once
reject this part of the story.
A roll of drums, ushering in the year 1798, awoke the Com-
mander. The sun was shining brightly, and the storm had ceased.
He sat up in bed, and through the force of habit rubbed his left
eye. As the remembrance of the previous night came back to
him, he jumped from his couch and ran to the window. There
was no ship in the bay. A sudden thought seemed to strike hind,
and he rubbed both his eyes. Not content with this, he consulted
the metallic mirror which hung beside his crucifix. There was
no mistake ; the Commander had a visible second eye,—a right
one, —as good, save for the purposes of vision, as the left.
Whatever might have been the true secret of this transforma-
tion, but one opinion prevailed at Han Carlos. It was one of those rare
miracles vouchsafed a pious* Catholic community as an evidence
to the heathen, through the intercession of the blessed San Carlos
himself. That their beloved Commander, the temporal defender
of the Faith, should be the recipient of this miraculous mani-
festation was most fit and seemly. The Commander himself was
reticent; he could not tell a falsehood, —he dared not tell the
truth. After all, if the good folk of San Carlos believed that the
powers of his right eye were actually restored, was it wise and
discreet for him to undeceive them ? For the first time in his life
the Commander thought of policy,—for the first time he quoted
that text which has been the lure of so many well-meaning but
easy Christians, of being “ all things to all men.” Infeliz
Hermenegildo Salvatierra !
For by degrees an ominous whisper crept through the little
settlement. The Right Eye of the Commander, although
miraculous, seemed to exercise a baleful effect upon the beholder.
No one could look at it without winking. It was cold, hard,
relentless, and unflinching. More than that, it seemed to be
endowed with a dreadful prescience,—a faculty of seeing through
and into the inarticulate thoughts of those it looked upon. The
soldier’s of the garrison obeyed the eye rather than the voice of
their commander, and answered his glance rather than his lips in
■questioning. The servants could not evade the ever-watchful,
but cold attention that seemed to pursue them. The children of
the Presidio School smirched their copy-books under the awful
supervision, and poor Paquita, the prize pupil, failed utterly in
that marvellous up-stroke when her patron stood beside her.
Gradually distrust, suspicion, self-accusation, and timidity took
the place of trust, confidence, and security throughout San Carlos.
Whenever the Right Eye of the Commander fell, a shadow fell
with it.
• Nor was Salvatierra entirely free from the baleful iinfluence of
his miraculous acquisition. Unconscious of its effect upon others,
he only saw in their actions evidence of certain things that the
crafty Peleg had hinted on that eventful New Year’s eve. His


most trusty retainers stammered, blushed, and faltered before
him. Self-accusations, confessions of minor faults and delinquencies,
or extravagant excuses and apologies met his mildest inquiries.
The very children that he loved —his pet pupil, Paquita—seemed
to be conscious of some hidden sin. The result of this constant
irritation showed itself more plainly. For the first half-year the
Commander’s voice and eye were at variance. He was still kind,
tender, and thoughtful in speech. Gradually, however, his voice
took upon itself the hardness of his glance and its sceptical,
impassive quality, and as the year again neared its close it was
plain that the Commander had fitted himself to the eye, and not
the eye to the Commander.
It "may be surmised that these changes did not escape the-
watchful solicitude of the Fathers. Indeed, the few who were
first to ascribe the right eye of Salvatierra to miraculous origin
and the special grace of the blessed San Carlos, now talked openly
of witchcraft and the agency of Luzbel, the evil one. It would
have fared ill with Hermenegildo Salvatierra had he been aught
but Commander or amenable to local authority. But the reverend
father, Friar Manuel de Cortes, had no power over the political
executive, and all attempts at spiritual advice failed signally. He
retired baffled and confused from his first interview with the
Commander, who seemed now to take a grim satisfaction in the
fateful power of his glance. The holy father contradicted himself,
exposed the fallacies of his own arguments, and even, it is asserted,
committed himself to several undoubted heresies. When the
Commander stood up at mass, if the officiating priest caught that
sceptical and searching eye, the service was inevitably ruined.
Even the power of the Holy Church seemed to be lost, and the
last hold upon the affections of the people and the good order of
the settlement departed from San Carlos.
As the long dry summer passed, the low hills that surrounded
the white walls of the Presidio grew more and more to resemble in
hue the leathern jacket of the Commander, and Nature herself
seemed to have borrowed his dry, hard glare. The earth was
cracked and seamed with drought; a blight had fallen upon the
orchards and vineyards, and the rain, long delayed and ardently
prayed for, came not. The sky was as tearless as the right eye of the
Commander. Murmurs of discontent, insubordination, and
plotting among the Indians reached his ears; he only set his teeth
the more firmly, tightened the knot of his black silk handkerchief,
and looked up his Toledo.
The last day of the year 1798 found the Commander sitting, at
the hour of evening prayers, alone in the guard-room. He no-
longer attended the services of the Holy Church, but crept away
at such times to some solitary spot, where he spent the interval iu
silent meditation. The firelight played upon the low beams and
rafters, but left the bowed figure of Salvatierra in darkness.
Sitting thus, he felt a small hand touch his arm, and looking


down, saw the figure of Paquita, his little Indian pupil, at his
knee. “ Ah, littlcst of all,” said the Commander, with something
of his old tenderness, lingering over the endearing diminutives of
his native speech,—“ sweet one, what doest thou here ? Art thou
not afraid of him whom every one shuns and fears J ”
“ No,” said the little Indian, readily, “ not in the dark, I hear
your voice, —the old voice ; I feel your touch, —the old touch ; but
I see not your eye, Senor Comandante. That only I fear, —and
that, 0 Senor, 0 my father,” said the child, lifting her little arms
towards his, —“ that I know is not thine own ! ”
The Commander shuddered and turned away. Then, recovering
himself, he kissed Paquita gravely on the forehead and bade her
retire. A few hours later, when silence had fallen upon the Pre-
sidio, he sought his own couch and slept peacefully.
At about the middle watch of the night a dusky figure crept
through the low embrasure of the Commander’s apartment.
Other figures were flitting through the parade-ground, which the
Commander might have seen had he not slept so quietly. The
intruder stepped noiselessly to the couch and listened to the
sleeper’s deep-drawn inspiration. Something glittered in the fire-
light as the savage lifted his arm ; another moment and the sore
perplexities of Hcrmenegildo Salvatierra would have been over,
when suddenly the savage started and fell back in a paroxysm of
terror. The Commander slept peacefully, but his right eye, widely
opened, fixed and unaltered, glared coldly on the would-be assas-
sin. The man fell to the earth in a fit, and the noise awoke the
sleeper.
To rise to his feet, grasp his sword, and deal blows thick and
fast upon the mutinous savages who now thronged the room, was
the work of a moment. Help opportunely arrived, and the un-
disciplined Indians were speedly driven beyond the walls, but in
the scuffle the Commander received a blow upon his right eye,
and, lifting his hand to that mysterious organ, it w'as gone. Never
again was it found, and never again, for bale or bliss did it adorn
the right orbit of the Commander.
With it passed away the spell that had fallen upon San Carlos.
The rain returned to invigorate the languid soil, harmony was
restored between priest and soldier, the green grass presently
waved over the sere hillsides, the children flocked again to the
side of their martial preceptor, a Te Deum was sung in the
Mission Church, and pastoral content once more smiled upon the
gentle valleys of San Carlos. And far southward crept the
“ General Court ” with its master, Pelcg Scuddcr, trafficking in
beads and peltries with the Indians, and offering glass eyes,
wooden legs, and other Boston notions to the chiefs.


NOTES BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
PART I. —IN THE FIELD.
It was near the close of an October day that I began to be dis-
agreeably conscious of the Sacramento Valley. I had been riding
since sunrise, and my course through the depressing monotony of
the long level landscape affected me more like a dull dyspeptic
dream than a business journey, performed under that sincerest of
natural phenomena,—a California sky. The recurring stretches
of brown and baked fields, the gaping fissures in the dusty trail,
the hard outline of the distant hills, and the herds of slowly
moving cattle seemed like features of some glittering stereoscopic
picture that never changed. Active exercise might have removed
this feeling, but my horse by some subtle instinct had long since
given up all ambitious effort, and had lapsed into a dogged trot.
It was autumn, but not the season suggested to the Atlantic
reader under that title. The sharply defined boundaries of the
wet and dry seasons were prefigured in the clear outlines of the
distant hills. In the dry atmosphere the decay of vegetation was
too rapid for the slow hectic which overtakes an Eastern land-
scape, or else Nature was too practical for such thin disguises.
She merely turned the Hippocratic face to the spectator, with the
old diagnosis of Death in her sharp, contracted features.
In the contemplation of such a prospect there was little to
excite any but a morbid fancy. There were no clouds in the flinty
blue heavens, and the setting of the sun was accompanied with as
little ostentation as was consistent with the dryly practical atmo-
sphere. Darkness soon followed, with a rising wind, which
increased as the shadows deepened on the plain. The fringe of
alder by the watercourse began to loom up as I urged my horse
forward. A half-hour’s active spurring brought me to a corral,
and a little beyond a house, so low and broad, it seemed at first
sight to be half buried in the earth.
My second impression was that it had grown out of the soil, like
some monstrous vegetable, its dreary proportions were so in
keeping with the vast prospect. There were no recesses along its
roughly boarded walls for vagrant and unprofitable shadows to
lurk in the daily sunshine. No projection for the wind by night
to grow musical over, to wail, whistle, or whisper to ; only a long
wooden shelf containing a chilly-looking tin basin, and a bar of
soap. Its uncurtained windows were red with the sinking sun, as
though bloodshot and inflamed from a too long unlidded existence.
The tracks of cattle led to its front door, firmly closed against the
rattling wind.


To avoid being confounded with this familiar element, I walked
to the rear of the house, which was connected with a smaller
building by a slight platform. A grizzled, hard-faced old man
was standing there, and met my salutation with a look of inquiry,
and, without speaking, led the way to the principal room. As I
entered, four young men, who were reclining by the fire, slightly
altered their attitudes of perfect repose, but beyond that betrayed
neither curiosity nor interest. A hound started from a dar|c
comer with a growl, but was immediately kicked by the old man
into obscurity, and silenced again. I can’t tell why, but I
instantly received the impression that for a long time the group
by the fire had not uttered a word or moved a muscle. Taking a
seat, I briefly stated my business.
Was a United States surveyor. Had come on account of the
Esplritu Santo Rancho. Wanted to correct the exterior boundaries
of township lines, so as to connect with the near exteriors of
private grants. There had been some intervention to the old
survey by a Mr. Tryan who had pre-empted adjacent—“ settled
land warrants,” interrupted the old man. “Ah yes! Land War-
rants, —and then this was Mr. Tryan 7 ”
I had spoken mechanically, for I was preoccupied in connecting
other public lines with private surveys, as I looked in his face.
It was certainly a hard face, and reminded me of the singular
effect of that mining operation known as “ ground sluicing the
harder lines of underlying character were exposed, and what
were once plastic curves and soft outlines were obliterated by
some powerful agency.
There was a dryness in his voice not unlike the prevailing
atmosphere of the valley, as he launched into an ex parte
statement of the contest, with a fluency, which, like the wind
without, showed frequent and unrestrained expression. He told
me—what I had already learned —that the boundary line of the
old Spanish grant was a creek, described in the loose phraseology
of the desem as beginning in the yalda or skirt of the hill, its
precise location long the subject of litigation. I listened and
answered with little interest, for my mind was still distracted by
the wind which swept violently by the house, as well as by his
odd face, which was again reflected in the resemblance that the
silent group by the fire bore toward him. He was still talking, and
the wind was yet blowing, when my confused attention was aroused
by a remark addressed to the recumbent figures.
“ Now, then, which on ye T 1 see the stranger up the creek to
Altascar’s, to-morrow ?”
There was a general movement of opposition in the group,
but no decided answer.
“ Kin you go, Kerg 7”
“ Who’s to look up stock in Strarbcrry per-ar-ie 7”
This seemed to imply a negative, and the old man turned to
another hopeful, who was pulling the fur from a mangy bear-skin


on which he was lying, with an expression as though it were some-
body’s hair.
“ Well, Tom, what’s to hinder you from goin’ 7”
“ Mam’s goin’ to Brown’s store at sun-up, and I s’pose I’ve got
to pack her and the baby agin.”
I think the expression of scorn this unfortunate youth exhibited
for the filial duty into which he had been evidently beguiled, was
one of the finest things I had ever seen.
“ Wise 7”
Wise deigned no verbal reply, but figuratively thrust a worn and
patched boot into the discourse. The old man flushed quickly.
“ I told ye to get Brown to give you a pair the last time you
war down the river.”
“ Said he would n’t without’en order. Said it was like pulling
gum-teeth to get the money from you even then.’’
There was a grim smile at this local hit at the old man’s parsi-
mony, and Wise, who was clearly the privileged wit of the family,
sank back in honourable retirement.
“Well, Joe, ef your boots are new, and you are n’t pestered with
wimmin and children, p’r’aps you’ll go,” said Tryan, with a ner-
vous twitching, intended for a smile, about a mouth not remark-
ably mirthful.
Tom lifted a pair of bushy eyebrows, and said shortly,—
“ Got no saddle,”
“ Wot’s gone of your saddle ?”
“Kerg, there,” —indicating his brother with a look such as
Cain might have worn at the sacrifice.
“You lie,” returned Kerg cheerfully.
Tryan sprang to his feet, seizing the chair, flourishing it around
his head and gazing furiously in the hard young faces which fear-
lessly met his own. But it was only for a moment; his arm soon
dropped by his side, and a look of hopeless fatality crossed his
face. He allowed me to take the chair from his hand, and I was
trying to pacify him by the .assurance that I required no guide,
when the irrepressible Wise again lifted his voice :
“ Theer’s George cornin’ ! why don’t ye ask him ! He’ll go and
introduce you to Don Fernandy’s darter too, if you ain’t pertickler.”
The laugh which followed this joke, which evidently had some
domestic allusion (the general tendency of rural pleasantry), was
followed by a light step on the platform, and the young man
entered. Seeing a stranger present, he stopped and coloured;
made a shy salute and coloured again, and, then, drawing a box
from the corner, sat down, his hands clasped lightly together and
his veiy handsome bright blue eyes turned frankly on mine.
Perhaps I was in a condition to receive the romantic impression
he made upon me, and I took it upon myself to ask his company
as guide, and he cheerfully assented. But some domestic duty
called him presently away.
The fire gleamed brightly on the hearth, and, no longer resisting


the prevailing influence, I silently watched the spirting flame,
listening to the wand which continually shook the tenement. Be-
sides the one chair which had acquired a new importance in my
eyes, I presently discovered a crazy table in one corner, with an
ink-bottle and pen ; the latter in that greasy state of decomposi-
tion peculiar to country taverns and farm houses. A goodly array
of rifles and double barrelled guns stocked the corner; half a
dozen saddles and blankets lay near, with a mild flavour of the
horse about them. Some deer and bear skins completed the
inventory. As I sat there, with the silent group around me, the
shadowy gloom within and the dominant wind without, I found
it difficult to believe I had ever known a different existence. My
profession had often led me to wilder scenes, but rarely among those
whose unrestrained habits and easy unconsciousness made me feel
so lonely and uncomfortable, I shrank closer to myself, not
without grave doubts—which I think occur naturally to people in
like situations—that this was the general rule of humanity, and I
was a solitary and somewhat gratuitous exception.
It was a relief w r hen a laconic announcement of supper by a
weak-eyed girl caused a general movement in the family. We
walked across the dark platform, which led to another low-ceiled
room. Its entire length was occupied by a table, at the farther
end of which a weak-eyed woman was already taking her repast,
as she, at the same time, gave nourishment to a weak-eyed baby.
As the formalities of introduction had been dispensed with, and as
she took no notice of me, I was enabled to slip into a seat without
discomposing or interrupting her. Tryan extemporised a grace,
and the attention of the family became absorbed in bacon, potatoes,
and dried apples.
The meal was a sincere one. Gentle gurglings at the upper end
of the table often betrayed the presence of the “wellspring of
pleasure.” The conversation generally referred to the labours of
the day, and comparing notes as to the whereabouts of missing
stock. Yet the supper was such a vast improvement upon the
previous intellectual feast, that when a chance allusion of mine to
the business of my visit brought out the elder Tryan, the interest
grew quite exciting. I remember he inveighed bitterly against
the system of ranch-holding by the “ greasers,” as he was pleased
to term the native Californians. As the same ideas have been
sometimes advanced under more pretentious circumstances, they
may be worthy of record.
“ Look at ’em holdin’ the finest grazin’ laud that ever lay outer
doors 7 Whar’s the papers for it 7 Was it grants 7 Mighty fine
grants,—most of ’em made arter the ’Merrikans got possession.
More fools the ’Merrikans for lettin’ ’em hold ’em. Wat paid for
’em 7 ’Merrikan blood and money.
“ Didn’t they oughter have suthin out of their native country ?
Wot for 7 Did they ever improve 7 Got a lot of yaller-skinned
diggers, not so sensible as niggers to look arter stock, and they a


sittin' home and smokin’. With their gold and silver candlesticks,
and missions, and crucifixens, priests and graven idols, and sich I
Them sort things wurent allowed in Mizzoori.”
At the mention of improvements, I involuntarily lifted my eyes,
and met the half-laughing, half-embarrassed look of George. The
act did not escape detection, and I had at once the satisfaction of
seeing that the rest of the family had formed an offensive alliance
against us.
“It was agin Nater, and agin God,” added Tryan. “ God
never intended gold in the rocks to be made into heathen candle-
sticks and crucifixens. That’s why he sent ’Merrikins here. Nater
never intended such a climate for lazy lopers. She never gin six
months’ sunshine to be slept and smoked away.”
How long he continued, and -with what further illustration, I could
not say, for I took an early opportunity to escape to the sitting-room,
I was soon followed by George, who called me to an open door
leading to a smaller room, and pointed to a bed.
“ You’d better sleep there to-night,” he said ; “ you ’ll be more
comfortable, and I ’ll call you early.”
I thanked him, and would have asked him several questions
which were then troubling me, but he shyly slipped to the door
and vanished.
A shadow seemed to fall on the room when he had gone. The
*• boys ” returned, one by one, and shuffled to their old places, A
larger log was thrown on the fire, and the huge chimney glowed
like a furnace, but it did not seem to melt or subdue a single line
of the hard faces that it lit. In half an hour later, the furs
which had served as chairs by day, undertook the nightly office of
mattrasses, and each received its owner’s full-length figure. Mr. Tryan
had not returned, and I missed George. I sat there, until, wake-
ful and nervous, I saw the fire fall and shadows mount the wall.
There was no sound but the rushing of the wind and the snoring
of the sleepers. At last, feeling the place insupportable, I seized
my hat, and, opening the door, ran out briskly into the night.
The acceleration of my torpid pulse in the keen fight with the
wind, whose violence was almost equal to that of a tornado, and
the familiar faces of the bright stars above me, I felt as a blessed
relief. I ran not knowing whither, and when I halted, the square
outline of the house was lost in the alder-bushes. An uninter-
rupted plain stretched before me, like a vast sea beaten flat by
the force of the gale. As I kept on I noticed a slight elevation
toward the horizon, and presently my progress was impeded by
the ascent of an Indian mound. It struck me forcibly as resem-
bling an island in the sea. Its height gave me a better view of
the expanding plain. But even here I found no rest. The
ridiculous interpretation Tryan had given the climate was some-
how sung in my ears, and echoed in my throbbing pulse, as, guided
by the star, I sought the house again.
But I felt fresher and more natural as I stepped upon the


platform. The door of the lower building was open, and the
old man was sitting beside the table, thumbing the leaves of a
Bible with a look in his face as though he were hunting up
prophecies against the “ Greaser.” I turned to enter, but my
attention was attracted by a blanketed figure lying beside the
house, on the platform. The broad chest heaving with healthy
slumber, and the open, honest face w r ere familiar. It was George,
who had .given up his bed to the stranger among his people. I.
was about to wake him, but he lay so peaceful and quiet, I felt
awed and hushed. And I went to bed with a pleasant impression
of his handsome face and tranquil figure soothing me to sleep.
I was awakened the next morning from a sense of lulled repose
and grateful silence by the cheery voice of George, who stood
beside my bed, ostentatiously twirling a “ riata,” as if to recall
the duties of the day to my sleep-bewildered eyes. I looked
around me. The wind had been magically laid, and the sun
shone warmly through the windows. A dash of cold water, with
an extra chill on from the tin basin, helped to brighten me. It
was still early, but the family had already breakfasted and dis-
persed, and a waggon winding far in the distance showed that the
unfortunate Tom had already “ packed ” his relatives away. I
felt more cheerful, —there are few troubles Youth cannot distance
with the start of a good night’s rest. After a substantial break-
fast, prepared by George, in a few moments we were mounted and
dashing down the plain.
We followed the line of alder that defined the creek, now dry
and baked with summer’s heat, but which in winter, George told
me, overflowed its banks. I still retain a vivid impression of that
morning’s ride, the far-off mountains, like silhouettes, against the
steel-blue sky, the crisp dry.air, and the expanding track before
me, animated often by the well-knit figure of George Tryan,
musical with jingling spurs, and picturesque with flying “ riata.”
He rode a powerful native roan, wild-eyed, untiring in stride and
unbroken in nature. Alas ! the curves of beauty were concealed
by the cumbrous machillas of the Spanish saddle, which levels
all equine distinctions. The single rein lay loosely on the cruel
bit that can gripe, and, if need be, crush the jaw it controls.
Again the illimitable freedom of the valley rises before me, as
we again bear down into sunlit space. Can this be “ Chu-Chu,”
stayed and respectable filly of American pedigree,—“ Chu-Chu,”
forgetful of plank-roads and cobble-stones, wild with excitement,
twinkling her small white feet beneath me ? George laughs out
of a cloud of dust, “ Give her her head ; don’t you see she likes
it?” and “Chu-Chu” seems to like it, and, whether bitten by
native tarantula into native barbarism or emulous of the roan,
“ blood” asserts itself, and in a moment the peaceful servitude of
years is beaten out in the music of her clattering hoofs. The
creek widens to a deep gully. We dive into it and up on the


opposite side, carrying a moving cloud of impalpable powder
with us. Cattle are scattered over the plain, grazing quietly, or
banded together in vast restless herds. George makes a wide,
indefinite sweep with the “ riata,” as if to include them all in his
vaquero's loop, and says, “ Ours !”
“ About how many, George ?”
Don’t know.”
“ How many ?”
“ Well, p’r’aps three thousand head,” says George, reflecting.
We don’t know, takes five men to look ’em up and keep run.”
What are they worth ? ”
“ About thirty dollars a head.”
I make a rapid calculation, and look my astonishment at the
laughing George. Perhaps a recollection of the domestic economy
of the Tryan household is expressed in that look, for George
averts his eye and says, apologetically,—
“ I’ve tried to get the old man to sell and build, but you know he
says it ain’t no use to settle down, just yet. We must keep movin’.
In fact, he built the shanty for that purpose, lest titles should fall
through, and we’d have to get up and move stakes further down.”
Suddenly his quick eye detects some unusual sight in a herd we
are passing, and with an exclamation he puts his roan into the
centre of the mass. I follow, or rather “Chu-Chu” darts after
the roan, and in a few moments we are in the midst of apparently
inextricable horns and hoofs. “ Toro 1 ” shouts George, with
vaquero enthusiasm, and the band opens a way for the swinging
“ riata.” I can feel their steaming breaths, and their spume is
cast on “ Chu-Chu’s ” quivering flank.
Wild, devilish-looking beasts are they ; not such shapes as Jove
might have chosen to woo a goddess, nor such as peacefully range
the downs of Devon, but lean and hungry Cassius-like bovines,
economically .got up to meet the exigencies of a six months’ rain-
less climate, and accustomed to wrestle with the distracting wind
and the blinding dust.
“ That’s not our brand,” says George ; “they’re strange stock,”
and he points to what my scientific eye recognises as the astro-
logical sign of Venus deeply seared in the brown flanks of the
bull he is chasing. But the herd are closing round us with low
mutterings, and George has again recourse to the authoritative
“ Toro,” and with swinging “riata” divides the “bossy bucklers”
on either side. When we are free, and breathing somewhat more
easily, I venture to ask George if they ever attack any one.
“Never horsemen, sometimes footmen. Not through rage,
you know, but curiosity. They think a man and his horse are
one, and if they meet a chap afoot, they run him down and
trample him under hoof, in the pursuit of knowledge. But,”
adds George, “ here’s the lower leich of the foot-hills, and here’s
Altascar’s corral, and that white building you see yonder is the cam."
A whitewashed wall enclosed a court containing another adobe


building, baked with the solar beams of many summers. Leaving
our horses in the charge of a few peons in the court-yard, who
were basking lazily in the sun, we entered a low doorway, where
a deep shadow and an agreeable coolness fell upon us, as sudden
and grateful as a plunge in cool water, from its contrast with the
external glare and heat. In the centre of a low-ceiled apartment
sat an old man with a black silk handkerchief tied about his
head, the few grey hairs that escaped from its folds relieving his-
gamboge-coloured face. The odour of 'cigarritos was as in-
cense added to the cathedral gloom of the building.
As Senor Altascar rose with well-bred gravity to receive us,
George advanced with such a heightened colour, and such a
blending of tenderness and respect in his manner, that I was
touched to the heart by so much devotion in the careless youth.
In fact my eyes were still dazzled by the effect of the outer sun-
shine, and at first I did not see the white teeth and black eyes of
Pepita, who slipped into the corridor as we entered.
It was no pleasant matter to disclose particulars of business
which would deprive the old Senor of the greater part of that
land we had just ridden over, and I did it with great embarrass-
ment. Buthe listened calmly,—notamuscleof hisdark face stirring,
—and the smoke curling placidly from his lips showed his regular
respiration. When I had finished, he offered quietly to accompany
us to the line of demarcation. George had meanwhile disappeared,
but a suspicious conversation in broken Spanish and English, in
the corridor, betrayed his vicinity. When he returned again, a
little absent-minded, the old man, by far the coolest and most
self-possessed of the party, extinguished his black silk cap beneath
that stiff, uncomely sombrero which all native Californians affect.
A gerapa thrown over his shoulders hinted that he was waiting.
Horses are always ready saddled in Spanish ranchos, and in half
an hour from the time of our arrival we were again “ loping ” in
the staring sunlight.
But not as cheerful as before. George and myself were weighed
down by restraint, and Altascar was gravely quiet. To break the
silence, and by way of a consolatory essay, I hinted to him that
there might be further intervention or appeal, but the proffered oil
and wine were returned with a careless shrug of the shoulders and
a sententious “ Qne bueno ?—Your courts are always just.”
The Indian mound of the previous night’s discovery was a
bearing monument of the new line, and there we halted. We
were surprised to find the old man Tryan waiting us. For the
first dime during our interview the old Spaniard seemed moved,
and the blood rose in his yellow cheek. I was anxious to close the
scene, and pointed out the corner boundaries as clearly as my
recollection served.
“ The deputies will be here to-morrow to run the lines from
this initial point, and there will be no further trouble, I believe,
gentlemen.”


Senor Altascar had dismounted and was gathering a few tufts
of dried grass in his hands. George and I exchanged glances.
He presently arose from his stooping posture, and, advancing to
within a few paces of Joseph Try an, said, in a voice broken with
passion,—
“ And I, Fernando Jesus Maria Altascar, put you in possession
of my land in the fashion of my country.”
He threw a sod to each of the cardinal points,
“ I don’t know your courts, your judges, or your corregidores.
Take the llano /—and take this with it. May the drought seize
your cattle till their tongues hang down as long as those of your
lying lawyers ! May it be the curse and torment of your old age,
as you and yours have made it of mine !”
We stepped between the principal actors in this scene, which
only the passion of Altascar made tragical, but Tryan, with a
humility but ill concealing his triumph, interrupted :
“ Let him curse on. He’ll find ’em coming home to him sooner
than the cattle he has lost through his sloth and pride. The Lord
is on the side of the just, as well as agin all slanderers and
revilers.”
Altascar but half guessed the meaning of the Missourian, yet
sufficiently to drive from his mind all but the extravagant power
of his native invective,
“ Stealer of the Sacrament 1 Open not! —open not, I say, your
lying, Judas lips to me ! Ah 1 half-breed, with the soul of a
cayote !—Car-r-r-ramba !”
With his passion reverberating among the consonants like
distant thunder, he laid his hand upon the mane of his horse as
though it had been the gray locks of his adversary, swung himself
into the saddle and galloped away.
George turned to me ;
“ Will you go back with us to-night?”
I thought of the cheerless walls, the silent figures by the fire,
and the roaring wind, and hesitated,
“Well then, good-bye.”
“ Good-bye, George.”
Another wring of the hands, and we parted. I had not ridden
far, when I turned and looked back. The wind had risen early
that afternoon, and was already sweeping across the plain. A
cloud of dust travelled before it, and a picturesque figure occa-
sionally emerging therefrom was my last indistinct impression of
George Tryan, ,
PART lI.—IN THE FLOOD,
Thuee months after the survey of the Espiritii Santo Rancho, I
was again in the valley of the Sacramento. But a general and
terrible visitation had erased the memory of that event as com-


pletely as I supposed it had obliterated the boundary monuments
I had planted. The great flood of 1861-62 was at its height,
when, obeying' some indefinite yearning, I took my carpet-bag and
embarked for the inundated valley.
There was nothing to be seen from the bright cabin windows
of the “ Golden City ” but night deepening over the water. The
only sound was the pattering rain, and that had grown monotonous
for the past two weeks, and did not disturb the national gravity of
my countrymen as they silently sat around the cabin stove. Some
on errands of relief to friends and relatives wore anxious faces, and
conversed soberly on the one absorbing topic. Others, like myself,
attracted by curiosity, listened eagerly to newer details. But with
that human disposition to seize upon any circumstance that might
give chance event the exaggerated importance of instinct, I was
half conscious of something more than curiosity as an impelling
motive.
The dripping of rain, the low gurgle of water, and a leaden
sky greeted us the next morning as we lay beside the half-
submerged levee of Sacramento. Here, however, the novelty
of boats to convey us to the hotels was an appeal that was
irresistible. I resigned myself to a dripping rubber-cased mariner
called “ Joe,” and, wrapping myself in a shining cloak of the
like material, about as suggestive of warmth as court-plaster
might have been, took my seat in the stern sheets of his boat.
It was no slight inward struggle to part from the steamer, that
to most of the passengers was the only visible connecting link
between us and the dry and habitable earth, but we pulled away
and entered the city, stemming a rapid current as we shot the
levee.
We glided up the long level of K Street, —once a cheerful, busy
thoroughfare, now distressing in its silent desolation. The turbid
water which seemed to meet the horizon edge before us flowed at
right angles in sluggish rivers through the streets. Nature had
revenged herself on the local taste by disarraying the regular
rectangles by huddling houses on street comers, where they
presented abrupt gables to the current, or by capsizing them in
compact min. Crafts of all kinds were gliding in and out of low-
arched doorways. The water was over the top of the fences sur-
rounding well-kept gardens, in the first.storeys of hotels and pri-
vate dwellings, trailing its slime on velvet carpets as well as
roughly boarded floors. And a silence quite as suggestive as the visible
desolation was in the voiceless streets that no longer echoed to
carriage wheel or footfall. The low ripple of water, the occa-
sional splash of oars, or the warning cry of boatmen were the
few signs of life and habitation.
With such scenes before my eyes and such sounds in my ears,
as I lie lazily in the boat, is mingled the song of my gondolier,
who sings to the music of his oars. It is not quite as romantic as
his brother of the Lido might improvise, but my Yankee
H


“ Giuseppe” has the advantage of earnestness and energy, and
gives a graphic description of the terrors of the past week and of
noble deeds of self-sacrifice and devotion, occasionally pointing
out a balcony from which some California Bianca or Laura had
been snatched, half clothed and famished. Giuseppe is otherwise
peculiar, and refuses the proffered fare, for —am I not a citizen of
San Francisco, which was first to respond to the suffering cry of
Sacramento ? and is not he, Giuseppe, a member of the Howard
Society ? No ; Giuseppe is poor, but cannot take my money.
Still, if I must spend it, there is the Howard Society, and the
women and children without food and clothes at the Agricultural
Hall.
I thank the generous gondolier, and we go to the Hall, —a
dismal, bleak place, ghastly with the memories of last year’s
opulence and plenty, and here Giuseppe’s fare is swelled by the
stranger’s mite. But here Giuseppe tells me of the “ Relief Boat”
which leaves for the flooded district in the interior, and here, pro-
fiting by the lesson he has taught me, I make the resolve to turn
my curiosity to the account of others, and am accepted of those
who go forth to succour and help the afflicted. Giuseppe takes
charge of my carpet-bag, and does not part from me until I stand
on the slippery deck of “ Relief Boat No. 3.”
An hour later I am in the pilot-house, looking down upon what
was once the channel of a peaceful river. But its banks are only
defined by tossing tufts of willow washed by the long swell that
breaks over a vast inland sea. Stretches of “ tule” land fertilised
by its once regular channel and dotted by flourishing ranchos are
now cleanly erased. The cultivated profile of the old landscape
had faded. Dotted lines in symmetrical perspective mark
orchards that are buried and chilled in the turbid flood. The roofs
of a few farm houses are visible, and here and there the smoke
curling from chimneys of half-submerged tenements show an
undaunted life within. Cattle and sheep are gathered on Indian
mounds waiting the fate of their companions whose carcases drift
by us, or swing in eddies with the wrecks of barns and out-houses.
Waggons are stranded everywhere where the tide could carry
them. As I wipe the moistened glass, I see nothing but water,
pattering on the deck from the lowering clouds, dashing against
the window, dripping from the willows, hissing by the wheels,
everywhere washing, coiling, sapping, hurrying in rapids, or
swelling at last into deeper and vaster lakes, awful in their
suggestive quiet and concealment.
As day fades into night the monotony of this strange prospect
grows oppressive. I seek the engine-room, and in the company of
some of the few half-drowned sufferers we have already picked
up from temporary rafts, I forget the general aspect of desolation
in their individual misery. Later we meet the San Francisco
packet, and transfer a number of our passengers. From them we
loam how inward-bound vessels report to having struck the well-


defined channel of the Sacramento, fifty miles beyond the bar.
There is a voluntary contribution taken among the generous
travellers for the use of our afflicted, and we part company with a
hearty “ God speed,” on either side. But our signal-lights are not
far distant before a familiar sound comes back to us, —an indomi-
table Yankee cheer, —which scatters the gloom.
Our course is altered, and we are steaming over the obliterated
banks far in the interior. Once or twice black objeots loom -up
near us, —the wrecks of houses floating by. There is a slight rift
in the sky towards the north, and a few bearing stars to guide us
over the waste. As we penetrate into shallower water, it is
deemed advisable to divide our party into smaller boats, and
diverge over the submerged prairie. I borrow a pea-coat of one
of the crew, and in that practical disguise am doubtfully per-
mitted to pass into one of the boats. We give way northerly. It
is quite dark yet, although the rift of cloud has widened.
It must have been about three o’clock, and we were lying upon
our oars in an eddy formed by a clump of cottonwood, and the
light of the steamer is a solitary, bright star in the distance, when
the silence is broken by the “ bow oar” ;
“ Light ahead.”
All eyes are turned in that direction. In a few seconds a
twinkling light appears, shines steadily, and again disappears as if
by the shifting position of some black object apparently drifting
close upon us.
“ Stem, all; a steamer I ”
“ Hold hard there ! Steamer be d d!” is the reply of the
coxswain. “ It’s a house, and a big one too.”
It is a big one, looming in the starlight like a huge fragment of
the darkness. The light comes from a single candle, which
shines through a window as the great shape swings by. Some
recollection is drifting back to me with it, as I listen with beating
heart.
“ There’s some one in it, by Heavens ! Give way, boys,—lay
her alongside. Handsomely, now ! The door’s fastened ; try the
window ;no ! here’s another 1 ”
In another moment we are trampling in the water, which washes
the floor to the depth of several inches. It is a large room, at the
further end of which an old man is sitting wrapped in a blanket,
holding a candle in one hand, and apparently absorbed in the book
he holds with the other. I spring towards him with the exclama-
tion ;
“ Joseph Try an 1 ”
He does not move. We gather closer to him, and I lay my hand
gently on his shoulder, and say :
“ Lookup, oldman, look up ! Your wife and children, where
are they ? The boys,—George ! Are they here ; are they safe ? ”
He raises his head slowly, and turns his eyes to mine, and we in-
voluntarily recoil before his look. It is a calm and quiet glance,


free from fear, anger, or pain ; but it somehow sends the blood
curdling through our veins. He bowed his head over his book
again, taking no further notice of us. The men look at me com-
passionately, and hold their peace. I make one more effort: —
“ Joseph Tryan, don’t you know me ? the surveyor who surveyed
your ranch, —the Espiritu Santo 1 Look up, old man ! ”
He shuddered and wrapped himself closer in his blanket. Pre-
sently he repeated to himself, “ The surveyor who surveyed your
ranch, —Espiritu Santo,” over and over again, as though it were a
lesson he was trying to fix in his memory.
I was turning sadly to the boatmen, when he suddenly caught
me fearfully by the hand and said,
“ Hush ! ”
We were silent.
“ Listen !” He puts his arm around my neck and whispers in
my ear, “ I’m a moving off I ”
“ Moving off ? ”
“ Hush ? Don’t speak so loud. Moving off. Ah ! wot’s that ?
Don’t you hear ? —there ! listen ! ”
We listen, and hearthe water gurgle and click beneath the floor.
“ It’s them wot he sent! —Old Altascar sent. They ’ve been
here all night. I heard ’em first in the creek, when they came to
tell the old man to move farther off. They came nearer and
nearer. They whispered under the door, and I saw their eyes
on the step, —their cruel, hard eyes. Ah, why don’t they quit?”
I tell the men to search the room and see if they can find any
further traces of the family, while Tryan resumes his old attitude.
It is so much like the figure I remember on the breezy night that
a superstitious feeling is fast overcoming me. When they have
returned, I tell them briefly what I know of him, and the old
man murmurs again,—
“ Why don’t they quit, then ? They have the stock—all gone—
gone, gone for the hides and hoofs,” and he groans bitterly.
“There are other boats below us. The shanty cannot have
drifted far, and perhaps the family are safe by this time,” says the
coxswain, hopefully.
We lift the old man up, for he is quite helpless, and carry him
to the boat. He is still grasping the Bible in his right hand,
though its strengthening grace is blank to his vacant eye, and he
cowers in the stem as we pull slowly to the steamer, while a pale
gleam in the sky shows the coming day.
I was weary with excitement, and when we reached the
steamer, and i had seen Joseph Tryan comfortably bestowed, I
wrapped mys§lf in a blanket near the boiler and presently fell
asleep. But even then the figure of the old man often started
before me, and a sense of uneasiness about George made a strong
undercurrent to my drifting dreams. I was awakened at about
eight o’clock in the morning by the engineer, who told me one of
the old man’s sons had been picked up and was now on board.


“ Is it George Tryan ? ” I asked quickly.
“ Don’t know ; but be’s a sweet one, whoever he is,” adds the
engineer, with a smile at some luscious remembrance. “ You ’ll
find him for’ard.
I hurry to the bow of the boat, and find, not George, but the
irrepressible Wise, sitting on a coil of rope, a little dirtier and
rather more dilapidated than I can remember having seen him.
He is examining, with apparent admiration, some rough, dry
clothes that have been put out for his disposal. I cannot help
thinking that circumstances have somewhat exalted his usual
cheerfulness. He puts me at my ease by at once addressing
me;—
“ These are high old times, ain’t they'? I say, what do you
reckon ’s become o’ them thar bound’ry. moniments you stuck ?
Ah!”
The pause which succeeds this outburst is the effect of a spasm
of admiration at a pair of high boots, which, by great exertion,
he has at last pulled on his feet.
“So you’ve picked up the ole man in the shanty, clean
crazy ? He must have been soft to have stuck there instead o’
leavin’ with the old woman. Did n’t know me from Adam ; took
me for George ! ”
At this affecting instance of paternal forgetfulness, Wise was
evidently divided between amusement and chagrin. I took ad-
vantage of the contending emotions to ask about George.
“ Don’t know whar he is ! If he’d tended stock instead of
running about the prairie, packin’ off wimmin and children, he
might have saved suthin. He lost every hoof and hide, I ’ll bet
a cookey ! Say you,” to a passing boatman, “when are you goin’
to give us some grub ? I’m hungry ’nough to skin and eat a boss.
Reckon I ’ll turn butcher when things is dried up, and save hides,
horns, and taller.”
I could not but admire this indomitable energy, which under
softer climatic influences might have borne such goodly fruit.
“ Have you any idea what you’ll do, Wise ?” I ask.
“ Thar ain’t much to do now,” says the practical young man.
“ I ’ll have to lay over a spell, I reckon, till things come
straight. The land ain’t worth much now, and won’t be, I
dessay, for some time. Wonder whar the old man ’ll drive stakes
next.”
“ I meant as to your father and George, Wise.”
“ 0, the ole man and I ’ll go on to ‘ Miles’s,’ whar Tom packed
the old woman and babies last week. George ’ll turn up somewhar
atween this and Altascar’s, ef he ain’t thar now.”
I ask how the Altascars have suffered.
“ Well, I reckon he ain’t lost much in stock. I should n’t won-
der if George helped him drive ’em up the foot-hills. And his
‘ casa’ ’s built too high. O, thar ain’t any water thar, you bet.
Ah,” says Wise, with reflective admiration, “ those greasers ain’t


the darned fools people thinks ’em. I ’ll bet thar ain’t one
swamped out in all ’er Californy.” But the appearance of “grub,”'
cut this rhapsody short.
“ I shall keep on a little farther,” I say, “ and try to find
George.”
Wise stared a moment at this eccentricity until a new light
dawned upon him.
“ I don’t think you ’ll save much. What’s the percentage,—
workin’ on shares, eh ! ”
I answer that I am only curious, which I feel lessens his opinion
of me, and with a sadder feeling than his assurance of George’s
safety might warrant, I walked away.
From others whom we picked up from time to time we heard of
George’s self-sacrificing devotion, with the praises of the many
he had helped and rescued. But I did not feel disposed to return
until I had seen him, and soon prepared myself to take a boat to
the lower “ valda ”of the foot-hills, and visit Altascar. I soon
perfected my arrangements, bade farewell to Wise, and took a
last look at the old man, who was sitting by the furnace-fires
quite passive and composed. Then our boat-head swung round,
pulled by sturdy and willing hands.
It was again raining, and a disagreeable w r ind had risen. Our
course lay nearly west, and we soon knew by the strong current
that we were in the creek of the Esplritu Santo. From time to
time the wrecks of barns were seen, and we passed many half-
submerged willows hung with farming implements.
We emerge at last into a broad silent sea. It is the “ llano de
Espiritu Santo.” As the wind whistles by me, piling the
shallower fresh water into mimic waves, I go back, in fancy, to the
long ride of October over that boundless plain, and recall the
sharp outlines of the distant hills which are now lost in the
lowering clouds. The men are rowing silently, and I find my
mind, released from its tension, growing benumbed and depressed
as then. The water, too, is getting more shallow as we leave the
banks of the creek, and with my hand dipped listlessly over the
thwarts, I detect the tops of chimisal, which shows the tide to
have somewhat fallen. There is a black mound, bearing to the
north of the line of alder, making an adverse current, which, as
we sweep to the right to avoid, I recognize. We pull close along-
side, and I call to the men to stop.
There was a stake driven near its summit with the initials,
“L. E. S. I.” Tied half-way down was a curiously worked
“ riata.” It was George’s. It had been cut with some sharp
instrument, and the loose gravelly soil of the mound was deeply
dented with horse’s hoofs. The stake was covered with horse-
hairs. It was a record, but no clew.
The wind had grown more violent as we still fought our way
forward, resting and rowing by turns, and oftener “ poling ” the
shallower surface, but the old “ valda,” or bench, is still distant.


My recollection of the old survey enables me to guess the relative
position of the meanderings of the creek, and an occasional simple
professional experiment to determine the distance gives my crew
the fullest faith in my ability. Night overtakes us in our impeded
progress. Our condition looks more dangerous than it really is,
but I urge the men, many of whom are still new in this mode of
navigation, to greater exertion by assurance of perfect safety and
speedy relief ahead. We go on in this way until about eight
o’clock, and ground by the willows. We have a muddy walk tor
a few hundred yards before we strike a dry trail, and simultaneously
the white walls of Altascar’s appear like a snow-bank before us.
Lights are moving in the courtyard ; but otherwise the old tomb-
like repose characterizes the building.
One of the peons recognised me as I entered the court, and
Altascar met me on the corridor,
I was too weak to do more than beg his hospitality for the men
who had dragged wearily with me. He looked at my hand, which
still unconsciously held the broken “riata.” I began, wearily, to
tell him about George and my fears, but with a gentler courtesy
than was even his wont, he gravely laid his hand on my shoulder.
u Poco a poco Senor, —not now. You are tired, you have
hunger, you have cold. Necessaiy it is you should have
peace.”
He took us into a small room and poured out some French
cognac, which he gave to the men that had accompanied me.
They drank and threw themselves before the fire in the larger
room. The repose of the building was intensified that night, and
I even fancied that the footsteps on the corridor were lighter and
softer. The old Spaniard’s habitual gravity was deeper ; we might
have been shut out from the world as well as the whistling storm,
behind those ancient walls with their time-worn inheritor.
Before I could repeat my inquiry he retired. In a few minutes
two smoking dishes of “chupa” with coffee were placed before us,
and my men ate ravenously. I drank the coffee, but my excite-
ment and weariness kept down the instincts of hunger.
I was sitting sadly by the fire when he re-entered.
“ You have eat ? ”
I said, “ Yes,” to please him,
“ Bueno, eat when you can, —food and appetite are not always.”
He said this with that Sancho-like simplicity with which most
of his countrymen utter a proverb, as though it were an experience
rather than a legend, and taking the “ riata ” from the floor, held
it almost tenderly before him.
“ It was made by me, Senor.”
“ I kept it as a clew to him, Don Altascar,” I said. “If I could
find him—”
“ He is here.”
“ Here ! and ” —but I could not say “ well! ” I understood the
gravity of the old man’s face, the hushed footfalls, the tomb-like


repose of the building in an electric flash of consciousness ; I held
the clew to the broken riata at last. Altascar took my hand, and
we crossed the corridor to a sombre apartment. A few tall candles
were burning in sconces before the window.
In an alcove there was a deep bed with its counterpane, pillows,
and sheets heavily edged with lace, in all that splendid luxury
which the humblest of these strange people lavish upon this single
item of their household. I stepped beside it and saw George
lying, as I had seen him once before, peacefully at rest. But a
greater sacrifice than that he had known was here, and his generous
heart was stilled for ever.
“ He was honest and brave,” said the old man, and turned
away.
There was another figure in the room ; a heavy shawl drawn
over her graceful outline, and her long black hair hiding the
hands that buried her downcast face. I did not seem to notice
her, and, retiring presently, left the loving and loved together.
When we were again beside the crackling fire, in the shifting
shadows of the great chamber, Altascar told me how he had that
morning met the horse of George Tryan swimming on the prairie ;
how that, farther on, he found him lying, quite cold and dead,
with no marks or bruises on his person ; that he had probably
become exhausted in fording the creek, and that he had as
probably reached the mound only to die for want of that help he
had so freely given to others ; that, as a last act, he had freed his
horse. These incidents were corroborated by many who collected
in the great chamber that evening,—women and children, —most
of them succoured through the devoted energies of him who lay
cold and lifeless above.
He was buried in the Indian mound, —the single spot of strange
perennial greenness, which the poor aborigines had raised above
the dusty plain. A little slab of sandstone with the initials
“ G. T,” is his monument, and one of the bearings of the initial
corner of the new survey of the “ Espiritu Santo Rancho.”
THE MISSION DOLORES.
The Mission Dolores is destined to be “ The Last Sigh ” of the
native Californian. When the last “Greaser” shall indolently
give way to the bustling Yankee, I can imagine he will, like the
Moorish King, ascend one of the Mission hills to take his last
lingering look at the hilled city. For a long time he will cling
tenaciously to Pacific Street. He will delve in the rocky fast-
nesses of Telegraph Hill until progress shall remove it. He will
haunt Vallejo Street, and those back slums which so vividly typify
the degradation of a people ; but he will eventually make way
for improvement. The Mission will be last to drop from his nerve-
less fingers.


As I stand here this pleasant afternoon, looking up at the old
chapel,—its ragged senility contrasting with the smart spring
sunshine, its two gouty pillars, with the plaster dropping away like
tattered bandages, its rayless windows, its crumbling entrances,
the leper spots on its whitewashed wall eating through the dark
adobe, —I give the poor old mendicant but a few yearn longer to
sit by the highway and ask alms in the names of the blessed
saints. Already the vicinity is haunted with the shadow of its
dissolution. The shriek of the locomotive discords with the
Angelus bell. An Episcopal church, of a green Gothic type, with
massive buttresses of Oregon pine, even now mocks its hoary
age with imitation and supplants it with a sham. Vain, alas!
were those rural accessories, the nurseries and market-gardens,
that once gathered about its walls and resisted civic encroach-
ment. They, too, are passing away. Even those queer little
adobe buildings wkh tiled roofs like longitudinal slips of cinna-
mon, and walled enclosures sacredly guarding a few bullock horns
and strips of hide. I look in vain for the half-reclaimed Mexican,
whose respectability stopped at his waist, and whose red sash
under his vest was the utter undoing of his black broadcloth. I
miss, too, those black-haired women, with swaying unstable busts,
whose dresses were always unseasonable in texture and pattern ;
whose wearing of a shawl was a terrible awakening from the
poetic dream of the Spanish mantilla. Traces of another nation-
ality are visible. The railroad “ navvy ” has builded his shanty
near the chapel, and smokes his pipe in the Posado. Gutturals
have taken the place of linguals and sibilants ; I miss the half-
chanted, half-drawled cadences that used to mingle with the
cheery “ All aboard ” of the stage-driver, in those good old days
when the stages ran hourly to the Mission, and a trip thither was
an excursion. At the very gates of the temple, in the place of
those “ who sell doves for sacrifice,” a vendor of mechanical
spiders has halted with his unhallowed wares. Even the old
Padre —last type of the Missionary, and descendant of the good
Junipero—l cannot find to-day ;in his stead a light-haired Celt is
reading a lesson from a Vulgate that is wonderfully replete with
double r’s. Gentle priest, in thy E-isons, let the stranger and
heretic be remembered.
I open a little gate and enter the Mission Church-yard. There
is no change here, though perhaps the graves lie closer together.
A willow tree, growing beside the deep, brown wall, has burst
into tufted plumes in the fulness of spring. The tall grass-blades
over each mound show a strange quickening of the soil below.
It is pleasanter here than on the bleak mountain seaward, where
distracting winds continually bring the strife and turmoil of the
ocean. The Mission hills lovingly embrace the little cemetery,
whose decorative taste is less ostentatious. The foreign flavour is
strong ; here are never-failing garlands of immortelles, with their
sepulchral spicery; here are little cheap medallions of pewter,


with the adornment of three black tears, that would look like the
three of clubs, but that the simple humility of the inscription
counterbalances all sense of the ridiculous. Here are children s
graves with guardian angels of great specific gravity; but here,
too, are the little one’s toys in a glass case beside them. Here is
the average quantity of execrable original verses ; but one stanza
—over a sailor’s grave—is striking, for it expresses a hope of
salvation through the “ Lord High Admiral Christ” ! Over the
foreign graves there is a notable lack of scriptural quotation, and
an increase, if I may say iff, of humanity and tenderness. I
cannot help thinking that too many of my countrymen are influ-
enced by a morbid desire to make a practical point of this occa-
sion, and are too apt hastily to crowd a whole life of omission
into the culminating act. But when I see the gray immortelles
crowning a tombstone, I know I shall find the mysteries of the
resurrection shown rather in symbols, and only the love taught in
His new commandment left for the graphic touch. But “ they
manage these things better in France.”
During my purposeless ramble the sun has been steadily climb-
ing the brown wall of the church, and the air seems to grow cold
and raw. The bright green dies out of the grass, and the rich
bronze comes down from the wall. The willow tree seems half
inclined to doff its plumes, and wears the dejected air of a
broken faith and violated trust. The spice of the immortelles
mixes with the incense that steals through the open window.
Within the barbaric gilt and crimson look cold and cheap in this
searching air ; by this light the church certainly is old and ugly.
I cannot help wondering whether the old Father’s, if they ever
revisit the scene of their former labour’s, in their larger comprehen-
sions, view with regret the impending change, or mourn over the
day when the Mission Dolores shall appropriately come to grief.
JOHN CHINAMAN.
The expression of the Chinese face in the aggregate is neither
cheerful nor happy. In an acquaintance of half a dozen years, I
can only recall one or two exceptions to this rule. There is art
abiding consciousness of degradation,—a secret pain or self-humil-
iation visible in the lines of the mouth and eye. Whether it is
only a modification of Turkish gravity, or whether it is the dread
Valley of the Shadow of the Drug through which they are con-
tinually straying, I cannot say. They seldom smile, and their
laughter is of such an extraordinary and sardonic nature—so
purely a'mechanical spasm, quite independent of any mirthful
attribute —that to this day I am doubtful whether I ever saw a
Chinaman laugh. A theatrical representation by natives, one
might think, would have set my mind at ease on this point; but


it did not. Indeed, a new difficulty presented itself, — the impossi-
bility of determining whether the performance was a tragedy or
farce. I thought I detected the low comedian in an active youth
who turned two somersaults, and knocked everybody down on
entering the stage. But, unfortunately, even this classic resem-
blance to the legitimate farce of our civilisation was deceptive.
Another brocaded actor, who represented the hero of the play,
turned three somersaults, and not only upset my theory and his
fellow actors at the same time, but apparently run a-muck behind
the scenes for some time afterward. I looked around at the
glinting white teeth to observe the effect of these two palpable
hits. They were received with equal acclamation, and apparently
equal facial spasms. One or two beheadings which enlivened the
play produced the same sardonic effect, and left upon my mind a
painful anxiety to know what was the serious business of life in
China. It was noticeable, however, that my unrestrained laughter
had a discordant effect, and that triangular eyes sometimes
turned ominously towards the “ Fanqui Devilbut as I retired
discreetly before the play was finished, there were no serious
results, I have only given the above as an instance of the impos-
sibility of deciding upon the outward and superficial expression
of Chinese mirth. Of its inner and deeper existence I have some
private doubts. An audience that will view with a serious aspect
the hero, after a frightful and agonising death, get up and quietly
walk off the stage, cannot be said to have remarkable perceptions
of the ludicrous.
I have often been struck with the delicate pliability of the
Chinese expression and taste, that might suggest a broader and
deeper criticism than is becoming these pages. A Chinaman will
adopt the American costume, and wear it with a taste of colour and
detail that will surpass those “ native and to the manner bom.”
To look at a Chinese slipper, one might imagine it impossible to
shape the original foot to anything less cumbrous and roomy, yet
a neater-fitting boot than that belonging to the Americanised
Chinaman is rarely seen on this side of the Continent. When the
loose sack or paletot takes the place of his brocade blouse, it is worn
■with a refinement and grace that might bring a jealous pang to
the exquisite of our more refined civilisation. Pantaloons fall
easily and naturally over legs that have known unlimited freedom
and bagginess, and even garrote collars meet correctly around
sun-tanned throats. The new expression seldom overflows in gaudy
cravats. I will back my Americanised Chinaman against any
neophyte of European birth in the choice of that article. While
incur own State, the “ Greaser” resists one by one the garments of
the Northern invader, and even wears the livery of his conqueror
with a wild and buttonless freedom, the Chinaman, abused and
degraded as he is, changes by correctly graded transition to the
garments of Christian civilisation. There is but one article of
European wear that he avoids. These Bohemian eyes have never


yet been pained by tbe spectacle of a tall bat on the bead of an
intelligent Chinaman,
My acquaintance with Jobn bas been made up of weekly in-
terviews, involving tbe adjustment of the washing accounts, so
that I have not been able to study bis character from a social
view-point or observe him in the privacy of the domestic circle. I
have gathered enough to justify me in believing him to be gene-
rally honest, faithful, simple, and painstaking. Of his simplicity
let me record an instance where a sad and civil young Chinaman
brought me certain shirts with most of the buttons missing and
others hanging on delusively by a single thread. In a moment of
unguarded irony I informed him that unity would at least have been
preserved if the buttons were removed altogether. He smiled
sadly and went away. I thought I had hurt his feelings, until the
next week when he brought me my shirts with a look of intelli-
gence, and the buttons carefully and totally erased. At another
time, to guard against his general disposition to carry off anything
as soiled clothes that he thought could hold water, I requested him
to always wait until he saw me. Coming home late one evening,
I found the household in great consternation, over an immovable
Celestial who had remained seated on the front doorstep during
the day, sad and submissive, firm but also patient, and only be-
traying any animation or token of his mission when he saw me
coming. This same Chinaman evinced some evidences of regard
for a little girl in the family, who in her turn reposed such faith
in his intellectual qualities as to present him with a preternaturally
uninteresting Sunday school book, her own property. This book
John made a point of carrying ostentatiously with him in his
weekly visits. It appeared usually on the top of the clean clothes,
and was sometimes painfully clasped outside of the big bundle of
solid linen. Whether John believed he unconsciously imbibed
some spiritual life through its pasteboard cover, as the Prince in
the Arabian Nights imbibed the medicine through the handle of
the mallet, or whether he wished to exhibit a due sense of grati-
tude, or whether he had n’t any pockets, I have never been able
to ascertain. In his turn he would sometimes cut marvellous
imitation roses from carrots for his little friend. I am inclined
to think that the few roses strewn in John’s path were such scent-
less imitations. The thorns only were real. From the persecutions
of the young and old of a certain class, his life was a torment. I
don’t know what was the exact philosophy that Confucius taught,
but it is to be hoped that poor John in his persecution is still able
to detect the conscious hate and fear with which inferiority always
regards the possibility of even-handed justice, and which is the
key-note to the vulgar clamour about servile and degraded races.


FKOM A BACK WINDOW.
I REMEMBER that long ago, as a sanguine and trustful child, I
became possessed of a highly coloured lithograph, representing a
fair Circassian sitting by a window. The price I paid for this
work of art may have been extravagant, even in youth’s fluctuat-
ing slate-pencil currency ; but the secret joy I felt in its possession
knew no pecuniary equivalent. It was not alone that Nature ic
Circassia lavished alike upon the cheek of beauty and the vegetable
kingdom that most expensive of colours, —Lake ; nor was it that
the rose which bloomed beside the fair Circassian’s window had
no visible stem, and was directly grafted upon a marble balcony ;
but it was because it embodied an idea. That idea was a hinting
of my Fate. I felt that somewhere a young and fair Circassian
was sitting by a window looking out for me. The idea of resisting
such an array of charms and colour never occurred to me, and to
my honour be it recorded, that during the feverish period of
adolescence I never thought of averting my destiny. But as
vacation and holiday came and went, and as my picture at first
grew blurred, and then faded quite away between the Eastern and
Western continents in my atlas, so its charm seemed mysteriously
to pass away. When I became convinced that few females, of
Circassian or other origin, sat pensively resting their chins on their
henna-tinged nails, at their parlour windows, I turned my atten-
tion to back windows. Although the fair Circassian has not yet
burst upon me with open shutters, some peculiarities not unworthy
of note have fallen under my observation. This knowledge has
not been gained without sacrifice. I have made myself familiar
with back windows and their prospects, in the weak disguise of
seeking lodgings, heedless of the suspicious glances of landladies
and their evident reluctance to show them. I have caught cold
by long exposure to draughts. I have become estranged from
friends by unconsciously walking to their back windows during a
visit, when the weekly linen hung upon the line, or where Miss
Fanny (ostensibly indisposed) actually assisted in the laundry,
and Master Bobby, in scant attire, disported himself on the area
railings. But I have thought of Galileo, and the invariable
experience of all seekers and discoverers of truth has sustained
me.
Show me the back windows of a man's dwelling, and I will tell
you his character. The rear of a house only is sincere. The
attitude of deception kept up at the front windows leaves the back
area defenceless. The world enters at the front door, but nature
comes out at the back passage. That glossy, well-brushed in-
dividual, who lets himself in with a latch-key at the front door at
night, is a very different being from the slipshod wretch who
growls of mornings for hot water at the door of the kitchen.
The same with Madame, whose contour of figure grows angular,


whose face grows pallid, whose hair comes down, and who looks
some ten years older through the sincere medium of a back win-
dow. No wonder that intimate friends fail to recognize each
other in this dos d dos position. You may imagine yourself
familiar with the silver door-plate and bow windows of the man-
sion where dwells your Saccharissa ; you may even fancy you
recognize her graceful figure between the lace curtains of the
upper chamber which you fondly imagine to be here ; but you
shall dwell for months in the rear of her dwelling and within
whispering distance of her bower, and never know it. You shall
see her with a handkerchief tied round her head in confidential
discussion with the butcher, and know her not. You shall hear hex-
voice in shrill expostulation with her younger brother, and it shall
awaken no familiar response,
lam writing at a back window. As I prefer the warmth of my
coal-fire to the foggy freshness of the afternoon breeze that rattles
the leafless shrubs in the garden below me, I have my window-
sash closed ; consequently, I miss much of the shrilly altercation
that has been going on in the kitchen of No. 7 just opposite. I
have heard fragments of an entertaining style of dialogue usually
known as “ chaffing,” which has just taken place between Biddy
in No. 9 and the butcher who brings the dinner. I have been
pitying the chilled aspect of a poor canary, put out to taste the
fresh air, from the window of No. 5. I have been watching—and
envying, I fear, —the real enjoyment of two children raking over
an old dust-heap in the alley, containing the waste and debris of
all the back yards in the neighbourhood. What a wealth of soda-
water bottles and old iron they have acquired 1 But lam waiting
for an even more familiar prospect from my back window. I know
that later in the afternoon, when the evening paper comes, a
thickset, gray-haired man will appear in his shirt-sleeves at the
back door of No. 9, and, seating himself on the door-step, begin to
read. He lives in a pretentious house, and I hear he is a rich man.
But there is such humility in his attitude, and such evidence of
gratitude at being allowed to sit outside of his own house and read
his paper in his shirt-sleeves, that I can picture his domestic
history pretty clearly. Perhaps he is following some old habit of
humbler days. Perhaps he has entered into an agreement with
his wife not to indulge his disgraceful habit in-doors. He does
not look like a man who could be coaxed into a dressing-gown.
In front of his own palatial residence, I know him to be a quiet
and respectable middle-aged business-man, but it is from my back
window that my heart warms towards him in his shirt-sleeved
simplicity. So I sit and watch him in the twilight as he reads
gravely, and wonder sometimes, when he looks up, squares his
chest, and folds his paper thoughtfully over his knee, whether he
rioes n’t fancy he hears the letting down of bare, or the tinkling
of bells, as the cows come home and stand lowing for him at
the gate.


BOONDER.
I NEVER knew how the subject of this memoir came to attach
himself so closely to the affections of my family. He was not a
prepossessing dog. He was not a dog of even average birth and
breeding. His pedigree was involved in the deepest obscurity.
He may have had brothers and sisters, hut in the whole range of
my canine acquaintance (a pretty extensive one), I never detected
any of Boonder’s peculiarities in any other of his species. His
body was long, and his fore-legs and hind-legs were very wide
apart, as though Nature originally intended to put an extra pair
between them, but had unwisely allowed herself to be per-
suaded out of it. This peculiarity was annoying on cold nights,
as it always prolonged the interval of keeping the door open for
Boonder’s ingress long enough to allow two or three dogs of a
reasonable length to enter. Boonder’s feet were decided ; his
toes turned out considerably, and in repose his favourite attitude
was the first position of dancing. Add to a pair of bright eyes,
ears that seemed to belong to some other dog, and a symmetri-
cally pointed nose that fitted all apertures like a pass-key, and
you have Boonder as we knew him.
I am inclined to think that his popularity was mainly owing to
his quiet impudence. His advent in the family was that of an
old member, who had been absent for a short time, but had
returned to familiar haunts and associations. In a Pythagorean
point of view this might have been the case, but I cannot recall
any deceased member of the family who was in life partial to bone-
burying (though it might be post mortem a consistent amusement),
•and this was Boonder’s great weakness. He was at first dis-
covered coiled up on a rug in an upper chamber, and was the
least disconcerted of the entire household. From that moment
Boonder became one of its recognized members, and privileges,
often denied the most intelligent and valuable of his species, were
quietly taken by him and submitted to by us. Thus, if he were
found coiled up in a clothes-basket, or any article of clothing
assumed locomotion on its own account, we only said, “O, it ’s
Boonder,” with a feeling of relief that it was nothing worse.
I have spoken of his fondness for bone-burying. It could not be
called an economical faculty, for he invariably forgot the locality
of his treasure, and covered the garden with purposeless holes ;
but although the violets and daisies were not improved by
Boonder’s gardening, no one ever thought of punishing him. He
became a synonym for Fate ; a Boonder to be grumbled at, to be
accepted philosophically, —but never to be averted. But although
he was not an intelligent dog, nor an ornamental dog, he possessed
some gentlemanly instincts. When he performed his only feat, —
begging upon his hind legs (and looking remarkably like a
penguin), ignorant strangers would offer him crackers or cake,


which he did n’t like, as a reward of merit, Boonder always
made a great show of accepting the proffered dainties, and even
made hypocritical contortions as if swallowing, but always
deposited the morsel when he was unobserved in the first con*
venient receptacle,—usually the visitor’s overshoes.
In matters that did not involve courtesy, Boonder was sincere
in his likes and dislikes. He was instinctively opposed to the rail-
road. When the track was laid through our street, Boonder
maintained a defiant attitude towards every rail as it went down,
and resisted the cars shortly after to the fullest extent of his
lungs. I have a vivid recollection of seeing him, on the day of the
trial trip, come down the street in front of the car, barking him-
self out of all shape, and thrown back several feet by the recoil
of each bark. But Boonder was not the only one who has.
resisted innovations, or has lived to see the innovation prosper and
even crush — But lam anticipating. Boonder had previously
resisted the gas, but although he spent one whole day in angry
altercation with the workmen, —leaving his bones unburied and
bleaching in the sun, —somehow the gas went in. The Spring
Valley water was likewise unsuccessfully opposed, and the grading
of an adjoining lot was for a long time a personal matter between
Boonder and the contractor.
These peculiarities seemed to evince some decided character
and embody some idea. A prolonged debate in the family upon
this topic resulted in an addition to his name, —we called him
“ Boonder the Conservative,” with a faint acknowledgment of his
fateful power. But, although Boonder had his own way, his
path was not entirely of roses. Thorns sometimes pricked his
sensibilities. When certain minor chords were struck on the
piano, Boonder was always painfully affected and howled a
remonstrance. If he were removed for company’s sake to the
back yard, at the recurrence of the provocation, he would go his
whole length (which was something) to improvise a howl that
should reach the performer. But we got accustomed to Boonder,
and as we were fond of music the playing went on.
One morning Boonder left the house in good spirits with his
regular bone in his mouth, and apparently the usual intention of
burying it. The next day he was picked up lifeless on the
track, —run over apparently by the first car that went out of the
depot.
THE END.
