TO THE
OFFICE-BEARERS AND MEMBERS OF THE
FREE CHURCH CONGREGA TION, KIRKURD.
My dear Brethren, —While complying with the
suggestion of esteenjed friends, that I should leave with
you a few parting words, I have not sought to prepare a
formal, farewell discourse. Anxious and irksome pre-
occupation renders it impossible for me to attempt this
delicate and painful task. The Pastoral Letters which I
sent you, during my sojourn in the south of France, have
largely anticipated what I might now have said, and, in
present circumstances, neither minister nor people can
have much heart for further moralizing. Enough, if we
are meekly silent, and stay ourselves, the while, upon our
God.
Still, I am desirous of offering, for your kind accept-
ance, what may serve as a simple memorial of my brief
ministry among you, that we may the better keep each
other in prayerful and affectionate remembrance ; and as
the following discourse lay readiest to my hand, I have
consented to its publication. Most of you will recognise
it as the sermon I preached on my recent return from a
prolonged health-exile on the shores of the Mediterranean,
when I was still fondly hoping to resume, permanently,
my labours among you. Written in much weakness, and
without any ulterior intention, I am quite aware that my
simple words do not merit their present publicity. But
they serve my purpose sufficiently well. And as I know
that some of you found them to be “ words in season,”


when first spoken, I believe that the Lord will graciously
own and bless them, in their present form, for your com-
fort and edification.
I cannot close these parting lines, without giving ex-
pression to the devout gratitude which I feel, in making
the retrospect of my brief ministry. The mutual for-
bearance, genuine kindliness, and prayerful regard which
have largely existed among us, and without which the
Pastoral relation is so formal and barren, have made my
labours light and pleasant. And it is right for me to tell
you, that you may be encouraged to meet my Successor
in the same spirit, how greatly I have been stimulated
and sustained, in my varied duties, by the assurance I had,
that my people duly appreciated the difficulties which a
young minister has to overcome, and the sympathy he
needs, as he slowly rises to the true measure of his work,
and, only after repeated failures, learns the best way of
doing it. With the members of Session I have always
enjoyed much brotherly intercourse, and cordial co-opera-
tion. I have to confess to a sad, yet real and abiding
pleasure, in recalling happy hours with my Bible-class,
my occasional services for the young, and the monthly
meetings with my fellow-labourers in the Sunday school,
where our hearts were often enlarged, and gracious bap-
tisms of the Holy Spirit vouchsafed. In no part of my
work have I enjoyed more liberty in preaching Christ,
and have now ground to cherish a livelier hope that
abiding good has been accomplished, than in our quiet
Sabbath-evening gatherings among your upland homes,
and, more recently, in another place of meeting, where,
with no claim on my part, I have been received with rare
Christian courtesy, and encouraged by cordial co-opera-
tion in the Lord’s work. It is likewise pleasant and


helpful to recall one and another sick-bed, where I was a
humble learner, as well as solemn scenes in the spiritual
histories of some of you—alas! that they have been so
rare —when the great life-choice was made, or the weary
struggle with doubt and darkness passed away in the
peace of believing.
But while we fondly linger over these hallowed me-
mories, and feel constrained to adore the marvellous
loving-kindness of our God, are we not keenly sensible
that the best of us have been unprofitable servants ? And
is it not with a sense of intense relief, and profound grati-
tude that, over against the humbling consciousness of
manifold shortcomings and grievous backsliding, since
we first began to walk in the light, as He is in the light,
and to have fellowship one with another, in working out
our own salvation, and in winning souls to the Saviour,
we can now place, in its heart-assuring sufficiency, this
special gospel to the believer, “ The blood of Jesus Christ,
His Son, deans eth us from all sin ” I
And now that, in God’s holy providence, our present
Pastoral relations are soon to be dissolved, I know no
better words to utter, in bidding you farewell, than those
which form the text of the accompanying discourse, and
which so largely alleviate, in the case of God’s children,
the sorrows of separation—“ Underneath are the Ever-
lasting Arms." Here we have refuge and rest, “quiet-
ness and assurance for ever.” And while, in view of
what may. be before me, I would still ask you, prayerfully
and affectionately, to remember him who has had for a
while the rule over you, and who has spoken to you the
Word of God, 1 would urge you, more earnestly, to
consider, trust, and cling to Him who has, in some
small measure, been the spring, centre, and end of my


teaching and my life—“ Jesus Christ the same yesterday,
and to-day, and for ever" (Heb. xiii. 7,8). The Good
Shepherd ever abideth with His flock. He will provide
another pastor to shepherd His sheep and feed His
lambs; and He will make the things which have hap-
pened to me to fall out rather to the furtherance of the
Gospel.
And sharing with you, as I humbly trust, the blessed
shelter of these Everlasting Arms, we need not greatly
sorrow at our temporary separation. The angels of God
are ever ministering unto the heirs of salvation; and at
every turning-point in our pilgrim life, the old Bethel-
vision and the old Bethel-promise are graciously renewed.
Ah, dear brethren, let us see to it, that none of us are in
danger of being involved in the last, despairing, irrever-
sible Farewell which awaits the impenitent; let us seek
so to live in the love of God, and in the patient waiting
for Christ, that, at last, to use the words with which the
ministry now closing was begun, “ We may present every
man petfect in Christ Jesus''
“ Then, hand in hand, firm link’d at last.
And heart with heart enfolded all;
We’ll smile upon the troubled past,
And wonder why we wept at all.”
Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good
comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of
love and peace shall be with you.
I am,
Your faithful and affectionate Minister,
ARCH”. N. MACKRAY.
Free Manse, Kirkurd,
12th Sept. 1867.


Deut,
xxxiii. 27,
“ Underneath are the Everlasting Arms —A simple
“ household word” among the family of the faithful—
known and loved by the little children of the kingdom,
yet pregnant with mysteries of grace and glory to the
saints before the throne! The birthright of every be-
liever ; its preciousness is felt chiefly when we are weak
and weary amid the cares and sorrows of our pilgrim-life.
Solace of the afflicted, and stay of the helpless, it comes
to us, to-day, from many a scene of strife and agony, from
the lowly couch of, pain, from the beds of the dying, and
the graves of the dead —a sure and tried word, challenging
our immediate acceptance, and laying its soothing spell
upon our hearts !
Moses, the man of God, has gathered the thousands
of Israel, to look upon them for the last time, and to
leave with them his parting blessing. As the Tribes
marshal themselves before their aged Leader, the Spirit
of prophecy is given to him; and in words of loftiest
conception, and most glowing imagery, he describes their
varied destinies, and pronounces upon each tribe its own


appropriate benediction. But, while the blessings are
diverse, I bid you mark, that all are blessed. For, now
that the dark and terrible wilderness has been left behind,
and the Promised Land is so near, their aged king and
lawgiver gazes fondly on his people, and strong in the
faith of the covenant made aforetime with their fathers, —
nay, dimly anticipating, may we not say, the advent of
that Prophet like unto himself, whom the Lord God
should yet raise up from among their brethren, in whom
both Jew and Gentile should alike be blessed, his heart
is thrilled with the glorious vision vouchsafed, and he
breaks forth, as he closes, into this jubilant hymn of
which our text forms the spring and centre: “ There is
none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
the heaven in thy help, and in His excellency on the
sky. The Eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath are
the Everlasting Arms." And, while Moses, the man of
God, has long since entered into his rest; and while
the tribes whom he blessed are scattered in judgment
over the face of the earth, his words remain to this day,
far more significant than when they were first uttered.
For, as we read this Old Testament page, so full of type
and shadow, in the clearer light of the Gospel, is it not
the true spiritual Israel of God, whom we see gathered
before us, and does not Moses give place to the one true
Prophet of the Lord, whom it was his highest glory dimly
to prefigure, and whom we here behold, awarding to each
member of His Church his meed of blessing, while He
includes them all, as well “little Benjamin” as the greater


Joseph or Naphtali, in this common heritage, which He
died to purchase, and now lives to confer and secure :
“ The Eternal God is thy refuge , and underneath are the
Everlasting Arms I'
Yes, brethren! None save Jesus, the God-man, can
utter, and none save His believing people can appro-
priate, such words as these. For is not this the sum and
substance of His own glorious Gospel, that, believing in
Him, the Eternal God is now our refuge, or, as the word
is rendered in Psalm xc., our “dwelling-place,” our home;
nay, more, central blessing of that Father’s home, “un-
derneath are the Everlasting Arms.” One Gospel from
first to last, —heritage of the Faithful in all ages, these
words of the Hebrew Lawgiver were handed on from seer
to seer. We find them repeated and expanded throughout
the Evangelical prophecies, until they are at last taken
up and glorified in that utterance of the Master Himself,
of whom Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms did
testify —“ I give unto my sheep eternal life; and they
shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of
my hand” (John x. 27-31).
Looking, then, at our text from this point of view, the
great fact which it embodies may be considered in these
three aspects, as —
I. The Ground of the Believer’s Safety.
11. The Source of his Peace and Joy.
HI. The Pledge of his final Triumph.
I. Security, safety —that is the first thought which the


words suggest. Why, O child of God, are you assured
of full and final salvation, in face of heaven, earth, and
hell ? Is it not on this ground alone, that “ underneath
are the Everlasting Arms?”
The words carry back our thoughts into the mysteries
of a past eternity, out of whose illimitable depths, Faith
rejoices to behold the arms of Love stretching forth!
Had my text a meaning then ? Were these “ Everlasting
Arms” ever empty? Did God once dwell alone? Nay,
brethren, it is the Father who “ inhabiteth eternity,” and
in His bosom from eternity lay the Eternal Son; so that
my text is true pre-eminently of Him who was in the
beginning, and who alone could say, “ The Lord possessed
me in the beginning of His ways, before His works of
old.” Yes, brethren, I beseech you to fix your mind on
this original application of the text; get your souls filled
with thoughts of that eternal and ineffable communion
and glory which the Son had with the Father before the
world was; for only thus can you rightly understand the
bearing of this Old Testament Gospel on every believer
in Christ, whose glorious privilege it is to enter into the
same sonship-relation, and thus to be eternally and in-
effably safe! Thou Eternal Word! coequal with the
Father : O Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the
world! we give Thee the glory, and we confess that these
words are true, originally and pre-eminently, of Thyself,
and true of us, only because they have been eternally
true of Thee, —“The Eternal God is Thy refuge, and
underneath are the Everlasting Arms.”


Twice has the Son of God come forth from the Ever-
lasting Arms—the bosom of His Father— -first, on His
sublime mission of creation, when He placed upon the
throne of the virgin-earth His creature, man, formed in
the divine image, and fitted to commune with His God
under the shelter of*these Arms. And once again, in the
fulness of the times, on the still nobler mission of re-
demption, when man had long fallen from his glorious
creation-standing, and had so become the prey of guilt,
and fear, and lawlessness, and godlessness, and death,
that the eternal God could be no longer the Refuge and
Home of the human spirit —rather were the Everlasting
Arms upraised in truth, and righteousness, and terrible
majesty, against the sinner ! Then it was, that the Son
left His Father’s bosom, and threw in His lot with our
fatherless, curse-burdened race, and came to us, full ot
grace and truth, to tell us of the Father, whom we had
so grievously wronged, and the Father’s home, from
which we had so hopelessly wandered —not to. mock our
misery, but that He might thereby bring us to ourselves,
and awaken Godward, Homeward yearnings, while He
revealed Himself as the one, and only Way to the
Father’s Arms ! “ God hath sent forth His son . . .
that we might receive the adoption of sons.” For, as
our Head and Representative, He passed underneath
the Everlasting Arms of righteousness and truth—took,
voluntarily, upon Himself the dread burden of guilt and
wrath which made our access to the Holy Father im-
possible ; nailed the scroll of banishment to His cross,


and cancelled its deadly handwriting in His blood —
finished transgression, made an end of sin, and brought
in an everlasting righteousness! Oh ! how the Father
loved the Son in thus accomplishing that work of re-
demption, which had been planned, and decreed, and
rejoiced in, as He lay, from eternity, in these Everlasting
Arms ! What a glorious, inviolable seal the Father put
upon the finished work of the Son in raising Him from
the dead, and restoring Him, anew, to the Everlasting
Arms —“first-bom among many brethren”! And what
joy, too, was the Son’s, as He saw of “ the travail of His
soul,” and was not ashamed to call us “ brethren ”
saying, ere He left this earth, “ I ascend unto My
Father, and your Father, and unto My God, and your
God.”
And is it not now abundantly plain, that my text
signalizes the very glory of Christ’s salvation, in that He
gives us a place —His own place —in the Father’s bosom,
and so identifies us with Himself, in His crown, as in
His cross, that we are set down with Him on His
throne, and are loved by the Father with the very love
which He bears to Him, His only begotten Son !
And hence, the grand old words of the dying Moses
are true in all their amplitude, of the humblest believer
in Christ, even as, and just because they are true of Christ
Himself—“ The eternal God is thy refuge; and under-
neath are the Everlasting Arms.” And do they not
therefore supply to us ground of safety which is impreg-
nable and eternal ?


So nigh, so very nigh to God
I cannot nearer be.
For in the person of His Son
I am as near as He.
So dear, so very dear to God,
More dear I cannot be !
The love wherewith He loves the Son,
Such is His love to me !”
“ U7iderneath are the Everlasting Arms” Every word
is most significant. All the elements of safety are here
contained.
1. Power. —The arm is the symbol of strength. It is
the shield of the weak and the helpless ! The rallying
cry of Israel of old, our defence is still “ the arm of the
Lord” “ Behold the Lord will come with strong hand,
and His arm shall rule for Him; behold His reward is
with Him, and His work before Him.”
2, Love. —What touching tenderness is seen in the
setting of the text! The arm of the Lord is not simply
stretched out for us — on our behalf. The phrase is so
turned as to convey the exquisite thought that this Omni-
potence is wielded by Love ! “ Underneath are these
arms.” What sight more touching, among ourselves,
than to see the brawny arm that may have stood the
shock of battle, or has become inured to laborious toil,
gently, yet securely upholding the tender wife, and
mother, or the feeble child! The text appeals to our
common instincts: and you parents, who are wont to
clasp your helpless babes to your breasts, and feel the
strong arms that are thrown around them, thrilling with
love and tenderness, you ought to be able to appreciate,


and respond to the matchless blending of love and
power, which these words exhibit!
And it is always so. The Lord is, at once, able and
willing to save. And hence, in the Scripture we have
already quoted, having described the saving power of
Jehovah Jesus, the prophet immediately passes on to
illustrate His saving love: “He shall feed his flock like
a shepherd : He shall gather the lambs with His arm,
and carry them in His bosom, and shall gently lead those
that are with young.”—Isa, xl. n.
3. Unchangeableness. —This, the only other element
necessary to constitute perfect security, is also contained
in our text. The arms which are “ underneath ” are
“everlasting,” — safe, and always safe. The love and power,
which are on our side, are so unchangeably. Ah ! it is the
sweetest word of the three—this “everlasting.” Blessed be
God, it is written as with a sunbeam in His word, and I
cannot give it up, that, once embraced in these arms, I
am safe for ever. From the Father’s bosom none can
perish. As it was not myself that brought me thither, so
it is not myself that keeps me there. My present and
eternal salvation stands or falls with Him whose royal
word remains unreversed: “I give unto my sheep eternal
life : and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck
them out of my hand.”
11. Passing now to the second, and more prominent
aspect ot the text, if our previous remarks have had any
force in them—if you have become in any measure, alive


to the nature and extent of the Christian’s security, in
the embrace of the Everlasting Arms, you can have no
difficulty in perceiving how my text likewise discloses the
source of the believer's abiding peace a?id joy. It gives the
secret of a serene and happy life.
For, brethren, if you would be at peace with God, and
with yourselves (and these two are inseparable), if you
would possess and retain, amid all your cares and sor-
rows, a quietly-gladsome spirit —
“ And a heart at leisure from itself
To soothe and sympathize,”
this must come, in the first instance, not so much from
your trying to be, or do anything to God, as from your
humble, genuine, and immediate faith in what God is,
and does to you. Only let me be assured that the Ever-
lasting Arms have, in “ marvellous loving kindness” been
outstretched on my behalf; that they are now “under-
neath,” and that I shall never be removed from their strong,
loving, eternal grasp, and I may well “ rejoice in the
Lord always.” I need “be careful for nothing, but in
everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving,
I may make my requests known to God; and the peace
of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep my
heart and mind through Jesus Christ.”
And let no man say, as is too often affirmed in our
current literature, that I am now urging you to secure
your happiness in a course of unworthy selfishness. Ah !
would to God that all men were become so nobly selfish,
as, not for the whole world, to lose their own souls!


To be embraced in the Everlasting Arms is the utter
destruction of selfishness. A true and noble life is attain-
able only when I come to know that I am no longer my
own, but one of God’s redeemed —in the Everlasting
Arms with Christ, drawing my very life from the bosom
of Jehovah ! His arms are “ underneath ,” —l am dwelling
in the central home of holiness and truth—God is work-
ing in me, both to will and to do; and, therefore, I am
working out my own salvation with fear and trembling.
I bruise Satan under my feet. Henceforth I live not
unto myself, but unto Him who died for me, and rose
again. His arms are “ underneath,” —and immediately, at
any cost, I must seek to bring other weary wanderers
to the same blessed shelter! “ Master, where dwellest
Thou ?" is still the plaintive cry of every awakened
sinner; and the Master’s response is still the same,
“ Come and see." And still the disciples come and see
where He dwells, and they abide with Him. And what
follows ? Has selfishness any place ? Nay, brethren !
“ Andrew first findeth his own brother, Simon, and saith
to him, we have found the Christ: and he brought him to
Jesus.”
A quiet, gladsome, buoyant spirit is the great need of
the Israel of God, in every age; and the glorious fact
which my text embodies forms the one abundant spring
of her abiding peace and joy. Let me try to put this
choice word of consolation over against some of the
many provocatives to fear and sadness which encompass
our pilgrim-life.


Foremost, and chiefest of these —’ever becoming more
terrible as we advance in the Christian life, is the dread
mystery of Sin. A world of sinners around us ; and a
world of sin within us ! Yet even here there is, for every
burdened heart, abundant consolation, in these grand old
words of Moses, the man of God. For they assure us,
first, that it is not now, as once it was;- “ underneath ,"
there are no longer the ever-deepening depths of guilt,
and corruption, and death, and hell. Our God has taken
the full measure of these depths. His loving arms have
forced a way between us and our sins, and, in the Cross
of His own Son, He has made a sure and final separation,
—raising us up into newness of life, so that now, and ever-
more, in spite of every foe, —world, flesh, or devil, around
and underneath us are “the Everlasting Arms.” The
brand, though black and charred, has been plucked from
the burning, and the good work will be carried on unto
perfection. “He shall thrust out the enemy from before
thee, and shall say, destroy them." For, secondly, It is in
the Everlasting Arms you are kept secure —in the
Father’s bosom, where sin can have neither power, nor
place. You dwell in the native home of all that is pure,
and lovely, and of good report. The far country, with its
riotous living, has lost its attractions now. You feel in
the depths of your being a thorough recoil from sin.
You have become partakers of the divine nature, and
“ whosoever is born of God, overcometh the world.” The
last Enemy shall be destroyed. “ Israel shall dwell alone
in safety.” Let trembling hearts be reassured; let us


brace us anew to the conflict, and drinking of the brook
in the way, even before the dread mystery of sin, let us
have peace and joy in believing that still, “underneath
are the Everlasting Arms.”
Again, what a source of comfort does my text supply
to the Christian amid the varied duties and trials of life.
For if there be any truth in our previous remarks —if
the great fact of the text be true, originally, of the
Eternal Son, and true of us, only because we are identified
with Him, and are now animated, and ruled by His Spirit,
leading us to cry “Abba, Father then, fellow-believers
in Christ, let us remember that as He was , so now are
we in this world. My life may be obscure, solitary, and
sad. Nay, if it is conformed to the life of Christ, it will
be a life of cross-bearing from first to last. But I shall
live it out, as He did, in the Everlasting Arms. Enough,
that it is all the outcome of my Father’s will, and that in
its most lonesome scenes, and darkest hours, I am able
to say, “ I am not alone, for the Father is with me.”
Young men, sons and daughters of toil, rejoicing in the
exuberance of health and strength ! Have you learned
how weak you are ? Have you fled to the blessed shelter
of the Everlasting Arms, taking, once for all, and every
day afresh, a life and death-grip of Christ ? Ah ! now
does the Father send you to do your share of the world’s
work ; and well may you work manfully, conscientiously,
perseveringly, gladsomely ! At the plough, in the kitchen,
on your farm, the eye of our Father is upon you. His
hand upholds you. His heart yearns over you. Oh,


begin your life, and go through with it, as Christ, the Son
and the Servant did, “ Wist ye not that I must be about my
Fathers business ?”
And those of us on whom the shadows are gathering
apace, who are drinkingof His cup, and bowing beneath
His baptism of suffering, “ let us not despise the chasten-
ing of the Lord, nor faint, when we are rebuked of Him.”
Does not the text seem written for ourselves ? In the
Father’s bosom ! Embraced by “ the Everlasting Arms” 1
What can we need beside ? Is greater blessedness con-
ceivable ?
O Lord, my God ; do Thou Thy holy will !
I will lie still:
I will not stir, lest I forsake Thine arm,
And break the charm
Which lulls me, clinging to my Father’s breast,
In perfect rest.
And, finally, Brethren, need I remind you what a stay and
solace this Old Testament promise is, and has been proved
to be by thousands, when life’s troubled scene is closing,
and when, suddenly, or after weary months and years of
patient suffering, God sends His angel of death to call
His children home ? How near and strong, and all-
sufficient these Everlasting Arms, when ours are trembling
in the last embrace! In silent trustfulness, or in soft
broken utterances, the dying saint commits himself once
more into his Father’s hands; and, falling asleep in Jesus,
the Everlasting Arms close around him. He is “ for ever
with the Lord !”


111. There is still another aspect in which my text
may be considered, —the ground of the believeds safety ,
and the source of his serenity and joy; it is likewise the
pledge of his full and final blessedness.
It is to comfort and reassure his fainting people that
Moses speaks these words. He must leave them on the
borders of that “ terrible wilderness,” where their fathers
perished. Jordan rolls between them and the land of
promise; and their foes are many and strong. But
“ there is none like unto the God of Jeshurun.” The
past is ample pledge for the future. To have the Ever-
lasting Arms underneath, is a germinating, all-inclusive
blessing. For “He will thrust out the enemy,” and
“ Israel shall dwell in safety alone ; the fountain of Jacob
shall be upon a land of corn and wine, also his heavens
shall drop down dew.” Hence, even now, on this side
Jordan, they may raise their song of triumph, “ Happy art
thou, O Israel; who is like unto thee, O people, saved by
the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of
thy excellency !” And this presage of future blessedness
belongs, most fully, to the true Israel of God. “We are
saved in hope.” Our salvation is daily nearer than when
we believed. But we do not now see our Father’s face.
Strangers and pilgrims on the earth, we have not yet
reached home ! More urgently than Israel of old before
the swellings of Jordan, do we need a sure pledge that
we shall not perish as miserable castaways. Ah ! how we
crave, at times, for an abiding assurance of full and final
salvation ! And it is graciously vouchsafed. In this sure


I.
word of promise, the Eternal God pledges Himself to His
people, takes possession of them as His inheritance, and,
bearing them, even now, as on eagles’ wings, assures
them that He will, finally, bring them to Himself.
Blessed pledge and seal of final triumph ! What patience
and forbearance, what love and faithfulness are mani-
fested by our God, as, keeping us, the while, in His
Everlasting Arms, He so orders and arranges the details
of our lives, and the supplies of His grace, as to prepare
us for Himself, and meeten the children for their eternal
home. As a gifted and devoted Christian friend wrote
me some months ago—“ if we could see the heights
whither these Everlasting Arms are finally to raise us, we
would not wonder at the preparation we get down in the
depths ! ” Preparation ! Let us carry this thought with
us, as the solution of life’s saddest anomalies. For earth
is so fair, and friends so dear, and work so bracing, and
health so enjoyable, that we are fain to have our heaven
here, and now; and very vague and languid are our
desires for “ a better country.” And hence the Ever-
lasting Arms, while they continue “underneath,” bring us
into darksome depths, and draw us Heavenward. God
gently, yet effectually, weans us to Himself; health
fails; friends are scattered; homes are rifled of their
treasures, and earth’s cisterns run dry. Then, at length
—not, indeed, as soured misanthropes—not that we love
these less, but that we love Jesus more, we confess that
we are strangers and pilgrims, and declare plainly that
we are seeking “a better country.” Heaven becomes a


greater reality than earth. We look for “a city which
hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.”
About eighty miles from the Western Riviera, where I
sojourned last winter, lies the island-home of the First
Napoleon. From such a distance it is rarely visible by
day. Only the blue waters of the Mediterranean, spark-
ling in the brilliant sunshine, meet the eye. But at early
morn, and when the sun begins to sink behind the bold
Alpine ranges, the dark outline of Corsica becomes dis-
tinctly visible, just where sea and sky appear to blend,
and its snowy peaks grow luminous for a while, until the
night-shadows fall. And often, as I wandered along that
distant shore, it seemed to me that something similar
happened to God’s children as they linger on the sands of
time. In the hot glare of working days —toiling, doubt-
ing, sinning, sorrowing, “the better country” casts but the
faintest shadow on our horizon. We know that it is
yonder; and we cling to the hope that “underneath are
the Everlasting Arms.” But the Father’s face we seldom
see, and the Father’s home seems “ very far off.”
Yet there comes, sooner or later, to each of us, and
never, surely, too soon, the holy quiet of evening. Work
must cease. The voice of the Master is heard : “ Come
ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while.”
From the farm-yard, the counting-house, or the pulpit, we
pass to the sick chamber and the couch of pain. A
softened light falls all around. The fashion of this world
passes away. God’s gifts merge in Himself. Home-
yearnings grow mighty. The pledge and its fruition


appear, like sun and stars, in the same sky. The hills of
holiness stand out in their unsullied purity. Our true
Fatherland is near. The glory “ that dwelleth in Im-
manuel’s land” fills the soul. And we are constrained to
exclaim, with John Welsh of Ayr : “ Lord, hold thy hand.
It is enough. Thy servant is a clay vessel, and can hold
no more.”
Serve yourselves heirs, fellow believers, to this heritage
of bliss. It is all your own. Receive the pledge and seal
thereof anew to-day, as, in the silence of chastened,
trustful, loving hearts, you surrender yourselves, unre-
servedly, to your own God and Saviour, and believe the
word which I am commissioned to declare : “ The Eternal
God is thy refuge; and underneath are the Everlasting
Arms." Greatly helpful to myself through long months
of physical prostration and mental anxiety, and now un-
speakably precious in the view of a prolonged, mayhap,
final separation from country and kindred, and those whom
“I greatly long after in the bowels of Jesus Christ,” 1
thank my God that I have been permitted to unfold
to you, once more, this gracious and inexhaustible promise
of the Father, believing that thus I shall best comfort
you in present sorrows, “by the comfort wherewith I
myself am comforted of God.”
But my text bears another message which I may not
conceal. Brightest lights have darkest shadows. “ The
acceptable year of the Lord” closes with “ the day of
vengeance.” There is such a thing as “ the wrath of the
Lamb."


Having “ the Everlasting Arms underneath,’ 1 you are
safe, happy, triumphant. But some of you have not yet
fled to this blessed shelter. The Eternal God is not your
Refuge. It were cruel mockery to speak of Him as your
Home ! Ah, Brethren, it sadly mars the joy of meeting
again, after our long separation, if, as I fear, some of you
still remain in sin, formality, and ruinous self-compla-
cency, —unrepentant and unsaved ! Are you willing —
can you hear it —that another ministry, which, as I can
testify, was begun in the earnest hope, and anxious striving
that I might “ present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,”
should become, in your case, “ the savour of death unto
death ?” Read, I pray you, the solemn words which, not
arbitrarily, but of necessity, follow the gracious assurance
of my text; and, by the love we bear each other, by the
tender memories of the past, by the worth of your im-
mortal spirits, by the Cross of Christ, and by His coming
to judgment, ponder the dread alternative : “ The Eternal
Cod is thy Refuge, and underneath are the Everlasting
Arms : and He shall thrust out the enemy from before thee;
and shall say, destroy them." Yes ! it must be so. For
only then shall Israel dwell in safety alone, in these Arms
“ where there is fulness of joy,” and at His right hand,
“ where there are pleasures for evermore.” Amen.
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of
Cod, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with
you all. Amen.
