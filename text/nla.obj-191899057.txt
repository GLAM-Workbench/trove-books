FOREWORD.
1. It can fairly be said that the repatriation system of Australia
compares very favorably with, that of any of the belligerent countries
engaged in tbe war of 1914-1918; its provisions are liberal, and
generally they have been applied sympathetically and wisely.
2. By amending legislation of 1935, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment introduced a new scheme of repatriation assistance which is now
known as the “ Service Pension ”.
3. The fundamental basis of this type of pension is that it may be
paid irrespective of the cause of the disability which renders the
ex-member of the Porces incapable of taking his or her place in the
industrial and economic life of the community.
4. This booklet endeavours to set out clearly and concisely the
provisions of this new pension provision.
To those who are found to be eligible within the terms of the Act,
the following represent the maximum rates of pension which may be
paid:—
A Single Man .. .. . . 38s. Per Fortnight
A Man and Wife .. • • 645. „ „
whilst, in addition, pensions may be awarded to eligible children up
to four in number under 16 years of age, at the rate of ss. per
fortnight each.
5. The service pension will be a stimulus to the self-esteem of many
men —it will carry a message of hope to those more seriously
incapacitated, and will be a definite and lasting assurance that the
Government and people of Australia are anxious to do anything within
reason to assist them.
W. M. HUGHES,
Minister for Health and Repatriation.

Australian Soldiers’ Repatriation Act 1920-1936.
SERVICE PENSIONS.
INTRODUCTORY.
1. Service pensions were instituted by the Commonwealth by
provisions incorporated in the Australian Soldiers’ Repatriation Act,
the administration of which is vested in the Repatriation Commission.
The provisions, which operate from Ist January, 1936, cover a new
phase of pension legislation, and this Handbook is therefore issued
as a guide to pensioners, intending applicants, or others interested.
It is designed to explain the portions of the relevant statutes which
are of more direct concern to the applicant or pensioner. As it does
not state those portions in exact terms, and does not reproduce the
whole of the legislation, the Handbook is not to be regarded as a
substitution for the statutes by which all concerned are necessarily
bound. In some respects the legislation is similar to the law of the
Commonwealth governing invalid and old-age pensions, and as a feature
of such system of pensions is that the rates of pension vary with material
changes in the official figures relating to cost of living, it is possible
that service pensions also may vary from time to time.
PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION: PERSONS ELIGIBLE.
'2. The purpose of this new type of pension is to provide relief for
certain classes of members of the Forces who are resident in the
Commonwealth. Member of the Forces is the term used in the Act —
it means any person (male or female) who was enlisted or appointed
for naval or military service in the Commonwealth Forces in the
Great War of 1914-1918, and includes persons who had active service
in the Imperial Forces, or in the Forces of other Dominions, provided
that, immediately prior to such service with the Imperial or Dominion
Forces, the person was domiciled in the Commonwealth. In this
Handbook, the term “ member ” will be used in referring to eligible
members of the Forces.
3. In certain cases, the member’s wife, and his children (up to
and including the fourth child) under the age of 16 years, are also
eligible, provided the wife was married to the member, or the children
were born, prior to 2nd October, 1931, and provided that they are
resident in the Commonwealth. If a child is a step-child or an adopted
child, it will be eligible only if dependent upon the member prior to
2nd July, 1931. A wife or child cannot be granted a service pension
unless such pension is payable to, or in respect of, the member.
6896.-2.


ELIGIBILITY: CLASSES AND RELATIVE
CONDITIONS.
4. The classes of persons for whom relief by way of service pension
is provided are three in number, but a person cannot receive, at the
one time, pension under more than one class. The conditions attaching
to the grant vary according to the class, and therefore, in the following
paragraphs, each class is described separately, together with the
conditions affecting eligibility which distinguish such class from the
others. Other conditions relating to eligibility of all classes are dealt
with later on. As rates will now be mentioned, and as such are
expressed as so much per fortnight, the abbreviation p.f. is used.
5. Class A. —A male member is eligible under Class A if he has
reached 60 years of age and has served in a theatre of war (see
Appendix D) ; and a female member is eligible if she has reached
the age of 55 years and has served abroad, or embarked for service
abroad. The wife or child of a member in this class is not eligible
for service pension. The maximum rate of service pension for the
member is 38s. p.f. He cannot receive service pension and, at the
same time, invalid or old-age pension.
6. Class B. —A male member is eligible under this class if the
appropriate authority is satisfied that he served in a theatre of war
(see Appendix D), and also that, by reason of physical or mental
disablement, he is permanently unemployable, even though such
disablement was not the result of his service in the Great War. In
the case of a female member, the same conditions apply, except that
service abroad need not have been in a theatre of war. “ Permanently
unemployable ” is defined in the Act as meaning permanently incapable,
by reason of physical or mental disablement, of being employed in a
remunerative occupation. The wife and children (up to and including
four) of the member may also be granted service pensions. If the
member is unmarried, or a widower, the maximum rate of pension
is 38s. p.f. In some cases such rate may also be paid to a married
member if his wife is not eligible for a grant. If his wife, or wife and
children, are to be granted pensions, then the maximum rates would
beMember, 325. p.f.; wife, 325. p.f.; each child, ss. p.f. (total, 20s.
p.f. for four children), making the total service pensions of the
family £4 4s. p.f. A pensioner, either member or wife, under this
class cannot receive service pension and, at the same time, invalid or
old-age pension.
7. Class C. —A member is eligible under Class C if the appropriate
authority is satisfied that he is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis,
even though such condition is not the result of service in the Great
War, and even though his service was not in a theatre of war. As
regards eligibility of his wife and children, and the relative rates to


be paid according to whether he is married, unmarried, or a widower,
&c., the conditions are the same as for Class B. A member under
Class C is entitled to receive both service pension and invalid or old-age
pension at the same time, but this applies only to him—not to his
wife, and even the member cannot be paid both pensions at maximum
rates, vide paragraph 9, and paragraphs 19 to 24.
ELIGIBILITY: CONDITIONS GENERAL TO ALL
CLASSES.
8. The following conditions are common to all applicants for
service pension, whether under Class A, B, or C. Assuming that a
person could qualify under one of those classes, the question whether
he could be granted a pension, and, if so, at what rate, depends upon
his financial position.
Othee Income.
9. If the applicant has income of 635. p.f. (£Bl 18s. per annum) or
more, service pension is not payable. The relative provision in the
Act is that service pension shall not be granted at such a rate as will
make the total income of the person exceed £Bl 18s. per annum. In
the references hereinafter to the income of an applicant from sources
other than service pension, the term “ other income ” will he used. Such
other income includes personal earnings, war pension, and any moneys,
valuable consideration, or profits earned, derived, or received by any
person for his own use or benefit by any means from any source
whatever; but does not include —
(a) Friendly Society benefits;
(h) Payments during illness, infirmity, or old-age from any
trade union,. provident society, or other society or
association;
(c) Gifts or allowances from husband, wife, father, mother, or
children;
( d ) Sustenance or food relief, or wages received in lieu thereof,
except in cases where service pension is excluded from
income for the purpose of detexunining the eligibility of
a person for such assistance.
10. In the case of a married person applying for a service pension,
the other income to be taken into consideration is deemed to be
half the total combined other income of the husband and wife (even
in cases where the member only is eligible for service pension). "Where
they are living apart pursuant to a decree, judgment, order, or deed of
separation, the other income to be taken into consideration is that of
the party applying for pension.


Property.
11. In addition to income, the value of an applicant’s property
may affect the rate of service pension payable. Certain exemptions are
allowed, the chief of which is that a home owned and occupied by
an applicant is not taken into account as property for assessment of
pension. The value of the property is determined in accordance with
the following provisions:—
(a) All real and personal property owned by the pensioner is
held to be his accumulated property. This includes land,
houses, money in bank, money owing to claimant, shares
in companies, investments, life assurance policies, &c.
(&) From the value of such accumulated property are deducted
the value of a home in which a pensioner permanently
resides, and all charges and encumbrances lawfully and
properly existing on property, other than the home.
All further references hereinafter to property or the value of property
mean the net value of property assessed as indicated above.
12. In the case of a married person applying for a service pension,
the property to be taken into consideration is deemed to he half the
total combined property of the husband and wife (even in cases where
the member only is eligible for service pension). Where they are
living apart pursuant to a decree, judgment, order, or deed of separation,
the property to be taken into consideration is that of the party applying
for pension.
13. Where the total value of property does not exceed £5O, the rate
of service pension is not affected. Thus an exemption of £5O is allowed
in all cases; where the husband only is eligible, the exemption is £5O,
and where both husband and wife are eligible, the exemption is £25 for
each.
14. If an applicant possesses property of the value of £4OO or
over (or £BOO or over in the case of husband and wife living together),
service pension is not payable.
15. In the remaining cases, that is, where the value of property
exceeds £5O but does not exceed £4OO (or £BOO in the case of husband
and wife living together), the provisions apply as shown in paragraphs
16 and 17.
16. Where the member only is eligible, the amount of service pension
payable is reduced by 9d. per fortnight for each complete £lO by
which the value of property exceeds £5O. Actually, no reduction is
made unless £6O is held, as there has to be a complete amount of £lO
over and above the exemption of £5O before the first 9d. can be
deducted.


17. Where both husband and wife are eligible for service pension,
the amount of pension payable to each is reduced by 9d. per fortnight
for each complete £lO by which the value of the property of each
exceeds £25. Here again, actually no reduction is made unless the
property of each is £35. ~
Other Income and Property in Conjunction may
Disqualify.
18. It has been shown that possession of other income to the value
of 635. p.f. or more, or the possession of property of a value of £4OO
or more, will render a person ineligible. It will also be realized that,
even if these items be less than the amounts stated, the cumulative effect
of such lesser amounts may render a person ineligible. For example,
if the other income be 425,, and the value of property be £330, the
applicant would be ineligible, as is explained in the following. A
person with other income of 425. p.f. would, if he possessed no property,
or property of a value not exceeding £5O, be eligible for a service pension
of 21s. p.f., thus bringing his income to the allowed income of 635.
But if, in addition to the other income of 425. p.f., he possessed property
valued £330, then after reducing the value of the property to £2BO by
allowing the exemption of £5O, a deduction of 215., representing 9d.
for each of the 28 units of £lO, would have to be made, with the result
that no pension would be payable.
ASSESSMENT OF SERVICE PENSION.
19. In dealing with assessment of service pension, the following
terms are used necessarily for convenience of expression, and to
facilitate the setting out of examples:—
Allowed Income; Meaning the total amount of income
(inclusive of service pension, and inclusive of the value of 9d.
for each £lO unit of property) allowed by the law. The amount
of such allowed income is, in every individual case, 635. per
fortnight.
Other Income: Meaning income other than service pension, as
explained in paragraph 9.
Maximum Bates where Other Income or Property does
NOT AFFECT PENSION.
20. Where an applicant has no property, or property of a value
insufficient to affect the pension rate, and the other income is not more
than 255. p.f. if single, or 31s. p.f. if married, then the maximum rate
of 38s. p.f. or 325. p.f. respectively may be paid.
Effect of Other Income, or Property, or Both.
21. In all other cases, the amount of service pension will be affected
as shown in the following examples, which are arranged according to
whether the payment of a rate lower than the maximum is due to other
income, to property, or to a combination of both income and property.


To simplify the examples, the position regarding children is not shown,
but it may he taken that any eligible child will almost invariably be
granted ss. per fortnight (or a total of 20s. per fortnight for four
children) .

22. To make it further clear to an applicant or pensioner under
which example his case would come, it is explained that examples (a),
(d) and (g), which are headed “Member only” (and the examples
similarly headed in the Appendices), apply to cases in Classes A, B and
G (see paragraphs 4to 7), where the member is unmarried, a widower,
divorced, or living apart from his wife and she is not eligible for service
pension.
23. Examples (b), (e) and (. h ), which are headed “Member and
wife, but wife not eligible” (and the examples similarly headed in the
Appendices) apply to cases in Classes A, B and 0 (see paragraphs 4 to
7) where the member and his wife are assessed as living together but
the wife is ineligible for service pension. The ineligibility of the wife
would apply in all cases in Class A, and would apply in cases in
Classes B and C where the wife was married after Ist October, 1931.
24. Examples (c), (/) and (j), which are headed “Member and
wife, both eligible” (and the examples similarly headed in the
Appendices), apply to oases in Classes B and C (see paragraphs 6
and 7) where the member is married; both he and his wife are
eligible for service pensions ; and they are assessed as living together.
Assessment where Member and Wife are both Eligible, but are
Living Apart.
25. In cases where a member and his wife are both eligible for
service pension, but they are assessed as living apart, the assessment in
the case of each would be on the lines shown in examples (a), ( d )
and (g), but the maximum rate for each would be 325. per fortnight.
Assessment of Widow's Pension.
26. Where the wife of a member is in receipt of service pension,
and the member dies, the pension which she was receiving at the time
of his death may be continued, subject to the conditions relating to


other income and property. In this regard, the assessment in her
case would be on the lines shown in examples ( a ), ( d ) and (<7), but
the maximum rate would be 325. per fontnight. The pensions of any
children may also be continued after the death of the member, but all
pensions—widows’ and children’s —cease if she remarries.
SERVICE PENSIONER IN ASYLUM, HOSPITAL OE OTHER
INSTITUTION.
27. Where a member in receipt of both service pension and war
pension is admitted, with the authority of the Repatriation Commis-
sion, to an institution for treatment in respect of a disability which is
due to war service, the service pensions of himself and any dependants
cease, and instead, they will receive the payments prescribed in respect
of war pension or medical sustenance.
28. Where a member, receiving service pension under Class C on
the grounds that he is suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, is
admitted to an institution for treatment of such condition, the service
pensions of himself and his family continue without alteration, unless,
of course, the income of himself or his wife alters, in which case
re-assessment would be necessary. In all other cases where a service
pensioner is an inmate of an institution, service pension is paid to that
pensioner at a rate not exceeding 12s. per fortnight, but any service
pensions payable to other members of the family may be continued
at the rates payable immediately prior to the admission of the patient
to the institution.
SERVICE PENSION APPLICATIONS.

tion form and Form 5.P.3, will then be furnished. Full instructions as

withstanding the fact that the disability has not been accepted as due
to war service. All necessary medical treatment will be made avail-
able per medium of the Repatriation Commission’s institutions exactly
as is provided for a member suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis due
to war service.
SERVICE PENSION IN LIEU OF INVALID OR OLD-AGE
PENSION.
32. Although members under Class A or Class B, or the wives
of members under Class B or Class 0, who are in receipt of invalid
or old-age pension cannot, on that account, receive service pension,
they may lodge applications for service pension if they prefer to
receive such pension in lieu of invalid or old-age pension. The
application will be investigated, and if the applicant qualifies in respect
of all other conditions, arrangements may be made for the surrender
of invalid or old-age pension, and for payment of service pension.
APPEALS.
33. Applications for service pension are determined, in the first
instance, by the Repatriation Board for the State in which the
applicant resides. An applicant has the right of appeal to the
Repatriation Commission against a decision of the Board, and the
decision of the Commission is final, except in the following cases. A
member under Class B or Class C whose application has been refused
by the Commission solely on the ground that he is not permanently
unemployable, or not suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, may,
within three months after the date of notification of the Commission’s
decision, lodge an appeal to an Assessment Appeal Tribunal against
the Commission’s decision. The necessary form of appeal may be
obtained on application to the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation.
PAYMENT OF SERVICE PENSIONS.
34. Pensions are payable fortnightly in advance on alternate
Thursdays, and may be paid at any post office nominated by the
pensioner.
35. On the grant of a pension the pensioner is supplied with a
pension certificate showing the rate of pension, date of commencement,
place of payment, and due date of each instalment of pension. This
certificate must be produced when each instalment is being collected.
Payment will not be made under any circumstances without the produce
tion of the pension certificate.


36. If a pensioner loses iiis certificate, or if the certificate is
destroyed, he may apply to the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation
for a duplicate.
37. Transfers from one place of payment to another may be
arranged through the postmaster.
38. The Deputy Commissioner should be advised promptly of any
change of address.
39. Each instalment of pension should be collected as it falls due.
Failure to effect reasonably regular collection will result in suspension,
and many entail cancellation, of the pension.
10. Should a pensioner be unable to collect an instalment of his
pension personally he may appoint an agent to collect on his behalf.
The form necessary for this purpose (Form “O ”) can be had on
application to the postmaster, and the person to whom such order to
collect is given will be required to certify that he is not receiving
the pension by way or in consequence of sale, assignment, charge,
execution or insolvency, or in payment of any debt whether due or
about to become due from the pensioner.
41. Where the pensioner’s inability to collect is of a permanent
nature, he may arrange through the Deputy Commissioner for the
appointment of a trustee. If a pensioner desires payment to be made
to a trustee, he should apply to the Deputy Commissioner and furnish
full information as to the name and address of the proposed trustee,
and the reason for such method of payment.
42. The Deputy Commissioner may appoint a trustee for the
pensioner in any case in which he considers it desirable to do so, or he
may assume the trusteeship himself.
43. The Act provides that a pension is absolutely inalienable
whether by way or in consequence of sale, assignment, charge, execu-
tion, insolvency or otherwise howsoever. It cannot be levied upon for
payment of a debt, nor can it be pledged as a security for a loan.
Action in contravention of this provision is an offence, and renders
the pensioner and all others participating in the offence liable to
prosecution.
REVIEWS OF SERVICE PENSION.
44. The rate of a service pension is assessed at the time of grant
on the lines indicated in paragraphs 19 to 26, and is reviewed from
time to time on similar lines according to the circumstances of the
pensioner. In connexion with such reviews, the pensioner is required
to furnish a statement as to his income and property. Irrespective of
such reviews, however, pensioners are required to report to the Depart-
ment the acquisition of property or income as explained in
paragraph 45.


MARRIAGE OR RE MARRIAGE, RECEIPT OF INCOME OR
PROPERTY, ETC., TO BE NOTIFIED.
45. Any pensioner who acquires property or income to an amount
which affects the rate of his pension, or which, with other property
owned or income received, is sufficient to affect the rate of his pension,
is required to notify the Deputy Commissioner of Repatriation for his
State within thirty days of the acquisition thereof. The following
are examples of cases which should be notified to the Deputy
Commissioner: —
(a) Acquisition of property, including money, by way of gift
or by legacy or from any other sources.
(h) Receipt of money from sale of houses or land or under a
policy of insurance or from a prize in a lottery or from
any other sources.
(c) Vacation by pensioner of a home owned by him.
( d ) Increase in banking account.
( e ) Increase in earnings or other income.
46. Any service pensioner who sells or vacates a home owned by
him and in which he has been residing is required to forward a notice
of the fact immediately.
47. Also, any service pensioner who marries or re-marries is
required to forward a notice in writing of the fact immediately.
48. It is in the interests of pensioners to comply with these require-
ments, as any pension which is wrongfully collected as a result of
failure to notify the facts is recoverable, and the pensioner is liable
to a fine not exceeding £lO or imprisonment for a period not exceeding
one month, and, in addition, service pension may be withheld for a
period not exceeding two years.
POWER TO SUMMON WITNESSES.
49. The Chairman of the Commission or of a Repatriation Board
may summon any person as a witness to furnish evidence on oath and
to produce documents.
50. If any person has been summoned as a witness and without
lawful excuse, and after tender of reasonable expenses, he fails to
appear in obedience to the summons, he is liable to a penalty of £2O.
51. If any person appears as a witness and, without lawful excuse,
refuses either to be sworn or to make an affirmation, or to produce
documents, or to answer questions, he is liable to a fine of £5O.
OFFENCES.
52. Where, in consequence of any false statement, any person has
received a pension to which he is not entitled or in excess of the amount
to which he is entitled, the over-payment may be recovered in any
court of competent jurisdiction from the pensioner as a debt due to
the Commonwealth,


53. Any person who, in his claim for pension, or in the declaration
endorsed on the claim, wilfully makes any statement which is untrue
in any particular, is guilty of an offence.
Penalty: £lOO or imprisonment for one year.
54. Any person who, on being required to furnish a confidential
report as to the circumstances or the financial transactions of any
claimant or pensioner, fails to do so, or furnishes a report which is
untrue in any particular, is guilty of an offence.
Penalty: £lOO or six months’ imprisonment.
55. (1.) Any person who—
(a) makes, either orally or in writing, a false or misleading
statement in, or in connexion with, or in support of, any
application for pension;
(b) obtains any pension or instalment of pension which is not
payable;
(c) obtains payment of any pension or instalment of pension
by means of any false or misleading statement; or
( d ) makes or presents to the Minister or the Commission or
to any officer doing duty in relation to the Act or the
Regulations, any statement or document which is false
in any particular,
is guilty of an offence.
Penalty: £5O or imprisonment for six months.
(2.) Any person convicted of an offence against this provision may,
in addition to the penalty imposed for the offence, he ordered to repay
to the Commission any amount received by him by way of pension in
consequence of the act in respect of which he was convicted.
GENERAL.
56. If a service pensioner or an applicant for a service pension has
directly or indirectly deprived himself of property or income in order
to qualify for or obtain a pension or in order to obtain a pension at
a higher rate than that for which he would have been otherwise
eligible, the value of the property or the amount of the income of which
the applicant has deprived himself shall be deemed to be the property
or the income of the applicant, and shall be taken into account in the
assessment of service pension, if such is payable.
57. Should any additional information concerning eligibility,
pension, &c., be required by an applicant or a pensioner, he is advised
to apply, either personally or in writing, to the Deputy Commissioner
of Repatriation for the State in which the inquirer resides.
