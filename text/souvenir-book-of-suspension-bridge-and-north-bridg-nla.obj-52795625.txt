History and Development of the District.
WHEN I first came to Northbridge,” said
the Old-Timer, “there was no house
where this street is. See all those
houses—that was where we picked wild flowers
and came for picnicking. It was not known as
Northbridge then, it was only part of Willoughby.
All this part of the country was famous for wild
flowers. One or two people came and settled down
in what is now Harden Avenue, That was the
first beginning of Northbridge. There was no
bridge in those days, nor gas nor water, either.
Later on we got a street light, but only an oil
lamp."
Northbridge has made tremendous strides, and
is destined to make still more remarkable progress
in the future. It stands in the pathway of the
coming onrush. It is inevitable that every foot
of land will, in the near future, be sought for, but
it is also true that nature has so placed her gifts
of scenic beauty, that it will be hard to spoil
them. The wooded slopes, the rocky gorges, the
gracious curves of the bays and the leafy promon-
tones, are prominent features in this favoured spot.
In the early years of over a hundred years ago,
much of the land which is now Northbridge was
contained in a grant made to William Bligh, said
to have been a relative to the Captain William
Bligh, who was for a brief time—lBo6-1808—Gov-
ernor of New South Wales.
Captain Blighfc> was a Royal Navy man, and
was commander of the "Bounty," when the crew
of that ship mutinied. It is said that his des-
potic and overbearing character was the cause of
the discontent among the men, and such a disposi-
tion ill-fitted him for the post of Governor and
practically absolute ruler of New South Wales in
the early days. In his treatment of Mr. Mac-
arthur, who was engaged in developing the wool
industry of the colony, he displayed his intolerant
and masterful nature and showed his antagonism
to what was proving so beneficial to the progress
of the young settlement. His occupancy of the
position of Governor was short and ended in a dis-
continued on Page 10.)


astrous manner. On 26th January, 1808, the 20th
anniversary of the foundation of the Colony, the
102nd Regiment, headed by Col. Johnston, pro-
ceeded to Government House, arrested Bligh and
deposed him. Johnston was subsequently court-
martialled and cashiered, but the Home Govern-
ment recalled and thus put an end to his
unfortunate reign.
Governor Capt. Bligh appears to have had in-
timate personal relations with this locality, which
is now Northbridge, for until a few years ago, the
remains of a country cottage, which is said to have
been built and used by him, existed at the top of
the rise above the little jetty.
For some seventy years after Bligh’s time, little
happened to disturb the natural features of the
land adjoining Sailor’s Bay, Long Bay, and Middle
Harbour. Willoughby had grown into a Muni-
cipality in 1865 with a population of over 400, as
is set out in a petition published in the Govern-
ment Gazette, of May 30, 1865. The petitioners
stated that the number of inhabitants of the Rural
District, hereinafter defined, amounts to four
hundred, and that it is desirable that the district
shall be declared a Municipality by the name of
“North Willoughby,” the boundaries of which are
as follows: —"Commencing in Long Bay, Middle
Harbour, Parish of Willoughby, County of Cum-
berland, at the justion of a fresh water creek at
the eastern point of James Yates’ 5J acres, and
James William Bligh’s 31 acres, and bounded on
the south-west corner of Archibald Mossman’s 34
acres, thence by a line bearing south-west to the
source of a creek dividing Wright’s 29 acres and
Wollstonecraft’s 525 acres, thence by that creek to
a bay, and by the bay and the waters of Port
Jackson, running westerly, and by Lane Cove
Creek to the head of Blue Gum Creek, and thence
by the dividing boundary line of the parishes of
Willoughby and Gordon to Middle Harbour; thence
by the waters of Middle Harbour to the point of
commencement.”
It is interesting to note that Willoughby’s incor-
poration was the first of Northern Suburbs incor-
porations, St, Leonard's being in July, 1869; Vic-
toria’s in September, 1871; while East St. Leon-
ard’s first met in February, 1868.
It was not until the Ist January, 1890, that the
railway from Hornsby to St, Leonard’s, a dis-
continued on Pago 20.)

tance of 10 miles, 29i chains, was opened for traffic,
and the line was left “to end in the bush.” A long
agitation to continue the line to the Harbour had
been successful some two years earlier, for it is
recorded that on the 10th August, 1887, a daughter
of Sir Henry Parkes, with a silver spade that cost
the Willoughby Municipality over £lOO, turned the
first sod for the construction of this section. It
is further related in “Willoughby’s Fifty Years,”
by Claude Leplastrier, that Miss Parkes was pre-
sented with a wheelbarrow made of polished
walnut, the wood being taken from the s.s.
“Austral,” when she was raised from the bottom of
the harbour. The wheelbarrow Miss Parkes used
in the ceremony. The Sydney “Morning Herald”
reporting on the event, mentions that 7d. was
charged for the tram journey from Milson’s Point
to the then terminus at Ridge Street!
There was still a gap left from St. Leonard’s to
Milson’s Point, which the residents of those days
were left to negotiate in the way that seemed to
them best. The roads of approach from Gore
Hill were said to be attrocious, and many adven-
tures are narrated by the early pioneers. It is
related that on one occasion, on a dark night, an
alderman of the Council in going to attend a meet-
ing, lost his shoe in the mud, and thought it was
eventually recovered, he declined to proceed to
the meeting after the adventure.
The final section of a little over two miles was
commenced the next year, and took three years to
complete. On the Ist May, 1890, trains ran into
the Milson’s Point old station, and the real de-
velopment of the North Shore district began.
Quoting from Mr. Leplaistere's book referred to
above, and commenting on the difficulties of push-
ing through this railway communication he says:
“The public at once crowded to take advantage of
the opportunities thus made available to them.
The bulk of the people who have since made their
home along, this line have no personal knowledge
of the keen struggles here referred to, but it must
not be overlooked that many far-sighted and pa-
triotic men gave time and energy to the move-
ment.”
Being part of the Willoughby Municipality, the
welfare of Northbridge is to a certain degree in-
fluenced by these progressive steps, but the tram-
ways have been more closely connected with the

SUSPENSION BRIDGE.
Sydney is so situated geographically that
bridges are a necessity to its development, and the
recent progress towards constructing the big'
Harbour Bridge has filled the Sydney mind with
bridge pride, but for twenty-five years a bridge,
unrivalled in beauty and size of its kind has stood'
almost unregarded as one of the show places of
the district. This noble structure, whose mas-
sive stone towers at either end rise to a. height
above the bed of the bay of 267 feet, stretches like
a thread from bank to bank. Looked at from the
bay it fits the picture without one marring glimpse,
and by its grace adds to the beauty which Nature,
has bestowed around with a lavish hand.
At a cost of £lOO,OOO this most beautiful bridge
was construced in 1891 by a private company to
develop what is now. Northbridge. The cables
which support the bridge are anchored in tunnels
over 100 feet deep, and support a strain of over
2,000 tons of steel. Further references to this
bridge are found in our notes on Northbridge.
THE NORTHBRIDGE BATHS.
The Northbridge Baths were officially opened
by the Mayor of Willoughby (Aid. H. W, Clarke)
on November 8, 1924.
Situated among beautiful surroundings and in
protected waters of Sailor’s Bay, they are largely
frequented and are a great asset to the town’s use-
fulness and pleasure. The baths are furnished
with covered-in dressing sheds and spring diving
board. The total cost of construction was £2,000.
The lessee of the baths is Mr. Williams, a fully
qualified life-saver. Charges are: Adults 3d., chil-
dren 14 to 16 years 2d., under 14 years Id.
A view of the baths is shown on page 2.


wonderful development of Suspension Bridge and
Northbridge. The extension of the tramline to
Suspension Bridge was opened on 17th May, 1909,
and for some years this was the terminus.
The story of the progress of Northbridge is
bound up with the building of the Suspension
Bridge. As long ago as ISB7 the Willoughby
Council decided “that a letter be written to the
Mayor of St. Leonards asking that Council to meet
the Council of North Willoughby at a conference
at the foot of Miller Street to consider certain sug-
gestions with reference to a bridge over Long Bay.
This suggestion was apparently the first step of
what was afterwards known as the North Sydney
Tramway and Investment Company—a company
which was to run a tram line over the bridge and
so open up the land across for residental pur-
poses. For some years after the construction
of the bridge, tram rails and materials were stacked
at its approach, awaiting commencement of the
work, but the delay in extending the Ridge-street
portion—or some other cause—prevented the
work being carried out, a work vital to the success
of the company.
The history of the far-seeing scheme, which in-
volved the building of the beautiful bridge across
Long Bay, and the development of the land be-
yond into a delighful suburb, is one mixed with
many bitter disappointments for those early
courageous speculators. The original company,
in whose welfare Lord Carrington was said to be
interested, was not a financial success. The bridge
was built, but land sales languished. There was
a distance of a mile to walk to the nearest tram.
The shareholders lost their money. A threepenny
toll was charged for some years for people to walk
over the bridge, where they were accustomed to
picnic and gather wild flowers, but no progress in
development was made.
At length a new private company was formed,
and the Minister for Works of that time ap-
proached with an offer to hand over the Bridge to
the Government, and this was agreed to, and
formalities completed in November, 1912. The
trams ran over the bridge in February, 1914, but
not up the hill until later. The early settlers had
to walk and were also without gas and electric
light.
The war breaking out in 1914 kept things from

going ahead. The first shops, near where the
tram stops at the top of the hill—Strathallen
Avenue —were completed in December, 1919. A
severe test was made of the bridge before traffic
was allowed over. The new company built a
small number of cottages and sold them very
reasonably on terms.
The ceremony of handing over the bridge to the
Government took place on Saturday afternoon,
16th November, 1912, and the deed was handed
over to the Hon. J. S. T, McGowen, Premier, by
the Hon, Sir Allen Taylor, on behalf of the Com-
pany, Mr. Laplastrier in his “Willoughby’s Fifty
Years,’’ says: “This ceremony constitutes a very ■
important epoch in the Municipality’s progress.
Sir Allen Taylor, in handing the assignment deed
over on behalf of the company, promised that 150
acres would be reserved as a National Park for.
North Sydney, and people would then be able to
take a round trip by tram and boat.
“Mr. McGowan in accepting the assignment, said
the Government had no doubt about the wisdom,
of accepting a gift of this kind, an unconditional
gift, except in regard to toll, and it was not likely
they would think of imposing any toll.

TRAMS AND BUSES.
• There is a 20. minutes service of trams between
the terminus at Northbridge and Milson’s Point,
and from Suspension Bridge, practically a 10
minutes service. There are few parts of the
Sydney suburbs where such a liberal service can
be found.
In addition, ’buses via Willoughby pass Strath-
alien Avenue, and a service from the tram
terminus, end has been instituted.
The tram sections from MilS'oh’s Point are three
—Ridge-street, Suspension Bridge, and terminus.
The ’buses have enlarged the middle section to
Strathallen Avenue, and it is hoped the trams will
shortly do the same.
