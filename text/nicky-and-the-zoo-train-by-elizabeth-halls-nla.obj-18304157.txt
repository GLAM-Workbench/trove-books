NICKY
A INI ID
T Ini IE
ZOO TRAIN
/ :
By ELIZABETH HALLS


NE Saturday morning a little boy came
out of the greengrocer’s shop and
walked quickly up the street. His
name was Nicky and he had been sent by his
grandfather to buy a lettuce, some carrots, a
pound of apples, some grapes and potatoes. As
he walked along in his blue overalls with the
vegetables in a string bag, something bright and
shining rolled in front of him with a tinkling
sound and then lay still.


* 5 APR m*
"-v


ICKY stopped suddenly—the thing
was round and bright, but it wasn’t
a button —it wasn’t a marble —it
wasn’t just a piece of tin —
IT WAS A BRIGHT NEW SIXPENCE !
Dropping the vegetables all over the footpath
Nicky bent down quickly and picked it up, and
when he had picked it up he could see that it
wasn’t an ordinary sixpence, because right in the
middle was a tiny little hole. Then he ran home
as fast as he could with lettuce under one arm,
the bag full of vegetables in one hand, and the
sixpence held tightly in the other.


W*^


HEN he got to the house he ran to
his grandfather who was reading
the paper, and quite out of breath
he said, “Grandpa look what I’ve found.” His
grandfather took the sixpence and turned it over
in his hand, and then he said, “Nicky this six-
pence has a hole in it, and that means that it is
a lucky sixpence, so you must think carefully
before you spend it.”
Nicky thought very hard for a few minutes
and then he said, “Perhaps I will buy some choco-
late or ice cream, or perhaps I will put it in my
money box.” But then he had a fine idea. “I
know, Grandpa,” he said, “I’ll go to the Zoo.”


M XXf.t'


ICKY lived near the Zoo, so after
lunch he went to the Zoo gates and
bought a ticket at the little office, and
it was then that strange things began to happen
because he was given a big bag of buns with his
ticket.
There were no people in the Zoo, so Nicky
was quite pleased to talk to a parrot which was
in a cage on the ground. “I don’t like buns,”
said the parrot. “I don’t like bears either, or
bananas, blackberries, balloons or books.”
So Nicky turned to another parrot who was
sitting on a noticeboard and said, 4 ‘Would you
like a bun Polly, and can you tell me the way to
the bears?”
Polly took the bun and began to eat it and
while he was pulling pieces off with his hooked
beak, he said, “If you can’t read I’ll tell you what
this noticeboard says. It says TO THE
BEARS.’ ”




A
xl
FTER Nicky had thanked the parrot he
walked a little way, and turned a sharp
corner, and found himself right in front
of the bears’ cage, and just at that moment an
enormous bear stepped right out on to the foot-
path.
“Good afternoon,” said the bear, “buns, I
suppose; they always bring buns.”
Nicky was too surprised to speak for a
moment, then he said, “I’m sorry it’s only buns,
but they gave them to me at the office.”
“They always do,” said Mr. Bear, “However,
I may as well have one,” and held out a paw for
one of Nicky’s buns. It’s a funny thing,” said
Mr. Bear, but whoever comes here with a lucky
sixpence always has buns; you would think they
would give us a change sometimes, wouldn’t
you?”
Nicky’s mouth was full of bun, so he on y
nodded.
Mr. Bear went on, “Eat that up and you and
I will go for a walk down to the station—it’s
nearly time for the Animals’ Train.”


y


O Mr. Bear and Nicky strolled along past
the cages, saying “How do you do?” to
all the animals around them; “This is
Nicky” added Mr. Bear
“buns again!”
They saw Mrs. Hippopotamus and her baby
in the distance, and on a seat Miss Seal was
basking in the sun.
On and on they went until they came to the
little station where the Zoo train stood.

y round the Zoo. Everyone held on tight because they went so
rough a tunnel, and Nicky blew the whistle again, “Toot Toot.”


HEN the train had gone round the
Zoo twenty times and the animals
were feeling a little giddy, Nicky
put on the brake with a jerk.
“This is where you have your name and
address taken,” said Mr. Bear, getting out of
the carriage. “Here is the Secretary Bird,” and
a tall unhappy looking bird, with a bald head
and a book under his wing came up to them.
“What’s your name?” he said, “I take the
name of all lucky sixpence holders.”
“Nicholas Aurelius Willoughby Button,” said
Nicky in his best voice, but the Secretary Bird
didn’t seem to hear him, for he suddenly said very
loudly, “Time for Tea!”


<,. > **v


R. BEAR said, “We will go and see
my friend Teddy, he always has tea
ready for special visitors,” and he
took Nicky across to see Teddy the chimpanzee,
who was very pleased to see them.
“Do you take milk in your tea, Nicky?” he
asked.
“Yes, and sugar too, please,” said Nicky.
Mr. Bear had a big jar of honey which Teddy
always kept for him.
While they were enjoying their tea, two
naughty monkeys crept in and took pieces out off
the cake, but no one saw them.
The monkeys who lived in the cage next door
were making a terrible noise.
“Can I go and see what they are doing?” said
Nicky.
“Yes, I’ll call for you later,” said Mr. Bear.




ICKY found all the other monkeys
were chasing the two little monkeys
and were trying to take away their
pieces of cake, but when they saw Nicky two
spider monkeys came and asked him if he would
like a swing.
The Spider Monkeys, whose names were
Abdul and Molly, pushed the swing higher and
higher till Nicky’s legs almost touched the roof.
All the other monkeys stopped chasing each
other and watched Nicky swinging.




HEN Nicky heard a strange swishing
noise and when the swing went up high,
he could see a lot of animals in the dis-
tance being given a shower bath by Mrs.
Elephant.
The monkeys heard it, too, and they stopped
the swing, and Nicky and the monkeys and Mr.
Bear and Teddy all ran to join in the fun. Nicky
and Mr. Bear got there first and splashed about
in the water, which was lovely and cool. The
pelican and the kangaroo were washing them-
selves clean too.
Suddenly, Nicky got too close to Mrs.
Elephant, and a great stream of water knocked
him right over. His eyes were full of water and
when he had them clear again, he looked around
and found that all the animals had gone —only
Mrs. Elephant stood there, moving gently from
one foot to the other and smiling down her trunk.

ICKY picked himself up and ran to
find Mr. Bear, who was back in his
cage, and Nicky knew it was time
for him to go home to his grandfather.
“Goodbye, Mr. Bear/’ he said.
But Mr. Bear, who was standing up on his
hind legs didn’t answer, but just waved his paws
through the bars of the cage.
Nicky ran all the way home and rushed into
his grandfather to tell him all about his adven-
tures.
“Fancy that now,” said his Grandfather,
“You never know what will happen when you
find a lucky sixpence, do you?”
And Nicky sat down to a big tea of brown
bread and butter and strawberry jam, and after-
wards when the dining-room clock chimed —


j


EVEN O’ CLOCK
And Nicky’s in bed,
The noise of the train,
Still sounds in his head.
Round and round,
Go the wheels of the train,
Nicky is driving the engine again.
With the squirrels and monkeys,
And kangaroos, too,
Nicky is dreaming he’s back at the Zoo.
