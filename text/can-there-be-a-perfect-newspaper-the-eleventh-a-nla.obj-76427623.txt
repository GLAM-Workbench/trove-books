The Eleventh Arthur Norman Smith
Memorial Lecture in Journalism
Delivered by Mr S. G. W. HORNIBLOW, at the Commerce Theatre, University of
Melbourne, on Monday, August 11, 1947.
Mr S. G. W. Horniblow is a well-known English journalist who was editor of the London Daily Mail for nearly three years, and
had previously been assistant editor of the Mail and night editor of the Daily Express. He arrived in Australia in March to take over the
editorship of The Argus, a post which he occupied for about five months.
? ?
Mr Horniblow has been a journalist since the age of 16, working in England, China, Ceylon, and now Australia. He has been
everything in a newspaper-reporter, sub-editor, war correspondent, news editor, features editor and editor. He has the distinction of being
a Fellow of the Institute of Journalists.
In the past few years Mr Horniblow has been in close touch with some of the leading British newspaper proprietors?Rother-
mere, Beaverbrook, Kemsley and others-and has become thoroughly acquainted w'ith the principles on which they operate their vast
newspaper businesses. His subject is one of vital interest to journalists and their readers.

facts nor would they slant the news to suit
the political prejudices of the Editor or his
proprietors. They would not dress up opinions
and disguise them as news, so playing a kind
of confidence trick on innocent readers.
This does not mean that a newspaper is not
entitled to opinions on politics, or on any
other subject that happens to command intel-
ligent interest. It does mean that the depart-
ment of opinions and the department of news
should be kept in separate and strictly water-
tight compartments. Opinions should be kept
to the editorial columns and the editorial pages,
where everybody would recognise them for what
they were, and could judge them accordingly.
They could be expressed as vigorously and
forcefully as possible, always providing they
were expressed with honesty and sincerity.
The man behind the pen should believe in
what he is writing, for the man who writes
with his tongue in his cheek for the sake of his
weekly or monthly salary cheque cannot com-
plain if he is accused of being a simple mer-
cenary.
Most of you. I imagine, will agree with what
I have said so far. You may even think it
sounds easy, and you may wonder why the
perfect newspaper is not more common than
it is.
At this point, I think it is worth while look-
ing around us and asking another question:
Is there a perfect newspaper being produced
anywhere In the world today?
In the totalitarian countries, I am quite cer-
tain that there is not. In the democratic lands
of the British Empire, United States and
Western Europe, I think we come closertto it,
though we rasv still fa!! far sljort of perfection.
For we of the democratic West have one
boon?one weapon?which is denied to the
Totalitarian journalist, whether of the Left
or the Right. We have complete freedom of
expression within the bounds of decency and
libel and we have a high measure of inde-
pendence.
The totalitarian newspaper has neither. In
fact, it performs an entirely different function
from the democratic newspaper. The Totali-
tarian Press is purely and simply an Instru-
ment of government, and is regarded as such,
It is run on an entirely different set of prin-
ciples.
It starts on the basis that the Common Man
is not to be trusted with all the Truth; that
he is an ignorant fellow unaccustomed to use
his political intelligence. It assumes that his
political masters know best how much of the
truth he can assimilate without drawing wrong
and dangerous conclusions.
In this, I think the best Communists and
even the best Fascists are quite sincere. They
honestly believe that the Common Man has
a long way to go In education and mature
political judgment before he can be trusted
with newspapers which tell him all the truth,
not only about his own country but about the
rest of the world.
It is a point of view, and in many oases I
think it is an honestly held point of view,
though I completely disagree with It.
Unfortunately, human nature being what
experience has shown that Totalitarian
may begin with the best of inten-
very soon they succumb to tempta-
~e their own principles.
?-ely negative basis of withhold-
?d dangerous, they move on
'papers as instruments of
?laganda to deceive their
Prom month to month and from year to year
they set out deliberately to condition the
masses in their attitude to almost everything,
and in particular in their attitude to the
peoples and governments of other lands. This
Is done by providing a constant diet of news
which is always distorted and often deliber-
ately false.
So you will not find the perfect newspaper
under a totalitarian regime.
Now let us look at our own, democratic news-
papers. If I take my examples from Britain
rather than Australia, I hope you will forgive
me. Ido so because 1 know a great deal about
the British Press and comparatively little as
yet about the Australian Press. You are, of
course, at liberty to draw any parallels you may
see for yourselves.
In the Anglo-Saxon democracies newspapers
are of infinite shades and infinite varieties.
But, very broadly, they fall into three main
classes.
There is, first of all, the highly respectable
serious-minded newspaper which in its own
way does a magnificent job. Examples are
?The Times? and ?The Manchester Guardian.?
Such newspapers cater primarily for .the edu-
cated and professional classes, the business
man and the serious politician.
They wield great power and influence in
the world and they wield it with a high sense
of responsibility. But I fear that from the
point of view of the masses, who are equally
entitled to know exactly what Is being said
and done around them, and for them, they are
a total loss.
Into the next class there falls the resnectable
popular newspaper with the mass circulation.
Again, we cannot call this the perfect news-
paper, though in fact it does an extremely
valuable job. It aims at two things; one, to
give its readers as much of the serious news
as it thinks he can easily digest; and two, to
provide him with twenty minutes relaxation in
the train or tram on his way to the office,
or after his day?s work is done.
Sometimes our popular newspaper fails into
the error of concentrating too much on relaxa-
tion and too little on real news. It then be-
comes rather like a very gassy glass of beer,
with an enormous, creamy head which looks
appetising enough, but with very little alco-
holic content underneath.
Yet the popular newspaper, when skilfully
run, is not to be despised. It performs at its
best an educative function. It helps the people
to an easier understanding of world affairs,
and, incidentally, it calls for great technical
skill and a fine delicacy of judgment on the
part of the Editors and journalists who produce
it.
The third class is what we know as the
frankly ?yellow? newspaper. I do not wish to
say very much about it. We know that it
gets its sales by pandering quite openly to our
less amiable instincts. It provides an un-
alloyed diet of sex, crime, horror and sport,
and it finds vast numbers of readers.
You may, quite rightly, condemn the yellow
newspaper. But I think we should also ask
ourselves how far our educational system is at
fault, when it makes this type of newspaper
not only possible but profitable.
What, then is our mythical historian of one
thousand years hence going to get from the
democratic newspapers of today?
Should individual files of one newspaper
from each of these three classes survive
through the centuries, he would, by intelligent
comparison and selection, get a moderately
fair picture of us. �
On the other hand, it he had before him
only the flies of one of our serious newspapers
he would flatter not only our intelligence, our
artistic culture, and our education, but our
qualities of honesty and morality as well. For
there would be nothing in their rather austere
pages to tell him that we ever committed
crimes or that we ever became involved in
say, scandalous divorce cases.
If, again, the files of a popular newspaper
were the sole survivors, he might too easily
under-estimate our intelligence and the stan-
dards of cultural development to which we
have in fact attained.
And if the flies of a yellow newspaper alone
survived, I shudder to think what' he would
make of us.
By now you will have guessed that my own
perfect newspaper would be a skilful blend
of the first two classes.
It would give you all the news of social
importance and a great deal of news into the
bargain which, whiie of no intrinsic Importance
in itself, would nevertheless throw light on the
many currents and undercurrents which shape
the general course of our Society.
It would certainly not ignore crime?not even
sex crime?for crime and the detection and
prevention of crime are a,ll part of our soda;'
background.
Indeed, I would go further, and say that
every time you condemn an honest newspaper
for recording crime, you inhibit it in its plain
duty' to the community and you damage the
community itself.
I say this because I believe that only by
arousing the community to an awareness of
its own defects can you bestir it into doing
something to remedy those defects.
The Press, powerful an instrument though it
is in itself, is never so powerful or so useful
as when it has an awakened public opinion
behind it.
In this business of recording crime and the
seamier sides of life in general, there is, of
course, a heavy responsibility on the Editors
and journalists concerned.
,In the perfect newspaper, the journalist
would never succumb to the tremendous
temptation to exploit 'the more spectacular as-
pects of crime purely for its commercial or
circulation value.
Crime would be recorded only in the light
of Its importance against the social background.
Corruption and graft in high places would,
absolutely rightly, receive great space and
headline display. Similarly, where . a lunatic
murderer is at large endangering tlie lives of
women and children, the perfect newspaper
would make it its duty to see that the fact was
given full publicity.
What it would not do would be to go into
salacious, lip-smacking details of the crimes
such a murderer has already committed.
This, as I have said, would call for the
highest degree of responsibility and judgment
on the part of the journalists concerned.
Now I have used the phrase ?a complete
record.?
Let us suppose, again, that our old friend
the historian of 2047 were to delve freely, into
all classes of our modern newspapers: would
he, from them all, fit together the complete
picture of our social structure?
I do not think he would.
There are certain deep undercurrents in our
social life of which he would learn little or
nothing from the modern newspaper. Certain
things would puzzle him greatly.
For example, from our statistics of divorce
he would easily deduce that our system of


, Speech of MR S. G. W. HORN!BLOW.

marriage was not functioning too well. Prom
our population statistics he would see at once
that our birth-rate at this particular stage in
history was falling dangerously.
Nothing in his newspapers would explain
either of these phenomena.
Both in Britain and Australia it is unlawful
to print the evidence in divorce cases; there-
fore our historian would lose just that informa-
tion which might give him a clue to the deep,
underlying human currents shaping our lives.
Cur perfect newspaper would reverse the
present system. It would publish divorce court
evidence because it could be trusted to do so
with a sense of responsibility and restraint.
On the other hand, it would probably sup-
press names and addresses of those involved
(which the law today permits) on the ground
of their irrelevance to the social scene. Excep-
tions would, of course, be made where private
scandals affected the public life.
Similarly, the perfect newspaper would dis-
cuss frankly and openly certain subjects now
almost completely taboo?for example, birth-
control.
Here is an element which enters deep into
our community life. It is responsible for vast
and far-reaching changes in our ways of liv-
ing, and in our moral standards. It is affect-
ing the very future of the race itself. Yet we
hear very little about It.
Again, I say, the perfect, newspaper would
bring this problem, and others like it into the
open: it would provide a platform for its
analysis and discussion by men of 'wisdom
knowledge and repute, and it would help to
find out how far it might be controlled or
checked for the public good.
Ail these things, I repeat, would be contained
in the perfect newspaper.
So far I have been dealing with what may
broadly be described as the technicalities of
my profession. I am now about to enter on
more dangerous and delicate territory
dangerous, and delicate, at least, for a working
newspaperman.
I will introduce it by posing still another
subsidiary question: Is the perfect newspaper
possible under our present system of owner-
ship?
Now it would be idle to deny that the Press
today is not held in the same esteem that it
was even twenty years ago. It has not the
same hold on the public confidence and in
many quarters, mostly political, it has been
brought frankly under suspicion.
The Press, in fact, has come under power-
ful attack in recent years, both in Britain and
the United States. There has been a long and
sustained campaign of criticism, some of it
informed, but very much of it ill-informed.
Often this criticism has degenerated into the
sheerest abuse.
The main target of this attack has been the
ownership of the Press, though the working
journalist has come in for his fair share of
the unpleasantness involved.
Newspaper owners in general have been held
up to the public as wicked capitalists who are
deliberately polluting the minds, of the masses,
through their newspapers, in order to protect
their own private and political interests.
The unhappy journalist has been pictured
as a downtrodden hireling, writing to his
master?s orders, more often than not against
his own real convictions.
In fact, if this picture is accepted, the owner
is a villain and the journalist a worm.
Is it a true picture?
I speak from a very long experience of jour-
nalism and close persona! knowledge of some
of Britain's biggest newspaper owners, and I
say quite flatly that it is untrue, unjust, and
viciously exaggerated.
First, I think, we should examine the system
of ownership Itself. I do not suggest that it is
by any means a perfect system or that it is
not open to abuse, I do say very earnestly
however, that we should consider long and
seriously before we attempt to destroy it com-
pletely in favour of any of the alternatives now
being so vigorously touted in political quarters
in Britain.
How are our newspapers controlled?
There is, first of all. the individual owner of
a single newspaper, or group of newspapers,
functioning in one centre. He is frequently
abused, but generally speaking is not regarded
automatically as a menace to society.
Then there is the limited liability company,
subscribed to by the public, with the shares
widely held and controlled by no single indi-
vidual, which also usually operates in one
centre.
This type of ownership again is not usually
regarded as a serious menace to society unless
it happens to come under th 6 domination of
one strong character, who might be its Editor,
its Managing-Director or its Chairman, and
who uses the newspaper to propagate a
violently anti-social policy.
This does sometimes happen, but not often,
and generally it brings its own penalty. For
I have found that the public quickly wearies
of a newspaper that rams set views down its
throat instead of trying to convince it with
intelligent and dispassionate argument.
The third type of ownership is the one most
generally criticised. This is the individual
owner who, eitluw by direct ownership or
through personal control of a series of com-
panies, gains control of a group of newspapers
in various parts of a country. Here is the
real Wicked Uncle of the critics.
In Britain I have worked for several such
owners and I know them well. They wield
great power, taut I am going to say this very
deliberately: from my personal knowledge ol
them, most of them have also a very high
sense of responsibility, and they do attempt to
use their, newspapers for the public good as
they see it.
From the working journalist?s point of view
they are generally the best type of proprietor
to work for. Lord Northcliffe. founder of the
?Daily Mail,? was a case in point.
Lord Northcliffe was above all things a
journalist. He loved his newspapers as news-
papers, not as mere profit-making machines,
and he did more than any individual In the
history of the British Press to improve the
pay, status, and conditions of the working
journalist.
Lord Northcliffe was a man of his age, and
he suffered the defects of his age. His in-
fluence, admittedly, was not always good. But
on the. whole, I would say that he did far
more good than harm. And in any case he
was inevitable in that period of our history.
His successor and nephew, the present Lord
Rothermere, though a very different type of
man, is equally a part of his age. He follows
the same tradition of fair treatment to his
Journalists but, though he has not the jour-
nalistic genius of his uncle?such men are
born only once In a century?he has a far
more highly developed sense of responsibility
towards the country and the social structure.
Lord Rothermere?s Instructions to me, as
Editor of the ?Daily Mail," were to keep the
news honest and clean, but to be as forthright,
even ferocious if necessary, as I wished in the
editorial columns.
During the last "general election in Britain
he took one step showing, in my view, remark-
able enlightenment: some might consider it
quixotic enlightenment.
He gave free permission to those of his
writers whose political convictions did not ac-
cord with those of the newspaper, to contract
out of that particular political battle.
Several accepted the offer and they came to
no harm in consequence.
Similarly, Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the
mammoth-circulation ?Daily Express,? does
not hesitate to employ writers and artists who
disagree with him politically?even satirists as
deadly as Nat Gubbins and New Zealand?s own
great cartoonist, David Low, to write and draw
for him. Yet their work is often hurtful in the
extreme to Lord Beaverbrook?s own political
policy.
This type of owner, I suggest, is not damag-
ing to the public good, nor does he militate
against production of the perfect newspaper.
That you have men of similar calibre operating
newspaper businesses in this country I know
to be true. I have seen them at work and I
have seen them giving similar freedom to
their writers.
There is, however, a danger here. That
happens when the professional financier (as
distinct from the genuine newspaperman) with
neither the good of the public nor the good of
the profession at heart, gains control of chains
of newspapers and uses them purely for pur-
poses of profit.
With such men, there is a tendency to ex-
tend and protect their financial interests by
buying up opposition newspapers all over the
place and closing them down.
When they operate in this fashion, they
damage the journalist. When, as sometimes
happens, they turn to polities, there is a reai
danger that they menace the public weal into
the bargain.
For then they use their monopolist news-
papers as a series of phonographs to play one
political record, and the public is deprived of
its clear right to hear all sides of any public
case.
I have yet to see this happen in the ease
of the true journalist who, by his own jour-
nalistic ability plus business acumen, has risen
to supreme control. Almost invariably the
training of such men brings with it an auto-
matic quality of responsibility, and generally,
I think we have been fortunate in the type of
journalist-proprietor this system has evolved, ?
Nevertheless, there is the possibility of abuse
here and I do not say that ways should not
be found of checking and controlling that
possibility.
Improve the present system If you like: but
I repeat, beware the alternatives now being
offered from political quarters. Otherwise you
may find that, you have replaced the pos-
sibility of abuse with actual abuse of a far
more pernicious nature, and the freedom of
the Press, which is really the freedom of the
people to read all sides, may be lost for ever.
In Britain, at least, the attacks on the
Press have come almost entirely from politi-
cal quarters, and mostly from quarters of one
political colour. They have been so far suc-
cessful that a Royal Commission is now sitting
to investigate the whole structure and methods
of operation of the Press,
Personally, while I resent the methods by
which this Commission was brought into
being, I have no objection to the Commission
Itself. I think it may serve as a boomerang,
and that it may do a very great deal in the
way of disposing of many ill-natured legends
now current about the Press of Britain and the
people w'ho control it.

Speech of MR S, G. W. HORN I BLOW.
The trouble with political inquiries of this
nature, however, is the possibility of an at-
tempt to find a purely political solution to the
supposed problem.
To some types of mind, of course, the ob-
vious solution is outright Government control.
This idea Is favoured by those who place the
State above all, and who therefore believe that
the Press as a whole should exist for the
benefit of the State, and for the benefit of the
men and Party who are running the State.
Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy tried this
method of newspaper control. We need not
enlarge on the results, where a duped and be-
wildered people, deceived by ruling megalo-
maniacs, knowing nothing of the outside world
because there was no free press to tell them,
went down to destruction in a panoply of
blood and horror such as the world has never
seen before.
Fortunately, so crude a method of control
is hardly likely in countries with a true demo-
cratic tradition.
Other suggestions almost equally fantastic
are, however, being mooted.
One is that the State should own news-
papers, but that Editors should be given judi-
cial standing and security, w'hereby they could
be removed from their posts only by a majority
vote of both houses of Parliament.
As an Editor I find the idea highly attrac-
tive. As a eitizen I find it absurd. For you
would then be giving far more power to an
individual Editor than now rests in the hands
of the most powerful newspaper owner, for the
owner today is <St least subject to the sanction
of public opinion.
So much power, in my view, is too great a
burden for one man to bear.
lie would find himself courted and flattered
on all hands; his views would be godlike and
*his security would be absolute.
He would be a strong man indeed whose
mental balance was not upset by such a pro-
cess.
Still another suggestion comes from one of
Britain's most brilliant Left-wing publicists,
Mr. Kingsley Martin. That is, that we should
follow the Czech system of permitting news-
papers to be owned only by public bodies ?
notably political parties and trades unions.
That such a suggestion should come from so
subtle a mind, and from one whom I truly
believe to have the Interests of the people at
heart, astonishes me.
Far I would go so far in the other direction
that I would make it absolutely illegal for any
political party, or any -trade union either to
own a newspaper or to have any measure of
control over the destinies of a newspaper.
I have seen many Party-owned newspapers
in my time, but I have yet to see a Party-
owned newspaper that presented its reading
public with an absolutely honest and impartial
view either of domestic events or of world
events.
It is inherent in the very nature of the Party
newspaper that it should colour apd slant its
news to suit its political policy.
My objection to trades union ownership is
similarly based. They, too, would slant their
news to suit trade union policy; they too would
serve a vested interest, and not the interest of
the community at large.
Certainly I do not believe our perfect news-
paper is possible under such a system.
Before 1 conclude this lecture, there is one
other question I would like to pose, and to
try to answer.
Does the influence of the advertiser make
our perfect newspaper impossible? This also
is one of the questions that the Royal Com-
mission has set Itself to answer.
It is a subject on which we have heard much
in recent years, A great deal of arrant non-
sense is talked about the sinister, behind-the-
scenes influence wielded by the advertiser over
the politics of newspapers.
Myself, I would place the advertiser among
the angels of our newspaper world, rather than
among its sinners, for reasons which I will
shortly explain.
But first let us answer the charge.
In the whole of my journalistic experience I
have never yet known commercial advertisers
group together to influence the political policy
of any single newspaper.
The fact is, that the advertiser is interested
a great deal in circulations and in politics not
at all.
Most of them do not even choose their own
advertising mediums. They work, instead,
through specialist highly skilled agencies who
place advertising solely with an eye to the
market for the goods they are trying to sell.
Thus expensive and luxury goods are adver-
tised in the small-sale, serious newspapers
which are read by a small but well-to-do pub-
lic. Cheap, mass-produced goods are adver-
tised in mass-circulation popular newspapers,
whatever their political complexions.
In proof of this, I again refer you to the
Press of Great Britain. Here you will find the
great advertisers supporting, with complete im-
partiality, the Conservative Daily Mall, the
Liberal News-Chronicle, the Socialist Dally
Herald and the Commumstuaily Worker.
ves, even the Communist newspaper gets its
fair quota of capitalist advertising and has no
qualms of conscience in taking the money.
You may say: all this may be true, but that
still does not make the advertiser a newspaper
angel.
No.
We rank the advertisers among the angels
because they, unintentionally if you like, pro-
vide the newspapers with the funds which en-
able them to steer clear of subsidies, and the
corruption that newspaper subsidies too often
bring in their wake.
They give the newspaper its real indepen-
dence. For I can assure you, that when sub-
sidies come in at the Editor?s door, his in-
dependence flies out of the -window.
The advertiser does something more. The
funds he provides make it possible for the
newspaper to be sold to the public at less
than half its cost price; thus they encourage
the spread of knowledge of events over the
widest possible area.
For without the advertiser the newspaper
could not be sold at an economic price.
The Owner or the Editor would then be
forced to seek subsidies either from the Govern-
ment or from political parties, or vested in-
terests of some other description. The Editor
in that case becomes the servant of outside
interests, and certainly our perfect newspaper
becomes quite Impossible.
I have covered the field tonight as widely as
the time at my disposal and the limits of my
ability permit.
What kind of an answer then, have we
produced to our initial question, ?Is the per-
fect newspaper possible??
Not, I fear, a very satisfactory one, but
nevertheless perhaps an honest one.
The perfect newspaper is possible, given free-
dom of expression, the Perfect Editor, the Per-
fect Staff, the Perfect Owner, and, above all,
the Perfect Public,
I do not think that all of these things are
yet within our reach.
But I do think that the vast majority of
newspaper owjjers, -newspaper editors and
working.-journalists -are struggling hard to at-
tain -'perfection within lithe limits of their
'Above all, although we may not yet have
produced .the perfect newspaper under our
own democratic system, I am completely con-
vinced that it is the only system under which
our aim has the remotest possibility of being
achieved at all.
