LANGUAGE OF THE BIRDHAWAL TRIBE, IN GIPPS-
LAND, VICTORIA.
By R. H. MATHEWS, L.S.
(Read October 4, 1907.)
In the following contribution I shall endeavor to give an outline
of the grammatical structure of the language of the Birdhawal
tribe, prepared from notes taken by myself among the survivors
of these people. Their hunting grounds were mainly in the extreme
eastern corner of the State of Victoria, but they also occupied a
small strip of country within the New South Wales frontier. Their
boundary may be approximately defined as follows: Commencing
on the sea coast, at Cape Conron, and reaching thence along the
coast to Mullacoota Inlet, including the following rivers and their
tributaries—Bemm, Cann, Thurra, Wingan and Genoa. Ihe Bird-
hawal territory extended inland from the sea coast to Bonang, Dele-
gete, Craigie, and some other places in that district.
It will be seen that the foregoing description crosses the boun-
dary between New South Wales and Victoria, and takes in the head
waters of the Queenboro, Bondi and Nungatta creeks.
The initiation ceremony of the Birdhawal tribe, known as the
Dyerrayal, has been described by me with considerable fullness in
a contribution to the Anthropological Society of Vienna, 1 to which
the reader is referred.
All along their western side, the Birdhawal are met by the
Kurnai tribe, for a description of the extent of whose territory the
reader is referred to my article on “ The Victorian Aborigines,”
which I contributed to the Anthropological Society of Washington,
U. S. A., in 1898. 2 For a short grammar and vocabulary of the
Kurnai, see my “ Aboriginal Languages of Victoria,” contributed to
the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1902. 3

tribution of the Native Tribes of Victoria.

Among the Kurnai, bra means mankind, but kurnai or kunnai
distinguishes one of their own men. In the Birdhawal, mawp
means mankind, whilst gidyang signifies a man of their own tribe.
Detachments of the Birdhawal community who inhabited the densely
timbered tracts, were called zvaggarak. The Birdhawal call their
own dialect muk-dhang, but they distinguish the dialect of the
Kurnai as gunggala-dhang. The termination dhang in both in-
stances means “ mouth,” and is symbolical of speech. It may also
be mentioned that the Kurnai call their own local dialect muk-
dhang, and that of the Birdhawal kzvai-dhang. Muk means good
or great, and kzvai signifies rough; I forget the meaning of
giinggala.
If we take the whole of that portion of the State of Victoria
lying to the east of the 146th meridian of longitude, and situated
between the sea coast and the great dividing range or Australian
Alps, we find that the language of the native tribes has the same
grammatical structure. This region of Victoria is commonly known
as Gippsland, and the language prevailing over the whole area is
the Birdhawal, or dialects of the Birdhawal. A glance at a map
of Victoria will show that this tract of country embraces the entire
sea coast from Cape Howe westerly to Waratah Bay, and extends
thence northerly to the great dividing range.
The social organization of the Birdhawal is substantially the same
as that of the Wo'iwurru, Bunwurru, Thagungwurru and other
tribes, which has been described by me elsewhere. 1 The social
structure of the Birdhawal is also analogous to that of the Thur-
rawal and kindred tribes situated to the northeast of them in New
South Wales, with which I have already dealt in several publications.
Orthography.
The system of orthoepy adopted is that recommended by the
Royal Geographical Society, London, but a few additional rules of
spelling have been introduced by me, to meet the requirements of
the Australian pronunciation.
Eighteen letters of the English alphabet are sounded, comprising
1 Journ. Roy. Soc. N. S. Wales , XXXVIII., pp. 297-304.


thirteen consonants, namely: b, d, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, t, w, y, and
five vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
As far as possible, vowels are unmarked, but in some instances,
to prevent ambiguity, the long sound of a, e, i, 6 and u are given as
here represented. Where the short sound of these vowels was
otherwise doubtful, they are marked thus: a, e, 6 and u.
It is frequently difficult to distinguish between the short sound of
a and that of u. A thick sound of iis occasionally met with, which
closely resembles the short sound of u or a.
B has an intermediate pronunciation between its proper sonant
sound and the surd sound of p. The two letters are practically
interchangeable.
G is hard in all cases, and often has the sound, of k, with which it
is generally interchangeable.
W, when it commences a syllable or word, has its ordinary English
sound. The sound of wh in our word “ what ” has no equivalent
in the native tongue. When W occurs in the middle or at the end
of a syllable, it is pronounced as in the English words “ pawn ” and
“ law ” respectively.
Ng at the beginning of a word or syllable has a peculiar nasal
sound as in the English word “ singer.” If we alter the syllabifica-
tion of this word and write it “ si-nger,” then the ng of “ -nger ”
will represent the aboriginal sound. Or if we take the expression
“ hang up ” and change it into “ ha-ngup,” and then pronounce it
so that the two syllables melt into each other, the ng of “-ngup ”
will also be the sound required. At the end of a syllable, ng has the
sound of ng in king.
The sound of the Spanish n frequently occurs. At the beginning
of a word or syllable it is given as ny, but when terminating a word
the Spanish letter n is used.
Dh is pronounced nearly as th in “ that,” with a slight sound of d
preceding it. Nh has likewise nearly the sound of th in that, with a
perceptible initial sound of the n.
Th is frequently used at the commencement of a word instead of
dh, and in such cases an initial t sound is substituted for that of
the d. Dh and th are generally interchangeable. At the beginning


of a word our English sound of d and t seldom occurs; it is gener-
ally pronounced dh or th, in the way just explained.
A final h is guttural, resembling ch in the German word “ joch.”
Y at the commencement of a word or syllable preserves its
habitual sound.
R in general has a whirring sound, at other times it is rolled, and
occasionally the English value is assigned to it.
T is interchangeable with d, p with b, and g with k, in most of
the words in which these letters are used.
Ty or dy at the commencement of a syllable or word has nearly
the sound of the English j or Spanish ch, thus -dya in the word
wom-ba-dya, closely resembles cha or ja.
Some native words terminate with ty, as brety, the hand. This
word can be pronounced exactly by assuming e to be added to the
final y, making it bret-ye. Then commence articulating this word,
including the y, but stopping short without sounding the added e.
An approximate pronunciation can also be obtained by substituting
ch for the y, making it bretcli, but omitting the final hissing sound
when pronouncing it. In some of the words in the vocabulary I
have given the terminal letters tch instead of ty, as being more easily
mastered by lay readers.
In order to express the native sound of some words, I have used
the initial letters wr and mr. The word zvruk, the ground or earth,
can be got exactly by making it wu-ruk' , and then pronouncing it
as one syllable, with the accent on the last letter. Wring, the ear,
can be similarly articulated. Mring, the eye, can be pronounced by
making it mu-ring', and treating it as one syllable. Mrety or
mretch, fire, can be pronounced in the same way.
Articles.
The indefinite article, “ a,” is not represented; but the demon-
strative pronouns, in their numerous modifications, supply the place
of the difinite article, “ the” The adverbs “ here ” and “ there,”
in their several native forms are treated as demonstratives, and are
then substitutes for the definite article. Many of them are subject
to inflection for person and number, and some have causative
suffixes.


Nouns.
Nouns are subject to variation on account of number, gender
and case, the inflection being effected by means of postpositions.
Number. —There are three numbers. The singular number de-
notes one; the dual, two or a pair; the plural number, more than
two. Ngurka, a native bear. Ngurkabulang, a couple of bears.
Ngurkawamba, several bears.
Gender. —ln the human family sex is distinguished by the em-
ployment of different words. Mawp, a man. Kurragan, a woman.
The gender of animals is distinguished by the words brangula and
yuggana, placed after the name of the animal. Ngurka brangula,
a male bear; ngurka yuggana, a female bear.
For a few of the animals, a specific word represents the male,
without naming the creature, but in the case of the female, the ani-
mal’s name must be stated, followed by the distinguishing word,
yuggana. When the name of any animal is mentioned, without
some word signifying the sex, the masculine gender is understood.
Case. —The cases are indicated by inflections—the following
being the principal.
Nominative: This case merely names the subject, and is without
flection. Gungarang, an opossum; burru, a kangaroo; buran, a
spear.
Causative: This represents the subject in action, and is used
with a transitive verb. Mawpu gungarang bundan, a man an opos-
sum killed. Kurraganu kalkun mangan, a woman an eel caught.
Genitive: A peculiarity of this case, which I was the first author
to report in any Australian language, 1 is that the property and the
proprietor each take a suffix. Bagurdyu mawpa, a man’s boom-
erang.
Every object or article over which ownership can be exercised
is subject to inflection for person and number; as, bagurdya, my
boomerang; bagurngunna, thy boomerang; bagurnga, his boom-
erang, and so on. The dual and plural contain “ inclusive ” and
“ exclusive ” forms in the first person.
1,1 The Thoorga Language,” Queensland Geographical Journal (1901),
Vol. XVII., pp. 52-53-


Instrumental: When an instrument is the remote object of the
verb, it takes the same suffix as the causative. Mawpu burru bun-
dan buranu, a man a kangaroo killed with a spear.
Accusative: This is the same as the nominative.
There are inflections to denote motion towards or away from
any place or thing. Banggea, towards a camp. Bangga, away
from a camp.
Adjectives.
Adjectives succeed the nouns they qualify and take the same
inflections for number and case. The suffix is often omitted from
one of the words, leaving the noun only, or the adjective only, to
indicate the declension. Comparison is effected by two positive
statements, such as: This is good—that is bad.
Pronouns.
Pronouns are inflected for persion, number and case, but are
without gender. The following are examples in the singular number
of the nominative and possessive pronouns:
(First person I Ngaiu Mine Ngaindya
Second person Thou Ngindu Thine Ngingunna
Third person He Mindha His Ngaianga
In the dual and plural forms of the pronouns there is a double
“we ” in the first person, marked “ inclusive ” and “ exclusive ”
respectively.
f First ncrsnn / We, inclusi y e Ngallu
n . J l We, exclusive Ngallung
70 ] Second person You Ngindubul
t Third person They Mindhabullong
ft,. . /We, inclusive Ngangun
p, , J irs P erson 1 We, exclusive Ngangunnang
I Second person You Ngindigan
Third person They Mindhagullang
These full forms of the pronouns are not much used, except in
answer to a question, or assertively. If some one ask, “ Who is
going hunting?” a man may answer, Ngaiu, “I am,” or Ngallung,
“we (dual exclusive) are.” If an inquiry be made, “Whose food
is this?” some one may reply, pointing to a certain individual,
Ngaianga, “his,” and so on.


There is but little regularity in the pronouns of the third person
in any of the numbers. This is owing to a word more or less dif-
ferent being used to express whether the person meant is near, or
at some distance; whether he is going away from, or coming towards,
the speaker; whether he is in the front, or in the rear, and so on.
Interrogatives : Who, nganinde ? What, nganna ? How many,
nau-wun ?
Demonstratives: Dyinda, this or here. Mindha, that or there.
There it is, munda. These demonstratives are declinable for the
dual and plural numbers.
There are likewise forms of the pronouns meaning “ for me,”
“ from me,” “ with me,” etc., which extend through all the persons
and numbers.
Verbs. •
Verbs have the usual numbers, persons and moods, as well as
an inclusive and exclusive form in the first person of the dual and
plural. The following is a short conjugation of the verb “to strike
or beat.” In most Australian languages the word for striking also
means to kill.
Indicative—Singular.
Person. Present. Past. ' Future.
First person Bundanetch Bundadya Bundinga
Second person Bundadu Bundani Bundinyin
Third person Bunda Bundan Bundin
Although the inflections on the above words sufficiently indicate
the person to a native listener, there would be no objection to pre-
fixing the full pronoun, as, Ngaiu bundanetch, Ngindu bundadu,
and so on.
The future tenses of the first person of the dual and plural are
as under:
n , f We, inclusive, shall beat Bundinyil
Dual | We, exc i us j ve> shall beat Bundinyillung
p, , f We, inclusive, shall beat Bundingun
i uirai | We, exclusive, shall beat Bundingunnang
Imperative Beat
Bundin!
Reflective.
The reflective form of the verb describes an action which the
subject executes directly upon himself:


I am beating myself, Bundhattharanetch. All the remaining
persons and numbers can be inflected in the same way.
Reciprocal.
There is a form of the verb to express that two or more persons
are reciprocally doing the act described:
We, dual, are beating each other, Bundhaiadyillung.
We, plural, are beating each other, Bundhaiagundhiang; and so
on for the second and third persons of the dual and plural.
In the past and future tenses of verbs, there are variable termi-
nations to indicate that the act described was done in the imme-
diate, recent, or remote past; or that the act will be performed in
the proximate, or more or less distant future. That there was, or
shall be, a repetition or continuance of the action, and other modi-
fications of the verbal suffixes, which must be passed over for the
present.
Owing to the several inflections of the verb in the past and future
tenses just referred to, it is often found convenient, especially when
speaking in the dual and plural, to prefix a complete pronoun from
the table of pronouns. This leaves the termination of the verb freer
for the various suffixes required to convey the different meanings.
There is no special form for the passive voice. The sentence,
“a man was kicked by an emu,” would be expressed by the para-
phrase, “ an emu kicked a man.”
Adverbs.
Yes, nyung. No, kalligo. To-day, wadya. This evening, warin.
Yesterday, buna. To-morrow, mimburin. By and by, kalla. Some
time back, buni-i. Here or this, dyinda. There or that, mindhi.
Away yonder, bubburike. Where, ngulman. Dhunggo, here. I
am here, dhunggomanetch; thou art here, dhunggomangunna; he is
here, dhunggomana.
Prepositions.
The equivalents of our English prepositions are in some cases
separate words, but are also frequently expressed by a verb, as in
the Dyirringan 1 and other languages.
1 Journ. Roy. Soc. N. S. Wales (1902), Vol. XXXVI., p. 166.


Some prepositions can be inflected for person and number. In
front of me, dhangullindya. In front of thee, dhangullingunna.
In front of him, dhangullana.
Numerals.
One, gu-du-ge or gu-dug. Two, bolang. Several, bunganbandhak.
Birdhawal Vocabulary.
This vocabulary comprises about 285 of the most commonly used
words in the Mukdhang speech, every item having been noted down
by myself from the mouths of the natives. Words of the same kind
are grouped under common headings. It is thought that this
arrangement will be more convenient for reference and comparison
than if tabulated alphabetically.

Language of the Kurnai Tribe.
APPENDIX.
In a monograph published in 1902 1 I submitted an elementary
grammar of the Gunggaladhang, the language spoken by the Kurnai
tribe, whose country is situated to the west of and adjoining that
of the Birdhawal. In the paper referred to, the examples given in
the pronouns and verbs were very much abridged, owing to exigen-
cies of space, and therefore I am now desirous of supplementing
what was then published, being the result of further investigations
made by myself among the natives. If this additional information
be read in conjunction with my memoir of five years ago, and the
vocabulary of 300 words which accompanied it, the whole will then
exhibit an outline of the grammar of the Gunggaladhang tongue.
While many of the words of the Gunggaladhang are nearly
the same as those of the Birdhawal, there are a large number which
are altogether different. The closest agreement is found among
the pronouns and some of the verbs.

Pronouns.
The following additional examples are now supplied
n , I - f We, inclusive, Ngallu
Dual First person { We ; Nlallang
Plural Firm nersnn i We > inclusive > Ngangan
k 11 1 We, exclusive, Ngangannang
There are also forms for the second and third persons in all
the numbers. The full forms of the pronouns given in this and the
original table are employed chiefly in answering questions. In
ordinary conversation the natives use the pronominal suffixes illus-
trated under the heading of Verbs.
Verbs.
In my former memoir, already quoted, in the second example
of the inflection of verbs, at page 95, the past tense of the verb
dhakani, “to see,” was inadvertently set down as the present. I
therefore wish to expunge lines 19 to 21 inclusive on page 95, and
substitute the following fuller details of another verb, dhanggani ,
“ to speak,” in their stead:—
.Indicative Mood —Present Tense.
