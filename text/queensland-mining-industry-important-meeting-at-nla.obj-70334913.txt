The Chairman : I think you will agree with me that the Incorporated
Australasian Chamber of Mines has very quickly shown its fitness for
doing the work which it has undertaken, for it has given us an
opportunity of hearing our distinguished visitor, the Right Hon. Sir
Hugh Nelson, Premier of the colony of Queensland, speak to us on
the question of the mining industry of that colony. The notice
which has called us together refers, as you see, to the mining
industry of Queensland. Numerous and important as the resources
of the colony may be, what is present to my mind, at any rate
more particularly, are the goldfields of Queensland. Now, I think
lam right in saying that these goldfields have been discovered
and have been developed almost exclusively by local enterprise and by
local capital, but I think it is quite clear that local enterprise and local
capital are inadequate for the purpose, and I cannot help thinking, if
the auriferous resources of Queensland are properly placed before
investors in this country, that a very large share of outside capital and
enterprise will find its way for their development. Now you have not
met to-day to hear me, but you have met to hear Sir Hugh Nelson,
and I will not stand any longer between you and him, but shall have
the pleasure and honpur of at once introducing him to you. I may
say here that we had invited the Hon. T. J. Byrnes to address you, but
unfortunately he is not able to be here. He hopes, however, on a
future occasion, to have an opportunity, under the auspices of the
Chamber of Mines, of addressing the people here. We have also


?besides Sir Hugh Nelson, a very competent officer, Mr. W. H. Rands,
the Government Geologist of Queensland, so that on this question of the
mining industry of Queensland you will not leave this room without
being thoroughly, and I think, completely informed. (Applause.)
The Right Hon. Sir Hugh M. Nelson, who was received with cheers,
said: Sir James Garrick and Gentlemen?When the secretary of this
Association asked me to come to a meeting of the Chamber, I had to
inform him that as far as mining was concerned it was an industry in
which I had no personal experience whatever. You are all aware that,
as far as the colony of Queensland is concerned, the pastoral industry
is the first, and mining is the second. I have been engaged all my life
in the formerof these, namely, in the pastoral industry, and with mining
I have had little or nothing whatever to do, as far as my own personal
experience goes. I think, however, that this Chamber of Mines is a
good thing, in this way, that it will insure to the public that every
opportunity will be taken by the Chamber of getting the most
reliable information with regard to the mining industry, not only of
Queensland, but also of other colonies. The result of my experience
is that the sutor should stick to his last. I have done fairly
well in the business with which I have been engaged, namely, that of
pastoral extension, and I have come to the conclusion that mining also
should be confined to people who have experience of that particular
business. It is not everybody who is qualified to invest money in
mines, or to say whether the country which holds out prospects is
really likely to give a proper return for the money they have invested
in it. Hence I feel that the objects of this association are very laudable,
and I have no hesitation in commending them to the public
of Great Britain. When I say this, I do not for a moment
wish to discourage investment of capital in the colony with which
I am connected. On the contrary, I think that it opens up a very
large field for investment. I consider that we have very large oppor-
tunities, which, if they are seized and taken advantage of, may be the
means of producing an enormous amount of wealth. I come, however,
more for the purpose of introducing to you Mr. Rands, who has been
engaged in the mining department of Queensland for at least 14 years.
He has visited all the fields and the gold-bearing areas within the
colony; he is intimately acquainted with them, and can, therefore,
speak from experience, and also as an expert geologist. But i must
draw your attention to one or two facts, which have been broug
prominently before me by the Mines Department during a very recent
period. I need not tell you that we keep up a very effective and effi-
cient department with regard to this industry in the colony, and I
have every confidence that whatever statements they promulgate can
be taken as reliable. Now, the secretary of the Minister says that ? the
assistance of outside capital to promote the development of many a
valuable mine that is at present perhaps allowed to he idle, or is only
nominally worked in a desultory and wasteful manner, is, however, the
great want of the hour, and it may be said here truthfully that this
colony certainly does not receive the attention of the outside investor
during a period of plethora of money that in reality it deserves ; in
fact, nearly the whole of the enterprise that has been shown now for
several years, and with very few exceptions, has been that of local
men. I doubt much if there exists an equal field for the lucrative
employment of capital in mining to that which is presented by Queens-
land, alwavs provided that it is laid out with judgment and economy.
The shocking example of the past, where unheard-of extravagance,
stupendous ignorance, and the wiles of the promoters, have M to
disastrous results, should act as beacons that should clearly point out tlie
shoals on which any venture would be bound to be wrecked.? 1 thin* tnat
the experience of the Under Secretary of the Mining Department is well
worthy of consideration. In many other things, as well as mining, we nave
had distress in the colony by trying to go too far, and the way we can use
our good sense, I think, with regard to these matters is to treat tnem as
lessons for the future, and to see that any such mistakes as have been


made in the past should not again, recur. Many matters have been
brought before my notice, during my short stay in London, with
regard to the conditions of mining in the colony. With respect to
this, I may say that a Royal Commission was appointed some months
ago, which was expected to give in a report during the Session of
Parliament which is now sitting. I am advised, however, that they
have not been able to do so as yet, and that they have applied for an
extension of time. We look to that report, as the Commission is
?composed of men of mining experience, with some hope that it will
point out and make suggestions to Parliament as to what alterations
?are required in our Mining Laws. I need hardly say that the whole
feeling of Queensland is to encourage to the utmost degree confidence
in the capitalists who have invested their money in the colony, and I
have no doubt whatever in saying that such steps will be taken as
seem expedient to thoroughly secure that very desirable object.
(Applause.) Any suggestions that the Chamber can make us will
always be received and taken into consideration. A good deal of the
work of the Department of Mines, as you are aware, consists of making
regulations, and with regard to these regulations the Minister is at all
times open to receive suggestions, because he has the power through the
Executive Council to make any amendment or alterations in the
regulations which may seem to be desirable in the interests of the
colony. I hope, therefore, that we shall have the assistance of the
Chamber, and I can say in return that whatever information or
suggestions the Government can supply to the Chamber will be most
freely accorded. We are only too glad to get the exact state of
the case, as it exists, as widely known as possible, because it
has not been to the interest of any colonies to permit the investment
of money which may at once be unprofitable and unproductive. I
consider that some of the regulations at present in existence may
perhaps be a little too stringent. It is quite possible with regard to
the conditions dealing with labour, where the regulations require one
man for every acre, and which regulations have been passed for the sole
purpose of insuring bona fidcs on the part of the lessee of the land, it
is quite possible that bona fides may be secured in some other and
more equitable way. As far as lam aware myself of the state of the
matter, I think it would be a? very good idea to take machinery into
account, and, if the people can show that they have spent a certain
amount of money on machinery, I think that should be taken as a
very good, and one of the best, tests of bona fides on the part of the
lessee. I only mention that as one of the matters that will always
receive, as I have said, our most favourable consideration. (Applause.)
As you know, it is the duty of every Government to promote the
interests of the colony, and to see that no one interest is subordinated
to another. lam not aware myself that the mining industry clashes
with any of the other important industries of the colony. It, I think,
would do more harm than good if unlimited freedom were given to
take up areas in gold mining districts, unless we could insure in some
way they were taken up for the purpose of being worked, and practical
means taken to discover whether the country is gold-bearing or not.
(Hear, hear.) We have had the very same thing in the history of the
colony?where at one time pastoralists were allowed to take up country
by simply putting in a tender for it. What was the consequence of
that ? One was that thousands of square miles of country were take n
up by people, not for the purpose of running stock on it, but for holding it
until it became of more value, and then selling it to someone else. The
effect of that was disastrous in the colony, because if a bond fide settler
came, instead of being able to go to the verge of settlement he was
often compelled to go one or two hundred miles beyond, where there was
no settlement at all. The intermediate part was held purely by the
speculator, and therefore I have no hesitation in saying that that
retarded for many years the progress of the colony. The cure for that
was this : An Act was passed to the effect that land so held, unless it was
stocked within a reasonable time, would become forfeited. That


immediately led to the stocking of the country, and to the settlement-
of people upon it, so that persons were able to go beyond where it was
stocked, and take up the country which had hitherto been unutilised.
Well, the same question applies to mining. We must take steps to-
insure that areas which are granted on lease are granted for the pur-
pose of bond fide practical utilisation. But, as I have said, if we can
secure that by some other means than that of the one condition of
labour, I have no hesitation in saying that it would be proper to advocate
it, provided we secure the same object. Complaints have been made as
to the rent charge, but Ido not put much account upon that. I think
the rent we charge of �1 an acre is exceedingly low. It may by com-
parison be high, considering that we grant land for other purposes,.
such as agricultural purposes, at a rental varying from up to 2d. or
3d. an acre. But you must take this into consideration, that when a
mining lease is granted, the lessee differs from the person who cultivates
the ground, where even if he misuses the land, either by over-stocking
or by bad cultivation, yet we know Nature if left to itself will restore that -
land again in course of time. But, with regard to mining, the property
gets exhausted, and once taken away there is no provision for any
further supply. And for gold-bearing country particularly Ido not
think that any reasonable person would object to the
rental, which I consider a very moderate one, of �1 per
acre. In connection with the Department of Mines, we spent ?
last year some �23,000 in administration, and also in assisting in deep-
sinking and prospecting. The total income we received direct from the ?
mines, in miners? rights and such like, and in survey fees, amounted t0�22,000,
�22,000, so that you see the benefit to the colony derived from mining
is almost wholly indirect. The indirect benefit, I admit, and I think
everyone will allow, is very large, because what we want in a colony
like Queensland is people. We want men and women, and if we can
attract them by means of our gold-bearing areas, or if we can attract the
capitalists to take up those gold-bearing areas and invest his money in
machinery and labour, then we effect the object that we have in view. We
also get some revenue from the dividend tax, a tax which I opposed when
it was put on, and one which, whenever we can afford it, it will give me
the greatest pleasure to propose the repeal of. (Applause.) It is a tax
which I do not much believe in, because I think it does have the effect to
some extent of scaring away capital from the colony, and without capital
we know that we cannot have full employment of the men we have,,
or have any hopes of increasing the numbers of our population. 1
will leave Mr. Rands to speak to you about the arrangements of the
gold-bearing areas. I may mention, however, with regard to Gympie,
that the total yield to the end of 1896 has been 2,109,568 oz., valued at
�7,383,500. During the ten years ending December, 1896, the dividends
have amounted to �1,534,620, and the calls to �851,932 ; or an excess of
dividends over calls of �682,688. With regard to Mount Morgan, this
mine in 10 years has produced no less than 1,472,164 oz. of gold, of a net
value of �6,055,406, and has paid away in dividends �4,100,000.
During the period I have named, 591,644 tons have been treated, for a
yield of just under oz. per ton of gold, worth �4 4s. Bd. per oz., which
is the purest native gold known. With regard to Charters Towers, to
the end of 1896 it has yielded 3,580,000 oz. of gold, valued _at
�12,500,000. This mining area has made very great progress, which
I may illustrate by pointing out to you that from 1880 to 1885 during
that quinquennium, the annual average yield was 95,000 ozs. In the
following five years it went up to 152,000 ozs., and from 1890 to 1895
it still further progressed, and produced 254,000 ozs. During the four
years ending December, 1895?and I have not the latest returns with
me?the dividends on Charters Towers have exceeded the calls by
�859,392. I have further to direct your attention to the fact that
gold is not the only mineral which offers profitable employment and
investment in the colony. Copper, for instance, although it does not
bring in anything like the return now that it did some 25 years ago, is
still carried on to some extent, and last year it resulted in an export


of 432 tons. Silver is also on the decrease, on account of the
depreciation in value, but I think the result of 1895 is a slight increase,
the export being 225,000 tons of ore. Coal remains stationary, and up
to the present there has been produced in Queensland something con-
siderably over 4,000,000 tons of coal, worth about �1,837,000, the output
last year being slightly in excess of that of the year before. Tin is
very much in the same condition as silver and copper. Whereas, about
the year 1872, when we were producing tin ore to the value of �600,000,
we are now producing it to the value of somewhere about �68,000.
I do not know that I need trouble you with any further remarks on
this particular industry. I say lam in favour of relaxing any con-
ditions which are found to be too hard. I see no objection, for instance,
where three or four men have combined, or where the same company of
lessees hold three or four mines, why one shaft should not be allowed
to work the whole area; and anything that will go in the direction
of the saving of unprofitable expenditure I think is the object
that we ought to have before us. Nothing is to be gained for a colony
ultimately, although it may seem otherwise at the time, by spending
money which is unproductive. (Applause.) So far from doing the
colony good, it is more likely to do it harm. I thank you, gentlemen,
for the kind way in which you have listened to me, on a subject on
which I do not profess to be an expert; but I have pleasure in intro-
ducing to you Mr. Rands, who will be able to give you any particulars
in regard to the undeveloped resources of the colony. (Applause.)
Mr. W. H. Rands : Sir James Garrick and Gentlemen, ?I intend to
condense as far as possible what I have to say this afternoon, and in the
short time at my disposal it is not my intention to refer at length to
the older and more prosperous gold mining districts of the colony, such
as Charters Towers, Gympie, and Mount Morgan. They have for some
years past, and are to-day, speaking for themselves, by the solid fa cts
of yields and dividends, far more strongly, and certainly more
eloquently, than I could hope to do for them. Sir Hugh Nelson has
already referred to these fields, and I will confine myself to those about
which too little is known even in Queensland, and still less, I believe, in
this country?fields which have given good returns in times past, and
which, for one reason or another, have been abandoned. The fields to
which I allude are situated in outlying and distant parts of Northern
Queensland. They were discovered at a time when that portion of our
territory was all but unknown land, except to a few of our more
venturesome pastoral and mining pioneers, and the very fact they they
attracted large mining populations to such out of the way places, where
the very necessaries of existence could only be obtained at most exor-
bitant rates, and sometimes scarcely even then ; I say that in face of
such drawbacks, the fact that they not only attracted, but sup-
ported, and in some instances made the fortunes of these early
settlers is a proof of the richness of these fields about which I
intend to speak. The fields to which I am going to refer more
particularly are the Hodgkinson, the Palmer, the Etheridge,
and the Croydon. The last-mentioned goldfield?Croydon?does
not quite come under the same catagory, in that it is of more recent
discovery, and that it boasts of a far more settled population than the
others. Still, it is one, doubtless to a great extent from its isolated
position and great distance from the capital, that has not been worked
on economical lines, or with the latest modern appliances for raising
the stone and extracting the gold. The Hodgkinson Goldfield is
situated about 60 miles west of Cairns, on the western side of the Cairns
Range, and the reefs, which extend over an area of about 700 square
miles, are in stratified rocks of the same age as those of Gympie. In
the central portion of the field that surrounds the townships of Thorn-
borough and Kingsborough, from 87 separate claims, 71,396 tons of
stone have been raised, yielding 103,777 ounces of gold, or equal to
1 oz. 9dwts. per ton, and the total yield of the whole field during the
twenty years of its - existence has been 231,707 ozs. And yet, notwith-
standing these returns, the field has been practically abandoned since


the early eighties. At one time there was a population of about 7,000,.
and now I believe there are not more than about 200 Europeans in the-
district. To illustrate the small amount of work that has been done on
this field, I may mention that the deepest mine, the Tyrconnel, has a
shaft down only 414 ft., and that there are only 29 mines which have
had an output exceeding 1,000 ozs. of gold each, their aggregate being
87,749 ozs., or an average of only a little over 3,000 ozs. per mine. Of
course, we hear from the miners that the reefs on this field do not-
go down, but this statement can hardly be accepted when we find that.
23 claims averaged from 2 to 6 ozs. of gold to the ton, and that the very
last crushing before abandonment at 16 claims went between 2 and 5.
ozs. to the ton, and that from 31 other claims between 1 and 2 ozs. to
the ton. No ! some other reason for the abandonment of these claims,
must be looked for, and it is not difficult to find when we remember
that the cost of carriage of machinery, mining stores, and the
necessaries of life, over the range from the coast, was so excessive as to
be almost prohibitive. The carting of mine timber and firewood to the-
mines, and of quartz to the mills, was very expensive indeed, and
crushing, of course, cost at least two or three times as much as it.
would at the present day. The crushing mills were too often not of
the best description, and lost more than a fair percentage of the miner?s,
gold. It is not to be wondered at that the mines, worked under such
conditions, by small parties of miners, without any capital, should
have been abandoned immediately they got beyond the power of the-
windlass and the w T hip, or when the yield of gold from the stone fell
below 3 or 4 ozs. to the ton, as nothing less than that could possibly
have paid with such a system of working. Now matters have been
changed to a great extent. There is a railway which has surmounted
the difficulty of the coast range, and comes within 35 miles of the-
very centre of the field. In all probability, it will be continued when
the population of the field grows and warrants its extension, a time
which, 1 believe, is not very far distant. Machinery _ and goods
can now be landed on the field for a very little more than it would cost
to place them on a field situated in a similar position to Charters Towers.
Many, if not most, of the reefs, are open to the first comer; they
are lying idle, and I feel safe in saying that capital invested in properly
opening up these reefs and placing the latest and most efficient winding
and gold-saving machinery on the field will bring a rich harvest of
returns. The timber in the Hodgkinson district is not too good, but ?
the railway has done much to do away with that drawback. The
Palmer is another field the future prospects of which seem exceedingly
bright, which has lain idle now for very many years. Lp to the-
present time this has been chiefly an alluvial field, and has yielded no
less than �5,000,000 worth of gold since its discovery in 1873-
Geologically it is a continuation of the Hodgkinson rocks. The
alluvial, which extended for over 100 miles along the Palmer river and
its tributaries, has long since been worked out, and the population has.
decreased from 20,000 to a hundred or two. When the alluvial was
practically exhausted, most of the population left, and the field was.
almost abandoned. A few stopped to try the reefs, which were
certainly in many instances very rich near the surface, but here again
they were worked by miners without any capital, or by small syndicates
with far too little capital to develop the mines in a proper manner,,
and they were compelled to abandon them as soon as the first check
was met with. The miner on the Palmer had to contend with the
same drawbacks as his brother on the Hodgkinson, but even
to a still greater extent. If provisions, machinery, carting, crush-
ing, &c., were expensive on the Hodgkinson, still more so were
they on the Palmer. Flour sold at 2s. 6d. per lb.,_ and everything
else was at the same extravagant ra?e. _ The railway now runs
from Cooktown to the Laura, to within 50 miles of the very centre of
the field, doing away with about 80 miles of the roughest portion of
the road, over which goods and machinery had to be carried. A
consequent reduction in the price of everything has taken place, the


carriage being reduced from �4O to �5 per ton. The great drawbacks,
to this field are, perhaps, the water and timber questions. The mines
themselves are said to contain so much water that it is very difficult
to contend with, while on the surface there is a lack of. water for
crushing purposes. Both these difficulties, however, can, I think, be
easily disposed of. Water, which to men working only with the wind-
lass and whip seems insurmountable is soon reduced by pumping
machinery, and would be, in dry seasons, of great use to the crushing
mills, while the rainfall is certainly sufficient, with properly constructed
dams, to keep the mills going all through the year. I may mention
that the Anglo-Saxon?the deepest mine on the field?has experienced
no trouble with water. Want of water, of course, is a natural and
permanent drawback, but this could be minimised by improved means
of transport. I will not weary you with many returns ; a few will be
sufficient to give an idea of what sort of reefs are lying idle, waiting
for capital to come along and unearth their gold. There is the Ida
Reef; its greatest depth is 250 ft., and they have raised 7,100
tons of stone for 13,264 ozs. of gold, or nearly 2 ozs. to the
ton. That mine has been abandoned now for thirteen years. The
Queen, which has been abandoned for over ten years, has raised 7,082
tons of stone for 15,168 ozs., or 2 ozs. of gold per ton. The
Comet, with a depth of 257 ft., has raised 2,678 tons, for
5,446 ozs. of gold or over 2 ozs. to the ton. The Louisa,
which has been lying idle for thirteen years, has crushed
1,295 tons for 1,846 ozs., or ozs. to the ton. The greatest depth
attained is 100 ft. The Mountain Maid has crushed 3,080 tons for
5,723 ozs. That mine has been idle for the last ten years. The Anglo-
Saxon, discovered in 1887, has crushed 17,904 tons for 28,076 ozs.; equal
to over 1J ozs. per ton; and this mine is still working. The Alexander,
which has recently been taken up again, between 1878 and 1880
crushed 183 tons for 1,262 ozs. This gives you an idea of the sort of
reefs and claims that have been left there for the first comer to take
up. As late as Christmas Day in the year 1895 a reef was discovered
by a miner which has since yielded 326 ozs. from tons of stone, and
assay shows that payable gold is still left in the tailings. I alluded to
the immense amount of alluvial gold that has been produced by this
field, and the question of its origin is of very great importance when
considering the future of the' field. The gold in the gulleys and creeks
in the neighbourhood of Maytown, near the reefs, was what is called
by the miners ?specimen gold ? ; that is, gold with quartz attached to
it, and it was also very coarse. Nuggets up to 80 ozs. in weight were
unearthed, while lower down the river the gold was of a finer descrip-
tion. These facts would naturally lead one to the conclusion that the
gold had come out of the neighbouring reefs, and if so the reefs must
be very rich, for we can hardly believe that the work of denudation has
entirely emptied them of their gold contents. I think what I have
said about this Palmer field is sufficient to show you the character of
the field lying there almost abandoned. With reference to the Etheridge,
the auriferous area of the country extends over a vast distance, some-
thing like 9,000 square miles. Geologically, it consists chiefly of granite,
with mica schist. The principal mining centres which lie scattered
over this large area are Georgetown, Charlestown, Durham, and Cum-
berland. The output of gold for the last twenty years from this and
the Woolgar field, which lies immediately to the south, has remained
very steadily at from 20,000 to 25,000 ozs. of gold per annum. This, of
course, is a very small amount from a field of such great extent; but
as soon as we get capital there to develop those mines, you may be sure
that that amount will be more than doubled or trebled. But much
the same can be said of this field as has already been said in reference
to the Hodgkinson and the Palmer?namely, that it has laboured
under the disadvantages which must fall to the lot of all young fields
situated at a distance from the coast and from any large centre of
population. Goode had originally to be carried by horse or bullock
dray, from Normanton to Georgetown, a distance of 200 miles. The


railway to Croydon has been completed for some years past, but still
there is 100 miles of country to be traversed that is often impassable
?owing to the floods in the wet season, and owing to the want of grass
and water at the end of the dry season. The permanent railway
survey of this field is, I believe, completed. I know it was going on
when I was on the field in the year 1895, and I feel sure that when
that railway brings the field into direct communication with the coast
we may look for the settlement of a large mining population and to
the prosperity of the field. With reference to Croydon, which is
another large field in the North-West, this field, as I have
already said, does not come under the same category as those above
mentioned. Here we have a railway connection direct from the
coast, and a population of some 2,500
several lesser mining camps in the district. It is a comparatively late
discovery, and was only proclaimed a goldfield in the year 1886, since
which time it has produced 582,427 ozs. of gold, or a yield of about
58,000 ozs. per annum, or about �150,000 worth of gold per year. My
last work before leaving the colony was to map and report upon this
field in detail, which extends over some 3,685 square miles, though
the actual workings are confined to some 750 square miles. That
report, lam glad to say, is now published. The field is divided geolo-
gically into two distinct parts, one consisting of a metamorphic granite,
in which the best known reefs, such as the Golden Gate, True Blue,
Iguana, Lady Mary, and King and Queen of Croydon are situated; and
the other, which constitutes by far the larger area, is of felsite, con-
taining very many reefs. The reefs are so numerous that I believe that
something like 250 are shown on my map. This great number of reefs
is not an altogether unmixed blessing, you may have too much of a
good thing, and miners are too apt not to trouble about prospecting the
reefs to a depth when there are so many others from which they may
get payable gold with much less trouble nearer the surface. The time
must come when they will have to sink deeper, but that time is de-
layed by the fact that there are so many reefs. I doubt if the reefs
on Charters Towers or Gympie would be worked now at the depth
they are if there had been so many reefs. It is a curious fact that
the gold from the reefs in the felsite is worth nearly �1 an
oz. more than that from the reefs in the granite. It is not
my intention, however, to enter into any further geological
details, but just to refer to it as a field for investment
Here we have a field that has for the last four years, at any rate, had
an output averaging over 70,000 ozs. of gold a year. How is it worked .
First I will quote from the report of the Warden, in which we find
that out of 285 separate holdings, worked in 1895, only 27 used steam
winding gear, and only 50 the ? whip,? and therefore 200, at least,
were worked with the primitive windlass. When 1 was on the field in
the same year, more than half the batteries were stopped for want of
water, so that the stone raised could not possibly be crushed, and this
is the case, lam told, in three out of four years. Only an infinitesimal
proportion of the mines are worked by syndicates and companies, and
these, as a rule, have too small working capital to properly develop
them. The rest are in the hands of individual miners, or parties of
miners, without any capital at all except their muscle, and they
naturally take out the best stone only, and divide the profits, and
when it becomes necessary to do a little prospecting on their reef
they have no money in hand, and are obliged to abandon their
workings. I can assure you that during my examination of the field,
when I went down every claim that was open to inspection, the
majority of them resembled rabbit warrens rather than mines, and one
often wondered how the quartz was raised to the surface. I do not
ior one moment pretend to say that the whole of the reefs are
payable, but the detailed returns of all the reefs attached to my report
show that many of them would pay handsomely if worked on a proper
system. Capital is wanted to make dams, or sink wells in some parts,
to provide permanent water for the mills and also for the systematic


development of the mines. Capital subscribed with that object alone,
without being overloaded by thousands of promoters? shares and such
like, would be profitably invested. (Hear, hear.) I have condensed, as far
as I could, the above short description of these fields, picking out only
what I consider to be the most salient features, and I trust I have not
taken up too much of your time in bringing before you a notice of the
fields from which I anticipate an enormous increase in yield in the
near future. Before I sit down I should like to point out what vast
strides have been made in the general gold mining industry of the
colony in the last few years, and I can do that in a very few figures.
Up to the end of the year 1887, our largest annual yield was 481,000
ozs. of gold, and the average for the seven years previous to that date
was 329,283 ozs., while for the seven succeeding years the average yield
has been 638,546 ozs., or 308,263 ozs. in advance of the previous seven
years. Some of this increase is certainly due to the great Mount Mor-
gan Mine, which started its large output in the year 1886, but of late
years the output of this mine has been, roughly speaking, 120,000 ozs.
a year, still leaving 180,000 ozs., or more than 60 per cent, annual
increase on the previous seven years from the other goldfields of the
colony. These figures show most clearly what vast strides have been
made. For some years Queensland has been second only to Victoria
among the gold-producing colonies of Australia, and once, in the year
1889, she actually beat that colony with a yield of 739,103 ozs. of gold,
and I do not think it is rash to predict that with the undeveloped
fields that Queensland has to fall back upon, the time will not be long
before she permanently takes the foremost position amongst the gold-
producing colonies of Australia. (Applause.)
The Chairman: Does any gentleman wish to make any observation upon
the statements that have been made by Sir Hugh Nelson and Mr. Rands ?
Colonel Josiah Harris : Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, ?Perhaps I am
intruding on you in making a few remarks on the very excellent report
made by Mr. Rands, but I recollect the time when if 500 ozs. of gold
came from the Gold Coast by a trading vessel it was thought something
wonderful. That gold was obtained from the alluvial workings. I
have been connected with mining for the last forty years, and I must
say that the instructive lesson Mr. Rands has given has opened my eyes,
and I hope has opened some of your pockets to invest in Queensland.
All that Mr. Rands has said has confirmed the reports I have heard
myself respecting Queensland, and I think the gentlemen who have
introduced this subject have done a great service to Queensland, as well
as a great service to the Incorporated Australasian Chamber of Mines.
They have ear-marked this Chamber, which has been formed for the
general good, and not for individual purposes. No profits are to be
made by the Chamber, but will be a centre through which information
will be received, not only from Queensland, but from the other colonies,
and through which investors will get true statements and facts which
they do not get now. (Applause.) Independent of that, one of the
objects of the Chamber is shortly to inaugurate a mining exhibition,
and an exhibition of minerals from the different colonies. You will all
doubtless remember that only a few years ago a marvellous exhibition
of mining machinery, &c., took place at the Crystal Palace, which
gave a great impulse to both mechanical and scientific contrivances
for the extraction of gold. Therefore, one of the objects of the Incor-
porated Australasian Chamber of Mines will be to foster an institution
of instruction in regard to the exhibition of machinery and metals.
Although we cannot expect the colonies to support this institution by
money, we do look to them to support us by giving us necessary
information which we may disseminate throughout England. Not
only that, but we, on our part, will be able, after receiving that informa-
tion, and having our offices open for the inspection of these documents,
to give satisfaction to those who choose to apply to the Chamber for
instruction. It is a great satisfaction to us to see Sir Hugh Nelson
here, considering the wonderful festivities which he has taken part in
lately. I trust that he will carry back with him pleasurable remem-


trances of tis visit, and that at the same time he will recollect,,
when he returns to the colony of Queensland, that there is a Chamber
here to which he may, with the greatest confidence, send valuable
information which will be for the great benefit of Queensland, and
also for the other colonies which have likewise promised to give us
information, and the general mining interests of the world. (Applause.)-
Mr. Oscar de Satge : As one of the older colonists of Queensland, I
should like to take a small part in this meeting by confirming what
has fallen from the Government Geologist of Queensland, and stating a
little of my early experiences as regards mining in Queensland. I can
only say that it is not confined to gold. I could give you a little of my
early experience in 1861 when I went up to Peak Down. The Copptsr-
field Copper Mine was then found and developed by the Messrs. Manton,.
and by the use of Sydney capital within the 8 or 9 years that followed,
some �150,000 of copper was taken out of the Copperfield, Since that
time the Clermont Goldfield has been developed, and with Mr. Rands?
permission, I might draw his attention to the alluvial gold mining
which is going on there. It is quite a new thing, and it bids fair to
develop into a first rate alluvial field. Now, the great benefit of
Queensland has been that hitherto it has been a quartz reef, and has
required the use of permanent machinery which has settled to some
extent a population on the land. Mr. Rands has appealed feelingly
to the capital and to the population required to develop the goldfields,,
which are excellent now, and seem to yield an average of over 2 ozs. to
the ton, and which are not difficult to work, and only require water.
Now, the conditions of Queensland are very different to those of
Western Australia. Western Australia has a better climate as regards
the heat, and it lies nearer to the centre of population. In the wide-
spread goldfields of the northern part of Queensland there is
a very great difficulty in getting goods to enable the
population there to live in a comfortable manner. There is
no doubt that at the present moment Queensland has got-
not only gold, but copper and silver ?for instance, the Pikedale Silver
Mine; in fact, the future of Queensland in that respect is enormous.
I hope to see this Associated Chamber of Mines affording a great deal
of support to the mining industry of Queensland. I have near me a
gentleman who is largely interested in mines, and I recognise amongst
the audience one from whom I should like to hear some expression of
his enormous experiences?namely, Mr. Hugh Mosman, one of the
discoverers of Charters Towers. (Applause.) A few of his early expe-
riences of that field would be extremely interesting, I am sure, whilst
he is in London. It is not very often that Mr. Mosman visits England,
and if he will state his experiences of those fields, they will, I am sure,
be very interesting. The fact of the matter is, the possibilities of
Queensland are enormous. Gold is found almost everywhere. When
I went out in 1888 I found 1,200 ozs. of coarse alluvial gold in the
Queensland National Bank at Cloncurry. I brought back some speci-
mens of gold, and they were thought by all who saw them to point to
an enormous future. 1 may say that Cloncurry was pointed out by
the Rev. W. B. Clarke, one of the earliest mineral prophets of
Australia, to be a place at which all kinds of minerals centred, and I
may tell you that I could see from the top of the copper mine
glistening mountains or hills of iron ore. It has been proved that at.-
that point there is a hill absolutely containing over 50 per cent, of iron
ore close to Cloncurry. We hope that Sir Hugh Nelson will some
time or other push on the railway to Cloncurry in the same way that
the Croydon Railway has been built; in fact, the Croydon Railway
was built with the money that ought to have gone to Cloncurry. I
believe that if the railway had been made to Cloncurry developments
almost equal to those at Croydon would have taken place there. I
speak feelingly because some friends of mine and myself had some
very large pastoral interests at the back of Cloncurry, which, of course,
would have been developed by the population that the railway would
naturally attract. The future possibilities of Queensland in the way


not only of gold, but of silver and copper, are enormous. As for
Mount Morgan, that wonderful field that I have ridden beneath long
before it was found out?why, there may be hundreds of Mount
Morgans in Queensland still. There is room enough for them. No
one has explained the nature of the deposits that have brought about
Mount Morgan. There was the Canoona alluvial goldfield, near Rock-
hampton, and they seem to have been traced up to the deposits at
Mount Morgan, 30 miles away. My life has been spent in pastoral
development, but it is impossible for any squatter living for any length
of time in Queensland to ignore the enormous assistance he receives
from the mining industry. I know that I never could have got down
to Peak Down in the early days had not the Copperfield Copper Mine
been opened and found me labour. (Applause.)
Mr. Ross Robinson: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, ?1 see my friend
Mr. Mosman does not seem inclined to rise, therefore, I will occupy
your time for a little. I wish to say that I have been extremely
pleased by the manner in which the goldfields of Queensland have been
brought before the English public this afternoon by Mr. Rands. I
think it is likely to result in a great deal of good. Up to two or three
days ago I might perhaps have said that I know better than
any man in England the nature and capabilities of the fields
that he has talked about, but since the arrival of Mr. Mosman
lam obliged to take a second place. I have visited all the mines that
have been referred to by Mr. Rands. I have lived upon some of them
for a considerable length of time, and I know that they contain vast
possibilities, and it is very probable that with a proper outlay of capital
they would be highly productive. But I want this meeting to be of
some practical use, and, in order that it may be so, 1 will take the oppor-
tunity, as the Premier of the colony of Queensland is here, of telling
him that it depends a great deal upon the Government of Queensland
whether capital is attracted to the colony from England or not.
(Applause.) I was one of the deputation from the Chamber which
waited upon the Attorney-General of Queensland, Mr. Thomas Byrnes,
the other day, and laid before him what we conceived to be the
grievances of mine owners and investors in England with regard to the
mining laws, pointing out the alterations that ought to be made. I did
that as a practical man. I think those who know me will acknow-
ledge that I knew what I .was talking about, because I have had
something like 25 years? experience. lam glad to hear that Sir Hugh
Nelson thinks favourably of some of the things which I suggested on
that occasion, but there are many other points that he has not yet
touched on. I sincerely hope that what I suggested to the Attorney-
General the other day will be carried out. I believe they will be by
the Commission which is now sitting in Queensland, and to which Sir
Hugh has alluded. I think the time has now arrived when it is no
longer a question of capital only. The mining people generally have
come to the conclusion that larger areas must be held by the capitalists
in order to induce them to put capital in, that the labour conditions
must be less rigorous, and that many other alterations in favour of
capital should be made. In connection with the Mining Commission,
to which reference has been made, I was particularly struck with the
working miners that waited upon the commission from one of the
camps in one of the fields to which Mr. Rands has alluded?l mean
the Hodgkinson. The working miners of that field said, ?We have our
property lying here idle, and nobody gets any benefit out of it, for
the reasons that the areas are not large enough and the labour
conditions too vigorous.? We are told that it is highly profitable,
but at the present time no one gets anything out of it. Now,
there must be a reason for that. One of the principal reasons is
that the area is not large enough. Before you can get people in Eng-
land to invest their capital you must first of all give them a large area
and liberal labour conditions, and, more than anything else, you must
give them better security of title. (Hear, hear.) At the present time
in the colony of Queensland a mining lease is absolutely at the dis-


posal of the Minister of Mines. I say that that is a wrong state of
things. Every man ought to have the right to appeal to the judges of
the country wherever he is. That is one of the things which I think
is most essential. That the capabilities of Queensland are very great
there is no doubt, hut there is yet another thing that is wanted. The
Premier has told you that the principal reason for the decline
in the silver industry is the diminution in the price of silver. That is
quite true, but I know at least one very large silver mine in Queensland
with which I was closely connected ?the Mount Albion?which would
be working to-day, employing hundreds of men, and perhaps thousands
profitably if it had a railway. Railways are one of the great things
that are wanted in Queensland at the present time, and if that railway
had been constructed, I have no hesitation in saying that that property
would be working to-day. There are many other mines in that district
?tin mines, copper mines, and silver mines?which would, I think, he
working also. We have been told that they have a railway to the
Croydon district. It is quite true, but the Croydon district is at least
250 miles from the place to which I am alluding now, and it is 100
miles from the centre of the Etheridge Goldfields, Georgetown. There
are scores of mines in that district which would be working to-day if
larger areas were granted, and if railways were constructed. I hope
that the Premier will take notice of what is being said. I know that
if he consults his mining authorities when he returns to Queensland
they will bear out what I say. I feel very much indebted to Mr. Rand
for the very explicit statement he has made in connection with the
mines, and I hope that Mr. Mosman will rise and say a word or two as
one of the pioneer miners of Queensland. (Applause.)
The Hon. Hugh Mosman: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen, ?I have
heard what Sir Hugh Nelson has stated, that he is inclined to listen to
any suggested alteration in the mining laws, and to consider any
alteration that may be proposed in the regulations with regard to
the mining interests. From what I know of the Premier and the other
Minister of Queensland, I feel perfectly certain that they will carry out
to the best of their ability any suggested improvements, and bring in
force an Act suitable for the miners and the capitalists, in the interests
of mining generally, both silver, gold, copper, and iron, if it is found
profitable enough. With regard to Mr. Rands? statement on the dif-
ferent goldfields, I can endorse everything he states?(hear, hear) ?
because I have been in the colony for over 30 years. I am an old miner,
and know all about mining, having started as a prospector and having
been the leader of the party who discovered Charters Towers. (Applause.)
I have had interests in that goldfield and other goldfields in Queens-
land for 30 years, so that I know something about the subject. With
regard to the goldfields to which Mr. Rands has referred, I am perfectly
certain with the introduction of capital, now that they are more easily
get-at-able than they were in the early days, they
will turn out very profitable investments as far as mining
is concerned, and will support a good population and benefit
Hie country as well as the Government indirectly. I do not think I
need give you my experiences in gold mining; it would take up a lot of
time, extending as it does over 30 years, hut I can assure you that
when I started we had to live a very rough-and-tumble kind of life. We
had to put up with a great many inconveniences, and it also took a
great deal of money for the necessaries of life. Carriage was
very high, and machinery was very difficult to get. We had
to make the roads in very many instances ourselves, but now things are
different in most of the well-known goldfields, and no doubt those
outside places will, in due course, be opened up by a continuation of
the present railway; and when that takes place I feel sure that capital
invested in the mines in those particular districts will return very good
interest. (Applause.)
Mr. J. Lowles, M.P. : Sir James Garrick and Gentlemen, ?I have
been entrusted by the Chamber with the very pleasurable task of
a vote of thanks to Sir Hugh Nelson for his attendance here


to-day, and to Mr. Rands for his very able and instructive address. I
am quite sure you will allow me, in your name, to ask Sir Hugh to-
believe that the importance of this meeting must be measured not
by its quantity, but by its quality. We have several competing objects
to-day. There is Henley, and this magnificent weather, and last but
not least, it is Australian mail day, and busy men are,_ of course, tied
to their correspondence before the mail closes. I think I ought to
mention that we are specially indebted to Sir Hugh, who was on his
way or would have been on his way to Scotland, but for the fact that
he came back from Warwick last night in order to be present to-day,
and resumes his journey to-morrow. (Applause.) Of course the-
Chamber, under whose auspices this meeting is held, is indebted to Sir
Hugh Nelson for coming here, but I feel quite sure that his presence
here will be as useful to the colonies of Australia as it will be, I hope,
to the home investor. You have heard from Colonel Harris that this
Chamber is incorporated under that section of the Companies Acts
which prevents it earning a profit. It is intended to be a medium
between capitalists here and owners of property on the other side, and
I hope it will also be a channel through which reliable information may
be obtained of the resources of these great colonies. It was my
privilege last year to spend some time in Australasia, and I came back
impressed with the scant knowledge that I before possessed, and with
the much scantier knowledge of people at home, of the mighty
resources of this great colony on the other side. I feel sure that if our
people at home knew more of the illimitable resources of our great
colonies they would not require to look out for new fields for invest-
ment, but would benefit the Empire, the mother country, and the
colonies by confining their investments to those colonies. Of course,.
I know there are many people who shake their heads when you talk
about mining. I did it myself until my son became a mining engineer,
and I began to take more interest in the subject. Of course, mining
must always be more or less speculative, because you cannot see into-
the bowels of the earth. These metallurgical deposits are themselves-
inexplicable freaks of nature, but I venture to think that the specula-
tive side of mining may be very much minimised, and that it will take-
its place, and I hope soon, as a legitimate industry?as a legitimate
source of profit to those who invest in it, by more care being taken in
the information supplied, by'the sources of that information being
absolutely beyond suspicion, and by more interest being evinced in the
management of these properties when they are taken over. I believe
this Australasian Chamber of Mines is going to do some good in
that direction. Of course, I know that the bulk does not always-
come up to the sample. We have sometimes had dazzling speci-
mens brought over here, and, I believe, been misled by them.
I remember reading once in that very racy organ, The
Sydney Bulletin , of one of two mates who came over with about 2 cwt..
of samples in order to sell a mine, and he sold it, the samples were so
magnificent. He then cabled to his mate to begin crushing, and the
reply came back, ? How the dickens can I begin crushing until you
send back the reef ? ? (Laughter.) Instances of that kind do occur,,
but I believe that with improved knowledge, with sources of
information on which reliance can be placed, an enormous impetus
will be given to legitimate investment in mining industries, and, of
course, to the development of the mining resources of the colonies.
Where, sir, do you think Queensland would have been to-day but for
its Mount Morgan and its Charters Towers? Where would New South
Wales be but for its Broken Hill, and where would Victoria be but for
its Ballarat, and Western Australia but for its Coolgardie ? When we
consider the enormous development that has taken place in Western
Australia entirely owing to the discovery of gold, we see how other
industries, of a more sober kind, perhaps? pastoral and agricultural?
depend in the first place on the impetus given by the goldfields. There-
fore, I say, if we needed any apology or justification for taking this
interest in mining?in trying to redeem it from the discredit into


which it has sometimes fallen, and bring it into its proper place as a
legitimate industry capable of being so handled as to produce on the
average something like certain results, I say we are doing good to the
community, and I venture to say we are doing good to all the
colonies concerned. (Applause.) From that point of view I venture
as one interested, owing to my visit to Australia, to
express the belief that this Chamber of Mines is calcu-
lated to supply a long - felt want. I am sure you will
allow me to ask you to join with me, even if it is apart from the imme-
diate duty laid upon me, in wishing long life, prosperity, and good
health to this Australasian Chamber of Mines. But to come back to
the task which I have the privilege of fulfilling?that of tendering a very
hearty vote of thanks to Sir Hugh Nelson and Mr. Rands ?one does not
care to single out one particular colony, but I would like to say that
Queensland has the reputation, even amongst her sister colonies on
the other side, of being careful and painstaking in her Government
departments. ('Applause.) When I was in Western Australia, there
was a vacancy in the office of Government Geologist, owing to the
retirement of Mr. Woodward. I had met in Queensland when I was
there the Assistant Geologist, Mr. Gibb Maitland, and I ventured to
mention his name to the Minister of Mines in Perth. He was so
satisfied, when he examined his credentials, with his capacity and with
the valuable experience he had gained in Queensland under the Mines
Department, that he at once selected him from a large number of appli-
cants to take the important post of Geologist of Western Australia.
That, I think, was a tribute to the care which Queensland takes not
merely in the selection but in the training of her expert men ; and I
venture to say that while we have undoubted confidence both in the
distinguished Premier who is here to-dav, and in his colleagues in the
Ministry, we have also confidence in the men they employ, because we
know how careful they are in selecting men to give expert
information, upon which we must so largely rely. I venture again
in a very hearty way to express to Sir Hugh Nelson our great
indebtedness to him for being here to-day, and our thanks to Mr.
Rands for the able paper he has read before us, and I hope Mr.
Rands? visit to this country will be productive of considerable good.
I venture myself as representing a large industrial constituency to ask
him if he will come down and talk to my people, as I have often done,
in order to tell them what beautiful places Queensland and the
colonies are, and what an unlimited scope they give for remunerative
employment for honest labour, and how much stimulus they give to
industry. When I was in West Australia, owing to the enormous impetus
given to the demand for produce by the gold industry, unmarried
agricultural labourers in the house were getting 30s. a week and
their food, while married men out of the house were getting �3 a week
and a house to live in. If this institution did nothing else but bring
these facts before the public, I consider we should be under a deep
obligation to it, and I think from that and every other point of view we
ought to welcome any legitimate institution such as this, under whose
auspices we have met to-day, which is destined, I believe, to bring
about such good results. (Applause.)
The Hon. H. S. Littleton : May I rise, as an old colonist, to endorse
what has fallen from the last speaker, and to second the resolution he
has placed before the meeting ?
The Chairman: Ido not think that there can be the slightest doubt,
from what we have heard from Sir Hugh Nelson and Mr. Rands, of the
auriferous wealth of the colony of Queensland; and I think we must
also arrive at this conclusion, as I stated in the opening, that the local
enterprise and capital are insufficient for the development of that
wealth. It is quite clear from what Mr. Rands has told us, that mines
of the greatest value apparently have been abandoned for want of money.
What we have to do is to place before the public here reliable information
as stated, accurate information, which I hope will be supplied by this
Chamber of Mines. There is a difference, as we know, between a mine


.and a prospecting claim. If a person comes to you with a mine you
know it contains payable gold, and there is some way of estimating
its value ; but when a man comes to you with a property which is a
prospecting property, really there is the greatest difficulty in the
world, with reports of managers and people of that kind, of estimating
the value of the property which is submitted to you. As soon as some
fancy price is put upon the property, there comes the question, how
much of this money collected from the people of the country is to go
into the working expenses in the colonies ? (Hear, hear.) I have felt
in my short experience of these matters the want of that information
which has been alluded to to-day, and I hope this institution will
: supply that want. I think it is a great deal to hear from Sir Hugh
Nelson that he entirely appreciates the purpose for which this
Chamber has been started, and if he will give to this institution all the
publications and materials at the disposal of his Government for the
information of the people on this side, he will be doing us a good
service. Now, one often hears the question raised, is the acreage
sufficient for the capitalists, and are the labour conditions sufficient
for the capitalists? and it is pleasant to hear from Sir Hugh
that he is quite ready to consider these questions. Ido not
think any Government can afford to overlook the importance
of the mining industry. I have known Sir Hugh to rescue
Queensland at least twice from a time of severe depression?(hear,
hear) ?and throughout all the history of Queensland he has stood
behind that colony and its mining industry as being one of its greatest
interests, following only next after the greatest of all?the pastoral
industry. It is impossible, then, for any Government, in view of the
vast importance of the mining industry to the colony of Queensland
in view of the great competition which is constantly taking place to
draw capital and people to other colonies ?it is impossible for any
Government to stand idle and refuse to consider those conditions which
the capitalists can reasonably place before the Government to induce
capital and people to the colony, and I am quite sure that Sir Hugh
Nelson?s Government will afford that which you reasonably ask.
<(Applause.) Now, gentlemen, with those few remarks, allow me to add
to what has fallen from the other speakers my thanks to Sir Hugh
Nelson for what he has done to-day. He has done what I consider will
not be one of the least of the' services he has performed during his visit
to this country. (Applause.) I will also add my thanks to Mr. Rands
for the information he has given us.
The vote of thanks was then passed with acclamation.
Sir Hugh Nelson : I cannot help rising to express my cordial thanks
to the meeting for the vote of thanks which they have accorded. I can
only add to what I stated before ?that the sole object of the Govern-
ment when they take people out to the colony is to make those people
prosperous, and, when we get capital to the colony, to ensure, as far as
we can, that it gets its due reward. If we do that I think we will be
able to conduct the colony on sound principles. I thank you very
much indeed for the way in which you have received me, and I have
no hesitation in expressing my confident opinion that this Chamber of
Mines will be of immense mutual advantage both to the colonies and
to the mother country. (Applause.)
Mr. W. H. Rands: Gentlemen, I must thank you all very much for
the very kind manner in which you have spoken of the few words I had
to say. I am perfectly satisfied that what I have said about the
?colony of Queensland is true, and I thank you all again very much.
The Hon T. Macdonald-Paterson : Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentle-
men, ?It affords me very great pleasure to be the instrument to propose
a vote of thanks to our worthy chairman, Sir James Garrick, for pre-
siding here on this most important occasion. (Applause.) Important it
will be to many of us in Queensland, and more important still, I think,
in purifying the mining speculative atmosphere that has hitherto ruled
too much in London. I am glad that I have had the opportunity of
being here this afternoon if only to come into contact with so many old


colonists, other than those whom I have known intimately in Queens-
land during a period of 36 years, and more particularly that I should
have the privilege of proposing a vote of thanks to the chairman this
afternoon, Sir James Garrick, with whom I had the great honour and
privilege of sitting in the Legislative halls of Queensland for many
years. lam therefore able to testify to his many excellent qualities,
but particularly to one great quality?that of loyalty to the Colony of
Queensland where he resided so long, where his children were born, and
where he has still one of the prettiest homes in the suburbs of the
capital of the Colony. I know that his great quality is loyalty to
that country in all its branches of industry, and also from a
political aspect, which he adorned unquestionably for many years..
But the position that he has adorned most, and which has
given him a standing with us old colonists, is the position
of Agent-General, an office which he has occupied for so many years,
with great credit to himself and advantage to our country. (Hear v
hear.) Without reflecting on any previous holder of the office, and
certainly not on Sir Henry Norman, it is my duty to say that the whole
of Queensland believes that they have in the gentleman who has pre-
sided over this meeting, if not the best, at least one of the best Agent-
Generals that has ever represented the colony in the old country. I
will now pass from that topic, and without desiring to put a grain of
sand between the teeth of any person here present, I wish to say that.
I do not agree with one speaker, Mr. He Satgd, who observed that the.
Queensland fields were much more scattered than the Western
Australian fields. Everyone knows that the latter colony has a larger
territory than Queensland, and that the fields there just represent
about what our fields were many years ago. It is a far cry from Mur-
chison right down to Kalgoorlie or Coolgardie, but there is one point on
which I wish particularly to say that he was slightly incorrect, viz., in
asserting that Western Australia had a better climate than Queens-
land. (Hear, hear.) Now, I had the pleasure and honour of travelling?
with some West Australians who are present here in the room this-
afternoon, and one of the conversations brought out this observation :
? Mac, if we only had your beautful harbours and rivers, and, above all,,
if we only had your rainfall and your climate.? That is concurred in
by all West Australians, and particularly by those who have been in
Queensland. lam sure my respected and old friend Mr. De Satgb will
not take umbrage if I say that the climate of Queensland is at least as
good as that of Western Australia. With these observations I trust
that you will give by hearty acclamation a cordial vote of thanks to
your chairman, Sir James Garrick, for presiding.
The motion was cordially adopted.
The Chairman: Gentlemen, I need not say that I thank you very
much indeed for the kind manner in which you have responded to the
motion made by my old friend, Mr. Macdonald-Paterson. It is a long
time since I heard his voice, and it reminds me of old days when we
stood shoulder to shoulder ?sometimes not shoulder to shoulder, but
nearly always?in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. It recalls,
many pleasant reminiscences. Allow me to thank you again, and
remark that I am greatly delighted, and I may say honoured, by
having the privilege of taking a part, no matter how small, in the
endeavour to bring before the people of this country a knowledge of
the wealth of Queensland. (Applause.)
The proceedings then terminated.
