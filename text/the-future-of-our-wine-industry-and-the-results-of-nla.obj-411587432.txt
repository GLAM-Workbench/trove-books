PREFACE.
Both the Victorian and the South Australian Governments have, soni6
years ago, issued Handbooks on Viticulture, but neither of these has dealt
with the important subject of manuring the vineyards. I determined, there-
fore, to obtain as much information as possible from Australian vignerons who
had tried manures as a desirable supplement. Before giving these reports,
I furnish also others from European sources, that may be valuable as a
hint, where there is yet so much uncertainty and so little Australian
experience that can be fully relied on, or so positive and instructive as t
had hoped. How to develop your vineyard, so as to obtain the largest
yields without injury to the quality of the wine, and at the lowest cost, is
too important a matter to be left undecided much longer. Whatever
information I have collected on these points should be of some value to
our vinegrowers, and lead them to make their own observations. After a
number of trials, and a cycle of years, final conclusions may be reached.
To make these experiments Australian vignerons need an incitement; hit
or miss methods are, however, seldom satisfactory. This is now given by
this pamphlet, and, since I wrote it, by the excellent paper lately read by
our viticulturist, Professor Perkins, before the South Australian Vine-
growers’ Association. He has taken, to some extent, the wind out of my
sails ; but the information I give is somewhat different, and from other
sources, and therefore supplementing the above paper. The great
divergence in the opinions of the several experts, which my readers will
find in the following pages, will after all be of some benefit, as it will lead
to independent investigation. Those pages dealing with manurial treat-
ment of diseases and of phylloxera will also be found interesting. I have,
since I finished my pamphlet, received further information, which I have
added in the form of three appendices; also, twelve blocks for plates,
which show clearly the of full or partial manuring, kindly sent to
me by the German Kali Works and the Thomas Phosphate Union.

THE FUTURE OF OUR WINE INDUSTRY.
Jpßf|ipw|HlLE all admit the special adaptability of the soil and climate of
(South Australia to vinegrowing, and it is gratifying to notice that
our export of wines did lately increase year by year, while it is
probable that the actual quantity exported is considerably in excess
°f the figures given by the Customs Department, it seems also as if
"vAKT ’ our wine industry, as was prophesied by myself and many other old
vinegrowers, had again received a check similar to the one about 1865.
At the former time there was no market, either abroad or in the colony, for the
quantity of immature and frequently badly-made wine by inexperienced hands.
Now, after the forced increase in the acreage of newly-planted vineyards, there
is a difficulty to find a paying market, except for the very best varieties of grapes,
or for the young must. The reason for this is the want of cellarage and capital
to purchase large quantities with a view of keeping the wine some years and
blending it to a uniform type, which can be supplied year after year. Of course
a few of our vignerons do this to a limited extent, and have been able to supply
50,000 or 100,000 gallons of a fairly uniform type to customers abroad ; but for
all that it is quite true what Mr. G. Sutherland says in his book, “ The South
Australian Company” : —“ It is a great pity that more of our own people in
South Australia don’t have their capital free for putting into things that will
benefit the producer. At the very time when outside capital was urgently
needed for the building of cellarage, or for setting free local capital to go towards
the same object, it suddenly became the adopted national policy to discourage
the flow of investment from England.’ And while vignerons in a better season
than the last may say to the owner of a winery “ For goodness sake take my crop
of grapes !” the reply too often has been, “ I cannot store another gallon ! In
fact it is the same state of things here, and also in \ ictoria and New South
Wales, as is mentioned by Signor Cerletti in his “ Descriptive Account of the
Wine Industry of Italy” of Sardinia in 1887 “ Large establishments for pre-
paring wines for exportation do not exist, and, the trade in them being without
organisation, the wines are depreciated by the abundance of the surplus, although
they possess qualities which, if proper organisation existed, would claim for them
a splendid future and large sale. If the must from the small vignerons were at
once bought, the great variations in the flavor could be prevented. Now wines
sell lower than their good qualities merit, at from 9 to 18 lires per hectolitre (22
gallons), while on the contrary special wines command from 80 to 100, and even
150 lires per hectolitre.” It is a national calamity if many more of our young
vineyards are uprooted. This was the case about 1865, and the same course has


been lately followed by not a few of the smaller proprietors of vineyards. The
Government and the Parliament have, a few years ago, encouraged the planting
of these vineyards. The natural consequence is now that the cellarage must be
found. I have supported, and have nothing to say against the London Depot;
but it is, and was, of as great importance to provide cellarage in South Australia,
and the same in the other colonies, as to hire it on the docks of London. Our
Depot, under the care of Mr. Young, has, and is still, opening up markets for our
matured wines, by actually claiming the support of 500 new wholesale buyers,
and of Messrs. Spiers & Pond ; but unless the State here, and also in the other
colonies, assists to keep up a supply of these, our inability to meet the demand
which is likely to be made for them will make the efforts of Mr. Young, and
of others for the other colonies, useless. Once disappointed in obtaining again
what a purchaser was induced to try, he will turn to other brands, and perhaps
never change again. Our output of these matured wines of uniform type must
steadily increase, and not remain even stationary for a few years It is no small
praise from a firm like P. B. Burgoyne & Co when they say “The Australian
Avine industry is no weakling that requires special nursing, it needs no molly-
coddling, or leading strings. There is a force behind it which is fast raising it
to the level of the foremost wine countries of the world but at another time
he “ regrets ever and ever again that he is unable to get as much of the necessary
standard excellence as he would take and could easily sell.” And what shall we
say if now already Mr Young advises, “ that at times during the year nearly
every mark, except recent arrivals, has been sold out, and for a while we had to
hold over orders for particular wines.” Such a firm as Blandy Brothers & Co.
point out the paramount importance of sending over wines that are fully matured,
not green. Mr. Bagenal also, of Pownalls & Co., says that slightly sweet wines
forwarded will develop lactic acid, and when put on the market will be a disgrace
to Australia. Mr. Young has been actually obliged to sell by auction such green,
or unsuitable wines. Although sold at very low prices, they are sure not to
improve the sale of our better wines ; they were sold as “ Australian wine” after
all. We all recollect what a bad name “ Colonial wine” had in former years,
and how difficult it was afterwards to overcome the prejudice here when later on
good wines were produced.
South Australia has not too many products upon which our province can rely
that we can afford to neglect the most promising—the wine industry. If private
enterprise, repeatedly applied to, is either unable or unwilling to establish large
cellars under able manipulators, the State should guarantee for some years a low
rate of interest to any Company, or else erect cellars, and let them at a low rental
to any firm or company bound to purchase large quantities of the young wine.
This gives a chance of realising soon after a vintage at a paying rate, and by
blending the Company may send matured and uniform wines to England. It
will not interfere with our winegrowers, who have already a connection for their
wines in England or elsewhere. They can only gain by it if Australian wine is
widely known, and distributed as a reliable, pure, and wholesome beverage And
even these vignerons, in all parts of Australia, who have made a name for their
wines, have fairly large areas under vines, and purchase as many grapes as their
cellarage and capital allow, may derive a direct benefit from such establishments,
to which they may sell such of their young wines which may not be suitable for
the particular wine they can always sell, and of which they make hardly sufficient
of the same type.


GENERAL REMARKS.
I prefaced the foregoing as most necessary for the class of winegrowers who
must have an immediate sale for their grapes or their young wine, they being
unable to keep it for years, and are not sufficiently conversant with its manu-
facture to produce even then a good wine; but I dedicate the following pages to
all winegrowers of Australia,
So far as I am aware the average number of gallons pressed from our better
wine grapes is much below what is calculated upon in fair seasons in most other
countries with a similar climate that produce medium wines. Many of our wines
may be taken to be superior to the bulk of similar classes produced in Europe;
but after all, we cannot yet boast of equalling the very finest wines. Many
vignerons, who have not planted their vineyards on the richest flats, are afraid of
injuring the flavor of their wine if they try to increase their crops of grapes by
manure, either animal or mineral, although they are well aware that they might
grow on the same area a great many more grapes at a comparatively small
increase in the cost by manuring it. But Professor Perkins, of Roseworthy
College, says in his paper on “Manuring of Vines,” read on the 24th of March
before the South Australian vignerons, “ I suspect that the quality of wines is to
a greater extent dependent on local climate and the physical condition of the soil
than on the relative richness in nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potassium oxide.
We claim little quality and moderate prices for our wines, and in which the
relative fertility of the soil, natural or artificial, can have but moderate influence.
The advisability of adopting the practice of manuring will be solely dependent
on the likelihood of its ensuring increased yields at low rates of expenditure.”
The old dogma, taken for granted, that manures would give to the wine
objectionable qualities of taste and aroma, is not now persisted in elsewhere so
long as the farmyard dung is applied as a compost, except by M. Thezard, and
although in Australia but few experiments have been made, and perhaps not
enough to disprove it, those made in France and elsewhere, recorded in these
pages, will doubtless induce many to go in for manuring. And if they still hold
to the opinion that stable dung is not advisable to use, what possible objection
can they have to the mineral fertilisers? If they use them, they will soon
observe in ordinary seasons a marked improvement in the growth of the canes,
and the size of the berries; of course all the more so where the vineyards are
not planted on the richest soil, and have borne already many crops. Our
periodical droughts force us to try to obtain most vigorous growth, not merely
to prevent our vines from dying from exhaustion. Professor Perkins says in his
report of 1897-8, to the Hon. the Minister of Agriculture, that “ If we deduct
the comparatively large sum of £10 per acre for cultivation, manures, cost of
manufacture, interest on land, and buildings, &c., grape-growing leaves yet a net
profit varying from £9 to £15 per acre with a yield of 2 tons of grapes per acre,
or about 250 gallons sold at the cellars at from Is. 6d. to 2s. per gallon.” But I
am not satisfied with 250 gallons, and personally obtained before 1864 at the rate
of 400 gallons per acre in the Bugle Ranges, while my father-in-law, Mr. L.
Fischer, produced still more for many years. The vines were planted in by no
means strong, or rich soil ; for many it was not trenched. Where trenched,
straw was spread at the bottom of the trenches, and the only manure used at the
time was the husks and lees. Most of the red wine was made from Mataro,
Carignan and Shiraz mixed, which made a palatable wine, and sold well. It was


virgin soil, however, and tenants found afterwards that they could not make the
vineyard pay, through want of attention, ignorance of manufacture, and probably
exhaustion of the soil. M. Thezard speaks actually of 150 hectolitres (22-
gallons each) and more per hectare (24 acres), but 9 hogsheads, or about 600
"aliens, is by no means an unusual yield per acre in France, and in the southern
departments the average, according to Muntz, seems to be 1,021 gallons per acre.
F. T. Bioletti, 8.5., says of the San Joaquin Valley, California, that the vines at
the Experimental Station have probably never really overborne, though some
varieties have yielded as high as at the rate of 14 tons per acie; but the soil is
very rich, and contains a large amount of saltpetre.
Before entering now upon my task to marshal numerous reports from Europe
before you, where manures have led to extraordinary fruitfulness, and no
apparent deterioration in the wine, I will refer first to general remarks made by
experts. Professor Perkins, in his report on manuring, speaks of the absolute
necessity to select a fertile soil, even a heavy soil, in South Australia, compared
with the poorer hill slopes, upon which the finest wines are often grown in wet
countries. It is the stronger plant that bears the better fruit, although the
relatively weaker plant proves in a good soil and a favorable season the most
profitable. Luxuriant growth and poverty of soil are incompatible. A rich,
loose, sandy soil, seated on a good bottom, will give here the best results poor
limestone rubble of mallee country is absolutely useless for wine-making
purposes.” Signor Cerletti also says of some parts of Italy, where droughts are
not unusual : —“ Although not so fine, the wines obtained from the rich soil of
the valleys of Liguria are good. In Puglia, an extensive, fertile plain, only a
few metres above the Adriatic, and one of the driest districts in Italy, vines have
more recently been planted, and have given ever since abundant crops of grapes
without the aid of manure of any kind ; but, on the other hand, the extensive
culture of the vine in the Abruzzi Mountains, with a less fertile, shallower soil,
manuring with green crops is general. Where manures are given in Sicily the
production increases, but the greater portion, planted in the plains, never re-
ceived manure since very remote times, and still produce good crops. We
must assume that these plains contain unusual quantities of potash in a volcanic
soil, or that the soil has a granite origin, which renders it capable of yielding for
so many years good crops ; for it is a well-known fact that potash, which is
present in comparatively large quantities in granite rocks, is the most important
fertilising element for the vine, especially in relation to the production of fruit.
Signor Corletti seems also to favor the planting of vines in sandy soil, as along
the coast of the province of Rom, which gives the further advantage of making it
impossible for the phylloxera to do any damage.
In a lecture by Mr. J. J. Willis before the Royal Horticultural Society of
London in April, 1898, I find that “one ton of grapes of 2,240 lbs. contains 363
lbs. of dry substance, 20 lbs of mineral matter, 3£ lbs. of nitrogen, 10 lbs. of
potash, 3 lbs. of phosphoric acid, and 205 lbs. of sugar, while a ton of vine leaves
had 829 lbs. of dry substance, 93 lbs. of ash, 1 1 lbs. of nitrogen, 6 lbs. of potash,
1 lb. of phosphoric acid, and 40 lbs. of sugar. In the stem was found 981 lbs. of
dry substance, 40 lbs of ash, lbs. of nitrogen, 4 lbs. of potash, 14 lbs. of phos-
phoric acid, and 9 lbs. of sugar. The fruit is, therefore, essentially a sugar pio-
ducer, and it, as well as the sugar in them, is greatly increased by the amount of
nitrogen available. Sulphate of ammonia proved very beneficial both for the
color of the skin and the sweetness of the grapes, but in any ease there must not


be a lack of potash and phosphoric acid in the soil ” And to return to the soil
an equivalent for what has been withdrawn from it by successive crops of grapes
is all the more required where —a course that has been extensively followed fields
have been planted here with vines without previous manuring and that proved
themselves already to be more or less exhausted by constant cropping with
cereals, especially wheat. It must be admitted that there is still in most cases a
large amount of fertility even in such wheat-sick soils; but it is a slow process
by which fresh plant-food is formed, and such a change—not to say rotation —as
a permanent crop like vines, can only succeed for a very short time, if at all,
without a supply of at once available plant-food being added by man. And vines
require more than most other plants a large surplus of plant-food. It is fully
understood by all vignerons that, although the main-roots of vines penetrate the
soil to a considerable depth, they have comparatively few branch-roots, which
however may spread laterally up to 12, and in some soils to 21 feet in depth—but
these come after all only with a small portion of the soil into contact, so that they
cannot fully utilise the plant-food, which may be distributed in it. Unless you
manure therefore —as you may think in excess of requirements —it may, and pro-
bably will occur —that according to Baron von Liebig's law of the minimum,
notwithstanding a large dose of say 200 cwt per acre of stable manure had been
given, your vineyard may hunger after phosphoric acid and potash, and the
quality of the grapes will be poor. A medium crop absorbs at least .12 lbs. and a
full crop 40 lbs. of phosphoric acid. Professor Wagner (see Appendix) states that
100 litres (I litre somewhat more than 11 pints), or 22 gallons, require % lb. of
phosphoric acid, and Professor Lowrie says that one ton of stable dung contains
only from 4 to 9 lbs. of phosphoric acid or about half as much as nitrogen and
potash. Supposing, then, according to this calculation that ten tons of stable
dung did contain 60 lbs. of phosphoric acid, this would amount to not quite one-
third of the amount, which we are told is given per hectare in the Champagne—
which is certainly a limestone country demanding much —and, if the dung should
contain 90 lbs. of phosphoric acid in the 10 tons, it would be only one-half. The
rest must therefore be given by other phosphatic fertilisers. (See later on and
the Appendix I.)
Science has only of late years come to the assistance of the vinegrower even on
the Continent of Europe. Those practical vignerons, who years ago came from
there to Australia, had probably used distinct methods, suitable for the locality
from where they emigrated. They simply followed those adopted by their fore-
fathers, which they now transferred to Australia. Here we have a totally
different climate, and grow' probably to them altogether unknown varieties. The
situations, aspects, and the soils are not the same wherein vines will thrive here,
and produce a generous, and under fair treatment, and acting under more modern
and scientific know ledge, a very good wine, or raisins and currants. These w r ide
discrepancies of practice were years ago a great disadavantage for all intending
viticulturists, who had no previous knowledge of the growung of vines and wine-
making. The great advantages w T e had otherwise has allowed us to overcome
the above difficulties. To be quite successful requires, however, some discrimina-
tion, and more than ordinary intelligence even now. We can just as little adopt
a standard system for all parts of Australia, as such can be done elsewhere; but
here, as there, it is of the greatest importance to follow in the wake of scientific
research, if we hope to be on a level with the most intelligent vignerons of other
-countries, and to find a market for our produce.


Every kind of soil requires different manuring, and yet, if we are to notably
increase the average yield of vines, we must restore at least what plant-food we-
withdraw. The average of the figures given by Muntz are 55 lbs. of nitrogen, 15
lbs. of phosphoric acid, and 50 lbs of potassium oxide per acre, but in what
manner to apply this, is not so simple. You should not use kainit and nitrate of
soda on heavy clayey soils, as they make the soil hard and impermeable even with
the application of lime. It is better to use other potash manures and sulphate of
ammonia, together with stable dung, chiefly for the purpose of forming humus.
Sulphate of ammonia, although of slower action, is best for limy soils, but it is
useless for a topdressing. For this purpose you must use nitrate of soda The
climate of those parts of Australia, where winegrowing for winemaking has been
tried and found to be suitable, has two factors of very great importance viz ,
sufficient heat and light; and South Australia in particular can claim duiing the
grape harvest, almost without exception, dry air and absence of rain or heavy
dews Previous to the grape harvest dews are, however, important for thinning'
the skins and increasing the sap. The heat is on some few days of the year
excessive, so as to roast some of the bunches not well protected by leaves, frosts
in spring are not frequent, nor general, except in low situations, which should not
be planted. The rainfall is also in most years quite sufficient, and needs only to
be supplemented in such localities as at the River Settlements. Irrigation else-
where may increase the size of the bunches and berries, and be thus of advantage
to table grapes; but for wine grapes it should only be resorted to, if the vines
show the absolute want of moisture, or in calcareous or limestone soils, where
without it a further excess of alcohol in the wine might be the result. The
strength of the wine grown here on such soils is already very considerable, and
greater than desirable. A little limestone or ironstone rubble in the soil may here
also produce a wine of excellent quality. In Europe they obtain from such soils
perhaps without exception the finest and best liked wines. They retain the heat
there, which is a matter of consequence, but not required here. On the whole,
however, I can but agree with Professor Perkins that I prefer a sandy, or sandy -
loamy, or schistose soil as likely to produce here with manure quite abundant
enough, and yet a lighter, delicate wine Our hills up to 1,200 feet, also neai
Clare and many similar localities in Victoria and at Albury, can produce them.
But vines do not require so much plant-food for the formation of grapes as for
the wood and leaves. On an average you may remove in pruning, after the canes
are dry, from 2,400 to 3,200 lbs per acre. Leaves, which also exhaust the soil, in
their green state may weigh up to lb,ooo lbs., the roots about as much as the canes,
and the trunk from 16,000 to 24,000 lbs. per acre While a hectare (2| acres) of
vines gave in 1892 only 143 gallons of wine, and took Irom the soil 74 lbs. of
nitrogen, 22 lbs. of phosphoric acid, and 82 lbs. of potash ; the crop of 1893, con-
sisting of 1,224 gallons, required 82 lbs. of nitrogen, 23 lbs. of phosphoric acid r
and 102 lbs. of potash. A crop, which thus was nearly ten times as large, con-
sumed little more, except as regards potash. Therefore, the importance of feeding
at once the rooted vines you plant is now generally accepted as necessary. At
the Experimental Station at Southern Pines, in North Carolina, U.S., the quanti-
ties of fertilisers thus given are mentioned. During the first year each plant
received on an average 146 g of kainit, 85 g. of muriate of potash, 36 g of
sulphate of potash, 125 g. of a phosphatic manure, and 43 g. of nitrate of soda.
This was spread around them so far as the roots were likely to extend the first
year. In tlie Champagne, also, vines receive a very large quantity of manure at


the planting, and afterwards every year 250 lbs. of nitrogen, 242 lbs. of phosphoric
acid, and 250 lbs. of potash per hectare, although the vignerons there calculate
that on an average the crop requires only 84 lbs. of nitrogen, 48 lbs. of phosphoric
acid, and 94 lbs. of potash. Nearly the same is done in Medoc, and exactly the
finest wines grow on land that receive the largest quantity of fertilisers Before
planting the subsoil is in many places heavily manured, as stated elsewhere.
In “La Fumure de la Yigne ” (the manuring of vineyards) Mods. Arthur
Thezard says that he (being an agricultural chemist) found on an average in
1,000 parts of dry matter of the vine—phosphoric acid s'oo, potash 12 50, lime
19 00, magnesium 54)0, and nitrogen 18 00. Other French and American analysts
found pretty nearly the same proportions, and he thinks, that if vines received in
the proportion of 1 unit of phosphoric acid to 2'50 of potash. 3'Bo of lime, 1 of
magnesium, and 3'60 of nitrogen, we may expect to obtain the greatest yield from
them. (See Professor Wagner’s later experiments in Appendix I.) Mons. M.
H. Joulie, an eminent analyst, says in referring to the same matter that to per-
fectly develop your vineyard —irrespective of nitrogen —you should in round
numbers give for one per cent, of phosphoric acid three per cent, of potash (after
Wagner 4 per cent.), four per cent, of lime, and one per cent of magnesium, the
same as you would use for a crop of lucerne. If a vineyard produces little fruit,
but sufficient wood and leaves, it is an indication that nitrogen, lime, and mag-
nesium are present in sufficient quantity, while more phosphoric acid and potash is
required. On the other hand, if the reverse is the case and potash is abundant,
the berries are numerous and well developed. Phosphoric acid being deficient,
the berries are rare, small, and contain many seeds. If too much lime is present,
as may be in a limestone country, heavy rains may amass it to such an extent as
to become a layer impenetrable *to water and air, and the vine is suffocated. The
leaves get yellow, the canes poor, and the yield diminishes more and more. Mag-
nesian limestone (dolomite) furnishes generally not a vigorous growth, but gives
to white wines a great delicacy.
THE USE OF NITROGEN.
Nitrogen plays an important part, in most cases it is useful, in fact absolutely
necessary, but sometimes disastrous, if in too great a proportion in the soil, the
vines make too much wood and leaves, and produce a great quantity of small
berries, which may not ripen. The black soils of Russia produce little, and the
vines planted in Tonkin produce not a single bunch, although the wood and leaves
would cover a regiment. To correct the effects of too much nitrogen there are
several methods mentioned. You could trench and mix the inferior subsoil with
the surface soil, or you may grow oats, which requires much nitrogen, or counter-
balance the excess by adding fertilisers that are not nitrogenous. It is, however,
much more likely that you may think of having given your vines quite enough of
nitrogen in stable dung, and yet you are far of the mark. In Europe also, until
a few years ago, it was expected that, irrespective of the admitted physical im-
provement of the soil, the farmyard dung used contained even more than
sufficient nitrogen. But exact experiments have shown that such is not the case
when manuring every third or fourth year with 450 or 500 cwt. per acre. Pro-
vided it is a really good stable dung, which in Australia is perhaps an exception,
it may appear in the first year almost as if you had given an excessive quantity of
nitrogen ; but in the later years it is the reverse. In horse dung, more especially


if dry-rotted and fire-fangled in heaps, and through bacilli that interfere with
nitrification, you may lose nitrogen to the extent of from 25 to 60 per cent., and
the little there may be of active nitrogen is not at once available. Where the
food of the animals was poor, or the dung badly conserved, horse dung gives to
the soil little else but humus for the expense and labor. This does not apply to
good farmyard dung, which many say is the foundation for manuring vineyards.
Professor Barth, of the Experimental Station of Alsace-Lorraine, has come to
the conclusion that at least one-third of a yearly manuring should be stable dung
for the physical improvement of the soil; the rest, however, other fertilisers,
Mahrlen also, of Bacharach, a teacher of the cultivation of the vine, says
whole secret of a rational nourishment of the vine lies only in the intelligent and
judicious application of commercial fertilisers with the usual farmyard manure.”
M. Joulie states that we should find in a well conditioned soil to a depth of eight
inches 3,200 lbs. of nitrogen, the same of phosphoric acid, three times that
quantity of magnesium, 8,000 lbs. of potash, 160,000 lbs. of lime, and 120,000 lbs.
of oxide of iron. But a well balanced soil should also contain about 2 per cent,
of organic matter, humus being the larger portion of it, and if the weight of the
arable portion of an acre is about 1,600 tons. 2 per cent, of it represents 64,000
lbs. of dry organic matter. The dung in moist Europe contains on the average
80 per cent, of water and 7 per cent, of mineral matter. There remains in such
a case 18 per cent, of organic matter. If the soil, therefore, received no other
means to enrich itself than 40,000 lbs. of dung every five years, and thus obtained
1,040 lbs. of organic matter, it would take sixty years to renew the quantity of
humus, which a fertile soil should - possess. Besides, the organic matter is con-
stantly destroyed in cultivated land by furnishing carbonic acid for the dissolu-
tion of mineral plant-food. But by experiments made at the school for vignerons
at Waedensweil in Switzerland it was clearly shown that farmyard dung alone
cannot sufficiently supply even the required nitrogen, much less the required
phosphoric acid and potash. Where these latter were supplied with nitrate of
soda or another nitrogenous manure the crop of grapes was far superior than on
the plots that received phosphoric acid and potash with stable dung Even with
liquid manure there was a difference of 532 lbs. to 450 lbs. in favor of liquid
manure. M. A. Thezard states also in his treatise positively that fresh dung
gives an insupportable taste to wine, which is not the case with chemical manures
of mineral origin.
In the wet sumrnmer and autumn of 1896 cryptogamic diseases and rotten
berries were far more plentiful where farmyard dung had been used than else-
where, where mineral manures were applied. Farmyard dung should not be
used where you trench for planting new vineyards. Where it is not obtainable,
or where climatic conditions make their application more desirable, it may be
necessary to use mineral manures both before and after the planting of a vine-
yard, and specially, when the soil is sand and rather devoid of organic matter.
In such a case a green crop, ploughed in with a little gypsum, to saturate the
acidity of the green matter, may be advisable. Commercial fertilisers have of late
years only found more general favor; but winegrowers as well as farmers are
frequently embarrassed oji the subject of the quantities to be applied to their
crops, the time for application, and the nature of the soils for which they are
suitable. The analyst teaches this only in an imperfect manner, so that they
have to depend alone on well conducted experiments, which embrace a period of
years, and are then only useful for certain soils. They may thus exactly appreci-


ate the value and the mode of employing these fertilisers and formulate for them-
selves comparative conclusions. Personally lam not afraid that too much of
any manure is likely to be applied in Australia, judging from the rather niggardly
wa* in which the farmers have in general applied manures, in the vain hope of
getting full crops from perhaps 40 to 80 lbs of a fertiliser, which may
contain from 15 to 16 per cent, of phosphoric acid. But the advice given by our
best known agricultural scientists is, for all that, oftentimes a puzzle. Instead
of horse dung—so large a proportion of our farmyard dung—being specially sub-
ject to the destruction of a large portion of its nitrogen, up to 25 per cent, and
more, through bacteria, which live upon the saltpetre, we are told by Professor
Wagner to rather use 2 cwt. of nitrate of soda per acre; but Dr. Barth goes as
far as 6 cwt. of nitrate of soda or 5 cwt. of sulphate of ammonia per acre for the
vineyards of Alsace, while Dr. Nessler wants 3 cwt. of nitrate of soda or about
the same of sulphate of ammonia One cwt of these to the acre will give II
ounces to the perch. These large differences as to the quantities of nitrogen
required are of course a consequence of the various soils, which these learned
gentlemen had examined, the vigor of the canes and the leaves, and the greater
or smaller crops removed. High and dry situations require also stronger manur-
ing than valleys, or moist situations, especially as regards nitrogen.
According to the “ Eevue Agronomique” of the 16th April, 1899, a great
number of methodical experiments have been made by the Departmental Pro-
fessors in different parts of France, and these have confirmed the great value of
nitrate of soda for vines. Professor Grandeau selects the experiments, made by
M. Vassiliere last year in 25 vineyards of the Bordelais covering a total of about
hectares, to report upon. The plots were situated in the most diverse parts of
the Gironde, from the sands of the Landes to the argillaceous, limestony or
siliceous soils of Bla}ais and Berrunde. One strip in each case received no dung,
another at the rate of 1,200 lbs. of a phosphatic manure and 400 lbs. of sulphate
of potassium. Bix other strips received the same quantities of phosphoric acid
and potash, and also nitrate of soda, varying at the rate of from 400 to 1,600 lbs.
per hectare The application of the nitrate of soda was made in March (August
here) in a circumfeience of one foot around the stems, and in each case did the
crop increase. The land without dung produced at the rate of 4,152 lbs. of
grapes per hectare, that which received only nitrate of soda without phosphoric
acid and potash produced with (at the rate of) 400 lbs. per hectare, 4,768 lbs. of
grapes; with 600 lbs. 4,992 lbs. ; with 800 lbs. 5,166 lbs.; with 1,000 lbs 5,412
lbs.; and wdth 1,600 lbs. 5,482 lbs. Compared with the subsequently mentioned
plots the foregoing showed that the soil had not sufficient phosphoric acid and
potash for the larger doses of nitrogen. Land that received not only nitrate of
soda but also the two other manures produced on the plots manured with at the rate
of 400 lbs. of nitrate of soda per hectare, 5,930 lbs of grapes ; with 600 lbs. 7,672
lbs.; with 800 lbs. 12,576 lbs.; with 1,000 lbs 15,376 lbs.; with 1,600 lbs. 15,662
lbs. of grapes. These experiments showed clearly that more than 1,000 lbs. of
nitrate of soda per hectare was excessive in proportion to the abovementioned
phosphoric acid and potash manures, and it could not increase the crop suffici-
ently to make it payable.
Of oilcake, bloodmanure, and other nitrogenous manures not much use is
made is Australia 150 lbs. of bloodmanure are equal to 100 lbs. of nitrate of
soda or 80 lbs. of sulphate of ammonia, which latter should contain 448 lbs. of
nitrogen per ton, while nitrate of soda varies between 291 and 336 lbs of it per


ton. The contents of guano, even from Peru, are so various as to nitrogen, phos-
phoric acid, and potash, that nobody should purchase it without a guaranteed
analysis.
THE USE OP PHOSPHORIC ACID.
So far as present observations go we are told that phosphoric acid gives to
the wine the fine fragrance, the bouquet, which may require years to be fully
produced, and that the want of it makes the wine only durable for very few
years. The mineral acidity prevents decomposition. This is apparent, if you
learn, that the common light Rhenish wines, which do not keep long, contain only
up to 25 grammes of phosphoric acid in 220 gallons, while the fine Riesling
wines of fully ripe grapes, the “ Auslese,” of the Rhenish provinces, contain
frequently more than 450 gof phosphoric acid in 220 gallons, which
gives them their bouquet and keeping quality for more than 100 years. If we
hope, therefore, to make really fine wines, it is necessary to give our vineyards
an abundant supply of phosphoric acid, although too much may ripen the berries
too early. Continental results point to Thomas phosphate as preferable to
other phosphatic fertilisers. Messieurs Viala and Rivaz give this as their opinion
in the Revue de Viticulture of March 1897, for the following reasons, viz.:
“It does not only give to the vines phosphoric acid, but also magnesium, lime,
iron, &c., which are very useful; it is at once soluble, and gives good results as
regards the yield, and the ripening in good time.” The extraordinary good
results which had been obtained in limeless, in peaty, and in argillaceous soils,
led to the belief that Thomas phosphate was only suitable for these soils, but
experiments made in limestone country surpassed all hopes. Thomas phos-
phate does not, contrary to all expectations, undergo any transformation in the
soil except that the lime which it contains is carbonised. The phosphate of lime
is at once available for the plants; besides its phosphoric acid not being soluble
in water, will not be lost into such depths which cannot be reached by the roots
of the vines. M. Thezard mentions also what can be hardly true —that, probably
on account of the keeping quality, &c., before mentioned, the use of this manure
gives to an hectolitre of wine asoto 00 per cent, better price in the market. In
Europe you may spread Thomas phosphate before, or at the time of budding,
as may suit the convenience of the vigneron. M. Thezard recommends what
seems excessive for a vineyard that is not vigorous, makes short canes, and shows
yellow leaves —the first year from a ton to 23 cwt. of Thomas phosphate per
acre, 160 to 320 lbs. of kainit, from 120 to 200 lbs. of nitrate of soda, and in lime-
stone country 320 lbs. of sulphate of iron. In the following years 320 to 400 lbs.
of Thomas phosphate, 100 to 180 lbs. of kainit, and 120 lbs. of nitrate of soda
would be sufficient per acre. Of the last-mentioned you may apply too much,
and in that case the vine may become unproductive. If the other quantities
seem too large compared with the crop, it should be considered that more must
be at first given on account of the long time before these substances come into
contact with the mass of the roots. Although M. Thezard admits the great use-
fulness of mineral and bone super-phosphates, he seems generally to prefer
Thomas phosphate for a light, dry, gritty, or gravelly, limestony, or volcanic
soil, such as is suitable for vines in France. And he is in that respect at one
with the great majority of vignerons. Up to a few years ago super-phosphates
were generally used; now Thomas phosphate is preferred on account of its


lasting and always even action, which is of great importance for a perennial
plant like the vine, and further as containing much lime and magnesium, both of
which are valuable for vineyards, if you consider, that no less than 50 to 70 lb.
of lime, and 8 to 10 lbs. of magnesium are annually withdrawn per acre. Professor
Glrandeau, one of the greatest authorities on viticulture in Prance, publishes in
the Bevue Agronomiqueoi the 16th of April, 1899, new researches, which have
shown that mineral manures, and especially phosphoric acid, exert on the quality
of wines a clear and the most favorable influence. He then compares the crops
of grapes cut in the years 1891 to 1891 from an hectare at Avenay, manured
with 30,000 lbs. of farmyard dung mixed with the mud from ditches, with those
obtained when manured with 1,000 lbs. of Thomas phosphate, 400 lbs. of chloride
of potassium, and 600 lbs. of sulphate of iron. The soil seemed sufficiently
supplied with nitrogen, contained 20 per cent, of carbonatq.of lime, and could
only be worked to a depth of ten inches to a foot. The former hectare gave on
an average in three years 6,080 lbs. of good grapes after rejecting those that were
unripe or rotten ; and the latter gave in 1895 and 1896 an average of 7,898 lbs.
In 1897 manuring with compost was altogether abandoned, and the vineyard
received per hectare the abovemeutioned 2,000 lbs. of mineral manures. There-
upon the average crop increased in 1897 and 1898 to 7,990. lbs. The cost of the
30,000 lbs. of dung was at 15 francs per ton (225 francs) ; the working of it,
transport, and spreading, 200 francs; while the mineral manures cost 105 francs
(£5) per hectare; and a few francs for the spreading. Next year some nitrate
of soda is to be applied to supplement the nitrogen, and a still better crop is
expected. As regards Thomas phosphate, he says that he now applies certain
rules on about 750 acres of his properties in Lorraine, in concert with M. Thiry,
at the Agricultural School of Tomblaine ; also, on nearly all the land of the
School of Matthieu, at Dombasle. He uses quantities of 1,000 to 2,000 lbs. per
hectare, together with nitrate of soda, and the results of ten years’ trials have
been a large increase of his crops. His land, and that at Tomblaine, is siliceous
and poor in lime, and the use of Thomas phosphate is an economic way of
obtaining better crops, its action on vegetation being immediate. The vignerons
in Bourgogne and Champagne being by him advised to enrich their vineyards
with phosphoric acid, and lately, through using Thomas phosphate, must be
well satisfied, his expectations having been justified, as shown by reports in the
Bevue Agronomique. He had used in a vineyard containing 18,000 vines, from
25 to 35 years old, in Avenay, in the Champagne, planted on a thin, clayey, limy
soil, which contained 20 per cent, of carbonate of lime, in the years 1891 to
1894, 10 in. to 1 ft. deep, 12,000 lbs. of farmyard dung and mud from ditches per
acre. In the following year the vineyard was divided into two equal parts of
li acre each. One half received farmyard dung again, the other 400 lbs. of
Thomas phosphate, 160 lbs. of muriate of potash, and 240 lbs. of sulphate of iron
—this latter being considered necessary in France for the formation of
chlorophyll, and to counteract the chlorosis (paleness and yellowness of the
leaves) so frequent in soils rich in lime. As Thomas phosphate contains also
some iron in a soluble form, it may, in most instances, supply here sufficient iron.
The manures were broadcasted in autumn, and worked in. The result was 30
per cent, more grapes, on the land manured with the fertilisers, and the net gain
was actually 50 per cent, on account of the saving of labor. In Burgundy no
sulphate of iron was used, although the soil contained there even more lime, up
to 20 per cent, and 42 per cent., and yet the results were quite as favorable.


These experiments were made in six vineyards, of which some contained very old'
vines, some only four years old, and all showed the superiority of Thomas*
phosphate over super-phosphate. The vineyards were equally divided, and in the
month of April part A received 400 lbs. of Thomas phosphate The other, B,
received 240 lbs. of super-phosphate, and at the same time both received equal
quantities of 320 lbs. of kainit, and 160 lb. of nitrate of soda per acre, Results
were very good ; but the vines in part A showed more vigor, broader, and dark
greener leaves, and had with one word the advantage over those in part B. The
owners of these vineyards found the advantages of Thomas phosphate so
superior that they decided, although the results with less super-phosphate had
been good, to manure in future only, as they had done in part A. P. Grandeau
ascribes the greater success with Thomas phosphate in part to the gradually
settling down of the fine, but heavy meal to the deeper roots of the vines without
the danger, however, from being leached out of the soil. Similar results are
reported from other parts of France and other countries, and it is now an
established fact, that you can spread Thomas phosphate before vegetation com-
mences, up to the moment when it stops. Mr. Bettinger, of Temmels, on the
Moselle, planted in 1892 a vineyard on calcareous soil. Before planting he
brought Thomas phosphate and potash salts into the subsoil The vines made
strong canes, and in the second year he gave a top-dressing of nitrate of soda.
The vines grew so well, that in four years he had a crop of grapes, while on an
adjoining vineyard, planted at the same time without fertilisers, you could find
only here and there a bunch of grapes. . Mr. B. had spent £3 Bs. for the
fertilisers and their spreading, and he realised a net profit of £2l 12s Mr.
Scheffgen, of Nittel, on the Moselle, manured in spring, 1893, a quarter of an
acre of his vineyard with cwt. of Thomas phosphate by digging it deep round
the vines. He had 20 gallons more wine from it than from a like piece im-
mediately adjoining, but unmanured ; this being a net gain of £2 3s. 6d. against
a cost of 4s. 6d. In the Moselle it is now the rule to add I lb. of Thomas
phosphate to every newly-planted vine.
THE USE OF POTASH SALTS
Both nitrogen and phosphoric acid can only in conjunction with potash salts
ensure success. As Mr. W. F. Snow remarked at the Congress of the
Agricultural Bureau in October, 1897 —“ Although vines are consuming a great
deal of nitrogen and phosphoric acid (of the latter in fact more than fruit trees
generally), the great standby of the vine is potash. Judging by the experience
of the most scientific vinegrowers in France, if more potassic manures were
applied to the vine we should get much better results; but kainit I would not
advise to use.” The ash of the caues of the vine show s already how necessary
potash is to the vine, for it contains 30 per cent, of potash, or more than double
the percentage of most other plants, so that not unfrequently 140 lbs. per acre
may be required. In analysing the seeds of grapes considerable quantities of
phosphoric acid, lime, and nitrogen (see Appendix I.) are found, and we must
come to the conclusion that tbe potash co-operates chiefly in producing the
flesh, or pulp, of the berries.' ' According to Baron von Liebig, however, potash
is instrumental in the distribution of carbo-hydrates throughout the plant, it
being found in the buds, shoots, and also relatively largely in the seeds. But
the chief use of potash salts is that they favor the decomposition of minera
I


particles in the soil, and, in connection with phosphoric acid, they enable pea-
flowering plants to draw upon the air for a stock of nitrogen, which, when
ploughed in—as may be done for vines also —or in lesser degree by the root
residue, supply in a very cheap way the most expensive nitrogenous plant-food.
For a long time our vignerons seem to have been of opinion that to return
the husks, and to bury them with the leaves and the ashes of the burnt canes,
were sufficient to restore to the soil the plant-food removed by the crop. The
bunches of grapes contain, however, in a fair crop, 20 lbs. of phosphoric acid, and
48 lbs. of potash, of which the wine retains at least 4 lbs. of phosphoric acid, and
12 lbs. of potash. The husks and stalks can, therefore, return only 16 lbs. of the
former and 36 lbs. of the latter. It is also fully understood that any part of a
potash manure that is not taken up the first year remains fit to be used for
subsequent crops. The best kind of a potash fertiliser for vines is one that
does not contain a considerable quantity of chlorine. In fact, I am surprised
to find so much kainit used in France. The grapes of the better kinds contain a
much larger quantity of potash, and the quality of the wine is thereby improved.
It is at least probable that the grapes contain more sugar where the soil is rich
in potash. Professor Wagner recommends 50 lbs. of muriate of potash to be
applied yearly, with 100 tons of farmyard dung, and, of course, phosphoric acid.
For all vineyards that are to be planted or replanted large quantities of both
Thomas phosphate (I ton to 1 ton 4 cwt.), and sulphate or muriate of potash
(from 10 to 12 cwt. per hectare), are w T orked into the subsoil in Europe, at least
18 in. deep. In Australia, where trenching for a vineyard is now an exception,
not as forty years ago, a rule, it will be difficult to persuade the owner to go
even to the expense of trench-ploughing, and thus to supply the subsoil for the
deeper roots with a store of phosphoric acid and potash. The absence of these
in the subsoil may be the chief reason for the comparatively poor crops of
grapes generally obtained in Australia. To remedy this at old vineyards, it
may be of use to make holes between the vines and deposit into them (plant-
salts) naehrsalze, of which Ohlendorf’s of different compositions have been
applied. My friend, Mr. Thomas Hardy, one of South Australia’s successful
pioneer vignerons, informed us also in a letter written last year from Africa,
that “ Where they have there planted vines, two hundred years ago, in a rich
alluvium, only 3x4 ft. apart, they fertilise them by opening out a hole for
manure between every four vines. Various substances are used. Fertilising is
also done by opening deep furrows with a plough and deepening them with a
shovel, the idea being to bring the roots downwards.” But this plan is likely to
destroy more of the small roots near the surface than is desirable (see Seppelt’s
report).
A few examples of what phosphoric acid and potash salts, in connection with
green manuring, or liquid manure, or the best of farmyard dung, can do, even
in districts where it is already somewhat difficult to obtain good and well-ripened
grapes, may here find a place. Mr. J. J. Hoffmann acquired at Liebfrauenthal,
in Ehenish Hesse, poor, drift-sandy land, used only for sheep up to 1887. He
has now made a vineyard of 85 acres, and, after applying first liquid manure
and ploughing in a crop of green manure, he used mineral manures as mentioned
at the bottom of the plates at the back of this pamphlet The vines were Early
Burgundy, some growing on poles, mostly on wires. Before using these latter
fertilisers he obtained on an average 34 bunches from a vine of a weight of
810 gr. ; but afterwards he cut as many as 83 bunches, weighing 4,780 gr.


I may remark here that vines may be manured once with kainit, but generally
another potash manure should be used. Kainit contains, besides 25 parts of
sulphate of potash, no less than 75 parts of other salts, mostly common salts.
It also hardens the surface to a crust, and thus acts badly as regards the
physical nature of argillaceous soil, while this may be actually useful if applied
to "a light soil. But that it is desirable to use mineral manures to a large extent
is clear enough. If you have to cart and spread 100 cwt, of good farmyard dung
to enrich vour soil as much, as 2 cwt. of Thomas phosphate, I cwt. of sulphate
of potash, or muriate of potash, and 2 cwt. of nitrate of soda would do.
Mr. von Lassaulx, a vigneron on the most northerly limit for growing vines on
the Ahr, found his vineyard soon become profitable after he had commenced to
use (5 cwt. of Thomas phosphate and (3 cwt. of potash salts per acre, with dung.
Mr (t. Froelich, of Bavaria, had twice as many grapes after using potash,
phosphoric acid, and nitrogen, in form of fertilisers, compared with other parts
of his vineyard. The quality of the wine was very good, as he realised at auction
for this two-year-old wine £6O for 215 gallons. Mr. L. Isler, of the Palatinate,
says that he can better regulate manuring with fertilisers. With very much
farmyard dung he had frequently too much wood, and one of his vineyards,
which did not receive any since 1883, but every year mineral fertilisers, is at
least as fruitful as the adjoining, that received the farmyard dung. The yrapes
are finer, the must heavier, and the wood earlier ripe. Mr. Diihr, of Luxembourg,
manured well with stable dung in 1889 and 1890, but not in 1892 and 1898, He
then broadcasted in spring, 1894, 2 cwt. of Thomas phosphate on 1,000 square
metres, and pressed from that piece 2,000 litres more wine than from other pieces
of the same size, and otherwise equal. He had a net gain of £26 15s. from it.
In autumn he used again 2 cwt. of Thomas phosphate, and as much of potash
salts; also, in spring, 1895, after the buds were well forward, 1 cwt. of nitrate
of soda, and had a net profit of £4l lls. Being compelled, in consequence of
the vigor of the vines, to leave more wood, he pressed in 1896, after manuring
as before, 6,000 litres, with a net profit of £65. And now the vignerons of the
neighborhood, who at first ridiculed Mr. Diihr’s experiments, try to emulate him.
Professor Coloman, at Kerpely, director of the Agricultural College of
Debreczin, in Hungary, reports on the sandy vineyard, planted with Italian
Riesling, and, although manuied with farmyard dung, were very poor in plant-
food. 'The leaves were yellowish chequered, the berries in the bunches quite
loose. It] autumn, 1894, he used 280 lbs of Thomas phosphate and 280 lbs. of
potash per acre, and on a few plots some nitrate of soda and sulphate of
ammonia was given. The results of the vintage for 1895 were not striking,,
the fertilisers having been used in autumn, after the fruit-buds had been already
formed. The leaves, however, were dark green, the bunches were close-berried,
the wood much stronger, able to produce finer fruit-buds, and the manured
plots gave 49 gallons more per acre than the unmanured. He applied now in
autumn, 1895, 140 lbs. of kainit and the same of Thomas phosphate per acre, and
had a surprising crop from the plots so manured, viz., 7,/20 lbs. of grapes per
acre against 5,040 lbs. from that not so maniin d, and the former gave 500
gallons per acre of 18 2 per cent, of sugar, the Juttrr 841 gallons of 17 per cent.
Sugar.


NOURISHING SALTS (NAEHR^ALZE).
In Germany so-called naehrsalze (nourishing salts) are frequently spread on
heavy soils six weeks to two months before budding ; in lighter soils somewhat
later. But the time is not of great consequence. They consist of a mixture of
the three plant-nourishing elements. Frequently, also, each young vine receives
25 gr. of such naehrsalze, or you open holes of 8 to 12 in. depth and length
between two vines and put into such hole from 30 to 40 gr. Leave such holes
open until a rain dissolves the salts. Young vines will make strong and many
roots, and will gain a year or two, the bunches and berries will be superior, and
the wine far finer.
If you wish to use Albert’s concentrated horticultural manure, which con-
tains the three principal elements in its brand A .G., it is advisable to use it in
early spring, when the vines begin to show leaf-buds, by making some holes
around the stems, and, after putting in each from 1 to 2 oz., fill them with
water. You are thus carrying the manure to the deeper roots. A second
application after the berries have just set should make your crop pretty certain.
The objection to this is the almost’impossibility of doing this in larger areas, and
that you may supply one or more of the principal elements in this manure which
your soil may not require, or not in the proportion. 1 can but recommend to
experiment on plots w r ith and without fertilisers, but lam against the use of any
mixed manures, although some of these complete manures may have giveu satis-
factory results, especially when planting a vineyard. Composed as these are of
the three plant-foods, and perhaps some lime, you may be purchasing one or
other of these, which your soil does not actually require. In America enormous
sums are thus wasted. To obtain the largest net profit, you should by your
experiments ascertain the effect of giving nitrogenous, potassic, or phosphatic
manures together or separately and tw r o and two together. Vignerons using com-
plete manures forget what the soil itself contains, and thus pay for one or two
ingredients which there may be no need to supply, and yet to provide a most
profitable crop.
TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND OF PHYLLOXERA
If you treat your vines well from the beginning you may safely calculate
upon them remaining fruitful for sixty and more years, even in Germany. Their
vigorous growths will prevent many diseases. It is worthy of record what Mr.
F. H. Molesworth, F.C.S.L, said in the Australian Vigneron While persons
are fighting their foes above the ground with washes and emulsions, &c , let them
feed the soil properly, and it will carry on the battle more powerfully than they
can below the surface. Unless the vigneron keeps the soil sufficiently supplied
with the three chief plant-foods to satisfy his plants’ requirements, he will grow
nothing, or at most unhealthy, weak plants, open to the successful attacks of
every disease of the world In Australia phosphatic manures are very necessary
in most localities They assist the production of the fruit more than leaf and
stem.” In Bulletin No. 76 of the Cornell Station, N.Y , it is, for instance,
stated, that the shelling of grapes, which I presume means the dropping of the
young berries (in French coulure ) is prevented by the use of muriate of potash.
There are actually instances given where 1 lb. of kainit, or of sylyinite, or of
1 to \\ lbs. of muriate of potash, applied early in spring to each vine, stopped
this trouble where it was formerly very serious. Where 200 lbs. of muriate per


acre was used in spring scarcely a berry was lost, nor were the leaves blighted
to any greater extent than might be expected so late in the season. With
bone manure on the next plot the berries shelled, that the ground was fairly
blue in some places. Other plots showed improvement in proportion to the
amount of potash used. Monsieur Thezard combats “ coulure” by using phos-
phoric acid, as quite necessary to perfectly develop the ovaries and the seeds;
without it the berries set badly and remain small. Professor Trouessard says :
“ When we consider that for long years the same hoary old stocks have been
required to produce grapes without truce or mercy, and often without taking
pains to supply to them by a fitting manner the nourishment which is withdrawn
from them by the fructification of the grape, we shall be less astonished at the
decadence of our (French) vineyards. And, indeed, enlightened minds ascribe
the attacks of the numerous parasites to the weakness and exhaustion of our
vines rather than to any accidental cause, such as importation from abroad.”
Mr. D. McAlpine also, the Government Vegetable Pathologist of Victoria, states
in his “ Fungi of the Vine in Australia”: —Treatment for disease and manuring
should go hand in hand, and this plan has been followed in the experiments
conducted under my supervision by Mr. li. F. Gow at Abbotshall Vineyard,
liutherglen, Victoria. A three-acre patch of Shiraz, 37 years old, and said to
be worn out and almost past bearing, was treated in 1805 with artificial
manures. One acre was treated with Albert’s P.K.X.D. at the rate of 8 ozs.
per vine, the cost and labor being 87s. Bd. per 1,000 vines, and the yield of grapes
last vintage was 41 cwt. Another acre received potash chloride at the rate of
10 ozs. per vine, at a cost of 85s. 6d., and the yield was 35 cwt. The third acre
had Thomas phosphate at the rate of 10 ozs. per vine, at a cost of 335. lid. per
1,000 vines, for a yield of 40 cwt. The total return for the three acres was
116 cwt. of grapes, which gave 435 gallons of wine per acre, whereas at the 1896
vintage the same land yielded only 79 cwt. of grapes, for 263 gallons of wine
per acre (the three acres gave 516 gallons more). Other parts of the vineyard
bearing Shiraz, and where no manure was applied, produced a much smaller
yield, even although the vines were younger, and pruned and treated in exactly
the same way. The vines during that season were practically free from disease,
vigorous in growth, so that the effect of manuring upon disease was not
observable.” According to the Swiss press, in “ phylloxerol ” a composition has
been invented and successfully tried, which not only destroys phylloxera on the
roots, but acts besides as a fertiliser, if a hole 8 in. deep is made around the vine
before winter, filled with from 8 to 12|- oz. of phylloxerol, and covered up.
Professor Grandeau stated in the Revue Agronomique of the “ Temps” of the
20th day of July, 1897, that he visited vineyards in the Champagne with
Professor Tisserand, and found that very rich manuring with Thomas phosphate,
kainit, and nitrate of soda counteracted the destructive ravages of the phylloxera ;
stable dung and bisulphide of carbon alone cannot do it. In fact, an excess of
nitrogen stimulates an herbaceous vegetation, resulting in a nitrogenous sap,
which favors the several fungi and insects, such as the phylloxera. Monsieur
Thezard also says that phosphatic manures, and especially Thomas phosphate, do
augment the resistance of the vines, as they make the wood drier, the roots
firmer, and less succulent for the phylloxera, and therefore less favorable for its
development. To use these fertilisers is therefore an indispensable comple-
ment of treating vineyards with bisulphide of carbon. Of a vineyard at
Yougeot Professor G. tells us that phylloxera had in 1889, destroyed it to such


an extent that the unanimous opinion of the Burgundian vignerons condemned
it to eradication with a view of replanting it with American vines. The caues
were so poor that layers were found only with difficulty, and had to be marked
by sticks to find their place. The vineyard had been planted, perhaps, three
hundred years ago, by the monks of Citeaux, and the present owner undertook
to restore one portion (35 acres) of it, while another part was to be replanted
with American vines. In the first year, 1890, he spread about 70,000 lbs. of
horsedung per hectare, and hoed it into the soil. The layers being so weak
showed no greater vigor. In 1891 he used 90,000 lbs. of rich poudrette, but
the effect of these organic manures was nearly nothing. After an analysis of
the soil, which was about the same as one made twenty years before, Professor
Gr. induced Monsieur M Bocquet to use, in April, 1892, 25 cwt. of Thomas
phosphate, 10 cwt. of kainit, and 400 lbs. of gypsum, and in the middle of May
600 lbs. of nitrate of soda per hectare. The health of the vineyard was now
assured, if only followed up by similar treatment. After the vintage in the middle
of October, 100 tons of farmyard dung, equal to 400 lbs. of nitrogen, were spread
per hectare. In 1893 another ton of Thomas phosphate and 600 lbs. of kainit
were applied, and no nitrate of soda. The farmyard dung did not act in
consequence of the dry season, so that the vineyard did not improve. It
remained only stationary. In 1894 800 lbs, and in 1895 240 lbs. of nitrate of
soda were used per hectare, except on a piece named Montiotes, where the dose
of nitrate of soda for both years was 13 cwt. per hectare. At the commence-
ment of April, 1895, the vines at Montiotes did show yet an inferior growth to
other parts of the vineyard; but, as the soil was enriched previously with
potash and phosphoric acid, the addition of the large dose of nitrate of soda
was such a success that since that time the vines at Montiotes were as vigorous
and productive as those of the other part. In 1896 no manure was given ; but
in March, 1897, 1,000 lbs of Thomas phosphate and 800 lbs. of kainit, and in
May 400 lbs. of nitrate of soda were applied. It showed plainly that the
resistance of the plants against the attacks of the phylloxera stands in direct
proportion to their vigor. Since that time has Monsieur M. Bocquet resolved
to manure all his vineyards equally with 1,000 lbs. of Thomas phosphate, 800 lbs.
of kainit, and 400 lbs. of nitrate of soda per hectare, and Monsieur L. Bocquet
has renounced the use of farmyard dung in all his vineyards except for layering.
Although many of the vines at Yougeot, and also at Grands Peuillats, were
hardly alive, they grew even the first year after manuring with mineral salts
fairly well, and, as the bisulphite of carbon and manuring was continued
annually as before mentioned, the old Burgundy vines are now as strong again
as the best grafted on American vines. Professor G. is now perfectly satisfied
that almost destroyed vineyards, treated as before mentioned, will not only keep
alive, but show an extraordinary growth and fruitfulness. According to a
pamphlet, “ How to Use Salts Containing Potash and Magnesium,” published
and controlled by the Professors Drs. Fleischer, Maereker, and Wagner, the
magnesium seems specially important in the war with the phylloxera. Although
kainit, which has been used in such great doses at the vineyards of the Messrs.
Bocquet, contains large quantities of magnesium sulphate, viz.,' 16'5 per cent.,
and of magnesium chloride 13'0 per cent., it might perhaps be preferable, after
the first two or three years, to use purified double sulphate of potassium and
magnesium, which contains 34‘0 per cent, of magnesium sulphate, and 2‘5 of
magnesium chloride, with only I*6 per cent of common salt, against 3TO per


cent, to 34 6 per cent, in kainit. I imagine that the great quantities of common
Balt added with the kainit year after year must eventually have an injurious
effect on most soils. Sulphate of potassium and magnesium contains also twice
as much sulphate of potash, and thus a part of the higher price wih be
recovered.
MANURING IN AUSTRALIA.
Having applied to a large number of vignerons here and in the other colonies
to inform me whether they have made use of dung or mineral fertilisers, many
have had the courtesy to reply, to whom I tender my thanks. Unfortunately a
great proportion of them merely state that they have not yet used any manure,
even in aged vineyards; but Lam not so sure that the reply of others—that they
found it unnecessary-will be reiterated after they have perused these pages.
At all events, it is time to consider the advantages of manuring, in which so
many fully believe, and this is my excuse for publishing extracts from the letters
received.
South Austealia.
Mr. J. Basedow, of Tanunda, used artificial manures in 1897 on his very light
soil • but the season being very dry, the grass and weeds appearing after the vin-
tage and rain received the benefit of it. Neither foliage nor the\oung fruit
showed any difference in 1898, and after a heavy hailstorm most of the grapes
were lost, so that he had only 5 cwt. of grapes per acre. Against this may be set
my own experience. I used in 1897 in Norwood to thirty vines (table grapes),
which did not show any necessity for manure, on medium, rather dry soil, 8 lbs.
of Thomas phosphate and 2 lbs. of muriate of potash, and on stronger soil 8 lbs.
and lbs. I never had as fine grapes before notwithstanding the dry season ;
but I had no weeds feasting on the fertilising elements.
Mr. C. P. Chafpey, of Renmark, has used about three tons to the acre or
sheep manure on vines with very satisfactory results.
Mr. R. V. Cholmondeley, of Yale Royal Vineyard, O Halloran Hill, reports
that he does not yet manure his young vineyard, except that he burns all the
cuttings after pruning in a burner, going between the vines and all the potash
falling through a grating on to the land. He carts out also all the husks t a
have been put through the cellars. He hears that some use the Adelaide Sugar
Refining Company’s manure by placing a small insectibane tinful around eac
vine, which makes them wonderfully productive. v v
Mr. Joseph Coerell replies that Correll Bros., of near Mmlatou, x. ~
manured some old vines two years ago with bone superphosphate and this year
thev had a much better crop from these than from some younger and more
vigorous vines which had not been manured. They intend this winter to manure
with Thomas phosphate and perhaps some sulphate of potash. But phosphates
are most needed on the Peninsula. ~11 j
Sir Samuel Davenport, of Burnside, replies that he has used very Jit e
manure and that with mineral ones, as potash and phosphoric acid, the last two
drv years had affected the results. , . , -1
Mr. C. B. Dometee of Moppa, had to deal with a light, white, sandy soil,


which required mechanical improvement as regards retentive properties before
planting. This was done eight years ago by digging holes 4 feet square and 2
feet deep in which he made in two of the corners holes 3 feet deep by 6 inches
with a patent posthole digger, and the clay dug out was spread on the surface.
He has since sown every year in March a portion with either barley, rape, mus-
tard, crimson clover, or any other quick-growing fodder plant, with superphos-
phate of the Chemical Works as a light dressing, turned pigs with a ring in their
noses or sheep into the vineyard in May until July, and ploughed the crop down
at the end of August Afterwards the cultivation was kept going until Christ-
mas. The soil is getting darker every year, and is now a chocolate to dark grey
loam. This year he has sown in the middle of February Baart wheat, dwarf
Essex rape, Chinese cabbage, and white mustard, with 8 cwt of Chemical Works
superphosphate on 12 acres. In May he will turn in thirty pigs and plough in
August the rest of the crop down. Pigs or sheep have hitherto paid the cost of
seed and manure. The before-mentioned deep holes were used for the planting
of Zante currants, into each of which he placed \ cwt. of boiled bones, which he
rammed well down and on these planted five years old Zante currants, one in
each hole, 12 feet apart in the row, and the rows 20 feet apart. They commenced
to bear two years after planting, and have given on an average fair crops for the
last four years, notwithstanding the droughts and the hail of this season. These
yielded very much better than those of his neighbor planted in the ordinary way.
Unless the price for wine grapes improves he and many others will uproot them.
Mr. J. Gillaed, the Manager for Penfold & Co.’s vineyard at Magill, states
that he only manured hitherto with the husks of the grapes, which he puts on
any hard clayey ground. Generally speaking, he finds deep cultivation to act
well.
Mr. G. Geamp, of Howland’s Flat, whose carte blanche is so well and widely
known, has hitherto used no fertiliser of any kind. What 1 have personally
seen of his vineyard is on rich laud, which may not yet require much manuring.
Thomas Haedt & Sons, of Bankside and McLaren Vale vineyards, have
taken an interest during the last two years in manuring of vineyards. Unfortu-
nately their experiments made are, as they say, not reliable as a test, as many of
the vines have in places failed veiw much, probably from salt. In looking over
the figures sent to me, I cannot but come to the same conclusion, although
Thomas phosphate, except in one instance, seems to have slightly improved the
return, where 160 lbs. of it with 60 lbs. of nitrate of soda had been used on plots
of 60 x6O feet. Where 40 lbs. of sulphate of potash was added to the above 2
cwt. and 14 lbs. more grapes were cut. The unmanured plot proved, however,
this year to be as good as the former, and better than where 196 lbs. of Ohlen-
dorff’s manure was used, and on another plot manured with 224 lbs of super-
phosphate.
Mr. E. Mazcee, the Manager of J. H. Symon's (Q.C.) Auldaua vineyard, near
Magill, states that Thomas phosphate and kainit have given him good results, the
latter especially in soil rather rich in organic matter. He has found that it was
sufficient by itself. In poorer soil he has used both Organic manures he has found
useful on hillsides. It is more costly, but lasts longer than artificial. He has
also tried on a small scale one of Mr. G. Yille’s compound manures with excel-
lent results, composed of 4-10ths superphosphate of lime, 3-lOths nitrate of potash,
and 3-loths sulphate of lime. Fertilisers containing a high percentage of potash
salts generally give the best results on vinegrowing.


Professor A. J. Peekins, viticulturist for South Australia, values grape skins
as about equal to farmyard manure, perhaps a little better. Average composition,
about 1 per cent, nitrogen, 3 per cent, of phosphoric acid, and 5 per cent, of
potassium oxide. He prefers to keep the grape skins in heaps, and then spread
them before ploughing. Better still, put them in a pit, and mix lime with them
to hasten decomposition, which is rather slow, and cart them when required.
In his report to the Minister of Agriculture of 1897-8, he says —“Owing
to the total absence of rain after June the fertilising elements remained
completely inoperative. These manures, however, were not lost; they remained
in the superficial layers of the soil to be washed down by the (next) winter’s
rain, and it is only during the present season (1898-9) that the vines are
feeling the beneficial effects.” From this it is clear that Professor Perkins had
already as long ago as 1896 used fertilisers for the very young vineyard at Rose-
■worthy College. The above negative result, for the season when applied, makes
him propose for the future to apply readily soluble manures in the drier districts
of South Australia in the early winter, before the first ploughing. And the four
tests which were made in 1897-8 with manures granted by the Syndicates of the
Stassfurt Potash and the Thomas Phosphate Manufactories led me and the gentle-
men applying the fertilisers to the same conclusions. The fertilisers had been
applied too late —in August and September —and the beneficial effects could
only be felt in 1898-9 or still later.
Mr. Frank Potts, of Langhorne, on his very fine black alluvial flat has not
as yet found it necessary to manure, although the vines are old.
Mr. Walter Reynell, of Reynella vineyard, applied in August to his old
vineyard stable manures at the rate of ten tons per acre. This gave good lasting
results both on a black flat and a limestony hill. It had the most marked effect
at the second vintage, when a vineyard of ten acres of Carbinet, Shiraz, and Mal-
bec gave 5,000 gallons of wine. Superphosphate used in August 1897 at the rate
of 2| cwt. per acre on old vineyards gave almost no appreciable result in last
year’s crop, but may do so this year. Mr. Ross Reid, the Manager, considers
sulphate of potash the most perfect artificial manures for vines.
Mr. J. A. Riddoch, of Katnook, near Penola, replies on behalf of J. Riddoch,
Esq., that the vineyards of Coonawarra, which have a loamy chocolate soil on a
limestone formation and a rainfall of 24£ inches, have as yet required no manu-
ring. They have borne but very few crops.
°W. Saltee & Son, of the Saltram vineyard, Angaston, used on forty years old
vines 14 cwt. of nitrate of soda to the acre, and once, some years ago, some bone-
dust. The result in both cases was no appreciable benefit. In 1898 they tried
grape skins, but owing to the destructive hailstorm they could not gauge the
effect on the crop. They noticed, however, that the growth was better and the
foliage retained its green color rather better than where none had been applied
They suggest that the manurial value of grape skins should be ascertained, and
whether it is better to scatter the heaps at once, or to leave them as tipped from
the dray until ploughing season. (Mr. Th. Hardy scatters the heaps at once.
See under A. J. Perkins.) . i , ,
Mr Wm. Salter, Manager for D. & J. Fowler at Nunootpa, has used only
grape skins and stalks, but thinks that the judicious use of fertilisers in the vine-
yards will pay handsomely. .
Mr, B. Seppelt, of Seppeltsfield, never used any manure except in 1898 one
ton of Ohlendorff’s vine manure on one acre. Result, a less quantity of grapes


<Doradilla) than from an equal patch, next to it. He attributes this to the cut-
ting of roots, as he trench-ploughed between the vines, which are ten feet apart
(one way only) and applied the manure in the trench. No doubt the eftect ot
the manure will be seen next season.
S Smith & Sons, of Yalumba vineyards, Angaston, never use stable manure,
but spread grape skins more thickly than they would the former, and value these
highly. Two and a half tons of bonedust, used two years ago, gave very visible
results in the wood when pruning, but the crop had not benefited to a gieat
extent.
Victoria.
Mr. Francois de Gastello, Manager of the Chateau Cookie vineyard,
replies that the 500 acres of vines planted on very rich soil require as yet no
manure. . , . , ~
Mr. Alex. Cauguet, of Mount Prior vineyard, uses what little stable manure
he has got. Required as yet no commercial manures.
Mr. Thomas McCaw, of St. Hubert’s vineyard, used farmyard manures (ex-
cept pig manure) and bonedust with good results.
Gow & Co., of Abbotshall vineyard, Eutherglen (where the fine results were
obtained mentioned on page 22) write to me “ that they have treated in July
1898 a four-acre block of vines with Thomas phosphate and will note results
next vintage. The yield having been so very good on the acre treated with
Thomas phosphate at the low cost of 335. 6d. per 1,000 vines seems to have deci-
ded them in using this fertiliser, and it is quite correct that they do not ex pec
any material increase in the crop lately cut, as the buds now formed will gne t le
cron.
Messrs. G. F. Morris & Sons, of Fairfield vineyard, use bonedust with good
results
Proprietors of Chateau Tahbilk vineyards have never used any manure,
although they seem from analysis of soil to require especially potash and phos-
phoric acid. , . . . v .
Jules Renahd & Co., of Melbourne, write—“ A number of vignerons m \ ic-
toria are using manures with good results ; but the experiments are carried on in
a haphazard manner. The results so far obtained bear out those obtained in the
late Mr. Gow’s vineyard, and go to prove that the vines pretty well show no
result the first season, a better result the second season, and a very good and
striking result the third season.” w . m 1
G. Sutherland Smith & Sons, of All Saints vineyard,\V ahgunyah. Thomas
phosphate has been used broadcasted in the district on various soils, which has
given good results. They themselves used nothing, but allowed the sheep to run
into the vineyards after the vintage.
New South Wales.
Ed. Capper & Sons, of Pokalbin, near Maitland, have a strong chocolate
colored, ferrngineous, and magnesian limy soil, with a subsoil containing fossils of
marine shells, and although the rainfall is only 12 inches manure has not been
used, as the average is 500 gallons to the acre.


J. T. Fallon, of Murray Valley vineyards, Albury. The soil is a red chocolate
color with a mixture of granite and ironstone. Rainfall from 30 to 34 inches.
Has used on a portion of the vineyard a limited quantity of well rotten stable
dung with good results ; also one ton of bonedust to ten acres applied about
the Ist of August, and the result was satisfactory. But a much larger quantity
could be used to advantage. The above would apply to the other vineyards in
the Albury district.
Geo. J. Frank land, of Mowbray, Paterson, has very rich alluvial land, at
times further enriched by occasional floods, which has beeu cropped for forty
years. The grossness has been sufficiently worked out to produce now enormous
crops of very fine wine from Verdeilho, Black Hermitage, and a Riesling (not the
German). They are trellised on two wires north and south, and from both the
latter varieties —in a good season, uninjured by frost or excessive rain—he has
made from 600 gallons per acre, and twice 1,000 gallons, when the vineyard was
younger, of which the first portion was planted in 1870. He gets 255. a dozen for
his wines.
J. D. Lankester, of Ettamogah, near Albury, has given me with unusual
courtesy in every respect the fullest information. Part of his vineyard, consist-
ing of upwards of fifty acres, was planted as early as 1863, and during the last
nine years he has conducted experiments with manures. Farmyard clung has
been used with considerable success by some of his neighbors. He finds that the
Sugar Company’s phosphates are the most suitable and give him the best results ;
but further experiments alone will give reliable data. Using Colonial Sugar Co.’s
No. 3 and 5 increased his crop, in some instances doubling it. But he keeps the
surface always loose and allows no weeds to grow. All manures containing
ammonia he covers as quickly as possible. Instead of growing and ploughing in
leguminous plants, which in dry seasons would not succeed well, be thinks it is of
advantage to run a few sheep into the vineyard after the vintage. Any manure,
and especially if very fine, should be sown in calm weather and at once worked
in, and he manures and works it in autumn, soon after the vintage, except with
nitrate of soda, which he uses about the time the buds break.
T. Mather, of Roslyn vineyard, Inverell, has a red vulcanic sandy loam con-
taining 553 per cent, of lime, '347 of phosphoric acid, T2B of nitrogen, ’273 of
magnesia, 105 of potash, and 013 sulphuric acid. He had taken twenty crops
off the vineyard and with the exception of one year has always had a good vint-
age. Three acres of Verdeilho and Pineaus, however, began to fall off about
three years ago. This winter (1808) he has manured them with half a pound of
Sugar Company’s manure Dto each vine. He keeps his vines, however in a high
state of cultivation, by which he assists them to resist a dry time like 1898, where
only 17 inches fell to the middle of November against the usual rainfall of 28 to
30 inches.
Mitchell & Sons, of the Olives, Howlong. The vineyard has a red clay with
a stiff dry subsoil and a 24-inch rainfall. Sheep manure has been used and six
experiments made with 32 lbs. of superphosphate of lime, 8 lbs. of sulphate of
potash, and 40 lbs. of plaster of paris, upon which blocks w r ere different legumens
sown —viz., crimson clover, yellow lupin, white lupin, field peas, vetches, and
sulla. Six other experiments were made with these leguminous plants without
the above manures. Other blocks received different manures only, but the
results, although promised by Professor Blunno, have not yet been received. No.
13 had the above manures with 24 lbs. of nitrate of soda; No. 14 the same, with-


out superphosphate ; No. 15 omits potash; No. 16 omits nitrate o£ soda; No. 17
omits plaster o£ paris; No. 18 substitutes 18 lbs. sulphate of ammonia for the
nitrate of soda ; and No. 16 got only plaster of paris.
CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH I HAVE MYSELF COME.
You may have used the best and most suitable fertilisers for any soil or
climatic conditions and find no improvement in the crops of grapes in the first
season ; only canes and leaves look healthier. Even if you manured in our
spring, the crop cannot then benefit much, only the buds forming for the
following season will harbor larger bunches, which a good seasop will perfect for
the next year’s vintage. If the season should be too dry, or the soil too compact
for want of proper tillage, even then you must have patience to await the action
of the manures.
In deciding upon the kind of manure, soils poor in humus require stable
dung, and to be assisted with nitrate of soda as top dressings, or with other
nitrogenous manures. Most soils demand as well phosphatic and potassic
manures. In limestone formation the latter are almost always necessary every
year, with nitrogenous manures, as may seem advisable. Light sandy soils
require nitrogenous manuring, and benefit physically and chemically by light
annual dressings of farmyard dung or others rich in organic matter. Cow and
pig manure is here preferable to the hot sheep and horse dung. Sandy soils are
also generally deficient in potash, but may not require large quantities of
phosphates. Heavy argillaceous soils demand lime and humose dungs, which we
may give, as in Europe, once in three years ; but yearly doses of nitrate of soda
and phosphates might be useful in addition. Professor Perkins recommends
for these soils a good dressing of gypsum to transform the large store of
carbonate in the soil into sulphate of potash, and thus making potassic manures
unnecessary. In our climate, except in some parts of New South Wales, where
leaching may be possible, any plant food given, but not used on account of
absence of rain or bad cultivation, will still remain in the soil for future crops.
The above general remarks explain fully that one vigneron may double his crop
when another fails, but results are as often due to thoughtful or careless
application, and the selection of the particular fertilisers used.
One more matter I beg yet to impress upon those who have hitherto been
afraid of using commercial manures —that they are plant food , not merely
stimulants , which leave the soil after some years in an altogether exhausted
state.


APPENDICES.
APPENDIX I.
Professor Dr. Wagner, of Darmstadt, addressed a number of experts on
the third day of December, 1898, at Hattenheim, on the manuring of vineyards,
of which I received a pretty full abridgment in manuscript. Before reading his
paper he said that he would like to ask every vigneron present, “ In what way
do you manure your vineyard? It would be foolish to let your vines hunger.”
The conclusions to which the professor has come agree almost with those of
Mr. Chr. Oberlin, but on first appearance M. Grandeau seems to disagree as
regards the use of phosphoric acid. It being admitted on all hands that at
least large tracts in South Australia require it for other crops, and frequently
more than other plant food, Professor Wagner might here, perhaps, advise the
use of large doses of phosphoric acid, like M. Grandeau in some parts of
Prance. It will therefore be necessary to make experiments, as also recom-
mended by Professor Perkins, to decide this question for our vineyards. The
first experiments made by Professor W. were made 13 years ago in six different
vineyards of Phenish Hesse, with 20 plots of 42 vines in e ' h of them. These
showed him only that nitrogen was always wanting, and that too much
phosphoric acid in one vineyard at Nierstein was undoubtedly harmful. Lately
he made new experiments in vessels containing about 7 cwt. of soil, and others
with twice such quantity. He selected as his vines ” .Riesling,” and made 120
experiments, chiefly to ascertain the percentage of grapes, wood, and leaves
obtained with the several manures, the hunger after potash, phosphoric acid, or
nitrogen, or the largest quantity necessary for the vines until oversatiated.
Por such experiments he manured one with the normal quantity given to each
vine, viz , 8 gram, phosphoric acid, 8 g. potash, and 16 g. nitrogen ; secondly,
with the last two without phosphoric acid ; thirdly, with the last two and 12 g.
phosphoric acid ; fourthly, with 8 g. phosphoric acid and 16 g. nitrogen, without
potash; fifthly, with Bg. phosphoric acid, 16 g. nitrogen, and 12 potash ;
sixthly, with the first two, normal quantity, without nitrogen ; seventhly, with
the first two and 24 g. nitrogen ; eighthly, with half as much more than the
normal quantity , and uinethly, with no manure at all (see plates numbered 11
Si and 9 showed soon the want of nitrogen ; the leaves got yellow, the
wood and young bunches remained weak, and after setting of the berries coulure
was general. Seven showed only a darker green of the leaves than 1.
Experiment 2 had also healthy leaves, but those of 3 were not so good as of 1,
so that the soil seemingly did not require manuring with phosphoric acid. Four
showed lighter green leaves compared with 1 and 5. At experiment 8 the vines
were healthy, but did not otherwise seem better developed. As regards the
ripening and the dropping of the leaves he observed that those vines which


received no nitrogen (6) or no manure at all (9) lost them by the 3rd of
October, while all the others had lost only on the average 20 per cent, of their
leaves. .
The weight of grapes on five vines taken from 6 (without nitrogen) and 9
(without manure) was only T 54 and T 96 kilog., while all others except 4
(without potash, and which gave 10.71 k.) had more than 12 k. Five vines of 2
(without phosphoric acid) had actually 14‘03 k., and of 5 (more potash)
1401 k.
The extractive matter of the must was, in 9 (without dung) 15’88 per cent.,
while the average of all others, with unimportant fluctuations, was 17‘50 per
cent. The average of acidity was 11050 per cent.
The canes of the five vines, counted as dry substance, gave the largest
number, viz , 100 with 1 (normal manuring), while the leaves were heaviest,
viz., 100 with 8 (the larger doses) ; 0 and 9 (without nitrogen and without
manure) were in either case very low, for wood 54 and 49, for leaves 41 and 42
respectively. These experiments showed clearly that the want of nitrogen gave,
firstly, fewer grapes, and consequently must, and also produced less wood and
leaves.
The contents of phosphoric acid in must and in the dry husks, wood, and
leaves, were on the average in the must, 0 0494 per cent.; in the husks, 0 499 per
cent.; in the wood, 0 261 per cent. ; and in the leaves, 0529 per cent. ; but
while the average in the must of the seven others was 0 0418 per cent, the per-
centage in 6 was 0 0661 per cent., and in 9 0’0865 per cent. The average in the
leaves of the seven others was 0 481 per cent., against 0,748 percent, in the
leaves of 6, and 0 642 per cent in those of 9. Wagner explains that a soil
sufficiently rich in phosphoric acid, but either unmanured or without getting a
nitrogenous manure, will produce in the crop generally a larger percentage of
phosphoric acid as where manured with nitrogen. Whenever, however, heavy
nitrogenous manuring has taken place, and the crop contains much phosphoric
acid, it will be found that there was a large surplus of phosphoric acid ready for
absorption.
The contents of potash were, on an average in the nine experiments, in the
must, 2‘0128 per cent. ; in the dry husks, 2 654 per cent.; in the dry wood, 0 707
per cent. ; in the drv leaves, 1414 per cent.; but 4 (without potash) and 5 (with
more potash) differed much from the other seven. The must in 4 contained
07869 per cent.,against 0 2184 per cent., and in 5 0 1995 per cent.against 2 184 per
•cent. ; the husks in 4 contained 2 390 per cent., against 2'672 per cent., and in 5
2792 per cent., against 2 672 per cent.; the wood in the seven others contained
0717 per cent., against 0617 per cent, in 4, and 0 729 per cent, in 5; and the
leaves in the seven contained 1464 per cent., against 0 998 per cent, in 4, and
1484 per cent, in 5. The soil required, therefore, potash, as shown, as well in
the crop of grapes as in the percentage of it in the must, the husks, the wood,
and the leaves, and their color.
The percentage of nitrogen in the must shows not much difference in the
nine experiments In the husks only 9 (without manure) contained much less
nitrogen, viz., I 348 per cent., and 6 (without nitrogen) 1'540 per cent., against
an average in the others of 1 588 per cent. The percentage in the wood was, in
O, 0 532 per cent., and in 6, 0 567 per cent., against the average of 0744 per
cent. ; and, while the leaves in 9 contained 0 994 per cent., and in 6 I’o3B per
cent., the average was 1708 per cent.


The chief results, therefore, were: —l. That, as the soil was relatively rich
in phosphoric acid, and the vine seems sensitive against too much of it, those,
where only nitrogen and potash was used, proved to be the healthiest.
Manuring with phosphoric acid was not only unnecessary, but to a small degree
hurtful ; 0 05 per cent, of it in the must, o's per cent, in the husks, o's per cent,
in the leaves, and 0‘25 per cent, in the wood is normal. 2. The soil was not
rich enough in potash for the requirement of vines; 2 per cent, of potash in
the must, 2‘5 per cent, in the husks, 15 per cent in the leaves, and 0 7 per cent,
in the wood is normal. 3. That nitrogen was insufficient in the potting soil was
shown where nitrogenous manure was given ; this showed least, however, in the-
husks, and not at all in the must. Ripe leaves of the Riesling should contain
as a minimum I per cent., while 2 per cent is the maximum, and you may conse-
quently ascertain within these boundaries whether your vines require nitrogen.
Normal is 1005 per cent, of nitrogen in the must, T 5 per cent, in the husks, 0 7
per cent, in the wood, and I*7 per cent in the leaves.
Finally, Professor Wagner gives what quantity of the three plant foods
Riesling vines require. Omitting 6 and 9, which gave an extremely low
composition of substances harvested, each Riesling vine consumes, for the pro-
duction of 2 424 g. of grapes, P 854 g. of phosphoric acid, 9 703 g. of potash,
and 5 630 g. of nitrogen ; for the 470 g. of wood 1/253 g. of phosphoric acid,
3 437 g. of potash, and 3561 g. of nitrogen ; for the 291 g. of leaves 1’434 g. of
phosphoric acid, 4 069 g. of potash, and 5 006 g. of nitrogen; or together,
4’54l g. of phosphoric acid, 17‘209 g. of potash, and 14’203 of nitrogen. For
every 100 parts of phosphoric acid are therefore required for the grapes 523
parts of potash, and 304 parts of nitrogen ; for the wood, 274 parts of potash,
and 284 parts of nitrogen ; for the leaves, 284 parts of potash, and 349 parts
of nitrogen. Adding these together you may say that in round numbers for
every 100 parts of phosphoric acid, 400 parts of potash, and 300 parts of
nitrogen are required. To manure one Morgen (containing 2,500 vines)
very fully would require 11 kilog. of phosphoric acid, 43 kilog. of potash,
and 36 kilog. of nitrogen but in giving annually 100 cwt. of stable
dung per Morgen you might probably have given 13 kilog. of phosphoric
acid, 32 kilog. of potash, and 25 kilog. of nitrogen; or, according to
the above calculations, quite enough of phosphoric acid, ll kilog. short
of potash, and also 11 kilog. of nitrogen As, however, only about 30-
per cent, of the stable dung is available, there is, in fact, a much
greater shortage of nitrogen in the stable dung. Instead of the 36 kilog., which
is taken as a very full manuring of nitrogen, only perhaps 8 kilog. would be
actually at once fit as plant food. Exact figures cannot be given, as the
quality of the dung is so very uncertain.
As regards a mixture sold as P.K.N., he remarks that this manure is not
suitable for vines. For every 100 parts of phosphoric acid it contains only 175
parts of potash, and only 35 parts of nitrogen, instead of 400 and 300
respectively. In the TVeinbau und Weinhandei paper of the 10th December,
1898, the address was criticised, some of the remarks made during the discussion
were given, and also the points generally admitted by the experts. The leader
stated that in practice an addition of Thomas, phosphate or superphosphate to
the stable dung has frequently a favorable effect, and this can be explained that
phosphoric acid does not move much in the soil, and may not reach the roots
unless these search for it. As regards potash a good addition is necessary


unless the soil is very rich of it, when a smaller quantity may be sufficient; but
nitrogen is never sufficient in stable dung. If only 100 cwt. were given,
nitrate of soda is a useful addition in two or three doses ; or, for heavy soils,
sulphate of ammonia. “ The whole secret lies in the right quantity of nitrogen,”
and the necessary lime must never be absent. Heavy nitrogenous manuring
demands also potash and phosphoric acid, as these will influence the quality of
the crops of grapes. These latter are, however, more favorable if taken from a
surplus of previous manurings than if given in strong direct doses. The good
results of manuring with nitrogen alone are only possible if a surplus of potash
and phosphoric acid is present from former manurings, or was already contained
in the soil itself. In the latter case it will soon result in exhaustion, and the
future production of grapes must suffer. Counsellor of Economies Mr. Czek
stated that he could not much improve a neglected vineyard by •means of several
double quantities of stable dung until he brought it deeper into the subsoil.
Mr. von Mumm, of Johannesberg, said, and was supported by several vignerons
from the Moselle, that 40 g. of P.K.N. applied to each vine in the two years
between two manurings with 200 cwt. of stable dung had not only increased the
crops, but improved also the quality. Mr Schlegel, of Oestrich, recommends to
patiently wait for results from commercial manures for three, four, and more
years, as the deeper roots will only then reap the advantage, and quantity and
quality will improve. Dr. Kuliscb, of Geisenheim, advocates the use of lime in
vineyards poor in lime. He also found excessive manuring with phosphoric acid
harmful. He pointed out, that the assertion commercial manures imparted to
wines a bad taste is a prejudice and superstition. It was also stated that the
finer varieties of vines contained much more phosphoric acid and potash in the
wood, and especially in the tops of the canes, while nitrogen predominates in
the more common varieties.
The points admitted after discussion werel. That stable dung is
insufficient in its composition, uncertain in its contents, and frequently
defective ; also, comparatively expensive. Commercial manures are therefore
necessary as a supplement, and especially for planting new vineyards, when
phosphoric acid and potash should be given to the subsoil. Nitrogen can then
be given annually. 2. If the soil received and retains the commercial manures
near the surface, means should be found to bring them into contact with the
roots. 3. The quality, instead of being injured by commercial manures, is fre-
quently improved.
APPENDIX 11.
Monsignor Gino Ovoisto, of Florence, Italy, has published in November, 1898,
nine experiments with fertilisers made during 1897-8; the results seem to show
unequal soil, which had probably been well manured not long ago. The average
weight of grapes gathered from two not then manured plots was per hectare in
1897, 8,400 lbs.; in 1898, 11,600 lbs. From the plot between these
two plots, manured with 2,400 lbs. of Thomas phosphate, 400 lbs. of
nitrate of soda, and 600 lbs. of muriate of potash, he took in 1897,
8,120 lbs., and in 1898, 15,200 lbs. of grapes. From the plot manured
with the same quantity of Thomas phospate and nitrate of soda and 600
lbs. of sulphate of potash he gathered in 1897, 11,020 lbs., in 1898, 30,860


libs, of grapes, while the average of the two unmanured plots on either side was
10,840 lbs. in 1897, and 17,120 lbs. in 1898. The results from plots which received
only two of the above fertilisers were better than from unmanured plots in two
instances and not as good in two others; but in all cases was the quality of the
grapes better from the manured plots.
APPENDIX 111.
Under the supervision of Professor Dr. Czerhoti, of the Experimental Station
at Altenburg, in Hungary, six experiments in manuring of vineyards on sandy
soils have been made in 1895 and 1896 at five different localities. Each plot con-
tained 1,425 are (about 35 acres). Following the advice of Professor P. Wagner
excessive quantities of phosphoric acid, viz 1,120 lbs. of phosphatic manure and
560 lbs. of sulphate of potash, were given with a view of regulating the growth of
the vines through a suitable addition of nitrogen, and thus to prevent any
damage to the vines and also to the quality of the must through an excess in
' nitrogen. Professor C. prefers this plan much to the usual way, in which well
decomposed farmyard dung is generally applied in Hungary, by which so much
nitrogen is lost. As has been experienced also elsewhere, the results of the first
year are frequently not reliable for any conclusions, as the buds then formed will
of course only give the crop in the second year In the first year all phosphatic
and potassic manures were given with nitrogen in the form of 420 lbs. of sulphate
of ammonia. In the second year nitrogen alone was given in the form of nitrate
of soda.
The vines in the several plots in the five vineyards were all planted three feet
apart either way, trenched and manured with the above quantities per hectare as
follows:—One, unmanured; 2, with phosphoric acid; 3, phosphoric acid and
sulphate of potash ; 4, phosphoric acid, sulphate of potash, and sulphate of ammo-
nia ; 5, sulphate of ammonia (not manured in 1896) ; and 6, unmanured.
I. Moor Comitat Ludwig Tehcr, Pencz. The soil is level, a loose sand, and
not previously manured, the vines three years old of the variety Ezergo. Plot 4
was the only one which showed finer leaves and stronger canes and gave a con-
siderably larger crop This left no doubt that the soil demanded the three plant-
foods. In 1895 198 lbs., and in 1896 848 lbs more grapes per hectare were cut
and the must contained 16£ per cent, and 18 per cent, respectively of sugar, in
1895 from \ per cent, to per cent, more than the grapes of other plots.
11. Szent Ivan Comitat, Ladislaus Gryor, Blacke. Soil gravelly sand and
wavy surface, planted five years ago with mixed vines and received pig manure
in 1894, but otherwise the plots were manured in 1895 and 1896 as at Pencz.
Here also plot 4 had the largest crop, viz. per hectare in the two years
1,878 lbs. more grapes; but the percentage of sugar was 14 in 1895—one per
cent, higher than on the other plots For 1896 the must did contain only 12
per cent., or one per cent, less than in four others.
111. Dunakesz in Pester Comitat R. Kleisner. Soil loose sand with wavy
surface. Planted in 1890 with White and Red Chasselas. Plot 4 had in 1895,
per hectare, 480 lbs. more grapes, and 3,378 lbs. more in 1896. Plot 3, manured
with phosphates and sulphate of potash, showed also a better crop than the rest,
■although much less than plot 4.


IV. Dunakesz Pester Comitat, Widow F. Kiiukel. Soil, a brown sand with
wavy surface, trenched and planted in 1890. Plot 4 had 904 lbs., and 1,148 lbs.
more grapes per hectare in 1895 and 1890, and plot 3 was again better than the-
other four plots.
V. Nyersapati, Pester Comitat, M. Szerka. Soil light, level sand, planted in
1888 with Pearl grapes. Otherwise manured as the funner, only in 1896 the
plots received compost. Plot 4 had 440 and 1,544 lbs. more grapes per hectare
in 1895 and 1896 respectively.
For 1896-7 the second and fifth plots were left out in four other vineyards as
neither phosphoric acid nor nitrogen alone had given good results. For plots 3
and 4 smaller quantities of the fertilisers per hectare were tried, viz. 700 lbs. of
a phosphatic manure, 350 lbs. of sulphate of potash, or sometimes proportion-
ately more of kainit, and 250 lbs. of nitrate of soda. The first three vineyards-
were planted on sandy land with Walach Riesling, on two of which they were
four years old ; on the third seven years old ; the fourth vineyard was planted on
sandy but wavy land five years before with Aramont and Bouchet. The results
from' the plots that received the full three fertilisers were as follows for the two
years together against the unmanured plots —viz., No. 1 yielded per hectare 3,382
lbs. more grapes; No. 2, only 1,444 lbs. more ; No. 3, actually 4,946 lbs. more ;
and No 4, where planted with Aramont, 2,928 lbs. more, and where planted with
Bouchet, 4,256 lbs. more grapes.
Mr. R, Nadeczky added for 1896 an experiment on humose sand planted with
mixed vines by using pig manure, obtained from the firm excrements of pigs fat-
tened with maize, which acts very quickly, but, as we shall see, is not lasting.
While he obtained from the unmanured plot per hectare 1,237 litres of must,
phosphate and sulphate of potash gave 1,296 litres, the plot manured with the
three plant-foods 1,482 litres and the pig manure 1,945 litres. For the year 1897
the plot not manured in 1896 was manured with horse dung, the next two with
nitrate of soda, and the fourth plot in 1896 manured with pig manure, received
nothing. Result per hectare from the horse dung 1,405 litres of must, from the
second plot (in 1896 phosphate and potash) 1,738 litres, from the third plot (in
1896 all three plant-foods) 2,085 litres, and from the fourth plot (not manured
in 1897, but in 1896 with pig manure) 1,390 litres of must. Na,deczky adds that
to manure with all three plant-foods, with a repeated doses of nitrate of soda the
second year is much better than manuring with horse dung, so much liked by his
vinegrowing friends. With the addition of phosphoric acid to the plot manured
with horse dung, and also to that with pig manure, he would expect better
results; but he thinks it his duty to recommend on sandy soil the three plant-
foods in the proportion before mentioned.
Other persons continued now' the experiments in 1897 and 1898 by leaving
one plot unmanured and using on the next in 1897 per hectare 700 lbs, of phos-
phates, 350 lbs. of sulphate of potash, or 1,400 lbs. of kainit, and 350 lbs. of
nitrate of soda ; and again in 1898, only 350 lbs. of nitrate of soda. In one case
of loose sand 3,352 lbs. more grapes were gathered per hectare, in another case
on light sand 1,938 more litres of must were pressed, and in a third case on
humose sand 11,800 more litres of must.
In 52 other cases experiments were only carried on for one year, and in only
four of these did the manured land give a smaller crop than on the unmanured^.


-while in the other cases the following results of the increased crops per hectare
are given, viz. ;
In 8 cases, between 200 and 400 lbs.
„ 5 „ „ 400 „ 600 „
„ 2 „ „ 600 „ 800 „
„ 2 „ „ 800 „ 1,000 „
„ 5 „ „ 1,000 „ 1,200 „
„ 4 „ „ 1,200 „ 1,400 „
„ 2 „ „ 1,400 „ 1,600 „
~ 5 „ „ 1,600 „ 1,800 „
„ ' „ „ 1,800 „ 2,000 „
„ 5 „ „ 2,000 „ 4,000 „
„ 3 ~ over 4,000 lbs.
From the foregoing the following conclusions were drawn as regards sandy
vineyards, viz.: —
1 The crop can be much increased with commercial fertilisers ; but
2. A paying crop can only be calculated upon if all three plant foods—
phosphoric acid, potash, and nitrogen—are used.
3. It is probable that if manured with farmyard dung an addition of
phosphoric acid, and especially potash, will greatly increase the crop.
4. Even without stable dung the very best crop can be got by manuring with
commercial fertilisers.
5. If you give the first year a complete manuring, with sufficient potash and
phosphoric acid, you may in the second year repeat only manuring with nitrogen,
and it is very likely that this will be also sufficient, if you repeat it, tor the
third year.
6. As nitrogen prevents the early ripening of the canes (here of less
importance) it is necessary to give a surplus of phosphoric acid and potash in
proportion to the nitrogen applied.
Vj The cost of the manures for the two years would be, in Hungary, about £5
per hectare, or £2 per acre, and the larger crop gathered had cost to the
several vignerous, per litre of must, 169 pfennige, 4‘04, and 10 31 pfenmge
respectively, and to others, for each 2 lbs. more of grapes, 4 69, 5 92, 596, or
6‘83 pfennige (of which eight are like one penny).
