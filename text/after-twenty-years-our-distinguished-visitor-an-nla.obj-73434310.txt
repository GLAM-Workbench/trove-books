Dedication.
TO WILLIAM PHILIP BtfCHERVAISE, ESQ.,
POSTMASTER, BALLARAT.
Dear Sir,
As a sincere mark of respect I dedicate this little book
to you.
For the most part the incidents chronicled are familiar
to you and my brother officers in the Post-Office, amongst
whom I have spent many happy' years; and I avail myself
of this opportunity to gratefully acknowledge the many kind
services they have rendered me.
I am quite aware of the meagre and imperfect nature of
the material I offer to the public ; but by you, I feel confident,
my humble efforts will be leniently criticised, and the most
fastidious reader will perforce have to admit that it is the
work of a man of letters.
I am, Dear Sir,
Most respectfully yours.
THE AUTHOR.

INTRODUCTION.
Readers of this little book will find no attempt on the
Author?s part to h;re them on to impossible scenes or
improbable incidents: all it contains has at least a
foundation in solid fact; and there can be no complaint for
want of variety.
I have used the language current amongst my com-
panions and the circle I mingle in, and have little doubt
but that my meaning will be easily comprehended by all.
From Her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria?who wields
alike gracefully the sceptre and the pen?down to nearly
the bottom rung of the Civil Service ladder, there is a
tremendous gap; yet it is my liumhle opinion that the
same instincts and aspirations prompt us alike, and after
this manner?
? To live in hearts we leave behind
Is not to die.?
Most of the hastily-written efforts herein contained have
previously been contributed to newspapers, and afterwards
preserved in a scrap-book ; and now, as a whole, with all
their imperfections, and such merits, if any, as may be
discovered in them, they are offered to a generous public, as
a first instalment to the literature of Ballarat, by
The Author.

AFTER TWENTY YEARS.
CHAPTER I.
? Aye free, aff ban? your story tell,
When wi? a bosom crony ;
But still keep something to yoursel?
Ye scarcely tell to ony.?
Fred Stamper and I had been grinding on in Her
Majesty?s Head Punching Office for about eight years, at
less than eight shillings a day, and during that period our
families had increased rather too rapidly. Fred had been
married for a little over four years, and was already
responsible for two boys and a girl, with a prospect of an
addition ere many weeks, while I (the writer of this truthful
narrative) had been married ten years, and my abode was
far too small to comfortably accommodate mine.
Fred is always boasting of his children, as if there were
none so good, yet mine are immeasurably?but as thousands
of bachelors will read this, I had better exclude domestic
affairs as far as possible.
Well, you see, although our families had increased at
more than a satisfactory rate, our salaries remained in statu
quo, and we were drifting gradually, but surely, into diffi-
culties. I daresay other philosophers besides myself have
observed a strange perversity on the part of nature, that
? Written nearly ten years ago.


is, to give those who have the smallest incomes the largest
families, and those who are the most anxious to become
parents are often ungratified. If they knew all they
wouldn?t grumble. But to my tale.
Well, one pay-day, when our little bills had been handed
in rather numerously, Fred says to me, ? What d?ye say, old
chap, if we take a trip to Melbourne, see the head of our
department, and, if possible, get an increase of screw, pro-
motion, or removal to some place where we might live
cheaper.? Says I, ? Fred, where are the funds to come
from ?? But this was a matter he had not overlooked. A
benevolent widow lady, not of the tribe of Aaron, residing
on the banks of Lake Wendouree, had promised, for a
proper consideration, and under proper security, to launch
out the needful, should we require it. I said the idea was
a first-class one ; that I would consult my better half, and
let him know the result in the morning.
Every man?s house is not only his castle, but its a kind
of secret friendly society, and you are bound in honor not
to divulge what takes place by your ? ain fireside,? or what
may be screened by the curtains ; let it suffice, then, that
I was possessed of sufficient tact and eloquence to
persuade my darling that the projected trip must result
greatly to our advantage ; and having given a solemn
promise that I would comport myself as became a married
gentleman and the father of a family, and that on the very
next occasion I went to town, which would be in less than
twenty years, she should most positively be my companion,
I obtained her consent. I regret to state that my friend
Stamper was not so successful ?his wife insisted on accom-
panying us. This was more than we contemplated ; as we
intended to combine business with pleasure, and be strictly
economical at the same time. However, there was no help
for it, and we resolved to proceed with our arrangements.


We applied, in a most civil communication, to our ? boss?
for a week?s leave of absence, the pica being ? urgent
private business.? Those who have not served in the Head
Punching department can form no idea of our surprise and
delight when within a week wo received a reply, graciously
granting the concession required. We didn?t expect to
hear from the ? Head? within a month at the shortest.
The next and certainly the most important and delicate
part of the business, was the raising of the requisite funds.
To the Lady of the Lake, already mentioned, we resolved
to proceed at once ; but being familiar with the old proverb,
that ? He who goes a borrowing, goes a sorrowing,? we
deemed it advisable to invest the balance of our joint capital
(one shilling) in a stimulant of P. 8., for the purpose of
being equal to the dreaded occasion. Among the multitude
of eager and intelligent readers I am certain to secure, I
daresay there will be a few amongst them who, when they
fancied themselves unobserved, have slipped into some quiet
hostelry for the purpose of having a refresher, with a solitary
? tanner? as the entire available assets, and when the order
had scarcely been given, a friend or two suddenly appeared
on the scene. Such was our unhappy lot. We stumbled
on three very dear friends, equally hard-up as ourselves, and
quite as much in want of a liquor. The result may be
guessed; we got into debt with the landlord rather than
appear shabby ; and, worst of all, after the glasses had been
several times replenished, we had the indiscretion to divulge
the nature of the business we had on hand, and our friends
insisted on accompanying us.
The immortal Burns has placed on record that?
? Wi? tippenny we fear ns evil;
Wi? uaquebae we?ll face the d 1.?


We reached the banka of Lake Wendouree just as the
top horn of the young moon was disappearing in the far-off
horizon, giving to the scone a weird and ghastly appearance,
and several of our party fancied the young queen of night
peeped back once or twice in an unusual sort of manner, as
if to take a parting glance at us. This occurrence had
quite a depressing effect on Stamper and myself as we
reached the door of ? Croesus Villa? in rather a desponding
condition. Through force of habit, we used the knocker in
true professional style, and after a delay of some five
minutes, during which period we had the melancholy
satisfaction of noticing that we were being carefully recon-
noitred through the Venetian blinds, the door was at last
opened, and headed by Mr. Stamper, we entered in single
file. We were five in number, and, taking us as a whole,
by no means a bad-looking Jot; yet the widow seemed
somewhat dubious of our intentions. Our leader went
through some mummery intended for an introduction and
apology for the unseasonable hour of our visit, but nobody
paid any heed to him, and when we had seated ourselves an
awkward pause ensued. After a little, one of our party
remarked in a defiant sort of a tone, that the situation of
the widow?s bouse was extremely picturesque, and enquired
whether it was usual for the moon in her younger days to
sometimes turn back after setting, to have a parting glance
at the enchanting scene. He was about to describe the
singular phenomenon we had witnessed, when he was
severely pinched in the leg by the friend who sat next to
him ; and again a solemn silence ensued. I suppose by
this time the widow began to suspect our sanity or sobriety,
or both ; things were looking queer indeed, when the musical
member of our party requested to be allowed to try a tune
on the piano, which stood invitingly open. He seated
himself at the instrument, and rattled off several vulgar


pieces, and then volunteered to sing us a song of his own
composing. To this the company readily agreed, and we
were favored forthwith with some ten or a dozen stanzas of
wretched twaddle, more or less mixed up with slang, and all
in favor of irrigating the human intellect with preparations
of alcohol. I only remember the refrain, which is a fair
sample of the whole, and it was given with great gusto.
Here it is?
? Then fill up your pint-pots with Murton and Leggo,
For the cares of this life we don?t care a fig, O ;
Let us drink and be merry, and laugh while we can,
For life at the longest is only a span.?
The widow being a staunch teetotaller, our friend was
not encored, and harmony came to an abrupt close.
It so happened that the Evening Flambeaux was on the
table, and the large type of the latest European telegram
caught Stamper?s eye, and ho read it aloud with fine
emphasis and effect, particularly that portion which stated
that ? money was exceedingly plentiful, good investments
remarkably scarce, and that a glut in the market was
anticipated.? This was a theme of deep interest to the
whole of us, and each had a few remarks to offer. One
declared that this was a state of things he had long sighed
for in vain ; while another opined that, could he but raise
the requisite funds by hook or by crook, he would pay a
visit to the dear old laud and leave his bones there ; whilst
a third observed that the old country must be greatly
changed indeed since he took himself off, as he had scarcely
had a coin to bless himself with during the twenty years he
had slaved like a nigger in that boasted laud of liberty. Fred
declared that he would at once communicate with his friend,
the hon. member for Sale, with the view of having the
exportation of gold immediately stopped, seeing it was so
plentiful at home and so jolly scarce here. At this stage


of the proceedings the witty member of our party saw an
opening and seized it. He wanted to know which was the
best represented constituency in the colony. All of us
having given it up, ho declared there were most members for
Sale. This joke put the widow in good humor, and she
laughed for several seconds. Mr. Fred seized the oppor-
tunity, and spoke bluntly, and amid breathless silence, as
follows : ?? Mrs. Blank,? said he, ?we have called for the
loan you promised to let us have.? The widow smiled
graciously, put a question or two regarding our available
security, which was satisfactorily answered (being in fact
a mortgage of our screw by means of the well-known XX
form), stated her interest, which was by no means exorbitant,
and we at once accepted. The cheque was immediately
forthcoming, and after partaking of a modicum of raspberry,
we took our leave, highly delighted with the result and the
kind treatment we had received, but regretting a little that
we didn?t go in for twice the amount we asked for and
obtained, but resolved never to be backward in getting
another advance when circumstances required it. I am
sorry to say the good-natured lady lost heavily by making
advances of this sort, and will not now listen to a first or
last appeal. Having duly ? wetted? the transaction (our
friends declared the lady had been conquered by force of
numbers) we separated, fully resolved to start for Melbourne
per Cobb and Co.?s coach at 6.30 on the following morning.


CHAPTER 11.
? John Gilpin kissed his loving wife;
Right glad was he to find.
That, though on pleasure she was bent,
She had a frugal mind.?
The name of Cobb and Co. for the last eighteen years,
or probably more, has been ? familiar in our mouths as
household words.? From the beginning of its days even to
the present time, I have known it ?have seen the illustrious
Cobb himself, and that?s more than everyone can say;
indeed, many imagine that Cobb is a myth ?but that?s a
mistake. I saw him once at Bendigo, I think sometime in
the year 1864 or 1865, and I have good reason to believe that
he is still alive and prospering. lam under no pecuniary
obligations to the firm, have always paid the fare demanded,
and grumbled like others, inwardly, that it was enormously
high, yet at this late hour I would like to pay Cobb and
Co. a compliment. They may neither see nor hear of it,
but it matters not to me. King Cobb commenced his reign
when the colony was little else than a wilderness ?rather a
pleasant sort of wilderness it must be admitted ?but there
were no roads, or, more properly speaking, too many of
them. I have trudged through the Black Forest when
the track was four or five miles wide, and when it was no
uncommon occurrence for the journey between Melbourne
and Bendigo, with a team of either horses or bullocks, to
occupy about the same length of time as a voyage from
England to Australia by an ordinary smart sailing craft;
for the pedestrian to accomplish the journey in less than a
week was looked upon as something marvellous. This state


of things existed when the great magician Cobb appeared,
on the scene, and time and space seemed, comparatively
speaking, to be annihilated. I have it on the best authority,
viz., the Post-Office officials, that Cobb and Co. have always
kept much better time in delivering the mails thau our
railways. Then, lam sure every colonist will bear cheerful
testimony to the safety of travelling by these coaches. In
the old days of bush tracks, when an inch either to the one
side or the other would have brought the wheel in contact
with a stump or tree, smashed the vehicle, and damaged or
killed the passengers, an accident was scarcely ever heard
of; indeed, the skill of Cobb and Co.?s drivers has been a
theme of admiration to all who have witnessed it. In these
days, when the grand iron horse is gradually superseding
Cobb and Co., and sending him to fresh fields of enterprise,
let us remember the firm with gratitude, and when there is
a choice between road and rail, give it the preference. And
now, craving the pardon of my readers, I resume my story.
About five o?clock on a clear frosty morning I was astir
and making preparations for my journey. I had slept but
little during the night, as I had been musing on the scenes
I was about to witness, almost with the enthusiasm of my
schoolboy days. More than twenty years ago I had
tramped the journey with a heavy swag on my back, and
even under these adverse circumstances the beauty and
variety of the scenery were deeply impressed on my memory,
and I had often looked forward to the time I might see it
again. At about six o?clock I reached the coach office, and
in a very short time was joined by my friend and com-
panion, Fred Stamper. He was in the highest possible
spirits, as he imagined that he had just accomplished a
remarkably smart piece of business; he had, in fact, pre-
vailed on Mrs. Stamper to travel by rail, ostensibly on
account of the interesting state of her health, but in reality


because he wished to bo free from family troubles and
anxiety during the trip. We congratulated each other
heartily on the splendid appearance of the morning, and then,
with great glee, he explained the arrangements ho had
made for our mutual comfort on the voyage. After we had
separated on the previous night he had negotiated our
cheque, bought a splendid fish, had it beautifully cooked
and carved into portable slices, with bread, butter, &c., for
immediate use; nor was the liquid portion neglected, a
bottle of the best colonial wine, accompanied by an
ingenious appliance for serving it out, was exhibited with
pardonable pride. I was so much pleased with the judicious
conduct of my friend that I immediately appointed him
treasurer and purveyor for the whole time we should be
from home ; an arrangement I would strongly recommend
to intending excursionists similiarly situated. It?s far
better than ? shouting? alternately at hotels you pass ?a
custom which should be abolished, not only on account of
its extravagance, but it leads to more drinking than should
be indulged in. Owing to a recent reduction in the railway
fares, we found when the coach drew up in front of the
office, that we had no chance of being overcrowded ; indeed
there were only three of us altogether, or including the
driver, four all told. The carriage was really a first-class
one, constructed on what may be termed the ? bus? or
saloon principle, seated along the sides and ends, remarkably
comfortable, and capable of containing a great number of
passengers. It was drawn by four splendid horses, and the
?ribbons? were handled by a Jehu who evidently knew
what he was about. He was dressed after the style origin-
ated by our old and dear friend Robinson Crusoe, that is to
say, in a garment composed of the skins of wild ?varmint;?
and he looked a sort of chap that would most probably
prove invulnerable to ? bounce,? and in fact we had no


hesitation in treating him with the utmost respect, without
feeling the least humiliated by so doing. Fred and I, having
carefully deposited our luggage in the boot, perched our-
selves on the box, and presented our wine pistol to the
gentleman, but he declined to ? wet? with us just then, as
it was too early for him. We felt slightly snubbed, but
consoled ourselves with the smallest mouthful by way of
mild protest, and while in the very act of doing so, one of
us was ordered inside, as the vehicle would be improperly
balanced were our arrangements continued, that is to say,
three outs and one in. We knew that remonstrance would
be useless, and as Fred knew that I was particularly anxious
to view the scenery, he consented, somewhat reluctantly, to
obey the directions given; and as the chimes sounded from
the Town Hall, indicating half-past six, we started cn route
for Melbourne. Along Bridge Street we went at a grand
pace, where a few early or probably late ? birds? were
already astir, then up the Melbourne Road, between the fine
avenues of gum-trees which are destined to become a prom-
inent and leading feature of this beautiful town, past the
Orphan Asylum, where so many youngsters, but for this
noble institution, might have been miserable outcasts, were
still in peaceful slumber ; under the railway arch, and up
the hill to the Woodman?s Hotel, which we reached just
when the dawn was sufficiently advanced to enable us to
have a view of Ballarat. For eight years I had been a
denizen of the city, paraded all parts of it almost daily, was
proud to call it my home, but never till I looked back on it
this early winter morning did I imagine it half so pretty.
Competent pens will yet, in days to come, do justice to the
view ; mine is far beneath the task, and I shall not attempt
it. Yet, let me say, the city occupies the foreground of the
picture. Churches, villas, houses, &c., intermixed with
trees (a most pleasing picture), and in the background


Lake Wendouree. But this is tame, and I give it up.
Let those who wish to see go to my standpoint, when
the sun is rising, and judge for themselves, and they
will feel well repaid for the journey ; but let me
hasten on. During the few minutes we stopped at the
Woodman?s Hotel, Stamper came out and took possession
of certain refreshments in a hurried manner. I enquired
whether he was quite comfortable, and he answered ? per-
fectly,? and disappeared in an instant. We resumed our
journey, having Mount Warreuheip ahead of us, while snug
farms, market-gardens, schools, and churches, were to be
seen in every direction. Twenty years ago this was a
splendid forest, uniuvaded by civilised man. At Gordons
we had breakfast, and I had the honor and pleasure of an
introduction to the lady passenger who occupied a seat
inside with my friend Stamper. She might have been thirty
years of age, but looked quite young and prepossessing, but
her fine black eyes showed traces of recent tears. Stamper
was particularly assiduous in his attentions, and seemed
almost to have forgotten my existence ; so I ate my break-
fast alone, musing the while on the waywardness of human
nature. Our next change of horses took place at Ballan, a
spot as beautiful as it is prosperous, and destined to become
a very important inland town. After twenty years I failed
to recognise a single landmark, or recall to memory the
bush township of early days. I was fortunate, however, in
having an introduction to one of the oldest residents, who
turned out to be one of the finest old gents I have ever met
with. He treated me most hospitably, and supplied me
with sufficient information to fill several pages were I
inclined to use it. But as we had a spell of considerable
duration here, it would be selfish on my part not to give the
reader time for reflection, and as the most picturesque part
of the journey is still ahead of us, I shall reserve it for the
next chapter.


CHAPTER 111.
He bit my arms, he bit my legs.
And tore my Sunday braws ;
And in the row I lost my watch
?Mong the queer folks o? the shaws.
Balean, charming Ballan, I could have lingered for a week
and enjoyed thy sylvan beauty, but must content myself by
looking fondly forward to the distant future, when circum-
stances may enable me to do so. In the meantime we must
proceed.
The last chapter of my narrative closed while I was
partaking of the bounteous hospitality of the ancient
resident referred to, and it is astonishing when you happen
to be well treated how the scenery becomes more enchanting.
To explain this matter fully would occupy a chapter at the
very least; but then every reader will become a writer some
of these days, and we must temper justice with mercy, as we
hope to have mercy shown to us, and give everyone credit
for being the happy possessor of an imagination at least
equal to our own, and leave them work to do to discover
our meaning and improve it.
Still, my experiences of Ballan were not all of the plea-
santest. When was happiness altogether unalloyed ? In
the course of conversation I happened to mention that I was
probably one of the oldest colonists who had ever rubbed his
knees under my new friend?s mahogany, at Ballan. He
immediately pricked up his ears, and questioned my assertion
in a kind of qualified manner. Said he, ? I can, and will,
stake a �5 note, as a wager, that I introduce you at once to
an older colonist than you are.? Five pounds is evidently


looked upon as a small sum at Ballan. We dived our
bands deep into our pantaloons, but discovered, alas ! that
the requisite amount was not there. We bad appointed
Stamper treasurer, and be was absent,engaged looking after
bis fair fellow traveller. A slight shade, like a passing
cloud, crossed the features of my entertainer, but it was
only momentary, and bo regained bis cheerfulness almost
without an effort. He vanished suddenly, without apology,
and reappeared dragging with him an aged dog of some-
what fierce appearance, albeit he was blind of an eye, and
nearly destitute of teeth. ? This here dog,? said he, ?is
called * Turpin.? He answers equally well to the name of
? Dick,? but Turpin is his proper name. I have had him
for twenty-three years, and he looked as old when I got him
as he does now. He belonged originally to Peter Fairbairn,
the renowned bushranger of these parts, and when Peter
was shot the dog found his way here in search of grub, I
suppose, and I have kept him eyer since. He ?s getting
somewhat ancient as you see, poor brute, but I have not
the heart to kill him. Now, it so happens that a friend of
mine, viz., Jim Grog well, of the Morning Star Hotel,
Daybreak Lane, Melbourne, has a fancy for him, and as the
coach is all but empty to-day, would it be too much trouble
for you to take him along with you? ?but your glass is
empty, my dear sir; come, fill up a bumper to the health of
old Turpin.? We immediately complied, and intimated the
pleasure it would afford us (confounded hypocrisy) to have
so interesting a fellow traveller.
? Right you are, old chap,? said he, ? but I must tell you
the history of Peter Fairbairn, the celebrated bushranger.
Peter was none of your low rascals, who plunder merely
for the sake of cash ; his was the philanthropic mode of
doing business, taking from the rich and ?


? All aboard,? yelled out the driver at this stage of the
conversation, and it was done in tones that admitted of no
delay, so we shook hands with our friend, took possession
of the venerable old colonist, cursing inwardly the while
that he hadn?t had the luck to share the fate of his former
master. We packed him behind our legs, holding fast the
string that was around his neck, and for a while the arrange-
ment seemed satisfactory, and I had leisure to notice a few
passing objects as we proceeded gaily on our way, the most
noticeable, perhaps, being a fine rustic-looking schoolhouse,
just suitable for the site it occupied, and apparently of
ample dimensions for the requirements of the place. I had
seen several of them on the journey, and could not help
thinking that His Honor Judge Stephen had made his mark
as a statesman, and would be remembered with gratitude
when the Sir Jameses, the Sir Johns, and the Sir Charleses
were mouldering in the dust, forgotten. Some short distance
from Ballan we came to a steep and lengthy declivity,
where the slightest mishap would probably have given the
finishing touch to coach, horses, and passengers. As we
descended, the driver requested me to touch the brake on
my side very gently with my foot, and I did so. Our pace
was slow and safe, and Turpin evidently considered it a good
opportunity to make his escape. He leaped overboard
without giving the slightest warning, and having the cord
which held him in custody securely wound around my hand,
he was very nearly taking me with him. We managed,
however, to pull up the coach, and pull him up also; but
the ugly brute became nasty. He had only one or two
teeth left, but evidently knew how to use them. He left
his mark on my hand to begin with, and when I retali-
ated, he became perfectly savage,?tried to throttle me,
and when he failed, bit me on the legs frightfully, and
wrecked irretrievably the Geelong tweeds I had newly


adorned my legs with. When we reached the bottom of
the hill the driver gave him a ? clip? over the snout with
the butt end of the whip, which had the effect of depriving
him of reason, or bringing him to his senses, as he scarcely
moved again till he reached Melbourne.
When you happen to get damaged in the ? rig-out? when
you are far from home, it?s astonishing what a depressing
effect it has on the spirits. You have a fancy that everyone
you meet is scanning you from top to toe, and making
inward comments of anything but a favorable kind. I dare-
sav it?s all nonsense, but the feeling exists nevertheless,
and after my mishap I failed to appreciate the scenery till
wo had travelled a good many miles.
The Pentland Hills are undoubtedly the most interesting
part of the journey, and the view obtained from them is one
of the very best I have seen in the country. From here
you get a glimpse of Corio Bay, and detect a slight sensation
of a sea-breeze. Somewhere near the summit of these hills
we noticed in the distance a human form, seated on a fence,
holding up something in a conspicuous manner, as if he
desired us to stop. We did so when we reached him, and
discovered that he desired to dispose of a magnificent hare.
(I learned afterwards that they abound in this neighbour-
hood). His price was 2s. 6d., and I closed with his offer
at once, intending to make a present of it to my friend
Captain Gaybuck of the volunteers, but as events turned
out I was deprived of the pleasure. The creature must
have weighed some ten or twelve pounds, and the cost
about that of ordinary mutton. Twenty years ago I had
no hopes of a luxury of this kind this side of the equator.
Our next halting-place was Bacchus Marsh. When I
passed through it more than twenty years ago I thought it
one of the loveliest spots I had ever seen. I daresay many
of my readers have noticed the transition which occurs


between a beautiful maiden of seventeen and tbe matron of
thirty, with a family of six or eight children around her.
A like change has come over Bacchus Marsh. A narrow,
ill-made street constitutes the town ; and I looked in vain
for the beauty which had charmed me on the early summer
morning I first beheld it.
My old friend Mr. Crook had vanished, and his famed
hostelry, splendid stables, and magnificent gardens were in
a state of deplorable decay. I recognised the place at once,
but oh, how changed. The little church with the graveyard
round it, w here
? The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep,?
had undergone no change whatever, and must be by this
time abandoned and superseded by the fine edifice ? which
tops the neighbouring hill.?
Melton was our next halting-place, and regarding it there
is nothing particular to chronicle, unless it be that the road
is excellent before you reach the town and after you pass
it, but, strange to say, unmade within the township. But
the surrounding country is still interesting; soil of good
quality, and all apparently appropriated. After leaving
Melton we are all on the qui vive to get the first glimpse of
Melbourne, nor have we long to wait for the gratification.
? The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces?
can be dimly discerned, also the Bay and shipping, so
interesting to an inland dweller. Keilor Road is soon
reached, where we again change horses and make but a
brief stay ; and so eager are w r e now to reach the great city
that surrounding objects are completely overlooked; our
eyes can see but Melbourne and nothing else. Keilor
itself is passed by almost unnoticed, and the excitement
increases with the rate of travelling until Flemington is
passed, and we make our entrance to the famed metropolis
of Australasia. But my first impressions and adventures
will require a separate chapter.


CHAPTER IV.
? On this I ponder, where?er I wander,
And thus grow fonder, sweet Cork, of thee j
With thy bells of Shandon,
That sound so grand on
The pleasant waters of the River Lee.?
Let them gainsay it who will. I maintain that the
entrance to Melbourne is not so pleasing as the entrance
to Ballarat. I say this not because lam a resident of the
metropolitan goldfield ; but, considering myself a citizen of
the world, I am enabled to give an unbiassed opinion.
Candidly, then, I was somewhat disappointed when I
entered the city, which is justly considered to be one of the
wonders of the world. I was, however, in excellent spirits
during the whole journey, which, with the exception of my
misadventure with old ? Turpin,? had been one of the
pleasantest I had ever enjoyed. The road had been
splendid the whole way, and the scenery varied and
beautiful?the fare only seven shillings and sixpence.
Never was money laid out to better advantage.
Punctually to the minute we were due we pulled up at
the General Post-Office and delivered our mails, which had
been gradually accumulating as the journey progressed.
During the short stay we made here I had time to observe
the stupendous changes which had occurred since 1852, the
d- te of my arrival in the colony. At that time the post
office was a wooden structure, about the size and design of
a squatter?s house in the early days, and now to gaze on the
splendid edifice I beheld almost filled me with aw T e. The
only defect I observed was the tower, which appeared stumpy


and unfinished. We turned into Bourke Street, and the
most casual observer cannot help being impressed with the
sights and sounds which he sees and hears; the never-
ceasing roar of traffic, the undistiuguishable yells of cabmen,
and the varied calls of the vendors of all sorts of wares,
make the senses of the inland dweller feel like giving way
by the first contact with a scene so wonderful.
We pull up at the Albion Hotel, the office of Cobb and
Co. I remembered the Albion of the olden time, as it was
here I put up the first night I landed in Melbourne. On
that memorable occasion the house was crammed with lucky
diggers down for a spree, and we ? new chums? were any
thing but welcome guests. The cost of sleepingroom on
the floor, if I remember right, was five shillings, and supply
your own blankets; even then the landlord considered
that you were under great obligations to him, and if you
didn?t do a good deal in the way of liquor, he was not
over civil. The Albion is on the same site still, but it is a
different house from the Albion of my early recollections?
but on these we must not at present dwell.
My friend Stamper emerged from the inside of our
vehicle, loaded with the luggage of his fair companion, and
he called out to me to see after ours, and he would meet
me again in a short time. He was immediately joined by
the lady traveller, and before you could have said ? Jack
Robinson,? a tall, black-a-vised gentleman had Fred by the
? scruff of the neck? with one hand, while he seized a
carpet-bag and hand-box with the other. Now my friend
is not only one of the most gallant of our species, but he is
brave as well, and this style of thing didn?t suit him. He
dropped the balance of the luggage the stranger had left
him with, and getting himself into an attitude of defence,
demanded a reason for the treatment he had received. I
kapt from the box in an instant, with the view of rendering


assistance to our lady fellow traveller, who had screamed
fearfully, and was exhibiting symptoms of fainting. In
Bourko Street it is the easiest thing in the world to collect
a crowd, and probably a hundred of all sorts and sizes of
men, women, boys, and girls, including a few policemen,
were around us in an instant.
I had scarcely reached the lady when a precocious urchin,
with a bundle of newspapers under his arm, and a knowing
grin on his ? mug,? addressed me in these startling words
?? Hi! Mister, your dorg?s bolted with a rabbit in his
mouth.? I looked around, and, horrible to relate, there
was old Turpin bolting along the street at his best speed
with my magnificent hare in his mouth. There was no time
for thought or hesitation, so I dashed after him without a
moment?s delay down Bourke Street and up Elizabeth
Street. To get back to Ballan, with provision for the
journey, was evidently his intention ?mine, to prevent him.
Owing to the nature of my vocation I am always in capital
training for a smart run, and as Turpin was weighted to the
extent of some 121b5., I was gaining on him rapidly, when,
shocking to tell, a youth of the larrikin species put his leg
neatly across my track, and tripped me up as clean as could
be desired. I was much shaken by the operation, and, what
was of greater importance, my garments were greatly
injured. My Geelong tweeds were, I fear, not genuine, as
they burst, not only in the knees, but in parts delicacy
forbids me to mention. I had scarcely time to notice my
sad condition, when I found myself suddenly in the pro-
fessional grip of a party in blue, with an X conspicuous on
the frout of his cap. ? Faix,? said he, ? but you?re a great
runner entirely, entirely.? A tremendous crowd gathered
around us as if by magic, and I could hear the enquiry,
made in every quarter, ? What?s he done p? What has he
done? Liberty is the most cherished privilege of every


Britisher, and my first impulse was to regain mine. I
demanded instant release, and threatened to report the
outrage at headquarters. The party in blue only laughed,
and wanted to know whether I would go along quietly, or
whether I preferred these (exhibiting at the same time a
pair of ; but the name is too dreadful to remember ;
a kind of improved hobbles they looked like). ? We?ve
got your mate safe enough,? said he, ? and you are wanted.?
I made a desperate effort to free myself, but without
avail; the person in blue held me like a vyce, and vowed in
very choice Hibernian that if I was determined to resist him
in the discharge of his ? dooty,? he would make it a caution
to me. This looked serious, and I began to admit inwardly
that I had got into a very nice fix indeed. A kindly-
looking female, who probably had experience of this sort
of thing, advised me to submit, and I would be much more
leniently dealt with by the ? beaks,? as I understood her to
call them. On the whole the advice seemed sound, and
being unable on the spur of the moment to think of any
thing better, I declared my willingness to proceed to the
quarter at which I was ?wanted;?? and so,accompanied by
a large and interested crowd, we retraced our steps to the
Albion. Here, in a quiet room in the back part of the
hostelry, we found Stamper, Mrs. Stamper, the black-a-vised
gentleman, and our lady companion of the journey. They
had each a liquor before them, and seemed in capital humor,
laughing immoderately at my dejected appearance and
singularly unpleasant adventure, and the black-a-vised
gentleman having requested me to join them in a glass of
something to drink, proceeded to give me an explanation of
the scene I had witnessed. It appeared that on the previous
evening he had been at a mining meeting where a dividend
had been declared, and being the first he had ever got in
his life, he had returned home slightly ? elevated.? Now it


so happened that ho overlooked the important fact that the
best bedroom in the house (his own) had been given up to
a young lady visitor, and quite naturally, and by the purest
accident, he opened the door and stepped in in his usual
quiet manner. But the young lady, being but a light
sleeper, awoke in a terrible fright, screamed out, and
brought the wife ou the scene, when an awful donouemeut
ensued. The enraged lady (the wife) would hear no
explanation ; vowed she would start to Melbourne that
very night if she should tramp it the whole way, and place
herself under the protection of her parents. This was the
substance of the story, although it was spun out to groat
length, and the result was the lady travelled by coach, being
somewhat short of funds, while the husband travelled by
rail, and was waiting for us when we arrived. He being,
like his wife, of rather a jealous disposition, imagined my
companion Fred must have eloped with his better half, and
hence his rude conduct; but, as he remarked, ? all?s well
that ends welland his wife had by this time seen her
husband?s conduct in its proper light, regretted her flight
and agreed to return. Of course I was released, and on
receiving an ample apology from the party with the con-
spicuous X on the front of his cap, we had a second edition
of liquors all round, and parted on the most friendly terms.
CHAPTER V.
? Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fancy : rich, not gaudy ;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.?
Refreshed inwardly at the Albion, and renovated out-
wardly at the ? Grand Universal Clothing Emporium,? 1
could have called on my acquaintance of twenty years ago,


Tom Gaybuck, but decided to postpone my visit to the
following day. I had learned that Tom had got on remark-
ably well in the world, married a lady of mature years and
valuable property, and was now a territorial J.P. Let us
pretend to despise wealth and position as wo will, wo must
secretly admit that it has a tremendous influence on almost
every action which makes up the sum total of our lives. It
was at the Ovens in 1853 I became acquainted with jolly Tom
Gaybuck, and it was he who first led me into extravagance.
Some bit of jollification we were having one evening over a
slice of luck we had encountered, and the stimulants having
got used up, Tom suggested a shake in the hat for an
additional supply. He was let in himself to begin with, but
unfortunately the matter did not end there, the winners
insisting on another shake, leaving the loser out; and the
end of the affair was that each of our party was in for his
bottle of gin, which was at that time the modest figure of
30s. per bottle, and to judge from the appearance of us all
on the following day I should say the quality was scarcely
commensurate with the price ; but the scarcity of the article
made it both sweet and precious, and we all survived. I
thought of these scenes of the olden time, and the proba-
bilities of a hearty welcome, but decided to ? take mine ease
at mine inn.? Economy being one of the leading features
of my trip, I had provided myself with the address of an
hotel called the Exchequer, situated in Queen Street, said
to be particularly suited to a gentleman of my habits and
circumstances. My friend Stamper had gone off with his
wife to some relatives? abode, so I was alone in the great
metropolis ?alone in the crowd, unheeded, uncared for, left
to my own resources, a mere drop in the sea of human life
surging around me. With my limited luggage in my hand,
and my Regent Street tile perched at an angle to indicate
that I was by no means the flat some people might imagine


me, I proceeded leisurely in the direction of the Exchequer
Hotel. Melbourne is most probably more familiar to my
readers than to myself, and I will therefore not attempt any
detailed description, only having seen it when there were
more blanks than buildings on the principal thoroughfares ;
when a few minutes walk placed you in the bush, and
when deep and dangerous ruts abounded in the best streets;
when a choice allotment could have been had for a few
pounds, worth probably a thousand guineas now for every
shilling it would have cost then ; under these circumstances
your feelings become difficult if not impossible to describe.
To lose yourself in Melbourne would be all but impossible,
were you even to try. The long straight streets, intersecting
each other at right angles, enable you to steer your course
without the slightest difficulty?and I easily found Queen
Street. Here I discovered more old landmarks than I could
have expected. 'The old Queen?s Theatre still remains, and
the Cape Town Boardinghouse, where I stayed a fortnight,
over twenty years ago, is but little changed, except in name.
The St. John?s Tavern is also to the fore, and many more
familiar objects of deep interest to every old colonist; indeed,
I believe this part of the great city has undergone the least
change of all, and I felt myself more at home than I could
have expected. I was delighted to find that the Exchequer
Hotel was situated almost opposite my old boardinghouse,
and, judging from outward appearance, it seemed just the
quiet, unostentatious place to suit me. I therefore entered
the bar without hesitation, and finding a person of some-
what seedy appearance in charge, I enquired whether he
was the landlord. His answer was not very distinct, but I
resolved to put him to the test at once, as I had been given
to understand he was a ? brother? of mine. I belong to
the ? Undaunted Universal Modern Independent Order of
Eumfellows,? and proceeded to give him the sign, the


countersign, the twigmedyeaee, and offer him the grip as
well, but instead of the brotherly recognition I expected>
the person yelled out, ? Bridget, are you there sure, tell
the mistress to come here at once ; there?s a cranky man
in the bar.? I hastened to explain the pantomime I had
just performed, and enquired whether he was not the Grand
Gog of the Boomerang Lodge of my Order. I had some
difficulty in making him understand me, but at length
succeeded. He then told me that he was not the person I
had mistaken him for ; that, in short, the Grand Gog had
departed this life more than a year ago, and that the house
was now kept by his widow, as fine a body as ever breathed ;
as for himself, he was only a servant in the place. Having
expressed a wish to see the lady, she was at once sent for,
and from her kindly-looking face and simple manners I felt
satisfied that I would be quite at home under her roof. In
answer to my enquiries regarding accommodation, she
regretted that unless I consented to sleep in a room con-
taining another lodger, she would be unable to supply my
wants. In the olden time this sort of arrangement was
considered no hardship, and I expressed myself satisfied,
was shown the bedroom, deposited my carpet-bag, and
having learned that tea would be ready at six, I sallied
forth for a ramble. I had read frequently of ? doing the
block,?and 1 considered that a good opportunity for doing it,
and having ascertained its whereabouts, soon found myself
on the famous promenade. It seemed to me that each
building I passed had been designed to eclipse its neighbour
in magnificence, and had generally succeeded. I remember
in the olden time the streets seemed to me most uncommonly
wide, but now as I strolled leisurely along, the impression
no longer existed ; the enormous traffic of the present day
requires all the space, and is often inconveniently crowded.
Twenty years ago it was a hazardous matter to venture


abroad with a belltopper on your head, as at every turn
you would be almost certain to be insulted ; but now the
exception is to be without one. The blue serge shirt, braced
rouud the middle with a belt, was looked upon as a sort of
full dress, but now tho finest broadcloth, done up in the
very latest fashion, is the every-day rig-out of a very large
proportion of the citizens of Melbourne. My early recol-
lections of a comfortable trap for family use was a spring-
cart ; the proprietor of a dog-cart was looked upon as a
swell of the very first water; and now, as I pace the block
this afternoon, in the year of grace 187-1, what do I behold ?
Equipages of the most elegant pattern, with their splendid
pairs, their coachmen and footmen in livery ; in short, all
the paraphernalia pertaining to the ancient aristocracy of
Old England. With regard to the ladies, naturally, I
should have noticed them first; but the olden time furnishes
me with no comparison ; they were very scarce in those
days, since I only remember one. She was some relation
of my boardinghouse-keeper, and was a great attraction
and ornament to his establishment. She dressed simply }
and wore her own hair, was considered pretty, and refused
on an average some twenty offers of marriage daily. She
cost me a few pounds for the theatre and a gold ring, but I
had no show with her; and my mates were equally unsuccess-
ful, although we could have cut each other?s throat to have
secured her. The ladies are now plentiful enough, but
they no longer rely on their natural gifts. Those I saw on
the block were completely overloaded and disfigured with
false hair, while their dresses were something wonderful to
contemplate, both as regards cut and cost.
? But here my muse her wings mauu cour,
Sic flights are far beyon? her power.?
Gold is the talisman which has wrought this change on


the formerly insignificant town of Melbourne, and its
manners and customs. I left the ? block? and wandered
in the lanes in search of an old friend, who had long since
abandoned the digging life, and was now engaged at one of
those splendid warehouses which abound in the narrow
thoroughfares. Every now and again I observed the name of
some old firm I had known on the goldfields, known them when
a canvas tent was the warehouse, and �IOO worth of goods
their stock-in-trade; when a digger would have scorned the
idea of changing places with the best of them, but the mer-
chant princes of to-day knew what they were about even then.
Memory, with its load of regrets, can quickly recall the
very size and shape of the stores they then owned, with the
flags floating gaily in the breeze, and the rude tickets
announcing that gold was bought?? Gold, �2 7s. 6d.,
highest price given? Flour, 2s. per lb. &c., &c.
Musing on scenes like these, and after a good deal of
tramping, enquiry, and retracing my way, I found my friend
George ; he occupied the position of porter, or some
such billet, and after twenty years we failed at first to
recognise each other. The best and most faithful mirror
you could buy would not show you the effects of the wear
and tear of time so well as looking an old friend in the face
from whom you have been separated for many years.
CHAPTER VI.
? Where are your old companions trusty.
Of early days, here wont to dine ??
Come, landlord, quick ! a flagon crusty,
Let?s pledge them in the good old wine.?
A.T the conclusion of my last exceedingly interesting chapter
(ahem!) it will be remembered that I had just ?forgathered?


with an acquaintance I had not seen for twenty years. I
referred to him as George , but I see no reason for
withholding the surname, which is ? Sterling we used to
call him ? Sterling? George, and the name described the
man. He is probably as honest a fellow as I have had the
pleasure of meeting with, and when there were no places of
worship on the goldfields, George would insist on reading a
chapter on Sundays for our benefit from the Bible, presented
to him by his mother when he first left his native land. He
was comparatively a young fellow then, and so were we all ;
but it gives me genuine pleasure to state that the ? chapter?
was always listened to with marked attention, and I have
seen strange expressions steal over the faces of our little
party while George was reading?expressions I often fail to
observe in the best regulated churches of the present time.
We ? glowered? (I?m partial to these expressive Scotch
words) at each other for some minutes, dubious as to whether
we were not being mutually imposed -upon, so great was
the change twenty years had effected. His fine curly raven
locks have become an iron-grey, and his magnificent beard
of the same color, and lacking much of its former propor-
tions. He drew from his pocket a pair of spectacles, and
having carefully wiped them, placed them in position, and
made a most careful and protracted survey of my tout
ensemble, whilst during the operation I was musing to my-
self if it could be possible the change could be so great on
me as on him. At this interesting moment one of the
great partners of the firm he was serving under appeared
on the scene, and gave some directions in a peremptory
tone, casting an enquiring glance in my direction, which
plainly meant ? what is your business here ?? George had
only time to whisper that he would be glad to see me at
Grubwell?s boardinghouse, in Queen Street, at eight o?clock
that evening, and dashed off to attend to his duties. I


returned to my hotel, and found the guests assembled
around a well-furnished tea-table, presided over by the
landlady, and, taking them as a whole, they formed as
remarkable a company as I had ever mixed amongst. They
belonged principally to the laboring class, in nearly all its
ramifications, and appeared to be endowed with the fiercest
appetites I had ever seen. The landlady never asked any
one what he would take, but loaded the plates in rotation
and in solemn silence; mine when handed to me contained
sufficient for half-a-dozen ordinary meals, but desirous to
make myself agreeable, I accepted it without a murmur,
and proceeded to acquit myself in such a manner as would
leave the cook no grounds of complaint. Some trust-
worthy writer has been good enough to explain that a little
talk during the operation of feeding adds to the enjoyment
for the time being, and to good digestion afterwards, but
this company did not agree with these maxims, as the viands
were demolished in the most solemn silence ?a silence so
oppressive that I, although a stranger, ventured to break.
Directing a pleasant and affable glance at a party sitting
opposite to me, I remarked that the weather for this time
of the year was exceedingly genial?which indeed was the
case. For an instant his knife was arrested half-way to his
mouth (the knife I may mention was much more popular
in this company than the fork), then he looked rapidly to
his right and left companions, and resumed operations more
earnestly than before, in order, I presume, to make up for
lost time. This was my first and last venture in the way of
conversation during meals at the Exchequer Hotel, and
during my stay I was as silent as any member of the
company.
Agreeable to the appointment I had made with my friend
Mr. George, and having ascertained the number of Grub-
well?s boardinghouse, I proceeded thither punctually at


the hour named. My surprise may be imagined when I
discovered that Mr. Grubwell was the proprietor of the old
Cape Town Boardinghouse, at which I had stayed a fort-
night more than twenty years ago, and the room in which
I met my old friend was the one in which we had been
wont to dine. There was but little change observable in
it; the same old prints occupied the same positions on the
walls, the paper looked dingy and faded enough to have
done duty for twenty years, and the furniture so far
as I can remember was precisely or nearly the same as
on that morning in the summer of 1853, when I ate my
breakfast here prior to starting for Ballarat. I could have
pointed out the positions each of our old party had wont
to occupy at the table, recalled the style of dress they wore,
and the buoyant conversation we used to indulge in. After
a warm squeeze of the hand, George, having noticed my
surprise, allowed me to ruminate for a few minutes in
silence, his mind the while evidently wandering back with
mine to scenes of early days. There were a number of
other persons in the room, but one by one they gradually
left, and we at length became its sole occupants. Then
George suggested that a small taste of something to drink
would not be amiss to celebrate so remarkable an occasion,
a suggestion I readily acquiesced in, and the ingredients
were quickly on the table. It was only colonial beer, but
we are not so fastidious now as we had wont to be. Having
set our pipes agoing, George insisted that I should tell him
the story of my life since we last parted, which I did briefly
and faithfully, insisting in return that he should give me an
account of his doings during the same period, beginning by
letting me know as much as possible concerning our old
mates, and the positions they now occupy. The following
is the substance of what he told me :
Jack Lawson is dead. You remember Jack, who used


to cook such splendid dinners for us on Sundays, and kept
the tent in such apple-pie order that it was the envy of all
our neighbours. He went home and married, came back
again with his wife, set up in the marine store business, and
soon acquired both money and property, but his unfortunate
wife died, and he took to drinking, lost all self-respect,
squandered every penny he possessed, and ended his days
in the hospital.
Tom, or Major Gaybuck as he is now called, has a
handsome villa at South Yarra, and owns a fine terrace in
Melbourne. He is quite a changed man, and the last time
I saw him he gave me plainly to understand that he wished
in future to cut my acquaintance, a hint which was not
thrown away upon me. Alick Duncan is in the Benevolent
Asylum, had a stroke of paralysis which completely in-
capacitated him for work ever afterwards. He pays me a
visit here sometimes and takes dinner with me, but his
heart seems broken, and you can scarcely get a word
out of him. He believes that it will soon be all over with
him so far as the world is concerned, and I feel pretty
sure he is right. Long Tom Overall, who used, you
remember, to frequent the bowling alleys and shooting
galleries till all hours of the night and morning, and when
he came home would cook and eat as much steak or chops
as would have served three ordinary men, is still on the
goldfields, but a mere wreck of his former self, and the last
I heard of him was existing on about three pennyweights
a week; a slight change this from the time when he
thought nothing of spending the price of an ounce or two
of gold in the course of an evening. Peter Small page
is now the owner of a first-class hotel, and quite an
independent man. He is still the same jolly little fellow
he was in the olden time, and every old acquaintance,
whether he can pay or not, is made welcome at his house.


Jim Eupell has gone in for farming on a large scale, some-
where near the Murray. He is married, and has selected
G4O acres each for himself, his wife, and some five or six
children. Fred Pit?you remember Fred, we used to call
him the ? bottomless Pit,? as there was no making him out,
and he was the only miser in our party ?he is now in the
Tarra Bend Asylum, a hopeless lunatic. He lost his reason
in this way: ?Coming down from Maryborough with his
mates, they camped for the night on the plains near Caris-
brook. Pit had a good few pounds weight of gold in his
possession, and fancying he saw some suspicious characters
camped close by, he took the precaution after dark to plant
his gold for security. Now, it so happened that one of his
mates had been abroad looking after the horse, and by
standing close to the side of the animal, was enabled to
watch Mr. Pit without being noticed. It immediately
occurred to this person that it would be an excellent joke
to dig up the treasure, aud retain it in his possession till
after Pit had gone to dig it up in the morning; this was
accordingly done, aud the result was it cost the poor fellow
his reason.
CHAPTER VII.
? Can such things be,
And overcome as like a summer cloud,
Without our special wonder ??
At Grubwell?s boardinghouse, in Queen Street, my
friend George and I had a long sitting. In imagination we
wandered again through the wild bush together in search
of the last new rush, aud, when found, it was generally not


half so good as the one we had left behind us. We traced
our bygone career from Old Bendigo to Mount Korong,
and Irom thence to the Ovens, then down to Melbourne for
a spell and the safe banking of our treasure, then away to
Ballarat, where the great nugget was found at Canadian,
then back again to Bendigo, and, in a month or two, oft* to
Bryant s Ranges ; continually on the move, and like rolling
stones, gathering but little moss. Mourned over the
glorious opportunities we had lost. The tide in our affairs
had not been taken at the flood, and now we have com-
pletely abandoned all hope of its ever returning again. It
was thus we talked the time away till it was nigh midnight,
when George suggested that we should take a walk down
Bourke street. Being anxious to see the great city in all
its phases, both by day and night, I readily assented, and
we sallied forth in search of adventure. Even at this late
hour, when balmy sleep should be having its due, the great
thoroughfare is by no means empty, but the stream of human
life we mix in has become turbid and unpleasant to con-
template. Miserable, frail creatures, unworthy the name
ot woman, dressed in tawdry finery, are there iu scores,
nay, hundreds, intent on plying the shameful trade which
has made them what they are. Of tender years, many of
them are possessed of comely looks, but modesty, woman?s
most attractive gift, is a stranger to them. Others are old-
looking and terribly haggard, although still young in years ;
for the life they lead brings them all prematurely to the
grave. Desperately they strive to assume an appearance of
happiness, but the close observer cannot be imposed upon,
and turns from them with a feeling of loathsomeness, mixed
with pity. The other sex, designated men, are there too in
ample numbers, leering and ogling, and meeting the
advances half way which are so freely offered them. Half
a century ago the untutored savage trod the ground


whereon those scones are now enacted, but his mode of life,
placed in contrast, might well make civilization blush.
Hundreds of ?church-going bells? may be heard every
Sunday morning, and hundreds of sermons may demonstrate
the great need for further missionary efforts among the
heathen of other lands, while we, with the lessons and
blessings of Christianity so freely and fully ours, have these
things in our midst. Let us turn from the picture and
proceed. The bars of the grand hotels are still open, and,
although they are all apparently well patronised, yet I
failed to notice anything like drunkenness. A middle-aged
ccuple, apparently man and wife, from ? Quid Ireland,? as
we discovered, had evidently just taken a toothful more
than was good for them, and were the cause of bringing
our ramble to a premature end. They had been investing
very largely in legs of mutton, and having, most probably,
got them a bargain, considered themselves entitled to an
extra drop of the ? craturthe result being that the
mutton fell on the pavement, and the united exertions
of the pair failed in numerous attempts to get it
balanced properly on their shoulders again. Hie male
party had the inevitable shillalah and tried to make
use of it after the fashion of the Chinese bamboo,
that is to say, by crossing it on his shoulder and hanging
several legs on each end, but somehow he could
not succeed. We stood watching them with much
interest until George had the indiscretion to burst out with
an uncontrollable fit of laughter, and we were immediately
observed. Then in angry tones, and with an accent that at
once proclaimed the nationality, the proprietors of the
mutton demanded to be informed of our reasons for staring
and laughing at them. Being an old volunteer, I called
out in fine stentorian tones, ? shoulder ?legs.? ? Be the
holy St. Patrick, you?d better be taking to your own legs


or you?ll have a taste of this,? said the male party ; and he
emphasised his remarks by flourishing the ? national instru-
ment? in a most unpleasant manner. We endeavoured, as
far as he would give us an opportunity, to appease his rising
wrath, but this seemed to make matters worse, and the
bludgeon came nearer our heads than was either quite safe
or agreeable. A crowd quickly began to collect, and the
?gintleman? was encouraged by the presence of several of his
countrymen, who advised him to let us have a taste of his
shillalah, and they would see that he had fair play. I
whispered to Q-eorge that we had better make ourselves
scarce, and we did so with all possible dispatch ; in fact, we
ignominiously took to our heels, and didn?t stop till we
reached the Exchequer Hotel. Here we refreshed ourselves,
and regretted much that we had the misfortune to meddle
with the mutton party at all, but having got into the scrape,
we should have found some better way out of it than in the
manner described, for, after a glass of P B. hot, we dis-
covered that we possessed any amount of courage, but too
late to be used. It was early morning when we at length
parted ; quietness had at last fallen on the busy streets of
Melbourne ; and with a determination to be abroad again
by daylight, I retired to my double-bedded chamber, fondly
believing that the adventures of the day were over, but
I was mistaken. I found my room without difficulty, having
carefully noted its number and situation, and, on entering,
I discovered that the person who shared it with me was in
bed, and apparently fast asleep. I quietly undressed my-
self, and turned in, but failed to get asleep, and, having
tossed and tumbled about for an hour, I determined to get
up and have a smoke, my usual resource when at home. I
had matches at hand, and soon obtained a light for my small
piece of candle, without making sufficient noise to disturb
my companion. I had hung my vest as I believed on the


bed-post, and I proceeded to search the pockets of it for
my pipe when I was considerably astonished not to discover
the article I wanted but quite a handful of small coins?
threepenny and fourpeuuy pieces?intermixed with a few
shillings. Greatly puzzled at this discovery, I began to
ruminate deeply as to whether I was asleep or awake, and if
awake,howl possibly could have come by so manysmall coins,
when, in an instant, the sharer in my apartment leapt from his
bed and seized me by the throat. ? You scoundrel,? said
he, ? did you think I was asleep ? by the lord Harry I shall
put you on the roads for this. Hand over my money, you
sneaking thief, or I?ll choke you.? He said a great deal
more than this, and all in the same disagreeable strain,
holding me the while in a grasp of iron. I had no chance
of arguing the point owing to pressure on my windpipe, so
I placed the small change in his hand, and by a desperate
effort contrived to shake him off. I could by this time see
that I had made a most suspicious mistake. I had dived my
hand into the pocket of my companion?s vest instead of my
own, and hastened to explain the error I had committed.
Innocent of an attempt to rob any one, I pleaded with
much eloquence in my own behalf, stated the responsible
position I held in the world, and offered to produce
such evidence in support of my statements as must
convince him that I spoke the truth. Fortunately for me,
he was a man open to conviction (rather a rare thing in
these degenerate times), and he received my explanation
good naturedly, and agreed to postpone further action till
the morning. We both turned in again, and having nothing
particular on my mind to disturb its tranquillity, I slept
like a top till daylight, aud when I cast my eyes in the
direction of my companion?s bed, I found to my astonish-
ment that it was empty. At eight o?clock I met him at
the breakfast-table, aud was about to renew my apology


and explanation, but he cut me short by assuring me that be
believed it was all a mistake,laughed heartily over the matter,
and told me to think no more of it. I discovered that he was
a cabman?a very decent fellow?and the small change I
had accidentally made free with was the proceeds of his day?s
work. I had several drives with him through the city and
suburbs, and we became fast friends. Thus ended what
might have proved to be a most serious misadventure, and
the reader is assured that the particulars here given are
substantially correct. After breakfast I had a look at the
Tarra, and the shipping there, and found the river improved
nearly as much as the city, and vessels of great size moored
at its wharves. At 10 a.m. I met my friend Mr. Stamper,
and we resolved to devote the day to business, that is to
say, interviewing members of Parliament and the great
head of the Head Punching Department, with a view to
obtaining promotion ; and the result will be chronicled in
my next and last chapter.
CHAPTER YIII.
? ?Tis not in mortals to command success,
But even the humblest may deserve it.?
I had obtained letters of introduction to the Hon. Jay
Scuttleberry, the new member for Mountainbottom ?
letters from friends who had known me for twenty years,
and who good-naturedly gave me credit for many excellent
qualities I was conscious of never having possessed. The
Hon. Jay had been returned by a very large majority,
although he had been opposed by two local men, viz.,
Messrs. Weaver and Horumug?men who had been iden-
tified with Mountainbottom ever since it came into existence.


Mr. Weaver had made �SOOO in the place, and while trying
to make more, lost all, and was now most thoroughly
qualified for a member of Parliament and the �3OO a-year
hanging thereto; but the electors thought differently,
which showed a great want of feeliug on their part, to say
the least of it. Mr. John Horumug was one of the most
conspicuous residents of Mouutaiubottom?a man foremost
in every public movement, possessed of ample assurance,
and deeply skilled in the mysteries of marine architecture ?
suffered also a moat crushing defeat, and has never alto-
gether rallied since. As a member of the Road Board, he
has shown his horns to every member ; poked them in the
ribs on every possible occasion, and made business in gen-
eral horribly uncomfortable ; even the bit of lunch is not
enjoyed as it used to be Hornmug is under the impression
that his brother councillors didn?t vote for him, while they,
being ? all honorable men,? decline to invade the secresy of
the ballot-box. It was natural then that I should expect
to find the hon. gentleman in an amiable frame of mind,
seeing he had achieved such a distinguished victory, and
although I was disappointed as regards the result of my
mission to him, I was pleased with the man, and left con-
gratulating the electors of Mountainbottom on having
secured such an able and conscientious representative.
(The hon. gentleman is almost certain to read this, and I
mustn?t lay it on too thick).
Stamper and I resolved to be total abstainers till six in
the evening, but the fates, as usual, were against us. We
met with a couple of ? Head Punchers,? good-hearted
fellows, who had often done the amiable for us when they
operated in our locality, and we forgot our resolution in a
moment, and adjourned for refreshment. We had much
to talk about ?present and future prospects, and that sort
of thing?and when we emerged from the ? Rory O?More?


I caught a glimpse of our faces in a glass door as wo passed
out, and was much paiued to notice that there was more color
in them than when we entered. The Hon. Scuttleberry has
a palatial warehouse at the corner of two of the principal
streets, and we had no difficulty in finding it. The day
had advanced by this time ; the great merchant princes had
arrived from their villas in the suburbs by various modes
of conveyance, and Melbourne could now be viewed as
the great business emporium of Australia. Each mortal
unit in the busy throng, whether in rags or glossy broad-
cloth, seemed intent on business, and so were we. For a
moment only we paused before entering to note that there
was no serious defect in our general appearance which
might be put to rights at the last moment, and the final
survey was tolerably satisfactory, so we marched boldly in.
The place was of great size, elegantly fitted up, everything
indicating wealth and prosperity, and although ? a man?s
a man for a? that,? we felt some slight diffidence in intruding
ourselves on the proprietor of so grand an establishment.
The employes were all young men, exceedingly young,
and everything seemed in keeping, the place appearing
quite new, although the firm was an old one.
Having selected a genial-looking face, we enquired whether
the lion, head of the firm was available, and were courteously
informed that he was just then engaged in the counting-
house with Mr. Bogus Brown, M.P., the hon. member for
Browns, and in an aside was whispered, ?the ministerial
whip.? We assumed our most knowing looks on receiving
this important information, and Stamper exclaimed,
? Methinks I sniff the morning air.? The confab between
the two was a lengthy one, but had evidently ended in a
satisfactory manner, as we noticed the hon. member for
Browns emerge from the counting-house with an expres-
sion on his face which plainly indicated success.


The hon. merchant prince was immediately informed that
a gentleman from the country wished an interview ; and I
was ushered at once into his presence. Being fully alive
to the fact that the time of business men is of the very
utmost importance, I presented my credentials and stated
the object of my visit. The hon. gentleman said not a
word, but left me for a moment, and returned with some
hundreds of letters in his arms, and without quitting
possession of them he told me they were all applications
for billets, and that he could do nothing for either of them.
? If,? said he, ? you are laboring under any injustice, let me
know, and I will endeavour to see you righted, but as for
attempting to get you promoted over the heads of your
seniors, notwithstanding your appearance of considerable
ability (here we made our best bow), its a thing I shall
never lend my aid to accomplish, not for the best friend I
have in the world.? And so with expressions of the pro-
foundest regard for each other we parted at once. Stamper
and I then adjourned to the nearest hotel, moistened our
fate, and rehearsed the parts wo were to play before the
great head of our department, to whom with heavy hearts
we wended our way.
Being ?forbidden to tell the secrets of our prison-house,?!
must draw a veil over this part of the proceedings, but may
state that we left the presence of the great man with a
feeling of relief that the dreaded interview was over, and
whilst admitting that he was by no means a bad sort of
fellow, we could plainly see that unless an epidemic of a
fatal character set in in our department and carried off
about half the staff, there was otherwise no hope of pro-
motion for us, and muttering the well-known legend of the
Civil Service ?
? The less you do, the higher the screw,?
we called philosophy to our aid apd abandoned ourselves to


pleasure. TTe got sick of Melbourne before our leave of
absence bad expired, and returned to our homes with empty
pockets and blighted hopes?returned to face our duties and
liabilities ; and dearly as we love our own beautiful Ballarat,
we have to admit that it?s dull compared to Melbourne.
It only ren ains for me now to say an rcvoir to my in-
dulgent readers, and I live in the hope of being with them
again in less than twenty years.


OUR DISTINGUISHED VISITOR.
We were camped on the creek ?that is to say close to the
edge of it?and doing better than ever we had done. We
had left oft' sinking ? duffers? and had taken to rewashing
tailings. It was by the simplest accident we were led to
try our fortunes iu this way. One day, after a heavy
thunderstorm, Jack, one of our mates (we didn?t know his
surname, and never enquired), was crossing over to the
tent, and, having a quick eye, picked up in a few minutes,
about half an ounce of gold and a nice specimen, worth
probably three or four pounds.
The creek I have referred to takes its rise from the Big
Hill, and accepts tribute from Robinson Crusoe and other
gullies before reaching Kangaroo Flat, when it assumes
the dimensions of a very respectable stream during the
wet months of the year When my eyes first beheld it, the
stream was clear as a wimpling ? burn? in Scotland. It
was bounded on each side by beautiful park-like grounds,
thickly studded with the health-giving eucalypti, or, in
familiar phrase, the gum - tree, interspersed with the
fragrant wattle, and on the receding ranges the stringy-bark
found a congenial home. Taking it all in all, pure and
fresh from Dame Nature?s hands, the scene, if not wild and
romantic, was picturesque, and such as well might gladden
the heart of one who sought seclusion ? far from the
madding crowd?s ignoble strifebut the great rush
changed all iu the brief space of one day. The beautiful


green sward was ruthlessly torn up by shovel and pick ;
the quaint and venerable trees were remorselessly felled to
the ground, or set fire to at their roots and cruelly burned
alive.
The solitude which had reigned for ages, or been broken
onlv by the monotonous warbling of the native birds, or
the pregnant with meaning ?cooeey? of the blackfellow, was
suddenly invaded and dispelled for ever.
Within a week the beautiful clear stream was trans-
formed to thick, brown-colored, detestable-looking mud ;
and I well remember seeing on many occasions the
unfortunate crayfish crawling along on dry land, searching
in vain for the pure element which had so long been theirs.
All along the banks of this once pretty stream were con-
gregated eager crowds from almost every clime under the
sun ?black and white commingling?all animated by the
same common desire ?possession of gold, plundering and
desolating fair creation to obtain it. In the background,
habitations of every conceivable description had sprung
up as if by magic, but all of the most fragile and temporary
nature. The calico tent, 6x4 or thereabouts, was looked
upon as quite a luxurious abode, whilst a few sheets of
bark, arranged like the letter V turned upside down, was
by no means to be despised. But even then we had our
distinctions of respectability, and when it came to what is
termed in the ancient native vernacular, a ? mia-mia,? we
conjectured the unfortunate owners had reached the lowest
depths of poverty, and avoided them accordingly. Stores
there were too ; some very large and but little in them,
others small enough, but all stocked about alike. This
consisted of very brown sugar, ? post-and-rail? tea, onions,
sardines, pickles, and flour; also powder and shot, an indis-
pensable commodity in those days, when every digger
carried his firearm. Flags of all colors and of strange


devices waved aloft iu the breeze, and were the recognised
signboards or indicators that something was for sale. Even
the digger, when about to retire or be off to a new rush,
hoisted an old shirt or some substitute for a Hag, to notify
that the implements, &c., he possessed, were being disposed
of at an ? alarming sacrifice.? These were a few ot the many
sights witnessed during the day, and when darkness came
on innumerable camp fires lit up the wondertul scene,
bringing each group of diggers to view in bold and strange
relief, making indeed a scene once seen never to be forgotten-
At intervals the comparative quiet would bo broken by the
dismal groan and crash of a hollow burning tree as it came
to the ground, and the hasty decamping of the dwellers in
its vicinity. Then, in those times, every man discharged
his firearm and reloaded it every night to be ready and in
reliable order in case of emergency.
About fully half the population consisted of persons
having a peculiar gait, as if accustomed to hobbles, and
they were understood, in polite terms, as hailing trom the
? v otherside? (Van D.L.). I must not, however, dwell in
minute detail on the sights and surroundings of those
exciting times (1852), but proceed at once to the strange
adventure I have to relate.
There were four of us mates, and known to each other
only by our Christian names, sometimes prefaced by the
country we hailed from?such as Scottie Dave or Lanky
Jack?the dialect of which clung to us for years,
particularly when out of temper, which would sometimes
happen after a protracted run of bad luck, when
our nationality would betray itself. We were all in the
very prime of life, as indeed was the case with the great
majority on the goldfields ; braving all sorts of hardships
without a murmur, hoping to be rewarded by Dame Fortune
with a ? pile? some day, and thpn to return to our native


homes to live in luxury and ease for the remainder of our
lives.
One beautiful summer evening in December, when
Christmas was drawing nigh, made us think of friends we
used to mingle with, and wonder if we were already
forgotten by ? the girls we left behind us,? and other
interesting matters of a like nature. Our employment
necessitated the use of the gold-scales every evening, and
altogether it was the pleasantest and most profitable time
we ever had on the goldfields ; and the specimens we had
collected would have been a rich acquisition to any museum
in the world. These had been thrown from the hoppers of
the rude cradles unobserved, covered with the thick muddy
water ; indeed, the rough of the gold had only been obtained
by the first process, and a very large percentage left to
reward our industry. On the day I have referred to we
had done better than usual, as the result of our operations
included a nugget weighing over three ounces ; so it may be
conjectured we were in a happy and contented frame of
mind. One of our mates, the senior of us all by a good
few years, belonged to the seafaring profession; his name
was George; his nationality doubtful. It was a remarkable
feature in the combination of mates in those days that one
or two sailors were almost certain to be included.
This, I think, may be accounted for when it is remembered
how many noble ships were at permanent anchor in Hobson?s
Bay in 1852, owing to their crews having taken ? French
leave.? Our sailor impressed us with the belief that at
sometime in the course of his life he had been a skipper,
and, consequently, we all paid great deference to him.
Scarcely a day passed but he would seize some opportunity
to make us aware of the fact that he was at one time
master of the ? Ganges.? He would strike eight bells on
the fryingpan, and suggest that a bottle of gin should be


obtained and grog served out to all hands. It cost the
modest sum of thirty shillings per bottle, and frightful
tack it was too, but George heeded not, but drank the most
of it. He suggested (and his suggestions were almost
commands) that, owing to the good fortune that had crowned
our day?s labor, a double allowance of grog should be
served out to each man, and he would stand one bottle
out of his share in the nugget. His good nature and
generosity did not even end here, but he volunteered to go
and obtain the liquor himself.
Just where a large and well-conducted hotel stands now,
in 1852 its site was occupied by a tent of humble pretentions
and small capacity. A flag was displayed, which the
initiated interpreted as having some reference to the city of
Glasgow.
The ostensible business done was the sale of water,
carted a distance of between six and eight miles, and sold
at Is. 6d. per bucket. But there was something else the
knowing and thirsty ones could obtain there ; something
less pure and far more expensive. Our middle-aged mariner
was well known to the proprietor, and thither he wended
his way, rejoicing, doubtless, in the pleasures of anticipation.
During his absence, which seemed lengthy, our mate,
Donald, a fine stalwart Highlander, gave a dissertation on
the qualities and price of Scotch whisky ; bewailing the
terrible extravagance we were being daily led into, and
vowing that no more of his money would be parted with
for such a purpose. I may mention that a few days
previously, one of our mates, by way of a treat for us, had
invested in a tin of sardines ?price, five shillings?and
Donald had refused to pay his share or partake of the
luxury. His memory of the prices ruling around his
Highland home was too retentive and made him unhappy.
He forgot to compare the Is. Gil. a day he used to earn


with the six or eight pounds which would fall to his share
for the one day?s work he had just finished.
We were getting impatient for the return of George, and
were debating the propriety of two of us going in search of
him, when, to use an expression of his own, he ? hove in
sight,? but not alone ?I mean he had more than the gin
with him. Mounted on a splendid charger, we beheld with
astonishment a gentleman approaching,conversing familiarly
with our mariner mate, and curbing his fiery and impatient
steed, which he sat splendidly, making it keep pace with
the pedestrian, who had the bottle of square carefully tucked
under his arm. Our intense curiosity was very quickly
gratified, and the gentleman introduced to us in duo form
as Captain Fitzhaddock, who had been a passenger in
George?s favorite craft, the ? Ganges,? from London to
Callao, some two years previous to the date of my story.
It appeared the captain had been in the act of partaking
of a glass of water, and insisting that something stronger
should be forthcoming, when our mate appeared upou the
scene, and a mutual recognition was the result. The bond
fides of the stranger having been satisfactorily explained to
the water-merchant, the other liquids in his ? warehouse?
were produced and freely partaken of as a matter of course.
The Captain having dismounted, we discovered him to be
full six feet in height, straight as an arrow, and adorned
with one of the grandest beards we had ever beheld ; indeed
the only part of his face left visible was his forehead, which
was white as marble, while the hirsute adornment was
blacker than the ink I am writing with. His address
charmed us at once; for although evidently far above us
in the social scale, by the gift of his tongue he led us at
once to believe that we were his equals, and all ceremony
was discarded. We invited him to stay with us for the
night, and our offer was cordially accepted. For his


charger, ? Romeo? by Dame, for whom he entertained the
most tender regard, stabling must be obtained at any
sacrifice, so we walked a mile for the purpose, and got trod
on occasionally for our trouble, and found quarters for him
which satisfied his master. After partaking of ? refresh-
ments? at each restaurant on our route, we reached home
about midnight, all charmed with the splendid liberality
and entertaining conversation of our guest. He appeared
a Sir Charles Coldstream in reality; had ? been every-
where, seen everything, and knew everything,? but differed
in this respect, he was by no means ? used up, ? indeed,
when we reached our caboose, he w r as by far the best man
amongst us, and we were all on the best of terms with each
other. He had by snatches during our journey in search
of stabling told us that he had been prospecting, single-
handed, for about six months, and that he had only a few
days ago discovered a goldfield richer by tar than anything
yet dreamt of. He had come to Bendigo for the purpose
of organising a party of the best men he could find (here
he glanced approvingly at us), and also to obtain a supply
of provisions and a conveyance for their transport. No one
knew of this great discovery but himself, and all communi-
cation must be done in darkness and by circuitous routes,
so that no clue to its whereabouts could be made available.
The place, he said, was at the foot of a beautiful mountain,
surrounded by ranges and gullies, which spoke to the
experienced eye of a geologist (here he gently patted him-
self on the breast) in language not to be misunderstood ;
? but this, gentlemen,? said he, ?is the most convincing
proof of all.? We had reached our tent by this time, and he
stripped himself of his outer garment, styled, I believe, a
? poncho,? and we observed, with great admiration, that
he was the happy possessor of two of the handsomest
Colt?s revolvers we had ever clapped eyes on. After


this he rose even higher in our estimation than he had
done before.
The Captain then drew from a small valise samples of
his discovery, consisting of beautiful specimens of golden
quartz, the precious metal largely preponderating. It was
a sight to make a fortune-hunter?s mouth water.
? This, gentlemen,? said he, exhibiting the specimens, ? is
literally sticking out of the ground, and thousands of tons
of it could be obtained almost without any effort.?
He packed up his treasure again, and then we exhibited
ours ?all alluvial, and easily rendered available for sale.
He recognised this fact, but explained that he had picked
up a secret or two in South America, whereby the disinteg-
ration (he had several bigger words than this) of gold from
quartz was rendered as simple as rocking a cradle.
A t this stage he insisted that the empty bottle should be
refilled, the honor of paying for it to be decided by a Peru-
vian process designated ? odd man outand singular
enough our economical mate Donald was ? let in,? and had
to tramp off to the water-merchant?s for it, such being the
conditions of this very interesting game. Being all in a
jolly mood by this time, and seeing in imagination fortunes
beyond the dreams we were wont to indulge looming in the
future, we abandoned ourselves to festivity and song, and
the Captain proved himself the best of us all. He had a
splendid tenor voice and knew how to use it, and, better
still, his songs were mostly of his own composing. Here is
a sample of the one we admired most.
Song of a Prospector.
? Oh, I love to roam, with my tent for my home,
And prospect the wild bush o?er;
With my spade, pick, and pan, each gully I scan,
Where man never dug before.


My hopes are high when a range I spy,
Clad with quart* like shells on the shore }
My tent I pitch on the green sward rich,
Then search for the precious ore.
Then search for,
Then search for,
Then search for the precious ore.?
Under the peculiar circumstances the song somehow got
fixed in my memory, and after a lapse of nearly thirty years
I could reproduce the whole of it; but without the aid of
its talented accompanist and author, its mere recital
appears tame. Long after our usual bedtime, probably
three in the morning, the Captain suggested we should
?turn in.? He seemed mysteriously to have taken com-
mand of us, and exercised a control we could not resist.
We demolished a table in the centre of our tent, the top
of which was a sheet of bark, but it answered our purpose
equal to mahogany, so we removed the fixture, divided our
bedclothing, and made our guest by far the most comfort-
able amongst us. Like Robinson Crusoe, ? being much
fatigued, we slept till morning, and when we awoke it was
broad day.? With aching heads, and eyes not so bright as
on the previous evening, we looked for the Captain to give
him a cheerful ? good morning,? but he had vanished ?like
the baseless fabric of a vision, and left not a wrack behind.?
Before retiring to rest we had carelessly left our beautiful
specimens and bags of gold within easy reach of our distin-
guished visitor, and he had cleared out with the tempting
treasure ?the fruits of our labor for many months ?
amounting in the aggregate to more than �IOOO. Our
first impulse was to lynch our sailor mate, but second
thoughts prevailed, and we hurried off to the place where
the noble steed was stabled. Alas ! we found that man
and horse had gone, nobody knew when or where, but, said


the keeper of the stables, there?s thirty shillings to pay, and
as the other party has gone, I look to you for my money.
We explained our sad condition, and were consoled by
the philosophic words of comfort ho uttered, ?Luckily for
you he didn?t cut your throats, or put a bullet through
each of your heads.? When we have youth and health
for our heritage, we are rich in the best sense of the term;
we had still those blessings left us, and the very uext day
we learned that a splendid new goldfield had been discovered
at Bryant?s Ranges, distant some twenty-five miles; so we
packed up at once and made tracks, buoyed up with some
slight hope that we might overtake the Captain, for we had
scarcely a doubt but that this was the place he had so
graphically described. After a tedious journey, extending
over two days, through country destitute of any track to
guide us (or if there was we failed to find it), we reached
the foot of Mount Tarrangower. We found payable gold
in Long Gully ; saw the golden quartz at Wilson?s Reef,
?sticking out of the ground,? as the Captain had described,
but we never clapped eyes on that gentleman again.
Naturally, we were dreadfully discontented with ourselves
and everybody else for months after the loss we had so
unexpectedly suffered. Long Gully was too long in giving
us a lift, so we moved higher up, and a little to the right ?
there we struck it rich. But we had not yet forgotten
the Captain, and were always grumbling, no matter what
slices of luck fell to our share, and being the discoverers,
the place was named ? Growler?s Gully.?
Often did we climb the old Mount on Sundays, possessed
of the vague idea that in the vast expanse the handsome
Captain and his noble steed might come within the
range of our vision, but the hope was vain; we
never saw him again.
More than a year after the Captain had so neatly


plundered us, one of our mates, who had a brother on the
Californian goldfields, received a paper called the Golden
Gate Gazette. It contained a paragraph conveying in brief
terms the information that a recent arrival from Bendigo,
Van Diemen?s Laud, New Holland, known as Captain
McCraddock, or McHaddock, had, after many narrow
escapes, been finally disposed of by his Honor Judge
Lynch. Time and tolerably good luck had by this time
softened our feelings regarding him, and not one amongst
us expressed gratification that his melodious voice was
stilled for ever, and that such a shameful end should have
been the fate of Our Distinguished Visitor.




POEMS OF THE POST-OFFICE.
LAY OF A HAHD-UP POSTMAN.
A STOET OF THE LONG DEADLOCK.
I saw a sprightly postman, as I sauntered through the town,
With his coat of flaming scarlet, and his pants were grey or
brown;
His boots were brightly polished, and they seemed to be
quite new,
Oh ! he was a dashing postman, looking forward for his
? screw.?
I met this gallant postman when some weeks had fleeted by,
His rig-out seemed quite faded, and a dimness filled his eye.
I said, ? Good Mister Postman, what the deuce is up with
you ??
He shook his head, and answered, ? Why, they haven?t
passed our screw.?
I saw this careworn postman, it was but the other day,
And I kindly made enquiry if he?d yet received his pay.
He fixed me with his wat?ry eye, and seemed to look me
through,
While he groaned, ? These Lords, our masters, still refuse
to pass our 1 screw.? ?


I tried to cheer this postman, who was once so blithe and gay,
But he changed his precious burden, and was moving on
his way,
With his eyes upon those stylish boots, his toes were peep-
ing through,
I said, ? Bear up, sir postman, you are safe to get your
* screw.? ?
? I?m safe to get my screw,? he cried, and raised his droop-
ing head,
? They?ve quite forgot the living now, and care but for the
dead.
The House adjourned another week, *tis most absurd, but
true ;
Because a wealthy man had died, they couldn?t pass our
* screw.?
? My butcher and my baker, they still drive to my door,
But not to learn my daily wants, as in the days of yore;
They come to know the reason why their bills remain o?er-
due,
And hum ! and ha! and shake their heads at the story
?bout my ? screw.?
? Each day at noon my woodman calls, and spoils my mid-
day naps,
I know his footstep far away, and start before he raps.
He wants to know if I can pay, or what I mean to do,
And if his horse and he must starve, while waiting for my
* screw.?
? My wife sits moping all the day, she cannot get to town,
Her hat, it wants a feather, and her ? mantle taking down.?
The Royal Duke will soon be here, if all the news be true,
And all the glorious sights we?ll lose, unless we sight the
? screw.? ?


I said, ? Cheer up, sir postman, never let your courage
shake,
With others you must suffer, when a principle?s at stake.
Your case is hard, I must admit, ?tis hard and doubtless
true,
But * deadlocks? cannot last for aye, and soon you?ll get
your ? screw.?
? Come, drink with me, my postman, drink the Eoyal
Sailor?s health,
He may some day reign o?er us, king of this land of wealth;
Then go ye forth to meet him, and wave your cap of blue,
Let your heart be warm to greet him, though you haven?t
got your * screw.? ?
He seized a pot of ? treble X,? and raised the bottom high,
He quaffed it to the very dregs, and brighter seemed his eye,
He grasped my hand right friendly, and warmly bade adieu ?
Farewell, my gallant postman, may you soon be paid your
? screw.?


MISADVENTURES IN MELBOURNE.
It was in busy Bourke Street my mate and I hung out ?
The landlord said, ? Now since you?re snug, the custom here?s
to shout!?
So we stood a glass of liquor, for himself and lady grand?
Who was decked with gold on ears and neck, and rings on
every hand.
My mate laid down a ? bob? for four (?twas only beer we
had)
The landlord eyed us keenly, and enquired who was our dad!
We told him each a father had, whose names were Jones
and Brown;
Then he kindly asked if ? mother knew we?d ventured down
to town!?
My mate, who knows a thing or two, clenched both his
hands and swore
That we two hailed from Ballarat, and would be cheeked
no more?
For half a gallon ? swanky? there we only pay a ? bob,
And if in town they double charged, he wouldn?t square, by
gob!
The landlord said,? Your carpet-bags are safely stowed away,
And ere they meet your gaze again, you?ll ask me what?s
to pay ;
I don?t suppose they?re overstocked?no more?s your nuts
with brains,
So let?s agree, my country friends, and, look please ?take off
your drains.?


? I?ve heard of Ballarat,? said he, ? ?mongst trees for ever
green,
And most of swells who come from there are very far from
mean;
?Tis said the health is much improved ?neath these ?ere gum-
trees? shade,
Yet every time the fares are lowered vou come here to be
bled.?
My mate looked jolly queer at this, but lugged out half-a-
crown,
He got a scurvy ? tanner? back, and sighed ?? so this is
town!?
Then up and down the streets we roamed, and viewed the
sights so fine,
Till savoury smells from every side soon prompted us to
dine.
We viewed the windows crammed with joints, displayed
with skill so rare ?
? Here, dine for sixpence on the best,? proclaimed each bill
of fare;
At last we ventured boldly in, for hunger led the way ?
We?d journeyed by the early train, and fasted half the day.
Such tempting soup, with foreign name, we tried a third
supply;
And, like the ancient mariner, ?we fixed the waiter?s eye.?
My mate, who knows a thing or two, chose dainties rich
and rare,
And marvelled how for sixpence they could furnish up such
fare.


The waiter proved a gentleman, and asked what wines we?d
choose:
He named a list; though Greek to us ?we went in for a
? booze.?
Then each a sixpence slowly drew, and placed both in his
hand,
With thanks profuse he dubbed us then the best chaps in
the land.
With grateful hearts we seized our hats, our ? pins? felt
rather queer,
And shaping for the entrance door, a voice cried, ? you pay
here.?
Aghast we stood, like men in dreams, whilst new light on
us shed,
The voice explained, our little bill was thirteen ? bob?
ahead
One night in town was quantum suf, no sleep could we
obtain,
Our window opened through the roof, and down poured
heavy rain;
Whilst something (which I dare not name) kept tickling
us in style?
And now in troubled dreams at home, we murmur ? bless
Argyle!?


A HANDSOME CHEISTMAS-BOX.
On ! such a handsome Postman came to our cottage door,
And such a thundering knock he gave?it shook the roof
and floor;
?Twas on the morn of Boxing-day, he asked Papa to see,
His ? little game,? a Christmas-box?Pa said he?d give him
CHORUS.
Oh ! Postman, dear, you?ve nought to fear?
Take Papa at his word,
Then you shall be my cage, sweet Jove
And I will be your bird.
Each day I watch my postman, all through the ?netian
blind,
With his stately gait, his manly front, and his canvas bag
behind ;
He smiles and bows to pretty girls, and oft they smile
again?
My heart, I fear, is breaking fast ?my tears they fall like
rain.
CHORUS.
Oh ! Postman kind, you can?t be blind?
Why don?t you look at me ?
Do take me for your Christmas-box,
And happy we shall be.


I care not for jour ? Corner? gents, with all their hoards
of gold,
Nor yet for stuck-up banking clerks, though cast in finest
mould,
Give me my sprightly Postman, with his coat of scarlet gay ?
Let him take me for his Christmas-box, he?ll ne?er repent
the day !
CHOBtTS.
Come Postman straight, why should we wait ?
I?m twenty-one come May ;
Take Papa at his jesting word?
PR name the happy day.


THE FATE OF TOM TROTTER.
Oh ! sad was the day when Tom Trotter was missed from
His post at the Post-Office where he?d grown grey ;
The service he?d rendered his Queen and his country,
Could not his hard fate avert or delay.
He was crossing the street, whilst trying to decipher
A cramped superscription held close to his eye,
When a raving mad bullock clapped eyes on his red coat,
And bellowed a great oath that Trotter should die !
Then, straight as an arrow he bore down upon him,
And pierced with his horn that brave manly breast;
Poor Trotter, the postman, was sent to his Jong home,
His scrip all unsold, and his sins unconfessed!
In a quiet shady nook, where in spring the acacia,
Loads with its fragrance each soft passing breeze,
His grief-stricken comrades laid his poor body,
Then slowly and sadly went home to their teas!
At the still hour of midnight, a dreadful commotion
Was caused by a series of loud double knocks,
The horrified inmates rushed to their street doors?
The gents in their night caps, the ladies in ? smocks !?
The moon was descending o?er Lake Wendouree,
And ghastly and pale shone her last setting ray?
When there, in the dim light, was Trotter the postman,
Skipping over the old walk as if it were day.


His red coat looked fiery, his beard rather singed,
And a strong smell of brimstone was left in his wake;
It was sad to conjecture ? Auld Cloutie? had claimed him,
For Tom, in his youth, was a terrible rake.
And oft when the town clock rings forth from its tower,
The knell of a day that has joined those before,
The ghost of Tom Trotter is seen on his old beat,
And loudly resounds his bold knock as of yore.
Note. ?Readers are informed that Mr. Thomas Trotter is still
alive and hearty, a trusty officer in the department, and respected by
all who know him.? Author.


LITTLE DATE.
IN MEMORIAM.
He rests near the beautiful lake, dear,
Where often he gambolled of yore,
And his sleep will be long now, and quiet, love ?
On earth we shall see him no more !
When a footstep?s heard at the door, dear ?
Oh! it saddens my heart, to see
The expectant light in your eye, love,
For a sight that never can be.
Ev?ry unkind word that we spoke, dear,
Comes keenly back from the past,
And we?ll treasure long in our memories, love,
Those words little Dave murmured last!
How you?re longing to hear his voice, dear,
And his words so strange and new,
Which often beguiled your cares, love ?
And those cares have not been few.
Put away his marbles and toys, dear,
And the little hat trimmed so gay ;
Put aside his bat and ball, love?
Our darling has ceased to play !
But we?ll meet little Dave again, dear ?
It is promised by One ever near,
That little ones such as he, love,
Inherit the bright happy sphere !


? GOOD-BYE!?
LINES TO MISS ON LEAVING BALLARAT.
Tor ask me to write, and I?m grieved to comply,
When the theme I must choose is the sad one ? good-bye!?
Let me claim as the years circle over your head
That in some leisure moments my lines may be read.
Will those bright eyes of thine scan the words I have wrote
When half of this world?s hard battle?s been fought?
Then let one flitting gleam o?er your memory steal,
And confess that our friendship was lasting as real.
Oh! ?tis not as of yore, when each impulse was youug ?
When love could inspire both my pen and my tongue,
Yet friendship when true is a gem ever pure,
A nd where love has proved false has been known to endure.
In life?s varied rounds each day hath its task,
And ?twould cloy were we always in pleasure to bask ;
Though we may not achieve all we fondly desire,
Yet ?Nil Desperandum,? nor cease to aspire.
How oft hath the morning broke cloudy and grey ?
When ushered?yet changed to a bright sunny day ;
Fortune?s wheel turns round, not a moment stands still?
We may baffle e?en fate if we work with a will.
Then ?good-bye,? and where?er your lot may be cast,
Let us still be the friends we have been in the past ;
When life?s journey?s ended, and all our tasks o?er,
In that bright land above may we meet on its shore.


THE CHAP WHO OWNS THE i? vV
A PATHETIC BALLAD.
Air ?? Coming thro? the Rje.?
He used to be a jolly brick
As you would wish to see,
His witty chaff and merry laugh
Were quite a treat for me.
But what a change a year has wrought;
How weary seems his pins,
And deepest care o?erclouds his brow,
The chap who owns the twins.
He used to dress in swellish style,
And sport a massive chain;
His linen too seemed always new,
Devoid of crease or stain.
But now all?s gone, I won?t say where,
He?s suffering for his sins;
I?ll not describe his present garb?
The chap who owns the twins.
He used to scan the mining news,
And brightened oft with glee,
To note a rise in scrip he held,
And profits large made he,
But now each ? spec? he ventures in
Its downward course begins ;
?Twould pay each board to buy him out?
The chap who owns the twins.


He used to take a share iu ? sweeps,?
And often gained a prize ;
But now his ? nag? comes in the last ?
He never makes a rise ;
And when he plays at crib or whist,
?Tis rare indeed, he wins;
I?d bet against him every rub?
The chap who owns the twins.
He used to till his garden well,
And splendid produce grew;
But now the slugs devour each plant
Whilst steeped iu morning dew.
His fruit-trees too, with blight are blue,
And all his outs and ins
Proclaim the misery of his lot?
The chap who owns the twins.
He used to boast about his fowls,
Of Spanish breed were they ;
And all the winter months so cold
Would breakfast him each day;
But now, alas! they eat his grub,
And laying time begins,
When eggs in thousands meet his gaze?
The chap who owns the twins.
He used to romp and flirt a bit,
With ev?ry pretty maid ;
But now he looks askance at them ?
He?s grown so old and staid.
Their charms can no more win his smile,
They might as well be gins;
He hates the sight of womankind?
The chap who owns the twins.


Ho used to steer a straight course home,
Nor lingered by the way ;
But now his paths are devious grown,
In lanes he loves to stray.
He?ll scud along each lonely track,
Regardless of his shins ;
He turns back on friend and foe ?
The chap who owns the twins.
He used to snooze on Sunday morns
Till close on time to dine,
Then saunter forth among his flowers
When summer days were fine ;
But now he?s up before the dawn,
O?er hill and dale he spins,
In search of peace and quietaa� he goes
The chap who owns the twins. ?


MEMORY WAFTS MY THOUGHTS TO THEE.
How, Liza, darling, can you chide,
When I have crossed the raging main ?
You say I?ll seek some other bride,
And ne?er return to thee again ;
I wander here in crowds alone,
?Mid brilliant throngs I mingle free;
In this wide world I love but one,
And mem?ry wafts my thoughts to thee.
Those downcast lids on tearful eyes,
And cheeks all pale?from blushes free ;
Can I forget our fond good-byes,
Or cease one hour to think of thee ?
In this bright land are maidens fair.
But all their charms are nought to me ;
There?s none with you can e?er compare,
When mem?ry wafts my thoughts to thee !
Oh, Liza, dear, this town is fair,
?Mid beauteous landscape spreading round,
And, near at hand, are gardens rare,
Where flowers in loveliest hues abound;
A lake is here, which well might vie
With fairy spots on southern sea ;
And yet, e?en here, I pine and sigh,
When mem?ry wafts my thoughts to thee!


Oh ! wert thou here to view the scene,
And roam with me at morn or eve,
Oft resting ?neath th? acacia green,
For friends and home you?d cease to grieve;
Here rustic seats in shade and sun
Adorned by flowering shrub and tree;
Here oft I rest to muse on one,
And mem?ry wafts my thoughts to thee!
Those sweet-toned bells from lofty tower
Proclaim how swiftly time goes by,
Yet here I linger many an hour,
And fondly wish that thou wert nigh;
Then cease, my darling?cease to chide
When I have crossed the deep blue sea,
I ne?er shall woo another bride
Whilst mem?ry wafts my thoughts -to thee.


THAT WORSTED SKEIN.
Bt a cheerful fire on a bleak cold night
I basked in the smiles of a maiden fair,
Her lips were red and her eyes were bright?
A picture, I ween, for a painter?s care ;
And she bound my wrists with her worsted strands
And I knelt at her feet, some praise to gain?
But those tap?ring fingers and snow-white hands
Entangled my heart and the worsted skein.
Oh! those arching brows o?er the sparkling eyes,
And ringlets descending on neck so fair !
?Tis said that in love one cannot be wise,
And I asked her through life my lot to share.
She paused in her task with the gay-dyed wool,
And chilled me through with her proud disdain:
She bade me begone, she was not quite a fool?
I might tangle her life like the worsted skein.
Then I pressed my suit and her anger braved,
Alas ! I?ve no skill in the flattering way;
One kiss of her ruby lips I craved
But she tossed her curls and answered nay.
Then I wandered home to my lonely cot
In the piercing wind and the drenching rain ;
And often I?ll dream, whate?er be my lot,
Of those bright blue eyes and that worsted skein.


FAITHLESS LILY.
Oh ! my Lily?s proved false, and my poor heart is broke,
I roam up and down like a ghost, man ;
When I think of my rival, I?m ready to choke
The sneaking young scamp ?he?s a postman.
I loved Lily fair, with her eyes violet blue,
And her lips, they were ever my boast, man,
So bewitchiugly shaped and so ruby in hue?
Never meant to be kissed by a postman.
Her rich golden hair was a picture to see,
It was nature?s gift, free from all cost, man ;
Her ankle was neat as an ankle could be?
May her foot kick that rascally postman!
Oh ! Lily, sweet darling! how could you so stray ?
You?ve been wayward, and now I?m a lost man.
?Twas a ? bob? you misspent on that fatal day
When you advertised straight for a postman.*
? The young lady did advertise for a husband, giving preference to
a letter-carrier.


A BIRTHDAY SONG.
(Impromptu).
DEDICATED TO MR. JOHN G M.
Air, apparent.
You?re fifty-one to-day, John?
How swiftly time goes by !
Your locks are tinged with grey, John,
And dull now seems your eye.
For specs you now must wear, John,
It grieves you much I know ;
You strove so hard against their aid,
But found it was no go.
I?m sure you mind the time, John,
When we were lad and lass,
You?d scarcely step aside, John,
To let the grand folks pass.
But now with drooping head, John,
You trudge along your way,
And all you earn to keep the house
Is six-and-six a day.
Our courtship was but short, John,
And yet we?ve happy been ;
?Twas love at the first sight, John,
But then we both were green.
I might have spliced a wealthy gent,
And you an heiress, too ;
But let?s forget the past, my dear,
It?s now too late to rue.


Look round your ain fireside, John,
And see how snug we are ;
Of course its married life, John,
To sometimes have a jar ;
Your temper?s rather hot, John,
And often your tongue
Is not the soft and honeyed one
That charmed my heart when young.
You?ve aye been leal and true, John,
Ne?er raised the monster green ;
Often you?ve been tempted, John,
Hy many a witching quean.
There?s some folks I could name, John,
Keep flirting night and day ;
When jealousy steps in between,
The deuce and all?s to pay.
You wander by the lake, John,
When summer nights are fine,
To see the courting there, John,
But still your heart is mine.
I?d trust you ?mid the greatest charms
Which womankind can show ;
And if you?ve snatched a kiss sometimes,
I?m sure it?s years ago.
You?re fifty-one to-day, John,
And still to me you?re young,
And all our wedded life, John,
You know your praise I?ve sung ;
And from my inmost heart, John,
Believe me when I say,
I wish you many blithe returns
Of this your natal day.


A BACHELOR CIVIL SERVANT?S FAREWELL
TO HIS CAT.
A BLACK WEDNESDAY INCIDENT.
Farewell, Master Pussy, no more shall we mingle
Our grub and our songs every morning at nine ;
I have sacked you this morning, my dearest Tom Pussy,-
To-morrow, alas ! your sad fate may be mine.
I have toiled day and night in this scurvy department,
There?s nobody knows what a life I have led;
No children around me, no wife to caress me,
Each night I crawl in to my lone truckle bed.
?Twas a dream of my youth when I entered the Service
I was booked up to sixty, and safe for my screw ;
But this deadlock and Berry have played up old Harry,
And made matters look most confoundedly blue.
They may talk of Damocles, by George! he was snug,
With that sword by a hair hanging over his mug;
He was not half so shaky as I am to-day ?
Come, Puss, let us liquor, whilst yet we can pay.


THE NEW TURN-OUT.
Have you seen my slashing carriage?
Have you twigg?d my spanking bays?
What a change has now come o?er me,
Since the by-gone hard-up days.
Oft when cold night winds were blowing
Have I stood upon the brace,
With my ? crib? and tea-can, waiting
To be lowered down to the ? face.?
Still with heart and hand to aid me,
Never fretting, always bold ;
Fortune smiled at length upon me,
And my pockets filled with gold.
Then I left the deep wet sinking,
And the damp drives underground ;
Took an office at the ? Corner,?
Watched Dame Fortune?s wheel go round
Then with ear and brain to aid me,
Only risking where ?twas safe ;
On and upward, still progressing,
Always topping fortune?s wave.
Now my name means eighty thousand?
Four score thousand pounds in gold ;
And my life must prove the adage?
Fortune favors still the bold.


My dashing turn-out speaks a sermon
Worth the study those who toil;
When their fortune?s at the lowest
Let them think of Jimmy Cr le.


?MY DADDY NEVER COME.?
I often pass a lonely cot when my day?s toil is o?er,
And a pretty child with golden locks keeps watching at the
door.
Though hast?niug on with pleasant thoughts for those I?ll
meet at home,
I hear that little maid exclaim, ? My Daddy never come.?
I pause and learn from passers-by that Minnie?s often there,
Still watching with those bright blue eyes, so young yet
tinged with care.
And up and down the path all day those longing glances roam,
But still the plaintive cry?s the same, 11 My Daddy never come.?
?Twas close on midnight?s lonesome hour, this story I?ve
been told,
The father kissed his sleeping child, and went to mine for
gold.
In manhood?s prime he passed that door to earn the daily
sum,
And now his fate the child?s words tell, ? My Daddy never
come.?
No more at morn or eve will he clasp to his manly breast,
The cherished darling loved so well, so fondly oft caressed,
Without one moment?s warning he was sent to his long home,
The little mourner cries in vain, ? My Daddy never come.?


FAREWELL.
Though soon another?s bride you?ll be,
And ne?er can smile as mine, love ;
Your fate through life, on land or sea,
Around my heart shall twine, love.
Our evening walks, oh ! sweet were they
When summer nights were fine, love ;
My future seemed so bright and gay
With your hand clasped in mine, love.
The wounded soldier bravely bears,
And proudly shows a scar, love ;
For him bright eyes may melt in tears,
My wound is deeper far, love.
I will not chide ; I?ll bear my lot;
?Tis not so bright as thine, love.
A lonely wand?rer quite forgot,
A life without sunshine, love.
Thy broken vows have broke my heart;
Oh ! sad?s this fate of mine, love.
?Twas sweet to meet, ?tis sad to part,
Farewell ?may bliss be thine, love.
James Curtis, Printer, Armstrong Street, Ballarat.
