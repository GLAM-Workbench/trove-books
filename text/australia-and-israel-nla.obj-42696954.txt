An independent State has been estab-
lished in the Land of the Bible after
2,000 years !
Australia took a leading part in the United
Nations Organisation's move to establish
the independent democratic nation of
Israel in Palestine.
Now Australians ask their Government
to give official recognition to Israel's
Government.


i'AN May 15, 1948,,at midnight, a new National State
was added to the tale of nations of the world.
The new nation is the Republic of Israel, the Jewish
dream and aspiration of two thousand years come true
at last.
Palestine, within whose borders the Israeli Republic
has been set up, had been administered as a British
Mandate since the first world war. Last year, the British
Government intimated to the United Nations Organisa-
tion that it would relinquish on May 15 its responsibility
for Palestine.
Thereupon, the U.N. General Assembly appointed an
international committee to advise on the form of admini-
stration which would succeed the Mandatory Govern-
ment. The committee, under the presidency of the
Australian Minister for External Affairs, Dr. Evatt,
recommended the establishment of an independent
Jewish State in Palestine, together with a neighbouring
independent Arab State. Last November, the General
Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, supported this
Australian-sponsored recommendation, and now David
Ben Gurion’s provisional Government of Israel, estab-
lished within the frontiers drawn by U-N-. see\s recog-
nition by the individual governments of the nations.
, AUSTRALIAN SUPPORTERS OF THE U.N.
ORGANISATION FOR PEACE AND WORLD
ORDER JOIN NOW IN WELCOMING THE
STATE OF. ISRAEL INTO THE FAMILY OF
NATIONS, AND AWAIT OFFICIAL AUS-
TRALIAN RECOGNITION OF ISRAEL AND ITS.
GOVERNMENT.
Will you convey to the Member of the House of
Representatives for your constituency an expression of
gratification and your expectation that Commonwealth
Government recognition of the Government of Israel
will be made without delay?


A NUMBER of nations have already given recognP
tion to Ben Gurion’S provisional Government as
the de facto Government of Israel. First to take this
step was the United States of America, followed by
the Soviet Union.
Speedy recognition by ALL democratic governments
is urgently necessary. Recognition will help to end
1 i i - r _ -
hostilities by strengthening the hand of U-N-O.
The invading armies which have threatened peace
in the Middle East can be forced bac\ into• their
own territories by the democratic forces of the world
acting in support of the U.N.O-
Those Arabs who have attacked the Jewish State are
NOT Palestinians, but outsiders from neighbouring
countries. They have attempted to prevent the estaj)-
lishment, not only of the Jewish State, but of an inde-
pendent Arab State in Palestine as well. They seek to
divide the country of Palestine amongst themselves.
AUSTRALIA PLAYED A LEADING PART IN
MAKING THE NATION OF ISRAEL. THE
NEXT STEP IS RECOGNITION OF THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT. URGE RECOGNI-
TION OF THE GOVERNMENT OF ISRAEL!
