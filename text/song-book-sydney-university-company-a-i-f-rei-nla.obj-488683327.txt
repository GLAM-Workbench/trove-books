I. —National Songs.
1. GOD SAVE THE KING.
God save our gracious King,
Long live our noble King,
God save the King!
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the King!
2. LA MARSEILLAISE.
Aliens, enfants de la patrie,
Le jour de gloire est arrive.
Contre nous de la tyrannic
L’ etendard sanglant est leve,
L’ etendard sanglant est leve.
Entendez vous dans les campagnes
Mugir ces feroces soldats?
Ils viennent jusque dans vois bras
Egorger vos fils, vos compagnes!
Aux armes, citoyens!
Formez vos bataillons!
Marchons, marchons,
Qu’un sang impur
Abreuve nos sillons!


11.
Amour sacre cle la patrie,
Conduis, soutiens nos bras vengeurs!
Liberte, Liberte cherie,
Combats avec tes defenseurs.
Combats .avec tes defenseurs,
Sous nos drapeaux que la victoire
Accoure a tes males accents,
Que tes ennemis expirants
Voient ton triomphe et notre gloire.
3. THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER.
Oh! say can ye see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s
last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, thro the
perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gal-
lantly streaming.
And the rockets’ red glare, the shells bursting
in air,
Gave proof thro’ the night that our flag was
still there;
Oh! say does that star-spangled banner yet
wave
O’er the land of the free and the home of the
brave?


4. RULE BRITANNIA.
I.
When Britain first at Heaven’s command
Arose from out the azure main,
This was the charter, the charter of the land,
And guardian angels sang the strain;
Rule, Britannia! Britannia rule the waves!
Britons never shall be Slaves.
11.
The nations not so blest as thee
Must in their turn to tyrants fall, _
While thou shalt flourish, shalt flourish great
and free,
The dread and envy of them all.
111.
The Muses, still with freedom found,
Shall to thy happy coast repair,
Blest Isle, with beauty, with matchless beauty
crowned
And manly hearts to guard the fair.


II. —Songs of the War and the Company.
5. GAUDEAMUS.
(Company Version.)
1.
Gaudeamus igitur
luvenes dum sumus;
Post iucundam iuventutem,
Post molestam senectutem,
Nos habebit humus.
11.
Vi vat academia,
Vivant professores,
Vivat membrum quodlibet,
Vivant membra quaelibet,
Semper sint in flore!
111.
Floreat Manipulus!
Vivant duces clari!
Strenui sint milites.
Redeant incolumes
Patriaeque can!


IV.
Ex Australi patria
Animo parato
Hostium in aciexn
Imus: sit mens eadem
Sidere mutato!
Company verses by F. A. Todd, 1918.
6. AU REVOIR.
(Tune: “John Brown’s Body.”)
I.
The Company of Sydney University are we,
We’re off to help our brothers fighting, far
across the sea,
We hope the war will soon be o’er; and when
the world is free.
Then we’ll come marching home.
Au revoir to books and lectures.
Pedant theories and conjectures.
None of these shall now affect us
Till we come marching home.
11.
Let pacifists and socialists and all disloyal
cliques
Who have no ear for Duty’s voice, however loud
it speaks, .
Let these retain their own Domain with all its
frowsy freaks.


Till we come marching home.
Au re voir to all the shirkers.
All the World’s Industrial Workers:
We shall settle all the lurkers.
When we come marching home.
111.
Our women bold collect the gold, and cut their
hair and knit.
While some of them go digging sand to make
themselves keep fit;
We all contend, these to defend ’tis right to do
our bit,
So we march on with Holme.
Let the women raise the money,
Knit, and make their hair look funny,
We will go away with Sonny,
With Captain Sonny Holme.
IV.
Let every man who feels he can and ought to go
and fight,
Lay down his books and take his stand for
justice and for right;
Now here’s a chance to go to France, come let
us all unite,
To push the Germans home.
Now for France we set our faces,
Come and help us fill the spaces,
In the ranks of German-chasers
From the dear old ’Varsity.
N. S. Pickering, 1918.


7. BULLY AND JAM.
(To air of Botrel’s “Chantons I’Artillerie.”)
I.
We chorus as we’re marching along
In warm or wintry weather,
A rousing, roaring Company song,
And beef it out together.
Tramp, tramping on we go
(Bully and jam for dinner),
Come rain or sun or snow
(Bully and jam for tea!)
Jam. jam, bully and jam for tea.
Bully and jam for dinner!
Come rain or sun or snow,
Bully and jam for tea!
11.
We battened once on turkey and ham,
In days we’ve nigh forgotten;
But now we live on bully and jam,
And find ’em none so rotten.
Tramp, tramping day and night,
(Bully and jam for dinner),
Lord! we’ve an appetite
(Bully and jam for tea!)
Jam. jam, bully and jam for tea,
Bully and jam for dinner!
Lord! we’ve an appetite!
Bully and jam for tea!


111.
The Sergeant and the C.-in-C.,
The Colonel and the Digger,
Find army grub for dinner and tea
Improving to the figger.
So, as we tramp along,
(Bully and jam for dinner)
We sing a cheery song
(Bully and jam for tea)
Jam, jam, bully and jam for tea,
Bully and jam for dinner!
We sing a cheery song,
Bully and jam for tea!
IV.
And wheresoe’er the Company come,
To camp or trench or billet.
We sing a song of the Company turn
And the bully and jam that fill it.
Boys, as we tramp along.
(Bully and jam for dinner),
This be our marching song,
(Bully and jam for tea!)
Jam, jam, bully and jam for tea,
Bully and jam for dinner!
This be our marching song.
Bully and jam for tea!
F. A. Todd, 1918.


8. CARMEN MILITARE.
(“ Tipperary.”)
I.
Ad Londinium perrexit olim Padius;
Gaudium viarum aurum fecit omnibus;
Te canebant, Piccadillia, teque, Area,
Ut excitatus Padius clamaret talia —
Chorus:
Longa via ad Tipperariam,
Valde longa via;
Longa via ad Tipperariam,
Ad te, dulcissima:
Vale, Piccadillia,
Area, vale;
Quamvis longe distes, Tipperaria,
Volat cor ad te.
11.
Litteras conscripsit suam ad Hibernicam
Padius: “his non acceptis,” inquit, “fac
sciam;
Perperam si verba scribo, culpa calamum,
Mariola carissima, nam scelus non meum,"
Chorus: Longa via, etc.
111.
Optime Mariola rescripsit Padio:
“Me volt,” inquit, “ducere Malonius: eo
Culpam ut vites relinque Piccadilliam;
Nam pereo amore: pereas tu etiam! ”
Chorus: Longa via, etc.
F. A. Todd, 1915.


9. CARMEN POPULARE.
(“ Keep the Home Fires Burning.”)
I.
Et a montibus repente
Et a campis iuvenes
Patria viros poscente
Convolarunt alacres.
Ne quis augeat laborem
Transeunti militi,
Reticentes nos dolorem
Concinamus hilari;
Focos nos servemus,
Nostris dum caremus;
Lares somniant absentes filii;
Nimbo perlucenti
Fulgor est argenti:
Hunc spectemus dum redierint pueri.
111.
Exaudivimus precatos
Socios “ succurrite! ”
Misimus trans freta natos,
Appellante nos fide.
Nostrum enim quis iacebit
Barbarorum sub iugo?
Quis Britannus aut silebit
C ncitus a socio?
P. A. Todd, 1917.


10. THE COMPANY A-ROVING.
I.
At Sydney University,
(Mark well what I do say),
At Sydney University,
There was no student like to nn
Before I went a-roving
With the A.I.F.
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in,
Before I went a-roving
With the A.I.F.
11.
I chucked up Kelly, Giles, and Bohn,
(Mark well what I do 'say),
I chucked up Kelly, Giles, and Bohn,
Enrolled myself in Sonny's Own,
And started out a-roving
With the A.I.F.
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in.
And started out a-roving
With the A.I.F.
111.
We kissed our girls and packed our kits,
(Mark well what I do say),
We kissed our girls and packed our kits,
And left to give the Bodies fits,
Whenas we went a-roving
With the A.I.F.


A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in,
Whenas we went a-roving
With the A.I.F.
IV.
We dodged the blanky submarines,
(Mark well what I do say),
We dodged the blanky submarines,
And got to England full of beans.
What time we went a-roving
With the A.I.F,
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in.
What time we went a-roving
With the A.I.F.
V.
From there we came across to France,
(Mark well what I do say),
From there we came across to France,
And led the Boche a deuce of a dance,
When we went out a-roving,
With the A.I.F.
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in.
When we went out a-roving.
With the A.I.F.
VI.
When Kaiser Bill caught sight of us,
(Mark well what I do say),
When Kaiser Bill caught sight of us,


He jumped on a homing Potsdam ’bus,
For we were come a-roving
With the A.I.F.
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in,
For we were come a-roving
With the A.I.F.
VII.
We chased him home with a helova roar,
(Mark well what I do> say),
We chased him home with a helova roar,
And put an end to the blanky war,
And so came home from roving
With the A.I.F.
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in,
And so came home from roving
With the A.I.F.
VIII.
And when we’re back with never a care,
(Mark well what I do> say),
And when we’re back with never a care:
Oh! won’t you wish that you’d been there,
When we were off a-roving
With the A.1.F.?
A-roving, a-roving,
To be the Boche’s ru-i-in,
When we were off a-roving
With the A.I.F.
F. A. Todd, 1918.


the company march.
(Music by A. V. Walker.)
I.
Don’t you hear the tramping of our feet?
Can’t you hear us coming down the street.
We have chucked up books and learning,
For with martial fire we’re burning,
And we’re off to help our country from defeat.
Chorus;
Then roll up, men of the ’Varsity,
Fall in lads double quick,
When we meet the Turk or Hun
We will make the beggars run,
And we’ll fight for the honour of the Varsity.
IX.
Undergrads of Science and of Law,
The sweetest lot of chaps you ever saw,
And the joyful-hearted Meds
Who will not mind smashing heads
Or dislocating any German jaw.
Chorus; Then roll up, &c.
111.
Arts and Engineers are here as well }
To help to chase the Kaiser down to (Tartarus;,
Blowing up his blooming bridges,
Undermining all his ndges,
Till “Kamerad” the wily Hun will yell.
Chorus: Then roll up, &c. . Ift
E. A. DOmbwn, 1918.


12. FRANCE.
1917.
(Tune: “ O’Donnell Aboo.”)
I.
Grim were the tidings of legions assembling
With tramping of feet and with rumble of
guns;
Over the border the highways were trembling
Under the on-rushing hordes of the Huns.
Up spring the sons of France,
Fronting the foe’s advance,
Up, with the battle-cry “pour la patrie!”
Fight, as of old they fought,
Fight, counting death as nought;
Fighting for country they fight to be free.
11.
On swept the Hun, but no murmur inglorious
Hinted the treason that valour was vain;
Stoutly they fought till their armies victorious
Flung back the foe from the Marne to the
Aisne.
Dauntless they took their stand,
Guarding the fatherland.
Where runs the line from the Vosges to
the sea:
Dauntlessly there they stood,
Stemming the tyrant flood,
Fighting that France and the world might
be free.


111.
Still with the powers of darkness contending
(Weary the waiting and bloody the fray),
France battles on with a purpose unbending,
But wistful she looks for the coming of day,
Day, that shall victory bring,
Day, when the bells shall ring
Telling of peace and the gladness to be.
Mangled by shot and shell,
Braving the night of hell,
France battles on that the world may be
free.
IV.
Not for the love of a battlefield gory,
But for the love of their women enslaved,
Not for revenge do they fight, nor for glory,
But that their country and we may be saved.
Heed ye the sacrifice?
Frenchmen have paid the price,
Giving their life-blood for you and for me.
Shall they have died in vain?
Fruitless shall be their pain?
Fight, give, and labour that France may
be free!
F. A. Todd, 1917.


13. THE GERMAN GENERAL’S SONG.
Tune: The Lord High Admiral’s Song.—
“ Pinafore.”
I.
When I was a lad I served a term
As cat-destroyer in a sausage tirm;
I slit their throats with a bright brown blade,
And absolutely revelled in the mess I made.
I slaughtered cats with such a jovial smile,
And showed (in killing kittens) such professional
style,
I swung my blade so expertly,
That now I am a General of Germany,
11,
But killing cats ain’t really hard,
So I got a job in a slaughter-yard;
I felled the cows with a musical thud,
And waded to my ankles in a pool of blood.
I liked the smell of blood so well,
That now the Belgians think I must have come
from—Heaven.
And I learnt my art so thoroughly,
That now I am a General of Germany.
111.
Then I got a job (a regular jewel),
As infant-smacker in a public school,
I belted the kids with a smile of glee,
And I told them that it hurt them less than it
hurt me.


At last an infant gave me cheek—
I jumped on his face until he couldn t speak.
His death gave me such ecstasy,
That I’m just the sort of General for Germany.
IV.
That murder won me the Iron Cross,
And the Kaiser made me an army boss,
And he said, “Von Schwein, you’re just the one
To uphold the reputation of the cultured Hun.
Spill blood, that’s all you’ve got to do,
Don’t think for yourself, I’ll always think for
you;
Kill every baby that you see,
And youdi be just the General for Germany.’
F. J. Sheed, 1915.
14. GRIM AND GORY.
Words adapted, with permission, from the
Scouts’ Song (1908). Music taken, without
permission, from Fritz.
I.
We are soldiers grim and gory,
(Zim-zerim-zim-zim-zim-zim)
Out to fight for death or glory,
(Zim-zerim-zim-zim-zim-zim)
At our head the trumpets blare,
(Ta-ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ra)
Not one little blow we care
(Ta-ra-ta-ta-ta-ta-ra)


For brother Fritz the Frightful
(W ow-wow-wow-wow-wow)
For brother Fritz the Frightful,—wow!
(Row-dedow, row-do-dow, row-de-dow-dow-
dow).
11.
When we march away to battle,
(Zim-zerim, &c.)
When we hear the rifles rattle,
(Zim-zerim, &c.)
Shall we fear the furious foe?
(Ta-ra, &c.)
Shall we be downhearted?—NO!
(Ta-ra, &c.)
We shall up and at ’em
(Wow-wow, &c.)
We shall up and at ’em, —wow!
(Row-de-dow, &c.)
111.
And should Fritz be such a jackass
(Zim-zerim, &c.)
As to venture to attack us,
(Zim-zerim, &c.)
We shall be the real Mackay,
(Ta-ra, &c.)
We shall do him in the eye,
(Ta-ra, &c.)
There’ll be none to touch us
(Wow-wow, & c.)
There’ll be none to touch us,- -wow 1
(Row-de-dow, &c.)


IV.
We are soldiers grim and gory,
(Zim-zerixn, &c.)
Out to fight for death or glory,
(Zim-zerim, &c.)
When the Allies take Berlin,
(Ta-ra, &c.)
When they march triumphant in,
(Ta-ra, &c.)
We shall lead the army
(Wow-wow, & c.)
We shall lead the army,—wow!
(Row-de-dow, &c.)
F. A. Todd, 1908 and 1918.
15. HERE’S A HEALTH UNTO HIS
MAJESTY.
(With Company Verse.)
Here’s a health unto His Majesty,
With a fa la la la la la la,
Confusion to his enemies,
With a fa la la la la la la;
And he that will not drink his health,
I wish him neither wit nor wealth,
Nor yet a rope to hang himself,
With a fa la la la la la la la la la,
With a fa la la la la la la.


11.
Here’s a health unto the ’Varsity,
And a health unto the Company:
Be these the toasts for you and me
In wine or water, beer or tea,
At home, abroad, on land or sea.
Ist verse, 17th cent.; 2nd verse, Anon. 1918.
16. THE LAND THAT IS DESOLATE.
Tune: “Forty Years On.”
I.
Belgium, the name that of old when the Roman
Flaunted his might through the lands of the
Gaul,
Won from the lips of the conquering foeman
Guerdon of honour as “ bravest of all,”
Bravest thou wast; and amid desolation,
Ravaged the lands and the cities forlorn,
Courage still dwells in the heart of thy nation.
Now when its body lies bleeding and torn.
Chorus:
Battle on! Battle on! Battle on! Battle on!
Battle on!
Till the world ring again and again
With the joy of the victory won!
Battle on! Battle on!


11.
strong is the foe. b.ut *y “ns'Mcy stronger,
Proudly refusing to reckon the cost,
R BHghted t the S fieli glad harvests
Dead rre''thy sons, but their name Uves in story
Deathless, for Honour and Europe are
Chorus; Battle on! etc.
111.
TT par ve the cry of a nation in anguish.
H VptJeance f O J valour laid low m the dust.
Help for the children, for
i-stTe'rss-
grateful devotion to thee.
Chorus; Battle on! etc.
F. A. Todd, 1915.


17. ROLL UP, ALL!
{Tune: “Marching Through Georgia.”)
I.
Hearken, all ye students, as at Wisdom’s shrine
ye bow,
We’ve something here to tell you; it concerns
you. anyhow;
The ’Varsity’s a lovely place, but a trifle cool
just now;
It’s a great deal warmer in the Company.
Chorus;
So come along, don’t wait to be asked again;
Roll up and join, it’s time to show you’re men.
The sword’s the fashion now, my lads, so fling
away the pen:
Roll up all and join the Company!
11.
Arts is quite a decent job: the life is gay and
free,
And you learn a lot of language and the wars
of history;
But in French and battle-story and the real
philosophy.
You’ll get good practice in the Company.
Chorus; So come along, &c.


111.
Dissecting knives are handy: but a bayonet’s
sharp enough
To practise on a German with, though his hide
is rather tough;
So come on Meds., you mustn’t wait; we tell
you it’s no bluff;
You all are wanted in the Company.
Chorus: So come along, &c.
IV.
If Butchers go, you Engineers will never want
to stay:
You’ll find the life congenial too, for it’s greasy
in the fray,
Khaki will get as grimy as your dungarees to-
day:
And a suit costs nothing in the Company.
Chorus: So come along, &c.
V.
You Scientific stood, perhaps you’re sick of
making gas:
Well, come and get it ready-made; or if you’re
such an ass
As still to want to make it, make it for the
German mass
And send it as a present from the Company.
Chorus: So come along, &c.


VI.
The spirit of our ’Varsity then calls to each
of you;
Whatever be your Faculty there’s work for you
to do:
Our Alma Mater must not blush for the sons
of the Gold and Blue.
Be worthy of her!—Join the Company!
Chorus: So come along, &c.
O. Purnell, 1918.
18. SOLDIERS OF THE VARSITY.
(Tune: “Cheer, boys, cheer!”)
I.
Grads and Undergrads are we,
From the Sydney ’Varsity,
Marching forth to fight the Hunnish German
Boche,
Butchers, Greasers, Arts and Law,
Joined in one to win the war.
With the kind assistance of the French and
Foch.
Chorus:
Cheer, boys, cheer, for we are coming,
Soldiers of the ’Varsity;
When we start we never stop
Till we come right out on top,
And now we’re off, we’re off, we’re off to Vic-
tory.


11.
When we heard our country call
Round we rallied one and all,
Ready each to do his bit with all his might;
While our colours float on high,
None can daunt us: let ’em try,
And we’ll show them how the ’Varsity can fight.
111.
Not a thought of rivalry,
Not a thought of Faculty:
Break not up, my boys, our dear old happy
Holme!
We shall face the foe as one,
And when we’ve polished off the Hun
Back we’ll come and never, never more will
roam.
M. Knox, 1918.
19. A SONG OF SCARBOROUGH.
Tune: “ Ten Thousand Miles Away.”
I.
Sing ho! for a brave and a knightly foe,
Sing ho! for the Kaiser’s Huns,
For the valiant feat of the Kaiser’s fleet,
For the roar of the Kaiser’s guns,
For the roar of the eight-inch guns, my boys,
That came across the bay.
For the shriek of the shell and the flaming hell
On the beach at the break of day.


Chorus:
Blow soft, ye winds, heigh ho!
A-cruising we will go,
To spill some gore on England’s shore:
O shan’t we all be gay!
We’ll sail on a misty night,
And may not have to fight,
But we’ll do for a babe or two
Four hundred miles away.
11.
They sailed away from the Kiel Canal,
And at Scarborough sighted land;
And the crews all cheered, for it soon appeared
That the forts were made of sand;
For the Scarborough forts are sand, my boys,
From the shore of the grey North Sea,
And the guns are of tin, and the shell within
Is the highly explosive pea.
Chorus; Blow soft, etc.
111.
They loosed their guns at a church or so,
For that is the German rule;
They lobbed a shell on the big hotel,
They banged at an infants’ school,
They battered an infants’ school, my boys,
And they slew of women a score,
When our ships appeared, and away they cleared
Full speed for the German shore.
Chorus: Blow soft, etc.


IV.
Sing ho! for the knightly foe’s return,-
Sing ho! for the valiant Hun,
For the forts he’d bashed, and the guns he’d
smashed,
Sing ho! for the yarn he spun.
’Twas a wonderful yarn he spun, my boys,
Of the forts of Scarborough beach,
And the Admiral of the Kiel Canal
Gave an Iron Cross to each.
Chorus; Blow soft, etc.
P. A. Todd, 1915.
20. THE STUDENT CORPS.
(Tune: “The Old Brigade.”)
I.
We are the boys of the Student Corps,
We are the lads to fight;
Sturdy of muscle and hard of jaw,
Fearsome in kick and bite;
Lawyer and Greaser and Scientist,
Artist and Medico,,
Tough-hided “doer” or youth unkist,
Wowser or stunning beau.


Chorus:
We all have doffed the gown and donned the
khaki,
Gone is all our former rivalry:
Whate’er befall, one are we all
In our love for the ’Varsity.
We all have doffed. &c.
11.
Gone are our blazers and creamy pants.
Gone brilliantine and “snow”;
Turn we from Manning and swift romance,
Turn to a sterner foe!
Men of the ruck and the Rugby scrum,
Men of the willow and ball,
We’ll make the Kaiser and Willie glum
When on their necks we fall.
Chorus: We all have doffed, &c.
111.
Some knuts will flirt with the Scottish lass,
Some woo the gay ma’m’selle,
Others will sure act the giddy ass
With the sweet English belle.
But thro’ the glamour of love or war
This shall our slogan be:
“Spotless the name of our Student Corps.
Pride of our ’Varsity! ”
Chorus; We all have doffed. &c.
A. C. Fox, 1918.


21. THE ’VARSITY COMPANY.
(Music by J. C. Green.)
I.
Good-bye to musty lecture-rooms, good-bye to
the ’Varsity,
We’re off to do our duty in the ranks of the
Company;
We’ve left the benches empty, but the trenches
will hold us all,
And instead of droning profs, we’ll hear the
Sergeant-major bawl.
Cheer, boys, cheer! We’re all in the Company,
Short and fat and thin and tall,
’Varsity men and soldiers all,
Winning degrees at the bugle’s call
In the ’Varsity Company.
11.
We honour first the lads who’ve fought and
paid the War-God’s toll,
Who’ll live in the ’Varsity’s history while count-
less ages roll;
And we honour those who toed the line but
failed to get the chance
Of helping to drive the bloody Boche from the
sacred fields of France.
Eyes front, boys! You belong to the Company,
Whether you were too old or young,
Or missed the chance from a leaky lung;
Ever as white men you’ll be sung
In the ’Varsity Company.


111.
At sport we did our best to keep the Blue and
Gold in front,
Some scholars too among us won the academic
stunt;
But now the game’s a nobler one, with tickets
going free
To win the prize of a name that lasts for all
eternity.
March, boys, march in the ranks of the Com-
pany!
Whether we do or don’t come back,
The Blue and Gold in every pack
Is Charon’s fee to th’ Elysian track
For the ’Varsity Company.
IV.
We tramp along the boggy road in mud and
slush and rain,
But little we care for cold and wet as we sing
our glad refrain;
Our feet keep time in unison with the thoughts
we bear in mind
Of the dear old halls of the ’Varsity and the
folks we’ve left behind.
Step out, boys! We’re the ’Varsity Company!
Nought can sever the bonds that hold
Men of the ’Varsity, young or old.
Serving their country, all enrolled
In the ’Varsity Company.
S. C. Ratcliff, 1918.


22. VIVE LA COMPAGNIE.
(Company Version.)
1.
Let every good fellow now fill up a pot,
Vive la Compagnie,
And drink to the health of a jolly fine lot,
The ’Varsity Company.
Chorus:
Vive la, vive la, vive l’Arm6e,
Vive la, vive la, vive I’Arm^e,
Vive le Roi, vive I’Arm^e,
Vive la Compagnie!
11.
And here’s to our Sonny, Professor of Lit.,
Who’s putting on khaki and doing his bit
In the ’Varsity Company.
m.
And here’s to the diggers who march in the
They’ll hop’ it like one o’clock after the tanks
With the ’Varsity Company.
IV.
And here’s to the sergeants who yell and look
fierce,
Promoted as cobbers of Senator Pearce
In the ’Varsity Company.


V.
And here’s to the officers natty and clean ;
rhe> r have a nice mess and a dinkum canteen
In the ’Varsity Company.
VI.
ixvii , ler . e s si r^s who when we are away
Will knit us our socks and write letters each
day,
To the ’Varsity Company.
VII.
Since all with good humour you’ve toasted so
free,
I hope it will please you to drink now with me
“The ’Varsity Company!”
W. H, Ward and J. C. Green, 1918.


III.—Songs of Sydney University.
23. THE ’VARSITY.
Air: ‘‘Men of Harlech.”
i.
Grads and Undergrads and Fellows,
Gaudy Profs, in reds and yellows,
Sing with lungs as tough as bellows,
To our ’Varsity.
Some of us are mining,
Some in Arts reclining.
More and more
Attack the Law
And revel in its methods of refining:
Some are fools and some are clever,
Faculties divide and sever,
Still we all belong for ever
To our ’Varsity.
IT.
Many lecturers, professors,
Bull-dogs and the like oppressors
Harass, worry, and distress us
At our ’Varsity.


Though they call us asses,
Turn us out of classes,
Still we know
They’re men below.
And all their deadly jawing mainly gas is
Pitt and Pollock, Mac. and Scob, and
T.P.A. in scarlet robe, and
Barff are members of our Sydney
University.
111.
Varied are the tastes of students,
Varied our degrees of prudence,
Very varied our amusements
At our ’Varsity.
We shall soon be scattered,
Friendships may be shattered,
Some or all will grope and crawl
And get up very knocked about and battered.
Some are hung and some are married,
Some for years in gaol have tarried,
Still they all are members of the
Same old ’Varsity.
H. E. Whitfeld, 1900.


24. THE BLUE AND GOLD.
Music from “The Enchantress” (Balfc).
I.
Sing we a song to the colours we love.
With a love that can never grow cold;
Sing to the flag that is floating above
In glory of Blue and Gold!
Gold are the fields where ripens the grain,
And golden the moon on the harvest-wain;—
Sing we a song to the colours we love,
Hurrah for the Blue and Gold!
11.
Blue were the billows that bowed to the sun
As his gleaming car up-rolled;
Blue is the sky where his course is run,
Till he sinks in a blaze of gold;
Blue is the mountain that rears its crest
Guarding the gate of the golden west; —
Ours are the ribbons that Nature has spun—
Hurrah for the Blue and Gold!
111.
Young are the hearts that are singing to-day,
Hearts that can never grow old:
For theirs is the love that endureth for aye
The love of our Blue and Gold.
Warm as the sun and deep as the sea—
Such be our love for the ’Varsity,
And long may we sing, as we’re singing to-day,
Hurrah for the Blue and Gold!
F. A. Todd, 1910. (First two verses adapted
from “The Yellow and Blue,” a song of Michi-
gan University.)


25. COMMEMORATION DAY.
(Music by C. K. Allen, 1908.)
I.
Fling to the winds the mortar-board
And doff the sombre gown,
And put your scarecrow armour on
To conquer Sydney town.
Gird on your trusty bulbous nose
And panoply of left-off clothes.
And march in triumph forth to turn
All Sydney upside down.
V
Chorus:
Then sound the loud kazoo,
And let the tin-horn bray,
For we’ll surprise the natives on
Commemoration Day.
11.
Come rally round, ye deadbeats bold
And freaks in thin red line,
And swell the gallant legions of
The pseudo-feminine.
Give law-abiding citizens
Acute delirium tremens.
And raise the old dispute between
The lobster and the wine.
Chorus: Then sound, &c.


111.
Lead forth the proudly prancing steed
The infant Adam rode,
Adorn his ostentatious ribs
With nightwear a la mode.
Bring meat-van, hearse, bathing-machine,
New model aero-submarine,
And summon Black Maria from
Her dark and drear abode.
Chorus: Then sound, &c.
IV
Come, all ye staunch Darwinians,
And missing links o’erjoyed,
And prove yourselves true scions of
The blue-blood anthropoid.
See how the lorn policeman flies
The army of monstrosities,
While bookworms, mopes, and pedants look
Superiorly annoyed.
Chorus: Then sound, &c.
C. K. Allen, 1908.


26. ENTENTE CORDIALE.
(Air: Simon the Cellarer.”)
I.
Meds;
We come from the temples of Taffy and Jum,
From muscles and bones galore,
We \ e left all our patients to die and we’ve
come
To carry our flag to the fore (bis).
We 11 mix you a potion or cut off your leg,
And measure the albumen found in an egg;
We’ll slice your appendix or poison your ma,
And take all 3mu ladies about in the car.
Chorus:
But, ho! ho! ho! all classes shall go,
We’re all for the ’Varsity now. What Ho! (bis).
11.
Engineers;
We’re slaves of the oil-can and engines, are we,
We live among screws and bolts;
At girders and bridges we’re very 0.T.,
We revel in amperes and volts (bis).
We work in the boiler-room all the day long,
And fly through the roof if a gaspipe goes wrong:
We make a survey of Victoria Park,
We’re quite at home there in the light or the
dark.
Chorus:
But, ho! ho! ho! all classes shall go,
We’re all for the ’Varsitv now. What Ho! (bis).


111.
Girls:
We’re ’Varsity girls of all factions and creeds,
In mortar and gowns arrayed,
With minds full of awe of the Profs, and their
deeds,
And hair of the latest shade (bis).
We’ve lady physicians and scientists rare,
And lady B.A.’s can be seen everywhere,
And though on our platforms no greasers appear,
Yet some day we’ll turn out a girl engineer!
Chorus:
But, ho! ho! ho! all classes shall go,
We’re all for the ’Varsity now. What Ho! (bis).
IV.
Law and Arts:
We’ll sing you a song of the wig and the gown,
And classic austerity,
Of Crimes Acts and torts, and old property laws,
Of briefs and a thumping fee (bis).
We’ll tell you of Peden of Bye-laws the King,
Of Jordan, the fire engine lecturer sing,
And if you are late forty minutes or more,
It won’t matter much if you’re studying law.
Chorus:
But, ho! ho! ho! all classes shall go,
We’re all for the ’Varsity now. What Ho! (bis).
1912.


27. A MEDICAL SONG.
(Air: “Marching Through Georgia.”)
1.
Stimulate your vocal chords and sing a final song,
Sing it with a vigour that will shift the roof
along,
Sing it as we used to sing it, lustily and strong,
While we were passing through Medicine.
Chorus:
Hurrah, hurrah, they’ve dubbed us all M. 8.!
Hurrah, we’re loose, enlarge the cemet’ry—
Yet we’ll miss the good old times, that never
more will be.
While we were passing through Medicine.
11.
How we used to curse and groan at every
’ology,
How the lectures always would induce somni-
pathy,
How wc always seemed to be ’twixt devil and
deep sea,
While we were passing through Medicine.
Chorus: Hurrah, hurrah, they’ve dubbed
us all M. 8.! etc.


111.
We ve known the fell post-mortem, for not sel-
dom we’ve been spun,
And now we ve floored the last of them we’re
sorry all is done,
For we had our share of toiling, but we had
our share of fun
While we were passing through Medicine.
Chorus: Hurrah, hurrah, they’ve dubbed
us all M. 8.! etc.
IV.
We’ll give a cheer before we go, a hearty cheer
and true,
For all the men who taught us, for the men
who’ve let us through—
Perhaps they did not teach us much, but they
taught us all they knew,
While we were passing through Medicine.
Chorus; Hurrah, hurrah, they’ve dubbed
us all M. 8.! etc.
E. S. Harrison, 1905.


28. MEDICINE.
Tune: “Clementine.”
I.
Not a thing new
Do we sing you,
But our subject is divine;
Voices raising
In the praising
Of our darling Medicine.
Chorus;
O my darling,
O my darling,
O my darling Medicine,
Where are Arts and Law and Science
When compared with Medicine?
11.
Mathematics
And quadratics,
And the square root of the sine,
x + yz.
Be advised:
Chuck ’em up for Medicine.
Chorus: 0 my darling, &c.


11l
Oft we hear men.
Second-year men,
Say the not-self’s very fine:
If they know it.
Let them show it:
Can she take her Medicine?
Chorus: O my darling, &c.
IV.
Lawyers wary,
Talk of ca. re.,
And of Paul and Modestine,
Torts and Trover;
Chuck ’em over—
Give ’em up for Medicine.
Chorus: 0 my darling, &c.
V.
Plasters, potions,
Legs and lotions,
Pills and blood and turpentine,
These and others,
O my brothers,
All are used in Medicine.
Chorus: O my darling, &c.
J. P. Pickburn, 1893.


29. A POST MORTEM.
(Air: “Tarpaulin Jacket.”)
I.
Let Crad. bear exam, sheets before me,,
Old Nick dirge his “ten minutes more,”
Jum’s stern glaring eye cannot awe me,
k Nor can Barff’s mighty arm of the law.
Lay me out and let Louis inject me,
Set scalpels and bones by my side,
Let Jummy and Barney dissect me,
While Taffy relates how I died.
11.
When the P.M. has reached its conclusion,
And my pieces are in statu quo,
Wind ’round me a liberal profusion
Of Louis’ best oilskins and tow.
Bear my bier on four stalwart femurs,
Remember, I died at my “post,”
Let sports all discard their ice-creamers
For one who has yielded the ghost.
111.
Cutaneous nerves aren’t invited;
They dealt out sore trouble to me;
Prosectors and Dems will be slighted,
For I don’t want a sad obsequy.


I reck not Jum’s sections and models,
His fame as a Brain Bottle-O,
Just so long as behind me there toddles
Old Sternum, the one bone I know.
IV.
Botanical slides may deride me,
The Lobster may giggle in glee.
Amoebae may chuckle and chide me,
And the Gastropods go on the spree.
I’m done with the B.N.A. Puzzle!
Its authors I’ll find down below;
Old Golgi and Jenner, I’ll muzzle,
And stain them with pigments they know.
1916.
30. REUNION SONG,
(Tune: “Old Folks At Home.”)
I.
When thus at times we meet together,
Friends, once again;
Old memories around us gather,
Joyous, yet mixed with pain:
Joy—for the dead past still is present,
All our life through,
Pain —for the future, howe’er pleasant,
May part us, friends, from you.


Chorus:
Though the world may strive to sever
Bonds so strong to-night,
Oh! comrades, let these mem’nes ever
Our hearts in love unite.
11.
Through all our days our Alma Mater
Shall guide our way;
And that from us no time may part her,
Is what we always pray.
And if at all in life’s probation
Hopeless we feel—
Rememb’ring her, fresh inspiration
Upon our hearts shall steal.
Chorus: Though the world, etc.
111.
Not memory alone shall bind us—
What’s past is done—-
But happy hopes shall happy find us—
The future shall be won.
For wider sympathies, my brothers,
And men more free
Are coming: broader then than others
Let Alma Mater be.
Chorus: Though the world, etc.
H. A. Russell.


31. THE SCHOOL OF LAW.
(Air: “The Poacher.”)
I.
Let no man speak his mind in Greek,
Or tell his love in Latin;
Closed for repairs be all the chairs
That Science Profs, have sat in;
Let Medicine go peak and pine—
We do not care a straw;
We’ll be K.C.’s and earn our fees—
We are the School of Law!
11.
We don’t know much of things that touch
Forensical transactions,
Tho’ practised well, as you may tell,
Concerning civil actions;
Refreshers, too, we swear to you,
As taken at the Bar—
Altho’ the word we’ve often heard,
We don’t know what they are.
111.
We still have got to learn a lot
Of divers kinds of sinning,
Yet don’t despair of getting there—
We’re only just beginning.
We’re simple youths, who hate untruths:
It passes our belief
That black is white, or wrong is right—
Unless it’s in the brief.


IV.
W ith crime and tort of every sort
We’ll soon familiar be,
And learn by heart the secret art
Of wilful burglaree;
We’ll be acquent with fraudulent
Device of every sort,
And reach in time the height sublime
Of gross contempt of court.
V.
Then down with Arts in all its parts,
And down with Mathematics—
With Integral, Binomial,
And Simple and Quadratics.
Our trust we place in Shelley’s case,
And logic without flaw;
We’ll beard the Bench and never blench—
We are the School of Law!
R. R. Garran.
32. THE SONG OF THE ENGINEER.
(Tune: “No Possible Doubt,” from “The
Gondoliers.”)
Let doctors hunt for the festive germ
And lawyers talk and reason;
But iron and steel are the stuff for me,
And concrete made of one to three,
And timber cut from the ironbark tree
At the proper time and season.


Chorus:
For second to none is the Engineer
To Kaiser, King, or Sirdar;
He makes a trestle, a dam, a pier,
A toasting-fork or a cask for beer,
A roof or a plate-web girder.
11.
For others may talk of the modest maid.
And the charms of Jean and Nellie;
But the cold grey engine is our delight,
With its shining crank and cylinder bright,
With its genial smile, and its jovial might
As it squashes a man to jelly.
Chorus: For second to none, etc.
111.
And nought to us are letters, and art,
And music, and soulful blisses:
But give us plenty of sweat and toil,
When the clothes are covered with grime
and soil,
And the hair is dripping with grease and oil,
And the steam-valve kicks and hisses.
Chorus: For second to none, etc.
H. E. Whitfeld, 1900.


33 - SONS OF EVE.
(Air; “Tramp, Tramp, Tramp.’’)
I.
Sons of Mother Eve are we
Climbing up the knowledge tree,
While the moonbeams glint we scan the storied
page;
When the day-man’s work is done
We have only just begun
All our thirst for information to assuage.
Chorus:
Hark, boys, hark, the hour is striking,
On to lectures we must speed;
Take the final hasty munch
At the genial counter-lunch
Puff the final hasty pipe of fragrant weed.
11.
Some of us are pinched and pale,
Many more are stout and hale;
Life is but an ever rushing swirl of work—
Some in spite of every boast
Stumble on the yearly “ post,”
For the fell exams in darkling ambush lurk.
Chorus:
Cheer, boys, cheer, the hours are fleeting,
Hold them ere away they speed;
Though the night be dark and long,
Banish care with ale and song,
Not to mention peaceful puffs of fragrant weed.


111.
Oft we falter as we climb,
Oft we waste the precious time;
Many of us may possess a girl or two
And occasionally roam
Where the starlit breakers foam;
Well, you can’t exactly blame us if we do.
Chorus:
Cheer, boys, cheer, the years are rolling
Down their academic way:
Drain the lager, and with glee
Hail the day that sets us free
From exams, and bulldogs’ everlasting bay.
IV.
Time will come when studies seem
Nothing but a fevered dream,
Chaucer in oblivion’s dust-heap may be laid;
Maths, and Physics—all the list
Vanish like a morning mist,
But the memory of our comrades ne’er will fade.
Chorus:
Drink, boys, drink; the years are speeding:
Drink the final toast with me —
Let us drink it as we stand
In a firm fraternal band
To our comrades and our grand old ’Varsity.
C. Collins, 1909.


34. STUDENTS’ CHORUS.
(Tune . Hi-tooral-i-ooral-b-addity. ”)
I.
From lecture-room, stud}' and college,
A motley assemblage are we:
We represent all kinds of knowledge,
We re students of every degree.
In front sit the reverend twentv
Who portion our destinies out;
Down here are the year-men in plenty—
They’ll pass in a crowd, we’ve no doubt.
11.
W e can each of us blow our own trumpet,
Though we’re rather deficient in brass;
For the drum, there are plenty to thump it,
And our belles you can hardly surpass.
We have ladies to sing the soprano—
Just list to their silvery tones—
We’ve an organ in place of piano,
But the medics., alas! have no bones.
111.
We think you’ll agree it’s a pity
The Registrar made such a choice,
For his solo was not very pretty,
Though he was in excellent voice.
We hope that the songs we have sung you
With your taste and your fancy agree,
And that all the reporters among you
Are pleased with our annual spree.
R. R. Garran, 1889.


35. TOBACCO.
(Air from “A.S. Song Book.”)
I.
Come, smokers young, come, smokers old,
Come gather round, ye smokers bold,
And sing with me right lustily
The praises of Tobacco.
Chorus; To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
The praises of To-bac-a-bac-a-bac,
To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
The praises of Tobacco.
11.
“All things,” quoth old King Solomon
In mortal desperation,
“Are vanity”; but then, you see,
He’d never smoked Tobacco.
Chorus: To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
He’d never smoked, etc.
111.
“A Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,
A Flask of Wine, a Book, and Thou”—
’Twere still no less a wilderness
Without some good Tobacco.
Chorus: To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
Without some good, etc.


IV.
The Arts-man in Philosophy
Hears Ethics spouted wearily:
The summum bonum he doth know
Is a pipe of good Tobacco.
Chorus: To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
Is a pipe of good To-bac-a-bac-a-bac,
To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
Is a pipe of good Tobacco.
V.
Ihe man of Law, although in crimes
From Nero up to modern times
So deeply versed, yet placeth first
The duty on Tobacco.
Chorus: To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
The duty on, etc.
VI.
Though each and every Faculty
Claim King o’er all the rest to be,
All yield with grace the pride of place
To the King Supreme, Tobacco.
Chorus: To-bac-bac-bac, To-bac-bac-bac,
To the King Supreme, etc.
P. A. Todd, 1906.


36. THE UNION CHANTEY.
(For Clubable Men.)
(Air: “A-Roving.”)
I.
One night at large on the Pleasaunce,
Mark well what I do say,
One night at large on the Pleasaunce,
I met the ghost of A. L. Launce,
It walked with Dr. Johnson there,
And E. R. Holme.
Holme, Sweet Holme! Holme, Sweet Holme!
Our Holme is at the Un-I-on,
Who built the. blanky Un-I-on?
Why, E. R. holme.
11.
They tuk me in to ’ave Tgh Tea,
Mark well what I do say,
They tuk me in to ’ave Tgh lea,
See Union notice number Three,
Me, Dr. Johnson, A. L. Launce,
And E. R. Holme.
Holme, Sweet Holme! Holme, Sweet Holme!
Our Holme is at the Un-I-on,
Who writes the blanky not-I-ces?
Why, E. R. Holme.


111.
I walk into the Readin’ Room,
Mark well what I do say,
I walk into the Readin’ Room,
A voice assails me from ther gloom—
Ho! Smokin’, mate, is yere forbid,
By E. R. Holme.
Holme, Sweet Holme! Holme, Sweet Holme!
Our Holme is at the Un-I-on,
And who’s ther blanky Pres-I-dent?
Why, E. R. Holme.
IV.
Then fare we forth, but Lo the door,
Mark well what I do say,
Then fare we forth, but Lo the door
’S not wide enow to pass we four,
Me, Dr. Johnson, A. L. Launce,
And E. R. Holme.
Holme, Sweet Holme! Holme, Sweet Holme!
So Holme’s still in the Un-I-on,
Who’ll fetch some blanky Ant-T-pon
For E. R. Holme!
C. O. G. Donovan and S. M. Graham, 1913.


37. THE VARSITY COOKERY BOOK
(Tune: “The Tin u-ee Gee.'’)
I.
Dissolve a quadratic, a style Socratic,
La Fontaine and old Aesop,
Pour in a bottle of chilled Aristotle
And flavour with essence of “ shop,”
Colour with Chaucer, cool in a saucer,
Skim all ideas away,
Inflate the mass with loads of gas
And greet my Lord B.A.
11.
A thumping fee, rascality,
A corkscrew wig for show,
A leather lung, a rattling tongue,
And a smack of Cicero:
Strain off the sense and make it dense
With logic too fine to see,
Encase when fried in an elephant’s hide,
And bow to your LL.B.
' 111.
Stew the missing link in molten zinc,
Boil down the tail for dripping:
Mix cobalt blue with a fossil zoo
And Ueberschiebungsklippen;
A deinosaur, an artesian bore,
Specific gravity,
And a little astronomy used with economy,
Turn out your B.Sc.


IV.
A carcase ripe of the toughest type,
Some virulent fever germs,
A tortured dog, a mangled frog,
And Latinised medical terms:’
W hen boiling the pot is, a nice epiglottis
Will bring it to a head,
And an endless bill (the bitterest pill)
Completes the brazen “Med.”
V.
Carefully pestle a sway-braced trestle,
A cam, and theodolite,
Screw a quarter-inch pitch on a three way
switch,
And baste with a “cylinder bright”:
Then mix a mine with a drowned turbine
And sluice with a barrel of beer,
And, brought to the boil with black train oil,
'Twill B.E. the Engineer.
VI.
Then give three cheers for the Engineers,
Arts, Science, Law, and Meds,
And here’s to the cram for the stiff exam.
That awaits their bursting heads.
Here’s to the Lord of the mortar-board,
To the coveted degree,
And chiefest still, through good and ill,
The Sydney ’Varsity.
L. H. Allen, 1901.


38. VIVE L’ANATOMIE.
(Air: “John Brown’s Body.”)
1.
In ancient times when J.on-y-Brown lay mould’-
ring in his grave,
A prehistoric Jummy came and hauled him to
his cave,
And carved him with the stone with which he
also used to shave,
In the days before the flood.
Chorus: He taught Neolith dissection,
Dinosaurian skin-reflection,
Pre-Adamite sagittal section,
In his old Vesalian cave,
11.
When Julius Caesar swayed the world with
terror and alarm,
Used Jummicus to demonstrate the muscles of
the arm,
To Horace and Maecenas on the little Sabine
farm,
With curved instrument.
Chorus: Publius Vergilius Maro,
Zeus and Catiline and Nero,
Learnt anatomy from our Hero,
With his curved instrument.


111.
In Richard s days the mould’ring corse of bold
bit Jon de Browne
Hung quartered on the battlements of Edinboro'
town,
Came Jummas with dissecting sword and cut
poor Johnny down,
And then he cut him up.
fcvr
Chorus: then Wat Tyler’s insurrection
Gave him bodies for dissection.
Preserved in Malmsey for inspection
By this long-lived leech.
IV.
Next Hawk-eye Jum, a medicine man in far
Amerikee,
Sets up dissecting wigwams ’midst the wild and
free Shawnee,
Skins Settler Brown with bowie knives and rubs
his hands with glee,
But throws his scalp away.
Chorus: Alas, and woe is me! The fact is
He indulged in this vile practice,
To throw the scalp away an act is
We can’t too much condemn.


V.
On marble table now unlucky Mr. Brown is laid,
Cutaneous nerves are cut away with blunt dis-
secting blade,
Prof. Jummy comes and looks and says, “Was
this done with a spade?”
And then goes marching on.
Chorus: Gone are spade and axe dissections,
Gone are bowie vivisections,
But in spite of these defections,
Jum goes marching on.
1912.
39. A WAY WE HAVE AT THE ’VARSITY.
(Air: “ For he’s a jolly good fellow.”)

And students are the race. Sir,
To drive dull care away.
Chorus: It’s a way we have at the ’Varsity
To drive dull cars away.

Down at the Tivoli, Sir,

Our foes we do destroy, Sir,
O! a student is the boy, Sir,
To drive dull care away.
Chorus: It’s a way, etc.
IV.
Aye, we think it is no sin, Sir,
To get an occasional spin, Sir,
So long as we’ve got the tin, Sir,
To drive dull care away.
Chorus: It’s a way, etc.
V.
At the College on the hill, Sir,
Of life we take our fill, Sir,
We’ll sing until we’re ill, Sir,
To drive dull care away.
Chorus; It’s a way, etc.

I would not change for thine.
11.
I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so much hon’ring thee,
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be;
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent’st it back to me,
Since when it grows, and smells, I swear,
Not of itself but thee.


47. THE DYING STOCKMAN.
(Air: “Tarpaulin Jacket.”)
I.
A strapping young stockman lay dying
His saddle supporting his head;
His two mates around him were crying,
As he rose on his pillow and said:
Chorus:
Wrap me up with my stockwhip and blanket,
And bury me deep down below,
Where the dingoes and crows can’t molest me,
In the shade where the coolibahs grow.

Oh! had I the flight of the bronzewing,
Far o’er the plains would I fly,
Straight to the land of my childhood,
And there would I lie down and die.
Chorus: Wrap me up, etc.

Then cut down a couple of saplings,
Place one; at my head and my toe,
Carve on them cross, stockwhip, and saddle,
To show there’s a stockman below.

Watchful and weird—l must go,
For it tolls the death-knell of the stockman
From the gloom of the scrub down below.

There’s tea in the battered old billy;
Place the pannikins out in a row,
And we’ll drink to the next merry meeting
In the place where all good fellows go.

When the soft winds are whispering low,
And the darkening sha.dows are falling,
Sometimes think of the stockman below.
Chorus: Wrap me up, etc.

48. GOOD OLD JEFF.
I.
’Tis just a year ago to-day,
That I remember well,
I sat down by poor Nelly’s side
And a story she did tell.
’Twas about a good old darkey, Jeff,
That lived for many a year;
But now he’s dead and in his grave
No trouble does he fear.
Chorus:
For good old Jeff has gone to rest,
We know that he is free;
Disturb him not, but let him rest,
’Way down in Tennessee.
11.
She took my arm, we walked along,
Into an open field,
And there she paused to breathe awhile,
Then to his grave did steal;
She sat down by that little mound,
And softly whispered there,
“Come to me, father, ’tis thy child,”
Then gently dropped a tear.
Chorus: For good old Jeff, etc.


111.
But since that time how things have
changed,
Poor Nell, that was my bride,
Is laid beneath the cold grave sod,
Down by her father’s side;
I planted there upon his grave
The weeping willow tree,
I bathed its roots with many a tear,
That it might shelter me.
Chorus: For good old Jeff, etc.
49, I CANNOT EAT BUT LITTLE MEAT.
I.
I cannot eat but little meat,
My stomach is not good;
But sure I think that I can drink
With him that wears a hood.
Though I go bare, take ye no care,
I nothing am a-cold;
I stuff my skin so full within
Of jolly good ale and old.
Chorus:
Back and side, go bare, go bare;
Both foot and hand go cold;
But, belly, God send thee good ale enough,
Whether it be new or old.


11.
I love no roast but a nut-brown toast,
And a crab laid in the fire;
A little bread shall do me stead:
Much bread I not desire.
No frost nor snow, nor wind, I trow,
Can hurt me if it wold;
I am so wrapped within and lapp’d
Of jolly good ale and old-
Chorus: Back and side, etc.
111.
And Tib, my wife that as her life
Loveth well good ale to seek,
Full oft drinks she till ye may see
The tears run down her cheek:
Then doth she trowl to me the bowl
Even as a maltworm shold,
And saith, “Sweetheart, I took my part
Of this jolly good ale and old.”
Chorus: Back and side, etc.
IV.
Now let them drink till they nod and wink,
Even as good fellows should do;
They shall not miss to have the bliss
Good ale doth bring men to;
And all poor souls that have scour’d bowls
Or have them lustily troll’d,
God save the lives of them and their wives,
Whether they be young or old.
Chorus: Back and side, etc.

Do ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay,
Do ye ken John Peel at the break of the day,
Do ye ken John Peel when he’s far, far away,
With his hounds and his hprn in the morning?
Chorus;
For the sound of his horn brought me from my
bed,
And the cry of his hounds which he ofttimes
led;
Peel’s view-halloo would awaken the dead
Or the fox from his lair in the morning.
11.
Yes, I ken John Peel and Ruby too!
Ranter and Ringwood, Bellman and True,
From a find to a check, from a check to a view.
From a view to a death in the morning.
Chorus; For the sound of his horn, etc.


111.
I hen here’s to John Peel from my heart and
soul,
Let’s drink to his health, let’s finish the bowl,
We’ll follow John Peel thro’ fair and thro’ foul,
If we want a good hunt in the morning.
Chorus: For the sound of his horn, etc.
IV.
D’ye ken John Peel with his coat so gay?
He liv’d at Troutbeck once on a day;
Now he has gone far, far, far away;
We shall ne’er hear his voice in the morning.
Chorus: For the sound of his horn, etc.
52. JUANITA.
I.
Soft o’er the fountain
Ling’ring falls the southern moon:
Far o’er the mountain
Breaks the day too soon.
In thy dark eyes’ splendour, _
Where the warm light loves to dwell,
Weary looks, yet tender,
Speak their fond farewell.
Nita! Juanita!
Ask thy soul if we should part;
Nita! Juanita!
Lean thou on my heart.


11.
When, in thy dreaming,
Moons like these shall shine again,
And daylight beaming
P rov e thy dreams are vain,
wnt thou not, relenting,
For thine absent lover sigh,
In thy heart consenting
Jo a prayer gone by?
Nita! Juanita!
Let me linger by thy side;
Nita! Juanita!
Be my own fair bride.

(Melbourne.)
(Tune: “Jingle Bells.”)

Dashing down the road

Bumping all the way;

And sometimes in the fence:
For we are all the way from ’Ome
To get Hexperience.


Chorus:

Jingle all the way;

In a plush-lined bullock-dray!
11.
The Kangaroo bounds by,
He’s shaky now with fear;
For the Henglish boys are nigh,
And sell their lives so dear.
So jingle down the road,
From care and sorrow free,
And soon we’ll rest and feed upon
The paddymelon tree.
Chorus: Jingle bells, etc.
111.
The boomerang may scream,
The mopoke want to bite;
The platypus may seem
A-spoiling for a fight.
But we brave Henglish boys
From danger never fly;
So off we go a-down the road,
And pass such ’errors by.
Chorus: Jingle bells, etc.

Under the turf where the daisies grew,
Listen to my tale of woe!

And their little souls to the angels flew,

Listen to my tale of woe!
But what of the peach of em’rald hue,
Listen to my tale of woe!
That was warm’d by the sun and wet by the
dew?
Ah! well, its mission on earth is thro’,
Adieu! Adieu!
Listen to my tale of woe!
Chorus: Hard trials for them two, etc.

Gone are my friends from the cotton fields

Gone from the earth to a better land, I know,

For my head is bending low,
I hear their gentle voices calling,

63. RIDING DOWN FROM BANGOR.
I.
Riding down from Bangor,
On an eastern train,
After weeks of hunting
In the woods of Maine;
Quite extensive whiskers,
Beard, moustache as well.
Sat a student fellow,
Tall and slim and swell.
11.
Empty seat behind him,
No one at his side,
Into quiet village, ,
Eastern train did glide.
Enter aged couple,
Take the hindmost seat,
Enter village maiden.
Beautiful, petite.
111.
Blushingly she faltered,
“Is this seat engaged?”
Sees the aged couple,
Properly enraged;
Student’s quite ecstatic,
.Sees her ticket “ through,”
Thinks of the long tunnel,
Thinks what he will do.


IV.
Pleasantly they chattered,
How the cinders fly!
Till the student fellow
Gets one in his eye.
Maiden sympathetic,
Turns herself about,
“May I, if you please, sir,
Try to get it out?”
V.
Then the student fellow
Feels a gentle touch,
Hears a gentle murmur,
“Does it hurt you much?”
Whiz! Slap! Bang!
Into tunnel quite,
Into glorious darkness,
Black as Egypt’s night.
VI.
Out into the daylight
Glides that eastern train,
Student’s hair is ruffled,
Just the merest grain,
Maiden seen all blushes,
When then and there appeared,
A tiny little ear-ring
In that horrid student’s heard.


64. THERE IS A TAVERN IN THE
TOWN.
I.
There is a tavern in the town, in the town,
And there my true love sits him down, sits him
down,
And drinks his wine ’mid laughter free,
And never, never thinks of me.
Chorus:
Fare thee well, for I must leave thee,
Do not let the parting grieve thee,
And remember that the best of friends must
part, must part;
Adieu, adieu, kind friends, adieu, adieu, adieu,
I can no longer stay with you, stay with you;
I’ll hang my harp on a weeping willow tree,
And may the world go well with thee.
11.
He left me for a damsel dark, damsel dark,
Each Friday night they used to spark, used to
spark,
And now my love, once true to me,
Takes that dark damsel on his knee.
Chorus: Fare thee well, &c.
111.
Oh! dig my grave both wide and deep, wide
and deep,
Put tombstones at my head and feet, head and
feet,
And on my breast carve a turtle dove,
To signify I died of love.

L 1 nder the shade of a coolibah tree,

Waltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda,
You’ll come a-waltzing Matilda with me.”
And his ghost may be heard, &c.
