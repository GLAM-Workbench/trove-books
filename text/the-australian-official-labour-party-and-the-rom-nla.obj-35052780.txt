THE AUSTRALIAN LABOUR PARTY AND THE
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
Of recent years, especially since the establishment of
the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the Roman
Catholic Church in Australia has shown an increasing de-
sire to utilise the Labour Movement for its own ends.
Unfortunately, the Labour Party has on many occasions
allowed itself to be invaded by the insidious methods of
that Church, whose sole objective is to further the ends
of its own organisation, and which least of all desires the
fulfilment of many of the principal planks in the Labour
platform. That this connection between Romanism and
Labourism has passed beyond the stage of coquetry and
flattery has appeared abundantly clear in the last few
years. A glance down the list of Labour candidates at any
State or Federal election will show a remarkable propor-
tion of names of a strongly Irish flavour. This is par-
ticularly true of Queensland and New South Wales, and
applies in only a slightly lesser degree to Victoria, a State
in which a member of the Cabinet has recently declared it
to be true that the proportion of Roman Catholics in
the Public Service is unduly large, and can only be ac-
counted for by a decided preference being shown. The
two Conscription campaigns afforded an ideal opportunity
for the promotion of this u unholy alliance ? on the part
of the Roman Church. Disloyalty and self-interest com-
bined to produce a close comradeship between Irish
Catholics and Labourites. The astute Archbishop Mannix
seized the golden opportunity to capture the advanced
section of the Labour Party by preaching the gospel of
? Australia first,? and ?the sordid trade war.? Thus
Australian Labour has found that Saul also is among
the prophets. Labour leaders and many of the rank
and file have been heard to declare openly that the Roman

Church is the Church of the oppressed worker, and that
Daniel Mannix is Australia?s greatest man.
Now let us examine carefully this specious claim of
the Roman Catholic Church to be the friend of Labour,
the prophet of social reform, the promoter of popular
education, the supporter of equality and of universal
education. Let us look at some of the planks of the Labour
platform, and try to measure the fervour with which
the priests would work for the enactment of such reforms.
The Federal platform of the Australian Labour Party
declares that one of its objectives is the development in
Australia of an enlightened and self-reliant community.
It declares also for civil equality of men and women, and
for the employment of the Initiative and Referendum.
As is well-known, these and other planks of the Labour
platform are designed to promote the fullest possible
degree of liberty for all individuals in the community, to
ensure equality of opportunity and freedom from the
exercise of oppressive authority not subject to the people?s
will. Surely these are in agreement with the very founda-
tions of Roman Catholic thought, and are consistent with
its social policy through the ages! How utterly
absurd it is to expect that a Church, with such
a long record of persecution and oppression, a
Church which has stifled reason and held back the rising
tide of science and social reform in every country where
its baleful influence could be exerted, can possibly be the
sincere ally of Labourites and Socialists, whose whole
object is to substitute freedom for authority, equality for
privilege, and the common welfare for the luxury of the
few. The Labour Party believes in the rule of reason, the
Roman Church in the rule of dogma. Here is an official
statement of the attitude of the Roman Church to the rule
of reason. ?The demonstrations of reason cannot contra-
dict revelation, hence any assertions of human science that
are at variance with what the Church teaches to be
revealed must be false.? (Editor of The Messenger,
U.S.A.) Over and over again, the Roman hierarchy
has used this self-given authority to promulgate decrees
absolutely opposed to reason, and subversive of the very

objects of civil liberty, which the Australian Labour Party
claims it exists to further. In other directions, also, this
Church shows the greatest tenacity to ideas which the
average Labourite or Socialist regards with contempt and
abhorrence. The same writer says, ?Those who, with the
aid of God?s grace, fulfil the obligations of virginity or
celibacy live in a state more holy and better than the
state of matrimony.? And this after stating that Christian
matrimony is one of the great sacraments of the Church!
Socialist thought in all countries is utterly opposed to
the idea that the love of man and woman is in the
slightest degree inferior in morality or holiness to the
single state. Indeed, it may be said that there is no
organisation in the world but the Roman Catholic Church
which establishes as the holiest state of human beings one
which casts a slur upon the most beautiful of human emo-
tions, and would, if made universal, lead to the extinc-
tion of the human race?God?s own creation. It is well
known also that the majority of Socialists are rationalistic
in their thought, if not out and out freethinkers. Let
the Australian rationalist Labourite listen to this: ?At
the hour of death, each soul is judged by Christ, and if
in mortal sin, is condemn* ! ��eii to be punished by
eternal torments, varying in intensity according to the
degree of guilt.? We offer no theological criticism of
this doctrine of mediaeval vindictiveness; we content our-
selves with asking members of the Australian Labour
Party how it fits in with their well-known belief in the
spirit of mercy and their gospel of human brotherhood
and salvation for all.
When the Socialist movement in Europe was assuming
considerable proportions in the 1870?s, the Papacy began
to show extreme nervousness at the tendency shown by
some Catholics to regard Socialism with a friendly eye.
The Pope?s encyclical of 28th December, 1878, left Catho-
lics in no doubt as to the views of the infallible head of
their Church upon these doctrines. This document de-
clared that ? so great is the difference between their (the
Socialists?) wicked dogmas and the pure doctrine of Christ
that there can be no greater; for what participation has

justice with injustice, or what communion has light with
darkness ?? There can be no mistake about that attitude.
But in the thirty years? interval, the Roman Catholic
Church has found it impossible to maintain in its uncom-
promising rigour this position of absolute suppression of
advanced economic thought amongst its members. We
have, therefore, been treated to interesting qualifications of
this extreme hostility. There has actually arisen a Roman
Catholic School of social reform, which some writers refer
to even as Catholic Socialism, a title which its adherents
violently repudiate. Their views can be learned by all
who care to read them in the writings of Le Play, Nitti,
Demolins, The Abbe de Tourville, and others. To be-
lievers in the Labour platform and to Socialists, the most
interesting point about this school is that it makes per-
fectly clear that it does not in any way threaten the
existing institutions of the social system. It expressly
believes in private property, the w 7 age system, the right of
inheritance, and interest and profits. Without expressing
any opinion of the relative merits of socialistic doctrine
or the attitude of the Roman Catholic towards it, it is
surely clear that this acknowledged school of Catholic
reformers is decidedly hostile to the ideas of State So-
cialism prominent in almost every plank of the Labour
platform. These Roman Catholic reformers, while de-
nouncing the evils of the present system, have no belief
whatever in the progressive evolution of the human race,
and constantly attack the doctrines of the French Revo-
lution and of the liberal reformers who arose as a conse-
quence of that disturbance. They declare their firm belief
that the social order can only be maintained by authority
?that of the father in the family, of the employer in the
workshop, and of the Church in society. There we have
the crux of the difference between Labour and Catholicism.
The latter believes in up an authority in the
various departments of the citizen?s life and demanding
of him unquestioning obedience. The Labour Party
stands for increasing freedom to every individual by im-
provements in his social environment, so as to release
his energies for the work of citizenship. It is unthinkable

that such a Church would ever regard an alliance with
Labour from any other point of view than its usefulness
in helping it to accomplish its main object, that of im-
posing its authority upon the greatest possible number
of human beings. For this purpose, the authority of the
employer is to be made permanent, the very antithesis
of the objective of the Labour Party. The Catholic school
of social reformers, therefore, accepts the wage system as
not merely a normal condition, but even as a beneficial
system, Again we express no opinion as to the relative
merits or demerits of these views, but any attempt to
reconcile Catholicism with Socialism must be an utter
failure. Even if these reformers were entirely and
achieved their objects of social reform, what possible
chance would they have of proceeding to any lengths
without the sanction of the Holy See, which would never
tolerate any real increase in the liberty of the individual
worker which threatened the authority of the priest over
him. The social conditions of countries in which the
Roman Catholic Church has long been predominant are
infinitely worse than those of Protestant lands. The Aus-
tralian Labour movement, which stands for a high level
of social welfare, should examine the conditions of the
common people of Spain, Italy and Austria, which are
held strongly in the grip of Catholicism, before they run
the risk of even a shadowy alliance with a Church whose
interests are bound up with the suppression of true social
progress. It may be argued that there are many in-
stances of priests and the Roman Church rendering assist-
ance to poor boys for their education, or of exercising
themselves in works of Christian charity. That the Roman
Church does employ itself in such good work no one can
deny. But it is not too much to say that the brilliant
boys it selects for training are offered such opportunities,
not for their own personal good or for the benefit of
the community, but to make them fitter instruments of
the hierarchy. Further, the works of charity performed
by this Church never, for one moment, are allowed to
threaten its superior position of authority. One wonders
what the official Roman Catholic thinks of the plank in

the Victorian Labour platform which demands State con-
trol and administration of charitable institutions, such
as hospitals and asylums, and that all education shall be
free and secular. These two demands threaten the interests
of Catholics on what they regard fundamentally as proper
activities of their Church. Is it likely that there can be
any possibility of any kind of alliance between two bodies
with such wholly antagonistic aims? The truth is that
the Roman Church in Australia hoped to win from
the Labour Party the subsidisation of their schools
by the State. They have hitherto failed to do so, but hope
for a great extension of their power by dominating the
Public Services, and by seizing every opportunity to place
their adherents in important positions in the Labour move-
ment. To the degree to which they succeed, the Labour
Party?s activities will be stultified. Whatever happens, _ the
Roman Church will never give up its doctrine that it is
superior to the State. In the words of one of its divines,
? The Church was established by Christ as a perfect, inde-
pendent religious society. Its authority depends on God?s
ordinances alone; wherefore, it has always denied any
right on the part of the State to interfere in its internal
affairs. In Catholic countries, the Church claims immunity
for its officials from the authority of civil tribunals.?
Constant insistence by the Pope on his right to temporal
power is all in the same direction. What would happen
to free Australia, and to the Labour movement, if a Church
with this idea of the State ever became paramount? It
would be the end of the liberties which Australians have
learned to cherish. Let the Labour Party see to it that
its machinery is not exploited in the interests of an or-
ganisation whose spirit is entirely opposed to the sway
of reason and equality. While the Roman Church has
for centuries opposed equality of opportunity, it is never
tired of crying out in Australia in favour of such an
equality, since it is favourable to a minority that loses
no chance of pushing its interests.
This chapter is written by a unionist of many years?
standing, who dreads the capture of the Labour movement
by any power that would exploit it for its own ends.
