MAN AGAINST DARKNESS
Because of them *
the men illustrated in the pages that fob
low—we enjoy a world wherein igno-
ranee, disease, intolerance, and poverty
are swiftly becoming things of the past.
HEROIC PIONEERS—OPEN
MINDS . . . these illustrious individuals
often sacrificed their very lives in the
interest of their ideals and humanitarian
aims.
It behooves us to cherish the heri-
tage of enlightenment they bequeathed
to humankind.

Consequently, those who sought it and attempted to expound it to their fellows be'
came the objects of persecution by tyrants. The tyrants were the ancient dictators who
sought to dominate the lives and thinking of men and women to further their own per'
sonal gain or their beliefs. For example, the Roman Emperor Justinian was one of these.
He was a misguided religious zealot who issued an edict in the sixth century seeking to
abolish all the mystery schools. He considered men and women who had acquired per'
sonal power and great confidence in themselves —by the unusual knowledge they had
discovered —a menace to the orthodox and often superstitious dogmas which he wished
to promote. Thus it became necessary that this wisdom be secreted and kept for the
inquiring, courageous few out of every thousand persons.
This amazing knowledge, which secret brotherhoods have preserved, is available to-
day to the seeker for personal power and the mastery of life. The oldest of these broth'
erhoods, world'wide in extent, and not a religious sect, is the Rosicrucians. It offers
you this knowledge as old as time, devoid of religious intolerance, and without political
or other prejudices or biases.
Write today for the free booklet, The Mastery of Life. It explains who and what the
Rosicrucians are and moreover how they can help you with your own life. Address:
