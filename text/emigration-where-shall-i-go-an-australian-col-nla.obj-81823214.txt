EMIGRATION! WHERE SHALL I GO ?
The other day, when sitting on the knifeboard of a London
omnibus, I fell in conversation with an intelligent young
man, about the ? bad times? of Old England and the claims
of emigration. On parting, he said to me, ?If you will
only print what you have now told me, you will be a public
benefactor.?
After a number of years? absence from Europe I came to
have a look at the dear old land of my fathers. Like all
colonists, I cherish a veneration and love for Britain. It is
a glorious country. Its historic associations, its high civiliza-
tion, its sympathy with noble deeds, its struggles for free-
dom, its diffusion of right principles, all tend to make it the
one favoured and the favourite spot of earth?the shrine and
the asylum. But, though only a short time here, I have not
failed to see and hear of things which have cast a shadow
over my visit.
Did I belong to the privileged class, inheriting a fortune
made by others, and reared to a fancy that I was formed of
finer clay than the many, I might have been content to
enjoy myself, and leave the rest wuth a shrug of pity 1 But
feeling my countrymen bone of my bone, and flesh of my
flesh, I cannot look upon the almost hopeless struggles of
honest men, and the tearful glances of women fainting under
their burdens, without a sigh of sorrow, without a wish to
help them if I can.
I talk with a business man here. He tells me that com-
mercial affairs are gradually being gathered into the hands
of the great merchants, and that the small men have to sink
to subordinate positions, or maintain a hard stand-up fight
for a living. I address a manufacturer, to learn the same
A 2


truth : the overgrown capitalist is gradually drawing the
trade from the little masters, and dropping them down to
the level of artizans. I turn to a comfortable-looking tenant-
farmer, and congratulate him upon his pleasant homestead
and his smiling fields. What is his reply? ?Ah, sir !it
won?t be long mine, the big men are swallowing up the
small farms,? ? And what will become of the noble yeo-
manry of England ?? said I, ? They will have to become
labourers,? was his sad and sullen answer.
One can see every morning omnibuses streaming toward
the City, and trains from every quarter rushing thitherward,
all crowded with well-dressed gentlemen bound for business.
Many thousands are clerks and storemen, occupying
responsible situations of trust. Their turn-out for the day
evidences care to present a respectable appearance. But a
little inquiry leads me to their ? hard times.? Their salaries
are small, and living is high. Their incomes get no greater,
but their expenses do. They must be humble, and not ask
too loudly for shorter hours or more pay, for a hungry multi-
tude are waiting without for a dim chance of stepping into
vacant places.
Then the professional men, like the clerks, speak of ? hard
times.? There is such competition ; there are such increas-
ing tricks of trade ; there are higher rents and rates; families
are much more expensive than formerly. ? True,? I have
said, ?but why not cut down your expenses?? There, I
find, I touch a sore place. Everybody feels the pressure,
laments the pressure, but despairs of lifting off a pound of
the pressure. On the contrary, everybody seems to believe
that somehow or other a few additional pounds? weight must
be borne. The wife and girls must not be shabby, and the
claims of fashion are inexorable. Could they possibly go to
church with that bonnet another Sunday ? Then the lads
cost so much more. They are not content with dresses their
fathers would have worn in boyhood; they do not go to
schools now, but to colleges.
? But why not send the lads out at the age you went to
labour?? I have sometimes said. Then I am told that I
know nothing about English changes, for that boys have
higher notions than formerly, and society thinks their educa-
tion would be thrown away if they went into a shop, &c.


?What about the girls?? I next inquire. That question
sadly tries the distressed father. He loves the dear lassies
(who doesn?t ?) ; he has given them, at great personal sacrifice,
many scholastic advantages ; he has let them grow up pretty,
talking, musical dolls; and he hopes?hopes?that some
highly respectable gentlemen will appreciate his efforts in
raising so improved a stock, and take them off his hands for
the adornment of fresh-furnished drawing-rooms. But if
the girls don?t go off (and the manufactured article hangs
terribly on hand), why ?they will have to he kept. They
can?t do much, and generally are too weak and sickly to do
anything, even if they knew how. So the dear old mother,
to save the girls, redoubles her labour; and the wmrthy
father drags his weary limbs to town, works extra hours,
submits to more mortifications, and deprives himself of little
comforts, that the girls may live at home. And the girls
seem willing to stay at home, having no energy, will, or
impulsive principle to labour outside.
These are the sights which trouble a returned colonist.
These are the terrible evils which make ? hard times? still
harder to bear, and which will pull down Britain?s greatness
sooner than all Church disestablishments will!
But I have a look at the working classes, the bone and
sinew of society. The bone is plain enough to be seen
through the thin wrapper, and the sinew seems relaxed, com-
pared to what I knew thirty years ago. I want to know
why; and am told by one ? It?s the cursed strikes ! ? by
another ?The people drink;? while a third asks-with wonder
how anybody can be fat now that the Irish Church has gone.
Yet I fancy the leanness and weakness may be owing to
want of good and wholesome food, and that not a little due
to the jovial condition of the publican. As to the poor
children of the great cities, it almost breaks one?s heart to
see their pallid cheeks and their sunken eyes.
Work there nmst be in plenty, judging by buildings climb-
ing up the cosy retreats all round London, invading lovers?
walks, and clearing off the woods I used to know, as with
the scythe of a cyclone. But lam told labour and capital
don?t get on well together : the pocket is proud, and the
hand is stiff. Anyhow, the workman has no rosy times, and
his wife cannot flaunt in silks and satins. In many trades


the work is going out of the country; foreigners work
cheaper : that means, they pay less rent, can wear rougher
clothing, and can live on food which Englishmen who do an
honest day?s work could never thrive on.
I wonder not at the cry for Protection; the drowning
man grasps at a straw. The tardy talk about technical
education, long ago given to the German workmen; the
slow movement toward an understanding between capital
and labour; the awakening perception of the claims of
reciprocity in trade; the very partial removal of gross in-
justice in Church and State; the dawning knowledge that
the masses are slipping away from the adhesion of the body
politic, in opinions as well as sympathies : all come with the
murmur of an approaching ethnic storm, and a class tempest,
that will try the skill of statesmen, and the faith of all.
I have fallen in with a class of fine, athletic, handsome,
and well-educated young men, the pride of England, and
unmatched in the world : fellows that can bat, box, race, or
row all creation. I ask these splendid youths of physical
prowess and moral energy what they mean to do for a living.
They seem puzzled. With a capital basket of tools handy,
and good head and hands for toil, they join the old cry, ? We
have no work to do.? And yet such men stand as if they
could clear a forest with a glance of the eye, or burst through
any amount of opposing difficulties. But, as they would
say, ? Oxford and Harvard, kings of the oar as they were,
wanted a clear space to row in.? They want room?an object
?a sphere. Show them what they can do, and see how soon
they will be at it. And what is there? A serried rank of
struggling workers tell them there is no room. Old uncles
and godfathers are plagued to get John a Government billet,
where, on a precarious and stinted salary, he may idle away
a few hours a day, and lose the glorious strength and will for
action he now possesses,
Mr. Mill and his co-workers are trying to lift woman up
the political ladder. But the effort, however laudable and
benevolent, to place her in a better social position has been,
in this frightfully over-competitive country, viewed as an
attempt to displace fathers of families to make room for
single females. Each man appears to be so alarmed about
the insecurity of his own position, that I should not wonder


at a co-operative undertaking to keep women out. And yet,
who that views English society can look unmoved at the
frantic graspings of suffering womanhood ? Who can with-
hold a tear at the spectacle of sorrowing gentility ? Who
can help fancying the contest in many a lady?s bosom between
penury in labour and affluence in vice 1 The boudoir at
Fulham is such a contrast to the close workshop, the ill-paid
classroom, the pinched-up home, that one must glory in the
virtue of British women that still can frown upon Formosa?s
shame.
The crowd of competing womanhood is one of the most
painful exhibitions of Old World civilization. Every year,
as I am told, the rivalry is getting ahead of the demand.
Every year there are relatively fewer marriages ; and thus
every year more helpless females, rendered more helpless still
by their miserable training, are crowding into the market.
? And now,? says the reader, ? after having probed our
national wound, what have ye to offer as a remedy V
It hardly becomes me, as a passing visitor in England, to
suggest a few things which may, at least, put further back
the evil day from some anxious one. If I have pictured
social deformities, it has been from regret, from real interest
in my country, from a wish to raise the burden. Legislative
enactments make more smoke than fire. Reform must come
from the 'people themselves. Why spend sixpence at a bar
growling over a penny tax ? Why squander all your income
to please Mrs. Grundy,?who thoroughly hates and slanders
you, ?when those poor girls you may leave behind you might
have a nice little annuity %
But all the economy in the world will not remove this
terrible competition, you say, or open out a workshop. The
country is done for, you tell me j at least, as far as you are
concerned. What are you to do 1
My answer is a simple one ; if this country won?t do, try
another. In a word, I reply, Emigrate !
? The very thing I was thinking about,? you say; ? but
where can Igo 1 The United States are getting as crowded
as England, besides being always on the move for the next


war. Canada is a bit of England, but a very cold one, and
rather overdone.?
What about Australia 1 ? Oh, that is?well?l don?t know
?there are so many opinions about it. Queensland must
be a good Banting-place; Tasmania is shut up; South Aus-
tralia is all copper; Western Australia is all convicts; and
Victoria is overdone with emigrants and democracy.?
Is this all you know about Australia 1 ?Not quite. We
have had Colonial Agents picturing lands flowing with milk
and honey, where vineyards and oliveyards reigned, where
forty bushels of wheat to the acre was the poorest crop,
where gentlemen got good salaries for doing a mei?e nothing,
where working men could be rich in twelve months, where
rain never came but when it w r as wanted, and where people
couldn?t die unless they drank themselves to death. Lots of
fools gave up good situations to taste the fruit of this Para-
dise, and got lots of gritty dust in their teeth for their pains.
No, no; I?m afraid of Australia.?
Well, my friend, it may be true that a little too much
colour has been laid on the picture by some that wanted to
bid high for your labour. It is also true, that at times a
flood of immigrants has set in too much for xis in the colony,
and they and we have suffered for it awhile. But it has
even astonished an old settler to see how quickly the plethora
has disappeared, and how soon again the cry has come,
? More labour wanted ! ?
? But are you sure I can get on if Igo 1 ? you ask. That
depends ?as the old saying is. '
First let us pitch on the likeliest spot to go to, and then
we will consider the question whether you should go.
All the Australian colonies are known to me, and I have
a good word to say for them all. If Queensland be hot, it
is wonderfully fertile. If mosquitoes do bother you there,
you have a magnificent range of country to dodge them in.
If you have large capital, you can take up a Eun the size of
Yorkshire; or, with a smaller one, can become a lord of the
wastes and a whipper-in of fat cattle.
If South Australia be copper, she is corn as well. The
finest of wheat, and the richest of fruit, are there produced.
Hot you would be in the summer, but the winter has the
most delicious climate that the globe can show. If not


possessing the material resources of her neighbours, she can
exhibit moral phases before which European civilization
might blush.
New South Wales, first in the roll of colonial settlements,
has much to be proud of besides her superior antiquity.
Though her streets are a little behind the day, they turn out
a splendid show of carriages. Though the ? Brickfielder ?is
a sore foe to breath and patience, the hills are Montpeliers
without miasma. Though the interior be occasionally very
hot and dry, it grows the finest wool, it yields unequalled
grapes or oranges, and throws out bunches of copper, nuggets
of gold, and darlings of diamonds.
Dear Tasmania, the Isle of Beauty, had the misfortune to
be tenanted by a lot of bad characters for a long time, and
so got a bad name. And yet, odd as it may be, this old
dust-hole of Britain has a larger percentage of children at-
tending Sunday schools than any place in the world ; and I
heard a good authority say that it showed the highest rate of
subscribing charity. For the present it is under a cloud, the
neighbour across the Straits has just opened such a fine shop,
with lots of goods, that its trade is running away. Worse
than that, the young men have been running away to larger
and better pastures. But those who seek a quiet, happy
home, in the climate most congenial to Britons, without the
summer?s scorch or winter?s frost, may do w r orse than nestle
in a soft Tasmanian valley.
Victoria, however, is the queen of the Australias. She
presents but one-fourth the space of her nearest neighbours,
but has by far the largest proportion of good land. She has
the gold of New South Wales, the wool of Queensland, the
grain of Adelaide. Her gold is the purest, her wool the
finest, her wheat the most plentiful. In climate, while warmer
than Tasmania, being able to revel in grapes and apricots,
she is much cooler than all the other colonies near. Her
plains feed more sheep to the acre, her valleys produce more
grain to the acre, her hills more gold to the load. For
picturesque beauty, though wanting in the sublimity of the
Alps and the grandeur of America, she has few rivals. Her
wooded heights, her gentle vales, her sunny streams, her
laughing glades, can please the vulgar eye, and rouse the
poet?s soul.
A 3


But it is not in the variety and extent of her natural
resources alone that Victoria has the pre-eminence. The
population is greater than any two of her neighbours; and,
removing one, is beyond the united totals of the rest. Civili-
zation has advanced in this, the youngest of the colonies,
very far ahead of the others. For her superiority of internal
trade and manufactures, ?her progressive development of
resources, and consequent increased demand for labour of all
sorts, ?she is, perhaps, indebted somewhat to the introduc-
tion of a partially Protective Fiscal Policy, of use in a colony,
if not for an old country. Thus the workman has been led
from the country to the town, and the pressure on the farm
and the mine has been spread through workshops. Men
have settled down and married the sooner and readier, and
so added to the national structure of strength and virtue.
Instead of money sent out of the country for the purchase
of goods, it has been spent in the place itself. Merchants,
instead of relying upon an import trade, have now erected
warehouses and manufactories, affording remunerative return
for the toil of many thousands of females in Melbourne and
elsewhere, in addition to increased occupations for men.
Parents have seen in this altered condition of things a better
chance for the employment of their children, and look with
more satisfaction to the colony as their permanent home.
What has been the further result ? Internal trade has been
so expanded that the country has been taken up for farms,
and a call is made for better means of transport. More
railways are required; more labour is wanted; and skilled
artizaus, and professional gentlemen, are summoned into
action. Few people could adequately estimate the amount
of intelligent labour now required in the colony. At first,
comparatively speaking, only diggers, shepherds, and carters
were wanted. Now, the surveyor, engineer, and scientific
farmer, in addition to the manufacturer, are asked for.
?But is the country prospering with all the work?? say
some. The last mail states that the revenue returns for the
last quarter showed an excess over that of the previous year
of �118,584 ?not bad for a young country with so many
claims for expenditure! In fact, a local paper, somewhkt
opposed to the particular fiscal policy of the present Victorian
Government, is so struck with the prosperity of the colony,


even in relation to tonnage, as to exclaim, ? The internal
resources of the colony are so great and of such an elastic
character, that it seems impossible, even by the most foolish
and retrograde legislation, to inflict more than a passing
injury upon the country.?
The intending emigrant must not fancy that he is going to
? barbaric wilds.? He will find in Melbourne a city superior,
perhaps, to any in Europe beyond the leading capitals, in
point of public buildings, public institutions, churches, and
schools. He will'see a magnificent Public Library, where the
working man may select his book from the shelves, without
the fear of his being supposed a thief or wanton injurer of
property. The Museum would be an ornament to some
European capitals. A most liberal and unsectarian system
of public instruction is efficiently conducted. The Post-
office is one of the largest and finest in the world. Churches
and chapels of all denominations are well supported. Public
parks and gardens are ou a scale befitting a people believing
in their own future. Water is supplied to the town with a
prodigality and of a quality that London might well sigh
for. A daily newspaper, the Argus, supplies fifty-six closely
printed columns of valuable matter. Every convenience, and
even luxury, of civilized life can be had.
But there are a few things the immigrant will not see.
There will be no workhouses. There will be the absence of
an East London development. There will not be the great
disparity of very rich and very poor. There will not be the
auxiety for the next meal. There will not be the fear about
the future of one?s family. There will not be the govern-
ment of an aristocracy, whether of birth or wealth. There
will not be a loss of citizenship because of poverty. There
will not be the denial of a vote to any man ; there will not
be interference with, or purchase for this vote, as the ballot
exists. There will not be a dominant Church; there will
not be, therefore, Dissenters. There will not be contentions
between Protestants and Catholics. There will not be, as in
Britain, an almost necessary antagonism of classes and
interests.
The Gold Diggings are not done yet.? Twelve new
gold-fields have been opened in Victoria alone during the


present year; and 329 new Companies, with a nominal
capital of �3,719,198 were registered in the same period.
Over one hundred and fifty millions of pounds worth of gold
have now been exported from Victoria. No; the Diggings
are not done yet. With a little capital, a party may lease a
patch of alluvial ground, and wash off the pretty nuggets;
or, they may dig out the golden stone, and amalgamate the
shining ores. Of course, as it often pays well, the work is a
speculative one. While the rash should keep at a distance,
the timid had better go to quieter pursuits.
There is this difference between working there now and
formerly: Leading gold-fields possess municipalities, churches,
schools, banks, substantial places of business, easy access by
railway to Melbourne, and a plentiful supply of cheap provi-
sions. You may work and live in more comfort now, if you
do not get the heavy finds.
Once all Gold, people forgot that Victoria had charms in
wool and land. Now that sheep and fields attract attention,
folks forget the gold. But there is plenty left for centuries
to come.
Steady work is found in the Companies on the Diggings.
Labour is wanted in the opening copper-mines. There was
a time when steady wages? work could not be had there,
now it is abundant. We have not the times there we had,
when a digger, converted from the sheepfold, and entreated
to go back to the straying flock, coolly offered his master a
pound a day just to rock the golden-cradle for him. We
have changed all that for the better. Now', the man who
goes to work at the diggings can get steady remunerative
wages, if not extravagant ones, out of which he may save if
he will.
To show the Diggings are not yet done, I may tell a story.
A Roman Catholic Irishman came home, fellow-passenger
with me. He had in former years worked on several of the
European railways while in construction. For twenty years
he was a drunkard, and spent his good wages; fortunately,
he had the good sense not to marry then, and so make
another miserable. Subsequently, he took the pledge, and
went out to Australia. There he worked with a shovel,
that Irishmen manage so well, and scooped up some fine
nuggets. He had to work long and hard to get the gold,


and he kept the pledge to keep his money. Now he returned
to the Old Land with the reward of his labour, and seriously
talked about ? picking up some young woman ? to shed the
radiance of her smiles within his cottage-home of ease.
In praising Victoria, I want not to run down other places.
It is just possible that some may find a niche in India, at
the Cape, in Natal, in Canada, in New Zealand, or in the
Zahara, they would never find in Australia. In India you
would be waited upon. At the Cape, or Natal, native labour
would save your hands. In Canada, or the States, the manu-
facturers might do better. In New Zealand are many
attractions, in spite of a Maori war. Even in Zahara a bold
trader could make a fortune. But climate is something. The
damp heat of India and the damp cold of New Zealand are
not pleasant to bear, any more than the exhaustion of Natal
and the cold of Canada. Civilization is something. If as
much money could be made at Natal, there would be there
nothing like the conveniences and comforts of Australia,
leave alone the School and Church question. Safety is some-
thing. Hindoos are very gentle, Maoris very intelligent,
Kaffirs very romantic, and Zulus very theological; but all
these races have an ugly way occasionally of spearing,
shooting, and even eating, colonists.
I prefer Victoria, not only because I think a man may be
able to get on better there, but because the climate is good,
civilization is advanced, and safety is secured. Our blacks,
if very useless, are very few, and very harmless.
As to the other Australian Colonies, I believe in them all.
My countrymen would not make a bad jump in going to
either. But from knowledge of all, from experience in all,
I hold Victoria superior to them all for the majority of
emigrants, though not for all.
Do not think of Victoria as it was.? We got a very
bad reputation from the letters of disappointed emigrants,
some fifteen years ago. Everything was bad then. Rogues,
mosquitoes, dust, mud, and misery abounded. The bush was
vile, the town worse. No employment to be had, and starva-
tion everywhere. I have fallen in with some of these corre-
spondents, and find them rosy, jolly, and satisfied. They
laugh at the epistles they sent, and say they were green then.


But the fact is, that no greater change has ever been pre-
sented by a country than by Victoria in 1854 and 1869.
An illustration will inform the reader. When I went first to
the Ballarat Gold Field, I had to plough through a vile,
unmade hush track, in the mud of which waggons had been
entombed for weeks. Provisions were at famine prices.
A night at a roadside tent, or so-called hotel, was a caution;
drunkenness and blackguardism seemed triumphant on the
route. On the diggings I found no church or chapel, no
school, no bank, no shop but for absolute necessaries. What
may now be seen by the traveller thither ? The very finest
finished Railroad, according to engineers, that the world can
show. The township has magnificent public buildings;
Hotels of gorgeous structure, seven Banks of pretentious
exterior, Churches of twelve denominations, a fine gather-
ing of schools and colleges, a noble-looking Hospital, a
flourishing Mechanics? Institution, and an Albert Hall for
lectures and meetings that will hold three thousand people;
yet it is only a provincial town.
The bush is threaded by railways, or by good roads formed
by local boards ; interior townships have developed improve-
ments under popularly elected municipalities; the central
government is liberally supporting local efforts; and the
revenue, which in our old country goes to pay unproductive
debts and a vast military force, is devoted in the colonies to
productive works, the spread of education, and the progres-
sion of real civilization.
Formerly, had you travelled, you would have been sorely
tried; I have paid sixteen shillings a night for my horse,
which got only straw to eat, and four shillings the meal for
myself of rough steak and no vegetables : now, our hotels, for
comfort, good food, civility, and just prices, will compete
successfully with those of England. The popularity of our
Spiers and Pond is owing to their carrying out our colonial
system of generous supply, and a generous trustfulness; a
man enters a bar there, throws down his sixpence, and helps
himself to any drink, in any quantity, he likes. Australians
may be trusted with this liberty; they can all be trusted
with a vote. That ought to say something for the country.
Formerly, you had to go far enough to get a school for
a child, or a church for yourself; our liberal land system has


helped to alter this, you need not go far for either. Though
the people have to pay for their own clergymen, they have
both will and means to do it.
Formerly, big fortunes were made by a few, and great
difficulties endured by many ; but now, the opening up of
avenues for labour, the equalization of prices, the distribu-
tion of goods, accessibility of the country, and a liberal
policy of government, have yielded more general happiness,
have promoted more general prosperity, even if the chance of
a fortune be dimmed.
Do NOT THINK EVEN OP VICTORIA AS IT IS, BUT AS IT
wile be. ? If Victorians are true to themselves, such resources
and such energy must produce a great country, ?such exten-
sion of education, such advance of the arts, such moral
appliances, must produce a happy country. If men go, let
them be faithful to their trust; and, for the State?s sake,
for their children?s sake, try and raise the colony in the
best and noblest sense.
Now for the interesting inquiry, ? Am I the one to go V'
If you have powerful friends, peculiar home ties, or a per-
manent and satisfactory situation, by all means stay where
you are : if you doubt your ability to contend with natural
difficulties in a new place, if you mistrust your heart in love
for work, if you be unwilling to sacrifice a little present good
for a future and greater advantage, stay where you are : if
you want only to sigh about the respectability you left
behind you, if you would think working colonists inferior to
refined idlers at home, if you intended to live there at great
sacrifice to your feelings, stay whore you are : but if you
are not afraid of work, not esteeming yourself superior to all
creation, not objecting to a few crosses at first, not alarmed
at a change of employment, not ashamed to save for a rainy
day, and not intending to be miserable, you might go in
safety.
The Man op Capital may go ; for he will find abundant
ways to lay out his cash to advantage. There is so much
energy there, there are such real hard workers there, there is
so great an amount of undeveloped resources there, that


money is more in demand than anywhere else in the world.
Men do not borrow there merely because they are in difficul-
ties, but because they are doing well, and can do better.
The Man with Brains may go ; for intelligence rules the
colony, and there is a market for talent of all kinds, though
less in the fine arts than in the industrial ones. I cannot
promise these gentlemen fine situations, at fine salaries, and
with fine hours. There is always, in every place, so large a
number of candidates for such distinguished positions, that I
can hold out small hopes to the sanguine ; but to the young
man of pluck and enterprise, with well-trained mind and
body, of really sober habits, and having command of even one
hundred pounds in a bank, I can safely prophesy a ? good
time coming.? No one can tell every applicant where his posi-
tion is in the colony. So many thoughtlessly rushed off in the
mad days of 1853, that we had a saying there, ? The new chum
expects to find a parcel of gold hung up in a gum-tree ready
ticketed for him.? It would be very nice to go to a situa-
tion already prepared, but such luck falls to the lot of few,
and to some of them it proves bad luck. A clear head, a
pair of ready hands, a civil tongue, a sober walk, and a
pound in the pocket, will carry a man forward in most
places, and pre-eminently so in Victoria. I know, too, that
the race is not always to the swift, and that even good and
clever men fail there ; so it will ever be. A certain number of
persons are run over in London every day in the year; let
us keep a sharp look that we escape, or make the best of an
accident should it come.
The Educated of both Sexes may go. ?Once we asked
for more ploughmen and more cooks. Now we advance
beyond that, and want men and women of a higher state of
qualification. With above a thousand public schools in
Victoria, teachers find room for themselves. With a great
increase of business, clerks increase in number. With several
hundreds of steam-engines on the diggings, engineers move
off. With greatly-developing works for manufacturing steam-
engines, ploughing, reaping, and thrashing machines, and all
the multiform appliances for making the most of raw produce,
we want skilled labour. We are making our own cloth there


now, and mills are rising about. Some English politicians
would find no bad market. Ministers have been wanted for
places only wild wastes a couple of years ago. The Roman
Catholics have a free scope and a fair field. The Bishop of
the Episcopalian Church, and the Presbyteries of the Pres-
byterians, have urgently written for more pastors. The
Wesleyans, too, of all varieties, are rapidly extending, and
so needing qualified preachers. When one Independent
Church can raise nearly twenty thousand pounds in three
years, and pay their minister about a thousand a year, it
is not wealth alone that is evidenced, but a demand for
educated teachers. There, pre-eminently, will energy and
ability find their reward.
We want, then, the educated and refined. The Argus last
mail wrote: ? Our immigration needs a larger infusion of the
middle and upper class element, in order to render our social
constitution a closer image, in its best features, of that which
is to be found at home. All must be workers here ; but the
work we have to perform will be executed all the more
efficiently and expeditiously, if society contain a fair propor-
tion of men and women with cultivated minds and refined
and gentle manners.? Gentlemen, therefore, of the stamp that
settled the early colonies of America, with all their enlight-
ened energy, their abundant means, their polished courtesy,
and their religious enthusiasm, would find a much more
prepared and propitious soil for their adventure in Australia,
than ever blessed Cavaliers and Puritans on that western
shore.
Farmers? Sons mat go. ?l should think so, when land
?and such land ! ?can be got on such easy terms.
Any man may go and select 640 acres, pay a rent of two
shillings an acre for thirteen years, and the farm becomes his
own! All his capital can go in fencing and stocking. It is
not rent, with the right of purchase; it is rent as a way of
purchase. The annual payment of two shillings includes rent
and purchase for the acre.
But I am told: ?A married man can get 160 acres in
the United States for nothing.? Some add to this, ? The
finest land the sun ever shone upon.? Indeed! Jonathan
is a ?cute fellow; and, with land fetching often from ten to


a hundred pounds an acre, he could make a capital offer for
your imaginary splendid farm. Land got for nothing must
be far out of the haunts of civilization, with many hardships
unknown in Australia. It is not, after all, on British land.
When one of my sons, having farming proclivities, had a look
at the Agricultural in the States, he was quite satisfied. He
preferred going back to a country where the fields were not
covered with snow half the year, but where the stock could
nibble the native grasses every month; where he was not
afraid of a bullet in faction-fights, but where good laws were
wisely and firmly administered, and men pulled together as
brethren. He went back to Victoria, and got a splendid
farm on the usual easy terms, in a lovely region, with a
climate owning neither fevers nor agues.
Many farmers? sons cannot hope to rent land at home, and
they have no wish to go as bailiffs, or to sink to be labourers.
They can, perhaps, get a little out of the parental ?old
stocking,? if the careful father could see the money would
not be wasted by the youngsters. Let them show the worthy
old man that there is a way to start life with fewer cares and
better prospects, though on the other side of the world, and
the purse will gape open.
But my advice to such would be: ?Let every Johnny take
his Jenny." Farmers? sons know farmers? daughters. Still,
as a little rough work has to be done, even there, to ensure
success, the Jenny that fights shy of the dairy, that sends the
maid to gather the eggs, that holds her nose in her father?s
farm-yard, that can?t bear the pigs, and dislikes the honest
brown hand, had better not be chosen by the adventurous
swain, I have one in my eye, who is up with her mate at
the lark?s gay note, who milks the cows while he is with the
horses or bullocks, greets him with smiles at breakfast, sends
him off with a lunch to the field while she carols at her
labour at home, receives him at eve with a sunny face and a
famous meal, and knows how to beguile the resting hour
with intelligent talk. She with her butter and eggs, he with
his corn and stock, together work in pleasant partnership for
days when strength may fail, but love grow never less.
Let every farmer?s son that goes to Australia be the true
Johnny in heart and will, and take the right Jenny as
his mate.


The Delicate and Sensitive may go. ?l have been much
struck with the marked difference between the men of Aus-
tralia and England. The former are healthier in aspect,
with clearer skin and less anxious look. The women are
most decidedly better in their physique. For a month or two
in summer the warm weather tries the delicate, but nothing
compared to the long winter period in England. I found
the cold east winds here in June, and perceive unmistakeable
signs of approaching winter now in September. It is so rare
to hear a cough in an Australian church ; it is so common
here. The number of pale-faced young men and frail-looking
girls, both in country and town, astonish me. Doctors say
that it is from leading an artificial state of life; necessitating,
as they tell their many patients, a recourse to alcoholic
stimuli for a low system. They do not prohibit the late
rising, the late sitting, the want of walking, the everlasting
reading of sensational literature, the indulgence in unhealthy
excitants, but ask them to be a little more artificial.
In Australia, with a more natural system of living, even
without the house-comforts they may sometimes enjoy here,
people eat, sleep, and laugh better. Ihe elasticity of the
atmosphere, the sunniuess of society as well as landscape, the
out-of-door weather there, operate powerfully on the nervous
system.
Here ill health, over-excitement, and want of real employ-
ment, are rapidly driving sensitive ladies to the very verge
of intemperance. Inclination for strong drink among our
fairest and most refined is, according to whispers in society,
fearfully on the increase. So was it in the days of the
fall of Rome. To many of these a removal to the colonies
would be a salvation. Though they lived there with fewer
luxuries, they might enjoy a tone of health, and a self-respect ,
which would lighten the burden under which they groan
here, and remove a secret grief from a husband?s breast.
Even Old People may go.? They get a new lease of their
lives out there. The warm sun, the clear atmosphere, the
buoyant air, the youthfulness of all around them, make the
old folks spring again. I wanted once to get at a mans
age, and said, ? How old are you, daddy V' ? I don t know,
said he; ?maybe Em seventy or so.? ?That won?t do, 1


replied; ? How long have you been out in Australia?? ? Just
fifty years,? he said. ?Were you in any battle?? I asked.
?Yes, to be sure,? cried the old fellow; ?I was sergeant
when old Bony was in .Egypt, and a Frenchman gave me a
lance in my side.? In fact, he was as near a hundred as
could be, and did not know it. He was living in a hut by
himself, his wife having died recently, and he had the right
use of his senses, and walked vigorously. In Hobart Town
I saw a man able to read without glasses, at something over
the century. He told me he was quite used to living now.
What a glorious thing it is for a young fellow to feel that
by going out to Victoria he may be able to send for his aged
parents! In England, if able to send them money, they
have a severe climate to contend with. Out there, after the
first outlay, their support would be trifling indeed in that
laud of cheap and wholesome food. What a happy thing for
the dear old couple to feel that a son or daughter will close
their eyes in peace! What a comfort through life for the
children to know that they were able to gild the evening of
their parents? days!
I have known plenty of old folks thus sent for by their
children. They had toiled on, and were getting weary, when
something better than ?the House? was put before their
eyes,?the comfortable homestead of a child in the far-off
land. Why! that thought alone is enough to make a young
fellow rush off while strong to battle for such a home.
Young Married Couples may go. ?l was lately pointing
out the advantages of emigration to a servant girl who
rejoiced in being ? followed? by ?a young man.? He was a
steady tradesman, and she a brisk, active lass. ? Marry and
go,? said I. With a few blushes and hesitating words, she
simpered out her unwillingness to get married yet. ?Hon-
sense, girl! what?s in the road?? I inquired. Another
pause, and then?? Mother married young, sir, and she has
eleven living children!? A Malthusian philosopher would
have gone into ecstacies, and have exhibited her as the
Model Maid of England. It was certainly a terrible warn-
ing that that mother presented to her daughter, who was
very naturally shocked at such a proximate fate for herself.
But, however proper for prospective maternity to look


before leaping in a country so crowded with mouths, with
food hard to get, and at a mounting figure, there is no
ground for alarm in Victoria. Why ! the Government there
positively offer quite a premium for infant production. They
say to the father: ?There is a fine tract of laud for your
son, as soon as he is big enough, at a nominal rent for a few
years, and then the grant is given to him.? They say to the
mother, ?Bless the girls ! how many have you got of them 1 ?
Such lots of lads prefer wives to servants at their little
homesteads we are spreading over the'country.? Don?t be
afraid, young men and young women. Marry honourably,
and don?t keep one another waiting. You may get into
trouble, one or both of you, by long waiting. Don?t be
frightened about cupboards and cradles there, especially with
cheap bread, and with mutton and beef at twopence or three-
pence a pound!
Marriages are getting rarer in England, and the pressure
is, consequently, harder upon females to find means of sup-
port. In answer to an advertisement last week, for a com-
panion to an invalid lady, there were 685 applications in four
days. The market is drugged. Many of these, most of these,
would have been married long ago but for the fear of men to
encounter responsibilities. This is not the place to argue
the question, but to note the fact. Many writers deplore
the consequences to the spinsters. lam sorry for the men,
and for society. Somebody once said, ? There is no necessity
for women to marry, but there is for men.? Long-standing
contracts gradually shrink up in the cold, and are forgotten.
This ought not to be. This need not be, in a colony. Society
there is less exacting. Young folks live less in awe of Mrs.
Grundy, and can set up housekeeping without heavy four-
posters, a ruinous bridal ceremony, and other absurdities of
a pseudo-respectability. They may absolutely live there
within their means, and suffer no reproach. No people in
the world are so generous in their hospitality, so liberal in
charities, so noble in support of religious and benevolent
institutions, as the Australian colonists ; and none are more
sedulous in piling up the dollars, and making a good provision
for a family?s future.
Men can afford to marry in Australia; and somehow, there-
fore, we are wanting there in that development of female


single-blessedness, doubly tried with poverty and unpro-
tectiveness. So many women are removed out of the labour-
market by marriage, that the rest have elbow-room and
better times. Fathers of girls should look at this interesting
announcement.
Respectable Servant Women may go. ?l do find wages
higher here than they were. But let me copy from the last
report from Melbourne. Speaking of the arrival of some
single girls, it says : ? Forty-two were retained in Melbourne
for hiring, and there were over one hundred applications to
engage them as domestic servants, at high wages.? What
are the wages ? ? General female servants for town, 261. to
30 1. per annum ; ditto, for country, to 40 1. ditto ; female
cooks, 651. to 4 51. ditto ; laundresses for town, 3(B. to iOl.
ditto.? That is not a bad ?do particularly when it is con-
nected with no bad chance of a pick for a husband. One of my
servants saved out of her wages in my service enough to pay
the assisted passage of five of her relations ; another got out
six, and another seven. I suppose they believed in the
country, or they would not have made such sacrifices. Then
houses are more comfortable than they were. We live in
English style,?except that of locking up the larder.
Supposing the girl should fancy the hedger and ditcher
before starting; what says the labour-market report 1
? Married couples (first class) for station, 80�. per annum ;
ditto (second class), 551. to 651. ditto ; ditto, with incum-
brance, iOl. to 501. ditto.? This all means with good
quarters for the night, and a most generous diet of lots of
beef, mutton, &c. The ? with incumbrance? deserves atten-
tion, A couple with, say, half-a-dozen children, are placed in
a house of their own, the whole family well-rationed, and 40�.
to 501. salary allowed; the greater part of which can be
saved to buy appliances for a farm for themselves. In my
wanderings through the bush I have known many a couple
more than satisfied with their position. Once riding up to a
hut, an Isle of Skye woman set an abundant supply of chops
and tea before me, after the generous style of country life to
strangers; and in answer to a remark of mine, said, ?In
Scotland, sir, we got only porridge ; here we have plenty of
good things for ourselves and bairns, and can put by most of
our wages.?


The Labouring Classes may go. ?As our working-men in
Victoria are, generally speaking, fairly educated, industrious,
and of a decent order, I have no wish to hasten the passage of
others whp would carry out ignorance, rudeness of manners,
and idle habits. Our labouring classes are a power in the
government of the colony. They know they are, and respect
themselves accordingly. They all possess a vote, and know
its value: they use it to return members who are interested
in the country, and they have no idea of selling their votes,
after the English fashion. Since they have held the franchise,
and used it, they have become elevated thereby. They read
more, think more, and drink less. They will thank me, there-
fore, not to give an invitation for all sorts of their fellow-
workmen to go over to Victoria. Let those of a worthy sort
go, and they will be kindly received. Let others go, and they
will get the cold shoulder. Let the intending emigrant read
and prepare for his future higher grade as a working-man
Avheu he gets to Australia. Half-workers are not wanted for
a country where eight hours make a day.
Of course, I cannot promise work, to all, especially upon
first landing ; nor assure a continuance of work at all trades.
Men going out must have intelligence enough to adapt them-
selves to changing circumstances, as they find grooves open
out for them.- Unless they have a pocket full of money, they
had better take anything that offers at first, till they learn
the fashions of the country, and seat themselves in the
saddle.
The question of wages is not all. A pound a day at the
gold-fever brought fewer comforts than five shillings now.
Rents are, perhaps, one-fourth the rate, and provisions can-
not bg gheaper than are. Vegetables and fruits are
finer and much cheaper than in England. The bread is un-
adulterated and delicious, at English prices. Meat varied o
late from Id. in the market to 3d. per pound, and that good
grass-fed meat. Luxuries are dearer than in England. Boots
and slop-clothes made in the colony are a little dearer, but
much stronger.
If, therefore, wages were the same, instead of being, as
they are, so much higher, there would remain a better
balance of profit to the workman than in England. One fact
is worth a world of argument; in no country of the globe


are building societies so patronized by the working classes as
in Victoria. All want to have a home of their own in eight
years.
The English workman is getting tired of England. I have
read placards and little bills posted about the East-end.
1 have read notices of public meetings among artizans.
I have watched the look and tone of the poor. All assure
me that patriotism is dying out in the ranks. They doubt-
less think the Queen is a good sort of a lady, but quite out
of their way. Once they had a kind of hereditary respect for
the parson, but that has oozed out long ago. They know
some noble legislators exist who earnestly desire to do them
good ; but they know, also, that very many do not. The
gulf is widening daily between master and man, as the one
gets up and the other down. A vain effort, called ? strikes,?
only shows them their weakness. They are losing heart
for the struggle \ they want to be off. The Basle Congress
shows how they dream of most impracticable things in their
despair.
Even the agricultural labourer is getting tired of his con-
tentment ; in spite of a probable two-pound-prize for thirty
years? service on one farm, without being a penny richer than
when he started in life. The train whisks by him, and seems
to say, ?Why do you stick there?? A fortnight ago I had
the folly to ask a Devonshire cottager the price of beef. She
fairly laughed at me for thinking she, that never tasted such
a luxury, could tell its price. I wonder whether she has
heard the tune of ? The Roast Beef of Old England.? Poor
soul! Old England was the time of her father or grand-
father. How she did stare when I spoke of farm labourers
getting meat three times a day in Australia !
What is to be done with these wearied ones ? Are they to
be left to hang upon your industry as paupers or felons?
or can some be helped off to relieve the crowding ? It is not
paupers we want, but those who, if not removed, may, much
against their will, become paupers.
The Colonies are part op England. ?Since I have been
in England, I have been shocked at the cool way in which
people talk of cutting off the colonies, just as if they were
ugly, painful, and unnecessary excrescences. Some com-


placently speak of the hen and her chickens, which seem
mutually glad to get rid of one another.
Why are you in a hurry to get rid of us ? We cost you
nothing in Victoria, and never have cost you anything as a
colony. The soldiers you send for our supposed protection,
but who are often the annoyance of our local magistracy, are
doubly paid and handsomely quartered. Though we take
nothing from you, we relieve you of your surplus labour, we
give a home to many of your troubled ones, we take millions
of pounds? worth of your products every year, and do some-
thing towards spreading the glory of Old England. We are
not grown chickens, to forget the parent in our pride. We
are children, reverencing the old mother who gave us birth,
and ready to sympathise with her in any sorrow, help in any
difficulty, and rejoice in any fortune.
It will be a bad day for England and her colonies when
they fall asunder.
Victoria is common ground for all
While we make room for thirty thousand Chinese IgitliSjjff
to run off with our gold, we should indeed rejoice to have
Germans, Dutchmen, Frenchmen, and Italians ; all live in
peace together. The Scotchman, of course, gets on there,
with his thrift, industry, and clannishness. I suppose
Englishmen like best to stand alone. An Irishman, as I
often found, is a capital colonist. We have no shooting of
landlords out there, no tenant-right agitation, no Irish
Church question, and no Irish beggardom. I cannot say
too kind a word for Irish servant-girls, whom I have there
found educated, faithful, and diligent.
Do NOT FANCY CHARACTER IS OP NO CONSEQUENCE THERE.
?The main cause of the failure of so many, even of the
educated, has been the want of moral ballast. At the time
of the gold fever we had a large shipment from Britain of
? ne?er-do-wells,? the plague and blight of homes there, who
carried their vices with them, did us considerable mischief,
and got no good for themselves. I have known many
lamentable cases of sons of gentlemen coming out to live a
wretched life, and die an early death. They fancied they had
but to show themselves, to get good situations; but they


ascertained that colonists preferred character to even the rare
ability of the applicants.
Drink is a great curse on the other side of the world, as it
is in Britain. It has spread the same misery in families, it
has arrested progress, it has blighted prospects, it has
destroyed reputation and existence. I cannot too strongly
insist upon the absolute necessity of a sober character. So
sensibly do I feel the importance of all resisting temptation,
that, if I could reach the ear of every intending emigrant, I
would say, ? Be a total abstainer, if you mean to be happy.?
Character is of great importance in the Colonies. One may
conceal his vices in Loudon, but not in Australia. The
colonists are determined, as far as possible, to protect their
families from an invasion of vicious immigrants. Badly as
they want labour, they will endure many inconveniences, and
bear many losses, rather than aid in the propagation of such
a moral pestilence. Start with a clean bill of moral health,
and do not let it get spoiled on the voyage.
Victoria will give a future to a Man. ?l should like
to know how many of the artizans, labourers, or even clerks,
in Britain or Ireland, have contemplated a future. It is too
painful to think about. The end must be one of dependence
in one shape or other. The father, in his pride, justly
shrinks at the alternative of going to the workhouse, or
leaning upon the limited wages of a son or daughter. In
Victoria, on the contrary, men look hopefully forward. They
work for that nice little cottage of rest in the evening of
days. No wonder, then, that I notice a difference in the way
men work here and there. A future puts nervous power in
the stroke of a working man.
Victoria is the Land for New Industries. ?Such
facilities are afforded by the Government, such a demand is
arising in the community, that a rapid extension of manufac-
tures of all sorts is a marked feature of the colony, and of
the times. Land is either given, or leased on favourable
terms, to those who would start an industry. There are
plenty of things yet wanting to be made there. A small
capital, with prudent management and persevering care,
would place a ingenious mechanist, or working chemist, in
hopeful circumstances.


Go there with the Intention to Work.? lt is a terrible
place for loafers. We have still slioals of them. They apply
like hungry wolves for a situation at a paltry salary, when
they could do so much better by stripping sleeve for work.
Parents shifted a lot of these shiftless creatures out to get
rid of them. The young fellows that won?t change, or can?t
change, often drink themselves to death. The young women
that never did work, that never went out to work, that have
no heart to work, rapidly become the ?Formosas ? of our cities.
Loafers had far better remain in a country where workhouses
are in store for them, as we are too busy in Victoria to
bestow time on those institutions yet. We teach our lads
and lasses to work there. We do fear, certainly, the impor-
tation of your English quasi-civilization, and that, as you
sent us crinoline, you may export idle, luxurious habits.
But, as a rule, we honour labour there , and a man or woman
is not ashamed of being caught at work.
It is not necessary to make a Fortune.? But it is wise
to have the fore-horse by the head. This is getting harder
and harder to be done in Britain. Some prudent fathers,
seeing that expenses block up the prospect of future ease,
invest in assurance offices for the safety of a family. Ex-
perience shows these are not too safe here. Perhaps they
enter a building society to secure at least a free home. But
that is found a terrible pressure by many. Civilization is
still increasing the overcrowdedness, and a chance of saving
diminishes as society gets more exacting.
By emigration, in most cases, there is a better chance to
save, and that is, after all, the great secret of relief from
care. A home can be more easily procured, as means are
greater, and the aspirations of gentility do not demand so
grand an establishment. Once the rent is saved, the habit
of economy grows, anxieties decrease, and independence
strengthens. Then, if work slacken for a time, or an appoint-
ment drop out, there is a reserve at hand, and no necessity
for a sacrifice. The wheel of fortune will eventually turn, a
good revolution be presented, and substantial results follow.
Do NOT GO WITH A BELIEF THAT YOU ARE TO MAKE A
Fortune. ?Fortunes are not so common anywhere. When


men dare cholera, sunstroke, rebellion, and fevers without
end, to get a position in India, do you think the certain
fortune of the healthy and happy Australias would be long
without a grasp at it by whole continents of people 1 Be
glad to earn a good living without much care, and a com-
fortable position without much anxiety. Put the certain
fortune out of your head, and dwell upon a snug, pleasant,
independent home. Take every precaution against failure,
and go forward with resohition in your step, hope in your
eye, and a prayer on your lips. You wall float then, if you
don?t set off swimming all at once against tide.
Do not go out simply to make Money. ?The constitution
of European society makes wealth so essential to happiness,
that few think of emigration but as a means of bettering
their condition.
This is a grievous mistake. There is something even
better than cash. Health, ?springing, enjoyable, buoyant
health,?is a glorious thing! To get that by a change of
climate, a change of employment, a change of life, is worth
a sacrifice of money. Independence of feeling, a sense of
assured self-respect, ?arising from living within one?s means
in a society tolerating such old-fashioned notions, ?is worth
a sacrifice of money. Some freedom from the tyranny of
custom, a power to think and act as you please, is worth a
sacrifice of money. A. chance to redeem the past, a sphere
that breaks a bond not to be broken here, is worth a sacrifice
of money. An opportunity to save your children from your
follies, to give them a free start away from your old associa-
tions, is worth a sacrifice of money.
I looked in one day at the little homestead of a farmer in
the wilds of Australia. The man had only known commercial
affairs in Britain. The wife had been accustomed to an elegant
abode. There they were in a little wooden place, and the
lady was making up the butter. Apologising, but without
a blush of shame, she continued at the churn till the dancing
cream reposed as tranquil, sober, and delicious food. In con-
versation, both admitted their labour, acknowledged some loss
of refinements, but smiled gratefully on their change of life.
If not so rich, they were more healthy ; if with fewer friends,
they had real ones ; if deprived of parties, they had each other?s


dearer company. They had sympathies in common. They
watched the growth of grain and fruit, they ate with appetite,
they sung their old songs together; and, in their simple life,
creation became more charming, and their God more near.
There is something better to be found in Australia than
even money.
?Oh ! hut that terrible long voyage ,? you exclaim. Well,
as I have tried it, and you have not, let us talk about
it. When I first went out I was 120 days going. We were
ill-found, and had many discomforts. Now, a voyage is rarely
above 80 days, and often less. A sailing vessel has done it
in 60. Steamers could run it in 42 days, and will do it
soon, as our Colonial rulers talk of having such a line round
by the Cape. Now, the vessels are well found : the water is
sweet, the food is wholesome, the ration is varied, the accom-
modations are clean, the discipline is maintained.
There are many pleasures on shipboard. Few complain
compared to those who approve of the life. The sea-sickness
on a sailing vessel seldom lasts over a day or two. I have
suffered more crossing the British Channel in a steamer than
sailing round the world in a good ship. Tribute being paid
to Neptune, a jolly time maybe expected. Folks who stand
upon their dignity will be tried sadly. Those of a repining
nature will never want for subjects to grumble over. The
men of geniality will be happy. The women who are un-
selfish will be happy. The appetite is generally so good that
rather coarse diet disappears with a relish. In spite of dull
uniformity of events, there is always something to laugh at.
The ever-varying sea and sky, the novelties of animate
creation, the occasional glance at land, the gorgeous sunsets,
the splendid climate, and even a storm in a safe ship, have
charms for the voyager.
If you will, you may add suitable amusements. Choral
songs, instrumental concerts, wordy debates, popular lectures,
public readings, scenic performances, can while away the time.
A good stock of books, which need not all be novels, may be
interchanged. Neglected studies could be brushed up. The
children might receive attention. Weary, work-worn wives
may read and laugh in these weeks of leisure.
Health is in almost all cases wonderfully improved, and


would be even more so if exercise were systematically taken.
The colour improves, the appetite freshens, the laugh is freer,
the fat appears. It is almost shocking to observe how people
do improve in weight on the voyage. The ladies usually declare
that some trick has been played them in the scale, for they
are confident they could not be so stout.
The restraint of a practice of growling, the prevention of
a spirit of slander, the check to a growth of sloth, the pro-
motion of good offices, the wise use of time, the watch over
pipe and glass, are all essential to the true enjoyment of a
voyage. The spleen of one disagreeable passenger can be
counteracted by the benevolence of another. A peacemaker
is worthy of all honour on shipboard. He who seeks the
welfare of his mates adds to his own inward satisfaction; he
who cultivates his mind has less time to listen to his passions ;
he who prepares himself, by suitable exercise, proper reading,
judicious inquiry, and thoughtful reflection, for his colonial
home, will be the happiest emigrant on board, and the best
settler on shore.
Remember that the voyage to Australia is admitted by
mariners to be the safest, the easiest, the pleasantest a man
can take. It is usually fair weather, and a charming climate
all the way. If long, it is a long rest; and extra expenses
are not running on.
� How am Ito get out there V ? is asked. A very proper
question. Pay your passage, ?if you can. Pray do not
squander your money in a chief cabin, if the second one, or
something cheaper still, will suit your health and means.
Some persons persist in a belief that Mrs. Grundy lives on
shipboard. If so, as they have suffered from her ashore, I
do trust they will laugh at her power on the sea. Boors in
the cabin are boors still, and I have known both ladies and
gentlemen preserve their best qualities in more confined
quarters, As to food, take a few supplies with you of pre-
served meats, and cheese, some jam, &0., rather than waste
your limited supply of cash for berths.
? But I cannot pay the passage,? you exclaim. In that
case try and get it, of course. Borrow the cash, with the
intention of paying, and keep your promise. Friends cannot
do you a better service, should you deserve help; if not, I


hope they won?t give it, for you are not the party wanted
out there. I have just heard of an organization getting afloat
to help the poor man out to the colonies, and receive back
the loan by instalments over a course of years.
? Will the Government pay it?? you inquire. I reply,
that, although the Colonial Authorities have not yet extended
their policy of Free Passages, as they are expected very soon
to do, they willingly pay for single female servants, from
eighteen to thirty-five years, of good character. The market
* will not be overstocked with such persons until the colonists
catch the English slow fever of postponing marriages for an
indefinite time. A few married couples may even now be
helped out to Melbourne. An application for a form can be
made to the Agent-General of Victoria, in Victoria Street,
Westminster ; though, as I have said, only a verv limited
number of working couples can be now sent out. "if under
forty years, the husband will have to pay 51. and wife 21.; if
over forty years, 81. and 51. respectively. They must not
have more than two children under twelve, and for whom
they would have to pay 21. for a boy, and 11. for the girl.
Girls are at a premium in Victoria. Be not too anxious if
you land with little cash. The Melbourne Government will
provide you with a home, if necessary, and help your in-
quiries after employment.
I cannot see what the English legislators are about to
waste so much breath and money about things not affecting
the masses of the country, and quite ignore matters, like
emigration, essential to the vitality of the nation. The
English Government should, at least, help the colonists to
pay the passage, as both ends get an advantage. Despots
might wish to keep their men as ?food for powder; ? but a
Christian community must, and will soon, help the poor to
better quarters.
Then go, if you intend going, with a good heart about the
undertaking. Be neither afraid nor ashamed of asking God?s
blessing upon it. Go with a sense of His smile upon you,
and clouds of difficulties will dissolve as you advance. Go
with a feeling of duty, and success in its true sense is yours.
Go with a resolution to bless the colony, and your children
shall be blessed.
