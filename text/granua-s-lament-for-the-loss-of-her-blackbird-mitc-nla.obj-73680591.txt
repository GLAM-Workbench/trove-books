THE IRISH PATRIOT.
, ' ? ( C�me all you Irishmen both great and small,
And pay attention unto my call-
My Blackbird?s banished to a Foreign isle
And left Erin?s Sons for to weep behind!
> Twas from Newry town that my Blackbird came,
/ And in Dublin City he did ramain?
For seditious writings you all may sed*
They?ve sent iny Blackbird across the sea !
John Mitchei brave is iiiy Blackbird's name, * j
' ' v He?s a valiant Son of Old Granuale
. ?'% ErirPS Sons and Daughters may now' deplore.
As my Blackbirds banish'd from his native shore.
In Green-street Court blouse where he was tried,

His Idyal comrades stood by his side,
Brave Reill, Meagher, and Brother too,
At the Felon?s Dock they bid him adieu.
But when Baron Fefroy his sentence passed,
My loyal Blackbird held his colours fast,
He looked all round and he gave a smile?
By Law I?m transported from my native soil I

To his wife and children he bid adieu,
From his loyal comrades he parted too,
Saying Lrn forced to go to a foreign clime,
Bound down in chains for a fdlons crime.

Its then the guards they did him surround,
And en the Quays there a vessel found,
To bear my blackbird across the wave,
Te lite in chains there, and be a slave.

In forty-seven we may deplore,
OConaell died on a foreign shore.
But in forty-eight Mitfchell bore away,
In a fellons chains from his eountry.
He's gone, he's gone* o'er the raging
2 Whilst Injured Erin his loss bewail.
All for his Cou try he fought manfully,
His wife may w ail and his family.
May we seethe day when he w ill be free
To burst the chains of his liberty,
| �< For fourteen years he is in exile,'
But wehope to see him in Erins Isle.

May we seethe day when he will be free,
To burst the chains of his liberty.
For fourteen years he is in exile,
But wehope to see him in Erins Isle.
i r: Kow I call on Irishmen of every creed,
To see how this makes poor Erin bleed,
So 1 now conclude hoping well soon see the day
|i When we'll triumph over base tyranny.
