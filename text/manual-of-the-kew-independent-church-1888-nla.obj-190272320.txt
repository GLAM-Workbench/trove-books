HISTORY OF THE CHURCH.
(BY MR. T. JUDD, ONE OF THE FOUNDERS.)
A short history of the Kew Independent Church may be
interesting. j
Kew was not a government township, but was the private
property of the late N. A. Fenwick, Esq., who sold it in
allotments in 1853 and 1854. Mr. J. J. French, sen., and
Mr. J. Day, being investors, applied to Mr. Fenwick on
behalf of the Independent Church, and obtained as a gift the
ground on which the church is built. Efforts were soon
made to raise funds to erect a building, which cost in the
first effort £490, of which £2OO was subscribed by the Vic-
toria Congregational Society. The church was opened for
public worship 16th April, 1854, the late Rev. A. Morrison
preaching in the morning, and the Rev. E. Day in the after-
noon.
Messrs. French, Judd, and Shaw were appointed a Com-
mittee of Management, Mr. French as secretary, and Mr.
Judd as treasurer, and arrangements were made with different
ministers and friends to conduct the Sunday services, of
whom Mr. G. Bell, sen., now of Dunedin, and the late Mr.
Allen, of the Collingwood gas works, were chiefly depended
upon.
On 9th January, 1856, a meeting was held to consider the
desirability of constituting a Church, and on Thursday, 21st
February, the Lord’s Supper was celebrated for the first
time, and presided over by the late Revs. J. L. Poore, R.
Fletcher, and T. Odell, to eight‘persons, only two of whom,
Mr. J. J. French, sen., and Mr. T. Judd, remain in Church
communion at the present time.
A Sunday-school was formed by Mr. French and Mr. Day
and family, and at a meeting on 12th November, 1856, Mr.
Judd was appointed superintendent; the number of children
enrolled being about 50.
A bell was presented to the committee by Mr. Mitchell,
of the firm of Mitchell and Bonneau, which was suspended


in a gum tree in the church gi’ound, and did duty for the
neighbourhood for some years every Sunday.
In January, 1857, the Rev. R. Connebee was appointed
the first pastor. The second half of the old church was now
erected at a cost of £330.
A Scientific and Literary Society having been formed at
Kew, its weekly meetings were held in the church, there
being no other suitable building available. The Rev, R.
Connebee was elected president. This Society was a great
source of social and mental intercourse and profit, as in those
days Kew was considered a long distance from Melbourne,
having defective roads and uncertain conveyances, so that
local attractions had the preference.
In 1860, the main portion of the present church was built,
costing £l,lOO.
In 1863 the Rev. R. Connebee was invited by the Congre-
gational Church at Dunedin to become its pastor, which
invitation he accepted, and in September the Rev, J. D,
Davies, who had just arrived from England, was appointed
his successor, but in January, 1866, he was compelled,
through ill health, to return to his native land, where he soon
afterwards died. After Mr. Davies’ departure, the pulpit
was occupied for about 12 months by Rev. A. R. Philps ; and
then Mr. Connebee returned from New Zealand, again
accepted an invitation, in December, 1868, to become pastor
of the Kew Church, and continued in that position until
the date of his death, 16th October, 1883. Mr. and Mrs.
Connebee were greatly beloved by the Church and congrega-
tion, and were held in the highest respect by every section
of the community. His pastorate over the Church extended
over a period of twenty-one years. Some months after Mr.
Connebee’s decease, our present pastor, the Rev. G. G.
Howden, of Burwood, Sydney, was invited to fill the vacant
pulpit, which invitation he accepted Ist August, 1884.


THE MINISTER’S ADDRESS.
My dear Friends, — As it has been decided to publish a
Year-Book for our church, I gladly address you a few words
of love and greeting.
We are united in a great and holy work. We have
entrusted to our care the welfare of a section of the Church
of the Living God. Let us enter on this new year solemnly
reviewing our position as co-workers with God, and seeking,
individually and collectively, to carry out His purposes, both
in respect to ourselves as believers and to those living in
unbelief.
We cannot review the past year without feelings of devout
gratitude. There is, alas ! abundant occasion for sorrow at
our shortcomings ; but, despite all, the Lord has fulfilled His
promise in meeting with the twos or threes gathered in His
name. We have had many tokens of His presence, and we
trust we enter on the new year resolved more than ever to
love Him and to strive to do His will.
Personally, next to thanking God, I cordially thank you
all for the great kindness which you have always manifested
both to myself and to those dear to me. Next to the blessing
of his Master, nothing cheers and supports a minister like
the prayerful sympathy of his people. It is so much easier
to speak and work for Christ when one is met by looks and
words indicating true love for Him, and for all who truly
work for Him.
You have been pleased to grant me a long leave of absence
for the coming year. Considering how short a time I have
been with you, I have been forcibly struck with the kindness
and readiness with which my proposal to visit England has
been received. I pray God that, during my absence, you
may be abundantly nurtured in spiritual things by those who
shall occupy my place, and that much prosperity may rest on
all the institutions of the church.
But whether present or absent, I do affectionately urge you
to cultivate a deep sense of your own responsibility in all that
tends to the spiritual prosperity of the church. Let the pew
ever be a co-worker with the pulpit. Let us work together
in our searchings after truth. If ministers only knew more
of the doubts and perplexities passing through the minds of
their hearers, how often would the message given be more
direct and be felt to meet an actual want ? Let us feel our
responsibility more in respect to the psalmody. This should
be no more left to the choir than inquiry after truth be left
to the pulpit. If you can sing, join heartily in God’s praise,
and seek to cultivate good congregational singing. And let


those of us- who are advancing in years feel more our respon-
sibility in respect to the young. N ever was the adversary of
souls so active, as now, in leading young men and young
women into paths of unbelief and sin. May we strive by all
the means lying in our power to prevent any from wandering,
and to reclaim those who have wandered.
It is needless for me to report here on the various organiza-
tions of the church ; but I cannot close this address without
gratefully recognizing the harmony and efficiency which
pervade amongst all the workers. In the diaconate mutual
respect and confidence abound at all the meetings ; the
members of the Ladies’ Committee are ever ready to respond
to any appeal for aid ; the Sunday-school teachers, the mem-
bers of the choir, the seat wardens, and all other workers
continue their labours with cheerfulness and ability.
Nor would I close without a grateful recognition of the
liberality of the congregation during the past year. Else-
where acknowledgment will be given of amounts received ;
but I cannot refrain from noticing that, not only have many
and urgent appeals been made during the year, but these
have been always responded to with readiness and liberality.
The hand of death has been upon us in the past year;
Some by accident, and some by lingering sickness, have been
removed from our midst. We tenderly sympathize with the
bereaved, but we sorrow not as those without hope. Our
friends, we are assured, though absent from the body, are
present with the Lord. Who of us may be taken during
the year 1889 ! May we all be found so watching, working,
and trusting, that, whether we live or die, we may know we
are “ the Lord’s.”
Your affectionate friend and minister,
G. G. HOWDEN.


THE DEACONS’ LETTER.
Dear Christian Friends, — We have decided this year to
bring under your notice the whole of our church work in the
issue of a “ Church Manual.” We have taken this course in
the belief that it will ensure greater interest in the various
spheres of Christian activity in connection with our church.
If we find that the Manual is appreciated, we hope to be
able to have an annual issue.
FINANCES.
We are very thankful that, through the goodness of God
and your liberality, our finances are in a satisfactory state,
and we have been able to meet the ordinary expenditure of the
church during the year, and have a balance of £27 4s. lOd.
to carry forward to next year’s account. The past year
was our year of Jubilee, and we desire to mark our sense of
the generosity displayed in connection with the numerous
appeals for monetary assistance during the year. We trust
that many have found that it is more blessed to give than to
receive. For some years past this colony has enjoyed
exceptional prosperity, and it is right that we should
recognize our responsibilities in the sight of God for His
bountiful gifts.
We believe that a spirit of liberality has been manifested,
and that the Christian grace of giving has been cultivated.
We trust that as a church our power to do good will
increase, and that home and foreign missions, the circulation
of the Word of God, the support of the various institutions
for the sick and the distressed, will receive greater assistance
from us as our ability to give is increased by Him who is the
giver of all good. There is a growing tendency in this com-
munity to luxurious living. It would be a sorry thing if the
Church of the living Christ should be ensnared by this sin of
selfish indulgence. Let us rather cultivate the spirit of Him
who for our sakes became poor, that we through His poverty
might become rich.
SUNDAY-SCHOOL.
We are thankful to record here our deep sense of the good-
ness of God in enabling us during the past year to rejoice
in the removal of all debt from our Sunday-school. We
entered into the scheme for its erection with much trepi-
dation in regard to raising the necessary funds, but friends
came forward from unexpected quarters to our assistance ;
everybody upon whom we had any claim had a mind to work
for the children, and so God has crowned our efforts with
greater success than we anticipated.


JUBILEE DECORATION'S.
The beautiful decorations which have adorned our church
for some months past have been greatly admired by all who
have seen them, and we are very glad of this opportunity of
expressing our appreciation of the skilful manner in which
Mr. Francis Barlow and Mr. Harry Chandler, with the assist-
ance of many kind friends, carried out the work entrusted
to them by the Church.
ORGAN CHAMBER.
For some time past we have had under consideration the
subject of additional sitting accommodation, as we have had
some difficulty in satisfying requirements. The choir, we
find, is also cramped for want of room. We hope to
submit ere long a scheme for an organ chamber and
choir accommodation, which will release the room at present
occupied by the organ and choir. We know that we
shall not appeal in vain for assistance in this matter when
our plans are matured and we have a definite scheme to lay
before you.
VERGER,
Our respected deacon, Mr. Jas. Hay, who was one of the
founders of the church, and who has for very many years
acted in the capacity of verger, has, in consequence of
advanced years, tendered his resignation, which was accepted
by the Deacons, who, having advertised for someone to fill
the vacancy, have appointed Mr. Henry Badger.
We desire here to express the hope that, although Mr. Day
has laid down this office, he will still remain among us, to
witness the growth and assist in the development of this
Church of God, which must be very dear to his heart, as one
of its founders.
CONCLUSION.
We would earnestly invite you to peruse the contents of
this little Manual, in order that you may be thereby
acquainted with the work of the church ; and if not actively
employed at present in any of the various agencies of the
church, you may find your sphere of work by suggesting to
the Deacons how your talents may be employed.
Let us work while it is called to-day, “ for the night
cometh, wherein no man can work.”

Teachers’ Business Meeting—Wednesday after the second
Sunday in each month, after evening service, from 8.30 to

Library. —ln connection with our School we have a Library
containing nearly 400 volumes, which is available for the use
of the scholars by a subscription of Id. per month, and
which, we are glad to say, is well used by the scholars. We
replenish the Library with new and suitable books two or
three times a year, as the funds of the School will admit.
During the year we have purchased a piano (by Kaps),
which is a great assistance to the musical portion of our
service.
We have an average attendance of 76 scholars in the
morning, and 140 in the afternoon, and we are pleased to
say that our school is increasing, not only in numbers, but
also, we trust, in usefulness. We cannot chronicle many
additions to the church from the school during the past year,
only one scholar having joined it, but during the year ended
31st June, 1887, seventeen scholars had joined the church,
from which it will be seen that the average for the two years
is satisfactory.
Our school is not by any means idle in the matter of
missionary collections, having collected on behalf of the


London Missionary Society, for the 12 months from Ist
January to 31st December, 1888, £4l 18s. 2d. ; also, for the
Zenana Mission, £2 4s. 9d, ; besides which a collection was
taken up on behalf of the hospitals, on Hospital Sunday,
amounting to £2 35., making a total of £46 ss. lid.
We would draw special attention to three classes in the
school, to which the young men and young women of the dis-
trict are invited, viz.—the Young Women’s Class (conducted
in the morning by Mrs. Griffiths, and in the afternoon by
Mr. Gladstone) ; also, the Students’ Class, under Mr. Geo.
Bell (afternoon class). Both these classes have separate class-
rooms ; we should like to see them full, and hope this
notice will help to augment their numbers. We are also
forming a class for intending competitors for the Scholars’
S.S. Union Examination, to be held this year, on the Gospel
according to St. Mark.
Our Anniversary Services, held on Sunday, 17th April,
were well attended and successful, the Rev. J. H. Toms
occupying the pulpit in the morning, the Rev. G. G.
Howden in the evening. On the Tuesday following a tea and
public meeting was held, at which the Hon. J. Balfour pre-
sided.
Our Annual Treat was held on 9th November, in the
Asylum reserve, when a beautiful day helped us all to enjoy
it thoroughly. We would take this opportunity of thanking
all who so liberally responded to our appeal for contributions
towards defraying the expenses of the treat.
We append our Balance-sheet, from which it will be seen
that our finances are in a satisfactory condition, as we are
able to carry forward to 1889 £l5 9s. Bd. But our school
is growing, and we shall need to spend more in requisites
and upon our library, &c., so that we shall need all our funds.
We feel thankful to God that through His blessing we are
enabled to write such an encouraging report; but there is
much to be done, and it is only by patient perseverance in
well doing, accompanied with our Father’s blessing, that we
can go on successfully in our work.
We would thank all our teachers and officers for their
untiring labours and self-sacrificing efforts in the school, and
pray that they may all be able to see that their work is not
in vain, but that both teachers and scholars are growing in
grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus
Christ.

BIBLE CLASS.
This class has been conducted by the minister, and has met
alternately with the Mutual Improvement Society, on Thurs-
day evenings, and, as a rule, has been well attended. The
principal topic of last year’s study has been the “ Life of St.
Paul,” and the members of the class have apparently taken
great interest in the lessons.
MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT SOCIETY.
This Society has met fortnightly, consisting of the members
of the Bible Class and several young men in addition. The
officers for the year were : —President —Rev. G. G. Howden ;
Vice-Presidents—Mr. G. Bell and Mr. T.W. Harris; Committee
—Messrs. E. Greenhill, C. Luke, and T. Howden, and Misses
S. Bailey, F. Luke, and M. Howden; Hon. Secretary and
Treasurer—Mr. W. H. Chandler. The programme of the
year has included debates on questions of interest, essays,
and speeches, an hour with the poets, and impromptu
speeches. Under the auspices of the Society the following
public lectures were given : —On “ Earl of Shaftesbury,” by
the President; “ India,” by Rev. W. S. Rolland ; “Charles
Kingsley,” by Mr. Harris; and “Across Siberia,” by the
Hon. James Campbell.
ladies’ working society.
The ladies of this Society have met fortnightly and worked
for various charitable objects. Mrs. French is the President.
Aid has been rendered during the year to the City Missions,
the Elizabeth Fry Retreat, the Maternity Hospital, the
Cherbury'Home of Hope, and the Maloga Mission.
FEMALE MISSION AUXILIARY.
Mrs. Howden is President, and, with a band of young lady
collectors, money is raised by soliciting small sums quarterly


from ladies, to aid especially in the support of Zenana mis-
sions. Each year the amount collected is about £3O. In addi-
tion to this, the Sunday-school has given this year a collection
of £2 4s. 9d. Several young friends—very young friends—
have, too, of their own free will, started a small bazaar
amongst themselves, and have raised during the year £5 9s.
4d. to pay the expenses of a cot in an hospital in India. Three
friends have also generously contributed £4 each for the year
to maintain a Bible woman in connection with Miss Lindley’s
Mission in India. A parcel of the value of £lO, with a gift of
a few pounds for freight, has, by the efforts of Mrs. Kellett
and a few lady workers, been sent to Miss Bliss, Madagascar ;
a letter gratefully acknowledging the receipt of both parcel
and money having been just received.
CHOIR,
Mr. Geo. Bell, Organist.
Soprani—Misses Denbigh, Michell, E. M‘Ewing, A.
M‘Ewing, L. Clutterbuck, I. Clutterbuck, Kay, and S.
Bailey.
Contralti—Misses Carter, H. Bailey, and Greenhill.
Tenori —Messrs. H. Chandler, Kay, R. Howden, and E.
Gladstone.
Bassi—Messrs. J. H. French, T. Greenhill, A. Figgis,
C. Viney, H. Carter.
The choir meets for practice every Friday evening.
It would be desirable to strengthen the choir, but the
limited space at disposal prevents the services of several
friends being availed of which would be gladly rendered did
circumstances permit. It is hoped that the proposed removal
of the organ and choir-seats to the south transept will afford the
needed accommodation As soon as this is done, and those
who now give only occasional help become fully identified
with the regular choir, it is proposed to extend their
study beyond the limited range of congregational music, so
that the wider culture thus acquired may react upon the
service of song, to its great improvement. Already steps
have been taken in this direction by the accumulation of a
small fund, to be devoted to the purchase of music, and
several anthems of acknowledged merit form the nucleus of
what is intended to become a valuable and extensive library.
By the generosity of Mr. John Griffiths, funds are available
for a further purchase, and a selection is now being made of
pieces to be ordered.
SERMON TO THE YOUNG.
A sermon to the young is preached on the morning of the
second Sunday in each month.


BAPTISMS, MARRIAGES, &C.
These are generally arranged for privately with the
minister, but if there is a wish to have the baptism in the
church, it is suggested that it is very appropriate to have the
service following that in which the children’s sermon is
preached.
JOINING THE CHURCH.
The minister will be glad to receive applications by letter,
or private visits, at any time, from those wishing to join the
church ; but he is generally in the vestry for this purpose
on the Monday evening preceding the monthly church
meeting. Conditions of membership—Faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ, union with Him by the indwelling of the Holy
Spirit, and determination by His help to lead a life of holiness
and usefulness.
CHURCH MEETINGS.
These are held on the Wednesday evening at the close of
the service preceding the first Sunday in each month. Can-
didates for fellowship are proposed at one meeting, when
visitors are appointed to confer with them ; and, if the report
is satisfactory, they are received at the next church meeting.
DEACONS, AND THE LADIES* COMMITTEE.
There are eight deacons and six members of the Ladies’
Committee. Half this number retire at the close of each
year, but are elegible for re-election.
“VICTORIAN INDEPENDENT.”
This paper has been recently enlarged, and is now most
efficiently edited and published. It should be in the family
of all who prize our denominational principles. Owing to
increased expense in publishing, the Committee of Manage-
ment urgently solicit increase in number of subscribers.
