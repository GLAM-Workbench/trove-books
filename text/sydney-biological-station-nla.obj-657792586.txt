SYDNEY BIOLOGICAL STATION.
The number of Biological Stations throughout the world is increasing yearly. Those that have been
established are of two classes, —(1) Stations founded in connection with universities to afford facilities for
practical study to students; (2) Stations whose aim is to afford aid to the trained scientific worker in the
carrying out of his investigations. To the latter class, by far the most important, as aiming at the acquisi-
tion of new scientific data, and not merely at the training of students, the lately established Sydney
Biological Station belongs. Such a station, when fully equipped, should stand in the same relative position
to the biologist as the observatory does to the astronomer, or the chemical laboratory to the chemist; it
should be a laboratory fitted up with all the apparatus and appliances necessary for the carrying on of
biological work, together with, when practicable, a library of biological literature.
The idea of Biological Station in Sydney was started by Baron Maclay in 1879, influenced
by a conviction of the desirability of having such an institution formed in Australia, in order to afford
assistance to biologists in working out some of the unsolved problems presented by the Australian fauna
and flora with its many archaic and aberrant forms. The scheme was taken up by the Linnean Society of
New South Wales, and the Government granted the piece of land at Watson’s Bay on which the station now
stands, and placed the sum of £300 on the Estimates for 1880-81, to be applied to the building of the
station, provided that an equal amount should be raised by subscription. Considerable difficulty was
experienced in raising the required sum, but at length, after considerable delay, thanks to the untiring
energy and perseverance of Baron Maclay, the amount was completed, and the building has now been
erected and partially furnished.

Ground Plan.
It consists of a six-roomed cottage erected on the jutting point of land between Watson’s Bay and
Camp Cove. The building is of wood on a stone foundation with an iron roof. In the stone basement
part of the space has been walled in, and when more funds are available other portions will be partitioned
off as rooms for the carrying on of rough dissections and other operations which cannot well be carried on
in the rooms above, and for the storage of bottles, spirits of wine, chemicals, dredges, nets, and other
collecting gear. The rooms above are six in number, in three suites of two rooms each, so that biologists
wishing to live close to their work may use one room as a bed-room, and the other as a laboratory. The
laboratories are 15 feet x 12, with a lofty ceiling; the windows are large, with an easterly aspect, and large
skylights permit of the entry of a certain amount of additional light from above. The partitions between
the rooms are double—the interspace being filled with sawdust to deaden noises. A verandah 6 feet in
breadth runs round the whole building. As yet the land is unenclosed, but arrangements have been made-
for the erection of a suitable fence.
It will be seen from the above brief account that considerable additions require to be made to the
appliances of the institution before it can be regarded as efficiently equipped for the purposes for which it
is intended. Aquaria and other appliances are still wanting ; and it is very desirable that a house should
be erected for the accommodation of a paid care-taker, who should attend to the aquaria, dredge for speci-
mens, and in other ways assist the biologists working in the station.
The Royal Society of New South Wales has granted the Biological Station the sum of £25 from its
funds, and it is expected that this grant will be repeated from year to year. The Royal Society of Victoria
have also promised an annual sum, and the Australian Biological Association will also probably be in a
position to grant an annual sum to the Sydney Station. Further subscriptions, however, are still required,
and will be thankfully received by the Treasurer, or any of the Trustees.
The station is open to biologists of the male sex, irrespective of nationality, on payment of a small
weekly sum to meet the expenses of service, &c. Any Society subscribing £25 annually is entitled to send
a representative to work at the station free from this weekly charge, and to the members of the Australian
Biological Association it will be reduced in amount.
