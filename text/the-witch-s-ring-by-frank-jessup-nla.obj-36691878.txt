[Jo wn near the river where the big gumtree spread its branches
■■over the water, Molly and Buddy met Flipflop the Frog. He was
a large, spotty kind of frog who lived by himself . . . and it was

rOj Hen Molly pointed out that the boat was much too tiny to carry

r»|ut when Molly put her face near it. .. the ring seemed to grow
bigger and bigger, so that she crawled through it quite easily. Buddy
followed her ... and then they discovered it was not really that the ring
had grown larger ... but that they had become smaller.

about on the big waves of the ocean. But... a great storm arose

nd then a giant wave .. . larger than all the rest., . roared down
upon them . •. and the boat filled with water and began to sink.
Flipflop made little croaking noises ... and rubbed the Witch’s Ring.
