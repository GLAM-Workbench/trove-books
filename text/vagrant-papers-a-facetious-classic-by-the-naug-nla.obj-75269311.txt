TO THE GENTLE READER.
I make no apology for this pamphlet. It has not been ? written out
of the abundance of leisure, but from my love of you.? The first
attraction in it sufficiently explains itself, and needs no comment.
The second, ? St. Sandy, &c.,? is a puzzle to me myself, now it is
written; I can?t make it out a bit; and if I can?t, I guess you will
find it something difficult. It don?t mean anything, and may be
regarded as a vision of the night?? a baseless fabric of a vision,? as
Will?m has it. The ? Squelchers ? are a series of paragraphs relating
to the myths that reside on ?Tom Tidler?s Ground,? and nowhere
else. Throughout the whole of this pamphlet, it will be observed
that I have studiously avoided being truthful. I once got into a row
for telling too much truth, and now I am ambitious to prove myself
a ?living lyre.? So it will be seen that it is about nothing, means
nothing, and is sold for ?hold on ! ? sixpence.? Reader, now you
know as much about the thing as I do, or anyone else. I always
write my preface last. This finishes my book. Boy, put out the
gas !


THREE STRAY SQUELCHERS.
Walton still feels sore about the forty pounds he got messed out of at
the People?s. Ah, Walton dear, I told you Reynolds was a ??nut,? and,
you bet, I was right.
Why does not the Licensed Victuallers? Association take action
against some of the sly grog shops, and compel the police to put a stop
to a practice, wide-spread and increasing, of retailing fermented and
spirituous liquors in unlicensed houses. At Madame?s, in Lonsdale
street, they retail beer at five bob a bottle, which they produce from a
cupboard in the snug little back parlor ; and champagne too is retailed.
The moderate tax of five shillings for second-rate ? swipes ? is in itself a
novelty, startling, and only calculated to favourably impress ?bush
horses ? ; some fellers get the stuff for nothing, and it is safer to give it
away than to sell it, though it is even dear sometimes at nothing a
bottle.
Someone sent a celebrated colonial judge a work of art some time ago ;
it represented a young woman, who seemed to be waiting for her washing
to come home, and his honor naturally felt that, if there was a lot of art
in the thing, there was also a lot of objectionable qualities. He rounded
up some domestics, and said to them, ? I guess you?d best cover this gal
up a bit, like ; for, blame me, I can stand art going a good way, but still
this here thundering gusher is a bit too natural, it is.? Then they
ragged up the gal, and he left. But what was to be done with the im-
moral ?cus? of a thing? Well now, the judge is a bit charitable.
Anway, when he has anything he is certain sure he don?t want for him-
self, he is just like to give it away , so he packed up the gal, and sent it
to a Church of England bazaar for the young ladies to raffle off in a
benevolent sort of way. Lor! you should just have seen the boys
payin? down for a throw for that poor shivering art-treasure; some of
them was just nigh mad over it, but the young ladies secured their coin,
smiled with their best trimmed smiles, and sent a lucky young sinner off
with that blooming concern, and all for the love .of charity. I like a
man who can be liberal with what he don?t want. I do; and if anyone
just tries to palm off on me any naked image or picture, break me up,
now, if I don t start it as a gift to the Lord at a church bazaar, or some
stir-me-up revival meeting club, I will.


Jrtljistrrits of Prison WtU
A heartrending account of a month's incarceration
in Victorian dungeons, with some startling reve-
lations touching gaol discipline, and enter-
taining and amusing sketches of the
more remarkable prisoners now
under sentence.
A PATHETIC POENAL PASTORAL
TO THE
GUSHING VICTORIANS,
CHAPTER I.
Struck dumb ?The lock-up?Narrow escape?The beneovolent lawyer ?
Deserted by all: no Peter followed ?afar off ? even?Arrival at
Melbourne Gaol ?The Scotch warder?My personal attractions?First
brush with the enemy?The red-hot warders ? Where?s the Governor ?
My apartments ?Gorgeous furnishings?The wrathful warders ?
Where's the doctor ? Musicalperformances ? lnterruptions Worn-out ?
Repose?Virtuous indignation of pure-minded newspaper reportas.
My hair is white, but not with years ;
Nor grew it white
In a single night,
As men?s have done from sudden fears :
But mine has been a dungeon?s spoil.
Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor iron bars a cage.
Like a man who had received a paralytic stroke, I realised that
theinajesty of the law had dropped right on to me. At the time, a
fine inspiration of prudence, for which I am sublimely thankful,
caused me to hold in a heavy charge of red-hot profanity which was
rising within me; and I pride myself I made .as graceful and digni-
fied a retreat towards the adjacent lock-up as, under the circum-
stances, could be expected.
Having been stripped of the balance of my battered fortune (two
shillings, I think) and a few melancholy ornaments, with which I


usually relieve the heavy dullness of my personal appearance, the
limb of the law, to whose tender mercies I had been consigned,,
placed me in an airy room with a chilling atmosphere. The door
closing upon me, I was left in company with ray own reflections,
which, always, more or less, weird and fanciful, on this occasion
assumed such a hot character that I felt myself boiling clean over,
and like to scald anyone who might come around my way.
While ruminating on the freaks of fantastic fortune, and trying to
realise the state of ecstatic joy into which my enemies would be
suddenly hurled on the news of my being hors de combat reaching
them, I was aroused by a face, child-like and bland, appearing at
the port-hole in my cell-door. I turned like a caged jaguar upon it,
and glared savagely for a moment, until I recognized that it belonged
to the benevolent and self-sacrificing Mr. , solicitor, &c. (no
relative of the primitive Cain?s).
?This is really too bad,? he remarked, gazing on me with that
sweet innocent smile peculiar to such benign features. ?Yes/? he
added, ? really too bad altogether ! What are you going to do ??
An inordinate longing to embrace this good Samaritan, who
seemed longing to pour oil into my mental wounds, seized me; I
was like hugging him right away, but the door intervening, I mildly
chirped out that?? As far as my limited vision assisted me, I could
positively see nothing to do.?
? Pooh ! Pooh !? he spluttered out, in that way to which Police
Court counsel are addicted, ? you must appeal at once ; yes, imme-
diately ; we won?t have this.?
u Hope springs eternal in the human breast ? ?as the poet hath
it, and I nearly swallowed myself with consuming joy at the delight-
ful picture so suddenly conjured up. ? I wish you had been in
Court, Mr. Solicitor, &c., when it happened,?? I remarked affection-
ately, as I desired to ingratiate myself with him, and I knew that he
would feel flattered at any one regretting the loss of his company ;
�I do so wish you had been there,? and I gave him one of my most
gaudily embroidered smiles.
� Ah,? he replied, ? us lawyers never attend court, unless we get a
fee in advance.? Having indulged in this softening burst of conse-
quential oratory, he swelled out like a toad. The peculiarity of his
grammar appealed to my risible faculties, but I grew more thought-
ful and less boisterous as he continued ?? But you give me a couple
of sovereigns, and I?ll get you out in no time.?
I had often wondered how some lawyers got their living, and here
suddenly was food for reflection on that dark subject. However,
with that youthful simplicity that ever characterizes my actions, I pro-
ceeded to give him a written ord'er on a right good friend. How charm-
ingly simple was this action ! On looking back, I view it with feel-
ings of gratification, since it evidences that the verdant qualities of
innocent childhood still linger in my world-worn bosom. Just fancy


my supposing that a man, who had claimed relationship with me
when my star was at its zenith, would, when fortune played me false,
advance me a couple of pounds, even though I had lent him my
dress coat! What a gentle-hearted suckling I must be! and the
sequel showed how much more prudent and pure-minded my
esteemed relative was than I had given him credit for.
After a few more dew-drops of encouragement and promise had
fallen from the esteemed Mr. Solicitor, &c., that eminent legal
luminary departed, while in solitude profound I awaited the next
turn in the wheel of fortune.
Shortly afterwards the sergeant tenderly directed my thoughts
to my passage in the prisoners? van towards the distant goal.
Dwelling on this subject, my spirits rapidly w r ent straight
down into the mud, but the atmosphere of woe surrounding me
eventually took up a little. Ido not know to whom lam indebtee
for the kindness that was shown me, but, with more consideration
than usually characterizes the actions of official dignititaries, the
? Powers that be ? granted me a cab as a means of transit to my
gloomy prison, and thus I was spared the unpleasantness of being
mingled up with a crowd or Collingwood notabilities, and other
esteemed persons, of whose actions a grateful country had taken
cognizance.
But this well-meant kindness nearly took a worse than fatal
turn with me, for .after, in company with a Hibernian bluebottle,
passing a gaping crowd of newspaper reporters and-correspondents,
small boys, big lawyers, half-boozed hangers on, etc., etc., I found
the cab, on arriving in Swanston street, turning southward. Now, I
I knew the Melbourne gaol was to the northward, but judiciously
held my peace. It has been instilled into me during the course of a
very varied career, that silence in the presence of official magnates ?
of greater or lesser degree matters not ?is always a wise policy, if
you are in their power. But, in this instance, such experience did
not hold good, for it nearly led to my being lodged in a lunatic
asylum instead of a goal, as it was to the former place that my
attendant keeper had directed the cabby to take me. Here is a
sweet example of a hair-breadth escape, Gadzooks ! if I had got
into that asylum just now, when there is a tendency to inquire into,
the internal management of such places, what a literary bomh-shell
I would have been enabled to produce ! However, lam bound to
record, even though it is not flattering to my genius, and shows a
great want of the outward demonstrations of sanity on my part, that
my [ official friend, as his eyes glanced over the papers referring to
me, received a dim impression that I was for ? chokee,? and our
course was accordingly altered. We ? put about,? and as I indulged
in wild hilarity ill-befitting the occasion and the solemn aspect of
my affairs in futuro , my keeper seemed extremely doubtful as to
whether some mistake had not really been made, and darkly hinted


at a lunatic asylum being a good place for some people. I supposed
he ought to know.
Nothing of great import occured until the mournful portals of the
Melbourne gaol were reached. Here I parted with my guardian,
who transferred me to a human being of austere presence in a
uniform, apparently a cross between a policeman?s and an American
volunteer?s. This good soul conducted me into a small room, and
seating himself at a table behind an impressive-looking book, looked
up at me. Suddenly he exploded, and conveyed to me in gruff tones
that my hands were to be kept off the table. This was a severe
rebuke to the elegant attitude I had struck, but, though taken back
at the unexpected outburst of the man, I mechanically obeyed. He
then submitted me to some highly impertinent and imbecile ques-
tions, to which I replied with a heavenly humility, little in accordance
with the fiendish longings for blood that surged through my brain.
I was then scrutinised by my captor in a peculiar and greedy style,
as though he envied the many marks of favor which Nature had
stamped upon my noble face and form. He seemed lost in the con-
templation of ray personal beauty, and then noted down my varied
charms in the book aforementioned. They ran, as near as I could
make out, thuswise ; ?Medium hite. bloo hise. Curley Hare. Red
nose. Brite compleckshon. Round face. Long heres. No ?orns
in the ?ed. Too feet?nether clubbed. Delekate ?ands. Wite teath.
Hevingly smile, &c., &c.
Such is the dark, weird-like, and fanciful legend in the archives of
Victoria which rescues this individual from future obscurity, and
many poets and philosophers yet unborn will doubtless read that
mystic page in centuries to come with greedy avidity, while they
chronicle the many virtues which the defunct miracle never pos-
sessed, and blacken his tombstone with a thousand lies. ?Tis
always the case, for as soon as a mighty man has been resolved into
a corpse, his friends and enemies discover millions of startling facts
about him?virtues and crimes?and hold a well-meant fight to see
lie the most about the renowned dust. Such is the fate of
genius, unrecognised talent, and enthusiastic philanthropy ?0 tem-
J>ora / O mores / (Hem !)
Well, the ceremony referred to being ended, I was led through a
partition of iron bars into the main aisle of the ?Temple of Woe, 5 '
and left standing in sepulchral silence to view the antics of a couple
of wardsmen, also a warder, who was watching the proceedings of
two visitors, who were interviewing an inmate of the place. A
wardsman, I must explain, is a prisoner who, for good conduct,
submissive reverence to overbearing warders, and cringing servility
in the presence of the governor of the gaol, inspector-general,
chaplain, &c., has been promoted to an enviable position in the
establishment, such as?cleaner out of the slush-buckets, or waiter
to the other prisoners ; from this the enjoyment of happiness and


the less favored inmates may be gauged. A warder is very
different, and is of course a person of great consequence, bullying
both wardsmen and prisoners in a manner that clearly shows his
thorough appreciation of his own importance; in fact, he is a real
kid-glove, gold breast-pin, gaudy sort of man in a prison, and never
allows himself to forget it. Some warders are quiet enough ; they
will even go so far as to show minute particles of consideration for a
respectable prisoner, who has got unfortunately mixed up with the
scum of the earth; but, on the other hand, there are some who,
cruel by nature, petty-minded, and painfully conscious of their
inferiority and plebeianism in the presence of an educated and
enlightened prisoner, show all their envy and spite in heaping, to
the utmost of their power, indignity upon those they feel to be their
superiors, despite the relative changes of position. I early had
experience of this breed.
Finding myself standing unoccupied, the thought struck me that I
would just scribble a note to a friend, and get the warder who had
taken my description to see that it was delivered; for as I came to
the conclusion that he was ? a mon fra the north countrie,? I
deemed it likely that, beneath his rugged exterior, there would be a
little humanity. Thus it was that, drawing out my note-book, 1
asked the warder near me the name of my Scotch friend.
This was like showing a red rag to a bull; I thought I had started a
powder magazine, as he went off with a report that pauperised a
thunderclap. ?Gi? that book ?ere!? he yelled in tones that Wel-
lington might have envied. Tare and hounds ! what had I done ?
But with that submission I always gracefully accord, when I can?t
help myself, I handed him the precious note book. Naturally I
looked in amazement at him as he grabbed it from me, and
appeared anxious to scorch me with the light of his eyes. Seeing,!
suppose, that I was not impressed with his magnificence of be-
havior and social grandeur, he went off again bang ! bang ! while,
half stunned, I thought I could trace his voice struggling with the
following mysteries in grammar: ?? Ves, and I?ll take that ring of
yer, in a minute, I will! Ge? me that stick ! an? I?ll have yer close
ov yer back ?oh ! yer may look ! I?ve ?ad yer sort ?ere afore, I ?ave.
I?ll show yer who yer are ! ?
Struck dumb at this unusual burst of eloquence, I mildly mur-
mured a suggestion that I was void of offence, and allowed a holy
smile to extend the classic opening in my face.
This was another signal to my gunpowdery friend, and with an
appalling explosion he conveyed to me the idea that it would be
expedient for me to accompany him. I did so, and seeing the high
state of volcanic disturbance in his internal regions, in order to avert
an eruption, I judiciously proceeded to my doom in silence, while
my eyes protruded with astonishment to such an extent that you
could have hung your hat on them. Visions of straight-jackets,


thumb-screws, guillotines, and other humorous appendages of
dungeons, flitted ghost-like through my brain, as I moved onwards
in fear and trembling till we came to cell 21, when, flinging open the
door, my attendant compound of human combustibles thrust me in.
My natural instincts always prompt me to fossick out all about
whatever place lam in, or whatever persons I meet; therefore on
finding myself alone, and in silence so thick that you could hear it, I
submitted my new quarters to a rigorous scrutiny. The apartment
was as dark as the inside of a cow, it extended some 9 feet long by 4
broad ; at one end was a barred window of curtailed dimensions,
with the glass broken, and at the other an iron door with a closed loop-
hole in it, A board, six feet long by two broad, was standing on
end beneath the window ; as to its use I was then blissfully
ignorant; and near the door, in a corner, was a four-legged stand
about eighteen inches high containing a deep tin dish; a dipper
filled with water, standing near it, suggested the idea that it was a
wash-stand constructed according to antideluvian principles.
Following out this idea, I was urged to perform my ablutions by
way of recreation, when doubts as to the purpose of the mysterious
bit of furniture arose within me, and it was lucky that I paused, for
on submitting the tin dish to the test of my nasal organ I
discovered that it was the direct antithesis of a drinking cup.
Great Caesar?s ghost! supposing I had thoughtlessly washed myself
in it?the thought overpowers me ! I next inspected a pile of grey
blankets, rolled up in a cunning fashion, and placed near the board
before referred to, and then contemplated the slate flooring for a few
moments, ere deciding upon my course of action. Who it really is
that finds mischief for idle hands to do I cannot take upon myself
to say, but I think my innate love of music urged me to perform
upon the tin dipper an impromptu medley ; thus emptying the water
out of it, I started the overture with the sonorous dipper on the
iron door. I had hardly completed the first startling bars, which
awoke the echoes of the silent hall, when the door opened and my
blood-and thunder warder exhibited his curiosity as to what ailed
me, I hailed him with a rataplan, and then expressed my desire to
see the governor. ?Just yer drop that dipper, and hould yer noise
now, or I?ll report yer for insubordination,? he answered, and
slam went the door.
On continuing my musical programme, he returned in a fizzing
state of heat, and expressed his determination to have me reduced
into a state of pulp if I did not discontinue to raise glory hallelujah
in the place. With that bouyancy natural to my mercurial dis-
position, I still persisted in enlivening my weary solitude with the
inspiring strains of the tin dipper. Eventually I was disposessed of it;
but a great mind stops at nothing, and so availing myself of the
movable top of the evil-smelling little stand, I started vigorously on
the door with it, presently bringing a bevey of warders to the scene.


I may remark that the reason of my strenuous exertions to keep my
warders awake was that they positively refused to take word to the
hospital that I required medical attendance, one warder informing
me that ? there warn?t nothing the matter with me.? As I afterwards
received medical treatment, he was a little out, and I only mention
the matter to show that a man in a dangerous state of health may
be exposed to cold and hardship, which a healthy man would find
severe, simply because some dunder-headed warder chooses to
decide that he is in perfect health, and the unfortunate may even be
left unattended, as I was, for four-and-twenty hours.
Human nature in some ways is very frail, and as I had not
attended to my victualling department since breakfast I it
necessary to contemplate carrying out arrangements for sleeping with
a light stomach and a heavy heart. Being locked up is in itself of
course a screaming joke, but to be starved from ten in the morning
until breakfast time the following day robs the joke of part of its
primest effect. Anyhow, having had no dinner, I supped off what
was left of it, and following out the directions given as to the nature
and management of the long board in my cell, converted it into a
bed, about as comfortable and luxurious as a pump-handle, and
bringing my musical performance to a close with a flourish, placed
my boots for a pillow, upon which I fell into profound slumbers.
While I slept so peacefully a vision of the night cheered me up,
for I dreamed that some forty strange, heavy-browed, ink-slinging
demons beyond the walls of my dungeon were fairly revelling in the
exquisite delights of throwing water on a drowned rat. A great
gnome-like monster, representing Fate, stood overlooking them at
their work, and was whispering in their ears : ?? Go it, you hunky
boys; I have expended my worst furies on the man that dared to be
guilty of writing better than yourselves, so, on the dog-fighting prin-
ciple, bite him now he is down.? At this the varlets redoubled their
efforts, and with frantic energy proceeded to show an amount of
horror for all that is called impure ; which action on their part the
demon of satire, standing near, whispered was ?? at startling variance
with the actions of their own daily (and nightly) lives.? I moved in
my sleep and believe I gently murmured ?? It is so easy to assume
a great amount of virtue, at but a trifling expenditure of the irksome
practices entailed on those who would be known as pure.?
(To be continued,)


SAINT SANDY THE SUPER.,
KNOWN IN THE FLESH AS
POPE PRORIETY THE FIRST.
Sfv
Canonised ist April in the year One.-
A HUNKY PONTIFICAL POEM.
The Super, sat in the Super.?s chair;
He wore a pleased and a satisfied air;
. A smile on his brow
Alighted just now,
And it seemed that he hadn?t a single care.
He was not very young, nor yet very old ;
He was not very brave, and yet I was told
That this frisky old spark
Was fond of a lark,
And was in love?s battle remarkably bold.
How this may be, by and by you shall see, y
And, reader, we?ll have some prime fun, you and me.
(My grammar is bad,
But the rhyme must be ? had?
And so must the ?Super.,? ?P.M.,? and the ?De.?>
For the Kellys, and others of similar sort,
The Super., so bold, had never a thought ;
?Twas his business, but still
The beggars might kill,
So he cared not a d?n if they never were caught.;
He had business at home, and righteously drew
For doing this same a mighty big screw;
But you may be bound,
When at night he prowled round,
The coins that he spent were remarkably few.

It would seem that beneath her lecherous smile
He often will bask officially, while
Her champagne he sips?
_ But he never takes ? tips p
lo mention it even arouses his bile.
Madame?s husband?a trooper?away afar
Awaits his promotion, and really there are
Some reasons to show
Why he should go
To the top of the tree, like a brilliant star.
At least an Inspector this man should be.
Who?s blind to those things that he need not see;
But instead of a rise,
I think a surprise
Will yet make him murmur emphatically ? d .?
In regimentals the Super. looks gaudy and grand,
And that is the reason, you?ll understand,
Why, before Madame?s eyes,
He Sometimes will rise
Resplendent in these, and a smile so bland.
? Hem ! darling, you look so pretty that way ?
I fancy I hear the fair lady say;
And then she will snigger?
That?s when he don?t twig her?
While his business he tells in official way.
Some people suppose this house isn?t right,
But that is absurd, you?ll see at a sight ?
For the Super, is there
So oft, I declare,
That to think that it?s wrong is impossible quite.
Late on one night, some six months ago,
A rowdy, disgustingly vulgar and low,
Got hold of the hair
Of the lady fair,
And dealt to her many a cowardly blow.
Some say that the Super, was there that night,
And received a severe and a terrible fright;
But I don?t think it true,
And neither will you;
I?d as soon be believing his saintship was tight. ]


Besides, the fair lady, while being abused,
Called aloud for aid, and his name she used;
So ! if he?d been there,
I would really swear
That he the low blackguard had thoroughly bruised-
How the lady exists is remarkably funny,
For she never has yet seen the Super.?s money;
Why should she, you know ?
There?s no reason to show;
He always goes there so officially , sonny !
Besides, it is rumored, that three months back,
The money he'd lent (?) he had not got back ;
And thus did not pay
Until (so they say)
The bailiffs had entered his house in a crack.
Then there?s that rumor of Cock?s Eye?s cheque,
And how a good Phantom preserves the neck
Of the Super.?s credit
(He himself has said it)
By warning his friend of the coming wreck.
To the Clarkes, again, it is said, he went,
And his errand, ?well, he was on greed intent;
He got some, and sure
Then he wanted some more,^
But away on his business the Super, was sent.
I asked Jos. Pillins, of Kl ?I?s hotel,
How he kept his license so nicely and well;
But he winked his eye,
Said?? I see that you?re 1 fly,?
You know how I do it ?I needn?t tell!?
Then I went to a man by the name of Re,
Who, in Swanston street, has a ? pub.,? you know ;
I referred to that fifty,
He looked a bit shifty;
He knows that it's gone , and is satisfied so.
But these rumors are stuff, for at races we see
The Super, plumed out as large as can be;
He lays many a ? fiver
If he hadn?t a stiver
He couldn?t do this ?betwixt you and me!


Then ? the Bailiff,? ? the Bussel,? ? the Cock Eye? and
all,
Are a tissue of lies, and the Super. I call
A man very fit
To mightily sit
In judgment on sinners, both great and small.
He?s a pure-minded man, and shocked at the sound
Of a naughty word, in a journal found ;
A blush to the cheek
Will come if you speak
Of a lady?s foot, and say that it?s round.
In his house, when they ask for a piece of a rump
steak,
They say ?I a bit of � seat-fixing? will take
The table?s legs
Are the table?s pegs ;
Very properly, too, for decency sake.
Many times he has been by his victims cursed,
But in March his friends thought he?d beaten the
worst;
Then, in night-gown arrayed,
A saint he was made,
And his name in the church was Saint Sandy the First!
So now here I leave him, just for a time ;
My theme?s not exhausted, and many a rhyme
Is ready to tell
Of the virtues that dwell
In this man, who sheds tears when thinking of crime.
Many times at his unpleasant duties he?ll chafe,
But he is so pure that he?s perfectly safe;
So, Super,, ? Good-bye;
Yours, till I die,
The dirty, low-minded, degenerate?

I have asked several bookmakers why Captain Standish prosecuted
the Totalisator. They none of them knew?fact, I assure you.
f.-'; 11
*?' Yhe Evening Herald publishes sub-leaders on the advisability of
legalising the Totalisator, because it would help to purify the turf, and
promote a healthy state of gambling all round. Fancy Dick Thatcher
and Winter going round the country with this tarnation swindling con-
cern for the good of mankind ! Pretty tall idea, anyhow.
There are forty-seven images of naked women on view at the Free
Public Library, Swanston- street; also some score or so of vilely executed
ones in Fitzroy Park. I understand Messrs. Winch and Call are
organising a society to provide these unfortunates with fig leaves. Quite
right, too.
The Argus the other day gave an account of a man being prosecuted
in England for manslaughter. It appears the fellow used to fire off a
cannon, and catch the ball in his hands. He offered �5O on his farewell
night to anyone who would do the same. Some blamed son of a mule
tried it, and got his head burst right in. Guess it was a farewell enter-
tainment for that chap ! Anyhow, the Argus says the showman promised
? not to repeat the programme.? Blood and thunder ! what an idea ; as
if the court would have to make the fellow swear he would not produce
one corpse per night; as if he?d think of doing it! I fancy, if that coon
comes to Melbourne, they?ll bust his show here, straight away. The
prime joke, however, is in the fact that the Argus never meant to
be funny, but published the ? squib,? as though it were a genuine fact.
Some men are born editors !
There is a magsman on a large scale in Melbourne, who is always
watching for unsuspecting squatters. He frequents the Melbourne
Club, and many a country gentleman has been ? lambed down ? by this
roue,?and his friends, without ever knowing it. But one gudgeon ?grew
rusty on it and whipped the would-be hawk. The affair was hushed
up. This is like Melbourne.
It must be very unpleasant for Mr. Evans, the Revenue Inspector, to
be compelled to visit so many hotels of evil repute, where loose women
congregate, especially as he is a married man. But he finds it remunera-
tive, and the hotels flourish.
The Super, ?s pet poodle never does any dirty work. He states (and
?it is a remarkable fact) that there is not a single publican in Melbourne
paying ? black mail,? and I believe him. Oh ma !
The Duvalli sisters, celebrated for their unique entertainments, have
opened a school at which dancing, deportment, and etiquette a taught.

The Argus reporter, who frequents the house in-Lonsdale street, will
do well to remain away ; he should be virtuous, and stop at home. If
he paragraphs me as an obscene writer, he must be pure, or smay be I v
of ? fentin ? him. He will please take this hint.
Mr. Hughes, the free thought lecturer, lost his gown at Port
Queensland. He played tricks with the communion service, and other
church property, in Brisbane ; found it advisable to leave Eockhampton,
and now blackguards Christ. What next ?
You know the Freemasons? Hotel in Little Collins street; well, the
fair Neville has lost the attractive Amy. There will be a Brown less
haunting the place she has gone to. The quiet little Pub. is for sale, so ,
I will describe it in my next.
Nellie Johnston is flourishing in her business. They tell me she is
buying up all the ?shops? around her way. Neither ?the run down
dingo ? nor (Oh ma, I don?t like to say) know why she is unmolested;
but if you want to find out anything about ? tipping,? of course not con-
nected with this mystery, call on Emily and she will explain how it is
some folks make money. Address?Apply office of the paper.
Julia Levy has not recovered her jewellery. ? The coon who collared it
will do well to call on her; she loves him ?still, and will keep sober in
future when he is hanging around.
The following startling advertisement appeared in the Argus of Sat-
urday last, April 10.?Opinion of the London Times. ? Mdlle. Carlotta
Patti is an artist whose name alone would command homage and ensure ?*
patronage in any part of the civilized world. This wonderful songstress,
who warbles like the bird upon the tree, because singing is in her nature,
but throws into her tones such melting images of thought, such impas-
sioned utterances and intellectual censuousness that no bird could ever
dream of. . . The reception was tremendous last Monday. . . The
audience rose at her.? The italics are my own. Now just fancy the
Times writing that. ? Melting images of thought ?; what on earth are
they like? they must be somehow mixed up with spiritism. Then what
is ? intellectual sensuousness ?? Tare and hounds! here is an anomaly for
you. And again??no bird could ever dream of.? Now, as far as I
know, birds don?t dream at all, and if they do they should be dosed-with
salts; their stomachs must be a bit out. But one wonder more ?? the

audience rose at her. YYell, if they did, it was highly improper, and
the scene anything but correct. I fancy the Times must have been a bit
boosed when it published that extraordinary legend- I could understand
it in the Age, but in the Times ?Oh! come now, Vivo, old boy, don?t get
skylarking with us provincials.
