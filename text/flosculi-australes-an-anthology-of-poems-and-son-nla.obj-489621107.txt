INTRODUCTORY NOTE.
On the suggestion of the Prefects, the Editorial Committee of the Scotch
Collegian issue this anthology of Poems and Songs for the benefit of the War
Memorial Fund. In commending the volume to members of the School, they feel
that they need say no more than that it contains the gems with which the pages
of the Collegian were enriched by two of our most gifted editors, B. C, Thomson
and J. D. Burns, both of whom fell in the War. The volume may be regarded
as a tribute to their memory. Their poems, which have already been published
separately by their relatives, may be in the hands of some of our Old Boys, but it
will not be out of place if we give here a summary of their all too brief careers.
Boyd C. Thomson was the second son of the late Mr. Campbell Thomson, of
Clydebank House, Sale, and grandson of the Hon. Robert Thomson, at one time
Chairman of the House of Assembly. He attended Scotch College from 1907 to
1912, and from 1909 contributed regularly to the Original Column of the School
Magazine. His poems are marked by a strong reflective note, in which the sense
of sadness at life’s bafflings is overborne by the conviction that right will ultimately
triumph and that the influence of a good life can never perish.
“And thus in life the great shall pass away;
But there shall never wane
That afterglow which shall in measure sway
All those that yet remain.”
In 1912 he was a Prefect and edited the Scotch Collegian. Early in 1913 he
became an articled pupil in Architecture, and gave promise of rising to a high place
in his profession, but the call of England came to him as it had come to J. D. Burns.
He enlisted on June 30, 1915, and fell in the battle of the Somme, November 8,
1916. As the School Poet, he had already celebrated the Diamond Jubilee in
1911, in two poems, “The Jubilee’’ and “A Jubilee Ode.” Before leaving for the
front, he wrote his farewell “To the Mother School,” which will be found on the
opening page. His devotion to his School is also shown in the dedicatory lines
contained in the booklet of “Boyhood’s Fancies,” which he himself arranged. There
he writes: —


“To thee, O mother of our youth,
The guardian of our childhood’s days,
Who to the temple-gates of Truth
Hast led our steps by devious ways;
To thee who art our loyal friend
Our songs of love for aye ascend,
To thee our steps we homeward bend,
To thee alone we give the praise.
To thee, the spirit which inspires
The old-time haunts we know so well,
Where loving memory never tires
Each vanished moment to retell;
Where soft remembrance joys to trace
With tender finger every face,
And sorrow gives us breathing space
In bygone happiness to dwell.
To thee, whose love was love indeed,
A love which gave nor asked return,
That never broke the bruised reed,
Nor set a task too hard to learn,
To thee we yield the higher prize,
A wealth of love which never dies,
And offer up a sacrifice
Of fires that never cease to burn.”
I D. Burns was the elder son of the Rev. H. M. Burns and a grandson of
Mrs. J. D. Burns, of Malvern, and the late Rev. J. D. Burns, of Hampstead auto
of some of our choicest hymns. He attended Scotch College from 1911 to 1914.
In 1913 he was a Prefect and Editor of the Scotch Collegian, gamed first place
the Shakespeare Society’s Examination, and won an open Resident Scholarship
at Ormond College. In the University Examinations at the end of the year he
won the Exhibition in English and First-Class Honours in History In 1914 he
was Vice-Captain of the School, rowed in the College Eight He was again
Editor of the Collegian , and at the close of the year gamed First-Class Honours m
History and Latin. Soon after leaving school he heard the bugles of Eng an >
and left Egypt for the Dardanelles at the end of August, 1915: He was on board
the Southland when she was torpedoed, and had been in the trenches only three
weeks when he fell on September 18. From 1911 he was a regular contributor to
the Original Column. His power in narrative verse is revealed m The Conquerors
and “The Ocean’s Reply,” while “The Budgeree Cup” shows what he could do m
a lighter vein. His penetrating vision and his delicacy of touch may be seen in
his sonnet, “In Memoriam, W.C.A.,” and in lyrics like “The Untuned Harp,
“Dead Leaves,” and “The Gentle Lady.”
Then he gave the harp to Love,
Well skilled in minstrelsy,
And she drew from its strings a song
Of tenderest melody.”


Before leaving for the front, he sent us his immortal gem, “For England,”
which will ever be treasured by Scotch Collegians, and which has been published
wherever the English language is known.
“The bugles of England were blowing o’er the sea,
As they had called a thousand years, calling now to me;
They woke me from dreaming in the dawning of the day,
The bugles of England—and how could I stay?
The banners of England, unfurled across the sea,
Floating out upon the wind, were beckoning to me;
Storm-rent and battle-torn, smoke-stained and grey,
The banners of England—and how could I stay?
O England, I heard the cry of those that died for thee
Sounding like an organ-voice across the wintry sea;
They lived and died for England, and gladly went their way,
England, O England—how could / stay?”
Thomson and Burns, as they offered their lives in the service of their country,
dedicated their genius to their School. The stimulus which they gave to literary
effort, to patriotic fervour, to high aspiration is reflected in the pages of the
Scotch Collegian during the arduous years that have passed since 1914. It will be
seen that practically all the poems which are included in this selection have been
written since Thomson and Burns left the School. And they are only a selection.
The chief difficulty of the Editor has been to decide what must be left out. He is
aware that he has omitted much that was worthy to be included.
It has been said that poetry “says nothing in a maze of beautiful words.” The
author of the epigram would have it that the true object of poetry is to reform
the world and bring about the millennium. The object of our poets has been
exquisitely set forth by Maxwell in his sonnet on “The Poet.”
“He built a city, fair, with glancing spire
And shady grove, beside a sunlit sea,
That men might look within and, wond’ring, see
The perfect beauty of his heart’s desire.
He sang a song that men might catch the fire
And know with him life’s endless harmony,
The music that through all eternity
Before creation and beyond the pyre
Speaks in the lives of men. O, mighty bard!
Heaven’s gift to man, voicing divine decrees,
Painting all beauties with the master hand,
Softening the touch of time and fortune hard,
Pure as the snow-clad heights or salt sea-breeze,
Though kings and empires fall, thy work shall stand.”
And if in building their city they have not laid the axe to the root of the tree
of social wrong, we still venture to say that they have said something. They
gather up into verse all the influences which have moulded the life of good men
from the foundation of the world, all the cravings of the heart which are the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever. They give fervid expression to the love of home,


of school, of country, of departed friends, of nature, of Australian scenery, o
art, of music, of all that is beautiful and true and good. If it is not unimportant
for a School that its inmost soul should find melodious expression, then we must
agree that our poets have said something. Nor have they said it m a maze of
words. On the contrary, they bring to their task the directness, the simplicity,
the ardour, and the primal sincerity of youth. They speak from the heart to the
heart, appealing to all that is noble and good in the world, and (let it be said)
voicing the eternal truths which more than Acts of Parliament contain in
themselves the seeds of the redress of social wrong. Their influence on the life
and thought of the School is mirrored in the pages of the Scotch Collegian.
We have not deemed it necessary to point to the immaturity of our poets or to
offer any apology for their work. We are satisfied that the sympathetic leader will
marvel at the musical quality in the work of boys who were wrestling with an
unfamiliar and difficult vehicle of expression. It may be well to say, however,
that the Editors, whose photographs are reproduced, were boys of 17 or 18 years
of age, and that the poems were written by boys between the ages of 15 and 18
years. ' We have not felt at liberty to disclose the authors, except in the case of
those poems of Thomson and Burns which have already been published under
their names. An attempt has been made to group the poems according to subject.
The order is chronological, except where it was felt that a poem by its subject was
specially appropriate for opening a section.
NOTE TO THE SECOND ISSUE.
All that has been said above applies to the second issue of the anthology,
which covers the period from 1904 to May, 1933. The only difference is that
with a wider field of choice, the poems have been subjected to a stricter scrutiny.


School Songs


For England
The banners of England, unfurled across the sea,
Floating out upon the wind, were beckoning to me,
Storm-rent and battle-torn, smoke-stained and grey,
The banners of England—and how could I stay?
O England! I heard the cry of those that died for thee,
Sounding like an organ voice across the winter sea;
They lived and died for England, and gladly went their way,
England! O England! How could I stay ?


College Anthem
On the playgrounds we have striven
With the joy of battle keen;
To the wall we’ve oft been driven,
But no foe has e’er been given
Chance to call our actions mean;
Deeds of bygone days inspire us,
Thoughts of emulation fire us,
Hard-fought battles ne’er can tire us,
And our game is ever keen.
Deeply stirring is the story
That our fathers often tell;
Hard-fought fights and deeds of glory
Done by heroes now grown hoary,
Who, when young, did serve thee well.
Their old burden now we’re bearing,
Deeds as great as theirs we’re daring,
And their glory now we’re sharing,
And with joy our glad hearts swell.


Scotch College Song


On the river we have sworn,
Though our foes we do not scorn,
To keep up the noble record of the past;
And you’ll see no faltering crew
Wearing cardinal, gold and blue,
For we’ve nailed our colours firmly to the
mast.
Chorus.
Well rowed, Scotch! the boys are calling,
Hear them cheering on the shore,
As we battle round the bend,
With a spurt kept for the end,
There’s no sweeter music than that mighty
roar.
We’ve had heroes on the field,
Who the willow well could wield,
Men who made a name as demons with the
ball;
And our sun has never set,
We have heroes with us yet,
Who we hope will do the greatest deeds of
all.
Chorus.
Well played, Scotch! the boys are calling,
Hear them cheering as we score;
If we fail we take the blame,
Win or lose we play the game,
Glad if winners, but if beaten never sore.
On the football field we’ve shown
We can more than hold our own,
Though our rivals made the team play all
they knew.
As they got into their stride
Every Scotch lad thrilled with pride
In the team that wears the cardinal, gold
and blue.
Chorus.
Well played, Scotch! the boys are calling,
Champions year one nine one three!
Like the spider, oft they failed,
But at last their grit prevailed,
And no rival grudges them their victory.
Fathers who wi’ Wallace bled,
And whom Bruce has often led,
Taught us how to fight for glorious liberty:
And with courage just as high,
We’re prepared to do or die,
That our land, beloved Australia, may be
free.
Chorus.
Fall in, Scotch! the bugle’s sounding,
All there when there’s work to do;
Should a foe our land attack
There will be no holding back
By the boys who wear the cardinal, gold
and blue.


Boating Song
TUNE .


Sometimes in your dreams you’ll hear a deep’ning roar,
Like the ocean surf that beats upon the shore;
Long-forgotten voices will greet you,
Scenes long past will rise up to meet you;
You will see the gleaming river’s long expanse,
You will see the crowds that watch with eager glance,
Shut your eyes,
All will rise,
Now you can see the old scene before you. Listen—
Chorus;
Hark! the crowds are cheering,
As the bend they’re nearing,
Where those boats go racing along,
Breath is coming thicker,
Yet the stroke is quicker,
While the crowd is cheering for the boys in cardinal.
Round the bend they’re swinging,
To the foe they’re clinging,
Set the echoes ringing,
As their boat they’re bringing
Level now, and springing
To their work, they’re flinging
All pursuit behind.
It may be some time since you last saw that sight;
You are going to see it once again to-night,
Stroke for stroke, they’re fighting and straining,
Swinging steady, steadily gaining;
Twenty strokes will take her home, so plug along;
Breath is coming short and thick, but hearts are strong,
One stroke more,
Then the roar
Telling of victory; long will we remember.


General McCay


Now Scotchies scattered far and wide have gathered in their might,
On many a schoolboy battlefield they’ve learned the way to fight.
They’ve set their faces towards the West to pay a call on Bill,
And if they chance to find him in, they’ll greet him with a will.
They’re comrades true of one old school, they know what they’re about,
But when they knocked at Vilhelm’s door, they found old Vilhelm out.
All the Scotchies sing and cry,
Hi! Hi! Hi! Generals Monash, Smith, McCay,
We’ve been with you, wet or dry,
Ready to do or die! (Hooch-aye).
B


Forty Years On


Routs and discomfitures, rushes and rallies,
Marking and kicking and passing it on,
Strife without anger, art without malice,
How will it seem to you, forty years on?
Then, you will say, not a feverish minute
Strained the weak heart and the wavering knee,
Never the battle raged hottest, but in it
Neither the last nor the faintest were we!
O! the great days, in the distance enchanted,
Days of fresh air, in the rain and the sun,
How we rejoiced as we struggled and panted,
Hardly believable, forty years on!
How we discoursed of them, one with another,
Auguring triumph or balancing fate,
Loved the ally with the heart of a brother,
Hated the foe with a playing at hate!
Forty years on, growing older and older,
Shorter in wind, as in memory long,
Feeble of foot, and rheumatic of shoulder,
What will it help you that once you were strong ?
God give us goals to guard or beleaguer,
Games to play out, whether earnest or fun;
Fights for the fearless, and goals for the eager,
Twenty, and thirty, and forty years on!


Scotch! Boot the Leather, O
The ball is bounced on centre spot,
The ruck man for it dashes, O,
And swift and straight as arrow-shot
It to the rover passes, O.
As up and down the field it goes
With many flights and crushes, O,
They forward with unerring toes,
Or stem the passing rushes, O,
As we grow old and short of breath,
And show on top smooth patches, O,
We’ll constant swear by Scotch till death
And shout at all her matches, O!

The School
TO THE MOTHER SCHOOL.
Mother, thy blessing! the time has come
To follow the rest of thy stalwart sons
Forth, to the sound of the rolling drum,
So soon to be lost in the roar of guns,
Where the banner of Britain to glory runs.
Mother, thy blessing! the time has come.
Mother, thy blessing! before we go,
Leaving all that is dear to heart,
Love of the home and the fireside glow,
Love of music and delicate art—
With these and more it is hard to part;
Mother, thy blessing! before we go.
Mother, thy blessing! for life was sweet,
Sweet with the love of a thousand things,
And every hour that sped so fleet
Flung a flood of joy, as the morning flings
The light of life from its radiant wings.
Mother, thy blessing! foj life was sweet.
Mother, thy blessing! we went for thee;
’Twas little to give, but much to lose;
But how could we think di thee else than free,
While supple of sinews and strong of thews?
How could we falter, or worse—refuse?
Mother, thy blessing! we went for thee.
Mother! our brothers have gone before:
They call—they call us to join the fray.
And shadows of faces that are no more,
The faces we loved so, cold and gray,
Cry loud for vengeance; how can we stay?
Mother! our brothers have gone before.
Mother, thy blessing 1 and then, good-bye!
Would you wish for your so»s a happier aim
Than that a man go forth to die
' For a faith that is more than an empty name,
For a faith that burns like a scorching flame?
Mother, thy blessing! and so—good-bye!
August, 19f5. B. C. Thomson.
STAT FORTUNA DOMUS.
The dreamy summer days, when far we strayed,
Through scrub and woodland, over mount
and hill,
When Nature to our eyes her wealth dis-
played— n
The splashing waterfall, the sparkling rill,
Into the distance fade,
And only in our mem’ries they remain,
To brighten days of sorrow or of pain.
We climbed the breezy mountain’s rocky peak,
Or in the gullies heard the bell-bird’s note,
We’d fish beneath the willows on the creek,
Or in deep pools we’d swim or idly float.
But swift succeeds each week;
And as the days fly past, the time draws nigh,
When we to those loved spots must bid
good-bye.
But summer dwells not always in the land,
The soft breeze changes to the wailing wind,
Grim winter stretches forth his icy hand,
And strips the verdant tree. But still I find
That thou, my school, wilt stand;
For aye unmoved by Time’s slow-rolling
stream,
Thy grey pile, ivy clad, will rise supreme.
April, 1912. J, D. Burns.
THE DAYS OF LONG AGO.
Time: The Long, Long Trail.
(Sung at the Foundation Day Concert.)
In that sea of upturned faces
Some there are that show
From their minds Time ne’er erases
The Days of Long Ago.
Visions of them rise before you,
Magic, grand, but true,
The songs you hear us sing,
Surely they must bring
All those old days back to you.
O the grand old days of Boyhood
That you love, aye, and revere,
And the old school songs we’re singing,
With their mem’ries dear.
While the years and years were rolling,
Those memories you love so,
Then let us sing to the memory
Of the Days of Long Ago.
O! how many years divide you
From those days of youth,
When so many a struggle tried you,
Taught you strength and truth!
On the playing fields or working,
The School e’er first you set,
“Not self, but the School,”
Was e’er your guiding rule,
And the years brought no regret.
1917. A. W. Dawes.
THE CLOUD OF WITNESSES.
Here in these ivied and time-hallowed walls,
Not knowing, yet not wholly ignorant,
May I hold converse with thy mighty sons,
And learn the lessons that their lives would
teach—
Strivings, unnoticed, ’mid the common throng,
Have myriad silent voices, whispering
Of Truth and Honour and a life not bound
In self, but in the triple chains of love.
And half-forgotten memories linger still,
And echoes of heroic lives roll on
To stir anew the slumbering pulse and light
With radiance of Endeavour dormant souls.
Each word, each thought, is writ in deathless
bronze,
And each, a slender thread of truth, is woven
In the eternal woof of future times,
The fate of most remote Posterity.
May, 1917. I-R-M.


THE JUBILEE.
Rejoice! the hour of Jubilee is here.
Let not a cloud of vain regret obscure
The solemn glory of the sixtieth year.
What though the yearning heart can scarce
endure
The thought of passing from our boyhood’s
home,
Our Alma Mater and our sacred Friend?
What though our fate decrees that we should
roam
Beyond the walls and never more ascend
Her steps and corridors? Have we not seen
The wondrous spirit of her inmost life?
Can we not serve as golden links between
The past and future glory, and by strife
Or calm endurance rise in endless flight,
Raising ourselves from higher steps to higher,
Whilst ever nearer, fame’s unwavering light
Beckons with unextinguishable fire?
So hail to the dear old College,
Full three-score winters old,
Where the burning lamp of knowledge
Will never smoulder cold.
And hail to the proud old banner
Of cardinal, blue, and gold;
The flag we love, which floats above
And guards her sacred fold.
Here’s a toast to her sons that battle
In the ranks of the bold and brave,
In the noise of the cannon’s rattle,
Where the wounded moan and rave;
And a toast to her sons that travel
Across the stormy wave:
And a silent one to every son
That rests within the grave.
Proclaim then her praise for ever,
For the sake of the years that are done,
For the friendships that nothing can sever,
For the dazzling fame she has won.
And proudly her banner is floating,
Whilst ever the long years run,
As proudly it will, for ever until
This earth be lost to the sun.
So hail to the dear old College,
Full three-score winters old,
Where the burning lamp of knowledge
Will never smoulder cold.
And we’ll love her fondly ever,
And dear we’ll ever hold,
Though years roll by, and friendships die,
The Cardinal, Blue and Gold.
October, 1911. B. C. Thomson.
SCOTCH COLLEGIANS’ ODE.
Form! Form! Scions of Scotia, Form!
Stand ye together, comrades in heart and
thought;
Pure in your purpose, from great memories
wrought
To fitness for new freedoms, brave for peace or
storm,
Rally, and gather, and form!
Wallace our hero, Bruce our king, and Knox
Our dauntless prophet: Oh, be brave and
true!
Scott our Merlin and Burns! ’gainst bitter
Fortune’s shocks,
“An honest man,” he sang, “is God’s own
‘royal blue.’ ”
Oh, rally, and follow, and form 1
Honour to England! Honour to Erin fair!
We who can forage, each for his own, send
hail
To all Australia—“ Rise! be firm! and dare
To make the Southlands known by lore and
mast and sail,
Up, to the Struggle, and form!”
Form! Form! Great by the heart and brow!
Gather your forces, win new laurels wrought
Of Faith and Skill and Love’s sweet secret,
taught
By toiling each for each in the young living
Now!
Shoulder to shoulder, form!
Form! Form! In the new Southlands fair
Have we not grit and sinew like our sires?
“God and the People!”—rouse ye, do and dare 1
With thew of mind that falters not, nor
tires!
Up, and forward, and form!
Form! Rouse ye, and rally, and onward
march!
Paths of Science cleave ye, and explore;
Knit ye the bridge of the river, and traffic’s
arch,
Smelt ye the gold of the mine, and true
Thought’s subtler ore;
Like your sires in the days of
yore!
Win to the van, and before!
Up, and rally, and form!
October, 1905. A.O.R.
FAREWELL SONG.
{Tune, “Battle Hymn of the Republic” 1862).
Scotch, now we leave thee, forth to fare on
life’s untrodden way,
We who loved thee, and adored thee, in our
work and in our play,
But living, loving, learning, dreaming, dying,
we shall say,
“Scotch, all praise be thine!”
Now, some go forth at God’s great call to
minister the Word,
And their hearts are ever hopeful, for their
hopes were ne’er deterr’d
Whilst thou to them didst min’ster, ere the
mighty Call they heard:
“Scotch, all praise be thine!”
And some go forth before the Flag, with head
held high and proud,
For the honour of the Empire, life and free-
dom they have vowed;
If the Flag become their Glory, if the Flag be-
come their shroud,
“Scotch, all praise be thine!”
But some are young and follow still sage learn-
ing’s devious ways,
And the Light of Progress they pursue thro’
darksome nights and days—


When at last they shall receive their mighty
meed of fame and praise,
“Scotch, all praise be thine!”
Now, Scotch, we leave thee, leaving, too, our
boyhood’s dreams and fears,
But our mighty aspirations shall not vanish
with the years—
And when at last the shining Light, that
crowns the Task, appears,
“Scotch, all praise be thine 1”
December, 1917. A.W.D.
“WHAT SHALL I MORE SAY?”
Good-bye, our little hopes and fears
Are gone; yet something greater stands,
For we must beat with desperate hands
The adamantine march of years.
Pleasure may pass on flying feet,
The song is sung, the tale is told,
But through our battle-years we hold
A sword that never knew defeat.
And now before the clanging bell
Cries that the end is drawing near,
We only know that thou wast dear,
And cannot find the words to tell.
Faint hands reach out where, far above,
There floats the fragment of a song,
And unavailing fingers long
To touch the golden chord of love.
Yet, though the quavering notes and thin
From half-remembered strings are drawn,
And though the halting sense is borne
On words that mock the soul within;
Yet can I write without regret,
For thou at least wilt understand,
Although the waves leave blank and wet
A scrawled infinity of sand.
-December, 1919. I.R.M.
AFTER MANY YEARS.
You bid me write, imposing no conditions
Of style or theme, grave, gay, or old or new;
Such changes in our relative positions
Have come about since last I wrote for you!
Then your behests left room for no evasion,
The blackboard bristled questions, tier on
tier;
Your wishes were on every such occasion
Limpid and clear.
And varied, too —Who wrote “The Rights of
Man”?
“Did current topics warp great Shakespeare’s
Muse?”
“The following extract punctuate and scan—”
“The periods of Johnson?” “Wordsworth’s
views
Of man and nature?” These and kindred others
You choose from all those well-remembered
books—
Could we but call them to the bar, my brothers,
I mean, their spooks!
My efforts to discriminate at present
’Twixt Simile and Metaphor are vain,
Likewise what is Metonymy and isn’t
I cannot for the life of me explain;
Yet am I of that Scotch unlisted legion,
Who still with kindly thought your name
endue,
And, quartered now in near or distant region,
Take off their hats to you.
Still, in your wainscot room unfold the beauty
Of English letters, your reward the same,
To shoot the dull-spun weft of schoolboy duty
With crimson o’ romance. Now in the name
Of classes that will never meet again,
Whose schoolday prime your goodness still
made brighter,
Accept these Hmping verses. I remain
The least of these—the writer.
December, 1920. Bon-Accord.
THE VOICE OF THE SCHOOL.
(Tune: A Student Song.)
Hail to thee, Song of a strong love unsleeping I
Raising thy voice like the sound of the sea;
Waves of thy melody o’er us are sweeping,
Rolling forever, majestic and free.
Let the brave sound through the still air
resound—
Speed it along,
Swiftly and strong—
The glorious lilt of our College song!
Voices are fed from the love that is glowing
Ardently bright in the depths of each heart;
Love of our School—the one School—is out-
flowing,
Songs we are chanting where pain has no part.
Swiftly they rise to the listening skies;
Weakness disdain,
Power must we gain
To send up on high our triumphant strain!
Scotch, to us ever your dear fame is gleaming,
Leading, inspiring our hearts in their youth;
Life is a joy if we live it in deeming
Earth’s greatest treasures to come from pure
Truth.
Then let each voice in its young strength
rejoice;
Happy we sing,
As to a king,
The richness of praise in our song we bring!
Comes from past ages the chant of our glory;
Clearly it rings through the clash of the
swords;
Let the high strains of its wonderful story
Sound in the midst of our resonant chords.
Rising above on the wings of our love,
Rushing along,
Deathlessly strong,
The conquering sounds of our College song!
August, 1922. Kazan.
SCHOOL SONG.
O Scotch! Dear mother of our youth, and
guide through rolling years,
Dear witness of our triumphs bright, our boy-
hood hopes and fears,
Where striving, learning, dreaming, in thy
classrooms or thy fields,
We toiled not for a selfish fame, but thee the
prize to yield.


Chorus:
Love eternal, love undying, Scotch, forever we
are thine;
Rolling years, so swiftly flying, filled with
shadow and with shine,
Ne’er erase the storied memory of thine ivy-
mantled towers,
Speaking ever of our schooldays, of our happy
boyhood hours.
Dear Scotch, thy sons have learned of thee,
in cloister and in field,
To live by Honour and by Truth, to strive, and
not to yield,
With sinew strained to breaking point to rush
the winning goal,
And, if to fail, to rise again, with undefeated
soul.
Chorus:
Love eternal, love undying, Scotch, forever we
are thine;
Rolling years, so swiftly flying, filled with
shadow and with shine,
Ne’er can cause thy name to falter, or to wither
and decay;
Scotch, old School, our love grows fonder, ever
dearer, day by day.
O Scotch, upon thy sovereign brows we set a
crown of glory,
A crown thy sons have won for thee, wrought
out in deed and story;
When we have left thy portals, when the hour
has come to part,
Still, when we turn in thought to thee, the old
love stirs our heart.
Chorus:
Love eternal, love undying, Scotch, forever we
are thine;
Rolling years, so swiftly flying, filled with
shadow and with shine,
Ne’er can cause thy name to falter, or to wither
and decay;
Scotch, old School, our love grows fonder, ever
dearer, day by day.

THE SCHOOL.
Grey shadows creep across the playing fields,
And lengthen with the lengthening of the day.
Unpeopled, but not desolate, stands the school,
For such a place can ne’er be desolate,
Peopled with souls of those who loved her once,
Now spread around the world in every clime;
Some rising with the cock to greet a world
White with the winter’s robe, where towers
and trees
Sparkle beneath the sky and every sound
Is muffled by the cloak of fallen snow.
’Mid dust and flying sand and torrid heat,
Where not a living blade or tree is seen,
But only brown unending miles of sand,
Which shimmers into myriad dancing shapes,
Temples or palaces or rocks or trees.
One rides—
Another, where the punkah flaps,
Monotonous as is a drowsy dream,
Or on the great leviathan’s throbbing deck,
Cries mastery across the brooding deep.
Still sets the sun and still the shadows creep
Relentlessly as time across the fields;
In many a weary haunt, the thoughts go back
To the same shadows when they saw them last
Setting the seal of evening on the school.
May, 1931. J.K.W.


Lyrics of Life
INVOCATION.
Out of the heart of the sunset fires,
Out of the changeless deep,
Lady mine of a thousand lyres,
Throned where the white stars weep,
Fill me the chalice of lost desires
Out of the pools of sleep.
Give me the burning kiss of the sun,
For my heart longs to be free,
And the silver glory of nights star-spun,
In the wastes of the silver sea,
Where never the idle zephyrs come,
But they breathe from thy heart to me.
So on the quiet tides of night,
Under the dreaming moon,
Come from the sea, oh, heart’s delight,
From the sea-caves, sapphire-strewn;
Come with the dead star’s burning flight,
Come on the wings of the dying light,
Only, come soon.
May, 1919. I.R-M.
THE EYES OF DAWN.
First printed as Introductory to Flosculi
Australes, 1919.
They lie beyond the sunset lands,
Strange fires wherein the worlds are born;
Dark seas that beat on silver sands
Before the cities of the dawn.
We see within the sapphire gates
Suns that on younger ages shone,
And nights that gleam with starry freights,
And moons that dreamed on Babylon.
We bring dim beauties from the dead,
Pale glimpses out of happy ways;
And dreams of sunsets that were red
Upon the ashes of glad days.
We know strange ghosts that will not stay,
But stare and pass us in the night;
We know, but may not bring away
The ichor of the infinite.
So read: although the words are cold,
And faltering utterance deceives;
And dream our dreams that soon grow old
And vanish with the Autumn leaves.
August, 1919. I.R.M.
FUGACES LABUNTUR ANNI.
Winds of heaven, sighing, sighing,
From eternal night to dawnings
Transient, and full-blossomed mornings
To the sinking of the sun,
Swiftly flying,
Softly dying,
In the setting of the sun.
Winds of heaven, wailing, wailing,
In the dusky tree-tops nightly,
When the earth is steeped lightly
In the glow of starry skies,
Swiftly sailing,
Softly failing
In the arms of bright sunrise.
Hear, and answer ere your going
In the mists that veil your dying,
Tell me in your mournful sighing
Of the loved ones lost to me.
Ghostly blowing,
Sing the going
Of the loved ones lost to me.
So our years slip down the ages
From eternal night to dawnings
Transient, and full-blossomed mornings
To the endless night of time.
Fools and sages
Down the ages
Vanish in the . night of time.
Yet we trust that greater splendour
Shall illumine brave endeavour
When the sunlight fades for ever
And the last sad bell is rung;
Life shall render
Greater splendour,
When the evensong is sung.
August, 1917. I.R.M.
BEYOND IT ALL.
What is a verse? ’Tis but a straggling line
Of words —half meant . . .
And yet I’ve seen two eyes drip burning tears
At their intent.
What is a masterpiece? A daub of paint,
Mere imitation?
I’ve heard a heart cry out in ecstasy
At Art’s creation.
What is a melody? Mere wavering sounds
That rise . . . and fall . . . ?
Was it mere noise that spurred yon hero on,
That bugle call?
All, all is one! It is the fire divine,
Life’s quenchless spark:
Where the great soul of Man, immortal made,
Leaps from the dark.
August, 1917. “Grac.”
THE AFTERGLOW
In solemn majesty the sunset dies,
Burnished with crimson fire,
Where rolling thunderclouds in masses rise,
A fitting funeral pyre.
But when the passionate radiance of the West
Has lost its burning might,
A silver afterglow will sometimes rest
On plain and snow-capped height.
Softer and sweeter is its mellow ray,
And in its tide it bears
Something which stirs the soul and drives away
All earthly trials and cares.
Thus power and beauty fade and leave behind
But little to be seen,
Only the sweet sad light that calls to mind
The glory that has been.


And thus in life the great shall pass away;
But there shall never wane
That afterglow which shall in measure sway
All those that yet remain.
October, 1910. B. C. Thomson.
THE VANITY OF SPRING.
The song of the breeze in the rushes
Is sweet with the music of morn,
Ere the first white mountain-top flushes
’Neath the glance of the goddess of dawn;
While the dancing rivulet gushes,
And laughs dark shadows to scorn,
O’er boulder and pebble, with babbling treble,
Through bracken and emerald lawn.
The notes of the bell-bird are ringing,
As the sun creeps up through the trees;
And the wattle its perfume is flinging,
Enticing the wild forest bees.
And the magpie his carol is singing
In notes which cannot but please,
As heavenward sailing on pinions unfailing
He floats in the arms of the breeze.
The strands of the green weeping willow
Bend downward over the stream,
To kiss the crest of the billow
Which basks in the morning beam;
Or stirs on its watery pillow,
Like one in a beautiful dream,
While soft water-cresses in quiet recesses
Are bathed in the sun’s bright gleam.
The lilies that float in the river
All open their buds to the day,
And call on the sun to deliver
The warmth of his crystalline ray.
And the dew-spangled gossamers quiver,
As the blades of the river-grass sway,
And wild-flowers tender awake to the splendour
That chases all shadows away.
Thus life appears in its morning,
In the gaudy apparel of Spring,
The sweetness of shadowland scorning,
Where birds do not joyously sing;
But oh, how sad is the warning
Which the heralds of Summer must bring,
That the hour of youth flies like a hawk in the
skies,
And vanity sits on the wing.
October, 1911. B. C. Thomson.
THE UNTUNED HARP.
A harp there was of gold,
Well-shapen and fair to see,
But its songs were all unsung,
Unheard its melody.
For many a minstrel tried
With all his art and skill
To play it; but all in vain,
Its music was mute and still.
And the soul of the harp cried, grieving,
“Is there none that knows the art
To play the songs I am weaving—
That are locked within my heart?”
Sorrow took up the harp,
A workman skilled and old;
With fingers kindly cruel,
He stripped away its gold.
He struck each silent string
Till the trembling echoes woke;
And those that were out of tune,
He tightened or loosed—or broke.
And the soul of the harp was wounded
It cried in agony,
“The music that might have sounded
Is stilled for ever in me.”
Then Time took up the harp,
Gentle fingered and faced,
He loosed the straining strings,
Those broken he replaced.
Then he gave the harp to Love,
Well skilled in minstrelsy,
And she drew from its strings a song
Of tenderest melody.
And the soul of the harp, high-soaring
On new-found wings of song,
Forgot its pain, in pouring
Forth music sweet and strong.

DEAD LEAVES.
The sun sets redly in the west,
The wind aweary moans and grieves,
And whirls and scatters with no rest,
Dead Autumn leaves.
The sunset flames with dying light,
And glows upon the golden sheaves,
The restless wind in hurrying flight
Drives the dead leaves.
The Summer’s glory is no more,
The swallows long have left the eaves,
All that remains of fruitful store
Is but dead leaves.
All that is born in Spring’s glad reign,
All that the summer’s growth achieves,
Have passed away, and now remain
Only dead leaves.
Hopes born while in the Spring of life,
Faith that in later years deceives,
Amid the struggle and the strife,
Turn to dead leaves.
October, 1912. J. D. Burns.
AD ASTRA.
Onward and upward ever,
A task is waiting still
The patience of endeavour,
The strength of iron will:
Onward and upward, better
A martyrdom of pain,
Than bear the lightest fetter
That drags us down again.
See how the clouds of even,
O’er pinnacle and spire,
Float in the vault of heaven,
Like pearls in a sea of fire;
So shall the light of duty
Illume the clouds of woe,
And with eternal beauty
Transfigure all below.


Onward! let dotards prattle
Of peaceful, quiet life;
Give us the storm of battle,
The glory of the strife:
Onward and upward, scorning,
The cautioning of fear;
Onward the light is dawning,
And victory is near.
On, on, weary and breathless,
For life will soon be past;
Yet victory is deathless,
The prize shall come at last;
A land of noble treasure,
Where sorrow melts away,
In glory without measure
And everlasting day.
December, 1912. B. C. Thomson.
RELENTLESS TIME.
Relentless Time! why in thy harsh career
Dost rob us of those things we hold most dear,
Reserving us but Death—a gloomy bier,
For end, —a grave,
Reaping the harvest ere the ripening ear
Full promise gave?
He was a lad whose prospects all were bright,
Manly and bold, still steadfast in the right,
Plunged by thee into eternal night,
No more to rise,
Until a greater overcome thy might
And ope his eyes.
Oh faith! we pray thee, guide us thro’ the
shade,
And let us—trusting, strong and unafraid,
Watch with bright hope the ravage death has
- made,
Until at last
We may rejoice triumphant, as the glade
Of death is passed.

AUTUMN MEMORIES.
I have gathered a rose in a garden of flowers,
And scattered its petals in soft scented
showers ;
But the roses are dead, and the garden locked
fast,
And I sigh, but in vain, for the rose of the
past.
I have walked in a valley where scented winds
blow,
And the peach blossom rains on the deep grass
below,
But I pressed toward the mountain alluring me
then,
Ah! would that I walked in my valley again.
I have loved in the Spring when the sun was
on high,
I have loved when the stars hung like lamps
in the sky;
But I flung away love as I pressed to my goal,
Nor knew I had darkened the light of my soul.
I have naught but a rose stem, whose petals
are shed,
And the thought of a valley whose fragrance
is dead;
But, ah! I have naught of the love that I bore,
For love cast away is recovered no more.
Oh, you who have roses and valleys of bliss,
And loves for the Spring and the Summer, hear
this, —
You may lose with a smile what you’ll long for
with tears,
When sundered afar by the silence of years.
May, 1913. D.
•THE DAY.
What have I done to-day—
Done with the hours that God has given?
How they have slipped away!
One by one winging back to heaven,
Like incense wreaths that at even rise,
Through the still air to the starlit skies.
This morning I walked abroad,
When the pearly mists were still lying asleep,
And the dewdrops spangled the sward,
Like tears that the dreaming mists might
weep,
Weep that at dawn they must vanish away,
And share not the joy of the coming day.
Then the sun peeped over the hill,
And laughed as he melted the mist with his
beam;
And the skylark rose with a trill
Of song as pure as the voice of the stream,
And gladdened her heart in an upward flight,
Drinking the joy of returning light.
And I walked in the fields at noon,
And life was flowing more fully and deep,
With a quiet and peaceful tune,
Like reapers that sing in the fields as they
reap,
And bind the sheaves that glow in the sun,
Happy in labour and work well done.
So life flowed on through the day,
Like the stream that flowed by the wheel of
the mill;
And the long hours dreamed away,
Till the sun set over the western hill;
And the shadows fell from the tall elm trees,
And all was quietness and rest and ease.
And the twilight deepened to dark,
As the stars twinkled out in the blue of the
sky;
And hushed was the voice of the lark,
As she sought her nest in the tussock dry;
And the flowers closed up their petals all
round,
And the streamlet flowed with a stiller sound.
This have I done to-day,
I have walked in the fields at dawn, noon-
tide, and eve,
I have joyed with the stream in its play,


I have soared with the lark; and have striven
to weave
In this song of the Spring the impress of the
joy
Of living, that nothing but death can destroy.
August, 1913. J. D. Burns.
SONGS OF EVENING.
When the day is ended,
And in glory splendid
Sinks the sun in glowing tints of purple, red,
and gold,
Then the dark down-creeping,
Soon the earth is sleeping,
And through ways of thought I wander back
to dreams of old.
Then when stars are gleaming,
Comes the night-breeze streaming,
Gliding with its perfumed breath the dreaming
earth along;
From the far years bringing
Echoes faint of singing,
Floating down forgotten paths with laughter
in the song.
Youth is song and laughter,
Sorrow, coming after,
Reaves the song of all its joy, the laughter
brings to tears;
Hope will change to yearning,
Bitter lessons learning
Of the flowers that droop and fade, the thorns
that cruelly pierce.
Yet, through pain and sorrow
Look we for a morrow,
That shall break with new-born joy, fulfilling
dreams of old,
Blinded, scarcely knowing
That the fires then glowing
Now have died away, and left but ashes grey
and cold.
Faded are the roses
When the long day closes,
Yet a moment they revive at evenings first
chill breath.
So, when life is ending.
Like faint echoes blending,
Drift the half-heard songs of youth around the
wings of Death.
December, 1913.
COCK-CROW.
Through frosty air the moon looks down
Upon the silent, sleeping town;
The roofs are white
With silver light,
The chimney-stacks are sombre brown.
The night is still, but for the prowl
Of lurking cats, and watchdog’s howl;
And from the tower
The ghostly hour
Is hooted by the lonely owl.
But sudden, like a clarion call,
Rings out the cock-crow loud o’er all;
From far and near
Tis answered clear
By echoing notes from barn and stall.
And so the clamour rises high,
Strikes to the cold stars of the sky;
Then through the grey,
It dies away;
The moon pales, for the dawn is nigh.
May, 1914. J- D. Burns.
“THE GENTLE LADY.”
The gentle lady comes to me
When all the lights are dim,
When o’er the shadowy hill appears
The big moon’s yellow rim,
When beetles flit and shrilly sounds
The cricket’s evening hymn.
0 gentle lady, come to-night,
The earth is rapt and still;
The stars are leaning from the sky,
Upon the earth, until
They seem to whisper tender dreams
To sleeping plain and hill.
Light-footed breezes are abroad,
Their hands caressing mine,
1 feel their breath upon my brow,
’Tis cool with scent of pine;
But, gentle lady, dear, their touch
Is not so soft as thine.
The gentle lady comes to me,
She comes without a sound,
She wears a robe of softest grey,
That shadows cling around;
As evening wears her gown of dark,
So is my lady gowned.
And while the great moon rises slow
Into the star-strewn sky,
With her beside me, I forget
The world, and by and by
We wander far from world and stars,
My lady dear and I.
Beyond the world, beyond the stars,
That silent vigil keep,
We wander to our Land of Dreams,
And weary eyelids steep
In gentle dews of slumber, —I
And my dear lady—Sleep.
December, 1914. J. D. Burns,
THE CALL OF ROMANCE.
They followed afar by sun and star,
By ways of storm and sea,
The call they heard, the whispered word,
“Arise and follow me.”
Longing and love for the sea and sky,
Ready to follow and find or die,
Roused in their hearts to make reply,
“We come, we follow thee.”


By drift and dark, by gleam and spark,
By ocean beach and bar,
The hurtling blast that swept them past
Sang loud in shroud and spar—
Challenging call on the sea-wind blown,
Joyous and clear as a trumpet tone,
Leading by courses and ways unknown
To the ends of the earth afar.
By north and south, by fog and drouth,
Their storm-vex’d flag they flew;
The frozen seas, the tropic breeze,
Their keels and canvas knew,
Daring it all with a restless pride,
Though the way was long, and the ocean
wide,
They heard the call, and followed and died,
To their heart’s own longing true.
And whether they go by flake and floe,
And dancing Northern light,
Or sail at ease in Southern seas,
By palm-girt beaches white,
They follow the call of old Romance,
They follow the lights that drift and dance,
They spread their sails to the winds of chance,
And steer by the stars of night.

BEYOND.
I never see a smooth hillside
Between me and the sky,
Where the great white clouds sweep on the
wind,
Like galleons sailing by;—
I never see the broad, bare hills,
But I weave my fancies fond,
Of what lies on the other side,
And what may lie beyond.
Sometimes I think I shall look down
On a wide, sweeping plain,
With reapers working far below,
And harvesting the grain;
And on the distant, smoky verge
Of the plain, great cities lie,
And beyond the cities spreads the sea,
And beyond the sea the sky.
I never see the brow of man
That’s marked with lines of care,
But I fall to wondering in my heart
What secret sorrow’s there;
And I never see a woman’s face,
Sweet, sad, and framed in grey,
But I’m wondering will her boy return—
Her boy that’s far away.
May, 1915. J. D. Burns.
TO A FRIEND
Remember me when thou art old
And Time has turned thy locks of gold
To grey;
When thou dost feel life’s waning star
Fast gliding to the silent bar,
Decay.
Remember me shoulds’t thou recall
Thy glad and happy moments all
In joy;
When in our gladsome childhood’s day
I sang and played the hours away,
A boy.
Remember me, when now burns low
The flame of hope that flushed thy brow
In youth;
That hope which even in darkest hour
Inspired to seek earth’s richest, dower,
The Truth.
Remember me! Remember me!
Keep me in mind that I may be
Content:
So will youth pass to mellow age
And friendship still our heart engage
Unspent.

THE BAGPIPES.
Once, long ago, sweet Music gave
To every land its proper note,
The morning thrill of wild bird’s throat
And strains that at still even float
About the sobbing wave.
She took; and touched with heavenly fire
The flute, the organ, and the lyre,
That she might sing her heart’s desire
By every shore the wild seas lave.
To every land she gave its song;
To some a honeyed melody,
To some a sobbing threnody,
To some the rolling majesty
Of organ pealing strong.
Yet in those misty days of yore
To Caledonia’s rock-bound shore
No song the storm-mocked surges bore
On windy echoes floating long.
Then Music took the pipes and gave
The sighing in the wild wind’s breath,
The murmur in the heart that saith,
“To victory or glorious death!
To triumph or the grave!”
And faintly first that shrill refrain,
And louder now o’er hill and plain,
It rose triumphant till it came
To every shore the wild seas lave.
August, 1917. I.R.M.
I MAY BE WRONG.
I may be wrong,
But sometimes in the moaning of the wind
I catch a tune that lingers in my mind,
And makes me feel that there must be behind
Some snatch of song.
I may be wrong,
But in the glory of the setting sun
I see a picture, where the colours run
In perfect harmony, of work well done,
Vivid and strong.


I may be wrong,
But in the radiance of a happy face
A chronicle I read, and there I trace
Him who undaunted runs his appointed race,
Passing along.

TWILIGHT DREAMS.
Away in the dim blue mountains,
Away in the crimson west,
Where the world is washed in the fountains
Of the Islands of the Blest.
Where the golden cloud-drifts hover
O’er the hamlet on the hill,
And night drops her dreamy cover
O’er earth—and the world is still.
The stars through the cloud mists beckon,
The wind in the tree-top sighs;
And I long to be there ’mid the mountains,
With the stars —and the crimson skies.
Some day I will rise with the morning,
And walk all the long days through;
And, perhaps, in some silver dawning,
I will come to those hills of blue.

TREASURE TROVE.
The days of old are long gone by,
But ’neath the spot where once they shone,
The sunken galleons rotting lie,
And the dead men groan that a man must die,
While the world is passing on.
What lands forgotten must you know,
Long-vanished towns and ancient ports!
You link us with the long-ago,
With sunset isles that seamen know,
And Colchis of the Argonauts.
Long gone the times of life and strain;
The sea-things claim the rotted oak;
And are you happy where you’ve lain,
Or do you long to feel again
The swirl of the white sea-smoke?
And are the dim-lit ocean caves
The home of ye who sailed the seas ?
Or do your spirits from the waves
Rise up like ghosts from midnight graves,
And fly before the breeze?
For us who sail the furthest main,
Across the swirling tides of night,
Your rotted oak is sound again,
And the dead men haul on rope and chain
In the glare of a ghostly light.
Sail out, sail out beyond the bars
That irk the realm of circumstance,
Spread wide, amid the windy stars,
The glory of your phantom spars,
The banners of Romance.
Sail from dim ports with white shrouds furled,
Beyond Earth’s furthest ocean streams,
Sail out like glowing cinders swirled
Across the margent of the world,
To anchor in the land of dreams.
December, 1918. I.R.M.
A DREAM.
Where the sombre brown of the Autumn dale
Is tinged with crimson and gold,
Where the magpie carols her joyous tale
Of love that will never grow old,
Oh, far from the crowds by murmuring
streams,
Where the winds have harmony wrought,
You came to me there, O love of my dreams,
On the wings of a dreamer’s thought.
Where the tree-tops sway with the zephyr
breeze
To the tune of the gurgling spring,
Where over the boom of the distant seas
The echoes of dreamland ring,
You came in the robe of the Autumn sky,
In a shower of her leafy tears,
You came in the peace of the wind’s soft
sigh,
In the joy of a thousand years.
Where the fading light of the woodland glen
Encircles in shadowy gloom,
O love of my dreams, you fled from me then
In the wake of the rising moon.
But come again, for the winds are still,
And the skies are cold and grey;
Come, for the cowslips die on the hill,
And the roses fade away; .
Come where the sound of your voice shall
thrill,
Come, love of my dreams, and stay.

FANTASY.
Now the evening star is high,
And the wind is round the moon;
Here beneath the open sky,
Let me dream: for dreams die soon,
Ah, too soon!
Here may never more be seen
Flowers that spring where nymphs have
lain;
Pan may never haunt the green,
Nor Diana, with her train,
Come again.
But to-night the waters glance
Cool and fair beneath the moon,
And the naiads weave their dance,
While I dream: for dreams die soon,
Ah, too soon!

ROMANCE.
Beyond the hills that flame with dawn,
Beyond the Orient sky,
Where woodland Pan soft winds his horn,
There is a land where I was born,
Where I would lie.
Bloom-laden breezes wake its trees
To sylvan melody;
Sweet zephyrs from blue Cypriot seas
And from the marble Cyclades,
Or Arcadie.


It lies by sapphire seas caressed,
And bards would call it still
A lost Atlantis of the west,
The fabled Islands of the Blest,
Or Hy-brasil.
But when the wind blows wooingly,
And white the hill-mists dance,
I sail a silver Argosie
To that far-off Elysian key
To old Romance

GOD LIVES!
Here had the armies passed: a smoking wreck
Told of a life and home of former days.
Spring now had reign—in other years the bees
Droned soft from honey-laden flowers to hive,
And all along the path grew lavender.
But Fire’s black hands had seized this pleasant
home,
And banished far life, happiness and joy.
The walls remained, dark-smirched by trails of
smoke; —
Giants had laid their grimy fingers there,
It seemed. Within those tragic walls of stone
Black ruin—here a reeking, awful mass,
A ghastly medley, out of which the wind
Drew pityingly a veiling grey ash-film;
A place of terror and despair, to make
Man’s thoughts turn to his Maker and search
out
The purpose of our life, if such can be
Beneath His eyes . . . And yet upon the wall
A blackbird sang his morning praise to Him!

MUSCOVY DUCKS.
They dibbled in grass and mud with yellow
beaks,
They hissed, and waddled with turned-in toes,
and sat,
And wagged their tails, and jerked their heads
for flies.
Their feathers were dirty-white, their eyes were
round,
And blue, pale blue, placidly blue as the sky
In spring when the first clear cloudless day
comes fresh
From a bath of winter rain. Stolid and solemn,
Laughable, lovable, calm as the moon,
They squatted around. A rumble of wheels
in the street
Where a cart jerked over the stones. Their
heads went up,
Turned, and the sunlight flashed on their eyes.
They glowed
Red, scarlet; the placid blue was changed
To livid fire, brighter than furnace coals,
Shining like rubies. So have I seen a tree,
Gaunt and grey, lit with the setting sun,
Each jagged twig, turned to a spurt of flame.
So have I seen, mid rotting leaves and sticks
And ragged grass, a yellow orchid shine,
And brown was changed to gold. So have I
seen
A gaunt old woman’s face, wrinkled, ugly,
Change with a light of love when a baby boy
Stretched out its arms to her. So some power,
Latent in all things, flashes forth at times
And leaves a haunting glory where it shone.

IMPERFECTIONS.
Were life and love and earthly living things
Wrought in perfection, would all joy be ours?
Ah, ’tis tears that brighten laughter, ’tis the
night
That brings the silvery dawn, and sweeter far
Is that one burst of sun in cloudy skies,
Starting the vexed trees to quietness
Amid the storm; aye, lovelier smells the rose
In desert places blooming,—Spring’s a jewel
Set in chill Winter’s foil, and ah! man’s heart
Shows more divine when his one spark of
Heaven
Shines thro’ the dark of this Mortality.

DEATH—OR LIFE?
A bud that bloomed upon the hill
And blushed to greet the dawn,
As youthful beauty ever will
Before the eyes of morn—
He saw, admired, and passed it by,
To wither, fade, and die.
A seed sown in the stony soil
Will not take root and live;
The sower threw it in his toil
Where nought might nurture give.
He left it, heedless of its cry,
To wither, fade, and die.
A single golden autumn leaf
Still hangs upon the wall;
The creeper, bare and cold with grief,
Will shortly let it fall,
To rest beneath the winter sky,
To wither, fade and die.
A thought within a human heart
Is prison’d in the brain,
The tongue is warden of our art
To free our joy and pain;
If it shall fail, our thought must He
To wither, fade, and die.

CAPTIVITY.
Fair bird so glad, in palest primrose clad,
’Tis spring with thee;
Thy dress no winter shows, thy music flows
In unstayed melody.
Free through the azure heavens thy way thou
wing’st,
Joying in flight;
And now imprisoned in thy cage thou sing’st
With heart so light.
Like thee, my soul is caged in its aspiring
In bars so strong,
But not like thee so joyfully retiring
Or sweet of song.

They who would boldly burst the open portal
Find then the world too small;
Their aims and wills are boundless and im-
mortal,
And find no rest at all.

A SOLDIER’S PRAYER BEFORE
BATTLE.
I do not ask of Thee, O Lord,
My future life to see,
A tighter grip upon my sword,
And that I leave to Thee.
If it be Thy will that I should fall,
Forbid that I should sigh;
I ask of Thee a favour small;
O Lord, help me to die.

THEN AND AFTER.
I.
’Twas but a child, that wearied by his play
Had sought his mother, in her ear
Whispering the story of the day
Of all his small delights and needless fear—
Delightful games that he had made,
And with his puppy friend had played,
And solemn romps upon the lawn;
And with repentant downcast eyes he
showed
The jumper he had torn,
Begged for forgiveness—and his young face
glowed
When it was granted, like a summer morn.
Soon he was ready, and his shining face
Was pure and sweet as some November bloom;
He knelt and lisped a prayer with childish
grace,
Knelt at his mother’s knee in her still room;
And then he nestled into bed,
Calm and content as angels from the skies.
And with a last good-night from drowsy
eyes:
“Sing me to sleep,” he said.
11.
An old, old man, bowed by the weight of years,
And by his toil unceasing tired
And wearied of his many cares —
Still pleased to hear of days when he was
fired
To grapple bravely with the world’s affairs!
The joy of victory he knew,
Of scaling the steep, stubborn crags of life;
And from the summit to his comrades true,
He had stooped down to aid them in the strife,
Not dazzled by the glory new.
Now all was past, and the dim memory
Alone remained; his hair and beard of grey
Seemed like the relics of a bygone day.
His children crowded round the couch where he
Did last repose his hoary head.
Sudden his eyes flashed with celestial fire;
He smiled a sad farewell: “The angel choir
Sing me to sleep!” he said.

THESE LIVE.
“These pass,” the Angel said, and showed me
where
All evil things were dead, all tears and pain
And ugliness; “and these live blossoming
That ye thought dead—the rose that thickening
night
Saw droop, the faint star in the eastern sky,
The smile in sorrow, all the joy of sun,
The skies illimitable, bird on wing,
And waters running free and mirroring
The smiling morn—all these shall live,” he
said.
December, 1925. Adon.
WHEN I SHALL DIE—
When I shall die, strew not above my head
Flowers, to show you loved me long ago;
Who will remember that they once were red,
When they lie withered, and their colours go?
Give me as flowers all your thoughts of me,
While yet I live, to see their red and gold;
Cherish them kindly, hold them tenderly,
Oh! I shall love them; they shall not grow
old!
And when I die, you have them back as flowers,
Blossoms that shall not wither with the years,
Fragrant with odours born of happy hours,
Filling your eyes with joy, and then with
tears.
But should your thoughts nothing of gladness
have,
Take them, as flowers, from gardens where
they lie,
And with a light hand lay them on my grave—
God grant that with the flowers they shall
die!

THE CRUSADER.
Down by the wall where the violet was Maying,
Flushed was her cheek at the word he was
saying; _
Rich was the light there, for Day seemed
staying
Wistfully to watch them, down by the wall.
Now a great Orient sunset is heaping
Gold on the sand where her soldier is sleeping.
Hugh fell at Acre; and Mary is keeping
Tryst with a memory down by the wall.

WHEN DEATH SHALL COME.
When Death shall come and beckon me away,
How shall we part, O meadowlands forlorn,
And you, O thrushes, who at break of day
With your glad carols welcome in the morn.
How shall we part at last, think you, who
vowed
To guard alike the inviolable trust?
For unto Death man’s head must soon be bowed,
And two can never love when one is dust.


Yet you, O laughing meadows, you have won
Life that’s eternal—ah, the golden sheaves
And little secret places where the sun
Comes struggling through between the hazel
leaves!
And you, O heartless, you will still embower,
For later hearts, that joy we gazed upon.
We will not grudge them their sweet passing
hour,
They, too, will kiss your hand and then be
gone.
Yet you were very lovely when I came,
Peaceful and secretive, I followed slow
Into your woods with halting steps and lame,
Watching the leaf-green darkness round me
grow.
Into the depths of many a magic wood
I followed wandering, till at last there grew
A glory all about me as I stood,
And then I knew I’d found the heart of you.
So when Death comes, how should I have it be,
Out of the night that I might slip away
Into the Last Land swiftly, secretly
Nor even bid a last farewell to Day?
Or should he give me one short hour to live,
One crowded hour to rack your precious
store,
Taste all the pleasures that the light can give,
Knowing that I shall never taste them more?
It matters not, for then I shall have won
The peerless, the imperishable boon,
Have drawn my gladness from the golden sun,
And sung to the great harmony of noon.
But ah, the gloom of little secret ways
That creep, moss-cloaked, beneath the mur-
muring trees,
And fragrant copses where the bluebells gaze
And nod and whisper in the noonday breeze.
May, 1927. G.W.H.
WHEN TWICE FIVE HUNDRED YEARS.
When twice five hundred years have gone,
And all our proudest pomps and shows
Are lesser than the dust that blows
Along the streets of Babylon,
When we have lost the heavenly fire,
And hearts that stirred to Beauty’s call
Are stilled beneath Death’s timeless thrall,
Even as Nineveh and Tyre,
Perchance some soft-lipped Springtide breeze
That wakes the laughing daffodils
And roams across the downs and fills
The air with age-old litanies,
Will whisper as it wanders by,
Some song our hearts could ne’er forget,
And stir the dust that even yet
Will leap to that old prophecy,
And feel the sum of human joy,
That with the ages creeps along
And with imperishable song
Rebuild the towers of ancient Troy!
August, 1927. G.W.H.
GOD.
For Shakespeare He was throbbing life; for
Keats
The swooning beauty of the senses soft,
While Shelley found Him in the life that beats
Through all the world, and radiant mounts aloft.
And though I scoffed, He gently came to me
When greedy Death had rung his grating knell,
Upon a softly solemn melody,
And acquiescence o’er my spirit fell.

KNOWLEDGE.
I know the moon is lustreless and cold,
And that the whirling stars far, far away
Are wandering ever through the infinite night
Lonely and comfortless. I know the day
Follows the night in mute and governed change,
And that the heavens are very still and vast.
There was a time—but long since it is past,
When all the earth was clothed in friendly light,
Heaven was a canopy of shadows wrought,
Earth a rich market, wonderful and wide,
And day by day more eagerly I sought
To see God light his lamps at even tide.
August, 1927. G.W.H.
MOODS OF NATURE.
There is ever a kiss for the smarting cheek,
When friends have failed in need;
There is ever a sob in the rustling breeze
To sorrow with hearts that bleed.
When a Presence unseen in thy mind is felt,
The heavens commune with thee:
When thy friends are few, there are lonely
clouds
That joy in liberty.
When the soul o’erflows with its unbound joy,
There’s ever a dancing flower,
And a sparkle of sky that will laugh away
Through every laughing hour.
But if anger has seized thee with ruthless gust,
Recall the storm that parts
All the waves of the sea and behind it leaves
Disaster—broken hearts.
May, 1929. A.P.F.
IN MEMORIAM.
There is a consolation deeper than
The depths of grief. Among us, every man
But tastes the golden chalice of the clime
Long called Eternity. A fleeting time
We pass in high endeavour ’gainst the clay
That names us; but ’tis one swift Winter’s day
Beside the promises of endless Spring,
That like dim, dancing lights before us, bring
The mind and flesh to bear upon the goal
That lures far on the uncontrolled soul.
And when the dust is shaken from our feet,
We, glad as welcome guests, go on to meet,
Through vales of morning bathed in silver
thought,
The beaming beacon we have long time sought.


There is achievement in a dying breath,
There is a victory in noble death,
There is a glory that we cannot speak
In passing happy to the Life we seek;
When, like a spark that leaves its smoky bars,
A brightness soars to join the sister stars.

THE CHILDREN OF EDEN.
The children of Eden
Played by the running stream,
They played with the pebbles and the sand.
For the children of Eden
The hot sun’s pleasant beam
Shone happily and bright on every hand.
They played in the stream,
In its water cool and beautiful;
They rested on its edges smooth and green.
And their joy did seem
Spontaneous and beautiful,
By the lilies and the water fresh and clean.
The children of Eden
Grew tired of the waterfall,
The lilies and the reeds along the shore.
The voice of Eden,
Their laughter and happy call,
By the gentle running stream were heard no
more.
But the stream of Eden
Ran on as prettily.
Near the waterfall the lilies bloomed upon.
When the children of Eden
Left the river foolishly,
Their innocence and happiness were gone.
December, 1930. C.T.
DISAPPOINTMENT.
You who have lived for something
To find that something gone,
Who have felt like an old bent cripple
With no staff to lean upon;
Who have rested your hopes on an altar
Your aims, your ambitions, desires,
And have found them burnt and blackened,
When you’ve raked them out of the fires.
Then you, like me, will be stronger,
Will feel yourself more of a man,
For the rough, sharp stones of the roadway
Are part of the Master’s plan.

LIFE.
Of all the lives you could offer, the one I’d like
to try
Is a porter’s on a platform, where Life is
passing by,
Where streams of people, fresh or hot, pour past
you through the gate
The thin man in a hurry, the fat content to wait.
The powdered little office girls, clad in silken
hose,
Rushing home to supper, then to cinemas and
shows.
And the tired suburban mother, worn out from
tramping stores,
With three grubby children holding sweets in
little grubby paws.
The man who works in open air, works with
spade and pick,
The factory man, with parchment face, shivering
and sick.
The commercial traveller, wooden-face, resigned
to his dire fate,
Who hears all day that hopeless sound, the bang
of a shutting gate,
And the business man with attache case, fat
and so secure,
Who thinks he knows the joy of life, although
he is not sure.
Then the racing tout, the criminal, they who
live with brains,
With misshapen minds, and dexterous hands,
and prison for their pains.
And then kiddies, burnt and happy, buckets and
spades in hand,
Home with memories of laughing waves, and
sandals full of sand.
Oh! of all the lives you could offer me, the
one I’d like to try
Is a porter’s on a platform, for there—Oh! the
universe goes by!
December, 1931. D.R.McN.
SPORT.
A man came over the hillside,
Over the hill, over the hill.
The air was fresh and sweet with dampness—
A man came over the hill.
Away in the air I hear a cry,
“Tally ho! tally ho!” growing closer and closer,
And over the hill comes Reynard the fox,
Dodging the brambles,
Brushing the grasses,
Through bushes he scrambles,
Hedges he passes;
His tongue is lolling and white and red,
His eye is wild; he will soon be dead.
Then the hounds, then the huntsmen,
Pass me fast;
They take the water, and one man falls,
Another laughs, and gaily calls.
And the fox is lagging,
His steps are sagging;
The hounds are on him—he turns round
snarling,
A baying, a screaming, a brush for a lady;
A dead fox lying,
And a man sighing.
August, 1932. D.R.McN.
HOMEWARD BOUND—YACHTING.
The clean bow cleaves the billows and breaks
them into spray,
The wind whines through the cordage as we
speed upon our way,
And the running lights are painting their
colours on the foam.


The helmsman’s singing dreamily as he keeps
her head towards home,
While the dull light from the binnacle shines
on his sea-wet face,
The reef points drum upon the main as she
heels and makes the pace,
Then it’s “Forrard sheet the staysail for she
isn’t drawing well!”
And the sharp metallic clang as the watch
sounds on the bell,
The phosphor-bells gleam in the wake, a cloud
blots out the moon,
She yaws, then thunders on again, the blocks
shake on the boom.
December, 1932. F.W.M.
WHEN I AM DEAD.
I want no heavenly throne when I am dead,
Nor rich-gemmed diadem upon my head;
I am afraid of unfamiliar wings
And the too-great magnificence that flings
Open the portals of an austere hall,
Where before God Unapproachable I fall.
Give me no splendour of undreamt-of sound,
Majestic, wherewith Heaven echoes round.
Let there be homeliness, and Christ who died;
The understanding Friend they crucified;
Let there be quiet of earthly evenings,
The peace the beauty of the sunset brings.
Let me see happy faces that I know,
Smiling and quietly jesting as below,
Let there be flowers and trees, and stars above,
A beauty harmonized by holy love.
These are the lovely things that make earth fair,
O Lord, grant them instead of splendour there,
And if I sin in wanting what is here,
Forgive me, for Thine earthly gifts are dear.
May, 1933. J.P.




Lyrics of Nature
’NEATH SOUTHERN SKIES.
This is the land of evergreen trees,
Where the boughs sigh soft in the passing
breeze,
Where every breath has a charm to please,
And every bird has a song;
Where the streamlet sparkles through silent
glades,
Through the light of sun and the gloom of
shades,
And a new flower opens for each that fades,
To blossom the whole day long;
And wooded vales where the wattles blow,
And the myrtles bloom like sifted snow.
’Mid the wild tree-fern and the bracken low,
Where the bell-bird welcomes dawn
With many a note of golden chime,
Where wreaths of the wild clematis climb
From tree to tree, and the summertime
On the swallow’s wing is borne;
Where the green acacia scattered with flowers
Weaves an emerald network of balmy bowers,
Where the shadows are deep in the noontide
hours,
And the breeze rustles down through the glade,
And glides through the woods with a slumb’rous
tune,
With the mists of the morn and the languor
of noon,
And plays in the night with the beams of the
moon,
Which steal through the bulrushes’ shade,
Where the bittern moans in the desolate mere,
■And the wild owl flits through the darkness
drear,
Where the curlew’s wail is shrill and clear
In the depths of the silent night;
Where the wild black swan in the evening
cries
To the earth as it cleaves the starry skies,
Till its mournful dirge in the distance dies
With the sound of its ceaseless flight.
October, 1910. B. C. Thomson.
HOLIDAY SONG.
Oh, for the rivers whose rustling reeds
In the wavelets sigh and sway,
Where the long grass sparkles with dewy
beads,
In the sun’s unclouded ray;
Till the day recedes,
And the weary meads
In darkness are hidden away.
Oh for the dales where the magpie sings,
And softly blows the breeze
With rarest perfume laden, and brings
From bowers of clustered trees
The murmurings
Of many wings,
And the drowsy humming of bees.
And oh, for the end of the long, long year,
When Time will fulfil our dreams,
When we all may go where the skies are clear,
And the restless ocean gleams;
Yes, the time is near,
When we all may hear
The gurgle of mountain streams.
December, 1910. B. C. Thomson.
THE LAMENT OF THE WINDS.
I.
Oh, grey is the sky, for Autumn is dead;
Come, musical Wind of the West,
In a garland of red
Encircle his head,
And touch thy sad harp o’er the place of
his rest;
For the forests are lone,
And the bare limbs moan
For the King of the golden hours;
Oh, tenderly throw
On the grave below
The last of his lingering flowers.
11.
Oh, Autumn is dead; and heavy and drear
The winds of heaven follow the bier,
With the throbbing beat
Of moving feet
That follow slow in the funeral train, to the
place of his last retreat;
And the mourners come
With muffled drum,
And the dirges roll
For the passing soul
And the clay in its winding sheet.
HI.
Oh, Autumn is dead, and the scudding cloud
sweeps over the frosty moon;
And the swollen rivers are sighing loud;
But all will be quiet soon.
And the groaning trees will be still anon,
For Autumn is dead and the mourners are
gone
Back to their dwellings at last;
They have laid him deep
In the earth to sleep,
And over his head the glow-worms creep
’Mid the leaves of the mouldering past.
IV.
Oh, Winter is here, and the cold earth grieves
At the chill of his pitiless breath,
For he binds in his sheaves
The desolate leaves,
And gathers them into the harvest of death;
Come, wild South gale,
With the clash of hail,
And scatter thy bitterest showers;
Oh, wail a sad dirge
In thine ocean surge,
And shriek in thy haunted towers.
July, 1912. B. C. Thomson.


THE AUSTRALIAN BUSH.
From along the flowing river, where the
kookaburra dwells,
Where the tall blue-gums are standing, comes
the sound of silver bells;
There the bell-bird tinkles gaily, and the
magpie’s song is heard,
While amid the tree-ferns glancing may be
seen the lyre bird.
High upon the timbered hill-top, overrun with
bracken fern,
Tower the messmate and the blackbutt, scarred
with many an ancient burn;
There the ’possums nest in hollows, and the
foxes make their lairs,
There the night air echoes weirdly with the
call of native bears.
Across the plain far stretching, where roams
the kangaroo,
Where with screeching cry discordant flies the
crested cockatoo;
There with plaintive calls at even, wheel the
plovers in their flight,
And we hear the bittern booming at the com-
ing of the night.
From the mountains, hills and valleys, from the
rivers, lakes and falls,
My heart responds as Nature with her thous-
and voices calls;
In this land of golden wattle, through the
sweet musk-scented air,
And the wide untrodden pathways of Aus-
tralia’s bushland fair.
May, 1916. Bromwyn.
MORNING IN SUMMER.
The dawn comes loitering o’er the western
hills,
Stooping and picking flowers on her way;
Lingering awhile to catch the thousand thrills
And eddies, as the bird’s song greets the
day,
Peering to see, in other eastern skies, the
stars grow grey.
The clambering roses breathe in perfumed
sighs,
The whispering laurels bid her stay awhile;
She blows them dewy kisses ere she flies
The shadowy western billows to beguile,
And gladden waiting meadows with a smile.
She passes, and flowers spring upon her way,
Before her presence a faint laughing breeze
Ripples the gold upon the azure bay;
She dances o’er the edge o’ the morning
seas,
As day strides on, majestic, through the trees.
May, 1918. I.R.M.
THE WATERFALL.
I know a splashing waterfall
That dances down a mountain vale,
With rushing feet, past myrtles tall
And sassafras, where bell-birds call
And bush-owls wail.
The fairy rainbows bridge the air,
’Twixt valley wall and wall serene,
Two mossy crags, with maidenhair,
That clings in niches here and there,
And staghorn green.
I love its moss banks, cool and sweet,
By straggling sunbeams softly lit,
And often in the city’s heat,
Amid the swirl of hurrying feet,
I dream of it.
August, 1918. R.K.-C.
THE PLACE WHERE I WOULD LIE.
Make me a grave that the winds sigh over,
In the western track of the setting sun,
Near the beating heart of the kind Bush
Mother;
There may I rest when the day is done,
Hearing the birds call, one to another,
Watching the stars fade, one by one.
Lay me down in the shadows playing
Under the dreaming gums at noon,
Hearing the winds of Summer straying
Deep in the reeds of the still lagoon,
Hearing the faery pipers playing,
Faint, from the meadows under the moon.
Lulled by the wash of the sleepy river,
Robed in shadows and dancing light;
Waking to hear the fern-fronds quiver
In the evening breeze ere the moon is bright;
There may I lie, to dream for ever,
In the quiet arms of the Bushland Night.
December, 1918. I.R.M.
FROM DUSK TO DAWN.
When the sunset’s fading crimson
Slowly dies away at last,
And the creeping purple twilight
Shows another day is past.
When the birds are slow returning
To their nests among the leaves,
And the winds begin to whimper
Lullabies throughout the trees.
While the twilight deepens darkly,
Far above, like diamonds bright,
Crystal stars from out the purple
Glint their radiance to the night;
There’s a moaning in the branches,
As a shuddering breeze goes by,
Like the rustle of Death’s garments,
As he sweeps across the sky.
Far down the dim dark vista
Spreads a molten golden glow
And the outlines of the tree trunks
Dimly first, then clearer show.
Till Diana o’er the tree tops
Wings her bright and glittering way,
And the mysteries of the forest
Bend beneath her silvern sway.
With the dawn there comes a rustle —
Ghostly music in the trees —
And the freshness of the morning
Steals by, wafted on the breeze.
May, 1919. Meldon.


“THE RED GODS.”
When the days are drunk with Summer and
the heat-waves reel and shimmer,
When the stranded reed-beds rustle where
the creeks are running low,
Then the Red Bush Gods awaken, and they call
us from the woodland,
And the wondrous sunlit spaces of the lands
where we would go.
We have drunk the shivered moonlight in the
river after sunset,
When the stars are all a-glimmer and the grey
night breezes blow;
We have heard the mopoke calling from the
wonder of the forest;
And the sleeping lust of Summer bids our
hearts arise and go.
We must leave the painted splendours and the
pageantry of cities;
Honey-sweet across the sunlight in the
brazen noon-day glow,
We can hear the Bush Gods calling from the
grey-blue mountain hazes,
And the crimson Summer kingdoms where
our hearts must rise and go.
May, 1919. I.R.M.
“NIGHT.”
Now sinks the sun to his cloud-curtain’d rest,
And homing doves soft coo,
While the fond mother lulls her babe to sleep,
And forth from out the blue
The glittering stars so bright,
Proclaim the approach of night,
And Cynthia, with her silvery smile,
Begins to show her light.
Now blushing flowers, with petals tightly closed,
Down droop their dainty heads,
And fearful of the dark and whispering shades,
The squirrels seek their beds,
And all the stars so bright,
Proclaim the reign of night,
While Cynthia, with her silvery smile,
Floods all earth with her light.
And now the plaintive owl, with sounding cry,
Disturbs the silent night,
And ’mid the murky gloom that palls around,
The bat wings fitful flight,
And all the stars so bright,
Are clouded out of sight,
While Cynthia hides her fickle smile,
And veils from earth her light.
Then stealthily the tawny fox creeps out
To seek his winged prey,
And neighbouring farms he ravages with haste,
Until the break of day,
Until the stars so bright.
No more show forth their light,
And Cynthia flees from us away
Beyond the line of sight.
Thus through the span of one short night we
live,
But to shine forth a space.
And pass away at dawn to other scenes,
While others take our place;
Like glittering stars so bright,
Which shine but in the night,
And Cynthia who, with short-lived smile,
Soon passes from our sight.
May, 1921. . J.G.C.
SWEET IS THE BREATH OF MORN.
From a deep, cool mountain gully,
Where the ferns grow tall and splendid,
And the creek flows almost hidden
By the overarching creepers;
Where above the giant gum trees
Tower to pierce the distant heavens,
Ere the wreathing bluish hazes
Are dispersed by morning sunlight,
Comes the crack of calling whip-bird
Ringing through the forest mazes,
Echoing across the valley,
Sweet and clear as rippling waters.
Vibrant with the joy of living;
And from out a dense-grown thicket
Come the noises of the bushland,
Where a lyre bird is prancing,
Mimicking the laughing jackass,
The cuckoo, the blue wren’s chatter,
While among the ferns and bushes
The cock’s crow, the big saw’s shrieking;
Hop the little tits, whose twitter
Fills the air with soothing music.
There I went when dawn was breaking,
And the air was filled with murmurs
Of the drowsy waking bird life.
Creeping down towards the stream, I
Bathed myself in its cool waters,
And, the warm blood tingling through me,
Watched the rabbit loping homeward
Through the bracken to its burrow.
Then the laughing jackass chorus
Ushered in the new-born daylight,
And the hilltops, touched with glory
By the rising sun’s red fires,
Stretched towards the sapphire heavens,
Where a single cloud was floating,
Steeped in pink where sun-rays touched it,
White as snow where hidden from them.
Then the spirit of the morning
Thrilled me to my inmost being,
And I rose and wended homewards
To the cottage on the hillside —
As I went, the bush sang softly
Songs of youth and hope and gladness.
May, 1922. Quinapalus.
I HEARD THE VOICE OF NIGHT.
I heard the voice of Night come gently down,
So soft and low;
I heard the voice of Night come gently down
Upon the sleepy hill and fields of brown,
And bid the old day go.


I saw the shadows on the terrace wide
Deepen and grow,
And marble stands the loom on either side
All lost the velvet glow as sunlight died
From off the lake below.
I saw the filmy mist fall on the sea
And ripples die,
And night came sweeping down so soundlessly,
And countless stars came out and blinked at me,
Beneath a purple sky.
She crept beneath the cloistered walls and ways
So quietly;
All night her mantle on the garden lay,
And saw the passing of another day
So silently.
She crept into my latticed window wide,
With leaves o’er-grown;
She stirred the curtains frail and peeped inside,
And whispered softly where the brown leaves
died,
And left me all alone.
And thus she wrapped my tired head around
With misty gown,
And with soft cords of sleep my senses bound,
While darkness covered all the golden ground
And fields of brown.

AN OLD LANDSCAPE.
The master coloured in pure tones the dawn,
The misty lake, pearled grass and springtime
flower,
That waved across the fields, the rosy skies
Along the east; he touched the distant hills
With flush of pink—’tis many hundred years
A-gone since then. The master’s hand is dust,
And the sweet music of that dawn is still,
And new Springs blossom. Yet on this
drear eve
To me those long-shut eyes are given to see
Sun, hills, and flowers, the open sky, the blue
And shining waters, all the gathered peace
Till centuries fade and vanish, till old time
Withers as leaves —such is the power of art
To steal from transience one eternal hour.

NATURE LYRIC.
There is enchantment in the kiss of seas
That murmur gently, pass, and then are still.
’Tis beauty, when the Life of Heaven frees
The fresh’ning breeze; the vessel’s timbers thrill
To the touch of the chiding wind; the flying
spume
Is carried, laughs and runs upon the waves.
But oh! the beauty when the storm-clouds loom,
And gather, brooding; and the tempest craves
The spirit of the winds, the lash of rain,
The torment of the sky, heav’n thunder-riven;
And jagged lightning flashes in the train
Of livid shocks contending; thunder-driven,
The waves’ abysmal depth with strident cries
And angry tumult to the gale replies.

POET’S DESPAIR.
Another day has flitted by,
And nothing written (why, oh, why?)
To sing the song of falling rain,
The beauty of its soft refrain
On springing leaf and wattle bloom,
A lyric of the Spring’s perfume.
And nothing said to keep in store
The radiant gems of fairy lore,
The treasures of the golden trees,
The glamour of far hills, the breeze
Stirring the rich autumnal leaves,
That cluster round the friendly eaves.
The wonder of the forest peace,
The beauty of the day’s decease,
The glory of winds in the harvest fields,
The sceptre that the sunset wields,
Are slowly, hardly swept away
In ruthless streams of yesterday,
Nature’s free hand can scatter gold
On land and sea, on glade and fold,
And then enchant the longing mind
With trains of wealth that trail behind.
But who that sees her pass along
Can hope to bind her in a song?

THE VOICES.
Come back, come back to the mountains;
They are music to your soul;
On the topmost heights the silence,
In the depths the torrents roll.
Come back to the sounding echoes
That fill the upper heights;
Come back to the mighty boulders,
The gleam of the morning lights.
Below are the petty mortals,
Here freedom, trackless, vast,
And the lonely cries where the eagles brood,
Out on the stillness cast.
Here there is space unbounded,
The tang of a keener air,
Here there is glory in freedom,
A joy that the spirits share,
Here the clouds on their silver sails
Rest as they roam the sky,
And the mists of the morning cling below,
Where the simple hamlets lie.
Come back, come back to the mountains,
The haunting voice still cries,
Come back to the might and grandeur,
To the calm of their covering skies.

SUMMER’S GIFT.
Why is summer loved by all,
By all those who come to call
At the dwelling of the flowers
Nestling in their verdant bowers
Of the garden’s greenery?
In midst of faery scenery
I could wander all day long,
Mingling with the golden throng
Of calendulas by the trees
Swaying softly in the breeze,


Watching ever creepers crawl
Softly, slowly up the wall.
What is this that now I see
Drowsily nodding to the bee,
That plays and hums around,
Now at the pansies on the ground,
Lifting their little piquant faces
To the heavenly, graceful races
Of the pigeons in the sky?
What is this that I descry
Waiting to receive a kiss
From the daisy’s drooping lips?
One whole month of sweetest bliss—
Then it will die;
But so will I.
So better soon than late;
They have no weary wait
Like mine.
August, 1931. A.P.8.8.
MID-SUMMER.
The air is clogged with sweetness,
And the dipping butterflies
Hover in passing glory o’er the fence.
At the foot of the tree
Broken egg-shells tell of a new birth;
And wagtails dart at me out of the haze,
Zoom, snap at me in fear as I pass,
And wonder if I noticed that forked-in nest.
A buzzing is in the misty, mazy air,
The friendly buzz of friendly nature.
Even the draught horses,
Standing head-to-tail in the line of shade
Thrown by gum, seem half asleep;
They hardly deign to swish
Their burr-entangled tails at the green botflies
Buzzing stickily.
„And the workmen, tired and stiff,
Lie propped against the water-tanks,
Hats tipped over eyes, eyes half-closed
Behind the bobbing corks of fly-nets.
A flock of thirsty cranes
Floats silently on nothing, down from the blue
Of that brilliant sky, to the muddy pond
Down, down,
Till, with a gentle smothered splash
They light on the mud.

AUTUMN LEAVES.
Dead leaves are blown past my window
By an unsinging autumn gale,
Not like the winds of spring and summer
That make sweet music through the trees,
This wind has a despairing wail,
A soul that cries in agony;
Perhaps it is lamenting summer,
The soft balm of the golden sunset,
The benediction of the day,
The calm of the long night, the stir
And wakefulness of morning, the long
Sweet laziness of afternoon.
And all the leaves that are blown past
Have the bewildered look of things
That suffer, ignorant and dumb.
Perhaps they, too, loved summer days,
The languor of the swaying trees,
The warmth that gave a sweet content;
They’re ghosts, I think, of dreams that died,
Dim memories of pain, perhaps,
Or else of lovely things that faded;
A lover’s kiss, the first sweet sigh
That told of wakened love; a thought
The glory of the sunset brought;
A dance; the §weet thing some child said;
A poet’s dream, forgot and fled;
A quick melodious laugh that gave
Brief joy to someone tired and grave;
The inner stirring at the tale
Of an old warrior in his mail;
A child’s gay happiness and pride
At getting something long denied;
The glory of forgotten suns
That stirred the souls of dreamers once;
Soft clouds in the blue summer sky;
—These now are leaves that flutter by.

OCTOBER THOUGHTS IN ENGLAND.
Here there is beauty, beauty always
In the evenings of the autumn days,
In the woods where the red and the golden
leaves
Fall gently down, and the spider weaves
His silver threads; where the rippling river
Glides by smooth rocks and the grasses quiver
In the gentle breeze; where the frightened deer
Moves the branches and flees in fear;
And when the distant church-bells sound
At sunset, everywhere is beauty found.
But ten thousand miles across the sea
Beauty is calling, calling me.
Where a little township sleeps at noon
Under bluest skies, where hangs the moon
Pale in a white isle ’midst a sea
Of blue hills—that’s where I long to be.
There the trout in the water clear
Move lazily: the wattles near
Like trees of gold lean over the stream
With the gums, under which I long to dream.
The glossy magpies fill the dawn
With music, and silver dew spangles the lawn—
The town awakens, wheels rumble—ah me!
That is the place where I’d love to be.
May, 1933. J.D.R.




National Lyrics
FOR ENGLAND.
The bugles of England were blowing o’er the
sea,
As they had called a thousand years, calling
now to me;
They woke me from dreaming in the dawn-
ing of the day,
The bugles of England—and how could I stay?
The banners of England, unfurled across the
sea,
Floating out upon the wind, were beckoning
to me;
Storm-rent and battle-torn, smoke-stained and
grey,
The banners of England—and how could I
stay?
O, England, I heard the cry of those that died
for thee,
Sounding like an organ-voice across the winter
sea;
They lived and died for England, and gladly
went their way—
England, O England, how could I stay?
May, 1915. J. D. Burns,
AUSTRALIAN BATTLE SONG.
(The W. L. Colclough Prize Song).
England! see thy sons unsleeping,
Watch by endless oceans keeping,
While by land the wild winds sweeping
Surge around the fray.
Once again the brave have striven
Where thy banners, battle-riven,
Proudly flaunt the blast of heaven
Over thine array.
See the banners streaming;
See the bright steel gleaming;
Rouse ye all at England’s call,
Blood your trust redeeming;
Where the battle parts asunder,
Tread the yielding foemen under,
Hurl this shout beyond the thunder—
Death or Victory!
On! the embattled hosts dividing
Banners of the storm are gliding,
Bright with lightnings cloud-bestriding,
Pointing vou to war,
Where your strong right hands have smitten,
Runes of blood shall deep be written:
Names of those who died for Britain,
Honoured evermore.
In our island story’s pages
This the cry that down the ages
Rings where fierce the battle rages—
Death or Victory!
Honour, then, the sires that bore ye,
Heroes famed in song and story;
On! nor count the cost to Glory,
Stand for Liberty!
August, 1918. I.R.M.
“THE KINGS OF THE SEA”
Hauberk and cutlass, carronade and bow,
Fishers from the Cinque Ports, the Tamar
and the Tees,
Fought well for England long, long ago,
’Gainst Northman and Castilian and proud
Genoese.
“Iron Duke” and “Great Harry,”
“Victory” and “Queen,”
In fight ne’er did tarry
For fear, so I ween.
Blake kept the narrow seas, Drake swept the
Main,
Howard drummed the Spaniard from the
Lizard to his doom;
Horatio Lord Nelson made the tyrant’s armies
vain,
And paid the price of Admiralty for Eng-
land, Beauty, Home.
Rodney and Collingwood,
Jellicoe and Myngs,
Swayed all the stormy flood,
Bluewater kings.
Barbite and casemate, turret-gun all-steeled,
Seamen from the villages by estuary and
flood,
Hold o’er Mother England their mighty iron-
clad shield
Against the men of Germany all-steeped in
iron and blood.
At Cocos and Dogger Bank,
At Jutland’s victory
Conquered in the ironclad rank
The Kings of the Sea.

THE BATTERY.
There’s a slam of the breech as the case slips
in, and a rattling, clanging jar,
As the shell flies forth with a roaring scream
to its unseen mark afar;
They send it forth, they know not where, on
its mission of death and hate,
But the battery know not whither it goes; they
are tools in the hands of fate.
Afar they see the white smoke clouds as the
shrapnel bursts on high,
But what do they know of the death it brings
in its leaden hail from the sky?
But ’tis not for them to reason here, but only
to feed the maw
Of this ever rapacious lean grey wolf that
knows no Christian law.
They are there with the morning’s earliest light,
they are there at the close of day,
When the battlefield’s noises have sunk to
rest, and its crashes have died away,
Defending their own front lines from the foe
as the weary day drags by,
What matter to them if a man falls there, for
are they not there to die?


The breech is closed and the breech-pin clicks,
and the shell flies forth again,
The gun-crew serve her and wait, for they are
but links in an endless chain;
A man goes down in this bustling strife, and
never a tear is seen,
For his comrades are but waiting their turn
as cogs in the war machine.
So they continue from day to day in the com-
bat’s crash and roar,
Serving the guns as machines, not men, obey-
ing an iron law,
Defending their country and not themselves
in this furnace of smoke and flame,
Fighting for honour, for home, for friends, to
guard their England’s name.
August, 1916. F.B.N.
THEN AND NOW.
The scene’s a western sea-port, in the days
of good Queen Bess,
And everyone’s on holiday to-day,
And all hurry to the shore, and around the
quay they press,
To see the gallant vessels sail away
For another fleet is sailing for the golden
Spanish Main,
And it’s manned with Devon’s hardy sailor-
men;
’Twas for glory and for gain, and to fight the
dogs of Spain,
That Britons left their home and country
then.
’Tis dead of night; with muffled tread they
pass along the street,
These soldiers leaving England for the war;
No crowds are there to cheer them as they
march through rain and sleet;
All is silent, save the icy tempest’s roar,
But although the rain may drench them,
And although the cold may bite,
’Tis with cheerful heart our soldiers sail
away,
For they think of Belgium’s plight, and they
know they fight for Right;
Thus Britain’s sons go forth to war to-day.
December, 1916. J.P.M.
ANZAC.
Out of the dawn I came,
Bathed in battle flame,
Born of the glorious deeds our fathers
wrought of yore,
When, in the blood of men,
Battle’s call thrills again,
Sing I the songs of the days that are no
more.
On shell-swept heights I stood,
Red with the reeking blood,
And raised Australia’s glory beside the
crimsoned sea.
There, o’er our glorious dead,
Deathless when life is sped,
Sing I the songs of the days that are to be.
August, 1917. I.R.M.
THE WAR GOD.
I think I see thee as thou art,
Not tainted with the bloody mire,
But as the Lord of valiant heart,
The cleanser of the earth by fire.
Heroes and sages worship thee,
Whom sacrifice alone adorns ;
Men, blindly groping, may not see
About thy head a crown of thorns.
Strange harmonies we scarce may hear
Rise where our fallen brave have stood,
And bound by all they held most dear,
We stand in nobler brotherhood.
For only they may worship well
Who, freed from meaner hopes and fears,
Have loves more high than Death can quell,
That mount upon the changing years.
Thou standest at thy glowing fire
And cool’st the iron in the blood;
Thou forgest clean of mean desire
The blade of perfect nationhood.
May, 1918. I.R.M.
“THE TOAST.”
What shall ye say of the Lion’s breed,
In peace and war alike renowned,
In lightning sword and eagle speed,
In faith that stood at Runnymede,
Whom victory again hath crowned?
Then here’s a toast to her armies grand,
Come home from her Picard wars,
Of good red wine, to the gallant band
That bled in the ancient cause.
And what shall ye say of the sailors that guard
all the seas in our ships?
The phantom Armadas of England keep pace
with the war-serried fleet,
The salt of the wave in their nostrils, the
spume of the sea on their lips,
The blood of old Viking sea-rovers, that frets
for the old-fashioned grips,
Who watched ’twixt the grey northern is-
lands, till war-grey grew white in the sleet.
Then here’s a toast to the silent arm,
That stood ’twixt the wrath and the land,
A toast to the balm of an after storm calm
While the tide ebbs away from the sand.
What shall ye say of the men that died
By sea and shore, gone west with day,
Whose span ran out with the ebbing tide,
That we might live with our age-old pride
In might and righteousness alway?
Then here’s a toast to the Conqueror, Death—
Pray never he find the English slow —
To the lads that answered His summoning
breath —
Listen and hear what the slayer saith,
“Vanward for ever with Me they go.”
May, 1919. R.K.-C.


GALLIPOLI.
“Some corner of a foreign field that is for-
ever England.”
Now when the earth is drunk with the vint-
age of conquest,
And the wild dawn-banners flame in the
Eastern sky,
Old ghosts arise from the desolate fields of
battle,
Where the grey graves lie.
Our brothers rest in the quietness of the home-
land;
Unquiet graves have we.
We are the dead that cry from the desert
spaces
And the deeps of the wind-washed sea.
Here are the hills in the light-blue haze of the
morning,
Where the dawn is a smother of crimson out
of the foam;
Here are the valleys, and yonder the pathless
waters,
Where lies the road to home.
Gone are the days when the sun was blind
with the smoke-wrack,
And clamour smote on the cold gates of the
stars —
We hear not, over the sea, the murmurous
cities
And rumours of wars.
Only above us the wraith of a wind-tossed
banner
Towers to the quiet sky.
We are the dead whose dust is the dust of
England,
The Dead who may not die.
May, 1919. I.R.M.
' THE CHANT OF THE FIGHT.
Come, sing of the days when the world was
wide,
And the war-drum roll’d over the sea;
When he was a man who could cast fear aside,
And march with the bold and the free!
Ye hear the anthem, swelling, swelling,
Over the meadows of gold,
Where the feet of the fighters swept swinging
to war,
To the song of the heroes of old.
There’s many a schoolboy’s soul has thrilled
With the splendour of England’s might;
And many a schoolboy’s heart has filled
With the swift desire of the fight!
Ye hear the anthem, swelling, swelling,
Over the meadows of gold,
’Tis the chant of the fighters who joyed in the
strife,
’Tis the song of the heroes of old.
O! hear ye the crash of the swift-rolling drum,
O! hear the war-bugle’s shrill call;
The shout of the brave o’er the wild battle-hum,
“To victory—we win or we fall!”
Ye hear the anthem, swelling, swelling,
Over the blood-scattered sod;
For the souls of the heroes are marching home,
At the call of the Trumpet of God.

OLD CANNON.
Deep in the leafy coverts, where the sun
Makes gold-checked floors along the paths of
May,
Lie the old cannon. Flowers spread ’neath
their feet,
And woodbine mantles o’er them, like a shroud,
And skies are blue and quiet above the fields,
Where wheat and poppies blow in the breath
of day.
Unheeding, calm, new seasons soften o’er
The ruin and the glory of past years
That these old cannon dream of, watchful
there,
With dark sides gleaming, iron heads aloft
That proudly once, across the shot-swept hills,
Thundered for England in the shivered dawn.
August, 1925. Adon.
OUR GLORIOUS DEAD.
Their hearts were young, their visions blithe
and free;
Life lay before them, bountifully bright—
They saw no cross on high, no heaven-born
light,
But gave their lives for England’s liberty.
Forth, in a rich, unsparing stream, we see
Their blood poured forth to champion the
right,
And we who live, we pray for but one sight
Of those who fell on far Gallipoli.
Now they lie still, beneath those azure skies
Which witnessed their immortal sacrifice;
And from the earth above some resting head
Blossoms at last the waving poppy red,
To tell who reads that here lie Britain’s best,
Who gave their lives to give their country rest.
August, 1930. J.K.W.
NOVEMBER 11.
The same red sun will rise and set again,
The moon will silver o’er the midnight sky.
The stars will flicker in their pale, swift pain,
As silent vapours wander slowly by.
They led the shepherds on that wondrous
night; and yet
For us they seem to flicker, and forget.
The flowers that bloom are still as soft and fair,
The spring has lost not one, long, happy day.
The same high sun that warms the forest lair
Still sees warm waters quiver in its ray.
These, too, have all forgot the tale, and yet,
The hearts that shared their youth cannot
forget.
Old faces, lined with passing stormy years,
Recall the joys that withered like a leaf.
Old faces, calm through age’s pensive tears,
Have long sought heaven in their proud, deep
grief.
And we who wait, we see no splendour set;
There memory is eterne; we cannot forget.

“THE POET.”
(The J. D. Burns Memorial Prize).
He built a city fair, with glancing spire
And shady grove, beside a sunlit sea,
That men might look within and, wond’ring,
see
The perfect beauty of his heart’s desire.
He sang a song that men might catch the fire
And know with him life’s endless harmony,
The music that through all eternity
Before creation and beyond the pyre
Speaks in the lives of men. Oh, mighty
bard!
Heaven’s gift to man, voicing divine decrees,
Painting all beauties with the master-hand,
Softening the touch of time and fortune
hard,
Pure as the snow-clad heights or salt sea
breeze,
Though kings and empires fall, thy work
shall stand.

REMEMBRANCE.
If ever on the long road to the tomb
We pause, in memory to scan these days,
Recalling from the half-extinguished blaze
Of burning hopes, faces of comrades, whom
We may lose sight of in the deep, sad gloom
Of life’s grey twilight; surely then the haze
Of youth will throw across the years its rays,
- And bathe in glory life’s departing bloom.
For this long journey never grows so drear,
But that some memory can allay its pain.
And if, when old, we still have power to hear
These whispering echoes of our youth again,
Gleaning the joys of many a vanished year,
Surely fond memories are not in vain.
December, 1910. B. C. Thomson.
TILL WE MEET AGAIN.
Farewell! farewell! What more is there to say?
The old year dies, and only now remain
Thoughts of those times which will not come
again.
How the years pass and old friends slip away,
’Tis best that we should follow, for our day,
Our little day, with all its joy and pain,
Is over now, and it would be but vain
To linger on. So let us face the fray.
And if thy life be dark or full of light,
For old time’s sake remember still thy friend.
God grant thee battles in this world to fight,
Honour to win and weakness to defend,
And glorious hope intolerably bright,
Spurring thee on to triumph in the end.
December, 1911. B. C. Thomson.
DEFEAT.
The battle’s fought—and lost. Shall we com-
plain,
Make poor excuse, or jeer in paltry scorn?
Or mope with eyes downcast, and looks for-
lorn,
And say that Hope is dead, and effort vain?
No, still unconquered shall we rise again
For this, the darkest hour before the morn,
Shall flee away before the sun, new born,
And bearing gladness that shall conquer pain.
Then as a river, whose obstructed flow
Is gathering force, relentless, with slow might
Will burst the barriers, crashing down below,
And brook nor stay nor hindrance in its
So victory’s mighty flood, when time is meet,
Shall sweep away the barriers of Defeat.

IN MEMORIAM. W.C.A.
We say farewell, and blinded, only see
The gloom and coldness of the yawning
grave;
The darkness of that all-engulfing wave
Which bore his soul into Eternity.
We cannot know, until our eyes are free
From mortal hindrance, that God smites to
save.
And why He leaves the weak and takes the
brave.
We cannot tell, but know that such must be.
We try to see, and dimly understand
That all things work towards a final goal;
We bow our heads, and try to trace God’s hand,
When o’er us sorrow’s troublous waters roll,
And though on us dark shades of night must
fall,
He seeth dawn, and understandeth all.

SONNET.
“Life is swifter than a weaver’s shuttle.”
—Job.
Our web of life is woven in the gloom;
The brightness of its hues we cannot see,
Nor all the magic of the mystic loom,
Veiled in the dream-dust of eternity;
But at the last, when moth and rust consume
The weaver’s shuttle, death shall set us free;
Then shall we slip the shadows of the tomb
And in the spirit triumph gloriously.
How wondrous is this little life of ours—
The strands of gold, the threads of sombre
gray,
The desert rocks inwoven with the flowers!
Yet it must pass, alas! too soon away,
Borne out upon that unreturning tide,
Oh, never shattered—only laid aside.

SONNET.
Oh, wondrous hope that bridges dark despair,
To know that right will conquer in the end!
And yet, how oft our soaring anthems blend
With baffling music of the syren snare,
Calling with revelling riot and the glare
Of tinsel glory, calling us still to rend
The chains of aspiration and descend
Into the maddening whirl of folly, where
Those maniac voices mingle mockingly.
Oh, that the soul were as a flame to leap
Beyond the reach of such, or else could be
In soft Lethean languor laid asleep,
Where the long billows of the ocean sweep
’Mid Orient islets lulled in tropic sea!
May, 1913. B. C. Thomson,
J.D.B.
His was the loyal heart that ever pressed
To brighter laurels: he had caught the flame
Of Love and Goodness; with unfaltering aim.
He struggled ever upward in the quest
Of Truth and Beauty; last, from Duty’s test
He flinched not, but abjuring peaceful fame
Went forth to battle in his country’s name
And serve his King, leaving to God the rest.
We with our briefer vision mourn the loss,
The baffled promise; yet Faith’s surer sight
Piercing the veil irradiate with the Cross,
Sees him with those who, having fought the
fight,
And won the immortal crown unstained by
dross,
Now serve the Master in the ampler light.

IN MEMORIAM—J. D. BURNS.
He went as one who answering duty’s call,
Forsook the level plains and scaled the height,
And bravely strove against the oppressor’s
might,
To save his country from the tyrant’s thrall.
Ah! why should he, our best and bravest, fall ?
His strength was needed for the eternal fight,
Of good with evil, to uphold the right;
And he struck down! Oh, God! can that be
all?
“Ah, no,” a thousand voices rise and say,
“His spirit’s noble influence will not die,
Whose voice inspires the patriot of to-day,
The poet’s soul calls forth the true and high,
And comrades follow where he led the way,
And rise to arms at his impassioned cry.”

“NIGHT.”
I gazed into the depths of darkest blue,
I pierced the star-strewn spaces of the night,
And far beyond the bounds of mortal sight,
My loftiest joys, beauties profound, I knew,
And like a bird uncaged my spirit flew,
Swift as an eagle, or the lightning flight
Of falling stars, to where the banished light
Of bygone sunsets, or the wondrous hue
Of morning’s glowing beam with sparkling
pearls
Of dew on spiders’ palaces, and gold
That brightly glitters from a sun-lit sea,
When Phoebus rising, glorious, unfurls
His blood-red standards, gave the joy untold
Of him that gazes at eternity.

SED MILES SED PRO PATRIA.
Cold Queen of Night, look down from wintry
skies,
Greet the wan stars and palely light the
gloom,
Shed soft thy radiance on the shell-rent tomb,
Bathe it with splendour ere thy glory dies;
Clothe with thy majesty the sacrifice—
One broken thread in Fate’s eternal loom,
One budding rose cut short ere fullest bloom.
The chilly wind in eerie cadence sighs,
And the wild surge laments upon the shore
In stormy requiem—aye, not alone—
Not unlamented on yon hillside bare,
Slumbers a hero heart, for never more
Shall he be nameless, though perchance un-
known,
Who lies for Right and Country buried there.

“THE UNIVERSALITY OF ENJOY-
MENT.”
“I have soared with the lark, and have striven
to weave
In this song of the Spring some impress of
the joy
Of living, that nothing but death can destroy.”
—J. D. Burns.
I have a sweet perception of delights,
That makes dull life a garden full of song;
Each hazy vista opens wondrous sights
To him who smiles and sings the whole day
long.
When life is sweet and no dread cloud appears,
I can partake of mortal joy in folly;
Then, like some infant, happy in his tears,
Can find a joy in being melancholy.
I can disport myself beneath the shade
Of boulders, while the cataracts come down
In arching torrents, where the tree-fern bends.
Music and art delight me; I have made
My heart enjoy the pleasures of the town:
I joy in all that Man or Nature sends.

SAUVE QUI PEUT.
I strayed amongst the booths of Vanity Fair,
I saw performed the Comedie Humaine,
And all each showman cried was his own ware,
While every Actor played alone for gain.
I wrote some stanzas for the sake of Art,
Another wrote some for the sake of—cash,
And we both knew within our private heart,
No Love of Truth inspired our wordy trash.
One man for Glory sets the world afire;
One man, to pay his debts, enslaves the pen;


One man upholds a Principle—for hire:
Profit and Loss is the whole creed of men!
In Love alone is aught unselfish done;
My own opinion be my only one.

TWO SONNETS.
I.
The great musician played; he touched the
string,
And straightway came into my soul a thrill,
As when the Spring of Nature wakes to fill
The earth with gladness, and the blossoms
bring
The thought of beauty, when upon the wing
Of softest zephyr, hushed and almost still,
Float sweetest perfumes, while from vale and
hill
The song of birds proclaims the gladsome
Spring.
Far down, the stream, deep in the valley’s
shade,
Runs lightly on in murmuring happiness;
Above the sunlight bathes the pines and gives
Life all its beauty. So the master played
And told how joyously all Nature lives
When Spring comes, radiant with loveliness.
11.
He played of death, and death’s heartrending
pain,
Such as men feel when some great hero
dies,
And in its bitterness the bruised soul cries,
“See where he lies; gone, ere he could attain
The heights he sought. So—all has been in
vain.”
But as I listened to these harmonies,
JSolemn and sad, that seemed to paralyse
All sense and fill the heart with aching pain,
Another song, with patient longing filled,
Was interwoven, and by slow degrees
Alone prevailed. It was a song of faith
In something nobler after death that thrilled
Each sense with sympathy, as the soul sees
The Life that lies beyond Death’s dreaded
wraith.
August, 1917. “Thalassa.”
THE JOY OF NATURE.
Oh, wondrous joy of the great grey stretching
road,
Joy of the mountains and the distant sea,
Both blending in one exquisite harmony
Of mingling purples; joy of streams that flowed
By leafy caves to waters thick bestrewed
With dancing gold of sunrise; joy of free
Wild days that lingered, smiling joyfully
Ere to the westward Phoebus redly glowed
And died, forgotten, on the faint-lit heights
That still retained dim tints of parting day.
Yet, as day faded in those red-gold bars
Of morning promise, perfumed with delights,
Came Night, her brow proud-ringed with con-
quering bay,
Her dark hair jewelled with eternal stars.

SOUL OF THE ROSE.
I do not know why fades the lovely rose;
Perhaps it fades into a fairer state;
I do not know where the sweet cadence goes,
That once has made the heart with Hope
dilate;
I know this only: Nature never dies,
And all her processes are wise and just;
The roses fair, the cadences that rise,
Must live, despite the silence and the dust.
Then, lovely maid, the roses of thy cheek
Must, like the roses of the garden, fade;
The music of thy voice, too, lovely maid,
Must fail, like music from the rippling creek;
But, fade or fail, —thy soul shall never die:
Are there, then, roses in eternity?
December, 1917. “Grac.”
“SONNET.”
Borne forth from pathless waters in the night,
With troubled surging breaks the crested
wave.
Rushing impetuous as though to lave
The topmost shingle. Lo! with lessened might,
It creeps its painful way up to the height,
Lingers a moment’s space, and then rolls back
With gathering impetus to ocean’s black,
From whence it drew. And so we mortals fight
From a tumultuous birth to hopeful youth,
And thence with speeding march to lusty prime,
And then slow striding back to laggard age
And second infancy, again in sooth
Brought back to where began the troubled
climb,
A shadow flitting o’er a mighty stage.
May, 1918. R.K.-C.
THESE THAT DIED.
Sometimes I ponder as slow shadows creep
Upon the garden, and it seems to me
As though a clanging, stark Eternity
Had passed, forgotten, to the Outer Deep
Of space unending, where my comrades sleep.
Brown earth, and shifting sand, and crying
sea
Hold them for ever, yet I know them free.
They do but dream that once the path was
steen,
Winding in noonday dust along the years;
They soon forget, and very distant seems
The tribute of forgotten human tears.
Yet Love along the starry Way of Dreams
Passes with them the Gateway of the Mind,
Eternity to travel, unconfined.

“RESURGANT.”
The leaves that mellowed fall in April days,
Tinted and withered by the setting year,
Crimsoned and gamboged, riven, old and sere,
Toss unregretted in the wind that strays
A wanton through the woods and parks, and
plays
Through showery skies, all clouded o’er and
drear.


Littered they lie in crannies there and here,
In brambled spinneys and by devious ways,
Meet carpet for King Winter’s silent feet.
But, lo! when Spring arising tips the oak
With tender green, while throstles trill to
greet
The year which Faust-like doffs her ancient
cloak,
The leaves have gone—to gladness born again,
A parable of life and fate to men.

(Killed in France, September, 1918.).
The world is but a world; the universe
Grins at its spinning pin-head shadow show.
So . . . grieve we not then, when the great
souls go,
Leaving the less to fill the world with worse.
You were of greater soul, walking apart
From me, although I honoured you, gave you
(Unknown for we w r ere just earth-
neighbours, too)
The love and homage of a boy’s young heart.
I loved you, love you; yet not mourn your
going:
I will not grieve for a good friend who . . .
dies ?
Smashes earth’s fetters from eternity.
And yet you loved life—and so I, while knowing
I can thank God who set your great soul free,
Here honour majesty in sacrifice.

SONNET.
Steal for thy song the rippling loveliness
Of sparkling streamlets washing over stones,
The tree’s soft murmur to the wind’s caress,
The beauty of the magpie’s fluted tones.
Give it the rolling thunder’s majesty,
The magic power of the waterfall,
The lift, the roll, the rhythm of the sea,
The wildness of the black swan’s flying call.
Shape then with these thy loftiest ideals,
Thy hopes, thy faith, thy best and truest
thought,
And guard against that lower self which steals
Sincerity and power, and leaves thee nought.
For ever in thy writing there must be
That nameless something which is part of thee.

SONNET.
All night the wind went howling through the
trees,
Clear now and loud, now far off, dim and faint,
Crying abroad its fierce and ageless plaint
Waking the resonant pines to threnodies.
All night there thundered through the crying
woods
The Unseen Hunters with their fleet-foot
hounds;
Mad with the lust of blood, they coursed their
rounds
Shrieking through desecrated solitudes.
But with the first pale faltering light of day,
Over the leafless woods the dawn came fair,
Pallid and shy: upon the stilly air
Faltered the thrushes from each wind-tossed
spray.
So, when the tumult of the past gave place,
There was a pause, a hush within your face.

SACERDOS MUSARUM.
Come down, O Muse, and visit me again.
Long time have I been searching by the sea,
On sounding strand and by the pleasant lea,
Seeking a song from out the boundless main.
Oft have I seen the ponderous seventh wave
Pick up its scattered vestments fold by fold,
And o’er the heaving green be far unrolled,
Then thunder on the strand near many a cave.
So did I hope, O Muse, to find a song
In some reef, pool, or cavern by the shore,
And show thy secrets to the turbulent throng,
Unknown, a seventh wave to sweep the soul,
A flood to purify and make it whole
With its melodious and awakening roar.

SONNET.
She took the plastic clay and with the hand
That marks the artist, fashioned it until
It was as one with her in heart and will,
Ready to answer swift to her command.
When in her cloistered warmth we softly stand,
And see the imprisoned love Time cannot kill,
We know they think of us beyond the hill,
Just as we thought when in that sovereign land.
Pause, stranger, pause a little while and pray
For as each life goes on at close of day—
Though the sun dies, yet still the moon appears,
Reflects its light—so in the after years
Her sons reflect the School and what she
taught ;
Pray that she yet may live in deed and thought.

SONNET.
A poet dwelt within an ancient land,
Whose greatness lay forgotten in the dust
Of ruined castles and old armour’s rust;
Whose tale was told, but none could understand.
Once fertile soil had turned to desert sand,
And fallen houses felt the bleak wind’s gust
Blow through and stir the curtain’s age-old
must;
The breakers swept unchecked upon the strand.
The poet saw these old memorials
Of splendour quenched in years. He saw
brave men
And lovely ladies in deserted halls;
No windy ruin on a lonely fen,
But busy towns within uncrumbled walls:
He sang, and dust and dry bones lived again.
December, 1932. J.P.


Reflective Poems
EVENING.
Where evening paints a trembling tint of grey
On distant hills, and wraps the land in mist,
As fancy clouds a fleeting thought in dreams,
When lissom shadows, wandering, come and
stay,
The timid moon holds faithful to her tryst,
And fearful peeps through eastern hills, her
beams
Love-lit for Night, dappling the woods and
streams.
A voice low whispers in the mellow breeze
That hardly stirs the ferns adown the glade,
Or rustles the soft bough’s close interlace,
And the pale stars are eyes of one who sees —
Who steps upon the hills, in night arrayed—
Who moves amongst illimitable space,
Which circleth all things in a mute embrace.
And from a steep a fox, athwart the glen,
Barketh his nightly cry, and a wan star,
Pale poised above the everlasting hills,
As poised an eagle waits above the fen
Its prey, as though the eye of one afar,
Flashes majestic, and the silence stills
And stirreth all, and vales, and mounts, and
rills.
Eftsoon from down the darkling billow’d slope
Of the kind hillside, creeps a distant voice
That loses volume in its wandering call,
But keeps its cadence and its swell of hope
In God, that all creation may rejoice—
The still, small singing of a waterfall,
With pauses liquid, like God’s voice in all.
From lissom windings of a valley hid
Beneath the hillside, like a maiden’s face
Hidden in tresses of her darksome hair,
Riseth an incense, as a soul is bid,
And riseth heavenward Heaven to embrace,
Of dappling waters on the stilly air,
As summer’s scent of roses debonair.
And from a hillside hidden in the mist,
Where white wraiths twine the tresses of their
hair
Above the blackness of their gloomy eyes,
And shadowy lips, that the dark hill hath
kiss’d,
Low breathed on the mystic, vibrant air,
I hear the rhythmic sequence of the cries,
Which crickets’ soft persistence multiplies.
And as I stand upon a topmost hill,
And perfumed moisture of the starlit night
Creeps from beneath the bracken in the dell,
And all is vibrant soft, and all is still,
It seems as though a weird and monstrous
sprite,
Hobgoblin-like, swings madly on the swell
Of the opposing hills where spirits dwell.
O ! the bats’ fleeting, and the stilly sound
Of Night, that peaceful hides the whirling train
Of creeping wood-things, and the wan, white
fog,
With faces in it Memory has refound,
Half-dim, as faces through a mullioned pane,
And fear-filled croakings of a distant frog,
Far-flung across a wide and eerie bog!
December, 1906. A.O.R.
autumn;
Oh linger, roseate Autumn! How sadly brief
thy stay!
The blood-red lights of morning will turn to
pallid grey,
Till the moonlight of the evening shall fill the
pathless gloom,
For feeble Age’s weary steps to seek the silent
tomb.
And thus thou comest and must go; yet now
thy presence frees
The earth from trouble and all pain, and sways
the boundless seas.
Thy mystic seal has stamped the world, and
over all there broods
The thrilling beauty of thy soul in shady soli-
tudes.
For thou, oh sunset of the year, art clothed in
robes of gold,
Arrayed in gleaming gems as fair as any oceans
hold,
In amethyst and opal lights and skies of sap-
phire blue,
With garlands twined, and spangled o’er with
drops of silver dew.
And when the sun is hanging low, and the full
fiery moon
Is rising in the purple East with mists of amber
strewn,
Whilst overhead the fretted vault of heaven’s
unending dome
Is flecked with woven clouds as soft as wind-
uplifted foam,
And in the glades the odorous air, unruffled by
the wind,
Rests peacefully upon the brow and leaves no
care behind,
Then is thy music heard above in south winds
from the sea,
Which stir the leaves and fill the woods with
restless harmony;
When sunset, clad in rainbow lights, upon the
ocean plays,
Then is the sweetest, calmest hour of all thy
glorious days;
A spirit hovers in thy breath and sends through
every vein
A feeling of intensest bliss, yet not unmixed
with pain;
For every beauty thou canst show must bring a
thought that soon
Each one must pass, as pass at eve the
shadows cast at noon,
Till naught remain but memory of all thy
glories now,
Yet memories, alas! are like the leaves upon
thy bough,


All red and gorgeous while they last, but oh!
how soon they fade!
And fall unheeded on the blast to wither in
the shade!
Yet Autumn after Autumn will come with joy
or pain,
Except the Autumn of our life, which never
comes again.
Yea, Autumn after Autumn will pass with
smile and tear,
And every one will steal away another weary
year.
Another year, till Winter come across the
stormy wave,
And weary Autumn find a rest within the silent
grave.
April, 1910. B. C. Thomson.
THE ARBOUR.
A lone bright star hung sad and cold,
And cold the white moon shone,
With a pale soft gleam in a ring of gold,
And slow and drear the long hours rolled,
As the last faint star swept on.
And 10, beneath an arbour, where
Bloomed roses white and red,
A shadowy form stood waiting there,
Listening and waiting, and the air
A rain of perfume shed.
Then suddenly there came in sight
Another silent form,
Whose long robes fell in folds of light,
Whose eyes shone as the stars of night
From out a gathering storm.
She paused a moment on her way
To pluck a crimson bloom,
And in his outstretched hand did lay
That blood-red rose, then turned away
And melted in the gloom.
He knew the sign; he asked no more,
The soft moon shone above,
More sweetly far than e’er before,
And every breeze about him bore
Some messenger of Love.
The pale sun glimmered through the trees
In mockery of day;
The bare limbs moaned in every breeze,
Like the mournful surge of far-off seas,
Within some rocky bay.
The falling arbour still was bright
With roses overhead,
That wildly swayed in the wintry light,
And their petals were scattered in clouds of
white,
But the crimson rose was dead.
And the dark form stood there now alone
With a white rose at his breast,
But at his feet was the silent stone,
Which tells the tale of a spirit flown
To an everlasting rest.
His knees were bent; his head was bare
Before that cold white stone;
He gently placed that white rose there,
One gasping sob, one silent prayer,
And he went his way—alone.

SOUNDING BRASS AND TINKLING
CYMBALS.
The glory of starlit mountains,
Or the breast of the sobbing sea,
The murmur of gushing fountains,
What is their beauty to me?
For they, whom I honoured so, doubted,
In blindness disdaining to see
That the word which they openly flouted
Was sacred to me.
The music of night-winds sighing,
And wild birds carolling free,
The glamour of evening dying,
They are all one to me.
Enough! The whirlwind of passion
Has snapt the fetters of care,
And never again will I fashion
A song of pallid despair.
For oft in the past have I wondered
If I should be given the light,
When the lips of the tempest have thundered
Their song of effortless might;
But ever the earth-gloom has sundered
The message unspeakably bright,
When the scroll of the planets is riven,
And, out of a firmament higher,
Inexpressible glories are driven,
All reeling in emerald fire,
And snatches of music are given
More sweet than the dreams of desire:
And words unheard of and faces
Whirl out of the mill-race of Time,
And wonders unthought of, and spaces
Of beauty and colour sublime
Extinguish and cover the traces
Of sorrow and folly and crime.
Oh God! that I had but a token
To tell of the visions I see!
But the words which should have been spoken
Shall never be uttered by me;
For the heart may be wounded and broken,
Yet the pride of the spirit is free.
For they, whom I honoured so, doubted,
In blindness disdaining to see;
Yea, they have openly flouted
The word that was sacred to me.
Yet let them censure or flatter,
Let the parasites cling to their prey;
Let them shout at the portals and batter
The gates of the temple of clay,
Though the word of the message would scatter
And send them all weeping away.
No more shall they tempt with the glitter
Of pageant, the music of lyre;
For the idols are shattered, and bitter
The lees of the cup of desire.
And the tempters—ah, wiser and fitter,
To leave them alone in, the mire.


So let them cavil and palter,
They may seek my offerings in vain;
No more shall my footsteps falter,
For the way of my journey is plain;
And the flame that I lit at the altar
Shall never be kindled again.
Though long I have struggled and striven
To rend dark Memory’s chain;
Though long my heart has forgiven
The sting, the insult and stain;
Thank God, I can never be driven
To flatter the faithless again!
Farewell to the song of the minions,
Who bow to the idols of clay!
Farewell to the dream of dominions!
I shall never reach higher than they,
And never go soaring on pinions,
As I dreamed at the dawning of day.
For they, whom I honoured so, doubted,
In blindness disdaining to see
That the word which they openly flouted
Was sacred to me.

“ON THE GREAT OF ALL AGES.’’
When cold the sea-breeze blows toward the
shore,
And moans among the stunted trees that fringe
The long dark stretch of heaving, sobbing sea;
When the waves thunder on the dunes that rise
Ghostlike and still, lit by the fitful moon,
Ah! then the sighing wind doth speak to me;
Doth tell of heroes and the far-off days,
When fell those mighty men in noble death
To nobly live in man’s remembrance.
I love to think on misty, long-dead times,
. And on the stirring tales of chivalry;
My inmost soul flies on the shrieking wind,
And lives again in those forgotten years,
And ling’ringly, I ponder o’er past deeds
And legends that, like echoes of a song,
Roll down the centuries to raise our hearts,
That we may dream on high fidelity
To right and truth, and all that makes life
grand,
That we may rise and link our souls with theirs,
Who through the aeons form the melody
That rolling down in swelling strains doth tell
How greatness still endures; the mighty past
Still standing, potent ’mid the great to-day.

THE COMET.
This comet, then has not been seen before.
Did not an aged priest erstwhile compare
Man’s life unto a bird, that from the hail
And roaring wind seeks refuge in a hall,
Full lighted, where men seat them at a feast,
Heedless of Nature’s turmoil, o’er the wine?
Frightened by the glare, the sparrow flashes
past,
And vanishes into the storm, and straight
Is seen no more.
This comet, too, hath come
Out of the vasty night into our ken,
And soon will pass again to boundless night,
And go—we know not whither.
From one Eternity it comes, and soon
In an Eternity as deep and dark
It plunges and is lost for evermore.
Messenger of the Infinite, on high
Thou art in beauty trailing glorious clouds
And blazing forth thy message to the earth,
Silent and wondering.
In His own works is God made manifest;
Grant me, O Lord, to read the lesson right,
To understand a little, and to glean
Some scraps of Truth, as lowly I look up,
Seeing Time’s silent, wingless messenger
Speeding on ever to Eternity.

TO-MORROW, AND TO-MORROW, AND
TO-MORROW.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The sea for ever rolling on the shore,
Crashing in stinging spray upon the rocks;
The cold blue depths beyond, heaving with slow
Majestic motion, while the lone sea-bird
Wheels his long sweeping flight before the
wind,
And far beneath the roar and rush of sound
Glide on the slimy monsters of the deep.
A lingering sound of sweet voluptuous song;
The dizzy round of gay fantastic dance;
Lights twinkling in the green soft-rustling
leaves;
The ringing sound of heaven-sent joyous laugh.
Harmonious with the scene of joy and mirth.
The chill blast of the icy winter wind;
The gentle, sliding, soundless falling snow,
Mingled with smoke, arising from a land
Of desolation. Now hath Beauty fled,
And naked Horror holds unquestioned sway
Over a land of death and misery.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
The sea still rolls as ever on the shore;
Still doth the surf fly madly from the rocks.
While, like a range of ever-changing peaks,
The heaving depths glide on in stately rank.
Still the sea-bird maintains his lonely sway
Over his bleak wide realm, and all the scene
Is as it was before, untouched by change.
And thus man’s tragi-comedy pants on
Its troubled length upon the stage of time,
While Nature, grand, stern, and immovable,
Mocks his gay laugh or gasping dying groan
In awful, still, immutability.

TO THE STAR OF EVE.
At evening on the yellow sands I lie
And listen to the whisper of the sea,
And as I gaze in reverence on high,
Where in the star-strewn heavens thy purity


And soft’ning golden gleam is shed around,
My heart forgets its cares and in a dream
Lies in quiescence, while thy beauty’s charm
Distils its influence sweet even as the sound
Of some rich harmony. Now my soul doth
seem
To be enveloped in a wondrous calm.
When like a barque storm-tossed and hope-
bereft,
Hard buffeted by black Misfortune’s might,
My soul is faced with darkness, in a cleft
Within the inky heavens a gleam of light
Appears, and the dark clouds are silver-lined
By thy soft radiance, strengthening my heart,
And lightening anew my darksome way;
Thou shinest forth, and in thy grace I find
A guide from which my soul will never part,
A beacon light, an ever present stay.
August, 1917. “Quintus.”
PAN’S PIPES.
Hark! as the crimson of even glows in the
depths of the ocean,
Sweeter than honey and lighter than breath of
the noonday in summer,
Clearly and low comes his piping, dying in
echoes of distance
Over the low-lying meadows that rise from the
sand of the sea.
And sometimes I follow him eagerly, follow the
strains that are dying
Somewhere away to the westward, faint in the
arms of the sunset;
And sometimes I seem to be nearer, and some-
times his music comes softer,
Borne on the breezes of even that blow from
the heart of the sea.
Sometimes, I think, in the distance he paddles
in reed-covered shallows,
But ever as toward him I hasten o’er valleys
flower-starred in the gloaming,
He flees in the gathering shadows, and clearly
his laughter comes ringing,
Echoing over the beaches and lost in the foam
of the sea.
But still when his piping at even calls to me
over the pastures,
Over the kine-covered pastures, hushed with
the lingering echoes,
Still do I follow him, fleeing, into the shades
that are falling,
Shrouding the form of the minstrel that plays
to the darkening sea,
And some day I know I shall find him, steal
on him there in the twilight,
Calling so plaintive the sun that is sunk in
the fast fading west,
There where the night-waves are crooning, and
first stars are faint in the heaven,
Singing the songs of the summer, away in his
home by the sea.

THE EXISTENCE OF EVIL.
“Is there a God?” the dewy snowdrop lisped;
“Is there a God in heaven, and wise and just,
Who gave me beauty, purity, with birth,
And then made man, and gave the tyrant beast
Freewill—He gave me none!—to pluck me out
From my own native soil, and feast
His wanton eye unto satiety,
Then spurn me, in the dust to languish . . ,
die?
I am the sport of man, whom God has made:
Is this God just, that gave His creature, Man,
Dominion over me . . . and you, and all?”
The hunted creature of the forest cried,
“Can God be just that gave His creature, Man,
Power to hunt the deer and slay, devour
At will ? ... Is Man good to the universe ?
. . . Man is a blot upon this lovely earth,
Building but to destroy, selfish and vain—
If God indeed exists, why made He Man?
One, meanwhile, of the species, rapt in thought,
Sat in the cloistered silence of the night,
And mused upon the destiny of earth.
“Oh, what a world of querying!” he thought;
“Why are there pain and sorrow here below?
Why did God make that Devil-fish of Wrong?
Why is there evil on the bounteous earth?
Why is there . . . why . . . this endless,
racking why?”
The morning broke and beauty tinged the east,
The man went forth—to find his morning meal:
He slew the deer beside a stream, and saw
A cropp’d crush’d snowdrop hanging from her
lip.
. . . Why is there . . . why . . , this endless,
racking why?

THE IMMORTAL HOPE.
Dust unto dust!—if these, our grosser parts,
Return at last to earth that gave them being,
Shall not those wandering winds that blow
from Heaven,
Immortal longings past the earth’s desiring,
Return at last to God? For as the flowers
Clothe the spring meadows with their season’s
splendour
And dew-awakened freshness, so the soul
Shall be arrayed before the light of judgment
In beauties of each act of self-forgetting,
Starred with the glory of each thought of
Heaven,
And longing after Immortality.

THOUGHTS.
They come like horsemen coming in the night,
Draw near, and die away, and come again,
And weave their clattering music in the skies.
They come in misty forms of morning light,
In morning mist, and sunshine after rain,
From that same font whence summer days arise,
And nights of wind and star and the wild seas,
That cry for ever to the listening years
Of land unshapen in the wastes of Time,


And waters by the far Hesperides,
Black ocean glooms wherein no helmsman
steers,
And lost Sargassoes in an ageless slime.
They pass like stars athwart the pathless skies,
And leave me framing words with speechless
eyes.

SCARABAEUS.
The beetled emblem of a fallen race,
This antique scarab stone so strangely
wrought,
Queer hieroglyph upon its adverse face—
It lies before me now, bestirring thought
Far back to days of ancient Egypt’s pride.
This sacred Nilus-stone of bluish-green,
Now captive in its modern golden band,
May once the token of a faith have been;
Perchance have graced of old the lovely hand
Once kissed by foolish Antony.

THE HARP.
(The J.D. Burns Prize Poem).
The harp was set upon a field of green,
A field of velvet turf, spangled with dew
And redolent of Spring—a little field
Bordered with trees in richest foliage deck’d,
Through which the gentle Sun with softened
beam
More gently made his way and shone full fair
Upon the golden harp; the frame was gold
'And studded o’er with beauteous costly jewels;
Of gold, too, were the strings; Orpheus’ own
self
Did ne’er a finer instrument desire
When he was wont to play.
To that retreat,
Set far apart from all our worldly strife
And harsh perpetual noise and selfishness,
A little company now makes its way
And comes into the field. Some ten or twelve
Alone were there —no more—to judge that day
The skill of two opponents, cunning both
To find a soul within the harp, and strike
From it a heavenly cadence; and each bard
Did think his own song best, wherefore they
came
To that sequestered spot with chosen friends
Whose task was to award the victor’s crown.
Now first stepped forth a noble Youth, who
came
Straight to the harp; comely he was and tall
With great strong limbs, and in his eyes a gleam
That spoke of ecstasy; straight to the harp
This Youth high-born did go, and seating him
Upon a stool of gold, touched the sweet strings,
One moment hesitant; then with fingers firm
He broke into a song of wild delight.
Life, all untraversed, for his seeking lay,
And through the music loud did he declare
His hopes, his rosy hopes—what he would do
When he became a man, when future, dim
As yet, though glowing through the obscuring
mists,
Should be transcended by reality:
He boasted of his knowledge of things past
And of the present; men of art he knew
Of all time, within human memory,
And men renowned in war and polity.
All this he sang in glad triumphant notes
And after scarce a pause, love was his theme,
How woman was the noblest gift of God
And how he worshipped her.
The hearers all
Sat rapt to hear the glorious melody;
As ceased the Youth, they hailed him as a bard
Of more than human skill; well pleased he was,
Seeming assured that he would win the prize.
Then slow arose the other, the Old Man,
Heaving a sigh, for once he, too, was young
And fiery and impetuous as the youth:
But that was long ago, long, long ago.
Now wrinkled was his brow, and sunk his
cheeks,
And white as snow, too, was his shaggy hair.
Soft through the strings at first his fingers
played,
And all his soul reached out and tinged the
notes
That his old fingers made. He sang of pain,
And sorrow, and all evils that befall
Mankind. He told of hopes and rosy dreams,
Told how they crumble into nothing, fade
Like the grey twilight, like a cataract voice,
As sleep beguiles the ear. Learning serves not
To guard from all distresses such as these.
But these three things alone lit up the gloom,
The sadness of his song: “Thou must believe,
Have faith in Christ our Lord, have this great
faith,
This faith that can move mountains; thou must
hope,
Hope that thy prayers to God may bring reward,
If not on earth, in heaven; thou must love,
Not woman alone, but all humanity:
Aid thou the feeble, succour the oppressed,
Feed those that hunger, and all mourners com-
fort ;
So can’st thou live in inward happiness.”
The music stopped. The Old Man pensive sat
And gazed through the thick leafage at the
heavens,
As though he sought an answer to his cry.
No word broke through the silence; great tears
streamed
Adown the cheeks of all. At last the Youth,
With eyes yet moist and all his ardour quenched,
Drew nigh and murmured: “Thou hast won
the prize,
The bard who touched the harp with such a
skill,
Who sang of truth, of life, and not of dreams,
Who raised a song immortal to the skies,
That hosts, methinks, angelic paused to hear—
Teach me to live that I thine art may share.”
December, 1924. E. E. Ransom.


EXTASE.
I dreamed I stood enrapt beneath the vault
Of arching stone, fantastic, mystical:
Eternal stone it seemed, and yet, I thought
Ethereal.
And through the darkness of the silent nave
There stole an unseen Presence, not mine own.
As in amaze, I stood enthralled, a light,
Born of the sanctities of holiness,
Suffused the oaken Choir, and, streaming sweet
Across the Sacred Rood, illumined all
Its subtlest architecture; and revealed
Incomparable mosaics, rich-conceiv’d,
Irradiate with their witness—golden lights!
Of the sublime Passion and Sacrifice.
And still it seemed unhuman, as a veil
Of transient atmosphere, of living blue,
Were drawn, to hide the awful brightness there,
A spirit inaccessible—
And, sudden broke upon the baffled sense
A Voice, cried, “Write, Creation’s sequence
write”—
And then I heard the organ-voices cry
As from the mystery of Eternity,
To signal the approach of some new state,
Some grand conception of Almighty Mind—
I heard the chaos of unordered Night,
The Firmament’s impetuous, mad career.
As, with the mighty fugue, I knew the rush
Of interlocking unisons. And now,
Subdued, then growing, rose a swelling flood
Of harmonies, conflicting; as a wave,
Lashed by the restive fury of the gale,
Rolls madly on, to lift its crested head
And thunder on defenceless shores; and on,
Scoring the snow-white spume, until, its wrath
Redoubled by the insistence of the foe,
It swift returns to mingle with the surge
Its foaming cataclysm.
Like to the lonely petrel’s storm-girt flight,
Who, crying as he wings athwart the wind,
Wakes echoes in the murmurings of the sea,
So did the unseen player, Heaven-inspir’d,
Weave solo voices, high, predominant,
Which cried above the chorus, silver-tongued,
And woke among the ponderous pedal bars
A grave reply.
Then broke upon the sense
The wailing complain of a thousand strings,
A flood of purest melody:
I saw
The very soul of Nature, and I knew
That He had fashion’d order out of strife.
August, 1928. E.H,
THE INFINITE MYSTERY.
A peace there was upon the mountain side,
And a quiet beauty overshading all.
The fragrance of the trees, the springing grass,
The tiny wild-flowers sweet in evening air;
These, being lovely, held dominion there,
And all about was fragrant loveliness.
The dying sun shone red on kindred peaks.
It was so peaceful, calm with coming night.
It seemed an old Athenian god might come,
Serene, with lofty power;
Or some sweet nymph glide softly through the
trees,
And Pan, the playful lover, with his crew.
It was a place the gods might well frequent;
Cathedral stillness, holy quiet were there.
From this sweet reverie of gods I woke,
To see the orange-golden sunset turn,
With nearing night, to gorgeous orange-pink,
And deepen still to rosy loveliness.
Against the glorious colours of the clouds
Stood out the mountain peaks, some far and
dark,
Some near, and gently-purpled ’gainst the sky.
Each with an aureole of golden light.
The slowly-deepening dullness of the sky.
Betrayed the moon, half-hidden by a peak,
A silver disc, slow rising with the night.
I stood, exulting in the loveliness.
To west, the darkening glories of the sun,
To east, the radiant freshness of the moon,
Fair rivals in harmonious splendour, each
So beautiful, Apollo and his sister:
One rich in gorgeous hues, the other pale,
Draped with a cloud, a silver silken gown;
One tingeing mountain-tops with rosy gold,
The other shedding a silver pallid beauty.
Slowly the glory of the sun was gone;
The rose-gold faded from the distant peaks.
Slowly the moon arose; the stars came out,
And soon the sunset’s last gold beam was gone,
And the highest mountain peak was dark with
night.
The moon remained, majestic, dominant,
Yet peaceful in the tranquil skies above.
And I was there alone, yet compassed round
With all the mysteries of the silvered night.
No, not alone, for all the air was wake
With whispering spirits of the ages past,
And these, alert and watchful, kept their peace.
I felt unutterable yearnings, hopes,
Desires beyond the mortal bounds of space.
I felt the littleness of all beliefs,
All creeds, and all the majesty of man
Before the grand infinitude of God.
Rapt in the unimaginable wonder,
My soul knew a strange peace and a new calm.

“THE COLOURS OF THE EARTH”—.
Rupert Brooke.
As you once loved the colours, so do I
The distant peaks; the sea; a summer sky;
Those yellow’d leaves that tumble from their
tree;
The “silver-gold” of dawn; the “golden sea”
Of sunset; clouds; the rainbow’s glorious hues;
The mellow-tinted corals; many-coloured views
From craggy heights—all these, and many more,
Once gave you purest pleasure, and you saw
Romance at every turn: what love, what pride
In colours of the English countryside!
You held life’s share of simple joys so dear—
Those common sights—for none was e’er so
drear
As went without a colour; yellow sands ;
And cool brown water; pink and chubby hands;
And blue smoke curling skywards . . .
I have felt


That grateful thrill of colour, even knelt
One day and rendered thanks to God that I
Should see such loveliness: a cloudless sky
Of perfect blue vied with a world of green,
And here and there among the trees were seen
Red roofs, and fields of waving gold.
To be
Unmoved by splendour such as this, to see
The world uncoloured, is to live in vain:
I’ve lived, and loved the colours—these remain.
May, 1933. R.V.P.
WAS IT FOR NAUGHT?
Within this great unbounded universe,
Where distance is beyond our mortal ken,
Where light is lost in time eternal, where
In ordered chaos countless stars are set
Amidst the dark infinitudes of space,
This tiny earth goes whirling on its way.
This tiny earth, of whose unmeasured age
We speak with awe; and yet, consider time,
Which stretches back to dim eternity,
And sets at naught the age-long span of earth.
Our little complex planet, dear as life
Itself, in time and space a fragment, spins
Through massive systems and by speeding
worlds
Unharmed, unhindered. But who knows the end
May not arrive, and planet meet with planet—
And swift destruction follow . . . worlds no
more . . .
Or, swallowed by some flaming star, the earth
May come to ashes. These are common
thoughts,
And anxiously we ask, “Is this the end?”
But Hope, replying, points to Man—in search
Of Truth and Beauty through the ages. Though
How small is Man beside the earth, the earth
Beside the Cosmos; and his fourscore years,
A passing spark, which flickers and is gone.
And yet—and yet, to think that struggling man
Should come to naught, that all the years of
hard
And patient striving for perfection, which
Has yet to be attained, should end in ruin,
Clear-seeing Reason scorns as wasted thought.
For surely out of God’s creation this,
The human race, the first to worship God,
Should not be made the toy of idle chance,
And evolution’s long and devious course
Be wasted effort, and the deathless story
Traced by human progress lost in ashes.
For why, what fool is he, unthinking, who
Would say this living speck in naked space
Was left without a purpose? Could the lives
Of great and noble men, throughout all times,
Have been for less than nothing, useless ? And—
Was it for naught that Christ died on the cross?

Narrative Poems
THE OCEAN’S REPLY.
(Loss of the “Titanic”)
They sent her out in the pride of her might, the
challenge of Man to the Sea,
And never had been such a conqueror as this
great ship should be;
They had brought their silver and brought their
gold and iron and toughest steel,
And raised the framework of ribs aloft from the
mighty bulk of the keel.
They had manned her then with their stoutest
hearts, with men that were tried and
true,
And they sent her out—the Queen of Ships—
to rule o’er the waves of the blue.
Smoothly she glided down from the stays, gal-
lantly breasted the wave,
As a new-born child in the cradle she rocked,
on the deep that must be her grave.
And the ripples caressed her mighty sides, and
gave no hint of the day
When the Sea should take up the challenge of
Man, and cease from its gentle play;
And cruel and hungry, should claim for its
own, the mightiest ship of all,
And drag her down to the green sea deeps, to
hold her there in thrall;
But not for a moment Man did dream, of the
things that soon should be,
And he bade her rule o’er the mighty deep, the
Mistress of all the sea.
He said that the Ocean was conquered quite,
but in truth it was only asleep,
For the waves could rise in fury and storm,
when lashed by the winds of the deep.
And the Sea spirit rode on the cold North
Wind, and sang in the whistling blast,
“Oh Man, thou hast dared me to do my worst,
and my worst shall come at last.”
And he turned his steed to the frozen North,
where the Ice King reigns over all,
And he took the largest of all the bergs, tower-
ing and chill and tall.
On the topmost peak of that glittering throne,
he took his seat on high,
And drew over all a mantle of mist, for the
ship that was doomed to die.
On the ship, as she throbbed through the
ghostly mist, there was laughter and
joy and light,
And two thousand souls knew naught of the
doom that was shrouded as yet by night.
But is it a gust of the cold sea-wind, or the
Ice King’s frozen breath,
That striketh chill through the thick mist-
wreaths which cling like the hand of
Death ?
What is it that riseth above thy bows? Oh,
ship, thou hast met thy doom!
For this mist shall be thy winding-sheet, and
these waves shall be thy tomb.
The cruel ice rips the plates from thy side, and
grinds its way to thy heart,
And now is the Ocean well revenged, for from
thee it shall never part.
But hold thee in thrall, as an answer to Man,
to the challenge of Man to the Sea,
“Thus do I answer all those that dare to dis-
pute my realm with me!”
July, 1912. J. D. Burns.
“THE CONQUERORS.”
(Capt. Scott and Party.)
“Death is swallowed up in Victory
Lost in the snow-cover’d wastes, where Aurora
illumes the pale Heaven,
Guarded by fast-frozen peaks where the foot
of mankind ne’er has trod,
Wrapped in the silence which oft by the howl
of the tempest is riven,
Five of Earth’s heroes lie sleeping, alone with
their glory and God.
Men may not build them a tomb, nor carry
their bodies with weeping
To a high sepulchre, grand with ornation of
marble and gold;
Far to the ice-shattered South, in a mantle of
snow, they are sleeping,
Sad is their requiem, sung by the blizzard,
unfetter’d and cold.
Bravely they turned to the South, from the
dangers before never shrinking,
Tramping for mile upon mile o’er the snow
that seemed endless to roll,
Not of themselves in their toil, in their hard-
ship and weariness thinking,
Grimly they still struggled on, and at last
fought their way to the Pole.
Thus they had gained what they sought, by
long striving and patient endeavour,
Close by the banner of Norway they solemnly
planted their own.
There will it fly in the blast as an emblem of
courage for ever;
Then, their task done, they turned back and
again faced the wilds bleak and lone.
Daily they fought through the storm, growing
weaker, but ever brave-hearted,
He who seemed strongest was first of the
party of stalwarts to fail;
They—loyal comrades—remained by his side
till the spirit departed,
Then laid him down in the snow, and went
on through the pitiless gale.
Honour to one whose renown shall go down
to the uttermost ages,
Who, in his weakness, went out to his death
in the element’s strife.
Brightly that name shall shine forth from the
noblest of History’s pages,
Oates, who for love of his friends, dying,
feared not to lay down his life.


Three of them left to fight on, every step lag-
ging slower and slower,
Over the barren snow-ridges, with glazed
eyes and drawing hard breath;
Each step an agony, strength for the fight
sinking every day lower,
Still they toiled on to the end in their terrible
journey of Death.
Honour them then at the last who had fought
their great fight to the ending;
Frozen and famish’d —the storm wailing o’er
in a dirge wild and grand;
Death in his majesty came with the glory of
victory blending;
They, like the heroes of old, gladly died for
the sake of their land.
Long as the world shall remain will the hearts
of men thrill with their story;
Written in letters of gold, shine their names
in the Book of the Brave.
Deathless, the death that they died is re-
corded with measureless glory,
Lighting with splendour triumphant the
darkness and gloom of the grave.
May, 1913. J. D. Burns.
BALLAD OF THE EMDEN.
The Emden sailed the Southern Seas, she flew
no skull and bones,
But one and twenty merchantmen she sent to
Davy Jones;
One and twenty merchantmen, that on the sea
did go—
The Emden filled them full of holes, and sent
them down below.
The ships of war that lacked her sore they
marked nor smoke nor light,
She sailed a phantom ship by day, a phantom
ship by night;
She sailed so fast, she sailed so far, she sailed
a ship unseen,
But by her trail of sunken ships they knew
where she had been.
And she has heard a whispered word that stole
across the sea,
(It it a word of friend or foe? Who knows
which it may be?)
“The ships that guard the wireless post, they
have sailed far away,
And Cocos lies an easy prize; swoop down and
take your prey.”
And she has rigged a funnel false, and flagless,
like a ghost,
Steals southward down the ocean-way to wreck
the wireless post;
Hull-down on the horizon’s line they saw her
smoke-trail dark,
And soon the signal S.O.S. broke from the
crackling spark.
She hears the call that speeds afar; she knows
its import well;
But yet respecting life withholds the all-
destroying shell.
Now she has reached the blue lagoon and
banks her glowing fires,
And men two score she sends ashore to wreck
the singing wires.
A wisp of smoke that trailed and broke far
off upon the lee—
“ ’Tis but some passing ocean tramp that sails
upon the sea!”
What is the tramp whose funnels smoke and
flame like mouth of hell?
The tramp that carries twenty guns and every
gun a shell!
The Emden out to battle sailed, her guns a
greeting spoke,
And rolling o’er the ocean waves the thund’ring
echoes woke;
And there they fought a running fight, those
ocean greyhounds twain,
As in the days when Drake brought low the
vaunting pride of Spain.
The Sydney’s guns have found the range, they
cut her funnels sheer,
And through her stern they drive a shell that
wrecks her steering gear;
Dense smoke in volumes eddies up, and flames
in fury roar
Along the deck; a blazing wreck, the Emden
drives ashore.
And they have seen by Comorin a grey ghost
on the sea,
That shows no light, but flies by night; ye ask
what she may be;
The sailors of the merchantmen that watch
with bated breath,
They whisper as she passes by, “The Emden
sails with Death!”
December, 1914. J. D. Burns.
THE BUDGEREE CUP.
And ’Ow We Won It.
The rain ’adn’t fallen for weeks and weeks,
The creek and the dam was dry;
And nothin’ would grow, and the stock was
low,
And the sun blazed down from the sky:
So I turns to Dad, and I ses to ’im,
“Well, wot’ll we do?” ses I.
Dad didn’t say nothin’, but all at onst
A thought seemed to strike ’im; “Bill,”
Ses ’e, “We’ll win the Budgeree Cup.”
Ses I, “Are you feelin’ ill?”
“We’ll win it,” ses ’e, determined like,
Ses I, “Per’aps you will.”
Now the Budgeree Cup is run each year,
On the course at Budgeree;
And all the people from miles around
Flock into the town to see.
And it’s worth the Cup and a hundred sovs.,
If you own the winnin’ gee.
“And wot did you mean to ride?” I arst,
Ses Dad, “We’ve got the mare.”
“Quite so,” ses I, “and who would ride?
Becos you don’t get me there?”
“I’ll ride ’er meself,” says Dad, quite quiet,
But ’e ’ad a determined air.


Now the roach-back mare is a twelve-year-old,
W’ich we use to pull the plough;
She’s blind in one eye and broken in wind,
With the make and gait of a cow;
She also jibs w’en she feels inclined,
W’ich facts I mentioned now.
But Dad ’e stuck to ’is great idea,
And ’e entered the roach-back mare;
And so the day o’ the race came round,
And didn’t the people stare,
When Dad rode up to the startin’ point,
With the same determined air.
He was wearin’ a shirt of vermillyon hue,
And tremendous spurs on ’is ’eel;
And instead of a riding-whip in ’is ’and,
’E carried the spoke of a w’eel,
For that was in case the mare should jib—
’Twas the only thing she’d feel.
W’en the barrier rose, they were off like smoke,
With Dad bringin’ up the rear;
And the rattle of the ’oofs, and a cloud of dust,
Was all I could see an’ ’ear,
But the red shirt plugged along behind,
With the first fence cornin’ near.
They raced for the jump in a strugglin’ mass,
Stickin’ together like glue,
And the whips flashed down, an’ the spurs was
red,
As the first ’uns took it true.
An’ some went over, an’ some went down,
But Dad an’ the mare went through.
The jumps came quick, an’ the field was
thinned,
But Dad got over ’em all,
Some ’e went over an’ some ’e went round,
And I thought each one a fall;
But Dad an ’the mare were in the six
That raced for the big stone wall.
The first horse took it three lengths a’ead,
But he rose jist a thought too late,
And struck with ’is knees; the second too
Was downed by the ’and of Fate.
The third an’ the fourth scraped over, the fifth
Didn’t like it, and thought ’e’d wait.
The mare came on, and I saw Dad’s face
And on it a look of pride,
An’ I ’card the spoke as it thumped ’er ribs,
She rose to the wall in ’er stride.
She’s down! she’s got it! she balanced on top,
Then slid down the other side.
Three o’ them left as they entered the straight,
With Dad four lengths in the rear;
But still ’e was usin’ the spurs an’ spoke,
And still ’e was creepin’ near;
And w’en ’e levelled the second ’orse,
I felt meself give a cheer.
Up to the leader ’e flogged the mare,
An’ I saw the glint in ’is eye,
An’ I saw ’im pull ’er further across,
An’ I ’card the jockey cry,
As the old mare bumped ’im on to the rails,
An’ then went sailin’ by.
Down in a ’eap went ’orse and man,
With the second ’orse on top;
And Dad an’ the mare went rolling on,
But still he daren’t stop;
For one ’orse was up and follerin’ ’ard,
An’ I saw ’e’d ’ave to ’op.
Up to the winnin’ post they raced,
For the mare ’ad got ’er ’ead,
The second ’orse was a long way back,
An’ the crowd was seein’ red;
But a couple o’ yards from the judge’s box
The blanketty mare stopped dead.
I jumped the rails, and I grabbed the reins,
An’ to Dad I made a sign
For ’im to ’op off, and while I pulled,
’E pushed at the mare behin’,
An’ in less than the time it takes to tell,
We ’eaved ’er across the line.
So that’s ’ow we won the Budgeree Cup,
As well as the ’undred pound:
The mare near died w’en the race was done,
But we managed to bring ’er round;
An’ w’ether we won it fair or foul,
We never as yet ’ave found.

ET NOVA ET VETERA.
Stately Eastern dromedary, plodding o’er the
desert,
Bearing without murmur ’neath the sun’s white
ray,
Bric-a-brac of ivory,
Rare and costly perfumes,
Bales of wondrous spices and silks of old
Cathay.
Pleasure-loving Georgian, of manner gay and
care-free,
Riding to hunting before the dawn of day,
Passing as he gallops
Farmers on their waggons,
Driving into London with their new-mown hay.
Boyish-looking pilot, stepping from his aero.,
Just arrived at Croydon as the mists begin to
rise,
With busy men from Paris,
Bags of mail for London,
Diplomatic messages, and photos from the skies.

ARMIES.
Hebrew hosts of Joshua from desert wandering,
Roving through the Promised Land in one
great throng,
With the ark of the covenant,
Patriarchs and fighting men,
Praises to the Lord their God in heart-felt song.


Clanking Roman legions, coming home from
Gaul,
Shaking all the country with the thunder of
their tread,
With a convoy of savages,
Slaves for the Emperor,
Spurred on with curses and with whips blood-
red.
Cavaliers riding in a gay and carefree throng,
Trotting on to Naseby full of right good cheer,
With a muster of men-at-arms,
Pikemen for Rupert’s cause,
Swordsmen fed on beef and brown Kent beer.
Stolid British infantry, moving up the line,
Battalion on battalion in the bleak wet morn,
With their rifles and Lewis-guns,
Haversacks, gas-masks,
Marching with a swing into the cold grey dawn.
Lean Australian horsemen from township, farm
and bush,
Riding at a gallop through the hot white sands,
With a joke for every burning mile,
Cracked lips and cheery smile,
Aching eyes, swollen tongue and chapp’d brown
hands.
