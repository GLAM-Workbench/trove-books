TEMPORARY OFFICE;
THE AUSTRALIAN BUILDER,” 34, QUEEN STREET.
At no period in the history of Victoria have the Fine Arts attracted so much notice as at the present time, as is shown by the
improved style of our Buildings,—the introduction of Decorative Art in their embellishment, —and the growing desire evinced by the
refined and affluent for Paintings and Sculpture to adorn their interiors. It remains then, but for the Patrons of Art, and Artists
themselves, to follow up these encouraging signs of Art progress, and the best mode which suggests itself to carry this object into prac-
tical effect is by an occasional Exhibition of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and Decorative Art. This, while it will serve as an
exponent of the Artistic talent to be met with in the Colony, may, it is hoped, be made the occasion likewise of enlisting for Art a
yet more extended and liberal patronage.


SUPPLEMENT TO THE AUSTRALIAN BUILDER.
At the request of many of the leading Architects and Artists of Melbourne, who have pledged themselves to become
Exhibitors, Me. Feank Newton, the Editor of the ‘ Australian Builder,’ has undertaken to open an Exhibition of the proposed kind,
in the early part of October.
Although such Exhibition has for its main object the development and encouragement of Colonial Art and Artists, it is
thought its success will mainly depend upon making it outrival in general interest any similar Art Exposition before attempted in
the Australian Colonies. For this reason, it is proposed to combine with the present undertaking an Exhibition of the various
meritorious productions of other than Colonial Artists, both Ancient and Modern.
Me. Newton respectfully solicits, therefore, all Gentlemen Amateurs and Artists possessed of Pictures or Statuary of
approved excellence, who may feel an interest in his present endeavour to foster and promote a taste for Art in the Colony, by
the periodical distribution of premiums to the most talented of its Professors, —to accord him permission to exhibit their several
Art productions on the forthcoming occasion, and he pledges himself that every possible care and attention shall be taken of all works
so entrusted to his charge.
The Promises of Support already received warrant a belief that the number of Art Specimens forwarded will fill the area of
the Exhibition Building: should this expectation fail to be realized, the Exhibition will take place in the Hall of the Mechanics’
Institute.
[Suggestions and Communications are earnestly invited, and will be thankfully received, if addressed to the “ Editor of
‘ The Australian Builder,’ 34 Queen Street.”]
CONDITIONS.
I.—Competitors in each separate department of Art will be required to appoint a gentleman to act upon the Jury of Award. The seven
gentlemen so selected shall decide to whom the premiums are to he paid; their decisions to he final.
2.—Every facility will he afforded Exhibitors to dispose of their pictures, &c., for which reason it will be necessary to state the price at
the time of forwarding them for exhibition.
3.—lntending exhibitors are requested to intimate their purpose as early as possible, to the “Editor of the ‘ Australian Builder,’
34, Queen Street, and likewise name the space they will require.
4—A full description should accompany the delivery of every work of Art, so that the Exhibition Catalogue may convey every necessary
information to the Visitor.
