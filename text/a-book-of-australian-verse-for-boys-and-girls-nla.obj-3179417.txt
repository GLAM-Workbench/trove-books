PREFACE
This book is intended for the boys and girls of
Australasia, as a supplement to their reading in
English poetry. Its special interest, apart from the
merit of the poems, lies in the fact that all the con-
tents either were written by Australian or New
Zealand authors, or refer to those countries, their
scenery, flowers and birds, or events in their history.
As you know, the first British people came to
live in Australia about a century and a quarter ago.
That is not a long period in the history of a nation;
in fact it may be called the time of its childhood
and early youth. The settlement of New Zealand
began at a still later date. The first things to be
done in each case were to explore the country, clear
the ground and make homes. Then the soil had
to be tilled, mines dug, railroads and harbours made.
By degrees towns and cities sprang up, and with
them came more of the pleasures and refinements
of modern civilization. Poetry and the fine arts
did not receive much attention until the nation had
grown up.
Suppose that the early settlers had brought no
books with them, and that none ever came into
the country afterwards. You may be sure that
we should not have advanced very far by this
time. No doubt the people would make songs for


themselves, and gradually some sort of literature
would arise; but it would be a very long
time before we emerged from barbarism. As it
happened, however, these colonies started with the
whole wealth of English literature at their dis-
posal. We have inherited the beauty and splendour
of as a great a literature as any the world has
known, together with all the noble traditions of the
English race. That is a priceless advantage for
us; but in young countries, so different from
the old world that we have hardly yet learned
to know them well, it meant that that literature
sufficed during the period of our childhood as a
nation. In such circumstances there was little
likelihood that any great original writers would
arise here, or that much interest would be taken
in the first literary efforts of the few who had the
time and inclination to write.
Let us suppose that one of the great English
authors, Byron, who was born in England a few
days before Governor Phillip landed at Sydney
Cove, had been brought when young to live
amongst the gum trees of Australia. It is reason-
ably certain that he would have written poetry, but
not such great poetry as that which he actually did
write; and it is not likely that his poems would
have been coloured by Australia at all. Adam
Lindsay Gordon, who came to Australia in 1853,
at the age of twenty, was a man as proud and
chivalrous as Byron. His poems are very popular
in Australia; but, with a few exceptions, they have


little of Australia in them and might have been
written anywhere. Those which do relate to Aus-
tralian life are really the beginnings of our national
literature.
The first of our native-born poets was Charles
Harpur. He derived his inspiration from books
and hardly at all from the Bush in which he lived
nearly all his life. Henry Kendall, who was born
in N.S.W. more than twenty years later than
Harpur, was greatly influenced by his surroundings.
He grew up in a pretty coastal district, and tried
to put the beauty of its flowers and birds, its trees
and rivers, into song. In that way he taught many
to appreciate beauty that had seldom been recog-
nised before.
Gordon, Kendall and Harpur are the pioneers
of our literature, and therefore deserve special
notice. They lived at a time when little interest
was taken in the production of art or literature
in Australia, and they and their work suffered from
lack of encouragement.
Since the death of Kendall in 1882 there has
been a great change in the attention paid to every-
thing Australian. No doubt it is partly due to the
fact that many more of our people are Australian
born. Our writers now find that large numbers of
their own countrymen are glad to read poems or
stories which tell something of interest about life
in Australia. In many departments of life Aus-
tralians and New Zealanders have rendered dis-


tinguished service to the world. In art and science
their work has been recognized as notable. As
soldiers they fought well in South Africa, and they
have shown splendid bravery at the Dardanelles.
This selection from the poetry of Australia and
New Zealand will serve as an introduction to the
books from which the poems are taken, and will,
it is hoped, induce its readers to take a keener
interest in all things relating to their own country.

A BOOK OF AUSTRALIAN VERSE,




AUSTRALIAN ANTHEM.
Maker of earth and sea,
What shall we render Thee?
All things are Thine!
Ours but from day to day
Still with one heart we pray,
“ God bless our land alway,”
This land of Thine.
Mighty in brotherhood,
Mighty for God and good,
Let us be Thine.
Here let the nations see
Toil from the curse set free,
Labour and Liberty
One cause —and Thine.
Here let glad Plenty reign;
Here let none seek in vain
Our help and Thine —
No heart for want of friend
Fail ere the timely end,
But love for ever blend
Man’s cause and Thine
Here let Thy peace abide;
Never may strife divide
This land of Thine,


Let us united stand,
One great Australian band,
Heart to heart, hand in hand
Heart and hand Thine.
Strong to defend our right,
Proud in all nations’ sight,
Lowly in Thine—
One in all noble fame,
Still be our path the same,
Onward in Freedom’s name,
Upward in Thine.
BRUNTON STEPHENS
THE AUSTRALIAN FLAG.
Fling out the flag—our virgin flag,
Which foeman’s shot has never rent.
And plant it high on mount and crag,
O’er busy town and lonely tent.
Where commerce rears her stately halls,
And where the miner rends the rock,
Where the sweet rain on cornfields falls,
Where pastures feed the herd and flock.
Still let it float o’er homes of peace,
Our starry cross—our glorious sign!
While Nature’s bounteous gifts increase,
And freedom’s glories brighter shine.


Brave hearts may beat in labour’s strife,
They need no spur of martial pride;
High deeds may crown a gentle life,
And spread their radiance far and wide.
Fling out the flag—and guard it well! —
O’er pleasant fields the foe ne’er trod;
Long may our guardian heroes dwell
In league with truth —in camp with God!
In other lands the patriot boasts
His standard borne through slaughter’s flood,
Which, waving o’er infuriate hosts,
Was consecrate in fire and blood.
A truer charm our flag endears;
Where’er it waves, on land or sea,
It bears no stain of blood and tears —
Its glory is its purity.
SIR HENRY PARKES
THE RIVER OF STARS.
I took a little ship last night,
She was moored to a Lotus Land,
And I warped her round,
And I went without sound
By the beach of the Lily-white Land,
And out and over the heavenly seas
Thro’ the headlands lit by the Hyades,


I sailed my little ship last night
Way down the long River of Stars,
And fast to each shroud
Was a silver cloud
For a sail on her rainbow spars.
I sailed till I saw in the farthest skies
The harbour lights of my little Love’s eyes
I’ll sail my little ship each night;
Dear heart, will you wait for me?
I’ll stand by the mast
When the moon glides past,
So my Love will be sure to see,
And light my way with her eyes agleam—
Dear port-lights lit for my ship, “The Dream
D. M. ROSS
MAGIC.
Crawling up the hillside,
Swinging round the bay,
With a ceaseless humming
Ply the trams all day.
When it’s dark I linger
Just to see the sight;
All those jewelled beetles
Flashing through the night!


Anything more lovely
I have never seen
Than the sparks above them,
White and blue and green;
Sometimes they are tiny;
In a storm they shine,
Dragons’ tongues that follow
All along the line!
When the wind has fallen,
And the bay’s like glass,
Would you see some magic?
Watch what comes to pass
There is just a ripple
Where the water breaks,
All the lamps reflected
Show like golden snakes;
Wait, the tram is coming
Round the curving shore.
And its humming changes
To a hollow roar;
There’s a flaming glory
On the bay at last,
Red and green and orange—
It has come, and passed.


Nothing breaks the stillness,
All is as before,
And the golden serpents
Quiver near the shore.
Trams are only ugly
Passing day by day,
But at night their crudeness
Vanishes away.
Some kind magic clothes them
In a fairer dress,
So that we may wonder
At their loveliness!
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
THE LARK’S SONG.
The morning is wild and dark,
The night mist runs on the vale,
Bright Lucifer dies to a spark,
And the wind whistles up for a gale.
And stormy the day may be
That breaks through its prison bars,
But it brings no regret to me,
For I sing at the door of the stars!
Along the dim ocean-verge
I see the ships labouring on;
They rise on the lifting surge
One moment, and then are gone.


I see on the twilight plain
The flash of the flying cars;
Men travail in joy or pain—
But I sing at the door of the stars!
I see the green, sleeping world,
The pastures all glazed with rime;
The smoke from the chimney curled;
I hear the faint church bells chime.
I see the grey mountain crest,
The slopes and the forest spars,
With the dying moon on their breast —
While I sing at the door of the stars!
ANNE GLENNY WILSON
A CRICKETING SONG.
Here’s to the Batsman of vigilant eye,
Safe, tho’ the wickets are falling,
Letting no shadow of chance go by,
And never a duffer in calling;
Let the toast go,
Cricketers know
Who can astonish the lobs of the foe.
Here’s to the Bowler who’s cunning of hand,
Master of dodges seductive,
Whether his ball disappear in the Stand,
Or turn out a trimmer destructive;
Let the toast go,
Cricketers know
Who can demolish the stumps of the foe.


Here’s to the Fielder of quicksilver wrist,
Fast to the wicket returning,
Who from the catches, taken or missed,
Ever a lesson is learning;
Let the toast go,
Cricketers know
Who can make sure of a chance from the foe
Here’s to the Cricketer cheery and bright,
Who never is down on his luck, sir,
Who cares for the game, and to play it aright,
Far more than a score or a duck, sir.
Let the toast go,
Cricketers know
How they should welcome and honour a foe.
JAMES L. CUTHBERTSON.
THE WAGTAIL.
Blithe sing the birds in England when the April
lawns are wet,
But I know a Bushland bird
The echo of whose modest note is harder to forget
Than any song I’ve heard.
Ere the shadows scarce had parted to the slender
silver gleam
Of the Dawn Witch on the dark,
Came a chirp beneath my window breaking softly
on my dream
And calling to me, ‘'Hark!


‘The Bush is ware and waking, every spider’s on
his thread
And spinning in the dew,
Every leaf is out of shadow, every bird has left its
bed;
All the world’s awake but you!”
And leaning from my window I would listen and
look down,
And there upon the sand
See the cheery little wagtail in his suit of white and
brown
Nodding weight to his command.
So the jingling spurs were buckled and the legging
straps were drawn,
And the door-latch jarred.
And “Cheer up! Cheer up! Cheer up!” sang the
wagtail in the dawn,
As I hurried to the yard.
How the stock-whip woke the morning! How the
racing bare hoofs rang!
How the spurs drank red!
How the heavy rails shot homeward with a merry
closing clang
On the caged mob’s tread!
While they whinnied to each other, while their busy
lean heads tossed.
The sudden sun outburst.


And the magpies carolled madly, but the flitting
wagtail crossed,
Chirping, “ I called him first!”
Blithe sing the birds in England when the April
lawns are wet,
But I know a Bushland bird
Whose modest meed of music it is harder to forget
Than any song I’ve heard!
WILL H. OGILVIE.
SPRING SONG.
Sing out and be happy!
The spring is at hand,
The grass green, and sappy
The trees o’ the land.
Sing! for the breeze is
Rustling and silky,
And toys with and teases
Long blossoms and milky.
Sing out! for the bees in
Their quest of wild honey
Are haunting the trees in
Green places and sunny.
Sing out! and let trouble
Another pursue:


It will burst like a bubble,
And vanish for you.
RODERIC QUINN.
MY GIFT.
I had a lovely gift to-day
Delivered bright and early,
The heart of it was heavenly blue,
Its edges pale and pearly.
A turquoise, set in living gold,
So flawless and so splendid,
It seemed to be of fire and dew
Miraculously blended.
And ere I knew my need of it,
Or had presumed to ask it,
’Twas chosen by a connoisseur
From an imperial casket.
And when along the quickening east
A wave of light was breaking,
’Twas softly laid outside my door,
To greet me on awaking.
A royal gift! Its only plea
That I should freely take it; —
A summer day, from dawn to dusk,
Perfect as God could make it.
AGNES L. STORRIE.


PICTURES.
Rushes and heather around me,
A grim, grey rock behind,
And a tall, young gum tree tossing
Its red plumes in the wind,
Like a prince in dark green dressed,
With a waving crimson crest.
A small, clear pool below me,
Between two rocky isles,
With its sunlit face a-quiver
With flashing golden smiles—
Then with mimic rage and din
A small, white wave comes laughing in.
Three bare-legged lads a-fishing,
With loud and earnest glee;
Like echoes from my boyhood
Their voices sound to me,
Far across the wasted years,
And mine eyes are filled with tears.
White sails on the blue water,
White wings in the blue air,
And the sun for pleasure shining,
and beauty everywhere:
These are now the sights I see—
And the world goes well with me.
VICTOR J. DALEY


THE FAIRIES’ AIRSHIP.
Have you seen the thistledown, floating thro’ the air
When the grasses’ flags are still with no wind to
spare ?
Leaning on your window-sill, never guessing that
’Tis a pixie airship with its aeronaut!
Drifting by the kurrajong, white against the blue,
By the yucca’s sword points deftly passing thro’,
If your eyes were keener, you so fancy-blind,
You would know why thistles move without the
wind!
“ Four-o’clock’s ” you call them, loosened from the
stem,
Puffing with an idle mouth, telling time on them!
Fairies, more ambitious, snatch them from your lips,
Manning them and making brave aerial ships.
See the dahlia nodding—that’s a stage where they
Paused to fix the rudder ere they sailed away,
And that spike of carex, lifting green and stark,
Is a signal station for the fairies’ barque!
O! the sights they follow, ether-sailor men!
I could never tell them with a mortal pen,
How they found the rainbow, bathed themselves in
light,
Shrivelled on a star-spark, dropping thro’ the night!


Had a bout with gad-flies, maddened by the Spring,
Dodged the hurtling feather from a wild swan’s
wing,
Cannoned off a raindrop, flying to the right,
Just escaped a moon-shaft, spearing thro’ the night.
Have you watched the thistledown floating thro’
the air
When the leaves are silent with no breeze to spare.
Peering thro’ your window, never guessing that
’Twas a pixie airship with its aeronaut?
M. FORREST.
RONA IN THE MOON.
A Maori Legend.
Rona, Rona, sister olden,—
Rona in the moon!
You’ll never break your prison golden,—
Never, late or soon!
Rona, for her crying daughter,
At the dead of night
Took the gourd and went for water;
Went without a light.
There she heard the owlets wrangle
With an angry hoot;
Stick and stone and thorny tangle
Wounded Rona’s foot.


“Boil the moon!” she said in passion;
“ Boil your lazy head!
Hiding thus in idle fashion
In your starry bed!”
Angry was the moon in heaven;
Down to earth she came —
“ Stay you ever unforgiven
For the word of shame!
Up! —you made the moon a byword—
Up and dwell with me!”
Rona felt the drawing skyward,—
Seized a ngaio tree.
But from earth the ngaio parted
Like a bitten thread;
Like a comet upward darted
Rona overhead.
In the moon is Rona sitting,
Never to be free;
With the gourd she held in flitting,
And the ngaio tree.
You’ll never break your prison golden,—
Never, late or soon,
Rona, Rona, sister olden, —
Rona in the moon!
JESSIE MACKAY


“FOLLOW, FOLLOW ME.”
Rona in the Springtime plucked the snowy flowers,
Made a crown to crown her queen beneath the
rata tree,
When there came a pattering of feet like August
showers,
And a pretty music-song of “ Follow, follow me.”
Rona, with the snowy blooms in her golden tresses,
Heard the little people, and she followed all the
day.
“ Oh, and what will mother say if she only guesses
How the pretty fairies came and whispered me
away?”
Down among the feather fern, down among the
mosses,
Up again across the streams, and by the river’s
brim,
Where the saucy toi-toi all her soft hair tosses
At the laughing water-bubble, after kissing him.
On the music wandered, all through the dark and
brightness,
And Rona tried to catch it where the fuchsia
berries grew,
Sure she saw the glimmer of a little bonnet’s white-
ness,
And in among the branches a little skirt of blue.


Down among the glossy green, beside the brooklet,
singing,
Over mossy boulders, and past the big white pine,
Once, she came so near them, she heard their arm-
lets ringing,
And she saw the pretty jewels on their fairy
fingers fine.
, All the day she followed them, and when the stars
came peeping,
Ldiilv
She saw their lamp-lights moving about in merry
J pW-
“ Oh, and what will mother say when all the house
2 is sleeping,
And she knows the pretty fairies have taken me
away?”
Down the soft brown shadow-way, and up the
IL moonbeam tripping,
j; Across the bridge of morning, far and far from
mother’s knee.
Stepping on the clouds and stars with never fear of
$ slipping,
Z She heard the pretty music-song of “ Follow
follow me!”

THE WATTLE IS A LADY.
The Wattle is a lady, in her yellow satin gown,
The Gum-Tree is a gentleman, with suit of green
and brown.


The Hakea is a cross-patch, and he’ll scratch you
if he can,
The Cabbage Tree’s a vain coquette, with every leaf
a fan.
The Christmas Bells are tell-tales, for they whisper
in the breeze;
Tecoma’s very lazy, for she sprawls and takes her
ease;
Lambertia is a soldier, in his straight spiked coat
of red;
Grevillea is an acrobat; see how his arms are spread.
A pale bride is Clematis, with her wreath so waxy
white,
Hibbertia is a little girl, with face so round and
bright;
Wild Violet is a baby shy, the sweetest ever seen
And Waratah with crown of red is a tall and stately
queen.

A BALLAD OF THE ROAD.
It knows the never-sleeping lanes
Where sunless creatures dwell;
The iron-welded doors of wealth
The old road knoweth well.
It hears the sun-browned sailors speak
The tongues of many climes.
And hour by hour its stones give back
The note of city chimes.


It knows the commerce-crowded quay,
The traffic of the mart,
It threads a lean and crabbed course
Across the city’s heart.
And where are lawns and bowered trees
And villas row by row,
It wound through virgin wilderness
A hundred years ago.
Where league by league to west it lies,
In smoke and evening haze.
I love to people it with ghosts
Of old Colonial days.
Lo! here among the mighty boles
The firelight flickered red,
And wreathing low beneath the boughs
The evening camp smoke spread.
And here, where sun and shadows knit
Their spell by dip and stream,
With cracking whip and haze of dust,
Crept on the lumbering team.
Where meeting o’er the narrow track,
The giant trees encroach,
Bold Donohoe and comrades twain
Held up the Sydney coach.


I hear the tramp of shackled feet,
With shuffling tread and slow,
The clank of merry cavalcades—
A hundred years ago.
And here, where broad and timbered parks
Still shelter massive walls,
Were twinkling casements all aglow,
And gaily lighted halls;
And sound of music and of dance,
With festival and glow,
And coaches bore their silken freights—
A hundred years ago.
I hear across the evening air,
The traffic’s constant hum,
The murmur of the busy wheels,
The feet that go and come.
And where the many churches raise
Their spiry needles high,
I see the glare of Sydney’s lights
Along the eastern sky.
And through the rustling garden palms,
That never more are still,
I see the golden lights align
The path of Taverner’s Hill.


By wood and waste, in sun and shine,
The gray road wanders down,
And finds its goal among the hills —-
A little, old, grey town.
ELLA McFADYEN.
OVER THE RANGE.
Little bush maiden, wondering-eyed,
Playing alone in the creek-bed dry,
In the small green flat on every side
Walled in by the Moonbi ranges high,
Tell us the tale of your lonely life,
Mid the great grey forests that know no change.
“ I never have left my home,” she said,
“ I have never been over the Moonbi Range.
“ Father and mother are both long dead,
And I live with granny in yon wee place.”
“Where are your father and mother?” we said.
She puzzled awhile with thoughtful face,
Then a light came into the shy brown eye,
And she smiled, for she thought the question
strange
On a thing so certain—“ When people die
They go to the country over the range.”
“ And what is this country like, my lass?”
“ There are blossoming trees and pretty flowers,
And shining creeks where the golden grass
Is fresh and sweet from the summer showers.


They never need work, nor want, nor weep;
No troubles can come their hearts to estrange
Some summer night I shall fall asleep,
And wake in the country over the range.”
Child, you are wise in your simple trust,
For the wisest man knows no more than you.
Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust:
Our views by a range are bounded too;
But we know that God hath this gift in store,
That, when we come to the final change.
We shall meet with our loved ones gone before
To the beautiful country over the range.
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON
AN AUSTRALIAN CRADLE SONG.
Over the hills and far away,
Deep in a shady dell,
The crystal fountains leap and play;
A dream of delight is the live-long day,
Over the hills and far away
In the land where the fairies dwell.
Never a trouble or worldly care
Into that dell may come;
The sweetest flowers breathe perfume rare,
The wattle-tree loosens her golden hair,
And softly floats on the languid air
The wild bees’ drowsy hum.


The tall fern spreads a graceful wing
To shut the light away;
And ever the fountains laugh and sing,
The moss and the maiden-hair climb and cling
And the bell-birds’ note doth sweetly ring,
Like the drip of the silver spray.
So hush thee, hush, my baby boy,
Let slumber weave her spell,
And you shall roam till break of day
Where the laughing fountains leap and play,
Over the hills and far away,
In the land where the fairies dwell.
JOHN HARRISON WAGNER.
NINE YEARS OLD.
Nine years old to-day, laddie,
What an age to grow!
Quite a man you are, dearie,
Very well I know.
Knickerbockers soon, laddie,
Must be laid away
Far too young for you, dearie,
Nine years old to-day!
I remember well, darling,
When you used to lie,
Baby eyes wide open
To the sunny sky.


How the sunbeams glinted
O’er your golden hair.
Ne’er was baby brother
Half so sweet and fair!
And as summers gathered
On that curly head,
How you loved to frolic
On the grass instead!
Scorned was baby’s cradle,
Scorned were baby’s shoes.
Oh, you were so ready
Baby’s days to lose!
Then one day, my darling,
Golden curls were shorn;
What a chubby head was left
Looking so forlorn!
Baby boy no longer.
How I watched you bound
With those handsome, sturdy
Flying o’er the ground!
Now with book and pencil
To the school you go,
Guarded by the brother
That you worship so.
Funny letters reach me,
Round-eyed pot-hooks wide.
Which I lay, with baby curls,
Carefully aside.


Blotted, boyish letters,
Sweetly incomplete!
Never friend or lover
Could with these compete!
Clumsy “ hooks ” and “ hangers ”
Falling all apart,
Yet so cunning, darling,
They can hold my heart.
Rupert, little brother,
Baby boy no more,
Every year has made you
Dearer than before!
Take this message, darling,
From one far away
Thinking of her laddie,
Nine years old to-day!
JENNINGS CARMICHAEL.
A TREMBLING STAR.
There is my little trembling star,” she said.
I looked; once more
The tender sea had put the sun to bed,
And heaven’s floor
Was grey.
And nowhere yet in all that young night sky
Was any star
But one that hung above the sea, not high,
Nor very far
Away.


• I watch it every night,” she said, and crept
Within my arm.
“ Soft little star, I wish the angels kept
It safe from harm
Alway.
I know it is afraid,” she said; her eyes
Held a sweet tear.
They send it all alone into the skies,
No big stars near
To play.
They push it out before the sweet, kind moon
Lights up the sea,
They laugh because it fears the dark. ‘Soon, soon,
You’ll braver be,’
They say.
“ One night I climbed far up that high white tree
Beside the beach,
And tried to stretch my hand across the sea
And tried to reach
The grey.
For something made me feel my heart would break
Unless that night
I in my hand my trembling star could take
And kiss its fright
Away.


“ There only blew a strange wind chillily,
And clouds were swept.
The angels would not let my own star see
That someone wept.
I pray
“ To Christ, who hears my little prayers each night,
That He will seek
Through all His skies for that sweet, frightened
light,
And stoop His cheek
And say—
“ ‘ My angels must not send so frail a thing
To light the West.
Lift up the little trembling star to cling
About my breast
Alway.’ ”
ETHEL TURNER,
THE WIND-CHILD.
My folk’s the wind-folk, it’s there I belong,
I tread the earth below them, and the earth does me
wrong,
Before my spirit knew itself, before this frame un-
furled,
I was a little wandering breeze and blew about the
world.
The winds of the morning that breathe against my
cheek
Are kisses of comfort from a love too great to speak;


The whimpering airs that cry by night and never
find their rest
Are sobbing to be taken in and soothed upon my
breast,
The storm through the mountains, the tempest from
the sea,
That ride their cloudy horses and take no thought
of me,
They are my noble brothers that hasten to the fight.
They fill my heart with singing, they fill my eyes
with light,
They’re a shield upon my shoulder, a sword by my
side,
A battle cry for weariness,—and a plume of pride.
But sometimes in the moonlight, when the moon is
in the west,
Young and strange and virginal and dropping to
her rest,
There comes a wind from out the south, a little
chill and thin,
And draws me from the human warmth that houses
it within.
My soul streams forth to follow a soul that lures
it on,
The sleepy flesh calls kin to it, and murmurs to be
gone;
Across the dreaming dewy flowers and through the
shadowy trees
The sweet insistent whisper comes, and I am ill at
ease.


How, they have not told me, and where, I do not
know,
But the wind-folk is my folk, and some day I’ll go.
ENID DERHAM.
AFTER THE BATTLE.
I can hear them call, but I cannot go,
For my eyes are red. I will creep
Down here, where the wattle is hanging low,
And hide me safe while I weep.
Spread out your skirts for me, Wattle dear;
Shake all your gold veil round,
Or the other children will wander here,
And I, red-eyed, shall be found.
Oh, Wattle, Wattle! My heart will break!
Let me rest my head on your knee;
On your gentle knee my shamed head take,
Shed one golden tear on me.
We were soldiers, Wattle, the boys and I,
And we marched in the garden there;
And we shouted and sang, for our hearts were high
With our victories everywhere.
Oh, we are as glad and gay as you,
Dear Wattle, are when you fling
Your yellow head backwards, and shake the dew
From your hair, and sway and sing.


And we crashed and dashed as we won the heights
Of every bank on the lawn,
And we panted for fiercer and fiercer fights,
That should see our flag up-borne.
And a sortie we made through a break in the fence
To the paddock that slopes away,
Half-hidden in grass, to the trees, and thence
To the sun, where he dies each day.
Half-hidden in grass—ah, in poppies, too!
The poppies flame thick and wild,
And they dance, and they laugh, and they nod at
you,
And kiss you—if you’re a child.
“The foe! The foe!” cried the boys. “The foe!”
And into the midst we plunged;
And here and there at each startled row
With our wooden swords we lunged.
And with shouts and cheers and our flag awave
We cut them down where they stood;
The white a-tremble, the pink more brave,
And the red dyed deep in blood.
Then the battle ebbed, and it died away,
Like a wave on a worn sea-shore;
And the boys rushed off to a further fray,
And I was alone once more.


Alone with the fire gone out of my heart—
I am only a girl, you know —
And something was making me slow to start
From the field of the fallen foe.
And I wandered back to the golden grass,
Where the wind hung sad and still,
And it mournfully parted to let me pass,
And I stood, with my heart a-thrill.
So still they lay, so still at my feet,
That had danced and laughed like mad,
That had touched my cheeks with their mouths so
sweet, —
So still, so meek, so sad!
Dead at my feet—at my feet quite dead!
And I—l helped to slay
The piteous pink ones, the startled red,
And the white that had been at play.
Spread out your skirts for me, Wattle dear,
Shake all your gold veil round,
Or the other children will wander here,
And I, red-eyed, shall be found.
Oh, Wattle, Wattle! My heart will break!
Let me rest my head on your knee;
On your gentle knee my shamed head take,
Shed one golden tear on me.
ETHEL TURNER.


WHERE THE PELICAN BUILDS.
The horses were ready, the rails were down,
But the riders lingered still —
One had a parting word to say,
And one had his pipe to fill.
Then they mounted, one with a granted prayer,
And one with a grief unguessed.
“We are going,” they said as they rode away,
“ Where the pelican builds her nest!”
They had told us of pastures wide and green,
To be sought past the sunset’s glow;
Of rifts in the ranges by opal lit;
And gold ’neath the river’s flow.
And thirst and hunger were banished words
When they spoke of that unknown West;
No drought they dreaded, no flood they feared,
Where the pelican builds her nest!
The creek at the ford was but fetlock deep
When we watched them crossing there;
The rains have replenished it thrice since then,
And thrice has the rock lain bare.
But the waters of Hope have flowed and fled,
And never from blue hill’s breast
Come back—by the sun and the sands devoured—
Where the pelican builds her nest.

There is a land where summer skies
Are gleaming with a thousand dyes,
Blending in witching harmonies;
And grassy knoll and forest height
Are flushing in the rosy light,
And all above is azure bright,
Australia! Australia! Australia!
There is a land where honey flows,
Where laughing corn luxuriant grows,
Land of the myrtle and the rose;
On hill and plain the clustering vine
Is gushing out with purple wine,
And cups are quaffed to thee and thine,
Australia! Australia! Australia!
There is a land where treasures shine,
Deep in the dark unfathom’d mine,
For worshippers at Mammon’s shrine;
Where gold lies hid, and rubies gleam,
And fabled wealth no more doth seem
The idle fancy of a dream.
Australia! Australia! Australia!
There is a land where homesteads peep
From sunny plain and woodland steep,
And love and joy bright vigils keep;
Where the glad voice of childish glee
Is mingling with the melody
Of Nature’s hidden minstrelsy.
Australia! Australia! Australia!


There is a land where floating free
From mountain top to girdling sea
A proud flag waves exultingly;
And Freedom’s sons the banner bear,
No shackled slave can breathe the air,
Fairest of Britain’s daughters fair,
Australia! Australia! Australia!
Mrs. C. J. CARLETON
CAPTAIN COOK.
O’er waves that rolled in wild unrest
The dauntless sailor came,
And land and sea conspiring blest
The seed-time of his fame.
And drifted down the alien straits
He saw, in dreams sublime,
The lands swing wide their golden gates
To meet the march of Time.
He saw the vision of the years
In glory bright unfurled;
The vanward march of pioneers
Across a waiting world;
The rudiments of empire set
To nature’s harmonies,
Where ling’ring spring and summer met
Above the laughing seas.


Great Captain, o’er the misty sweep
Of years we still discern
Thy brave Endeavour of the deep
The mystic waters churn.
The rapture of that radiant time
Which through thy triumph rolled,
And bless thee for thy faith sublime
In those brave days of old.
O, still be ours through mighty years
The glory of thy name,
And far be that dead year which bears
No flower of all thy fame.
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA.
ANNIVERSARY DAY.
Drifting like some lost ship into the night
Goes that brave day, so many days agone,
When first our skies of gold and azure shone
Upon the sails of Phillip. Stirring sight —
The fleet, that burst of seabirds, flashing white
Between the cliffs, whose bold grey bastion
Opened before them, leading on and on,
Unto that little cove of jewelled light.
How would his heart have weightened who had
borne
The weary southward way, to find his cruise
But second to our gallant foe of France,


And see, like some proud star that climbs the morn
Against the waves of our blue bay advance,
Floating, the alien flag of La Perouse!
GEORGE C. WHITNEY.
PIONEERS.
We are the old-world people,
Ours were the hearts to dare;
But our youth is spent, and our backs are bent,
And the snow is on our hair.
Back in the early fifties,
Dim through the mists of years,
By the bush-grown strand of a wild strange land
We entered—the Pioneers.
Our axes rang in the woodlands,
Where the gaudy bush-birds flew,
And we turned the loam of our new-found home,
Where the eucalyptus grew.
Housed in the rough log shanty,
Camped in the leaking tent,
From sea to view of the mountains blue,
Where the eager fossickers went.
We wrought with a will unceasing,
We moulded, and fashioned, and planned,
And we fought with the black, and we blazed the
track,
That ye might inherit the land.


Here are your shops and churches,
Your cities of stucco and smoke;
And the swift trains fly, where the wild cat’s cry
O’er the sad bush silence broke.
Take now the fruit of our labour.
Nourish and guard it with care;
For our youth is spent, and our backs are bent,
And the snow is on our hair.
FRANK HUDSON
THE DAYLIGHT IS DYING.
The daylight is dying
Away in the west,
The wild birds are flying
In silence to rest;
In leafage and frondage
Where shadows are deep,
They pass to its bondage—
The kingdom of sleep.
And watched in their sleeping
By stars in the height,
They rest in your keeping,
Oh, wonderful night!
When night doth her glories
Of starshine unfold,
’Tis then that the stories
Of bushland are told.


Unnumbered I hold them
In memories bright,
But who could unfold them,
Or read them aright?
Beyond all denials
The stars in their glories
The breeze in the myalls
Are part of these stories.
The waving of grasses,
The song of the river
That sings as it passes
For ever and ever.
The hobble-chains’ rattle,
The calling of birds,
The lowing of cattle
Must blend with the words
Without these, indeed, you
Would find it ere long,
As though I should read you
The words of a song
That lamely would linger
When lacking the rune.
The voice of the singer,
The lilt of the tune.
But, as one half-hearing
An old-time refrain,
With memory clearing,
Recalls it again.
These tales, roughly wrought
The bush and its ways.


May call back a thought of
The wandering days.
And, blending with each
In the mem’ries that throng,
There haply shall reach
You some echo of song.
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON
WESTERN HEROES.
Smiled at and often set at nought,
Slighted and sometimes scorned,
O, comrades! ye have dared and fought
Unpraised and unadorned!
No medals here “ For Valour” speak.
No bars your breast emboss;
A bit of bronze on brow and cheek
Is your Victoria Cross!
When Death comes close with fingers cold.
If I leave thousands ten,
I’ll bid them mould of beaten gold
A cross for Western men;
For every splendid rescue made
From flood and thirst and fire,
For those who give their gallant aid
In friendship, not in hire.
And, pride of all the watching fair
At Western ball and show,
These men shall wear their honours rare
That all the world may know


There is no need for our brave breed
To fight across the foam,
Since men may do a gallant deed,
A bridle-length from home.
WILL H. OGILVIE.
WARATAH AND WATTLE.
Though poor and in trouble I wander alone,
With a rebel cockade in my hat;
Though friends may desert me, and kindred disown,
My country will never do that!
You may sing of the Shamrock, the Thistle and
Rose,
Or the three in a bunch if you will;
But I know of a country that gathered all those,
And I love the great land where the Waratah grows,
And the Wattle-bough blooms on the hill.
Australia! Australia! so fair to behold—
While the blue sky is arching above;
The stranger should never have need to be told,
That the Wattle-bloom means that her heart is of
gold.
And the Waratah red blood of love.
Australia! Australia! most beautiful name,
Most kindly and bountiful land;
I would die every death that might save her from
shame,
If a black cloud should rise on the strand;


But whatever the quarrel, whoever her foes,
Let them come! Let them come when they will!
Though the struggle be grim, ’tis Australia that
knows
That her children shall fight while the Waratah
grows,
And the Wattle blooms out on the hill.
HENRY LAWSON.
UP COUNTRY.
Beyond the yellow levels.
The belt of dark belar
That edges the horizon,
There is a land afar.
A land of hope and promise,
A land of sweat and toil,
A land of hidden waters,
And warm rich crumbling soil.
The burden of the summer,
That leaves the cracked earth bare.
Yet has no power to stifle
The life that slumbers there;
And, when the sky’s hard splendour
Has changed to grey again,
The cool soft grey of rain-clouds
Low hanging to the plain,
And walls of rain close round us—
Then surely at our feet
The hidden life is stirring
To waken green and sweet.


And, if we have no autumn,
As people sometimes say,
And only very seldom
We know a winter’s day—
(O, bitter wind of winter
That pierces to the bone!
We have no snow, but surely
A winter of our own) —
See how the sap is thrilling
In every growing thing!
They know not what they speak of
Who say we have no spring.
Beyond the distant skyline,
(Now pansy-blue and clear),
We know a land is waiting,
A brown land, very dear.
A land of open spaces,
Gaunt forest, treeless plain;
And if we once have loved it
We must come back again.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR
THE BLUE MOUNTAINS.
Above the ashes straight and tall,
Through ferns with moisture dripping,
I climb beneath the sandstone wall,
My feet on mosses slipping.


Like ramparts round the valley’s edge
The tinted cliffs are standing,
With many a broken wall and ledge,
And many a rocky landing.
And round about their rugged feet
Deep ferny dells are hidden
In shadowed depths, whence dust and heat
Are banished and forbidden.
The stream that, crooning to itself,
Comes down a tireless rover.
Flows calmly to the rocky shelf,
And there leaps bravely over.
Now pouring down, now lost in spray
When mountain breezes sally,
The water strikes the rock midway,
And leaps into the valley.
Now in the west the colours change,
The blue with crimson blending;
Behind the far Dividing Range
The sun is fast descending.
And mellowed day comes o’er the place.
And softens ragged edges;
The rising moon’s great placid face
Looks gravely o’er the ledges.
HENRY LAWSON


THE TRAVELLING POST OFFICE.
The roving breezes come and go, the reed beds
sweep and sway,
The sleepy river murmurs low, and loiters on its
way —
It is the land of Lots-o’-Time along the Castlereagh
The old man’s son had left the farm, he found it
dull and slow,
He drifted to the great North-west where all the
rovers go.
“He’s gone so long,” the old man said, “he’s dropped
right out of mind,
But if you’d write a line to him I’d take it very
kind;
He’s shearing here and fencing there, a kind of waif
and stray,
He’s droving now with Conroy’s sheep along the
Castlereagh.
The sheep are travelling for the grass, and travel-
ling very slow;
They may be at Mundooran now, or past the Over-
flow,
Or tramping down the black soil flats across by
Waddiwong;
But all those little country towns would send the
letter wrong,


The mailman, if he’s extra tired, would pass them
in his sleep;
It’s safest to address the note to ‘ Care of Conroy’s
sheep,’
For five and twenty thousand head can scarcely go
astray,
You write to ‘ Care of Conroy’s sheep along the
Castlereagh.’ ”
By rock and ridge and riverside the western mail
has gone
Across the great Blue Mountain Range to take that
letter on.
A moment on the topmost grade, while open fire
doors glare,
She pauses like a living thing to breathe the moun-
tain air,
Then launches down the other side across the plains
away,
To bear that note to “ Conroy’s sheep along the
Castlereagh.”
And now by coach and mailman’s bag it goes from
town to town,
And Conroy’s Gap and Conroy’s Creek have marked
it “ further down.”
Beneath a sky of deepest blue, where never cloud
abides,
A speck upon the waste of plain the lonely mailman
rides;


Where fierce hot winds have set the pine and myall
boughs a-sweep
He hails the shearers passing by for news of Con-
roy’s sheep.
By big lagoons where wild-fowl play and crested
pigeons flock,
By camp fires where the drovers ride around their
restless stock,
And past the teamster toiling down to fetch the
wool away,
My letter chases Conroy’s sheep along the Castle-
reagh.
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON.
THE MUSTER.
Come, mount ye your horses, away let us ride,
For we’ve many a mile ere the eventide;
The cattle have stray’d to the distant plain,
We must drive them in ere we draw the rein.
So we’re off, we’re off, we’re off,
With the stockwhip in our hand,
And oh, for the fun of a cattle-hunt
With a rollicking bushman band!
Across the gully and over the range,
With a plunge through a creek for a cooling change;
Now over a log or a rock we leap,
O’er hill and on level our pace we keep.


With a gallop, a gallop, a gallop,
And a jolly song on our lips,
To the tune of the hoofs and the crashing boughs
And the ringing crack of the whips.
See the wild young scrubbers come tearing in,
Then away they head, but the tail-mob win;
The horses swerve, and there’s many a spill,
But the muster goes on with a shout and a will.
With a yeh, hallo, ya-eh!
And danger full in the face,
And the rageful charge of a snorting bull
But giving zest to the chase!
“AUSTRALIE” (Mrs. Heron).
BILL, THE BULLOCK-DRIVER.
As straight and as sound as a slab without crack
Our Bill is a king in his way:
Though he camps by the side of a shingle track,
And sleeps on the bed of his dray.
A whip-lash to him is as dear as a rose
Would be to a delicate maid;
He carries his darlings wherever he goes,
In a pocket-book tattered and frayed.
The joy of a bard when he happens to write
A song like the song of his dream
Is nothing at all to our hero’s delight
In the pluck and the strength of his team.


For the kings of the earth, for the faces august
Of princes, the millions may shout;
To Bill, as he lumbers along in the dust,
A bullock’s the grandest thing out.
His four-footed friends are the friends of his choice —
No lover is Bill of your dames;
But the cattle that turn at the sound of his voice
Have the sweetest of features and names.
A father’s chief joy is a favourite son,
When he reaches some eminent goal,
But the pride of Bill’s heart is the hairy-legged one
That pulls with a will at the pole.
His dray is no living, responsible thing,
But he gives it the gender of life;
And, seeing his fancy is free in the wing,
It suits him as well as a wife.
He thrives like an Arab. Between the two wheels
Is his bedroom, where, lying up-curled.
He thinks for himself, like a sultan, and feels
That his home is the best in the world.
For, even though cattle, like subjects, will break
At times from the yoke and the band,
Bill knows how to act when his rule is at stake.
And is therefore a lord of the land.

Of course, he must dream; but be sure that his
dreams,
If happy, must compass, alas!
Fat bullocks at feed by improbable streams,
Knee-deep in improbable grass.
No poet is Bill, for the visions of night
To him are as visions of day;
And the pipe that in sleep he endeavours to light
Is the pipe that he smokes on the dray.
To the mighty, magnificent temples of God,
In the hearts of the dominant hills,
Bill’s eyes are as blind as the fire-blackened clod
That burns far away from the rills.
Through beautiful, bountiful forests that screen
A marvel of blossoms from heat —
Whose lights are the mellow and golden and green—
Bill walks with irreverent feet.
The manifold splendours of mountain and wood
By Bill like nonentities slip;
He loves the black myrtle because it is good
As a handle to lash to his whip.
And thus through the world, with a swing in his
tread,
Our hero self-satisfied goes;
With his cabbage-tree hat on the back of his head,
And the string of it under his nose.
HENRY KENDALL.


THE DRAFTING GATE.
From early dawn to evening late,
With aching, dust-filled eyes,
I swing the clicking drafting-gate
To weird, discordant cries;
While crowding down the narrow lane
The woolly torrent steers,
And manfully I stoop and strain
To read the racing ears.
Front quarter; double notch before;
Back notches, one or two;
A stranger there from Bundabore,
One here from Wangaloo.
All day the signals reel and swim
And blur upon my sight,
Until the rolling dust-clouds dim
Merge in the mists of night.
I’m far enough from Bushland now,
No sheep have I to draft,
But still I hear the weird “Wow! Wow!”
Of men and dogs at graft:
And still I feel the guiding bars
Swing over to my hand,
And hear the hoof-tap on the spars.
And taste the gritty sand.


Well, life's at best a drafting-day,
A day both long and hard,
And Joy and Sorrow, Work and Play,
Must all come through the yard;
And happiest shall the toiler fare
Who lets no dust annoy,
Who quickly swings the gate on Care
And clears the road to Joy!
WILL H. OGILVIE
THE STOCKMAN.
A bright sun and a loosened rein,
A whip whose pealing sound
Rings forth amid the forest trees
As merrily forth we bound—
As merrily forth we bound, my boys,
And, by the dawn’s pale light,
Speed fearless on our horses true
From morn till starry night.
“ Oh! for a tame and quiet herd,”
I hear some crawler cry;
But give to me the mountain mob
With the flash of their tameless eye—
With the flash of their tameless eye, my boys.
As down the rugged spur
Dash the wild children of the woods,
And the horse that mocks at fear.


There’s mischief in yon wide-horned steer,
There’s danger in yon cow;
Then mount, my merry horsemen all,
The wild mob’s bolting now—
The wild mob’s bolting now, my boys—
But ’twas never in their hides
To show the way to the well-trained nags
That are rattling by their sides.
Oh! ’tis jolly to follow the roving herd
Through the long, long summer day,
And camp at night by some lonely creek
When dies the golden ray.
Where the jackass laughs in the old gum tree,
And our quart-pot tea we sip;
The saddle was our childhood’s home,
Our heritage the whip.

ANDY’S GONE WITH CATTLE.
Our Andy’s gone to battle now
’Gainst Drought, the red marauder;
Our Andy’s gone with cattle now
Across the Queensland border.
He’s left us in dejection now;
Our hearts with him are roving.
It’s dull on this selection now,
Since Andy went a-droving.


Who now shall wear the cheerful face
In times when things are slackest?
And who shall whistle round the place
When Fortune frowns her blackest?
Oh, who shall cheek the squatter now
When he comes round us snarling?
His tongue is growing hotter now
Since Andy cross’d the Darling.
The gates are out of order now,
In storms the “ riders ” rattle;
For far across the border now
Our Andy’s gone with cattle.
Oh, may the showers in torrents fall,
And all the tanks run over;
And may the grass grow green and tall
In pathways of the drover;
And may good angels send the rain
On desert stretches sandy;
And when the summer comes again
God grant ’twill bring us Andy.
HENRY LAWSON
THE BALLAD OF THE DROVER.
Across the stony ridges,
Across the rolling plain,
Young Harry Dale, the drover,
Comes riding home again.


And well his stock-horse bears him.
And light of heart is he,
And stoutly his old pack-horse
Is trotting by his knee.
Up Queensland way with cattle
He travelled regions vast;
And many months have vanished
Since home-folk saw him last.
He hums a song of someone
He hopes to marry soon;
And hobble-chains and camp-ware
Keep jingling to the tune.
Beyond the hazy dado
Against the lower skies
And yon blue line of ranges
The homestead station lies.
And thitherward the drover
Jogs through the lazy noon,
While hobble-chains and camp-ware
Are jingling to a tune.
An hour has filled the heavens
With storm-clouds inky black
At times the lightning trickles
Around the drover’s track;
But Harry pushes onward,
His horses’ strength he tries,
In hope to reach the river
Before the flood shall rise.


The thunder from above him
Goes rolling o’er the plain;
And down on thirsty pastures
In torrents falls the rain.
And every creek and gully
Sends forth its little flood,
Till the river runs a banker.
All stained with yellow mud.
Now Harry speaks to Rover,
The best dog on the plains.
And to his hardy horses,
And strokes their shaggy manes;
“ We’ve breasted bigger rivers
When floods were at their height.
Nor shall this gutter stop us
From getting home to night!”
The thunder growls a warning,
The ghastly lightnings gleam,
As the drover turns his horses
To swim the fatal stream.
But, oh! the flood runs stronger
Than e’er it ran before;
The saddle-horse is failing,
And only half-way o’er!
When flashes next the lightning,
The flood’s grey breast is blank.
And a cattle dog and pack-horse
Are struggling up the bank.


But in the lonely homestead
The girl will wait in vain—
He’ll never pass the stations
In charge of stock again.
The faithful dog a moment
Sits panting on the bank,
And then swims through the current
To where his master sank.
And round and round in circles
He fights with failing strength,
Till, borne down by the waters,
The old dog sinks at length.
Across the flooded lowlands
And slopes of sodden loam
The pack-horse struggles onward,
To take dumb tidings home.
And mud-stained, wet, and weary,
Through ranges dark goes he;
While hobble-chains and tinware
Are sounding eerily.
The floods are in the ocean,
The stream is clear again,
And now a verdant carpet
Is stretched across the plain
But someone’s eyes are saddened,
And someone’s heart still bleeds
In sorrow for the drover
Who sleeps among the reeds.
HENRY LAWSON


SONG OF THE CATTLE HUNTERS.
While the morning light beams on the fern-matted
streams,
And the water-pools flash in its glow,
Down the ridges we fly, with a loud ringing cry —
Down the ridges and gullies we go!
And the cattle we hunt, they are racing in front,
With a roar like the thunder of waves,
As the beat and the beat of our swift horses’ feet
Start the echoes away from their caves —
As the beat and the beat
Of our swift horses’ feet
Start the echoes away from their caves.
Like the wintry shore that the waters ride o’er,
All the lowlands are filling with sound:
For swiftly we gain where the herds on the plain
Like a tempest are tearing the ground!
But we follow them hard to the rails of the yard,
Over gulches and mountain-tops grey,
Where the beat and the beat of our swift horses’ feet
Will die with the echoes away—
Where the beat and the beat
Of our swift horses’ feet
Will die with the echoes away.
HENRY KENDALL.


BLACK COCKATOO.
Black cockatoo! Black cockatoo!
Born where the mountains, hazed in blue.
The lofty gums uplift to make
The cloudlands closer for thy sake—
Spirit of Southern freedom thou,
Ranging thy way from mountain brow
Beyond the loneliest desert track
Unto the utmost “ Further Back.”
Oh, brave wild bird! from prison thrall
Never was heard thy mating-call,
For thine the soul is of the free:—
Death rather than captivity.
Oh, brothers! in the march of Time,
As higher nationward we climb,
Foster in faith, and deed, and word,
The spirit of this bushland bird.
E. S. EMERSON.
THE MAGPIES’ SONG.
Where the dreaming Tiber wanders by the haunted
Appian Way,
Lo! the nightingale is uttering a sorrow-burdened
lay;


While the olive-trees are shaking and the cypress
boughs are stirred;
Palpitates the moon’s white bosom to the sorrow
of the bird,
Sobbing, sobbing, sobbing; yet a sweeter song I
know;
Tis the magpies’ wind-blown music where the
Gippsland rivers flow.
Oh, I love to be by Bindi, where the fragrant
pastures are,
And the Tambo to his bosom takes the trembling
Evening Star,
Just to hear the magpies warble in the blue-gums
on the hill,
When the frail green flower of twilight in the sky
is lingering still,
Calling, calling, calling to the abdicating day;
Oh, they fill my heart with music as I loiter on my
way.
Oh, the windy morn at Matlock, when the last snow
wreath had gone,
And the blackwoods, robed by tardy spring, with
star-like beauty shone,
When the lory showed his crimson to the golden
blossom spread.
And the Goulburn’s grey-green mirror showed its
loving colours wed.


Chiming, chiming, chiming in the pauses of the
gale,
How the magpies’ notes came ringing down the
mountain, o’er the vale!
Oh, the noon beside the ocean when the spring tide,
landward set,
Cast ashore the loosened silver from the waves of
violet,
And the sea-god sang a love-song and the she-oak
answer made,
Came the magpies’ carol wafted down the piny
colonnade,
Trolling, trolling, trolling in a nuptial melody,
As it floated from the moaning pine to charm the
singing sea.
And the dark hour in the city, when my Love had
silent flown,
Nestling in some far-off valley to the seraphs only
known,
When the violet had no odour, and the rose no
purple bloom,
And the grey-winged vulture, Sorrow, came rustling
thro’ the gloom,
Crooning, crooning, crooning on the swaying garden
bough;
Oh, the song of hope you uttered then my heart is
trilling now.


Voice of happy shepherd chanting by a stream in
Arcady,
Seems thy song this blue-eyed morning over lilac
borne to me;
In his arms again Joy takes me, Hope with dimpling
cheek appears,
And my life seems one long lovely vale where grow
the rosy years;
Lilting, lilting, lilting; when I slumber at the last,
Let your music in the joyous wind be ever wander-
ing past.
F. S. WILLIAMSON.
HAPPY CREEK.
The little creek goes winding
Through gums of white and blue.
A silver arm
Around the farm
It flings, a lover true;
And softly, where the rushes lean,
It sings (O sweet and low)
A lover’s song,
And winds along,
How happy—lovers know!
The little creek goes singing
By maidenhair and moss,
Along its banks
In rosy ranks
The wild flowers wave and toss;


And ever where the ferns dip down
It sings (O sweet and low)
A lover’s song,
And winds along,
How happy—lovers know!
The little creek takes colour
From summer skies above;
Now blue, now gold,
Its waters fold
The clouds in closest love;
But loudly when the thunders roll
It sings (nor sweet, nor low)
No lover’s song,
But sweeps along,
How angry—lovers know!
The little creek for ever
Goes winding, winding down,
Away, away,
By night, by day,
Where dark the ranges frown;
But ever as it glides it sings,
It sings (O sweet and low)
A lover’s song,
And winds along,
How happy—lovers know!
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA


THE TELEGRAPH.
I am a child of the lightning and thunder,
Chained to the earth in the sight of my sires.
I can but watch them while rending asunder
Mountains of cloud, from my prison of wires.
Still in my kindred’s avenging defiance,
I can exult when the tempests arise;
I am the slave of the tyrants of science,
Faster than time in the light of their eyes.
Paltering and paltering and tirelessly clattering.
Snifter than ever the swift winds blow.
Clattering and clattering and tirelessly chattering.
Ever my burdens of weal and nwe.
Out from the town and the dust of the cities,
There where the streams of humanity flow,
Out where the zephyrs are droning their ditties.
Over the ranges and rivers I go.
Careless alike of the burdens I carry,
Be they of pleasure or be they of pain,
I have no leisure to weep nor to tarry,
Out through the sunshine and out through the
rain.
Paltering and paltering and tirelessly clattering.
Snifter than ever the snift winds blow.
Clattering and clattering and tirelessly chattering.
Ever my burdens of weal and woe.


Out o’er the downs where the reapers are reaping,
Scenting the air with the perfumes of hay,
Out by the towns where the sleepers are sleeping,
Over the mountains away and away.
Joy in my numbers or grief in my flashes,
Passions and feelings entrusted to me,
Fly from the heart on my dots and my dashes
Over the mountains and under the sea.
Mattering and pattering and tirelessly clattering.
Swifter than ever the swift winds blow.
Clattering and clattering and tirelessly chattering.
Ever my burdens of weal and woe.
FRANCIS KENNA.
WHERE DOES THE WINTER GO?
There goes the Winter, sulkily slinking
Somewhere behind the trees on the hill.
He caught a vision of sweet Spring prinking
In green before her mirror—the rill.
And he turned away
With his face quite grey,
And he went without ever a glance behind him
But I want to know
Which way does he go,
And does anyone ever try to find him?


IV
May Mi
Mary Gilmore




Is he caught to the sky in a burst of thunder
And tucked away in the clouds to sleep?
Or does he go down to the sea, I wonder,
And fling himself out where the waves roll deep?
Is he washed ashore
After tossings sore,
And found by fishermen, pale and dying?
On some lonely beach
Beyond human reach
Stiff and stark is poor Winter lying?
Or climbs he up, with his grey head drooping,
Yon purple mountain that hides the sun,
And stooping and rising, rising and stooping,
Digs a grave where never was one?
And then lies down
In his grey, pale gown
A prayer on his lips, and his hands together?
“ What tears will they shed
Because I am dead?
They will dance on my grave all the bright Spring
weather.”
Oh! Winter, Winter, my tears are falling,
Are you glad of the tears of a little child?
Though Spring is abroad and calling, calling,
I cling to the edge of your cloak so wild.
And I kiss your hand
And I understand,


And I smooth your poor grey head, low-lying,
Ah! I cannot sing
Just yet with the Spring
While Winter, Winter, is pale and dying.
ETHEL TURNER
JULY.
Twas Jack-o’-Winter hailed it first
But now more timid angels sing,
For what dull ear can fail to hear
Afar the fluting of the Spring?
In all free spaces of the land
A sightless flame is flickering;
Through every vein it leaps amain,
The fiery miracle of Spring.
A music ranging in the air,
A lambert light in everything;
O sweet, my sweet, the subtle heat,
The dancing light of Love and Spring!
J. LE GAY BRERETON
A-ROVING.
When the sap runs up the tree,
And the vine runs o’er the wall,
When the blossom draws the bee,
From the forest comes a call.


Wild, and clear, and sweet, and strange,
Many-tongued and murmuring
Like the river in the range—
’Tis the joyous voice of Spring!
On the boles of grey, old trees,
See the flying sunbeams play
Mystic, soundless melodies —
A fantastic march and gay;
But the young leaves hear them —hark
How they rustle, every one! —
And the sap beneath the bark
Hearing, leaps to meet the sun.
Oh, the world is wondrous fair
When the tide of life’s at flood!
There is magic in the air,
There is music in the blood;
And a glamour draws us on
To the distance, rainbow-spanned,
And the road we tread upon
Is the road to Fairyland.
Lo! the elders hear the sweet
Voice, and know the wondrous song;
And their ancient pulses beat
To a tune forgotten long;
And they talk in whispers low,
With a smile and with a sigh
Of the years of long ago,
And the roving days gone by.
VICTOR J. DALEY.


KOOKABURRA.
When the dawn creeps grey to the glad new year
And the South wakes up from its sleep,
My laughing song is the first you will hear
Wherever the south winds sweep.
No magpie, parrot, or cockatoo
Sings ever so early as I;
From morn till eve as the year runs through
I laugh as I live—or die.
Ho, ho! ha, ha! with a glad refrain
Which many mistake for scorn;
But who finds disdain in my joyous strain
Was never a poet born.
For I am Australia’s genius,
And a message for all I bring:—
As the months flit by keep your head up high.
And laugh,
Laugh,
Laugh at everything!
E. S. EMERSON.


A POEM ‘’BOUT ME.’
“ Are you really the poetry-maker,
That writes in the papers we see?
Oh, I like little poems ’bout children
Will you make a poem ’bout me?
I’m not sick, like the hospital babies,
I know I’m as strong as can be,
Can’t you write about well little people?
Please make up a poem ’bout me!
“ I am really the poetry-maker,
My darling,” I said, with a smile;
“ I can write about 1 well little people,
In verse that would stretch to a mile.
You can stand and look over my shoulder,
To say what I’ve written is true;
Hold the sheet with your fat little finger—
I’m writing a poem ’bout you.”
“ There’s a certain small girl in the city,
Her face is as round as a rose;
She has curled, sunny hair, all a-tangle,
Blue eyes, and a snub little nose;
Rosy lips has this dear little maiden,
The reddest of cheeks ever seen,
And the brownest of wee, dimpled fingers
I see they are not over clean!


“ Now, this dear little girl in the city,
(Her face is as round as a rose),
Tears most terrible rents in her dresses,
And wears all her shoes at the toes.
Listen, reader, I’ll tell you a secret,
Of what this small lady can do.
Now, my dear little midget, stand steady,
I’m writing a poem ’bout you.
“ Up the biggest old gum in the garden
Those worn little slippers can climb.
Oh, yes, say all about the tame ’possum
I got for the children that time.
And do tell how the fat gander chased me,
’Till I was as scared as could be—
You are really a good poetry-maker—
I do like this poem ’bout me!
“ Say the puppies got into the garden,
And spoilt all the plants that I set;
Tell how Kitty’s poor dolly was ruined
Through being left out in the wet.
And you might as well say I’m not speaking
To Nellie or Millicent Fife;
They are truly the horridest children
I ever played with in my life.
Put in all about Alec’s new pony—
I’m going to ride him some day;
And the cat with the snowy white kittens.
That mother is giving away;


And say, too, we have got a retriever,
That swims like a fish in the sea —
Oh, I think you are getting on grandly;
This is a nice poem ’bout me!”
So I write in the sunshiny morning,
My dear little friend at my side,
With her pretty lips rosily parted,
The clear childish eyes open wide;
And I pray that her innocent sweetness
Unspoilt and unsullied may be,
That no future may mock the soft query,
“ Can you make a poem ’bout me?”
JENNINGS CARMICHAEL
TO A WATER WAGTAIL.
Merry, babbling, restless bird!
All day long thy voice is heard.
Be it wet, or be it fine,
Winter frost, or summer shine,
Autumn brown, or bloomy spring,
Thou art ever chattering.
Let me wander where I will,
Still I hear thy noisy bill.
If afar ’tis mine to stray
Down some creek’s meandering way
Where the graceful wattle showers
O’er the stream her yellow flowers.


And the fair clematis twines
Round the whisp’ring casuarines—
There with thy glad mate art thou,
Gossiping upon a bough.
There in spring thou lovest best
To build thy little cup-like nest,
In the shade, upon a limb
Just above the water’s brim.
Often have I ventured nigh,
Its tiny spotted eggs to spy:
Often for that liberty
Hast thou soundly scolded me.
Thou at milking time each day
Dost thy various antics play,
In thy suit of white and black.
On some old sedate cow’s back.
Hopping with a dainty tread
First to tail and then to head;
Stopping now, as though thou’dst say,
“If I’m heavy, tell me, pray!”
Minstrel of the solitudes
Of our boundless Austral woods,
Spirit of each stream and glen,
Lover of the homes of men.
Chatter on in ceaseless joy;
None will harm thee or annoy;
For thy fearless, happy ways
Win our hearts and cheer our days
JAMES THOMAS


THE LAST OF HIS TRIBE.
He crouches, and buries his face on his knees,
And hides in the dark of his hair;
For he cannot look up to the storm-smitten trees.
Or think of the loneliness there —
Of the loss and the loneliness there.
The wallaroos grope through the tufts of the grass,
And turn to their coverts for fear;
But he sits in the ashes and lets them pass
Where the boomerangs sleep with the spear —
With the nullah, the sling, and the spear.
Uloola, behold him! The thunder that breaks
On the tops of the rocks with the rain,
And the wind which drives up with the salt of the
lakes,
Have made him a hunter again—
A hunter and fisher again.
For his eyes have been full with a smouldering
thought;
But he dreams of the hunts of yore,
And of foes that he sought, and of fights that he
fought
With those who will battle no more—
Who will go to the battle no more.


It is well that the water which tumbles and fills
Goes moaning and moaning along;
For an echo rolls out from the sides of the hills,
And he starts at a wonderful song—
At the sounds of a wonderful song.
And he sees through the rents of the scattering fogs
The corrobboree warlike and grim,
And the lubra who sat by the fire on the logs,
To watch, like a mourner, for him—
Like a mother and mourner for him.
Will he go in his sleep from these desolate lands,
Like a chief, to the rest of his race,
With the honey-voiced woman who beckons, and
stands,
And gleams like a Dream in his face—
Like a marvellous Dream in his face?
HENRY KENDALL.
THE FILLING OF THE SWAMPS.
Hurrah for the storm-clouds sweeping!
Hurrah for the driving rain!
The dull earth out of her sleeping
Is wakened to life again.
There are mirrors of crystal shining
Whenever the cloud-wrack breaks,
And grass-clad banks are twining
A wreath for the fairy lakes—
Lakes that are links in an endless chain
For the water is out in the swamps again!


Hurrah for the red-gums standing
So high on the range above!
Hurrah for the she-oaks bending
So low to the wave they love!
Hurrah for the reed-stems slender!
Hurrah for the shade they fling,
For the curve of the cygnet’s splendour,
The sheen of the black duck’s wing!
Hurrah for the clouds and the glorious rain—
The water is out in the swamps again!
Hurrah for the laughing water,
The songs that the streamlets sing!
Whish! the teal duck’s mate has sought her
With a stroke of his mottled wing!
Hurrah for the deepening shadows,
The ibises eagle-eyed,
The dash of the purple swallows
To bury their breasts in the tide!
Woe! it is woe to the Drought-King’s reign?
The water is out in the swamps again!
WILL H. OGILVIE
A KING IN EXILE.
O the Queen may keep her golden
Crown and sceptre of command!
I would give them both twice over
To be King of Babyland.


Sure, it is a wondrous country
Where the beanstalks grow apace,
And so very near the moon is
You could almost stroke her face.
And the dwellers in that country
Hold in such esteem their King,
They believe that if he chooses
He can do—just anything!
And, although his regal stature
May be only four-feet-ten,
Think him tallest, strongest, bravest,
Noblest, wisest, best of men.
Ah, how fondly I remember
The good time serene and fair.
In the bygone years when I, too,
Was a reigning monarch there!
But my subjects they discrowned me
When they’d older, colder, grown;
And they took away my sceptre,
And upset my royal throne.
Yet, although a King in Exile,
Without subjects to command,
I am glad at heart to think I
Once was King of Babyland.
VICTOR J. DALEY


MERRYMIND.
Merrymind, Merrymind, whither art thou roaming?
Merrymind, Merrymind, nay, art thou sleeping
yet?
Oh, to us, sweet minstrel dear, wilt thou not be
homing?
Or we shall forget.
Vale of toil so waste and drear, hear him now
advancing,
Playing on the golden strings, the midnight
maiden’s boon;
Breaks the sunshine on the hills, the princess falls
to dancing
In a bridal noon!
Oh, the joyfulness and kissing of that fiddle’s flow-
ings,
Giving rest and happiness, and laughter delicate!
Fling out from this iron world to his merry bowings,
Oh, be not too late!
Lancelot, Lancelot, ride with song and gleaming,
Robin, wind in greenwood shaw thy dreaming
silvery horn,
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down thy hair a-beaming,
Yellow as the corn!


Pride, begone, thou hateful curse of narrowed blood
and breeding,
Cruel growth of heaviness and dull, cold
ignorance;
Come, thou golden Charity, lend to us thy leading
In a sunny dance!
JAMES HEBBLETHWAITE.
LITTLE 80-PEEP.
Little 80-Peep
In her baby sleep
Lies like a fairy flower,
And she breathes as low
As the dream-winds blow
Thro’ the leaves of a Rainbow-bower.
Dawn to her cheek
Has come to seek
Roses to deck the Morn;
And the West knows where,
In the waves of her hair,
Last year’s young gold was born.
The birds will bring
At Dawn, when they sing,
A lute-like voice to her;
Her maids will be
The Earth and the Sea,
And a Star her minister.


What her life will be
In the night I see
When I read her horoscope;
When I see her stand
Each hand in a hand
Of the Angels—Faith and Hope.
Her pathway runs
’Neath the rose-red suns
That flower in the farthest skies;
And the stars are hers
For her messengers
On her way to Paradise.
She will not tire
Where worlds on fire
Are sands of the Milky Way,
Or the angel Love
Meets her above
By the milestone marked “ half-way.”
For her are the flowers
And the golden hours
That wing round them like bees,
The deep, deep hush
Ere the heavenly thrush
Calls loud through the trembling trees.
Ah, little 80-Peep!
It is good to sleep
In that fair, calm, angel way,


But I touch you like this
With the ghost of a kiss,
For I want you to wake—and play.
D. M. ROSS
THE SLEEP SEA.
The Sleep-Sea calls
To my mariner bold,
“ Come hither to me,
The night is cold.
“ Mine arms are wide
And my deeps are kind,
For never to me
Comes stormy wind.
“ My rocks are dreams,
Where, a-drift, a-drift,
My cradle-ship
May fall and lift.
“ My shoals are isles
Of slumbery sweets
Where never a wave
In anger beats.”
Do shut thine eyes
My mariner bold:
The Sleep-Sea calls,
The night is cold.
MARY GILMORE.

TO A SILVER-EYE.
Thou merry little silver-eye!
In yonder trailing vine,
I, passing by this morning, spied
That ivy-built nest of thine.
O’erhung with starry virgin-bower,
As white as ocean foam,
A fairy might have hidden there,
Nor wished a lovelier home.
Of twigs and softest fibres formed,
Bedecked with woodland moss,
In all my walks a fairer thing
I never came across;
The dewy leaves I pushed aside,
And bowed the branches frail,
And, glancing in the casket, saw
Three tiny emeralds pale.
O happy bird! with such a home,
Here in the Bush so still;
Companion of the butterflies,
Rocked at the zephyrs’ will—
How sweetly these glad vernal days
For you the moments fly,
Then gales blow soft, and earth is green,
And deeply blue the sky.


When over russet plains and hills
Fierce January glows,
Thou seekest cool and shady bowers
Among our vineyard rows;
And, though the purple clustering grape
Thou stabst with slender bill,
We grudge thee not the luscious feast,
Thou art welcome to thy fill.
Who hath not seen thy darling form,
Thy glancing eye so gay,
Thy wings and crest of faintest green,
Thy vest of ashen grey?
No golden melody hast thou
To charm the listening ear,
No brilliant plumage—yet, wee bird,
To all thou’rt known and dear.
JAMES THOMAS
THE CORN SONG.
All through the days, while frosty dawns
Were fretting wide the meadow,
And sun and cloud alternate played
With changeful shine and shadow;
While June upon the meadow pools
Was building icy bridges,
Fiom dawn to dark our ploughshares heaped
The furrow-lands with ridges.


Yea, while young winter vexed the hills,
We ploughed the lowlands mellow;
And spring brought forth the scattered seed
That summer thrilled to yellow.
And now while all the woods are bright,
And leafy tints grow deeper,
A music fills the valley-lands,
The clicking of the reaper.
And over all the yellow fields
The tasselled corn is lying,
The treasure of our sunny South,
In richness far outvying.
The vine-vat’s wealth of northern lands,
A sweeter gift bestowing;
’Tis Nature’s own, and from the horn
Of golden Plenty flowing.
Then blessings on our pleasant farms;
Long may they proudly flourish;
Still, year by year, the kindly corn
Increasing millions nourish.
And, when in years to greatness grown,
The Southland shines in story,
We’ll point to them —the old-time farms —
As landmarks of our glory.
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA.


THE WARRIGAL.
The warrigal’s lair is pent in bare
Black rocks at the gorge’s mouth;
It is set in ways where summer strays
With the sprites of flame and drought;
But, when the heights are touched with lights
Of hoar-frost, sleet, and shine,
His bed is made of the dead grass-blade
And the leaves of the windy pine.
Through forest boles the storm-wind rolls,
Vext of the sea-driven rain;
And, up in a cleft, through many a rift,
The voices of torrents complain.
The sad marsh fowl and the lonely owl
Are heard in the fog-wreaths grey,
When the warrigal wakes, and listens, and takes
To the woods that shelter the prey.
In the gully-deeps the blind creek sleeps,
And the silver, showery moon
Glides over the hills, and floats, and. fills,
And dreams in the dark lagoon;
While halting hard by the station yard,
Aghast at the hut-flame nigh,
The warrigal yells, and flats and fells
Are loud with his dismal cry.
On the topmost peak of the mountains bleak,
The south wind sobs, and strays
Through moaning pine and turpentine
And the rippling runnel ways;


And strong streams flow, and dank mists go,
Where the warrigal starts to hear
The watch dog’s bark break sharp in the dark,
And flees like a phantom of fear.
HENRY KENDALL.
THE NEW MOON. CJ
“ New Moon to-night,” you will hear them say,
Turning their eyes to the glint of gold; U
But this, as you know, is their quaint little way,
For the Moon she is centuries old! jjj
<
She swings like a boat in the darkening sky,
A boat that is gilded from stem to stern, X
And “Turn your money!” the old wives cry—
But every moon we have less to turn.
*
Yet saint and sinner and baron and boor, q
In log-built cabin or marble hall, 2
Happy-go-lucky and rich and poor— 2
The brave little Moon has a smile for all. 2
Her cargo has listed astern this trip,
And her bows are above the foam,
But she ploughs away down in the mists, a ship
That is eager enough for home.


Alone in the drift of the leagueless heights
Her course to the west she steers,
Rail-high with the lore of a million nights
And the legends of all the years.
“ New Moon to-night!” so the people say;
But the winds that cross her and croon,
They have sung in her silvery sails all day,
And they know her the old, old Moon.
And the pine-trees listen and toss their heads
And laugh in a splendid scorn,
For the old Moon sailed by their cradle beds
Before the speakers were born.
“ New Moon to-night!” so the people say,
Lifting their eyes to the curve of gold;
But this, as you know, is their quaint little way
For the Moon she is centuries old.

OH, IF THAT RAINBOW UP THERE!
Oh, if that rainbow up there,
Spanning the sky past the hill,
Slenderly, tenderly fair,
Shining with colours that thrill;
Oh, if that rainbow up there
Just for a moment could reach
Through the wet slope of the air
Here, where I stand on the beach!


Here, where the waves wash the strand,
Swing itself lovingly low,
Let me catch fast with one hand,
Climb its frail rigging and go.
Climb its frail rigging and go?
Where is its haven of rest?
Out in the gleam and the glow
Of the blood-red waves of the West?
Or where the isles of the dawn
Lie on an amethyst sea,
Does it drift, pale and forlorn.
Ghost of the glory I see?
Is there, ah! is there a land
Such as the Icelanders say,
Out past the West’s ruddy strand
Or on the verge of the day,
Some undiscovered clime
Seen through a cloud’s sudden rift,
Where all the rainbows of Time
Slowly and silently drift?
Some happy port of a sea
Never a world’s sail has made,
Where, till the earth shadows flee,
Never a rainbow may fade?
Oh, if that rainbow up there
Just for a moment would reach
Through the wet slope of the air
Here, where I stand on the beach!


Here, where the waves wash the strand,
Swing itself lovingly low,
Let me catch fast with one hand,
Climb its frail rigging and go!
ETHEL TURNER.
THE BATTLE OF LIFE.
Never give up, though life be a battle
Wherein true men may fail, and true causes be sold:
Yet, on the whole, however may rattle
The thunders of chance, scaring cowards like
cattle—
Clear Victory’s always the bride of the bold.
Armed in your right—though friendship deny
you,
And love fall away when the storm’s at the worst,
Count not your loss, ’twas destined to try you—
Bear the brunt like a man, and your deeds shall
ally you
To natures more noble and true than the first.
Rail not at Fate: if rightly you scan her,
There’s none loves more strongly the heart that
endures:
On, in the hero’s calm resolute manner,
Still bear aloft your hope’s long-trusted banner,
And the day, if you do but live through it, is yours.


Be this your faith; and if killing strokes clatter
On your harness where true men before you have
died,
Fight on, let your life-blood be poured out like
water —
Fight on, make at least a brave end of the matter,
Brave end of the struggle if nothing beside.
CHARLES HARPUR.
PRIMROSES.
They shine upon my table there,
A constellation mimic sweet,
No stars in Heaven could shine more fair,
Nor Earth has beauty more complete;
And on my table there they shine,
And speak to me of things divine.
In Heaven at first they grew, and when
God could not fairer make them, He
Did plant them by the ways of men
For all the pure in heart to see,
That each might shine upon its stem
And be a light from Him to them.
They speak of things above my verse.
Of thoughts no earthly language knows,
That loftiest Bard could ne’er rehearse
Nor holiest prophet e’er disclose,
Which God Himself no other way
Than by a Primrose could convey.
WILLIAM GAY.


THE NIGHT EXPRESS.
We leave the murk of the tunnel’s mouth
And burst on the open night,
The stars burn white in an arch of steel,
i he trees spin round in their crazy reel,
As flashes our furnace light.
The shifting shade of the lean, grey boughs
Flings over our shining track,
The night wings by in a windy rout;
We shake the rocks with a mighty shout
The depths of the range give back.
We burst the bond of the cumb’ring hills
To skirt, with an echoed roar,
The broad, black sheet of the silent bay,
The flying lights of our windows play
Like flames on the glassy floor.
The shadows swallow our path again,
White stems of the timber wheel,
And flock like ghosts from our frenzied speed
Ay, king is he, and king indeed.
The lord of the leagues of steel!
The splendid swoop of a falling grade,
A plunge with a swerve to right,
The lonely gleam of a cabin lamp,
The fitful spark of a fettler’s camp,
The swirl of a station light.


headlong charge through the riven rock,
A toss to our fiery mane,
The lonesome gate of a crossing passed,
The lights drop out to the rear at last —
Away in the night again!
ELLA McFADYEN,
THE LILY AND THE BEE.
I looked upon the lilies
When the morning sun was low,
And the sun shone through a lily
With a softened honey glow.
A spot was in the lily
That moved incessantly,
And when I looked into the cup
I saw a morning bee.
“ Consider the lilies!”
But, it occurs to me,
Does anyone consider
The lily and the bee?
The lily stands for beauty,
Use, purity and trust;
It does a four-fold duty,
As all good mortals must.
Its whiteness is to teach us,
Its faith to set us free,
Its beauty is to cheer us,
And its wealth is for the bee.


“ Consider the lilies!”
But, it occurs to me,
Does anyone consider
The lily and the bee?
HENRY LAWSON
THE DAYS OF SWEET OCTOBER.
The days of sweet October
With song and bloom are here,
With forest bowers
Aflame with flowers,
The sweetest of the year;
With low winds lisping in the leaves,
With laughing woodland ways,
With sundawns bright’ning on the eaves
Of sweet October days.
The days of sweet October,
How pleasantly they pass!
Through yellow shrines
The violet twines,
O’er slopes of waving grass;
With dipping oars and vacant mirth
On willowy waterways,
With sundawns bright’ning on the birth
Of sweet October days.
The days of sweet October
Are come with leaf and bird,
With golden wings,
With winnowings
Of woods by wind-waifs stirred.


With winding streams by white moons kissed
To silver waterways,
With sundawns widening tow’rds the West
In sweet October days.
The days of sweet October
Have brought the wild red rose
To fairy falls,
Where echo calls
The sweetest wind that blows;
With elfin lutes in leaves enshrined
soft, green waterways;
With spirits of the wave and wind,
In sweet October days.
O, days of sweet October!
When blows November’s breath,
The forest grieves
With drooping leaves
For Spring’s too early death;
Yea, when the shining days have died,
In mourning woodland ways
We miss the march of glad springtide,
The sweet October days.
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA
TO A BILLY.
Old Billy—battered, brown and black
With many days of camping,
Companion of the bulging sack,
And friend in all our tramping:


How often on the Friday night—
Your cubic measure testing—
With jam and tea we stuffed you tight
Before we started nesting!
How often, in the moonlight pale,
Through gums and gullies toiling,
We’ve been the first the hill to scale,
The first to watch you boiling;
When at the lane the tent was spread
The silver wattle under,
And early shafts of rosy red
Cleft sea-born mists asunder!
And so, old Billy, you recall
A host of sun-burnt faces,
And bring us back again to all
The best of camping places.
True flavour of the bush you bear,
Of camp and its surrounding,
Of freedom and of open air,
Of healthy life abounding.
You bring us more—with those we love
We watched you boil and bubble,
And in the sunny skies above
Forgot each schoolboy trouble:
So not without a kindly glance
We eye you in the study,
Although you’ve met with some mischance,
Although you’re black and muddy!
JAMES L. CUTHBERTSON


WALKING TO SCHOOL.
Now I am five, my father says
(And what he says you’ve got to mind)
That mother’s not to hold my hand,
Or even follow me behind
To see I’m safe. But down the road,
And all the way up the next street,
I am to walk now quite alone,
No matter what the things I meet.
Though horrid horses rear and plunge,
And cows come trampling, big and bold
And fighting boys are strutting out,
I shall have no one’s hand to hold.
Still, five is really very old;
It’s pretty close to being a man.
Since I a soldier wish to be,
I s’pose it’s time that I began.
I’ll swell my chest right out, like this,
And swing my books behind, just so,
And wear my hat stuck side-ways on,
And whistle all the way I go.
There is a little boy I pass,
He’s always swinging on the gate,
He’ll think that I am very old —
Perhaps he’ll think I’m seven, or eight.


There is a little girl I see,
She’s always standing at her door.
When I come whistling boldly past,
She’ll wish that she were more than four.
What I mind most of all are dogs;
My sister says dogs seldom bite,
But how can I be sure of this?
Your sisters are not always right.
There is an awful dog I hear;
It barks and barks as I go by.
I know some day it will get loose,
And fiercely at my throat will fly.
And other dogs come round and sniff
(I’ve sandals, and my legs are bare) ;
Perhaps it’s true they will not bite,
Perhaps some day I shall not care.
When you were five and walked to school,
And you met things to tremble at,
Were you as brave as great big men,
Or did your heart go pit-a-pat?

A SKETCH.
A little house, o’erhung with flowers,
Where first the creamy primrose breaks,
Where roses tell the summer hours
With bursting buds and falling flakes.

A little garden, blossom-starred,
With jewelled fruit and honeyed bell,
With holly for its prickly guard,
And bee for humming sentinel.
A little stream that turns aside,
And hurries onward to the main,
Who drinks of it, though worlds divide,
Will surely come and drink again.
ANNE GLENNY WILSON
AN AUSTRAL SKY.
(At Dawn, near the Head of the Yarra).
The morning breaks and day awakes
To peer with peeping eyes,
And every filmy cloudlet makes
A pillow where he lies.
A thousand notes, from throbbing throats,
Salute him ere he rise,
And down the gurgling river floats
The blushing of the skies.
The cloudlets melt, the skies unfold
Their dome of spotless blue,
In far ethereal spaces rolled
And zones of cosmic dew.
And higher still they rise, until,
With gladness of the view,
The joys of life and living thrill
Our pulses through and through.


Oh! that my life may ever glide
Beneath this Austral sky!
That I may feel its gladness wide
Roll in on heart and eye!
No vision drear of man is here,
Despair comes never nigh,
But hope exults v/ith healthful cheer
While heaven is lifted high.
ALEXANDER SUTHERLAND
THE FAIRY MAN.
It was, it was a fairy man
Who came to town to-day;
“ I’ll make a cake for sixpence
If you will pay, will pay,”
I paid him with a sixpence,
And with a penny, too;
He made a cake of rainbows,
And baked it in the dew.
The stars he caught for raisins,
The sun for candied peel,
The moon he broke for spices
And ground it on a wheel.
He stirred the cake with sunbeams.
And mixed it faithfully
With all the happy wishings
That come to you and me


He iced it with a moon-beam,
He patterned it with play,
And sprinkled it with star dust
From off the Milky Way.
He put it in a pearl shell —
O, white it was and new! —
He took the cake of rainbows
And baked it in the dew.
MARY GILMORE
THE FAIRIES’ HATS.
The roses are the fairies’ hats
For garden fete or races;
Clipped from the stiff stalks, thick and brown
They always wear them upside down
Above their winsome faces.
For pins, they have the pointed thorns
Pricked in, as Nature curves them;
And when, for some select affair,
They need a buckle here and there,
A web-caught dewdrop serves them.
The bride makes sun-hats from a rose
As white as clouds at morning,
The maidens take a musk-bud’s fold,
The heiresses don cloth of gold
To show lean suitors scorning!


And when you see stray petals float,
Some fairy, in a passion,
Has flung a dowdy bonnet down.
And the dry blooms, sun-scorched and brown
Are toques gone out of fashion.
The little dimpled fairy babes,
In their round green clover frocks,
Who play within the scented beds—
The bonnets on their flaxen heads
Are the soft, sweet-smelling stocks!
The pale green candles on the fir
Last night were shining brightly,
And underneath the brooding tree
The roses nodded, stalkless, free
Upon fair heads set lightly.
The Maman Cochets were held high,
The Gloire de Dijons fluttered,
You never saw such charming hats;
I peeped between the narrow slats—
My windows were all shuttered!
I saw them dance a minuet,
To the sparrows’ drowsy cheep,
Gay pixies romp with flower-decked head,
While human children, sent to bed,
Are thought to be asleep.
The moon looked down and laughed at them,
Such a gold October moon,


And from the clover on the lawn
The dew-pearls were all gone by dawn
To be stitched on dainty shoon.
The roses are the fairies’ hats
They choose them at their pleasure,
And pin them fast with many a thorn,
So they keep straight from eve to morn,
Mad waltz or stately measure.
The roses are the fairies’ hats
For garden fete or races,
Clipped from the stiff stalks, thick and brown.
Worn in the mode, set upside down
About their winsome faces.
M. FORREST.
A SONG OF WIND.
Hark to the song of the scattering, scurrying,
Blustering, bullying, bellowing, hurrying
Wind!
Over the hills it comes, laughing and rollicking,
Curling and whirling, flying and frolicking,
Spinning the clouds that are scattered and thinned.
And shouting a song
As it gallops along—
A song that is nothing but wind.


Waking the willows that hang their leaves listlessly,
Bending the poplars it roars on resistlessly—
Wind!
In the long grass on the slopes, as it passes, it
Billows and waves and scatters and masses it,
Shaking the fences so solidly pinned,
And howling a song
That is noisy and strong—
A song that is nothing but wind.
When the leaves of the autumn are falling and
yellowing,
We hear the wild song of the bullying, bellowing
Wind.
It leaps from its lair at a pace that is passionate,
And rends the soft clouds that have aided to fashion
Thrashing them fiercely, as slaves who have sinned,
With its many-lashed thong,
And yelling a song—
A song that is nothing but wind.
This is the song of the galloping, hurrying,
Gusty, and dusty, and whirling, and worrying
Wind.
Over the hills it comes, laughing and rollicking,
Yelling and swooping, and flying, and frolicking,
Shaking the fences so solidly pinned,
And shrieking a song
As it gallops along—
A terrible song that is Wind.
WILL LAWSON.


THUNDERBOLTS AND WIND.
It vexes me that common things
Like thunder and the wind,
That come so close I feel their wings,
Should be so hard to find.
I’ve followed deep into the bush,
And stared far out to sea,
Yet never found the winds that rush
So fast ahead of me.
Upon their heels I almost tread,
I almost catch their hair;
One day one nearly turned its head
To see if I were there.
Oh, surely there must be some place
Where, out of breath, they stand,
All trickling wet about the face,
And at each side a hand!
Then, why should thunder always fall
So far beyond the hill,
And never near one’s garden wall,
Where one might look and thrill?
I’ve climbed the very steepest track,
Eager a bolt to find,
But there were hills, still further back,
That it had dropped behind.


Ah! maybe, great archangels keep
The bolts for games of ball,
And roll them down some golden steep,
To please the angels small.
And, maybe, winds go back to fly
Small kites beyond the sun.
It seems to me that in the sky
God gives them glorious fun.
ETHEL TURNER
ON THE PLAINS.
Half-lost in film of faintest lawn,
A single star in armour white
Upon the dreamy heights of dawn
Guards the dim frontier of the ni^ht
O 9
Till plumed ray
And golden spray
Have washed its trembling light away.
The sun has peeped above the blue;
His level lances as they pass
Have shot the dew-drops thro’ and thro’,
And dashed with rubies all the grass,
And silver sound
Of horse-bells round
Floats softly o’er the jewelled ground.


The sunbeam and the wanton wind,
Among the feathery tufts at play,
Sing to the Earth: “The night is blind,
But we will kiss your tears away.
With broad’ning glow
And rippling flow
Adown the laughing leagues they go.
A vagrant lark on wayward wings
Is fluttering low, is floating high;
No Northern trill of rapture rings
Thro’ the vast temple of the sky;
But not in vain
Thy Southern strain,
Thou brown-winged angel of the plain!
Here, where the days are dull and grey,
And Youth has stilled his joyous song,
In fancy yet I love to stray
By creek, and plain, and billabong,
To the curlew’s call
And the noiseless fall
Of the unshod hoof ’neath the gum trees tall
I hear once more the plover’s “ peet ”;
The grey hawk wheels in dizzy height,
And swift beneath my horse’s feet
The brown quail rises in his fright,
And the galahs fly
With pink breasts high,
A rosy cloud in a cloudless sky.


Afar I mark the emu’s run;
The bustard slow, in motley clad;
And, basking in his bath of sun,
The brown snake on the cattle-pad,
And the reddish black
Of a dingo’s back
As he loit’ring slinks on my horse’s track.
And now I watch, with slackened rein,
The scattered cattle, hundreds strong,
As slowly moving home again
The lazy vanguard feeds along
To the waters cool
Of the tree-fringed pool
In the distant creek when the noon is full.
Slip girth and let the old horse graze;
The noon grows heavy on the air,
Kindle the tiny camp fire’s blaze,
And neath the shade, as monarch there,
Take thou thine ease:
For hours like these
A king had bartered satrapies!
Here lie and watch, thro’ smoke-wreaths cool
By yon sunk log and floating wrack,
The emperor of the silent pool,
The stately heron, white and black,
Afar from heat,
Upon his beat,
Knee-deep in shallowy retreat.


O mellow air! O sunny light!
O Hope and Youth that pass away!
Inscribe in letters of delight
Upon each heart one golden day—
To be there set
When we forget
There is a joy in living yet!
GEORGE ESSEX EVANS.
SONG OF CAPE LEEUWIN.
Beaten by tempest and stormed by drift,
Steady I keep my post,
And laugh at the southern rollers long,
For I’m guard of the Southern Coast.
I watched the Dutchmen on their way
In the days of long ago,
But they set no foot on my rocky shore,
Where the billows break in snow.
They gave me my name and sailed away,
And then the English came,
With their straining sails on their plunging ships,
And their flag flew out like flame.
ERNEST FAVENC.


AUSTRALIA FAIR.
Australia fair! I love thee,
The dear land of my birth;
To me thou art the sweetest,
The brightest spot on earth.
I love thy golden sunshine,
Thy sky of peerless hue,
The soft greys of the distance,
The hills’ faint tints of blue.
I love thy yellow beaches,
The clear waves tipped with foam,
The capes that stand like bulwarks
To guard my native home.
I love the leafy gullies
Where palm and fern-tree hide,
The tall grey gums that clamber
On ev’ry steep hill-side.
I love the ferny pathways
Where wattle blossoms fall
While in the leafy distance
The bell-bird rings his call.
Dear Southern land, Australia,
Wherever I may roam,
My heart will turn for ever,
To thee, my native home.
MAYBANKE ANDERSON


THE AUSTRALIAN.
He swings his axe in the golden morn,
The blade bites clean and free;
The trees must fall ere the land be ploughed,
And an axeman strong is he.
He drives his plough through the yellow mould
The share cuts clean and free;
The soil must break ere the seed be sown,
And a ploughman strong is he.
He sows the seed in the furrowed field,
With tireless hand sows he;
When sun and rain have wrought their will
What shall the harvest be?
If trees alone his axe-blade hewed,
If he but ploughed the plain
And ploughed no more, and sowed but wheat,
’Twould be but golden grain.
But more than trees he brings to earth,
Old wrongs that bind and thrall;
And from his harvest shall be made
The sweetest bread of all.
A young man in a young land, he
Dreams noble dreams of youth,
And foremost in the van of years
He sows the seeds of Truth.
RODERIC QUINN.


THE OLD AUSTRALIAN WAYS.
The London lights are far abeam
Behind a bank of cloud,
Along the shore the gaslights gleam,
The gale is piping loud;
And down the Channel, groping blind,
We drive her through the haze
Towards the land we left behind—
The good old land of “ never mind,”
And old Australian ways.
The narrow ways of English folk
Are not for such as we;
They bear the long-accustomed yoke
Of staid conservancy:
But all our roads are new and strange,
And through our blood there runs
The vagabonding love of change
That drove us westward of the range
And westward of the suns.
The city folk go to and fro
Behind a prison’s bars,
They never feel the breezes blow
And never see the stars;
They never hear, in blossomed trees,
The music low and sweet
Of wild birds making melodies,
Nor catch the little laughing breeze
That whispers in the wheat.


Our fathers came of roving stock
That could not fixed abide;
And we have followed field and flock
Since e’er we learnt to ride;
By miner’s camp and shearing shed,
In land of heat and drought,
We followed where our fortunes led,
With fortune always on ahead
And always further out.
The wind is in the barley-grass,
The wattles are in bloom;
The breezes greet us as they pass
With honey-sweet perfume;
The parrakeets go screaming by
With flash of golden wing,
And from the swamp the wild-ducks cry
Their long-drawn note of revelry,
Rejoicing at the Spring.
So throw the weary pen aside
And let the papers rest,
For we must saddle up and ride
Towards the blue hill’s breast;
And we must travel far and fast
Across their rugged maze,
To find the Spring of Youth at last,
And call back from the buried past
The old Australian ways.


When Clancy took the drover’s track
In years of long ago,
He drifted to the outer back
Beyond the Overflow;
By rolling plain and rocky shelf,
With stockwhip in his hand,
He reached at last, oh lucky elf!
The Town of Come-and-help-yourself
In Rough-and-ready Land.
And if it be that you would know
The tracks he used to ride,
Then you must saddle up and go
Beyond the Queensland side,
Beyond the reach of rule or law,
To ride the long day through
In Nature’s homestead—filled with awe
You then might see what Clancy saw
And know what Clancy knew.
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON
IF WE ONLY COULD.
Ah! if we only could
Blot out the bitter thought,
Make life the thing we should,
And shape it as we ought.
Turn back the brooding eyes
From things long, long gone by;
And looking upward, rise
Toward a clearer sky;

A FEDERAL SONG.
In the greyness of the dawning we have seen the
pilot-star,
In the whisper of the morning we have heard the
years afar.
Shall we sleep and let them be
When they call to you and me?
Can we break the land asunder God has girdled
with the sea?
For the Flag is floating o’er us,
And the track is clear before us,
From the desert to the ocean, let us lift the mighty
chorus
For the days that are to be.
We have flung the challenge forward: “Brothers,
stand or fall as One!”
She is coming out to meet us in the splendour of
the sun.
From the graves beneath the sky
Where her nameless heroes lie,
From the forelands of the Future they are waiting
our reply!
We can face the roughest weather
If we only hold together,


Marching forward to the Future marching shoulder-
firm together,
For the Nation yet to be.
All the greyness of the dawning, all the mists are
over-past,
In the glory of the morning we shall see Her face
at last.
He who sang, “ She yet will be,”
He shall hail her, crowned and free!
Could we break the land asunder God has girdled
with the sea?
For the Flag is floating o’er us,
And the Star of Hope before us,
From the desert to the ocean, brothers, lift the
mighty chorus
For Australian Unity.
GEORGE ESSEX EVANS.
THE TEAMS.
A cloud of dust on the long, white road,
And the teams go creeping on
Inch by inch with the weary load;
And by the power of the greenhide goad
The distant goal is won.
With eyes half-shut to the blinding dust,
And necks to the yokes bent low,
The beasts are pulling as bullocks must;
And the shining tires might almost rust
While the spokes are turning slow.


With face half-hid ’neath a broad-brimmed hat
That shades from the heat’s white waves,
And shouldered whip, with its greenhide plait,
The driver plods with a gait like that
Of his weary, patient slaves.
He’ll sometimes pause as a thing of form
In front of a settler’s door,
And ask for a drink, and remark, “It’s warm,”
Or say, “There are signs of a thunderstorm’’;
But he seldom utters more.
But the rains are heavy on roads like these
And, fronting his lonely home,
For weeks together the settler sees
The teams bogged down to the axletrees,
Or ploughing the sodden loam.
And then when the roads are at their worst,
The bushman’s children hear
The cruel blows of the whips reversed;
While bullocks pull as their hearts would burst.
And bellow with pain and fear.
And thus, with little of joy or rest,
Are the long, long journeys done;
And thus—’tis a cruel war at the best—
Is distance fought in the mighty West,
And the lonely battles won.
HENRY LAWSON.


THE FIRST SHOT.
Fire! and a wreath of snow-white smoke, enfolding
a spirit of flame,
Leaps from a shining cylinder that is trained with a
deadly aim;
And just in the golden haze of dawn, as nature
awakes and smiles,
The voice of the ten-inch turret-gun rings out o’er
the startled isles.
The leaves of the palm-trees whisper low, and the
stems in the cane-brake nod,
And the branches creak in the dark deep groves
where the Buccaneers once trod.
Yon sunlit waves were their cruising-ground, and a
shot in war again
Must wake strange echoes hereabout on the shores
of the Spanish Main.
And far and deep it rings through the sea, till it
comes to the waiting ears
Of a captain dead who was greater far than the best
of the Buccaneers;
For neither Morgan, nor Sharp, nor Swan, v/ho
fought for adventure’s sake,
Could singe the beard of the King of Spain like
fighting Francis Drake.


He lies where they lowered him overboard, with all
his fighting o’er,
A league from the Porto Bello beach, on the oozy
ocean floor.
And a shot at a Spanish ship has wakened the grim
sea-dog below,
Who broke the great Armada’s might three hundred
years ago.
Perchance aroused from his long long dreams, far
down ’neath the restless wave,
He raises himself on his elbow there, and calls to a
comrade brave,
As o’er him steams a ship-of-the-line of thirteen
thousand tons,
“Ho, there, John Hawkins! art still asleep? Man
canst thou not hear the guns?
“ They mind me of many a fight I fought, and many
a prize I made,
And I think of the Nombre de Dios fray, when I
tasted a Spanish blade.
Thou know’st how I burned their argosies, from
Callao to the Horn,
And harried their navy in Cadiz roads, and slipped
away at morn.
“ ’Twas merry enough in the Golden Hind, that day
with our yards aback,
When we threw our grappling-hooks aboard of the
Portuguese carrack.


I mind how the knaves struck shrewdly, too, till the
cutlasses hewed them down,
When I landed at Porto Bello beach, and my boat’s
crew burned the town.
“ Dost ever think of the game of bowls that we
played on Plymouth Hoe,
When off the pitch of the Lizard Point already lay
the foe?
Then the running fight in the Channel tide, and the
fire-ships launched ablaze
At the galleons moored in the Calais roads—ah!
those were the glorious days.
“ And the Duke Medina was fain to fly, when the
morn broke cold and grey;
I warrant me now he would rather have been in his
orange groves that day
Than out near the flats of the Flemish coast, adrift
in a rising sea,
With us and a gale to windward and the Gravelines
shoals a-lee.
“ But spite of the lesson our broadsides taught, as
they laboured close inshore,
The Spaniards have gotten another fleet, and have
ta’en the sea once more,
And I wonder whether the captains now, and like-
wise whether the men,
Can fight their ships as they should be fought, and
as we fought them then.”


Up spake the voice of Hawkins bold from his couch
in the ocean bed,
Off coast from Porto Rico fair, and these are the
words he said: —
‘ Now, Francis Drake, be of right good cheer, for the
men who to-day fight Spain
Are the self-same breed as thou and I—so turn to
thy rest again.”
JOHN SANDES.
AT THE BASE HOSPITAL.
The willows sweep the water, and the rushes lean
a-down,
And I see the river shining far away,
With a snowy cloud above it, floating softly, like a
crown,
And the water-hen and wildfowl at their play.
Are the magpies still at battle in the crooked apple-
trees?
Is the ripple flow still singing at the bar,
By the long-grassed sandstone pocket where the
cattle lie at ease,
And the sun upon the river at Glenbar?
They are bringing in the dying, they are bearing out
the dead,
And I watch the nurses moving to and fro,


In the long, low, white-washed wardroom, I lie
dreaming on my bed,
And it may be that I, too, shall have to go.
But we faced the Mauser bullets when they whistled
down the wind,
And we felt the fight we fought was worth a scar.
For we battled for the Empire and the land we left
behind—
And I battled for the honour of Glenbar.
Half-dead upon the barren veldt I heard the stock-
whips crack,
(’Twas the rattle of the Maxim’s deadly rain;)
I was riding old Campaspe, as we wheeled the
leaders back,
And brought them down the ridges to the plain.
I saw the slip-rails gleaming, and I heard the river
flow—
Then Brenda’s face came shining like a star,
And we watched the water-finches, as they fluttered
to and fro,
And the lilies on the river at Glenbar.
I’ve seen an army moving out a hundred thousand
strong,
I’ve felt the thrill of battle and the smart,
But I’d barter all the glory for a day at Dandenong,
With the cool hand of the bush upon my heart.


They say we drove their rifles back like chaff before
the wind,
They say our name and fame have travelled far —
But my heart is full of hunger for the girl I left
behind,
And the old folk by the river at Glenbar.
GEORGE ESSEX EVANS.
THE ROAD OF ROSES.
The Sun of Childhood tender
Illumes the long white way
With touches of rosy splendour,
All in the dawn of day.
And ever as he passes,
And through the forest runs,
He lights on leaves and grasses
A thousand little suns.
And, like a gleaming river
That to the sea descends,
The long white road runs ever
To where the Rainbow ends.
The bee his small wings closes,
And makes his sweet abode
Within the hearts of roses
That bloom beside the road.


And Spring’s wise little lady,
The Primrose, opens her eyne,
And keeps in places shady
Her golden lamps ashine.
The birds, with sunlight sheening
Their throats, sing all a-row
A song whose mystic meaning
Only the children know.
It tells of strange lands under
The sunset, strange and fair,
And of the World of Wonder
Above the Rainbow Stair,
It tells of how To-morrow
Will bring a shining sheaf
Of joys without a sorrow,
Of hours without a grief.
So, with clear voices ringing,
And posies in their hands,
The children journey singing
Unto the Wonder Lands.
VICTOR J. DALEY


YOUNG AUSTRALIA BY THE SEA.
(On a Beach near Sydney.)
Behind me spreads a continent, before me shines the
sea,
With the sun that warms a nation looking kindly
down on me,
For the morning gleams with promise, and a glad-
ness fills the land
As I mark where young Australia goes a-romping
on the sand.
For the little waves are running in with laughter,
And a long, long whisper of delight—
Oh, run, little feet, they’re coming after
With their quick foam-fingers creeping white.
Afar, by yonder greener cape, the dingy sails were
furled,
Where the ships of high adventure came a-sailing
round the world,
And the white man gazed in wonder at his last-
found ocean prize,
Looking landward through the sunshine into bright
Australia’s eyes.
For the little waves were running in with laughter,
And a long, long whisper on the sand.
Where the white man’s feet would follow after,
And the white man’s child love the land.


The sand-built castle tumbles down before the
creeping tide,
With the white shells flung in triumph along the
ruins wide,
And though every little footprint will be cleanly
washed away,
With a happy heart the ocean joins Australia at
her play;
For the little waves are running in with laughter,
And a long, long whisper on the sand —
Oh, run, little feet, they’re coming after,
For the blue, blue sea loves the land.
The sea is hoar with wisdom. Oh, it marks the
coming days
When the hands of young Australia shall be master
of its ways,
When the castle shall not tumble, when the white
feet, firm to stand,
Shall not yield to any foeman one bright yard of
this wide land;
When the little waves are running red with
slaughter,
And a long, long sigh upon the shore—
Oh, you love our bright Australia, shining water,
But the white man’s child loves her more!
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.


WILL-O’-THE-WISP OR STAR.
I follow the light that runs before me,
Will-o’-the-wisp or star;
What if the clouds are closing o’er me—
Storm in their ruins afar—
O’er hill and hollow
I follow, I follow,
Will-o’-the-wisp or star!
I follow the light that leads me onward,
Will-o’-the-wisp or star;
On to the peaks that climbing sunward
Watch for the morn afar;
Thro’ dim woods haunted,
I follow, undaunted,
Will-o’-the-wisp or star!
I follow the light that Fate has given,
Will-o’-the-wisp or star;
Which does it matter? The end is heaven
God is the goal afar.
So, hill or hollow,
I follow, I follow,
Will-o’-the-wisp or star.
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA.


THE BUSH.
Give us from dawn to dark
Blue of Australian skies,
Let there be none to mark
Whither our pathway lies.
Give us when noontide comes
Rest in the woodland free—
Fragrant breath of the gums.
Cold, sweet scent of the sea.
Give us the wattle’s gold
And the dew-laden air,
And the loveliness bold
Loneliest landscapes wear.
These are the haunts we love,
Glad with enchanted hours,
Bright as the heavens above,
Fresh as the wild bush flowers.
JAMES LISTER CUTHBERTSON


EXILED.
Oh! the broom and the bracken and the honey
scent of wattle,
And the snowy sheets of ti-tree on the hillside
and the fell;
Oh! the cries of jay and curlew that come down the
wind together,
With the calling of the magpie and the wether’s
tinkling bell.
Oh! the birds and the blossoms, with a red flame
on the gum trees,
And the dropping of the gum caps in the creek
that runs below;
Oh! the sweep of splendid scrubland with its green
and purple reaches,
And the wind among the she-oaks sighing
drearily and low.
Oh! the broom and the bracken and the scent of
dew-wet wattle,
And the hazy mists of morning drifting slowly,
softly by;
How I’m longing in the far town, ’midst the
glowing Springtime weather,
Just to see the bushland’s* splendour ’neath the
blue September skv.
RITA WILSON.


OUR GUM TREES.
Our fathers came from the war-stained North
The men who had strength to roam,
They said “Farewell” and sallied forth,
To win for themselves a home.
They sailed the sea to the bush king’s realm,
His groves for their crops they cleared,
They thought of oak, and of ash, and elm,
They looked at the gum and sneered.
They said his leaves were of sombre hue,
Too mean to provide them shade,
They sniffed his scent when the breezes blew
And sighed for a primrose glade.
They said his limbs were of uncouth shapes,
Like threatening demons’ arms,
His strings of bark were like widows’ crapes;
They longed for their woodland’s charms.
From war-stained North have our fathers come
But we have the bush sons’ eyes,
For we are kin of the spreading gum
That hearkened our infant cries.
By him we played in our boyish hours,
By him we have earned our bread,
And he will scatter his scented flowers
O’er us, when we’re lying—dead.

We see the Red, like a thirsty king,
Bend over the silver streams;
We see the Mallee its tassels fling,
To steel of the sunset’s gleams.
The Blue’s young shoots with their leaves grey-
pearled,
A cloud that has gone awry;
The Ironbark with his limbs uphurled
As though he would win the sky.
Your oak and elm are but fair-day friends,
That smile when your sky is clear,
But close their eyes when the summer ends
And skies and the world grow drear.
Our gum stands firm through the winter cold,
There’s never a change in him,
He gives his best like a comrade bold,
When joy in the world grows dim.
He stands apart from the Old World trees,
Unbound by the laws of form;
He bends his head to the zephyr breeze,
But laughs at the drought and storm.
We stand apart, like our own great tree,
Afar from the nations’ hum;
Come, brothers, keep our homeland free,
As limbs of our Austral Gum!
NATHAN F. SPIELVOGEL.


AUSTRALIANS TO THE FRONT.
Captain Cook, whose statue is in Hyde Park, Sydney,
hears the drums of Australia’s Expeditionary Forces, 1914.
From the Scheldt unto the Niemen
Hark, the music of the drums!
Not unthrilled the souls of free men
When that instant message comes.
Rolling east the wild fantasia
Stirs the Orient blood to flame;
And the drums call Australasia—
And she answers to her name.
Far away from hosts in battle,
Yet in time with marching feet,
Here and now the war-drums rattle
In the sunbright city street.
Horse and foot in martial manner,
Swift commands, and glances high,
Naked steel and silken banner—
Thus the ranks go proudly by.
But within the gardens spacious,
Not a stone’s throw from the crowd,
One who fronts the landscape gracious
Listens to the war-drums loud.
Beats the eager drummer harder,
And methinks the bronze can hear,
In those eyes a flash of ardour!
On that cheek a noble tear!


“Dauntless Captain, did’st thou ever,
With thy sailor-eyes of gray
Searching out from thy Endeavour
That sequestered flower-starred bay,
Dream that some day those who love thee
Here would stake their all of worth,
For the flag that waved above thee
And the land that gave thee birth?”
And the dauntless Captain listens;
Ah, if only he could speak!
But a vagrant rain-drop glistens
On that scorched and blistered cheek,
And the faith that does not falter
Still may hear his whisper low—
“Son, this new land doth not alter
Britain’s breed of long ago.”
JOHN SANDES.
THE AUSTRALIAN FLEET.
Long and long has she slumbered, till many a mouth
denied
There was life in the ancient spirit that folded our
fathers’ pride.
Till many a lip grew scornful and curled at a
nation’s name
That could borrow our island honour and trade upon
England’s fame.


Long was her pride in awaking, this Queen of the
Southron Seas,
Slow has she been in making a flag to fling to the
breeze;
But at last, alert and stirring, she has heard what
the sagas sing—
At last the wheels are whirring, the hammer and
anvil ring.
Could the old bold blood run calmly, could the old
quick pulse beat slow
While the long waves leap on the Leeuwin and
winds on the Otway blow?
Hark to the ocean crooning the old, old song made
new;
Come to me, Sea King’s children—my warm wide
breast for you!”
They have left their fires in the ranges, they have
left their ploughs on the plain,
They have left their colts in the stockyard, to come
to their own again!
To plough with their keels the furrows their fathers
ploughed of yore,
To fasten the sea’s white horses to the yoke of the
oak once more!
What fear for the nameless future? What doubt for
the years unrolled?
If the hands are new to the labour, is the blood not
tried and old?


Shall not the spirit of Nelson, of Grenville, and
Howe and Drake
Look down on these decks of venture and guard
them for England’s sake?
WILL OGILVIE.
MY COUNTRY.
The love of field and coppice,
Of green and shaded lanes,
Of ordered woods and gardens
Is running in your veins.
Strong love of grey-blue distance,
Brown streams and soft, dim skies —
I know, but cannot share it,
My love is otherwise.
I love a sunburnt country,
A land of sweeping plains,
Of ragged mountain ranges,
Of droughts and flooding rains.
I love her far horizons,
I love her jewel-sea,
Her beauty and her terror—
The wide brown land for me!
The stark white ring-barked forests,
All tragic to the moon.
The sapphire-misted mountains,
The hot gold hush, of noon,


Green tangle of the brushes
Where lithe lianas coil,
And orchids deck the tree-tops,
And ferns the warm dark soil.
Core of my heart, my country!
Her pitiless blue sky,
When, sick at heart, around us
We see the cattle die—
But then the grey clouds gather,
And we can bless again
The drumming of an army,
The steady soaking rain.
Core of my heart, my country!
Land of the rainbow gold,
For flood and fire and famine
She pays us back threefold.
Over the thirsty paddocks,
Watch, after many days,
The filmy veil of greenness
That thickens as we gaze...
An opal-hearted country,
A wilful, lavish land—
All you who have not loved her.
You will not understand—
Though Earth holds many splendours,
Wherever I may die,
I know to what brown country
My homing thoughts will fly.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR


THE DOMINION OF AUSTRALIA
(A Forecast, 1877).
She is not yet; but he whose ear
Thrills to that finer atmosphere
Where footfalls of appointed things,
Reverberant of days to be,
Are heard in forecast echoings,
Like wave-beats from a viewless sea,
Hears in the voiceful tremors of the sky
Auroral heralds whispering, “She is nigh.”
She is not yet; but he whose sight
Foreknows the advent of the light,
Whose soul to morning radiance turns
Ere night her curtain hath withdrawn,
And in its quivering folds discerns
The mute monitions of the dawn,
With urgent sense strained onward to descry
Her distant tokens, starts to find Her nigh.
Not yet her day. How long “not yet”?
There comes the flush of violet!
And heavenward faces, all aflame
With sanguine imminence of morn,
Wait but the sun-kiss to proclaim
The Day of the Dominion born.
Prelusive baptism!—ere the natal hour
Named with the name and prophecy of power.


Already here to hearts intense,
A spirit-force, transcending sense,
In heights unsealed, in deeps unstirred,
Beneath the calm, above the storm,
She waits the incorporating word
To bid her tremble into form.
Already, like divining-rods, men’s souls
Bend down to where the unseen river rolls;
For even as, from sight concealed,
By never flush of dawn revealed,
Nor e’er illumed by golden noon,
Nor sunset-streaked with crimson bar,
Nor silver-spanned by wake of moon,
Nor visited of any star,
Beneath these lands a river waits to bless
(So men divine) our utmost wilderness,—
Rolls dark, but yet shall know our skies,
Soon as the wisdom of the wise
Conspires with nature to disclose
The blessing prisoned and unseen,
Till round our lessening wastes there glows
A perfect zone of broadening green,—
Till all our land, Australia Felix called,
Become one Continent-Isle of Emerald.


So flows beneath our good and ill
A viewless stream of Common Will,
A gathering force, a present might,
That from its silent depths of gloom
At Wisdom’s voice shall leap to light
And hide our barren feuds in bloom,
Till, all our sundering lines with love o’ergrown
Our bounds shall be the girdling seas alone.
BRUNTON STEPHENS.
AVE IMPERATRIX.
While yet the trumpet’s voice is mute,
Before the bells’ triumphant peal,
In solemn silence we salute
Our virgin- vestured Commonweal!
With hopes and fears, for speech too deep,
In humble, not in boastful mood,
We watch her as she takes the steep
And perilous path of Nationhood.
Far down the Valley of the Shade
The world’s embanner’d armies pass,
And o’er the empires man has made
Is waving now the desert grass.


Where camp today Cambyses’ hosts?
And where are Caesar’s eagles flown?
Time’s halls are haunted by the ghosts
Of kingdoms he has overthrown.
But not, like these, in mailed might,
And not in panoply of steel
Doth she step forth in all men’s sight,
Our young and radiant Commonweal.
And not by lure of conquest drawn
We follow wnere she leads the way;
We are the squadrons of the dawn,
We are the vanguard of the day.
Yet greatly arm’d art thou, our Queen!
From God’s own armoury it came,
The blade that by thy side is seen;
And Justice is its sacred name.
To guard thy honour is its task
From ancient shapes of civic wrong,
And anarchy, that wears the mask
Of Freedom. Be thou bold and strong.
If Freedom drowse, if Wisdom nod,
That blade shall cure each cankerous ill;
Swift Angel of the Wrath of God,
Hew, clear and clean, thy Master’s will


Lo, ere we raise the festal song,
Here with bow’d heads we supplicate
That He to whom the worlds belong
May make and keep Australia great.
Lo, while the trumpet’s voice is mute,
Before the bells’ triumphant peal,
In solemn silence we salute
Our virgin-vestured Commonweal.
WALTER MURDOCH.
A SONNET OF THE EMPIRE.
Empire that has with empires girt the world,
And with the bonds of the imperial sea,
Where moves no wind but stirs thy flag unfurled
Hast knit in one thy farthest states with thee!
Thou frontest day and night; and not a star
That shines remotest in the polar sky,
But they who love thee, on thy bounds afar,
At eve behold it born, at morning die.
Yet to be great is nought, if nought but great;
And thou from glory must to shame decline,
And we in love and fealty abate,
When from thy greatness dies the soul divine,
And thou no more, with all thy sovereign might,
Art great for peace, for freedom and for right.
WILLIAM GAY.


ODE FOR COMMONWEALTH DAY
Awake! Arise! The wings of dawn
Are beating at the Gates of Day!
The morning star hath been withdrawn,
The silver vapours melt away!
Rise royally, O Sun, and crown
The shoreward billow, streaming white,
The forelands and the mountains brown.
With crested light;
Flood with soft beams the valleys wide,
The mighty plains, the desert sand,
Till the New Day hath won for bride
This Austral land!
Free-born of Nations, Virgin white,
Not won by blood nor ringed with steel,
Thy throne is on a loftier height,
Deep-rooted in the Commonweal!
O Thou for whom the strong have wrought,
And poets sung with souls aflame,
Born of long hope and patient thought,
A mighty name—
We pledge thee faith that shall not swerve,
Our Land, Our Lady, breathing high
The thought that makes it love to serve,
And life to die!


Now are thy maidens linked in love
Who erst have striven for pride of place;
Lifted all meaner thoughts above
They greet thee, one in heart and race:
She, in whose sunlit coves of peace
The navies of the world may rest,
And bear her wealth of snowy fleece
Northward and West;
And she, whose corn and rock-hewn gold
Built that Queen City of the South,
Where the lone billow swept of old
Her harbour-mouth;
And the blithe Sun-maid, in whose veins
For ever burns the tropic fire,
Whose cattle roam a thousand plains—
With opal and with pearl for tire;
And that sweet Harvester who twines
The tender vine and binds the sheaf,
And the young Western Queen, who mines
The desert reef,
And she, against whose flowery throne
And orchards green the wave is hurled—
Australia claims them; They are One
Before the World!
Crown Her—most worthy to be praised—
With eyes uplifted to the morn;
For on this day a flag is raised,
A triumph won, a nation born!


And Ye, vast Army of the Dead,
From mine and city, plain and sea,
Who fought and dared, who toiled and bled
That this might be,
Draw round us in this hour of fate—
Here where your children’s children stand
With unseen lips, Oh consecrate
And bless the land!
Eternal Power, benign, supreme,
Who weigh’st the nations upon earth;
Without whose aid the Empire dream
And pride of states is nothing worth—
From shameless speech, and vengeful deed,
From license veiled in freedom’s name,
From greed of gold and scorn of creed
Guard Thou our fame!
In stress of days that yet may be
When hope shall rest upon the sword,
In Welfare and Adversity,
Be with us, Lord!
GEORGE ESSEX EVANS.


A CHRISTMAS HYMN.
It was the calm and silent night!— x
Seven hundred years and fifty-three
Had Rome been growing up to might,
And now was Queen of land and sea!
No sound was heard of clashing wars;
Peace brooded o’er the hushed domain;
Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars
Held undisturbed their ancient reign,
In the solemn midnight
Centuries ago!
’Twas in the calm and silent night!—
The senator of haughty Rome
Impatient urged his chariot’s flight,
From lordly revel rolling home!
Triumphal arches gleaming swell
His breast with thoughts of boundless sway;
What recked the Roman what befell
A paltry province far away,
In the solemn midnight
Centuries ago!
Within that province far away
Went plodding home a weary boor;
A streak of light before him lay,
Fall’n through a half-shut stable-door


Across his path. He passed—for nought
Told what was going on within;
How keen the stars! his only thought;
The air how calm and cold and thin,
In the solemn midnight
Centuries ago!
O strange indifference!—low and high
Drowsed over common joys and cares;
The earth was still—but knew not why;
The world was listening—unawares!
How calm a moment may precede
One that shall thrill the world for ever!
To that still moment none would heed,
Man’s doom was linked no more to sever
In the solemn midnight
Centuries ago!
It is the calm and solemn night!
A thousand bells ring out, and throw
Their joyous peals abroad, and smite
The darkness, charmed and holy norv!
The night that erst no name had worn,
To it a happy name is given;
For in that stable lay new-born
The peaceful Prince of Earth and Heaven
In the solemn midnight
Centuries ago!
ALFRED DOMETT,


George Essex Evans




ON THE PROMONTORY.
I love this headland’s gusty crown
Of Nature’s masonry;
Here, hour by hour, I can look down—
Tireless look down on thee,
Who rollest fair in smile or frown,
Unconquerable sea!
The pealing song of Liberty
Arises with each wave;
The deep-voiced echoes answer “Free!”
From every sounding cave—
Ocean, no power e’er bound on thee
The fetters of a slave!
The brave Balboa, when the first
Of white men to behold
The wide Pacific’s splendours burst
From plains of blue and gold,
Dreamt that the Spaniard’s yoke accurst
Thy bright neck could enfold.
Thigh-deep, he waded from the shore
Into thy foaming tide;
High the degraded Cross he bore,
His sword was at his side—
This wondrous ocean evermore
For Spain I hold!” he cried.


Still through the centuries I hear
Thy breakers’ laugh of scorn,
That pierced the Autumn atmosphere
On that St. Martin’s morn:
Where now is bold Balboa? Where
The glories Spain has worn?
The Spaniard mingles with the dust,
His name survives alone;
His country’s sword has fallen in rust —
Lost, all her conquests won!
As then, in storm and calm august
And free, thou rollest on!
And still a deeper music yield
Thy waves to Briton’s ears
Than, rising from thine azure field,
The Gaul or German hears—
Thou hast been Albion’s shining shield
Through all the storied years!
Here, where beneath cerulean skies
Of deeper, warmer hue,
Thou seest a fairer Britain rise,
To Britons still be true —
Guards of the free, our bulwarks be
Thy tameless waters blue!
EDWARD BOOTH LOUGHRAN


THE SHEPHERDS AND THE SHEEP
In days of old when Primal Man
Was in the skins of beasts arrayed,
He seldom delved, and never span,
But with a club his living made.
And when his Race seemed like to die
In caves and dens obscure and deep,
There came a gentle goddess by,
Who led a flock of snow-white sheep.
She taught him how to weave and spin,
To shear the fleece, and card the wool;
Till he, whose garb was shaggy skin,
Was robed in garments beautiful.
And when, in after-times, he roved
From sea to sea, in nations, then
It was the shepherd that she loved
Above all other types of men.
She taught him, when the calm moonlight
Lay still and white on sand and sod,
That all the stars that gemmed the night
Were but the Shining Sheep of God.


She taught him that the Firmament,
With all its wondrous starry race,
Was but for him a blue-domed Tent
Wherein to dwell a little space:
A little space, till came the call
To move to fairer fields afar,
Beyond these earthly pastures small,
Beyond the light of furthest star.
In years when this old world was young,
Before the age of greed and strife—
The golden days by poets sung—
The shepherd’s was the Gentle Life.
In later days the Riders came
Down from the hills of snow.
Their spear-points caught the morning flame,
Two thousand years ago.
Out of the heart of Tartary,
Mother of races strong,
Came those bold horsemen, fierce and free,
And drove their sheep along.
The curled Assyrian, with a frown,
Beheld their flocks of snow;
He knew the sign; his throne went down
Before the Persian bow.


The Arab came, the Persian fell
On many a battle plain;
But still the flocks thrived free and well
Beneath the Arab reign.
They thrived beneath the Arab reign,
Though he was fierce and grim;
And when the Arab conquered Spain
They went to Spain with him.
And now on plains Australian
Their home is, after roving long,
Their Shepherd is a silent man
Who hums a solitary song.
Few are his pleasures or his pains,
He lives a lonesome life, but well
He loves the vast and silent plains
Wherein the white Merinos dwell.
Australia’s way is hard to keep
Though she is bold and fair;
O Keeper of the Shining Sheep,
Take her into Thy care!
VICTOR J. DALEY.


OUR HERITAGE.
Our heritage is more
Than all the precious ore
That lies embedded in Australia’s breast,
Than all the golden grain
That ripens on our plain,
Than countless leagues of pasture land from furthest
east and west.
Beneath the azure skies
Our new-born cities rise,
We count our ships from every wind that blows;
But wealth makes not a State,
We cannot thus be great —
It was not by her trade alone that England’s
Empire rose.
No, but by holding fast
Traditions of the past,
By winning freedom after years of strife,
Till her heroic name
A trumpet call became
That stirred men’s hearts to purchase liberty with
life.


This is her golden dower,
Not commerce, wealth, or power,
But that equality which England gave;
Who bade her sons be true
To her from whence they drew
Their hatred of the demagogue, the tyrant, and the
slave.
God grant our sons be strong
To right the hidden wrong,
To love the spirit of their country’s laws,
To waver not or bend,
To seek a worthy end,
To scorn a mean ambition and a base applause.
May they be strong to rise
Above all party cries,
Above the fears and terrors of the craven;
And with a steadfast heart
To play the patriot’s part,
And guide the vessel onward to a fairer haven.
JAMES L. CUTHBERTSON.


AUSTRALASIA.
Celestial poesy! whose genial sway
Earth’s furthest habitable shores obey;
Whose inspirations shed their sacred light
Far as the regions of the arctic night,
And to the Laplander his Boreal gleam
Endear not less than Phoebus’ brighter beam—
Descend thou also on my native land,
And on some mountain summit take thy stand;
Thence issuing soon a purer fount be seen
Than charmed Castalia or famed Hippocrene;
And there a richer, nobler fame arise
Than on Parnassus met the adoring eyes.
And though, bright goddess, on those far blue hills
That pour their thousand swift pellucid rills
Where Warragamba’s rage has rent in twain
Opposing mountains, thundering to the plain,
No child of song has yet invoked thy aid,
’Neath their primeval solitary shade—
Still, gracious power, some kindling soul inspire
To wake to life my country’s unknown lyre,
That from creation’s date has slumbering lain,
Or only breathed some savage uncouth strain:
And grant that yet an Austral Milton’s song,
Pactolus-like, flow deep and rich along—
An Austral Shakespeare rise, whose living page
To Nature true may charm in every age—


And that an Austral Pindar daring soar
Where not the Theban Eagle reached before.
And, O Britannia! should’st thou cease to ride
Despotic Empress of old Ocean’s tide;
Should thy tamed Lion—spent his former might—
No longer roar the terror of the fight—
Should e’er arrive that dark disastrous hour,
When, bowed by luxury, thou yield’st to power—
When thou, no longer freest of the free,
To some proud victor bend’st the vanquished knee—
May all thy glories in another sphere
Relume, and shine more brightly still than here;
May this, thy last-born infant, then arise
To glad thy heart and greet thy parent eyes;
And Australasia float, with flag unfurled,
A new Britannia in another world.
WILLIAM CHARLES WENTWORTH.
FLINDERS.
He left his island home
For leagues of sleepless foam,
For stress of alien seas,
Where wild winds ever blow;
For England’s sake he sought
Fresh fields of fame, and fought
A stormy world for these,
A hundred years ago.


And where the Austral shore
Heard southward far the roar
Of rising tides that came
From lands of ice and snow,
Beneath a gracious sky,
To fadeless memory
He left a deathless name,
A hundred years ago.
Yea, left a name sublime
From that wild dawn of Time,
Whose light he haply saw
In supreme sunrise flow,
And from the shadows vast.
That filled the dim dead past,
A brighter glory draw,
A hundred years ago.
Perchance he saw in dreams
Beside our sunlit streams
In some majestic hour
Old England’s banners blow;
Mayhap the radiant morn
Of this great nation born,
August with perfect power,
A hundred years ago.


We know not, —yet for thee
Far may the season be.
Whose harp in shameful sleep
Is soundless lying low!
Far be the noteless hour
That holds of fame no flower
For those who dared our deep,
A hundred years ago.
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA.
THE FATE OF BASS.
A.D. 180—
(A Fancy).
On the snow-line of the summit stood the Spaniard’s
English slave;
And the frighted condor westward flew afar—
Where the torch of Cotopaxi lit the wide Pacific
wave,
And the tender moon embraced a new-born star.
Blanched the cheek that Austral breezes off Van
Diemen’s coast had tanned,
Bent the form that on the deck stood stalwart
there;
Slim and pallid as a woman’s was the sailor’s sun-
burnt hand,
And untimely silver streaked the strong man’s
hair.


From the forest far beneath him came the baffled
bloodhound’s bay,
From the gusty slope the camp-fire’s fitful glow;
But the pass the Indian told of o’er the cliff beside
him lay,
And beyond—the Mighty River’s eastward flow.
“Mine the secret of the Incas—to the tyrants never
told;
Mine the Cloven Rock—the league-long Sculp-
tured Way!
Ere the weary scouts awaken, ere the embers are
grown cold—
Ere the dogs in dreams their quarry seize and
slay!”
Freedom’s threshold!—yet he tarries—gazes sea-
ward, southward still,
Past the gulfs where fainting chain-gangs toil
entombed,
And the furnace of the smelter taints the winds of
every hill
With the fumes that swathe the dying and the
doomed.
Never, never, gallant seaman, may the land that lit
thy dreams
In the starless drive make glad thine eyes again—
Where through tropic heavens at midnight the
Antarctic glory streams,
And a sea of blossom floods the wintry plain.


Nevermore the settler’s welcome, at the sinking of
the sun,
Nor his godspeed ’mid the fragrant Austral morn!
Shattered, spent, and broken-hearted —yet a guerdon
Thou hast won,
And where brave souls meet thou shalt not stand
forlorn.
MARY HANNAY FOOTT.
THE NATION BUILDERS.
A handful of workers seeking the star of a strong
intent—
A handful of heroes scattered to conquer a conti-
nent—
Thirst, and fever, and famine, drought, and ruin,
and flood.
And the bones that bleach on the sandhill, and the
spears that redden with blood,
And the pitiless might of the molten skies, at noon,
on the sun-cracked plain,
And the walls of the northern jungles shall front
them ever in vain,
Till the land that lies like a giant asleep shall wake
to the victory won,
And the hearts of the Nation Builders shall know
that the work is done.
To North, on the seas of summer, where the pearl
flotillas swim,
To East, where the axe is ringing in the heart of the
ranges grim,


On the plains where the free wind bloweth by never
a tree or shrub.
On the pine-topped slopes where the settler carves
a home in the tropic scrub,
On fields where the miner sleeps unstirred by the
ceaseless monotone
And crash of the stampers night and day at work
on the milk-white stone,
Tis war and stress, with never a pause to mourn for
a stout heart gone,
Till the souls of the Nation Builders shall know
that the work is done.
On the deck of the lonely light-ship, in the sand of
the new-found West,
Where strong men fall and die like sheep in the
thirst of the golden quest.
By the dry stock routes, by the burnt-up creeks,
where the cattle sink and fail,
By the coral-reefs, where the beching boats swing
on ’neath the sun-tanned sail,
In the wild ravine where the searcher’s gold is
bought with his own heart’s blood,
In the dark of the drive where the miner’s life goes
out with the swirling flood,
Tis war and stress, with never a pause to mourn
for a stout heart gone,
Till the lives of the Nation Builders have paid for
the victory won.


In the glare and steam of the cities, the thunder and
clatter of wheel,
By the teeming wharves, where the liners lie at rest
on an even keel,
In the strife of a swelling commerce, at the desk in
the dull routine
Where the soul of a man is warped and sunk to the
soul of a mere machine.
In the flash of the wire to west and north, in the
hum of the restless street,
In the pulse of the toiling press that beats all night
in a fever heat,
Where the weary brain and the pen plod on ’neath
the white electric light—
Tho’ we fail and fall still the fight goes on; and ever
our sons shall fight,
Till the land that lies like a giant asleep shall wake
to the victory won,
And the hearts of the Nation Builders shall know
that the work is done.
We are but the hands of the Builder, who toileth
and frameth afar
System, and order, and sequence; sun, and planet,
and star—
Faint sparks of a Mighty Genius, a breath of the
Over-Soul,
Who shapes the thought of the workers wherever
his worlds may roll.


On tho’ we grope and blunder, the trend of our
aim is true;
On! there is death in dalliance whilst yet there is
work to do;
Till the land that lies like a giant asleep shall wake
to the victory won,
And the eyes of the Master Worker shall see that
the work is done.
GEORGE ESSEX EVANS.
MEN OF AUSTRALIA.
Men of all the lands Australian from the Gulf to
Derwent River,
From the Heads of Sydney Harbour to the waters
of the West,
There’s a spirit loudly calling where the saplings
dip and quiver,
Where the city crowds are thronging, and the
range uplifts its crest!
Do ye feel the holy fervour of a new-born exultation?
For the task the Lord has set us is a trust of
noblest pride—
We are named to march unblooded to the winning
of a nation,
And to crown her with a glory that may evermore
abide.

Jessie Mackay




Have ye locked to great old nations, have ye
wondered at their making,
Seen their fair and gracious cities, gemmed with
palaces of light,
Felt the pulse of mighty engines beating ever, never
slaking,
Like the sandalled feet of Progress moving
onward in the night?
Can ye stand on some high headland when the
drowsy day is fading,
And in dreamlike fancy see a merchant fleet upon
the seas,
See the pinioned ships majestic ’gainst the purple
even sailing
And the busy steamers racing down to half a
thousand quays?
Have ye dreamed of this or seen of this, and feel ye
no elation
O er the most heroic duty that a free-born people
knows ?
To the chain of kindred nations ours to link another
nation,
Ours to stay and build and bless her for a future
great as those!
Cold and sordid hearts may linger still to bargain
over trifles,
But the big-souled men have only hate for huck-
stering and sloth;


These would batter down division, tear away the
bonds that stifle,
And would free our dear Australia for the larger,
nobler growth.
Bushmen, roaming on the ridges, tracking “colours ’
to their sources,
Swinging axes by the rivers where the millsaws
rend and shriek,
Smoking thoughtful pipes, or dreaming on your
slow, untroubled horses,
While the lazy cattle feed along the track or ford
the creek,
Ye have known our country’s moods in all her wild
and desert places,
Ye have felt the sweet, strange promptings that
her solitudes inspire;
To have breathed the spirit of her is to love her —
turn your faces,
Ride like lovers when the day dawns, ride to serve
her, son and sire!
Miners in the dripping workings, farmers, pioneers
who settle
On the bush lands, city workers of the benches
and the marts,
Swart mechanics at the forges, beating out the
glowing metal,
Thinkers, planners, if ye feel the love of country
stir your hearts,


Help to write the bravest chapter of a fair young
nation’s story—
Great she’ll be as Europe’s greatest, more
magnificent in ruth!
That our children’s children standing in the rose
light of her glory
May all honour us who loved her, and who
crowned her in her youth!
EDWARD DYSON.
THE GREY COMPANY.
O the grey, grey company
Of the pallid dawn!
O the ghostly faces
Ashen-like and drawn!
The Lord’s lone sentinels
Dotted down the years,
The little grey company
Before the pioneers.
Dreaming of Utopias
Ere the time was ripe,
They awoke to scorning,
The jeering and the strife.
Dreaming of millenniums
In a world of wars,
They awoke to shudder
At a flaming Mars.


In each other’s faces
Looked the pioneers;
Drank the wine of courage
All their battle years.
For their w T eary sowing
Through the world wide,
Green they saw the harvest
Ere the day they died.
But the grey, grey company
Stood every man alone
In the chilly dawnlight;
Scarcely had they known,
Ere the day the}? perished,
That their beacon-star
Was not glint of marsh-light
In the shadows far.
The brave white witnesses
To the truth within
Took the dart of folly,
Took the jeer of sin;
Crying, “Follow, follow.
Back to Eden gate!’’
They trod the Polar desert,
Met a desert fate.
Be laurel to the victor.
And roses to the fair,
And asphodel Elysian
Let the hero wear;


But lay the maiden lilies
Upon their narrow biers —
The lone grey company
Before the pioneers.
JESSIE MACKAY.
CAPE BYRON.
Upon the orient utmost of the land,
Enfranchised of the world, alone, and free,
I stood; before me, and on either hand,
The interminable solace of the sea.
A white-winged hour of heaven, a fugitive
Of which the angels wist not, hither fled,
Whose plumy, rustling whispers bid me live
Its length of moments as if grief were dead.
Oh, memorable hour of beauteous things!
The heaving azure melting into light;
The chequered sport of fleet o’ershadowings;
The nearer emerald curling into white;
The shoreward billows merging each in each,
To sunder yet again, fold, and unfold;
The shining curve of far-receptive beach;
The silvery wave-kiss on the gladdened gold;
The grandeur of the lone old promontory;
The distant bourne of hills in purple guise
Athrob with soft enchantment; high in glory
The Peak of Warning bosomed in the skies!


Oh, all too fair to be so seldom seen,
This shadowy purple on the mountains sleeping
This sapphire of unutterable sheen—
This beauty-harvest ever ripe for reaping!
For what high end is all this daily boon,
Unseen of man, in sightless silence spent?
Doth lavish Nature vainly importune
The unconscious witness of the firmament?
Or is it that the influent God, whose breath
Informs with glory sea and shore and hill,
His infinite lone rejoicing nourisheth
Upon the beauteous outcome of His will?
Or is it but a patient waiting-while
Against the day when many an eye shall bless,
From lowly cottage and imperial pile,
This wide tranquillity of loveliness; —
Against a day of many-thronging feet,
Of virtues, valours, all that builds and saves—
Of human loves responsive to the sweet
Melodious importunity of waves?
I only know that this empurpled range,
This golden shore, this great transcendent sea,
Are now a memory that will not change
Till I become as they—a memory.
BRUNTON STEPHENS.


THE GOLDEN YESTERDAY.
After a spell of chill, grey weather,
(Green, O green, are the feet of Spring!)
The heaven is here of flower and feather,
Of wild red blossom and flashing wing.
Hither of old queer flotsam drifted,
Borne from afar on an age-old stream —
Men and women, with hope uplifted,
Spurred and stirred by a splendid dream.
Hither they quested—the young and eager,
The social misfit, the aged, the banned;
Friends were lacking and fortune meagre,
And here was promise—the Promised Land.
Each had a hope, a star, a beacon —
A good-bye smile, or a gold love-tress —
To urge his feet lest his feet should weaken,
Drag and falter with weariness.
Love and honour, and mirth and pity—
The joy that brightens, the gloom that chills—
Dwelt at once in the tented city,
Set of old in these watching hills.


The birds aroused them with matin numbers;
The air was scented v/ith waking flowers;
They woke renewed from their starlit slumbers,
They toiled, dream-warmed, through the sunlit
hours.
They had their triumphs, their gains, their losses.
Their noons of laughter, their nights of care;
Back on the hills are some rough crosses—
A name ... a date . . . and, perchance, a prayer
It seems like a dream that flashed and flitted,
That reigned a moment and passed away,
And only the earth—its kind face pitted—
Tells the tale of that old, dead day.
They dug the clay, and they broke the boulders,
They turned the creek, and they washed the
mould,
But vain as makers and vain as moulders,
They lived and wrought in the Age of Gold.
They worked and worried—their labour blotching
The land’s green surface with scar and pit;
Yet, all around them the hills were watching
Flower-crowned, tree-crested and glory-lit.
Like time-worn sages the green hills waited—
Clouds round their foreheads, their hips in grass
They knew that the man at their feet was fated,
That he and the work of his hands would pass.


A breeze comes down from the highlands smoothing
The green young wheat, and a bird makes mirth,
And Spring is here with soft hands soothing
The ruined rocks and the wounded earth.
The diggers passed: and the last red embers
Of their night-fires—they are ashen grey;
But, while hearts beat and the mind remembers,
They shall not fade as a dream away.
RODERIC QUINN.
THE EXPLORERS.
Lift ye your faces to the sky,
Ye far blue mountains of the west,
Who lie so peacefully at rest
Enshrouded in a haze of blue;
’Tis hard to feel that years went by
Before the pioneers broke through
Your rocky heights and walls of stone,
And made your secrets all their own.
For years the fertile western plains
Were hid behind your sullen walls,
Your cliffs and crags and waterfalls,
All weatherworn with tropic rains.


Between the mountains and the sea,
Like Israelites with staff in hand,
The people waited restlessly;
They looked towards the mountains old
And saw the sunsets come and go
With gorgeous golden afterglow,
That made the West a fairyland,
And marvelled what that West might be
Of which such wondrous tales were told.
For tales were told of inland seas
Like sullen oceans, salt and dead,
And sandy deserts, white and wan,
Where never trod the foot of man,
Nor bird went winging overhead,
Nor ever stirred a gracious breeze
To wake the silence with its breath—
A land of loneliness and death.
At length the hardy pioneers
By rock and crag found out the way,
And woke with voices of to-day,
A silence kept for years and years.
Upon the Western slope they stood
And saw a wide expanse of plain,
As far as eye could stretch or see,
Go rolling westward endlessly.
The native grasses, tall as grain,
Were waved and rippled in the breeze;
From boughs of blossom-laden trees
The parrots answered back again.


They saw the land that it was good,
A land of fatness all untrod,
And gave their silent thanks to God.
The way is won! The way is won!
And straightway from the barren coast
There came a westward-marching host,
That aye and ever onward prest
With eager faces to the west,
Along the pathway of the sun.
The mountains saw them marching by;
They faced the all-consuming drought;
They would not rest in settled land:
But, taking each his life in hand,
Their faces ever westward bent
Beyond the farthest settlement,
Responding to the challenge cry
Of “better country further out.”
And lo! a miracle.. The land
But yesterday was all unknown,
The wild man’s boomerang was thrown
Where now great busy cities stand.
It was not much, you say, that these
Should win their way where none withstood
In sooth there was not much of blood,
No war was fought between the seas.


It was not much! But we who know
The strange capricious land they trod—
At times a stricken, parching sod,
At times with raging floods beset—
Through which they found their lonely way.
Are quite content that you should say
“It was not much,” while we can feel
That nothing in the ages old,
In song or story written yet
On Grecian urn or Roman arch,
Though it should ring with clash of steel,
Could braver histories unfold
Than this bush story, yet untold—
The story of their westward march.
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON.
GONE.
In Collins Street standeth a statue tall— *
A statue tall on a pillar of stone,
Telling its story, to great and small,
Of the dust reclaimed from the sand waste lone
Weary and wasted, and worn and wan,
Feeble and faint, and languid and low,
He lay on the desert a dying man,
Who has gone, my friends, where we all must go.
The Burke snd Wills monument, since removed to
Spring Street, Melbourne.


There are perils by land, and perils by water,
Short, I ween, are the obsequies
Of the landsman lost, but they may be shorter
With the mariner lost in the trackless seas;
And well for him, when the timbers start,
And the stout ship reels and settles below,
Who goes to his doom with as bold a heart
As that dead man gone where we all must go.
Man is stubborn his rights to yield,
And redder than dews at eventide
Are the dews of battle, shed on the field
By a nation’s wrath or a despot’s pride;
But few who have heard their death-knell roll
From the cannon’s lips where they faced the foe,
Have fallen as stout and steady of soul
As that dead man gone where we all must go.
Traverse yon spacious burial-ground—
Many are sleeping soundly there,
Who pass’d with mourners standing around,
Kindred, and friends, and children fair;
Did he envy such ending? ’twere hard to say;
Had he cause to envy such ending? no;
Can the spirit feel for the senseless clay
When it once has gone where we all must go?
What matters the sand or the whitening chalk,
The blighted herbage, the black’ning log,
The crooked beak of the eagle-hawk,
Or the hot red tongue of the native dog?


That couch was rugged, those sextons rude,
Yet, in spite of a leaden shroud, we know
That the bravest and fairest are earth-worms’ food,
When once they’ve gone where we all must go.
With the pistol clenched in his failing hand,
With the death mist spread o’er his fading eyes,
He saw the sun go down on the sand,
And he slept, and never saw it rise;
’Twas well; he toil’d till his task was done,
Constant and calm in his latest throe,
The storm was weathered, the battle was won,
When he went, my friends, where we all must go.
God grant that whenever, soon or late,
Our course is run and our goal is reach’d,
We may meet our fate as steady and straight
As he whose bones in yon desert bleach’d.
No tears are needed—our cheeks are dry,
We have none to waste upon living woe;
Shall we sigh for one who has ceased to sigh,
Having gone, my friends, where we all must go?
ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.
THE PATHWAY OF THE SUN.
Do you hear the West a-calling, brother mine?
Do you hear the West a-calling sweet and low?
Tis the voice that ever calls in shade or shine,
In madness or in gladness or in woe.


Tis the voice that through eternity and time
On the strong soul of a man lays its behest,
And the burden of its ever-beating rhyme
Is “Ever to the Westward lies man’s quest!”
In the West the prize is waiting for the bold;
In the East the days are dead and life is done;
And the banners of the sky are red and gold,
That beckon to the pathway of the sun.
Do you hear the West a-calling, brother mine?
It is calling as it called in olden days.
Voices float across the rolling plains of brine,
And rise from out the mighty water-ways:
Come, ye rovers! Come from lands all stark and
cold,
Whither lands of promise open to the view;
For the Eastward is the grave of all things old,
But the Westward is the cradle of the new!”
Lo! the hearts of men are filled with fierce unrest;
Behind, above, the skies are dark and dun;
Their life seems but the shadow of a jest;
And they turn them to the pathway of the sun.
In the dim and mist-hid centuries agone,
Where the Pamir greets the wide, blue Asian sky.
And the snowy Himalayas look upon
The broad Five Rivers ever rolling by,
The Aryan tiller through the summer days
Heard wind-borne voices from the Caspian plain;
His soul was filled with wonder and amaze,
And $ longing that might ne’er be stilled again.


The shining share became a flaming sword,
The blazing banner of red war was spun;
And waiting Europe knew him for her lord
As he marched upon the pathway of the sun.
The purple sails of Tyre and Sidon flecked
The levels of the Midmost Sea, and pressed
Beyond the frowning Pillars, for they recked
Of the wonders in the Islands of the Blest.
O'er the sea and o'er the land the legions went
From where on Rome look down the Apennines,
And their crimson steps of conquest wesward bent
To the sunlit valleys of Iberian vines,
And the steppes that meet the fertile Euxine shore
Felt the onward tread of Ottoman and Hun;
They had heard the voice that summons evermore
The rover to the pathway of the sun.
When Isabel was queen in fair Castile,
Came the voices on the billow and the breeze,
And the grey Atlantic clove before the keel
That bore the lion-hearted Genoese.
From the Douro’s valley Colon’s doing led
Twin lords of war and rapine in his wake;
Weak Montezuma’s empery was sped,
When Cortez saw the City of the Lake;
The gentle Inca kissed Pizarro’s sv/ord,
And before him rich Peru was all undone;
And Spain became the tyrant and the lord
Upon the glowing pathway of the sun.

Weird wonder-tales and ocean legends tell
Red records of the cruel Spanish years;
How Panama, a pearl of cities, fell
To Morgan and the reiving buccaneers;
How sea-dogs of Queen Bess their sails unfurled—
Strong men who ever fought and never feared;
How, captained by the Treasure of the World,
Down in the Main they singed the Spaniard’s
beard.
Ye know them, England’s bravest and her best;
Ye tell their names with pride, one after one—
Drake, Gilbert, Raleigh, Hawkins and the rest,
Who sailed upon the pathway of the sun.
But half-a-hundred years have joined the dead
Old years, since, where the white Sierras loom,
The Californian foot-hills knew the tread
Of them that sink the shaft and build the flume.
Our hearts, like theirs, are dry with drouth of gold,
As Yilgarn and Pilbarra yield their store;
And Coolgardie still is calling to the bold,
And they answer as their fathers did of yore.
Lo, Gabo signs to Borda, as they go;
Their white sails gleam as past the Bight they
run;
Their path the Lioness and Rottnest know;
They are marching on the pathway of the sun.
The knell of all things dead again is knolled
To-day, as it was knolled in days that were,
And the dole that ever was to seekers doled
Is the dole again of them that do and dare.


We are born of dust that unto dust returned;
We are seed of ashes that to ashes went;
As the embers old, so embers now are burned;
As the dust of old, so dust is ever spent.
For aye and ever man his way shall wend
Where gold and glory wait him to be won,
Shall follow still the voice that has no end,
That calls him to the pathway of the sun.
J. STEELE ROBERTSON.
THE DESTROYER.
She raced away down the sunset track,
Beyond the mines and the boom;
The spray flashed red on her turtle-back
To the whirr of her engine-room.
Her funnels spouted their smoke-plumes black
She looked the spirit of doom.
Along her sides the wavelets hissed,
As she opened out her speed,
They fell astern to snarl and twist,
And writhe in her wake and bleed.
Hers was a force no seas resist,
And she gave them little heed.
Away in the west the red sun sank
To drown in the heaving flood;
And fast—with never a noisy crank
Or piston-rod a-thud,
Her stern set low in the high wave-bank—
She swam on a sea of blood.


Into the night, when the sun had gone,
The fast destroyer flew,
And never a side-light gleamed or shone
As the pale stars grew and grew.
What errand grim did she speed upon?
Only her captain knew.
Through the sweeping seas she clove a track
Into the blinding gloom—
Stumpy-funnelled, sinister, black—
She was the Spirit of Doom.
And the keen spray hailed on her turtle-back
To the throb of her engine-room.
Back to our forts the destroyer crept,
As the dawn rushed in a-flame;
Her stacks were blistered, her decks sea-swept,
But she licked her lips as she came;
And she took her place, where her comrades slept,
Like a hound that had killed its game.

A VISION OF YOUTH.
A horseman on a hilltop green
Drew rein, and wound his horn;
So bright he looked he might have been
The Herald of the Morn.


His steed was of the sovran strain
In Fancy’s meadows bred —
And pride was in his tossing mane,
And triumph in his tread.
The rider’s eyes like jewels glowed—
The World was in his hand—
As down the woodland way he rode
When Spring was in the land.
From golden hour to golden hour
For him the woodland sang,
And from the heart of every flower
A singing fairy sprang.
He rode along with rein so free,
And, as he rode, the Blue
Mysterious Bird of Fantasy
Ever before him flew.
He rode by cot and castle dim
Through all the greenland gay;
Bright eyes through casements glanced at him;
He laughed—and rode away.
The world with sunshine was aflood,
And glad were maid and man,
And through his throbbing veins the blood
In keen, sweet shudders ran.


His steed tossed head with fiery scorn,
And stamped, and snuffed the air—
As though he heard a sudden horn
Of far-off battle blare.
Erect the rider sat awhile
With flashing eyes, and then
Turned slowly, sighing, with a smile,
“O weary world of men!”
For aye the Bird of Fantasy
Sang magic songs to him,
And deep and deeper still rode he
Into the Forest Dim.
That rider with his face aglow
With joy of life I see
In dreams. Ah, years and years ago
He parted ways with me!
Yet, sometimes, when the days are drear
And all the world forlorn.
From out the dim wood’s heart I hear
The echo of his horn.

FAIRY TALES.
I chanced on an old brown book to-day,
All stained and yellow with dust and age,
But the beats of a boy’s heart, stilled for aye,
Are heard at the turning of every page.
For the old brown book was the day’s desire,
When sweet princesses and khights in mail
And guardian dragons with tongues of fire
Were marshalled to fashion a fairy tale.
I laughed at the little Tin Soldier then,
And cried for the Maiden with Heart Ice-cold;
But now they are different, maids and men,
And the lustre is gone from their garb of gold.
I am reading to-day as a man may read,
By no spell bidden or charm beguiled;
For the gem is a pebble, the flower a weed,
Till it wake to worth in the heart of a child.
I turn the pages; the old loves pass,
But I dream in their dear delight no more;
I watched them once through a rose-hued glass
I am standing now at an oaken door.
I put them aside with a sigh, a frown,
For the folk seem foolish, the wonders tame,
And I understand as I lay them down
That the stories can never be quite the same.


But I’d give the worth of the books I’ve read,
The books of the world with their wondrous lore,
Just to go back to the days long dead,
With a heart for a fairy tale once more!
WILL H. OGILVIE.
BOY-DREAMS.
I was a Pirate once,
A blustering fellow with scarlet sash,
A ready cutlass and language rash;
From a ship with a rum-filled water-tank
I made the enemy walk the plank;
I marooned a man on an island bare,
And seized his wife by her long, dark hair;
Took treasure, such heaps of it!—wealth untold—
Bright bars of silver and chunks of gold!
Till my ship was choked to the decks with pelf,
And no one dare touch it except myself!
And my black flag waved to the tearing breeze,
And I was the terror of all the seas!
I was a Fairy once.
I swung in the bows of the silky oak,
And the harebells rang to the words I spoke,
And my wings were fashioned of silver gauze,
And I knew no grief and no human laws.
I lived where the laces of green leaves sway,
And my life was one long, long holiday.


No tasks to learn, and no bothering rules,
No hectoring grown-ups, and no—more —schools
But a dance each eve, ’neath the moon’s cold light
To sit up as late as I liked at night. . . .
For a lance I carried a grass-blade green,
And my shield was cut from an olivine;
I sipped cool dews from the cups of flowers,
My days were threaded of happy hours!
I was a Merman once.
In the gloom of the amber-tinted seas,
With the brown tang clinging about my knees,
With a coral house, and a crab to ride,
Who pranced, and who ambled from side to side
I wooed a Mermaid with emerald hair,
Dragged the fierce sea-serpent from out his lair,
With his flaming tongue and his awful might,
And I slew him—easy—in open fight!
I had strings of pearls, white as frozen milk,
That were strung for me on sea-spider’s silk;
And I never pined for the upper skies,
Whose blue came down in the dead men’s eyes,
Drowned men with the salt on their blackened lips
Who slid, drifting in, from the wrecks of ships;
But I took the gold from the belts of all,
To pave the road to my coral hall.
I was a Hunter once,
And I trapped and stalked in a pathless wood,
And the talk of the wild things understood.


With my leather leggings and hat of brown,
I tracked the elk and the redskin down;
Slew a grizzly bear in a mountain cave,
And tweaked the nose of an Indian brave,
Ere I shot the rapids in birch canoe—
For there was nothing I could not do.
There was naught I did not dare or enjoy,
In the magic world of a dreaming boy!

SAINT HUBERT.
Comrades, to the woodlands come!
Thrice afar the tasselled horn
Pours a soul’s elysium
Thro’ the white wake of the morn.
Thrice the buck has hearkened still,
Buried in the umber shades;
Thrice the gleby-wandering rill
Answers ere the bugle fades.
Over yonder granite peak,
Circled with a fleecy film.
Leaps the glad sun’s flaming streak,
Kissing all his verdured realm.
Unpremeditated hymns
Pour from feathered-throated choirs,
Every note with joy o’erbrims,
Every heart to soar aspires!


Thrice afar the tasselled horn
Pours a soul’s elysium
Through the white wake of the morn—
Comrades, to the woodlands come!

THE ELIZABETHANS.
Great shadows of heroic men
That worked your dreaming into deed,
Ye breathe upon us, as we read,
The spirit that inspired you then
To live as nobly as ye wrote!
We, too, we later Englishmen,
Too prone, perhaps, to seek the pen,
Would catch your echoes as they float
Down that strong wind that hurries on
The eddying centuries of time,
Leaves scattered by an early rime
From the age-old ash earth rests upon.
We, too, whom every varying gust
Bends to some newer, vaguer creed,
Too proud, almost, to own a need,
Too doubting even ourselves to trust,
We rise, inspirited by you,
Beyond the fog’s illusive power,
And breathe for one reviving hour
The air wherein our fathers grew.

WORDS.
Words are deeds. The words we hear
May revolutionise or rear
A mighty state. The words we read
May be a spiritual deed
Excelling any fleshly one,
As much as the celestial sun
Transcends a bonfire, made to throw
A light upon some raree-show.
A simple proverb tagged with rhyme
May colour half the course of time;
The pregnant saying of a sage
May influence every coming age;
A song in its effects may be
More glorious than Thermopylae,
And many a lay that schoolboys scan
A nobler feat than Inkerman.
CHARLES HARPUR
POETS AND KINGS.
To be a poet is to stand
Upon the dais and right hand
Of warlike Caesar. Gods and kings
Were but the very dust of things.


Did not old Homer (and his crew
Of the lesser measure) grandly strew
Their fitful progress with the bays
Of deathless triumph-songs of praise?
Each deed of martial enterprise,
Of royal bounty, straightway dies,
Save only when the magic fire
Of Genius gives it to his lyre. .
A king is but a mess of clay
Set i’ the light, then put away,
A house of worms, a wealth of dearth,
His tomb a pock-mark on the earth .
But he who drinks of Helicon
Has life eternal surely won.
He is the scabbard to that sword
Which, left alone, without its ward,
Would rust its inches meanly down,
While fatted fools enjoy the crown
It once had fought for in the stream
Of heavy battles . . . Ah, the gleam
Is fresh as ever, underneath
The scrolling bay-leaves of its sheath,
And men shall tremble at the name—
“Excalibur.’' . . . Such is the fame
That poets hold and poets give—
To live in making others live!
HUGH McCRAE


SETTLERS.
If the gods of Hellas do not tread our shaggy
mountains,
Stately, white-and-golden, with unfathomable
eyes:
Yet the lesser spirits haunt our forests and ou
fountains,
Seas and green-brown river-pools no thirsty sui\
mer dries.
Never through the tangled scrub we see Diana
glisten,
Silver-limbed and crescent-crowned and swift to
hear and turn,
When the chase is hottest and the woods are waked
to listen,
While her maidens follow, running knee-deep in
the fern.
Of the great gods only Pan walks hourly here—
Pan only;
In the warm, dark gullies, in the thin clear upland
air,
On the windy sea-cliffs and the plains apart and
lonely,
By the tingling silence you may know that he is
there.


But the sea nymphs make our shores shine gay with
light and laughter;
At the sunset, when the waves are mingled milk
and fire,
You may see them very plain, and in the darkness
after
You may hear them singing with the stars’ great
golden choir.
When the earth is mad with song some blue Sep-
tember morning,
In the grove of myall trees that rustle green
and grey,
Through the plumes of trailing leaves hung meet
for her adorning
See a dark-browed Dryad peep, and swiftly draw
away!
In the deep-cut river-beds set thick with moss-
grown boulders,
Where the wagtails come to drink, and balance
lest they fall,
You may see the gleaming of a Naiad’s slippery
shoulders.
And the water sliding cool and quiet over all.
Through the narrow gorges where the flying-foxes
muster.
Hanging from the kurrajongs like monstrous
magic grapes,


Something spreads a sudden fear that breaks each
heavy cluster—
See the furry prick-eared faun that chuckles and
escapes!
Marble-smooth and marble-pale the blue gums
guard the clearing
Where the winter fern is gold among the silver
grass,
And the shy bush creatures watching, bright-eyed
and unfearing,
See the slender Oreads while we unheeding pass.
Wreathed with starry clematis these tread the
grassy spaces,
When the moon sails up beyond the highest
screening tree,
All the forest dances, and the furthest hidden places
Are astir with beauty—but we may not often see.
Centuries before the golden vision came to find us,
Showing us the Southern lands, these Grecians
settled here:
Now they throng the country, but our little hurries
blind us,
And we must be reverent ere the least of them
appear.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.


ODE TO APOLLO.
“Tandem venias precamur
Nube candentes humeros amictus
Augur Apollo.”
Lord of the golden lyre
Fraught with the Dorian fire,
Oh! fair-haired child of Leto, come again;
And if no longer smile
Delphi or Delos’ isle,
Come from the depth of thine y*Etnean glen,
Where in the black ravine
Thunders the foaming green
Of waters writhing far from mortals’ ken;
Come o’er the sparkling brine,
And bring thy train divine—
The sweet-voiced and immortal violet-crowned Nine
For here are richer meads,
And here are goodlier steeds
Than ever graced the glorious land of Greece;
Here waves the yellow corn,
Here is the olive born—
The gray-green gracious harbinger of peace;
Here too hath taken root
A tree with golden fruit,
In purple clusters hangs the vine’s increase,
And all the earth doth wear
The dry clear Attic air
That lifts the soul to liberty, and frees the heart
from care.

Or if thy wilder mood
Incline to solitude,
Eternal verdure girds the lonely hills,
Through the green gloom of ferns
Softly the sunset burns,
Cold from the granite flow the mountain rills;
And there are inner shrines
Made by the slumberous pines,
Where the rapt heart with contemplation fills,
And from wave-stricken shores
Deep wistful music pours
And floods the tempest-shaken forest corridors
Oh, give the gift of gold—
The human heart to hold
With liquid glamour of the Lesbian line,
With Pindar’s lava glow,
With Sophocles’ calm flow,
Or Aeschylean rapture airy fine ;
Or with thy music’s close
Thy last autumnal rose,
Theocritus of Sicily, divine;
O Pythian Archer strong,
Time cannot do thee wrong,
With thee they live for ever, thy nightingales
Song.
We too are island-born;
Oh, leave us not in scorn—
A songless people never yet was great.


We, suppliants at thy feet,
Await thy muses sweet
Amid the laurels at thy temple gate,
Crownless and voiceless yet —
But on our brows is set
The dim unwritten prophecy of fate,
To mould from out of mud
An empire with our blood,
To wage eternal warfare with the fire and flood.
Lord of the minstrel choir,
Oh, grant our hearts’ desire,
To sing of truth invincible in might,
Of love surpassing death
That fears no fiery breath,
Of ancient inborn reverence for right,
Of that sea-woven spell
That from Trafalgar fell
And keeps the star of duty in our sight:
Oh, give the sacred fire,
And our weak lips inspire
With laurels of thy song and lightnings of thy lyre
JAMES L, CUTHBERTSON.


APOLLO IN AUSTRALIA.
I know the shaded grove where Dryads meet
To cull the earliest pine-cones for the brows
Of young Apollo listless with the heat—
Ambrosial dews on the adoring grass
Anoint the print of his immortal feet.
I know his favourite dell, with water there
That slides to silver and a fall of pearls,
Showering their beauty on the sunset air;
A deep seclusion where a bell-bird chimes,
And violets blow, with mosses everywhere.
I know the sacred bower wherein he sings—
Perfumed by wattles when they burst in gold,
And in processions wind like Eastern kings.
Sometimes I hear the throbbing of his lyre
In gullies listening as to woodland springs.
I know the arbour where the Muses sleep,
The shadowy, eerie whispers of the pines,
The falls that furl to white plumes on the steep,
The soulful stillness of the slumbering hills,
The moonlight trance of the mysterious deep.
ARTHUR BAYLDON.


A RACING EIGHT.
Who knows it not, who loves it not,
The long and steady swing,
The instant dip, the iron grip,
The rowlocks’ linked ring,
The arrowy sway of hands away,
The slider oiling aft,
The forward sweep, the backward leap
That speed the flying craft?
A racing eight of perfect mould,
True to the builder’s law,
That takes the water’s gleaming gold
Without a single flaw.
A ship deep, resonant within,
Harmonious to the core.
That vibrates to her polished skin
The tune of wave and oar.
A racing eight and no man late,
And all hearts in the boat;
The men who work and never shirk,
Who long to be afloat.
The crew who burn from stem to stern
To win the foremost place,
The crew to row, the boat to go
The eight to win the race.
JAMES L. CUTHBERTSON


SENLAC.
O, the sun shone down on Senlac, and it flung the
mists before it.
And it warmed them through their armour as they
waded in the sea,
And it flashed upon the standard so the mail-clad
might that bore it
Hurled his war-song on before it,
Till the sea-cliffs caught the clangour and gave birth
to melody.
Iron melody.
Now aloud cried Norman William, through his
ruddy beard laughing,
As he shook aloft his double-headed death-axe
joyously,
“Lads, here England lies before us, full of ale for
each man’s quaffing,
Full of lasses lithe and laughing,
And a throne that Saxon Harold, forsworn Harold,
warms for me;
Shall we back to sea?”
Then a shout rang, that rebounded from the hollow
vault of heaven,
And there flashed across the sea’s face longswords
silverly;
So spied William far off armour: “Lads,” he called,
“Here’s welcome given!
Let us send our hosts to heaven;


Give them rather heaven than England; that we’ll
hold, as anciently
Northmen Normandy.”
On the short-grassed hill-top Harold, on his twisted
bull-hide bending,
Eyed the blood-rust on his war-sword, and he eyed
it wearily;
Yet his slackened sinews tightened: “Saxons,” called
he, “make an ending!
See the Norman bowstaves bending
Let us drive them as we drove the Danes, to drink
the bitter sea!”
And they cheered him, cheerily.
So the swift shafts sang together like a flight of war-
birds whirring,
That through shield and helm and byrnie thrust
keen beaks eagerly;
And the grim war-eagles gathered where the crushed
corpse yet was stirring,
And the grey wolves watched their whirring,
And the Valkyrs reaped their harvest in the
meadows by the sea,
Choosing silently.
As along the windy heaven flares the full moon,
stormy-wreathed,
Flared he helmless through the foemen, fair-haired
Harold, furiously,


And the winged-helms flashed and faded as the stars
in heaven are sheathed
When the yellow moon’s unwreathed,
For his battle-edge through bone and brain bit deep
and deathfully.
Gods, what a sight to see!
Quoth then Norman William’s cunning to his
archers, “Aim ye higher,
Let us give them rain from heaven an they fight so
thirstily!”
So the Saxon shield-ring shivered in the flaming hail
of fire,
And to Harold, towering higher,
Soft and sweet the Valkyrs whispered, and a
feathered death found he,
Swiftly and silently.
O, the harvest moon glows mellow on the vultures’
harvest peeping,
And the grey wolf snarls beneath the moon where
red-toothed slinketh he,
For amid the gleaming battle-wrack there kneels a
woman, weeping,
Midst death-grey faces peeping:
What’s that grim thing her unbound hair falls over,
goldenly?
O Heav’n, that let this be!
H. M. GREEN.


ELAND’S RIVER.
It was on the fourth of August, as five hundred of
us lay
In the camp at Eland’s River, came a shell from
De la Rey—
We were dreaming of home faces,
Of the old familiar places,
And the gum trees and the sunny plains five thou-
sand miles away—
But the challenge woke and found us
With four thousand rifles round us;
And Death stood laughing at us at the breaking of
the day.
Hell belched upon our borders, and the battle had
begun.
Our Maxims jammed: we faced them with one
muzzle-loading gun.
East, south, and west, and nor’ward
Their shells came screaming forward
As we threw the sconces round us in the first light
of the sun.
The thin air shook with thunder
As they raked us fore and under,
And the cordon closed around us, as they held us—
eight to one.


We got the Maxims going, and the field gun into
place
(She stilled the growling of a Krupp upon our
southern face);
Round the crimson ring of battle
Swiftly ran the deadly rattle
As our rifles searched their fore-lines with a des-
perate menace;
Who would wish himself away
Fighting in our ranks that day
For the glory of Australia and the honour of the
race?
But our horse-lines soon were shambles, and our
cattle lying dead
(When twelve guns rake two acres there is little
room to tread),
All day long we heard the drumming
Of the Mauser bullets humming,
And at night their guns, day-sighted, rained fierce
havoc overhead.
Twelve long days and nights together,
Through the cold and bitter weather,
We lay grim behind the sconces, and returned them
lead for lead.
They called us to surrender, and they let their
cannon lag;
They offered us our freedom for the striking of the
flag—
Army stores were there in mounds,
Worth a hundred thousand pounds,


we lay battered round them behind trench and
sconce and crag.
But we sent the answer in,
They could take what they could win—
hadn’t come five thousand miles to fly the
coward’s rag.
saw the guns of Carrington come on and fall
away;
saw the ranks of Kitchener across the kopje
grey—
For the sun was shining then
Upon twenty thousand men—
we laughed, because we knew, in spite of hell-
fire and delay,
On Australia’s page for ever
We had written Eland’s River—
had written it for ever and a day!
GEORGE ESSEX EVANS.
A SONG OF THE AIR.
The liner drives with her sunken blades,
The mail with her whirling wheels
That fly the levels and leap the grades
And roar where a tall bridge reels.
Yet they are slow as the tides are slow
In the race with the ocean wind.
We watch them hurrying far below
And we leave them far behind.


As we lift and soar on the planes that cry
With the strain of the awful speed.
We are the lords of the upper sky.
O little men, give heed!
The sun sinks red to the westward,
A blue haze spreads below,
While eastward and south there shimmers
The golden after-glow.
With glorious space around us
Around us the twilight fades
In a silence only broken
By the swift propeller blades.
Then stars come out of day dreams
Shining, some timid, some full,
And white, on the mists reflecting,
The lights of our long, lean hull.
Onward at speed that reckons
By hours where we told by days
On the tortuous, earthen railways
And the old, slow, ocean ways.
There are lights to the port and starboard
And a great, white glare far down,
Where, girt by her bays, half-lolling,
Dreams wondrous Sydney Town.
Our strong vibrator quivers
Its warning across the night
The call of the fast mail-flyer,
And the lights swerve left and right.


Inward, from San Francisco
A long white ship sweeps by,
A bell on her bridge deck tolling
Lone notes to a lonely sky.
And, dropping down to her moorings,
The Indian liner swings,
Ablaze like a clasp of jewels
Made for a line of kings.
So the lights pass on and darken
And only the bright stars shine
As we leap full-speed to the eastward,
The fastest ship of the line.
With Ocean a mile below us,
Wrapped in her cloak of gray,
The world-winds, passing, whimper
At the ship that thwarts their sway
And held in the hull there mutters
The god of the wild machine
That drives us, quivering, swaying
Where only the gods have been.
Watch after watch, Night wearies,
Dawn sees us floating down
To the silvery, gleaming water
That dreams by Auckland Town.
The liner drives with her head to sea
And her wild screws kicking high.
The fast express was a thing to see
At night, in the years gone by.


But these be slow and tardy things,
And scorned by men who fly
On ships that rise on poised wings
And beat their hearts in the sky.
Lifting up on planes that moan
With the strain of the awful speed;
We are the lords of the higher zone—
O men of the earth, take heed!
WILL LAWSON.
THE BALLAD OF THE CALLIOPE.
By the far Samoan shore,
Where the league-long rollers pour
All the wash of the Pacific on the coral-guarded bay,
Riding lightly at their ease,
In the calm of tropic seas,
The three great nations’ warships at their anchors
proudly lay.
Riding lightly, head to wind,
With the coral reefs behind,
Three Germans and three Yankee ships were mir-
rored in the blue;
And on one ship unfurled
Was the flag that rules the world—
For on the old Calliope the flag of England flew.


When the gentle off-shore breeze,
That had scarcely stirred the trees,
Dropped down to utter stillness, and the glass began
to fall,
Away across the main
Lowered the coming hurricane,
And far away to seaward hung the cloud wrack like
a pall.
If the word had passed around,
“Let us move to safer ground;
Let us steam away to seaward”—then this tale were
not to tell!
But each captain seemed to say,
“If the others stay, I stay!”
And they lingered at their moorings till the shades
of evening fell.
Then the cloud wrack neared them fast,
And there came a sudden blast,
And the hurricane came leaping down a thousand
miles of main!
Like a lion on its prey,
Leapt the storm-fiend on the bay,
And the vessels shook and shivered as their cables
felt the strain.
As the surging seas came by
That were running mountains high,
The vessels started dragging, drifting slowly to the
lee;


And the darkness of the night
Hid the coral reefs from sight,
And the captains dared not risk the chance to grope
their way to sea.
In the dark they dared not shift!
They were forced to wait and drift;
All hands stood by uncertain would the anchors hold
or no.
But the men on deck could see
If a chance of hope might be—
There was little chance of safety for the men who
were below.
Through that long, long night of dread,
While the storm raged overhead,
They were waiting by their engines, with the fur-
nace fires a-roar.
So they waited staunch and true,
Though they knew, and well they knew,
They must drown like rats imprisoned if the vessel
touched the shore.
When the grey dawn broke at last,
And the long, long night was past,
While the hurricane redoubled, lest its prey should
steal away.
On the rocks, all smashed and strown,
Were the German vessels thrown,
While the Yankees, swamped and helpless, drifted
shorewards down the bay.


Then at last spoke Captain Kane,
“All our anchors are in vain,
And the Germans and the Yankees they have
drifted to the lee!
Cut the cables at the bow!
We must trust the engines now!
Give her steam, and let her have it, lads; we’ll fight
her out to sea! ’
And the answer came with cheers
From the stalwart engineers,
From the grim and grimy firemen at the furnaces
below;
And above the sullen roar
Of the breakers on the shore
Came the throbbing of the engines, as they laboured
to and fro.
If the strain should find a flaw,
Should a bolt or rivet draw,
Then God help them! for the vessel were a play-
thing in the tide!
With a face of honest cheer,
Quoth an English engineer,
“I will answer for the engines that were built on old
Thames side!
For the stays and stanchions taut,
For the rivets truly wrought,
For the valves that fit their faces as a glove should
fit the hand.

Give her every ounce of power;
If we make a knot an hour,
Then it’s way enough to steer her, and we’ll drive
her from the land.”
Like a foam-flake tossed and thrown,
She could barely hold her own,
While the other ships all helplessly were drifting
to the lee.
Through the smother and the rout
The Calliope steamed out—
And they cheered her from the Trenton that was
foundering in the sea.
Ay! drifting shoreward there,
All helpless as they were,
Their vessels hurled upon the reefs as weed ashore
is hurled,
Without a thought of fear
The Yankees raised a cheer—
A cheer that English-speaking folk should echo
round the world.

THE SEA-SEEKERS
The four of us were inland born
And inland reared from infancy,
And—though the tale be food for scorn
We four had never seen the Sea.
We saw the sun by day, by night
The stars threw down their radiance keen;
These things we held a goodly sight,
But still the Sea remained unseen.
The sunlit plains about us spread
Mile after mile on every side,
But still, the sea-wise people said,
The blue salt waste was wondrous wide.
On lonely rides and desert tramps,
And when we searched in rain and dew
The breathing dark of cattle-camps,
A longing came and thrilled us through.
We dreamt of waters spreading far,
Of winding bay and shining reach,
Of shouting reef and growling bar
And breakers crashing down a beach.
The longing grew, we could not rest;
A vision beautiful and brave
Allured us to a mighty quest
Of rolling sea and crested wave.


The four of us were inland born
And inland reared from infancy;
We mounted early in the morn,
And, riding gaily, sought the Sea.
We rode by day and camped by night,
And night and day dreamed evermore
Of dawns that broke in rosy light
On curling wave and crescent shore.
The red sun sank upon our quest,
The shadows fell, and in the dark
There was no light in East or West,
Save where our camp-fire burned—a spark
At times it seemed that we could hear
The sound of breakers in their fall—
We drew our reins, and, hand to ear,
We listened to the distant call.
A stillness reigned from East to West,
The trees and mountains seemed to swoon
And weirdly paling in the West
Went down the late and lonely moon.
And while the white moon slowly fell,
A scented breeze of morning blew,
Though inland-born we knew it well—
That odour keen and strange and new.


Then something seemed to burst its chains;
A wave of joy and wonder broke
Across our souls, and in our veins
An ancient Viking stirred and woke.
A sound of breakers came to stir
Our blood and thrill us with delight,
And neck and neck with whip and spur
We galloped headlong through the night
The moon had sunk, but in the sky
We saw the Dawn’s first light of grey,
And straight as feathered arrows fly,
We thundered on to meet the Day.
Afar we saw the shore line loom,
Our horses, springing freely, strode;
And, suddenly, in purple gloom
The sea gave greeting as we rode.
We galloped on, nor ever ceased
Till gloriously in golden fire
The sun uprose, and in the East
We reached the goal of our desire.
We pushed our horses through the foam,
The ocean swirled about their knees;
And underneath the golden dome
We shouted to the Morning Seas.
RODERIC QUINN.


JANUARY.
O January! January! bind your ruffled hair
And look no longer at us with that bold and brazen
stare,
And lift your feet from off the land that faints
beneath your tread
And let us see if we are on our heels or on our head.
O molten maiden January! go back from whence
you came,
Your kiss is but a scorching sear, your smile is but
a flame,
You have racked us, you have wrecked us with your
wild and wilful ways,
You have drawn us out, and worn us out through
endless burning days;
We have shuddered at your footstep, we have
fainted at your smile,
And yet, upon my word, I think we’ve loved you
all the while.
You have trampled on our feelings, you have ’most
unhinged our minds
With your extra-ultra-inter-outer scorching,
screeching winds,
You have melted us and stewed us in a limp and
lukewarm rain,
And then dried us, yes, and fried us, nice and hot
and brown again,


We have cursed you for a termagant, we’ve sworn
you are a shrew,
And yet, believe me, January, we have loved you
too.
For you’ve given us feasts of colour when at
evening you undressed
And threw your rose and saffron robes across the
tidy west,
And I’ve seen your diamonds glitter on many a
sultry night,
And I knew the moon was leagued with you, so
glorious was her light,
A.nd the orchards knew your coming, and a luscious
blush was born
Upon a million velvet cheeks to greet you every
morn, ’ ’'"Tl
And you scatter gold about you—for in spite of
all, I ween,
You come of ancient lineage and are every inch a
queen.
So try and prune your passions, and bind this
golden rule
For crown about your regal brow, O January!
Keep cool!
AGNES L. STORRIE.


BANNERMAN OF THE DANDENONG.
I rode through the Bush in the burning noon
Over the hills to my bride, —
The track was rough and the way was long,
And Bannerman of the Dandenong,
He rode along by my side.
A day’s march off my Beautiful dwelt
By the tawny streams in the West; —
Lightly lilting a gay love-song
Rode Bannerman of the Dandenong,
With a blood-red rose on his breast.
“Red, red rose of the Western streams”
Was the song he sang that day—
Truest comrade in hour of need —
Bay Mathinna his peerless steed—
I had my own good grey.
There fell a spark on the upland grass,
The dry Bush leapt into flame; —
And I felt my heart go cold as death,
And Bannerman smiled and caught his breath, —
But I heard him name Her name.
Down the hill-side the fire-floods rushed,
On the roaring eastern wind; —
Neck and neck was the reckless race—
Ever the bay mare kept her pace.
But the grey horse dropped behind.


He turned in the saddle —“Let’s change, I say
And his bridle rein he drew.
He sprang to the ground—“ Look sharp!” he said
With a backward toss of his curly head,
“I ride lighter than you!”
Down and up—it was quickly done —
No words to waste that day!—
Swift as a swallow she sped along,
The good bay mare from Dandenong,
And Bannerman rode the grey.
The hot air scorched like a furnace blast
From the very mouth of Hell:—
The blue gums caught and blazed on high
Like flaming pillars into the sky; . . .
The grey horse staggered and fell.
“Ride, ride, lad, ride for her sake!” he cried; —
Into the gulf of flame
Were swept, in less than a breathing space,
The laughing eyes, and the comely face,
And the lips that named Her name.
She bore me bravely, the good bay mare; —
Stunned, and dizzy and blind,
I heard the sound of a mingling roar—
’Twas the swollen river that rushed before,
And the flames that rolled behind.


Safe—safe, at Nammoora gate,
I fell, and lay like a stone.
O love! thine arms were about me then,
Thy warm tears called me to life again,—
But—O God! that I came alone!
We dwell in peace, my beautiful one
And I, by the streams in the West,
But oft through the mist of my dreams along
Rides Bannerman of the Dandenong,
With the blood-red rose on his breast.
ALICE WERNER.
THE SICK STOCK-RIDER.
Hold hard, Ned! Lift me down once more, and lay
me in the shade.
Old man, you’ve had your work cut out to guide
Both horses, and to hold me in the saddle when I
swayed.
All through the hot, slow, sleepy, silent ride.
The dawn at “Moorabinda” was a mist-rack dull
and dense,
The sun-rise was a sullen, sluggish lamp;
I was dozing in the gateway at Arbuthnot’s bound’ry
fence.
I was dreaming on the limestone cattle camp;


We crossed the creek at Carricksford, and sharply
through the haze,
And suddenly the sun shot flaming forth;
To southward lay “Katawa,” with the sand peaks
all ablaze,
And the flushed fields of Glen Lomond lay to
north.
Now westward winds the bridle-path that leads to
Lindisfarm,
And yonder looms the double-headed Bluff;
From the far side of the first hill, when the skies are
clear and calm,
You can see Sylvester’s woolshed fair enough.
Five miles we used to call it from our homestead to
the place
Where the big tree spans the roadway like an
arch;
’Twas here we ran the dingo down that gave us
such a chase
Eight years ago—or was it nine?—last March
’Twas merry in the glowing morn, among the gleam-
ing grass,
To wander as we’ve wandered many a mile,
And blow the cool tobacco cloud, and watch the
white wreaths pass,
Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.


’Twas merry ’mid the blackwoods, when we spied
the station roofs,
To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,
With a running fire of stock whips, and a fiery run
of hoofs;
Oh! the hardest day was never then too hard!
Ay! we had a glorious gallop after “Starlight” and
his gang,
When they bolted from Sylvester’s on the flat;
How the sun-dried reed-beds crackled, how the
flint-strewn ranges rang,
To the strokes of “Mountaineer” and “Acrobat.”
Hard behind them in the timber, harder still across
the heath,
Close beside them through the tea-tree scrub we
dash’d;
And the golden-tinted fern leaves, how they rustled
underneath;
And the honeysuckle osiers, how they crash’d!
We led the hunt throughout, Ned, on the chestnut
and the grey,
And the troopers were three hundred yards be-
hind,
While we emptied our six-shooters on the bush-
rangers at bay
In the creek with stunted box-trees for a blind?


There you grappled with the leader, man to man,
and horse to horse,
And you roll’d together when the chestnut rear’d;
He blazed away and missed you in that shallow
watercourse —
A narrow shave —his powder singed your beard!
In these hours when life is ebbing, how those days
when life was young
Come back to us; how clearly I recall
Even the yarns Jack Hall invented, and the songs
Jem Roper sung;
And where are now Jem Roper and Jack Hall?
Ay! nearly all our comrades of the old colonial
school,
Our ancient boon companions, Ned, are gone;
Hard livers for the most part, somewhat reckless as
a rule,
It seems that you and I are left alone.
There was Hughes, who got in trouble through that
business with the cards,
It matters little what became of him;
But a steer ripp’d up Macpherson in the Coora-
minta yards,
And Sullivan was drown’d at Sink-or-Swim;


And Mostyn—poor Frank Mostyn—died at last, a
fearful wreck,
In the “horrors” at the Upper Wandinong
And Carisbrooke, the rider, at the Horsefall broke
his neck;
Faith! the wonder was he saved his neck so long!
Ah! those days and nights we squandered at the
Logans’ in the glen—
The Logans, man and wife, have long been dead.
Elsie’s tallest girl seems taller than your little Elsie
then;
And Ethel is a woman grown and wed.
Ive had my share of pastime, and I’ve done my
share of toil,
And life is short—the longest life a span;
I care not now to tarry for the corn or for the oil,
Or for wine that maketh glad the heart of man.
For good undone, and gifts misspent, and resolu-
tions vain,
’Tis somewhat late to trouble. This I know—
I should live the same life over, if I had to live
again;
And the chances are I go where most men go.


The deep blue skies wax dusky, and the tall green
trees grow dim,
The sward beneath me seems to heave and fall;
And sickly, smoky shadows through the sleepy sun-
light swim,
And on the very sun’s face weave their pall.
Let me slumber in the hollow where the wattle blos-
soms wave.
With never stone or rail to fence my bed;
Should the sturdy station children pull the bush-
flowers on my grave,
I may chance to hear them romping overhead.
ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.
WOLF AND HOUND.
“The hills like giants at a hunting lay,
Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay.”
Robert Browning.
You’ll take my tale with a little salt,
But it needs none, nevertheless;
I was foil’d completely, fairly at fault,
Dishearten’d, too, I confess.
At the splitters’ tent I had seen the track
Of horse-hoofs fresh on the sward,
And though Darby Lynch and Donovan Jack
(Who could swear through a ten-inch board)
Solemnly swore he had not been there,
I was just as sure that they lied,
For to Darby all that is foul was fair,
And Jack for his life was tried.


We had run him for seven miles and more
As hard as our nags could split;
At the start they were all too weary and sore
And his was quite fresh and fit.
Young Marsden’s pony had had enough
On the plain, where the chase was hot;
We breasted the swell of the Bittern’s Bluff,
And Mark couldn’t raise a trot;
When the sea, like a splendid silver shield,
To the south-west suddenly lay,
On the brow of the Beetle the chestnut reel’d,
And I bid good-bye to M’Crae—
And I was alone when the mare fell lame,
With a pointed flint in her shoe,
On the stony flats: I had lost the game,
And what was a man to do?
I turned away with no fixed intent
And headed for Hawthorndell;
I could neither eat in the splitters’ tent
Nor drink at the splitters’ well;
I knew that they gloried in my mishap,
And I cursed them between my teeth—
A blood-red sunset through Brayton’s Gap
Flung a lurid fire on the heath.
Could I reach the dell? I had little reck,
And with scarce a choice of my own
I threw the reins on Miladi’s neck
I had freed her foot from the stone.


That season most of the swamps were dry,
And after so hard a burst
In the sultry noon of so hot a sky
She was keen to appease her thirst—
Or by instinct urged or impelled by fate —
I care not to solve these things—
Certain it is that she took me straight
To the Warrigal water springs.
I can shut my eyes and recall the ground
As though it were yesterday —
With a shelf of the low, grey rocks girt round,
The springs in their basin lay;
Woods to the east and wolds to the north
In the sundown sullenly bloom’d;
Dead black on a curtain of crimson cloth
Large peaks to the westward loom’d.
I led Miladi through weed and sedge,
She leisurely drank her fill;
There was something close to the water’s edge,
And my heart with one leap stood still,
For a horse’s shoe and a rider’s boot
Had left clean prints on the clay;
Someone had watered his beast on foot,
’Twas he—he had gone. Which way?
Then the mouth of the cavern faced me fair,
As I turned and fronted the rocks;
So, at last, I had pressed the wolf to his lair,
I had run to his earth the fox.

I thought so. Perhaps he was resting. Perhaps
He was waiting, watching for me.
I examined all my revolver caps,
I hitched my mare to a tree —
I had sworn to have him alive or dead,
And to give him a chance was loth;
He knew his life had been forfeited —
He had even heard of my oath.
In my stocking’d soles to the shelf I crept,
I crawl’d safe into the cave —
All silent —if he was there he slept.
Not there. All dark as the grave.
Through the crack I could hear the leaden hiss!
See the livid face through the flame!
How strange it seems that a man should miss
When his life depends on his aim!
There couldn’t have been a better light
For him, nor a worse for me.
We were coop’d up, caged like beasts for a fight,
And dumb as dumb beasts were we.
Flash! flash! bang! bang! and we blazed away,
And the grey roof reddened and rang;
Flash! flash! and I felt his bullet flay
The tip of my ear. Flash! bang!
Bang! flash! and my pistol arm fell broke;
I struck with my left hand then—
Struck at a corpse through a cloud of smoke—
I had shot him dead in his den!
ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.


ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.
A Memorial Ode.
At rest! Hard by the margin of that sea
Whose sounds are mingled with his noble verse
Now lies the shell that never more will house
The fine strong spirit of my gifted friend.
Yea, he who flashed upon us suddenly,
A shining soul with syllables of fire,
Who sang the first great songs these lands can claim
To be their own; the one who did not seem
To know what royal place awaited him
Within the Temple of the Beautiful,
Has passed away; and we who knew him sit
Aghast in darkness, dumb with that great grief
Whose stature yet we cannot comprehend;
While over yonder churchyard, hearsed with pines,
The night wind sings its immemorial hymn,
And sobs above a newly-covered grave.
The bard, the scholar, and the man who lived
That frank, that open-hearted life which keeps
The splendid fire of English chivalry
From dying out; the one who never wronged
A fellow man; the faithful friend who judged
The many, anxious to be loved of him,
By what he saw, and not by what he heard,
As lesser spirits do; the brave, great soul
That never told a lie, or turned aside
To fly from danger—he, as I say, was one
Of that bright company this sin-stained world
Can ill afford to lose.


They did not know,
The hundreds who had read his sturdy verse
And revelled over ringing major notes,
The mournful meaning of the undersong
Which runs through all he wrote, and often takes
The deep autumnal, half-prophetic tone
Of forest winds in March; nor did they think
That on that healthy-hearted man there lay
The wild specific curse which seems to cling
For ever to the Poet’s twofold life!
To Adam Lindsay Gordon, I who laid
Two years ago on Lionel Michael’s grave
A tender leaf of my regard; yea, I
Who culled a garland from the flowers of song
To place where Harpur sleeps; I, left alone,
The sad disciple of a shining band,
Now gone—to Adam Lindsay Gordon’s name
I dedicate these lines; and if ’tis true
That, past the darkness of the grave, the soul
Becomes omniscient, then the bard may stoop
From his high seat to take the offering
And read it with a sigh for human friends,
In human bonds, and grey with human griefs.
And having wove and proffered this poor wreath
I stand to-day as lone as he who saw
At nightfall, through the glimmering moony mist
The last of Arthur on the wailing mere,
And strained in vain to hear the going voice.
HENRY KENDALL.


HIS GIPPSLAND GIRL.
Now, money was scarce and work was slack
And Love to his heart crept in,
And he rode away on the Northern track
To war with the World and win;
And he vowed by the locket upon his breast
And its treasure, one red-gold curl,
To work with a will in the farthest West
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
The hot wind blows on the dusty plain
And the red sun burns above,
But he sees her face at his side again.
And he strikes each blow for Love:
He toils by the light of one far-off star
For the winning of one white pearl,
And the swinging pick and the driving bar
Strike home for the Gippsland girl.
With aching wrist and a back that’s bent,
With salt sweat blinding his eyes,
’Tis little he’d reck if his life were spent
In winning so grand a prize;
And his shear-blades flash and over his hand
The folds of the white fleece curl,
And all day long he sticks to his stand
For the love of his Gippsland girl.


When the shearing’s done and the sheds cut out
On Barwon and Narran and Bree;
When the shearer mates with the rouseabout
And the Union man with the free;
When the doors of the shanty, open wide,
An uproarious welcome hurl,
He passes by on the other side
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
When the Summer lay brown on the Western Land
He rode once more to the South,
Athirst for the touch of a lily hand
And the kiss of a rosebud mouth;
He sang the songs that shorten the way,
And he envied not king or earl,
And he spared not the spur in his dappled gray
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
At the garden gate when the shadows fell
His hopes in the dusk lay dead;
“Nellie? Oh! Surely you heard that Nell
Is married a month!” they said.
He spoke no word; with a dull, dumb pain
At his heart, and his brain awhirl,
He turned his gray to the North again
For the sake of his Gippsland girl.
H° run9f the board in a Paroo shed
P-v the sweat of his aching brow,
And he blued his cheque, for he grimly said:
“There is nothing to live for now.”


And out and away where the big floods start
And the Darling dust-showers whirl,
There’s a drunken shearer that broke his heart
Over a Gippsland girl!
WILL OGILVIE.
CLANCY OF THE OVERFLOW.
I had written him a letter which I had, for want of
better
Knowledge, sent to where I met him down the
Lachlan, years ago,
He was shearing when I knew him, so I sent the
letter to him,
Just “on spec.” addressed as follows, “Clancy, of
The Overflow.”
And an answer came directed in a writing unex-
pected,
(And I think the same was written with a thumb-
nail dipped in tar)
’Twas his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim
I will quote it:
“Clancy’s gone to Queensland droving, and we
don’t know where he are.”


In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of
Clancy
Gone a-droving '“down the Cooper,” where the
Western drovers go;
As the stock are slowly stringing, Clancy rides be-
hind them singing,
For the drover’s life has pleasures that the towns-
folk never know.
And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their
kindly voices greet him
In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its
bars,
And he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains
extended,
And at night the wondrous glory of the everlasting
stars.
I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy
Ray of sunlight struggles feebly down between
the houses tall,
And the fetid air and gritty of the dusty, dirty city,
Through the open window floating, spreads its
foulness over all.
And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish
rattle
Of the tramways and the ’buses making hurry
down the street,
And the language uninviting of the gutter children
fighting
Comes fitfully and faintly through the ceaseless
tramp of feet.


And the hurrying people daunt me, and their pallid
faces haunt me
As they shoulder one another in their rush and
nervous haste,
With their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted
forms and weedy,
For townsfolk have no time to grow—they have
no time to waste.
And I somehow rather fancy that I’d like to change
with Clancy,
Like to take a turn at droving where the seasons
come and go,
While he faced the round eternal of the cash-book
and the journal—
But I doubt he’d suit the office, Clancy, of “The
Overflow.”
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON.
THE ROARING DAYS.
The night too quickly passes
And we are growing old,
So let us fill our glasses
And toast the Days of Gold;
When finds of wondrous treasure
Set all the South ablaze,
And you and I were faithful mates
All through the roaring days!


Then stately ships came sailing
From every harbour’s mouth,
And sought the land of promise
That beaconed in the South;
Then southward streamed their streamers
And swelled their canvas full
To speed the wildest dreamers
E’er borne in vessel’s hull.
Their shining El Dorado
Beneath the southern skies,
Was day and night for ever
Before their eager eyes.
The brooding bush, awakened,
Was stirred in wild unrest.
And all the year a human stream
Went pouring to the West.
The rough bush roads re-echoed
The bar-room’s noisy din,
When troops of stalwart horsemen
Dismounted at the inn.
And oft the hearty greetings
And hearty clasp of hands
Would tell of sudden meetings
Of friends from other lands;
When, puzzled long, the new-chum
Would recognise at last,
Behind a bronzed and bearded skin,
A comrade of the past.


And when the cheery camp-fire
Explored the bush with gleams,
The camping-grounds were crowded
With caravans of teams;
Then home the jests were
And good old songs were sung,
And choruses were given
The strength of heart and lung.
Oh, they were lion-hearted
Who gave our country birth!
Oh, they were of the stoutest sons
From all the lands on earth!
Oft when the camps were dreaming,
And fires began to pale,
Through rugged ranges gleaming
Would come the Royal Mail.
Behind six foaming horses,
And lit by flashing lamps,
Old “Cobb and Co.’s,” in royal state,
Went dashing past the camps.
Oh, who would paint a goldfield,
And limn the picture right,
As we have often seen it
In early morning’s light?
The yellow mounds of mullock
With spots of red and white,
The scattered quartz that glistened
Like diamonds in light;


The azure line of ridges,
The bush of darkest green,
The little homes of calico
That dotted all the scene.
I hear the fall of timber
From distant flats and fells,
The pealing of the anvils
As clear as little bells,
The rattle of the cradle,
The clack of windlass-boles,
The flutter of the crimson flags
Above the golden holes.
Ah, then our hearts were bolder,
And if Dame Fortune frowned,
Our swags we’d lightly shoulder
And tramp to other ground.
But golden days are vanished,
And altered is the scene;
The diggings are deserted,
The camping grounds are green;
The flaunting flag of progress
Is in the West unfurled,
The mighty bush with iron rails
Is tethered to the world.
HENRY LAWSON.


COLOUR.
The lovely things that I have watched unthinking.
Unknowing, day by day,
That their soft dyes had steeped my soul in colour
That will not pass away:—
Great saffron sunset clouds, and larkspur mountains,
And fenceless miles of plain,
And hillsides golden-green in that unearthly
Clear shining after rain;
And nights of blue and pearl; and long smooth
beaches
Yellow as sunburnt wheat,
Edged with a line of foam that creams and hisses.
Enticing weary feet.
And emeralds, and sunset-hearted opals,
And Asian marble, veined
With scarlet flame, and cool green jade, and moon-
stones
Misty and azure-stained;
And almond trees in bloom, and oleanders,
Or a wide purple sea
Of plain-land, gorgeous with a lovely poison,
The evil Darling pea.


If I am tired I call on these to help me
To dream —and dawn-lit skies,
Lemon and pink, or faintest, coolest lilac,
Float on my soothed eyes.
There is no night so black but you shine through it,
There is no morn so drear,
O Colour of the World, but I can find you,
Most tender, pure and clear.
Thanks be to God, Who gave this gift of colour,
Which who shall seek shall find;
Thanks be to God, Who gives me strength to hold it,
Though I were stricken blind.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
THE WIND’S MESSAGE.
There came a whisper down the Bland between the
dawn and dark,
Above the tossing of the pines, above the river’s
flow;
It stirred the boughs of giant gums and stalwart
ironbark;
It drifted w T here the wild ducks played amid the
swamps below;


It brought a breath of mountain air from off the
hills of pine,
A scent of eucalyptus trees in honey-laden bloom;
And drifting, drifting far away along the southern
It caught from leaf and grass and fern a subtle
strange perfume.
It reached the toiling city folk, but few there were
that heard—
The rattle of their busy life had choked the whis-
per down;
And some but caught a fresh-blown breeze, with
scent of pine that stirred
A thought of blue hills far away beyond the smoky
town;
And others heard the whisper pass, but could not
understand
The magic of the breeze’s breath that set their
hearts aglow,
Nor how the roving wind could bring across the
Overland
A sound of voices silent now and songs of long
ago.
But some that heard the whisper clear were filled
with vague unrest;
The breeze had brought its message home, they
could not fixed abide;
Their fancies wandered all the day towards the blue
hill’s breast,
Towards the sunny slopes that lie along the
riverside.


The mighty rolling western plains are very fair to
see,
Where waving to the passing breeze the silver
myalls stand,
But fairer are the giant hills, all rugged though they
b?,
From which the two great rivers rise that run
along the Bland.
Oh! rocky range and rugged spur and river running
clear,
That swings around the sudden bends with swirl
of snow-white foam,
Though we, your sons, are far away, we sometimes
seem to hear
The message that the breezes bring to call the
wanderers home.
The mountain peaks are white with snow that feeds
a thousand rills,
Along the river banks the maize grows tall on
virgin land,
And we shall live to see once more those sunny
southern hills,
And strike once more the bridle track that leads
along the Bland.
ANDREW BARTON PATERSON.


THE FOREST.
Ye who are dwellers in streets where pain of
existence is sorest.
Come with me, kinsmen of mine, and leave Care in
the City behind—
I am the Brother of Trees, made free of the life of
the Forest,
Innocent, thrilled with the sun and alive with the
songs of the Wind.
Forth from the City I pass, and I laugh at the fetters
that bound me;
O but the forest is green, and my blue-domed world
it is fair,
Delicate bird-life and bee-life piping and humming
around me,
Laughter of light in the leaves and gladness of life
in the air.
Stately they stand in their ranks, my kinsmen, the
high and the noble,
Princes and chieftains in plumes, and a people in
garments of green;
They with their valour of heart, and their courage
that laughs at my trouble,
Knowing the Tree that I was and remembering
what I have been.

Beautiful Lady Acacia, with glimmering laughter
and gladness,
Shaking your head to a tune that is known but to
you and to me;
Dear immemorial music and dearest green days of
sweet madness,
Where you were the Lady Acacia and I was your
Lover the Tree.
Come with me, come with me, kinsmen! and pass
through the wonderful portals:
Deep in the heart of the Forest the mystical story
is told;
Luminous shadows of gods, they are there, and the
pine-crowned immortals,
All of the Heroes and Stories, and all of the legends
of old.
VICTOR J. DALEY.
A RAIN SONG.
There is music in the Mallee,
Lilting music, soft and low,
Like the songs in vale and valley
Where the summer waters flow;
But an anthem of elation
Wedded to a woman’s mouth
Is the message from each station
From the Mitchell River south.


For it’s raining! raining raining!
How the iron roof tops ring!
How the waters, swiftly draining
Through the straining down-pipes, sing
Every drop a golden rhyme is,
Every shower a stanza strong,
And each day of raining time is
Canto sweet of God s great song.
Oh, the earth was dry as tinder,
And her lips were cracked with pain!
From the south to Thargomindah
Like a dead thing she has lain;
But, at last the long drought broken,
She —like Lazarus, the Jew,
When the Christ words had been spoken
She shall leap to life anew.
For it’s raining! raining! raining!
Don’t you hear the merry din?
Don’t you hear the old earth straining
As she sucks the juices in?
And the swelling creeks and rivers—
Hark! their mellow madrigal!
Oh, the sweetest music-givers
Are the autumn rains that fall!
All the air is sweet with voices,
Sweet with human voices now;
And the anvil-tool rejoices
On the ploughshare and the plough;


Yea, above the joyous beating
Of the roof bass you can hear
All the choirs of Nature meeting
In an anthem loud and clear.
For it’s raining! raining! raining!
Over all the thirsty land!
Don’t you hear the old earth straining
As the sapless roots expand?
But her famine days are over,
And her smiles shall soon be seen,
For her old-time Autumn lover
Brings her back her garb of green.
E. S. EMERSON.
THE SOUTHERLY BUSTER.
There's a wind that blows out of the south in the
drought,
And we pray for the touch of his breath
When siroccos come forth from the North-West
and North,
Or in dead calms of fever and death.
With eyes glad and dim we should sing him a hymn,
For depression and death are his foes,
And he gives us new life for the bread-winning
strife—
When the glorious Old Southerly blows.


Old Southerly Buster! your forces you muster
Where seldom a wind bloweth twice,
And your “white-caps” have hint of the snow caps,
and glint of
The far-away barriers of ice.
No wind the wide sea on can sing such a paean
Or do the great work that you do;
Our own wind and only, from seas wild and lonely—
Old Southerly Buster!—To you!
Oh, the city is baked, and its thirst is unslaked,
Though it swallows iced drinks by the score,
And the blurred sky is low, and the air seems aglow
As if breezes would cool it no more;
We are watching, all hands, where the Post Office
stands—
We are watching out hopefully, too—
For a red light shall glower from the Post Office
tower
When the Southerly Buster is due.
The yachts run away at the end of the day
From the breakers commencing to comb,
For a few he may swamp in the health-giving romp
With the friendly Old Southerly home.
But he never drowns one, for the drowning is done
By the fools, or the reckless in sport;
And the alleys and slums shall be cooled when he
comes
With the weary wind-jammers to port.


Oh, softly he plays through the city’s hot ways
To the beds where they’re calling “Come quick!”
He is gentle and mild round the feverish child,
And he cools the hot brow of the sick.
Clearing drought-hazy skies, up the North Coast he
hies
Till the mouths of our rivers are fair,
And along the sea, too, he has good work to do,
For he takes the old timber-tubs there.
’Tis a glorious mission, old Sydney’s Physician!
Broom, bucket and cloth of the East,
Tis a breeze and a sprayer that answers our prayer,
And it’s free to the greatest and least.
The red lamp is warning to drought and its scorn-
ing—
A sign to the city at large—
Hence, Headache and Worry; Despondency, hurry!
Old Southerly Buster’s in charge.
Old Southerly Buster! your forces you muster
Where seldom a wind bloweth twice,
And your white-caps” have hint of the snow caps
and glint of
The far-away barriers of ice.
No wind the wide sea on can sing such a paean
Or do the great work that you do;
Our own wind and only, from seas wild and lonely—
Old Southerly Buster!—To you!
HENRY LAWSON.


IN THE CITY.
I want to be out in the sun on the hills, with a bare
skin baking brown,
For O, I am sick of the dun dull air and the stare
and the glare of the town.
I’d twiddle my toes in the soft short grass and I’d
stare on my back at the sky,
And I’d listen all day to the little tiny birds that
twit! flit! twit! go by.
Why should a man be an ant to build with sand
these shining shows?
I’d rather be where the sun strikes free and the fresh
wind cleanly blows.
For the blue’s so blue and the green’s so green and
the crystal air’s so soft,
And the day leans down like a mother to me, and
the little clouds laugh aloft.
And I know now what I long forgot that there is a
mystery
In the trees and the breeze, and the little tiny birds
and the soft blue skies for me.
And the voice I hear of the earth and the air as a
deaf man hears a bell,
Till I burst with the song “Be merry, be strong; it
is well, it is well, it is well!”
H. M. GREEN.


BURNING OFF.
They’re burning off at the Rampadells;
The tawny flames uprise
With greedy licking around the trees,
The fierce breath sears our eyes.
From cores already grown furnace-hot
The logs are well alight!
We fling more wood where the flameless heart
Is throbbing red and white.
The fire bites deep in that beating heart,
The creamy smoke-wreaths ooze
From cracks and knot-holes along the trunk
To melt in greys and blues.
The young horned moon has gone from the sky,
And night has settled down;
A red glare shows from the Rampadells,
Grim as a burning town.
Full seven fathoms above the rest
A tree stands, great and old,
A red-hot column whence fly the sparks—
One ceaseless shower of gold.


All hail the king of the fire before
The sway and crack and crash
To earth —for surely to-morrow’s sun
Will see him white fine ash.
The king in his robe of falling stars
No trace shall leave behind,
And where he stood with his silent court
The wheat shall bow to the wind.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
BELL-BIRDS.
By channels of coolness the echoes are calling,
And down the dim gorges I hear the creek falling;
It lives in the mountain, where moss and the sedges
Touch with their beauty the banks and the ledges;
Through breaks of the cedar and sycamore bowers
Struggles the light that is love to the flowers.
And softer than slumber, and sweeter than singing,
The notes of the bell-birds are running and ringing.
The silver-voiced bell-birds, the darlings of day-time,
They sing in September their songs of the May-time.
When shadows wax strong, and the thunder-bolts
hurtle,
They hide with their fear in the leaves of the myrtle;


When rain and the sunbeams shine mingled
together,
They start up like fairies that follow fair weather,
And straightway the hues of their feathers unfolden
Are the green and the purple, the blue and the
golden.
October, the maiden of bright yellow tresses,
Loiters for love in these cool wildernesses;
Loiters knee-deep in the grasses to listen,
Where dripping rocks gleam and the leafy pools
glisten.
Then is the time when the water-moons splendid
Break with their gold, and are scattered or blended
Over the creeks, till the woodlands have warning
Of songs of the bell-bird and wings of the morning.
Welcome as waters unkissed by the summers
Are the voices of bell-birds to thirsty far-comers.
When fiery December sets foot on the forest,
And the need of the wayfarer presses the sorest,
Pent in the ridges for ever and ever,
The bell-birds direct him to spring and to river,
With ring and with ripple, like runnels whose tor-
rents
Are toned by the pebbles and leaves in the currents.
Often I sit, looking back to a childhood
Mixt with the sights and the sounds of the wildwood.
Longing for power and the sweetness to fashion
Lyrics with beats like the heart-beats of passion—


Songs interwoven of lights and of laughters
Borrowed from bell-birds in far forest rafters;
So I might keep in the city and alleys
The beauty and strength of the deep mountain
valleys,
Charming to slumber the pain of my losses
With glimpses of creeks and a vision of mosses.
HENRY KENDALL.
FAIRYLAND.
Do you remember that careless band,
Riding o’er meadow and wet sea-sand,
One autumn day, in a mist of sunshine,
Joyously seeking for fairyland?
The wind in the tree-tops was scarcely heard,
The streamlet repeated its one silver word,
And far away, o’er the depths of woodland,
Floated the bell of the parson-bird.
Pale hoar-frost glittered in shady slips,
Where ferns were dipping their finger-tips,
From mossy branches a faint perfume
Breathed o’er honeyed Clematis lips.
At last we climbed to the ridge on high—
Ah, crystal vision! Dreamland nigh!
Far, far below us, the wide Pacific
Slumbered in azure from sky to sky.


And cloud and shadow across the deep
Wavered, or paused in enchanted sleep,
And eastward the purple-misted islets
Fretted the wave with terrace and steep.
We looked on the tranquil, glassy bay,
On headlands sheeted in dazzling spray,
And the whitening ribs of a wreck forlorn
That for twenty years had wasted away.
All was so calm, and pure and fair,
It seemed the hour of worship there,
Silent, as where the great North Minster
Rises for ever, a visible prayer.
Then we turned from the murmurous forest-land
And rode over shingle and silver sand,
For so fair was the earth in the golden autumn
That we sought no farther for Fairyland.
ANNE GLENNY WILSON
THE MOUNTAIN MAIL.
The stars were white and the night was still
When the weary engine drew
The midnight mail to the foot of the hill;
We heard when her whistle blew.
And we took the giant of all the roads,
The mightiest engine out,
To carry along the living loads
Where the hills lay dark with doubt.


There was never a light in the little town,
And a soft, screened glow from the cars,
When we backed the Lord of the Ranges down
In the light of the watching stars.
Soft as the breath of a summer’s breeze
The hooks and chains were drawn;
In the silent cars behind, at ease,
The sleepers slumbered on.
There was scarce a cry from her whistle’s chime—
Just a muffled sound in her stack —
And the grades drew near that we had to climb,
And the railway yard slipped back.
Out and away swept the mountain mail,
White steam flung to the stars,
And eight strong drivers biting the rail
To the rumbling roll of the cars;
For ninety miles through the mountain ways
Her road lay, dark as doom,
Save the narrow track that her headlights’ rays
Cut out from the midnight gloom.
The thrash of the steam and the rail-joints’ “purr”
Were the only sounds we heard;
Back in the cars, did a sleeper stir,
Or a dreamer speak a word?
The driver watching, all eyes and nerves,
Threw open her throttle more,
And through the tunnels and round the curves
Her wheels began to roar.


The fireman, flinging his fire-door wide,
Tossed coal and coal and coal,
And the god of speed who dwells inside
Made the Lord of the Ranges roll.
On viaducts, with a six-foot tread.
We flew o’er the black ravine
With never a light to twinkle red
Or show us a kindly green.
Rocking and rolling, she took the curve,
Her flanges cut the steel;
If a sleeper woke at the reel and swerve
He drowsed ere his brain could feel.
The driver spoke to his fireman thus,
“Look out by the Haunted Wood,
They’re showing a red light there for us
If the filling is not too good.”
But the stars were white and the night was still
When the Lord of the Ranges swept,
At the head of her carriages, down the hill
Where the mountain torrents leapt.
We came to the straight by the Haunted Wood,
And never a light was there;
So the driver knew the embankment stood,
And he shut off all the air.
From a hundred wheels the brakes, released.
Gave speed down the gloomy glen;
If the dreams of a restless sleeper ceased
He slept the sounder then.


Over the hills sped the mountain mail
With flaring white-flung breath,
And the flange of a wheel on a curving rail
Between sweet Life and Death.
Then, in the pink of the gentle Dawn
The Lord of the Ranges paused;
There came the clatter of chains undrawn,
As of chariot-gear unhorsed.
A big-wheeled flier was coupled on
To whirl the train to the sea;
A whistle called, and she was gone,
And the winds of the plains blew free;
And the Lord of the Ranges backed away
To the semi-dark of the sheds—
She does not work in the light of day,
She hauls the folks in their beds,
When the thrash of her steam and the rail-joints
purr
Are the only noises heard.
Back in the cars, did a sleeper stir,
Or a dreamer speak a word?
WILL LAWSON.
SONG OF THE TORRES STRAITS ISLANDS
Bold Torres, the sailor, came and went,
With his swarthy, storm-worn band.
He saw Saavedra’s Isle to north—
To south a loom of land.


He left, unknowing his name would live
Through ages big with Fate,
As the first to stem with his broad-bowed ship
The wash of the Northern Strait.
Round the western coast the Dutch ships crept,
Seeking the hidden way;
Some left their bones on that bare, west coast.
And the others sailed away.
Turned back, turned back, by reef and shoal,
Twin guards of the narrow gate —
The path of the sun from the eastern seas—
They were mocked by the Northern Strait.
Year in, year out, the monsoons swept
O’er the isles off the coral shore.
The savage tossed in his frail canoe,
But the white man came no more.
No sail in sight at the flush of dawn!
No sail at the gloaming late!
Silent and still was the lonely pass—
Unsought was the Northern Strait.
A rattle of arms and a roll of drums,
And the meteor flag flies free,
As an English voice proclaims King George
Lord of that tropic sea.
The parrots scream as the volleys flash,
The gulls their haunts vacate;
And the “south-east” fills the Endeavour's sails
As she heads through the Northern Strait.


And ever since then has our watch been kept
O'er the ships in the narrow way,
Where the smoking funnels flare by night,
And the house-flags flaunt by day.
Ever the same strong south-east blows,
And ever we watch and wait,
The wardens we, in Australia’s name,
The guard of the Northern Strait.
ERNEST FAVENC
THE AURORA AUSTRALIS.
A radiance in the midnight sky
No white moon gave, nor yellow star;
We thought its red glow mounted high
Where fire and forest fought afar.
Half-questioning if the township blazed,
Perchance, beyond the boundary hill;
Then, finding what it was, we gazed
And wondered till we shivered chill.
And fancy showed the sister-glow
Of our Aurora, sending lines
Of lustre forth to tint the snow
That lodges in Norwegian pines.
And south and north alternate swept
In vision past us, to and fro;
While stealthy winds of midnight crept
About us, whispering fast and low.

The north, whose star burns steadily,
High set in heaven long ago:
The south—new-risen on the sea—
A tremulous horizon-glow.
We mused, “Shall there be gallant guests
Within our Polar hermitage,
As on the shore where Franklin rests,
And others, named in Glory’s page?”
And, “Shall the light we look on blaze
Above such battles as have been,
In other countries—other days—
The giants and the gods between?”
Till one declared, “We live to-night
In what shall be the poet’s world;
The lands ’neath our Aurora’s light
Are as the rocks the Titans hurled.
“From southern watfers, ice-enthralled,
Year after year the rays that glance
Shall see the desert shrink appalled
Before the city’s swift advance.
“Shall see the precipice'a stair,
The river as a road. And then
There shall be voices to declare
‘This work was wrought by manly men.’ ”


And so our south all stately swept
In vision past us, to and fro;
While stealthy winds of midnight crept
About us, whispering fast and low.
MARY HANNAY FOOTT.
THE HEADS OF PORT JACKSON.
Lo! yonder looms the land! High o’er the deep
Its barrier-rocks stretch their embattled line,
Marshalling their front against the resistless sweep
Of the big ocean wave! Australia, thine
Are adamantine walls; along thy steep
And rugged cliffs rages the ocean-brine,
While ever and anon the foaming spray
Rises heavenward and clouds the face of day.
High on the bold South Head thy Pharos stands,
Shedding its gladsome ray across the sea,
When the cold south wind whistles, and all hands
Are weary of their voyage. How sweet to me
Its midnight beam! In Afric’s desert sands
The traveller finds a friend in each green tree:
So doth the sailor from far-off lands returning,
When ’mid the gloom he sees thy beacon burning.
JOHN DUNMORE LANG.


CUDGEWA CREEK.
Lone stream of the mountains, by margins of moss,
By falls where the grey rocks thy white waters toss,
The fays of the hills from their slumbers in awe
Awake to thy music, O wild Cudgewa!
Thy home is the home of the wild and the free,
The song of the king-parrot soundeth for thee,
What time, to replenish his life-blood, he flings
On the winds all the strength of his tropical wings.
Thy waters are wooing the many-toned rills,
Sweet sisters that sing in the bracken-clad hills
Till with many a curve, and with many a turn,
They laugh on thy breast through the fronds of the
fern.
Beloved of thy waters, the giant gums form
A bridge where came down all the wrath of the
storm;
In its arches the lizard has fashioned a cell,
And the grey Father Time his decayed citadel.
O, stream of the mountains, the darkness that rolled
O’er thy waves, in the shadowy seasons of old,
Is passing like leaves which thy swift eddies draw
Down deep to thy bosom, O wild Cudgewa.


No more, as of old, where thy glad waters stray,
Shall the children of darkness arise for the fray;
No more shall the boomerang, nullah and spear
Ensanguine thee, river, low laughing and clear.
Soon, soon by thy banks of wild beauty a world
Of progress shall walk with its banners unfurled;
Soon, soon to the rush and the roar of the wheel,
Unbeaked of the parrot, thy waters shall steal.
O, mountain-bred streamlet, though dawnings of
change
Break swift where thy laughter rings out on the
range,
Yet year after year will one fond lover draw
The veil from thy beauty, O wild Cudgewa.
JOHN BERNARD O’HARA.
THE FORTY-MILE BUSH.
Far through the forest’s aromatic glade
We rode one afternoon of golden ease.
The long road ran through sunshine and through
shade,
Lulled by the somnolent stories of the trees.
Sometimes a bell-bird fluted far away;
Sometimes the murmur of the leafy deep,
Rising and falling through the autumnal day,
Sang louder on the hills, then sank to sleep.


Before us stretched the pine-trees’ sombre miles
Soft lay the moss, like furs upon the floor.
Behind, the woodland’s green monotonous aisles,
Closed far away by sunset’s amber door,
League after league the same. The sky grew red
And through the trees appeared a snowy gleam
Of lonely peak and spectral mountain-head,
And gulfs that nurse the glacier and the stream.
Deep in the glen, the merry waters racing
Sent forth their turbulent voices to the night.
The stars above began their solemn pacing,
And home-like shone the distant village light.
Mysterious forest! In this humming city
I seem to hear thy music-breathing tree,
Thy branches wave and beckon me in pity
To seek again thy hospitality!
ANNE GLENNY WILSON.
A BALLADE OF HOME.
Let others prate of Greece and Rome,
And towns where they may never be,
The muse should wander nearer home.
My country is enough for me;
Her wooded hills that watch the sea.
Her inland miles of springing corn,
At Macedon or Barrakee—
I love the land where I was born.


On Juliet smile the autumn stars
And windswept plains by Winchelsea,
In summer on their sandy bars
Her rivers loiter languidly.
Where singing waters fall and flee
The gullied ranges dip to Lome
With musk and gum and myrtle tree —
I love the land where I was born.
The wild things in her tangles move
As blithe as fauns in Sicily,
Where Melbourne rises roof by roof
The tall ships serve her at the quay,
And hers the yoke of liberty
On stalwart shoulders lightly worn,
Where thought and speech and prayer are free—
I love the land where I was born.
Princes and lords of high degree,
Smile, and we fling you scorn for scorn,
In hope and faith and memory—
I love the land where I was born.
ENID DERHAM.


LAUDABUNT ALII.
There are some that long for a limpid lake by a blue
Italian shore,
Or a palm-grove out where the rollers break and the
coral beaches roar;
There are some for the land of the Japanee, and the
tea-girls’ twinkling feet;
And some for the isles of the summer sea, afloat in
the dancing heat;
And others are exiles all their days, midst black or
white or brown,
Who yearn for the clashing of crowded ways, and
the lights of London town.
But always I would wish to be where the seasons
gently fall
On the Further Isle of the Outer Sea, the last little
isle of all.
A fair green land of hill and plain, of rivers and
water-spiings,
Where the sun still follows after the rain, and ever
the hours have wings,
With its bosomed valleys where men may find
retreat from the rough world’s way . . .
Where the sea-wind kisses the mountain-wind be-
tween the dark and the day.


The combers swing from the China Sea to the Cali-
fornia Coast,
The North takes toll and fee of the best of
the Old World’s boast,
And the waves run high with the tearing crash that
the Cape-bound steamers fear—
But they’re not so free as the waves that lash the
rocks by the Sumner Pier,
And wheresoever my body be, my heart remembers
still
The purple shadows upon the sea, low down from
Sumner Hill.
The warm winds blow through Kuring-gai; the cool
winds from the south
Drive little clouds across the sky by Sydney Har-
bour mouth;
But Sydney Heads feel no such breeze as comes
from nor’-west rain
And takes the pines and the blue-gum trees by hill
and gorge and plain,
And whistles down from Porter’s Pass, over the
fields of wheat,
And brings a breath of tussock grass into a Christ-
church street.
Or the East wind dropping its sea-born rain, or the
South wind wild and loud
Comes up and over the waiting plain, with a banner
of driving cloud;


And if dark clouds bend to the teeming earth, and
the hills are dimmed with rain,
There is only to wait for a new day’s birth and the
hills stand out again.
For no less sure than the rising sun, and no less
glad to see
Is the lifting sky when the rain is done and the wet
grass rustles free.
Some day we may drop the Farewell Light, and lose
the winds of home—
But where shall we win to a land so bright, however
far we roam?
We shall long for the fields of Maoriland, to pass as
we used to pass
Knee-deep in the seeding tussock, and the long lush
English-grass.
And we may travel a weary way ere we come to a
sight as grand
As the lingering flush of the sun’s last ray on the
peaks of Maoriland.
ERNEST CURRIE
ORARA.
The strong sob of the chafing stream
That seaward fights its way
Down crags of glitter, dells of gleam,
Is in the hills to-day.


But, far and faint, a grey-winged form
Hangs where the wild lights wane—
The phantom of a bygone storm,
A ghost of wind and rain.
The soft white feet of afternoon
Are on the shining meads,
The breeze is as a pleasant tune
Amongst the happy reeds.
The fierce, disastrous, flying fire,
That made the great caves ring,
And scarred the slope, and broke the spire.
Is a forgotten thing.
The air is full of mellow sounds,
The wet hill-heads are bright,
And down the fall of fragrant grounds
The deep ways flame with light.
A rose-red space of stream I see,
Past banks of tender fern;
A radiant brook, unknown to me
Beyond its upper turn.
The singing silver life I hear,
Whose home is in the green
Far-folded woods of fountains clear,
Where I have never been.


Ah, brook above the upper bend,
I often long to stand
Where you in soft, cool shades descend
From the untrodden land!
Ah, folded woods, that hide the grace
Of moss and torrents strong,
I often wish to know the face
Of that which sings your song!
But I may linger long, and look
Till night is over all:
My eyes will never see the brook
Or sweet, strange waterfall.
The world is round me with its heat
And toil, and cares that tire;
I cannot with my feeble feet
Climb after my desire.
HENRY KENDALL.
HY-BRASIL.
“Daughter,” said the ancient father, pausing by the
evening sea,
“Turn thy face towards the sunset-turn thy face
and kneel with me!
Prayer and praise and holy fasting, lips of love and
life of light,
These and these have made thee perfect—shining
saint with seraph’s sight!


Look towards that flaming crescent —look beyond
that glowing space—
Tell me, sister of the angels, what is beaming in thy
face?”
And the daughter, who had fasted, who had spent
her days in prayer,
Till the glory of the Saviour touched her head and
rested there.
Turned her eyes towards the sea-line —saw beyond
the fiery crest,
Floating over waves of jasper, far Hy-Brasil in the
West.
All the calmness and the colour—all the splendour
and repose,
Flowing where the sunset flowered, like a silver-
hearted rose!
There indeed was singing Eden, where the great
gold river runs
Past the porch and gates of crystal, ringed by
strong and shining ones!
There indeed was God’s own garden, sailing down
the sapphire sea—
Lawny dells and slopes of summer, dazzling stream
and radiant tree!
Out against the hushed horizon, out beneath the
reverent day,
Flamed the Wonder on the waters—flamed, and
flashed, and passed away.
And the maiden who had seen it felt a hand within
her own,


And an angel that we know not led her to the lands
unknown.
Never since hath eye beheld it—never since hath
mortal, dazed
By its strange, unearthly splendour, on the floating
Eden gazed!
Only once since Eve went weeping through a throng
of glittering wings,
Hath the holy seen Hy-Brasil where the great gold
river sings!
Only once by quiet waters, under still, resplendent
skies,
Did the sister of the seraphs kneel in sight of
Paradise!
She, the pure, the perfect woman, sanctified by
patient prayer,
Had the eyes of saints of Heaven, all their glory in
her hair:
Therefore God the Father whispered to a radiant
spirit near—
“Show Our daughter fair Hy-Brasil—show her this,
and lead her here.”
But beyond the halls of sunset, but within the
wondrous West,
On the rose-red seas of evening, sails the Garden of
the Blest.
Still the gates of glassy beauty, still the walls of
glowing light
Shine on waves that no man knows of, out of sound
and out of sight.


Yet the slopes and lawns of lustre, yet the dells of
sparkling streams
Dip to tranquil shores of jasper, where the watching
angel beams.
But, behold! our eyes are human, and our way is
paved with pain,
We can never find Hy-Brasil, never see its hills
again!
Never look on bays of crystal, never bend the
reverent knee
In the sight of Eden floating—floating on the sap-
phire sea!
HENRY KENDALL.
VESTIGIA NULLA RETRORSUM.
Oh, have you tried to track their feet,
Who march for marching’s sake,
With steps that echo to the beat
Of hearts which else would break?
The dust of home was shaken from
Their sandals long ago;
The lights of home were taken from
The only road they know —
But dust of home or dust of Rome or dust of
Bethlehem,
My soul salutes the soldier-souls that march in step
with them.
Oh, have you met the haunted clans
By whom all trails are tried;


Who leave the fireside’s ordered plans
To new-made groom and bride;
Who, whether dusk fall drearily
Or tempest drowns the dawn,
Keep step, God knows how wearily,
But none the less keep on,
Until they prove that milestones move, that stable
hills change place,
But never that the feet of man his memories
outpace?
And have you heard the music rise
(A tuneless tune and grim)
Of those who march till twilight dies
Unhelped by any hymn?
The veil of dusk is merging them
Into a rabble throng,
But evermore is urging them
A snatch of rebel song
That plays the thief with unbelief, and filches, from
the past
The watchword of their bravest day to pit them for
their last.
Thus comrades see the head flung high
Of one about to fall,
As some remembered melody
Thrills out its trumpet-call;
The faith still undeceived in him,
Responsive, leaps to hear
Her whisper, who believed in him,
“Keep step, my chevalier!”


A broken word, a broken sword, a man at naught
may set,
But not the kiss that knighted him shall any man
forget.
They know, who march abreast of him,
The weariness of things,
The aching foot, the trembling limb,
“Yet, lo!” they say, “he sings”!
However near the tourney is,
How imminent the fight,
Because of her, his journey is
The venture of a knight,
If he recall at evenfall how once she breathed a
prayer,
Divining that the heart she touched would find, its
echo there.
For such as he are they that bear
The burden of the day,
And such as these the thoughts they share
To lift them on their way;
And though no man delays for them,
And they delay for none,
The hope that someone prays for them
Is all that helps them on,
Till, dust of home or dust of Rome or dust of
Bethlehem,
Their erstwhile path shall be their pall—and this
their requiem.
GUY INNES.


THE RIVERS OF DAMASCUS.
“Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus
better than all the waters of Israel?”
Round the dry plain the brown hills rise,
Midmost the plain the city lies,
Ancient Damascus, sovran there,
Encamped in leagues of gardens fair,
The cincture green that round her clung,
Old when the pride of Tyre was young,
Girdle of verdure deep and wide,
Where ever-living waters glide,
Where feeding full all things that grow,
The rivers of Damascus flow.
In flight beneath the Syrian sun
To sheltering aisles of shade they run,
Stealing within to lose the sky
In long cool halls of greenery,
To whisper soft as windless rain,
To flash and ’scape the eye again.
They sparkle here, they ripple there,
Unseen they murmur everywhere,
And dimpling, coiling, laughing low,
The rivers of Damascus flow.
By many a cypress dark and high
Sweet rills meander leisurely;
Asunder cleft, apart they wind,
Bright tangled silver disentwined;


Here blinds and burns the sunlight’s sheen.
There linger pools in twilight green,
Or gushing forth to sudden light,
Encompass citron orchards white,
Where, feeding full all things that grow,
The rivers of Damascus flow.
Without, the sun’s unpitying thrust
Strikes on the yellow desert dust,
The cricket’s note whirrs hard and shrill,
The red rocks glow that gird the hill.
Not yet the sun hath sunk upon
The battlements of Lebanon.
Within are musing rest and dreams
In sight of waters, sound of streams.
Where blossoming pomegranates blow,
And rivers of Damascus flow.
The desert riders fainting scan
The weary West—’tis Ramazan;
Their horses’ hoofs mid stillness ring
As some hot stone aside they fling;
But here the pleasant waters creep,
Their freight indifference and sleep,
Singing of cities, ruined, gone,
Great Baalbec and Babylon.
Old is their song the leaves below,
Where rivers of Damascus flow.


Hushed is the courtyard, dead the street,
The high walls gleam in dazzling heat,
Only a murmur floats afar
Around the fragrant, strange bazaar.
And flickering lights through palm-leaves fly
O’er shrouded Moslem pacing by,
And slumbrous fountains bubble on,
And drowsy hours slip one by one,
And Sleep’s dusk pinions waver slow,
And rivers of Damascus flow.
The shadow of grey centuries
Over the still, white city lies;
Far, visionary ages brood
In grave, enfolding quietude;
The listless, wise, impassive East
Smiles like some old world-weary priest,
Smiles at ambition, effort, strife,
And all our petty, fever’d life,
A haunting smile on face bent low,
Where rivers of Damascus flow.
WILLIAM PEMBER REEVES.
THE RED-TRESSED MAIDEN.
Red she is in a robe of sable,
Rosy with pictures and tales to tell;
She is a fairy, and yet no fable,
Weaving the dreams that we love so well.


Out in the dark where the night-winds hurry
And dead leaves carpet the silent bush,
She hath a charm for the mind a-worry,
For the worn white face a fresh young blush.
Tell her a story of some love laid in
The grave long since with a maiden white,
She will not taunt you, the Red-tressed Maiden
Dressed in her mantle of starless night.
With fingers potent as rich wine chosen
From dusty cellars where years lie dead,
She melts the ice in the veins long frozen,
And the blood runs chainless, the heart grows red.
Her ears have hearkened the joyous laughter,
Man-made, maid-lifted, through years and years
To frescoed dome and to smoky rafter,
And tears and tears and ceaseless tears.
Old as the world, and some say older,
Is she; and yet she is young and sweet.
She heard the story the Cave-Man told her,
When hearts were bolder and ruder their beat.
No tale so trifling but she will listen;
The long day ended, the day’s toil done;
Then wheresoever her great eyes glisten
An ancient battle is fought and won.


She is ready to hearken to some chance roamer,
With a lyre on his shoulder, a lilt on his tongue,
As she was of old to the blind-eyed Homer
Who sang high strains when the world was
young.
On winter nights when the roads are cheerless,
And west winds under a frosty moon,
She paints us Summer in colours peerless,
And the broad gold charm of a tropic noon.
On summer evenings in sylvan places,
(The picnic over and stars in the skies)
She heightens the blush on sun-kissed faces,
And deepens the dream in dear young eyes.
And who is the Maiden? When Night is about you,
Pile high the dry leaves and the dead wood.
and so
Make a light for the darkness within and without
you , . .
And now do you see her—and now do you know?
RODERIC QUINN.


YE WEARIE WAYFARER.
Hark! the bells on distant cattle
V/aft across the range
Through the golden-tufted wattle
Music low and strange;
Like the marriage peal of fairies
Comes the tinkling sound,
Or like chimes of sweet St. Mary’s
On far English ground.
How my courser champs the snaffle,
And, with nostril spread,
Snorts, and scarcely seems to ruffle
Fern leaves with his tread;
Cool and pleasant on his haunches
Blows the evening breeze,
Through the overhanging branches
Of the wattle trees;
Onward to the Southern Ocean
Glides the breath of Spring,
Onward, with a dreamy motion,
I, too, glide and sing—
Forward! forward! still we wander —
Tinted hills that lie
In the red horizon yonder—
Is the goal so nigh?
Whisper, spring-wind, softly singing,
Whisper in my ear;
Respite and nepenthe bringing,
Can the goal be near?


Laden with the dew of vespers
From the fragrant sky,
In my ear the wind that whispers
Seems to make reply—
“Question not, but live and labour
Till yon goal be won,
Helping every feeble neighbour,
Seeking help from none;
Life is mostly froth and bubble
Two things stand like stone:
Kindness in another’s trouble,
Courage in your own,”
ADAM LINDSAY GORDON.
THE ANCHOR.
Firm trust of the bold sailor on the shores of sudden
storm,
What strength is in its structure and the fitness
of its form!
Old ocean’s bedrock gripping, with the hurricane’s
tug ’twill cope,
And therefore ’tis the emblem held of man’s eternal
hope.
Through the billows ceaseless raging, by the bleak
and stormy steep,
Like a thunderbolt down-rushing it is shot into the
deep;


Down where some mute sea-monster its hideous
bulk uprears,
And mightiest Silence drowned hath lain for many
a thousand years.
In some famed bay of battle when ’tis plunged with
sullen roar,
In the Nile, in Navarino, or by Danish Elsinore,
How deep there shall its slumbers be beneath the
sounding waves,
Amid the bones of gallant tars in glory’s watery
graves.
In the bright and land-locked harbour, the weary
voyage o’er,
When only pleasant breezes breathe sweet welcome
from the shore.
Its massive form down-dropping to its quiet bed
below
Gives signal to the first glad boat that beachward
pants to go.
In the calm thou firm-fixed surety, thou strong
helper in the storm,
Even a child, when first beholding all the fitness of
thy form,
Might well divine the dangers wherewithal ’tis thine
to cope,
And take thee as the emblem meet of man’s eternal
hope.
CHARLES HARPUR.


THE TIMBER SCOW.
No zephyr, born of summer’s gale,
Waits at the harbour-mouth for me,
To leap into the rustling sail,
And heap the white waves on the trail,
To set the pennons fluttering free,
And reef-points pattering like hail,
A-driving o’er a sparkling sea.
I glide so slow, so low on steady keel,
I scarce can feel
The frolic-airs that round the tall sails steal.
The white-winged yachts race by, a-heel,
The decks a-drip with dashing spray;
With dipping bows and slanting keel,
And sails that strain and swell to feel
The boisterous ocean-breezes play;
And slender, quivering masts, that reel
Against a sky of steel and grey.
Broad-bosomed, leaning on the floods I go,
Unshaken, slow;
Nor heed the shocks of froward waves at ebb
flow.
But storm is in yon looming cloud;
The gaunt sails groan and flap and fill,
The sullen swells, a-shoulder, crowd


And break upon the lee, and loud
The shattering thunder roars, and shrill
The whistling wind in rope and shroud,
And night and storm must work their will.
But driving on before a roaring wind,
A course I find;
Knowing the hand that guides, the storm can loose
or bind.
I bear no treasure-trove of gold,
Nor freight of precious merchandise,
Of Eastern treasures, rare and old,
Deep-hidden in the dusky hold,
To wake in languid beauty’s eyes
A sparkle covetous and cold,
And in the breast half-uttered sighs.
I have not moved amid green tropic isles,
Where Summer smiles.
And blue seas flash and flame forever, miles on miles.
lonely beach and bar I go;
By dock and pier, and sea-walled town;
By rock and headland, moving slow,
Though waters ebb or waters flow:
Beneath the shadow of the frown
Of iron cliffs, where seethe below
White breakers, raging up and down;
And wait at river-mouths where, foaming free,
The waters flee,
And like fond lovers, seek the bosom of the sea.


For me the bushmen’s axes ring,
And forest-aisles come crashing down;
To me the brawling waters bring
The stripped, unsightly, sodden thing
That lately reared a woody crown;
Among the forest kings a king,
Now stark and fallen, scarred and brown;
That waved and whispered to the wooing breeze
That swept the trees,
Like the deep murmur of a thousand thousand bees.
The dams are burst; the floods are free,
And roaring streams come down amain,
By tens and scores, by two, by three,
The drifting logs ride to the sea,
And dip and dive and rise again
A-shoulder, plunging heavily
In waters swoll’n by autumn rain,
And roll and range, by shingle and by sand,
And pebbly strand,
To leap the foaming falls by rainbow arches spanned.
Low and laden, I turn and creep,
By bank and shallow and sandy shore.
Where drowsy waves on the shingle sleep,
And mists of the river roll and sweep
O er the flats, and the marshes’ reedy floor,
To the bar where breakers laugh and leap,
And the open sea lies leagues before.


But the musk o’ the woods I bear with me,
And the salt o’ the sea,
And the rough smell of bark that clings to the fallen
tree - MAUD PEACOCKE.
THE OLD NGAHAURANGA* ROAD.
Now, let the leaders ease their load—
Their foaming flanks are white—
For on the old Ngahauranga Road
The brakes will hiss and bite,
As down the easy grade a-swing
The big coach hums along.
Come, throw aside all care, and sing
A rousing coaching song.
The slackened trace-chains jangle clear,
The swingle-bars join in,
And from each piece of honest gear
There rings a merry din.
The heavy brakes have gripped the load,
The tyres are gleaming bright,
And down the old Ngahauranga Road
The world goes well to-night.
Above the Gorge’s rugged walls
Shine star and star and star,
And, rich and pure, sweet music falls —
“Under the Deodar.”
It mingles with the whirr of wheels,
Is lost and found again;
And every man among us feels
*Near Wellington, N.Z., pronounced, “Now-rang-ah.”


It’s good to be free men,
To feel the leaping pulses beat
A-swaying round a curve,
While eyes glow soft and lips are sweet,
And nerves are solid “nerve.”
Who cares if his small row is hoed?
Who cares if cake be dough,
When down the old Ngahauranga Road
We let the big bays go?
Now double-bank the heavy brakes,
To slow her round this bluff;
A bridge’s planking throbs and shakes,
The driver’s voice sounds gruff,
As steadily, his leaders’ chests
Skirting the outer rail,
He swings them—so!—with reefing crests.
And gives them rein to sail
With every strong hoof beating hard
Along a level “straight,”
Where every yard is just a yard,
And no horse feels the weight.
Brave eyes flash bright in Love’s own code,
That only lovers know,
When down the old Ngahauranga Road
He lets his big bays go.
The leader s stride is lengthening,
The wheelers follow suit;
The driver sways in-board to swing
The brake-bar from his boot.


Ahead of us there gleams the sea—
The grades are easy now,
The wheels cry out in ecstasy,
And spin, and race, and plough;
The tall trees tell us, whispering low,
How, with hot brakes a-scream,
Cobb’s coaches raced here long ago,
Before the days of steam —
Five Yankee lamps like jewels glowed,
And five staunch horses tore
Along the old Ngahauranga Road
In those brave days of yore.
The big bays’ hoofs are ringing clear —
They’re pulling all they know;
Old Dan can just hang on and steer,
And let the beggars go.
No fretting thong is on their hides,
No rough hand on the rein;
They’ll pull and pull, with foaming sides,
And pull and pull again.
Song mingles with the roll of wheels,
Ascending to the stars,
The high coach pitches, sways, and reels,
With clashing swingle-bars,
Who cares for debts unpaid, and owed—
If wool be high or low?
We’re on the old Ngahauranga Road.
Ho! Let the beauties go!
WILL LAWSON


THE GAME OF HOODMAN BLIND.
For them no blatant brasses swell,
Their deeds no sculpture show;
Their stirring stories none can tell,
Their names no singers know—
The men who fought the wars, and fell,
And never struck a blow.
ihree tiers of oars, with steady stroke,
They swept through Salamis;
They shortened sail through cannon’s croak
And biting bullet’s hiss;
Black, blistered, blind, to-day they stoke
Through battle as it is.
They shared the pride of Grecian days,
The laurels Caesar wore,
The brilliance of the Viking frays,
The boast of British lore—
Who paved the widest water-ways,
And battled with the oar.
With strengthened backs and bended knees—
Fierce force in every form—
They learned to flout the Arctic breeze,
The sand-blast whirling warm;
To slip and slip through silky seas,
And drag her through the storm.


They heard the stamping overhead,
The shrieks of those who fell;
They felt the bumping of the dead
Upon the rhythmic swell;
But worked in silence till she sped
Along the water well.
Though decks had slimy grown with gore,
And frenzied blows fell wide,
Though gleaming beaks through timber tore
And bleeding blades were plied,
They swung their oar and pulled their oar
And cleared their oar —and died.
They manned the yards in Nelson’s fleet
To furl the flapping sail;
They scorned the shell-burst ’neath their feet,
The spinning chain-shot’s wail;
Their thoughts to make the reef-points meet
And fight throughout the gale.
They looked not on the tops ablaze
With volleys from the foe;
They stirred not from their task to gaze
Where blood began to flow;
Nor paused when, through the smoky haze,
Their comrades dropped below.


To-day, in grime and grease, they bide,
Bereft of sound and sight;
The flush of victory them denied,
The tremor of the flight,
Until the green sea bursts the side
To whelm them in its might.
They know not how the battles go,
Within their steel recess;
Their post and power they may not know,
Their fate they may not guess;
Their duty but to wait below
And bear the battle’s stress.
No pomp or panoply have they,
No cheering crowds they find;
But, fixed as targets through the fray,
Their ordered work they mind.
Salute the hearts unseen to play
The game of Hoodman Blind!
MONTAGUE GROVER.


WITH THE IMMORTALS.
Life is not futile, short and vain to those
Who love and labour, hear the trumpet-call
Of duty, and go forth to fight with all
The brood of hate and ignorance—worst foes
Of man on earth. Although their days should close
Ere prime be reached, ungrudgingly they fall,
With sense of rounded life, that ne’er was thrall
To Vice, or Sloth, or real or fancied woes.
No life of high activities is brief.
True hero-souls, strong-willed, alert, elate,
Live years in days; they laugh at Time, the thief;
They rule Desire and Circumstance and Fate;
And Death but calls them, as a glad relief,
To nobler labours in a higher state.
J. LIDDELL KELLY.
SUNSET.
The weary wind is slumbering on the wing:
Leaping from out meek twilight’s purpling blue
Burns the proud star of eve as though it knew
Itself the big king jewel quivering
On the black turban of advancing night.
In the dim west the soldiers of the sun
Strike all their royal colours one by one,
Reluctantly surrender every height.
ARTHUR BAYLDON.


RAINBOW END.
Parting of mist that shows the morning star
Whitening amid the chill fire of the blue;
Long lucerne soaked in amethystine dew
Windily tremulous ’neath one crimson bar;
A call of magpies skimming o’er the grass,
Bright necks of cattle drinking from the stream,
Dew-lustrous horses jetting breath of steam,
Faint shouts and whipcracks as the slow teams pass.
A sudden rainbow shakes a noiseless spray;
The dying mist has given its soul and breathed
Fine flame whose molten colours quiver and blend.
It swings and settles on a stack of hay
Whose bright enchanted masses, fiery-sheathed,
Show magic gold beneath the rainbow-end.
LESLIE H. ALLEN.
THE LITTLE WORLDS.
Ah, Mother dear! broad-bosomed Mother Earth!
Mother of all our Joy, Grief, Madness, Mirth! —
Mother of flower and fruit, of stream and sea! —
We are thy children and must cling to thee.
I lay my head upon thy breast and hear—
Small, small and faint, yet strangely sweet and
clear —


The hum and clash of little worlds below,
Each on its own path moving, swift or slow.
And listening, ever with intenter ear,
Through din of wars invisible I hear
A Homer —genius is not gauged by mass—
Singing his Iliad on a blade of grass.
And nations hearken; his great song resounds
Unto the tussock’s very utmost bounds.
States rise and fall, each blade of grass upon,
But still his song from blade to blade rolls on
Through all the tussock-world, and Helen still
Is Fairest Fair, and Ajax wild of will—
An Ajax whose huge size, when measured o’er,
Is full ten-thousandth of an inch or more—
Still hurls defiance at the gods whose home
Is in the distant, awful, dew-drop dome
That trembling hangs, suspended from a spray,
An inch above him—worlds of space away.
Old prophecies foretell —but Time proves all—
The day will come when it, like Troy, shall fall.
Lo! through this small great wondrous song there
runs
The marching melody of stars and suns.
VICTOR J. DALEY.


CRAS NOBIS.
The day is dawning, the ocean calls us,
Too long we linger upon the shore;
But not together we face the morrow,
O friends, farewell now for evermore!
Alma Mater, O kindest mother !
Light is breaking, rve must arvay;
Though one go one lvay, and one another,
We'll think °f ee ot the close of day.
And eyes we know not shall watch the compass,
And hands we know not shall set the sail;
But thou hast taught us, and thou has wrought us,
And hearts of thine shall not lightly fail.
Alma Mater, etc.
And some go skirting the Happy Islands,
And some lie sleeping at quiet quays,
And some are running before the tempest,
And some are whelmed in the lonely seas.
Alma Mater, etc.
Then here’s a smile for the gay companions,
And here’s a hand for the kind and true,
When we have ended the Great Adventure,
Before the nightfall, we’ll think of you.
Alma Maler, etc.

The Academy: “These ballads (for such they mostly are)
abound in spirit and manhood, in the colour and smell of Aus-
tralian soil. They deserve the popularity which they have won
in Australia, and which, we trust, this edition will now give
them in England.”

The Spectator: “A good deal of humour, a great deal
of spirit, and a robust philosophy are the main characteristics
of these Australian poets. Because they write of a world
they know, and of feelings they have themselves shared in,
they are far nearer the heart of poetry than the most accom-
plished devotees of a literary tradition.”

idiomatic. He can tell a yarn with the best.”

The Athenaeum: “This is a long way the best
work Mr. Lawson has yet given us. These stories are so good
that (from the literary point of view of course) one hopes
they are not autobiographical. As autobiography they would
be good, as pure fiction they are more of an attainment.”

Daily Chronicle: “No one has so truly interpreted the
Indian mind —no one, transcribing Indian thought into our
literature, has retained so high and serious a level, and quite
apart from the rarity of themes and setting —the verses remain
—true poems.”
STARS OF THE DESERT.
Outlook : “It is not merely that these verses describe
Oriental scenes and describe them with vividness, there is a
feeling in the rhythm —a timbre of the words that seems akin
to the sand and palm-trees and the changeless East.”
INDIAN LOVE.
Spectator: “The poetry of Laurence Hope must hold a
unique place in modern letters. No woman has written lines
so full of a strange primeval savagery—a haunting music—
the living force of poetry.”

Sydney Morning Herald: “Mr. Allen is one of the select
band who are saturated with classic lore and who seek to
translate the beings of pagan mythology to the Australian

“Gem of the Flat” is a story of Australian bush children.
The local colouring is distinctly good; the children are alive,

described. The style is fresh, the dialogue well managed, and

tone about it.

Sydney Morning Herald: “ ‘Dot and the Kangaroo’ is with-
out doubt one of the most charming books that could be put
into the hands of a child. It is admirably illustrated by Frank
P. Mahony, who seems to have entered thoroughly into the
animal world of Australia. The story is altogether Australian.
. . . It is told so simply, and yet so artistically, that even
the ‘grown-ups’ amongst us must enjoy it.”

chased at enhanced prices. The author has at last consented

Extract from Preface; “The aim of this book has always
been, not only to provide wholesome and economical recipes
for capable housewives, but to help those who have not had

significant that many discerning women have made a habit
of giving a copy of the ‘Presbyterian Cookery Book’ to every
new bride of their acquaintance.”

Teachers (No. 13). 2d. each.
The letters are continuously joined to each other, so that the
pupil need not lift the pen from the beginning to the end
of each word. The spaces between the letters are wide, each
letter thus standing out boldly and distinctly by itself. The
slope is gentle, but sufficient to prevent the pupil from ac-
quiring a back hand. The curves are well rounded, checking
the tendency to too great angularity.
