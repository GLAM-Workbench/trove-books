SESTIONS AND IDEAS PREPARED FOR
?S VISIT TO PER f
NOVEMBER. 194 :
SOCIETY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Ac INTRODUCTORY.
After careful study of the documents "outline
of Special Information Required" and "General Questions
Connected with Australian Post-War Housing - (Urban and
Rural)", it is realized that an immense field of re-
search is being covered by the Commission. In order
for the Modern Architectural Research Society of W. A.
to be of maximum assistance to the Commission, much
longer time in which to prepare this Report would be
necessary. The Society therefore offers its continued
assistance, in the future, in any direction the Com-
mission might indicate with regard to -
(a) Collection of Data;
(b) Amplification of points raised in this
report;
(c) Research into any matters designated by
the Commission,
The Society considers that planning of Hous-
ing is part of a wider field of planning, and cannot
be isolated from all other activities of the country,
and, therefore, proposes to outline as briefly as pos-
sible its views on Planning generally and on Housing
in particular. An attempt was made to deal with the
items of the documents referred to above, one by one,
but since they proved to be inter-related, and to
overlap to a certain extent, it is now considered that
the procedure adopted herein will be more concise and
give a better view of our ideas generally. Although
it is regretted that time does not enable us to deal
specifically with all the items listed, we would wel-
come an opportunity to do so at a later date.

EXISTING LIVING ENVIRONMENT!
UNPLANNED.
The Society believes that the lives led by
most people today are restricted, unimaginative and un-
balanced because of inadequacies of environment, and
inefficient housing. Many people adjust their ways of
living to the shortcomings of the houses they live in.
This is due to the following facts -
(a) The majority of houses are built with-
out the services of Architects.
(b) No proper provision is made for cultur-
al and social activities in the usual
residential districts.
(c) The persistence in the idea that small
individual blocks of land laid out
along streets provide the most suit-
able way of living.
THE SUBURBS.
The living environment of our present towns
is in sprawled out, monotonous and mostly ugly suburbs
in which unity is impossible because of the unrelated,
individual nature of each dwelling, designed for quick
sale by speculators. Whether in rectangular or irreg-
ular patterns, streets, which should be only traffic
arteries, do not provide the best background on which
to provide good housing. Adherence to street align-
ments means that if a house is well placed on one side
of the street, the houses cn the other side cannot be
so well placed with regard to orientation for sunlight,
prevailing winds, views etc. Frequently the widths of
blocks prevent correct orientation and veiy often pos-
sible views are spoiled by bad subdivisions.
As the outer suburbs grow streets become un-
duly lengthened. They become tedious and unpleasant.
Parks and gardens merely increase the distances and
increase the rates and taxes, for citizens who already
have individual gardens to maintain, and consequently
little leisure time to enjoy and develop the Municipal
gardens.
Fences, pavements, street lighting and drain-
age, services such as gas, electricity, water, sewer-
age become extended over uneconomic lengths and add to
the burden of cost of the ratepayer. In the same way
delivery of food stuffs, milk, etc. and of other dom-
estic requirements and including mails, and the dis-
posal of refuse,, become extra charges which the commun-
ity pays in the end. Mechanical collection of refuse
cannot" be economically introduced, and dustbins are


left in back yards attracting flies, rats, vermin.
Most back yards are too big for the average householder
and besides being untidy, if not actually unhygienic,
in their total area make the whole district too big for
the community so that it lacks cohesion, and character.
Personal pride in their private gardens, indulged by
thousands of suburban dwellers, does not constitute
civic pride but tends against it, at the same time ac-
centuating class differences which destroy social har-
mony.
The spread of the suburbs introduces grave
difficulties in the siting of Kindergartens - where
such exist - and schools, shopping areas, cinemas etc.
so that large numbers of people using these must travel
considerable distances to reach then. Small children
become exposed to danger every time they must cross a
street. As suburban streets become lengthened and mul-
tiplied the urban portions of towns become hemmed in
and what were once quite efficient horse-and-cart
roads are called upon to do work never intended for
them. We are unable to avail ourselves of the oppor-
tunities offered by the motor car for comfort and speed
but instead, in the traffic congestion which results
from the limitless spread of the town we lose patience
and time, and must daily learn of fatal traffic acci-
dents, especially to children. Not only in the casu-
alty wards of public hospitals but in extra police,
traffic light signals and many other unnecessary ex-
travagances we pay for our lack of planning.
The countryside recedes as the suburbs push
out and engulf it, and long, aesthetically barren,
ribbon developments, lined with poster boardings, ugly
service stations and jerry-built houses, necessitate
tedious car journeys before the countryside proper can
be reached. These journeys are considerably slowed up
by street and level crossings and by pedestrians for
whom no provision is made to cross the roads in safety.
In the environment of today houses are built
on a background of streets. Parks and playing fields
are applied to a background of buildings. In his first
report to the Greater London Regional Planning Commit-
tee in 1929 Sir Raymond Unwin said -
"It is of importance that the problem should
be approached from the point of view of plan-
ning ample, though selected, tracts for
building developer 4 : on a background of open
lands."


It frequently happens that all the best re-
sidential areas are occupied by commercial or factory
buildings, so that many natural beauties and pleasures
are lost to the people, while at week ends and holidays
the deserted business houses occupying such sites to
the exclusion of people are given maximum prominence
by blatant advertisements.
HOUSES.
Apart from the slums, and near slums which
are much more prevalent than is conceded by author-
ities, the majority of suburban houses are inadequate
in the following particulars.
They lack privacy, which is not achieved by
dividing fences, when the windows of one house open
directly onto the windows of the house next door, and
when verandahs of opposite or adjoining houses over-
look one another. Six feet, more or less, between the
external walls of adjoining houses, with or without a
fence, does not give privacy but merely cuts out sun-
light and possible views and creates a prison environ-
ment.
They entail constant drudgery for women in
housework, washing, care of children, cooking and other
domestic duties which leave little time for cultural or
social activity or for the development of the personal-
ity, or latent talents, or hobbies of the housewife.
Their internal spaces are boxes with holes
for doors and windows, and having no relationship with
the processes of living a happy life. Inappropriate
furniture is fitted into these boxes after they are
built.
Bed rooms have proved so inefficient that a
tradition of sleepouts has developed, and the unneces-
sarily large bed rooms are used as dressing rooms only
entailing a disproportionate amount of housework and
waste of space, carpeting, lighting, and money. Very
often members of families have no other privacy than a
sleepout shared with others.
Sleepouts and verandahs, especially if en-
closed in any way, keep too much winter sunlight out
of the interiors of houses, and in the summer serve
no real purpose unless situated on western walls. The
northern summer sun is so high in the heavens that
small projecting hoods can entirely exclude it at this
season without preventing its penetration in winter,
when its orbit is lower in the sky. Furthermore, ver-
andahs are usually placed in such positions that they


are seldom, if ever, used for recreation purposes, being
mostly on public, street elevations. They often degen-
erate into canvas-blind-enclosed sleeping spaces in
crowded houses, boarding houses etc. Back verandahs
become receptacles for rubbish.
Dining rooms, where provided, are usually too
large in view of the fact that the rooms are used, at
the most, three times a day, and in the majority of
cases for the evening meal only - the others being taken
in the kitchen - or at week ends, or for entertaining
visitors.
Living rooms are fixed and rigid and cannot
be adapted to a variety of changing purposes without
refurnishing. Very often the living room is reserved
for the use of rare visitors and makes no real contri-
bution to happy family life.
Nearly all kitchens are inefficient in plan-
ning and equipment. Many of them are without sinks,
and even in areas where gas and electricity are avail-
able, have wood fire stoves. Most of them lack copious
hot water and refrigeration - two essential kitchen re-
quisites.
Many bath rooms lack provision for a constant
hot water supply and hot showers. Some lack lavatory
basins.
W.C. * s are usually placed inconveniently in
back yards, difficult to reach in wet weather and often
exposed to the view of neighbours. Where placed inside,
or on back verandahs, flushing cisterns are unnecessar-
ily noisy. The potential comfort of sanitation is com-
pletely overlooked.
Houses do not usually provide sufficient
storage space for personal, indispensable rubbish of a
home, for travelling bags and odds and ends. They do
not provide for sewing machine space, work benches,
hobbies, studies? for periods of romping and noise as
well as periods of quiet and repose* Light fixtures
are usually pendant from the centre of the ceilings
without regard to the activities of the rooms. It is
seldom that provision is made for reading lamps or for
the control of bed room lights from the bed, or for
reading in bed. It is not usually possible to have a
radio and an electric radiator working together in the
same room.


Generally speaking no provision is made for
warming a house in winter 'nor for keeping it cool in
summer. Fly proofing is seldom efficient - if it is
used at all.
Ceiling heights of more than 9*o" do not en-
able pleasant internal proportions of rooms and prevent
pleasing exterior designs,. Although Perth requires
10*6" ceiling heights this Society does not know of any
scientific reasons for the dimension, (See later notes)
Construction of houses, unless carried out to
Architects' or Government specifications, is usually by
rule of thumb and obsolete methods, in which all pos-
sible monetary savings are made in the purchase of mat-
erials, consistent with building by-laws, v This is not
cheap or economical either in initial costs or mainten-
ance, The second quality materials are usually con-
cealed, from the front only, by a veneer of fancy
bricks, cement rendering or paint which does not usual-
ly even return round the sides of the building, but
stops sharp at the extreme edges of the front elevation
as seen on a drawing.
Aesthetically the suburban scene is chaotic,
even where occasional houses have been designed by Ar-
chitects. The average house is designed -if the word
may be used - to be seen from the front only (as on a
drawing board) and since no building can be seen from'
this aspect the perspective view of thousands of unre-
lated units is depressing. Generally the fronts are
fussy with mock styles, gables, hips, porches, columns
and bay windows.
On the financial side there are not only
wasteful practices and expensive waste of space and
land in the suburbs of today, there is also the enor-
mous annual maintenance bill which must be met to pre-
vent whole neighbourhoods deteriorating. Frequently
whole neighbourhoods do deteriorate, and it requires
only one or two industries to become established in
them for people who are able to do so to move away.
Rents drop. Poorer classes ftove in. Owners, in order
to keep up their incomes, take more tenants than for-
merly and crowding begins. As metropolitan activities
spread outwards from the city land values rise in the
deteriorated closer suburbs. Owners hold their pro-
perty in anticipation of further rise in prices.
Dwellings, fit only for demolition, are not worth re-
pairing in the meantime, and so they remain for years
as slums or near slums in districts never likely to
become residential again, and awaiting the problemat-
ical growth of the commercial part of the city before
they are pulled down. Long after they have ceased to
serve human needs such structures continue on the scene


in all our Australian cities, and in Perth, may be seen
within one mile of the G.P.O. to the North, East and
West, not only along the tram and bus routes, but in
innumerable side streets as well. In the publicity
which is given the better class suburbs and newly de-
veloping districts, such as Floreat Park, the closer
decayed areas are apt to be forgotten although they
house the bulk of the population with low incomes.
Along the tram routes minor industries and cheap,
squalid shops appear to be established for many more
years to come, relieved only by an occasional new Hotel
or Cinema. These areas must be traversed before one
can enter or leave the City of Perth* They are widely
extended, and therefore expensive to the community, in
the contribution they make to the general spread of
the services and land of the region. They are expen-
sive to the community in the diseases they breed and in
the costs of maintaining police, fire brigades, health
inspectors etc., and, in the long run, they are expen-
sive because of the drunkenness and anti-social spirit
they generate.
The individual who buys or builds his own
home is often faced with the prospect of paying instal-
ments, in the form of rent, over a long term, say 30
years, and at the end of that time he is lucky if he is
free of mortgages. In a sense many "home owners" never
really own their homes, but are tied to them for life,
however unsuitable they become as needs change with the
growth and decline of families. Under normal circum-
stances of speculative building the value of the home
declines rapidly after the paint has worn thin, and
when new "ideas" have found favour in the newer suburbs,
so that the investment is a bad one, not only restrict-
ing the owner?s life but involving him in constant ex-
pense and worry over repairs and other recurring
charges.
Primarily speculative houses are built for
sale and profit - not for use, but architects so far,
appear to have taken no steps to protect the house pur-
chaser from his own ignorance and from skilful "own
your own home" advertisements. Those who buy or build
mostly do so only once in a lifetime, so that initial
mistakes ..become irrevocable. Speculative methods in-
volve financial risks, which are kept as low as pos-
sible by investors, who work on the principles of mini-
mum qualities and methods of construction, and maxi-
mum returns covering the risks involved. Under such
conditions it is not possible to give maximum amenities,
beautiful surroundings and adequate social life to
dwellers in our towns.


DEFINITIONS OF FLAMING.
In view of the conditions described in the
preceding section it is necessary, in the opinion of
this Society, to institute planning measures for the
post-war period without delay.
We consider that the aim of Planning must be
the betterment, of the ways of living of all people, and
in working to chat aim human needs must take precedence
over industrial and comm social requirements and the
community welfare over the private interests of indivi-
duals.
We consider that the development of the physi-
cal environment in which we live and work must not be
restricted by -
(a) Predilections and prejudices of author-
ities;
(b) By the interests of any one class;
(c) By existing out-of-date Building and
Town Planning By-Laws?
(d) By the influence of opponents of reform.
We consider that only planning, following ex-
tensive research, can determine location of housing
projects, decentralization of industries, population
densities, building densities, pattern of roads etc.,
and the sociological requirements directly related to
housing.
We quote the "Architectural Forum 1 * November
reporting on the findings of the Uthwatt Commit-
tee.
"The Uthwatt recommendations are based on two
assumptions;
1. That National Planning 'will be directed
to ensuring that the best use is made of
land with a view to securing economic ef-
ficiency for the community and well-being
for the individual, and that it will be
recognized that this involves the subor-
dination to the public good of the per-
sonal interests and wishes of landowners.
Unreserved acceptance of this conception
is vital to a successful reconstruction
policy. *
2. That there will be a system of national


planning 'with a high degree of initiation
and control by the Central Planning Auth-
ority, which will have national as well as
local considerations in mind, will base
its actions on organized research into the
social and economic aspects of the use and
development of land, and will have the
backing of national financial resources
where necessary for a proper execution of
its policy * e
With these sentiments the Society is in ac-
The Society considers that there are two kind#
of Planning.
(i) Bureaucratic Planning. This is Planning
carried out by authorities behind closed
doors* However well meaning individuals
may be, it is possible that they misin-
terpret public wishes and underestimate
needs* It is also possible that auth-
orities are not always imaginative and
tend to be restricted in outlook by over-
familiarity with existing by-laws and
practices. It is the opinion of this
Society that all things change, and can
be changed, and that this flexibility
is missing from bureaucratic planning.
Planning of this nature imposes solu-
tions of problems on the public, with
or without public support. It assumes
the correctness of the solutions with
amazing assurance which precludes the
possibility of experimental development.
(ii) Organic Planning. This is based on the
actual processes of life and directed to
the fulfillment of human needs as a gov-
erning objective. It allows for experi-
ment as a major feature, and is flexible
enough to allow for changes of means,
following experiment, which occur during
the process of implementation of a plan,
and to allow for changes of the Plan
its.-If, following changes of needs. Or-
ganic planning is carried out with the
utmost publicity, as a means of stimu-
lating that public enthusiasm without
which no plan can be expected to succeed.
Organic planning contains machinery
whereby the wishes of all sections of
the population can be expressed and
whereby public opinion can be accurately


gauged and taken into consideration.
Organic planning is in two sections of which
the greater includes the lesser., involving the tine
elements-
(a) Short term planning is capable of being
carried out within a stated period dur-
ing which needs are rot likely to change.
fco ary large extent - say 5 years - and
winch : o ir.Un-ded to cope with the most
i res sing noqn ements of the population
* in such matters ao housing, electrifi-
cation of rural communities, transport,
education.
(b) Long rerm planning. This is a continu-
ous process which also includes the
short term plans. There can be no ques-
tion of a long term plan ever being com-
pleted, but only if a general direction
towards which all activities are lead.
This involves the conception of a Nation-
al Master Plan as the unified expression
of the current and anticipated needs of
the people of the nation, categorically
stated in such a manner that every ac-
tivity of the nation can be consciously
directed towards the satisfaction of
those needs. A National Master Plan pre-
cludes the possibility of speculative
enterprises and makes all activities
the outcome of social need.
A Master plan includes the establishment of
the necessary regulations and authorities with full
powers by which it can be implemented and the tentative
solution of economic problems which stand in the way of
its implementation. Final solutions of such problems,
and other problems, can only follow experiment involv-
ing the organisation of people and of industry
The huge problem of preparing a Master plan
for long term execution is capable of solution by the
distribution of tasks over appropriate sections of the
population and the integration of their findings and
requirements into co-ordinated interim plans for pub-
lication, in book form, by planning authorities. After
a stated period the interim?plans, suitably amended as
required by public opinion. to become the planning pol-
icy of the Nation. State plans are modelled upon this,
and regional plans upon the State plans. The suggested
organisation by which long term organic planning could
be undertak: i is shown in tabulated form in Appendix
"B". This machinery could also be utilized for the' im-
plementation of planning and would be permanent.


It is suggested that objectionable bureau-
cratic tendencies could be obviated if original appoint-
ments to positions in the Planning Agencies listed in
Appendix "B" were for a period of say 3 years, at the
end of which time all appointments would be reviewed.
During the 3 yearperiod a method could be devised
whereby the elective principle could be introduced to
have the appointments confirmed for a further period,
or changes made if the public has no confidence in its
planning leaders. Reviews of appointments to be made
periodically.
Organic Planning involves the division of the
large states into suitable areas for simplification of
the administrative aspects of planning, which might or
might not coincide with existing political divisions,
and the further division into regions with boundaries
clearly defined by such considerations as climate, topo-
graphy, geology, agricultural and industrial activities,
social organisation, distribution of towns and cities,
and so forth. _ A region is the smallest unit of Town
planning and includes the rural area which supports a
town or city and the town or city which gives a focus
to the area. The two are inseparable and must be ? ?
planned as a unit.


D. THE STEPS NECEj
AND IMPLEMENT PLANS.
The Process of Organic
.be,,.dealt with, under f<
headings.
1. SURVEY,
An exhaustive survey is necessary which must
embrace every aspect of nature and every aspect of hu-
man affairs. It must determine all existing and poten-
tial resources of the country so far as they can be as-
certained at the time. It must collect all data and
statistics possible concerning Health, Education, Rec-
reation, Housing, Transport (aviation, railways, roads,
shipping), Agriculture, Industry, Climate, Geology,
Water Supply and irrigation, sources of possible elec-
tric power, soil erosion, etc= Also it must determine
population densities, distribution of religions, of vo-
cations, and of social groups and clubs, and all other
aspects of social and historical relationships.
This is a task for Peace in which the whole
nation must be asked to help , as it has been asked to
help for the purposes of war. It should be made the
occasion for education of the population in the needs
for, and possibilities of planning. The National Plan-
ning Agency (Depfc. of Planning) by propaganda, films,
publications showing the achievements of other countries
etc. must give inspiration to all men, women and child-
ren so that their full support will be assured when im-
plementation commences.
The collection of data can be facilitated by
the Planning organisations already suggested, especially
by the Regional Planning Agencies and the Committees.
They will require to bo given clear instructions as to
the type of information required.
Other possible steps towards collection of
data are as followss-
(a) Distribution of questionnaires to
(i) all citizens;
(ii) all Associations;
(iii) Regional Planning Agencies;
(iv) Industrial concerns;
(v) Insurance Companies, etc.
(b) Invitations to all sections of the popu-
lation to form local Planning Committees,
to collect and forward data to the Re-
gional Planning Agencies.
(c) Instructions to all Government Depart-
ments (Federal and State) to supply, in-
formation from their certain knowledge.


(d) Resumption of Geodetic Aerial Survey un-
dertaken in N.W O Australia in 1955*
(e) Aerial surveys including photography from
low and high altitudes of all major towns
and special areas.
(f) The appointment of Special Committees of
experts in different fields of human ac-
tivity.
In each instance the questionnaire, requests
and instructions must be so worded that no ambiguity as
to required information exists, and in such a way that
the information collected will have direct bearing on
planning problems.
It is contended that the machinery already
used in collecting information for National Service and
Manpower purposes in war time can be used even more ef-
fectively in peace. During this period needs can be
clarified and expressed.
[G OF SURVEY.
This process can be carried on simultaneously
with the survey. The Divisional Planning Agencies,
with the assistance of statisticians, writers, cartog-
raphers, sociologists, etc. must co-ordinate the in-
formation and data collected and express it in readily
comprehensible forms such ass-
(i) Statistical tables?
(ii) Charts?
(iii) Graphs showing past developments, trends
etc.;
(iv) Maps built up from Military Surveys and
showing all information capable of being
shown on maps and particularly -
(a) housing,densities (rural and urban)?
(b) population - densities?
(c) income levels?
(d) communications and transport routes
in detail;
(e) geological formations?
(f) industrial and agricultural data?
(g) water supply?
(h) etc.


Appendix ?0? attached to this report is an
Atlas compiled by Dr. J? Gentili of this state. The
maps shown are inadequate for planning purposes but the
principle is suggested for adoption in the recording of
planning surveys.
'The classification of factsy the recognition
of their sequence and relative significance .
is the function of Science, and the habit of
forming a judgment upon these facts unbiased
by personal feeling Is characteristic of what
may be termed the scientific frame of mind.?
(K. Pearson, "The Grammar of Science?.)
The scientific method of approach to the dif-
ficulties of this phase, as to other phases of planning,
can overcome all obstacles standing in the way of its
fulfillment.
Jl. PLANNING.
MIT.
Following a period of research and co-ordin-
ation of data this Society visualizes the preparation
of large scale planning projects for short term realiz-
ation, as previously described, to meet the most press-
ing public needs. The solutions found at this time
should be regarded as experimental, and the projects
themselves, and their successes or failures, should be
given the widest publicity. Simultaneously with the
implementation of these plans the long term reshaping
of our whole environment must be on the Drawing Boards
and in the hands of the Planning Agencies listed in
.Appendix M B n .
In both the long and short term plans stress
must always be. laid on the aim of satisfying human
needs rather than conforming to any existing, outmoded
conceptions of living merely because the basis upon
which to work is already there, however inadequate.
Proposals to continue construction along lines already
laid down because that appears to present the most log-
ical economic solution, cannot be considered valid on
that ground alone. Human life must come before econom-
ics and human needs must determine the shape of our
environment of the future.
Since it is not possible to submit actual
plans without having all the knowledge which only a
nation wide survey could collect, this Society can only
suggest some of the methods by which our environment
can be raised to new levels of adequacy and beauty.
The Society believes that the conditions


briefly described in Section B of this report can be
changed by planning, and with the fullest public co-
operation and enthusiasm, if carried through by the
machinery already described. The Society is unable to
agree with critics who call such ideas utopian. The
suburban utopias of the past no longer serve the needs
of advancing civilization. The alternatives suggested
here are rational, practical - and necessary. The pro-
PQ-gal-t.Q.. progress by experimental stages with public
opinion constantly consulted both in the region immed-
iately concerned with any project and throughout the
country, ensures success. It is therefore, the inten-
tion in this section of the report to deal briefly with
a few factors of planning and make suggestions for pre-
liminary experimental work.
RS&XQNSa
The Society considers that efficiency and
beauty cannot be achieved by isolated, individual build-
ing enterprises, that a building, or house, is part of a
neighbourhood, the neighbourhood a part of the town and
the town a part of a region. It considers that every
region must provide the fullest opportunities for each
individual to develop to the fullest possible stature,
both physically and mentally, and to lead full, happy
lives.
We visualize regions having clearly marked
boundaries (e.g. greenbelts but not streets) in which
the character of the region can develop and in which
all inhabitants can comprehend' its development and ac-
tivities.
TOWNS.
We visualize towns having clearly marked boun-
daries offering contrast with the surrounding country-
side for the mutual benefit and stimulation town and
country dwellers can experience in changing over from
one to the other respectively. This means that the sub-
urbs must be pulled in and tidied up (see Appendix "A")
and ribbon development must stop.
Towns should be limited in population so that
citizens can comprehend and take part in, civic matters,
and limited in area for -
(a) economy of transport, time and services;
(b) to enable city dwellers to visit the
country frequently and easily.
We consider that all towns in Australia with
populations over 250,000 should be limited to their


present sizes. and, if found desirable after a survey,
reduced by transfer of, portions of the population, with
relevant industries, to new satellite town sites of not
more than 50,000 people.
All Australian Towns should be limited to
their present areas and, if found desirable after a
survey ,^should be reduced to reasonable dimensions by
demolition of the decayed, near slum areas already des-
cribed, and consequent clearing of large tracts of
ground on which to build new housing estates to replace
the outer suburbs. Towns - except in the very biggest,
where such may be permitted to remain - should not be
more than about 2 or 5 miles across.
ZONES,
Within the Towns themselves zones must be es-
tablished for the following main activities -
(i) Housing (a) Recreation;
(b) Education;
(c) Health Services.
(ii) Work
(a) Industrial;
(b) Commercial and Administra-
tive.
These must be related to one another, as nearly as pos-
sible in the following manners-
Housing must have the best sites with regard
to levels, views, orientation. Kindergartens and Nur-
sery schools must be so arranged that no child need
cross a traffic road nor walk more than 400 yards to
get there. Schools must be spaced within walking dis-
tance of all children and be not more than \ mile from
the most distant child. Facilities for adult education,
recreation and health services should be not more than
\ mile from the most distant resident. They are not
likely to be utilized to the fullest if distances are
greater.
Work Zones must be removed from Residential
Zones by a journey of not more than 20 minutes includ-
ing time spent in bus, tram or car. The time at pres-
ent lost in travelling to and from work, and in waiting
for transport, is time lost out of life which can never
be regained.
SMOKE .
Industrial Works must be sited so that obnox-
ious processes do not interfere with the comfort of the
residential zones. Legislation should ensure improved


methods of combustion so that the smoke nuisance is min-
imized. , Location with regard to prevailing winds is
desirable to a certain extent. It is limited in its
efficacy, since winds do not always blow from the same
point of the compass. Prevailing winds may carry smoke
away most of the time, but if an occasional evening
breeze, say, blows in the opposite direction a housing
estate can be made unpleasant. Greater stress should
be placed on mechanical methods of abatement.
ROADS.
Communications within Housing Zones should be
by means of light, narrow lanes lined with trees, and
Curved to suit plan requirements, to carry private cars
Mid the light vehicles of domestic tradesmen. This,must
be elow^ moving traffic. Faster traffic can be prevented
from using the lanes as short cats by their shape on
plan. Pedestrian traffic must be catered for by foot-
paths and shady Walks, which are quite independent of
the car lanes, and which need not, of necessity, follow
the same routes. These walks must be designed for in-
terest and beauty, and require frequent garden seats,
sun and rain shelters, drinking fountains and ornament-
al fountains and pools.
Connection between residential and work zones
should be by means of traffic arteries designed to carry
heavy loads with provisions for pedestrian crossings by
subways or other means. Some of these roads must extend
into the country and to other regions but nothing further
need be said in this connection for the purposes of this
report.
DECENTRALIZATION.
Where the requirements of Planning necessit-
ate the removal of industries from their present sites
a system of planned decentralization into satellite
toms is considered desirable. Unplanned decentralis-
ation is very much opposed. It would cause disruption
in towns and cities, and further disturbance of the
lives of the workers without necessarily giving them
any additional advantages, and it would soon spoil en-
tirely what is left near our towns of the original bush*
Legislation should prevent decentralization unless it
is properly controlled and co-ordinated with a general
plan of development*
HOUSING.
The Housing itself we visualize as being built
on a background of park, with lanes and walks placed as
required. Orientation of buildings to suit conditions
and needs, takes the place of orientation to suit street
alignments and real estate subdivisions.


Hard and fast rules are impossible, since con-*
ditions and requirements will vary with different re-
gions, but principles are essential. One important,
fundamental principle is that pec-ole should be able'to
live the way they want to live, as actually ascertained
in a survey, and not as it is presumed they want to live.
Authorities tend to regard matters as they are as an
indication of requirements for the future* It must be
remembered that people live as they do, often unaware
of the shortcomings of their environment, because they
have had no experience with other conditions and are
not aware of the possibilities and implications of other
methods of living. These must be explained and demon-
strated to them and the choice left with the people
themselves.
It is likely that in every region it will be
necessary to provide different types of housing to suit
differing individual needs. Experiment, and increasing
experience, will, no doubt, change these needs consid-
erably. The different types of housing may be separ-
ated from one another, which for experimental reasons
is desirable, or they may be intermingled, according to
the requirements of planning in any given locality.
CLASSIFICATION OF HOUSING.
Broadly speaking, the Housing types may be
classified as follows -
I. Individual houses
(a) on individual blocks of land?
(b) on community or state owned, land
without fenceso
11. Dwellings in Terraces,
111. Dwellings in blocks
Although all these types and the variations in between,
should be provided, if required, this Society consid-
ers that maximum economics ana amenities are possible
with type 111 and that neither I nor II can provide
complete solutions of the housing problem by themselves.
Of Type I (a) we have already ia.d much experience, and
so far it has proved inadequate for r.asons already ad-
vanced. Experiment al one can determine the merits, for
this country, of the other types.
PRIORITY OF HOUSING.
Planning should ensure that after the war
Housing projects are given priority by authorities,
over all other building activities, for manpower, mater-
ials and money. Housing includes provision of the am-
enities of housing such as community centres, parks.
Kindergartens, etc.


NEIGHBOURHOOD UNITS.
DESIGN. All housing should be designed in
neighbourhood units, either by architects working in
groups, or by open competitions, not limited to members
of Architectural Institutes, the sites -and general con-
ditions being selected and drawn up by Divisional Plan-
ning Agencies.
In neighbourhood units the interests of the
Community take precedence over the interests of any in-
dividual. In neighbourhood units provision must be made
for the social, recreational and educational needs of
the members. This is achieved by community centres
placed within \ mile of the most distant member.
This Society considers that every housing pro-
ject must be of sufficient size to justify a community
centre, and that no housing project can be successful
without one. Basing the figure on English recommend-
ations we tentatively suggest 2000 families as a mini-
mum for this purpose and strongly recommend that an ex-
periment be conducted on this basis.
It is not proposed to make out a case for com-
munity centres,.unless the Commission should require it,
but in the opinion of the Society they, in conjunction
with pre-school child facilities, constitute the funda-
mental requirement of successful, modern housing.
The community centre should comprise -
sporting facilities (indoor and outdoor);
swimming pool;
Assembly Hall;
meeting rooms;
library;
craft and work rooms;
cafeteria;
gymnasium;
health clinic;
and should be divided into 3 main sections
1. Pre-school Child Section;
2. Youth Section;
3. Adult Section.
In small towns and communities a smaller centre may be
necessary, and the Society submits a sketch showing
typical accommodation considered desirable. (See Appen-
dix ?D W .)
KINDERGARTENS.
Similarly it is not proposed to make out a


case for Kindergarten and Pre-school Child Centres unless
required to do so, but it is considered that centres
such as the Lady Gowrie Child Centre already established
in all Australian Capital Cities by the Federal Govern-
ment should be within reach of every child. These
serve a twofold function -
(a) They give children the maximum opportun-
ities to develop balanced, normal person-
alities - readily adaptable to the needs
of social intercourse;
(b) . They increase the efficiency of mothers,
as well as giving them opportunities for
self development, which should not stop
at child birth.
LAUNDRIES.
In neighbourhood units it is desirable to en-
sure that provision is made for good laundry facilities
by one or other of the following means -
(a) Where the size of the unit justifies it
on economic grounds, laundry service
should be included for a slight increase
in weekly rentals. The service should
be quick (24 hours) and if possible in-
clude mending and darning, perhaps for
a small extra charge. Research amongst
existing laundries would enable an econ-
omic size of unit to be determined.
(b) Where the size of the unit does not jus-
tify employment of a permanent laundry
staff sufficient community laundries
should be provided in the project to en-
able all housewives to complete their
major washing in a minimum time. The
laundries should be furnished with mod-
ern equipment, drying racks, ironing
machines, etc. and arranged so that each
family wash can be a private matter if
so desired.
(c) Where a unit is very small there should
be a separate, properly equipped laundry
with gas copper, hot water taps, elect-
ric wringers, electric irons and elect-
ric ironing rollers etc. to every five
dwellings.
In all cases, in addition to whatever else is
provided, each dwelling should be equipped with facil-
ities for light, daily washing, including 2 small
troughs and hot water tap, and wringer, as well as iron-
ing board and point for electric iron.


In neighbourhood units it is desirable to
arrange for tenants I committees of management to be el-
ected annually* Under the governing direction of Con-
trolling Authorities such as Municipalities, Corpora-
tions, Governments, or other bodies, where such exist
in relation to any project, (see later) these commit-
tees are to be responsible fors-
(a) upkeep of premises in tidy and clean
condition;
(b) improvements and development of lawns,
shrubs, gardens, which can be arranged
by -
(i) organised working bees of tenants;
(ii) employed gardeners;
(iii) both the above;
(c) ensuring the social co-operation of ten-
ants and their children;
(d) ensuring that all illnesses receive
prompt attention;
(e) reporting all matters of maintenance
to the controlling authority;
(f) general welfare of tenants*
These responsibilities will be varied and extended con-
siderably according to the type of enterprise, method
of financing etc. The essential point is that tenants
have an authoritative voice in all matters which con-
cern them as a community, and in co-operative Building
Societies (see later) where tenants -are co-investors,
the Management Committee will handle finance, rents,*
etc. and be their own Controlling Authorities.
In addition to the voluntary committees,
neighbourhood units should preferably be of a size to
justify the employment of a small staff under a Jan. tor,
consisting of an.electrician - who, amongst other thing-
would be responsible for the neighbourhood public light-
ing in parks, stair wells, corridors etc. - a carpenter
and cleaners. Tenants of the units themselves might
be employed in these cap acities vith advantage.
All units should provide an office for an
Estate Secretary (who would represent the Controlling
Authority or the tenants themselves, according to the
type of enterprise) who would be responsible for due
collection of rents, payment of insurances, tenancies
and for other matters as required.


Neighbourhood units offer the possibilities
of members contributing to an insurance fund to ensure
the continuous payment of rent during periods of unem-
ployment.
REFUSE DISPOSAL.
Hygienic mechanical methods of disposal of
refuse should be investigated and installed wherever
possible.
REQUIREMENTS OF DWELLINGS.
The minimum requirements of dwellings are, in
the opinion of the Society, as followss-
(i) Privacy and quiet. Both of these can be
achieved by Planning, Utilization of the
knowledge of Acoustics in placing build-
ings in relation to one another and in
planning the individual buildings to-
gether with sound insulating materials
and methods should augment the control
of noise effected by isolation of living
zones from traffic arteries.
Windows of dwellings should face green
parks and gardens and not be overlooked
by windows of adjoining buildings.
(ii) Control of summer and winter penetration
of sunlight to habitable rooms, accord-
ing to climatic requirements of individ-
ual regions, by correct plan orientations
and attention to projections over open-
ings etc.
In the Perth region as many rooms as pos-
sible should face north. Western open-
ings should be avoided except for the
purpose of obtaining views.
In this connection see also notes in
this report dealing with sunlight angles.
(lii) Pleasant and leafy surroundings removed
from streets and noisy traffic.
(iv) Dwellings should be mechanically heated
in winter, and kept cool in summer by
modern insulating technics. The manu-
facture of vermiculite products in this
State should simplify the problem so fir
as Western Australia is al-
though other available materials may
also be revealed in a survey.
Central heating should operate from cen-
trally placed boilers which also supply
hot water to all fittings* Such instal-


lations are only efficient and econom-
ical on a large scale. Copious supplies
of hot water at all hours are essential
to a comfortable and healthy life and
lighten the burden of housework consid-
erably.
The internal spaces of a dwelling should
be arranged to give much more importance
to pleasure and to the minimising of house-
work than has hitherto been the general
case. Some particular suggestions are as
followss-
(a) A utility workroom should be provided
in which hobbies can be followed up,
children's boys and litter stored,
and odd Jobs carried out. This room
should include the light washing fac-
ilities already referred to and should
provide hooks for internal clothes
lines for airing clothes, hooks for
damp overcoats, a shelf for damp shoes.
Meters, pipes and rubbish chutes can
pass through this room, which should
also have shelves, a general purpose
cupboard, a broom cupboard, and elec-
tric ironing facilities.
(b> Living Room. This should include an
area for dining which can be thrown,
into general use when required and
should be capable of extension, in
suitable weather, by opening onto
covered terraces or balconies. Where
terraces or balconies are provided
one other wall must be lighted dir-
ectly from the outside without veran-
das. The roan should bo as large as possible.
( c ) Bod_Rooms need not be large but must
have ample built-in cupboards, and
oe designed to obtain the benefit of
evening breezes in summer, and other
advantages of sleeping, cut by the
size and placing of openings or to
be planned as out-door rooms, with
dressing-rooms attached. Cross
ventilation is essential.
Separate bedrooms to be provided for
male and female children over six
years of age.
No more unan 2 puople co inhabit one
bedroom or outdoor room.
(d) Kitchens should have two sinks with
hot v/ater taps and two draining boards
and plate racks, gas or electric stoves
built in refrigerators, two power
points, and with wall space for a
small table, hatch to dining room,
tradesman's hatch, ventilated food
cup


small table, hatch to living room,
tradesman's hatch, ventilated food
cupboards, crockery cupboards, cup-
boards for dry foods and for pots and
pans.
Wall _surf aces adjacent to sinks should
be tiled and the floor covered with
linoleum, cork or rubber or other sim-
ilar impervious floorings.
( e ) Bath rooms should have bath, shower
and lavatory basin each with hot water
taps, and should have impervious floor
and walls. Mirrors, towel rails, cab-
inets etc. are essential. In one bed
room dwellings there could be a W,C.
in the bath room. Where there is more
than one bed room there should be a
separate W.C. adjacent to the bath
room if it is the only W.C. provided.
All W.C. 1 s should be fitted with sil-
ent flushers.
Where mechanical ventilation is in-
stalled bath rooms and W.C. *s need not
be placed on external walls.
(f) Eurni.ture_. All dwellings should T?e
provided with essential furniture;
It should be of simple, light design
capable of standing heavy use. By
making this provision it is considered
that encouragement can be given to
the standardised mass production of
high quality furniture which will be
serviceable and in good taste aes-
thetically. The Society considers
that the public should be protected
from misguided purchases of expensive
low grade furnishings with mock ven-
eers and cheap varnish stain finishes,
and that furnishing rightly comes with-
in the scope of housing.
(g) ELy wire. All windows, doors, vent-
ilators etc. in Australian homes
should be protected by removable fly
wire screens.
(h)Lighting. Electric light outlets
should be arranged to suit the activ-
ities of each room, and not merely
hung from the centre of the ceiling
of each room. Provision should be
made for plug-in reading lamps in
living rooms and bed rooms. Bed room
lights should have two-way switches
and be controlled from the bed. All
rooms should have one power point and


living rooms at least two.
Electric fittings should be standard-
ised, as suggested for furniture, so
that by mass production efficiency
can be improved ard costs lowered;
By the application of similar meth-
ods and planned economy to all mech-
anical amenities and gadgets, it is
considered that costs can be lowered
to such an extent that in due course
we car expect to see even radios 'pro-
vided as part of th 3 essential equip-
ment of houses.
fe.lephones. Provision should be made
for tne simplification of the instal-
lation of telephones where and when-
required by individual tenants or
house owners, A public telephone
should be provided for every 20
dwellings.
Ceiling heights. Special mention is
made of this matter since it is con-
sidered of far reaching importance.
The Society is of the opinion that a
minimum ceiling height of B*6 ? * for
habitable rooms should be established
by regulation rather than the 10*6?
height generally adopted in this
State. This is for several reasons -
1. Economy of building costs in this
direction can enable improvements in
other directions.
2. Improvement of ventilation. The
low ceiling enables window openings
to be carried up the full height thus
obviating celling pockets of still
air. It enables the omission of
ceiling and wall vents which have
long been out-of-date in other coun-
tries. Ceiling vents are a constant
source of dust dropping into a room
when eddies of wind in the roof space
disturb the dust there. They har-
bour spiders and cobwebs and admit
flies which, get into re of spaces
through eaves, cavities etc. They
are unsightly. They add expense
and can be the source of unpleasant
draughts as well as interfering with
the operation of chimney flues in
the same room.
3. Economy of built-in cupboards
which need not have separate ceil-
ings, which gather dust, or be faced
above with unnecessary walling.
4. Improvement in artificial and
natural lighting.


5. Improvement in internal propor-
tions of rooms.
6. Improvement in external appear-
ance made possible by bringing the
building to a better scale.
7. Cooler conditions in summer since
a light breeze can change all the
air in a room more quickly where
there is a low ceiling. Heat insu-
lating materials are also more effi-
cient.
8, Central heating, radiators and
open fires can operate more effici-
ently and quickly in winter.
It is recognized that many of the recommen-
dations made so far in this report, are only possible
of realization in large blocks of dwellings designed
on neighbourhood, community principles. Up to a cer-
tain point-the larger the community the cheap-er and
more efficient its services and amenities become. But
if the satisfaction of human needs is the governing
factor of planning, the neighbourhood units should not
be so large that they destroy the very conditions they
set out to provide. Ho neighbourhood community should
be so large that a sense of unity, both amongst the
tenants and in architectural ensemble, is lost. Exper-
iment alone can determine the norms, and it as suggested
that 2000 families be taken as the unit of size for pre-
liminary trial purposes. As an illustration, Appendix
"E" is submitted.
DENSITY (POPULATION).
If planning on the community basis is to be
properly organized, and if full advantage is to be
taken of the economies and improvements in social and
civic life that it offers, it is necessary to have c r-
tain concentrations of population. This involves a
fresh conception of densities by authorities, and the
public generally.
Reference to standards of so many persons per
acre is likely to stifle attempts to improve our ways of
living. These standards appear to have been erbitrarddy
chosen, and if accepted without regard to qualifying
conditions, can put unscientific restrictions on the
range of our imaginative thought. The idea that there
is any special virtue in low densities - for example,
such as Perth?s suburbs with 4 families per acre - is
unable to stand investigation. Under conditions where
every acre is covered by buildings, or private allot-
ments, or roads, the land, is so tied up that it can-
not be turned to the advantage of the community, and
it is not until he has covered a long journey to his
own residence that a citizen can relax.


Present thought on density appears to be con-
fused with the question of crowding although the two
conditions are entirely different. Crowding and over-
crowding are bad, and conduce to slums, but they only
exist with high densities where every acre is covered.
If a concentration of people onto one acre
releases surrounding acres for community purposes such
as parks, gardens, playing fields, or if it even merely
leaves?the original bush, with its trees and wildflowers,
undisturbed, then the whole physical environment is
raised to higher levels of beauty, and man is exerting
a conscious, planned control of his surroundings impos-
sible with the spread given by unrelieved low densities
as they now exist.
In a planned community it is not possible for
high densities to degenerate into crowding, nor is it
possible for slums to develop as a result of high den-
sities. The process of planning precludes this possi-
bility.
Densities should be controlled by economic
and human social needs, not by arbitrarily stated fig-
ures, It follows that densities will require to be
varied from place to place, and that a fixed general
figure as a standard therefore serves to stultify org-
anic development. It is also inconsistent with the
principles of regional planning.
DENSITY (BUILDINGS'',.
Where there are concentrations of population
there must be large building blocks. It is essential
that these be suitably spaced on a background of parks.
It is recommended that these buildings be spaced by the
use of angles of light, so that the taller a building
the greater is the area of open ground around it (see
fig. 1, and notes on angles of light).
In this connection it is desired to mention
that Walter Gropius (see Thomas Sharps **Town Planning?)
has shown that, given an equal angle of light, say 30�
between blocks of dwellings on a given site (see Fig, 2)
the amount of possible living space increases with the
increase in height of the blocks (i.e, the number of
storeys); so that in comparison with a two-storeyed
layout, a ten storeyed layout could have 50% more dwel-
lings and all enjoy the same amount of light and air
(see Fig. 3).
This is also stated in other words. The
higher the blocks of buildings (keeping the same angle
of light an/i providing the same number of dwellings) Q


the less is the amount of "building space necessary, so
that, by comparison, housing in ten storeyed blocks
requires 40% less land than housing by 2 storeyed
blocks - each enjoying the same amount of light and
air (see Pig. 4),
It is stated in other words again: Providing
the same amount of dwellings and land as shown in fig,
2 there is an immense gain in light and air the higher
the buildings go - thus if the assumed angle of light
is 30� and is maintained for the 2 storeyed blocks, the
angle of light becomes 17-3� for the 10 storeyed blocks,
and the distance between the blocks becomes nearly 10
times greater. (See Pig. 3.)
SUNLIGHT ANGLES.
The best method of ensuring adequate sunlight
in buildings is to conurol the distance between them
according to uheir height and their orientation. This
can be done by the use of sunlight angles as has been
suggested. Should any ascertained angle of sunlight,
which enables an agreed standard of sunlight penetra-
tion to rooms to be conformed with pro/e to give inad-
equate ground space surrounding buildings, from the
aesthetic or social use point of view, then it is sug-
gested that the angle of sunlight in the locality con-
cerned be flattened at the discretion of Divisional
Planning Agencies,
In the opinion of this Society a sunlight
angle should not be stated as a fixed figure in a given
locality. It is realized that such a figure simplifies
the work of authorities administering building by-laws
where the righis of light of existing premises are to
be protected. Where the angle is to become the basis
of the spacing of buildings in new large scale projects,
it is desirable to bear in mind that it must vary ac-
cording to orientation of buildings and falls in ground
levels. For this reason one of two courses seems to
be necessary, either --
(a) express the angle as a formula or graph,
which relates latitude ano. orientation.
(b) establish, say, four angles to suit dif-
ferent orientations in each latitude*
At the present time the Society is engaged in research
along these lines.
Standards of sunlight penetration must bo re-
garded as variable according to latitude and to the
change of seasons and should not be expressed only in
hours but also in maximum distances of penetration*
From the south to the north of the Commonwealth, the


variations In desirable winter and summer penetrations
can probably be expressed in graph form.
It is considered that the pleasures of shop-
ping should be accentuated by the placing of shops in
garden areas amply provided with shade trees, seats,
rair shelta as etc- and by elimination of the traffic
nuisance by provision of car parking areas within a few
minutes waif of shops, .erevision for jrade vehicles to
be made by each entrance.w
RURAL HOUSING.
This Soci ity believe.? that, while there should
be a contrast between the environment of the town and
that of the Country , vine amenities of the town should
be brought to the country.
This can be done in two wayss-
(a) improved conditions of housing in the
country?
(b) Improved transport facilities connecting
the country to the town.
There are three different sets of conditions
to be coped with, firstly those in the areas which arc
relatively closely settled, these which are very sparseiiy
settled, and those which come in between..
Improved housing conditions in the relatively
closely settled areas can only be brought about by enor-
mous increases in the incomes of settlers and workers
or by the development of small neighbourhood farm units
complete with community centre, swimming pool and pre-
school child facilities. Since the units may not be
sufficiently large to justify, on economic grounds, the
provision of these amenities outside the*ir>wns and vil-
lages, they will require to be subsidised by Govern-
ments in all cases where the community is not able to
afford their initial installation*
It is recognized that such units can only be
effective by a redistribution and repartitioning of
land. Commonwealth ownership, or control, would facil-
itate this, and permit the grouping of dwellings by the
leasing of land to group settlements. This would also
lead to the introduction of large scale agricultural
work and the standardisation of farm machinery, thereby
cheapening the costs of both the 'work and the -implements


and giving greater leisure time to the individuals con-
cerned, In all such concentrations the principle for
the management of the units already described should be
adhered to, namely the election of committees of manage-
ment;
It is estimated that a survey would reveal that
of the small, individual fanners scattered in isolation,
and often without the most simple amenities, surprisingly
few would be found to own their properties unmortgaged
or even properly equipped. We agree with Professor S.M.
Wadham that it is necessary for farmers, in their own
interests, to act collectively, and that "the Australian
countryside might well develop on a more effective basis
if co-operation were adopted as a principle". Certainly
no housing improvements, involving improved cultural and
social facilities, can be possible otherwise.
Planning would ensure that a limited number of
farm units would have their common focus in a village or
township provided with shops, amusements, workshops,
church, hospital, school, library, child centres, health
centre, and an assembly hall for meetings, dances etc.
Transport between farm units and townships and
between townships and larger towns ?nd cities, would re-
quire to be designed for speed and comfort, so that by
car or bus passengers could proceed to their destination
without slowing down at crossings or in passing inter-
mediate towns. A journey of 100 miles could then become
a minor matter in a countryside where the conquest of
space is essential if the inhabitants are to live full,
hgppy lives.
In sparsely settled areas where neighbourhood
fam units are not practicable, it often happens that
station owners are already able to achieve a high stan-
dard of living. Minimum standards should be drawn up,
covering the living conditions of employees and natives
as well as farmers, and in cases where these standards
cannot otherwise be obtained they should be provided by
Government assistance in the form of loans of cheap
money, by subsidy, or other methods, according to the
importance of the work being undertaken*
Transport should be studied from the point of
view of air services, covering local journeys as well as
more distant ones, and utilizing some of the emergency
landing fields already in existance.
In rural districts with conditions between
two described above, planning for each individual
case can alone solve the problem. The general tenden-
cies should be towards the co-operative association of


people in units and the general conditions outlined for
closely settled areas.
Rural housing standards should be similar to
those for towns except where requirements for town
dwellings are obviously impracticable in the country,
and except where country requirements call for special
features in the planning of dwellings. Country houses
should be capable of extension, as family needs grow,
in all localities where a change of residence is not
practicable, Unis suggests that the possibilities of
prefabricated, demountable building units, capable of
assembly in a variety of plans, should be exhaustively
Also the fullest study should be given to the
possibilities of the mass production of standardised
sanitary bath and kitchen fitting units, and domestic
furnishings.
In connection with Rural Housing this Society
considers that the survey period of the planning process
should ascertain the fullest possible information with
regard to the possibilities of -
(a) electrification of the countryside;
(b) inqorovement of water supply;
(c) prevention of soil erosion;
(d) chemical rehabilitation of barren soils;
(e) establishment of chains of landing
fields;
(f) establishment of gliding as a recreation.
EMERGENCY WAR TIME HOUSING.
This Society, recognizing the need for con-
servation of manpower and materials during the war,
considers that temporary war time housing should, never-
theless, take cognizance of elementary human needs and
in doing so provide excellent opportunities for demon-
strating the advantages of neighbourhood units.
Standardised, demountable dwelling units in
timber grouped around a recreation or club building
with pre school child facilities, community laundry,
canteen etc. could form quite cheap but attractive
temporary housing. It is suggested that groups of
allotments not yet utilized in the existing pattern
of our suburbs, but having water and other services in
the vicinity, could be found in suitable localities.


GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP.
The difficulties of implementation can be
overcome if the method of approach to the problem is
correct. A National Plan must include the means by
which it can be put into execution. Under the leader-
ship of the Federal Government all Government Bodies
must legislate to ensure the maintenance of the spirit
of the Plan. Government regulations and their enforce-
ment must 'be reduced to the minimum consistent with
this objective. Initiative must be left to individual
regions and individuals under the expert advice and con-
trol of the Divisional Planning Agencies who will have
drawn up the plans for the regions.
Government participation in building projects
should be limited to rendering financial assistance and
to stimulating activity. Where Governments find it
necessary to construct, the work should be of the high-
est quality and^ should utilize the most up-to-date tech-
niques of building practice and be in keeping with 20th
Century Architecture.
It will be necessary for all people to co-
operate with Governments by acquiescence in all regu-
lations and controls introduced in the interests of
the plan, and tc exercise initiative in carrying it
forward. This they are likely to do if they have had
a voice in preparing the plan and. have been kept in-
formed in as public and open a manner as possible from
the inception of planning work.
The Government, Municipal Councils, Borough
Council, organized bodies and authorities @anerally must
co-operate with the public by explaining reasons for all
controls and by hearing all objections and comments.
Legislation will be necessary to ensure that
the public welfare comes before private interests and
that no^ speculation is possible in land or buildings.
There will be opposition to this from individuals but
whole-hearted, enthusiastic support from, the public.
LAND CONTROL.
The most important aspect of the implement-
ation of Planning is the control of land. Without un-
ified control of land no is possible. This
Society agrees with the statement of the Committee under
the Chairmanship _of Sir Augustus Uthwatt that "immediate
transfer to public ownership of all land would present
the logical solution". That being so we consider that
all land of the Commonwealth should be owned by the


Commonwealth, and that the transfer to such ownership
is ?practicable as an immediate measure I *.
COMPENSATION.
In this connection we claim that land of it-
self has only potential value until it has been im-
proved by -
(a) introduction of services - electricity,
gas, water, sewerage, roads, etc,*
(b) erection of buildings or other works;
(c) agricultural, mining or other processes.
The services which give value to land are paid
for by the community and maintained by the immunity
including the individual owner, in their annual rates
and taxes. It follows that enhanced value of land, due
to the provision of services, should not be a matter for
the private profit of the owner of the land for the time
being, but for the whole community.
Therefore the only values which belong to
the individual owner for the time being are those due
to agricultural, building or other works carried cut by
him.
In the change over from individual to national
ownership these considerations should be borne in mind
in assessing values for the purposes of compensation.
It is considered that compensation should be paid in all
cases where the needs of a plan require the removal of
an activity to a new location, but that compensation is
not necessary where persons or activities are permitted
- for the time being - to remain where they are. For
compensation of landlords etc. whose livelihood is from
land or property (see ? The amounts to
be paid in cases of compensation would have no relation-
ship to ruling real estate valuations, but would be ac-
curately determined figures based on previously arranged
methods of computing, with the element of estimating
reduced to a minimum. For example, in the case of (b)
above, compensation might be on the basis of original
cost of buildings and fixed installations less depreci-
ation at an agreed percentage per annum. In the case of
(c) compensation might cover costs of buildings and
fixtures less depreciation, plus an amount equal to the
income the owner might have expected had whatever agri-
cultural process he had commenced been allowed to com-
plete its natural process before being interrupted by
the needs of planning


PENSIONS,
In the case of persons whose livelihood would
be lost as the result of land acquisition for other
purposes, or as the result, for the time being, of any
activity of planning, it is suggested that reasonable
pensions be paid until such time as they are able to
find suitable means of making a living.. In the case
of old people the pensions to be for life and to be
sufficient to enable maintenance of the standard of
living to which they have been accustomed, or to im-
prove it.
.QOMPULSOSY AMORTIZATION.
Professors Walter Gropius ana Martin Wagner
of the Dept, of Agriculture, Harvard University, have
made a valuable suggestion by means of which a large
fund could be built up from which to finance planning
projects. This Society considers that a fund is desir-
able from which to pay compensation claims and that the
Gropius-Wagner suggestions are worthy of adoption for
this purpose until all claims are paid, which
the fund would continue until no longer required by the
financial needs of planning.
Quoting from the ?Architectural Forum", July
"The M.R.F.GL (Metropolitan Reconstruction Fin-
ance Corporation) would have its own finan-
cial resources for carrying through its gig-
antic task. The main financial source from
which this capital would be derived is the
amortization quota of all taxable and non-
taxable city structures* In the past no one
took care of the proper amortization of priv-
ately or publicly owned property, although
man-made capital goods enter upon the first
phase of obsolesconce on the day they are
completed. In order to protect the stock-
and-bond Holders of corporations by preserv-
ing invested capital, our commercial code
provides minute regulations for the setting
aside of amortization and depreciation quotas;
but nothing has been done in this respect
for the public corporations; for town, city
and nation. Their shareholders, the citizens
at large, were in the hands of private prop-
erty holders who could - as they pleased -
preserve or consume their real estate proper-
ty, though it was not built for self consump-
tion but for tae needs of the tenants and the
whole community. A nationwide building law
should therefore be enacted prescribing com-
pulsory amortization and depreciation for all
building struetures, their quotas to bo admin-
istered by the M,R.F,O. Such a regulation
would not mean compulsory expropriation of


private property; on the contrary it would
mean its conservation. The owners would be
duly credited with the annual quotas, but
would only be entitled to spend them for the
renewal and rebuilding of city structures.
"With this money the M.R.F.C. could tackle and
guide the rehabilitation of our own cities
along the sound way of perennial renewal ac-
cording to the specific needs of the city and
ever-changing technological developments. As
a controlling agency a State Reconstruction
Finance Corporation and its superimposed Fed-
eral Corporation would have to be equipped
with sn adequate percentage of the incoming
amortization and depreciation quotas of the
local corporations for the purpose of balanc-
ing the richer against the poorer, and the
flourishing against the dying communities.
Such a revolving fund in the hands of a dis-
interested public authority would be a great
stimulus to the renewal of our cities.
"But before the Government has actually endowed
suitable planning agencies with the necessary-
legal, financial and administrative tools the
design of the first model master plans can be
started. Public funds should be allocated for
competitions amongst the best planners and de-
signers for the creation of examples of com-
munity planning - examples of rehabilitation
of old existing towns as well as of the design
of new ones. Public reaction to the results
of such competitions would enable the Govern-
ment to provide the legal tools so urgently
needed for the creation of the actual master
plans."
This Society?s suggestions for the preparation
of the actual master plans and the organization of auth-
orities have been made elsewhere in this report. The
above quotation ties in with our proposals.
It is suggested that all buildings, not only
city buildings, might be; the subject of compulsory am-
ortization. This would make a large^fund available to
meet compensation claims as they arise with the pro-
gressive implementation of plans.
THE UTHWATT REPORT.
If the land cannot be transferred to the Com-
monwealth by methods suggested, the following proposals
of the Uthwatt Report are considered to be in the pub-
lic interest and their adoption is recommended, subject
to modification as required by the proposals of this
Society.


1. Immediate nationalization of all develop-
ment rights for fair compensation.
2. All new development to be prohibited un-
less initiated or approved by the author-
5. All land to be used for new development to
be acquired at fair value and leased to
the developer.
BUILDING AGENCI
Bodies able to organize housing projects are
1. Governments - Federal and State
Govt, controlled industries.
2, Municipal Authorities - Roads Boards,
City Councils,
Borough Councils,
5. Private Organizations - Industrial Corpor-
ations,
Trade Unions,
Building Societies
and Agencies,
Co-operative Buil-
ding Societies.
4. Private individuals.
This Society believes that, under the condi-
tions of planning, which necessitate rigid control of
development and the abolition of speculation, many pri-
vate organisations and individuals will not, in the
early stages be attracted to housing. . It will, there-
fore, be the duty of Governments to stimulate the form-
ation of suitable building agencies.
INITIATION OF SCHEMES.
The initiating of housing schemes by Authola-
ities will, no doubt, be necessary in seme instances,
such as schemes for old people, hostels for single per-
sons, housing for lower paid workers and wherever pub-
lic initiative itself is lacking. In many of these cases
municipalities are the logical agencies. They should
know the needs of their localities in detail, and under
the guidance of the Divisional Planning Agencies, pre-
viously described, should be able to initiate building
works.
Generally, we consider that Governments should
carry out as little work as possible, but should give


maximum guidance and encouragement to approved building
agencies.
ARCHITECTURAL COMPETITIONS.
Provision for all major architectural works
to be carried out as the result of open competition oy
architects and groups of architects should be national
policy. (See also reference to architectural competitions
under "Neighbourhood Units - Design".)
In this way enterprises will be more organic
growing from below, and will assume more varied forms of
expression, thereby obviating the danger of monotony in
architectural expression. Further, shortage of Govern-
ment funds would be less likely to impede progress of
works, and responsibility lor providing housing would be
shared by the public, thereby stimulating interest and
arousing civic pride and social consciousness.
Recognizing that many types of building agen-
cies would arise, and should be encouraged for experi-
mental purposes, if Government leadership were strong
and imaginative, this Society, nevertheless, considers
that the most satisfactory type is the Co-operative
Bullding Society.
We'quote Elizabeth Denbyg "Europe Rehouse i"
page 46, with regard to Co-operative Building Societies,
as followsg-
"More interesting, and more democratic are the
Co-operative Building Societies which, inspired
originally by the English Consumers 5 Societies
have flourished on the Continent, The move-
ment was warmly encouraged for, under proper
safeguards, it has exceptional financial- in-
dependence and stability. A substantial part
of the building costs can be raised from mem-
bers of the Society who are themselves to in-
habit the dwellings, and outside help is only
needed in raising the balance of the capital
at a reasonably low rate of interest, or in
getting suitable land at a reasonable price.
Co-operative Building Societies are formed in
several ways, either by persons of the same
occupation, or by those who wish to live in a
certain district, or who wish to pay rents
within a certain range. Tenants are, of
course, directly interested not only in the
general planning of the estate and the ouai-.
ity of the structure, but also in the annual
expenditure on maintenance and repairs; out-
goings are closely watched, and careless ten-
ants dealt with by their co-investors. This
source of building has reached its most vigor-


oils development in the Scandinavian countries,
though it is also flourishing in Czechoslo-
vakia. ?
It seems to this Society that this method is
ideal for bringing neighbourhood units into existence,
and that there are many organisations in Australia which
would welcome the opportunity to take part in such an
enterprise, were its possibilities revealed to them,
such, for example, as Trader., Unions, workers in any one
factory, or industry.
The Society submits as Appendix "f" a scheme
which was prepared by it, and submitted to the Univers-
ity of Western Australia, for the experimental develop-
ment, on a ralatively small scale, of a block of land
in the possession of the University. Although this is
a neighbourhood unit it is too small to show real econ-
omies, but it is submitted as an illustration of the
proposed working of a Co-operative Building Society;
The original report to the University, which accompanied
the drawings, is also attached, showing estimated costs
and proposed methods of financing.
FINANCE.
In stimulating Building Activity the Federal
Government should operate by extending the powers of the
Mortgage Bank to facilitate the guaranteeing of loans
to approved societies, or the issue of loans, and in
some cases for the granting of subsidies outright. It
should control interest rates on money lent, rather than
rents, and in advancing loans itself they should be, if
for housing purposes, at very low rates of interest.
(See also previous notes "Compulsory Amortization".)
Municipalities should help by advancing money at low
rates of interest, by supplying services, roads etc.
at cost, or less, and by release, for approved projects,
from charges for rates for 2, 5 or more years.
LIFE OF DWELLINGS AND AMORTIZATION PERIOD.
It is estimated that the functional life of
speculatively built suburban house - that-is, the maj-
ority of suburban houses - is 15 t-o- 20 years. At the
end of that time, if other housing were available, the
value of the house would be gone. The fact that such
houses continue to be occupied, and to be bought and
sold, indicates that nothing better is available, and
this factor should be born in mind when computing es-
timates of housing needs. With neighbourhood units
and planned communities it is considered that the fun-
ctional life of the dwellings w'ould be increased to at
least 50 years, because of the mobility of the occu-
pants and the variety of types of dwelling accommoda-
tion which should be offered, so that change overs can


be made as family needs change. For this reason amor-
tization of loans should he spread over long periods.
The only control of rents necessary should he
to ensure that they cover -
1, Interest on loans and investments 5
2. Amortization of loans;
3. Maintenance, running costs, rates and
taxes;
and that they do not allow for profit to individuals but
may include contributions to any fund, or funds, for any
purpose desired by the tenants.
If control of private profits in housing is
not exercised, multi-dwelling buildings and neighbour-
hood units would quickly degenerate into mere commer-
cial flats, as we know them today, and with which they
should not be confused. Their similarity is in form
only.
By leaving rents unrestricted it will be pos-
sible for the highest levels of quality to be reached
in wealthy neighbourhoods. Restricted rents would have
the effect of restricting building qualities and com-
forts to the minimum standards required by by-laws..
Minimum standards are negative. The improvement of
standards must be a constant aim. This Society con-
siders that minimum standards at present serve the pur-
pose of controlling private speculators, and that the
removal of speculation from the sphere of housing will
tend to raise standards automatically.
BUILDING BY-LAWS.
We consider that Building By-Laws and Regula-
tions should be the concern of individual regions; that
they should be based on Regional Plan requirements and
be consistent with the requirements of Divisions and
States that they should be in 2 sections -
a short statement of principles in con-
cise categorical form;
(b) an appendix with clear, technical explan-
ations where such are necessary.
We consider that they should be so worded that
new materials, new techniques, new experiments can be


tried, and not as at present where all departures from
standard practice are stifled, and many materials ren-
dered incapable of proper utilization. In this connec-
tion we say that Building By-Laws should be plastic and
interpreted and administered by technical experts and *
not by Municipal Secretaries etc. The technical experts
(architects attached to the Regional Planning Agencies
- see Appendix ?h n ) to have discretionary powers to a
limited extent. In cases of dispute, or where amend-
ments are considered desirable, the Divisional Planning
Agencies to have power to decide, or to amend the appen-
dix of the by-laws.
FIRE HAZARDS.
The known methods of fire prevention and con-
trol to be employed and regulations governing exits,
escape stairs, fire doors etc. rationalized to suit the
requirements of neighbourhood unit designing.
HEALTH REGULATIONS, TOWN PLANNING BY-LAWS ETC.
It is considered that all regulations relating
to building, under whatever Act they originate, should
be co-ordinated and published in the one set of By-Laws.


CONCLUSION.
Subject always to amendment, in the light of
more complete knowledge, which would be obtained by a
more comprehensive survey than this Society has the re-
sources to undertake, we make the following tentative
proposals for the short term planning of the post-war
period in the City of Perth. These proposals are broad
and intended as an illustration of what might ev-
olve if the processes recommended in this report are
undertaken and public co-operation is enlisted.
AN ILLUSTRATION.
Closely enveloping the business heart of the
City of Perth is an almost continuous belt, roughly
outlined on the enclosed map (Appendix ?G I? ) of mostly
sub-standard dwellings, small shops and minor indust-
ries# The area indicated has been mentioned previously
in this report. It has no attractions, at the present
time, as a zone of dwellings, except its proximity to
the City. Since it no longer serves human needs, as
judged by the standards of this century, it is suggested
that the whole area be progressively demolished and re-
constructed to a unified plan, in a manner similar to
that adopted in the City of Barcelona before the Spanish
Civil War. The industries could be moved to equivalent
areas elsewhere, properly grouped and zoned.
By means such as this the City would become
surrounded by r wide belt of park lands on three sides,
having already the river on the south. On the back-
ground of these parks dwellings should be provided for
an estimated number of at least 20,000 families, with
all the amenities and comforts already described. By
carrying the work out in progressive stages buildings
would become occupied as completed so that temporary
lodging would need to be found for a relatively small
number of people.. If modern techniques of shop and
field fabrication of standardised units of construction
are used the speed of building could be high.
A plan such as this would prevent the further
extension of the business section of Perth, which is
now, in our opinion, at its optimum size. Such measures
would be followed by the progressive reorganization of
the City, which is at present unplanned, enabling it to
increase the extent of its activities many times witn-
out increasing its area.
It is recognized that such a scheme would of-
fer many difficulties, but none which - in the opinion
of this Society - could not be overcome by planning.
Objections would no doubt be raised by private interests,


but planning of any kind must inevitably raise sued ob-
jections in one way or another.
The Society has no doubt at all that the or-
ganizing ability and the technical knowledge necessary
to plan and carry through such a scheme, as part of the
larger plans embracing the State and the Commonwealth,
is already available in Western Australia.
Some action is necessary to stop the perpetu-
ation of the existing "pattern? of our inadequate sub-
urban living, and to stop the further spread of the
outer suburbs with its parallel process of decay in
the suburbs closer to the City.
We must not plan now to meet the immediate
needs only, leaving the future to muddle its way through,
or else pull down all that we have shortsightedly under-
taken. We must build the nucleus of a planned environ-
ment which is capable of change and growth, which will
lift our people to new levels of cultural and spiritual
development. The future is vast, and is here.
Let us accept our responsibilities and go for-
ward to high achievements.
