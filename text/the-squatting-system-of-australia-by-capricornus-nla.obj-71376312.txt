THE SQUATTING SYSTEM OF AUSTRALIA.
AGRARIAN QUARRELS.
Those who are fond of tracing historical analogies will find in our
southern colonies a state of things which they may, perhaps, compare to
that existing under the Roman Republic in the time of the Gracchi, and
this resemblance was a common subject of comment among Australian
politicians of the liberal school some years ago. A faction in the
Imperial City had, in defiance of a popular land-law, acquired possession of
large tracts of the public estate, partly by political intrigue, and partly
through usurious dealings, and the Gracchi lost their lives and fortunes in
trying to curb these abuses.
In like manner, the possession of the waste lands of Australia is dis-
puted between two interests, and in outline-the quarrels have some points
of similarity.
But the details of political and social life differ so widely, that, in com-
paring the periods, the contrasts are more marked than the affinities.
Under the Roman system, the universal practice of slavery, and the savage
laws of debt, impressed a character on their doings quite unlike anything
to be found in our colonies. Besides, the modern dispute seems to differ
greatly from the ancient one in the fact that the merits are clearly not all
on one side ; for both parties can show ground?not for the concession of
their demands, but for a more equitable adjustment of the law. So the
parallel is but imperfect.
Politicians of another stamp have proved unsympathetic to these
classical precedents, but in defence of their cause they have imported the
catch-words of old-world conservatism, and they profess to see in their
own party the defenders of vested interests, wealth, and respectability, and
in their opponents the radical vulgar, who in their irreverence would
destroy all that enriches and adorns the State. Colonial Toryism, how-
ever, is rather new, and wants the mellowness of age, though it is natural
that well-to-do people should adopt the creed, especially while the posses-
sion of property retains the freshness of novelty.
But the real importance of the matter is not mainly concerned with
the views of parties, or even with the respective merits of their claims.
The existence of the quarrel itself, the virulence with which it is carried on,
the general violation of truth and honesty to which it has given rise, and its
consequences in retarding colonisation, are the facts which deserve serious


attention. To people not practically acquainted with the life of the
colonies, it may seem strange that, possessing such immense areas of
country to occupy, there should be any perplexity in its allotment; but it
must be remembered that the views of authorities on kindred topics in
the old world are by no means uniform, and Australian colonisation
merely reflects these varieties of opinion.
The present aspect of the question is only the last of a series of changes.
These have been produced by a variety of fortuitous causes, among which
a varied and inconsistent policy in dealing with the waste lands has been
prominent. Following, as well as we can, the twisting and winding of this
policy from the early days of the colony, it appears, among much caprice
and confusion, as if two distinct principles had been at work, sometimes
one being in favour, and sometimes the other. These principles have been
adopted by two opposing schools of economy. The first points to the pro-
duction of wealth as the true and only criterion for the right use of the
soil, and follows the old teachers in their dogmas, propounded under the
emphatic titles of Capital and Rent. By their theory, the human popula-
tion has no claim of right in the land, but takes its place incidentally as
supplying labour for the use of capitalists, or as buyers of marketable pro-
duce. The modern school takes a different position. The distribution of
wealth is by its teachers rated as of equal importance with its production,
and they hold that the earth should be used for the residence and support
of the human family, a view of the matter which their opponents entirely
ignore.
In the colonisation of Australia, no attempt has been made to regulate
or reconcile these conflicting theories, but systems based on each have been
planted in extremely antagonistic forms, sometimes side by side, sometimes
the newer tenure over-riding and displacing the earlier, but almost always
in the position so that the success of the one involves injury to the other.
The fruit of this pernicious legislation is found in the division of every
community in the southern continent and islands into two powerful
bodies, the squatting and the freehold interests, each of which seeks to
destroy the other.
There are good reasons why this quarrel should cease. Year by year
it grows both in dimensions and in bitterness, with increase of wealth,
density of population, and the extension of new settlements. Off-shoots
from the mother-colony have always transplanted with perverse fidelity
the worst features of the squatting system as established in New South
Wales, and now the same cleavage appears wherever a few hundred
colonists gather, whether in the salt-bush plains of the Darling, the
savannahs of the tropical coast, or the peat-mosses and ferny hills of
Otago. The evil began in one colony with only a few thousand people.
Now two millions, living in different territories as large as European king-
doms, have their social relations embittered by the same cause.
The facts that five-sixths of Australia are yet unsettled, and that the
population is growing fast, make this matter still more important.
In carrying out the changes of policy which have acted so injuriously,
one peculiar feature can be recognised throughout which must surprise
all except those familiar with the way in which the British race conducts
public affairs. Past experience seems never to have been referred to, but


the new measure to be made law, whether imported ready-made from
Westminster, or carried by popular acclamation, has always been fitted on
to the colony without the least regard to the natural characteristics of the
country, or to previous legislation. One can hardly imagine the govern-
ment of Russia or of Germany dealing with the colonisation of a new
territory without examining the state records to see what had been done
before ; but one method, whether purely official, as in Crown colonies, or
under the present representative form of government, seems seldom to
take note of the information within reach. In this, ? red tape ? and
?government by majorities ? have been quite at one. Neither popular
members nor servants of the Crown ever thought it necessary to test their
views by statistical facts, and thence the laws of nature and of logic have
been equally set at defiance in their enactments.
If, in dealing with the vital question of land-administration, each new
proposal had been first examined in the light of past experience, much
trouble would have been spared, and a question would have been set at
rest thirty years ago which remains yet unanswered, namely, ? In what
form should the settlement of the country be carried on ? ?
THE COUNTRY.
The first comers in 1788 found before them, as their ships came to
anchor, sandstone bluffs covered with scraggy trees and heath-like plants,
with a bright blue sky above and an elastic buoyant atmosphere around.
As they went inland they found an endless open forest, the ground being
clothed with a light tufty grass, but it was the starved outline of European
woodland scenery, for the trees rose bare and branchless from a thirsty
soil, and the grass covered only half the surface of the earth. Except the
grass, and that was thin enough, though it grew everywhere, the country
seemed poor in products, and looked as if it were involved in a constant
struggle between droughts and floods. They would have judged it to be
poor in capability also, if on further experience a vitality had not appeared
which seemed to electrify the soil on the touch of colonisation. Imported
animals, trees, and plants, lived and flourished among the dingy forests
which barely yielded food enough for a few wandering savages. The
farther they went the greater contrasts appeared, more drought and better
country ; and in later times, as the last of enigmas, a change of vegetation
and climate seemed to follow the settler with his flocks and herds. After
a few years? feeding with stock, water has been found permanently standing
in country where it never stood before, and sometimes the tufty herbage
has changed into a sward. The flats that used in one season to show a
succession of swamps and in another a surface of bare dusty soil rifted with
yawning cracks, has often become good level turf intersected with runnels
cut by the hoofs of the sheep and* cattle.
The occupation of the country with live stock and other causes follow-
ing settlement seem thus to be so effectual in changing the face of the
interior, that the. desert which at times has shown itself, and which should
keep hold of the centre of the continent according to all authorised theories


of the climate, does, in fact, shrink and retreat before the presence of the
settlers, until it is only heard of in dry seasons or met on sterile spots.
But the first look of these wastes was weird and grim. The strange
trees, dry-water channels, hare rocks, and half-naked soil, seemed to tell of
a creation distinct from that of the old world ; for anything that could he
seen, the southern continent might he a flake shaken from another planet.
Now we know better. Botanists have found vegetation akin to the forests
both of Asia and Africa, and another link has been brought to light by
those who can read past history in the stone records of geology, which gives
proof of a yet stranger relation to us. They have discovered that this
nondescript continent presents nearly a repetition of what was to be found
once occupying the site of modern Europe, for the forests of the Eocene
world live in full vigour in Australia to this day.
Both past and future were, however, blank to the pioneers, as they
gazed through the naked tree stems ; but the air was bracing and fragrant
with the resinous gum-leaves, and they felt their blood course freely and
their lungs expand as they climbed the heights and saw still in endless
sameness gaunt tree-tops and a grassy waste.
THE FIRST STEPS OF SETTLEMENT.
For the first thirty years New South Wales was little more than a
huge prison. The free element in the population was very small, and the
settlers were cramped by being confined within a narrow strip of country
by the discipline indispensable in a penal colony, so, little progress in real
colonisation could be looked for. A large proportion of the free settlers
were emancipated prisoners who had procured their discharges or pardons,
but there were also some families of labouring farmers introduced from
the mother country, and a number of officers and soldiers who had belonged
to the garrison. The two last classes chiefly had to face the problem of
how they were to make a living out of the wilderness which spread around.
Soil fit for the plough was scarce; for every acre of loam there were
ten of sandstone or clay. The best land was on the banks of streams,
which were for three seasons little more than chains of ponds, and in the
fourth they were torrents, tearing away chasms, and sweeping down timber,
plainly unsafe sites for farms and villages. At the same time, live stock
left by the shipping had been found to thrive, and there arose a steady
importation of cattle from the Cape and India. Cows were lent on terms
?to settlers by the local government, but so scarce were cattle, even up to
the year 1805, that heifers one remove from the Bengal breed were
appraised, in event of loss, at �2B each. Australian breeders are not
generally aware that their sleek short-horns count hump-backed Brahmins
among their progenitors. Mr. M?Arthur?s successful introduction of merino
sheep followed, and from these beginnings the industry of the colony took
its distinctive form. Grants of land were freely given by the early
governors, and on these the settlers built their homesteads, and grew what
crops they coidd, but the interest of every man was to get live stock to
feed on the unsold country. Their farms were usually on frontages to
water, and the forests and ridges behind were used for grazing. This


unrestricted use of the grass arose naturally, and indeed in these days there
seemed to he no idea that it could be used otherwise.
One feels astonished, in reading of those times, at the practical wisdom
of the veteran officers, who then combined in their own persons the whole
functions of government. They seem to have arrived intuitively at conclu-
sions which modern colonial parliaments have failed to grasp. They wanted
to see the colonists prosper, and they thought the best help they could
give was to allow them to get land easily, and let each man do the best he
could so long as he did not hurt his neighbours. A freehold grant being
got without cost, the settler could lay out any little capital he had in
buying stock, and for the grazing of the same there was plenty of room.
The wisdom of later times discovered that agriculture and grazing were
two distinct and hostile industries ; that the first was for a man without
capital, and the second only for a man with large capital ; so, rather
strangely, a high price was placed on the land offered to the tiller of the
soil, in very small patches, and whole principalities were leased for grazing,
under the pretext that encouragement was thus given to the investment of
capital. This reformed system in later days produced some unexpected
results. It smothered freehold settlement by abstracting a man?s whole
stock of money to pay for waste land, and it placed the grazier in the
position of a tenant paying rent to town?s people, emigrants, and gold-
diggers, for grass which, if not eaten, would be burned or rot, thus pro-
ducing a huge land revenue to be scrambled for by rival electoral constitu-
encies. The early governors were incapable of constructing a political
fabric of such complexity, but the simple method adopted by them built
up the solid welfare of the community, by combining the industry best
suited to the country with the permanent planting of a population on
the soil.
About the year 1820 a difficulty in disposing of convicts arose, and
this led to an arrangement under which a regular introduction of free
settlers began.
With the modification of the British criminal laws the number of
transported offenders had greatly increased, for hundreds of men that
would have been hanged in the beginning of the century were now sent
to Botany Bay. To meet this growing strain upon the penal establishments
it was determined to form a large class of landholders to whom prisoners
would be assigned as labourers, and to provide for this new class the
defined limits of the settlement were greatly extended. Over a large
extent of country, nearly four hundred by two hundred miles, new home-
steads were planted, and the owners received grants, proportioned in area
to the number of prisoners they took off the hands of the authorities, at
the rate of one hundred acres for every man. The form of occupation
first adopted did not change materially with this great extension of settle-
ment, except that some of the grants were of larger extent, and the live
stock had by this time increased greatly in number.
The country was laid out in these districts in much the same form as
they show now ; and -when the old system, with the attending blight of
forced labour disappeared, there were left, besides the class of employers,
many a family making their way to modest independence by means of the
grants of land which were readily got, the industries carried on by them


being grazing combined with cultivation, and the other occupations which
follow a settled community. There are now to be seen in the country
alluded to the larger freeholds stretching along the valleys and plains, with
their homesteads at various intervals, sometimes three miles apart, some-
times more, and often less, and the frontages to the main roads dotted with
the smaller grants and occasional village townships. This natural plan of
colonisation has been long abandoned in taking up new country, but it has
left behind it the most substantial results of any system'yet tried, if we
take a well-to-do population with property generally distributed, and
yearly growing in value, as affording proof of prosperity.
The authorities of the day seemed to have known perfectly well what
they were doing, and to have anticipated the results of their system, as the
following extract from a pamphlet on emigration, by an official, in the
year 1830, will show:?? The settler?s independence wall arise from his
being able to obtain without money the greater part of these necessaries
which money is elsewhere required to purchase. Whoever is settled on
a farm free of debt, and with a fair proportion of live stock, ought to
consider himself a wealthy man.? This smacks of the true spirit of
Australian progress, but, though it has a strange sound now-a-days, we
can still see in 1874 the ideas thus set forth practically verified. Names
have changed ; neglect and thrift have alike done their part in dispersing
and collecting; properties have been cut up, and farm has been added to
farm, but yet after forty years the country mentioned shows the same
facts, and it has neither fallen into the hands of money-lenders nor become
a nursery of paupers, for the people live in their own houses, and there
are few of them that have not either land or stock. The two schools of
economy naturally differ as to what makes a country well off?the one
pins its faith to large properties, absentee capitalists, no population, but a
dependent labour caste, and large financial operations ; the other school
believes in healthy human life, well-spread tables, and easily-earned
independence, and it would be difficult to find better evidence in favour
of the last theory than in the old settled districts of New South Wales.
?THE SQUATTEES.?
The rapid increase of the live stock now had a telling influence on
events. The defined boundaries of the settled country could no longer
contain the flocks and herds, and they streamed down the western slopes
of the coast range, finding always better pasture. The leaders in this
movement were of the class of free colonists last introduced. Many of
them were educated men of good social standing, but they differed especially
from the free settlers of the former period in the very small deference
they showed to official advice or guidance. The grass was in plenty over
the boundary, and they wanted it and took it ; the authorities might dis-
like those free-and-easy doings, but they could not help that : the wild
blacks might oppose them, so much the worse for the blacks. The fruits
of these pioneers? labours were soon seen in the trains of wool teams that
found their way to the sea-ports, and in droves of fat bullocks sent for
sale. The pioneers in person showed in the settlements at times vigorous,


loud, and confident, and the eyes of the colonists were directed to the rich
western country where lay the secret cause of these wonders. ? Was there
any more good country?? ?Nothing beyond me; all desert; grass
withered to dust ; hot scorching winds.? ? Would it not be well to open
the country to regular settlement?? ?Never do; nothing will grow
westward; no water ; fearful heat; no population could live ; loss of
stock at times fearful,? This was the common report brought in, but
those who could see through it, and persisted in going out, never failed to
find country they could live in, and grass for their stock.
These pioneers were the squatters. They had founded a common-
wealth of their own by right of conquest. With their adopted name they
had established a caste and agreed upon a creed. It was to the effect that
the inland pastures belonged to their body, and that they would keep
them.
These pretensions would in ordinary circumstances have been extin-
guished by their extravagance, and if the old system of settlement had
been steadily applied to the new country, it is likely that the very name
of squatter would have vanished, but the land system of the colony was
being remodelled by direction of the Home Government, and this circum-
stance directly played into the squatters? hands. Instead of the free grants
which were issued at first in the settled districts, land was sold by auction
first at the upset price of 5 s., and afterwards raised to 20s. per acre, and
all choice of locality by the intending settler was barred by a perplexing
survey system. In a few years these arrangements, with abuses which
grew upon them, fairly stopped the further occupation of land in the old
districts, and the portions sold were nearly all bought by speculators to
hold for a profit. Meantime the stock kept increasing and overflowing
into the outside country, and to the troops of free colonists that now
arrived yearly there was no other field left open, unless they could find
occupation in the towns or in the Government service. What followed
was about the last thing that the concoctors of the new policy expected.
The purpose for which the high price of land and the survey arrangements
had been adopted, was to concentrate population, but the result was, that
all the youth, enterprise, and spare resources of the colony were directed
in the new channel which had been opened almost in defiance of the
authorities. Squatting was hardening fast into an institution ; grass claims
were already spoken of as ? properties.? Stock, homesteads, and the
grass were sold to new-comers at so much per head of sheep or cattle.
Whatever the tenure might be worth, no squatter would admit that it was
less than fee-simple. The Government at last had to accept what they
could not help. The occupation was recognised, and a fee of �lO a year
was levied on each ? Pastoral Tenant of the Crown,? which became the
official designation. Their indulgent landlord, the ? Crown,? too glad to
have obtained even a moderate recognition, did not trouble them much,
postponing the question of tenure, and for the time squatterdom made its
own laws and customs. To those new-comers who bought stock and runs,
civility was shown, but to those who came with stock to look for grass, a
black account was always given. If a man would not buy and came too
near, the encroachment being considered intolerable if the smoke from his
camp could be seen within ten miles, they fed off the grass before his face,


and dogged Ills stock from the water-holes ; but he who could laugh at
fables and answer brag with bravado, who shouldered his way through
them and seized upon a run for himself, was sworn in of the brotherhood.
In this way, by 1840, we find New South Wales divided into two
parts ; the oldest occupied according to a plan of freehold settlement that
provided for nineteen-twentieths of the population, and the other held by
a party of adventurers who had founded a system of a wholly opposite
character. Under the one, the colonists aimed at gaining independence
and household plenty, and they looked forward to leaving their homesteads
to their children after them. Under the other, the squatters? only object
was to make a fortune and leave the country. The contrast between the
two systems was as complete as between the farmer of New England and
the white Indigo planters of India. At the same time, the growth of
squatting power and influence was strengthened from that pursuit being
the only remaining outlet for the enterprise of the colony ; while the
progress of the settled districts was completely barred by the adverse
policy which had been adopted in dealing with their lands.
From the rise of squatting to the time of the gold discovery, the life
of the settled districts drops almost out of notice. The abodes and means
of livelihood of most of the colonists still remained on the ground first
settled, and the settlers grew steadily both in numbers and wealth, though
the country they occupied was much poorer than any of the squatting
districts ; but the fresh blood and ready money from the old country
passed them by, and the stir of the outside districts, and the echoes of
commerce and speculation from the ports went over their heads ; still they
lived comfortably, and were steadily finding their way to the establishment
of various rural industries, when the next convulsion brought them into
the thick of the turmoil.
The full power of the squatters was not known until the local Govern-
ment attempted to levy a regular impost upon them in addition to the
original fee. They resented this promptly, and appealed to the Imperial
Parliament with such effect, that they received direct leases for their lands
issued under Orders in Council, and these made them for the time inde-
pendent of all local interference. They had gained a complete victory.
Their lands were their own, so far as they could see, for ever, and they
were hailed as ? shepherd-kings.? Instead of the few thousand acres which
they would have each got under the old system, they had now each actual
titles to tracts of country from 100,000 to 200,000 acres in extent, and
they had now only to get more stock, extend their operations, and procure
plenty of cheap labour, to make themselves the magnates they were called.
With the issue of the leases in 1846 the first squatting dynasty, as we
may say, reached the height of its power, but as yet the edge of the grazing
country only had been entered upon, and the dimensions of the system
were yet to be enormously extended under an influence already at work.
This influence, while it forced on the occupation of country and magnified
commerce, eventually changed the position of the squatters.


FINANCE.
Commerce had found a ready home in Sydney, and there had been
shrewd dealers about the wharves of Port Jackson from the earliest days.
The supply of convicts and troops, the arrival of emigrants, and the up-
country trade, had made the town a thriving place, and it was well
irrigated by the golden shower that followed the rise of squatterdom. The
citizens rubbed their hands with glee when they saw the wool-teams
streaming into the town, and when the return shipping brought more ? new
chums ? with money, and thorough-bred stock, with other novelties, to go
up the country, the whole town rode down to the Circular to see them,
for there were no cabs then, and every man had a horse. Houses which
have since carried on their signatures the fate of regions as large as English
counties, so that the inhabitants could neither kill a bullock nor draw a
cheque without their fiat, were then humbly grateful for an order for ten
gallons of rum or a bale of wool-packs. But the source of this greatness
must be shown. Trade only expanded to its full proportions when Banks
were established. Paper money is said to be an invention fraught with
blessings to mankind ; there can be no doubt, at any rate, that it has
brought wealth to the people of Sydney if it has not actually created it.
The original merchant in Port Jackson may be supposed to have kept his
money in a nail-can planted among barrels of rum, tar, and ships? pork,
the currency being composed of dollars and dumps, which were varieties
of American and Spanish coin, with a few rupees, guineas, and shillings
mixed up. This veteran must have been astonished when he found himself
established in an arm-chair as bank director, and engaged in manufacturing
money as fast as he could put his name to new notes. He soon began to
entertain a higher ambition than the supply of shipping and settlers with
stores. He found that by these bits of paper he could not only extend his
business largely, but he could besides accommodate his customers with
assistance?always with reasonable security ; so that their deeds became
well-known in the bank, and finally settled in his strong-box. The banks
were of course keen to get their paper out, and they speedily hatched into
life a swarm of kite-fliers, all of whom were equipped with advances and
discount accounts, and were started out commissioned to act as jackals to
the financial lion.
The requirements of the squatters, it may be their improvidence coupled
with their want of business knowledge, often caused them to have recourse
to the merchants for temporary assistance, and it is said that negotiations
to the following effect often took place : ?A few hundred pounds would be
wanted till the wool was sold, and there was no trouble about that, ? happy
to be of use to the shepherd kings.? ? Can we do anything else for you 1 by-
the-by there is a flock of sheep to be sold by a neighbour of yours. Have
not you plenty of grass ? why should not you buy the sheep and turn the
grass into wool ? No money ! Csh !we can manage money matters for you.
On what terms ? Oh ! the customary nominal charges. Nothing more?
and the advance you can pay back in wool or fat stock, or, if it suit you, it
may remain upon the property ; we?ll make it easy for you.? The squat-
ter was thus so made of, that he might be pardoned if he did not scrutinise


closely the intentions of his friendly creditor. Before leaving the port,
he was hurriedly asked ?as a mere matter of form to sign some papers??
? What were they ? ? ? Only security in case of accident?we are all mortal,
you know !? That was only fair, so the papers were signed. Now, what
were these documents 1 The first was a promissory-note at six months ibr
the amount due, with addition of interest and a commission of five per cent
for buying the sheep. The second was a mortgage over his stock and all
other stock that might be put on his run, with their increase and produce,
drawn in security for payment of the foregoing note, and of any further
advances and needful charges, and giving to the mortgagee the option of
foreclosure by sale, or entry and possession in the event of any of the
following contingencies?
Non-payment of the pro.-note at due date ;
Loss of stock from disease, droughts, or floods ;
Depreciation of security from any other cause ;
and the third document was a formal transfer as authorised by the Lands
Department of all right and interest in his grazing-run. In making the
bargain, the borrower had really been told that he might have the money
as long as he wanted it, but when it came to black and white the six
months? note appeared. This, however, was got over by saying that it could
be removed as often as was needed. This note, however, proved to be no
mere technical figment, for it was inevitable in the circumstances that it
would become overdue, and then a breach in one of the conditions occurred,
which gave the creditor the power to sell or seize whenever he found it
desirable. The ? usual nominal charges ? came to about fifteen per cent
per annum ; seventeen was common a few years ago, and the debt grew fast,
because the account was made up with compound interest every half-year.
At this ratio of accumulation, and under the above conditions, it is easy to
see that good luck alone could steer him clear of ruin. He had come do\m
the country a free man with very fair prospects before him. He went
back having parted with his personal liberty and all his possessions.
Generally in two or three years reasons cogent for closing the account
appeared?the state of the money-market, the seasons, or ominous political
portents ; any pretext would do. The property then passed to a buyer,
whose chance of safety depended in an exceptional rise of prices ; if this
did not take place he made way for a third, who paid in his money and
worked like a convict with the same prospect ; and at last the station
became the absolute property of the Sydney firm. That men should be
ready to commit themselves by the signing of such deeds may well create
astonishment, but people are generally wise only after the event, and these
affairs took some careful nursing before they culminated. But there is
matter for more surprise yet. The people who made the advance and to
whom the securities were given had no money whatever to lend, and the
thing was carried through by pawning the documents to the bank. So
the chief reason for admiration is that young commercial men who as Bank
clerks and book-keepers had learned how to manipulate paper currency,
but who in the way of capital possessed nothing more than an ink-bottle,
actually succeeded in working substantial property into their hands with-
out giving any consideration whatever. This tour-de-force has been played


five hundred times if it has been played once, and many station-properties
have been juggled about in this way half-a-dozen times, leaving a good
slice of profit each time in the hands of the financiers, but with apparent
loss, for the claims as made up always enormously exceed the actual disburse-
ments.
This character, then, marked the second squatting period, the working
of stations under advance. During this time many properties passed direct
into the hands of merchants and money-lending companies ; many more
got into debt and were working in the hope of a reversion ; and some still
remained in the hands of the original owners, or belonged to buyers whom
a rise in prices had cleared of their liabilities.
An immense extension of squatting has since taken place under this
system of advance. Pioneers who have runs and a little stock have great
facilities put in their way for getting more stock, and the properties thus
formed almost invariably pass in a few years to the banks and money-
lenders, and the original owners are turned adrift. There is a general
belief in the colonies that this is the proper and natural order of things,
and it has become a settled creed that to the banks the colonies are
indebted for all their natural progress and prosperity. This, though a
common notion, is simply idiotic, and it is only worth noting as a proof of
the reverential fear felt for the money power by the colonists. It must be
remembered that capital makes neither grass grow nor stock increase, so
that all that bank advances can do, in addition to what would take place
without them, is to pay the exceptional cost of moving live stock from one
run to another ; and even in this operation there is little actual outlay,
because with sheep the growth of the fleece will pay the cost of travelling.
The action of the banks may at times stimulate speculation and raise
prices, but they in no way do any of the work of settlement that would
not be done without them, much better, more economically, and more
beneficially for the public interest.
It must be kept in mind that squatting itself, of which the advance
system is only an excrescence, exists merely as an accident, and as such
occupies the ground that would otherwise certainly be covered by a much
sounder system, more susceptible of economical management, more firmly
founded on, the general distribution of property, and less at the mercy of
the money-lender. The proofs of this are not difficult to get, and can be
furnished by contrasting the history and results of two different grazing
properties, for which the particulars are at hand. One is a freehold estate
in the settled districts formed out of old grants before squatting began, and
it contains an area of about twelve thousand acres divided into some twelve
or fifteen paddocks. This property has not been worked under advance ;
in fact it was probably formed when there were no banks in the country, and
it has been made what it is by the personal application of the owner. It
consists of poor country, but being systematically improved, its capability
increases yearly. From this cause and the increment of value from
general progress which this property shares with the rest of the district, it
is worth now four times as much as it was fifteen years ago. The paddocks
alone without the stock in the homestead would let for �lOOO a-year.
The other property is a squattage so much richer in natural pasture
that one acre is worth two of the first, and the area is twenty times as


great, namely, 240,000 acres. The result of fifteen years? occupation of
this run under the advance system was that, after selling off large quantities
of fat stock for years, the debt was barely kept down, and it was only
through a lucky sale that the owner got a reversion out of it barely enough
to live upon. It may be worth noting, too, that the house on the freehold
is good stone and brick ; on the squattage the residence is barely as good
as the mortgagee?s fowl-house.
The contrast of the two systems will be still more clearly shown by
extending the comparison to the district in which the first property is
situated. The area of this is just four times the size of the squattage
above referred to, and it contains about twenty freeholds of the same class
as the one described, and some hundreds of smaller homesteads, with a
rural and village population of about 2000. The population of four
stations would vary according to circumstances from six or seven persons to
100 each, so the squatting population of the corresponding area could not
be placed at a higher average than 120 ?mostly servants on wages. These
facts afford the most perfect illustration of what can be done by freehold
settlement without banks, and what the result of squatting settlement is,
supported by large advances of capital.
BEGINNING OF THE QUARREL.
The quarrel between the squatting interest and the public was now
commencing, but it was still in its infancy. The original grudge appeared
to be founded on jealousy at the ease with which the squatters secured
large tracts of country, as contrasted with the obstacles raised to the
possession of small freeholds. A written form handed into a government
office, accompanied with the payment of a small sum as rent, secured to
the squatting applicant a piece of grazing country as large as a Highland
parish, while the resident in one of the old districts, who wanted a home-
stead to build on, or a farm of one or two hundred acres, had to go through
a course of importunity, servility, delay, and uncertainty, akin to the
method of the circumlocution office. After months? waiting the answer
often was, that ? His Excellency the Governor had decided not to offer for
sale the land applied for.? If the official approval was conceded, and the
survey thereon made, the ground was often cut up in a way that defeated
the object of the applicant, and if fairly put to auction at last, the honest
buyer was at the mercy of a ring of land-jobbers. The squatting men
heartily approved of this method, because, they frankly said, they wanted
plenty of labour, and to give people land was to make labour scarce.
? The country can be prosperous only with cheap labour, and we are the
country ; ? this was their text. Accordingly, they used their influence to
introduce coolie labour, and thus squatterdom assumed more and more the
character of a plantation system, and the squatter began to act, to the life,
the role of the planter. But, like other plantation systems, there was a
shadow over it. The owners had extended their possessions and were
trying to introduce a class of serfs, thereby adding greatly to their unpopu-
larity ; there were longer trains of wool-teams than ever ; larger droves of
cattle on the road, but a new depressing element had appeared in the


atmosphere of the pastoral districts ; and somehow there was more care
and less jollity. A letter or a visit to Sydney seemed now to be necessary
before any ordinary business could be transacted, and at last it began to be
doubted among those who could watch the relations between the squatter
and his agent, to which pertained the substance, to which the shadow. But
this half-veiled commercial influence in no way mitigated, in fact greatly
increased, the growing dislike to the squatters, for under its pressure all
relations received a stricter business interpretation, labour became consi-
dered as a commodity merely to be got cheap and made the most of, and
the grasp on the lands tightened. A squatter out of debt could allow
indulgences to people which he could not yield under mortgage. If the
pastoral tenant in his own right was sometimes hard to deal with, as the
money-lenders? bailiff he was a great deal harder.
Still with all that could be brought against the squatting system, there
was for long to be said in its favour, that it was a shape in which the
legitimate industry of the country had free scope, and that it opened a
career to all the enterprise and an investment to all the capital either
amassed in the colony or imported from the mother country.
Under certain conditions the system w T as, no doubt, unsound, but still
there was the field open to any one.
This was quite true, and for many a day, even after the issue of the
leases and the growth of the commercial power, any man with a flock of
sheep or a few cattle might go outside and take up a run. But this public
advantage, if it did not disappear altogether, became greatly curtailed by
abuses which attended the administration of the unoccupied lands.
OFFICIAL.
In those days public business was conducted with much official mystery
and secrecy, and the functions of government were understood as having
nothing in common with the wants and wishes of people outside.
Of course there were back-stairs open to friends, and private intimacies
flourished all the more that access was allowed only to a set. The
management of the Crown lands was vested in a staff of commissioners,
and in the chief all power and patronage centred. All reports, documents,
and maps, were safely stored in his office, and the well-understood official
rule was to keep the public out. The country was divided into districts, each
of these being under a subordinate officer. These functionaries were
poorly paid, and that was disadvantageous to the public interest, for in the
course of their duties they could not but acquire considerable knowledge
of the unoccupied country. A run was secured simply by filling up a form,
and transmitting it, with a small remittance, to Sydney, and the document
was, after registration, forwarded to the district commissioner for report.
If the report was favourable?and this was left entirely to official discretion
?the country, whatever the area might be, so long as it was not less than
16,000 acres, became the property of the applicant for fourteen years, and
in some districts with right of renewal for a shorter term. The power in
the hands of these officers was therefore very great, and by capable honour-
able men it was often used beneficially for the country. Then, young


men beginning with a small stock were sometimes shown a piece of vacant
country by the commissioners, and they often acted, as was to be expected,
so as to promote the public interest and at the same time conciliate the
community in which they lived. But all commissioners were not of the
same stamp, and not a few of them were believed to trade upon their
knowledge of the country.
The filling up of a form that, when passed officially, became worth
ready money, was an easy way to satisfy a claim, or to ameliorate a life of
pinched economy, entailed by the struggle to support from a narrow income
the status of a high appointment. Sometimes this power was used almost
openly, and few comments were made, as when a public officer u sub rosa ?
took a partner with stock and supplied him with a run. At other times,
the transaction is said to have taken a coarser and more direct form, and
entailed severe consequences if not well masked, but the trail was almost
always effectually rubbed out. Under like pressure, the plans and descrip-
tions in the head office were supposed to come confidentially at times under
the eyes of those who had friends there, and the information thus procured
enabled them to fill up forms of application. Consequently, by-and-by,
he who went out to look for a run often found that he was anticipated ;
the river he came upon was already secured by the tenders of a Sydney
wine-merchant, the salt-bush plain by a well-known bill-discounter, and
the limestone-downs by an unknown man who turned out to be alter-ego
for the commissioner.
So, after all, the easiest way to get a run was to go to Sydney and
buy from those who had ? tendered by the map.?
The practical work of colonisation in Australia was now thoroughly
changed in its tendency. It had completely drifted away from the original
freehold system ; no one thought now of living in and improving the
country. To get a large slice of land by a trick, and to overreach some
new-comer in a sale, were the methods by which colonists gained considera-
tion and respect.
Of course wealth and population increased, though the distribution of
both was taking a new direction ; the inland country had become hardly
more than a field for speculation, and nearly all profits seemed to go to the
capital.
It was a one-sided growth, and the squatting interest was fast taking
the shape of mere stock-jobbing.
THE GOLD DISCOVERY?ITS EFFECTS ON SETTLEMENT.
The gold discovery in its bearing on settlement should now be
considered. This event ranked in importance with the introduction of
sheep nearly fifty years before.
It caused a revolution in industry and social life, and trebled the
population and income of Australia in a few years.
But, as the distribution of the gold over the colonies was not equal,
the results were, to a large extent, local. This was more especially shown
in the rapid growth of the great colony of Victoria. The district of Port
Philip had been an off-shoot and dependency of New South Wales, but


about the same time as the discovery took place it was erected into a
separate colony. The richest mines were found within this territory,
producing a value of about ten millions sterling annually, being nine-tenths
of all the gold produced in Australia, and this fact placed the conditions
of colonisation in Victoria on a different footing. Instead of acting merely
as a stimulus, which was the effect elsewhere, in Victoria the gold was
like a flood, it carried all before it, and made a second California at once.
Land became valuable, and was worth taking up on any terms, squat-
ting profits were trebled, and all industry and business was correspondingly
remunerated. Even after twenty years an acre of land within three
hundred miles of Melbourne is worth three acres anywhere else in
Australia, and the chances of success in all undertakings are in the same
proportion. For this reason, in treating questions connected with the
colonisation of Australia, the case of Victoria being exceptional should be
considered separately, while the old colony may fairly be taken as repre-
sentative of the whole group.
New South Wales, from the produce of her own gold-fields, and in
direct participation in the wealth of Victoria, through trade and other
connections, received yearly large sums of money, which were thrown
among her population. More expensive habits of living, chiefly shown in
the increased use of imported merchandise, absorbed much of this, but
there was a yearly growing surplus which there were few opportunities to
lay out to any purpose. A man might occasionally buy a small plot of
ground at one of those nonsensical auction sales which were still continued,
and he might build his house upon it, but, beyond getting a roof over his
family, the outlay was usually unproductive, for there w 7 as no way known
of farming on a small scale. Stores and public-houses sprang up every-
where ; it seemed as if every man who had saved a few ounces of gold
took to one or the other. Investments being so difficult to get, the earn-
ings of the community went into the banks, and since then the tendency
to accumulation has been going on. An explosion of speculation has
periodically given relief by wasting large sums, but money follows the
rule of gravitating to the capital, and stagnating in the banks often at a
low rate of interest. For the last two years the banks in Scotland have
been paying a higher rate on deposits than the banks in Australia. This
seems strange in a country so extensive and possessing such resources, but
the cause is to be found in the restrictions which hamper settlement. The
banks must lay out their money, and they have little choice in the method,
as commercial business is limited by the extent of the market. Squatting
is the only industry which can absorb large sums, and the wool and tallow
are always marketable as exports. These, along with the large markets
for fat stock, provided by the gold-fields and chief towns, combine to give
a fixed value to this kind of property. The bank deposits are therefore
laid out in station advances through mercantile houses, and there is neces-
sarily a constant trade in buying and selling stations going through their
hands, from the peculiar manner in which these advances are worked.
Capitalists for the same reason are compelled to buy stations ; if they did
not they could get no other investment in the colonies. A glut of deposits
lowers interest, and inevitably leads to speculation ; purchases at high
prices are always followed by heavy advances, which extend and tighten


the hold of the hanks ; and in its turn the inevitable reaction sets in,
straining every resource, and throwing every saleable property into the
market, to the ruin of hundreds of people. The banks may profess to
restrain these excesses, but they are bound to support the merchants and
bill-discounters who work for them, and it is rare that both do not in the
end carry out profit, between the ready money of the buyers, and the
securities which, in their turn, are realised on the first opportunity. Specu-
lators thus, from this continual fluctuation, pluck fortunes at every turn
of the wheel, and the system is no doubt a good one for financiers and
agents, but it offers a perilous chance for honest industry, and is a wretched
foundation for the prosperity of a country.
If freehold settlement, with its resident population, and various indus-
tries, had been extended there would have grown an equipoise of interests,
and a share of the gold would have been used for different purposes than
carrying on this gambling between banks and squatters. As it was, the
old settled districts benefited by the discovery, but there were not oppor-
tunities given to the people to lay out their increased earnings for years,
and indeed even to this day the want has been but imperfectly supplied.
So, as the general result, Sydney has been enormously enriched ;
the produce of the mines is poured into her banks, and the inland
pastures have become pawn pledges tossed from hand to hand in her
Exchange.
The state of New Soiith Wales had thus become very different from
the ideal that had attracted most of the colonists. They had hoped to live
by their flocks and herds, and by the produce of the soil, and to leave
substantial comfort to those coming after them ; and of this primitive
condition examples were still to be seen in the old districts ; but under
the commercial regime which had been established there was no opening,
it appeared, to the soil of this huge continent, except through the office of
a merchant in a bank. The whole community seemed entangled in a web
of chicanery ; nearly all property seemed either in pawn or in a state of
transition ; when prices rose fortunes were made by men who immediately
left the colony ; when they fell ruin became widespread, and the money-
changer was the universal creditor and prospective proprietor.
FREE SELECTION.
The quarrel between the squatters and the public had been growing in
intensity for many years, for as the population increased in number, the
obstacles to the possession of land became more keenly felt. A collision
in 1861 took place in the legislature of New South Wales, in which, after
a severe contest, the squatting party sustained a defeat, but the champions
of the popular cause were better hands at destruction than reform, and
the victory produced results of a very mixed character.
After the views on the subject of colonisation which are formed fi;om
actual knowledge of Australia, it is difficult to follow the ideas which
guided the Assembly of New South Wales in constructing the new system
which they adopted.
This body seems to have entirely ignored, in its proceedings, the past


history of the colony, hnt very likely few of the members had any know-
ledge on the subject. The old settled districts were there, showing what
had been done before under a freehold system. In the worst country in
the colony, a population at least twenty times as dense as was to he found
in the best of the squatting districts, was living comfortably, and the
system would have spread to other regions if it had been allowed. No
doubt the method under which they occupied the lands was not a perfect
one ; it was not fixed by rule or square, and showed a good deal of
caprice in distribution ; but still certain significant facts were there, the
consideration of which should not have been neglected. Any despotic
government in Europe, or any Indian commissioner who had dealt with
native village settlements, would certainly have looked for this kind of
evidence, and before originating a new freehold law, would have inquired
whether other similar laws had been in operation, and how they had
worked. But it seems as if the popular legislators took most of their
notions on the subject from the popular press. Town-bred men can
hardly understand country questions, and country-folks, whether English
or colonial, are the worst of all hands either at telling what they know,
or at framing principles from their experience. Thus it happened that
the men who had to lay down theories knew nothing about facts ; while
the practical men abominated theories, and confined their interest in
public business to such matters of fact as blocking out some troublesome
neighbour, or getting a road brought past a certain gate.
So the theory of the new system evolved itself from editorial con-
sciousness, prompted by views gathered more from hearsay and reading
than from actual knowledge. Their line of thought took a direction some-
thing like the following, ? The chief fact to he dealt with was the
squatting monopoly. It covered three-fourths of the territory, and was
interwoven with all the vested interests and wealth of Sydney. The
coalition of the Crown tenants and the money power cast in the shadow
all other interests, both the small freeholders, the towns-people, and the
gold-miners, leaving nine-tenths of the colonists out in the cold. The
keystone of this pile, raised by selfishness and arrogance, was the land-
law, so squatting must come down.? This feeling showed itself on the
very first opportunity. The colonists got full control of their internal
affairs in the year 1857, and one of the first acts of the assembly was to
treble the rent levied on the squatters. This was really a violation of the
terms of lease on which the Crown lands were held, but an evasion covered
the injustice. The additional impost was not called rent: it was called
assessment. Further encroachment was postponed until the expiry of the
leases, and this was thought to be a sufficient sacrifice to legality. When
that time came there was to be an end of squatting. In the meantime, a
policy of reconstruction must be prepared, for the settlement of the lands
must be according to rule. Questions of land-tenure had not been dis-
cussed then as they have been since, and few of the towns-people had
means of knowing how land was .occupied elsewhere. Probably recollec-
tions of English suburbs opening into endless cultivation, miles of house
and field, provided their principal experience of rural fact, and it may be
supposed that faint echoes of old times, such as are recalled in Goldsmith?s
? Deserted Village,?

?When every rood of land maintained its man,?
hinted at a possible state of things the very antipodes of sqnatterdom.
Naturally from such ideas arose the inference that the only right use of
the land was for the plough, so grazing must give way to agriculture, and
five hundred yeomen would displace each squatter. If statistics had been
as complete and as easy of reference fifteen years ago as now, further
light might have been thrown on this subject: take, for example, the
following extract from the ? Agricultural Statistics of Great Britain.?
Arable Land in Crop, T1 Pasture Waste Land or
or under Rotation. lmproN ed i asture ' Natural Pasture.
To put it plainly, in England, for every ten acres of arable land,
there are ten acres of improved pasture and ten acres of waste land or
natural pasture: In Scotland, for every two acres of arable, there are two
acres of improved pasture and fifteen acres of natural pasture: Taking
Great Britain in the aggregate, for every acre under the plough, we have
one acre of improved grass and two acres of waste land or natural pasture.
But such records not being accessible, the theory propounded that as
all old countries were covered with cultivation and building, therefore
occupation for the purpose of agriculture was the only permanent tenure
that the State could recognise. It must be recollected that by ?agriculture?
was meant simply arable farming or tillage. Now, fully admitting that
the land of Great Britain is artificially kept back from use up to its full
capability, still the figures above would have been sufficient to show the
absurdity of attempting to treat the stony, arid, and unpeopled wastes of
Australia in a manner which was not attempted in a populous country
with markets at short distances and communication easy. To make the
country into a chess-board of small arable freeholds was then the principle
of re-construction with which the popular party intended to displace the
squatters. But when discussion by the legislators began, many new aspects
of the question appeared. The country was so enormous. What was to be
done with it till the new class of farmers took it up ? Besides, the squatters
were paying to the Treasury a land revenue of over one hundred thousand
pounds yearly. The old tenure must be cancelled, of course, and a squatter
must be shifted whenever any one of the new order wanted his land, but
the stock of the squatters would continue to eat the grass belonging to the
people, and though the tenure was cancelled, the rent must not be lost ;in
fact, it must be re-appraised and raised to something like a fair considera-
tion for the use of the ? pastoral estate ? belonging to the electors of the
colony. A squatter might be dispossessed by any one who chose, but he
must pay for each season?s grass till he was hunted off. But this was not
all. The Assembly was quite willing to deviate from the ? arable ? theory
when they saw a chance of getting more revenue for their constituents, and
of giving the squatters another squeeze. It was thrown out by some up-
country members that a farm was not of much use without a bit of rim


for stock attacked to it, so each buyer of laud was allowed to lease three
times the area of his purchase in grazing laud adjoining. So it turned
out that it did not matter much by whom the grass was used, so long as
the squatter was made to pay for it, though he might consider himself
entitled to some consideration on the score of his tenancy. He would get
justice, in so far, that at the end of five years his run would be re-appraised,
and an abatement in the future rent proportioned to the pasturage taken
from him would he made.
At the same time the new buyer or selector, as he w r as called, was
debarred from buying any portion of his grazing lease, though the same
was open to anybody else. It was in fact a small run cut out of the larger
run, and liable to similar encroachment. The great principles of the law
were that the squatter must give way to every one, and that nobody was
to get the chance to buy more land than three hundred and twenty acres.
So the position was this?A was the squatter who had bought the
run from a Sydney firm at a high price, or perhaps had gone through all
the risks of pioneering in the early days ; he had made it his home and
had lived upon the ground for ten or perhaps twenty years ; most likely he
was under advance, and was hoping to get out of it some day with seven
or eight thousand pounds, perhaps about double the capital he began with.
He kept his stock upon this run and was made to pay a rent which was
re-appraised every five years. Meantime BCD and E could each take
320 acres freehold and 960 acres leasehold from any part of A?s run
they chose, cutting across his paddock, fence, or on his cattle camp ; but
again F G H and I could enter upon the leaseholds of B C D and E, and
cut them up in the same way that they entered upon A.
But even this did not exhaust the possibilities of muddle, and it is fair
to admit that the Assembly did not check in its pace till that point was
reached. An auction clause was introduced, under which Crown lands,
whether leased or not, might be put up to competition at the upset price
of �1 per acre. Also, a power of making reserves was entrusted to the
Executive Government. With these and other clauses, both akin and
conflictory, above all with a survey-service working without any connection
of plan and generally behind in dutjq the land-system of New South
Wales may be compared to a kaleidescope, for the brain grows giddy in
trying to trace its involutions. Under the auction clause, of course, A
could walk into his adversaries and retaliate upon BCD and E and the
others, and the working of the reserves beneficially was best secured by
good conduct at election time. So it was thought that the squatters were
pretty well muzzled. They could be shunted off by anybody ; they had
nevertheless to pay for leave to use the grass, and if they wanted to save
any country from selection, they had to be very civil to the authorities.
But squatting was by these means far from extinguished. Following
a law which has never failed to operate, under every pressure applied to
it, whether financial or legislative, each new disaster has given the interest
more and more the character of a-monopoly for capitalists, and has made
it the more powerful and determined in opposing the settlement of the
country. Each of these events has had the effect of lumping two or three
squattages into one station. In this way they are managed at less cost,
and neither money nor influence is spared to extinguish competing rights


At the same time, numbers of families lose their homes, and the country-
population is reduced to a small staff of overseers and boundary-riders under
absentee masters. This, then, followed the selection law, fewer squatters, but
larger stations than ever, and the money power resolute and unscrupulous
to get the freehold of the lands through the law or in spite of the law.
FURTHER RESULTS OF THE SELECTION LAW.
The new measure was framed mainly to carry into effect a vindictive
policy towards the squatters. In this aim it was partly successful, but it
was yet to be seen whether the results anticipated in extended settlement
would follow. In one respect it must be admitted that the consequences
were good. A crying want was satisfied. For about twenty years the
country population had been confined to the original grants. With plenty
of waste land around, new homesteads could, during that time, hardly be
got. Now, any man could get enough land at a small cost to build his
hut upon, plant a vegetable garden, and keep a few cows. The labouring
men who lived by contract work, such as fencers, shearers, road-makers,
and miners, were made a comfortable well-to-do class by this measure.
They needed no longer to live in townships, or hang about public-houses
looking for jobs. In providing homes for working men, and little properties
on which they could lay out their earnings, the Act deserves every credit.
It was giving the same start to the men of the present day, that had set
on their legs two-thirds of the wealthy freehold settlers. But still this
was not founding a self-supporting colonisation ; it was simply giving an
important help to a class that lived mainly on wages.
With the class that aimed at carrying out farming as an occupation
the results were different. It is wonderful with what enthusiasm and
confidence numbers of people took up farms under this law for the purpose
of tilling the soil, without any experience of the country and climate, and
quite heedless of the fact that there was already in the settled districts a
large class of freeholders who had as yet failed to establish any system of
arable farming such as they aimed at. From the head of the Shoalhaven,
to the head of the Hunter River, the country on the coast was dotted with
freeholds, many of which had been held for fifty years, and inland scattered
over the slopes of the great barrier range, were Bathurst, Wellington, Yass,
Goulburn, and other settlements, around which were to be seen hundreds
of freeholds of all sizes from forty acres to two thousand and upwards.
By asking how this old class of settlers lived, they would have learned
that almost universally grazing was their mainstay, and tillage came after-
wards only as a secondary industry. Crops were uncertain according to
any method of farming yet known, and, besides, it happened that when
good harvests came prices went down, and produce became unsaleable.
They would have heard that one year there was no crop, and wheat was
at nine shillings a bushel; the next year it went to two shillings, and the
third it was so plentiful, that people turned their sheep among the uncut
grain. All, in fact, lived mainly by the grass ; the larger settlers grazing
their stock on pre-emptive leases attached to their holdings, and the


smaller on public reserves and on poorer ridges not suitable for stock on a
larger scale.
However, it was only after much labour and serious loss that the same
experience was acquired by the selectors, and then their industry began to
take the same form as that of the old settlers. Though the squatters had
from the first disliked the prospect of encroachment on their runs, still the
fear of agricultural settlement did not affect them much. They knew that
men could hardly live by the plough alone, and they looked forward to
the selectors being glad to give up their farms for a few pounds after
some years of toil and disappointment. In a measure their expectations
were confirmed, but they did not foresee ultimate consequences, or they
would have felt some alarm.
Under the first operation of the Act, the intrusion of the selectors on
runs was more pernicious from the unlimited choice of locality which the
law gave them, and from abuses that grew out of that, than from the
quantity of land actually taken. It was supposed that good soil, an
adjacent market, or access to roads or navigable water, would always
determine their choice of ground for farms, but it turned out that the
selectors wanted the spots which the squatters valued most. For one
selector who could or would use his judgment in picking a place for him-
self out of the unimproved or unoccupied country, there were ten who
could see no good land except about the enclosures of the squatters, on the
cattle-camps where their herds had been mustered for years, or on the
water-holes which had been used for lambing their flocks since the station
was formed, and the use of which had become necessary in the annual
routine of work. From this it became plain to selectors that, whether
farming would pay or not, they could always bring a pressure to bear
which could be turned into coin, and it became common to take up a
selection in order to be bought out.
Against this action, the squatter could protect himself only by ceaseless
vigilance. And he had to use the various devices which the law itself, or
chance loopholes, placed within his reach. If he could make his ? vote ?
felt, he got reserves made which kept back certain areas from selection.
If he had a strong purse, he took advantage of a clause which enabled him
to secure improved land at a cost of �2 per acre, and another safeguard
was sought in the law itself, or rather in its perversion. The Act when
before the Assembly had been mangled and patched up, and, consequently,
when passed, some of its most important provisions were vaguely expressed.
One point, variously interpreted, was whether a ? person ? qualified to select
meant a man of legal age only ; or whether women and children were not
also included in the term. The meaning originally intended could not be
doubtful, from the wording of a declaration which the selector had to
execute before he could get a full title to his land. This declaration was
to the effect that the selector had lived continuously for three years on
the land. Now, it was quite certain that single females and children
could not make their homes on -separate farms. Notwithstanding this,
selections were made by squatters for children, dependents, and sometimes
in names believed to be fictitious, and declarations were signed by the
dozen without any residence whatever. Sometimes a conscientious squatter
would set up a hut or a tent on his selections ; and send a man to sleep in


them every month for a night or two, hut more frequently the declaration
was bolted without salt. The rights of property were far too sacred to be
prejudiced by any whimsical nicety as to perjury. The selectors did pre-
cisely the same. Whole families, down to the infant in arms, had separate
selections taken in their names, and in each case the head of the family
signed the declaration that each person or infant had resided for the
prescribed time on his or her farm. Moreover, the selectors backed each
other in a way their opponents could not vie with. An instance of
this kind happened some years ago, which became public. From
some unusual cause, most likely an election squabble, complaint was
made to the Lands Department that in a certain case the conditions of
residence and improvement on a selection had not been fulfilled, and a
local official was instructed to call upon the selector for proof. He had
handed to him without delay the statutory declaration duly signed, and
backed by an affidavit bearing the signatures of nine neighbours, stating
that there was. a substantial building on the ground in question, and that
the declarant had lived in it for three years. In ordinary circumstances
the matter at this point would have been let drop, for the customary
executive action does not see that the law is carried out; it merely requires
that the printed forms should be signed ; but there was likely some strong
parliamentary influence at work, for an officer was sent from headquarters
to look and satisfy himself as to the facts. He found no building whatever,
and ascertained that no person whatever had ever lived upon the ground.
After this there was some talk of a prosecution for perjury, but, as juries
in that quarter are largely made up of the ? selector ? element, it was
certain from past experience that the verdict would be acquittal, so there
was no more about it.
The other evils of Australia are paltry beside this reckless tampering
with truth. It pervades all classes, and there is no doubt whatever that
the vice has been enormously increased by the manner in which the land-
laws are administered. No section of the community is in this a bit better
than another ; in the clubs of Sydney there is heard among squatting men
the one current phrase, used as a harmless pleasantry, ? there?s no perjury
under the land-law while among the bush men of the hack country any
man who jibed at a false oath to back his mate would be hooted as a
traitor.?One colony is about as bad as another. In Queensland, a declara-
tion is required to the effect that the applicant is a resident in that colony.
A merchant living in Melbourne offered to make this declaration without
scruple. ? It?s only like a custom-house oath,? was his remark.
But in New South Wales these evils became tenfold, and the strife
became inveterate when the selectors came to see that the chief value of
their holdings consisted in the grazing rights attached, and they began to
put live stock upon them.
The squatters then saw for the first time that a new grazing interest
had been intruded on them in disguise, and they were caught at great dis-
advantage, for they had begun to improve their method of stock manage-
ment, and had set up hundreds of miles of timber and wire fencing.
The squatters drove flocks of sheep over the selectors? leased runs to
destroy their grass : the selectors retaliated by buying up fenced land or
tearing down fences, and impounding stock ; one party appealed to the


Land Office ; another to the Supreme Court, and sometimes the Minister
for Lands said one thing and the Judges another. The authorities, in
fact, tell them to fight it out. As yet neither Government nor Parlia-
ment has tried to stop further mischief by amending the law, and indeed
this is not to be expected, as Sydney interests thrive on lawsuits and official
muddles, and the power of centralisation is increased with every fresh
complication.
An improvement in the land-laws will not be made easily, and it is
safe to predict that any attempt of the kind will be futile that does not
include de-centralisation in its scheme. The large squatting rental, now
nearly a quarter of a million, poured into the central Treasury, together
with the immense income and expenditure arising from station property
owned or under lien in Sydney, bring a number of diverse interests into
one focus ; all being fed by the present use of the squatting runs. Though
unsympathetic to each other, their interests unconsciously tend in the same
direction. The love of predominance among the electors of the capital
will never willingly slacken their grasp of such a rental from what they
call ? their public estate.?
The monied interest, again, would much rather have the departments
of Government within reach of their offices and banks ; and the official
tribe, with its huge staff of dependents, would resist any division of
authority. People at the seat of Government, from these concurring motives,
are getting more and more to look upon the interior as property to be
devoted to their direct behoof, and there is little doubt that, with the
adoption of local administration, one-half of these benefits would be taken
away from Sydney, A corresponding advantage to each dismembered
district would certainly follow, as colonial history can show by repeated
examples ; and moreover with each community dealing with its own lands
and managing its own revenue, the value of a resident population would
be more thought of than vested interests founded on foreclosure ; while
with officers appointed by authority a closer supervision could be exercised,
and much abuse, confusion, and delay in public business averted. But
any attempt at reform will be a farce which does not sweep away at
once and for ever the system of written declarations as a public nuisance ;
and in place of these, responsible officers should be bound to satisfy them-
selves by personal examination of all matters requiring proof ; when neces-
sary, an oral declaration in court might be called for. This might be made
most effective. Thousands of men will sign a false declaration without
turning a hair ; hundreds will kiss the book in attestation of a falsehood
with little scruple ; but few will venture to perjure themselves if they are
called upon to repeat aloud the terrible formula observed in the Law-Courts
of Scotland,


THE SQUATTERS AND SELECTORS, THEIR
CLAIMS AND RIGHTS.
The waste of power caused by the internecine strife between the two
classes has been very great; if the same energy had been applied to
honest work for the common good, a magnificent result would have
followed ; as it is, both sides exhaust their means in perpetuating the con-
test. The squatters claimed at first a perpetual right of renewing their
leases, a sort of copyhold, or, as they called it, fixity of tenure. They
loudly maintained that the lands could be used for nothing but grazing.
Their opponents, if they had been well up in the subject, might have
retorted that, granting the fact to be so, still it was much better for the
State to have twenty sheep-farmers on a run than one squatter. But, as
we have seen, the theory of land-reform adopted was based on the establish-
ment of agriculture, or, more strictly, tillage ; not on grazing constituted
in the form of an open popular industry. This claim for fixity of tenure
was, in the face of it, ridiculous. Why should a squatter have the per-
petual tenancy of 100,000 acres, when 3000 to 4000 acres made a good
property in the settled districts. The mortgagees, who formed a strong
element in the Upper House of Legislature, claimed large consideration for
capital invested, pioneering labours, and so on. This was twaddle. The
capital on which they grounded their claims consisted mainly in the
increment of fifteen per cent per annum charged on transactions of which
disbursement of money formed but a small part ; a mere kernel of advance
in the midst of a huge accretion of charges ; and in settling accounts with
their customers, they never recognised pioneering services.
The pioneer squatters? risks, expenses, and liability to debt, are mainly
owing to the system of large holdings, and the great distances at which
stations are taken up apart, often twenty to forty miles. Under a different
system, new country would have been occupied to much greater advantage,
as was the case in the early days of the colony. The old districts were
occupied at first with homesteads within two and three miles of each other,
and there is no doubt that this method would have extended all over the
squatting country if it had been allowed.
So if squatters, or those who have stepped into their shoes by fore-
closure, claim compensation for pioneering, squatting must at the same
time be charged with preventing a much sounder, more economical, and
more beneficial form of settlement.
Yielding perforce to the pressure of the reform party, the squatters?
second demand took the shape of an assumed sequence. It was that, until
their runs were wanted for the plough, their tenure should remain intact.
The public mind, being misty on the subject, failed to distinguish
between what they called agriculture and the real essential question of
freehold settlement founded on general rural industries, and the corollary
put forward by the squatters was commonly assented to ; not that a literal
pledge to the purpose was ever given by any authority, but the language
of the press and of politicians seemed to show that the question was con-
sidered settled on that footing ; and so the new tenure was interpreted.


The granting of grazing leases, or pre-leases as they were called, as
adjuncts to agricultural farms, may be construed as at variance with this
view, but the Act was avowedly passed as an agricultural measure.
This second form of the claim is, in equity and common sense, as
invalid as the first. A farm without proportional pasture has proved in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred to be worthless, so to concede the
squatting tenure on this footing would be to tie up nine-tenths of the
country for ever.
But the common acceptance of the idea that runs could be encroached
on only by agricultural selectors, has without doubt led many people to
buy stations who would have held back if they had anticipated the
growth of a competing grazing interest, and this fact ought in fairness to
be placed as an item to the credit of the squatters when the system comes
to be finally dealt with.
Now the substantial claims which the squatters can justly make upon
the State are these ;
They have been not only assessed for occupying the waste lands, but
the amount of the impost was trebled by an authority different from that
which granted these leases.
The first levy recognised them as Crown tenants, and as such they were
entitled to reasonable treatment in carrying on their occupation ; to due
notice before intrusion, and to such compensation as is customary in
private dealings between landlord and tenant. The second levy was of
doubtful legality, and it was certainly harsh and arbitrary in its action.
This fact must give them a special claim on the State so long as reason
and justice are to be observed in public dealings.
The valid grounds of the squatters? claims were therefore much within
the limits of their demands, and justice might have been done without
either giving them all their runs for ever, as they wanted, or subjecting
them to general spoliation, as the selection law prompted and encouraged.
The rights conferred on the selector by this Act were quite as outrage-
ous as the tenure of the squatters which it demolished. He was authorised
to take his pick of all the Crown lands of the colony, displacing the
squatter by his own individual right. The general principle that temporary
arrangements for the behoof of an individual or a class must yield to a
public want, cannot be reasonably questioned, but the needful change
might have been carried into effect without the offensive and destructive
character which appeared to be its chief recommendation to some of its
supporters.
It was assumed that each squatter was an intruder on the lands belong-
ing to the people, and that the selector was one of the people, while the
squatter was a kind of outlaw. The effect of this feeling carried into
legislation has already been seen. The equitable right which the selector
had was that the law should place within his reach a freehold sufficient in
area to give occupation to his family by means of the established industry
of the country. In other words, he should have had a grazing farm, or
a certain right of commonage, in proportion to the extent and position of
his purchase. This should have been granted subject to such conditions
of occupation and improvement as would be found reasonable and necessary,
and for guidance as to area and other needful details there were plenty of


facts, both statistical and in existence, to draw upon. The adoption of
this policy would probably have led to the allotment of the land under a
preliminary survey, in which village commonages for the smaller freeholders
would have been retained as permanent reserves, and the larger farms
would have had a limited frontage to the valleys and rivers, with the
corresponding back country thrown in. In fact it would have been to a
large extent a repetition of the method of settlement in use fifty years ago.
It may be asked, In what respect would this plan differ from the present
arrangement of selections with grazing rights ? It would differ vitally.
1. The grazing right or commonage would not be liable to intrusion ;
the holdings would be all in fee ; hence they could be fenced in and
improved with absolute security.
2. The preliminary survey and allotment would abolish most of the
vices of the selection system.
3. The country would be laid out more economically ; land would not
be wasted, because boundaries would be conterminous, and it would be
taken up for actual use, and not picked for fraudulent ends, or for the
purpose of blocking out other buyers.
THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE QUESTION.
The respective claims and rights of squatters and selectors are, without
doubt, questions demanding attention from the people of Australia, but
topics of much greater importance to them are kept in the background by
the dissensions between the two interests.
These topics are, first, their direct national interest in the public lands,
and, second, the application of the same to the purposes of immigration.
To those who, like the writer, have observed the occupation of new
country from the first stage for twenty years, the result of the whole
compound system of squatting and selection appears a melancholy farce.
The first look of a newly-found valley or plain seems to suggest that before
long it may be covered by the scattered homes of our countrymen ; the
few flocks of sheep, or two or three hundred .cattle put first on the run,
are swallowed up in the grassy undulations, and there seems to be land,
wood, and water for dozens of homesteads and villages. This is the
instinctive feeling which all men have experienced in the circumstances
who have heart and brain enough to be interested in anything beyond the
contents of a shop-till. After some twenty years another visit to the same
spot shows no progress ; in fact, things have gone back. The old home-
stead is abandoned, and the run is clubbed with another, and nobody knows
exactly who the present owner is. The superintendent has been here only
two years since the station was last sold, and it is again advertised for sale
in the Sydney papers. Some selectors have come upon the river, and the
super, is at war with them. Meantime the sales of fat stock have been
very profitable, and it is said that once the property sold well, in fact, that
it made a small fortune for a man who never saw it, and put no money
into it, but achieved his success through a financial juggle.
This is the actual history of hundreds of stations taken up during the
last quarter of a century ; of resident population they have next to none,


and when money is made from sales it goes into the pocket of some one
who, as likely as not, has seen as much of station life as he has seen of
life in the planets.
The selectors, at the same time, would attempt to settle the country,
but they are resisted in all their movements, and in the houses of squatters
they are invariably spoken of as on a par with paupers and criminals. On
the other hand, the selectors repay this hostility with vindictive hatred,
and a squatter with a court-case brought before a jury of selectors is always
sure of an adverse verdict.
It would be easy to show that the administration of justice is prejudiced
in other departments besides the conduct of juries, under the influence of
this class conflict. The squatting members of a country bench often try to
enforce penalties against selectors, which they waive in dealing with cases
of their neighbours and dependants. In cattle-stealing cases both classes
give full play to their prejudices. Large squatters, anxious to make a
deterrent example, will offer an enormous reward for a conviction, setting
in motion by this means all the rascality of the district. Only last year a
man wholly innocent was arrested at the instance of a combination, four-
fifths of the members of the same being magistrates as well as squatters,
and though he was discharged at once, yet it is said that they handed over
�250 to the suborned scoundrels who laid the information.
Selectors, on the other hand, as jurors, almost always acquit cattle-
stealers when prosecuted by squatters, simply to indulge their grudge.
The viciousness of a system which can thus influence magistrates and
juries can hardly be overrated.
Cattle-stealing is founded largely on the * squatting system. Around
extensive ill-defined runs a fringe of loose population gathers, and depre-
dations are carried on far and wide.
This is the depraved form of an energy which otherwise might be
absorbed in honest work ; but it is certain to appear again and again while
grass grows and horses can be caught, so long as any attempt is made to
preserve the pastures as a close interest. The best cure is found to be in
a fenced country and a resident proprietary.
The monstrous feature in this deep-rooted hostility is that it is not
existing between two races, or even between people of different rearing.
In education and character there is little difference in reality to distinguish
the two classes, and in fact often one member of a family is a selector and
another a squatter. Some of the squatters indeed claim the status of
landed gentry, and so far as a laboured imitation of the outward life of the
class can aid them in attaining their ambition, they are pretty successful.
Their predecessors, a generation ago, in reality, had a good deal of the
character of a ruling caste, but since that time there has been a great level-
ling up as well as levelling down from the general spread of education as
well as other causes. The actual equality existing in the Australian popu-
lation, along with the outward artificial distinction of wealth and caste,
is a fact which English people can. hardly understand. This equality is
not merely political, but it carries a modicum of education, good character,
and good breeding through every grade of society, so capriciously, that it is
impossible to say where the best sort of people are to be found. A cynic
might say that wealth and position were more marked by trickery, ignorance,


and pretension, than by education and honourable feeling ; and that the
poorer orders were distinguished by drunkenness and improvidence ; and
plenty of proof for these statements could be brought forward. Still,
conclusions as to the whole population would be incorrect which were
formed from this evidence, for men of high character and good education
are to be found in nearly all grades. Society is in fact in a fluid state,
and exhibits a transfusion of qualities like nothing to be met with in the
mother country. With all this, there are few English-speaking races with
which the Australians will suffer in comparison. A generous hospitality
to the stranger and eager beneficence to distress and misfortune are found
everywhere. They can assert their personal independence without being
boorish, and they show good-humour and heartiness in all they do. Men
and women under thirty who cannot read and write are scarce, and it would
be difficult to find a constituency that could be bribed with beer and
sovereigns. They are eminently sociable and kindly in disposition, and
keen of all sports and amusements, and, unlike their American cousins,
they fully inherit the healthy English love of country life,
A want of truthfulness and integrity is the blot upon the national
character, and this tendency is daily stimulated by the business dealings
and fraudulent practices growing out of the land system. Mercantile deal-
ings seem to be conducted on the same principle everywhere, but in
Australia trade and finance seem to have proportionally a stronger hold
upon the country than they have elsewhere, and consequently the field for
jobbing is greater. In the deplorable quarrels between the squatters and
selectors the vital interests pending seem to rouse instincts which neither
private conscience nor respect for law have power to check. Both classes
are often so placed that honest dealing would expose them to certain
injury ; this may explain, though it cannot excuse, the means they adopt
for protection, but nothing can palliate the infamy of carrying the spirit of
class hostility to the magistrate?s bench and the jury-box.
It is needless to say that while such a system continues, with a com-
munity in a state of discord, and the lands in hopeless confusion, the
growth of wholesome rural settlement is greatly retarded, and in the same
measure are the colonies disqualified for providing new ground for emigra-
tion.
A glance at the enormous wealth and excessive population of Sydney
will afford an intelligible commentary on what has been said as to the
destination of the proceeds of squatting, and the absorption of land revenue.
New South Wales contains a small community of only 550,000 people,
and the capital contains over 150,000 inhabitants, and there are more good
houses to be seen in one mile of its suburbs than in the whole of the squat-
ting country. Ordinary station residences are little better than sheds, and
there are many properties which have enriched Sydney firms, the houses
on which are not as good as town stables. This centralising tendency
shows that reform should be directed both to the strengthening of the
rural population, and to the establishment of local government. But the
policy wanted needs the hand of a master. He who would deal with the
question must be free from the petty malignity and near-sightedness which
would attack the men and leave the system fundamentally the same.
Any new pressure by legislation on the present squatters as a class


would merely act like pruning away the weaker shoots, and would tend to
strengthen the main stems ; and any half-way measure of compromise
would be work thrown away; it would only postpone the end of the conflict.
The man who believes that two hostile tenures can exist together com-
patibly with true colonisation, after the experience of the last thirty years,
must he credulous, and his faith cannot be founded on a knowledge of
human nature. But it does not follow that though the squatting system
may be condemned, the squatters should come under the same sentence.
He who would place the real squatters elsewhere than first in the army of
colonists, would do them less than justice. The fairest way to meet the
necessities of the case would he to give each lessee of a run compensation
for his tenure in freehold land, and thus extinguish the title. The value
of the tenure could easily he determined by reference to the sales of stations
extending over a term of years, and the equivalent could he given in land
at an appraised price. To give less would not justly meet the substantial
and constructive claims of the squatters which have been detailed. Another
necessary step in reform should pla'ce the lands of each district under
complete local administration.
The statesman who undertakes this work must he resolute in opening
the country to settlement, hut likewise he must be free from the crotchety
? Fourierism ? that would try to jam human nature into parallelograms,
or in a craze for equality would strangle colonisation rather than let any
man get a good bargain. Under the law of succession established in
Australia, there is little evil to be apprehended from the accumulation of
property by families, and in any case it would be a less evil to have a few
large estates here and there, than to have the interior held for the behoof of
a centralising government and absentee speculators.
From the whole question there is one fact to be noted well worth the
attention of legislators.
It shows from what trivial and unnoticed causes the most enormous
results may follow ; a wheel-rut in the turf may become the bed of a
torrent, a pile of wet grass may cause a conflagration. All this furious
faction, with the vices encrusted upon it, can be traced to measures which
were intended only as temporary makeshifts or to meet local wants. On
the squatting leases a corporate interest arose like the monster of Franken-
stein. It has been Protean in its change of character; capricious as
intractable ; it at one time pampers, at another devours, its followers:
working in an ever-widening circle, no man can predict its course, or limit
its future power ; meantime it is consistent only in feeding a swelling
money-power and enriching the chief towns ; while it corrupts the popula-
tion and tramples under foot the real colonisation of Australia.
