ADVERTISEMENT.
It has been observed in a former address, that Entomology considered as a science, in its
piesent state, affords the most ample scope for critical enquiry, and as an object of beautiful
elucidation and splendid embellishment, stands unrivalled. Such was the language of the
author in the course of bis introductory observations to this comprehensive illustration of
general Entomology, and the verity of his assertion, he is induced to conceive, will be appa-
rent, in some measure, on a cursory inspection of those volumes of the Work which have
been since submitted to the public judgment. Aware that a remark of this nature, although
advanced in a casual manner, and as relating only to that science in an enlarged point of
view, was calculated to excite no inconsiderable share of expectation in the mind of many,
the author has been anxious in the progress of his undertaking to gratify that expectation,
and, as he trusts, not altogether without success. He is at least persuaded in his own mind
that every advantage within his power has been embraced to render the publication as respect-
able in the style of execution as the merits and utility of the design deserves.
At the commencement of this Work one volume was professedly undertaken to afford the
English naturalist a more competent idea of the Entomology of China than had been hitherto
produced, at a moment when the public curiosity was awakened to that subject by the appear-
ance of Sir George Staunton’s account of the Embassy of Earl Macartney to that country.
This was succeeded by a second volume, which related exclusively to the insects of India,
and the islands in the contiguous seas; a fertile region to the Entomologist: and one so inti-
mately connected, by its political interests, with the British empire, as to be in a peculiar
manner entitled to consideration. The present volume, which we regard as the third of the
intended series, is appropriated solely to the Entomology of New Holland, New Zealand,
Otaheite, and other adjacent islands, comprising with the two preceding a general epitome of
the insects of Asia, and under this title the three volumes above-mentioned, will in future
be discriminated.
The design of the latter volume claims more explicit observation in this place. There
is, perhaps, no extent of country in the world, that can boast of a more copious or diversified
assemblage of interesting objects in every department of natural history than New Holland,
and its contiguous islands; none that appears more highly worthy of regard: it bursts
upon our view at the first glance like a new creation: the naturalist contemplates its various
productions with astonishment, and is almost inclined to imagine its stores of novelty inex-
haustible. It would be irrelevant to our subject to digress, at any considerable length, upon
this interesting topic, but so far as relates to the Entomological productions of those parts the
reflection is applicable, these are both curious and beautiful, and are besides distinct, in a
very material degree, from any other of the insect tribe that have been hitherto discovered
in other countries.
Entomology, though embracing only an inconsiderable portion of that attention bestowed
upon the science of natural history, by those distinguished individuals who were the first to


explore the Australasian regions at the fane of their d.scovery by Captain Cook, was ceitain y
bv no means neglected, as the Banksian cabinet, richly stored with the entomological acqui-
sitions collected in those parts at that period, most clearly evinces. To this cabinet the author
owes many obligations in the course of the present undertaking; and it is truly with some .hare
of pride, attempered with a becoming sense of gratitude to the liberality ot Sn Joseph Ban s,
Bart the author has it in his power to add, that the Epitome of Australasian Entomology,
stands, if possible, more peculiarly indebted to that cabinet than either ot the preceding
volumes The assemblage of New Holland insects it comprises are inestimable, and from
the unreserved access to that cabinet with which he has been uniformly indulged, lie has
not foiled to enrich his selection for this Work, with drawings and descr.pt.ons of every
species, that could materially tend to improve and enhance its value.*-
Independent of the above advantages the author may be allowed to mention the collection
in his own possession, that containing many of the insects noticed in the present Work.
Besides a number of those species found in the vicinity of our settlement in New South
Wales, he has been long possessed of a select number ot scarce insects collected by ■ •
Bailey’, the astronomer, who sailed in one of the expeditions with Captain Cook, and since
the death of the late Mr. Drury, he has further enriched his cabinet with many others discovered
in New Holland, and adjacent islands, at the time they were visited by Sir Joseph Banks.
The author has also farther to acknowledge the benefit he has derived from inspecting
two other cabinets of celebrity in this country, without the assistance of which the present
illustration would have been far less copious and interesting, than it is at this time: these
are the cabinet of Mr. Francillon, and that of A. Macleay, Esq. to both of whom he begs
leave to express his warmest thanks for this testimony of their friendship.
In the descriptive part of this Work the author has been anticipated by Fabricius, but
that only to a small extent; for, as it will be observed in the progress of this Work, the far
greater portion of those insects have not been hitherto described by any authoi. To Linnaeus,
it is almost superfluous to say, that not a single insect in the whole volume could have been
known. Fabricius, when in England, was allowed to describe those in the Banksian cabinet,
the descriptions of which have since appeared in the Entomologia Systematica. Some of the
coleopterous insects of New Holland, described by Fabiicius, aie figured oli\ei, but the
lepidoptera, and all the other tribes, remain untouched by the artist. It was therefore an
important point, in the idea of the author, to delineate the more conspicuous, or otherwise
interesting subjects of the Fabrician species that had never undergone such an elucidation;
and it will be found that an extensive selection of these are given in the present volume in
addition to those more recently discovered kinds that have neither been figured nor described
by any Entomologist.
* The Banksian cabinet was lately presented by Sir Joseph Banks to the Linnaean Society of London.

An interefting fpecies from New South Wales, where we believe it to be uncommon. This is a non-
defcript infect.
CETONIA CARINATA.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Thorax pitchy, with black margin: wing-cafes black and fulcated: furrows broad, and befet with
fulvous hairs.

Cetonia Philipsii. Tranf. Linn. Soc. VI. p. 103. t. 20. f. 4.
A lingular and very rare fpecies from the cabinet of Mr. Francillon, who obtained it from New
Holland. This is not a new fpecies, the individual fpecimen from whence our defcription and figure are
taken having been previoufly defcribed by Dr. Schreibers in the entomological paper above referred to.
CETONIA DORSALIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Black, margin of the thorax teftaceous, with a black dot: wing-cafes teftaceous, with a broad futural black
band, and dot of the fame on the fhoulder.
Cetonia Dorsalis: nigra thoracis margine teftaceo pundto nigro, elytris teftaceis futara late pun&oque

Not very uncommon in the vicinity of the Englifh fettlements at New South Wales.


COLEOPTERA.
MELOLONTHA VIRIDI-ÆNEA.
GENERIC CHARACTER.
Antennae clavated, with the club lamellated: head broader than long, and rounded in front: thorax
broad: fcutel round: wing-cafes as long as the abdomen.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Thorax brafly, fhining, and with the wing cafes teftaceous, changeable to green: body green: legs
teftaceous.
Melolontha Viridi-jenea: thorace aeneo nitido elytrifque teftaceis viridi micantibus corpore viridi,
pedibus teftaceis.
Nature feems to have devoted abundant attention to the embellifhment of this common infed: its
glow of colouiing is peculiar and inimitable. The prevailing hues do not fo ftridtly pleafe us by their
harmony as then contraft, which indeed is ftriking, or rather glaring, but upon the whole produce a
lich effe<st. The ground colour of the body is teftaceous, glofted with a clear pellucid green, and as the
infefl moves, the more prominent parts illumined by the concentrated rays of light that ftrike upon its
polifhed furface appear highly metallic, partaking either of a brafly, or golden fplendour.
There is another fpecies of the Melolontha genus which alfo is found plentifully in New Holland that
bears a ftrong affinity to this fpecies, but is of a deeper golden colour, and does not appear changeable to
green as in our lpecies viridi-aenea.
LUCANUS ÆNEUS.
GENERIC CHARACTER.
Antennae clavated, the club comprefted, and divided into lliort pe&inated laminae: jaws advanced and
dentated: {hanks of the anterior legs dentated : feet of five joints.


SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Brafly, jaws exferted, recurved, and hairy within: head fmall: thorax large and com ex.
Lucanus JEneus: mandibulis exfertis recurvis interne hirtis capite parvo, thorace magno convexo.

Lethrus /Eneus. Fair. Ent. Syfi. T. 1. p . 2. n. 2. — Syft, Eleut. 1. p. 2. n. 2.
Although hitherto efteemed a rarity among the entomologifts of this country r , Lucanus iEneus appears
to be by no means unfrequent in fome parts of the ifland of New Holland j we have lately feen, for
inftance, a parcel of them brought from that country, amounting to not lefs than fifty fpecimens,
all which were colleded in the environs of the Englifh fettlement at New South Wales. The fpecies has
thus become pretty common now in England. When Fabricius delcribed it, this infed, on the contrary,
was extremely rare, the only fpecimens of it known in this country, or perhaps in Europe, being at
that time in the Bankfian cabinet; for the fpecies was originally difcovered in Norfolk ifland, in the Pacific
Ocean, by Sir Jofeph Banks. Fabricius did not certainly examine this infed with his accultomed accu-
racy and critical difcrimination, or he would not have aftigned it to his new genus Lethrus, (the firft in
his clafs Eleuterata) fince it is mold afluredly a Lucanus of the Fabrician, as well as the Linnaean Syftem.
The figures of this infed in the annexed plate exhibit tw r o very ftriking varieties of this lpecies, one
being of a fine golden colour, and the other a dark green. Of the latter kind fome other fpecimens have
occurred to our obfervation in which the colours varied from a dark green to blue, or at leaft blueifh.
The fpecimens in the cabinet of Mr. Francillon are from Norlolk Ifland.
LUCANUS PARVUS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Brown: jaws exferted, and toothed on the outfide: head fmall: thorax large and canaliculated: wing-
cales ftriated.
Lucanus Parvus : brunneus, mandibulis exfertis extus dentatus, capite parvo, thorace magno, cana-
liculate, elytris ftriatis.
A new fpecies of Lucanus, but of a diminutive fize compared with the reft of the in feds in the fame
genus, and in allufton to which we have named it parvus. Mr. Francillon is in poflefllon of this curious
infed, which he received from New Holland.

CERAPTERUS MACLEAII.
GENERIC CHARACTER.
Antennas compreffed, pinnated, with the firft joint concave, and placed tranfverfely, and that at the
extremity large, and rounded at the apex: head very fmall, with the eyes prominent: thorax flat,
fomewhat heart-thaped, truncated, and narrower than the elytra: wing-cafes length of the abdomen,
and embracing it at the (ides: body oblong.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Entirely brown, with the legs limple.
Cerapterus Macleaii : totus brunneus, pedibus (implicibus.
A nondefcnpt fpecies of this fingular genus has been received by our kind friend Mr. Francillon
from New Holland. This is a diminutive, but mod curious creature, and is efpecially remarkable for
the ftrudure of the antennae, which latter appear to confiderable advantage under the lens of the opake
microfcope. The fmalleft figure in the plate denotes the natural fize, and the two larger ones are de-
ligned to (hew its magnified appearance.
In its general habit this mfeft approaches the Paufus genus; with which the juvenile Entomologift,
attentive only to the magnitude and club-like form of the antennae, might eafily confound it. The
difference between thofe mfefts is, indeed, obvious on more clofe infpedion; the Paufus having only two
joints in the antennae, of which that at the extremity is by far the largeft; while the antennae of the true
Cerapterus are furnifhed with feveral joints, all which are of a compreffed form, pinnated, and termi-
nated at both extremities with one larger than the reft.
The genus Cerapterus is defcribed by Swederus, in the Tranfa&ions of the Swedifh Academy for
the year I*BB,* but does not appear to have been noticed by any other author. The defcription given
by Swederus is taken from an infed which he names Cerapterus Latipes, in the colledion of General

Davies of Blackheath, and which he ftates to be a native of Honduras, but erroneoufly, as we are aflured
that gentleman obtained the infedt Swederus mentions from Bengal. Another fpecies of Cerapterus was
lately brought from the fame country by Mr. Fichtel, who configned it to the imperial cabinet at Vienna.
Our Auftralafian infedt, therefore, appears to be the third fpecies of this genus at prefent known, and
being perfedtly undefcribed, we beg leave to name it in compliment to our good friend A. M'Leay,
Efq. S.L.S.

Curculio Spectabilis : breviroftris femoribus dentatis, corpore viridi variegato.
Fab. Ent. Syfi. T. 1. p. 2. p. 483. 5p.373 .
This is a fine confpicuous infedt, and bears in this country the trivial appellation of the “ Botany Bay
Diamond Beetle,” in allufion to its refemblance to that brilliant creature Curculio Imperial is, the fpecies
known moft commonly with us by the name of the Diamond Beetle. The fimilitude between thofe
fpecies is, however, remote. Curculio Spectabilis partakes in fome degree of the form, fize, and habit
of Impenalis, but is altogether deftitute of the lovely fparkling luftre which fo eminently charadterifes
the latter fpecies. A magnified figure of this beetle is reprefented clinging to the bloffoms of the Metro-
fideros Citrina in the upper part of the plate; this, as well as C. Imperialis, being a moft delightful
objedt for microfcopical obfervation.
Curculio Spedtabilis, once a rare infedt, has of late years ceafed to be confidered valuable in the efti-
mation of the Entomologifts of this country, in confequence of the number brought hither at various
times from our fettlement in New South Wales. Throughout the whole ifland of New Holland this
feems to be one of the moft abundant infedts, and being a creature of remarkable figure and appearance,
we are not to be furprifed that it fhould attradt the attention of thofe who colledt the natural produdtions
of that country, either as objedts of curiofity for themfelves, or for the fake of emolument.

An infed of this curious kind occurs among the Auftralafian Curculiones in the cabinet of Mr Fran-
cillon There can be no doubt of its being a Curculio of Linnaeus, but we were mifled by its ambiguous
appearance in the firft inftance to believe it a Curculio, of that particular fedion which Fabnc.us defcnbes as
a diftinft genus under the name of Brachycerus, an opinion which, on further inveft.gation, we are in-

This is an infedt of mod: extraordinary appearance. It was difcovered in New Holland by Dr. White,

Dr. Schreibers of Vienna, when in England, defcribed this fpecies of Cerambyx, with feveral other
very curious Auftralafian infedts, from the cabinet of Mr. Francillon, in a paper prefented to the Linnaean
Society of London, and which was afterwards printed in their tranfadtions as above referred to. The names
afligned to thofe infedts by the ingenious Dr. Schreibers are for the moft part retained by us; but we
have to regret that the prolixity of his fpecifical diftindtions do not fo perfedtly accord with our ideas as to
allow us to adopt them alfo, without material abridgment, and fome alterations: they want that decilive

A moft curious infeft from New South Wales, in the cabinet of Mr. Francillon. This fpecies is ap-
pofitely named Lepidopterus by Dr. Schreibers, in the paper above referred to, from the villofe fpots
on the wing-cafes, which, when attentively examined, appear cloathed with a fort of fcaly down, or
feathering, moft exa&ly refembling that which we obferve on the wings of Lepidopterous infe&s. This
fpecies of Prionus is probably unique in this country, or perhaps in Europe.

The entomologifl: we are convinced will be delighted with this choice addition to our fele&ion of
Auflralafian Cimicesj it is perfedtly new, of a confpicuous figure, large, and beautiful, and upon the
whole fo well deferves fome name of appofite fignification to diftinguifh it that we (hall aflign to it that
of Bankfii. It is a little remarkable, that this is a fpecific name not pre-occupied by any of the Cimex
genus, although it will be remembered, that to the afliduities beftowed by Sir Jofeph Banks on the
fcience of Entomology, we are indebted for the difcovery of three of the fineft fpecies of that genus hitherto
known, Imperialis , Regalis , and Paganus , all which are natives of New Holland.
Cimex Bankfii is from New Holland, where it was found by Dr. White, and is at this time in the

under the fpecific names of Auftralafia and Elegans.

The metallic fplendor of this lovely in fed, and its analogous fpecies Imperialis , is aftonifhingly fine.
Regalis is efpecially, if poffible, more pre-eminently beautiful in this refped than the other; fo much
indeed on this occafion, more than on the former, we may truly regret the feeble powers of the pencil,
which afford us no fuch a decided tone of colouring as is likely to imprefs the mind with a true conception
of the original. It is as refplendent as a mafs of polifhed gold, and is, beiides, very richly gioffed with
a variety of prifmatic hues.
Both the fpecies, Imperialis and Regalis, as above obferved, were difcovered by Sir Jofeph Banks in
New Holland, and are defcribed by Fabricius from the fpecimens in the Bankfian cabinet. At this period
we are acquainted with only two other infeds of this fpecies in the Pintomological cabinets of this coun-
try ; one of which, formerly in the colledion of the late Mr. Drury, is now in our own poffefiion, and
the other in the cabinet of Mr. Francillon.

PAPILIO AGRICOLA.
GENERIC CHARACTER.
Antennae thickeft towards the extremity, and generally terminated in a club. Wings ere& when at
reft. Fly by day.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Wings black : anterior ones with yellow, and orange fpots: on the pofterior wings a ftreak of blue, and
another of fanguineous colour.
Papilio Agricola: alis nigris: anticis flavo aurantioque maculatis; pofticis cyanea fanguineoque

This is perfe&ly a new fpecies, and poffefles no ordinary {hare of gaiety in its contrafted hues to recom-

From New South Wales.
PAPILIO FRONTINUS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Wings fomewhat dentated, black, and white at the tips: a broad unindentated band of white acrofs the
middle of the anterior pair.
Papilio Frontinus : alis fubdentatis nigris apice albis : anticis medio fafcia lata unindentata alba.
Papilio Frontinus was received from New South Wales, and does not appear to be defcribed by any writer.
The two infects above mentioned having filiform acuminated antennae, are evidently of the Papilio
genus: belonging to that particular fe&ion which our good friend William Jones, Efq. of Chelfea, in his
excellent paper on a new arrangement of the Papiiiones calls Romani .* To what genera we ought to refer
the other fpecies reprefented in the fame plate is not quite fo obvious : they appear at the firft view to be
ftrongly allied both in charadter and habit to Romani likewife; but this is doubtful: we are upon the
whole inclined, on a more accurate infpe&ion, to refer them rather to the Bombyces.

SPHINX AUSTRALASIA.
GENERIC CHARACTER.
Antennae thickeft in the middle, and somewhat prifm-form: tongue moftly exferted: feelers tw T o, refledted:
wings defledted.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Wings angulated: anterior ones fufco-teftaceous, with an obfcure band behind: pofterior wings fulvous,
with the anal angle, and margin fufcous.
Sphinx Australasia: alis angulatis anticis fufco-teftaceis poftice fafcia obfcura, pofticis fulvis: angulo
ani margineque fufcis.
This gigantic fpecies of the Sphinx tribe was altogether unknown till very lately to the entomologifts
of this country. The firft fpecimen of it that was moft probably ever brought to Europe was that in the
colledtion of Dr. White, and which was afterwards configned to the cabinet of Mr. Francillon, where it now
remains. This is not however the only fpecimen of the fpecies in this country at prefent, for Mr. M‘Leay
alfo has lately obtained one in very tine condition among fome other rare and valuable infedts from
New Holland.
Not defcribed by any author.
SPHINX TRIANGULARIS.
SPECIFIC CHARACTER.
Wings very entire, teftaceous-brown, with a large triangular fufcous fpot: bafe of the pofterior
wings fulvous.
Sphinx Triangularis: alis integerrimis fufco-teftaceis: anticis macula magna triangulari fufca, pofticis
baft fulvis.


The remarks already advanced in fpeaking of our new fpecies Sphinx Auftralafiae, will apply in a mate-
rial degree to this nondefcript fpecies likewife. We cannot entertain a doubt of its being perfectly
unknown in this country till it was introduced at the fame time as the former by Dr. White. It is rather
larger than our Auftralafiae, to which it bears no very remote refemblancej the colours are in general
darker, and it is in particular diftinguifhed by a narrow white ftreak that extends along the interior
margin of the firft pair of wings.
Of this fpecies we have lately feen three or four fpecimens in different cabinets.

and marked with white fpots.
Ocultaria: alis dentatis grifeis fufco-brigofis fubtus anticis fufco-maculatis driga fanguinea,
pobicis fafcia fanguinea extus fufca, albida-notata.
In all the Infe&s of the Phalaena tribe we are at prefent acquainted with, the fuperior furface of the
wings fo conbantly excel the lower one in point of beauty, or the brilliancy of colouring, that we are to
regard our new Audralahan fpecies not only as a very interebing infedt, but as a novelty, in which the
ordinary courfe of nature appears reverfed. It diould be obferved, that this dilhmilarity is not by any
means unfrequent in the Papilio genus, the lower furface of which are commonly the mob beautiful, but
that it fcarcely ever occurs in any other of the Lepidopterous kinds of infedts. Of the Geometra tribe, to
which our Phalaena Ocultaria belongs, we have certainly fome few fpecies that are equally beautiful on
both furfaces, but no one, perhaps, has hitherto been difcovered in which the difference is fo remarkable
in favour of the lower furface as in the infedt before us; the upper furface being of a plain, and pale
grey, with a few dark breaks, while that is embellilhed with a rich variety of colours, and thofe dif-
pofed in breaks and fpots in a very elegant manner.
There are fpecimens of this curious infedt in the principal entomological cabinets in London. It is
found in the neighbourhood of the Englifh fettlements in New South Wales, and has not to our
knowledge been delcribed by any author.
