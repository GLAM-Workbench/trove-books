MEET AT MUDGEE IN MARCH
MUDGEE is celebrating its Centenary from March 6 to 12. The
event will be one of proud accomplishment, happy re-union and
increased stimulation. No effort is being spared to make it
a triumphant success and Mudgee?s one-hundredth birthday
will be commemorated in a manner befitting the important occasion. It
is something of which worthily to be proud and what is worthy is worth
celebrating well. Every day is to be the big day and every night the
night of nights. Meet at Mudgee for seven happy days!
There will be many factors of interest. There will be the unveiling
MR. V. D. COX.
President Mudgee Centenary Celebrations Committee
of the handsome memorial to Lieutenant William Lawson, discoverer
of Mudgee; there will be the holiday spirit, the zest of a week of
carnival and the joys of glad re-union with kith and kin. In addition,
there will be recognition and acknowledgment of the great work of the
bold, strenuous and fearless pioneers who blazed the trail and laid the
foundation stone, ?the first settlers whose work was taken up by the
men and women who, generations ago, followed their footsteps.
Mudgee men during the great war went gladly to the fight, for love
of country, for liberty and patriotism. Patriotism ?like charity?be-
gins at home. It is love of country and the deeper core of love of

country is love of home. Men and women, all over the State and be-
yond, who first touched the hem of their mother?s garment in the old
home town, will return to Mudgee, with pleasure and rejoicing, because
they held Mudgee in great and lasting affection and because, wherever
they may be, Mudgee is?Home.
As regards travelling, the Railway Department of the Government
of New South Wales has agreed largely to augment the existing ser-
vices and to grant cheap fares, on all lines to Mudgee, for the whole
of the period.. To those who will travel by road it may be pointed
out that Mudgee is a well-known and appreciated stop for motor parties,
popular as a tourist centre and halt on the Sydney to Brisbane trip.
Only an eight-hour run from Sydney, through country possessing mar-
vellous scenic attractions, it is situate on the main artery from the
northern line of coast to the western district.
MR. R. DOBIE BAWDEN.
Hon, Secretary, Mudgee Centenary Celebrations Committee
The matter of providing accommodation for visitors who will stay
for a period is important. In addition to the ordinary facilities at the
score of hotels and boarding houses, a list of private residents will be
kept who will accommodate paying guests, stretchers will be supplied to
hotels and tents will also be erected. Early reservations at the hotels
are advised.
As this Souvenir Book has to be got out well in advance of the date
of the Celebrations, it is not possible, in it, to publish the definite
programme for the week. But it will be one of unrivalled attractions
from start to finish (Sunday, March 6, to Saturday, March 12). The
many features being arranged include the following:
Special services by the ministers of all denominations.
The unveiling of the memorial to Lieut. William Lawson on March
10th in Robertson Park.
An historical pageant, exhibiting a broad and inclusive review of
the past, with pioneers, first settlers, aboriginals, bushrangers, gold-
seekers and incidents of early days; bushmen, bullock waggons and

| MUDGEE AND ITS FUTURE.

Page Sik
???? ????
fHE vast potential wealth of Mudgee and the surrounding? country,
in a dozen varied directions of mineral and agricultural effort,
affords the soundest belief for the anticipation that, in this
distinct of unlimited possibilities, already perceived and gradu-
ally being opened up, a great future is in store for this favored portion
of New South Wales.
Mr. W. M. Fleming, M.H.R. for Robertson, inspiringly sums up his
opinion of the splendid opportunities in and around Mudgee as follows:
?Mudgee is a district with a future as well as a past.
?To. those of the interior of New South Wales, especially in the
north-western portion of the State, Mudgee has long been a household
word. For many years it was the centre from which all things
radiated. When the Cox's and the Lawson?s settled on the banks of
the Cudgegong they formed the base from which many pioneers went
forth to establish new stations and to which they ever returned with
interest. Many a good man has ridden a hundred miles and more to
do business in Mudgee and not a few good horses have travelled night
and day to the doctor in Mudgee. To this day there are those, out
back, who owe them lives to the skill and care to be found in the old
town.
?Like almost all our newly settled districts Mudgee was first stocked
with cattle and horses. Later it became famous for its fine woolled
sheep. Some of each still remain but, for the most part, the day of
the glory of these is past. They are being produced in greater numbers
in wider runs, but the district has not stood still and lamented. It has
moved with the times and has become a faim ng and fruitgrowing
centre, its lucerne fields and its vineyards ma.i.taining and widening
its reputation as a producer of the highest grade ci article.
?Concurrent with this development has come one of quite another
character. From almost its earliest days Mudgee was noted for the
goldfields by which it was surrounded. Thore of an alluvial character
have mostly long since been worked out. Low and then a nugget is
discovered to stir the imagination and fire old prospectors anew with
that hope that never dies in the heart of the true gold digger. The lode
propositions, too, have fallen on evil days. But those most qualified to
judge of these things hold strongly to the belief that they will yet come
again into something of their old time splendour.
?It is from this underground source, as well as from the surface of
the soil that Mudgee is assured of its future. Coal and marble, lime
and shale, iron ore and slate, kaolin and other clays and rare earths,
all of these are to be found in large quantities and of good quality.
Gradually they are being opened up and supporting an ever-increasing
population. Mt would be indeed a bold man who would put a limit to
the possibilities of development in this direction.
?Herein lies the strength of the Mudgee district. It is not a one
industry place, nor a field of limited possibilities. Wool and meat,
grain and butter, honey and timber, fruit and wine, horses, metals]
minerals, almost all that men can need can here be produced in abund-
ance in a climate that is clear, sound and healthy and amidst sur-
roundings that are always interesting and at times beautiful,?

things, its effect only to be traced in the sturdy vigor of our people.
It was but natural that this should be so.
The first settlers in Australia were of necessity those who came
from other and far-off countries. Their eyes looked backward at least
as much as thev looked forward. As is almost invariably and inevitably
tne case with those who have changed their country in their later
years, they lived more in memory than in anticipation, the new r home
stood for change, for strange and unfamiliar ways, the old for tender
recollections.
To-day, Australia is peopled chiefly with Australian-born. Proud
of our parents and our grandparents, of all that they achieved and of
the traditions they have handed down to us, we are equally proud of
the land of our birth. \\ e know what a noble heritage it is; we sae
near at hand and more or less clearly where our forbears only dis-
tantly discerned its glorious possibilities. For their sake, for the
sake of those who fought and fell upon the fields of fame, for our own
sakes, for the sake of our children, we shall preserve the glories of
the past while safeguarding the greater grandeur of the future.

HON. W. F. DUNN, Minister for Agriculture, contributes the
following stirring message:
?It is a great pleasure to take part in the Mudgee Centenary
Celebrations. Mudgee is an historic town. The celebrations
are an historic event. They impel one to glance back at the earliest
beginnings, when plucky men and women turned the first sods and
felled the first trees.
?Mudgee deservedly has the reputation of solidity. Appearances
suggest it. Statistics prove it. The people make the town. Mudgee
would not be what it is to-day but for the industry, thrift and courage
of the settlers. Psychology is an index to progress. It is the best
fortune teller.
?For many years it was my vocation to teach. In the teaching I
was able to study the mentality of the children?the Mudgee children.
My experiences as a teacher gave me great hopes. The parents have
accomplished much. Children such as they have raised in a State where
education is liberal and free, are capable of doing great things. Many
opportunities will lie in their own town as it continues to grow?oppor-
tunities which the solid, progressive parent citizens have made and are
making.
"But larger opportunities lie farther afield. We are all Australians
and want the best brains we can get in all spheres of life. Every
child who does well from the historic town we are celebrating will help
to print larger the name of Mudgee on the map. It is already writ
large. Its magnificent contribution in men and money to the great
war, its standing as a business centre and as a field of agricultural and
pastoral industry, entitle it to that just recognition which is being be-
stowed upon it in these celebrations. May it grow and prosper.?
fALK Mudgee, think Mudgee, dream Mudgee,? writes Mr. W.
G. Ashford, in the following stirring appreciation of ?the
capital of the inner west.?
?Surrounded by hills, in the midst of a fertile, well watered
district, lies the ?old? town of Mudgee. The capital of the inner-west
is about to celebrate its Centenary, proud of its progress, its future pos-
sibilities, its citizens ?public and private and past and present,?its
future, for Mudgee has done its share in the peaceful development of
State and Commonwealth and without doubt, will do it in the wider
sphere, the upholding and maintaining of the same in the second Cen-
tenary shortly to be entered upon.
?How much one hundred years

tent, be realised. Its pioneers placed

district it is second to none, as also with its famous lucerne flats; all in
eentives to present and future generations.
?It has now its defined Mudgee and Mudgee district citizens, who
can talk Mudgee, think Mudgee, dream Mudgee, surely a heritage worthy
of it. People can place Mudgee further on the map by patronising local
industry, by making decentralisation, as well as talking it, by creating
production by local manufactories and local purchases. More local
purchases make more incentive to produce locally and more people
locally to attend to local needs.
?Mudgee, with its rich river flats, with its beautiful climate and soils
suitable for primary production, has an immense future. In the cele-
brations of its Centenary nothing possibly is more applicable to past
and future than a portion of Longfellow?s ?Psalm of Life,? which reads-
?Lives of great men oft remind us.
We may make our lives sublime,
And departing leave behind us
Footprints in the sands of time,?

plorers, Wentworth, Blaxland and Lawson, the gate to the Golden West
was unlocked and soon the stream of settlers trickled through. It was
not long before Mudgee attracted many of the ?unnamed heroes? who

established the foundation of what is now the prosperous and thriving
district of Mudgee.
?Our first century has seen wonderful development in agricultural
and pastoral pursuits. On the eve of the centenary, while congratu-
lating the district on its wonderful expansion in primary production,
it is, I think, appropriate to express the desire that long before the second
cycle is reached, Mudgee may also boast of many great industrial enter-
prises.
?.The district possesses all the essentials?coal, minerals, wool and
wheat. I am confident, with continued faith in the district and good
business enterprise, Mudgee may also rank in the future as a centre
both for primary and secondary industries.
?Mudgee is worthy of her centenary. May its success be as great
as Mudgee?s worth.?
8 FEATURE of the Centenary Celebrations will be the unveiling
of a memorial obelisk, for which a site has been chosen at the
north-east corner of Robertson Park The obelisk is of polished
trachyte and rises to a height of fifteen feet. Beautiful in itself
it will add to the attractions of Mudgee?s principal park, but above all
it will commemorate, for present and future generation?/,, the heroic
work of the men to whom is owed the discovery of Mudgee and the
settlement of the district around.
On the front of the obelisk and on the right and left faces of the die
are the following inscriptions:
?To commemorate the achievement of Lieutenant William Lawson,
who was the first to traverse the site of Mudgee and to explore the
country beyond.? ?Also to commemorate James Blackman, Superin-
tendent of Bathurst, who first discovered the Cudgegong River and
traced its course to the vicinity of Mudgee.? ?Also to commemorate
George and Henry Cox and William Lawson, the pioneer settlers of the
Mudgee district.?
Above the inscription of the front die is the legend: ?Mudgee, 1821-
1921,? and above that again a bronze of Lieut. Lawson,
while ilpon the corresponding faces are symbolical representations of
agriculture, mining and the wool industry, the drawings for which were
kindly made by Mr Stewart Allen.
The obelisk is the work of Mr. B. B. Acton, of Gagliardi and Co.,
Sydney and the bronzes are from the studio of Mr. P. Calve, sculptor,
Sydney. The cost of the obelisk, including the medallion and in-
scriptions amounts to �4OO.

Lawson: ? . ? ,
Born in 1780, he arrived in Sydney, in 1800, as ensign in the 2nd
Regiment. Appointed to New South Wales Corps and sent for duty to
Norfolk Island, where he started sheep breeding. Returned to Sydney
and became A.D.C. to the Lieutenant-Governor. In 1808 he was made a

FACTS ABOUT JAMES BLACKMAN.

a few facts concerning Mr. James Blackman are available.
Ml The tradition in the family is that he began his studies for the
VjW profession of medicine, but came out to the Colony with his
father, Mr. Samuel Blackman, sen., before completing his course.
He joined the police and rose to the rank of superintendent, as it
was then called. He was appointed to Bathurst and in 1821, about
the end of his time there, made the journey north, on which he dis-

Mullamuddy or perhaps Broombee.
He spent his last years in Mudgee, where he occupied ? Dewhurst,
to the south of the town near the road to the waterwroks. He lies
buried in the Blackman vault in the old Church of England cemetery.
The lettering on the stone has been largely worn away, and all that is
now decipherable is that he died at the age of 83 years.

DISCOVERY OF MUDGEE.
fHE discovery of Mudgee links on to the discovery and settlement
of Bathurst. In 1814, some few months after the
forcing of a passage over the Blue Mountains
by Messrs. Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth and
the discovery by Surveyor-General Evans of the rich
Bathurst Plains, Mr. William Cox was entrusted by Governor Macquarie
with the task of making a ?carriage road? from Emu Plains to Bathurst
and with the assistance of thirty artificers and laborers under a guard
of eight soldiers completed the task?over a hundred miles ?in
the almost incredibly short time of six months.
The new settlement at Bathurst went ahead by lekps and bounds,
but the flocks and herds multiplied too greatly and following a drought
about the year 1821, fresh pastures became an urgent necessity. About
this time a rumor reached Bathurst of the existence of good grazing
country away over the mountains to the northward and Mr. James
Blackman, superintendent of the settlement, set out to test its truth.
Mr. Blackman?s account of the journey has been lost. But Mr. Allan
Cunningham, the famous botanist and explorer, writing in 1822, makes
the following iinportant statement;
?No persons have ventured to penetrate from the settlement of Bath-
urst in a due north direction until somewhat more than twelve months
since, when Mr. Blackman, the late superintendent, made an effort at
that point of bearing and discovered the valuable limestone sixteen miles
on his route; the Cudgegong, a distance of thirty-four miles further
and fine grazing country in the immediate vicinity of the native station
called Mudgee, twenty-five or twenty-six miles down the left bank of
that secondary stream.?
Accepting this statement as correct, and Mr. Cunningham was a
careful and accurate observer, two things are evident ?that Mr. Black-
man was the first discoverer of the Cudgegong and of the country
along its banks down nearly as far as Mudgee, but that he never reached
Mudgee itself. To do that he would have needed to travel eighty-six
miles from Bathurst, instead of seventy-six miles, as reported by Mr.
Cunningham.
This is corroborated by members of the Blackman family, who have
seen the lost journal of their relative. According to them it was here
stated by Mr. Blackman that on his journey he got within sight
of what was afterwards found to be the native station of Mudgee,
but that seeing before him a wide expanse of swamp land densely
covered with tall reeds he had returned to Bathurst without attempt-
ing to penetrate any further. The discovery of Mudgee itself and the
exploration and opening up for settlement the country around and be-
yond it was reserved for Lieut. William Lawson.
Soon after Mr. Blackman?s return, to Bathurst Lieut. Lawson,
who was commandant of the settlement, organised an expedition with
the view of further exploring the newly discovered territory and of find-
ing a way from the south to the Liverpool Plains. Taking with him
Mr. John Blackman, a native guide and four prisoners, he set out on
November 8, 1821. The Cudgegong was reached on the 11th and fol-
lowing the rive" down, the party camped somewhere in the neighbor-
hood of Broombee on the forenoon of the 12th. On the same morning
Lieut. Lawson set off with Mr. Blackman and the native guide in a
westerly direction and |his journal of this date Is worthy of quotation.
?After riding about nine miles I found very lofty ridges of high
mountains running west and north-west with coni-cal hills on them. I

saw no prospect of going west or north-west. I then shaped my course
across the river we had left and rode about 15 miles in a north direction,
the country there appearing much lower. We ascended a very high
ridge of mountains and found the country fall off in a north-east direc-
tion. Returned to our camp at eight o?clock, the men firing guns for
us. This is a delightful country, with a chain of fine large meadows of
the best land. The wood growing on the forest land is principally
appletrees.?
This is Lieut. Lawson?s description of his journey over the
site of Mudgee; on to somewhere in the neighborhood of Menah and
then across the river northward in the direction of Cooyal; the first
occasion on which these localities were traversed by white men.
Lieut. Lawson had set out with the intention of making Liver-
pool Plains. On November 13 he pushed on in a northerly direction.
Two days travel brought the parties to the Talbragar River, which
was explored upwards for ten miles on the day of arrival and fifty
miles downward on the three following days. By this time Lieut. Law-
son?s horse had lost his shoes and the men being without shoes and very
much fatigued the attempt to reach the Liverpool Plains was given up
for the time. The party returned to Bathurst, having made a journey
of 400 miles, in the course of which Mudgee and the country for a
hundred miles north of it had been traversed for the first time.
In the beginning of 1822 Lieut. Lawson, accompanied by Mr.
Christy, made a second journey through the Mudgee district to make
the Liverpool Plains. But his guide got sick, provisions threatened to
run out and he was forced to turn back, leaving the
road along the road over the Pandora Pass on to the
Liverpool Plains, to be discovered by Mr. Allan Cun-
nirgham later in the same year. On his way north Lawson had asked
the natives he met with to meet him at Mudgee on his return. He
found upwards of a hundred waiting for him, many belonging to tribes
who had never seen a white man before, while all were much terrified
at the sight of the horses and dogs. They were quite friendly and
Lawson parted from them on the best of terms, after getting their pro-
mise to visit him in Bathurst, a promise afterwards fulfilled.
Such is the story, in brief, of the discovery and exploration of the
Mudgee district, and when the physical endurance, the tenacity of pur-
pose and the powers of leadership needed to overcome the difficulties of
the task are considered it is fitting to hold in honor and commemorate
the men who opened up this rich district for settlement.
It may be added that much of the information regarding the dis-
covery of Mudgee has been made available through the courtesy of the
under-secretary of the Department of Lands and especially Mr. Henry
Selkirk, the historical expert of the department, whose researches
amongst the documents in the Mitchell Library have cleared up many
obscurities and brought to light many new facts.
The Mudgee Bowling Club, opened in 1906, has a large mem-
bership and games by electric light at night are greatly appreciated.
In the early days of settlement Chief Saturday was the deadliest
enerfiy of the whites and Chief Sunday affirmed he owned all the
land around -Mudgee. ?Missa Cox only got it,? he said.
Lawn tennis has always been a popular game in Mudgee and the
club has always extended a hearty welcome to visitors at the courts
on the public sports ground. Local players, from time to time, have
returned with honors after competing with players in the metropolis.

EARLY SETTLEMENT
�HEN Lieut. William Lawson got back' to Bathurst after his first
expedition, one of the first tnings he did was tojsend for his
friend, Mr. George Cox, than managing the Hereford estate
near the settlement tor his father, Mr. William Cox. Lieut.
Lawson strongly advised him to take up some of the splendid land
m the newly discovered territory. Mr. Cox decided to take Lawson?s
advice and making up a party which included Mr. William Lee and
Mr. William Lewis he set out for tne promised land.
folio wing Lieut. Lawson's olazed tracKs the party carefully
examined the country around Mudgee and then pusned on to
examine the country on the i'albragar River. On the Talbragar
they lound good soil and rich vegetation, out permanent water was
lacking. As all tnrce desiraole things were to be found at Mudgee
tne latter was preierred and Mr. Cox returned to Batnurst to mais.e
preparations for its occupation. He sent for his brother, Mr. Henry
Cox, tnen managing the lamny est ate at Mulgoa, and Mr. Henry Cox
needed no second invitation.
This was early in 1822 and after some delay the brothers got a
mob of 500 cattle together and accompanied oy Messrs.
I ewis, Tom frome, some stockmen and assigned servants, set out
for the new territory. On the sixth day the party camped at the
horseshoe bend of the Cudgegong River .some distance above Broom-
bee and next day Messrs. George and Henry Cox rode forward to
?choose a site for the head station. Passing by the Burrundulla flats,
then an immense swamp covered with reeds and apparently valueless,
then went on until tney reached M enah. This seemed to satisfy an
requirements. There was good land, excellent timber and per-
manent water. Here they decided to settle.
On their way back they found that the men had driven the cattle
along and were camped at the waterhole close to where Bleak House
now stands. This was on February 11, 1822. At daybreak next
morning it was found that the cattle had gone. the party started
out to search for the missing animals, which were found contentedly
grazing in the large swamp which had been passed the day before.
They were driven back, but next morning had broken away again,
and again were found feeding in the fiats which had seemed so
absolutely worthless. This experience so impressed Mr. George
Cox that a few years afterwards he embarked on a scheme of drainage
which by and by turned an ugly reed covered morass into the fertile
flats which now form the Burrundulla estate.
The party moved op down the river to Menah and pitched their
camp beneatfh a huge gum tree close to the river bank. This tree
still 'stands. It will be found a couple of hundred yards below
the Menah homestead and with its great trunk and wide spread of
shapely branches is probably the finest tree in the Mudgee district.
It has recently been dedicated by the present owners, Mrs. McKenzie
and Miss A. J. Cox, to the public.
The erection of huts and stockyards was well in hand. The
site chosen tor these was a rising ground not far from the camp.
The exact spot on which the first buildings in the Mudgee district
were erected is close to the gravel pit which has been dug on the
w 7 est side of the present road, a little past the Menah gate.
As discoverer, Lieut. Lawson was given first choice of country,
and chose the land on the east side of the river, leaving the land on

the west side to the Lieut. Lawson built Lis homestead at
Bombira Hill, just where the present road bends to the right and
portions of the old buildings were still standing at a comparatively
recent date. Messrs. George and Henry Cox and Lieut. William
Lawson were the original settlers of the Mudgee district.
The only trouble of these early days was with the natives.
Owing partly to restrictions on their hunting, partly to punishments
for killing cattle, but chiefly to interference with their gins by some
of the assigned servants, their friendship was changed to hostility.
CAMPING TREE, MENAH.
Where First Settlers in Mudgee District damped.
Lives were lost on both sides and the climax came in a severe
encounter at Guntawang, in which seven white men and many natives
were killed. The encounter was largely brought about by the
cruelty of the manager at Guntawang, a man named Chamberlain.
He was dismissed and when Mr. ?Mick? Lahy, a genial Irishman,
was appointed in his place, the feud soon came to an end.
It was not to be expected that country so fertile and so well
watered as the Mudgee district would be left wholly to the pioneers
and very soon an inflow of new settlers began. The earliest seems
to have been Mr. James Walker, of Wallerawang, who took up L u e.


Page Twenty-foul 4
Then came Mr. Edward Cox, brother to Messrs. George and Henry,
who took up Rawdon; Mr. Robert Fitzgerald, who took up
Dabee, and Mr, ?Billy? Hayes, who took up what is now
the fine Havilah estate. Below Mudgee, Mr. Robert Lowe,
senior, took up the country about Wilbetree and Mr. George
Cox in 1824 and a little later Messrs. Richard and Edwin. Rouse took up
Gurtawang, which had been occupied by the Cox's, but given up
on account of trouble with the natives.
Around Mudgee there were a number of new settlers. Mr. L. V.
Dulhunty, one of the early survey ors in the district,, received a grant
of what is now the Putta Bucca estate; Messrs J. Ascough and James
King and Captain Steel received considerable grants at the West-
end of the present town, while Mr. William Bowman, grandfather
of Mr. George Cadell, of Cockenzie, received a grant of 960 acres at
Ivlullamuddy. In addition to these, members of Lieut. William
Lawson?s family received grants which totalled 6000 acres ; white the
numerous members of the Cox family secured grants in different
parts of the district which amounted in all to 11,000 acres. In 1828
the Cox?s moved up the river, Mr. George Cox to old Burrundulla
and Mr. Henry Cox to Broombee. It was during the three or four
years following that the work of draining the swamp lands along the
river was carried through and thousands of acres of treacherous mud
turned into soil the fertility of which is unsurpassed in the State.

GROWTH OF MUDGEE.
I
i
HE first surveyor to work in the Mudgee district was Mr. Robert
Hoddle, afterwards to gain fame and wealth by laying out the
Jwjry' great city of Melbourne. He seems, however, to have con-
fined himself to delimiting the estates which had grown up in the
neighborhood and it was left for his successor, Mr Richard Lewis, to
choose a site for a village reserve. The site first chosen was the flat
land between the Woolpack Inn and the river, and it was only when
Mr. ?Mick? Lahy, overseer at Menah, warned him of the liability of this
land to flooding, that Mr. Lewis fixed instead upon the fine site upon
which the town now stands.
The reserve must have been dedicated before 1836, for in that
year Mr William Blackman, older brother to James, the explorer, applied
to purchase land upon it for a store. In consequence of Mr. Black-
man?s application the Governor directed that the reserve be measured
with a view to the preparation of a design for a village and this work
was completed by surveyor Ogilvie by the middle of 1837.
In the beginning of 1838 the Surveyor-General submitted a design
based upon the feature survey which had been made. This was ap-
proved by the Governor and on January 12, 1838, the new township
was gazetted under the name of. the ?Village of Mudgee.?
Mr. Blackman s application to purchase land for a store had been
granted before the lay-out of the town was completed and some time
in 1837 he built a slab hut for a store and residence upon the site now
occupied by Bleak House. This was the first house erected in Mud-
gee. The second was a house built by Dr. Toogood farther down the
river and was afterwards carried away by a flood.
The first Government sale of Crown land was held on August 9,

1838, when 20 allotments in the section bounded by Douro, Market,
Court and Mortimer Streets were put up to' auction in Sydney. Of
these 18 were sold and a list of the purchasers may be of some historical
interest.
Mr. William Blackman bought nine allotments; Laban White, a
Windsor auctioneer who, at this time, was renting ?Clarendon,? the
Windsor property of Mr. William Cox, bought four; Messrs. John Mon-
tague, I. L. Lincoln, Daniel Dickens (all old soldiers), Michael Hogan
and Mrs. Ellen Mungan each bought one. Several of these purchases
were forfeited for non-payment of the deposits and when re-offered for
sale in the next year the new purchasers were Messrs. John Hatfield,
Charles Crispin and John Ireland.
After this sale there was considerable progress in building, for a
census taken in March, 1841, shows that there were, at that date, 36
houses in the town. There also seems to have been something ap-
proaching a boom in the building of hotels. The first ?the Mud,gee Hotel
as it was called ?was built by Mr. William Blackman in the neighbor-
hood of the present Court House and is still standing.
In 1841 a second, known as the ?Bushman?s Arms,?? was built by
Mr. W. E. Sampson and in the same year Mr. W. J. Mills opened the
?Cottage of Content? Hotel, about where Miss Lonergan?s boarding
house now stands. A year or two later Mr. J. T. Mills opened the
?Tradesman?s Arms? and Mr. G. Vile built the ?Welcome Inn? at the
corner of Lawson and Market Streets. Mr. Thomas L?Estrange
succeeded Mr. Vile in the occupancy of the Welcome Inn and in 1847
extended his business by opening up a general store, known as the
?Beehive Store,? on an adjoining site.
Still the township was growing but slowly. As late as 1851 the
population was under 200. But in that year things began to move more
rapidly. For one thing, the estates of Messrs. William Lawson and
George Cox were cut up and leased to tenant farmers, thus increasing
the agricultural population. But of more importance still as a stimulus
to growth was the discovery of gold by Mr. Hargraves in 1851.
At first the rush of gold seekers from Mudgee to the Ophir and the
Tu"on was so great as to threaten the town?s very existence. At one
time only six adult males were left to carry on its business and the
surrounding estates were also deserted by practically all their free ser-
vants. But with the discovery, later in the same year, of gold at the
Meroo and especially after the famous ?Blackfellow?s Nugget? was
found at Louisa Creek, now Hargraves, not only did those who had gone
away come back, but there was a large influx of new population into
the town and district.
What with this new population and the new wealth that was
pouring in from the surrounding goldfields the town now begah to go on
with great rapidity and soon after 1851 Mudgee, from being a remote
and sequestered hamlet, became an important town known all over the
colony as the centre of a prosperous and growing district. The Hon.
G. H. Cox, in 1856', gave the population of the district in that year as
4208 and of the town as 803. Since then the town has' grown surely
and bears a high reputation in the commercial world for the solidity of
its business affairs.
ROLL OF HONOR.
MUDGEE?S HONOR ROLL is shown in the Town Hall, where
the names, written in letters of gold, as were the deeds of the
men they commemorate, ?appear in eight handsome, massive
and long tablets, on either side of the stage. The record
is not complete, but from this honor roll it is seen that 443 Mudgee men
responded to their country?s call and that 67 paid the supreme sacrifice.
The names of 6 nursing sisters also appear on this memorial tablet.

GOLD DISCOVERY
�HE disovery of payable gold in Australia had a tremendous in-
fluence upon the development of the country as a whole and
particularly upon those districts in which it was found in
great quantities. The first genuine discovery?there had been
sporadic finds at an earlier date?was made by Edward Hammond
Hargraves, in May, 1851, on the Ophir Creek, near 1 Orange. Very soon
after rich gold was also found on the Turon River to the north-east
of Bathurst.
A rush from Mudgee to these places set in which almost depleted
the population of the town. But some of those who stayed behind
became convinced that gold could be found nearer home. Acting on
this conviction a party of five, namely, Messrs. G* H. Cox, Vivian Cox,
C. E. Lowe, C. W. Keele and W. Lewis, set out, on June 30, 1851,
to prospect on the Meroo Creek at a point about sixteen miles from
Mudgee. The party put in five days? work and secured five penny-
weights of gold. It was a meagre reward for all their work, but it was
enough to show that gold was to be found and within a week there
were 150 gold seekers on the spot, some of whom were very sucessful,
notably Messrs. George Vile and George Whale.
As may be supposed, there was considerable excitement at Mudgee
over the discovery and the excitement rose to fever heat when the
news came through that a huge nugget had been found by a native
shepherd at Louisa Creek, now Hargraves. This nugget of gold, called
from its finder, the ?Blackfellow?s Nugget,? weighed over 106 pounds
and amongst the big nuggets found in Australia, notably in Victoria, it
has only been surpassed in weight by one or two.
After this sensational discovery the whole district was thoroughly
prospected. One of the earliest finds was at Pyramul, where the sons
of a shepherd named Price picked up enough yellow specks on the
tracks worn by the sheep to fill a pickle bottle ?specks which their
father recognised as gold. Then came finds in 1857 at Merrendee,
Piambong, Bruce?s Creek, Grattai and Goree, of which the first named
yielded the greatest quantity.
In 1859 further finds were made at Appletree Flat, Green Swamp;
Rats Castle and Guntawang. About the same time gold was' found at
many other places?Maitland Bar, where a nugget of some 267 ounces
was discovered as late as 1887, Avisford, Long Creek, Clarke?s Creek,
Campbell?s Creek, Nuggety Gully, Stony Creek and Hatten's Creek.
Other places might be added, but these are sufficient to show the won-
derful richness of the Mudgee district in alluvial gold.. All these finds
belong to the earlier days of the gold mining industry in the district.
Claims which were once so rich and which gave work and wealth
to such a large number of men have long ceased to yield more than a
bare subsistence to a few old fossickers and most of them are totally
deserted.
But there were other discoveries of a later date that brought the
district again into prominence. Hill End, with its famous Beyers and
Holtermann nugget, valued at �lO,OOO, is in the district of Bath-
urst, though actually nearer Mudgee. Gulgong, however, belongs to
this district and soon after its discovery in 1870 took rank as one of
the leading goldfields of New South Wales.
In seven years it produced no fewer than sixteen tons of gold,
much of it in the Black Lead and the Happy Valley Head, both exceed-


Page Thirty-six
ingly rich. There were also rich claims in the surrounding district;
at Home Rule and still more at Canadian Lead, where, from No. 1
claim, seven men, in three years, obtained, clear of all expenses, gold
to the value of �28,000 and from No. 2 claim, where six men, during
two years, realised �16,000 nett.
Even in Gulgong and Canadian, however, gold mining Is practically
a thing of the 'past. Like the older fields which have been mentioned
they have had their day and ceased to be. Is it to be said that gold
mining in the Mudgee district is dead never to revive, or are we to
hear of fresh discoveries which will rival those of old and set the tide
of wealth flowing once more with something of its former volume?
Many -'old timers? hold that the bulk of the gold around Mudgee has
never been found.
From 1851 to the end of 1919 no fewer than 1,110,237 ounces of gold,
valued at �4,715,966. were forwarded from Mudgee,. Gulgong and
Hargraves to the Royal Mint, In addition quantities were despatched
during the early rushes of which there is no record.

AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIES.
� *
1
i
?*
fHE Mudgee district has always claimed prominence tor its pas-
toral products, but as soon a s it became more settled and com-
munication bv rail was assured it also leapt into prominence
far- for its agricultural possibilities.. ,
The soil is varied and well suited tor a variety of crops and it is,
on this account, a safe and sure district. For a large belt of country
to be able to depend and confidently rely on several of income
is much to be prefeired to the case of many inland districts, which
have to depend, say, on wool and wheat only.
The lucerne flats along the Cudgegong River and Lawson?s Creek
have been long famous for their fertility and Mudgee lucerne is a
household term among those in search of prime hay. In later years
a large area has been sown with wheat and very successful crops
have resulted. Maize is another crop that does well on the rich river
Hats.
A drive out a mile or two and splendid orchards and vineyards
are seen dotting the landscape, the grapes being most luxuriant.
Their excellence and variety are seen at the annual Agricultural Ex-
hibition and are a source of wonder and delight to all visitors.
There is no place more suited to vine growing than the lower hills
around Mudgee.
In addition to the Mudgee Dairy Company, there is a fine cheese
factory at Belong. The poultry industry is in a very flourishing con-
dition. There are several minor crops that bring in good returns,
such as pumpkins, melons, tomatoes and many others. All varieties
of fruit?apples, pears, peaches, apricots, figs,?are grown and the
possibilities of the district for wine making are almost unlimited.
With regard to the bee industry, the Mudgee district is regarded
as second to none in the State, both/ for quantity and quality of the
honey produced. The district is eminently suitable, as it abounds in
nectar-producing trees, which furnish honey of the highest standard.
Since the advent of the movable-comb hive the industry has
steadily advanced and at the present time there is more interest
taken in it than ever, no doubt largely due to the fact that honey,
nowadays, is fully three times as ex pensive as in pre-war davs. The
outlook tor the industry is bright and there are still any amount of
areas in the district where bees can be kept in large numbers with
profitable results.

MUDGEE?S FINE SHEEP AND WOOL.
tUSTRALIA has distanced all other countries at least in one respect
?the wool produced by its flocks is among the best in the
world. This is owing primarily, no doubt, to her natural ad-
vantages. It is from the merino sheep the finest wool is ob-
tained and the merino thrives magnificently in this singularly mild
climate and on the succulent native grasses and vegetation with which
the pastures usually abound.
But natural advantages are not everything, and it is even more
due to the energy, skill and enterprise of the sheep breeders that Aus-
tralia?s wool has attained its present pitch of excellence.
Mudgee is closely associated with the importation of the first
merino sheep into Australia. Captain Waterhouse, in 1791, brought
Spanish merinos from the Cape of Good Hope to New South Wales
and when leaving in 1830 sold a portion of his flocks to Mr. William
Cox, of Richmond, whose two sons travelled sheep of the same blood
to Burrundulla. The first, however, to establish a stud flock in the
Mudgee district was Mr. James Walker, of Lue.
After the Burrundulla flock came the Rawdon flock of Mr. Edward
Cox, of Ry'lstone, in 1832. Lieutenant William Lawson does not ap-
pear to have had any sheep here till the following year, at which time
Mr. N. P. Bayly was overseer for Lawson and afterwards took up
country at Havilah, founding the flock at present in the possession of
Mr. Hunter White. It is understood that Mr. Bayly commenced
his flock at Havilah with sheep from Lieut. William Lawson?s stud, a
percentage of which he took in lieu of salary. At the time of leaving
Lawson?s employ he had no less than 1000 ewes.
The Rawdon flock, like the Lue flock, was based upon the famous
Riley of Raby strain and though selections were made from the flocks
of Mr. Thomas Neely, Mr. Douglas and Mr. William Cox, it remained
essentially Saxony up to 1849. Experiments were made with the view
of getting greater length of staple and successive introductions of stud
sheep from the Havilah flocks, from Germany, from Tasmania and from
Mr. J. D. Cox?s Cullenbone flock proved so successful that the Rawdon
sheep came to be much sought after by breeders.
Amongst sheep breeders those resident in the Mudgee district held
for long a foremost place. In 1867 Mr. N. P. Bayly, of Havilah, pitted
his clip against the clips of the three most prominent breeders in
Victoria: Messrs. Thomas Learmouth, J. L. Currie and Thomas Shaw,
with the result that while his clip averaged 2/7*4 in the market, theirs
was sold at 2/5*4 and 2/5. In addition to his victory over the leading
sheep breeders of Victoria, some bales of his wool were sold, in 1877, at
the remarkable price of 4/3 per lb. In these circumstancs Mudgee
rams and ewes were much sought after for stud purposes.
At the present day the leading breeder of merino sheep in the Mud-
gee district is Mr. Hunter White, of Havilah, whose father purchased
the estate on the death of Mr. N. P. Bayly. Mr. Hunter White is
known throughout the State as one of its leading experts in all matters
connected with merino sheep and wool and under his care the Havilah
flock has retained, if not increased, the exceedingly high reputation it
has borne for more than two generations.
Other flocks established were those of Mr. C. C. Cox (Broombee),
Mr. George Rouse (Biraganbil), Mr. J. D. Cox (Cullenbone) and Messrs.
T. and A. Cox (Wallinga). Chief among the breeders is the big stud

Kedch). , ' 1
The country determines the type, each ristrict having more or less
marked characteristics peculiar to that locality. Mudgee was inclined
to produce a short, dense, fine clothing type of wool which, for the
moment, seems to have gone out of favor. Speaking generally the
blood is there, good enough for the foundation of a flock to please the
most exacting master who may care to start. Mudgee, in the past,
has gained its fair share of the world?s awards for super-fine wool.
MINING PROGRESS.
MUDGEE and environs contain a great variety of minerals, due,
largely, to the presence of rocks of various geological periods,
seamed with igneous intrusions and granite in varying
forms. This article deals briefly with the district
minerals of present or probable future manufacturing or monetary
value, omitting the many interesting features of purely geological
interest.
Within about forty miles are the goldfields of the Meroo, Long
Creek, Hill End, Hargraves and Gulgong and the opinion may be ex-
pressed that a revival in gold ?lode? mining is possible and that there
is a probability, in the near future, of the working of the continuation
of the alluvial leads where they are deep and wet, necessitating power-
ful pumping plants and the methods employed in the Victorian deep
leads of Creswick and Rutherglen.
The Mines Department, at Home Rule, 14 miles from Mudgee, has
located an extensive deep lead which awaits the attention of the com-
pany promoter. Home Rule is the ?O?Connell Town? of Rolfe Boldre-
wood?s ?Robbery Under Arms,? the author having been mining warden
at Home Rule in its hey day.
Antimony has been mined at Green Swamp and Piambong. Molyb-
denite, mostly too low grade for present extraction, but in all probabil-
ity to be worked profitably when improved methods are used, has been
found in granite country over a wide area around Wilbetree, Havilah,
Botobolar, Cassilis Road (18 mile peg) and MoOlarben. The veteran
prospector, Mr. W. C. Wall, is working the latter deposit.
Tin has been found at Linburn and magnesite occurs at locations
at present inaccesible to profitable transport.
Pigment and white kalsomine clays are being mined at Home Rule
by Messrs. Underwood and another party and umber, at Budgee, by
Mr. A. G. Underwood. White pottery and kalsomine clay has been
supplied for a long period and in large quantities to the leading Sydney
manufacturers by Mr. Wright, of Buccaroo and is also mined by
Messrs. Abernethy and Muller, at Bombira. Barytes has been mined
in considerable quantities for some years at Due and Messrs. Condon
Bros, have recently discovered and worked a deposit at Mullamuddy.
Iron deposits occur at Cassilis Road, Cooyal, also between Pipeclay
and Eurunderee. An extensive and potentially valuable deposit oc-
curs about 18 miles from Mudgee, near Cudgegong, about 8 miles from
Cox?s Siding. Its present comparative inaccessibility has left it un-
exploited. Tallewang, about 10 miles from Gulgong, is the site of
Messrs. Hoskins? iron ore quarry, from which special ore trains leave
daily for Lithgow. Coal has been found at various placfes, such as

Botobolar and tJlan, the nearest to Mudgee being about 16 miles dis-
tant. Some of the seams being alongside extensive limestone deposits
will probably be the site of big cement works.
Kerosene shale exists at various district places such as Barragan
and Ulan and with the high and continually increasing prices of kero-
sene, benzine and lubricating oils, it is a matter for surprise that the
shale sources of these products are not receiving more attention.
Diamonds are obtainable at Reedy Creek, Gulgong and Pine Ridge.
Limestone of high quality occurs in practically inexhaustible
quantities.
Buccaroo has for many years supplied Mudgee and district with
building lime of the highest quality. Wall?s Siding, 10 miles on the
Sydney side of Mudgee, was specially installed for the despatch of
limestone and from it large quantities of lime are sent to Sydney.
At Mount Frome, only four miles from Mudgee, are the quarries
of two companies, each with two D. type kilns, supplying lime both to
Sydney and Newcastle.
Mount Frome is also the site of a proposed big cement works.
The flotation of a company to carry out the proposition is at present
being promoted and the proposed sites, in regard to the railway, the
river, water and limestone, are excellently situated.
The report on the limestones of New South Wales by the Govern-
ment geologists, Messrs. Came and Jones, contains the
following reference to the Mount Frome deposit:
?The outcrops are not prominent, the limestone rarely projecting above
the general surface level, but enormous quantities are undoubtedly
available.? It is stated that a diamond drill bore, put down for ar-
tesian water on a Burrundulla Flat, had penetrated 550 feet into lime-
stone, when boring was discontinued.
Marble, prior to the war, was somewhat extensively quarried on
Messrs. Jennings? property at Cudgegong and also at Carwell and was
liberally employed in the Commonwealth Bank, ?Daily Telegraph? and
other notable Sydney structures.
A quarry at Havilah is about to be opened in rouge-mottled marble,
said by experts to be similar and equal to light Caloola. Blue-black
marble is procurable close to Mudgee.
Messrs. Came and Jones reported on the district
marbles as follows: ??Extensive limestone deposits, which in-
clude beds eminently suitable for use as decorative marble, occur a few
miles east of Mudgee, notably at Mount Frome, Havilah, Mullamuddy,
Queen?s Pinch, Buccaroo, etc. Grey, dove, cream, and variegated red,
with reddish and green breccia, are among the more common varieties.
These desposits have not been commercially exploited for marble.?
Dolomite, which is limestone with a considerable portion of mag-
nesia, is an important item in the manufacture of steel. Australia?s
two largest steel works obtain their dolomite requirements from this
district, Messrs. G. and C. Hoskins being supplied by Messrs. Curlewis,
of Wall?s Siding, the dolomite in this instance being calcined in a cupola
furnace before railing to Dithgow. The Broken Hill Company?s New-
castle Steel Works are supplied with uncalcined dolomite from the ex-
tensive deposits leased by the company from Mr. James Melton.
A siding and two-and-a-half miles of road has been constructed.
A branch railway line has been surveyed to the quarry face,
traversing also about a mile of limestone sub-leased by the company.
A town site on Mr. Hunter White?s property has been surveyed and
divided into residential allotments. Twenty men are employed at this
dolomite quarry, the output for 1919 being 13,000 tons. The limestone
has not yet been operated on. Large deposits exist in this district,
particularly towards Cudgegong, but they are remote from railways.
Messrs. Davidson and Wilkins supply dolomite from Buccaroo.
Copper* and silver lodes have beep worked at various places.

THE firm had its beginning in 1870. when the late Mr. T. H. Marks
bought a storekeeping business at Wellingrove, in the New England
district of New South Wales. He in 1874 removed the business to the
neighboring tin mining tow n of Emmaville, which was at that time
called Vegetable Creek. In 1876 he bought a business at Inverell,
where he remained until 1884; and o n the Ist August. 1885. he acquired
the oldest business at Mudgee, being that of Dickson and Sons (estab-
lished in 1851), which was carried on in premises situated at the
south-eastern corner of Market and Lewis Streets. The business was
removed in 1891 to the present premises situated at the south-eastern
corner of Market and Church Streets. Mr. Marks died at Mudgee on
6th July, 1893, and since then the business has been carried on by his
widow and family.
The firm holds very large and well assorted stocks of all kinds
of merchandise and deals in Farm Produce, Wool, Furs, Skins and
Hides; and its motto is:
There?s no Marking Time at

Travertine, the nearest Australian substitute for English whiting, exists
in large and small deposits, but owing to discoloration its mining has
so fai been unprofitable. Asbestos, although of a poor marketable
kind, has recently been discovered and prospectors are searching for
better quality. Gypsum occurs in two places. A Mudgee resident has
a talc deposit and cinnabar is found in the district.
COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIES.
� COMMERCIALLY Mudgee has made steady progress since the
first settlement. Three of the principal business houses now
in existence are old established, one in the sixties and two in
the seventies. They have carried on business operations un-
interruptedly.
The firm of Messrs. W. Kellett and Sons, Ltd., was established by
Mr. William Kellett, in 1859, in premises situated in Market Street
West. Steady and solid progress was made. Later he formed his
business into a limited liability company and moved to new premises,
built with every modern convenience for the conduct of an up-to-date
country store. Since then, the business has been conducted by his
sons, Mr. John K. Kellett and Mr. W. Fred. Kellett, assisted by Messrs,
Keith and Ralph Kellett, sons of Mr. J. K. Kellett.
The firm of James Loneragan (Mudgee) Co. was established by the
late Mr. James Loneragan, in 1870, in lYallerawang. He afterwards
opened branches in Lithgow, Capertee and Mudgee and, in 1882, came
to Mudgee and conducted the business until his death in 1914. He
was assisted by his sons, Messrs. J. Edward, Richard J. and P'rancis
J. Loneragan. Branches were opened at Gulgong and Dunedoo, and
a large flour mill was built at Gulgong and conducted successfully.
The stores are all modern and are run on the most progressive lines.
The firm of Messrs. T. H. Marks and Co. began business in Mudgee
by buying out the old firm of Dickson and Sons in 1886. Mr. T, H.
Marks was formerly in business in Inverell and when he purchased
Messrs. Dickson?s business he realised that the trade centre of the town
had moved to Church and Market Streets. He built commodious
premises on the corner of these two streets and successfully conducted
business up to the time of his death, since when it has been managed
by the late Mr. F. J. Bird, afterwards by the late Mr. J. W. Duessbury
and later by Mr. J. C. Marks, who took over the management and was
joined by his brother, Mr. James H. Marks. The business is a well
conducted and successful country store.
The Mudgee Butter Factory commenced operations in Lawson
street in 1889. Later, a fine brick building was erected, to which
was added a very up-to-date refrigerating and ice-making plant. This
factory has been of considerable benefit to the district, as it distributes
ready money to over two hundred and twenty suppliers every month.
The shareholders have also received regular annual dividends since the
inception of the company. ,
Away back in the sixties the Mudgee Brewery was established, the
premises first used being situated near Burrundulla in the first flour
mill building. I n the eighties the company removed to a spot in Law-
son Street, where operations have been carried on ever since. From
that period up to the present the company has changed hands many
times, but it has always conducted a successful business, the quality
of the product always being uniformly good.

MUDGEE BREWERY.
This brewery is one of the few survivors of the once numerous
country breweries, its production being popular in Mudgee. In 1918
the Mudgee 'Guinness? was awarded first prize by the Royal
Agricultural Society of N.S.W. for the best Australian Bottled Stout.

i AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION
j ?? - ?
Page Forty-six
f'-TE Mudgee district soon became noted for its pastoral and
agricultural possibilities and it was not long before those
interested decided on holding a show.
An Association was formed and the first meeting was held
in pens erected for the occasion in the market reserve (now Robert-
son Park) on April 22, 1846. It was stated that the cattle exhibited
were of the finest description and that no district in the colony
produce any superior. The members of the first committee were
Messrs. Robert Lowe, Henry Bayly, N. P. Bayly, Edwin Rouse, G. H.
Cox and W. H. Lowe, who was hon. secretary and treasurer.
All the shows held in the district prior to 1861 were financed by
contributions only, but in that year a Society was founded on the basis
of an annual subscription and the first show under the new conditions
was held at Putta Bucca on May 4, 1861. Hon. G. H. Cox was
elected president, Messrs. Robert Lowe, George Rouse and N. P. Bayly
vice-presidents, Mr. W. H. Oliver treasurer, Mr. W. Howarth hon. sec-
retary, with a working committee of thirty members.
The following year, 1862, the show ground was shifted to a piece
of land granted by Messrs. G. H. and A. B. Cox for a term of 99
years at a nominal rent. This land adjoins the railway line on the
east of the line and is now in the possession of Miss Love. Success-
full exhibitions were held here for many years until the year 1881,
when an opposition society was started. The following year, how-
ver, wiser counsels prevailed and the two bodies amalgamated, form-
ing the Agricultural, Pastoral, Horticultural and Industrial Association.
Since then the present show ground has been in use and the
modern and fine buildings go to show that the agricultural and pas-
toral industries have been well catered for. The Hon. G. H. Cox was
president until his death in 1901, when Mr. H. A. Lowe was appointed
and held office until his death. On February 4, 1905, Mr. V. D. Cox
was appointed president and still holds office.
There are many features that make the show the great success it
now is, chief amongst these being the grand combined school exhibit,
which teaches the children the importance of primary production and
the value of technical education generally.
MUDGEE RUGBY FOOTBALL UNION.
r J v HE Mudgee Rugby Football Union held a very successful season last
year. This flourishing union comprises twelve different clubs,
six of which competed in the first grade competition, namely,
Diggers, Our Boys, Waratahs, Gulgong Oaks, Rylstone and Kandos.
The competition was won by Kandos, with the Waratahs runners up,
and Our Boys third. Four teams competed in the second grade com-
petition, viz.?High School, Our Boys, Waratahs and Rylstone, the win-
ners being the High School team, with Rylstone runners up. The
local ground is at Victoria Park and the chief matches draw large
attendances.

MR. W. W. (?DAD?) MILLETT.
?It may be and I hope it will be, that I will join the big ?Meet at
Mudgee in March,? ? said Mr. W. W. (?Dad?) Millett, when seen in
Sydney in December.
Mr. Walter William Millett arrived in Sydney on a ?wind jammer?
from England in the early part of 1848, being then 19 years of age.
Responding to the ?call of the bush,? he settled at Bathurst, after-
wards going to Palmer?s Oakey, in 1872, as a general storekeeper,
butcher and buyer of the precious metal.
On one occasion young Millett left Oakey Creek to go to Bathurst.
Towards dusk he reached a spot where two burly fellows jumped from
behind a stump. ?Bail up!? rang out in the silence of the bush. Mr.
Millett was well mounted and instead of stopping plunged into the
heart of the trees. Shots were fired, but Mr. Millett got away and
reaching the residence of ?Bill? Cummins, the old Western member, was
driven to Bathurst, where the doctor extracted thirteen No. 3 shots from
his back
In 1874 Mr. Millett ?struck? Mudgee, lured by the impetus given the

JOINS IN AND

The Business of Jas. Loneragan (Mudgee Co.) is more
than a shop?it?s a district institution. Its interests are
bound up very closely with the district?s interests.
Just on 50 years ago it started in a modest way and
worked up by slow, but sure, degrees to its present
strong commercial position.
.It is essentially a trading centre for the people ?it is
a people?s institution.
Whatever you wish to buy by way of general house-
hold goods you can buy advantageously. Whatever you
have to sell in the way of district products you can sell
advantageously.
The way to test us is to try one month?s business.

MR. EDWARD BARTON.
Born in Market Street, Mudgee, March 27, 1845, Mr. Edward
Barton is one of the oldest men born here. His father came from
Ireland in 1842, in the same ship as Leichhardt, the explorer. In
tne same year he was appointed chief constable of the town, after-
wards resigning to engage in farming at Putta Bucca.
Mr. Edward Barton carried stores from Sydney to Mudgee for
Mr. Peter Dickson in 1859 and was married here to Miss Mary Jane
Phillips in 1875. He has six sons and two daughters and lives on

MR. EUGENE DALY.
If he had a home of his own, Mr. Eugene Daly, 87 years old,
mentally as active as ever he was, physically in pretty good shape,
and one of the oldest identities of Mudgee, says he would like to live
in Sydney and ?get about on the ferries and take trips on the rail-
way.? But instead he is spending his time visiting his sons and
daughters and now only makes Mudgee his headquarters ?in between. 7 ?
Born in London, he came here from Sydney in 1852 and engaged
in butchering and stock, afterwards going into the hotel business.
For close on twenty years he kept the Club House Hotel, which, with
the shop property adjoining, he still ow r ns. An alderman for several
years, he was one of the pioneers of the District Racing Club. _ He
married a daughter of Mr. John Healy, of Lue and seven of their ten
children are still living.
Mudgee was only a bush track when Mr. Daly arrived, Market
Street being the only road and few people were then in the town or
district. He saw Lewis Street, the old coach road from Sydney to
Coolah, come into existence and has a store of interesting reminis-
cences connected with the development and life of the town.

fHE following are details of the manner in which the municipality
of Mudgee came into existence: ?
Under an Act of Council, on July 25, 1843, a Shire district
was proclaimed which embraced the counties of Wellington,
Phillip and the southern portion of the county of Bligh. A warden
and nine councillors were elected. The warden was Mr. Henry Bayly
and the councillors Messrs. Charles Wray Finch, Robert Lowe, Charles
George Temple Chauvel, George Cox, William Lowe, John Arthur
Templer, Nicholas Paget Bayly, William King, M.D. and William
Blackman.
In May, 1845, three of the members?Messrs. Chauvel, Cox and
William Lowe,?retired under the provisions of the Act and two re-

dition, ? and that innumerable stumps and logs everywhere impeded
the thoroughfare. The amount was expended on Market Street, then
the only thoroughfare of note in the locality and the tender of Mr.

Atkinson in June, 1859 and named the ?Holyoak Bridge? in com-
pliment to Mr. Lyttleton Holyoak Bayly, Attorney-General in the

fHE Municipality of Cudgegong came about as the result of a
number of ratepayers who lived outside the boundaries of the

Cudgegong was proclaimed July 21, iB6O. In the place of Mr. Robert
Lowe, who resigned, Mr. W. Howarth was appointed returning- officer.

EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
i - i
? *
!3jf Public school at Mudgee was erected by the Council ot
WHI blducation in 1855, on a site of two acres granted by the
government. At the close of the first year the enrolment
reached 62, with an average attendance of 42. In 1859 addi-
tions to the original building were made. In . 1876 an addition was
made of 2 roods adjoining, two acies more were secured in iqoq and
no roods in iqio. In 1877 a new school building was erected, cost-
�39lo. Additions were made to this building in 1896 and 1903
the cost being �1212 In 1909 tfie school buildings were rem.cde.ieu
and a separate building was provided) to r science and manual train-
ing, this work costing ,�lB4O.
T he school was successively raised to the status of Superior and
Uistiict School, and for a number of years it provided a course ot
secondary education to those pupils who desired to continue their

studies beyond the primary course. In 1913 the department decked
to provide better facilities for secondary education and a high school
for this centre was decided upon. A sitd of two acres, with front-
ages to Horatio and Douro Streets, was purchased and the new
high school building was erected, at a cost of about �6OOO.
Towards the end of 1883 settlement in the southern portion ot
tb ; town warranted the establishment of an additional school there
and the new school came into operation early in 1884, the first build-
ing- used being the Methodist Chapel and Miss Hmily Thurston
being the first teacher. The first departmental school building was
erected at Mudgee South in 188G and in 1912 a new school building
was opened.

.the quarter ended September 24 last was 584 (boys, 188; girls, 194:

MUDGEE HOSPITAL.
The Hospital i s situated rear the Railway Station
HISTORY OF HOSPITAL.
JN the early days Mudgee patients had the choice of being sent to
Bathurst or of awaiting the arrival of a medical man. To overcome
the difficulty a small slab building was erected close to the river, at
he western corner of Cox Street. For a time it served the purpose,
but, as the population increased, better accommodation was necessary
and by December, 1842, Dr. King was administering a private hospital
m Mortimer Street, opposite the Presbyterian Chapel, on an allot-
ment owned by Mr. George Cox.
In April, 1852, at a public meeting held at Naughton?s Inn, it was
decided to provide a public hospital in the town and Messrs. Henry
Cox, William Blackman and Thomas L?Estrange were appointed
trustees, with a committee to carry on the managmeent. The build-
ing was erected on the site of Dr. Nickoll?s surgery, Perry Street. The
foundation stone of the present building was laid on November 17,
1874. Mr. R, Dobie Bawden is the president.

H. C. Brimsmead, comptroller-general of aviation, and Lieut.-Col.
Oswald Watt, assistant to Col. Brimsmead, who was in charge of the

that fiom this town to the Gulf of Carpentaria forced landings could be

That Col. Watt is very favorably impressed with Mudgee?s
claims is evident from the fact that he is understood to be likely to
make a strong recommendation on behalf of Mudgee.

CHURCHES OF MUDGEE
ANGLICAN.
T HE building of the original Anglican Church (St. John?s), the first
erected in Mudgee, was commenced in 1839 and finished in 1841
It was an unpretentious structure of brick, capable of accommodating
100 and it is significant of the character of the surrounding popula-
tion of that date that most of the worshippers to be provided for were
assigned servants.
The first incumbent was the Rev. James Gunther, whose chief
centre was Wellington and who only conducted service in Mudgee on
one Sunday in each month. in 1843, however, Mr. Gunther was
appointed exclusively to the Mudgee district and for the next thirty-

Roman catholic.
HE first Roman Catholic Church was built in the early forties and
like many of the buildings of that time, had walls of slabs and a
bark roof. Occasional services were given by the Rev. Father
Dunphy, who used to come all the way from Bathurst. He would have
received the permanent appointment to the district if he had lived,
but met his death by being swept off his horse in attempting to cross
the river at Appletree Flat when it was in high flood.
The successor to Father Dunphy and the first actual incumbent
of St. Mary?s was the Rev. Father Callaghan M?Carthy, whose in-
duction took place about 1848. He remained in charge till 1867 and so
won the goodwill of all classes that when a testimonial was presented
to him on his departure, not only was it largely subscribed to by
members of the Protestant churches, but the treasurer of the move-
ment was actually a prominent member of the local Orange Lodge.
Father M?Carthy, who was one of the victims of the terrible railway
accident at Redfern, on October 31, 1894, was succeeded by the Rev.
Father O?Donovan, who died in Mudgee, April 24, 1912, after being 44
years in charge of St. Mary?s. The Rev. Father E. J. Flanagan is at
present in charge.
The present church was began in 1857 and the opening ceremony
took place on March 4, 1860.
ST. MARY?S CHURCH.
Corner of Market and Church Streets, Mudgee.
The Philharmonic Society gave its first concert in Mudgee in
December, 1861.
The Salvation Army Hall was erected in 1889. The order has a very
active membership.
For a period of sixty years building societies have played a pro-
minent part in Mudgee and it is questionable if any other town its
size in the Commonwealth or New Zealand can show an equal record.

METHODIST
METHODIST services were begun in the district by the Rev. John
Pennell. He arrived in 1851, when the gold fever was at its
height and the town was so thronged with diggers and speculators
that there was no room for him in any of the decent hotels and he
used to tell how he spent his first night in Mudgee on the bare floor o
a room put at his disposal by some good Samaritan.
The first church was a modest structure, which cost �SOO but the
present church, which was opened on May 26, 1863, cost over �3OOO
and it says the good feeling existing between the members
of the different churches that the largest subscriber to the building

THE TURF AT MUDGEE
IN January, 1842, a number of racing enthusiasts met at the Mudgee
Hotel to arrange for the holding of a meeting and the first races
were held in May, upwards of 1500 being present on each of the three
days. Some of the best ?bits of blood? in New South Wales com-
peted, a bay ge?ding, named Jorrocks, particularly distinguishing him-
self. This horse, who died as sound as he was the day he was foaled,
contested 94 events during his career and won 60.
The first races were held on the river flat behind the Putta Bucca
Homestead, but the course was too soft, and a change was made to
Munna, from there to Oakfield and in 1861 to the present course. The
original stewards were Messrs Henry Bayly, Richard Rouse, Robert
Lowe and William Lowe. Captain Furlong, P.M., was judge, Mr.
Mills clerk of course, Mr. N. P. Bayly hon. treasurer and Mr, W.

EARLY CRICKET IN MUDGEE.
'J?HE first Mudgee Cricket Club was formed in December, 1854, with
Mr. Sam Blackman as treasurer, Mr. George Walker secretary and
Mr. T. B. Rossitter umpire. The first cricket match was played on
Market Square on Anniversary Day, 1855, with nine men on each side,
the winning team scoring a single innings victory. The scores were
as follows:
Cane, b S. Blackman, 0; Oxley, b S. Blackman, 27; Tuckerman,
run out, 5; Hassall, run out, 1; Phillips, run out, 4; Fowler, b Honcy-
sette, 3; Stitt, b Blackman, 2; Burwood, b Blackman, 4; Mote, not out,
2; total 48. Second Innings?Cane, run out, 4; Oxley, b Blackman?
10; Tuckerman, c Milne, 8; Hassall, c Walker, 6; Phillip, c Honeysettc?
9; Fowler, run out, 2; Stitt, b Honeysett, 2; Mote, run out, 0; Burwood*
not out, 9. Total 49.
Their opponents scored:?Blackman, b Oxley. 24; Honeysett, sen.,
c, 43; Walker, c, 19; Honeysett, jun., b Cane. 7; Milne, b Cane, 9;
Purdy, b Cane, 7; Hayes, run out, 2; Sharpe, b Oxley, 0; Hassall, not
out, 0. Total, 111.
Cricket, in later years, was worthily upheld by members of the
Lowe, Cox, Wilton, Honeysett and the Ravner families and matches
against Wellington and Bathurst were always looked forward to.
Competition cricket has been intermittently played in the district with
Mudgee as its centre: Mudgee, West End (Mudgee). Hill End, Cob-
bora, Spicer?s Creek, Rylstone. Limestone and other clubs taking
part.
There is a Mudgee District Cricket Association, under which body
a competition has been carried on. The competition in 1919-20 was
won by the Mudgee Independents. Home and home matches were
played between Mudgee and Wellington last sctfcjon, Mudgee winning
at Wellington and Wellington winning, later on, at Mudgee.
Mudgee boasts a very pretty cricket ground almost in the centre
of the town, on which competition matches are played, the wicket being
of matting, on soil closely resembling the famous Bulli soil There
is a spacious grandstand, with shower bath and dressing room for
the players underneath.
SLATE QUARRY HAS FUTURE.
�* S� o( i quality and the desired color are a desideratum o;
the Sydney building trade.
At Grattai, about 12 miles from Mudgee, is situated the quarry of
the Mudgee Slates Company, managed by Mr. Griffith W. Williams.
-Ir. Williams, who has had experience in Wales and of Australian slates
m South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales, says Grattai slates
are superior to any of them. Its color is dark blue and in chemical
analysis, appearance and structurally, is equal to the best Welsh, which
is the standard of high quality.
With the aid of competent workmen Mr. Williams is now testing
the rock by splitting, dressing it into roofing slates and preparing from

brine tubs. He is also systematically testing the best methods of ex-
tracting the slate blocks, to which end an electric block cutter is being
installed.
The slate body is 1200 feet wide and over half a mile long and as
la'-ge quantities are situated above the surface level work can be carried
on with the greatest facility.

T HERE are man y Places in this district named by the aboriginals

knack of nomenclature, a trait which showed consummate art. Fveiy
spot bore aptly distinguishing names.
1 he tribes named their cnildren from ordinary occurrences, whi:h
may have taken place at the birth or soon after. For instance, if a
kangaroo rat were seen to run into a hollow log at that particular time
the child would be named by seme modification of the word for kan-
garoo rat.
At the death of a native a new name would be invented, taken
from an animal, or a tree or camping? ground, also from any physical
i 2 if Ur - e ? as having a 'big mouth, a prominent rose, or any other part
of heir anatomy and from that of a bird or animal uttering a peculiar
cry that might be passing by.
