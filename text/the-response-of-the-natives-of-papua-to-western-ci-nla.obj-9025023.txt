The Response of the Natives of Papua
to Western Civilization.
■
The Primitive must Respond or Perish.
r 1 1HREE races of mankind, the white, the red,
JL and the black, met in America. The white
man gave the others the choice of slavery
or death; and the red man chose death
iH and black man slavery.* In other
words the black man responded to the stress
of altered circumstances, and the red man did not. This
gruesome precedent teaches that the Papuan too must
respond to the stimulus of Western civilization, or he too
will die, engulfed in the maelstrom of economic and cultural
progress which has suddenly swept upon him. I should
be sorry to think that the only alternative was slavery;
but death is the certain penalty if he refuses to adapt
himself to the change.
Difficulty of Understanding' Primitive People.
It can very seldom happen that a man of European
race and culture can know a primitive people well enough
to be able to describe their response to our civilization;
the best that most of us can hope to do is to seize upon a
few isolated instances, and to endeavour, in a tentative
way, to draw conclusions from them. It has been said
that there is a close resemblance between the Indonesia of
the present day and the Europe of the Middle Ages, and, if
we wish to realize the difficulties which surround a study of
Indonesian culture, we have only to remember how des-
perately hard it is to grasp the spirit of the Middle Ages,
*Bruce, “Broad Stone of Empire,” Vol. 1., p. 387,


in spite of the libraries of books that have been written
about them. Still more difficult is it to understand the
Papuan, who corresponds more or less closely to the man
of the early neolithic culture.
“Thinking' Black.”
And it seems to me that in the attempted application
of anthropology to the art of government there is always
this difficulty, that we are inclined to treat questions both
of anthropology and of administration as if they were
merely matters of academic interest; with the result that
we cannot really put ourselves in the place of the native
whose welfare is at stake, though we may like to persuade
ourselves that we can. I have friends in Papua whom I
have seen “reacting ” to the stimulus of an alien civiliza-
tion practically everyday for the last twenty years, and,
apparently, “reacting” very favourably, but I cannot claim
to have any clear idea of the nature or extent of their
“reaction.” But I know that they, and the Papuans
generally, have a difficult task before them; for, in order
that they may give a full and favourable response, they
must begin by knowing something about us, a people as
different from themselves, both outwardly and inwardly,
as it is possible for human beings to be. The appreciation
of an alien culture is a task which is hardly accomplished
even with the aid of books, newspapers and other records;
I cannot even guess how hard it may be to a race that
cannot read.
We know that the gift of “ thinking black ” is a rare
gift, bestowed on very few; * but is it more difficult than
the art of “ thinking white,” which the native must master
if he is to give a fitting “ reaction ” to our alien stimulus?
Reaction is Mutual.
Of course, as the native “ reacts ” to us, we must, in
however small a degree, “ react ”to him also. But it is we
*See e.g., Hartland, “Bitual and Belief,” p. 24.


who call the tune; the native must dance to it, for we, as
the stronger race, demand far more adaptation from him
than we ever dream of giving ourselves. It has been said
that the first effect of the meeting of the primitive and the
white man is the demoralization of both parties, and this
seems to be true enough; the primitive meets a superior
being against whom his best protection is deceit, and the
white man, who perhaps never had a dog to order about
before he left home, suddenly finds himself with servants
ready to do his bidding.* The result is likely to be
deplorable in the case of both; the one tends to become a
sneak and the other a bully.
Still the white man and the primitive have to live
together, and they must accommodate themselves to the
situation. But the position is far more difficult for the
latter than for the former, for it is on the primitive that
the chief burden of adaptation lies, and it is he who, from
his ignorance, is the less capable of bearing it.
The story of the mutual adaptation is sometimes a
brutal, a bloodstained, and a very sordid one; but in the
particular case of Papua it has been less so than in some
other parts of the world. This is due partly to the fact
that our early settlers were on the whole a law-abiding lot
of men, and partly to the fact that during the last century
a great change came over our attitude towards native races,
and the European settlement in Papua, or (as it was then)
British New Guinea, did not begin until the change had
been for some time in operation. Consequently in Papua
we have been spared that bitter hostility, followed by sullen
resignation, that has been found in some other places.
Differences between Primitive Culture
and Our Own.
Now what is the nature of this stimulus which I have
mentioned —the stimulus applied to an inferior race by the
sudden impact of our civilization ? What are the out-
standing differences between the two cultures, our own and
*See Willoughby, “Problems of the New Africa,” p. 228.


the Papuan? Well of course ours is a grander and finer
culture altogether; our civilization is more stately, more
spacious and more massive than anything the Papuan could
possibly conceive ; our national and political ideas cannot
be comprehended by him, his art is rudimentary in the
extreme, science for him is magic, and for him literature
does not exist. Thus one may say that, on the higher
cultural plane, the Papuan and the European do not meet,
except so far as the Papuan is induced to adopt the
European religion, and that, with that exception, the
Papuan makes no response at all on this higher plane. It
is in the ordinary practical everyday life that the two
cultures do meet, and there alone. And, if we had to
compare the typical Australian or European with the
Papuan, as they appear in this everyday life, we should say,
I suppose, that the chief difference was that the former was
characterized by superior energy, enterprise and industry;
that the Papuan was inferior in these respects, that he was
mediocre and undistinguished, and that he suffered from
what has been called la dehilite dc la personnalitL
Also we might say that the white man had ideas of
justice and government that the Papuan had never dreamt
of. On the other hand we might be reminded that dev
Handlende ist imints-gewissenslos , and it might be suggested
that the white man is ruthless in the pursuit of economic
advantage, and oppressive to those whom he has in his
power; but these very unpleasant qualities would weigh but
lightly in the balance against the murderous raids of the
Papuan, his eternal vendetta, his cannibalism and his head
hunting.
I have many good friends among the Papuans, in whose
country I have lived for nearly 25 years, but I must admit
that they had much to learn from the white man. The
question is have they learnt it, and how ? Certainly the
lesson has been a hard one, and the invasion of Papua by
our civilization has been accompanied by many disturbances
of native life. These I may distinguish as (i) moral or
psychical; and (ii) material. The material disturbance is
seen clearly enough, in connection, chiefly, with the


introduction of metals and the establishment of peace ; the
moral or psychical can be traced in the breaking up of the
old village life, the abandonment of the old customs and
traditions, and the weakening of the moral of those who
have to struggle through life without the protection which
those customs and traditions afford.
Conscious and Unconscious Adjustment.
These disturbances in the life of the Papuan are caused
by the reaction of his culture to ours, and by his attempt to
adjust the one to the other; and the attempt at adjustment
is either (i) conscious and intentional, or (ii) unconscious.
The -conscious adjustment is largely, though not
altogether, concerned with external matters, and is more
obvious and more easily controlled than the unconscious
adjustment. As instances I may mention such matters as
the use of steel knives and axes instead of stones and shells,
of sails made of canvas instead of bark and leaves, and the
substitution generally of our implements for their own.
And then on the spiritual plane we have the adoption of
Christianity, and the eagerness to learn to read and write,
and to master the English language ; not, be it understood,
the hideous jargon known as “ pidgin English,” but the
ordinary conversational English, more or less undefiled,
that is presented to the Papuan by the settler from
Australia or elsewhere.
So far the influence is all to the good, but with the
good comes the bad, for it must be admitted that the white
man’s example is not always edifying. And here I tread
upon dangerous ground. I have lived for many years,
and hope to live for many more, among the white men of
Papua, and who am I that I should call attention to the
less admirable of their qualities ? Let me say then, in
general, that white men are not always courteous in
their manner, that their standards of art are not always of
the highest, that there are other weak joints in the armour
of their culture, and that the native is likely to imitate
these weaknesses. Drunkenness, the worst, perhaps, of the


lessons that the inferior race has learned from the superior,
has, fortunately, had little attraction for the Papuan.
The white men of Papua are, as a rule, abstemious, but it
would be idle to maintain that we are all teetotallers;
consequently the native has had the opportunity to acquire
habits of intemperance, but luckily he has had the sense
to abstain. And it is possible that his powers of abstinence
have been reinforced by the fact that he is severely punished
even for having liquor in his possession. So, in the same
way, the use of European clothes, which some observers
consider the most harmful of all our gifts,* has never been
so common as to constitute a danger; and here again the
native conservatism of the Papuan is fortified by the
prospect of fine or imprisonment if he is caught wearing
European clothes without a permit.
The instances that I have given of conscious imitation
are not intended to be exhaustive ; they are merely illustra-
tions. Most of them make for an increase of industrial
efficiency and are calculated to lead to a higher civilization,
but some of them have after effects which raise very serious,
questions.
For instance the substitution of steel for stone enables
the Papuan to do his work in much less time than it used
to take, and in consequence his life, which in his native
state was fairly well filled, has now become comparatively
empty. The natives of the Northern Division are neither
more nor less industrious than the average, and it has been
calculated that a full day’s work for a native of this
Division may be taken as covering about 4 hours, including
dances and festivals and preparations for them; and for a
woman about the same. But when he had only stone
implements, which he must make himself, and when he
lived in a state of constant though intermittent warfare,
the hours would be much longer.
*See e.g., the Reverend W. J. Durrad, “ Essays on the Depopulation of Melanesia,” p. 7;
Willoughby “ Race Problems in the New Africa,” p. 132.


Disintegration of Native Life.
And it is here that the great danger arises—the
danger that the native, while responding fairly well to our
civilization in all that makes life easier, may fail to respond
to it at all, in so far as it supplies means for the profitable
employment of the time saved from the long hours of
labour, that were formerly necessary for the maintenance
of village life.
It is as true now as it w r as in the days of Dr. Watts
that “ Satan finds some mischief still for idle hands to
do,” and this increase of leisure is to be deplored, unless
the administration or the missions forestall the Evil One,
and find some useful occupation to fill those empty hours.
And it is at this critical point that we see the combined
effects of all the attempts, both conscious and unconscious,
that the native makes to adjust himself to his new environ-
ment. He has adopted our tools and abandoned village
warfare, and so works quicker while at the same time he
has less to do, and now he is led, often unconsciously, to
the disintegration of village life by the abandonment of his
old customs and traditions. Many of these customs are
anti-social and have nothing to recommend them except
that they are of interest to anthropologists; but others
have a social value, and native life is the poorer for their
loss. It is a commonplace among administrators nowadays
that native customs, so far as they are not actually
harmful, should be preserved; and this has always been
our policy in Papua, though it was by no means a common-
place when the Australian Commonwealth assumed control
in 1906. But, however hard you may try, it is impossible
to preserve native custom in its entirety or in anything
like its entirety. Its disappearance is part of the Papuans’
“ reaction ” or response. Any administrator will agree
that in a country like Papua every white man and woman
has a solvent effect upon native life. Even the amateur
anthropologist, w T ho is loudest in his clamour for the
preservation of native custom is, by the mere fact of his
residence in the country, contributing his share towards
that custom’s dissolution.


Many, though by no means all, native customs must
go, but the tragedy is that those which go first are often
the best. It is a bad thing when a native loses interest
in his canoe making or his gardening, and it may seem a
paradox to say that it is still worse when he loses faith in
the magic which controls those activities. But the Papuan
other world is not wholly evil, and it is surely a calamity
when the primitive loses all faith and all belief in a world
of spirits, and finds nothing to put in its place. And just
as the administration must find something either to stimu-
late or to take the place of his waning interest in his
garden, so the missionary offers in Christianity something
to fill the gap which has been left by the loss of the old
superstitions, to rekindle the spiritual lights which our
materialism has extinguished.
It is principally on account of this essential service
that missions are held in such high esteem by all adminis-
trators of experience. Certainly, in the case of the Papuan,
his “reaction” to our ideas is purely negative on the
spiritual side; and it will remain negative, hiatus valde
deflendus, unless active steps be taken to provide a new
content.
Alleged Indolence of the Papuan.
It is natural that the primitive should adapt himself
more readily to the use of new implements than to cultural
changes, and the Papuan is certainly much quicker to
make use of our steel axes and knives than to imitate those
habits of industry by which the European has worked out
his salvation. But the indolence of the Papuan can be
easily exaggerated, and it is interesting to notice that he
thinks that we are far lazier than he. “Do you think that
you are a white man,” one native has been heard say to
another, “ do you think that you are a wdiite man that you
sit there and do nothing ?” The difference is that, while
we reproach them with their indolence as a vice, they
envy us ours as the result of a triumph over the obstinacy
of the material world. Doubtless life in the tropics is not


conducive to superabundant energy, but nevertheless I
think that the example of plantation life has taught the
Papuan a lesson in industry, and the effect of sustained
labour. The lesson is, I am aware, hardly learned and
retained with difficulty, but I think that one sees evidence
that it has not been wasted altogether.
Administration.
The administrative lesson has been still more difficult
to learn. The Papuan had nothing to start from, for our
natives, with but few exceptions, had little or no idea of a
powerful chieftainship, or of tribal or even village adminis-
tration, as we understand it. Native life was, in fact,
ordered in a reasonably efficient manner, but how this was
done is a matter of conjecture. Various explanations have
been given, but they are all far removed from our own
ideas of government.
We cannot say how far the Papuan, unaided, would
have “ reacted ” to our methods of administration, or
whether he would have “ reacted ”at all; for in this case
we took the initiative, and forced our system upon him
(of course in a very simple form) by the appointment of
Village Constables to occupy the position which is, ap-
parently, held by Chiefs elsewhere. The establishment
of Village Constables, which was the work of Sir William
MacGregor, may be taken as an assured success; but this
cannot be accepted as evidence of a response to our ideas,
for these Constables are really Government Officials, im-
posed from without, and backed by all the power and
prestige of the government.
More important as evidence of such a response will
be the success of the Village Councillors. These Coun-
cillors are selected by the Villagers themselves and are
intended to give expression to village sentiment, which
the Constable, as a Government Official, might be tempted
to ignore. Gerontocracy was hardly known, even among
our Melanesians, and if these Councillors are a success, as


I have no doubt they will be, they will afford an interest-
ing example of the readiness and ability of the Papuan to
respond to a form of government which was quite strange
to him.
Courts of Law.
Courts of law are another alien institution. There
have been a few sporadic instances of concerted punish-
ment by a whole village, but there were no Courts.
Usually there was no communal action at all; punishment
was left to private vengeance, and a man with powerful
friends could do pretty much as he liked. It has been said
that the fear of the gallows is a much feebler deterrent than
the fear of ghosts, but I do not think that this applies to
the Papuan, who, in his native state, had little sense of
personal guilt, and still less of personal responsibility.
Indeed the strangest feature to him in our legal system was
probably our theory of individual responsibility, and its
striking contrast to his own system of “paying back,” ac-
cording to which a murder is sufficiently avenged by the
death of one of the same village, or even of the same tribe,
as the murderer. It speaks well for the receptivity of the
Papuan that he should have accepted individual responsi-
bility so readily as he has.
One may cavil and poke fun at what has been called
les cldnoiseries de la justice occidentals , but, imperfect as it
is, it is surely better than the wild injustice of the “ pay
back,” or the chance guess-work of the Papuan ordeal.
And indeed our system of administering justice seems to
have made a favourable impression on the Papuan, and
one finds “ Courts ” being held in an informal way among
the Papuans themselves. These “ Courts ” have of course
no power of enforcing their decisions, beyond what sanc-
tion they may draw from public opinion, but they seem to
have an attraction of their own. It would be possible to
mistake them for a survival from the days before European
settlement; they are, however, not a survival, but an imita-
tion.


Social Response.
Socially I think that the Papuan has hardly responded
at all with the exception of those living in mission com-
pounds, or under white supervision elsewhere. European
influence might be expected to affect marriage more than
any other department of native life, for instance by regulat-
ing or prohibiting divorce, by substituting monogamy for
polygamy, and so forth. But in Papua polygamy was
rarely practised on a large scale. There was no looting
of women from hostile villages, for all were killed imparti-
ally, women as well as men and children, there were few
powerful chiefs or rich men, and the women did not exceed
the men in numbers. There were in fact barely enough
women to go round. Mr. Stone, who visited Port Moresby
in 1875, says that it was the exception for the Motu to
have more than one wife. There was a strict rule of
monogamy in the Eastern part of the Gulf of Papua, and,
I believe, in a few other places, but generally speaking
there seems to have been no fixed practice one way or the
other. Christian Papuans have of course only one wife,
but those who are not Christians have not been affected by
their example. The government of course is neutral and
does not interfere at all.
Personally I am glad that the social response has not
been more ready, for it is on the social side that European
influence is likely to be harmful. It is obvious that the
Papuan might learn many useful lessons from our social
life, but unfortunately the primitive races always seem to
find our bad qualities much more fascinating than the
good. For instance our ideas of personal chastity, of the
sanctity of family life, and so forth have but a moderate
attraction for the ordinary native; it is rather on our
looser and less reputable side that the primitive finds our
example so difficult to resist. So far as Papuans are con-
cerned I am inclined to think that neither our good nor
our bad example has had much effect upon them socially.
They are in this respect-very conservative; the social life
of the Port Moresby villages has varied little, if at all,
during the years that I have lived here, and I doubt if it


has varied much since the Protectorate was established in
in the year 1884. It has to some extent been purified by
religion and regulated by law, but in its general features
it has remained the same.
Occasionally however one does get a glimpse of a
change, and of a change for the better. A few days ago,
for instance, a native of Port Moresby was talking to me
on the absorbing subject of pigs, and he expressed genuine
and utter abhorrence at the conduct of some of his fellow
villagers who kept their pigs under their houses —“ living
just like animals ”he said. Formerly this practice would
not have excited comment.
General Response of the Papuan.
The response of the Papuan is shallow, incomplete and
superficial compared with that of more advanced races
elsewhere; but it is nevertheless better than we could
reasonably have expected, seeing that our Government is
hardly more than a generation old, and that less than 50
years ago the Papuan was everywhere, as he still is in
many places, simply a stone age savage.
Four Dominant Principles Distinguishing the
West from the East.
Professor van Eerde,* following Professor Ramsay
Muir, enumerates four dominant principles which he says,
characterize the Western world as distinguished from the
Eastern. These are, to paraphrase his more precise phraseo-
logy, (i) the rights of the individual; (ii) the universal
application of law ; (iii) the voluntary submission of the
individual to the rule of order; and (iv) Parliamentary
self-determination. The rights of the individual and the
universality of law will appeal to the Papuan —indeed they
appeal to him already —but the other two principles will,
I think, always leave him cold. I doubt if he will ever
respond at all to these, and I do not think that it matters
*“Ethnologiecoloniale,” p. 8.


much if he does not; we must take the risk and try to get
him along without them. Faith and courage are essential
to a successful native administration. Du musst glauben,
du musst ivagen , or your administration will be a failure;
and we in Papua have faith that the Papuans, even if they
refuse to respond to the latest political theories, will eventu-
ally, under guidance, develop into a people who will ap-
preciate and adjust themselves to the best that we have
to offer to them.
Response of the Papuan Generally Beneficial.
It is true that there are ways in which the Papuan’s
response may, in the future, be for evil rather than for good,
with results that may make for his spiritual undoing. And
it is the duty of an administrator to recognize these
possibilities without being afraid of them. The Papuan is
in a transition stage. He is crossing the gulf which
divides the Stone Age from the twentieth Century, and it
would be foolish to ignore the dangers that surround his
path. Many of the old traditions that regulated native
life will leave him at last, however long their departure
may be delayed by the efforts which we make for their
preservation, and they may be gone before their place can
be adequately filled by the influences which we hope will
succeed them. Then it is to be supposed that the excite-
ment of tribal warfare finds but a milk-and-water substitute
in the mimic battle of the football field, our policy of
creating village industries is rarely recognized as a genuine
attempt to relieve the monotony and the poverty of village
life, there is, in some districts, a disheartening and ap-
parently inexplicable decrease of population, and one finds
traces in a few, but fortunately only in a very few, parts of
the Territory of a feeling of depression, almost akin to
despair, arising apparently from a presentiment that there
will be no room for the Papuan in the new world of steel
and machinery that is pressing upon him.
I have purposely dwelt upon the dark side of the
picture, and have even painted it blacker than it really is;
but the Papuan’s response has generally speaking not been


such as to justify any gloomy forebodings, and has, on the
whole, been favourable and not unintelligent. There is no
reason to suppose that the total native population has
ever declined, in spite of occasional severe epidemics, and
there is evidence that it is slightly increasing. The native
response to the material side of our culture has been satis-
factory. Gardens are better and bigger, thanks to onr steel
implements, native coastal communication and trade is
faster and better, thanks to our boat building and naviga-
tion, native plantations are more skilfully laid out and
planted, thanks to lessons learned from the white man,
village sanitation is better, thanks to our teaching, and
native life is safer, thanks to the spread of the pax
Britannica , and its general acceptance by the natives.
And there is at least one thing that we can say for the
Papuan, and that is that he shows no tendency to develop
into that truly awful creature, that terrible parody of our
civilization, the black man who pretends to be white.
Fear of Sorcerers and Evil Spirits.
There are a certain number of eccentrics who can see
no good in the white man’s culture, and no evil in the
native’s; these people have rarely had any experience of
natives, but, if they had, they would realize at least one
beneficent and far-reaching effect which European civiliza-
tion has had upon these races. And that is the deliverance
of the native from that agony of fear which pervaded his
life, and which in Papua, through the influence of the
government, the missions, and the white residents
generally, is dying out in the more settled districts. I
do not mean mere ordinary physical fear, I refer to that
unreasoning and devastating terror which comes from the
belief in evil spirits and sorcerers. I never realized what
fear really meant until I saw it in the eyes of a native who
dreaded the vengeance of the sorcerer; and Ido not think
that the superior persons who scoff at missions have any
idea of the good work that the missions in particular are
doing in banishing this awful curse. To say that they are
merely substituting one form of sorcery for another is quite


beside the point. Whether Christianity is true or false
has nothing to do with the question; there remains the
actual fact that the introduction of Christianity makes all
the difference to the Papuan, for it delivers him from the
horror of this great fear. Papuan like African life is
“ demon haunted, crowded with known and unknown
terrors ” ; and disbelief in these, in Papua as in Africa, is
“ the mark of a Christian.”*
The feeling of depression which I have mentioned is
quite a different matter. This depression will pass, because
it is a part of the general strain and stress of the reaction
to our civilization; it will not be felt by future generations,
who will be born into the new environment and will respond
to it more easily. This has been the general experience of
the Pacific, and it will be the experience of Papua also.
Racial Pride.
If a race of beings, as superior to ourselves as we are
to the Papuan, should suddenly appear, claim our allegiance,
and impose upon us a civilization in which we could only
play the humblest parts, I conceive that the best of us
would prefer death to submission. But, fortunately for us,
the Papuan is not so minded. Probably the best of the
Papuans have at first been tempted to resist our advance,
but, when resistance proved hopeless, as it does very soon
in this contest of rifles against sticks and stones, we do
not find that the men who opposed us are harder to
reconcile than the rest. The absence of racial pride is
however a disadvantage to the Papuan on the whole, just
as its excess is a danger to us. Village pride exists and
has occasionally served the cause of civilization, as for
instance in checking cannibalism,f and if we could exalt
it into a national or territorial pride it might be capable of
great things. But this is for the future. For the present
we must be satisfied to work with such qualities as we find
the Papuan to possess, and we must not ask too much, or
expect too ready a response from these savages of yesterday.
