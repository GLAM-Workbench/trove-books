OUT IN THE SOUDAN.
CHAPTER I.
THREE ACTS IN THREE LIVES.
1739-
Two figures, scarcely visible in the semi-darkness,
stand in the Catholic Church at Carthagena. The
faint light before the altar scarcely permits the
officiating priest to read the service—the responses
are hurried, and the marriage ritual is apparently
being performed in haste. The register, scarce
looked at, is signed, and the two leave the sacred
edifice to the white-robed choristers that in low voices
are chanting their vespers.
They stand together on the deck of a vessel, whose
sails, all spread, are filling with the breeze that bears
them onward. The full light of a swaying lamp falls
on him as she turns to him ; and, as she sees him
clearly, her lips whiten, and her hands are clasped in
an agony she is quick to conceal.
Vespers are nearly over, when a man stands before
the altar, where the marriage rites have just been
performed. Incredulity is stamped on every feature
as the black-robed priest addresses him with words of

CHAPTER 11.
THE EVIL THAT MEN DO LIVES AFTER THEM.
1785-
“On 31st January, 1785, I, Richard John Frew,
received an order from the principals of my firm
(Messrs. Staines and Albert, of Gray’s Inn, solicitors)
to attend the making of a will on the part of one
Baptiste Arthur Haviland, of Shoreham Manor,
Sussex, my instructions being to attend him on his
presumed death-bed, he having lingered to a great
age without devising any of his personal estate, which
was considerable. Being warned of the necessity of
employing haste, I started immediately I had arranged
other matters, and, arriving at my destination at
midnight, got down, very cramped and cold, from my
seat on the driver’s box. I found an old nondescript
vehicle waiting to convey me to the Manor, and
having replied to the question as to whether I was
the lawyer from London affirmatively, took my seat.
“ A drive over a long winding road, partly beach,
as I inferred from the sinking of the wheels in heavy
sand, brought us to a lonely-looking house, with a
belt of firs stretching round it, and enhancing by their
gloomy dismalness the weird-looking scene. The
moon had risen, and shone fitfully from between the
clouds. During the intervals of light I could see the
grim stone building, in some respects more suitable


for a jail than a dwelling; and, indeed, the heavy gates
at the entrance, and the high stone wall that sur-
rounded the grounds, together with the great bolts
studded in the massive door, and the long narrow
windows, gave Shoreham Manor an unmistakably
penitentiary-like aspect.
“ I had not long to wait on arrival, for, after a short
time, a shuffling step produced presently a lean and
apparently deaf old woman, who, holding up a skinny
finger to ensure attention, beckoned me in a ghostly
fashion to follow her. We ascended a broad, low
flight of stairs, and, entering the first door on a land-
ing, I found myself in a lofty, bare-looking room, in
which a large state bedstead occupied a recess. My
client lay half-uncovered on this, with closed eyes and
sunken features. He looked so lifeless that I in-
voluntarily started.
“ 1 Dead ! no, not dead.’
“ The voice came from the depths of an enormous
chair beside me, and I noticed for the first time what
seemed to me the only other living occupant of the
room—a very slight old man, not tall either, and
with features still so clearly cut as to show great
beauty in their profile; hair white as the snowy
ruffles that fell around his wrists.
“ * Wait,’ he said; ‘ Oh, no, not dead. Wait till he
opens his eyes, the Haviland eyes.’ (I noticed,
meanwhile, his own were of a deep clear sapphire
blue.) £ You know our eyes are our weak point; we
are all proud of our eyes,’ he continued ; ‘ even death
fails to close them. No, no, not dead ; he’ll open
them to die.’
“ The echo of the words had scarely reverberated
through the room when, turning to the bed, I observed
wide open eyes fixed on me with a questioning stare,
I quite started at their extraordinary brilliancy and
colour. Framed in a skin of parchment, a face of death,


explanation he seems unable to comprehend. A
book is brought to him, at which he glances, and
then, with bowed head, passes out into the darkness —
a darkness not deeper than that which will, hence-
forth, for ever cloud his life.

I quite started at their extraordinary brilliancy and
colour. Framed in a skin of parchment, a face of death,


shrunken by age, attenuated by sickness, crowned by
a few white hairs, they still shone bright with the
force and light of youth, taking with magic quickness
all the silence and weakness from the face, and com-
pelling me to feel as if in them lay the Alchemist’s
crucible from which should spring new life and vigour.
The voice belonging to the eyes recalled me.
“ ‘ Have you the materials ? ’ it questioned.
“ I bowed assent.
“ ‘ Then, as I am ready, you may proceed.’
“ I spread the sheets, and glanced at him while
following his words.
“ ‘I, Baptiste Arthur Haviland, eldest son of the
late Leon Haviland, being of sound mind, do hereby
give and bequeath all my personal estate, consisting
of seventy thousand pounds in stock and debentures,
to Clarence Asher, my first cousin, and only son of
my mother’s brother Miles, and Marguerite his wife.
And I leave to my brother Noel, heir to the direct
estate, which I cannot leave away from him, my most
bitter curse, which he will find proved, not in words
only, but in the impoverished state of the Manor and
its lands, from which neither he nor the generations
following him can receive benefit. And, dying here,
I place on record my belief that in a poor hundred
years the lineage, like the love he lied to procure for
himself, will have passed away, and not one Haviland
of the direct line remain. To the last of my race I
leave a letter explaining my wrongs and my revenge.’
“ He held out his hand for the pen, which I placed
within his fingers. With great effort he seemed to con-
centrate his strength, and affixed his signature. The
two witnesses, one the parish curate, the other his
doctor, had been summoned, and their names were
added. A perfect silence seemed to hold us spell-
bound, the widely opened eyes relaxed and partly
closed.

“ ‘ Hilda !’ the voice, very weak and faint, came from
the bed. ‘Air, light,’ it muttered, then quickly the
blue eyes opened wide again with their wonder-
fully radiant look— ‘ Noel, the bugle ! ready, aye
ready.’
“The alert look vanished; in its place was stillness
and death. Yes, death, indeed; although wide open
still, the eyes looked out on life. I closed and sealed
the will, and glanced around. The doctor and curate
had already gone; the disinherited brother alone
remained. Hesitating as to my next course, I
watched him; a slight wave of the hand dismissing
me was the only notice I elicited, and I, too, left the
room in silence.
“So met and parted, we four, devisor and execu-
tants of an unjust deed, planned that its worst evils
should fall on generations unborn. I had no object
in remaining, and, my work accomplished, returned at
once. The will lies among others, like and unlike.
Seeds planted to bear fruit after many days. Will
they gather ‘ grapes of thorns ? ’ ”
The notes close here, but secured around them is a
strip of paper, yellow with age, on which is written—
“l enclose all papers connected with the Haviland
estate, which our late clerk Richard Frew had over-
looked, prior to his decease, with other family records
in the box labelled with their name.” So it happened
that, gathered with matters of more import, these
rough notes remained to throw some light in the years
that were to come on a closed chapter of the
past.

CHAPTER 111.
A HAPPY NEW YEAR.
1885.
The new year was just six hours old, when a party
of riders issued from the home station at Glenross.
All through the night the long, well-lighted rooms
had echoed to the sounds of music and of dancing
feet, and now, after early coffee, many of these, well
mounted, were starting for more or less long home-
ward rides, in the pleasant early morning, through
the bush of Australia. Who that has so ridden can
forget the exhilaration it induces ? Above the frag-
rant perfume of the yellow wattle blossoms, while
below lie the scented gum leaves, from which fresh
fragrance crushes at every step. The clear low call
of birds from branch to branch just wakened to the
day, while busy twitterings from hidden nests fill all
the air with sound. The shafts of sunlight glinting
through the boughs, the bright blue sky, hidden so
often by the long aisles of trees that only a tempered
light can penetrate their foliage. Here and there a
startled wallaby or kangaroo leaps off in long bounds,
and is soon lost to view; while overhead, with the
advancing day, white golden-crested cockatoos sit like
sentinels on the branches. Far off the laughing
echoes of the jackass are borne on the wind. While,
near at hand, clouds of young green parrots, and
brilliantly plumaged wrens and finches, flit like gleam-
ing jewels through the forest leaves. Honey birds dip
their long curved beaks deep in the bell-like Epacris ;
while overhead great golden butterflies, striped and
spotted with blackest jet, flash by in the streaks of
sunlight.
The day goes onward, and the quivering air

The day goes onward, and the quivering air


betokens its great heat, when one of those riders who
had left Glenross in great contentment, and had since
ridden on, with little notice, save for the curls of
smoke as they swept slowly upward from his favourite
weed, halted in some surprise, at his want of suffi-
cient bush lore to discover his way through the
apparently untrodden solitudes. “Three mortal hours
have I been wandering through these everlasting trees,”
he says, “ and if here isn’t the one I marked before.
What am lat ? Dr. George Assan, would you be sur-
prised to hear that the first syllable of your name fits
extremely well, especially when you might have had
company through these regions that shall be nameless,
when you are doomed to wander through them like a
lost spirit, or, if that’s too ethereal, ‘ the last man.’
1 wonder what Charlie’s doing—and whether he has
managed to pilot himself in better style than I have
achieved. I hope not; if he’s lost his way too, he’ll
be a brother in misfortune, and not for the first
time.”

worries. The horse you back is scratched. Are you
so sorry that your friend’s comes in a failure ? The
crew of your favourite boat pull might and main, but
steadily the opposing colour overhauls and leads. No
matter; noon q you know has it on. Your shot falls
short which you thought would score a centre. What
a good fellow the next marksman seems, if only he
aims wide. Yes, it’s quite true that nothing helps you
to bear your own trouble so well as seeing another
deeper. It induces an amount of philosophy that
nothing else will furnish. If you’re dipped to the
elbows, somebody else shoulders under affords a
thrilling spectacle. What a pity wisdom’s bought at
such an alarming sacrifice, though !

and been discussing devilled kidneys or toasted quails,
than wandering round and round here in the heat like
a circus rider. Pleasant, if Pve missed the assegais
of the Zulus and come out here to be lost in the bush,
sitting in skeleton form under a tree through the “ long
aftertime.” I always intended to be cremated, but
must throw up that idea now, unless I pile my own
funeral pyre, and I am surely too idle for that. I
wonder if my fair cousin has condescended to notice
my absence yet? Not likely; she will not think of
me, I may be sure. If Hilda’s heart’s out here in the
ranges at all, it will be Charlie’s blue eyes that will
have induced it to wander. Well, they might do
better, my fair cousin and my friend, and worse ; and
that’s impartial justice, since it favours either or neither.
But the road, if it’s not a misnomer—where’s that?
Surely I saw a stockrider, and there’s the crack of his
whip.
“ Hey ! Coo-ee, coo-ee ! How far am I off the
station ? ”
“Not more ’n three miles, sir; it’s blazed straight
to the slip rails.”
“ Thanks. Now then, Mercury, emulate your
namesake, or I shall never invoke the Pegasus of the
Antipodes again.”

I had reached home at last, and it was fully four
hours later, most of which time had been slept away,

Like most of our fellows, I usually ignored that un-
social meal, since to eat at all at such unholy hours
requires that proverbial hunger which is “ the best


sauce.’’ But being aroused, why, I shall hear the news,
if there is any (a proviso to some purpose here), so I
will descend.
“Not on me so literally, if you please, George.”
“ Oh, you ! Poor little Hilda, what a smash there’d
be ! Six feet two avalanching down on five feet
nothing.”
“ Five feet three, if you please. You record your
own extra inches, give me the same benefit.”
“You are not five feet three, Hilda; that’s a
delusion of yours. You girls measure with your shoes
on. The proper way ”
“Never mind the proper way. There’s the second
bell, and if my uncle’s down he will expect you to ex-
plain to him the route to Khartoum, I saw him
studying the map just now.”
“ Khartoum ! I believe you wish I was there,
Hilda ? ”
“Well, Dr. George, I believe I do. How much
more useful you would be than you are at present.”
“ Useful! Not I; I should be flirting with the
Arab girls, looking into Oriental eyes, and clasping
henna-tipped fingers at ‘ Jacob’s Well.’ ”
“ How pleasant to find so absorbing a pursuit, and
one not likely soon to be exhausted, since the world is
wide, and after white fingers there are red, and after
red black. Why, you’ll find employment till you die;
and, in the meantime, may I suggest that /am not
Oriental, nor is this the ‘ Well of Jacob.’ ”
The dining-room at Harrow is lofty, and has many
windows, each one opening out on a broad verandah,
so closely netted round that few, if any, of the
plagues of the country (I allude to mosquitos) find
entrance there. A motley assemblage and a busy
hum of talk from those already gathered greets us.
And let no one surmise that these are all denizens
of the house, or old neighbours discussing fresh news,


sauce.’’ But being aroused, why, I shall hear the news,
if there is any (a proviso to some purpose here), so I
will descend.
“Not on me so literally, if you please, George.”
“ Oh, you ! Poor little Hilda, what a smash there’d
be ! Six feet two avalanching down on five feet
nothing.”
“ Five feet three, if you please. You record your
own extra inches, give me the same benefit.”
“You are not five feet three, Hilda; that’s a
delusion of yours. You girls measure with your shoes
on. The proper way ”
“Never mind the proper way. There’s the second
bell, and if my uncle’s down he will expect you to ex-
plain to him the route to Khartoum, I saw him
studying the map just now.”
“ Khartoum ! I believe you wish I was there,
Hilda ? ”
“Well, Dr. George, I believe I do. How much
more useful you would be than you are at present.”
“ Useful! Not I; I should be flirting with the
Arab girls, looking into Oriental eyes, and clasping
henna-tipped fingers at ‘ Jacob’s Well.’ ”
“ How pleasant to find so absorbing a pursuit, and
one not likely soon to be exhausted, since the world is
wide, and after white fingers there are red, and after
red black. Why, you’ll find employment till you die;
and, in the meantime, may I suggest that /am not
Oriental, nor is this the ‘ Well of Jacob.’ ”
The dining-room at Harrow is lofty, and has many
windows, each one opening out on a broad verandah,
so closely netted round that few, if any, of the
plagues of the country (I allude to mosquitos) find
entrance there. A motley assemblage and a busy
hum of talk from those already gathered greets us.
And let no one surmise that these are all denizens
of the house, or old neighbours discussing fresh news,


though, of course, these predominate. Near the head
of the table sits the latest addition to its circle, in the
shape of our Irish doctor from the town, a light-
hearted, genial fellow, equally good at a “ dance, or a
shot, or setting a fractured limb,” knee deep now in
an argument with the governor, in which such phrases
as bacteria, choleraic symptoms, and climatic in-
fluence appear with startling frequency. Beside me I
overhear a lad explaining to his German tuto.r (a mild
little man in spectacles) the idioms of our own ex-
pressive tongue, which, for the professor’s benefit, he
appears to be degenerating into slang.
“ Yes,” he avers, “ I said shake it.”
“ But shake, it is de verbe to tremble ; how can I
shake de umbrella unless it rain, and I tremble de
leetle rain-drops off? ”
“ Oh, no ! not that at all; make it—now do you
understand ? ”
“Ah ! like tradesman ; but I cannot: I nevare learn
to compose umbrella; I teach my language only.”
“No, no! take it, that’s what I mean; shake it,
verb to cut away with it —now do you see ? ”
The German’s face expresses mysticism, and mys-
ticism only ; and I pass on to where the Anglican
Church is represented by our old clergyman, who is
explaining to my grey-eyed cousin, who sits beside him,
his approval of her taste in church decoration, and
from them I hear soft murmurs of frosted lettering,
crimson background, white lilies, &c. He is telling
her the legend of the “ crossbill ” now, and her clear
grey eyes shine like stars while she listens; and as he
wanders from that into the story of the “ Holy Grail,”
I know that for them the present vanishes, and in its
place appears “Sir Galahad, the bright boy knight,”
on his quest of peace.

Matter more material interests the two ladies who
sit beside them, and are recounting someone else’s


bridal array, which reaches its climax in, “ And all
from Europe. Worth designed the dresses.”
Below, a sporting squatter, from the nearest station,
is declaiming to his vis-a-vis , “ And we knocked over
two hundred and seventy, and should have done
better, but they broke through the line of beaters, and
one ‘ old man ’ tore Nathan’s kangaroo dog clean
through with a stroke of his claws.”
“ Oh, they'll hang him, of course ” (so the district
J.P.)! “ Curious how they caught him ; did you hear
the story ? He’d stuck up seven stations, you know,
lately, and the police have been hunting him for quite
the last eighteen months ; however, he had the
‘ chances of war ’ with a vengeance at the eighth. He
got there early in the afternoon, when all the men
were away, and, with his usual coolness, walked right
into the breakfast room, where one of the girls was
sitting alone. Of course he knew he was safe, for a
time at least; and she knew there was no chance of
help, and so applied her mind to stratagem, while he
drank his wine and paid her compliments quite in
the ‘Claude Duval’ fashion.- ‘I hear you looked
charming in your fancy costume at the local ball,’ he
said; ‘ what was the character ? ’ ‘The Slave,’ she
tells him, a bright idea occurring to her; ‘ shall I
show it you ?’ He assents, of course, and she
presently reappears with a long blue tunic, heavily
trimmed with silver lace, and the slight handcuffs
caught together with the slender chain. Laying them
on the table, she adroitly covers his revolver, which
lies beside him, and, taking up the silver handcuffs,
she slips them on her arm to show the effect. ‘ They
are too large,’ he says ; ‘ why, I could wear them.’
‘ Oh dear no !’ she answers ; ‘not if you put your arms
so,’ crossing her own behind her. They are so light,
as he sees, scarcely a touch would part them. ‘ Try,’
he says, turning his back to her and holding them

“ Dance ? ”
“ Yes, managed ten. Awfully few girls here ; never
enough of them anywhere.”
“ Take claret ? ”
“ Charlton danced everything; just like soldiers
and sailors, always monopolizing the floor.”
I am here reminded that I have not seen Charlie
since we left Glenross, he intending to ride round for
letters to the town and cross the ranges on a short
cut home. I glance at Hilda; she has heard his
name, and seems listening for news. None comes,
and my little cousin’s white lids discreetly droop over
eyes that are rather tell-tale to the initiated, and she is
one of the first to rise and leave the room, which is
shortly after vacated by everyone, nearly all going
separate ways except myself, who is summoned to
attend the library and discuss the route across the
map to Khartoum.
“Suakim, the only seaport of Nubia, is situated on
the Red Sea. It is built on an island joined to the
mainland by a causeway, and reached only after
twenty miles’ difficult navigation through coral reefs.
The population is mixed, and about 8,000 in number.
Berber, on the banks of the Nile, is distant about 200
miles, and can be reached by camel-caravans in from
twelve to fifteen days, and is often described as the

at my door, and Charlton’s servant appears.
“ Beg pardon, sir,” he says ; “ I cannot find my

“No; I haven’t seen him since he returned,” I
answer. “He wasn’t at lunch. Inquire for him,” I
call out. “ You’ll find him somewhere asleep,” I add
sotto voce , and proceed to join the others.

MISSED.
The room is nearly empty when I enter. Outside a
glorious sunset colours the clouds with crimson and
purple, that melt away into tender pearly shadows.
Far off the distant ranges catch the reflected light
upon their summits, and seem bathed in gold ; while
near at hand the glowing radiance falling on Hilda’s

table, and as, one by one, the guests drop in,
his only is left a vacant place ; and, somehow, I am
getting anxious. I notice, also, that Hilda olten
glances at his empty chair with troubled eyes, and I
am relieved when somebody presently inquires for our
missing Captain. It elicits no response, however,
beyond “ enjoyed himself last night.”
“ Saw him on the verandah at Glenross this morn-

And it presently transpires that I hold all the
information that can be given. This I repeat tersely.
He went into town for letters, intending to return by
a shorter cut across the ranges.
“ What was he riding ?” is asked.
To which I reply “Centaur.”
There is rather an ominous silence after this, broken
at last by someone who opines that, “if he hasn’t
stayed in the town, he will soon be here!” which
sapient observation cheers us more than the mere
words are worth ; for Charlie Charlton is well liked
here, and to me he has been a close comrade through
many a brush in Zululand, and many a weary march
through heat and sand has owed its success as much
to the bright good nature of the young Captain, who
bore so untiringly its reverses, as to his undoubted
courage and military skill. I am glad when the
dinner is over, and those less interested than ray
cousin and myself leave us alone to talk of him.
“ Do you think, George ” (we are on the verandah
now, and my little cousin looks imploringly at me),

word, knowing so well its drear meaning.

and will be here to lunch to-morrow. Do not you
grieve, dear. He would not pain you knowingly, I
am sure ; and, Hilda, don’t let the Haviland eyes cry
for him, or they will lose their colour.”
“Mine are not ‘ Haviland eyes;’ only the blue like
Marguerite’s are that,” she answers.
“ But grey eyes are truest,” I whisper, “ and keep
them bright to flash at him in the morning.”
She smiles at this, for “ flashing” is not in Hilda’s
line. There is more of the stars than the lightning
about her, although beneath the quiet surface there is
strong feeling, lam sure. Later, when she has gone,
and all the ladies have retired, I interrogate his
servant, who also has heard nothing. One by one
cigais give out and their smokers vanish, while I,
following their example, find that his room looks
lonely as I pass it on the way to mine. The
lamp is turned low, and I go in and raise it higher.
The place, so orderly and still, gives me, in that half-
light, a look of having lost him. Lost ! Why do I
dwell on the word, when to-morrow he will be
here ?

LOST.
Far out on the range, where the trees close ranked
shut out the dying glories of the day, the wind has
risen, and blowing softly down the heights comes
laden with the essence of a thousand forest odours.
A soft gloom falls like a shadow through the branches,
herald of the coming night; while overhead birds
flying homeward sweep by on swift pinions to their
nests.

And here among the dusky shadows and fallen
leaves, weary with the heat and the unsuccessful
wanderings of the past hours, he sits, whose absence
no other presence could make unfelt. A thousand
memories sweep through his mind in swift succession.
Again he sees the Eton lads bending to their oars,
the bright boyish faces intent on victory. Where are
they now—those who left the old school with him, to
commence their life, filled with the dreams of success
and daring that untried youth ever possesses ? One
lies in a soldier’s grave—on whose dying ear the
shouts of pursuing comrades, the roar of cannon, and
the moans of the wounded fell in the din and
smoke and carnage of victorious battle. Another
passes his young life among the islands of the Coral
seas, in a companionship far worse than any solitude,
content to give his vivid eloquence to teach of where
“ beyond these voices there is light.” The broad
blue waters of the Pacific roll over a sailor, who, far
down among its depths, has ever his requiem in the
cry of the stormy petrel above him. His fate, in the
first flush of his earliest manhood, with all the future
bright as anticipation and hope could colour it, to go
down gallantly in charge of his ship at sea, when all
the rest were survivors and the rescuing boats were
few.
Many visions come and go to Charlton as he rests
here, where even the little daylight that is left, the
forest growth seems shutting out. He thinks of her
who waits for him in the brief twilight among the
garden roses at Harrow, and in his fancy sees the
pale, sweet face, and tender, dreaming eyes of one who
loves him with that perfect unquestioning absorption
and faith without which love, so called, is not love
indeed, but only an usurper, whose crown and sceptre
are but tinselled shams.
With a long sigh he rouses himself from reveries

With a long sigh he rouses himself from reveries


that bring him no nearer the friendly shelter of the
station—and pushes on —on over ground that he
seems to have traversed a hundred times before, so
like it is in its monotony that never changes.
The hours wear on and darkness has fallen on the
long range of hills, low whispering winds rustle the
treetops, while mournfully from out the blackest
shadows sounds the call of night birds.
Here and there flying foxes stretch their bat-like
wings across the night sky, while quiet stars look
down between the interlacing branches, and here,
worn out at last with fatigue and weariness, Charlton
lies asleep.
He had often bivouacked out in the open with his
cloak or saddle for a pillow, but then his men had been
around him, friendly comrades at his side, and the
exigencies of a forced march, borne by all, had been
felt perhaps by none; least of all by him who, his
mind occupied with far graver matters, had snatched
short rest among them.
Here it was different, the solitude was oppressive,
and to push on while there was yet a gleam of light
had been his one thought; till, sitting down to rest,
sleep came to him as it has to many others, with
dreams of bright days already past, happy visions
that in no aftertime would be realized. Slowly the
long hours of the night wore past, and the first faint
light of earliest dawn arose, and still he slept. Later
the sunrise tipped the trees with gold, and rising, now
fevered and unrefreshed, he looked eagerly round for
any sign of tracks. Before him and on either hand
grey trunks of trees arose, while here and there
fallen monarchs of the forest barred the way. Water
—none! and his lips are dry with thirst ! He must
make great effort now lest later he should be unable.
How the bush closes in around him. If only he could

at last.
Midday has come and passed, and at the stockyard
at Harrow there is a strong muster of moving men
and horses, Assan’s eager voice and busy form pre-
dominating. Squatters and stockriders from the
neighbouring stations have ridden in, and mounted
troopers who know the ranges well. Black trackers
have been sent for, but have not arrived. They can
be sent on ; lose no time in commencing the search.
Are the water flasks all filled? Yes —all; well, directly
he is found send on the news. A clatter of horses’
hoofs, and they are gone. Watched with glasses they
can be seen spreading out in different groups to scour
the ranges.

OUT IN THE SOUDAN.
On the same day, among his comrades far out in the
Soudan, a busy scene was enacting round the wells at
Gadkul. After a rapid march of sixty-five hours,
having pushed on with almost ceaseless rapidity
through the desert, we (General Stewart’s column)
had arrived to find a sufficient quantity of good water,
appreciated more keenly by us because of its scanti-
ness on the way. The supply, consisting of three
wells, was situated in a stony basin, circled by ranges
of hills; and already a party of guards had commenced
to erect pumps and hose, to bring it from the upper
reservoir to the basin. Redoubts were being con-
structed to overlook the wells and stores ; and, having
sent a camel and native guide, with money, to treat
for produce, we were naturally disgusted on their
return to find the former unloaded, and the latter


of that, and surely he must reach the clearer ground
at last.
Midday has come and passed, and at the stockyard
at Harrow there is a strong muster of moving men
and horses, Assan’s eager voice and busy form pre-
dominating. Squatters and stockriders from the
neighbouring stations have ridden in, and mounted
troopers who know the ranges well. Black trackers
have been sent for, but have not arrived. They can
be sent on ; lose no time in commencing the search.
Are the water flasks all filled? Yes —all; well, directly
he is found send on the news. A clatter of horses’
hoofs, and they are gone. Watched with glasses they
can be seen spreading out in different groups to scour
the ranges.

empty handed, I becoming apprised of the fact just
as I had dipped my head into a canvas basin I was
about to luxuriate in. “ Charteris ! ” —the voice is
Gower’s, I know, and he, black as sand and perspira-
tion can make him, comes leisurely in view from the
redoubt. “Limes and melons arrived,” he calls out —
“don’t you want to see them?” My head emerges
quickly, and I look to behold my friend already in
the distance with the basin (a luxury here), and the
guide close at hand, bemoaning his failure, and the
“ bad treatment he has received.”
Later, our scouts capture a convoy of merchandise
on its way from Metemneh to Merrawee. There are
four natives with it, who inform us that some of
General Gordon’s troops are still at Shendy, and that
2,000 of the Mahdi’s force are at Metemneh. Gower,
who has literally cleaned himself, and comes back
like a shiny red apple from the process, overhears
this, and declaims dramatically—“ Come one, come
all, this rock shall fly from its firm base —as —as —
bother, I’ve forgotten the rest; it’s action, not
poetry, / excel in. Hand over the forage bag, I want
to sit down on something more luxurious than sand.
The tobacco I have, and a pipe; thanks, this reminds
me of the copy-book aphorism, ‘ Be virtuous and you
will be happy,’ illustrating in this instance the
pleasure of a well-earned rest. So we got no limes
after all, though the Arabs closed with the money—
ready for next time, I suppose. Well, I own it’s a
disappointment, and gives me ‘ a feeling of sadness
and longing,’ longing especially. Some people might
think it a come down to associate Longfellow and
water melons, but I always like to veil the common-
place in beautiful ideas. By the way, Charlton and
Assan are en route by now, or soon will be, though we
shall have done all the fighting and won all the glory
before they arrive, I expect.”

“Or left our bones in the desert,” chimes in a
voice beside us in a sepulchral drawl.
“ Well, then, Lewis,” says Gower, “ you’ll go to
the arms of the houris ; what more can you require ?”
“ Nothing,” he answers. “ Taking my sins all
round, I might have done considerably worse ; and if
you believe that, it explains your hurry for an engage-
ment, first with the Arabs, afterwards with the houris,
which isn’t polite, since by all rules of chivalry it
should be ladies first.”
“ Oh, but this is a most graceful compliment—after
the exertion the reward, and such a reward,” says
Gower gallantly.
“ After the physic the jam,” says Donne, “ that’s
correct, I know, because it’s how they managed
matters at home.”
“ Home ! I don’t think you ever had one, or
they’d have taught you to respect your betters.”
“ Betters ! I should like to see them ; but I’m
like Sam Weller, my wision’s limited.”
“ ’Specs he growed, like Topsy, Gower; he has
very little respect for the ties of this world, as the
man said when the rope was round his neck.”
“Has he? Then it’s your ‘ evil communications’
that’s ‘corrupted’ his ‘ good manners.’”
“ Don’t you despise your comrades, Donne.
Talleyrand once said ‘he looked down on mankind,’
and got for answer ‘ it was because he had studied
himself too closely.’ ”
“ Did he ? ‘ Know thyself ’ isn’t a bad motto,
though, after all, especially when you feel a weakness
you can’t smother for a little P.B. Hand it over,
sharp, or I sha’n’t have time to catch the flavour, for
I’m one of the reconnoitring party.”
“ Give it him, Charteris. Long may it be before
your valuable services are dispensed with, Donne.”

“Thank you for nothing. Here’s to our next


merry meeting,” and, waving his cap, he is soon
mounted and off.
When next I meet him our column has advanced
to within four miles of the Abuklea Wells, where,
having halted, entrenchments have been thrown up,
under cover of which we bivouac for the night, during
the whole of which the enemy maintains an inter-
mittent fire from the hills.
In the morning General Stewart determines to
advance against them, so leaving the baggage and the
hospital commissariat in the entrenchment under a
guard, we march out in an advance, which is made in
square. The enemy salutes us with a fusillade, under
which several of our men fall wounded; but the
bold skirmishing of the Rifles and Mounted Infantry
drives them back, and the Artillery pour in a
withering fire across the valley to where the long line
of flags stretch out to oppose our advance. Suddenly
there is a fierce onslaught from the Arab force, our
heavy cavalry are borne back by the overwhelming
masses, and the square on their side is forced. Then
ensues a tremendous struggle of Arabs and soldiers,
covered with dust and smoke. Abu Saleh, the Emir
of Metemneh, leading on a band of fanatics, fights
desperately till he is shot down in the centre among
falling camels and heaps of dead and wounded, with
their arms and banners. General Stewart’s horse is
shot under him, and Colonel Brackenbury falls dead
from a spear-thrust. But the steadiness and valour
of our soldiers prevail, the fierce onset is driven back,
and amid ringing cheers the square is reformed, our
men pouring volleys into the rebels, who in scattered
bands retreat. Slowly the firing ceases, and the fight
is over, showing again what British pluck and endur-
ance can do under a rain of bullets and an avalanche
of foes. Gallant officers and men lie scattered around

with pride and patriotism when the familiar bugle

them green when, with hushed voices, we speak of the
heroes of the Soudan! And here among them, speared
through the lungs, and bleeding fast to death, Donne
lies, when I find him where had been the centre of
that fatal fight. The bodies of four Arabs lie prone
across his feet.
“My spoil,” he gasps, and something of his old
bright smile lights up his face. “ A merry meeting,
Charteris,” he adds, “ for we have won. Tell Gower
I am gone to the houris.”
I brush the sand from off his yellow curls, and put
ray flask to his dry, hot lips.
“ Tell my mother,” he whispers, “ I believe in her
angels , for I see them.”
The ambulance comes up; too late for him, they
pass on in search of the living. There are graves dug
for gallant men that night, but none hold braver
hearts than his, from which we turned with saddened
spirits, leaving it to solitude and the soft light of the
Eastern stars.

men still search the forest. Fires are lighted at
night at different points, and as, one by one, the
searchers come into the camp a glance and shake of
the head are question and answer. Stories of lost


men, of whom no trace, alive or dead, was ever found,
are told at the troopers’ fire. And even his friends—
those who have felt his warm handshake —feel that the
case is hopeless, and that the search must cease.
Assan alone holds out.
“ Charlton has much resource,” he avers, “ and, if
he has found water, may yet be lying somewhere,
too weak to move; and yet with life that will
rekindle,”
Kindly eyes, from under furrowed brows, note his
anxiety, and generous hearts respond ; while again,
and yet again, the search continues uselessly.
“ To-morrow the last day they will go out, George ?
oh ! surely not; they cannot give him up so soon.”
“Dear, you forget; it is a week to-day, and I can-
not keep them from their ordinary life longer.”
“ Forget! No, Ido not forget; it might be many
months, but when the search ceases we shall have lost
him indeed.”
“ You must not give way, dear. Hilda, you have
wanted to join us each day; if I let you come to-
morrow will you try to be brave to-night ?”
She is past speaking now, but waves her hand in
assent as she passes out.
To-morrow ! One would think the very grave
would have given him up ere this. He must have
wandered very far away. Poor Charlton ! —how the
fellows —Gower and Charteris and Donne will
grieve. If to-morrow brings no further news I shall
be glad, indeed, to get away from here and join them.
But poor Hilda, the shock will kill her; she is too
quiet outwardly just now to bear the strain when all
hope ceases, and hope how can there be ?
Far in the forest the gloom of night and silence is

irregularly, as coming to its close ; the eyes are sunken ;
the face, pale as if death were already there, is still and
unconscious ; close to his nerveless hand his cap lies,
wet with water he is now too weak to use ; tightly
clasped within his fingers are a pencil and torn letter,
on which he has tried to write his farewells and his
fate. Will any eyes ever read the written record, or
shall he lie here through the hot sunshine of Aus-
tralian noons, changing only to the clear nights and the
bright radiance of the Southern Cross —lie here, while
from the memory of friends he is forgotten, his voice a
lost chord from out the music that surrounds their lives?
One who has watched the long night wear away
is watching still; slowly the first grey light of dawn
appears, hardly a glimmer, yet to the patient watcher
fraught with hope, for who that has waited with
longing eyes, for morning, through such a time,
can fail to remember how surely the new day brought
fresh comfort —some thought of what might be; some
prescience that, ere the darkness fell, they should see
again the lost, for whom they would have given gladly
their own lives in rescue? It is still early when those
who are to relieve the search party in the ranges
arrive, and Hilda, who is first in the saddle, leads out.
When she is beyond hearing some two or three near
neighbours turn to Assan reproachfully—
“ How could you let her come to-day of all days,
when at night the search ceases?” they ask.
“Are you so sure,” he rejoins impatiently, “that
we shall never find him ? And she will give no trouble;
it is not her way. You have never heard, perhaps, of
her quiet childhood and lonely life, till she joined my
people here. Reticence is her second nature now,
and I doubt whether she ever gives any expression to
her deepest feelings.” Those who know her best
assent to this, averring that it expresses their previously
formed opinion of her.

of their words, and lost in the visions her fancy
conjures up, of having found him. The path becoming

loose stones, and tangled creepers, the party close
together as they ascend, winding their way in and out

“ No, there has been nothing fresh discovered.” All
have returned but two. They have made large tins of
coffee for their refreshment, from which cans are being
handed round, when there is the tramp of horses’ hoofs
again, and the red shirts of the two stockriders appear
in view. Nothing ! alas, no ! The answer is still
nothing. The leaders of those who are to retire and
those who stay consult together as to their best course,
and it is finally agreed that they must spread out again,
searching carefully each step of ground, and returning
at nightfall. Where possible, it is considered best to
take the horses, in case of quicker aid being needed,
from the rest. All the flasks are looked to, water and
brandy being given to each, except Hilda, who has
come prepared.
“ Do not,” she says, entreatingly, “ wait for me.
You go your way as if I was not here.”
“ I will,” her cousin answers. “ The tramping of
so many men and horses through the week has already
worn some tracks. Be careful of these, and remember
the trees that are blazed, they will help your return,
which must be before nightfall.” “Do not you stray,
dear,” he adds, his voice going further into the distance
as he rides away.

ENGLAND, HOME, AND BEAUTY.
A pleasant sea coal fire burns brightly in the pretty
drawingroom at Kensington. Outside the branches of
the laurels and close-clipped yews are heavy with
snow, soft feathery flakes are falling, and already the
early darkness of midwinter has set in. But the
gloom of the exterior only gives an added comfort
to the soft lounges and velvet-piled carpet within.
In an easy-chair, fronting the light and warmth,
Marguerite Asher, first cousin of far-off Hilda’s, sits at
rest. Close masses of curly golden hair lie on a
broad, white forehead, and curiously enough the Havi-
land eyes, deserting the direct line, like the fortune
she enjoys from them, have come down to her ; blue
as a sapphire in their intense colour in repose, they
can flash with a glitter that even black eyes rarely
reach when in excitement. A brilliant colour flushes
in either cheek. No taller than Hilda, she yet seems
taller by reason of her fuller figure, and the statelier
manner she assumes. An envelope, bearing a colonial
postmark, lies at her feet, the letter in her lap, while
a carte that she holds in her hand is being critically
examined. Near her a white-haired, pleasant-faced
old lady, who has waited with some impatience
apparently for news, says in a quiet voice—
“ Well, Rita, whose likeness is it? and how are
they?”
“ Oh, they are all well. This letter was written
just before Christmas, and the likeness is Hilda’s.
Look! ”
The picture falls in the older lady’s lap, and she
inspects it with interest; for though conversant with

whom she still cherishes, her dead brother’s only
child. Hilda, who also early left with no nearer tie
than the ones she resides with, lives in her remem-

in a great gloomy house, whose very grounds were
enclosed by high stone walls and heavy iron gates,
outside which a not over-wide beach of shifting sand
and shingle added its quota of dreary sameness to the

“ Not as if it were pretty, Auntie,” Rita had said,
even then a small wise judge of what was luxurious
or pleasant,
. “ But I love it,” Hilda had sobbed with many
tears, looking out over the grey waters, and the
greyer sails. Poor child, her love had been powerless
to retain any hold over it; and she had inherited
but a small fortune, from which a yearly sum of eighty
pounds (its interest) paid for her small wants. The
house and she had something in common with each
other. The one had had broad lands attached,
bright sunshiny meadows, fair cottage homes. It had
known the time when its owners could post to
their town-house, and had often done so, returning
with many guests. Then the great gates were flung
aside in welcome, and the heavy oak door opened to
bright faces and eager feet. Music and dancing
filled the now deserted rooms, while servants in
bright livery hurried by on duties to their masters. It
was all changed; the lands had passed away, death
had been busy with those who dwelt here, and fate,
stronger even than he, had pursued them with an
unkindly frown. Fortune had kept far off. All that
could be willed away had passed into other hands;


relatives, she is really only intimate with the one
whom she still cherishes, her dead brother’s only
child. Hilda, who also early left with no nearer tie
than the ones she resides with, lives in her remem-
brance now only as a little child, whom she once saw
in a great gloomy house, whose very grounds were
enclosed by high stone walls and heavy iron gates,
outside which a not over-wide beach of shifting sand
and shingle added its quota of dreary sameness to the
scene. Again she sees the child’s fair waxen face

debt had been first guest, then master. Ruin had
set in, first whispered, then cast abroad. Till now the
child who inherited it was unable even to keep it for
a home; while she, last of her race and name, with
nothing of their lost grandeur in her fortune or her-
self, passed from its threshold for ever to seek a
new place under other skies, and over fast-rolling
waters.
“ Are you dreaming, Auntie, that you hold that carte
so long ? ”
There is a pause before the reply comes.
“Yes, dear, I was thinking of her past; how sad it
was, and of how surely the Havilands died out. After
the loss of their fortune it seemed they never rallied
or made fresh means for themselves.”
“Well, Auntie, if you must remember that, think,
too, how useful it was to us. It made the Ashers
what we are, and that is fate. ‘Turn, fortune; turn
thy wheel and lower the proud.’ It wasn't pride,
though, that preceded the fall only, if that had any-
thing to do with it, because Hilda is surely the
proudest of them all. What do you think of her like-
ness ? ”
“ Well, you know, my dear, I admire it; it is un-
common, and looks so full of thought. Do you know,
I always fancied her face presaged some sorrow in
her life. She reminds me of a picture I once saw of
Joan of Arc.”

CHAPTER X.
KHARTOUM.
Khartoum, the largest town in Nubia, and the seat
of government for the whole country, including the
adjoining regions of Soudan, is situated on the Blue
Nile, nearly at the point where the two branches of
the Nile, the Blue and White (Bahr el Azrek and Bahr
el Abiad), unite their waters. The stream so united
is joined at some distance below by the “ Atbara,”
which comes from the high lands of Abyssinia, to the
south-east. The lands watered by these rivers exhibit
a diversified surface, alternating forests and savannahs.
But below the junction of the “ Atbara,” cultivation is
limited to the immediate banks. The valley of the
Nile becomes here a mere ravine, bordered on either
hand by chains of rocks. In some places where open-
ings occur in the bordering mountains the sands of the
desert come close to the river brink. Groups of
acacias, mimosa, and date palm mark its course, and
sugar cane grows wild in the neighbourhood of its
banks. Scattered villages occur at intervals, round
which in small fields are grown tobacco and dourrha.
The only commerce is a transit trade, consisting of
the caravans, which convey the produce of Central
Africa through Nubia to the bazaars of Cairo, and the
shameful traffic in slaves, which has been so well ex-
posed by famous travellers who have traversed this
region. And, indeed, the evils they have made known
have long been some of the greatest obstacles to any
advancement in the Soudan, which, divided into numer-
ous petty kingdoms, are engaged in frequent warfare for

the express purpose of taking prisoners from among

latter often carrying young children, have, footsore and


weary, been marched in long gangs across the desert,
the weaker falling dead or dying by the way, the sur-
vivors sold into slavery. Khartoum is already too
well known to need a lengthened description here,
since photographed on every reader’s mind is a
picture of its palace and convents, its mosques and
its markets, the latter crowded with produce of all
descriptions, from elephants’ tusks of whitest ivory,
rhinoceros horns, and skins of the almost numberless
variety of wild animals that abound here, to native
cloths dyed in bright colours, and packages of sun-
dried fruits and seeds. A curious assemblage of many
moving forms completes the picture. Here is a
Sheikh, in embroidered bournous of black and gold,
tall, bronzed, and handsome, and by his side a youth,
in silken robe, with turban of spotless folds. An
Abyssinian from the high lands comes next in view,
his hair stained of a bright reddish brown, and follow-
ing him a camel driver, with fiery eyes, white cloak of
camel’s hair, and sandalled feet. Here the water-
carriers, with their skins of precious liquid, chaffer with
a dealer, whose goods, chiefly melons and gourds, are
spread out before him; while overhead the rays of
glittering, golden sunlight penetrate everywhere.
All colours of complexions are here, from sunburnt
white to blackest jet, though lithe-limbed Arabs pre-
dominate, like carved figures cut from old cedar. The
gesticulating and noise go on without intermission
through the long hours of the day, varied by the
trampling and snorting of the camels as they are
loaded and unloaded till sundown comes, and night
falls like a silver veil, luminous with many stars, over
the busy throng. Then watch-fires gleam out, and
only a subdued hum tells of the still busy life around.

It was from this city that General Gordon’s last
despatch, dated December, 1884, is written. It shows
that the garrison, reduced to the last extremity, had


fought the besiegers continuously night and day.
“ To-day,” it says, “we are attacked on three sides.
Come quickly.” Alas ! that the call for help was vain,
that the gallant defender of Khartoum was already
doomed to justify his cause with his life. Yet not in
vain such lives pass from us. Like an electric thrill
from that far Eastern city came the news; winding its
way across the older world it flashed upon the new.
With vivid force it painted to men’s minds the nation’s
loss, and with one voice the people flew to aid. It
needed that at such a juncture there should be a clear
understanding and chivalrous spirit, united to quick,
incisive action at the helm; and these were all well
found in one who, long after these generations have
passed away, when a mighty nation shall encircle these
shores of the Pacific, will still be remembered as the
statesman who “ took the current.when it served,” nor
“ missed his venture ” —a venture that shall bind us
with links of love to the dear home-land, and prove,
indeed, how, separated by oceans, we are still united
to the “ Flag that has braved a thousand years, the
battle and the breeze.”

There are a few warm handshakes among his friends

The red ashes of the fire die out and whiten; a

to assist in meeting expenses in connection with our
Contingent, afforded vast relief, and thousands of
pounds came pouring in to that end, while the use of
their large new stores was offered the Government
by a well-known firm in order to make some adequate
provision for the goods which, coming from all
quarters, overwhelmed the recipients. Goods of every
kind and description, from highest luxury to heaviest
necessity. Ladies and Sisters of Mercy offered their
services as nurses to the force, and many bright eyes,
clouded with anxiety, sought the Ambulance List
daily, hoping even to the last there might be some
late acceptance of their service.
“Hilda, have you your answer yet?” her aunt
asks. (The mail-bag has been opened half-an-hour
at Harrow.)
“Yes, Auntie; there is a letter from the Colonial
Secretary’s office which says, in conclusion, ‘lt has
not yet been determined whether nurses will be sent,
but, if steps are taken in that direction, your applica-
tion will be considered with others.’ ”
“ I have been speaking to Captain Charlton, who is
recalled,” her aunt says, “ and sails for the East, by
the first steamer from here, in about four days. What
a rapid recovery he has made ! I think you must
show him as a specimen of your nursing qualifications,
dear. It will seem lonely here after he and George
have returned. I wish your being of age did not
necessitate our parting also ; and what reason there
can be for your presence at home, when there is abso-
lutely nothing fresh for you to inherit, is more than I
can understand. But if you are called to Suakim
that is not exactly en route to London.”
“ I shall not go with the ‘ Contingent,’ Aunt ; the

some of Aunt Margaret’s military friends’ families, you
know; and then from there to the hospital ship
among the coral reefs, to take care of George and
Charley if they are unfortunate enough to get on
board, will perhaps be an easy transit. I can hear
George calling me, and must tell him the evil news I
have received,”
“ Must you ? —no need; I have overheard it nearly
all, and, as listeners proverbially hear no good of
themselves, was not surprised to find myself relegated
to the hospital ship; but what Charlton can have
done to invoke the displeasure of the powers I cannot
think, since he is writing farewell letters—with tears in
his eyes, Hilda—to the girls he leaves behind him.
Fancy the vacuum here and in Sydney when his curly
head disappears off ‘ the block.’ ‘ Take him for all
in all ’ they ‘ ne’er will look upon his like again.’ ”
“ Well, since you accompany him, George, there
will no doubt be two harrowing vacancies to fill; but
do not despair.”
“ They will not be empty long ; is that the lesson
you desire to inculcate, Miss Haviland ? ”
“ Precisely, Captain Charlton ; my hidden thoughts
expressed.”
“ Assan, I have not written to the Fells ; shall we
ride over there and take our unvalued presence out of
this lady’s way ? ”
“ Very well; if you and Hilda walk round the ter-
race I will bring your horse to meet you.”
“ Shall you be long, Charlie ?” my darling asks.
“ Hours and hours, dear.”
“ Why, surely not; you will not stay to dinner?”
“ Oh ! I think so ; we can ride home by moonlight,
or to-morrow.”
“ To-morrow ! —when you go to Sydney the day
after.”
“Why not? —our vacant places are soon filled.” (I


some of Aunt Margaret’s military friends’ families, you
know; and then from there to the hospital ship
among the coral reefs, to take care of George and
Charley if they are unfortunate enough to get on
board, will perhaps be an easy transit. I can hear
George calling me, and must tell him the evil news I
have received,”
“ Must you ? —no need; I have overheard it nearly
all, and, as listeners proverbially hear no good of
themselves, was not surprised to find myself relegated
to the hospital ship; but what Charlton can have
done to invoke the displeasure of the powers I cannot
think, since he is writing farewell letters—with tears in
his eyes, Hilda—to the girls he leaves behind him.
Fancy the vacuum here and in Sydney when his curly
head disappears off ‘ the block.’ ‘ Take him for all
in all ’ they ‘ ne’er will look upon his like again.’ ”
“ Well, since you accompany him, George, there
will no doubt be two harrowing vacancies to fill; but
do not despair.”
“ They will not be empty long ; is that the lesson
you desire to inculcate, Miss Haviland ? ”
“ Precisely, Captain Charlton ; my hidden thoughts
expressed.”
“ Assan, I have not written to the Fells ; shall we
ride over there and take our unvalued presence out of
this lady’s way ? ”
“ Very well; if you and Hilda walk round the ter-
race I will bring your horse to meet you.”

like to tease “ my queen,” who takes all this literally
and with a becomingly serious face.)
“ Hilda, why didn’t you show me your cousin Mar-
guerite’s photo. ? How wonderfully handsome she is
When I can get home from the war I shall go straight
to London, to see if she equals my expectations.”
“ Give my love to her, then, Captain Charlton, and
say how glad we were to spare you.”
“ Thanks, I will; here is George coming with the
horses now. We will not stay, darling, and, when I
am free, your ‘ cross ’ will see me before the northern
‘ bear.’ ”
CHAPTER XIII.
A ROAD TO THE NILE.
After the battle of Abuklea our force pushed on,
faking possession of the wells, where, worn out with
fatigue, thirst, and want of sleep, we camped for the
night; and at three o’clock on Sunday, the 18th of
January, General Stewart having decided on making
a forced march to the Nile, leaving a small garrison
in charge of the wounded, we started cheerily, and
shortly before six the bugles rang out the halt. I had
been assisting my men in the construction of works,
thrown up hastily to afford some protection in the
open plain, when a characteristic note from Gower
was handed me : “ Charteris, Esq. The breakfast
waits ; the solemn import of this announcement will
commend itself to you when you realize how pain-
fully small it is in quantity when compared with
the exceedingly large appetites anxious to devour it.

was handed me : “ Charteris, Esq. The breakfast
waits ; the solemn import of this announcement will
commend itself to you when you realize how pain-
fully small it is in quantity when compared with
the exceedingly large appetites anxious to devour it.
Let me add, that at the present moment I am guard-
ing it with my drawn sword, and was never on more
active service. Therefore, let this our command


suffice. ‘ Stand not upon the order of your coming,’
but come at once.” It is needless to add that such
an invite was one to cherish tenderly, and acknow-
ledge smartly, especially knowing my gallant host’s
aptitude for seeing his table well laid, although the
article of furniture mentioned might be improvised
on the sands of the desert. I found him heading a
dozen other fellows screened round with a few camel
blankets, and sitting on others, lest, as he observed,
“ they should further damage their uniforms,” which,
being anything but uniform in their appearance, added
to the queerly grotesque scene. The coffee scented
fragrantly the sharp morning air, and Lewis, who had
just made his appearance also, rolled a tin to his
host’s feet, and, making a mock salute, fell back to a
place before it.
“ Now then, McCarthy, look alive, here’s my can,”
he called out, pushing a tin forward for filling.
“Oh ! by Jove, now, sure and it wouldn’t go half
round if I filled that,” came the expostulating reply.
“ Well, hang it, then, shove in what you can spare
at the bottom. Nice beef, Gower, eh ? ”
“ Beef ! where? What do you mean ? Is it a fable
or a fraud, or the substance itself?” came in eager
query round the table.
“ Oh, it’s right enough if we could get at it,” says
Gower; “ but why didn’t you open it on the way ?”
“ Open it! Do you think I never say, ‘ Lead us
not into temptation ?’ ”
“ Meaning,” roars M'Carthy, “ that you’d have ate
it all en route. Well done, old fellow, to stick to the
brotherhood.”
“ Since you appreciate the action so highly, perhaps
you can emulate it, Lieutenant,” I remark.
“ Certainly, Charteris, I can cap it with the very
condiment it needs,” and, gravely handing me a small
parcel, he adds, “ May I trouble you to make the


suffice. ‘ Stand not upon the order of your coming,’

“ Certainly, Charteris, I can cap it with the very

parcel, he adds, “ May I trouble you to make the


mustard.” There is a roar at this, and only for
Gower’s “ Stop talking, lads ; don’t you hear the shots
dropping faster, we shall be leaving it to the Arabs,”
the fun would have become furious. As it is, if
appearances are anything, we shall chance to be fewer
at dinner, for the desultory fire has increased in
volume, and the Arabs are evidently beginning to form
in military array. We turn out, and are soon in
position, answering their salutes, the medical corps
passing among us as they bear away our fellows who
have fallen under the sharpshooters’ bullets.
For hours this continues, under a cloud of smoke
and dust, and we presently find our brave General
shot down, and in the hands of the surgeon. Colonel
Wilson takes the command now, and inspecting
quietly the movements of the Arabs, he by-and-by
gives an order to construct a strong earthwork to
shelter the baggage and wounded, and, under a heavy
fire and constant assault, it is completed. Having
decided on the absolute necessity of sending to the
river for water, a column of Guards, cavalry, and
mounted infantry were started in the same order as at
Abuklea, with, right before us, the enemy barring the
way, and keeping a running fusillade, under which
many of our men fell before reaching the rising ground,
behind which lies the Nile.
As the height of the ridge is neared, the Arabs
unite in a tremendous effort to check our advance, but,
taught by experience, it is awaited calmly, and no
entrance is effected now to our square. Their leaders,
mounted magnificently, charge along the line, witli
serried ranks of followers brandishing their spears;
while unceasingly from ours the rain of bullets is
poured forth, and falling in dense masses, their gaps
seem instantly filled, only again to drop beneath the
continuous volley of musketry we are rolling forth.
At last they retreat, and our way is open to the water,

At last they retreat, and our way is open to the water,


after heavy fighting of two hours’ duration. Later, the
road being now open, we escort our wounded com-
rades to the Nile. All through the night, at intervals,
the rebels keep up the firing, and, as the day advances,
Colonel Wilson makes a reconnaissance in force on
Metemneh, which, if life had been of little value, we
could have carried. But for the present our leader
contents himself with observation only, and in the
din of the firing down the Nile comes three of
“ Gordon’s ” steamers. Three cheers are given for
the “ Khartoum Contingent,” and presently another
steamer hails in sight, towing a barge of provisions.
Hurrah again, for we, knowing little of the finale,
deem our troubles ended. The steamers, presenting
rather a battered appearance, have been on the look-
out for us above Metemneh for nearly a month. If
any prescience of the fate of the brave defender
whose aid had reached us, and whom we expected
soon to see, could have come to us, we should have
bivouacked that night with far graver spirits than the
different groups of men presented. Our camp had
been shifted to a more advantageous position, and a
large convoy of our force was returning to Gadkul,
the transport they took with them being intended to
bring back much larger supplies for our troops who
are preparing to go on the offensive to-morrow. The
enemy appears to have received large reinforcements
at Metemneh, with which they may take action.
Lieut.-Colonel Gascoigne and Colonel Stuart Wortley
accompany Colonel Sir Charles Wilson and a
small band of the Royal Sussex to Khartoum on two
of the steamers, while Captain Lord Charles Beresford
remains here for the present, taking charge of the
remaining two, which will be useful for reconnoitring
purposes. So, with eager anticipation, the future
was prepared for —a future fraught only with disap-
pointment and regret.

UNDER THE ACACIAS.
“ Well, really, Charlton, what excuse are you going
to make for dancing the night away like this ?”
“ It will be more to the purpose, George, if you
tell me the line you intend taking.”
“ Oh ! I’m as usual the victim of circumstances—
always am where pretty girls are concerned ; besides,
I haven’t the honour of standing exactly in your shoes.”
“No ; you’d better not let me catch you trying to.
I shall evolve all worry ‘is worse than useless,’ and
here we are. Take the horses round, like a good
fellow; lam going into the garden.” I can see Hilda
as I open the light gate, and I know, by the tranquil
quietness she assumes so well, something of the pain
she is hiding. I had intended to diplomatize, but
there is no need. The sweet, fair face is clouded by
no anger as she turns to me—“ You are late, Charlie,
or no —I think I must mean you are early ”
“ I am Well, never mind, dear, something
I will not say to you. Are you going to forgive me ? ”
“ For finding them prettier at the Fells than I
am?”
“ They are not prettier.”
“ Well, nicer; more attractive; something you like
better, at any rate.”
“ No, darling, it is none of these things. Believe
that their’s is a passing hold, born of the hour only,
and when I am far away no memory of them mars
my thought of you. Are you content, dear, and am
I forgiven ? ” The soft, grey eyes shine as they are
lifted to me, radiant with the love no words can speak;
and down through all the after years, long after the
white lids have closed on them for ever, I reproduce
her so.

WHAT A LETTER SAID.
It is the same drawingroom in London, and, ap-
parently, a bright fire is still needed to raise the
temperature to the acme of comfort required by its
inmates, who are again the same as when we last
met them. Outside the snow has given place to
golden and purple crocuses, whose bright flowers
contrast vividly with the fast disappearing snowdrops.
Overhead the light grey clouds sail on, with, here and
there, bright touches of blue sky. Marguerite, as
usual, is the retailer of the news, and from her letter
she proceeds : “ George is going to the front with
Captain Charlton, who is recalled; they start at once,
while ‘ our Contingent ’ also sails in a fortnight, for
Suakim direct, in steamers chartered for the purpose.
Hilda, who volunteered to join a nursing staff, is not
needed, because they are not intending to take out
any such extraneous assistance, at present, at all
events. So I see no way in which her services can be
utilized, unless she joins some friends (military people
of course) going there from here, or, failing that, comes
to you in London for assistance to the same end.
You may perhaps feel surprised that I am willing she
should go, but she is really so suitable for anything
like that, and is so entirely oblivious of self, that her
services would be just the kind to be quietly useful.
What can the lawyers want her for at home? unless she
has more power than we thought over the small fortune
from the interest of which she derives her income.
I have told her this, but it is only conjecture, since
she knows nothing herself, and I can tell her nothing.”

lam not self-sacrificing. Rest contented, Aunt; I
have no inclination for such service. One in a family
is enough to keep the world going with those high-
flown ideas ; a ‘little leaven ’ is all that is needed.”

no time, and into a hospital, where I should die
quietly, doing my duty, and be forgotten. As it is, I
shall most probably marry one of the heroes—they
will nurse for me—that is if he brings honours enough
to match my fortune. Now, don’t scold, dear, and
don’t look horrified, for only think what the penalty
would be if I reformed.”

have Hilda sent on. I can arrange that, I think, if
she really desires to go, though, if she comes here, I
shall offer her to stay for the London season instead.”

midway on a Lancers or a Waltz Cotillon ? ”

regimental ones.”

you eschewed the practice; and, rely upon it, the only

FAREWELL.
The breakfast-room at Harrow, on the morning of
farewell, is tenanted by three, when Dr. Assan, turn-
ing to his cousin, says, “ It is not good-bye for long,
Hilda ; I shall see you in blue glasses out at the front
soon, you know. She will be arguing with me as to
the proper use of splints, and how to apply bandages;
and with you, Charlton, as to the efficiency of your
troop. We know the determined character of our
young lady, though, and ‘ forewarned is forearmed.’ I
am going to my mother now, little one,” he adds.
“ Keep up, dear, for her sake and your own.
Charlton, in ten minutes we must start.”
Ten minutes ! the trouble of ten average lifetimes
may be suffered while those moments pass.
“ Darling,” I ask, “ when I am gone, shall you
remember the pain I have sometimes caused you?”
“ Never ! oh, no, indeed. I only think how glad I
am you love me,” and the little head of waving chest-
nut nestles closer.
“If I have seemed forgetful, dear, it has been only
seeming; and out yonder, when I think of someone
whom I love dearly, you will know whose name she
bears.”
“ And you,” she whispers, “ out of all your friends,
the people you have met at home and here—who

thronged the paths which echoed with their shouts,
and many hands that had never met before were
clasped that day in kindly farewell. The ships,
thronged from decks to royals, were one moving mass
of life, while flags from bowsprit to peak fluttered
gaily in the sunshine. Steamers conveying friends
and admirers of the cause lay out in the stream,
filled to overflowing, waiting to join the friendly
escort that would only give their last farewells when
they parted company with the troopships beyond the
Heads.
■ And now, formed on the quay, the Governor
addresses the men with the words of praise their
gallant volunteering merits; and then in bands they
march on board. The lines are cast off, and the
troopships soon in motion, amid the salutes of guns,
and the shouts of thousands from sea and shore. The
accompanying steamers and yachts fall in, and follow
them along the water way. The Heads are cleared in
company, and then, out on the open ocean, sound

“ You ! you ! I have no need to think of them
before I answer,”
Assan’s step sounds heavily across the hall. She
has heard him, too, and the small cold fingers close
tightly over mine. “Be brave, dear,” I whisper, “ I
must go.” There is no answer in words, but the
little hands clasp firmer, and I cannot bear to loose
them.
“ For my sake, darling.” Their hold relaxes, and
she turns to me with a brave effort at control. My
time for parting is already past, as I stoop to kiss
her.
CHAPTER XVII.
THE MARCH OF THE CONTINGENT.
It is unlikely that any of those who assisted in the
farewell services offered on behalf of the New South
Wales Contingent are likely to forget how impressive
they were, or how, as the afternoon sunlight streamed
through the windows of St. Andrew’s Cathedral
across the scarlet coats of the men, with their grave,
determined faces, and flecked the white robes of the
choristers w 7 ith crimson and purple, the great mass of
the people assembled there joined earnestly in the
hope expressed, that these, our troops, might yet
return, crowned with victory, from the scene of their
warfare, to the country and friends they were so soon
to leave behind.
Preparing for their departure formed, of course, the
leading feature in the lives of those to whose care it
had been entrusted, and efficiently and well they
performed the almost incredible amount of labour
allotted to them. The industry and perseverance
with which each worked their own department, and


the unity which pervaded the whole, assisted greatly
in producing that thoroughness and completeness
which, from the inception of the movement to its
close, marked its progress ; and it need scarcely be
added that it was the information most eagerly sought
for in the news of the day ; so that, when it became
known that the steamships Iberia and Australasian
had been selected to convey our men to the seat of
war, it also became a matter of interest to the general
public at once to know their qualifications for the
purpose. The Iberia had been already used for the
same end by the British Government in 1882, during
which time she had on one occasion carried nearly 1,500
men. Her loading from here was to consist of 600 men,
accompanied by 26 officers, a large part of the stores,
and also most of the ammunition ; and the fittings
had been so well arranged that the comfort of every
member of the troop seemed to have been individually
considered.
The second transport, the Australasian , was also
arranged eminently well for the service required of
her, she carrying 137 officers and men and 201
horses. The work of loading, provisioning, and
providing reading and amusement for the voyage,
purchasing and training horses, recruiting and drilling
men, arranging the ambulance department with all its
needful paraphernalia, went busily on till Tuesday, the
3rd of March, dawned brightly on a cloudless morn-
ing, ushering in the day of embarkation. And let no
one who reads this written record wonder if it seems
brief and weak when they remember the widely
spread enthusiasm the event of that day invoked.
From every window and scrap of vantage ground
along the route of march—from every balcony and
verandah —waving handkerchiefs and falling flowers,
and scattered rice, united with heartfelt greetings,
met the Contingent’s eye and ear, while thousands


thronged the paths which echoed with their shouts,
and many hands that had never met before were
clasped that day in kindly farewell. The ships,
thronged from decks to royals, were one moving mass
of life, while flags from bowsprit to peak fluttered
gaily in the sunshine. Steamers conveying friends
and admirers of the cause lay out in the stream,
filled to overflowing, waiting to join the friendly
escort that would only give their last farewells when
they parted company with the troopships beyond the
Heads.
■ And now, formed on the quay, the Governor
addresses the men with the words of praise their
gallant volunteering merits; and then in bands they
march on board. The lines are cast off, and the
troopships soon in motion, amid the salutes of guns,
and the shouts of thousands from sea and shore. The
accompanying steamers and yachts fall in, and follow
them along the water way. The Heads are cleared in
company, and then, out on the open ocean, sound
the last farewells, caught up and echoing from deck
to deck. It is all over, they go their way—on till
they meet the horizon, and vanish from our view.

Major, don’t bang the door. You can buy more.”
“Can I? Where —in the sea? Explain yourself.
Oh, yes ; tears. They won’t bring the collars back
though, but thought might have kept ’em.”
“ That’s right, Miss Haviland, go and get a cup of
tea ;it will refresh you. And, Mrs. A., see you order
the stewardess to give me a foot-bath of hot water
to-night. My left foot’s swelling, and that’s a sign of
gout ” . .
“ Are you Miss Haviland, Miss ? Then, this is
your stateroom. I will send you the tea, and come
to you again if you want me. Just now I am very
busy,” and the stewardess goes, leaving Hilda very
glad of the silence and rest that ensues, which enables
her to answer the letter from her lawyer far better
than she could have done in the hurry of farewells
preceding her departure.
“To Mr. John Staines, Solicitor," Gray’s Inn,
London.
“ Dear Sir, —Your long, kind, explanatory letter
arrived just before I left Harrow for Sydney. I thank
you very greatly for the kindly feeling it expresses,
as also your care of my interests through all
these years. I shall be glad to receive the letter of
my ancestor to which you refer, and if you kindly
send it me, to the care of ‘ Major Airlie, Suakim,’
it will most likely come safely. Do not be vexed
with me that I did not follow so old a friend’s advice
and come home. There are springs of action in all
hearts, I dare say, that, lying below the surface, are
mostly undreamt of by others ; and I will tell you,
lest you should think me ungrateful, that I only
follow where my heart has already gone. This con-
fidence (which is surely the smallest return I can


make to your years of kindness) will be respected, I
am sure, I have a strange, lonely feeling that, as all
my people have died by some unlooked-for event,
I shall do the same. In that case I shall have left
instructions for you, which I am sure you will carry
out. I write this on board the steamer which is
carrying me to my warlike destination, where I hope
I may be useful to many whose friends w'ould find it
difficult to come so far. Dear sir, I wish you all the
happiness you could desire for yourself, and to my
father’s friend and my own, subscribe myself,
“ Yours most sincerely,
“ Hilda Haviland.”
“You have been writing, dear. Are you busy?”
“ No, indeed, Mrs. Airlie. Pray, come in. I
have finished one letter, which is all I shall do to-day.
Were the Major’s collars found ?”
“Oh yes, dear ! In his own trunk, too, where he
had put them ; but do you know he worried me so
about them, I have quite forgotten something he
asked me to remember.”
“ Can’t you ask him what it was?”
“ Ask him ! But, of course, you do not know him ;
besides, he is asleep now, and I am going on deck.
When you are rested will you come ? ”
“ Certainly. I will find a scarf and follow you.”
“ You are an experienced traveller, Mrs. Airlie, or
you would never have found so pleasant a place.”
“Well, I think myself our chairs are just where
they should be. The awning is nice and shady, isn’t
it ? Now, if the Major only stays dowmstairs, we
shall be comfortable.”
“ If you please, ma’am, the master says would you
come below a minute.”
“There ! I knew I shouldn’t have an hour’s rest; I
must go.”

“Well, Major, what do you want?”
“ Hot water.”
“To drink? Do you want your spirit flask as
well ?”
“ No ; to dip my head into.”
“ I wish you could be reasonable. Stewardess, bring
some hot water. Shall I rouse you when it comes?”
“Pm not asleep, Mrs. Airlie.”
“Major! Major!”
“ Well ? ”
“ There’s your hot water.”
“In a half-pint jug and a glass ! Do you suppose
I’m going to put my foot in either of those, ma’am ?
Oh, yes ! tears again ; but you couldn’t recollect a
foot-bath.”
“ I knew I shouldn’t get back to you in time for
any conversation. It was the hot water I had for-
gotten, and there was such a scene.”
“Won’t you sit down now? How quiet the sea
looks to-night; we are fortunate in our weather.”
“ Very. But you were going below, and lam sure
you must be tired; I think I will accompany you.”
Letter from Miss Haviland to Miss Margaret
Asher, the elder.

thank her); and, if you have not already posted, pray

is occupied, with the other three ladies, having ex-

being almost as smooth as it would be in harbour.
Mrs. Airlie is writing to you, so that I need not
enlarge. I send my kindest wishes to yourself and
Marguerite.”
“What is it, stewardess?”
“ I am sent by Mrs. Airlie, Miss, to know if there
is anything I can do for you.”
“ Thank you; tell her no.”
“She says, Miss, are you going on deck ? ”
“ Almost directly.”
“ Did you miss me, Mrs. Airlie ? I am afraid I
seem unsociable. I have been writing to Aunt Mar-
garet, as I suppose it will be well to have all our
letters in readiness to send on when we land.”

says.”

be at the bottom of the sea now, eh ? that wouldn’t
be far, would it, ma’am ? What’s its depth, eh ? ”

“Oh yes, Mrs. Airlie, much he knows about
horses.”
“ I thought you meant the ship.”

with four legs, that always wants looking after ? ”
“How shall you take him, Major, when you land?”
“ Make a parcel of him, my dear, and pack him on
a camel.”
“ There, Miss Haviland, that’s exactly his way,
always. He never makes anything clear. It’s so kind
of you to close the door so that I cannot hear him.
Thomas is not overboard, you know; he’ll be in the
third cabin, where he belongs. The Major took his
passage for him to be there, paid the money, and had
a receipt to that effect; but of course he wouldn’t
look for him there. If he doesn’t happen to be in
the horse box, sitting beside the horse, the Major
comes straight to me, just as if I had guaranteed to
produce him. You have your book to finish yet,
haven’t you ? And I shall go to sleep; How very
nice it would be if only we could be left alone.”

At Halfayah, four Krupp guns had been got into

approaching Ondurman they found that the report of
its having fallen into the enemy’s hands was only too
true, for from there also a heavy fire was opened.
Things looked even worse when passing the island of
Tuti, for that, lying just outside Khartoum, was also
in the possession of their foes; and when later, press-
ing up under a storm of bullets, they discovered to
their surprise that, instead of being hailed as deliverers
by the beleaguered garrison, they were repulsed by an
enemy who took up the firing from which they had
already suffered so much, their astonishment culmin-
ated in anxiety and regret, for it became evident that
their aid must have arrived too late to be of service to
the gallant General who had so bravely, and at such
fearful hazard, defended the city. It was too late , for
on the 20th of January treachery had already opened
its gates. Finding it impossible to effect a landing,
they were compelled to retreat out of the range of the
firing. And on their passage back, the two steamers
having unfortunately stranded, the force was landed
on an island, where they entrenched themselves
against the attacks of the rebels. News of the fall of
Khartoum was sent by a messenger, who, going ashore,
after the stranding of the steamers, went on foot and
by boat to Gubat, from whence the news of the
disaster was sent across the desert to Lord Wolseley;
and shortly after, Colonel Stuart Wortley having
arrived in a small boat with further details, a second
message was promptly forwarded, both of which
arrived safely at their destination.
The unforeseen news which has come in naturally
alters the position of affairs at Gubat, and it becomes

Gower and Lewis, who are both among those who
leave, come to my quarters for a farewell smoke
before starting, and the former is (for him) exception-
ally quiet. Presently he says, “ Charteris, old fellow,
you know how I like the service, and will not mis-
understand me, I am sure, but I have a feeling that
I have had my last orders, and am going on my last
duty. We lost Donne coming up, a good thing, poor
lad ; he went before he knew of our reverses, and
while we were yet en route . I hate a retreat; it
may be truest judgment, and here it is, but I cannot
bear it. If there were orders for a ‘ forlorn hope ’
on Khartoum I’d rather head it. Don’t say it would
be downright madness and bad generalship ; of course
I know it would, but if I only had the chance I should
like to score a success before I go.”
While he speaks, I think of poor Donne’s “for
we have won,” and of the many gallant fellows who
have passed from out our ranks and are filling soldiers’
graves, and I cannot help re-echoing the wish that
we had been successful, and our path onward to
victory.
There are few present, I think, who are not of the
same mind, if bent brows and stern faces are any index
to their thoughts.
The measured tramp of many feet sounds near. It
is the convoy starting. A few brief words of farewell, a
parting cup, and they go out into the darkness, and,
falling into their places, are soon lost to view.
Later we hear that, meeting a body of the Mahdi’s
troops who were escorting guns and supplies from
Khartoum to the rebels at Metemneh, a severe
skirmish ensued, lasting fully an hour, after which the
enemy retreated. When I see the lists of dead and
wounded, I find that they are dead.

RELIABLE INFORMATION.
Letter from Dr. George Assan, Suakim, to Mr.
John Staines, Solicitor, Gray’s Inn,
“Dear Sir, —You desired to be made aware of our
arrival, and to receive some description ‘ of a reliable
nature’ of the city. Do you mean by that that you do
me the honour of relying on my judgment and probity
to describe clearly and truthfully what I see, or is it a
hint that ‘traveller’s tales’ will not go down with you?
In either case, my best course is to proceed. We
landed then four days ago, and Charlton and myself
both agreed that as the first thing to do was to report
ourselves, the second was undoubtedly to have a look
round. The town is built on a Madrepore coral
island, connected to the mainland by a fortified
causeway. The houses are grouped closely, and the
ascent to the hill is very gradual, though some are
exceedingly steep and very bare. The ravines, or
gullies, are clothed usually with mimosa, whose growth
rarely exceeds a man’s height, and is often dwarfed to
only two or three feet. It is from here that the pro-
posed line of railway starts. We are informed that the
Arabs are perpetually harassing our men, and a few
Gatlings that are mounted on the roofs are in pretty
constant use, sweeping a few of them out of the way.
They are no mean foes, it is said, and fight des-
perately, showing little mercy. We had a glimpse of
them last night, when they came down in large num-
bers, and commenced a pretty brisk fire ; but a mine
had been laid, and their reception was more surprising
than they had anticipated, many of their bodies reach-
ing a height their minds had never soared to. What
became of the survivors we could not see, but these
attacks, especially at night, are very constant.

“It is extremely hot, and we are in great anxiety
about the garrisons at Kassala and Sanheit, whom it
is impossible to relieve at present. It is reported here
that the Mahdi has retreated southward to ‘ Abba
Island’ on the Nile (where he formerly lived, quite in
the odour of sanctity), and that there is great dis-
content at Khartoum among his followers, owing to the
scarcity of food. We therefore presume that the un-
settled state of the country prevents the Nile gardeners
from growing the dourrha (a small species of Indian
corn which is used to make bread), and the egg plant
and melons, which are generally pretty plentiful.
Coffee grows wild in Abyssinia, and the natives send
the tiny berry (which is, of course, very inferior to

soften as they follow their movements. Soft voices
speak gentle words of hope and cheer, while light
fingers, whose touch is scarcely felt, apply to wounds
the dressings they require. They were not sent, but
they were wanted here.
“ Nurse ! ”
“ I am here,” Hilda answers gently, kneeling be-
side the bed to spare all unnecessary effort on the
speaker’s part.
“ What did the doctor say this morning ? You
told him about my wife and children ? ”
“ Indeed I did, and there is nothing but good
news for you. You have borne enough already in
losing your arm, and there is no dread of gangrene
now. You will be well enough to go with the first
who are sent invalided home. Do you feel better
now your mind is set at rest ? I am sure you do.
Why, in a fortnight you will be helping me, carrying
round my medicines.”
She has given her words of comfort here, and
passes on, stopping to listen to the laboured breath-
ing of a young life fast passing the border land of

of comfort will suffice, and the great promise and hope

falls in loving accents on the failing ear. “ Father, I
will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with
me where I am.” There is a silence almost felt in
its intensity, and then from the dying lad come the
words, *‘Our Father,” and Hilda, through falling
tears, points him to that loving father, who forgiving,
not blaming, the prodigal son, “ ran, while he was
yet a great way off, and fell on his neck and kissed
him.” “ Thy kingdom come.” It has already come
for him, for out of the darkness he has gone to
light.

soften as they follow their movements. Soft voices
speak gentle words of hope and cheer, while light
fingers, whose touch is scarcely felt, apply to wounds
the dressings they require. They were not sent, but
they were wanted here.
“ Nurse ! ”
“ I am here,” Hilda answers gently, kneeling be-
side the bed to spare all unnecessary effort on the
speaker’s part.
“ What did the doctor say this morning ? You
told him about my wife and children ? ”
“ Indeed I did, and there is nothing but good
news for you. You have borne enough already in
losing your arm, and there is no dread of gangrene
now. You will be well enough to go with the first
who are sent invalided home. Do you feel better
now your mind is set at rest ? I am sure you do.
Why, in a fortnight you will be helping me, carrying
round my medicines.”
She has given her words of comfort here, and
passes on, stopping to listen to the laboured breath-
ing of a young life fast passing the border land of
death. Again she kneels, but here no earthly word
of comfort will suffice, and the great promise and hope
for all time, whose realization stretches on to eternity,
falls in loving accents on the failing ear. “ Father, I
will that they also whom Thou hast given me be with

“ You have made your rounds, dear ? ” Dr. Assan
asks her later.
“ Yes. I am going to put these flowers on the
table now No, they are not real. Did they deceive
you into believing they were ? At a little distance
from the beds I think my patients may be deluded,
too. I have scented them to that very end.”
“ Why not keep them here to adorn your own
room? Do you think the men will appreciate
them ?”
“ You pretend to be a disbeliever in my means for
recovery ; see how soon I will have some of them
about.”
“ Oh, if you can do that it will be capital, for there
has been some more fighting in the advance, and I
have more patients that I must find room for some-
where. You need not look pale; there is a letter for
you from Charlton. He is all right so far.”
Some two hours later, her duties over for a time,
Hilda broke the seal of her cherished note and
read: —
“En route. Here we are after ‘suffering unmen-
tionable,’ as my orderly says, by which you are to
understand that he didn’t have his coffee in a china
cup as at Harrow this morning, for to anyone whose

allude to the impoverishment of the Haviland estates.
During many years I have sold at different times all

which I have no control) to the direct line. Such an

it is—
“My brother Noel and myself were early in the
year 1739 stationed at Carthagena. We were under
arms in a quarrel with Spain, under the command of
General Wentworth, During my stay I made the
acquaintance of a lady who in every way reciprocated
my regard, and most of my spare time I spent in
her society. I noticed at this time that Noel also
frequently absented himself from quarters without

I was sent for by the General to give him some


important information which had been entrusted to
me for him, and through this was delayed, but felt no
great apprehension, knowing my plans were so well
matured that it would be difficult to upset them.
On gaining the church I entered and apprised the
priest of my arrival, when, to my surprise, he
informed me that he had already gone through the
service with a lady who had arrived first, and alone,
to a gentleman who had followed her. The church
was almost in darkness, and when he handed me the
register it was with difficulty I could read her name,
the hand had so trembled that had written it. I
looked for his—the man who had supplanted me,
and read—Noel Haviland.
“An interval of twelve months followed, during
which we never met, then he returned. I do not
know his reason for leaving her, but I do know that
while he lives here he is separated from her even as
I am. And as I know also he shall lose, through
me, all that I should have lost from those that
preceded me if I had married her, and it had become
known, I feel that there is still some justice pursuing
him. A letter, which I have never read, is enclosed.
It came from her, asking, I dare say, for forgiveness.
I am a man of action , not words ; I neither read nor
answered it, I cherish the belief that acting as I
have done will probably so impoverish my immediate
descendants that they will be unable to marry and
reside here, and that shortly even the name will pass
away for ever. I have suffered a great wrong; but if
I succeed in this, I shall have achieved a great
revenge.”

The other, addressed to him, was not, as he had


surmised, for forgiveness (perhaps the writer had known
him too well to deem it probable he would accord it).
It was simply an explanation exonerating Noel from
the blame he had unjustly suffered.
“ I had met Noel,” it said, “ before I ever saw you,
and had liked him well enough to agree to be his wife.
Afterwards, when you loved me, I knew well the
difference in my feeling to you, and my one thought
was to keep you apart, and marry you, trusting to
chance afterwards if the fact became known. I
thought you would have forgiven me anything but
broken faith with you. The arrangement for a secret
marriage suited me well, but Noel also pressed me to
agree to the same ceremony. I declined to him,
until he spoke of you, saying you should use your
influence with me, and I acceded then to prevent
that. He arranged to meet me on the same evening
you had chosen, and I could only get him away by
agreeing to everything, the only stipulation I made
being that he should meet me an hour later than
yourself, and at the close of the vesper service. It was
the latest moment he would allow me, and we parted,
I hoping to bejtwrwife and far away before he could
arrive. Do you remember how anxious I seemed
when you left me, and how you laughed when I said
‘do not forget ? ’ I was at the church porch first, and
nearly twenty minutes had gone before I saw you
(as I thought). We waited for nothing, I never looked
or knew what I said or signed j it was all done directly,
and we hurried to the boat which put us on board the
brig. In my hurry I did not notice it was large for a
yacht. The sailors had been round us in the boat
and I had not looked up. Under the lamp I turned
to you for rest, and happiness, and love, and found
him. I said nothing—how could I ? Your bitter
letter reaching him told him all you suspected, and he
left me. I was glad. My son, removed from me, is in

The letter written from Havre had never been read
before, and she who had suffered so much through the
weakness of this woman yet pitied her for the desola-
tion of her life.
She lit a taper, and, reducing the letters to ashes,
passed out to her work in the ward.

the weeks go forward in daily duties, done to ever-
changing figures, until those working there feel it a
sort of neutral ground of neither life or death, but
analogous to both. Many stern battles are fought in
those quiet wards as the long procession of inmates
come and go, and often those for whom the “ scythe
of the reaper ” has seemingly been raised have escaped
being garnered into his sheaves. No great events
occur to mark the days, and they follow each other in
an uninterrupted succession of constantly-recurring
duties, and, becoming accustomed to the seeming
unchangeableness, Dr. Assan (standing on the deck
to give orders to the bearers how to raise the wounded
with least pain from the boat) starts in surprise, for
here, among many strange, are two familiar faces—
Charlton and Charteris. The former, apparently suffer-

shading his unconscious friend from the glare of the
mid-day sun, when a friendly voice calls him by name.
He smiles an answer, and all are soon on board,
where, placed in wards, skilful hands perform willing
service for their ease and comfort.
“ You will have to bear an operation, Charlton, I
am sorry to tell you,” the Doctor says.
“Shall I? Then' get it over soon, before Hilda
knows I am here.”
“ That can be managed easily, since she is one of
the night nurses by preference, and will not come in
till eight.”
“Is Charteris looked to?” Charlton asks. “He
needs it more than I. The men of his company
adore him, but there was little could be done out
there in all that heat and fighting (over their very
bodies, sometimes half-buried in the sand). I wonder
how he has lived at all.”

constitution which has withstood so much will hardly
rally now, “He was among the first I saw and
attended to,” he answers, “ and is in bed, with a
nurse beside him. Now, shall I see to you ?”
The hands of the clock in the ward are nearing
eight when, opening his eyes from the short oblivion
that sleep has snatched for him from pain, Charlton
sees Hilda kneeling beside him, as she had done
long before in the great forest depths; and with her
comes a feeling of repose, which to him, from out
the glare, and heat, and strife, makes her seem surely
the guardian spirit of peace and tranquillity. Again
the days flow on to weeks, but now to Hilda they are
radiant with happiness and full of light. Surely time
turns his hour-glass quicker now, since all is well,
and he is here with her.
And what of him? He glances at her as she
moves about among the convalescent on the deck,
soothing the fractious with soft kindly speech, while
resting the weary with some quickly-devised aid.
And remembering all that she has been to him
(even here), he thinks of the many hours she has
beguiled from weariness into the realms of her bright
fancy, of her tenderness and warm, enduring love.
And yet, deep down in the recesses of his heart, he
feels that though he fills her life till the full cup will
scarcely hold the measure, she cannot so fill his, for,
needing excitement and change, the very love that
tries unceasingly to fit his every mood becomes
monotonous, and “ poor little Hilda, she is too
gentle and quiet,” is his frequent thought.
The days that are so full of life to her, to him
are grown so wearisome that even her soft eyes
and Assan’s friendly voice cannot awaken much
response.

“ How you two live here,” he says, as all three
stand together one afternoon on deck, “ I cannot
think; surely we shall soon get the sick leave for
home.”
“ You may think yourself fortunate, Charlton, that
you ever came, since, without the aid you found
here, you would have been left-handed through your
life,” says the Doctor quietly.
“ Oh, of course, I recognize the obligation, but a
change will help me sooner to return.”
“ What do you say to that, Hilda ? ” the Doctor
asks. “ You have strengthened your bird’s wings, noiv
he uses them for flight.” “ I am coming,” he adds,
in response to a voice which hails him from below.
“ Perfect love gives perfect freedom,” she says
gently.
“ Does it, Hilda ? and if I go are you sure you will
be happy,” asks Charlton, “ and not grieving for me
till I return or meet you out in that bright little bush
home yonder?”
“ I shall be busy,” she says evasively.
“ And I will write to you, dear,” he adds; “ then
when this weary war is over we two must make one
nest together,”
“ Your wings will always want to fly, Charlie.”

looks. Do you think he will recover, Hilda?”
“Never, now his strength is so entirely gone;
nothing revives him.”
“ Do you know you look like death yourself, dear ;
ought you to stay here ? ”
« I am wanted,” she answers ; “ we must all wait
till the war is over.”

“ How you two live here,” he says, as all three
stand together one afternoon on deck, “ I cannot
think; surely we shall soon get the sick leave for
home.”
“ You may think yourself fortunate, Charlton, that
you ever came, since, without the aid you found
here, you would have been left-handed through your
life,” says the Doctor quietly.
“ Oh, of course, I recognize the obligation, but a
change will help me sooner to return.”
“ What do you say to that, Hilda ? ” the Doctor
asks. “ You have strengthened your bird’s wings, noiv
he uses them for flight.” “ I am coming,” he adds,
in response to a voice which hails him from below.
“ Perfect love gives perfect freedom,” she says
gently.
“ Does it, Hilda ? and if I go are you sure you will
be happy,” asks Charlton, “ and not grieving for me
till I return or meet you out in that bright little bush
home yonder?”
“ I shall be busy,” she says evasively.
“ And I will write to you, dear,” he adds; “ then
when this weary war is over we two must make one
nest together,”
“ Your wings will always want to fly, Charlie.”
“Will they, dear? Heaven knows, it is not that
I forget or that fresh faces turn the old ones from my
heart, but I like excitement and change ; anything too
long continued tries me. How ill poor Charteris

There is a little stir alongside. A launch has


come with orders for those on sick leave, and
Charlton’s name is called among the rest.
He looks away from her across the waters. “ I sent
the application in some days ago,” he says.
So it is all over, and he can lightly leave her. Yet,
no, how can she think that, when it is him she
judges? Many changes flit over the speaking
face.
“ Forgive me, dear.”
“ Hush, do not say that! lam willing you should
go. Do not grieve, and when you remember me,
think only that you made me happy.”
All is hurry now ; those who are leaving are
mustered on the deck, and Assan’s hand is grasped
in farewell, while Charlton turns to the fast dis-
appearing throng. There is yet time for a last word.
“ My darling,” he says, raining quick kisses on her
face and hair, “it is only for a little while.”
“ Waiting, sir,” they call to him from the boat.
“ I am coming.”
She is alone, and he, a scarcely visible figure on
the fast receding launch, is soon lost to view.
‘‘ They go down to the outward-bound steamer,”
Assan says. “It was all so sudden, Hilda, and I had
had no previous word to announce their embarkation.”
She bows her head and passes on.
“ Nurse, your watch commenced nearly twenty
minutes ago. Are you coming ? ”
“ Yes.”
It is nearly twelve when the Doctor, who has gone
his rounds, stops by Charteris’ bed and her.
“ Hilda,” he says, “ you are looking very ill, and I
ought to warn you, perhaps, that you are in no con-
dition to bear a heavy strain.”
“ I am only tired, dear.”
“ Charteris will most likely pass away to-night. If
I am wanted, mind you send for me.”

He moves on, and soon the ward is still. The light
glimmers faintly on the suffering faces as she goes
among them. Sleep has fallen on all, and only the
low faint murmurs, wrung from pain, greet her
ear.
The clock ticks loudly in the stillness.
The screen, always the forerunner of death, is
round this bed beside which she rests at last; there
is no change in the still figure here—scarcely
quieter than hers, who, seated beside him, watches
now.
The clock hands change from moving hour to hour,
and all is silent.
When morning comes and the first rounds are
made, they find them so. He needs no watching
now, and she is dead.
Outside a steamer hurries through the waters,
freighted with many hearts, all eager for their home ;
and here among them, his eyes sweeping the sea
that bears him out to life and action, stands Charlton.
The bright day rises fuller to its zenith, and on over
the glancing waves they travel to the ocean.

CHARLTON AND MARGUERITE.
“ And so, Captain Charlton, you have come home

was quite sorry only to see you for so short a time

and is a favourite place of Aunt Marguerite’s. Let me
see: you must have been in London three weeks
now, haven’t you ? ”
“Nearly five, Miss Asher,” he answers laconically.
“ Indeed ;is it so long ? lam never able to
remember arrivals and departures.”
“They are not of sufficient interest to you?” he
asks.
“ I am really afraid they are not.”
He glances at her; and, seeing the golden head
and brilliant gleaming eyes, wishes that his had
been.
“Do you know I quite pity you,” she says. “It
was most unreasonable of Aunt Marguerite to insist on
your staying with us. You will find it all too quiet
and wearisome, I am sure.”
“Nothing is less likely than that where you are,”
he answers.
“Thanks. You make me wish I could prescribe
myself for myself, for I am extremely weary sometimes.”
He thinks that here at least is an advantage for
him, since she shall have no cause for such annoyance
while he remains; and, sketching in vivid colours the
events of the campaign, he tells her of the scenes he
has witnessed on the desert sands. The fighting,
hand to hand ; the hurried marches ; the struggle to
defend the wounded. All is depicted fluently and
well. The blue eyes flash brightly over him as he
goes on, for she is far too interested to complain of
weariness now; and so together, through their
morning walks, and long idle evenings, the days pass
on till he lives only in the sunlight of her presence,
and is now feverishly happy as she listens to his love,
now wildly jealous as she treats it with indifference ;
and, under either phase, finds the time fly swiftly.
“To-morrow we are going to this musical recital,”
she says. “I am really quite glad. Are you?”

“To-morrow we are going to this musical recital,”
she says. “I am really quite glad. Are you?”


“ No ; I would rather we stayed here, dearest.”
“Would you ? So would not I. Why, it’s a week
nearly since we went anywhere. Do you wish me to
fancy I am on a desert island ? ”
“ Are you not happy, Marguerite ? ”
“ I am always happy,” she answers.
“ Here with me ? ”
“ Yes, here with you.”
“ Why do you want change so much, then ? ” he
asks.
“ One swallow does not make a summer,” she
answers lightly.
“ You only say that to annoy ; but I could make a
summer for you all sunshine if you would let me try.”
“ Could you ? I doubt it. Do you know, I always
want to live among a crowd ? ”
“ You would not if you loved, dear,” he answers.
“Yes I should. I should require amusement and
admiration always, I am sure.”
His eyes follow her as she crosses the room, and
stands idly picking dead leaves from off her ferns. She
is royally handsome he thinks, and yet, not for the
first time, he feels a want that he can hardly realize in
her. It is not so much that she does not love him as
he would have her do, but the knowledge forces its
belief into his mind that in herself there is no depth
where any love could root, that always she will consult
her own interest and pleasure first, and only be per-
manently influenced by their dictates. And as he
leaves her, and goes through the busy streets, memory
brings back to him a fair sweet face that almost he
regrets. He thrusts the unbidden presence back; he
has heard nothing of her though he has written, and
a certain recklessness of consequences, always inherent
in him, makes him heedless of the future.

“ Marguerite, have you any intention of answering
Mr. Ellis finally yet ? ” her Aunt asks.
“ Yes, this morning. I have been considering his
proposal, and I think I shall accept it.”
“ But, my dear, do you think it will be for your
happiness ? ”
“ That has been the question, and I think it will.
His fortune is immense, you know, so there would be
every advantage that great wealth could procure.”
u But, my dear, do you love him ? ”
‘‘ I love myself, which is the chief consideration.”
A silence falls between them, and the elder lady’s
face is grave as she passes out, followed soon by
Marguerite.
The heavy curtains that divide the rooms open,
and Charlton, white with pain, and yet with a strange
feeling of relief, vanishes also.

odour of white rose perfumes the air as Assan removes
them. The one directed to himself he breaks the

of Charlton on the ship, and says : —“ You were

with a face whiter than Australian forest or hospital

later he stands in the lawyer’s presence.
“ Can this be true?” he asks, his voice strained to
a harsh whisper.

Evening has fallen on the small cemetery at Suakim.
The setting sun, dying in golden light, fringes the
heavy clouds with radiant edges, and falls aslant a
small white stone, marked only—“ Hilda Haviland.”
Two men in the uniform of the volunteers of New
South Wales stand here, their hands meeting in close
grasp beside the little grave.

were one of them. They are brave fellows, and will
carry the starry cross to victory, lam sure. But you,

Assan, “ and I loved her.”

formed. The two officers join them. “ Ready ! ” —the
ranks fall closer. “ Forward!” and they march on, their

Night’s sable wings are opened, and darkness has
fallen on the hill-side graves, but one star, brighter
than all its fellows, shines on her name.
And far away, on the march or in the trenches, her
memory clings to him, a living, loving presence, that
no time can alter or make less. Tender and true, and
faithful, it throws a radiance over the years that not
even his sorrow or his regret can shadow, for now, at
last, he loves her, and “Love lives Eternal.”
