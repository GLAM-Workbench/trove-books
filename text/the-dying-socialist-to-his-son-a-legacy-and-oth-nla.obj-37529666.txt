THE DYING SOCIALIST TO HIS SON
A LEGACY
And Other Verses
JAMELS CONNOLLY
THE CALL OP THE WORKERS.
Then out from the field and the city,
From workshop, from mill, and from mine;
Despising their wrath and their pity,
We workers are moving in line,
To answer the watchword and token
That Labor gives forth as its own;
Nor pause till our fetters are broken,
And conquered the Spoiler and Drone.

THE DYING SOCIALIST TO HIS SON.
(A LEGACY)
Come here my son, and for a time put up your childish
play.
Draw nearer to your father’s bed, and lay your games
away;
No sick man’s plaint is this of mine, ill-tempered at your
noise,
Nor carping at your eagerness to romp with childish toys.
Thou’rt but a boy, and I a man outworn with care and
strife,
Would not deprive you of one joy thou canst extract
from life;
But o’er my soul comes creeping on death’s shadow, and
my lips
Must give to you a message ere life meets that eclipse.
Slow runs my blood, my nether limbs I feel not, and my
eyes
Can scarce discern, here in this room, that childish form
I prize.
Aye, death’s grim hand is on my frame, and helpless it
lies here,
But to my mental vision comes the power of the seer,
And time and space are now as nought as with majestic
sweep,
I feel my mind traverse the land and encompass the deep.
Search backward over history’s course, or with prophetic
view,
And sounding line of hope and fear gauge man’s great
destiny, too-
The chasm deep ’twixt life and death I bridge at last
to-night.
And with a foot on either side absorb their truth and
light.
And thus, my son, tho’ reft of strength, my limbs slow
turn to clay,
Fired by this light I call you here to hear my Legacy.
“My Legacy!” Ah, son of mine! wert thou a rich man’s
pride,
He’d crown thee with his property, possesions far and
wide,


And golden store to purchase slaves, whose aching brain
and limb
Would toil to bring you luxury as such had toiled for
him.
But thy father is a poor man, and glancing round you
here,
Thou canst see all his property—our humble household
gear.
No will we need by lawyers drawn, no witnesses attest,
To guard for you your legacy, your father’s last bequest.
“Thy father is a poor man,” mark well what that may
mean,
On the tablets of thy memory that truth write bright and
clean,
Thy father’s lot it was to toil from earliest boyhood on,
And know his latest energies for a master’s profit drawn;
Or else, ill-starred, to wander round and huckster-like to
vend,
His freshest store of brain and brawn for all whom date
might send
Across his path with gold enough to purchase Labour’s
power
To turn it into gold again, and fructify the hour
With sweat and blood of toiling- slaves. Like unto us, my
son:
Aye, through our veins since earliest days, ‘tis poor
man’s blood has run-
Yes, son of mine, since History’s dawn two classes stand
revealed,
The Rich and Poor, in bitterest war, by deadliest hatred
steeled,
The one, incarnate greed and crime, disdaining honest
toil,
Had grasped man’s common birthright and treasure
house, the soil,
And standing ’twixt their fellow-men and all that earth
could give,
Had bade them render tribute if they would hope to live,


And, building crime on top of crime, had pushed their
conquests on,
Till, arbiters of life and death, they stood with weapons
drawn,
And blades athirst to drink the blood, on land and over
sea,
Of h im who dared for human rights to stem this tyranny.
They held our lands, our bodies ruled, and strove to
rule the mind,
And Hell itself could not surpass their evil to mankind;
And all who strove for human rights to break their
cursed yoke—
The noblest of our race, my child— went down beneath
their stroke,
And e’er amid earth’s sweetest spots, in nature’s loveliest
haunt.
Each built his fort or castle grim the poor of earth to
daunt.
And issuing forth from walls of stone, high over cliff and
pass.
With sword in hand would gather in the tribute for his class
And, grim emblems of their rule, flaunting to human ken’
ine pit to drown our women, the gibbet for our men
stood aye beside their fortresses, and underneath the
moat.
Tier under tier of noisome cells for those the tyrant smote,
ihmubscrew and rack, and branding rod, and each device
of hell,
Perverted genius could devise to torture men to sell,
(For brief respite from anguish dire to end their wretched
lives)
The secrets of their comradeship, the honour of their
wives,
As fabled upas tree of old, by ancient poets sung,
Consumed with blight each living thing that ’neath its
branches sprung,
The rich man’s power o’er all the earth had spread its
baleful blight,
Respecting neither age nor sex to sate its lust and might


It stole the harvest from the field, the product from the
loom,
Struck down the old man in his age, the young man in
his bloom,
It robbed the carrier on the road, the sailor on the tide
And from the bridegroom of an hour it took the new
made bride,
Such crimes it wrought; not hell itself and its satanic
school
Could fashion crimes to equal those wrought by the rich
man’s rule.
“The past?” Aye, boy, the method’s past; the deed is
still the same.
And robbery is robbery, yet tho’ cloaked in gentler name.
Our means of life are still usurped, the rich man still is
lord,
And prayers and cries for justice still meet one reply—the
sword 1
Tho’ hypocrites for rich men’s gold may tell us we are free,
And oft extol in speech and print our vaunted liberty,
But Freedom lies not in a name, and he who lacks for
bread
Must have that bread tho’ he should give his soul for it
instead;
And we, who live by labour, know that while they rule we
must,
Sell Freedom, brain and limb to win for us and ours a
crust.
The robbers made our fathers slaves, then chained them
to the soil,
For a little longer chain—a wage—we must exchange our
toil.
But open force gave way to fraud, but force again behind,
Prepares to strike if fraud should fail to keep man deaf
and blind;
Our mothers see their children’s limbs they fondled as
they grew,
And doted on, caught up to make for rich men profits new,
Whilst strong men die for lack of work, and cries of
misery swell,
And women’s souls creep shuddering to hell.


These things belong not to the past, but to the present
day—
And they shall last till in our wrath we sweep them all
away.
“We sweep them!” Ah, too well I know my work on
earth is done,
Even as I speak my chilling blood tells me my race is run;
But you, my last-born child, take the legacy I give,
And do as did your father whilst he yet was spared to live.
Treasure ye in your inmost heart this legacy of hate,
For those who on the poor man’s back have climbed to
high estate
The lords of land and capital—the slaves-lords of our age,
Who of this smiling earth of ours have made for us a cage,
Where golden bars fetter men’s souls, and noble thoughts
are aflame
To burn us with their vain desires, and virtue yields to
shame,
Each is your foe, foe of your class, of human rights the
foe,
Be it your thought by day and night to work their over-
throw.
And howso’er you earn your wage, and wheresoe’er you go,
Be it beneath the tropic heat or ’mid the northern snow,
Or closely pent in factory walls, or burrowing in the mine.
Or scorching in the furnace hell of steamers ’cross the
brine.
Or on the railroad’s shining track you guide the flying
wheel,
Or clambering up on buildings high to weld their frames
of steel,
Or use the needle or the type, the hammer, or the pen,
Have you one thought, one speech alone, to all your
fellow-men—
The men and women of your class—tell them their
wrongs and yours,
Plant in their hearts that hatred deep that suffers and
endures,
And treasuring up each deed of wrong, each scornful
word and look,
Inscribe it on the memory, as others in a book


And wait and watch thro’ galling vears the ripening oi
time,
Yet deem to strike before that hour were worse than
folly—crime.
This be your task, Oh, son of mine; the rich man’s hate
to brave,
And consecrate your noblest part to rouse each fellow-
slave,
To speed the day the world await when Labour long
opprest.
Shall rise and strike for Freedom true, and from the
tyrants wrest,
The power they have abused so long, Oh ever-glorious
deed!
The crowning point of history, yet child of bitterest need.
Ah, woe is me; thy father’s eyes shall not behold that day.
I faint and die: child, hold my hand,
Keep—thou—my Legacy.


CLASS-SONG OF THE SLAVE.
Come, workers, sing a rebel song, a song of Love and
Hate —
Of love unto the lowly and of hatred to the great,
The great who trod our fathers down, who steal our
children’s bread,
Whose hand of Greed is stretched to rob the living and
the dead.
Chorus:
Then sing our rebel song as we proudly sweep along,
To end the age-long tyranny that makes for human
tears;
Our march is nearer done with each setting of the sun,
And the tyrant’s might is passing with the passing of
the years.
We sing no song of wailing, and no song of sighs or tears,
High are our Hopes, and stout our hearts and banished
all our fears;
Our Flag is raised above us so that all the world may see
Tis Labor’s faith and Labor’s arm alone can free.
Out from the depths of Misery we march with hearts
aflame,
With wrath against the rulers false who wreck our man-
hood’s name;
The Serf who licks his tyrant’s rod may bend forgiving
knee,
The Slave who breaks his Slavery’s chain a wrathful
man must be.
Our Army marches onward with its face towards the
Dawn,
In trust secure in that one thing the Slave may lean upon;
The Might within the arm of him who knowing Free-
dom’s worth,
Strikes home to banish Tyranny from off the face of
earth.


WHEN LABOR CALLS.
(Air: “The Transvaal National Anthem.”)
When Labor calls her children forth
A waiting world to win,
Earth’s noblest breed—true men of worth—
Her ranks shall enter in.
Then, comrades, all prepare, that we
May hear that call anon,
And drive the hosts of tyranny
Like clouds before the dawn.
And drive our foes,
And drive our foes,
Our foes like clouds before the dawn
Thou knowest long has Labor groaned—
A robbed and beaten thrall—
Whilst Capital on high enthroned;
Reigned, lording over all.
But Time rolled on, and earth and sky
His power to man revealed,
And Science echoes Labor’s cry:
“King Capital must yield,”
King Capital,
King Capital,
King Capital at last must yield.
We work and wait, till womb of time
Shall give fair Freedom birth—
To Labor’s hosts that hope sublime
Regenerates the earth;
And by that hope we toilers fired
To nobler deeds shall be,
That we may guide, by it inspired,
Our Class to Liberty.
To Liberty,
To Liberty,
To guide our Class to Liberty.


FREEDOM’S SUN.
(Air: “Love’s Young Dream.”)
Yes, Freedom’s song, by workers sung,
Rings loud and clear,
O’er every land, in every tongue,
Afar, anear;
Time passeth by,
Old systems die —
Oppression’s course out-run,
But Earth, rejoiced, salutes the light,
Of Freedom’s sun;
O, rejoicing Earth salutes the light
Of Freedom’s sun.
Yes, all men then their lives may live
From grim want free,
And all the joys that life can give,
Their lot shall be;
And care shall fly,
And sea and sky
Acclaim the work well done.
When Earth, rejoiced, salutes the light
Of Freedom’s sun;
O, rejoicing Earth salutes the light
Of Freedom’s sun.
No longer now revolt need hide
In holes and caves,
While they who brave Oppression’s pride
But find their graves.
No tyrant’s ban
Can now make man
The truths of knowledge shun;
All Earth, rejoiced, salutes the light
Of Freedom’s sun;
O, rejoicing Earth salutes the light
Of Freedom’s sun.


Ur r^?^ ers saw the master’s sword
His plunder glean,
But specious fraud and lying word
His thefts now screen;
Yet fraud shall fail
And truth prevail,
And justice shall be done,
When Earth, rejoiced, salutes the light,
Of Freedom’s sun;
O, rejoicing Earth salutes the light
Of Freedom’s sun.


OH, SLAVES OF TOIL.
(Air: “O, For the Swords,” —Irish Melodies.)
When Man shall stand erect at last,
And drink at Wisdom’s fountain,
He to the earth in scorn shall cast,
The chains his limbs are bound in,
Then from his loins a race shall spring,
Fit peer of gods and heroes,
O, blest be they whose efforts bring
That day an hour more near us.
Chorus:
O, slaves of toil, no craven fear,
Or dread of fell disasters,
Need daunt ye now; then up and clear
The earth of lords and masters.
Like brazen serpent raised on high
In Israelite tradition,
Our Cause to each believing eye
Brings health and seer-like vision.
We see the Day when Man shall rise,
And firm on science building,
From Theft’s thick mast of fraud and lies,
Strip all the specious gilding.
O, blest are they whom wind and tide
Are wafting Fortune’s graces,
And blest the man whose blushing bride
Returns his rapt embraces.
And blest is he who has a friend
To shield his name when slandered,
Blest over all they who contend,
And march in Freedom’s Vanguard.


Chorus:
O, slaves of toil, no craven fear,
Or dread of fell disasters,
Need daunt ye now; then up and clear
The earth of lords and masters.
