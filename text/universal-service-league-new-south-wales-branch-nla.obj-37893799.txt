MANIFESTO.
The Prime Minister, in a phrase which every Australian endorses, has declared that Australia
would send her last man and spend her last shilling in the defence of the Empire. This extreme
necessity has not yet arisen. But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the situation is one
of grave anxiety. The existence of the British Empire and all that it stands for, to its own
citizens and to the world at large, is in danger. If the Empire should fall, the rights and liberties
which, to a British community, are as necessary and natural as the air they breathe, will fall
with it. There is not a man, woman or child in the Empire whose interests are not directly
at stake.
Australia has done much. But she has not done enough. Nothing is enough, short of her
utmost. Her efforts are still far short of that. The Mother Country, at enormous cost, has kept
open the Seas with her Navy. She has also found vast sums of money for her Allies. In addition
she has raised and equipped a military force, which, relatively to her population, is very much
larger than our own. In face of these facts, it cannot be said that we have done our share.
Our first duty is to send more men to the front. Lord Kitchener, Sir lan Hamilton, and others,
to whose words we dare not remain indifferent, have appealed to us to do so. This is not all.
Besides sending more men to the fighting line we must so organise the community that every man
and every woman may be able to render the best service of which he or she is capable, to
the Empire’s cause. The War Census Act, recently passed, will furnish the information necessary
to enable this to be done. But meanwhile we must send more men.
We must also prepare for the future. Men cannot be trained in a day. It is wasteful and
criminal to send men inadequately trained into the fighting line. No one knows how long the wax-
will last. No one can say how many men will be wanted or when they will be wanted. Me must
have them ready, in such numbers and at such times, as they are required.
It is now evident that voluntary effort is not meeting these requirements. Even if it were, its
incidence is unjust and often harmful. Men have gone who should have stayed; many more have
stayed who might have gone. Others, with obligations here, would go cheerfully if the State called
upon them to do so, but they hesitate to take the step until the call is clear and definite. The time
lias come for the State to give this call, and at the same time to adjust the burden of military
service with more regard to equity and the public good.
There is but one way to do this. The people of this country through their Parliamentary
Representatives must voluntarily adopt the principle of compulsory and universal war service for
all classes. This principle is already embodied in our Defence Law. In time of war every man
of military age is now liable under clause 60 of the Defence Act to be called up to serve for the
defence of Australia.
But to-day Australia is being defended in the fields of Flanders and on the hills of Gallipoli.
If she is to be saved at all it must be there. If, through some disaster to the armies or fleets of
the Allies, it should become possible for the enemy to land a force in Australia, our hope of suc-
cessfully defending her shores would be slender.
Let us then make it plain to our own Government and to the world at large that we, men and
women alike, are prepared for any sacrifice and eager for any service at home or abroad, in the
battle-field or elsewhere, that may be necessary for the defence of the Commonwealth and the
Empire, and of the principles for which they stand.
With this end in view, the men and women whose names appear on this manifesto have joined
with others in the other States of the Commonwealth to form a Universal Service League. They
represent all classes, creeds and parties. Differing widely, it may be, on all other matters, they
are firmly united in their desire that Australia should play her part in bringing about a speedy
and successful termination of the war, that nothing that she can do shall be left undone to secure
that the lives of her sons shall not have been sacrificed in vain; and that no help which she is
capable of offering to the Empire, in this gravest crisis in its history, shall be withheld.
Branches of the League are being formed in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland West Aus-
tralia, and Tasmania, and this manifesto is being published simultaneously in all the States of the
Commonwealth to-day.


The objects of the Universal Service League are
1. To advocate the adoption for the period of the present war of the principle of universal
compulsory service at home or abroad, in the battlefield or elsewhere; and to support
the Government in providing at the earliest possible moment such organisation as is
necessary to secure the wise and just application of this principle.
2. To secure the passage of legislation for the above purposes; and to assure the Federal
Government that such legislation will command the loyal support of the people of the
Commonwealth.
3. To adopt any other measures calculated to promote the object of the League.
