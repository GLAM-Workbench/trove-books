“ Through much Tribulation.”
thou been called to walk alone’
Through trial and tribulation ?
Dost thou bemoan thy loss of friends,
’Mid sorrow or privation ?
Take heart, sad one ! for suffered thus thy
Lord;
Both men and fiends poured curses on His
head!
Heed not, beloved, the strife of tongues-
Though stones be cast by slander !
In Heavenly places thou dost dwell !
Nought from His love can sunder ;
E’en though, in spite, thy weary soul is
hunted
By thy familiar friend in whom thou trusted.
Christ will not leave you comfortless
’Mid pain and persecution;
Ministering spirits, numberless.
Will aid in thy redemption:
Tho’ foes conspire to bring false accusation,
Abide in Him ! nought can bring separation!


Have they cast out thy name as dirt ?
So treated they thy Master!
Through all, His great ideal assert,
In face of all disaster :
In Him confide, when sore perplex’d, dis-
tress’d,
He bore thy sorrows, and in Him is rest
’Twas even so with Him the same,
’Gainst Him the heel was lifted ;
Pierced by His own, they mocked His name>
By thorns and nails they wounded
Thy loving, sympathizing, suffering Friend
The First and Last,' who loveth to the End.
Thy Lord through sufferings made perfect!
Art thou refined by less P
The trial thou canst not then reject
Which purifies thy dross —
Weans thee from earth’s vain hollowness,
To clothe with His own righteousness.


Then dry Thy tears ; enough for thee.
While waiting for His coming,
The servant to be as his Lord,
Like him at His returning : [ing ,*
The age grows dim, and time is fast declin-
Behold, He comes ! then cease thy sad
repining.
Endowed with floly Spirit’s power,
Awake to joys supernal;
You may not know the day, the hour.
But glory comes eternal!
Partaker of a nature so divine !
In H is resplendent beauty thou shalt shine.
Through tribulation great thou shalt
Inherit God’s own kingdom;
When every earthly foe shall melt,
And thou shalt overcome them :
Victorious Love shall then in deep pulsation,
Reverberate throughout the whole creation'
