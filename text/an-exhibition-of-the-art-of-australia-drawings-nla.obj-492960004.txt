"110 YEARS OF AUSTRALIAN ART”
In undertaking the organisation of this Loan Exhibition —an exhibition comprised
entirely of work from Sydney Collections —it was obvious that I should be confronted
with difficulties in regard to wall-space.
Only in a Gallery with the dimensions of the Sydney National Art Gallery, would
it be possible to display a collection thoroughly representative of over a hundred years
of Australian Art.
In an exhibition of less than 150 works, both the historical and artistic claims
could not always be met, and where they came in conflict I chose, to the best of my
ability, to put the artistic claims first.
Most of the major figures from 1840 to about 1920 are here represented. Where
gaps occur (as in the case of Victorian portrait work and certain schools of landscape)
they are due to lack of local examples or to the pictures being too large for the purposes
of this exhibition.
From 1920 onwards the selective process becomes more pronounced, because of the
greatly increased number of artists to be considered. Of contemporary work it was only
possible to display a sufficient number to represent the various schools of expression.
I have not hesitated to include two or more works by certain artists, rather than
turn the exhibition into a form of catalogue with one picture only from as many artists
as possible.
In considering the work on view, attention should be drawn to a pencil draw-
ing by Louis Buvelot, which is probably one of the first drawings done in the country
to indicate the beginning of an Australian viewpoint in landscape.
A single de Mestre serves to remind us of the importance of this artist in regard
to post-impressionism in Australia.
With Wakelin he inaugurated a Movement which was to have far reaching effects
and their exhibition in August, 1919, marked the introduction into this country of the
modern approach to painting.
This exhibition took place at Gayfield Shaw’s Gallery in Elizabeth Street, Sydney,
and was opened by the late Sydney Ure Smith (who already displayed the openness
of mind which was to make him such an influence in the years to come).


Dattilo-Rubbo was another artist and teacher who encouraged the young artists.
Indeed he was one of the few artists of the period who even accepted the principles
of French Impressionism —then long past its peak in France.
The fine bust of the late John Young by Daphne Mayo, calls attention to another
important figure to whom the art world owes a debt of gratitude.
In Sydney, the period between the two world wars was one of great activity,
dominated by Julian Ashton (whose influence stretched back to the turn of the century),
the Lindsays, Hilder, Lambert, Margaret Preston, Thea Proctor, Hans Heysen, Will
Ashton, Norman Carter, Sydney Long, Lister Lister and Gruner.
Sydney Ure Smith presided over it all —a Johnsonian figure, strangely reminiscent
of the great doctor and his circle.
In Melbourne, the leading figures were Max Meldrum, Sir John Longstaff, Sir
Arthur Streeton, Mclnnes and Napier Waller, to be followed by George Bell and
Arnold Shore, who introduced the modern movement into Melbourne in 1927. Meldum’s
scientific approach to objective realism made him, for many years, the most influential
master in the Commonwealth.
The Contemporary Group also dates from the early twenties and Thea Proctor,
Grace Cossington-Smith, Wakelin and Lambert were early members. It was considered
revolutionary and Lambert was rebuked by a critic of the day for associating with such
artistic radicals.
Even in an art history as brief as ours, the modifying influence of time is felt and
this is particularly noticeable in the case of the Heidelberg Group, here represented by
the work of Tom Roberts, Streeton, Conder and Walter Withers. These artists worked
at Heidelberg, near Melbourne, and formed the first great school of Australian
painting.
The early genius of Streeton, with his astonishing revelation of the light and
character of his country made him so popular that the sounder attributes of his com-
panions were often overlooked. With the passing of the years Conder has become a classic,
both here and in Europe. Roberts stands revealed as an artist of more sustained and
varied powers than Streeton and Walter Withers takes his place amongst the most
poetical of our landscape painters.
We are indebted to a daughter of the late Walter Withers (Mrs. Alfred
Chambers, of Ryde) for charming examples of his work.
Contemporary reputations will doubtless undergo modifications with the passing
of the years, as it is probably impossible for any one generation to judge itself; but
all valid art, however revolutionary at the moment of its inception, takes it place
naturally in the chain of tradition.
