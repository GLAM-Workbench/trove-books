The History, Uses and Culture
of the Orange,
AND OTHER SPECIES OF THE CITRUS FAMILY,
DAVID A. CRICHTON,
Introductory Remarks.
Among the many valuable fruits that are cultivated in the
Australian colonies, none hold a higher position than the
Citrus family. Fruit of this family is more generally
popular than any other kind, and its use is common in all
civilised parts of the world. Oranges are enjoyed by those
who are suffering from sickness as well as by people in
robust health ; and very frequently they are the only fruit
which can be used by the sufferers from disease. Fruit of
this family will keep on the trees after it is ripe for a longer
period than any other kind, and will bear carriage better.
It is also less liable to injury from storms and changes of
weather than most other fruits ; and, owing to the thickness
of the rind and the aromatic oil it contains, it suffers less
from the attacks of birds and insects. Oranges are more or
less in season all the year round, and no other fruit has the
same advantages in this respect. Trees of the Citrus family
also yield large and certain crops, as a rule, in comparison
with other fruits. Besides their value as fruit producers,
the trees, owing to their beautiful foliage and compact
growth, are also very serviceable as ornamental plants for
the pleasure garden, and they are very effective for shrub-
beries, either planted singly or in groups.
Some few years ago it was supposed by many that the
Orange and Lemon could only be successfully cultivated
in localities near to the sea coast, but experience has proved
that they will thrive to perfection in many of the inland
districts of both New South Wales and Victoria. Many
have recently turned their attention to the culture of Citrus
fruits, in the well-grounded belief that they are likely to
give good returns to the planters. Having had a rather
extensive experience in the cultivation of these fruits, I


can saj 7 that there is a good foundation for this belief, and I
am certain that the Orange and Lemon may be grown most
successfully in many districts north and south of the
Murray, provided the trees receive the attention they require.
In fact, I believe that the culture of Citrus fruits will rank
among the most profitable of our agricultural industries in
the future, as there is a rapidly expanding Home market
for them, and any surplus that may be produced can be sold
to advantage in other parts of the world. The climatic and
soil conditions are as perfect as in any of the older countries
where the Orange and Lemon is largely cultivated, and
Australian grown fruit is in season when the ordinary
sources of supply for Europe and America are exhausted,
I believe our growers have a great future before them in
exporting Oranges and Lemons to Great Britain, the United
States and Canada, at certain periods of the year when the
supplies from Southern Europe, California and Florida, have
ceased, owing to the seasons being over. There is nothing
to prevent Victoria and the neighbouring colonies from
becoming large exporting countries, if the Orange
growing industry is carried on with judgment and
energy. From my experience I have arrived at certain
conclusions as to what is required to allow the Citrus
family to be cultivated successfully, and these I shall
deal with at length in my remarks further on.
History of the Citrus Family. ?The various useful
species of the Citrus family are supposed to have originated
in China and Central Asia, and to have been taken to Syria
by the Arabs. No species seems to have been known to the
ancient Hebrews, Egyptians, Greeks or Romans, as they are
not mentioned by the writers of these nations. There is
some uncertainty as to when they were first known in
Europe, but the Citron is said to have been introduced to
Italy in the second century. The Sweet Orange appears
not to have been known till the fourteenth century, according
to historical records, being introduced by returning crusaders
from Palestine. The Lime and Lemon were not known till
a century later,and the Shaddock not till a much later period.
The first mention of the Citrus fruits among ancient nations
is by the Arabs who not only used Oranges and Lemons in
the ordinary way, but extracted oil from both fruits and
seeds as also citric acid. According to Galessio the
Arabs discovered the Orange tribe in a part of India
farther in the interior than Alexander had penetrated. The
culture of the Citrus family in Europe has been principally


confined to Italy, Spain, Portugal, the Azore Islands and
some parts of the south of France, those being the only
countries possessing a suitable climate. More attention has
been paid to their culture in Italy than in any other country,
and a very large number of varieties are grown, with but a
comparatively few of which we are acquainted. Risso, an
eminent Italian botanist residing at Nice, published at Paris
in 1818 a history of the family, in which he enumerated and
described 169 varieties, which he divided into 8 classes, as
follows 43 Sweet Oranges, 31 Bitter Oranges, 5 Bergamots,
8 Limes, 6 Pampelucos, 12 Sweet Limes, 47 Lemons and 17
Citrons. On the other hand, Linnseus only admitted that
the Citron and Lemon were distinct species, while some
botanists have decided the Shaddock to be the only one that
was a separate species, and that all the others had originated
from the Citron. For all practical purposes, however, the
useful kinds may be divided into nine species, which I shall
deal with in detail further on.
Hardiness and Longevity. ?When the climate and soil
are not absolutely uncongenial there ought to be no great
difficulty in cultivating the Orange successfully, provided
that its wants are duly attended to. Trees of this family
are not as delicate as is generally supposed, and they may
be profitably cultivated under various conditions of soil and
climate. They will stand a considerable amount of heat,
and some degrees of frost, with impunity, provided that
their particular requirements receive due attention. When
carefully cultivated and growing in a congenial soil and
situation the trees will often attain a great size and age.
There are in Spain and Italy trees whose ages are said to
range from 150 to 200 years, and they are still healthy and
vigorous. In the convent of St. Sabina, at Rome, there was
an orange tree 32 feet high, said to be over 600 years old ;
and at Nice there was a tree over 50 feet high, with a trunk
that took two men to embrace it, and yielding from 6000 to
7000 fruit every year. One of the largest and finest orange
trees in France grew at Versailles, and was known in the
neighbourhood as the Grand Bourbon. It was raised from seed
which is said to have been sown in 1421. We have also
records of trees grown at Beddington, Surrey, England,
which were grown under shelter and attained an age of
more than one hundred years. At Hampton Court Oranges
were also successfully grown under the same conditions
some of which are stated to have attained an age of
over two hundred years. I mention these instances


to show that the Orange is one of the longest-
lived fruit trees, if it meets with congenial treatment. But
though the trees of this family are vigorous and long-lived
when growing under the most favourable conditions, yet they
are not likely to give much satisfaction to growers unless
they are well and rationally treated. The wants of this
family are peculiar, and differ to some extent from those of
other fruit trees. I believe that the chief cause of non-success
in Orange culture is not so much due to the effects of soil
and climate as carelessness or ignorance in the treatment of
the trees. Too many people who plant Orange and other
fruit trees seem to think that after an orchard is fairly
started, and the trees have made a few years? growth, no
farther assistance or care is required, except to keep down
the weeds. This class of cultivators expect to take from
the trees heavy crops year after year with little attention
and are surprised when they begin to fail in vigour. When
not carefully attended to and supplied with proper nourish-
ment trees must necessarily begin to fail when comparatively
young, and when this occurs the cultivator generally blames
either the climate, soil, season or insects, instead of ascribing
the failure to the true causes ?neglect and starvation.
Requirements of the Citrus Family. ?From a careful
consideration of the subject, based upon many years?
experience and observation, I believe the essential conditions
for the successful culture of the Orange family to be as
follows: ?
1. A Suitable Climate and Soil.
2. The Perfect Preparation of the Soil.
3. Shelter from Strong Winds.
4. The Selection of Healthy Young Trees.
o. A Full and Begular Supply of Congenial Food for
the Trees.
6. A Supply of Water During Periods of Drought.
7. To Disturb the Roots as Little as Possible.
8. To Keep the Ground free from Weeds and other
Undergrowth.
Cultivators must bear in mind that each one of these
conditions is essential to the most perfect success in the
cultivation of the Citrus family, and it is not sufficient if
some are provided for and others neglected.


Soil and Climate.? The Citrus family will do very
well in any ordinary good soil of fair depth, and on any,site
which is not too wet or exposed. Low-lying land, where
the temperature is often very low in the winter and spring,
where fogs are heavy and frequent, and the sides of bleak
hills should be equally avoided by Orange cultivators as a
rule. The most favourable soil is a strong sandy loam, with
a gravelly or open subsoil. Limestone soils are also specially
well adapted for the growth of the Orange family. I believe
that the cultivation of Citrus fruits will prove a very
profitable industry, more especially in the warmer regions
of Victoria, which extend to the Murray and the South
Australian border. Also in the large territory on the
northern side of the Murray, The conditions of soil and
climate in these wide regions are as perfect as can be desired
by the cultivator, and the only other requirement is a supply
of water to contend with dry seasons. Considerable areas
in some of these districts have already been planted with
Citrus fruits with the most satisfactory prospects. The
lead has been taken by the irrigation settlement of Mildura,
for which Victoria and other parts of Australia is indebted
to the foresight, energy and pluck of the Messrs. Chaffey
Bros. The Mildura settlement has been selected with judg-
ment, and can scarcely fail to become a very flourishing
fruit-growing district in the course of a few years. The
soil is of good quality, rich in limestone, and particularly
well adapted for the growth of the Citrus family, as also
the Grape, Fig, Peach and Apricot. All these fruits can be
grown to absolute perfection at Mildura, as by the perfect
system of irrigation that has been adopted their growth
will never be checked through lack of moisture in dry seasons.
Large areas of orange trees have already been planted at
Mildura, and from what I have learned an immense number
will be put in next season. No doubt other districts
will follow in the wake of Mildura, which offers so
bright an example to localities which suffer from an un-
certain rainfall.
Though the Orange family are specially suitable for warm
districts, yet they may also be cultivated successfully in
other localities, provided the winters are not too severe.
The trees will stand three or four degrees of frost with<
impunity, but not more. When planted in the cooler dis-
tricts the most favourable site for an orangery is a gentle
slope, with an aspect between north and east, so that the
trees may get the full benefit of the early morning sun.
Planters, however, are not always in a position to make the


most perfect choice of soil and situation, and must make the
best of existing conditions. In the warmer districts the
aspect of an orangery is not of so much importance.
Preparation of the Soil. ?ln preparing for Orange trees
it is advisable to break up the ground to the depth of from
18in. to 24in, when circumstances will permit. The soil
should also be thoroughly broken and well mixed, as a fine
tilth is grateful to the roots of the Orange family. Trenching
with the spade is by far the most effective way of preparing
the ground; but the work can be done more quickly and
economically by the use of the plough and subsoiler. A
good depth of well-worked soil gives the trees a wide field
to obtain nourishment from, and places them in the best
position to withstand the effects of dry weather. It is not
advisable, however, in preparing the ground, to turn up much
of a bad subsoil; and when this exists cultivators should
simply stir and break it to the depth of a few inches, leaving
it in the same position as before. Perfect drainage is
essential in the cultivation of the Orange family, as the trees
cannot thrive when water is stagnating at their roots. Due
provision for effective drainage should always be made when
the ground is prepared. In light soils, on sloping ground, or
when the subsoil is open, there will often be sufficient
drainage naturally. When, however, the soil is heavy and
retentive, or on flat ground, with a close subsoil, the
cultivator should always provide for effective drainage.
Underground drains are preferable to open ones, and the
distance apart must of course depend upon the
conformation of the ground. If the ground has only
a slight fall, parallel drains between every other row
of trees will be necessary to allow every tree to get an
equal and thorough drainage. On steeper slopes a less
distance will suffice, according to the nature of the soil, and
the more heavy and tenacious it is the closer must the drains
be. In preparing the ground, any deficiencies should, if
possible, be rectified, and I need not tell practical men that
there is a great difference in the character of various soils,
some being deficient in certain properties which others have
in excess. If soils are lacking in lime, potash, or other material
that is essential to the growth of the trees, the deficiencies
must be made good to make cultivation successful.
Shelter. ?Shelter from bleak winds is necessary to the
successful cultivation of the Orange* family; and no trees
suffer more by exposure, both as regards their health and


the quality of the fruit. In exposed situations the trees
have a tendency to produce thick-skinned fruit deficient in
juiciness and flavour; and the produce of the choicest varieties
is sometimes so altered in character as not to be recognised
easily. The value of effective shelter is fully appreciated
by European cultivators, and invariably provided for. At
St. Michael, one of the Azore Islands, where Orange-growing
is the staple industry, the cultivators commonly shelter
their trees from the bleak winds which sweep over the
Atlantic by means of stone walls of from 12ft. to 20ft. high.
When there is no shelter naturally cultivators should always
make provision for it by planting belts or lines of quick-
growing trees to serve as breakwinds. If the area is of large
extent it will be necessary to have cross breakwinds in
addition to those on the boundaries. There are many quick-
growing, dense-foliaged trees which will answer the purpose.
Care must, however, be taken that the roots of these break-
winds do not interfere with those of the Orange trees. As
an effective breakwind, and more especially as a secondary
one, I must say a word in favour of the Olive, which answers
admirably, though it does not make such rapid growth as
some other trees. On the other hand, however, its roots
are less troublesome when it gets large, and the tree itself
yields a return in fruit.
Selecting Young Trees. ?ln planting trees of this
family due care should be taken that none but healthy and
vigorous plants are selected. This is a matter of essential
importance, as, if the trees are unhealthy or weakly in
constitution, they are not likely to give the grower the
same satisfaction as more vigorous plants will do. In
selecting trees planters should give the preference to those
having a healthy dark green foliage, and avoid those which
have a sickly yellowish appearance. It is also a matter of
some importance that the young trees have been raised from
vigorous parents. ? Like has a tendency to produce like ?
is one of nature's laws in the vegetable as well as the
animal kingdom; and, if young trees have been raised from
debilitated parents, they are liable to inherit weak consti-
tutions. It stands to reason, therefore, that the stocks
should be vigorous and suitable, and that the scions
whether for grafting or budding, ought to be taken from,
robust healthy trees.
Propagation. ?There is some difference of opinion among
practical men as to which is the best way of propagating


trees of the Citrus family, and what are the most suitable
stocks. Grafting is the method most generally adopted in
Australia, and the great majority of the trees sold by
nurserymen are raised by this means. Budding, though not
generally practised, finds favour with many experienced
cultivators, who argue that trees raised by this method are
the best. In the case of grafted trees it is not an uncommon
thing for them to go off through the bark decaying at the
place where the scion is united to the stock. This is
what is commonly called the ? collar disease.? But with
budded plants this danger is avoided. As regards the best
kind of stock, most growers in New South Wales give the
preference to the common Lemon, for the sufficient reasons
that it is both vigorous, more hardy, and can be shifted with
less risk than any other kind. Seedling Oranges may
produce stocks which will make strong and durable trees ;
but, as they are not as hardy as the common Lemon, and
suffer to a greater extent when shifted the latter would
appear to be preferable. Some years ago the claims
of the Seville or Bitter Orange as a stock were strongly
advocated by some experienced cultivators in New South
Wales; but, though it has had a fair trial, it does not
according to my judgment, seem to possess any
particular advantage over the common Lemon. It is
generally admitted, however, that the nearer the
relation between the stock and scion the more durable and
vigorous are the trees likely to be, and consequently Orange
stocks will probably come more into favour with growers in
the future. Seedlings have been recommended by some
writers in preference to grafted or budded plants. But,
though they will certainly yield robust and long-lived trees,
yet, on the other hand, they have to stand a long time before
they bear freely; and the quality of the fruit is uncertain.
Planting. ?lf circumstances will permit, the most favour-
able period of the year for planting trees of the Orange
family is from the middle of March to the end of April,
according to the nature of the season and locality, though it
maj r be done successfully at other times. When the trees
are planted early in the autumn, as the ground contains a
considerable amount of warmth, root action begins quickly,
the plants soon recover from the check caused by removal,
and they get fairly established before the winter sets in.
If trees are planted later on during the winter months,
growth is necessarily less active, and the plants are very
liable to suffer from the effects of frosts and bleak winds.


When it is not convenient to plant in the autumn it is
better to wait till September rather than put the trees in
during the winter months. As a rule, however, trees should
not he shifted after their spring growth has fairly started ,
or before the summer growth has matured . It must be
clearly understood however, that though I advocate autumn
planting when practicable, for the reasons named, it is
essential that the trees are in a fitting condition for shifting.
As a matter of fact, very frequently the summer growth does
not mature early enough for the trees to be shifted in the
autumn. Under such circumstances, cultivators must
necessarily wait till a later period. In shifting trees
of the Orange family the greatest care should be taken
not to injure or lessen the number of roots more than can
be avoided, as the plants require all their feeders in making
a new start. Care must also be taken not to expose the
roots to a dry atmosphere, and they should be effectively
protected from the time they are lifted till they are planted.
As soon as each plant is taken up, cover the roots, so as
to prevent them from being injured by either sun or wind,
as the} 7 are very delicate and very susceptible to injury
from these causes, and if allowed to get dry the plants will
be almost sure to lose their foliage, and very likely die
altogether. Uncover the roots of each plant singly as soon
as the hole is made ready for its reception, then put it in
its place and cover up the roots as expeditiously as
possible. Be careful, in planting, to spread out the roots
in every direction, and see that none of them are
tangled or doubled up. When any of them are bruised
or injured they must be removed with a clean cut,
or they will rot and, perhaps, canker the others.
Care must also be taken mot to plant the trees too deep. If
possible a moist or dull day should be chosen for planting
trees of this family, as less care is then required.
After planting, give the trees a good watering over the tops
and afterwards occasionally, according to the state of the
weather. Some difference of opinion exists among practical
men as to the advisability of cutting back the heads of
newly-planted trees. According to my experience, the
cutting back of the branches must be determined by the
quantity and condition of the roots. If the plants have
suffered severely in loss ot roots by removal, the heads
should be reduced in proportion. On the other hand, if the
roots are nearly perfect, the trees will require but little in
the way of heading back. Young trees will have a much
better chance if sheltered from the effects of cold drying


winds for a few months till they get thoroughly established.
Though giving shelter requires some extra labour, yet
cultivators will be more than repaid by the lessened risk
with their trees. In planting trees of the Citrus family
many people commit the great mistake of placing them too
close to each other. Most kinds of Oranges will require for
free development a space of 24ft from tree to tree. The
Mandarin section, however, being less robust in habit than
the other kinds, may be planted from loft to 18ft apart,
according to the growth of the variety. Lisbon Lemons,
Limes, and Citrons may be planted about 18ft apart, as
they are less robust in habit than most of the varieties of
Granges, While the trees are young the spaces between
may be utilised for growing Peaches and other fruits, or
vegetables. But care must be taken that they do not
interfere with the growth of the Citrus family.
Supplying the Trees with Nutriment. ?Trees of the
Orange family cannot thrive unless they have a regular
supply of congenial food. Their requirements are greater
than those of other fruit trees; there being always a steady
drain upon their energies. No sooner has one crop matured
than another requires support. This severe drain upon the
trees must be compensated by an ample supply of congenial
food; otherwise the plants will become weakened, and
liable to the attacks of disease and insects. Trees must
necessarily pine away and die if they do not obtain
sufficient nourishment to support healthy growth. Culti-
vators too frequently commit the mistake of expecting their
trees to remain healthy, and bear heavy crops year after
year without anything being returned to the soil in the
shape of manure. It is chiefly owing to this unreasonable
mode of treatment that so many trees fail while com-
paratively young, whereas they ought to live and flourish
for lengthened periods. But, on the other hand, cultivators
must bear in mind that though Orange trees require plenty
of nourishment to keep them in a healthy, vigorous
condition, yet manure should not be given in excess, as
under such circumstances a rank and unhealthy growth is
stimulated for a short period that is followed by a reaction
which is injurious. Whatever manure is used ought not to
be of a forcing character, or violent in its action, but should
yield a gradual, regular and lasting supply of nourishment
to the trees. As regards the most effective and economical
way of supplying food to the trees of the Citrus family I
have arrived at the conclusion, from my experience, that


surface feeding is the best plan for mature trees. The best
general fertiliser is stable manure. This should be applied
as a mulching over the surface as far as the roots extend.
Lay it on in a thick layer, and, as the manure decays, add
fresh material from time to time. The main dressing should
be applied in September or October, and, as a matter of
course, the layer ought to be thicker during the summer
than in the winter. When this system is adopted, the trees
not only get the benefit of a continuous supply of nourish-
ment, but also the advantage of having their roots
effectively protected by mulching. If the soil is deficient
in lime, potash, or other essential materials its wants must,
as a matter of course, be supplied by special manures. Very
frequently, and more especially in old orchards, the supplies
of lime or potash will have become exhausted , and cultivators
should not fail to find out these deficiencies before the
trees suffer to any material extent. An occasional dressing
of bonedust or lime under the layer of mulch will generally
prove serviceable to the trees. In the case of young trees
the ground, as a matter of course, should be well manured
at the start, if requisite, and free supplies given afterwards.
Pruning and Training. ?Like all other fruit trees, those
of the Citrus family require some attention in pruning.
But the operation should be performed in a rational manner
with a due regard to the natural habits of the trees, their
age and condition. The operation of pruning is too often
performed without much discrimination, and the trees cut
in such a manner as is productive of more harm than good.
In pruning trees of the Orange family, cultivators should be
careful in using the knife or saw; and no more cutting
ought to be done than circumstances render necessary. In
the case of trees which have arrived at the full-bearing age
but comparatively little is required in the way of pruning,
except for any special purpose. The removal of rank shoots,
dead or diseased wood, and the thinning out of the branches
when over-crowded, so as to allow light and air to penetrate
freely, is all that is generally required in the shape of
pruning. In the case of young trees a different way of
treatment is necessary, as the object of the cultivator is the
development of a strong growth of wood in particular
directions; and to bring about the desired result the knife
must be used more freely. Young trees, in the first place,
should have sufficient lateral shoots left to balance the plants
in each direction, and form the heads. As a rule, shoots which
are not required for the development of the trees should be


cut away close to the main stems. It is better, however, to
leave a few more shoots than those which will be ultimately
required to form the trees, in order to afford the stems the
necessary protection from the sun, removing them as the
trees increase in size. In training trees of the Citrus family,
it is desirable that the branches hang to within about 2 ft.
of the ground, so as to protect the trunks from the heat of
the sun in summer. It is not an uncommon thing for trees
to be trained high so that horse power cultivating
implements can be used close to the stem. But the practice
is bad. lam of opinion that the cracking or discolouration
of the bark in Orange and other fruit trees, which is so
common in this part of the world, is caused by the sap
fermenting through the action of the sun. By training the
heads low there will be no trouble caused by the exposure
of the trunks. Besides, trees with low heads are less liable
to suffer from the effects of high winds. It is not advisable
to let young Orange trees bear too freely, as the production of
fruit lessens the growth of wood. The growth of wood in
young trees is the principal consideration. Trees should be
five years old before they are allowed to bear heavy crops, as
by that time they will have attained a fair amount of growth.
Protecting the Roots. ?ln the cultivation of trees of this
family and other evergreen fruits it is advisable to place
them under such conditions that their roots will not be
subject to the extremes of drought and excessive moisture
in the soil, or to sudden changes of temperature- Unless
means are taken to prevent it, the sudden changes which
often occur from severe drought to excessive rain, and vice
versa, will cause great variations in the temperature of the
soil; and these should be avoided by the cultivator as much
as possible. This may be done to a great extent in the first
place by trenching and draining the ground thoroughly, so
as to secure the most perfect root-bed, and secondly by
mulching the surface soil so as to shelter it from the full
power of the sun and drying wind. In deeply worked, well
drained land, the temperature is higher in winter and lower
in summer than in shallow, or undrained soil, and it is not
so readily affected by atmospheric changes. Consequently
trees growing in deep, well-worked, and properly drained
land, are placed under the most favourable conditions for
making steady growth, are not as liable to injury from
frost, and in no danger of becoming injured through their
roots getting soddened. Then as regards the protection of
the trees by mulching, the cultivator must bear in mind


that when the trees are growing under the most
favourable conditions, the masses of delicate rootlets, or
feeders, which lie near the surface, are not as easily injured
by the power of the sun as when the ground is fully
exposed; and the supply of moisture lasts much longer.
Disturbing the Roots.? ln the cultivation of trees of
the Orange family I believe it to be a matter of essential
importance that the roots should not be disturbed to any
great extent. The common practice of digging or ploughing
among the roots cannot be too strongly condemned. These
operations cannot be performed without destroying a great
number of the small fibrous roots, or feeders, a large
proportion of which lie near the surface. These roots are
all required to supply the trees with nourishment; and if a
quantity is destroyed, as must be the case when the surface
soil is broken up by either the plough or spade, the loss will
be felt, more or less. The best plan is as far as is practicable
never to disturb the surface soil at all, leaving each layer
of mulching to lie till it decays ; and the only cultivating
implement which should ever be used in an Orangery is
a hand or light horse hoe, to keep down the weeds.
Keeping the Land Clean. ?lt is a matter of material
importance in cultivating trees of this family that the
ground should be kept perfectly free from weeds, grass, or
any other kind of undergrowth. When weeds are allowed
to make headway they absorb a considerable amount of
plant food and moisture, which otherwise would be available
for the support of the trees. The loss of these materials must
necessarily be felt by the trees, and more especially the ex-
haustion of surface moisture during the dry summer months.
Insects and Diseases. ?The Citrus family, like other
fruit trees, has its peculiar diseases, and is liable to the
attacks of certain insect and vegetable parasites. These
troubles, however, I believe, are in a large measure due to
defective cultivation in some respects. If the necessary
conditions for the successful culture of the trees are duly
provided for, the liability to disease or the attacks of insect
or fungoid parasites will be reduced to a minimum. Healthy,
vigorous trees are rarely attacked, but when through some
cause they become unhealthy, the various animal and
vegetable pests to which they are liable make them their
prey. When insects do appear upon trees, cultivators, as a
matter of course, should endeavour to get rid of them as soon


as possible. But, in addition to the adoption of the ordinary
remedies, something ought to be done to improve the
health of the trees. The predisposing causes which
attract disease, insect, or fungoid pests must be removed
before the trees can be thoroughly cured. Though various
agents, in the shape of insecticides, may prove very service-
able in helping to clean the trees, yet the only safe way of
dealing with them is to improve their health at the same
time. Prepare and drain the ground properly, plant
healthy trees and feed them well and continuously, provide
the necessary shelter, and mulch thoroughly before the dry
weather sets in; and disease, insect or fungoid pests will
seldom cause trouble in an Orangery. The most common,
and, at the same time, the most troublesome, pests to the
Orange family are the scale insects. Whenever they make
their appearance no time should be lost in trying to get rid
of them. Various remedies are employed by growers,
including lime, sulphur, soft soap, whale oil soap, kerosene
emulsion, tobacco water and various patent insecticides.
Nicotine soap will destroy any kind of fly and materially
assist in keeping down scale insects. Quassia water is safe
and good, an ounce of chips being soaked in a gallon of
water. Soft soap and tobacco water form a safe, and, in
most cases, a satisfactory remedy, easily prepared. Dissolve
two ounces of the soap in a gallon of soft water, add half a
pint of tobacco water, and with the mixture syringe the trees.
Transcending in importance, however, any of these older
insecticides are the three now most commonly used, because
most satisfactory. They are (1) Arsenical Compounds,
(2) Petroleum, and (3) Pyrethrum. The first acts through
the stomach, and is effectual chiefly against mandibular
insects; the second and third act by contact, and are,
therefore, of more general application.
A mixture of two parts lime and one of sulphur, with
sufficient water to bring it to the consistency of paint, makes
a good dressing for the trunks and main branches of trees
affected with insects or fungi.
Watering in Dry Weather. ?No fruit trees require so
much attention in watering as those belonging to the Citrus
family. In fact, crops cannot be depended upon unless the
trees can be supplied with water during periods of drought.
The trees are always in an active state of growth, and the
roots absorb a great deal of moisture from the soil. This
moisture must be replaced from some source, or otherwise
root action is interfered with more or less, and the trees


suffer. The easiest and most effective way of supplying
water is by a system of irrigation. This mode should be
adopted when practicable, as it will prove a great aid in the
culture of the Citrus family. We have a good example as
to how large areas may be successfully irrigated in the
settlement of Mildura, where, owing to the skill and enter-
prise of Messrs. Chaffey Bros., many thriving plantations of
young fruit trees now exist upon land that but a few months
ago produced a scanty herbage and a few gum trees. As
regards the watering required by trees of the Citrus family
no precise rules can be laid down, as much will necessarily
depend upon the character of the season. As a general rule
the trees should never be allowed to flag through lack of
moisture at their roots. On the other hand, however, water
should not be used more freely than is necessary, as when
supplied in excess the fruit is liable to become coarse, want-
ing in flavour and too tender for packing and keeping.
Gathering and Packing. ?ln gathering Oranges and
Lemons, care should be taken not to injure the fruit in
handling, as the slightest bruise or scratch will cause early
decay. The fruit hangs very tight to the stems, and when
required for keeping or shipping ought to be cut and not
pulled. Fruit that has to find a local market may be
allowed to get fully ripe upon the trees, but if required for
shipment it should be gathered just as it begins to turn
colour. Fruit should never be picked for packing while
wet with rain or dew, and any that are imperfect ought to
be rejected. It will be advisable to delay packing for two or
three days after the fruit is gathered, to get rid of some of
the moisture in the rind, as when slightly dried the oranges
pack closer and better, and are more likely to arrive at their
destination in prime condition. The boxes should be uniform
in size, and so constructed as to permit free ventilation.
Each box should contain fruit that is perfectly even in
quality, and the number ought to be marked upon the case.
The safest way of packing for shipping long distances is to
wrap each fruit singly in tissue paper. The boxes should
be filled sufficiently to require a gentle pressure in nailing
on the tops, taking care, however, not to bruise the fruit.
Fruit in transit requires an even temperature, and if
subjected to extremes of heat and cold is liable to spoil,
notwithstanding all care in gathering and packing. I have
been induced to make the foregoing remarks because I
believe that in a few years? time the shipment of Oranges
and Lemons to the United Kingdom and North America


will be something considerable. As a matter of course
when the fruit is required for our own markets less attention
is required, but still care in gathering, sorting and packing
will generally pay growers.
Species and Yaeieties, ?There are a large number of
species belonging to the Citrus family, but only a few are
valuable commercially. These include the Sweet Orange, Bitter
Orange, Mandarin Orange, Kumquat Orange, Lemon, Sweet
Lemon, Lime, Citron and Shaddock. Each of these species
embrace varieties more or less numerous, and differing to
some extent in size, form and qualities. The following
remarks will supply such particulars as are likely to prove
practically useful respecting each species of the Citrus family
and their most useful varieties.
The Sweet or Common Orange, ?This species, which is
known botanically as Citms aurantium, embraces a large
number of cultivated varieties, all of which possess the same
essential qualities. The fruit is wholesome and useful
medicinally, and the rind is a mild tonic. A useful essential
oil is extracted from the rind, and the flowers yield a valuable
and popular perfume, but to a far less extent than the Bitter
Orange. For perfumery purposes this species is less valuable
than the Bitter Orange. The varieties in cultivation in the
various Orange-growing countries are numerous, but I shall
confine ray remarks chiefly to those that have been cultivated
successfully in Australia. These are as follows:
The Parramatta Orange. ?This is an excellent and very
useful variety, which is grown extensively in the Orangeries
of New South Wales. It is one of the hardiest sorts, and
yields regular and heavy crops of medium-sized, well-
flavoured quality. I can strongly recommend this variety
for general cultivation. Sometimes this sort is sent out by
New South Wales nurserymen as the Pennant Hills or
Kissing Point Orange, and under other local names.
The S'detta or Cluster Orange. ?As its name signifies, this
variety bears its fruit in bunches, and is a useful and
profitable variety. It is one of the hardiest, is very prolific,
bears regularly, and the fruit is of good size and excellent
in flavour. This is a sort that I would recommend to be
included in every collection.
The Maltese or Blood Orange. ?This variety derives its
second name from its dark-coloured fruit, which is blotched
with red stains. It is hardy and prolific, and the fruit


is of good quality, but it has never become popular in
this part of the world, and cannot be recommended for
commercial purposes in comparison with the Parramatta
and Siletta.
The Navel or Bahia Orange. ?This variety produces
large, showy, high-flavoured fruit without seeds, and has at
the end a navel-like scar where the flower has been. This
variety is a somewhat shy bearer, unless when grown
under very favourable conditions, and requires a sheltered
situation, as it is less hardy than many of the other sorts.
This kind, owing to its fine appearance and rich flavour, has
been termed the King of Oranges. A new sort has been
recently introduced by the Messrs. Chaffey Bros, from
America, under the name of the Washington Navel, and
said to be a variety quite distinct from the kind known
in Australia. I can say nothing of my own knowledge
respecting this sort, but I have been informed by those
that have grown it in California that it is distinct and
superior to the ordinary Navel Orange.
The St. Michael's Orange. ?This is a variety that has a
high reputation for the quality of its fruit, which is very
thin-skinned and sweet when grown under favourable
conditions. Like the Navel, however, it is less hardy than
some other kinds, and requires a sheltered situation. When
grown under favourable conditions this variety is very
prolific, but if circumstances are uncongenial it is a shy
bearer, and the fruit is apt to lose its high character.
The Seville or Bitter Orange. ?The Seville or Bitter
Orange is now classed as a distinct species, and is known
botanically as Citrus vulgaris. It is not much cultivated
in this part of the world, as the fruit is too bitter to be
palatable. But in other countries it is turned to good
account. This kind in Europe is extensively used for
making marmalade and the familiar candied peel. The
flowers have a much stronger perfume than those of the
Sweet Orange, and consequently are more generally used in
the preparation of oils and essences. In the South of France
and Italy the Bitter Orange is cultivated extensively for
perfumery purposes, as 21bs. of the flowers are said to yield
an equivalent to 31bs. of the other kinds. One ton of
flowers is calculated to produce 40oz. of otto, which on
an average is worth �2O, and the water remaining is
worth another �lO. An essential oil, called oil of Neroli,


is also extracted from them by distillation, and is yielded,
according to Balfour, at the rate of loz. to 5501b, of flowers.
Oil of Neroli is extensively used in perfumery, and forms a
portion of the well-known Eau de Cologne. It is also used
to some extent for flavoring liquers. The rind of the orange
yields an aromatic essential oil which is contained in small
cells, and may be extracted by pressure or distillation.
An excellent wine can be made from the juice of oranges,
but the sweet varieties are better for this purpose than
the Seville species. Among other uses to which the fruit
is put is the flavouring of the liqueur Curaeoa by the
use of the immature fruit of the Seville orange. The
unripe fruit is also preserved in syrup and crystallized,
and used as a sweetmeat. In speaking of these products,
I may also observe that the different varieties of the
Sweet Orange and the other species of Citrus contain the
same properties, but in a lesser degree, and will yield
the same extracts, but in smaller quantities. There is no
reason why the manufacture of Orange marmalade should
not provea profitable industry in this colony ; and growers
would do well to turn their attention in this direction. It is
quite possible, also, that the Bitter Orange might be
profitably cultivated for perfumery purposes, and it would
certainly be worth trying. The ordinary Seville Orange,
which includes several sub-varieties, is one of the best in its
class, as it is hardy, robust and bears freely. What is
known as the Poor Man?s Orange belongs to this class, and
is useful for making marmalade. The tree is vigorous and
hardy, and bears freely; the fruit being large, coarse and
produced in clusters.
The Mandarin or China Orange.? This class of Orange
belongs to another distinct species, known botanically as
Citrus nohilis. There are numerous varieties, all bearing
comparatively small, thin-skinned fruit, quite distinct in
appearance and flavour to the other kinds. The trees are
also smaller in growth and more hardy than the other
kinds, and may be grown successfully through a wider
range of climate. This class, independent of their value
as fruit-bearing trees, are well adapted for shrubberies
and gardens, where they are very effective. Most of the
kinds bear very freely, but the fruit of some is much
superior in quality to that of others. The varieties
known as the Canton and Emperor, each of which
includes sub-varieties, are about the best, as they bear
freely, and produce large, well-flavoured fruit.


The Kumquat Orange. ?The Kumquat is another species,
known botanically as Citrus japonica, and it embraces
several varieties. All the kinds are small trees, or more
properly shrubs, and are valuable chiefly as ornamental
plants for the pleasure ground. The fruit is small, bitter
and only serviceable when candied or preserved as
marmalade.
The Lemon. ?The Lemon, botanically known as Citrus
Umonium, is a popular and largely-cultivated species. It has
smaller fruit than the Citron ; and the juice, which yields a
large proportion cf citric acid, is in great demand for cooling
and effervescing drinks. The peel is aromatic and tonic, and
yields an essential oil called ? oil of lemon.? Several varieties
are in cultivation. But the one known as the Lisbon is
decidedly the most popular in Australia, as it is prolific, and
produces large and well-flavoured fruit. There are several
sub-varieties of the Lisbon, such as the ? thornless? and the
? variegated,? differing from the parent to the extent their
names imply. The kind known as the common Lemon is
more hardy than the Lisbon variety. But the fruit is very
inferior; and it is chiefly grown for stocks upon which
other species of the Orange family are grafted or budded.
I have received a very favourable description, from reliable
informants, of a variety named the Eureka, which has of
late years become very popular in California, and is likely
to prove an acquisition in this part of the world. This
variety is said to be thin-skinned, juicy, of medium size,
and the fruit very regular in appearance.
The Sweet Lemon.? What is known as the Sweet Lemon
is Citrus lumia, a species but little cultivated. It has a
thick rind and pale pulp, not acid, and may be used for
marmalade or candied; but it is inferior to other kinds for
these purposes and hardly worth growing.
The Lime. ?The Lime, Citrus limetta, is a smaller growing
tree than either the Lemon or Orange, and the fruit is very
much smaller. The fruit has a sub-acid, slightly bitter
flavour, with similar properties to the Lemon ; and its uses
are the same. There are two or three varieties in culti-
vation which do not differ materially (all being more tender
than the Orange or Lemon), and they are not likely to thrive
except in mild and sheltered localities. The Bergamot is
now generally regarded as a variety of the Lime, though
formerly it was classed as a distinct species. It is somewhat
more robust in habit and bears larger fruit, which is more


pyriform in shape than the common Limes. A volatile oil,
called ? oil of bergamot,? is extracted from the rind, and,
according to Professor Balfour, is obtained at the rate of
2|ozs. to 100 fruit.
The Citron. ?The Citron, which is the type of the family,
is Citrus medica. It is less robust in habit than either the
Sweet or Seville Orange, and has lighter green foliage. The
fruit is oblong, with a very rough and thick rind, and in
flavour is less acid than the Lemon. This species is not
much cultivated, though the fruit makes a good marmalade,
and the peel when candied is excellent. The flowers have
also a very powerful odour, and may be used profitably for
perfumery purposes. Several varieties are to be found in
nursery catalogues, but there is no material differences
between them.
The Shaddock. ?The Shaddock, Sweet Ball, or Pomelow
as it is sometimes called, is Citrus decumana, a species with
very large coarse fruit, which is sometimes 20 lbs. in weight.
It is not much cultivated in this part of the world, but
greatly prized in India, China and the West Indies, where it
is generally used. It was introduced into the West Indies
from China, its native country, by a Captain Shaddock, from
which circumstance it derives its common name. There are
several varieties, some having fruit with reddish and others
white pulp, which may be used for preserving. The trees are
robust, bear freely and make good stocks for other kinds of
the Citrus family.
In the foregoing list of fruits of the Citrus family I have
given a practical, though concise, description of the useful
species, and a number of the better known varieties, as also
their peculiarities and uses. The list of Oranges might have
been extended but a larger one would serve no practical
purpose. I must further remark that Citrus fruits are apt
to vary considerable in quality according to climate and local
conditions. In cold climates, or when growing in exposed
situations, the fruit is apt to have a thicker and coarser
rind, and possess less juice and sweetness than when grown
in a warm and sheltered locality. Young trees almost
invariably produce fruit with thicker rinds and inferior in
quality to that obtained from older trees. Therefore,
cultivators must not fancy that their trees are not belonging
to the supposed kinds. Very frequently the fruit from young
trees has none of the character of the variety it belongs to.
The same remarks will apply, more or less, to the various
other species of the Citrus family.
