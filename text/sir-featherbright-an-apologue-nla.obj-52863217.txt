SIR FEATHERBRIGHT.
(An Apologue).
E. H. HORNE.
Sir Featherbright was a clever Dwarf,—
A Dwarf of sense and talent was be,
And he found that Success was a landing-wharf
Where ships would’nt see you a long way off,
Unless you could mount to a high degree.
Sir Featherbright he got on a wall—
A good high wall on a sun-shiny day;
And after he’d learnt how to creep and crawl,
He walk’d up and down, and smiled upon all
Who were wealthy and fair, as they pass’d that way.
This popular Dwarf has some pills to sell,
Of chaff, and sweet gum—so the bright gilding sticks
The quantity sold every day I can’t tell ;
And ships from all countries soon knew him well,
He made such a figure upon his high bricks !
The buffo-burlesque-ridden crowds of this Fair,
With the town-fashion showing its whiskers and hips.
All came to buy pills, and applaud the fine air
With which the Dwarf sold them—to smile, sigh, and stare
At the eloquent broad-farce that flow’d from his lips.
A Giant came by with a sack of corn—
A large naked man with a noble face ;
He had plough’d, —sow’d, —reap’d,—and a long way borne
The great heavy load; yet fresh as the dawn
He strode to the mart with a lofty grace.
But though he brought corn, and was massive and tall,
The crown of his head you scarcely could see :
The Giant had got the wrong side of the wall!
His weight, if he clomb up, would make the bricks fall, —
So the Dwarf kept his day’s popularity
