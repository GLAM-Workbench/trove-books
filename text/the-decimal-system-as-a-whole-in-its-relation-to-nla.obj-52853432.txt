THE DECIMAL SYSTEM,
AS A WHOLE,
IN ITS RELATION TO TIME, MEASURE, WEIGHT,
CAPACITY, AND MONEY,
IN UNISON WITH EACH OTHER.
The author of this little pamphlet wrote a letter on the
Decimal System on the Ist of November, 1855, to the editor
of the Liverpool Albion, which was inserted in that paper on
the 19th of the same month, the substance of which is the base
of the present.
The Decimal System has been considered lately in relation
to money matters solely, without any other contemplation what-
ever, some beginning with the present sovereign, and others
again with the present penny, as a base for a decimal system.
Now, neither of these, as we shall presently see, has a definite
base for a system to rest upon; in fact, a base so fixed would
mean anything or nothing, and we might as well fix a base from
a piece of coal or a lump of anything for a standard, as the
present sovereign or penny piece.
As there are other transactions in daily use equally as
important as money, even commercially speaking, it will be as
well to contemplate the question as a whole system, in its relation
to Time, Measure, Weight, Capacity, and Money, and all, if
possible, to be in unison with each other. This is what we want,
then—a base for a decimal system in relation to more than the


one commodity, money; but also in relation to the daily trans-
actions, to time, weight, measure, capacity, and money, all in
unison with each other; and this is far more preferable than the
absurd one of beginning a system from a base that has no
meaning.
From what, then, shall we commence ? Where take
our standard, so as to have a base, a true hase, one that will
always remain so, whereon to raise the superstructure of the
whole ?
As I have proposed to compute Time decimally, I shall take
this first, as it embraces the system as a whole.
Time is, first of all, absolute—no beginning —no ending,
and immeasurable in space; therefore of this state we can form
no conception ; but the Creator has placed planets in the
universe, governed by an universal law of gravitation and
motion, and by the latter we can measure time in relation to
their respective motions through space.
I need not go beyond the solar system for illustration, as
the ordinary planets will suffice. Mercury, Venus, the Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, Herschel, &c., have each, according to their
respective distances from the sun, a different period of time to
complete their annual revolution round the sun, and, conse-
quently, they have different lengths to their respective years,
compared with each other.
The diurnal rotation of each likewise will differ according to
their velocity of motion, so that the day of one planet will not
agree with that of another; nevertheless, they are all compared
with each other in relation to the motion of our own planet—
the earth.
The earth, like the other planets, has two motions—an
annual motion round the sun, and a diurnal motion on its own
axis. The revolution of the earth round the sun is elliptical,
and as its axis is also oblique to the plane of the equator, the
angle formed by the plane of the ecliptic and the plane of the

equator produces the seasons, and the inequality of the length of
the days—these varying regularly, however, when the different
days of one year are compared with another.
The diurnal motion of the earth divides time into two periods
—day and night ; but as these are seldom equal periods of time,
it is considered as a whole, and not as a part. The diurnal
motion being considered one period, it has been subdivided by
the art of man by time-pieces into twenty-four equal periods,
called hours, and each of these again into periods of sixty, called
minutes, and these again into sixty, called seconds, for the pur-
poses of civil life : thus
I have said that man has divided the diurnal motion into
twenty-four hours; but he has divided it into two parts of twelve
hours each, or two revolutions of time for one of the earth, the
one beginning at midnight and terminating at noon, the other
beginning at noon and terminating at midnight. Now, as this
does not exist in nature, why should we have two revolutions of
time to one of our globe ? Does it not frequently lead to con-
fusion ? Of this we shall presently see.
Again, it would not do to begin the day at noon, because if
we did, it would have to be called one date before noon, and
another date after noon, while the sun had been above the
horison all the time ; and as it had been all the one day, it is,
after all, the best to begin the day when the sun is at the
antipodes.
We should, therefore, make time of one period correspond
to the revolution of the earth on its own axis, or diurnal motion,
and keep time by a clock—call it an astronomical clock, if you
like and it would indicate time as follows. But as I have had

a time-piece constructed for myself by my brother, I shall now
describe it.
The external circle of the dial is divided (as the annexed
diagram shows) into 100° or parts, and commencing at 0 when
the sun is in the nadir, at every 10° there are the 10 hours to
correspond to the diurnal revolution of the earth.
The hour hand moves from east to west, like the sun when
we are looking to the north, (as this is considered the chief car-
dinal point of the compass, the magnetic needle always pointing
there,) and the dial faces the south, t The clock works the
reverse of the present one, as well as the reverse of the earth’s
diurnal motion, when so fixed ; hut by doing so, it nearly
follows and points out the sun’s locality above and below the
horison, and it is noon at five o’clock, when the sun is in the
zenith, and it completes the ten hours, or the whole day, when
the hour hand again arrives at nadir, showing that the sun is
below our feet, or, rather, that we are on the far-off surface of
the earth from the sun.
The time-piece on the mantel-piece now going works as
follows:—The hour hand moves I°, while the minute hand
moves 10° or minutes, and while the seconds hand goes round
10 times, indicating 1,000 seconds; or, the hour hand goes
10° or one hour, while the minute hand goes once round, or 100
minutes, and the seconds hand goes 100 times round, indicating
10.000 seconds; or, the hour hand goes once round, indicating
10 hours for the whole day, the minute hand goes ten times
round, indicating 1,000 minutes, and the seconds hand goes
1.000 times round, indicating 100,000 seconds. It is con-
structed on the most approved principles of the best clocks, and
beats dead decimal seconds. I will tabulate its working thus—

It chimes quarters as follows :
Thus, if time was kept decimally as above, a quarter of an hour
being allowed for breakfast and half an hour for dinner to
artisans, &c., they would gain six minutes more time to their
former repast, and twelve minutes more to the latter, than they
have at present.
The day begins at midnight, and the time-piece strikes the
10 hours throughout the whole day until midnight again, without
any repetition, and it also chimes the quarters, so that there is
no contusion of 2 a. m. or 2 p.m., 3 a. m. or 8 p. m., and this
would prevent mistakes in travelling; and as there are two
circles, the external for the decimal, and the internal for the
present mode of computing time, the hour hand points to both
at once, so that those who prefer the one to the other can do so,
until use would conquer time-honoured usage and prejudice.
But, to show that the present method has its drawbacks, I
will relate two anecdotes, and similar incidents are, no doubt, of
daily occurrence.
Two sailors, among others, after a long cruise, were paid off,
and they determined to go and see their relatives in the coun-
try. As the railway was the only available way by which they
could accomplish their intended journey, they proceeded to the
station to ascertain the time of departure of the trains, and oh
being referred to the time-tables, they examined them and fixed
upon one of the departures, and were about to leave the station
to enjoy themselves until the time arrived, when one said to the
other, “ I say, mate, what does p. m. mean at the end of the
time for starting?” “I don’t know,” replied his companion ;
and now, sailor-like, they both began to scratch their heads, as
is usual when some knotty point is to be solved. At last one


exclaimed, " I have it, you lubber; p. m. means punctual to a
minute .” So they departed; but whether they arrived again
at the station in time for the train, deponent sayeth not.
Nevertheless, there are many more persons mistaken than
poor Jack, who cannot be called ignorant of the fact of ante-
and post-meridian, as the following case will illustrate, and it
shows also the inconvenience and annoyance the mistake involves
a person in sometimes. A friend of the author’s was staying
some time ago in Paris, and being desirous of returning to
London by a given time, he deferred it until the last favourable
opportunity of so doing, so as just to be in time for his engage-
ments. On referring to the published time-tables, he found the
train to leave Paris at 12.15 p. m. It was plain enough. P. M.
in a moment flashed across his mind, was equivalent to evening,
and proceeded forthwith to put the hook in his pocket without
another moment’s reflection, and not even troubling his mind
more about it. He went and saw all his friends that day, dined
and took tea with some, and even took supper with others,
returned to his hotel, ordered a coach at eleven o’clock, paid
his bills, &e., and departed for the station to start per rail, and
just be in time to meet the steamer for England. Off he drove
to the station pell-mell, and arrived at the station at ten minutes
to twelve. Oh! lots of time, thought he; but, by-and-by,
seeing no signs of a train leaving, he inquired if a train would
soon be leaving. He was then informed that the train left at
fifteen minutes past noon, not past midnight, which would be
morning. Of course he was greatly annoyed at his own want
of thought. He had to go back again to the hotel, and
re-engage lodgings. He missed the steamer, and was conse-
quently behind all his engagements in England. So much for
a. m. and p. m. not being always attended to, and its inevitable
results—confusion.
Now, as I have been measuring time according to the period
of the earth’s rotation on its own axis, I will compare the decb

mal with the present time. The earth’s whole circumference
has passed once before the sun during this period; therefore, I
make the measurement of time correspond to the measure of its
circumference. But the circle has hitherto been divided into
360° or parts; nevertheless, it is quite arbitrary, and as I am
going to propose a complete decimal system in relation to time,
measure, weight, capacity, and money, I shall take the circle
and divide it into one hundred parts. This is quite as feasible
as the present 360° or parts, although the change would upset
all trigonometrical tables; nevertheless, all those who are adepts
at this branch of mathematical science would find no great
difficulty in substituting one series for the other. Changes,
likewise, would always be slow in coming into operation. The
only thing is to let the change come in gradually; but, also,
when it does commence, let it he on a right base, as this is the
great desideratum, and all the rest will follow.
Thus we see that the decimal second denotes a much less period
of time than the present clock does, and it is, therefore, better
adapted for astronomical calculation.
Now, if there were public astronomical clocks of this descrip-


tion, the public would become as well accustomed to them as to
the present clock. A person will say, “He arrived at five
o’clock.” “Which five?” is the demand, "a. m. or p. m. ?”
There would be no such necessity in the astronomical clock, but
a more simple and definite answer at once.
It may be asked, How would you introduce the new decimal
timepiece ? As it would prevent mistakes in travelling, first of
all let the railway companies erect decimal clocks at all the
stations, with dials on, similar to the lithographed diagram
accompanying this, so as to indicate both the decimal and the
present time at once ; and on their monthly time-tables let
them append a card dial with a moveable central index, so that,
if they gave decimal time for starting, the index would have
only to be turned round and it would tell the present time also.
This would answer very well until decimal watches, time-pieces,
and public clocks came more into vogue.
After twenty years or so, the central circle of old time might
be omitted as unnecessary, and the new decimal time dial left
alone in all its simplicity of arrangement.
It has been remarked by those in the trade that there are
not near the amount of watches in use as there might be for a
civilised people; and it will hold good of other civilised countries
also. This shows that even the civilised portion of humanity
have very few time-pieces, and a change like this would create
a demand, as the new piece of mechanism would gradually sup-
plant the old, and so trade would flourish; in fact, all these
changes would do so, and the mutual prosperity would be great:
instead of doing harm, the change would do good.
We will proceed with time in relation to the measurement of
the earth.
Bessel, the astronomer, has given, from all the geodetical
observations combined, the equatorial radius of the earth as
20,923,600 feet, and as the equatorial circumference is the
greatest measurement that we can have on our globe, I have

taken this as a standard. It produces 131,466,856 feet, so
that all nations might take it also; and from the late geodetical
operations, the length of any degree of latitude or longitude can
by mathematical calculation readily be obtained and tabulated,
in proportion to the earth’s greatest measurement.
But we would divide the circle, as before, into 100 degrees,
which at the equator would give 1,314,668‘56 feet to each
degree; and each degree we would divide into 100 miles, equal
to 13,146‘68 feet each; and each mile Into 100 hectometres,
equal to 181 - 46 feet each ; and each hectometre into 100
metres, equal to I*3l feet, or more exactly 1 foot 3'776 inches
each. The unit standard measure and this could be divided
into lOths, lOOths, and lOOOths for practical or philosophical
purposes: —
We will tabulate it a little more thus:

By the above table we keep angular measure in unison with
time, as it will be seen that there are 1,000 minutes of time to
the earth’s diurnal revolution, and 1,000 minutes of angular
measure to the circle ; likewise, 100,000 seconds of time to the
earth’s diurnal revolution, and 100,000 seconds of angular
measure to the circle, so that they correspond, which is better
than the present time of angular measure, compared thus:—
These look more in unison, however, than they really are;
for, as there are 94 hours to 860°, 360 - 24 = 15° to 1 hour;
and as 1 hour equals 60 minutes, and as 15° = 900', therefore
900 4- 00 = 15' to 1 minute of time ; and as 8,600 seconds
equals 1 hour of time, there are 900' x 60" = 54,000" of
angular measurement, and 54,000" -r 8,600 = 15" to 1 second
of time.
Now, if we put the decimal angular measure and the pre-
sent together, they will stand thus :
The present second of angular measure at the equator is
equal to 101 ’440 feet; but a second of decimal angular mea-
sure would be equal to 1,314 - 668 feet the same as time
and the 10th or decimal second would approach the angular
second now in use, 131‘466 feet = 1 decimal second (0"'l) (as
will be seen above, there are 19"'96 old to T" decimal); and

the O'Ol" would express 13*146 feet, and the O'OOl" = 1*314
feet, or the length of the proposed metre. By so doing we keep
angular and time measure in unison.
Decimal chronometers, therefore, would measure in less
proportion of time and length, and consequently they would be
more valuable both as regards navigation and astronomical cal-
culation, inasmuch as time and measure coincide with each other.
The present angular second would be somewhat less than the
decimal deci-second; but the latter could be reduced into its
lOths, lOOths, or lOOOths for minuter calculation.
As they are alike—minutes and seconds—we will represent
an angular measure table :
When I express lengths, I always refer to the equator for a
standard, as degrees, &c., vary in length on account of the
oblate spheroidal figure of the earth ; and when I express
diurnal revolution, the nocturnal is included in that term;
both are included in the term daily—once, or one revolution of
the earth on its axis.

For the purposes of navigation, the quadrant would be
divided thus:—
I
Supposing that the officers of a ship are about taking an
observation at noon for the longitude, &c. The chronometer,
by having a centre second pointer, is much more exact than one
which has none ; for while one officer is taking the angle of the
sun, &c., by the quadrant, the other could give him warning—
say thus : at ten seconds to noon, “ Be steady j” at one second
to noon, “ Steady;” stod at noon, “Now,” the moment the
three pointers come in line. At the latter signal, he has the
instrument fixed, and then notes the angle obtained, &c., and
this method would give a more correct definition of locality than
the present about noon observations. As they are several
seconds out of time, this leads to wide reckoning. Now, if two
officers of the ship took observations in the above method, the
locality of the ship might be defined within its own length,
because at the equator a second of decimal time is equal to
l,314 - 66 feet, and the deci second of angular measure 131 - 46
feet, its greatest range ; but in the higher latitudes the distance
of course would be less, as before stated, and almost the exact
spot on the ocean, within the length of their own ship, would be
indicated.
As the charts, maps, &c., in use represent portions of the
360° to the circle, they could be remarked, until, in process of
time, decimal scaled maps came in use.
As 1° dec. = 3‘6° old, 5° dec. = 18° old (5 x 3'6 = 18),
and as there are 20 x 18 = 360 in every circle, the decimal

degrees will coincide with the present 30 times in every circle
—thus:
These all correspond, the one series being equivalent to the
other. Now, if between every 18° old, five red lines were
marked, they would represent decimal degrees on any map at
present in use; and if the chart was on a large scale, mark
10' between each decimal degree ; and if on a very large scale,
mark 100" between every decimal minute, and it would do
the same.
Again, the intermediate angles to the twenty corresponding
equivalents would be expressed in these terms ; and it need only
be shown in the first quadrant, as they will follow the' same
throughout the four—thus:
and so on. Thus, again, irregularly:
But it is of no use going through all the equivalent terms ;
suffice it to say, that if the decimal system was adopted, the old
method of computing would be given up, and there would be no

necessity of knowing the equivalents. The difference being
known, the one series can readily be computed for the other,
when the numerical value is wanted, as they are frequently
expressed algebraically.
As we would prefer taking measure in relation to time, or
the earth’s rotation in one sidereal day, we, of course, take the
degrees of longitude at the equator as its greatest circumference
for our standard, in opposition to an arc of the meridian, which
does not so much relate to time.
Moreover, the polar diameter of the earth is less than the
equatorial by more than twenty-six miles, and we take the whole
circle instead of the quadrant; but as the latter is adopted by
the French from an arc of the meridian by actual measurement,
and divided into 10,000,000 parts, it will agree, commercially
speaking, as the difference is so little, with the proposed deca-
metre divided by four, as the latter takes the whole circle ; or
two and a half proposed metres nearly equals the French metre,
as the latter equals 39*37 English inches ; and one-fourth of a
proposed decametre would equal 39 - 44 inches—a difference
only of a seventh part more when the inch is divided into hun-
dredths, scarcely a recognised commercial difference.
Again, the tenth part of the French metre or decimetre is
equal to 3 inches and 937 decimals, agreeing almost with the
proposed quarter metre, equalling 3 inches and 944 decimals. —
(Vide the rude comparison in the Diagram.) Philosophically
speaking, the difference is great; but commercially, it is not recog-
nisable. What, then, is to prevent a metre measure being intro-
duced at once ? as it is a convenient length —15’776 inches—
and very applicable to the measurement of any article in daily use.
Again, land could be sold by this decimal square measure,
as can be seen—thus:


1 acre =
4,840 square yards
= 1
1 rood =
1,310
= i
1 perch =
30£
— l
Suppose, for instance, a piece of land is going to be sold,
measuring 7 acres, I rood, and 38 perches; this measure can
be reduced to the decimal; but we will first give the respective
proportions of the present land measure :
Therefore, 7 a. Ir. and 38 p. are equal to 36,MS'S square
yards, and this reduced decimally would equal 8 hectometres,
96 decametres, and 94‘30 metres; so that the hectometre
would stand in the place of the acre, although less in extent;
1 acre = 4840-000 square yards.
I hectom. = 4382 228 „
Difference . . 477 772 ,
and as the above is simple enough, any quantity (great or small)
of land could be reduced to the decimal scale in the same
manner.
If, for instance, the Messrs. Traughton, or any other philo-
sophical instrument maker, were commanded by authority to
make a standard metre of 15‘776 inches long, divided into
XOths, lOOths, and l,000ths for common purposes, and a copy
of this standard sent to all the mayors in the United Kingdom,
to be used by them officially as a standard for comparison with
those sent by the various makers of the district, and when found
correct, all metres to be stamped with the crown mark as correct,
none others to he legal; this part of the decimal system could
be accomplished in twelve months, and it would be an instalment
in the right direction; and it would particularly encourage the
Birmingham trade for a considerable period.
Now, if every nation adopted the length of the seconds pen-
dulum from the locality of their chief town as their standard of
length, every nation would have a different standard, as the

length of the pendulum depends on the force of gravity, it being
less at the equator and greater at the poles, on account of the
oblate spheroidal form of the globe. Its length, then, would
vary every latitude, and this would lead to nothing but confu-
sion, especially in the now frequent intercourse of nations.
Let, then, a portion of the earth’s greatest circumference be
taken as a standard, and other nations may take it as their
standard also. We have it in relation to time without the con-
fusion of four minutes = I°, or 15" equals 1 second of time, &c.
So far so good; but all things will not coincide with this arrange-
ment. For instance, the moon’s rotation round the earth is 29
days, 12 hours, 44' 2"‘9 sec. mean; consequently, there are
neither twelve nor thirteen months exactly in the year, so .that
we cannot so divide the year into equal parts as to follow her
rotation.
Neither the year or earth’s revolution, nor the moon’s,
will adapt themselves to the decimal system; but we may divide
the year into ten months, thus :
Every leap year, the tenth or last month to add one day, so
that each half year would contain 183 days, or 366 days in the
year. As it is not spring, summer, autumn, or winter every-
where at the same time, we have no right to call the months
after the seasons; but the simple enumeration of them will he


sufficient for the whole world, as the seasons vary according to
locality in each period.
It is high time to drop off calling the months or the days of
the week after Eoman emperors, Saxon gods, or planets, &c., as
they bear no relation to the time. The present four last months
are misnomers, for they are not the seventh, eighth, ninth, and
tenth months. They may have been, but they are not now.
Then why call them so ? The seventh day, or Sabbath, accord-
ing to Holy Writ, is the end of the week, and we ought to adopt
the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh days
accordingly. The Christian world has adopted the first day as
its Sabbath, in commemoration of Christ’s resurrection on that
day, the six following being those of labour.
Thus, we would have newspapers dated, say “ Liverpool, Ist
November, 1862, (4th day, 43rd week,)” meaning Wednesday
of the forty-third week in the year. This would he better than
the present foolish names—Sunday, or the Sun’s day ; Monday,
or the Moon’s day; Tuesday, after Tuesco, the Saxon god of
war ; Wednesday, or Woden’s day; Thursday, from Thor, the
Scandinavian god of thunder ; Friday, from Friga, the Saxon
goddess; and Saturday, or Saturn’s day. As if the sun shone
only on a Sunday, or the moon on Monday, &c. Dedications
with a vengeance !
Again, as wo are known to be in error four years since the
birth of Christ, as that era is adopted, why should we not call
1858 1862, as that would give the true period? Why stick
so tenaciously to error? for, in rectifying this, it would not
create any more difficulty than the old and new styles did in
reforming the calendar, last century, from the Julian to the
Gregorian reckoning of time.
So the creation of Adam is computed to be 4000 years
B. 0. (4004 years, computing from the vulgar era); but how
long the earth was in existence before we cannot tell, as geolo


gioal enquiry lias proved it to have been in existence long before
it was in a fit state to receive man as an inhabitant.
As it is, we should prefer taking the true Christian era as
our standard, since that is more definite. Now, the commence-
ment of the year is not known by any natural phenomena, and
is purely arbitrary. We would, therefore, begin the new year
at the anniversary of the birth of Christ, as we adopt that era.
This has been an unsettled day, for the day of Annunciation, the
25th of March, now called Lady-day, was, before the alteration
of style—3rd September, 1752 —the official commencement of
the new year ; but, as the birth of Christ happened on the 25th
of December-—the day of his appearance on earth—we, as part
of the Christian world, ought to compute our years from this
day. Moreover, the English did do so before the Norman inva-
sion ; but William the Conqueror was crowned on the Ist of
January, and he began the year afterwards on that day.
Commencing the new year, then, on Christmas-day, say of
the vulgar era 1857, that day would be 1858, —or, more cor-
rectly, it would be the new year’s day in the year of our Lord
1863, — Ist TJnusber, 1863, the true Christian period since the
birth of Christ ; and A. M,, or from the creation of Adam,
would be 5863.
We will tabulate the true Christian year 1862 thus: first,
as it would appear arranged in an almanac, with the number of
days of the year, week, and month respectively; and, secondly,
weekly, under the seven days of the week, and the ten decimal
months.
Christmas-day, 1857, falls on a Friday, or the sixth day of
the week, consequently, the year would begin on that day : this
year we shall call 1862.

1862.


The anniversary of the battle of Waterloo is on the 18th of
June, or the 169th day of the year; hut as we propose to begin
the year at the anniversary of the birth of Christ, instead of at
the Circumcision, it will he seven days later, viz., on the 176th
day of the year, or the 80th Quinqueher of the decimal months,
and so on with any other anniversary; and to make former dates
agree with the true Christian era, add four years also to the
present vulgar era. Thus, again, the battle of Waterloo took
place in 1816 of the vulgar era : this could be written thus:—
18th June, 1815.
30th Quinqueber, 1819,
The same as the old and new styles are when referring to dates
historically anterior to the 3rd of September, 1753.
In this way all historical events would be referred to the
true Christian era. It was first introduced in the sixth century;
but as there crept In an error of four years after the time at the
date of its first computation, this addition now requires to be
made.
Accounts could be kept daily, weekly, monthly, bi-monthly,
half-yearly, and yearly. The bi-monthly period of time would
be similar to the present quarterly, there being five instead of
four to the year. This would be a very convenient period of
time for public companies, such as water, gas, &c., to keep
their accounts current with the public,
I shall now proceed to the consideration of Weight, &c.
We ought to have a standard from some known quantity,
and as we at the present moment have no standard weight or
measure in existence, it would be as well to look for one.
The lost standards were copies of the old Saxon, the pound
weight being taken from the weight of the grains of wheat, and
the measure from the length of barley corns, neither always true.
But Henry YII. increased the pound weight l-16th. Why?
The reason is not obvious, and therefore grain weights no longer

represented their namesake—the wheat. This is our standard
Troy weight, containing 5,760 parts, called grains, with which
the precious metals are weighed. But Henry YIIL, in order to
make the butchers give good weight, ordered that 7,000 such
parts should be a pound. This latter is the Avoirdupois weight,
as its name implies, “to have good weight.” It is now our
commercial pound, and from its subdivisions creates great confu-
sion, as will be seen thus :
Can confusion be worse than this ? Yet these are the weights
that have been taken originally from the weight of grain. Do
they all grow the same size or weight ? Surely, on good soil
the wheat will be larger and richer than that grown on poor soil.
As it is, we have no true standard at all.
A few facts, then. Sir Isaac Newton first demonstrated
that weight is the force of gravity, and not gravity itself. It
follows, therefore, that gravity is the force acting on each of the
particles of an elementary body downwards, and the weight of a
body is the product of the gravity of a single particle, by the
number of particles combined by molecular attraction which it
contains. The weight of two bodies are to each other as the
quantity of matter in them, and they are of equal weight when
they balance each other. As weight is the force of gravity,
bodies will not weigh so much on the top of mountains, or at the
equator (where gravity is less, in consequence of the centrifugal
force counteracting it), as they will do at the level of the sea in
other places. The atmosphere, again, takes off a portion of the
weight of a body, and according to its density or pressure will a
body be more or less heavy; and temperature also increases or
diminishes the bulk of a body.


Therefore, in all standards there should be fixed points set-
tled for the temperature, weight of atmosphere, and level, &c.,
as these facts, being unnoticed, will lead to different estimates.
Air and water are the most universal fluids in nature; but
we would tate our standard from the latter, as it is more readily
measured than air as a comparison. It is a beautiful provision
in nature that water is at its greatest density at 40° Fahrenheit
(variously estimated at 89°*2 up to 40° Fah.), and expands again
when approaching its solid form —ice. It expands again when
heated above 40° Fah., and reaches its boiling point at 212°
Fah. ; barometer, 80 inches. It undergoes very little density
by pressure, and we would, therefore, take our standard at its
greatest density: this we should call o°, and its boiling point
100°. Water, in a state of nature, contains many salts; but
we might begin by calling the weight of distilled drops equal to
grain weights. They vary, however, according to the vessel’s
shape from which they are poured, &c., and 120 drops of water
occupy as much bulk as 280 drops of spirit do.
As this is the case, it will be better to know the weight of a
given cubic measure, and this latter a definite portion of the
earth’s measure.
From the well-known and oft-repeated experiments of Dalton,
a cubic inch of distilled water weighs at 62° Fah. 252 458
grains; but as we prefer water at its greatest density for a
standard, 1 cubic inch at 40° Fah., the barometer 30 in., equal
to 253'051 grains troy. This is the greatest density of the
most universal fluid in nature, and this, then, is our standard.
The weight of a cubic inch being 253‘051 grains troy, the
proposed cubic metre of 15 - 776 inches would give 3926’382
cubic inches, and its weight would be 993,576 grains and
911-908 decimals, or 172 lbs, 5 oz. 19 dwts. o*9 grs. troy:
this is 141 lbs. 15 oz. 1-989 drs. avoirdupois.
This cubic weight we should call our 100 lb. weight, and
one pound would be equal to 1 lb. 8 oz. 18 dwts. 23 - 76 grs..

or 9935’70 grs. We would divide it accordingly, and, as will
be seen, it very nearly approaches the grain troy.
Weights should not have loose rings for handles, as the wear
and tear between the two lessens the weight while in use ; but
they should be solid with the body of the weight, and of brass,
if practicable, because iron weights oxidise (rust) so rapidly in
the open atmosphere, as is the case with the Customs’ weights
on the quays, &c., so that they gain, and the merchants pay for
more weight than they have really obtained. The larger weights
and measures of liquids and capacity would be for commerce ;
the smaller for trade, gold, silver, &c., and all commodities to
be sold by weight when practicable, with the exception of liquids.
Prom weight we would take our measures of liquids and
capacity, one cubic metre equalling (14 gallons, 0 quart, 1 pint,
0 - 570 gill, imperial measure) 10 gallons. Thus :

As regards the manner of introducing these decimal weights
and measures, Government might, through the Customs, begin
the initiative by just contracting for the supply of brass weights
for all the principal ports of the kingdom, and selling off the old
iron weights, to he used for other purposes; There would be
plenty of firms ready and willing to contract, in the same manner
as they did during the late war for the supply of cannon balls.
Other firms would supply the trade for the public. The chief
magistrate of each district to have a copy of all measures, and
stamp those made by private individuals before they are recog-
nised as legal.
After the Act of Parliament came into force, coopers, glass
and measure manufacturers, &o. would conform to the legal

size indicated in the decimal measures, &c., and the old would
gradually become obsolete articles, and used for other purposes.
Tubs, barrels, &c,, would be made to hold decimal portions:
those now in use would be used up or sent abroad. As regards
bottles, we never get a proper measure now, and it would be as
well to order a proper legal decimal standard at once. Bottles,
moreover, get broken fast enough, and are now shipped abroad,
so that the trade could supply the public very soon with decimal
bottles, all the present being used as fast as made.
So much for weights and measures, &c.
We next come to Money. The precious metals have been
chosen for coins, as more convenient for circulation, and less
liable to alter in value, than any other commodity. The metals
chosen are gold, silver, and copper, and their specific gravities
are (water as unity)—gold, 19’861; silver, lO'olO; copper,
B‘9oo. But these metals of themselves are too soft for the
wear and tear that they have to undergo, and if money was
coined out of the pure metals it would soon lose its value from
loss of weight, but by adding a definite proportion of alloy they
are made durable.
The English standard has been found to wear well, and is as
follows :
As standard gold of 193 - 274 grains troy equals 90 shillings,
the drachm, or the 100th part of our proposed pound weight,
would equal 99'357 grs. troy, or 16s. 1’436d., &c. Government

coppers, the penny having five mills to it; and also that the
values coincide with the French system of money, only we make
the florin into 100 mills, instead of the franc. This keeps the
coins of a convenient size for circulation.
The above comes from—lst, the measurement of the earth
at its greatest circumference; 2nd, the unit of that measure
taken for its standard of weight ; and, 3rd, the 10,000 th part
of that weight the unit of our money system. Such would be
the system that we would propose, and, if once adopted, would
remain for ever true.
Binary quantities will always be required ; so, if a man
wants 2,4, 6,8, &c., ounces of tobacco or tea, it will not affect
10 ounces = 1 lb.; or if a person wants 1,8, 6,7, or 9 metres
of cloth, it will not cause any detriment, because 10 metres
are = 1 decametre, &c.

The introduction of the decimal system, founded on a true
basis, as above indicated, would involve the recoinage of all the
moneys in circulation; and we will now indicate the least incon-
venient and most practical method of introducing the decimal
coinage.
But, first of all, we will look to the present powers of the
Mint. There are eight coiners’ presses, each capable of stamp-
ing any coin once in a second of time. Now, 10£ hours is full
time to a working day, and the eight presses would complete
thus 802,400 coins per day ; and as there are 318 working days
in the year, they could complete 94,661,200 coins per annum.
This is without any extra work, and if we add one hour per day,
or 11J hours, the Mint could produce 108,665,600 coins per
annum Money is sent out from the Mint in what is technically
termed journey weights thus :
Gold = 15 fb troy = £7Ol, or 1,403 half sovereigns.
Silver = 60 lb „ = £l9B, or 3,960 shillings, &c.
Copper = 50 fb avoir. = M, or 1,200 pence, &c.
The first step in the introduction of the decimal coins would
he to begin with the copper coinage, to meet the convenience of
the humble in life, and familiarise them with the system imper-
ceptibly. We would then commence with the decimal copper
coinage. How does the proposed system and its values corre-
spond to the present copper coinage ? It is more simple than it
looks at first sight, and the lower we come, the nearer they
approach—as 16s. 2d. is the value of a proposed decimal
sovereign, this contains 194 pence; but we divide this amount
into 200 decimal pence, so that the decimal and the present
pence would stand in this relation:—


So that below this they may he said to be equal in value, and as
twelve pence is the legal tender, the decimal penny would stand
equivalent to the present one in exchange, only the decimal
penny would have five mills to it instead oi four farthings.
We could still boast, then, although we changed to a deci-
mal system, of our Saxon penny with as much pride as the
Americans do of their almighty dollar. As far as the legal
tender went in trade and domestic purchases, the decimal penny
and the present would be equal.* The halfpenny we would
abolish, as the mills would answer better, the poor man some-
times perhaps being able to drive a bargain for two mills,
what would be considered worth three mills, and so on, so
that we would have only two copper coins—the mill and the
penny.
It has been said by the opponents' of the decimal system that
the poor apple-women would be distracted by calculating the
difference of value. This is all moonshine, and only asserted
for argument’s sake.
Now, to get rid of the halfpence and farthings, we might as
well exchange all the old copper for the decimals, and this could
be done by having Government depots in the market-places of
all the chief towns, and tradesmen, licensed victuallers, &c.,
might be requested to exchange their old coppers for the
decimal.
The decimal coppers at the depots might be ready tied up
in two packages, one containing 50 decimal pence, the second,
250 mills = 48J old coppers. This is the quarter of the deci-
mal pound, and tradesmen bringing a quarter of a decimal
sovereign would gain if half, Bd. ; and if 194 pence,
would gain 6d. This would be an encouragement to tradesmen
to collect the coppers for the Government depots, and 6d. would
be the gain of every tradesman who exchanged a sovereign, or
*ln the legal tender, 12i pence old would equal 12J decimal pence—a difference
of |of a penny. This is not a halfpenny difference.
s


194 pence, for 200 decimal, as in legal tenders in business 12
would be equal to the old.*
We have before seen that the Mint is capable of issuing
100,000,000 coins per annum, and in these islands we may say
that there are in round numbers 30,000,000 persons. Now,
if the Mint coined the copper coin for two years, it would pro-
duce, say
90,000,000 pence.
170.000. mills.
200.000. copper coins.
In two years, then, nearly the same amount of copper coin of
the present system would have found their way back to the Mint,
and neither the money of accounts nor the banks yet interfered
with; and this might be continued for a year or two longer, to
exhaust all the old copper in circulation, before we proceeded
with the next stage—the introduction of the decimal silver
coins,!
The most essential silver coins would be the florin, the franc,
and the cent; and in introducing these we need not yet alter
the money system, as they could be applied in exchange to the
present sovereign—thus:
1 sovereign 13 florins V 3 cents, 1 penny, 1 mill.
1 „ =24 francs ) „ „ „
We would not introduce the other silver decimal coins until all
the old stock was re-coined. In three years’ coinage with the
silver, there could he issued 300,090,000 coins: say—
-100.000. florins
100.000. francs silver coins.
100.000. cents
* The Government depots would only receive the old copper coins in exchange for
the decimals, viz., copper for copper, and not to give copper in exchange for
silver, &o.
+ The postage and receipt stamp plates would have a row from each side erased
—l6» X2O = 200 to the sheet—the moment the decimal sovereign was proclaimed
I egal.


This amount would displace silver coins in use equal to this
value.
The value of the present silver coins are well known in pro-
portion to the present sovereign, and we would go on with the
silver decimal coinage to exhaust all the old silver until the
decimal sovereign was proclaimed, which Would in a moment
alter the money system to the decimal.
The banks and money-order offices would of course he the
vehicles with the public in issuing the silver coinage, and the old
would be re-coined in exchange for the old in amounts of one
sovereign, equal value, viz.:—4 crowns, 8 half-crowns, 10
present florins, 20 shillings, 40 sixpences, &c., = £l, and in
exchange the values of the three decimal coins above indicated.
Having accomplished this, we would have now, at the end
*of five years after the sanction by Parliament to the decimal
system, and not before, issued, say in the third month of the
sixth year, the new decimal sovereign, and a proclamation
that the money system of the United Kingdom would in future
be kept in S,, PL, CL, and M. There would still be the shil-
lings in circulation ; but yearly they would become less and less,
as the old silver coins became absorbed.*
We said at the third month of the sixth year, before the
proclamation, as this would give the Mint a good start, and it
would he absorbing the hank rests before the proclamation.
This year we would issue all gold coins 50,000,000
sovereigns, 50,000,000 angels. The Government seignorage
on this 75,000,000 would be £176,191 7s. 10d., which would
pay all expenses ; the corresponding value of the old going into
the Mint for re-coinage. With respect to stock account, &c,,
at the date of proclamation, the values corresponding to the
decimal system would merely have to be transferred to the
* A person receiving an old sovereign per week for wages would receive 1 decimal
sovereign, 2 florins, 3 cents, 1 penny, and 1 mill as an equivalent. 10 florins and 20
francs would be now easy to the decimal sovereign.


decimal accounts in the ledgers, &c. Money would not inter-
fere with this change.
When the old coins became scarce, the intermediate decimal
coins might be introduced, for the purpose of change and con-
venience. These changes w r ould produce a little inconvenience
at first, but they would become daily less so, and all classes
would willingly aid in a system that, if once established, need
never be disturbed.
But the precious metals are represented by paper, and it is
of no value ; but inasmuch as it stamds in the place of money,
i. e., the money is there before it can be issued, and must
always be there when required for this paper, it is equally as
good in this case as the gold itself. This is a great convenience
to the mercantile community, as it would never do to be always
interchanging coined money for every transaction, and this is a
great boon. Bills, &0., represent money in the same manner.
It is to be hoped that the Government of this country will
always insist that the paper currency of this country shall always
be represented by the precious metals ; and however commercial
speculators may growl at this, when they desire it otherwise, let
them do so, as their speculations are becoming then more a
species of black-legging than legitimate commerce. The total
paper money in circulation in the United Kingdom is about
£40.000,000.
At the date of the proclamation of the decimal system,
decimal notes to be issued along with the coins; and to distin-
guish the decimal notes from those in circulation, let them be
stamped by the Bank press on coloured paper —the three pri-
mitive colours to indicate the values of each set at first sight;
also, let them be slightly of a different size, say a half by a
quarter metre (7’BBB in. by 8'944 in.): the halves would then
be of a convenient size to send per post. The red for £5, the
blue for £lO, and the yellow for £2O and upwards.
As soon as a proclamation was issued, the old value of notes


would cease being issued, and after that date all would be deci-
mal notes. The old notes in circulation would demand their
value when presented, and they would he known by these differ-
ences : first, their black type on white paper ; secondly, their
dates, being all anterior to the proclamation ; and, thirdly, by
being of a different size.
A decimal five pound note would demand £A Os. lOd. of
old money, and an old five pound note would oommand £6
(decimal) and three shillings. This interchange would soon pass
away, as old notes would find their way back to tUe banks, and
never be seen again.
Business would be transacted more readily at the banks by
the notes of different values being of different colours, as a
change of colour in a note would instantly be detected in its
wrong lot of notes, and they would be issued out to the public
without half the trouble of examination of the amounts of each
as at present. This would be our method of introducing the
decimal coins to the nation; and as we have before this come
from the guinea, valued at 215., with its corresponding crowns
and half-crowns, &c., so can we come to the decimal sovereign;
but first of all, let our philosophers fix a better standard of
weights, &c., than those we have at present, based on nothing
definite ; and when they have determined and settled this point,
let our statesmen accede to those views, and enact them, that
they may become fixed also by the law of the land. We do not
want the whole system at once ; but let us have one part of it
at a time, and that part based on a definite state of nature,
so that when one is established, the rest can follow on the same
base.
Other civilised nations will follow in the train, and then there
will be one universal system of time, measure, weight, capacity,
and money —the last only affected by the rate of exchange and
according to its scarcity or abundance: if the former, it will be
dear; if the latter, cheap. Let the standard of coinage be the


same all over the world, and the coins would, although bearing
different images, names, and superscriptions, be equal in value.
Again, then, before any more changes are contemplated, let
us have a base fixed upon in unison with the proportions of the
earth and its elements, so that, when once effected, it will stand
true throughout all time.
Thus we would have universal systems of time, measure,
weight, capacity, and money based on the unity of the elements
and proportions of the globe which man inhabits.
