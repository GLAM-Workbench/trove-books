LINES DEDICATED TO
Iv£:k. g-eokge
On his miraculous escapd from the wreck of the .. Fife shire," Sunday, 23rd May, 1886.
HE clocks were striking twelve at night,
When the u Fifeshire ” left the Quay,
With a score of sportive nimrods
To fish off Bungaree.
Yes! twenty souls were there on board,
All eager for the sport,
In fancy they began to count
The schnappers they had caught.
Because the whiskey had run out
They felt inclined to weep,
Till folded in their blankets warm,
They quickly fell asleep.
Among them slept that comrade bold,
Well known as f ‘ Georgie Skinner,”
Though none so gallant there as he ;
I fancy some were thinner.
And Georgie had his bosom friend
Then on his best behaviour,
For he provided all the grog:
This kind, good natured Paviour.
But from my tale I have digressed.
Whilst talking of George Skinner ;
So I must quickly push ahead,
Or else I’ll lose my dinner.
At half-past two the reef was passed ;
The night was all serene,
And djrnly in the distance far,
Barren joey's light was seen.
On ! on ! she went ; the light was passed :
When suddenly it vanished.
A fog came down so thick and dense,
The moon and stars were banished.
Aow Georgie, and his bosom friend.
From slumber just were waking,
When on their backs they both were thrown,
And got an frightful shaking.
The steamer it appears had struck,
Whilst driving through the fog,
Upon a beach near Terrigal,
And stuck there like a log.
Poor Georgie commenced to storm and swear :
The others cried with fear,
For few among them seemed to doubt
Their end was verv near.
j
The fog still clothed them like a veil,
Nor clearly could they see,
Whether the Bomborah they had struck,
Or fearful Bungaree.
Now, Georgie brought more whiskey out,
And took a boatswain’s nip,
Then told his comrades, there and then
H’d leave the blooming ship.
And this he did when daylight came,
Alas ! the sad mishap,
For when on land, he found he’d lost
His lines, his coat and cap.
Poor Paviour had a gammy leg,
* And longed to be ashore,
For plainly could his cries be heard
Adove the ocean’s roar.
George Skinner heard his friend’s wild cry,
From off the stranded boat
But answered sitting on a rock,
“ I’ve lost my overcoat.”
A friend at last Jim Paviour pot,
V J J
Who pited his sore knee,
And tried to carry him ashore,
But fell into the sea.
At last they all were safe on land,
And started on their road,
To try and make the nearest port,
With for too light a load.
A twelve mile walk they much enjoyed,
No pubs were on the way,
Whether or not they had a nip,
I’m sure I cannot say.
They reached the port, and at the pier
A steamer there they found,
this crew of shipwrecked mariners,
All homeward soon were bound.
Alas ! how sordid are some minds,
Despite their sad disaster,
They had to pay three bob apiece,
Extorted by the master.
*
Now Georgie, take a friends advice,
On Sundays go to church,
Or may be at some future time,
They’ll leave you in the lurch.
You’ll also find that in the choir,
You safer far will be.
Phan trying to catch the Schuapper,
Away off Bungaree.
* Mr. Paviour desires us to say that he was not in the least frigh
tened, in fact he rather enjoyed himself.
