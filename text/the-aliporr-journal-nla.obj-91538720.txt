politics, agriculture, science, astronomy, fye. The whole
crew are bribed to give earlier intelligence of high-water,
sun-rising, moon-setting, change of wind, fyc., than can be
obtained from the chief officers. Births, deaths, and mar-
riages, will be inserted on moderate terms, and means
taken to ensure a supply. Advertisements of sales, and
all other events will be recorded.
The defences of the nation, and many other most import-
ant ends have been secured by the glorious erection of
" Our Pump !” Our Pump ! two little words, but of
tmmense import! Upon this small yet mysterious engine
depend not only the proper regulation and enforcement of
our Water Supply,—our Sewerage, our Drainage, our
Ventilation, —the health of the Fleas and Children, —the
means of the Chief Engineer raising the Wind for his
Whistle, —and many other minor matters; but, what is of
much greater consequence to the success of this Journal ?
we possess in “ Our Pump” the means of extending our
influence to the most distant parts of the Ship, and of in-
jecting our doctrines into the most obdurate hearts . Aided
by the blessings of Gutta Ptreha, our Telegraphic Corn--
munication is now complete with all the four quarters of
the Globe, and Australia, —Ireland will be included at
soon as its entire removal to America is completed. Few
who witnessed the anxious engineering difficulties affixing
Our Pump had a suspicion that the Gutta Percha tubing
would, in the course of that night, be placed in connexion
with the Moorgate Street Station; but the Engineer was
on Wires till the task was accomplished, when he sank
exhausted upon his pillow, his Whistle in his hand, and
murmuring, " Aut Cxsar aut nullus!” True, Echo
answered “nullusbut “ that's nothing” said the E/o-
--gineer.
In the LadieP Department we have the powerful sup*
port of several pairs of Ultra Marine Hose; and, by the
illusion of a little manly vigour into Our Patterns, we an*
ticipaie producing a galaxy of back-stitch, herring-bone,
and Vandyck, that will not only defy competition, but ut-
terly puzzle the vulgar and confound the wise . “Fashions’*
will be under the care of a very influential Parisian ; and
Pickles and Household Mixtures will come from several


hands who have had but too much experience on tat voyage
In thus commencing one of the most important Journals
ever produced in the middle of the Ocean, we have felt «»
necessary to lay before our Thirly-iwo Subscribers some
account of our plans, and of the many difficulties we have
countered in the enterprise. Inaided by Queen Lords,
or Commons ( except Short Ditto in the way of Beer:, we
have perseveringly pursued our way, overcoming every en-
gineering difficulty, and filling up every literary
