TASMANIA.
This charming little island, distant from Melbourne about 270 miles, is
now included in our tourist system, and we can offer facilities that were non-
existent a few years ago for visiting its forests and orchards, its beautiful lakes,
its varied river and mountain scenery, and places of historic interest. The
Tasmanian Government Railway-Department are our agents for Tasmania,
and the list of organised “Tasmanian Tours,” initiated in 1894, now embraces
nearly every portion of the island, and is steadily increasing.
Hobart, the Capital, is picturesquely situated at the foot of Mount
Wellington, on the shore of a magnificent harbour. Launceston, the second
city in the island, lies 40 miles inland from the North Coast, and on the
Tamar River. The two cities are connected by rail, a journey of six hours,
and the actual sea passage from Port Phillip Heads (Melbourne) to the
Tamar Heads only occupies about 15 hours. Both cities are in regular
steam communication with Melbourne and Sydney, and there is a regular
service between Hobart and New Zealand. Steam communication also
connects Melbourne and Sydney with Devonport, Burnie, and Stanley, on
the North Coast of Tasmania, and Melbourne with Macquarie Harbour on
the West Coast. A fortnightly service between London and Hobart direct
is maintained by the fine ocean steamers of the New Zealand Shipping
Company and the Shaw, Saville, & Albion Company.
With regard to any localities not dealt with in our advertised list of Tas-
manian tdurs, information can be obtained from our agencies free of charge.
To enable us satisfactorily to answer the ever varying inquiries of intend-
ing travellers has involved years of work and heavy expense, but it has
always been a feature of our business that the public may count upon
receiving at any of our offices, without charge, such information as they may
need to enable them to commence their tours with confidence. Those passing
under our hands may do so with the assurance that their wants are our care.
I 8^


All we ask, where information is obtained through us, is that, all else
being equal, enquirers show their appreciation by placing their arrangements
in our hands should they decide to make their proposed tour, and we
guarantee that our arrangements will relieve our clients of many of the petty
worries connected with travelling.
Tourists have not to pay us commission, our remuneration being derived
exclusively from the carrying companies whose agents we are. In no case do
we charge more than those companies’ advertised rates, while in Connection
with many tours the traveller will pay less than if he arranged the trip
himself, owing to special concessions granted us. In preparing such tours
we have every facility at our command that the experience of over fifty
years can suggest, and nothing is left undone to render our system perfect.
Travellers will find “ Cook and Son’s Railway Official Guide Book to
Tasmania” replete with terse and reliable information, and the Tasmanian
Government Railway Department issue monthly a “ Railway Pocket Time-
table,” which includes coach connections with the various railway lines.
Leaflets giving details of the districts included in the “Tasmanian Tours”
and tourists’ maps are also obtainable at our principal Australian offices, as
well as at the Tasmanian agencies.
It must be distinctly understood that all quotations for our advertised
Tasmanian tours are subject to any alterations that have occurred since the
date of publication through changes of proprietorship in hotels, or of routes
and fares in steamer or coach services.
Travellers holding through railway tickets (issued in conjunction with
steamer tickets) between Hobart and Launceston, or vice versa , can utilise
-them for the mil portion of tours to the Lakes or East Coast, by having them
endorsed at our Hobart or Launceston agencies for the necessary break of
journey. This affords facilities for visiting the Lakes District, the East
Coast, &c. Heavy baggage may be sent forward to the cloak-room at
either the Launceston or Hobart railway stations, where it is safely stored at
a very small fee per day, which can be learnt from the “ Railway Pocket
Time-table,” obtainable at our principal offices and the railway stations.
