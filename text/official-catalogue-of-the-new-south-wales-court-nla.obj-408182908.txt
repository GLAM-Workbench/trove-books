Photo-skytography. —This is the art of making photo-typographic
blocks for impressing designs in gold, &c., on the backs and
covers of books. The processes employed are either Wood-
burytype, Zincography, or Gillotage.
Photo-engraving. —This art consists in engraving a copper or
steel plate by artificial means. The processes are various.
Sometimes the exposed parts of the plates are bitten in by
liquid acids, at other times the plate is acted on by wet
gelatine reliefs ; and sometimes the engravings are pro-
duced by hydraulic pressure —the gelatine relief being
pressed into a sheet of lead, and the lead electrotyped with
copper, as in the Woodbury process.
The Carbon or Autotype Process. —This is rather a manipulative
than a photo-mechanical process. A paper prepared with
gelatine, bichromate of potassium, and a pigment, is exposed
to light behind a negative ; those portions affected by light
are rendered insoluble, and in the after process of washing
and developing remain and form the picture, which can
then be transferred to glass, papet, canvas, wood, porcelain,,
metal, or other substances. Carbon prints are
and the process is capable of giving the finest results
attainable in photography. Pictures are being perpetuated
by its means. It has many useful adaptations, particularly
that known as the “ Carbon Transparency,” by the aid of
which enlargements can be made giving all the half-tone, and
even adding to the general effect of the original negative.
