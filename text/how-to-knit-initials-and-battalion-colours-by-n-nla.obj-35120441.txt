HOW TO KNIT INITIALS AND
BATTALION COLOURS.
KNITTING initials and battalion
colours into socks is a very
simple operation, and after a little prac-
tice will be found to occupy but a few
extra moments, which may be consider-
ed very well spent when we think how
much pleasure the little individual
touch will give the boys at the front.
The initial is placed near the top of the
sock, about six rows below the ribbing,
and exactly in the centre of the front;
or, if preferred, on the side, at a dis-
tance of twelve or fourteen stitches
from the seam stitch.
One initial will take about half a
yard of wool, and this wool must be
of the same thickness as that with
which the sock is knitted, and of a
colour to contrast well with the latter.




For the rows occupied by the initials,
it is very much better to knit forwards
and backwards in plain and purl alter-
nately, turning at the seam, instead of
going round and round in the usual
way, as by this means the coloured wool
that is being used for the letters is
carried across the space occupied by
the initials only, instead of being car-
ried round the sock.
As soon as the initials are completed,
you resume knitting round and round,
the little opening which is left being
sewn up afterwards.
The wool which is not in use must
be kept "hanging on the inside of the
sock; and when knitting the letters, the
wool which you are not using must be
passed at each stitch over the wool in
use, so that the two may be twined to-
gether, in order to avoid loops of wool
at the back of the work.
With a little practice this will be


found to be quite a simple operation.
Particular care is required, when chang-
ing colours, to pass the wool about to
be used over the wool that is just done
with.
To determine where to begin the ini-
tials, if you desire to place them in the
centre of the front of the sock, count
the number of stitches occupied by the
letters. Subtract that number from the
total number of stitches on the needles,
and divide by two. The number so ob-
tained represents the number of stitches
to be knitted after the seam, before be-
ginning the first initial.
For example: Suppose the initials are
A. B. C., and that there are 56 stitches
on the needles. Including the space
between the letters, they occupy 22
stitches. Twenty-two stitches from 56
is 34, half of that is 17; so that the
initials will begin with the 18th stitch.
It is a good plan to weave in the


coloured wool some six or eight stitches
before commencing the initial, by pass-
ing it at each stitch over the wool with
which you are knitting, being careful
to keep it at the back of the work.
After the initials are completed, fin-
ish off the wool in the same way and
cut off the ends. The illustrations
show two complete alphabets—capitals
and small letters —so that either ini-
tials, or a complete name, may be
knitted.
Before beginning to knit the initials
or name, mark them out on a piece of
squared paper, making a dot or cross
for each stitch, as in the diagrams,
and leaving one or two spaces between
each letter. Follow this diagram when
knitting the initials, but remember to
read it first from left to right, and then
from right to left, as you knit and purl
alternately.








Battalion and Regimental Colours.
The diagrams given show the various
designs worn by the different units —
crosses and dots being used to repre-
sent the colour scheme. It is supposed
that wheeling or double knitting wool
is used. For thinner wool the designs
hust be slightly enlarged, in order to
ie effective.
The general directions given above
for initials, are to be followed when
knitting the colours.
