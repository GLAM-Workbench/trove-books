ROCKDALE COLLEGE
A High-Class Day and Boarding School for Boys-
Telephone, 49 Kogarah. Established Seven Years.
The College is charmingly situated in its own Park grounds on the Heights of Rockdale. There are
magnificent Views of Lady Robinson’s Beach, Sans Souci, Botany Bay, the Heads and the broad expanse of
the ocean. All subjects taught by experienced Masters. Boys have Individual teaching, with kind, firm
discipline. Many boys have suffered through life for the want of education. As Shakespeare says—
“ Education is the best Investment of Life.” In the Elizabethan period many speeches in Latin and Greek
were delivered by the Literati; but in an Up-to-Date School these subjects give place to a “Modern Educa-
tion.” Most boys at College waste their time on Latin, Greek and French, which should be devoted to an
English Education, and proper training for a business life. More good would result from the study of Correct
Reading, Writing, Spelling, Business Arithmetic, Shorthand, Book-keeping, Typewriting, &c. TERMS —
Boarders, from £9 9s. per quarter of Eleven Weeks from date of entrance. Day Pupils, from £2 2s. per
quarter.

This Company was awarded FIRST PRIZE for all Exhibits.
Sydney Morning Herald , April sth, 1899.
AN INTERESTING EXHIBITION
was one made by the Acetylene Gas Company of Australasia, Limited. The exhibit consisted
of a 1 wo-roomed pavilion, handsomely furnished by Messrs. David Jones and Co, as dining and
drawing rooms, in which Acetylene Gas was burning under household conditions. The light
was much admired by those who visited the pavilion, the manufacture of the gas outside also
proving of interest. Bicycle, carriage, and table lamps and other acetylene apparatus were
also exhibited. The company was awaided a first prize.
Star, April 4th, 1899.
Amongst the most interesting of exhibits is that of the Acetylene Gas Co of Australasia,
Limited, of 86 Pitt-street. This company has erected a large pavilion, which is divided into
dining room and drawing-room,jj tastefully furnished by D. Jones and Co. In these rooms
the Acetylene Gas is seen burning under ordinary household conditions. The light is very
brilliant this being more noticeable as the days draw in and the light outside grows dimmer.
It is a very white light, and pleasing to the eye. Its effect oh the delicate draperies of the
furniture is specially noteworthy, the tints remaining the same under the artificial as under the
day light. At one end of the building is a generator, and the simplicity of its working was
demonstrated by the fact that the generator was, in many instances, charged by the little
children accompanying the visitors. In point of fact, it is a matter of dropping a piece of the
carbide into water. Ordinary gas fittings are suitable to the new illuminant, which is rapidly
becoming a formidable rival to coal, gas, and even electric light.

il WII7 is it that snow keeps people
warmT as we read in the accounts of
arctic explorations. The reason is that
snow is a very bad conductor of heat,
and, as it allows none of the natural
warmth of the body to escape, the person
entombed is na urally kept warm There
are some well-authe ticated cases 01
persons having been overtaken by a snow-
storm and completely buried by the
flakes. They have lain under what one
would n turally suppose to be this very
cold covering for six or seven days, and
have at last been disentombed and found
little the worse. Hunger is more to be
dreaded than cold in .-uch cases.
The manager of an asylum for the
deaf and dumb publicly tried an exp eri-
ment upon a number of patients with the
phonograph recently. Out of 27 boys
and 29 girl , all except 8 were able to
hear the phonograph. This will probably
lead to a revolution in deaf institutions.
The theory is that the inner ear is
sensitive, though the drum may be
destroyed.

INDIAN ROOT PILLS
CURE
Sick Livers, Sick Kidneys & Female Ailments
A VICTIM TO THE KMIFE.
Mrs. Lang’s Torriblo Condition—Three Leading Specialists for Female Ailnunts
Baffled—Hospitals Fail—The Surgeon’s Knife adds to
Dr. Morse's Indian Boot Pills Cure Her Permanently
and Complete.y
Miracles have been chronicled of the past, and
it does not appear as if the word fits into our
present-day vocabulary ; but no other word can
properly express the marve'Jous recovery (f
Mrs. Lfcng, 16 Little Albion Street, Surry Hills,
Sydney : —“ I had quite made up my mind that
I would die,” said Mrs. Lang to a reporter, who
had been railed to investigate her astonishing
cure. “ I had undergone operation after
operation, each of which would only give me
slight relief from my dreadful sufferings. In
fact, the agony which I endured seemed more
than any human being could live under, and
yet, somehow, I held unto life when death would
have been a blessing.
, B
“ Had you seen me at that time you would
have taken me for a Chinese, my skin was so
yellow. Only I had not the almond eyes,
many Chinese wmuld have looked Europeans
beside me. The complaint I suffered from lasted
eight years, and they were the most wretched 'll'rr-
years a mortal ever lived through, if I can give / '
the name of living to such an existence. 1 , ///7/f^

had been on the operating table in the hospital ' /
more than once, and under the treatment ( f
three of the best specialists for female ailments in the city, and there were silver tubes inserted
in my body to carry off the matter which the ailment created. 1 was growing weaker and more
hopeless every day, and was thoroughly resigned to my end, only it seemed too slow in coming.
“ But I was not yet to die. It seemed by the merest chance that my life was saved. I
had been taken home from the hospital by my husband in a cab, and was in such torture that
I lay on the floor of the cab with my head on the seat. From there he was breed to carry me
upstairs and downstairs, as I could not walk. While lying on the sofa one afternoon a little
book was thrown in through the open door. My husband picked it up and read of the astonish-
ing cures Dr. Morse’.i Indian Root Pills had made. He carefully read it through, and was so
much impressed by what he read that he urged I should try them as a last hope. At first
I scorned the idea that any medicine could accomplish what leading doctors and the hospitals
had utterly failed to do, but at last I acted on his advice and tried Dr. Morse’s Indian Boot
Pills.”
Ift.
/
At this stage Mrs. Lang produced her photo, taken when her friends thought she was
dying. It was the picture of a women with a drawn face and the expression of intense suffering.
Bhe then said : “ The difference you see between that photo and the perfect specimen of health
and strength which you now see before you is solely due to the use of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. I will now tell you how they acted. The first few doses caused the removal of more
than a dipper full of corrupt matter which all the doctors and medicines had failed to expel,
but the Pills went quietly and painlessly to work, and cleared my system of the impurities, and
I began to mend rapidly. My appetite is now 7 splendid, and I gained twenty-eight pounds in
three months after starting the use of the pills. I suppose I had been attended by at least half
a dozen doctors during my illness, besides trying all the patent medicines that I thought would
help me ; in fact, I spent nearly half a fortune in trying to be cured. A few bottles of the
pills have caused a complete cure in my case, when you might say that death was staring me.
You are at liberty to make the facts known, and I will gladly endorse my statements if anyone
doubting will call on me. I consider it my duty to make the facts known. I am in perfect
health, and can walk any distance, thanks to Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, as they alone have
saved my life.”

THE WINGS OE THE MORNING.
The Nobbier that’s Never Resisted.
There s a nobbier that’s never resisted, This Spirit they ne’er can be scorning,
It carries no headache’s distress, Who for excellence wait on the watch
But poured from a thousand decanters, As it comes on the .wings of the morning’
