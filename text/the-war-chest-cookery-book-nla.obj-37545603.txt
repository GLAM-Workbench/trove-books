FOREWORD
Lsr compiling this book of tried recipes it is with the
sincere wish of substantially augmenting the funds of
the War Chest, whose object is to help our fighting
men who have gone out in defence of their country
and are suffering and enduring so nobly all the hard-
ships incidental to this terrible war.
The compiler wishes to sincerely thank all who have
so generously contributed recipes and otherwise assisted
in supplying the material and advertisements for this
book, and it is felt that a double object will be attained,
in that while the proceeds of sale will be devoted to
helping our' men, the recipes, being both practical and
economical, will be an acquisition to the purchasers.
A generous support is asked for the cause set forth
above, and it is felt the appeal will not be in vain.
THE COMPILER.
OUR ADVERTISERS.
Tiie Citizens’ War Chest Fund wish to express their
whole-hearted appreciation of the co-operation of the
Advertisers in this book, all of whom most willingly
responded to our financial appeal, and I would specially
ask the ladies interested in bur movement to repay our
Advertisers for their co-operation as much as possible
by purchasing the advertised articles.

MISCELLANEOUS
HINTS FOR JAM-MAKING.
Thoroughly., .wash two half-crowns and put them in
the preserving pan with the jam; they will move about
and thus prevent the jam from burning.
PEELING ONIONS.
If when peeling onions they are held under running
water it prevents any of the unpleasant effects.
HAND EMOLLIENT.
Equal parts of lemon juice, glycerine, rose water;
rub a little well into the skin after washing and before
drying the hands. It keeps them beautifully soft.
TO REPAIR ALUMINIUM OR COPPER VESSELS.
Small holes or open seams may be stopped by a
composition made of glycerine and litharge; mix to-
gether into a stiff paste, apply to the hole, and let it
thoroughly dry.
NOTE.—The sender of this has a copper in which the seams
opened, and being unable at the time to get a brazier, the seams
were stuffed with this, and it is still in use after more, than eighteen
years. The cost is infinitesimal.
Anon., Killara.
TEST FOR A DAMP BED.
To test whether a bed is damp or not, place a hand-
mirror between the sheets for five minutes. If it is at
all blurred or misty the bed is damp.
CURE FOR HICCOUGH.

SOUPS
The value of soup as a food is considerable; when
taken at the beginning of a meal it acts as a digestive.
It is stimulating and revives a tired person. It is also
a good form in which to take liquid food, as it contains
so many good properties. The lime extracted from the
bones gives solidity to our bones. Vegetables in the
soup supply the mineral salts necessary to keep our
blood healthy.
Grain used, such as barley, rice, lentils, etc. are
most nourishing, and when thoroughly cooked are easily
digested.
Water in which potatoes, parsnips and idee has been
cooked should never be wasted ; it serves as a very good
foundation for soup.
Stock forms the foundation of most soups. Fresh
meat and bones need not necessarily be used, as good,
wholesome stock may be made from any cold meat and
bones or remains of joints. This is called “second”
stock, “first” stock being made from fresh meat, but
it needs the addition of some strong flavouring, such
as tomatoes, bacon rind or bone, etc.
All meat must be cut into small pieces and bones
must be broken up.
Allow 1 pint water to each lb. of bones, or pint over
(to allow for evaporation); simmer slowly, not boil, for
three or four hours.
Use beef bones for dark stock; veal, rabbit or chicken
bones for white stock. Fish stock is made in a similar
manner, using fish bones and necessary flavourings.

CAKES
Essentials in successful cake-making' are: —Thorough
mixing of ingredients, sugar must be worked until it is
dissolved; either the butter and sugar must be well
creamed before adding the other ingredients, or, in the
lighter sponge cakes, the eggs and sugar must be
thoroughly whipped. After the flour and baking powder
have been added the cake must go into the oven as soon
as possible.
Another essential is the heat of the oven. To
thoroughly heat the oven, light the gas ten minutes be-
t'>re putting in the cake; it is best to test the heat by
the thermometer, which should be about 120°. A simpler
method of testing is by sprinkling a little flour on the
-hell ; it it scorches at once the oven is too hot, if long
in browning the oven is too slow. But after a little
practice it may be judged by placing the hand in for a
M'ciind or two. After putting the cake in the oven the
- ns 111 u> t be turned half down and kept at an even

Jelly Sandwiches.
1 quantity fondant, 1 quantity French jelly.
Set a small quantity of French jelly mixture in a
damp soup plate, having previously coloured the jelly
deep pink. Roll out half the fondant to the same size
as the jelly; lay the jelly on top and cover with the
remainder of fondant x'olled to same size and shape;

Nut Slices.
J /2 lb. fondant, 2or 3 ozs. mixed nuts (chopped), car-

to form a long sausage-shaped roll; colour remainder
of fondant pale pink and coat the nut roll. Cut in
slices.
Peanut Brittle.
Place 1 lb. sugar in wide enamel-lined saucepan over
low gas, stir constantly and gradually increase heat
till sugar has melted; add prepared peanuts when sugar

break into small pieces. To prepare peanuts, shell
about 1 cup peanuts, also removing outer brown
skin, chop and place in enamel plate, sprinkle a little
salt and stand in hot part of stove. Put a small piece
butter in each tin, melt and stand in hot part of stove
ready for the mixture. The success of this brittle
depends largely on having the dishes and nuts really hot
and in pouring out the mixture immediately the nuts
are added.
Penucha.
Make as Fudge, but brown sugar is used in place of
white, and chopped walnuts instead of chocolate.

ICES
To freeze puddings and ices it is necessary to have
a freezer. A large and thick bag is needed (to hold
the ice while breaking it) and a wooden mallet. The
ice is put in the bag ahd laid on a stone floor or some
solid cool place, and the ice is broken up finely. To
three parts of ice add one part of coarse salt. The
dasher is put in the can, which is then covered and
put in place and the ice and salt packed closely around.
When the can is chilled pour in the ingredients
and cover. Keep the can well covered with ice and
salt, then place the bag on top and turn the handle for
ten to fifteen minutes, slowly at first and faster as it
begins to freeze. When frozen remove the dasher,
cover with ice and salt, drain off water; then place the
bag over all and let stand for an hour or more.
A teaspoonful of lemon juice added to the various
fruit ices is an improvement and helps to bring out
the flavour.
Frozen Water-Melon Punch or Ice
(American recipe).
1 quart of water-melon juice, 1 cup powdered sugar,
y A cup lemon juice.
Chop the centre of a thoroughly-ripe water-melon and

juice add sugar and lemon juice and freeze. Pack ice
and salt in freezer; when the inside can is cold adjust

(made by boiling slowly together 3 lbs. sugar and 2 1 /2
pints water) ; cook for five minutes, then strain and
bottle f(?r use.

then rub through sieve. Mix the fruit juice and syrup
well together and then freeze.

When it comes to the boil add pepper and salt to taste,
let it boil gently for about ten minutes. Pour into a
basin, holding the meat back with a spoon. Do not
strain through a sieve.
If your patient is convalescent, sago added to the
beef tea gives a good thick broth. For the above
quantity soak y 2 a cup sago one hour. Turn the beef
tea back into the saucepan after it is strained, add the
sago and stir until it clears and thickens (about ten
minutes).
Mutton Broth.

aluminium stewpan, salt it and turn in the celery and
onion (sliced) and boil gently till tender (about one-
and-a-half hours). Make a white sauce with the
butter, flour and milk, adding some water if too thick;
turn the sauce into the stewpan in which the celery is
boiling, stirring all the'time until it is well blended;
flavour with pepper and salt, then serve. The soup

Barley Water.
2 ozs. pearl barley, 1 quart water, strip of lemon
rind, pinch of salt, sugar to taste.

this were not done the barley water would have a
dark-coloured unpleasant appeax’ance. Put the barley
in a saucepan with a quart of water and strip of lemon
peel and boil gently for two hours. Strain and sweeten
to taste. This is a very nutritious beverage and can
be used either hot or cold. It is sometimes varied by

salt.
Beat the egg well, flavour with pepper and salt and
add the beef tea. Pour into a buttered cup, cover

ABBOTSLEIGH
WAHROONGA
Prineipal: MISS MARGARET E. MURRAY, M.A.
Situated at a height of about seven
hundred feet above sea-level, in the
picturesque suburb of Wahroonga,
Abbotsleigh offers every advantage, both
climatic and educational. The teaching
staff is a large one and includes several
graduates. Great attention is paid to the
physical well-being of the girls, and no
effort is spared to maintain a rigorous,
thoughtful and morally healthful tone
throughout the school.


SWEETS, &c.
Batter Pudding
(For one).
1 egg, 1 dessertspoonful flour, 1 gill milk, salt.
Put the egg in a basin and beat well, sift the flour,
turn on to the egg and mix well with a wooden spoon;
add a pinch of salt and then the milk, beating well.
Let the batter stand for thirty minutes. Butter a cup
and pour in the batter, cover with buttered paper and
steam for twenty minutes (or until set). Turn on to
a hot plate, sprinkle with sugar and squeeze lemon juice
over and serve hot.
Baked Apples.
. core your apples and set in a casserole or
pie dish; cover the latter with buttered paper or another
pie dish (this is to keep the apples from discolouring);
pour over the apples before covering some water, sugar,
juice of % lemon and 2 or 3 strips of lemon peel
Cook till tender, but do not let them break up; when
cold serve in a glass dish with whipped cream, baked
or boiled custard. If cooked for a longer time they
break up like stewed apples, but have a more delicious
flavour than when cooked in a stewpan and are a better
colour.
Boiled Custard
3 or 4 eggs, 1 quart milk, 1 tablespoonful cornflour,
essence of vanilla or strip of lemon peel, 3 tablespoon-
fuls sugar.

MOBLEY JOHNSON’S, 546 George Street.


Break the eggs into a basin and beat well, then mix
in the sugar and milk; pour into a jug and stand in a
saucepan of water (or use a double boiler). Put on
the fire and stir occasionally; when the water in the
saucepan boils add the cornflour (which has been
diluted with a little cold milk) and stir till it thickens.
Remove from the fire, add the flavouring and stand the
jug in a basin of cold water till the custard is cool;
pour into a glass dish (or custard glasses) and grate
nutmeg over if desired. If lemon peel is used for
flavouring instead of vanilla put in the custard before
you begin to cook it and remove before the thickening
is added.
Steamed Custard
(For one).
1 egg, 1 dessertspoonful sugar, enough milk to fill
cup.
Beat the egg well, then add the sugar and beat well,
then the milk; pour into a buttered cup, cover with
buttered paper and steam till set (about thirty minutes).
Baked Custard.
3 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, V/z pints milk.
Do not make a custard in a very large dish. Beat
the eggs well, then beat in the sugar, then the milk and
flavouring. Stand the pie dish in a tin baking dish
and cook in a moderate oven. Custard is spoilt if it
boils; when it gets hot pour water into the baking dish
and this will allow the custard to go on cooking slowly
till set. Stand away till cold and serve with stewed
fruit. Time, about one-and-a-half-hours.

Stewed Fruit.
Most fruit is stewed in the same way. The rule is
to cook till tender, but do not let it break or its appear-
ance will be spoilt. Peel the fruit and either cook
whole, or fruit like pears can be halved and the core
removed. Make a syrup, using 1 lb. of sugar, 1 pint
of water, juice of y 2 lemon, 2 or 3 strips lemon rind.
Bring to the boil and boil for ten minutes, then put
in the fruit and simmer till tender. Cook for a few
minutes with the lid off to improve the colour.
Cup of Arrowroot or Cornflour.
Put a small dessertspoonful of arrowroot or corn-
flour in a basin and mix with a little water. Have a
cupful of boiling water in a small saucepan, stir in the
cornflour or arrowroot, add a pinch of salt and boil
for two or three minutes, stirring all the time. Sweeten
to taste and serve plain, or with a little milk. If thin
arrowroot is wanted use only 1 teaspoonful.
Cup of Sago.
Wash a tablespoonful sago and let it soak for half-
an-hour. Have V 2 pint boiling water in a saucepan,
stir in the sago and stir till it thickens (about ten
minutes); add a pinch of salt. Serve with milk and.
sugar.
Junket.
Dissolve 1 Rennet tablet in a wineglassful of water;
put 1 quart of milk and two tablespoonfuls of sugar
into a saucepan and warm to blood heat; add flavouring,
then stir in the dissolved tablet. Mix and pour into a
glass dish; stand in a warm place to set. Will be
