FOREWORD,
The control of noxious weeds is the duty of every occupier of land.
It is a duty the farmer owes not only to himself but to his neighbour
and to the State, and it is with the object of assisting him in the
discharge of this obligation that this handbook has been compiled.
The information it contains is based on many years of detailed experi-
ment. Any further information which may be required may be
obtained on application to the Department.
The issue of this second booklet on weed control, which may be
described as a revised (and considerably enlarged) edition of that
published in 1935 under the title ?Know Your Weeds,? is made
possible by the co-operation of the Rural Bank of New South Wales,
which undertook to defray the major portion of the cost of publication
as a gesture of its practical interest in the problems confronting the
man on the land. The wide demand for the previous edition is evidence
of the growing consciousness of farmers of the seriousness of the
problem weeds present, and the timeliness of a more complete state-
ment on the subject.

CONTROL OF WEEDS
INTRODUCTION.
The majority of weeds established in this country have come from
overseas. A close study of the question will reveal also that in many
cases conditions have been provided for a rapid extension of the weeds
when they arrived. This statement is supported by the fact that our
native weeds such as Galvanised Burr have also responded to our sys-
tems of land treatment and spread rapidly since the commencement
of land settlement.
Land was first cleared of the natural vigorous and strong growing
timber which had excluded the weed types by competition after many
decades. The grazier?s ambition was to replace this timber with pay-
able stock fodder, and where the stocking has been in proportion to the
amount of grass that the land could produce the result has been satis-
factory. However, over wide areas the stocking has been heavy, and.
although a profit has been shown, after many years the balance of
species has been lost. When the herbage cover begins to thin out, nature
appears to step in and assert that the land shall not be left bare of plant
life. It is then that the hardy and poorer types of weeds appear, and
after having had a continuous fight against man for many hundreds of
years they are well fitted with characters which enable them to be quickly
established when their chance arrives. When this stage in land tenure is
reached weeds can often be said to be providing a definite .service, in
that by maintaining a herbage cover on the soil surface they are pre-
venting surface erosion.
In agricultural districts farmers did not wait for the country to grass
up but immediately commenced to break the soil with the plough in
order to produce heavy yields of remunerative crops. A district?s
capacity to grow certain crops for possible future markets is soon
established, and this fact soon determines the practice, or often the
fashion, in the agricultural belt. The soils being fertile and markets
good, the system of specialised cropping has become very popular, and
very little thought has been given over wide areas to the inevitable
result of this cropping practice.
Specialised cropping leaves the door open to weed invasion of a
serious nature ?that of deep-rooted perennial weeds. First, owing to
crop production at a maximum rate, soil fertility is diminished and the
crop vigour is reduced. This reduces the ability of the crops to com-
pete with weeds, which quickly take advantage of these conditions and
become firmly established in soils of a wide range of fertility. For this
reason the statement that weeds are closely linked with loss of fertility
is verv often true.


The continued growing of one crop which occupies the land during
the same months every year allows weeds of the same seasonal growth
to mature and spread seeds without interference from grazing stock
or cultural implements. The spread of these weeds to the point when
they become serious or major problems sometimes takes many years,
but at times a vigorous weed will spread many hundreds of miles
when the farming is being conducted on lines congenial to its growth.
Actually in this State the permanent flora or plant life is slowly but
surely changing. The better class shrubs and trees are being replaced
by non-edible scrub in the far west, while perennial weeds are causing
a halt in specialised cropping in agricultural belts and emphasising the
need for its review. On the mountains and tableland areas rabbits have
helped to overstock many properties, and weeds are replacing better
grass species.
The coastal areas, although not without weed problems, have been
protected in a most efficient manner by the establishment of paspalum.
This grass quickly followed the ringing of timber, providing over many
districts a weed-proof land cover.
The large areas per man in this country do not permit of weeds
being dealt with by such methods as hand cutting, which makes even
more dangerous the practice of using land without thought to weed
invasion. Such sound systems of agriculture as rotation of crops, rota-
tion of grazing, correct use of stock, periodical building up of fertilit) r
by close pastures, and ample use of fertilisers are all proved weed
preventives. The application of these principles is discussed in the
following pages, and landholders are urged to consider weed control
especially from this angle; for it is by preventive measures largely
that we may best deal with this problem and maintain the fertility and
productive power of our soils.
Losses Caused by Weeds.
The annual toll taken by weeds is a very considerable one, and especi-
ally in this State, where agricultural systems have never been seriously
considered to include control of possibly seriously detrimental plants.
Areas per man are large, and this, coupled with very suitable soils and
climatic conditions, has caused large losses to the agricultural industry
in recent years.
Weeds cause losses in many ways
(i) They reduce land values.
(2) They compete seriously with crops for available plant food,
moisture and light.
(3) They increase the cost of production by necessitating extra
work and cultivation.
(4) They lower the quality of agricultural produce and increase
costs of preparing the products for market.
(5) They harbour insect pests and fungous diseases of economic
crops.
(6) Certain weeds are poisonous.


Reduction of Land Values.
The invasion and establishment of the more serious weeds often
causes sharp declines in land values. This reduction is not the result
of panic, but is carefully estimated by landholders from the
viewpoint of reclaiming the land on a profitable basis. In the southern
districts of New South Wales during recent years the invasion of a
perennial weed has caused a huge drop in land values, which was re-
flected right throughout southern business. This reduction was based
on the estimated cost of re-fencing the property for grazing purposes,
extending the water supply, laying down competing pastures, and
extra expenditure on seed, fertiliser, fodder reserves and stock. The
final figure must be such as will allow a profit on the estimated produc-
tion of the land when reclaimed.
All purchasers of properties allow a margin for cost of reducing weed
growth, and the establishment of weeds is therefore generally reflected
ultimately in land values.
Competition with Crops.
A very heavy loss results from the competition of weeds with agri-
cultural crops and grassland. The fertility of soils is very limited,
and when the available plant food and moisture are shared with weeds,
crop yields suffer.
Skeleton Weed?A Serious Competitor with Cultivated Crops.
Moisture is the governing factor over most of our agricultural land,
and poor yields are very common owing to the available moisture
being exhausted before the crop matures. On irrigated land com-
petition may be keener for plant food than water, but the effect is just
as serious. In the case of deep-rooted perennial types of weeds,
only deeper rooted kinds of crops are able to compete successfully,
which restricts the choice to a very small number.


Increased Cost of Production.
The cost (in labour and the necessary machinery) of fallow culti-
vation is a charge on production largely necessitated by weeds, for
an important aim of the preparation of fallows is the eradication of
weeds before the crop is sown. After-cultivation in row crops and
outlay on destructive sprays are further examples of weed costs.
In pastoral areas considerable amounts are expended on labour to
cut burrs and other noxious weeds. The cutting of weeds in ditches,
on railways, roads and private land involves a large annual expenditure.
Reduction of Quality of Produce.
Weed contamination of many crops reduces their quality and market
value. This applies especially to wheat grain and to hay, both lucerne
and cereal. The percentage of weed seeds such as wild oats in wheat
and the consequent depreciation is allowed for by buyers, the cleaning
processes necessitating extra handling charges and machinery.
The inclusion of weed seeds in agricultural seeds is a very serious
fault and calls for no further comment.
The presence of burr and other weed seeds in wool adds to the hand-
ling charges and cost of preparing the marketable product. The dairy
industry, too, is constantly fighting weeds that cause a taint in dairy
products. While the technique of manufacture has been considerably
improved and some taints can be eliminated, a few of the more
serious ones still cause large quantities of dairy products to be sold
as low grade.
Harbour for Pests and Diseases.
Many insect pests and fungous diseases of economic crops are shel-
tered by weeds. The control of these pests and diseases is thus made
more difficult, the harbour afforded by the weeds facilitating their
propagation and resulting in a carry-over from year to year.
Poisonous Plants.
Certain weeds are very poisonous when eaten by stock, while others
not quite so harmful cause severe irritation and dietetic troubles.
Poisonous weeds are not often eaten readily, but in this State the move-
ment of large numbers of stock is considerable and often the stock
are in a low condition. These travelling stock when hungry will
eat such plants with severe losses.
Such plants as St. John?s Wort cause severe skin irritation to white
or pink skinned animals, while Darling Pea has a characteristic drug-
like effect on stock that become attracted by its peculiar taste.
Life Period in Relation to Control.
The term ?weed? is generally applied to any plant that persists on
land and the pernicious characters of which outnumber any good
points it may possess. Such detrimental plants tend to grow where
not wanted, resist severe droughts, thrive under a great range of soil


and climatic conditions, and possess an extraordinary capacity for
propagation, enabling them to multiply rapidly. A weed of agricul-
tural land is rarely a trouble on grassland and vice versa, while very
few weeds possess sufficient ability to invade a vigorous, established
and well managed pasture. Later in this publication weeds have been
grouped according to the class of land (pasture, etc.) of which they
are primarily a pest, and a special section has been devoted to aquatic
or water loving weeds.
The methods used in controlling any weed must be related to its
habits of growth and reproduction. Since these vary with different
weeds, control measures also differ widely. The first consideration
must always be the natural life period, and weeds may be classed
roughly as (i) annuals, (2) biennials, and (3) perennials.
(1) Annuals.
Weeds in this class grow for one year only, produce seed and then die
entirely. Annuals are spread by seeds only. All methods of control
must have one object ?prevention of seed formation, which may be
effected by cutting, cultivating, burning, spraying or mowing at a suit-
able stage. Destruction of all annuals should be carried out as early
as possible, as when very young they are more easily destroyed.
The seeds of these annuals, as well as of other weeds, can lie dor-
mant in the soil for many years awaiting suitable conditions for
germination. A case of this nature is the common Wild Oat, which
if turned under deeply with a plough will survive for a great number
of years and when returned near the surface germinate without loss
of vigour.
Summer annuals or weeds which germinate in the spring are gener-
ally easier to destroy by cultivation during hot, dry weather, but
winter annuals are often favoured by cool and rainy weather allowing
the roots to again get a hold after cultivation.
Some annuals, such as Saffron Thistle and Wild Lettuce, if mowed
too early will re-grow and set seed. Careful selection of time of
mowing is necessary, and it is generally best to do it when the flowers
begin to open.
(2) Biennials.
Biennials live for two years and rarely set seed until the second
year. There are very few weeds in this group in New South Wales
and they are generally regarded as annuals from the point of view
of control. The same eradication methods should be employed as for
annuals and the weeds destroyed before they set seed.
(3) Perennials.
1 his group comprises the more serious type of weeds from the
point of view of control. Perennial weeds possess the ability to live
three years or more; they call for very specialised seed control meas-
uies, and are very difficult to eradicate. During recent years there


has been a serious invasion of this type of weed, which includes Skele-
ton Weed, Hoary Cress, Convolvulus, Johnson Grass, Nut Grass, Cape
Tulip and Canada Thistle.
The ordinary type of perennial spreads by seed, unless disturbed
by cutting- or cultivation, when, if soil moisture conditions are suit-
able, it will grow from root cuttings. Creeping perennials reproduce
by means of creeping underground stems as well as seed, and are a
difficult group to manage. Johnson Grass, Hoary Cress and Canada
Thistle are good examples of this group. Perennials that reproduce
by bulbs as well as by seed are easily scattered by cultivation.
The control of perennial weeds demands first and foremost pre-
vention of seeding, followed by attention to the system of farming or
?land use,? and in the case of small infestations the use of chemicals.
These subjects will be discussed fully in later sections.
How Weeds are Spread.
Many species of weeds seem to be fitted with devices specially
designed to enable the spread and reproduction of the type in the face
of much opposition. Some (such as the thistles) have parachute
arrangements on the seeds, others hairs, others again wing-like struc-
tures, all of which enable the seed to be distributed over a large area
by the wind. Some weeds have seeds so small that they are carried
by the wind without any of these helps, and yet others have seeds
that are rolled along the ground for considerable distances by the wind.
Weed seeds are remarkable, too, for their hardiness and vitality,
being capable of germination under conditions that would not suit
more useful species of plants; in many cases, as stated previously, they
are capable of remaining dormant in the soil for long periods, to
germinate when more favourable conditions result from cultural or
other action.
Despite a very rigorous system of quarantine, weeds continue to find
a way into this country, which was once practically free. It was neces-
sary in past years to import fodder from overseas, and this was un-
doubtedly a prolific source of supply. The distribution and sale of
impure seed and fodder is a serious factor in the spread of seed of
weeds. The extensive movements of sheep because of seasonal con-
ditions also operate constantly in this way: this particularly applies to
burrs such as Galvanised, Bathurst and Noogoora Burr. Cultivation
spreads creeping and bulbous perennials. Our various transport sys-
tems, although a great asset, are proving also great weed spreaders.
Such natural agencies as wind, water, animals and birds, of course,
always provide ample service as carriers of weed seeds.
The point to be realised, however, is that all weeds require special
conditions if they are to thrive. Such conditions are due to two main
causes:
(a) Depletion of grass cover. This may be caused by over-stock-
ing, rabbits and bad management.
( b ) Specialised cropping?that is, growing the same crop in suc-
cession for a great many years, thus providing ideal condi-
tions for certain weeds.
These two factors should be studied by every landowner as explain-
ing the thriving on his property of practically any weed.


Methods of Controlling Weeds.
Once some species of weeds become firmly established, eradication
is practically impossible; effective control of these is only possible
before they obtain a hold. Where weeds have taken possession and
landowners realise that cutting is impracticable they look with hope to
the use of chemicals as a means of destruction; but the question of cost
must be considered, and though chemicals have been found to be effec-
tive in destroying weeds, the cost is often prohibitive where the land
is badly infested.
Following a large amount of research work the problem is now being
attacked from the control point of view in the case of serious weeds,
which has meant a revision of a large proportion of our farming prac-
tices or habits.
Rotation of Crops.
Certain species of weeds are continuously associated with a particu-
lar crop, mafnly because cultural operations for the production of that
crop are such as allow the weed to mature without any serious hin-
drance. A rotation of crops, including a temporary pasture, must even-
tually be adopted if our soils are to be kept free of the serious peren-
nial weeds. Such rotations, of course, have other important benefits,
and their possibilities from the financial aspect have been considerably
improved by the wide increase in the zone proved suitable for grazing
lucerne, which plant must in future be regarded as the ?king of weed
killers.?
Lucerne?Enemy of All Weeds.
The most notable discovery in recent years with respect to weed con-
trol has been the fact that lucerne is sufficiently vigorous to compete
with and dominate practically all our serious weeds. Cultivation of this
valuable grazing crop has been extended to the dry areas with great
success, and large areas of grazing lucerne can be seen which have
cleaned the soil of Hoary Cress, Skeleton Weed, burrs, thistles, and
other common weed types.
In the north-west, on properties being worked on a share-farming
basis, the practice of sowing down portion of the farm each year,
using wheat as a cover crop, is becoming very popular. Wheat in the
south-west has received a great impetus through the success of lucerne
on Skeleton Weed country, and many acres of fertile country have
been reclaimed in this way. On the coast the crop is being used with
success on Nut Grass infested land.
It has been claimed that lucerne does not completely eradicate some
perennial weeds. While this is true, the weeds have no ill effect on
the lucerne, which is sufficiently strong to reduce the weed, allowing
profitable cultivated crops to be taken off the land for a further period.

Improvement of Pastures.
As pointed out previously, weeds require special conditions, such as.
poor herbage cover, if they are to thrive. Well managed vigorous pas-
tures smother weeds to a point where they are not the dominant species..
The most successful smothering plants in the more favourable dis-
tricts have been subterranean clover and perennial rye, while Wim-
mera rye grass and lucerne are proving an excellent combination in.
the drier portions, provided the lucerne is established first.
It is not only necessary to sow these smothering pastures, but the
pasture when established must be carefully stocked and renovated to
maintain its vigour. There is a large area of the tableland portion of
this State that can be profitably put down to permanent pasture. In
this condition land becomes weed-proof, and it would then be unneces-
sary to take special expensive steps to clear rough adjoining land of
weeds.
Chopping up Weeds with a Rotary Hoe
Cutting and Cultivation.
An enormous amount of cultivation is carried out annually for
destruction of weeds and for the annual type on arable land this is
most economic. Hoeing and mattocking of weeds in grassland is the
most efficient method of cutting established weeds, but this process does
not go far enough in that no stop is placed on germination of the seed.
While hoeing and cutting should be continued, landholders should at
the same time give some thought to improving the grass cover to pre-
vent further germination. In the dry far western districts such
measures as better subdivision and provision of better water supplies,
rotational grazing and the use of small numbers of cattle should be
combined with any cutting of weeds.


The mowing machine has great prospects and is likely to be used
increasingly to prevent seed formation. The mowing of Skeleton Weed
infested wheat stubble immediately after harvesting will probably
replace stubble burning. This encourages the stock to travel evenly
and graze weeds closely and effectively.
Mowing Skeleton "Weed Infested Wheat Stubble.
Control of Rabbits.
This pest reduces seriously the ground cover so essential to keep-
ing weeds out. Weeds such as Stinkwort and Wild Tobacco are gener-
ally associated with heavy rabbit infestation, though it can be said that
in some areas these weeds are providing a service in preventing surface
erosion. In any scheme of weed control all rabbits should be first
removed and the grass allowed to reach a normal density. This is
especially necessary in Bracken Fern country which it is intended to
reclaim with pastures.
Chemical Weed Killers.
Great progress has been made in the use of chemical weed killers,
concerning which the following information should be helpful. Chemi-
cals are costly when applied over large areas, but for small outbreaks
of serious weeds and for perennials such as Blackberry, chemicals are
most effective. Special problems, such as weed control on railways,
roads, pathways, etc., also offer a good field for chemical weed killers.
The following chemical treatments are being used with success in
this State:?
(a) Contact Sprays. ?These preparations kill only the plant tissue
to which they are applied, and include sulphuric acid, dilute
chlorates and dilute arsenical sprays.
(b) Penetrating Sprays. ?These sprays affect the plant tissue
upon which they are sprayed, and also slowly penetrate into
the root system, and are of special value in the case of weeds
such as Blackberry and perennial weeds. Suitable climatic

conditions are required for good results, and these are diffi-
cult to obtain in the western wheat belt, where much was
expected from the use of sodium chlorate on Skeleton Weed.
The chemicals used for this work are arsenic pentoxide and
sodium chlorate.
(c) Temporary Soil Sterilisers. ?These are being used extensively
in the western agricultural belt for the complete eradication of
new outbreaks of serious weeds. A heavy application of
sodium chlorate either dry or in solution is a common method,
and so also is a heavy application of common coarse salt. It
is preferable to use a very dilute solution in the dry country.
( d) Permanent Soil Sterilisers. ?Such sterilisers act as poisons,,
killing the emerging seedlings, and render the soil sterile for
some years. They are being used on roads, paths, channel
batiks, etc. The chemicals employed are sodium chlorate,
arsenite of soda and hydrated borax.
Arsenical solutions, in view of their poisonous properties, are not
popular for general weed work, but the amount of chlorate being used
is increasing rapidly.
Spraying a Road in the Tumbarumba District for Control of St. John's Wort.
Sodium Chlorate as a Weed-killer.
Sodium chlorate is a white crystalline salt that is readily soluble
in cold water, and can be applied either in solution in the form of a
foliage spray or dry as a soil steriliser. While good results are
generally obtained in the cool or coastal districts with foliage spraying,
results are often disappointing in the dry western agricultural areas,
and it is here preferable to use the sodium chlorate as a soil steriliser
rather than as a foliage spray.
Foliage Spraying. ?The effective strength of the solution will vary
with different weeds and their stage of growth. Many annual weeds,
especially those with a large leaf surface, can be destroyed with a
very weak solution, even as low as lb. to 10 gallons. The rate


of application will, of course, vary according to the amount of vegeta-
tion. One hundred gallons of solution is usually sufficient to treat
i acre of weed growth, but with weeds that make heavy growth the
quantity should be increased to 150 gallons, or even 200 gallons.
In the case of deep-rooted weeds (biennial and perennial) a strong
solution is preferable, using approximately 1 lb. to 1 gallon of water.
Some foliage is difficult to wet, especially in hot weather, and the addi-
tion of 1 oz. of common glue to evqry 10 gallons of spray will materially
assist penetration.
Application to Foliage, ?All the leaves of the weeds should be well
moistened with the solution, and, as the spray is more effective and
economical of material when in the form of a mist, sprqying machines
on the compressed air principle are the most suitable for its applica-
tion. A knapsack sprayer of 2 to 5 gallons capacity will serve the
purpose for the spraying of small patches, but a barrel sprayer mounted
on a waggon or truck is more convenient for larger areas. When it
is desired to treat several areas, power sprays as used in commercial
orchards can be adapted for the purpose and are very efficient.
For the destruction of deep-rooting weeds it is generally necessary
to make two or more sprayings, any new growth made by the plants
being sprayed about six to eight weeks after the first spraying. Unlike
that of many other weed killers, which rapidly kill the top growth
but do not destroy the roots, the action of sodium chlorate is very
slow; at first comparatively little effect is noticed, but the plants
gradually wither, the roots become exhausted, and finally the whole
plant dies.
The sprayed areas should be left undisturbed for a period of three
months after spraying.
Time of Spraying. ?The best time for spraying weeds is, as a rule,
when they are making good growth, such as just before the flower
stage, or when the amount of leaf surface is greatest. In the case
of weeds with a large amount of old woody growth it is preferable
to slash down the old top growth and spray the young regrowth. The
action of sodium chlorate is more rapid when the air is moist. Rain
following a short time after spraying does not hinder the action of
the spray; in fact, in some instances the kill has been more complete
when rain followed within a few hours of spraying. The chemical
is not so effective on weeds which are continually in the shade, and
the best results are obtained where spraying is done in direct sun-
light.
Soil Sterilisation. ?The chemical can be used dry or in solution, and
the soil should be saturated at the base of the plant. This is especially
recommended for new outbreaks of serious weeds in the western dis-
tricts. The chemical can be applied at any time, but early winter is
generally preferred.
The sterilising effect on the soil is of a temporary nature, the
period depending on the rainfall and other soil factors. The chlorate
is washed down into the soil and shallow rooted clovers will grow the
next season, while deep-rooted crops will not thrive until probably
two years later, depending on the quantity applied.

As sodium chlorate is injurious to any growing plants, care is
required not to let the spray solution come in contact with other
plants that it is not desired to destroy, nor should it be used in close
proximity to shallow-rooting plants, as it is likely to penetrate the
soil and affect the root systems. Any spray apparatus that has been
used must be thoroughly rinsed with plenty of water to remove all
traces of the chemical, and particularly before being used to spray
fruit trees, etc.
Danger of Fire and Stock Poisoning. ?Sodium chlorate may be regarded
as non-poisonous to stock when applied to weeds or grass in minute
quantities, but care should be taken to prevent animals having access
to the chemical, either in a dry state or in solution. The salty taste
of chlorate attracts stock, and they will readily drink solutions from
containers, with serious results.
Materials which burn easily, such as clothing, leather boots, wood-
work, etc., if sprinkled with a solution of sodium chlorate are ren-
dered more inflammable, and when dry can be ignited by a spark or
friction, thus constituting a fire menace. It is essential to mix the
solution in the open, wear rubber boots which will not absorb the
solution, and overalls that can be discarded quickly and washed. When
spraying keep a supply of water on hand in case of emergency.
Modified forms of sodium chlorate, which are non-inflammable, are
on the market. These modified forms have sodium chlorate as the
base, but contain also certain moisture attracting chemicals, which
makes them safer for use as sprays.
Arsenical Compounds.
The types of arsenical compounds commonly used are arsenite of
soda and arsenic pentoxide, with a trend toward the latter during
recent years.
Spraying Ragwort with Arsenic Pentoxide in Victoria.
Arsenite of soda is generally regarded as a soil steriliser, and its
toxicity is very definitely affected by the type of soil. Arsenic is most
toxic in light sandy soils and least efficient in clay soils. In fertile

alluvial soils the chemical is generally not successful as a soil steriliser,
as it is soon rendered unavailable to plants.
The use of arsenic pentoxide
may be said to have developed
from its employment in prickly
pear control work in Queens-
land and New South Wales.
This chemical is a most efficient
one for spray work, being eas-
ily dissolved in cold water,
although hot water is to be pre-
ferred. as having better pene-
trative powers for weeds. Dur-
ing recent years this type of
arsenic has also largely replaced
arsenite of soda for green tim-
ber destruction.
These sprays are applied in
a very similar manner to the
chlorates for general weed
growth, but in the case of
prickly pear a much lighter dos-
age is given and atomisers are
used. Arsenic pentoxide has
been used with great success a f
strengths as low as 2 per cent,
on Ragwort. Arsenite of soda
for soil sterilisation work is
used at a much greater strength.
Experiments are still pro-
ceeding with what is known as
the acid arsenical method, but

tbe results so far have not been sufficiently successful to warrant its
recommendation. The solution is easily prepared and applied, and
consists of a stock arsenic solution of white arsenic and caustic soda,
concentrated sulphuric acid and water (see details of preparation on
page 28).
Warning Regarding Poisonous Nature of Arsenic. ?While arsenic may be
used with comparative safety on channel banks, waste areas
of land and on private land where dilute solutions are recommended,
the extremely poisonous nature of this chemical must never be for-
gotten. All treated areas should be posted with poison notices, and
livestock should be kept away until heavy rain has fallen. Special care
should be exercised to avoid spraying (unless in dilute solution) of
vegetation that may retain arsenic and later be eaten, by humans or
livestock. Contact of arsenic with the skin should, if possible, be
avoided, as continuous contact will cause a severe rash and other
troubles. When contact is unavoidable, the exposed hands and face
should be protected by smearing with white vaseline.

Equipment Used in Spraying Weeds.
A very large variety of equipment has been designed for the appli-
cation of chemical weed killers.
Common weed killers may
be divided into two groups :
(i) Uncorrosive liquids :
such as sodium chlor
ate, oils and arsen-
ite of soda. These
may be applied with
any pressure spray
apparatus without
damage to the mach-
ine or pump.
(2) Liquids or chemicals
of an acid nature
which corrode any
steel apparatus. Sul-
phuric acid and
arsenic pentoxide are
?common weed killers
of this class, and all
parts of the ap-
paratus should be of
brass. Special pro-
prietary chemicals
can also be added
to reduce the cor-
rosive effect of acids
Knapsack sprays are
very commonly used for
ordinary weed killing work,
and those with an under-
arm two-way hand pump
with an extension lance
have proved most satis-
factory.
Special study has been
given to nozzles for effi-
cient application of chemi-
cals, and the flat or fan
type nozzle has been found
preferable to the ordinary
nozzle giving a circular
spray. These fan-shaped
sprays give better pene-
tration and a more uniform
cover of the foliage.
An Efficient and Widely Used Type of Knapsack
Spray Pump.
A Knapsack Spray Pump in Use.


Large, boom sprays have noth been widely used in this State, but
in the near future will probably be employed extensively on railways
and roads.
The Eastern Riverina County Council, which applies a large quantity
of chemicals to roads, uses a specially designed portable power outfit
with two lines of hose, allowing one man to work each side of the
machine as it travels along the centre of the road.
In prickly pear chemical control work special atomiser knapsack
outfits are commonly used; also stabbers and pistols, which are used
to inject arsenic pentoxide into the fleshy leaves.
Weeds of Cultivation Land.
SKELETON WEED.
(Chondrilla juncea.)
Because of its smothering habits, excessive powers of reproduction,
and its ability to resist strenuously attempts to eradicate it, coupled with
the fact that normal cultivation of crops tends to stimulate natural,
Skeleton Weed in Mature Stage.
vigorous growth. Skeleton Weed has become the most insidious and
serious menace wheat-farmers in New South Wales have ever had to
contend with. Although it is not regarded as a weed of any conse-
quence in other countries, conditions in this State have encouraged a


powerful growth of this plant, witli the result that it has become estab-
lished over the South-western Slopes and Riverina and the Central-
western Slopes as the worst agricultural weed ever encountered in
this country.
Skeleton Weed (so called in this country) is a native of the sandy
soils of central Asia and has since spread to southern Europe and
the United States of America. The plant somewhat resembles a dan-
delion in the early stages, but very quickly a thick, fleshy taproot
is established, and some three to four months later the skeleton-like
top growth is made, reaching a height of from 2 to 4 feet. If damaged,
the root system exudes a white sticky sap. Growth normally com-
mences during May and continues slowly until mid-spring, when the
vigorous top growth is made, ending with profuse flowering and seeding
during the latter portion of summer. The top growth then dies
back, but the root is of a perennial nature, and fresh growth is made
from the old root the following autumn.
The basal portion of the stems has a thick covering of bristles or
hairs. The flowers are borne singly, and are conspicuous by the yellow
colour. The seed resembles that of lettuce, but it is not as plump,
and has a white parachute attached.
The root growth consists mainly of a fleshy taproot which grows
straight down to a depth of 5 to 6 feet, but occasionally side roots
are in evidence, especially after any interference with the plant by
machinery or chemicals.
The weed first appears as single plants, then assumes characteristic
patches of ten and twenty square yards, and from this stage, if
neglected, gradually spreads, totally smothering crops.
In 100 per cent, infested country further cereal grain production
is out of the question, but the damage is not confined to the heavily in-
fested country. On light to medium infested country the weed causes
not only reduction of yield, but a weakened straw and lodged crops.
Because of the damage to machinery when endeavouring to take the
grain from these patches, it is difficult and often impossible to harvest
such a crop. The stem of Skeleton Weed is coarse, wiry and tough,
and winds around shafts, causing irreparable wear throughout the
machine, especially in the drums and conveyors, with smashing of
false combs. The reduction of yield is immediately reflected in the
revenue from the farm, and the area is then classed as grazing country,
and, in 100 per cent, infested areas, only second-class grazing land
at that.
Infestation with Skeleton Weed means heavy and annually re-
curring expenditure to maintain production by modified systems of
farming, including extra fodder cropping, continual work to prevent
seeding, rotations, cultivation, pasture improvement, etc., and stocking.
Skeleton Weed spreads mainly by seed, which is produced in enor-
mous quantity, and possesses at times very high germination capacity.
The seed is of the ordinary lettuce type, with a light pappus attached,
allowing it to be carried by wind for long distances, as well as on
bags, wool, transport vehicles and by many other common means.

Under ordinary conditions seeding does not commence until the
lirst week in December, but it may continue through the summer if
rains occur. The spread from roots is of very minor concern, and
only occurs when cultivation is carried out when soil moisture is
very high.
Control.
Control of the weed has two aspects ?
(i) Eradication in reasonably clean areas where infestation is
not heavy nor heavy reinfestation from seed a possibility.
(2) Control of the weed in heavily infested areas by diversified
systems of farming, embodying intensive stock grazing, the
sowing of competing crops, the adoption of wider rotations
and the development to the full of suitable side-lines.
Treatment of Individual Plants and Isolated Patches. ?ln the case of
individual plants, the use of salt is recommended. The plant should
be grubbed with a mattock 2 to 3 inches deep and a pint of salt
applied to the exposed root. A half to one gallon of water should
then be poured on the salt, covering it finally with earth to prevent
stock licking it up.
Skeleton ?Weed Out of Control (see photo p. 22).
Where the weed is in patches these can be eradicated by spraying
with sodium chlorate. The spray can be applied when the plants are
in a rosette stage, either before the top growth is made or when a new
rosette of leaves is formed after cutting the weed near the flowering
stage. These periods are generally in August and, if summer rains are
recorded, March. The most effective method is to spray the foliage
with a solution of sodium chlorate consisting of I lb. to 2 gallons of
water, wetting the foliage well, also the ground around the base of
the plants.


The top of the weed will immediately die back, but destruction of
the root will take some four to six weeks, and during this period
any plants that did not receive sufficient spray and those not above
the surface at the time of spraying will keep on growing. It is there-
fore necessary to spray a second time, and a stronger solution is
recommended for the second application. This spray should consist
of lb. sodium chlorate to i gallon of water, and if the spraying is
done in the spring a period of from four to six weeks should elapse
between each spraying.
A Skeleton Weed Area Reclaimed.
The same paddock as in the previous photograph two years later, stocked and under a
rotation of fodder crops.
Prevention of Seed Formation. ?The weed must be prevented from
forming seed, and this will necessitate thorough early stubble burning
when the weed commences to flower, or mowing of the stubble.
The argument that feed is destroyed will have to be abandoned, and
fodder crops grown to fill the gap if this weed is to be prevented from
seeding in the stubbles. Where the weed has extended to the charac-
teristic patches the stubble fire will miss the patch, as it will be quite
green. In such case it is either necessary to cart old straw, such as
rubbish from stacks, to these spots, or use a flame-thrower to clean
up the patches. A flame-thrower can also be used as a spray unit on
the farm.
Careful handling of sheep is essential during the seeding period, and,
while they should be used as much as possible to prevent seeding, they
must not be allowed to spread the seed. Sheep that have been grazed
on areas in seed should not be moved to clean areas until after shear-
ing. Wethers will prove of great value in punishing the weed, without
serious loss to the revenue from the stock.
Lucerne will Compete with the Weed. ?Lucerne is a deep-rooted plant
and succeeds in entering the deeper layers of the subsoil similarly
to Skeleton Weed, which cannot compete with it, once its roots are
established in these lower levels.

Suitable soil conditions are necessary, however, for the establishment
?of a good stand of lucerne; and it is urged that, where possible,
paddocks should be sown to this valuable crop before the weed has
Lucerne and Skeleton Weed Roots Compared.
The two outside plants are lucerne,'the others Skeleton Weed
completely taken charge. Detailed information concerning the con-
ditions governing lucerne culture is given in publications obtainable
from the Department.
It must not be overlooked that in establishing lucerne on infested
country the lucerne is called upon to compete in the early stages with
a deep rooting, vigorous, established plant, and every assistance must
be afforded the lucerne. Stocking of the young stand must be discreet,
and the crop must be given the advantage of cultivation, and renovated
with adequate dressings of superphosphate. The point to be realised


?
is that one is endeavouring to establish a competing plant and not
merely produce lucerne; hence the position is somewhat different from
-ordinary lucerne culture.
Destruction of Seedlings. ?Where seeding of the weed takes place
the germination should be carefully watched and the seedlings imme-
diately cultivated. The young plant immediately sends down a vigor-

ous taproot, and it has been observed that unless cultivation takes place
before the root has been established there is little hope of destruction
by this means unless the farmer is fortunate enough to cultivate just
Wimmera Rye Grass and Subterranean Clover (left) on Infested Wheat Land


prior to a severe droughty period. This taproot growth is rapid, and
when the top growth is about 2 inches in diameter the root has generally
reached a foot in depth.
Control on Heavily Infested Areas. ?All farming methods on country
that is infested to the degree of patches, with the surrounding
country also infested, must aim at seed prevention, with which must
be combined the sowing of suitable crops and pastures. In the wheat
belt this means a large reduction in grain crops and their displacement
by fodder crops and grazing lucerne, with a building up of stock on
the property ?in short, the adoption of a sound permanent type of
agriculture. Rotation of crops, with reduced wheat acreage, makes
possible the development of temporary pastures and the extension of
fodder crops such as oats, resulting in turn in the abolishing of con-
ditions conducive to the thriving of the weed.
The subject of rotations is a large one and the systems vary con-
siderably. Landholders with Skeleton Weed infested areas should
consult their local agricultural instructor, who will visit the property
and advise as to the programme best calculated to defeat the weed.
HOARY CRESS.
(Lepidium dr aba.)
Hoary Cress is a weed native to Europe, but now common in most
agricultural belts in the temperate countries of the world. The name
Hoary Cress originated from the slight hoariness, or whitish appearance,
of the foliage, due to a covering of very fine hairs. This weed is also
known as White Weed and sometimes as Chalk Weed.
Hoary Cress possesses a deep perennial root system, and is rightly
considered one of the most serious pests of cultivation land, early iden-
tification (as the first step in control) being of the utmost importance.
This weed has already appeared over a wide range in New South
Wales, but, with the exception of some districts in the far south, is so
far confined to small areas. Its rate of spread is slow, but once estab-
lished it is very difficult to eradicate, even when an intense eradication
campaign, employing chemicals, is undertaken, as in our dry wheat
districts.
The weed is almost entirely useless, and though stock may eat it to
some extent, any value it has in this respect is more than off-set by the
very severe competition to which it subjects other valuable pasture or
fodder plants. Hoary Cress is a very serious pest of wheat and oat
country, causing reduction of yields and consequent depreciation of
land values; and, unless pastures are vigorous and their vigour is care-
fully maintained, it will also be a serious competitor in the grazing
field and cause a considerable reduction in carrying capacity.

The flowers are white and easily recognised, but it often happens
that the plant does not flower until the second year, by which time the
root system has become firmly established in the new situation. Young
plants usually have a ?rosette? form, consisting of one or more circles
of leaves which arise close to the ground, and these will usually be
found connected with neighbouring plants by horizontal roots of con-

siderable length, from which they arise mostly as buds. Toward early
spring the older plants develop an erect stem, which grows to a height
of approximately 18 inches and bears alternate leaves about 3 inches
long and an inch or more broad. The small crowded white flowers
are flat-topped, and can be seen in the crops or pastures from Sep
tember to November.
Control.
Where Hoary Cress has spread over large areas complete eradication
is not economically possible. The weed, however, can be controlled to
some extent and the farm revenue maintained by the use of such crops
as lucerne and other vigorous pastures, provided enough sheep are
run to keep seeding at a minimum.
On rich alluvial river flats, vigorous lucerne stands compete without
any trouble with Hoary Cress, but when the stand begins to thin out the
ci ess increases again, and re-seeding has to be undertaken after several
good cultivations to reduce the vigour of the cress.
Treatment of Small Patches. ?ln the case of a small infestation,
complete eradication is possible. According to experiments conducted


by the Victorian Department of Agriculture, it appears that not less
than two years of fortnightly cultivations are necessary to kill the root
system.
Salt is generally regarded as the most valuable killer of this plant,
and farmers should not hesitate to apply ample salt to isolated plants
and small patches.
Carbon bisulphide is very useful where the soil is porous and dry,
but it is costly. Quantities of from i l / 2 to 2 oz. of the liquid are poured
into holes bored in the ground to a depth of 18 inches and 2 feet
apart, the holes being then sealed up.
Hoary Cress at Flowering Stage in a Wheat Crop
Spraying of Large Patches. ?Where the patches assume any size,
spraying with sodium chlorate or arsenic compounds is recommended.
Sodium chlorate is non-poisonous, and, provided care is used, will
probably be found the more efficient. A double spraying is required,
with approximately two to three weeks between each application, using
a strength of 1 lb. to 1 gallon for the initial spraying and i l /* lb. or 2
lb. to the gallon for the second spraying.
The most effective arsenic compound appears to be acid sodium
arsenite. A solution is made by mixing 4 lb. of white arsenic and 1 lb.
caustic soda in pints of water and stirring until dissolved, the spray
solution being prepared by mixing 1 part of the stock solution in too
parts of water, and then adding slowly and with constant stirring 5 parts
sulphuric acid. The spray should be applied in hot, dry weather and
late in the day, and the following morning the area should be re-
sprayed with water.
The weed should not be disturbed by cultivation for some time before
spraying; and after spraying it should not be cultivated or grazed for
some six or eight weeks.

WILD MORNING GLORY OR BINDWEED
( Convolvulus arvensis. )
This weed is most troublesome in cultivated land where a fair
rainfall is recorded. On the coast and in tableland districts many
farmers are troubled already with this pest, and during recent years
it has invaded many wheat localities. Field Bindweed is probably the
most serious weed of the United States of America.
It is a perennial plant of twining habit, and the roots penetrate
deeply into the soil. The leaves are alternate and heart shaped, but
tend to become arrow shaped on the upper part of the vine. The
flowers are white or rarely pink, and about one inch in diameter.
Control.
Ordinary cultivation methods are quite useless in the combat of
this weed. Very deep ploughing, followed by frequent summer culti-
vation, will reduce its vigour but will not eradicate it. In small patches
the remaining plants can be salted. Chemicals in the form of soil
sterilisers can be used effectively on very small patches.
The sowing of lucerne or vigorous pasture, followed when estab-
lished by systematic grazing, is the most practical method of control.
Both lucerne and subterranean clover will find the competition fierce
during the early stages, and the paddock should be given careful treat-
ment, with ample renovations and applications of fertiliser. It gener-
ally takes these smothering pastures about two years to gain the upper
hand of a weed of this type, and the process can easily be further
hindered by severe drought conditions during the early stages of the
establishment of the pasture.
In the western district this weed has invaded many small orchards,
with very severe effects on trees. Where suitable land is available
the best plan is to move the orchard to clean soil and reclaim the old
orchard with a good pasture.
WILD OATS.
(Avena fatua.)
The Wild Oat is one of the most widely distributed, best known
and costly weeds of the wheat belt. It is true that there are some-
what different types of wild oats and there are also false wild oats;
but for the present purpose these differentiations may be ignored.
The prevalence of Wild Oats may be attributed to two causes?the
use of combined harvesters or headers and the cropping of land. An
additional source of infestation is the use of ?oaty? fodder and impure
seed. The hairy coating of the oat seed enables it to survive the diges-
tive processes of stock, and the pest can thus be spread to clean land.
The seed of the Wild Oat requires very definite conditions for its
germination, and may lie dormant for one or more years until such
conditions are presented. Many instances have occurred where Wild
Oats have been buried deeply for a few years and unintentionally

returned to the surface, to germinate with vigour. The requirements
for germination are briefly a combination of good soil moisture con-
ditions and cool temperatures. Cultivated soil is more likely to pro-
vide these requirements; hence the practice of leaving land out to
layland for a period to eradicate Wild Oats is often disappointing.
In the north-west of New South
Wales, owing to the summer rainfall, it
has been found that wheat crops can be
grown profitably for some years in suc-
cession without fallow. This system
is now receiving a severe set-back in that
Wild Oats are each year severely reduc-
ing crop yields. The Wild Oat un-
doubtedly is going to compel a revision
of this continuous cropping programme.
Preventive Measures.
It is important to sow only clean seed,
also that no oaty fodder be fed to horses.
The best scheme to adopt with horses
is to feed clean, grain-free chaff, and
crush any added grain.
The conversion of oat-infested
patches or self-sown oat crops into
silage is an efficient method of dealing
with wild oats.
Eradicative Methods.
The essential thing is to germinate
the seed, and this is most profitably
done by carrying out a medium or shal-
low cultivation in the early autumn
and seeding with cultivated oats for
fodder. Oats make excellent feed for
sheep, and the area can be grazed
heavily through the winter and later
fallowed in the normal manner for the
production of wheat the following
autumn.
Seeding of wheat on ?oaty? paddocks
should be carried out with a heavier
seeding of a quick growing variety and
with fertiliser. The drilling should be
carefully done, so that no patches are
missed.
A Grain of the Wild Oat (Avena fatua)
Note the prominent basal scar (bs), the
dense basal hair development (bh), and
the hairy rachilla (R) with its spatula-
shaped apex.
Where it is known that oats have been turned in deeply, care should
be taken that future ploughings are not so deep as to replace the
seed near the surface.
CANADA THISTLE.
(Cnicus arvensis. )
This creeping thistle, a native of Europe and Central Asia, has been
recorded from only two localities in New South Wales. The weed
is a very serious one, however, and every endeavour should be made
to completely eradicate it.


Canada Thistle is an erect perennial with a jointed horizontal root-
stock, which creeps for long distances beneath the surface of the
ground, sending up new plants at short intervals. The stems are I
to 4 feet in height, slender, grooved, and woody. The leaves, which
clasp the stem slightly at their base, are 3 to 6 inches long, deeply
cut, and toothed with hard, white, needle-like spines. The flower-
heads are rose-purple and in clusters, the topmost opening first.
The pest spreads both from seeds and from the root-stock, broken
pieces of which will develop into new plants, and may become a most
dangerous weed. It is a serious weed of cultivation land, and can
also become firmly established in poor pasture.
Control.
In the case of new outbreaks, plants should be destroyed imme-
diately they appear by sterilising the patch with coarse salt and ample
water. At Bathurst excellent control has been obtained by sowing
grazing lucerne on the infested area. The lucerne has been vigorous
enough to completely control Canada Thistle in a period of two
years.
CAPE WEED.

may even cause death. It is not only a weed of cultivated land, but
is found also on pasture land, roads and headlands. Where it persists
in a wheat crop it often seriously affects wheat yields.
It is claimed for this weed that it has a fodder value, but it takes
the place of more useful herbage. From the dairy farmer?s point of
view, it is definitely detrimental in a pasture, being a strong milk
tainter.
Control.
Adoption of efficient methods of fallowing is necessary. The weed
can be kept under control by fallowing the land well and cultivating
frequently to destroy the young plants. Every effort should be made
to get the soil into such a condition that there will be a good germina-
tion and vigorous growth of the cereal crop, which has a smothering
effect on the weed.
WILD CHICORY.
(Cichorium intybus.)
Wild Chicory is an erect branching, blue flowered, perennial weed,
common in the tableland districts and on the Western Slopes. Vigor-
ous growth is made in the spring, and flowers are produced by January.
The plants seed prolifically, and are propagated and dispersed mainly
by this means.
Control.
On cultivation land this pest may be checked by a variation in the
cropping procedure. An oat crop introduced into the rotation system is
very valuable. The oat crop should be sown in autumn and may be fed
off a few times and then allowed to make sufficient bulk for either
silage or hay, which will be cut before the chicory flowers. Sheep
should then be grazed on the stubble to prevent any plants from seed-
ing. The following season the paddock may be similarly treated, and
following that the chicory should be sufficiently well in hard to allow
the growing of another crop.
In the New England district red clover rotations are used with
excellent success. The red clover is used for two years, and the land
is then sown to spring crops.
In areas where only a few scattered plants of Wild Chicory are found,
digging out in the early spring, or cutting and application of a spadeful
of salt to the exposed roots, is effective.
Where a widespread infestation of weed occurs on places inacces-
sible to the plough, spraying with sodium chlorate at the rate of I lb.
to i gallon of water is recommended, applying in spring when the plants
are making very active growth, generally when the top growth is being
formed following the ?rosette? stage. Any re-growth should be
sprayed in about eight weeks? time in a similar manner.

wards the top, and the leaves are
numerous, glossy-green, and narrow,
with the mid-vein prominent on the
under-side. The spikelets are reddish-
brown and arranged in short spikes
or clusters on unequal stems. The
pest spreads rapidly by means of the
scaly, fibrous root stocks, which pro-
duce tubers in great abundance, from
which shoots are sent to the surface.
Control.
This weed is very difficult to con-
trol, and in the case of specialised
cropping or orchards its eradication
is particularly difficult. Isolated plants,
and small patches of the weed, should

be destroyed by using coarse salt at a heavy rate. This, of course, is
only practicable on very confined areas, but is recommended where new
outbreaks occur. Experiments at present indicate that in suitable
localities asparagus, which is very salt-tolerant, can be successfully
grown immediately after treatment with heavy dressings of salt.
The weed is a serious competitor in maize and sugar cane crops. In
the case of the latter, good cultivation will reduce the vigour sufficiently
to allow the cane sets to become dominant. Maize can be successfully
grown by using the deep furrow method of planting. Furrows are
opened up, the seed is sown in the bottom, and as the maize grows
the furrows are gradually filled in.
Lucerne is a most successful competitor, and many areas have been
successfully cropped in this manner.
In the case of small home gardens, good cultivation should be fol-
lowed by the transplanting of good healthy seedling crops, not by sow-
ing of seed, while a good vigorous lawn will be found very effective
where its use is desirable.
Insects parasitising Nut Grass have not so far been found of any
great practical value.
PASCALIA WEED.
(Pascalia glauca.)
This is a stiff, erect herb, Ito 2 feet high. The flowers are yellow,
somewhat like a small sunflower. It is a very strong growing weed, and
will prevent the growth of both grass and crops.
Control.
Destroy by digging out and burning every portion of the stem and
root, or by treating with sodium chlorate, using it as a soil steriliser.
PENNY CRESS.
(Thlaspi arvense.)
A smooth annual herb, with small white flowers and an erect stem
about a foot high. The seed pods are comparatively large, erect, and
furnished with wing-like borders, making an almost perfectly circular
figure, with a notch at the top. Each of the capsules, which are pro-
duced in abundance and are of a peculiar greenish-yellow colour when
ripe, contains a number of seeds which render wheat unsuitable for
milling purposes and when eaten with other foodstuffs by dairy cattle
taint milk and butter.


Small patches are most effectively dealt with by hand pulling and
burning. Where areas have become more thoroughly established,
plants can be destroyed by harrowing, cultivating or ploughing before
the seeds ripen. Spring or early summer fallowing kills the young
seedlings.
This weed is established on the Northern Tablelands, but is not likely
to invade wheat districts in which good and systematic fallowing is
practised.
PERENNIAL RAGWEED.
(Ambrosia psilosiachya.)
A perennial with a strong creeping root system, from which arise
numerous slender, much-branched stems from 2 to 6 feet high. The
leaves are much divided, greyish green, 2 to 5 inches long, rather
rough, with short, stiff hairs, and aromatic when rubbed. The flowers
are small, inconspicuous, green and yellowish.
This is a weed which takes possession of the land and entirely pre-
vents the growth of grass or crops.
Control.
Spray with sodium chlorate, i lb. to I gallon water, or dig out, being
careful to remove every portion of the root.
JOHNSON GRASS.
(.Sorghum halepense.)
Johnson Grass was introduced for the production of late summer
and autumn fodder, but has spread to some agricultural districts with
serious results. Planted on the higher country, the weed is now in-
vading the fertile agricultural plots of the southern and central rivers
and irrigation areas. This grass is a prolific seeder and spreads as well
by underground runners. The plant is very similar to Sudan grass,
except for the root system.
Control.
For isolated plants, chemical sterilisers can be used, the best results
being obtained by cutting the patch back and heavily spraying the
new growth. In light sandy soils, isolated plants can be grubbed
out and burned.
Heavy infestations are difficult to handle, and lucerne is not vigorous
enough to compete with this weed. Mixed pastures, combining sub-
terranean clover and Phalaris, can be used to reduce the dominance
of the weed, but complete eradication is practically impossible.

D?Fruit.
This common thistle, often in-
correctly called Scotch Thistle, is a
biennial; it grows to a height of 3 to
4 feet, is very prickly, and the grey
seeds possess a pappus attachment,
which allows them to float great dis-
tances on a windy day. Besides being
detrimental as a competitor with crops
and grasses, the thistle is a nuisance
when in wool and hay. During recent
years it has shown a tendency to be-
come a pest of the irrigation areas.
Control.
Isolated plants should be grubbed
out with a mattock, cutting well below
ground level. In wheat country the
use of rigid-tine scarifiers fitted with
wide tines in place of disc cultivation
proves very effective. Early stubble
burning should be adopted with in-
fested crops. In the case of lucerne
crops, especially on irrigated country,
good cultivation during July and early
August will eradicate the young
thistle. Mowing should be carried out
on pasture land.
COCKSPUR OR SAUCY JACK.
(Centanrea melitensis.)
A so-called thistle with yellow flowers, this weed is also known as
Burr, Yellow Burr, and Chinese Burr; it is frequently confused with
other star thistles. The flower-head is surrounded with prickly
involucral bracts. The leaves are hoary and even slightly silky, and
the edges are wavy; it will be observed that they clasp and run down
the stem.
Cockspur inhabits both cultivated and uncultivated land to the detri-
ment of crops and the exclusion of better and more useful plants. It
has a bitter taste, and stock will not eat it if other food is available.
Control.
This weed should be controlled by cultivation and by mowing before
the seed has formed. Burning-off will also destroy large quantities of
the seed.

Yellow Forget-me-not is a rough,
hairy annual with erect stems branch-
ing near the top. The leaves are
rather thick, lance-shaped to linear,
and thickly covered with fine bristly
hairs. The flowers are very small,
yellow, and occur in curved spikes
which become long and loose in fruit.
Control.
Isolated plants should be hoed out.
On cultivation land rigid-tine scarifiers
will eradicate the weed.
SORREL.
{Rumex acetosella.)
This is a perennial low-growing
weed which mainly causes trouble in
cultivated areas or on land that has
been cultivated and then left out to
pasture. The weed is encouraged by
spring and early summer rains and is
most objectionable from a competitive
point of view during these periods.
Control.
Sorrel frequently becomes estab-
lished on poorly drained portions of
the farm, and in this case it is essential
to adopt some system of drainage.
Liming will then help to improve the
fertility of some soils, making them more suitable for the growth of
grasses and clovers which will successfully compete with the Sorrel.
In Sorrel districts it is essential to give crop land systematic rests, and
during this period to carry out frequent shallow summer cultivations.
Weeds of Pasture Land.
BATHURST BURR.
( Xanthium spinosum .)
Bathurst Burr is a much branched annual shrub, i to 3 feet high
and very spinous. The fruit is nearly egg-shaped and is covered
with hooked prickles, by means of which it readily becomes attached
to the hides and fleeces of animals and the clothes of man.
Preventive measures should be adopted as far as possible. The
seeds can be introduced to land on the wool of sheep and the hair

of cattle and horses, and any stock carrying seeds should be kept
off the property. If it is necessary to bring burry sheep on to the
farm, they should be shorn as soon as possible.
Control
A large area of Bathurst Burr is
hand-cut every year, which makes it
perhaps the most costly of our weeds
It can eventually be controlled by sys-
tematic treatment, but not for a long
time, unless some attention is given
to increasing the vigour of the pasture.
In the north-west of the State, large
areas of Bathurst Burr are being con-
trolled by seeding the paddocks to
grazing lucerne. Bathurst Burr is un-
able to compete with lucerne, and on
a number of properties an area of
lucerne is being sown every year in-
stead of spending large sums on cut-
ting, which appeared a never-ending
process. Great success has been ob-
tained with grazing lucerne in a large
number of centres in other portions of
the State, and the method is highly
recommended where the land is suit-
able.
Chemical spraying is rarely adopted
for Bathurst Burr, but in some special

and it is impossible to cultivate it with
a disc cultivator, success has been ob-
tained with sodium chlorate, using to lb. per gallon of water.
Arsenic pentoxide at a similar strength is sometimes used where there
is little danger of stock poisoning.
The fly Camaromyia Indians is a natural parasite of this weed; it
lives on the seeds and is found plentifully throughout the burr areas.
It is claimed that this parasite reduces the amount of viable seed, but
so far it has not been able appreciably to reduce the amount of
growing burrs.
CAPE TULIP.
(Homeria collina.)
A native of South Africa, this pest is confined to the coast and
small outbreaks in the Central Tablelands. It is a bulbous plant,
with stiff, rather angular, unbranched and somewhat zig-zagged stems,
and solitary grass-like leaves up to 3 feet long, usually much larger
than the stem, and prominently ribbed. The flowers are attractive,
fairly large, and orange-red or pink, with a greenish-yellow base.
A vellow-flowered form is also found in some districts.


This is a very dangerous weed, principally because of the losses
it causes amongst stock by poisoning. The feet of animals, especially
the cloven feet of sheep and cattle, disseminate the small bulbs, and
it is also carried on people?s boots. The greatest risk of mortality
in stock is where animals are newly introduced on to infested country.
Those raised on such country quickly develop a strong antipathy to
the weed.
Control.
Prompt measures should be taken to eradicate this weed, and when-
ever plants appear they should be hoed out and the bulbs destroyed
by burning. In some places it has a strong hold and eradication would
be expensive; in such cases it is advisable to spray with arsenic pent-
oxide, iy 2 lb. to a gallon of water. The spraying should be done
just prior to flowering. Two or three applications will be necessary
to destroy the plant. Care should be taken to keep stock off the
sprayed area for some time, or there is a risk of poisoning.
As in the case of other weeds, constant eradicative measures have
their effect. By digging out carefully with a spade during the winter
and burning the bulbs over a number of years, a farmer who had
300 to 400 acres of badly infested land practically cleared the property.
In the opinion of this farmer, burning is the most effective way to
kill the bulb. Ploughing, in the opinion of landowners familiar with
the pest, simply assists in its spread. Putting the infested area under
crop for some time would, of course, clean the ground, but this is
often not practicable.
Every effort should be made to build up the pastures on infested
country in an endeavour to confine the weed to its present area. Sub-
terranean clover and Kikuyu grass are of particular value in suitable
localities.
CROWN BEARD.
(Verbesina encelioides. )
Crown Beard is a native of the warmer parts of America, but has
become a naturalised weed in most of the more temperate countries.
In New South Wales it is most common in the north-west and por-
tions of the County of Cumberland.
It is a hairy annual about 1 to 2 feet in height, the stems being rather
loosely branched. The leaves are more or less triangular or deltoid in
shape, about 2 to 4 inches long, and have irregularly but sharply toothed
margins. The leaves are green and minutely hairy on the upper sur-
face and ashy grey and densely hairy on the under surface. The leaf
stalk is generally expanded at the base into a wing-like toothed appen-
dage.
The flowers are daisy-like, Ito inches in diameter, and a bright
golden yellow, and the petals are divided into three teeth at their tips.
The seeds (achenes) are of two kinds: one is flattened, broadly winged
and has two needle-like awns at one end, and the other is thickened,
rough wrinkled, and usually without awns or wings.
Being a free-seeding species, this weed may become troublesome in
crops, and it has definitely been shown to be harmful to sheep.

Being an annual, it can be controlled by ordinary cultivation methods.
The plant mainly appears in the spring months, flowers during the
summer and seeds during autumn. Therefore seed production must be
prevented by eradicating the plants during spring and early summer.
If the plant is allowed to flower, seed is produced very freely.
DEVIL?S CLAW.
(Martynia proboscidea.)
This is a soft, pumpkin-like plant, with a short thick stem and
branches, the branches usually spreading along the ground for i to 3
feet or more, according to local conditions. The leaves are large, 3 to
9 inches broad, and of a roundish or heart shape. The tubular-shaped
flowers are of a yellowish-white colour, variegated with green, pale
purple and violet spots, and are to 2 inches long. The ripe seed
capsule is 4 to 6 inches long, the upper portion terminating in the long
claw-like spines, which are specially adapted to catch in almost any
object they come in contact with, and being strong and sharp they work
their way into the tender part of the feet of sheep and cattle, and some-
times cause serious lameness. As a rule, stock do not take to this
plant; they appear to have a very strong aversion to plants emitting
a strong odour, and this one discharges a slimy or clammy substance.
Control.
Devil?s Claw is killed as easily as a pumpkin vine. Once severed from
the root it will not grow again, as its only means of reproduction is
from seed. If the area is cut over once or twice during the growing
season before the seed capsules develop, the weed can be be success-
fully overcome, especially if the infestation is a new one. On old
infested areas it may take two or three years to eradicate it, as the
seeds do not all germinate at the same time, some being preserved in
old capsules for long periods. It is advisable, therefore, to gather up
and burn any old capsules to prevent further infestations, and also to
prevent them from coming in contact with stock.
GALVANISED BURR.
(Bassia Birchii.)
Galvanised Burr is a native plant of spreading habit, 2 to 3 feet high,
and very intricately branched. The leaves are small and narrow, about
;/2 inch long, and clothed, as are the stems, in white cottony tomentum.
The inconspicuous flowers are very numerous, occurring in practically
every leaf axil, and later develop into a hard spiny, burr-like fruit.
These fruiting perianths or ?burrs? are provided with five fairly stout
spines, the longest, about h inch long, giving the plant a rather for-
midable appearance. At times the whole of the plant, or portion of it,
becomes broken off from the ground and is carried along by wind, often
forming quite considerable ball-like masses. In this respect it re-
sembles a closely allied species, Bassia quinquecuspis (?roley-poley?).
It is fairly widespread in the far central- and north-west of New South
Wales, and is spreading at an alarming rate.


Owing to its spiny nature, stock will not touch it and the burrs
adhere to the wool. This is one of the most important factors in its
spread, as movement of sheep is sometimes extensive in these districts.
Galvanised Burr on Red Soil in North-west N. S. 'Wales.
On account of variable seasonal conditions, the stocking rate is very
erratic in these parts, and often the country is considerably over-
stocked, and the burr then quickly becomes established when rain falls.
Control.
In the far western districts this burr is considered of value in that
it provides cover and thus prevents surface erosion. The plant does
not appear sufficiently drought resistant to become a serious danger in
these areas.
In the marginal country the burr is a menace, and graziers should
take rapid steps to reduce this pest. The plant appears to set seed at
a very young stage, and even when cut at a height of a few inches
probably has many mature burrs, which if not carefully handled and
burned will grow. The flame thrower has been used on some properties
on small patches with success.
The burr is invading the agricultural belt. Under these conditions
cultivation with lucerne as a grazing stand is giving most satisfactory
results.
Commonwealth authorities are endeavouring to secure a parasitic
insect, with a view to reducing the drought resistance of the plant.
This line of work is most difficult in that it is a native of Queensland
and the field is very limited.
KHAKI WEED.
(Alte rn anthem e chin at a.)

North Coast and in all north-western towns and suburban areas of
New South Wales.

This plant is usually of a creeping habit, rooting at every joint, the
branches more or less covered with woolly hairs. The leaves are
usually light-green to ashy in colour, and smooth on the surface, or
nearly so. The flowers are arranged in heads, usually in the axils of the
leaves, the perianth segments and bracts supporting the florets usually
being somewhat straw-coloured and stiff, and inclined to be sharp-
pointed when fully matured.
Khaki Weed is a prolific seeder, but the burrs are pointed and do
not cling to wool like Bathurst Burr. So far, moreover, it has not
become a serious pest on pasture lands which are regularly grazed by
sheep.
Control.
This weed often grows prolifically around sheds and yards and in
recreation areas, and as the seed is readily carried by motor-car tyres
and other means to grass land, it is important to destroy the weed at
these places. It lies close to the ground and often escapes notice.
Where it is established thickly systematic hoeing and burning appears
to be the most economical method of control, but it is necessary to cut
the plants well below the ground. On cultivation areas it is readily
destroyed by ordinary cultivation methods. In North Coast areas the
planting of Kikuyu grass has been effective in suppressing this weed.
Spraying with dilute sodium chlorate is effective but has no effect
on the seed in the soil.
NOOGOORA BURR.
(Xanthium chinense. )
Noogoora Burr is a native of North America and Mexico and is
firmly established over the northern portion of New South Wales.
The weed thrives on river frontages, shallow swamps and practically
any country that is flooded to encourage germination.
The plant attains a height of 5 or 6 feet, and has spreading branches
covering an area 5 to 6 feet in diameter. The stems and branches are
rather rough and somewhat ribbed. The leaves, which are on slender
stalks from to 5 inches long, are heart-shaped at the base, and the
serrated margin is dissected into from three to five lobes. The flowers
are inconspicuous, and the fruit or ?burr? is borne in clusters of from
two to thirteen on short stalks, arising in the forks made by the leaves
and stem. When mature they are up to 1 inch long and about inch
wide, very spiny, with two prominent stout spines at the apex, and
somewhat brownish in colour.
Noogoora Burr is a strong competitor for grass and herbage, and
in its very early stage of growth (when it is showing only two leaves,
and the cotyledons, or primary leaves, are still attached) is also defin-
itely poisonous to stock. Pigs are most susceptible; calves are less
affected, and sheep still less susceptible.
The burr or seed is very large and is a menace to coarse wool sheep
or crossbred types, the burrs matting the wool under the neck. The
Merino wool, being finer and shorter, does not pick up the burr to the

same extent, and the case is less serious inasmuch as the burr is
generally removed during ordinary scouring. With crossbred wool the
burr often remains until the carding process.
Control.
Where the property is clean, the first measure is to avoid, if possible,
bringing burry sheep or cattle on to the property. Where the infesta-
tion consists of isolated plants or very small patches, new outbreaks
can be efficiently controlled by pulling up or hoeing below the surface
of the soil, but in some cases (especially where the burr is growing in
shallow water) this is impossible. Spraying with contact sprays such
as arsenic pentoxide, lb. to i gallon, is successful in such a case,
but costly where large areas are concerned.
Burning is not easy, as when green the plant is too sappy and when
dry is very woody, and the seed burrs are able to resist a quick firing.
The burrs produced by a single normal plant are estimated at approxi-
mately 10,000. Each of these burrs possesses two seeds, one of which
germinates a season earlier than the other. Any scheme of cutting or
cultivation must make allowance for this and be continued over a suit-
able period.
RAGWORT.
(Senecio jacobaea .)
A native of Europe and Asia, this weed has become naturalised in
New Zealand and Victoria. It is a perennial herb, springing from
rather shallow and fibrous roots from which a few short, thick root-
stocks are extended. The stem is 2 to 4 feet high, erect, stiff, very
leafy and branching at the top. The leaves are dark green, cut into
segments, and the segments themselves are also toothed or deeply
cut; the lower leaves are 6 to 8 inches long and stalked, the stem
leaves smaller and stalkless. The flowers are showy, in large many-
headed branching inflorescences, the individual flower heads golden
yellow and nearly an inch across. The seeds are light yellow, grooved
and oblong.
This weed causes slow poisoning of cattle, and is a constant menace
in dairying districts. Sheep can graze on Ragwort for longer periods
than cattle, but they do not thrive on it.
Control.
Spray with sodium chlorate or arsenic pentoxide, 3 lb. to 5 gallons.
The weed should not be disturbed by cultivation, as this will result in
more vigorous growth.
STINKWORT.
(Inula graveolens.)
This is an upright, much-branched plant, with lemon coloured daisy-
like flowers. It has a disagreeable smell, which is noticeable also in
the milk of cows, and even in the mutton of sheep, depastured on it
for some time. It is reasonably palatable when it occurs in small
quantities, but when plentiful is not relished by stock.


To be effective, the work of eradication must be commenced in
the early stages of infestation, for where the weed is neglected it
gets a firm hold, and eradication is then costly. In many parts of
the State it has not yet become established, and in these areas indi-
vidual plants should be cut or pulled out befoie they seed.
Where the land is heavily infested, the weeds should be destroyed
by cultivating with the disc before seeding, followed by cropping if
possible. Improvement of the pasture by top-dressing with super-
phosphate will also serve as a means of control by improving the
palatability of the weed and making it more readily eaten by sheep.
The hoe should be used, if possible, on any plants which escape the
cultivation or are not eaten.
This weed will not stand competition of ordinary pasture grasses
and clovers, and that land is infested is very often a sign that it has
been overstocked or allowed to become overrun with rabbits. This
is particularly the case on the tablelands and inner Western Slopes.
In such cases, it is generally sufficient to destroy the rabbits and en-
courage regrassing by top-dressing. Cutting the weed will hasten
eradication, but where the pastures are improving rapidly cutting is
not necessary.
From the point of view of the dairy-farmer in relation to cream
flavour, Stinkwort is one of the worst weeds. A number of plants
are detrimental in this respect, but most food flavours are volatile,
and can be eliminated or greatly reduced by the pasteurisation or
aeration at the factory, while aeration over the ordinary farm cooler
also assists in this respect. The taint of such weeds as Stinkwort,
however, is less easy to eradicate, and cows should be kept off badly-
infested pastures for at least three hours before milking.
SWEET BRIAR.
(Rosa rubiginosa.)
This weed has become established in many of the cooler parts of
the State. The plant is of a bushy habit, with branches covered with
hooked spines and glandular hairs or bristles. The leaves are pinnate
and the leaflets are densely glandular and give out the strong aro-
matic Sweet Briar odour. The flowers have five white or pink petals
and numerous yellowish stamens. The fruits are oblong and of a
reddish colour when ripe.
Control.
A maintenance programme is necessary in briar districts, and the
paddocks should be annually cleared with a mattock. Large bushes
are easily pulled out with a chain and tractor or horses in the winter
period. The bushes can be eradicated by using a penetrating spray
of sodium chlorate. Where briars persist the pasture should be given
attention in order to increase the vigour of the ground cover, thus
reducing further germination.

YASS RIVER TUSSOCK.
(Nassella trichotoma.)
This tussock type of grass has been for the last twenty years con-
fined to the Central Tableland areas such as Yass and south of
Bathurst. Its spread has lately caused serious concern to landholders;
as a result, some investigation work has been carried out, and the
Shire Councils in affected localities have taken ready steps to have
the pest declared noxious.
The plant is a harsh perennial tussock, with long, very fine, rough-
edged leaves, growing to a height of 2 to 3 feet. The early growth
of the tussocks appears to be slow and spaced some distance apart.
The tussocks are rather coarse, and after some years thicken up to
become a dense mass excluding all poorer types of grasses. The seed
is produced during November, and the spikelets, which are usually
amongst the leaves, can generally be seen owing to their dark purplish
colour contrasting with the green leaves. The light seed panicle easily
breaks away, and is carried by wind for miles.
Control.
From observations in the infested country it is obvious that this
grass will not invade and compete with established grasses, but re-
quires soil with a poor herbage cover for its germination. When
established, however, the tussocks will assert themselves, and it does
not appear to be of any use introducing good grasses or clovers with-
out breaking up the tussock by ploughing. The ploughing should be
immediately followed by cropping or sowing with vigorous pastures,
otherwise the tussock will re-establish itself. Before any such work
is carried out, rabbits should be got rid of.
Isolated plants can be grubbed out with a mattock: experiments are
being carried out to ascertain a suitable chemical to employ in situa-
tions where the use of a mattock is difficult. Such measures, how-
ever, are not sufficient, and are in fact very wasteful unless they are fol-
lowed by pasture work to prevent further germination of the tussocks.
Fortunately the tussock is at present confined to districts ideally situ-
ated for pasture improvement from the point of view of climate, soil
and rainfall.
BUFFALO BURR.
(Solatium rostratnm.)
Buffalo Burr is most common in the Western Division of New
South Wales, extending to the tablelands. It is a much-branched
annual plant of 1 to 2 feet in height, covered with yellowish, star-
shaped hairs, and densely set with slender needle-like yellow spines.
The leaves are deeply cut (the segments being irregular in size), covered
with star-like hairs and with the mid-ribs and stalks prickly. The
flowers are yellow, about inch to 1 inch across; the calyx is densely
prickly, becoming a burr that encloses the fruit.
The objection to this weed is that the burrs become attached to
wool, reducing it in value.
Control.
The methods of control recommended are hand-hoeing of isolated
plants and the cultivation and cropping of the land.

MINT
WEED.
(Salvia reflex a .)
An erect annual greyish-coloured plant a foot to feet high;
stems square, and in young plants covered with short, stiff hair. The
leaves, on slender stalks up to inch long, are arranged in pairs
on opposite sides of the stem, and are oblong or lance-shaped, Ito
2 inches long, but only inch broad, with the edges toothed. The
flowers are blue or lilac, small, two-lipped, opposite or in small clus-
ters forming slender sprays at the ends of the branches. The fruit
consists of groups of four nutlets or ?seeds? enclosed in a five-toothed
cup left after the flower has fallen. When crushed, the whole plant
has a strong, rather sage-like odour.
This plant has been responsible for heavy losses of stock in Queens-
land, and has been tested at Glenfield Veterinary Research Station
and found to be highly toxic.

TRUE STAR THISTLE.
(Centaurea calcitrapa.)
A pink or purple flowered
spreading thistle, forming dense
masses 2 to 3 feet high. Its
spreading habit causes a reduc-
tion of grasses, and its prickly
leaves and flowers are sufficient
protection to keep stock off this
useless plant.
Control.
This thistle is commonly found
on roads and headlands, and the
most common method of control
is to cut with a hoe or other
mechanical means. The thistle
is not a serious pest of well-culti-
vated land.
CALTROPS.
( Tribulus terrestris.)
This weed is a native of this
State. It is a creeper, running
closely along the ground, as much
as 8 feet in several directions
from the main stem, bearing
small yellow flowers about one-
third of an inch in diameter,
with five petals. It has a hard
fruit, divided into five sections,
each of which has a hard and
sharp spine. It can lame all
classes of animals, and is es-
pecially severe on horses, wound-
ing the frog of the foot, where
it causes intense irritation and
suppuration. It dies away in
winter, but leaves enormous
quantities of seed on the ground,
each of the five sections of which
will develop into a plant.
Control.
Where it is thick it should be
burnt off when dry enough, as
the fire will destroy large num-
bers of the burrs.

THORN APPLE OR FALSE
CASTOR OIL PLANT.
(Datura stramonium. )
Throughout the greater part of New
South Wales the common name df
this weed is Castor Oil Plant, and it is
commonly confused with the True
Castor Oil Plant (Ricinus communis).
It is a somewhat succulent, bright-
green, heavy-smelling herb 2 or 3 feet
high, and grows in waste places. The
leaves are rather large, irregularly cut
or toothed, and paler on the underside.
The flowers are large, white, and are
usually described as trumpet-shaped.
The pod or fruit is rather large, much
rougher than a nutmeg grater, and
contains a large number of black
kidney-shaped seeds.
Thorn Apple is now widely distri-
buted over New South Wales, its
most common habitat being the banks
of rivers and creeks. It appears to be
poisonous to stock in some cases, and
the seeds are poisonous to human
beings when eaten.
Control.
This weed should be controlled by
hand cutting, and by cultivation where
the conditions are favourable.
CLARY OR WILD SAGE.
(Salvia verbenaca.)
A herbaceous plant with a woody root-stock and leafy stem, 1 to 2
feet in height. The leaves are 2 to 4 inches long and wrinkled, the
basal leaves having a long leaf stalk and the upper leaves none, all
having more or less saw-like edges. The flowers are of a bluish or
purplish colour.
Control
This weed has not yet obtained a strong foothold, but plants should
be destroyed by hoeing whenever they appear.
HOREHOUND.
(Marrubium vulgare.)
- A herbaceous plant 1 to 2 feet high, with a short stout root-stock,
the whole plant being more or less covered with woolly hairs. The
leaves are broadly egg-shaped, the flowers white with saw-like edges.
t 32382?E


This plant is usually found in the neighbourhood of buildings, and
overstocked places around homesteads, sheep dips or dams. Where
the land can be cultivated it should be ploughed and cropped. In the
case of grass paddocks the weed should be cut and an endeavour made
to increase the grass cover.
YELLOW PEA.
(Cassia sophera.)
This plant is of a bushy habit and grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet.
The leaves are pinnate with four to ten pairs of dark-green, narrow,
lance-shaped leaflets, and the flowers bright yellow. The pods are
somewhat cylindrical, 2 to 4 inches long by % inch in diameter, and
contain numerous seeds of an olive-green colour. Yellow pea is a
native of the northern parts of this State and Queensland.
Control.
The best methods of controlling this pea are to hoe out scattered
plants, and to mow areas where the plant is thickly established in order
to prevent seed formation. When arable land is thickly infested, the
land should be cultivated and sown with lucerne.
FURZE OR CORSE.
(Ulex europaeus.)
A densely thorny shrub, usually from 3to 5 feet bight. It is branched
and somewhat spreading and furnished with furrowed, rigid, irregular
spines. The flowers are bright yellow, and somewhat odorous. The
pods are inch long, black, and covered with brownish coloured hairs.
This plant is becoming firmly established on parts of the Southern
Tableland, and if neglected is likely to become a serious pest on grazing
lands.
Control.
All isolated plants should be dug out. In the case of patches burning
off followed by frequent cutting in the young stage will be found a
slow but sure means of eradication, and, as is the case with Blackberry,
persistence is necessary for success. The plants can be destroyed with
chemicals, using temporary soil sterilisers such as sodium chlorate.
:^mam
Weeds of Both Cultivation and Pasture.
BLACKBERRY.
(Rubus fruticosus.)
When blackberry is well established, especially in volcanic soils, it
is difficult to bring it under control, owing to the fact that the plants
sucker and root freely at the tips of the canes. In the higher rainfall
and cooler tableland districts the plant is becoming a real problem.
The extension of pasture improvement and sheep appear to be factors
in its solution. I

?Brushing,? a common term for cutting or slashing, is unpleasant
but of value where the operation is continued over a period of years.
When carried out in the autumn and winter it will prevent the tips
from rooting, but it does not materially affect the old plant. Some-
times, to obviate the work of slashing, the plants are sprayed with
chlorates and then burned when they become dry. This method is
very suitable where the plants are not growing along fences or near
buildings.
For complete eradication spraying with sodium chlorate should be
carried out when the plant is in full flower, using a solution of I lb.
to i gallon of water, wetting the foliage well and, if possible, jetting
the soil at the base of the plant. A further application of spray should
be made after an interval of eight to ten weeks to any re-growth.
Arsenical solutions may be used in the same manner, but, owing to
the poisonous nature of such solutions, it is necessary to keep stock off
the sprayed area until after a heavy fall of rain or the sprayed material
has been burned.
Where the land is suitable for sheep, young plants can be kept
down by running crossbred wethers on the area, and in some districts
goats are tethered on rough country to eat back the blackberry vines.
In suitable localities Kikuyu grass sown after burning helps materially
to smother the suckers.
ST. BARNABY?S THISTLE.
(Centaurea solstitialis. )
An annual plant with a yellow, prickly, thistle-like flower; the whole
plant covered with a short whitish cottony covering; the lower leaves
dissected, the terminal lobe larger than the lower ones; the upper
leaves linear, with wavy edges. The stems are marked by long,
narrow wings, which are really continuations of the base of the
leaves.
This weed is detrimental to production on cultivated areas, and on
grassland crowds out more useful plants.
Control.
Where the weed is not firmly established it should be hand-cut, and
where it is thick it should be destroyed by cultivation, and if possible
by cropping. It is necessary to fallow before cropping and to work
the fallows thoroughly to destroy any plants. This weed has obtained
such a hold in some of our wheat-growing areas that its eradication
constitutes a serious problem. The procedure recommended is disc,
springtooth, or rigid-tine cultivation of the stubble paddock in March
or April, then the regular fallow ploughing in June or July, with the
necessary subsequent cultivation for control. At wheat-sowing time
it is advisable to wait until after rain, permitting a cultivation, and,
if necessary, to sow a quick-maturing variety.
On grazing land the thistle should be mown just before seeding.
Top-dressing with superphosphate, by improving the growth of grass,
helps to smother the thistle and make it more palatable to stock. This

smothering process can be assisted by the sowing of subterranean
clover in districts where the rainfall exceeds 20 inches per annum and
occurs in the winter months.
Where conditions are suitable, lucerne may be utilised to kill out
the thistle.
ST. JOHN?S WORT.
(Hypericum perforatum.)
This weed of European
origin has become firmly estab-
lished in the higher and cooler
tableland country of New
South Wales. It is one of our
most troublesome and harmful
weeds. Under favourable
conditions it rapidly spreads
and crowds out the natural
grasses and other nutritious
herbage, and some lands on
which it has become firmly
established have had to be
abandoned. Stock will eat
the weed, especially in the
young stages, but it contains
an active principle which has
a very serious effect on stock
that are grazed on the weed
for some time. Light-col-
oured parts of the skin are
rendered peculiarly sensitive
to sunlight, causing a severe
itch, and as the result of rub-
bing and biting the parts swell

and bleed. The nervous system is also affected, causing either depres-
sion or intense excitement, and death sometimes results if feeding is
persisted in.
St. John?s Wort is an erect plant, 1 to 3 feet high, with large yellow
flowers; the under side of the leaves is a paler green than the upper
surface. The plant is most easily recognised by the oil-glands in the
leaf. These can be seen when it is held against the light, giving the
leaf a perforated appearance. The oil-dots pervade the whole plant,
and are mixed with fewer dark-purple, opaque dots, especially on
the flower, where the dark dots are frequently crowded along the
margin of the petals.
The plant is perennial in habit and reproduces itself both from seed
and by suckerine - from the roots, which penetrate deeply into the
ground. When it is cut or burned, it comes again from the roots,
and it is, therefore, necessary either to dig these out or destroy them.

used in the Experiments
Control.
in the Tumbarumba, Orange, and Wallerawang districts and portion
of the Mudgee district the land is mostly ideally situated for the
development of vigorous pastures, and in those centres this practice
will undoubtedly form the basis of reclamation work. Smothering
pastures such as subterranean clover sown on fallow have given
excellent results, and where they are combined with judicious grazing
St. John?s Wort quickly declines.
The Type of Suffolk Ram
Much attention has been focused on the possibilities of utilising
dark-skinned sheep on wort-infested country. The experiments along
these lines have reached a stage where it can be definitely stated that
Suffolk rams are sufficiently prepotent to transmit black skin and
points to fat lambs when mated with Merino x Leicester ewes. The
lambs from this cross have matured without any ill effects, and the
ewes, when hand shorn and given a little mixture of pasture, can with-
stand the effect of the weed sufficiently to breed satisfactorily and grow
a good fleece of wool.
In inaccessible country, also over many miles of roads, frontages to
water courses, railways, etc., it is necessary to use chemicals to eradi-
cate this pest. In this connection the work of the Eastern Riverina
County Council is worthy of mention. The council has done remark-
ably efficient work in clearing such land, using chlorates in power
sprays.
Coarse common crude salt is most effective for the eradication of
isolated plants, while the application of a penetrating foliage spray is
recommended for areas of any size.
Attempts to liberate a parasitic insect have not met with any practical
success, but the efforts are being continued.
The planting of pine plantations to control St. John?s Wort is a good
scheme on rough hilly country, but vigorous pastures appear to be
more profitable on fertile country.


PATERSON?S CURSE.
(Echium plantagineum. )
Paterson's Curse, or Blue Weed, has a wide range in New South
Wales, but is most common in the southern and western districts. It
is a coarsely hairy biennial i to 3 feet high, the basal leaves large and
more or less egg-shaped or oval, the stem leaves lance-shaped, stalkless,
and almost stem-clasping. The flowers are purplish, funnel-shaped,
to 1 inch long, longer on one side, and with two of the stamens longer
than the other three. The rough fruitlets or seeds are four in num-
ber from each flower. On good soil the plant reaches a height of 5
feet, and may stool considerably, but where it is very thick each plant
is usually limited to one flower head and to a height of 1 to 3 feet.
That the weed produces some feed is undoubted, but although it may
be considered of value in poor sandy country it is a smothering, rough,
coarse plant that chokes out all other vegetation, and when it dies the
ground is left quite bare.
Control.
This weed demands special conditions to thrive, and can be easily
controlled in fertile country capable of good pasture. In the south of
New South Wales even top-dressing to encourage clover is sufficient
to control this plant.
Isolated plants should be hand-cut, and where the weed is very thick
it can also be destroyed by cultivation, by mowing the weeds before
they seed, and by stocking heavily with sheep in the young stages of
the plant?s growth and grazing the weed quite bare several times in
the year so as to prevent it from seeding.
LANTANA.
(Lantana camara.)
Lantana is a shrub ranging from 4 to 7 feet in height, with a wide-
spreading or scrambling habit. The leaves are ovate or oblong, with
saw-like edges, and the upper surface is covered with stiff hairs. The
leaves and branches are very aromatic when bruised. The flowers are
arranged in flattish heads with numerous florets which are of a yellowish
tint, and change to red when fully developed. The drupe-like fruits
are shiny and black in colour. Lantana is common in parts of the State,
especially in the northern river districts.
Control.
Lantana is regarded principally as a pest of roadways and waste land,
and the treatment for Blackberry can be applied to this weed. On the
far North Coast Lantana is regarded as valuable as a fertility builder
on old cultivation paddocks and banana plantations. After a few years
the land is cleared by grubbing or spraying with chemicals.

SAFFRON THISTLE.
(Carthamus lanatus.)
This thistle is widely spread in
New South Wales. The flowers
are yellow and are surrounded by
prickly clasping leaves, almost the
same shape as those surrounding
the stem. The plant generally
grows with an upright centre stem
2 to 3 feet high, and (particularly
the upper portion of it) is more or
less thinly woolly.
Saffron Thistle has received much
attention from the point of view of
possible fodder value. On the
Western Plains it helps to provide
ground cover and prevent erosion;
its hardy growth also often provides
cover for young and luscious grass
which is highly valued by graziers.
The plant is not a strong competitor,
and when the grass cover becomes
strong Saffron Thistle gradually
diminishes. This is very noticeable
in old cultivation paddocks. When
the paddock is first left out, Saffron
Thistle often takes charge, but as
the grass cover improves the thistles
gradually decrease.

Good cultivation methods will keep the plant out of wheat paddocks,
except in the event of abnormal spring rains and subsequent late
harvests. Lucerne can be used very successfully, and should be sown
on old cultivation paddocks where there is a'possibility of Saffron
Thistle taking possession.
PADDY?S LUCERNE.
(Sida rhombifolia.)
Paddy?s Lucerne is of a slender or twiggy habit, and varies from 2
to 4 feet in height. The leaves are simple, with saw-like edges, rather
pale on the underside, and from y 2 to Y\ inch long or rarely exceeding
i inch. The flowers are pale lemon-yellow in colour, % inch to Yz
inch in diameter, and on a very slender thread-like stalk. A large
quantity of seed is produced by an individual plant.
Control.
When the land can be cultivated, it should be deeply ploughed or
rotary hoed and sown with a crop or pasture. In other cases the weed
should be hoed out, or sprayed with chlorates or arsenic.


Miscellaneous.
COMMON BARBERRY.
(Berberis vulgaris.)
The Common Barberry is a native of Europe and Asia, which has
been cultivated in the cooler parts of this State as a hedge plant. It
is a shrub 4 to 8 feet high, with leaves 1 to 2 inches long, usually in
clusters, at the base of which are three small spines. The edges of the
leaves are bristly toothed. The flowers, in drooping racemes, are
yellow, and the fruit is an oblong scarlet berry arranged in narrow
bunches.
The objection (and a very serious one) to this plant is that it is a
?host? of stem rust disease of wheat, and a potential breeding ground
for the development of new parasitic strains of the rust fungus. For-
tunately, in the major portions of the wheat belt in this State, climatic
conditions are not suitable for the growth of the Barberry, but the
plant is found occasionally in the cooler districts. On such plants new
rusts may develop, transferring from them to susceptible grasses, and
it is only a question of time before newly-developed strains of rust may
migrate to the main wheat-growing areas.
Control.
The application of salt or kerosene to the crown of the plant is
effective in its destruction. Digging out is only recommended for small
plants which permit of the eradication of the complete root system.
Destruction of the plant is now enforced under the provisions of the
Plant Diseases Act. If it is desired to grow barberries for ornamental
purposes, the Japanese Barberry ( B. thunbergii), a species which is
immune from rust, should be selected.
BRACKEN FERN.
(Pteridium aquilinum. )
This weed is very widespread on the tablelands and coast of this
State. Bracken fern has little or no value as a fodder plant and
becomes a harbour for rabbits, which aids further rapid spread and
makes reclamation difficult.
Control.
Methods of eradication vary considerably, according to the locality,
the suitability of the soil for cultivation or pastures, and the amount
of fern present. Small areas can be systema� ally cut with special
bracken scythes or slashing wires to prevent any fronds maturing.
Continued cutting or slashing will quickly reduce the vigour of the
plant, and if it is done thoroughly the fern can be completely eradicated.
On land that can be ploughed, careful and deep ploughing will eradi-
cate the plant in a couple of years. The land must be systematically
cropped for some years or laid down to pasture; the bracken will re-
gain its previous hold if neglected after the initial kill.

Excellent work is being done with pastures, and on one large pro-
perty in the Crookwell district which originally carried large patches
of fern, vigorous pastures have completely crowded it out. On this
property no special work was done on the fern except the establishing
of subterranean clover in the patches, and the development of the
pasture combined with continuous stocking has cleaned the bracken
completely out.
Typical Bracken Fern Infestation on Pasture Land.
On the North Coast Kikuyu grass is used with equal success, and
where planting is followed by ample use of fertiliser and stocking the
fern is quickly destroyed.
In all pasture schemes the rabbits must be destroyed before planting.
The fern will burn readily when the fronds turn brown. After burn-
ing, the usual methods of rabbit destruction?digging, ploughing, trap-
ping, poisoning and use of dogs, can be employed.
On the South Coast bracken fern appears to have spread more
rapidly than elsewhere, but control by pasture and cutting has been
very successful as in other parts of the State.
BOXTHORN.
(Lycium ferocissimum.)
A rather low shrub with somewhat drooping spiny branches. The
leaves are more or less clustered, rather thick, and vary much in size.
The flowers are solitary or occasionally in pairs, pale-violet in colour,
funnel-shaped and nearly twice the length of the two-lipped calyx.
The pods are orange-red in colour when fully matured.
Control.
If the process is assisted by a fall of rain, Boxthorn may be destroyed
by pulling out with a tractor or horses in the summer. Any regrowth
should be given an application of coarse salt.

Weeds of Irrigation.
Most of the weeds dealt with in the foregoing pages are to be
encountered under irrigation, and as they are not limited under these
conditions by lack of moisture, they grow much more luxuriantly
and prolifically. In addition, there are several very troublesome weeds
An Old Irrigation Channel which has been
Drained to Destroy Cumbungi.
which are not normally regarded
as noxious under dry farming
conditions, but which may be
classed as water or aquatic
weeds. The invasion of chan-
nels and ditches by these water
weeds is a serious matter, and
careful attention should be paid
to the special characters of these
pests, and every precaution taken
against the necessity for costly
eradication work.
CUMBUNGI.
( Typha. )
This large vigorous bulrush
has become a serious pest of
irrigation channels and drains,
and other slow moving water
streams, creeks, drainage
ditches, swamps, etc. The head
ditches may become infested with
Cumbungi, creating a serious
obstacle to irrigators. This weed
may also make serious inroads
in rice fields not under good
rotation, or where grading on
the bays is ineffective.
Control.
In supply and drainage ditches
the best plan is to remove the
Cumbungi Spreading in a Newer Irrigation Channel.

Cumbungi by such mechanical means as scoops, hand hoeing, digging,
or by ploughing and delving. Once the channels are clear, the work
should be followed up and any new growth grubbed out immediately.
In the case of rice fields, land should be properly graded, the fur
rows alongside levee banks filled in, and the whole of the levee bank
planted to rice. Further, a suitable rotation should be aimed at.
The use of weed seed traps is effective in prevention, but is
inclined to slow up the speed of the water travelling in the channel.
CANE GRASS.
(Pitraqmites commun is.)
This grass, sometimes known as Reed Grass or Salt Water Cane
Grass, is a very serious water weed. It can resist and thrive in salt water,
which makes it a very difficult plant to eradicate.
Control.
The same measures of control are recommended for Cane Grass as
for Cumbungi, and similarly it is necessary to patrol all ditches and
?eradicate the plant on appearance.
PARA GRASS.
(Panicum muticum.)
This grass has proved of great value to dairy farmers by providing
luscious feed in the creeks and permanent streams of the far North
Coast. It is a water-loving plant and will grow in three to four feet
of water. During recent years it has caused some alarm by spreading
into the drainage channels, cane fields and also the navigation chan-
nels of the Tweed River.
Control.
Treatment with chemicals in the form of foliage sprays appears to
be of some value, but soil sterilisation is difficult because of the high
organic content of the soils and the excessive rainfall. Pulling the
grass out of the streams by mechanical means appears to be the solu-
tion in the case of navigation channels and drainage ditches. This
removal should be regarded as an annual maintenance work.
BATHURST BURR.
(X ant hinm spin os urn. )
Large scale irrigation schemes provide very suitable conditions for
the spread of Bathurst Burr. This plant thrives on the edges of creeks
and channels, and in the newer irrigation schemes in the southern part
of New South Wales eradication is a very big problem.
Control.
Hand hoeing, mowing and burning of the plants prior to seeding
are the cheapest methods of eradication. In some places it will be
found possible to lightly spray the channel banks with a weak solution
of sodium chlorate. A sufficient strength for this work is lb. to
i gallon of water.


COMMON WATER REEDS AND SEDGES.
These are usually found in shallow, slow flowing ditches, swamp-
areas, and poorly drained pasture lands.
Control.
The measures recommended for prevention and control are the same
as those suggested for Cumbungi. On pasture land, prevention should
be aimed at by satisfactory grading of the land and adequate fertilising
of the pastures.
PASPALUM AND WATER COUCH.
(P asp alum dilatatum and P. distichum.)
These two grasses are primarily weeds of small drainage supply
ditches, but they may spread to orchards and vineyards from head-
lands. They are vigorous summer growers and rapidly cover banks
and beds of ditches, almost completely blocking the movement of
water.
Control.
Fencing off to allow stocking is very effective. Other methods con-
sist of burning off in winter, construction of ditches so as to rapidly
drain off irrigation, and digging out with mattock and shovel during:
winter and following up in summer. Weed seed screens should be
fitted at the point of supply.
WATER HYACINTH.
(Eichhornia speciosa.)
Water Hyacinth is a pretty aquatic, and thrives in water in a warm
climate. The foliage is killed by frosts in the winter. It seeds pro-
fusely, and it is mainly on this account that the plant is difficult to
eradicate. At the base of the leaf stalk is a large bulbous looking
development which is composed of numerous air cells which act as
floats. The roots penetrate to a depth of from 2 to 4 feet, and it
thrives just as well in 40 feet of water as in only a few feet.
As the older plants mature they are gradually forced below the
surface of the water and accumulate on the bottom, forming a mass
of decomposing organic matter. Where it has taken possession of
water courses, this weed impedes navigation, renders water unsuit-
able for stock and household purposes, blocks drainage channels and
changes good grass swamps into a very poor quality feed.
Control.
Control measures consist of draining of swamps and creeks, and
dragging the plant from the water and leaving it on the banks to die:
also cutting sections free and keeping them moving down stream to
salt water, which kills the weed

Weeds of Rice.
In addition to Cumbungi, rushes, and the reeds already referred to,
the weeds that affect rice fields most seriously are Water or Barnyard
Grasses (Echinochloa crus-galli and E. colonutn), Millets (Japanese,
etc.), Stick Weed (Asfor suhulafus) and Sedge (Cyperus diander), and
these render the land practically useless not only for rice-growing but
for other crops as well if thorough methods for their control are not
adopted in the early stages of rice-growing.
On the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas over-cropping of land with
rice, careless use of irrigation water, and lack of suitable cultivation
are the principal causes of infestation with these weeds. The best
means of controlling them consist of a satisfactory cropping rotation,
with winter cereals principally, or the sowing of temporary pastures
that will provide grazing for sheep and at the same time put the land
to more efficient use.
BARNYARD GRASSES OR MILLETS.
The members of this group are similar in their early habits. Owing
to probable natural crossing and the consequent production of many
intermediate types, the botanical nomenclature is not strictly definable.
In common with all the members of the Millet family, they possess
considerable value as fodder plants and are principally detrimental
when infesting rice fields.
Control.
The best methods of control are suitable cultivation and rotational
cropping.
SEDGE.
(Syprus diander.)
A prolific, useless weed of rice fields and shallow ditches.
Control.
Rotational cropping, suitable cultivation and efficient drainage are
recommended for control.
STICK WEED.
(Asfor subulatiis.)
A prolific encumberer of irrigable and damp situations. While it
possesses some slight feed value, its usefulness in this respect is en-
tirely offset by its detrimental effects.
Control.
Suitable cultivation and rotational cropping are again the best
methods of control.


Weeds in Orchards and Vineyards.
Weeds in orchards and vineyards may not be evidence of neglect,
nor are they always to be condemned. In many hilly districts of higher
rainfall, it has become a popular and efficient practice to use annual
weeds as a cover crop to assist in maintaining fertility and to prevent
surface erosion.
Weeds as an Orchard Cover Crop.
A crop of annual weeds, mainly wild oats, spear grass and thistles, ready to be ploughed in.
Showing Rough Cultivation following Ploughing in.
The practice in such districts generally is to deep plough in spring
and then leave the land in the rough with any growth of common
annual weeds. Such types of weeds as Saffron Thistle and Bathurst
Burr, however, are not tolerated because of the possible invasion of
surrounding land.

In citrus orchards the trees are comparatively shallow rooted and,
in districts of low rainfall especially, this type of cultivation is not
suitable. In these lighter sandy soils, Couch Grass (Cynodon
dactylon ) and common annuals prove severe competitors, and clean
cultivation is necessary.
Perennial weeds are a serious menace to orchards and should
not be permitted to become established. Their harmfulness differs
with different trees and vines, but when established these weeds
are very difficult to manage by cultivation. Weeds of this class are
Skeleton Weed, Convolvulus, Johnson Grass and Nut Grass. These
weeds call for special vigilance by orchardists and should be dealt with
immediately they are seen. As stated previously, they can then be
chemically treated, using a soil steriliser, and a heavy application of
chemicals to a small patch will not interfere with established trees.
Should weeds of this nature be allowed to become established, eradi-
cation without damage to the trees is impossible.
The use of poultry on Johnson Grass and Nut Grass is successful to
a point, but in small home orchards in marginal country it is generally
more satisfactory to replant on a clean area when the old orchard is
heavily infested with perennial weeds and yields are dropping.
The planting of pastures to smother perennial weeds is only suc-
cessful if combined with judicious stocking, and this, of course, is very
difficult in a high yielding orchard.
Prevention must be the watchword, and special note should be made
of Skeleton Weed. This weed is already invading marginal orchard
land and the citrus areas of the irrigation areas. The weed has already
been discussed in detail (see page 19). As indicated, new outbreaks
can be killed by salting (with water) or applying sodium chlorate in
sufficient quantity to temporarily sterilise the small amount of ground
occupied by the plant.
Special Problems.
The following brief notes are intended as a guide to those concerned
with weeds under special conditions not dealt with previously.
Lawns and Golf Greens.
The whole aim should be to keep weeds out of these areas, as once
established they are most difficult to eradicate. The soil should be
carefully prepared before seeding to free it of weeds. Sound advice
should be obtained as to a suitable grass, and the vigour of the growth
should be maintained by regular mowing, fertilising and correct water-
ing. Any weeds which appear should be pulled or removed with a
knife or chisel. A weed can be ?spotted? with a chemical such as
arsenic or chlorate, using a few drops direct. The very small patch
of surrounding growth which is killed will quickly grass over again.


Pathways and Tennis Courts.
Where it is not desired to disturb the surface, weeds on paths can
be effectively treated by using soil sterilisers as mentioned' earlier.
Sometimes the paths are treated with a heavy dressing of salt (8 tons
per acre), or with a mixture of 4 cwt. sodium chlorate and 4 cwt.
arsinate of soda per acre before they are surfaced with gravel.
In the case of hard tennis courts weeds can be regularly sprayed
with a penetrating spray, or a heavy application can be made to cause
a temporary soil sterilisation.
Home Gardens.
Many weeds, such as Nut Grass, Onion Grass, etc., prove very
troublesome on these small areas, and control measures such as rotation
of crops must be practised. Repeated hoeing or frequent use of the
cultivator throughout the season, where it is possible to use these imple-
ments, or digging out the weeds with a hand fork should be carried
.out.
Smothering material such as tan bark, fresh stable manure and simi-
lar substances will materially assist in preventing the growth and for-
mation of bulbous weeds. A vigorous lawn such as Kikuyu, frequently
mowed and top-dressed, will choke out practically any weed.
Forwarding of Weeds for Identification.
The early identification of weeds is a very necessary step towards
efficient control. Any suspicious or strange weed should be forwarded
to the Under Secretary,. Department of Agriculture, Box 36A, G.P.0.,
Sydney, for determination of its name and habits (whether it is an
annual, biennial or perennial, etc.).
A covering letter should be sent mentioning the locality in which it
is growing and any observation made concerning its appearance and
growth; also the past history of the paddocks, whether devoted to
cultivation or grazing.
As complete a sample as possible should be forwarded, including if
practicable the flower, leaves, stem and portion of the roots.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
In presenting the foregoing information for the guidance of farmers,
the author wishes to acknowledge the valuable assistance of fellow
officers of the Department and those who in various ways have
facilitated his work.
