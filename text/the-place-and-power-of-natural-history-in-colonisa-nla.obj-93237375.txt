The various editions of tliis little publication re-
ceived many favourable notices from tbe Press ; but it
was not thought necessary to preserve them all, and
the following are a portion only of those which ap-
peared on the first edition.
Australian and New Zealand Gazette.
The New Zealand Handbook.— Under the above title an excellent
manual, for the use of intending emigrants to this colony, has just been
issued, in a cheap and compendious form, by the well-known House of
Willis, Gann, and Co.
Morning Post.
A most useful and valuable compilation, forming a perfect vade mecwn
for the emigrant to New Zealand.
Armagh Journal.
The historical sketch is brief, but admirably written—a feature, indeed,
of the entire work which places the colony in an agreeable light before
the intending emigrant.
Bath Journal.
The publisher has ventured on 5000 copies of the first edition of this
work. He will have no cause to repent it. It consists of 150 pages full
of information, and while it is beyond question the most useful book
yet produced for the emigrant, it will rank among the most interesting
to home readers.
Hereford Journal.
Full of information as an egg of meat.
Manx Sun.
Among the various books of advice to intending emigrants we have
seen none comparable to this. The perusal of it has greatly shaken our
former strong prepossessions in favour of the Canadas.
Weekly Record.
It is full of every information an emigrant can desire respecting the
Islands of New Zealand.
Northern Telegraph.
It is written in an easy and popular style; and from the extent of its
information, and the judicious remarks which are scattered over its pages,
it well deserves a place in the libraries of mechanics’ institutes—not only
as a book of reference, but as a concise and complete history of New
Zealand.


The work in every respect appears to have been carefully drawn up
with a view to practical utility; and the mass of information which has
been compiled is astonishing, when the low price at which the book is
published is considered.
Carmarthen Journal.
Written in a clear, lucid style, equally adapted to the capacity of the
educated capitalist or the farm labourer; and we cordially recommend
it to the notice of those who are anxious to obtain sound and useful
information as to the resources of this flourishing colony.
Hampshire Advertiser.
This pocket companion is too important an affair to be passed over by
us in a mere local paragraph. Money value is not at all times the stan-
dard; and we occasionally find an article is worth ten times more than
it will bring. The reader must not be led away by the title of the book,
and simply imagine that he is to sit down to a sort of “ Bradshaw,” Not
a bit of it; he will agreeably find that he has before him some 160 pages
of capital reading.
Ayr Observer.
Though small in bulk, it is very comprehensive, and so far as we
can judge, it does not commit the error, too common with similar pub-
lications, of painting everything in couleur de rose, but seeks to give a
sober estimate of the advantages of New Zealand as a residence for in-
tending emigrants.
Bath Chronicle.
An honest, straightforward, and well-compiled treatise, which will en-
able the attentive reader to judge for himself, and prevent him from
falling into injurious mistakes. In addition to its practical utility, it
is really an amusing publication, and one well worthy of notice for its
general information respecting the “ Britain of the South.”
Edinburgh Age.
A volume which fully merits its title, and our obligation to which,
in the present paper, we hereby cheerfully and gratefully acknowledge.
Cork Examiner.
A cheap and well-got-up work, containing a copious store of informa-
tion on the history, physical features, animal and vegetable products,
political aspect, system of agriculture, &c., of those glorious islands
which form the New Zealand colony. The book is valuable to the emi-
grant, but contains much worth the perusal of those who study it for
the sake of knowledge only.
Cheltenham Chronicle.
A little work which conveys to the reader a vast amount of useful
knowledge and many practical hints on emigration, combined with many
vivid and picturesque pictures of the country.
Glasgow Herald.
A well-got-up publication, containing a great amount of valuable infor-
mation in little space.
Belfast News Letter.
This admirable little hand-book is a complete emigrant’s guide to New
Zealand.


Stockport Advertiser.
There is a mass of information ; and if the emigrant will only consult
this pamphlet of Messrs. Willis, Gann, and Co., he will find an authentic
and well-arranged description of New Zealand and its prospective wealth.
Cardiff Times.
Information of a reliable character on such a country as New Zea-
land must be invaluable to the intending emigrant; and this book,
which is modestly designated a “Guide,” appears to be well-fitted to
serve as such.
Greenock Herald.
A cheap, neatly got-up guide for emigrants, containing a great deal of
useful information.
Elgin Courier.
An interesting little work issued by Messrs. Willis, Gann, and Co., of
the New Zealand Offices, London, descriptive of these islands as a field
foremigration. This young colony is fast rising into importance; and a
few short extracts from the book illustrative of the features of the country,
may not be uninteresting.
Chronicle and Western Reporter.
A little work which every person desirous of obtaining correct informa-
tion should obtain.
Galway Express.
An excellent little publication, which well deserves the serious attention
of those about to emigrate. The fund of useful information which it
contains is invaluable.
Halifax Courier.
From this hasty sketch it will be seen that the book is one that will
be interesting to the general reader; and not only will it be found valu-
able to the emigrant who has made up his mind to go to New Zealand in
preference to any other colony, but will afford the intending emigrant
solid reasons for selecting this in preference to other places.
Shrewsbury Chronicle.
An exceedingly useful publication to all persons interested in New
Zealand, either as traders or as emigrants to that country. Under the
various heads the most copious information is given.
Stamford Mercury.
Those who contemplate a voyage to the antipodes would do well to
furnish themselves with this useful guide, which contains a sketch of the
history of the colony, and adescription of the several provinces, evidently
written by persons competent to report with force and accuracy the
results of their observations and experience.
Worcester Herald.
It presents the best compression of facts connected with New Zealand
that has yet appeared, and is at once capable of affording a vast deal of
information to intending emigrants, and of adding greatly to the number
of the latter.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
Judging by the greatly increasing number of cor-
respondents now applying to us for “ New Zealan
information,’ ’ it would appear that the supply of works
professing to afford such information is unequal to the
demand. In truth, the few standard books which treat
of the Colony generally, and its advantages as an emi-
gration field, are too costly to come within the reach of
the great body of emigrants; while the numerous
smaller works, are either mere rechauffes of papers
read before some Society or Institute, or little pamphlets
which, being chiefly local in their aim, present a view,
not of New Zealand , but only of some particular part
or Province of New Zealand of which they may happen
to be the advertizing organs.
Under these circumstances we have been induced to
publish the present little work —at a price, too, which
we trust will give it a wide circulation among all classes
of our emigrant countrymen.
Our twenty years’ acquaintance with New Zealand,
and New Zealand emigration, and our frequent personal
communication with the various New Zealand colonists
now so commonly visiting England on trips of pleasure
or business, have, we hope, qualified us to render the
“New Zealand Handbook” an accurate guide to that
youngest but finest Colony of our empire which seems
destined to become the Britain of the South; while as
to the motives we have in seeking to advance the


further colonization of New Zealand ; and our views as
to emigration, generally, we would refer the reader to
our concluding remarks at page 86.
The necessity of our keeping this little publication to
such a size as would allow of its being published at a
price placing it within the reach of all, has compelled
us to treat every subject with careful compression; hut
we beg to observe that when our Readers desire fur-
ther information or advice in any matters relating to
New Zealand, or New Zealand Emigration, we are
always happy to afford it by replying to any communi-
cations addressed to us as below.

PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION.
We regret to say that since these sheets have passed
through the press, the hope expressed at page 6, that the
“Native Outbreak at Taranaki” would be confined to
that Settlement has been disappointed. The Waikato
Tribes, occupying the beautiful country which forms
the great southern portion of the Province of Auckland,
have risen in open rebellion against the Q,ueen, and at
the date of our last advices, in July, were forcing on us
a war which sooner or later must end in their signal
defeat, and bring down on them a punishment which
may vitally affect the destinies of their turbulent and
ungrateful race.
Whatever may be the earlier incidents of the strug-
gle, whatever its final fruits, however much we may
deplore the losses of the northern Settlers, the expendi-
ture of blood and treasure, we shall at least derive some
measure of comfort from the reflection that no Avant of
kindness or forbearance on our part towards a barbarous
people has caused this final appeal to arms.
The history of colonization, from the earliest times
down to the present day, affords no instance where a
just regard for the welfare of the native race has been
so prominent a feature in the settlement of new coun-
tries as it has ever been in New Zealand; and this
“ Waikato Outbreak,” with its cruel murders, springing
as it does from the blind reasoning and brutal passions
of the Maori, affords further and most painful proof of


the difficulty Civilization encounters in its beneficent
efforts to tame the Wild Man and change the nature
of the Savage.
How long the struggle may last it is impossible to
predict —but we are justified in saying that if the
Home Government, by a wise, humane, and econo-
mical policy, will at once strengthen General Cameron
and the Colonists by efficient aid, it is probable that
the fire would speedily be stamped out; and that the
Rebel Hordes might soon receive a lesson which would
instantly and for ever convince them that we were the
stronger people, merciful, too, as strong, and that
British law and order, Missionary teaching and the
smooth humanities of civilization, were better medi-
cines for their dwindling race than embruted barbarism
and a puppet King.
As some further observations on this subject are made
in the appendix at page 84, we need not here enlarge
on it; and may conclude these our brief prefatory
remarks by observing that this Mnth Edition of
the Handbook presents itself with a new map, and
with the latest statistical information of the New
Zealand Blue Book, an admirable publication obligingly
transmitted to us by the colonial Government. Every
care, in short, has been taken with the little Work, in
its present form, to render it worthy of a continuance
of the popularity it has so long enjoyed; and, calling
attention to the last line or two in the preface over
leaf, we issue it in the hope that it will be found a prac-
tically useful guide and text-book for all classes of emi-
grants, from the Capitalist to the Working Man.

NEW ZEALAND HANDBOOK.
CHAPTER I
HISTORICAL SKETCH.
Discovery, Rise akd Progress. —Though New Zealand
was first sighted and named by Tasman, a Dutch ex-
plorer, in the year 1642, the country was only fully
discovered by our illustrious circumnavigator, Captain
Cook, in 1769. Cook visited the islands three times to
recruit his exploring vessels, surveyed a large portion of
the coasts, held a great deal of friendly intercourse with
the natives, and introduced the pig, the potato, and
various European seeds and vegetables.
He formed a high, and a remarkably correct, opinion
of the capabilities of the country for European settle-
ment ; and his report of the genial climate, fertile soil,
fine harbours, and evergreen forests, so captivated the
practical mind of Benjamin Franklin, that the American
philosopher published a proposal for the colonisation of
the newly-discovered Land.
Some years after Cook’s visit, trade and intercourse
began to spring up between Port Jackson (New South
Wales) and New Zealand ; in 1814 the first missionaries
arrived ; and, by degrees, various rude little mixed
communities of sealers, sawyers, runaway sailors, petty
merchants, produce-collectors, et id genus omne, attracted
over from New South Wales, settled themselves along
the coasts, trading and frequently intermarrying with
the natives ; whilst, year by year, the bays and harbours
of the country became the favourite fishing grounds and
recruiting stations of the British, American, Bremen,
and Colonial vessels engaged in the sperm and black whale
fishery. The reports carried home by the Whalers as
R


to the fine harbours, and the forests of magnificent kauri
spars and ship timber, found in the new Islands, the
glowing accounts of the fertility of the soil spread abroad
by the visitors from Australia, and the testimony of the
missionaries as to the bracing salubrity of the climate,
eventually revived in England that desire for the regular
colonisation of the country which Cook and Franklin
had excited so many years before. _ In 1840, an in-
fluential body of public men, including the late Lord
Durham, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, various members
of Parliament, the Barings, Goldsmids, and many of
the leading merchants of London, formed themselves
into an association, called the New Zealand Company,
for the purpose of regularly colonising the islands from
the Mother Country ; whilst at the same time the Go-
vernment formally raised New Zealand into a British
colony, and sent out its first governor in the person of
Captain Hobson of the Eoyal Navy, who planted the
infant Capital of the Colony at Auckland, on the shores
of the noble harbour of the Waitemata.
The New Zealand Company were at first most suc-
cessful in the great enterprise which they had planned.
They acquired from the natives certain tracts of land in
Cook’s Strait, and here they planted their little Settlements
of Wellington and Nelson, Wanganui and Taranaki—
peopling them with five thousand pioneer emigrants of a
stamp better fitted to subdue the wilderness and rough-
hew the foundations of an infant State, than any who
had left the mother country since the days of the
cavalier emigrants of Delaware, or the pilgrim fathers
of Massachusetts.
Unfortunately, however, violent dissensions soon arose
between the Company and the Colonial Office, and
suicidal quarrels soon followed between the Company’s
agents in the southern Settlements and the Government
officials in the north. Two or three of the native tribes,
encouraged by this enfeebling division between the two
new powers which had appeared in the country, assumed
a hostile attitude, ventured to repudiate the sale of the
various districts which the Company’s agents alleged had
been fairly purchased, and committed numerous acts of
trespass and petty violence. The Government authori-
ties, instead of checking these first manifestations of
turbulence with a firm and vigorous hand, pursued a
feeble policy of over-conciliation and non-interference,
until at last the disaffected natives, believing them-


selves to be the stronger power, broke out into open
rebellion. A small military force was brought over from
Australia, and a series of smart skirmishes took place
between the troops (ably supported by b_ands of friendly
natives), and the rebels, led by Hone Heke, Hawiti,
Te Rauperaha and Rhanghiata. Life and property now
became insecure: some of the Company’s pioneer Settlers,
driven from the lands on which they had expended their
little all, now abandoned the country where they had
been half ruined ; others joined the troops and volun-
teered against the rebels; trade, immigration, agricul-
ture, were stopped; and the little fields von from the
wilderness were given the dock and the thistle.
At last, after a gloomy and inglorious period of several
years of misgovernment, anarchy, and confusion, brighter
days began to daAvn. In 1845, an urgent petition from
the remnant of the long-suffering pioneer Colonists Avas
laid before Parliament by the lamented late Charles
Ruller ; it led to a three nights’ debate, and Avas vir-
tually supported by Sir Robert Peel, Lord John Russell,
Earl Grey, and a large majority,both in the Commons and
the Peers. The Colonial Office “ aborigines-protecting ”
policy of pampering the natives to the destruction of
the Colonists Avas renounced, Captain Eitzroy (second
governor) was superseded by Sir George Grey, addi-
tional troops were sent out, and the rebel natives were
mildly chastised and induced to sue for peace. Trade
and agriculture, the progress of settlement and the arts
of peace, Avhich had long drooped so loav, noiv began to
revive. The Scotch Settlement of Otago was planted
in 1846, the Settlement of Canterbury was planted a
few years later, and about 1850 the robust young Colony,
which had battled its way through such an Iliad of
disasters, began a career of quick and solid progress,
which, assuming that the present “Native Troubles”
end as it is hoped, is not likely, we think, to receive
any permanent or serious check.
In 1851 the Australian gold discoveries took place,_
and at once gave a great impetus to every branch oi
industry in Ncav Zealand. In 1853 the new Constitu-
tion, described hereafter, came into force, and placed
half * the government of the Colony in the hands of the
* We say half, because the Constitution provides that “ Native affairs”
shall be left to the Crown—the wisdom ot Parliament having thought
that this department of State could be managed better by a Colonial
Minister sitting in Downing Street, 10,000 miles away from the scene or
action, than by Colonists legislating on the spot.

Colonists. In this year, too, Sir George Grey, after
an able career of several years in South Australia
and New Zealand, proceeded home, and was promoted
to the Governorship of the Cape. Lieut.-Colonel Wyn-
yard, commander of the troops, then became Governor,
pro tem. He brought into operation the New Constitu-
tion, and in 1855 this gallant officer was succeeded by
Lieut.-Colonel Thomas George Browne, whose adminis-
tration of affairs was unfortunately disturbed by the
outbreak at Taranaki.
Among the North American Indians, among the Kaffirs
in our South African colonies, among all the dark-skin
aboriginal races with whom we have come in con-
tact in the work of colonisation, while there have ever
been tribes “ friendly” to the White Man and to the new
order of things, thp peace and security, the comfort and
wealth, which, in these later days of colonisation, he
has everywhere introduced, there have also been tribes
of the same people, more blinded by superstition, more
wedded to their ancient barbarisms, who have looked on
the White Man with hatred or suspicion; and this, to
some extent, has been the case in New Zealand. During
Governor Wynyard’s time, it was observed that certain
of the Waikato, Ngatiawa, and Taranaki tribes were
growing insolent and disaffected ; and, at last, in Go-
vernor Browne’s reign, these natives, banded with some
others, threw off their allegiance to Victoria the Queen,
and coolly proclaimed an old Waikato chief, Te Potatau,
their Idng. As his Majesty’s court and subjects were a
long way off in the “Bush,” the new Sovereignty did
not much incommode the Colonists ; while the Govern-
ment, hoping that the Missionaries would be able to
laugh the pretentious rebels out of their ungrateful folly,
suffered old Te Potatau to paint himself all the colours
of the rainbow, to hoist his Hag, and assume the Meri
sceptre of the Maori King.
Mischief soon spreads, however, —the reptile’s harmless
egg becomes the reptile, “ replete with high concocted
venom,” and, as time went on, this half-comic King Mov-
ement, unnoticed by the Government as the Natives thought
through fear, attained at last such dimensions as embol-
dened the King Party to declare that, for the future,
native owners of land should not be permitted to sell
any portion thereof to the Crown —an ukase which, if it
were to be made good by force, could not fail, sooner or
later, to bring the rebels into collision with the Crown.


This, indeed, it did at once, for on Governor Browne at-
tempting to take possession of certain land* in the pro-
vince of Taranaki, which the Crown had purchased from
the native owners, he was resisted by armed bands, and
driven back.
Of necessity, troops were then sent for, the provincial
militia called out, and a volunteer corps formed. The
Ngatiawa rebels were reinforced by allies from the King
Party in Waikato and by the plundering hordes of Tara-
naki, and war broke out. After many skirmishes,
and grievous destruction of Settlers’ property, ; the rebels
were discomfited; and as Governor Browne’s term of
office was about to expire, and as it Avas thought that
Governor Grey’s old influence over the Natives might
now prove useful, he' resumed the Governorship of
New Zealand, and,'after an absence of about five years,
landed in the Colony again in the year ’6l.
Apparently, his influence by degrees made itself felt:
certain of the chiefs who had covertly supported the
King Movement professed their intention of abandon-
ing it; certain popular alterations in the law affecting
the sale and title of native lands_ were gladly effected
by the Colonial Legislature ; and it Avas expected that
the incipient Rebellion Avould dwindle aAvay into in-
significance, and that such of the Tribes as had taken
part in it Avould resume their allegiance to the Queen,
Avelcome the introduction of British law and order into
their villages, and gradually unite Avith the Colonists
in the peaceful Avork of reclaiming the Avilderness and
extending civilization over the whole of the magnificent
Island in which they were planted.
In one province of the North Island, however, these
hopes, for a while at least, will not be fulfilled. Just at
the time when Colonists and “friendly” Natives were
beginning to congratulate themselves that the sky was
clearing, the June mail brought the gloomy news that a
brutal murder of two officers and six men of _ the troops
stationed at New Plymouth by the Taranaki natives —
* A district called the Waitera, which part of the Ngatiawa tribe as-
serted to be their own, and which they had long urged the Government
to buy. The right and title of the selling Natives to dispose of this Land
was duly investigated by Governor Browne and his ministerial advisers,
and believed to be perfect; and though Governor Grey has since given it
up to the Natives opposed to the sale, on the ostensible ground of doubts
as to the Sellers’ title, it is very generally believed in the Colony that
the title was substantially good, and that Governor Grey’s surrender of
theAVaitera was partly a sop, or bribe, or peace-offering to the rebel Na-
tives—a piece of policy, we fear, exceedingly likely to produce exactly
the opposite effect pf that which was hoped for.


the most braggart and embruted of all the tribes in
New Zealand—had relit the torch of war.
We sincerely trust that this renewed disturbance will
not spread beyond the province where it originated.
Auckland, Wellington, and Hawkes’ Bay will, we hope,
remain as unscathed by this second outbreak at Tara-
naki as they were by the first, while the native troubles
of the North Island but little more affect the people
of the South than a rebellion in Kerry might affect
people of Kent. Indeed, the most probable and
desirable termination of the affair will be the inflic-
tion of such a long-merited, long-forborne punishment
on the ruffian tribes of Taranaki as will show the
Maori, from Cape Palliser to Cape Beinga, that though
we love best the arts of peace we have not neglected
the arts of war ; and that while our desire now, as ever,
is to do unto him as we would have others do unto us,
the British Crown will maintain order and security in
every province of the Colony, and allow no man, Settler
or Savage, to trample on the law.
Such is the short outline of the history of New Zea-
land from Cook’s time down to the present day. It has
been asserted, by practical men who have seen New
Zealand after visiting other colonies, that if common
good government from the first had spared the early
disasters we have alluded to, the physical advantages of
the young country, her soil and climate, her natural gifts,
might by this time have attracted to her a population of
half a million of the flower of our British emigrants.
Though, however, the deplorable misgovernment of
New Zealand in her first days terribly crippled her
progress, and inflicted calamitous losses on her pio-
neer Settlers, it has, perhaps, produced a counter, a
beneficial, effect in making her, in some ways, a better
emigration field for those who are emigrating now.
Had it not been for this early misgovernment, the popu-
lation of the Colony might well have been five-fold wha t it
is, when, necessarily, there would have been a five-fold
appropriation of the best lands. Families emigrating to
New Zealand in 1864 will find a population sufficiently
large to have subdued the roughness of the wilderness,
to have_ secured law and order, to have established society
and social institutions, to have founded numerous thriv-
ing Settlements, and to have raised annual exports of the
value of between two and three millions sterling—but
they will not find a population sufficiently large as in
the United States and in the older emigration fields of


Canada and Australia to have taken the cream of the
country by monopolizing town and village sites and the
crack agricultural “estate-creating” lands. The present
population of New Zealand amounts to scarcely 140,000
Colonists, planted in a few spots of a country almost
as large as the United Kingdom ; and millions of acres,
equal to the production of thirty bushels of wheat or the
grazing of five sheep per acre are yet without trace of
plough or fleece.
CHAPTER 11.
POSITION.—SIZE. —NATURAL EEATURES.—CLIMATE.
Position.— New Zealand, as show r nby the accompanying
map, consists of two large islands, the north and the
south, parted by Cook’s Strait, a line deep-sea channel
some 150 miles long by from 20 to 100 broad : and of a
small island called Stewart’s Island, about the size of
Hampshire, parted from the main by Foveaux Strait.*
The position of the country is one of the finest in the
world. A popular writer says —“ Estimating the advan-
tages of position, extent, climate, fertility, adaptation
for trade —all the causes which have tended to render
Britain the emporium of the world —we can observe only
one other spot on the earth equally, if not more favoured
by nature, and that is New Zealand. Serrated with
harbours, securely insulated, having a climate tempered
by surrounding ocean, of such extent and fertility as to
support a population sufficiently numerous to defend its
shores against any possible invading force, New Zealand,
like Great Britain, lies contiguous to a large neighbour-
ing continent, Australia, from which it will draw
resources, and to which it bears the relation of a rich
homestead, with a vast extent of outfield pasturage. In
these advantages it equals Britain, while it is superior
to Britain in having the weather gage of an immense
commercial field: the rich islands of the Pacific, the
silver regions of South America, the marts of India and
the India Archipelago, the vast accumulations of China
and Japan, the Californian El Dorado, British Columbia,
Sydney and Melbourne, Ballarat and Bendigo, are all
within a few weeks’ or a few days’ sail.”
Size. —The latitudinal length of New Zealand is nearly
* Tli® Chatham Islands, too, lying about 400 miles east of Canterbury,
are now officially included within the bounds of the Colony of New
Zealand,


1000 miles, the greatest breadth is about 200, * the sweep
of the coast line embraces 1500 leagues. The country
possesses an area of about 70 millions of acres; thus,
it is nearly as large as the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Ireland, and probably three-fourths of
this great territory are more or less fitted for Agri-
cultural and Pastoral pursuits.
Physical Features, —New Zealand, while exhibiting
some noble open plains and numerous fine undulating
champaign districts, may be described, generally, as a
wooded-highland country, clothed with luxuriant, ever-
green vegetation. Its origin was volcanic, several of
the small elevations being old extinct craters, and
shocks of earthquake being still occasionally experi-
enced. They are now confined, however, chiefly to the
country around Wellington; and though in the last
twenty years two have been severe enough to occasion
the loss of three or four lives, the inhabitants of Wel-
lington appear to regard them with less apprehension
than we might regard the prospect of a wet harvest or a
bleak spring,
Numerous wooded ranges of moderate elevation, and
three snow-capped giants, liuapehu, Tongariro, and
Mount Egmont, are found in the North Island ; whilst a
chain of rugged forest ranges, displaying'that New Zea-
land monarch of mountains, Mount Cook, 14,000 feet
high, extends along the entire coast of the South Island,
from Dusky Bay to Cape Farewell.
The North Island contains only two or three mode-
rately extensive plains ; but abounds in large luxuriant
valleys, and in sheltered dells and dales. The South
Island, on its western side, consists chiefly of wooded
Alpine regions—but on the east, it displays some noble
plains and open districts admirably adapted for the
plough and the golden fleece.
Owing to the coast line of 4000 miles, and to the divi-
sion of the country into three portions by the fine chan-
nels of Cook’s and Foveaux Straits, New Zealand exhibits
a multitude of bays, creeks, coves, estuaries, and anchor -
* In Dr. Thompson’s work, advertised at the end, the greatest breadth
of the North Island is erroneously stated to be 300 miles. Various
little compilations and publications have repeated this palpable mistake ;
and, further, have added that the greatest breadth of the M iddle (the South
Island, as we think it should be named), was from 250 to 300 miles. Now, in
the North Island the greatest breadth, east and west, is, from Tolago Bay
to Tenia Point, a little south of the parallel of 38°, and here the breadth
of the island is about 200 miles. In the Middle (the South) Island, the
greatest breadth is from Cape Saunders to Cape West, just north of the
parallel of 46°, and here the breadth is about 210 miles.


ages, and possesses some of the finest naval and com-
mercial harbours in the world—though these latter are
found rather in isolated groups than in equally dispersed
order along the coasts.
One of the most striking natural features of the coun-
try is the abundance both of water and of water power.
The Thames, Waikato, Kaipara, Hokianga, Wanganui,
Manawatu, Pelorus, and Clutha, are perhaps the only
rivers navigable 50 miles up for anything larger than
a canoe; but there are some fine lakes, such as
Taupo, 30 miles long by 20 broad, and Rotorua, in the
South Auckland country, together with Wanako,
Hawea, Wakatip, and Te Anau near the gold districts
of Otago—while from north to south the country is
studded with rivers, rivulets, brooks, and burns, gene-
rally of the clearest, softest water, running over pebbly
beds, and bearing a close resemblance to many of our
trout and salmon streams, such as the Dove, Tamar,
Deveron, Tweed, Don, and Dee.
Climate. —In making choice of any new country in
which to improve our fortunes and plant a home, good-
ness of climate ought to be one of our first considera-
tions. With the great majority of emigrants, however,
it is one of the last considerations. As a people, we en-
joy robust health in this country; but we do not seem to
be awake to the fact that we owe this great gift partly
to our temperate and bracing climate. We accept our
health as if we were entitled to it, and scarce care to
inquire how or whence it comes. When we think of
emigrating, our first question is, Can we get rich there ?
our last, Is the climate good there ? —the order of the
inquiry should be reversed. A good climate is a rich
gift in the old country we may leave; but it is a
far richer gift in the new country we may move to, and
these truths are aptly put in the following passage from
a popular work on New Zealand. .
“ In old countries like England art may certainly
lessen our dependence on climate. If we are to dine
with a friend three counties off, snow, sleet, or rain,
we step into a flying parlour, and are borne to the feast
without a feather ruffled. If, instead of flowers, Spring
bring us bitter east blasts, we pile up the tire, andhyber-
nate in warm snuggeries through a vernal winter; while
for coughs, colds, ague, and bronchitis, ‘ M.D.’ is round
the corner. In England, too, half the people have no
climate —they pass their lives in shops, offices, mines,


mills, and manufactories, where science has taken hot
and cold air, and cooked up an artificial substitute for
climate. But in new emigration countries, where we
lead a wholesome out-door life, and face the weather
in the fields ; where, instead of brick and slate, it may
be weather-board and shingle; where we have to “rough”
it more, and where the doctor is not always at hand in
the next our dependence on climate is almost ab-
solute. And in making choice of any new Land to
which to emigrate, Goodness of Climate should un-
questionably rank as one of our very first requirements
—for on this will depend our health and strength, and
on the continued enjoyment of health and strength will
mainly depend our happiness and success.”
The climate of New Zealand has been well described
in one sentence as the climate of England with half the
cold of the English winter; and in suitability for the
people of the British isles, in recruiting or sanatory
properties for the invalid, and in marked fitness for
agricultural and pastoral pursuits, it unquestionably
deserves to rank as one of the finest climates in the
world.
Temperature. —The summer is not sensibly warmer
than a warm English summer in the South of England,
whilst the winter is seldom colder than a cold, wet, and
boisterous English March, or sharp, cold October. New
Zealand being nearly the antipodes of England, the sun is
north instead of south at noon, the north is the warmest
quarter, and the seasons are, of course, reversed —July
being the coldest month, January, the harvest month, the
hottest. _ All native trees and plants being evergreens,
there being no autumnal fall of the leaf, the country
appearing almost equally green at all periods of the
year, the change of seasons is far less marked than in
England, and is, indeed, so gradual as to be scarcely
appreciable. September, October, and November are,
however, generally called spring; December, January,
and February, summer; March, April, and May, au-
tumn; June, July, and August, winter.
“New Zealand,” says Dr. Thompson, “although
famous for its climate, has had few careful meteoro-
logical observers. At Nelson, Samuel Stephens, Esq.
made, during eleven years, an excellent series of ob-
servations. At Auckland a Meteorological Register was
commenced, in 1853, by the officers of the Royal Engi-
neers, under instructions from England. Captain Drury,

As, however, the clearest idea of the climate of a new
country is best conveyed to many people by telling them
what plants it will
grow and ripen, and what it will
not, we beg our readers’
remarks
attention to
the following


New Zealand produces, in perfection, every English-
grown grain, grass, fruit, and vegetable. "Wheat,
potatoes, onions, apples, plums, peaches, and their
congeners, are excellent in.quality, and the peach bears
profusely as a standard. The vine thrives in the
open air a little, but only a little, better than it does in
England; while in' the gardens of the warmer valleys
of the hotter north, the horticulturist would probably
succeed in raising fruits of such a semi-tropical charac-
ter as the pomegranate, citron, loquat, orange, and olive.
Maize (Indian corn), the Taro, a native of the Sandwich
Islands, and the Kumera, a sweet potato, are partially
cultivated by the natives in sheltered sunny spots of the
North Island ; but under common field cultivation, Maize,
a plant affording one of the nicest tests of heat of
climate, will not generally ripen in New Zealand, and
never appears there, a farmer’s common crop, as it
does in Australia, America, and other countries where
the summer and autumnal heat is more steady,
permanent, and intense. Geraniums and myrtles, at-
taining a shrub size, and various delicate plants, which
require the green-house in England, flourish through
the winter in the open air; and generally it may be said
that the few fruits and plants which will grow in New
Zealand, but which will not grow in England, are not
those which require more summer heat, but those which
require less winter cold.
"Winds and Frost. —The southern coasts are subject
to boisterous gales of cold wet wind called “southerly
bursters,” and New Zealand, or rather that coast-lying
portion of New Zealand which is the only part of the
country as yet climatically known to us,* is undoubtedly
a more windy country than England —a disagreeable
feature in the climate, but one which may partly account
for its extraordinary salubrity.
In the colder parts of the South Island, as in Eng-
land, ice and snow come in winter; but in the North
Island, except on the high mountain ranges, ice and
snow are seldom or never seen.
Rain and Moisture. —The inch fall of rain is greater
than in England, but there are more dry days: the
* Inland, the climate would be found warmer in summer; and, pro-
bably, calmer, dryer, and more frosty in winter. It would appear, too,
that the seasons are more forward in the interior; in the explorations of
the country, forest fruits and berries have always been found riper as
the surveyors left the coast and advanced into the interior.


average number of days in the year when no rain falls
being about 180 in England, and 250 in New Zealand.
This greater fall of rain occasionally leads to an erroneous
idea that New Zealand is necessarily a damp country.
The climate, especially as compared with the climate of
dry, scorched-up Australia, is unquestionably a moist
one ; but in any climatically-injurious sense New Zea-
land cannot be called a damp country. “It must be
remembered,” says Mr. Hursthouse, “that New Zea-
land is a hilly country, drained by countless streams,
that much of the soil is light, and that either by sea-
breeze or land-breeze, the atmosphere is kept in per-
petual motion. Thus by the tripartite and simultaneous
action of natural water-course drainage, of percolation,
and evaporation, the effects of the heaviest rain soon
disappear ; and an amount of rain-fall is received and
disposed of, which, if it fell in a country of retentive
undrained plains, with a sluggish atmosphere-such, for
instance, as the fens of Lincolnshire—might cause great
floods, and create a raw dampness of air productive of
ague and fatal to the invalid.” In Dr. Thompson’s
work, too, quoted over leaf, he uses these words —“ the
moisture of the New Zealand climate is evidenced by
the luxuriousness of its vegetation and the heavy night-
dews—but this moisture is a very different thing from
the raw dampness of many countries; it produces an
exquisite softness of the skin, and the inhabitants rarely
suffer from that unpleasant ‘ glazed ’ feeling of the cuti-
cle so often experienced in hot, dry countries.”
Indeed, no better evidence of the fact of the climate
being the reverse of a climate injuriously damp need
be sought than that which we find in the work of this
gentleman, where he shows that an obstinate form of
ague which the troops brought with them to the Colony
from their old station at Tilbury Eort was soon eradi-
cated by the air of Auckland; and where, too, by his
sanatory tables, we see, that cases of pectoral disease
are singularly rare in New Zealand.
Fogs are seldom seen; and thunder storms are even
less frequent and severe than in the British Isles. There
is but little twilight; in summer, it is dark about an
hour sooner than in England, in winter, about an hour
later.
Difference op Climate.— Nelson, Taranaki, and
Auckland, are said ; by some, to enjoy the finest climates ;
and, when the native troubles are over in the North Is-

land, invalids or delicate emigrants might do well to settle
in one or other of these Provinces. Both in salubrity
and pleasantness, however, the climate of any part of
New Zealand, except perhaps of th.c extremest south,
is unquestionably superior to the climate of even the
finest parts of Great Britain ; and none but the deli-
cate or consumptive need he influenced in their choice of
Province by any climatic superiority which one Province
may he said to possess over another.
Salubrity. —The salubrity of the climate is a feature
which families who emigrate to the Continent to escape
the British winter, would, we think, do well to study.
The 58th and 65th Regiments were stationed in New
Zealand many years, and the following officially-com-
piled tables of the health of troops quartered in different
parts of the world, taken from Dr. Thompson’s work,
prove the salubrity of the climate in a remarkable man-
ner, and have already been the means of attracting a
considerable number of invalid families and people of
delicate health to settle in the Colony.
GENERAL MORTALITY.
Number of Soldiers in 1000 who Annually Die from Different Diseases
on various Military Stations:—
CON SUMPTION.
Number of Soldiers in 1000 Annually attacked, and the Number
who Annually die from Consumption on various Stations;—
Attacked. Deaths.
The large families of the colonists, and the robust
appearance of the children, tend to corroborate the
extraordinary conclusion forced on us by these military
statistics. Some years ago, the Registrar’s returns, for
one of the Settlements, Otago, showed that among 1250


children under 14, there were only 7 deaths in the year,
or about 1 in every 180. The total number of deaths per
1000 was about 6 ; while the total number of births per
1000 was nearly 45. The returns for another Settlement,
New Plymouth, showed that while in the year 1856 the
total number of deaths among a population of 2500 souls
was 14, the total number of births was 120. Families
have left even Madeira to settle in New Zealand, and
already many hundreds of people from Nova Scotia and
our North American possessions,* influenced partly by
climatic considerations, have actually re-emigrated
15,000 miles across the ocean to settle in the Province
of Auckland.
The climate, indeed, seems to act as a powerful and
permanent restorative on shattered or delicate constitu-
tions, and we have little doubt that as New Zealand
* This extraordinary emigration movement from Nova Scotia, ap-
pears to be spreading to Canada. In an address of the Superinten-
dent of the Auckland Province to his Provincial Council there
occurs this passage:—‘‘lt is known that the agent for a large number
of intending immigrants from Canada has for some time past been
seeking to have a suitable location in this Province set apart, so that
he might be able to advise his principals that on their arrival here no
difficulty would be found in obtaining sufficient land upon which they
might settle in a body. Already an experiment in this mode of colonisa-
tion by small communities has been tried with success in the Wahgarei
district by immigrants from Nova Scotia, amongst whom the beneficial
effects of unity of purpose, mutual support, and hearty co-operation in
overcoming the difficulties incident to a new Settlement, have been
strikingly developed.”
More lately, too, a gentleman has placed himself in correspondence
with us, whose own case seems to show that there are English settlers in
even the finest parts of the United States who think of abandoning that
country and of removing to New Zealand. This gentleman represents
a party of Scotch and English families residing in Ohio ; he has sailed
for New Zealand on a visit of inspection, and he tells us that if his re-
port of the country be satisfactory, his Ohio friends, to the number of
some fifty families, have decided on selling their properties there and
joining him.
But it is not only from our North American Colonies that New Zealand
is beginning to attract people: quite independently of her gold fields,
and, indeed, years before gold was discovered, she had drawn over many
excellent colonists from Australia; while we have reason to believe that
if the communication between the Cape Colony and New Zealand were
more frequent and easy, many Cape settlers would be found exchanging
South Africa for our young Britain of the South.


becomes more known in Europe, the Colony will become
the Sanatorium for a large body of those who may be
termed wealthy invalid-emigrants—families who, culti-
vating a few acres for pleasant occupation near the towns,
and profiting by the fine scenery, the good society, and
good social institutions of the young Land, will invest
their capitals, as may safely be done, at £lO and £l2 per
cent., and so nurse up both purse and person.
CHAPTER 111.
NATIVES. —ANIMAL, VEGETABLE, AND MINED AL
KINGDOMS.
The Natives. —The New Zealanders, or Maories, as
they call themselves, a People of Malay origin, are sup-
posed to have emigrated in canoes from Hawaii, ons of
the Sandwich Islands, about 500 years ago.
_ Split up into numerous petty tribes, their chief pas-
time and pursuit seems ever to have been that of de-
stroying each other ; and until they were brought under
the influence of the missionaries and the early colo-
nists, about a quarter of a century ago, the war-club
appears to have been ever in their hands. Owing
mainly to these internecine feuds, their numbers have
been so reduced, that the entire population does not
now amount to more than 56,000, all of whom, with
the exception of a few hundreds, are located in the
North Island.
In personal appearance they are not unlike burly,
well-bronzed gypsies, and in physical, and indeed in
some mental, qualities, they are perhaps the finest race
of aborigines with whom the Anglo-Saxon has ever
mixed in the work of colonisation. Cannibalism has
long been an extinct custom, and many of them pay
a most sanctimonious attention to Sabbath observances
and the externals of Christian worship. Many of the
young people can read and write their own language,
while the Bible, though now sometimes quoted by them
in the way that a certain satanic Personage is said to
quote Scripture, has become a pretty familiar book
to all.
By the treaty made with them by the Crown, when


New Zealand was proclaimed a Colony, and they prof-
fered the sovereignty of the country to the Queen,
both Islands were formally admitted to be their pro-
perty, and the Crown pledged itself to acquire all lands
needed for colonisation only by the way of purchase.
This agreement has been sacredly observed. The whole
of the South Island, where, virtually, there was no native
population, was acquired in this manner; but full
four-fifths of the North Island is still their own,
though they neither use, nor have much chance
of ever requiring to use, a tenth part of the
magnificent districts they there possess. _ Independ-
ently, too, of this noble, though unfruitful landed
estate, they own a considerable property in stock, cul-
tivations, coasting vessels, flour-mills, and specie ; some
few, even, have accounts at the bank, others have been
known to take shares in local companies; and for an
aboriginal race, they are not only saucily well-off, but
even wealthy.
In the neighbourhood of the Settlements, they are
adopting articles of European dress; but they still
everywhere cling to their piggish habits of domestic
life. Performing but a trifling amount of labour for
the Colonists, when they work at all, they wmrk chiefly
for themselves, raising a considerable quantity of pro-
duce for the markets, and purchasing a considerable
quantity of tobacco, groceries, blankets, and clothing in
return. Men, women, and children are arrant smokers,
and some of them are by no means averse to rum; but,
at present at least, and as a people, they are not to be
called intemperate, and will sometimes take part in the
races and regattas of the Colonists without contribut-
ing' to the sight a drunken man.*
Despite the wealth of the Maories, however, despite
their noble freeholds of stream and forest, their ability
to surround themselves with European comforts, and
their perfect freedom from all shadow of oppression by
a dominant race, they are still, we think, a slowly-de-
creasing people ; and the infatuated desire that a largo
portion of them are now evincing to laugh at Missionary
influence and Missionary teaching, to relapse into Bar-
barism, and defy that mild and beneficent British rule
by which they have so largely benefited, may possibly
* Fearing that the progress of civilization and their visits to the towns
might lead to their acquiring that universal taste for fire-water which
has proved such a curse to the North-American Indians, the Colonial
Legislature has passed a law prohibiting the sale of spirits to them.

result in certain necessary, repressive, measures on the
part of the Government, the ultimate effects of which
may be to hasten the progress of their decrease. Old
Colonists, indeed, assert that half a century hence,
without there be some amalgamation of the races, there
will not be much of the Maori blood left, and that in a
few years the Native will exercise no greater influence
in New Zealand than the nomad Gipsy race may do in
Britain.*
Animals. —It is a singular fact that a large country
like New Zealand abounding in food and covert for
game, and having a climate singularly favourable to
the existence of a varied and extensive Fauna, should
not possess a single indigenous wild animal. Indeed,
with the exception of two or three harmless lizards,
the Kiore, a small and now scarce rat, is the only four-
footed native creature found in either of the great
islands.
To make amends for this deficiency, however, New
Zealand is equally destitute of reptiles, and would
seem, like Ireland, to enjoy St. Patrick’s blessing.
There is not a single snake of any description, and not
even an insect so noxious as the common English wasp.
Eats, first brought in by the ships, have, happily, taken
to the forest rather than to the barn, and are now
found in great numbers in some of the wild regions of
the interior.
The pig, originally introduced by Cook, straying from
the native _ villages and breeding in the forests, has
become a wild animal in many of the remote districts;
and the cat, though to a much smaller extent, and per-
haps even a few cattle, electing to become Ferae Naturae,
have followed the unworthy example of the pig.
Pheasant, partridge, quail, and a few red and
fallow deer, have been introduced by spirited Colo-
nists. The pheasants have thriven famously in Auck-
land ; the red deer have bred in Nelson, the fallow
have been seen in the Wairarapa and elsewhere;
and looking at the genial climate, at the profusion
of water, of evergreen cover, and of wild forest food,
and at the absence of game-destroying vermin and
* The most interesting description of the native race, their habits,
and customs, is given in Dr. Thompson’s excellent hook, and in a
work called "Te Ika a Maui,” by the Rev. Richard Taylor; while the
best political history of the people in relation to the early colonisation of
the islands, and the fullest account of the causes of the native outbreak in
Taranaki, appear in the second edition of Mr. Hursthouse’s work, “ New
Zealand the Britain of the South.”


beasts of prey, we have little doubt that New Zealand,
in a few years, will afford good sport in covert and
stubble, and an occasional shot for the deer-stalker on
the hills.
Bibds. —There are 83 species of birds, comprising
three or four varieties of hawks, and as many of parrots
and rails. The bell-bird and the tui are fine song-
sters; and the wood pigeon (a noble fellow), a dozen
varieties of wild duck, and here and there in the South
Island a few grass quail, now very scarce though, afford
the Settlers, even at present, a little amusement with
the gun. Some of our smaller birds, and some of our
finest poultry, the latter abundant now all over the
Colony, have been carried over by various of our emi-
grant friends ; and the rook, sparrow, finch, lark, black-
bird, and thrush might now be freely introduced with
great advantage to gardens and farms, and the lovers
of English sights and sounds.
Insects. —The insects are much like those of Eng-
land, and are about as numerous. Sand-flies and
mosquitoes are found in the bush and about new clear-
ings, but soon disappear before cultivation. Ants are
rarely seen, and there are no hornets, wasps, or earwigs.
The circada (a noisy summer chirper), the weta, a most
ugly and suspicious-looking creature, but quite harm-
less, and the koeke, a flying grasshopper, are the three
most foreign-looking members of the entomology. The
common garden bee, introduced with signal success, now
frequently swarms in the woods, and here and there
stores a forest tree with the finest honey.
Fish, —The streams are poor in fish. Fine eels are
common in almost every brook; but with this ex-
ception, and that of the Upokororo, a sort of grayling,
and some excellent whitebait, the thousand and one
streams of New Zealand scarce afford a fish worth
catching. Sea fish, however, are plentiful, and the
Hapuka, and three or four other varieties, would be
counted good in Billingsgate. Lobsters are not found,
and crabs and shrimps are small and worthless; but
the finest of cray-fish, cockles, and mussels abound,
while the rock oysters of certain localities are equal to
the best of our own.
Vegetable Kingdom. —New Zealand is the land of
greenwood. Vegetation runs riot: _ sea-spray crags,
shore-margins, plains, valleys, mountain-steeps, are alike
clothed •with perpetual verdure ; and the teeming growth
c 2


and vigorous freshness of the wild shrubberies and
forests have been the admiration of every visitor since
the days of Cook. Of plants, from humble shrub and
creeping daisy up to the king of trees, the noble kauri,
there are nearly 650 distinct evergreen species ; and it is
worthy of remark that nature seeming expressly to have
fitted the islands for colonisation by endowing them with
a mild and bracing climate, and with an Animal King-
dom devoid of noxious beast or creature, has been
equally provident in the Vegetable Kingdom for as in
the one there is no venomous reptile, so in the other
there is no poisonous plant.* # . ,
In England there are scarcely 40 varieties ot indi-
genous trees —in New Zealand, including shrubs over
twenty feet high, there are upwards of a 100 ; and
of these probably half are trees attaining a size large
enough to entitle them to rank as forest trees.
Among the most common timber trees in present use
are the Kauri, and the lied and the AVhite Pine (fre-
quently displaying clear branchless stems 80 feet long
by 5 in diameter, and without a knot), adapted for
every purpose of house and ship building; the Punri,
or iron wood, equal in durability to teak or oak; the Rata
and the Pohutukawa, used for ship-timbers and wheel-
wrights’ purposes; the Kohekohe, and others, used for
shingles, split-stuff, and fencing ; and the Totara and a
variety of fancy woods, adapted for general purposes,
for furniture and turnery.
Amongthe smaller trees and tree-shrubs, called “Light
Bush,” growing about the edges of the great forest, or
clothing the dells and valleys of the open country, are
found three varieties of the beautiful Fern-tree, often
80 feet high, the elegant Nikau, the sweet-scented
Manuka, the fruity Poroporo, the laurel-like Karaka,
the Ngaio, the fragrant Veronica, and the gigantic
Myrtle; and these beautiful evergreens, intermingled
with the English rose, laurel, lilac, and laburnum, form
shrubberies around the New Zealand cottages of a beauty
and variety impossible to describe.
The common Fern, the wild Flax, the Tutu, the Ti
* The only known exception is the Tutu, injurious to fresh-landed
sheep and cattle. The berry of this plant is not unlike the elder berry ;
its seeds are poisonous, and the children of any newly-arrived emigrants,
living where the shrub is cotninon, should be cautioned against eating
the berry. The juice, expressed by the natives and then boiled with
a certain delicate sea-weed, makes a pink jelly, held to be rather a native
delicacy.


tree (a sort of palm), the Toetoe and Raupo (useful
thatching and hut-building plants), and about twenty
varieties of wild grazing grasses, form the most com-
mon vegetation of the plains and valleys. The Fern,
more or less intermingled with the latter plants, covers
immense districts in both islands, and frequently at-
tains a height of live and six feet. The root (softened in
the embers) was formerly the chief bread substance of
the natives, and is still the chief provender of the wild
pig.
The Wild Flax, Phormium tenax, is a flag-like shrub,
throwing out a bunch of splendid leaves four and five
feet long by three inches broad, and bearing a pro-
fusion of pink blossoms, much frequented _ by the
bee. This is the plant which, before the introduc-
tion of blankets and European clothing, supplied
the natives with the material for their mats and gar-
ments. In its green state, strips of it tied together
are commonly used by the colonists as rough string,
and a great and increasing portion of the rope and cord-
age required by the fleet of coasting vessels is now manu-
factured in the Colony from the prepared fibre. The
fibre is reputed to be the strongest vegetable substance
known; and from the luxuriant abundance of the plant,
its quickness of growth, and improvability by culti-
vation, it is expected that the preparation and export of
the fibre will eventually become an important branch of
colonial industry.
In addition to the number of valuable trees and plants
indigenous to Hew Zealand, her vegetable kingdom has
received great extension by the introduction of exotics.
Many of the ornamental Australian shrubs, sxieh as blue
{qim, acacia, Norfolk Island pine, and many of our Eng-
ish trees, such as elm, beech, willow, fir, ash, and oak, are
already introduced. Every grain, fruit, flower, and vege-
table of the British Isles is now seen in full perfection
in the fields, orchards, and gardens ; cresses mantle the
little homestead brooks, and mushrooms abound in the
pastures; whilst clover, turnip, cabbage, carrots, pinach,
mint, thyme, and various stray vegetables and garden
plants, spreading themselves over the country in some
apparently unaccountable manner, are found in many
districts mixed up with the indigenous vegetation of the
country, and threatening to oust even the vigorous
natives of the soil.


Mineral Kingdom. —The Key. Richard Taylor, in
his able treatise on the Geology of New Zealand,
states, that from the peculiar formation of the country,
coal, copper, gold, and the precious metals probably
exist in abundance ; while the present Admiral Eitzrqy,
when Governor of New Zealand, in one of his dis-
patches to the then Colonial Minister, the present Earl
of Derby, says; —“Beneath the productive surface of
these teeming islands are mineral stores as yet hardly
known. If, from merely scratching projecting corners
of the land, some dozen valuable minerals have been
discovered—coal, iron, silver, lead, tin, copper, nickel,
manganese, alum, and sulphur—what may not be an-
ticipated after a few years of research in the in-
terior?”
The early troubles alluded to in our Historical
Sketch, the comparative scarcity of capital and labour,
the necessity of the first Settlers in a new country limit-
ing their enterprise to such works as the building of
houses, the growth of food, the making of roads, the
founding of village and town, have hitherto prevented
the mineral wealth of the Colony from being turned
to much account. Nevertheless, sufficient evidence is
even now before us to show that these early predictions
of scientific men are likely to he realized, and that,
some day, New Zealand may become a colony where
mining pursuits will rank second only to pastoral and
agricultural.
Good lime and building stone, sulphur, plumbago,
ochres, and various useful earths and clays are abund-
ant; while the four most valuable minerals which a
country can possess —coal, iron, copper, gold—have
already been found in both islands. Coal (required in
New Zealand for the development of a steam marine
rather than for fuel, the forests being sufficient to supply
fuel for generations to come), has been found in the
north, south, and middle of the country. The com-
paratively small quantity as yet used for fuel, forges,
and coasting steamers, is obtained chiefly at the head
of Blind Bay, near Nelson; and coal has lately been
discovered near Auckland, where a company has been
formed to work it, with fair promise of success. Perhaps
the finest coal, however, yet found in the whole of
Australasia lies in some new fields discovered near
the Buller River on Nelson’s West Coast; while the
whole of the mountainous peninsula forming the north-


west corner of this Province would appear to be
stored with coal if not with gold, for a pioneering
party, lately prospecting here, reports that “ vast
quantities of coal were passed, and a two-hundred-
weight piece was broken off by us from one of the out-
cropping seams,’’
Iron is found in many localities, and some of the rocks
on the Otago coast are so powerfully magnetic as to affect
the traveller’s compass. The beach at New Plymouth,
for several miles, is formed of the finest iron sand,
adhering to a common magnet in the form of steel-
like, crystallized particles. The long-enduring Tara-
naki Colonists, on the pacification ot their beautiful
Province, will, we hope, turn their attention to this
substance, and endeavour, if it should prove practi-
cable, to form a company for smelting it into an export
of bar steel. Some time since we directed one of our
ships to bring home a fair sample of it, and the fol-
lowing is the report on its quality by an experienced
metallurgist: —“I have made a careful assay, and
find the lowest yield of iron 384 per cent, and the
highest 59.”
Copper has been worked on a small scale at the Kawau
and Great Barrier Islands near Auckland, while Chrome,
if not Copper, will soon, probably, be freely exported
from the great Dun Mountain mine at Nelson.
Gold.— A little gold, chiefly in quartz, is found in
the Coromandel country, near Auckland. From the
Collingwood Diggings, in the Nelson Province, gold to
the value of a quarter of a million sterling has been
exported; while, more lately, some fine nuggets have
been found near the Duller River on the West
Coast. All actual or expected gold fields in New
Zealand, however, have for the time been totally
eclipsed by the famous diggings of Otago. Here, in the
lucky month of June, 1861, a gentlemen named Read
discovered the precious metal in a lone gully of a remote
little stream called the Tuapeka, and here, in less than
two months, 3000 people were at work, taking out
6000 ounces a week. The news flew, and at once a
“rush” from Australia set in. Dunedin, the quiet
village capital of Otago, sprang almost in a day into a
small Melbourne : new fields were discovered, a large
body of diggers got to work; and, now, we learn that
the gold obtained in the twenty-four months, from the
first discovery in June, 1861, up to June, 1863, was no


less than 700,000 ounces, worth nearly three millions
sterling.*

Government. —By the new Constitution, conferred on
New Zealand in 1853, the country is governed in manner
following : —The Crown appoints the Governor and the
four judges, and withdraws from the Colony’s public
revenue some £25,000 a-yearfor a civil list; being about
£4OOO for the governor and his household, £6OOO for the
judges, £7OOO chiefly for salaries of the legislative officers
of the general government, and £BOOO for native pur-
poses ; and the Crown (as yet) provides all military and
naval forces, consisting, in the present exceptional state
of Native affairs, of five or six regiments, and of two or
three ships of war.
The general government of the Colony is vested in
the General Assembly, a body which has hitherto held
its annual session at Auckland, and which is composed
of a Legislative Council consisting, as yet, of some 25
leading Colonists, chosen by the Governor for life ; and
of the House of Representatives, a body consisting, in
these early days, ot about 50 members, elected by the
people every five years.
The Governor is aided and advised by a Ministry,
composed of such officers as Colonial Secretary (Pre-
mier), Colonial Treasurer (Chancellor of the Exchequer),
Attorney-General, Postmaster-General and Native Mi-
nister, with salaries of some £BOO a-year. These Minis-
ters are all members either of the Legislative Council,
or of the House of Representatives, and go out of office
when they cease to command a majority in that House.
Every man owning a freehold worth £5O, or being
a tenant householder in the country at a rent of £5 per
year, or in the town at £lO per year, is qualified both to
vote for, or to he, a member of the House of Representa-
tives.
* The gross quantity of gold obtained from all the New Zealand fields
in the six years which have elapsed since the first discovery up to the pre-
sent day, would amount, in weight, to nearly 25 tons, worth nearly
£3,500,000.


The Colony, at present, is divided into nine Pro-
vinces : Auckland, Taranaki, Wellington, Hawkes’ Bay,
Nelson, Marlborough, Canterbury, Otago, and South-
land ; and each of these, for local purposes, is governed
by ! its Provincial Council, a local parliament consisting
of a chief officer called the Superintendent, and of from
ten to twenty provincial councillors, chosen by the
electors of the Province every four years. Each Provin-
cial Council makes the local laws for its own Province, —
such as those relating to the sale and management of
the public wild lands, to immigration, to roads, fences,
highway rates, public institutions, and to all municipal
matters; but every “provincial-council Act” has to
receive the assent of the Governor and the Ministry
before it becomes law.
Thus, the constitution of New Zealand bears a strong
infantile resemblance to that of Great Britain. The
Governor is the Queen, taking a very active part in
public affairs, the legislative councillors are the
created (life) peers, and the House of Bepresentatives
is the House of Commons; while the nine provincial
councils may be called nine great rural-municipalities
wielding very extensive local powers.
Administration oe Justice. —The civil and criminal
law is the same as in England. For judicial pur-
poses the Colony is divided into four * districts, each,
we may say, judicially presided over by one of the four
judges who holds an assize in the chief town of each
Province of his district for the jury trial of any civil or
criminal case which may prove beyond the j urisdiction
of the police magistrates and the minor Courts.
Revenue.— The public revenue of the Colony, which
actually doubled itself in the three years from 1858 to
1861, now amounts to about £1,000,000 a-year. It is
derived almost wholly, and in about equal proportions,
from the sale and lease of the wild lands of the country,
and from the‘light tariff printed at page 33. Taking
the entire population of New Zealand, British and
Native, at 200,000, this is a revenue of £5 per head—in
the Mother Country it is little more than £2 per head.
The revenue in New Zealand, too, is not wrung from the
people by excessive taxation, but springs, to the extent
of more than half, from the wild land fund, a natural
resource quite independent of the people.
* Three in name, but the extensive south district, or circuit, is
divided into two portions.


Expenditure. —Having unfortunately mislaid our
copy of the New Zealand Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
last Budget,we cannot tell our readers so accurately as we
could have wished how this large sum of a million a-year
is spent by the young Colony, but we believe it dis-
appears much as follows: —about a third of it is taken
by the General Assembly for native purposes, civil list,
steam postal-subsidies, interest of debt, and for the other
wants of the General Government; and the remainder
by the nine Provincial Councils, mainly for such pur-
poses as road-making, harbour-works, school-endow-
ments, the introduction of labour by means of assisted
passages, the interest of local public debts, and pro-
vincial salaries.
Public Debt. —The political and colonising battles
between the original New Zealand Company and the
Colonial Office of Lord Derby’s Administration, saddled
the then infant Colony with a debt of some £250.000,
and partly to get rid of this unjust debt, and partly to
raise additional funds for the more rapid civilisation and
colonisation of the country, the General and Provincial
Governments have now, we think, altogether, borrowed
about £2,000,000. This may seem a large sum for so
young a colony to owe ; but we must remember that a
portion of it was the debt of others which the Colony
has had to pay, that the whole of it amounts to only a
couple of years’ income, and that the borrowing of a
million or two by a young and prosperous colony like
New Zealand for such purposes as the making of roads,
the purchase of native land, and the introduction of
labour, is much the same thing as borrowing a spade
to dig up a nugget.
Extorts. —The present annual exports of the Colony,
which in the three years from 1858 to 1861 were more
than doubled, must now amount to upwards of £1,500,000,
and consist chiefly of wool and gold, shipped direct to Lon-
don, and of such (as yet) smaller items as timber, spars,
flax, oils, ores, exported mainly to England and Aus-
tralia.
Imports. —The present annual imports amount to
nearly £3,000,000, and consist of British manufactures,
and of tea, coffee, sugar, rice, raisins, tobacco, ■wines,
and other things, imported, for the most part, direct
from London, but partly through the Australian markets.
Eeligious Institutions. —Though there is no State
Church in New Zealand there is, nevertheless, a very


flourishing little church establishment comprising five
bishops,* various archdeacons, and a corresponding body
of the lower clergy, supported by societies existing at
home for the extension of the Colonial Church, by lands
set apart in various of the Settlements for church pur-
poses, by gifts and bequests of wealthy churchmen, and
by congregational contributions.
The Wesleyans are also a numerous and influential
body, and maintain a most useful missionary estab-
lishment among the natives. The Free Kirk of Scotland
is prominently represented in Otago, Homan Catholics
have erected chapels in most of the principal towns, and
the Baptists have established a Nonconformist Settle-
ment at Albertland; while, as an instance of the liberality
prevailing in New Zealand with respect to religion, and
of the absence of that bitter sectarian feeling which has
too often disgraced Christianity at home, we may men-
tion that the authorities of Canterbury, a Settlement
long unjustly reputed to be a bigoted exclusive High
Church Settlement, have given and chapel
land to the Dissenting members of their flourishing
community.
Schools. —The various Provinces have appropriated
many thousand pounds of their annual public revenues
to the endowment and support of Grammar and Free
Schools. These, with the Church and Wesleyan col-
leges at Auckland, the private commercial academies
and ladies’ seminaries, and the flourishing Sunday schools
of various religious bodies, afford means of secular and
religious training; and there is, perhaps, no colonial
community in the world where a good plain education
for young people can now be obtained at a cheaper rate
than in New Zealand.
The Peess. —The fourth estate is well represented,
the Colonists supporting nearly a score of weekly and
bi-weekly papers, besides one or two little periodicals.
The press is conducted with considerable vigour and
ability; and now and then the leader of one of the
crack journals would not discredit even the Leviathan
of London.
Society. —“ Whatever may have been the defects of
that Wakefield System of Colonisation on which New
Zealand was settled, the system did at least do this—it
* Our most dissenting readers will not think that the New Zealand
clergy is overpaid when they learn that, on the average, the five
bishoprics produce their holders incomes of only some £5OO a-year.


drew over a much higher class of emigrants to the
Colony than any which had ever left the Mother Country
since the Puritan towns of Massachusetts and the Cava-
lier Settlements of Virginia were.founded ; and selected
its free and assisted passage emigrants so carefully, that
almost every mechanic and labourer carried to New Zea-
land has been a picked man. Petres, Staffords, Pier-
points, Molesworths, Cliffords, Dillons, Tancreds, Tollo-
maches, Congreves, Welds, Wortleys, Vavasours, Chol-
mondeleys, scions of many an old English family, have
settled in New Zealand. Retired professional men
turned agriculturists, * vieux moustache’ of the Dine or
Indian service, grown cunning in wool; enterprizing
younger sons who have had the good sense to abandon
Regent Street and the life of the clubs; quiet rural
families, with broods of sons and daughters, most of
them living on and creating their little estates; with
a considerable sprinkling of black coats, scarlet coats,
government officials, and the mercantile classes, con-
stitute half the present pioneering population of the
country. No stranger, I think, would now visit the
Colony without being agreeably surprised at the high,
if homely, tone of society, and forcibly struck with the
steady, industrious character of all orders of the young
community. Indeed, for friendliness of feeling, pleasant-
ness of intercourse, intellectual and moral endowments,
I should say that the social circles of New Zealand
would generally be found equal to those which the
emigrant family might have left in England. Crime,
too, we must recollect, is all but non-existent; while the
republican licence so offensive to the Englishman in
America, and the convict taint, which still reveals
itself through a large portion of Australia, are alike
unknown.”— llursthouse’s New Zealand.
Amusements.— “ The New Zealand community being
a young, hard-working, well-to-do community, and
free from those carking cares arising in England from
the difficulty of planting out families, from excess of
competition, and from those other causes which there
so often furrow the brow, can afford to take and
enjoy a holiday, and does so pretty often. Draw-
ing-room, Italian Opera, Almack’s, Pall Mall Club,
and. pompous Dinner, where a dozen heavy men in
mourning meet to devour more than they can digest
and to muddle themselves with curious wines and
liqueurs rare, are, as yet, things unknown in New Zea-


laud. But there is a great deal of homely, help-
yourself hospitality, with plenty of tea-drinkings, dance-
parties, and pic-nics. In a few years, too, thanks to
various public benefactors who have introduced some
of our finest game, New Zealand may offer us shooting
second to no country in the world. Even now there is
race, race ball, and regatta, concert and lecture,
cricket match, and agricultural show; and the Colonists,
none of them tooth-picking loungers, all of them actively
engaged in some pursuit or other, many in the pleasing
and profitable pursuit of creating a little landed estate
for themselves, find quite as many relaxations, sports,
pastimes, and amusements in New Zealand as they
have time or inclination to attend to.”— Hursthouse’s
New Zealand.

General Statistics,— ln the year 1861 (the last

Population of the Colony being, then, in round numbers
100,000, dwelling in 23,000 houses,* there were:—

f As a large proportion of the population is rural, and resident, too,
in back country districts away from towns, many births, perhaps one-
third, never get registered at all.
t A few deaths would pass unregistered, but, proportionately, very
few; for a death in New Zealand, as an event far less common than
a birth, is one which is heard of far and wide in the neighbourhood
where it occurs. Assuming that the mortality in New Zealand were as
great as in England, the deaths in this year 1861, instead of being only
1(100, would have been about 4000.
Retail Shop Prices, varying a little in the different
Provinces, but on the average about as follows :—
Bread .... 2 \d. to 2f d, per lb.

Brandy 25 0 per gallon
Wine 20 0 „
Coals 40 0 per ton
Vegetables about the same price as at
home: fruit, except peaches and me-
lons, (as yet) scarce and dear.
Clothing, Hardware, Soft Goods, and most British
manufactures, purchased at the counter, are, on the
average, from a third to a fourth dearer than in the


Mother Country. The clothing worn, however, being
of a plainer, more homely sort, the actual outlay of
a family for apparel in blew Zealand is, probably, no
greater than in England.
Rents. —Except for the first month or two, and in two
or three of the larger towns, houses are seldom rented,
each family soon getting to live in their own. But rents,
where there are any, and except in time of any Dig-
ging rushes, as at Dunedin, when for a time they became
extravagant), are full twice as high as in England,—
two-room cottages letting at from 12s. to 15s. a week, and
four room at from 355. to 40s.
Expenses of Living. —Remembering that almost all
people in New Zealand live, or soon may live, on their
own little freeholds, where two-thirds of the food, and most
of the fuel, is obtained from the land, and that groceries
and other things may frequently be bought very cheap
at merchants’ auction sales, where two or three neigh-
bours will join and buy hags of sugar, chests of tea, &c.,
it may certainly be said that the actual cash outgoings
for living are quite as little in New Zealand as in Eng'
land, and sometimes less.

and relative value. The Union Bank of Australia, 38,
Old Broad Street; the Bank of New Zealand, 50, Old
Broad Street; and the Bank of New South Wales, 37,


Cannon Street, London, have branches in all the chief
Settlements of the Colony, and issue letters of credit
thereon ; they also collect bills, remit monies (at either
end), and transact all monetary business between New
Zealand and the Mother Country. The Bank of Austra-
lasia, too, London Office, 4, Threadneedle Street, en-
couraged by the success of the other three, and by the
rapidly-growing prosperity of the Colony, is, we believe,
about to extend its operations to New Zealand.

CHAPTER YI.
THE LAND HEGDLAXIONS.
By the Treaty of Wait an gi, made between the British
Government and the remnant of the natives, in 1840,
when the regular colonisation of the islands first com-
menced, and the aborigines made over to the Queen
all or any their rights of sovereignty, the entire terri-
tory of the Colony, 70,000,000 of acres, was formally ad-
mitted to be the property of the 60,000 natives then left
in the country; and the Crown pledged itself to seek to
obtain no portion of this vast wilderness for the purposes
of colonisation except by the way of friendly purchase.
This agreement, as we have before remarked, has been
scrupulously observed. With the exception of ample
“native reserves,” the whole of the great South Island,
where, in fact, there were only a few hundred natives,
has been acquired in this manner, and a moderate extent
of territory, including some fine agricultural districts, has
gradually been purchased in the provinces of Auck-
land, Wellington, Hawkes’ Bay, and Taranaki, which,
together, form the North Island. *
The Government thus purchases the raw wild land
of the natives, and then opens roads, surveys and classi-
fies it, and sells it to the Settlers; and each provincial
Government, besides having its auriferous, mineral,
and timber-cutting lands, which are let or leased
on easy terms, deals in three sorts of wild land,
namely, pastoral land, town land, and country land.
The first, are the wild grazing lands of the Colony,
leased on terms of years, in lots of from 2000 to 10,000,
and 30,000 acres, at annual rents of less than a penny
an acre.f The second, form the sites of the new towns
and townshipsrisingor filling up in the Colony, a reserved
price, varying from £5 to £lO, and £5O, is put on each,
• By far the largest and finest portions of the North Island, amount-
ing probably to twenty millions of acres, are still the property of the 55,0(0
natives who reside there ; and form a magnificent domain, of which they
neither use, nor probably will ever be able to use, the tenth part.
f As all the pastoral lands are taken up, it is unnecessary to describe
the various leasing regulations.


and they are sold by cash auction, generally in half-acre
and acre lots. Country land is the common agricultural
land of the Colony, surveyed in small and larger lots, and
sold for cash, or disposed of, in the various ways herein-
after named. In each provincial capital there is a land
office, where the purchaser may see plans of the various
surveyed districts, and learn what land is ready for sale,
and on completing his purchase he receives his Crown
title, and can take possession. Except in Otago and
Southland, there are no conditions as to cultivating—the
land is bought, and may be left to lie waste and idle at
the buyer’s pleasure; nor is there anywhere any wild
land tax. Leaseable pastoral land being no longer in
the market, and town land being sold at various re-
served prices, we have, here, only to deal with Country
Land, and this the Nine Provinces dispose of as
follows :
Auckland. —Here, country land is sold at the fixed
price of 10s. an acre ; but if two or more buyers hap-
pen to fix on the same lot it is put up to auction between
such buyers, and knocked down to the highest bidder.
To attract officers, old soldiers and sailors, and quali-
fied school-teachers to settle in the province, Auckland
grants commissioned officers, 400 ; non-commissioned
and warrant officers, 80 ; private soldiers, marines, and
seamen, 60, and school-teachers 80 acres of land ; while,
to attract labourers, mechanics, domestic servants,
farmers, graziers, traders, small capitalists, and others,
she makes them free grants as follows:— 40 acres are
given to each person, or to each parent and member of a
family who is eighteen years of age, and 20 acres foreach
child between five and eighteen. The farmer, too, or
other capitalist or small capitalist of any class, also
receives an additional 40 or 20 acre grant [as the age of
thC' person may he) for each servant , or labourer, or
friend, or relative whose passage he may pay.
The grantee may either select his grant in any of the
surveyed districts he may prefer, and at once go upon
it, or he may defer his selection until some apparently
better lands are thrown open, and choose his grant any
time within five years after his arrival. There is, too, no
obligation to cultivate any portion of the land within
some given time, as is generally the case in colonial free
grants, and the sole condition imposed on the grantee
is this —that for a period of five years after his arrival
in the province, neither he, nor any member of his


family, nor any servant, labourer, or other person whom
he may take with him, and for whom he may get a
grant, shall he out of, and absent from, the province of
Auckland for more than twelve calendar months. * Land
Orders for these grants (obtainable through us) are
issued, to eligible applicants, by various agents of the
Auckland Government stationed in this country on pay-
ment of a fee of 10s. for every 40 acres.
These > Free Grant llegulations have been in force
about six years, in which period we believe about
200,000 acres have been selected under them; and,
altogether, they will soon have attracted to Auckland
some 10,000 persons, among whom there have been
a party of Isle of Man, and a party of Lincolnshire
people, a party of Nova Scotians, a party of Germans,
and a body of some 2000 Nonconformist settlers, who
have lately founded the new Settlement of Albertland.
Taeanaki. —Here, country land is surveyed in lots
of from 40 to 240 acres, a reserved price of 10s. an
acre is put on all of them, and they are sold by public
auction to the highest bidder. Naval and military
grants are made as in Auckland.
Wellington. —Here, country land is divided into
what we may call agricultural land within hundreds,
agricultural land not within hundreds, and rough pas-
toral land. On the first, published reserved prices are
put, and it is sold by auction, the purchaser having
certain free grazing rights on any unsold lands within
the hundred. The country land lying beyond pro-
claimed hundreds is sold at a fixed price of 10s. an acre,
and the pastoral land bears a reserved price of ss.
an acre, and is sold by auction. Naval and military
grants are made as in Auckland, but there are no free
grants to civilians.
* The Crown title enabling the grantee to sell his grant is only issued
at the end of the five years, when it is found that this condition has been
complied with. Of course, Auckland does not give this land away with
the view of enabling people to sell it on arrival, pocket the cash, and
carry it off to some other Colony or Province. She wants to make resi-
dent colonists of those to whom she makes her free grants, and the con-
dition of “ four years’ residence ” was framed only to promote this object.
It should be clearly understood, however, that the breach of the condition
vitiates only the grant for the person who commits it. If A. for himself
and family, and for any servants or labourers he may have taken with
him, gets, say eight 40-acre grants, and a son.C., and a labourer, i?., are
absent from the Province for more than twelve months of the five years,
A. only loses, and has to give up, the 80 acres he got for this C. and B.


Ha wees’ Bay. —The regulations are the same as those
of Wellington.
Nelson. —Here, country land is divided into agricul-
tural fund rough pastoral, and both are sold by auction
at reserved prices fixed and published by a Land Board.
The reserved price of the former, however, is always
between 10s. and 20s. an acre, and of the latter between
ss. and 10s, Nelson makes no free grants of any sort.
Marlborough. —The regulations are the same as
those of Nelson.
Canterbury, —Here, country land is surveyed in lots
of not less than 20 acres, and sold at the fixed price of
40s. an acre.* No civilian or naval and military grants
are made, except to old soldiers leaving the service or
discharged through wounds received in the Russian
war, or to the wives of soldiers made widows by the
Russian war, who are allowed free grants of 40 acres.
Otago. —Here, country land is sold in lots of not less
than 10 acres, at 20s. an acre ; but here the purchaser
comes under a clumsy obligation to expend in four years
in money or labour for all improvements, including
building and fencing, a sum equal to 40s. an acre. If
two or more persons apply on the same day for the same
lot it is put up between them, and knocked down to the
highest bidder. Otago makes no free grants of any
sort.
Southland. —The regulations are nearly the same
as those of Otago.
Average Price of Land in the various Provinces,
and the Quantity Sold in the Year 1861. —Our
readers will not fail to have remarked that some of the
Provinces sell their country land by auction to the
highest bidder, and that though other Provinces sell it
at a fixed price, yet that even here, when two or more
buyers happen to choose the same lot, it is also put up to
auction. The actual price, therefore, of country land to
the buyer in New Zealand is not shown by the printed
* This comparatively high price is not asked because Canterbury ima-
gines that, intrinsically, one acre of her land is worth two and four acres
in other Provinces, but because she colonizes on what is called the “ high
price ” system—a system which sacrifices some things in order to obtain a
large land fund by the alienation of a comparatively small area of land—
a fund which is most profitably employed for the benefit of the land
buyer, and of the community generally, in making roads and bridges, an 4
in importing labour by means of assisted passages,


Land Regulations. Seeing, however, that this might
prove useful information to some of our readers, we
searched through the New Zealand Blue Book for 1861,
and found, there, some tables which enable us, as
below, to show what the actual average prices were in
that year.

In addition to these 450,000 acres of country land,
there were 200 acres of town land, and 2600 acres of
suburban sold, while about 25,000 acres were disposed of
in free grants.
* The sum realised in Otago was produced by the sale of 42,000 acres
of country land, and by 100 acres of town land. The amount produced
by the latter would be considerable, seeing, that it was partly situated
at Dunedin, and was sold during the gold rush ; but the separate sum is
not stated, and the nett price of the country land sold in Otago cannot,
therefore, be stated with accuracy,


CHAPTER YII.
CHIEF TOWNS AND SETTLEMENTS.
Hew Zealand, the “Britain of the South,” as pro-
phetic colonists fondly call her, is at present di-
vided into nine Provinces: Auckland, Taranaki, Wel-
lington, and Hawkes’ Bay, in the North Island —Nelson,
Marlborough, Canterbury, Otago, and Southland in the
South Island.
Auckland, the northern Province of the North
Island is almost half the size of England. Its length
from north-east to south-west is 400 miles, its greatest
breadth (near the parallel of 38°) is nearly 200 miles,
whilst the sweep of its coast line embraces some 300
leagues. Its present Colonist population is about
30,000.
The chief natural characteristics of this Province are
these:—A warmer climate, capable of ripening maize,
and here and there the orange—exclusive possession
of the Kauri pine forests —the presence of nearly two-
thirds (40,000) of the remnant of the native population
—possession of Lake Taupo, the largest New Zealand
lake, and of numerous hot springs and chalybeate
waters —great facilities of water carriage (the various
estuaries, creeks, and rivers offering transit for coasting
craft, boats, and canoes through nearly 1000 miles of
country), and abundance of harbours.
The reader may gain the best idea of this Province by
glancing at it divided into five districts—namely, the
long Peninsula forming the northern portion of the Pro-
vince, the town of Auckland and its rural neighbour-
hoods, the West-coast district, the interior or Central
district, and the East-coast district.
The Northern Peninsula, from Auckland to the North
Cape, is 200 miles in length, by from 30 to 50 in breadth.
In position, shape, and climate it bears about the same
resemblance to the rest of New Zealand as South Devon-
shire and Cornwall do to England. The surface is
much broken by wooded mountain ranges of moderate
elevation, and a large portion of the western side is
covered with Kauri forests, here attaining their finest
growth. The country is richly watered, and presents
clusters of fertile valleys running inland from the


numerous estuaries and river harbours indenting both
coasts. Here, we find a chain of flourishing little Settle-
ments extending almost from the young city of Auckland
up to the North Cape, and consisting of Nonconformist
Albertland, on the waters of the Kaipara, of Wangari and
its Nova-Scotian settlers, of Hokianga famous for Kauri
spars, of the Bay of Islands with its noble harbour, and of
Wangaroa and Monganui—all little communities linked
to each other and the young metropolis by bush tracks,
rude roads, or marine highways; and all busily engaged
in the pioneering work of civilization, subduing the
wilderness and making the forest give place to the
farm.
“ No part of New Zealand is so rich in historic interest
as this northern portion of the Province of Auckland.
Some future Macaulay may relate that here, unharmed,
the missionary fathers first raised the cross among
ferocious cannibals ; here the first press was set up, and
the first Bible printed in the native tongue; here the
early colonisation of the country commenced, and here
stood Kororareka, the old ‘ Alsatia ’ of the Pacific ;
here the Treaty of Waitangi was signed by the Queen’s
first Governor and her Maori Barons; and here the
Bed Cross first fluttered in the breeze, and gave to
Britain a Britain of the South.”
“ Ilich, too, in historic associations, the Peninsula is the
reverse of barren in natural gifts. Here are the forests of
Kauri, the finest flax, and the great stores of gum ; here,
from a hundred valleys, will come large exports of farm
and dairy produce, corn, and fruits, and honey, and oil,
and wool; here, peach and nectarine, pear and mul-
berry, bow their branches fruited to the ground; and
here, pomegranate and citron, olive and orange, might
ripen in the forcing northern sun.”
Town oe Auckland and Suburban Districts. —Auck-
land (in South latitude nearly 37°), the thriving capital of
the Province, was founded by the first Governor of New
Zealand, Captain Hobson, R.N., in 1840._ The town and
neighbourhood now numbers some 10,000 > inhabitants, and
the suburban villages, lying within a circle of 20 miles,
may number some 10,000 more. A glance at the map dis-
plays its commanding mercantile position. _ Planted on
a neck of level land only six miles across, it stands on
two harbours, Waitemata and Manakau. An arm of
the former connects it with the rivers Thames and
Piako, presenting water carriage through fifty miles of


country—an arm of the latter virtually connects it with
the rivers Waikato and Waipa, navigable for canoes
through some hundred miles of fertile valleys. Creeks
and inlets of these two harbours indent the town and
suburb shores at every point, and as a canal cut of three
or four miles might unite them, and enable a frigate to
glide from sea to sea, there is some reason for the boast
that Auckland is the “Corinthof the South.”
The eastern harbour perhaps deserves to rank as the
finest in New Zealand, and will ever be the one the most
frequented by shipping; but the western harbour,
Manakau, though presenting a dangerous bar, which
lately proved so fatal to H.M.S. Orpheus, is, neverthe-
less, a fine ocean inlet, well suited for carefully-handled
steamers and small craft, and opening a most convenient
sea path to New Plymouth, Nelson, Wellington, and all
the Settlements to the south.
Auckland is built on the southern shore of the eastern
harbour, and a good metalled road of six miles, passing
through continuous farms, villas, and gardens, leads
from the town to the rising village of Onehunga, the
landing-place or terminus of the western harbour. The
town displays a line of wharfs and jetties, and two or
three streets of shops and substantial warehouses, some
of wood, but more of brick or stone; together with
various modest public buildings, such as churches and
chapels, Government house, barracks, gaol, banks, cus-
tom house, and local Westminster. The botanical gar-
dens, Parnel and the little suburban bays sparkling
with the villas of the merchants and public officers, offer
many beautiful walks ; while one-tree hill, and the high
grounds behind the town present a pleasing variety of
scenery scarcely to be surpassed.
Auckland is the head-quarters of the Missionary
bodies, head-quarters of the troops, head-quarters of
native trade and. intercourse, and at present head-
quarters of the Governor and his little court; and these
manifestations of progress and civilisation, coupled with
the commercial activity of the people, the constant ar-
rival and departure of shipping, the daily coming and
going of the native canoes bringing in produce and
carrying back the returns, impart an air of animation,
variety, and bustle to this little capital of the north,
which is seldom witnessed in the early days of young
colonial towns.
The home or suburban districts of Auckland may bo


defined as being the Isle of Wight (Waiheki) over-
lapping the harbour, the north shore opposite the town
now exhibiting many a farm and garden, Coromandel
and the islands of Kawau and the Great Barrier, the
belt of Pensioner Villages (Onehunga, Otahuhu, Howick,
and Panmure), and the districts of Waiuku and
Papakura.
Coromandel lies nearly opposite the capital, about
thirty miles distant across the Gulf. It possesses a fair
harbour for small vessels, and is the centre of a large and
flourishing timber trade. Here, and around the opposite
harbour of Mercury Bay, the kauri pine and other valu-
able trees are fine and abundant. The whole district, in
fact, from Cape Colville to the Thames, forming an
eastern peninsula forty miles long, by fifteen broad, is
well wooded, but rugged and mountainous; though
here and there it presents some small valleys and fertile
garden spots. Gold, as before observed, has been dis-
covered in the neighbourhood of Coromandel, and
though present “ prospectings ” have not succeeded in
finding it in commercially paying quantities, a strong
belief prevails among practical men on the spot, that
the Coromandel ranges will eventually give forth both
gold and other ores in considerable abundance.
The Kawau, a small island about twenty miles north
of the capital, is chiefly remarkable as having been the
site of some promising copper works, now temporarily
abandoned, owing to the scarcity and dearness of the
necessary mining labour. The Great Barrier, a large
island, about fifty miles north-east of the Auckland
harbour, to which it forms a good outer breakwater, has
also produced some copper. Well wooded, it will pro-
bably become the seat of a flourishing timber trade, and
possesses a fine harbour in Port Abercrombie, where a
vessel of 500 tons has been built. The coasts abound
with fish, and the few native and European resi-
dents possess some thriving little cultivations and some
fine cattle.
The Pensioner Villages were laid out by the Govern-
ment some years ago for a body of married pensioners,
selected from among the most able-bodied volunteers
in England; each private, on certain conditions of
light military service, receiving the gift of a cottage
and an acre of land. The experiment has proved emi-
nently successful —many of the men having acquired
landed property, and created clusters of little garden-


farms which, supply Auckland and the shipping with a
considerable quantity of butter, eggs, poultry, milk,
vegetables, and fruit. These Villages, connected with
each other by good roads, lie about live miles apart, in
a sort of irregular segment of a circle round the town.
Onehunga, the nearest, before alluded to as the rising
port of the western harbour, is six miles from Auck-
land; Howick, the most distant, about twelve. A
few miles from Howick we reach Drury, in the
Papakura district, at present the frontier inland Settle-
ment of Auckland—the natives not having yet parted
with any of the inland tracts more to the South. Here
are some good farms; and the whole district is rapidly
coming under cultivation. Waiuku lies a little to the
south-west of Papakura, nearer the coast, between an
arm of the. Manukau harbour and the Awaroa stream,
which latter runs into the Waikato ; and here, a canal cut
of about a mile, or a tramway across the portage, would
connect the Waikato with the western harbour of
Auckland. _
The remaining three divisions of the Auckland pro-
vince, the West coast, the Central, and the East
coast districts, require but brief mention ; for although
they comprise by far the largest and by far the finest
portions of the Province, they are (as yet) almost en-
tirely in the hands of the natives, and offer little trace
of European settlement or population. _
The West coast may be briefly described as an exten-
sive district lying along the coast from Waiuku to
Mokau, and bounded inland by the river Waipa—a
tract of country some 100 miles long by 2-5 broad. It
contains a fair proportion of agricultural land, and ex-
hibits, or rather did exhibit before the commencement
of the native troubles, the two flourishing little Mis-
sionary Settlements and trading ports of Kawhia and
"Whaingaroa.
The Central District of the Auckland Province con-
sists mainly of the great valleys of the Waikato and
the Wiapa, and may be said to extend almost from
the Papakura district down to lake Taupo and the
northern borders of the Wellington Province. It em-
braces a tract of country 100 miles long by some 40
broad; and in genial climate, rich soil, striking scenery,
water-carriage, and agricultural and pastoral admixture
of forest, fern, grass, and flax lands, it is deservedly
esteemed one of the finest districts in either island.


The shores of that splendid lake, lake Taupo, nearly 100
miles in circumference, which so fitly forms the end of
so fine a district, surrounded by lakelets, hot-springs,
and chalybeate waters, may possibly become the site of
some future New Zealand Cheltenham ; whilst towering
over laupo, 7000 feet high, there is snow-capped Ton-
ganro, forming a noble back-ground to these Hesperides
of the North.
The fifth, or East coast district of the Auckland
Province winds along the coast from the Pirth of the
J.hamcs to Poverty Bay, and embraces a tract of coun-
try 1/30 miles _ long by some 30 broad. This was the
coast first visited by Cook, and the names of many of
the bays and capes are those given by our illustrious
circumnavigator. The extensive tract of country, form-
ing the shores of the great Bay of Plenty, well deserves
the character which its name implies, there being no
part of New Zealand where the natives are more
numerous or more industrious, and no part which pro-
duces such a quantity of wheat, maize, flax, pork, and
other native produce shipped coastwise for the markets
of Auckland.
These three great southern districts, constituting two-
thirds of the Province of Auckland, form the stronghold
of the remnant of the native race. The West coast,
with the Central district, is the country of the Waikato,
the most numerous and powerful of all remaining na-
tive tribes; and the East coast is dotted with the
villages of what are commonly called the east-coast
people. But the entire native population even of these
the most populous parts of New Zealand does not exceed
30,000, while the country under the plough would
support a population of three or four million Colonists
in easy plenty.
Taranaki.
Taranaki, or New Plymouth as it was originally
called," torms the mid-west Province of the North
Island and has an extreme length of 80 miles, a
breadth of 70, and a coast line of 40 leagues. Possessing
an area of 3,000,000 acres, it is about twice the size of our
English Devonshire; and though, from the fertility of
its soil and the beauty of its scenery, it has lorfg been
called the Garden of New Zealand, it has been so in-
mou7h7an7tLVovte is now called New pi >'-


cessantly disturbed and reduced by “Native Troubles,”
that iu this, the twenty-third year of its colonization,
it numbers only a population of 2000.
The Settlement was founded by a body of west-
country gentlemen, including Molesworths, Bullers,
Woolcombes, Courtenays, St. Aubyns, Trelawnys ; and
its village capital, New Plymouth, in latitude 39°, and
about 100 miles by sea, both from Auckland and Nel-
son, was planted by Frederick Carrington and a pioneer-
ing party of Devon and Cornish colonists in 1841.
In earlier and happier days, the following sketch of
the little place was, we believe, a very faithful one :
“Snugly planted on the margin of the beach, em-
bosomed amid gentle hills, and watered by the Huatoki,
Mangotuku, and tributary burns, it displays its granite
church and chapel, its rustic mill and brewery, snug
hostelries, stores, and primitive shops ; but affecting no
‘town airs,’ stands out before the world a robust, hearty-
looking village, famed throughout the Laud for its troops
of rosy children, honey of Hybla, fine mutton, and
dairies of Devonshire cream. The appearance of the
Settlement from sea is strikingly beautiful and varied:
the taste for sylvan scenery and quiet rustic beauty
being gratified by the combination of stream and forest,
dell and valley, pastures and trim fields dotted with
cattle or yellow with corn ; while, for the Salvator Rosa
eye, there is the snow-crested Apollo of mountains,
Mount Egrnont, shooting up from a sea of foliage 8000
feet into the brilliant sky.”
So much of this picture has, however, since been
blackened by war, that it is now. no longer a likeness.
It Avould be impossible, in our limited pages, to give our
readers the history of a struggle known far and wide
in New Zealand and Australia under the name of the
Taranaki Land Question, where 2000 or 3000 turbulent
Natives, having already nearly 3,000,000 acres of fer-
tile wild land of their own, of which they scarce
use a rood, have long been suffered to play the dog
in the manger, and to seek to Avrest from the Set-
tlers, by quibble and trick, and then by force, a few
thousand acres actually purchased three times over by
the Government from some of themselves ! *
* AVithout taking into account Governor Browne’s attempted purchase
of the AVaitera land—land which Governor Grey has lately abandoned,
but which some of the first authorities in New Zealand, and some of
the natives, too, assert was fairly purchased—the New Plymouth Settle-
ment may be said to have been bought and paid for three times over,


The history, in all its enormity, is given in Mr.
Hursthouse’s work; and few, we think, would rise from
its perusal without coming to the conclusion that al-
though in our early colonization of America, and of
other countries, the Natives were sometimes cruelly,
often unjustly, seldom kindly used, yet that in New
Zealand, in this Taranaki case, going from one extreme
to the other, the old relations between the Settler and
the Savage have been reversed; that, here , it is the
Natives who have been the monopolising, dominating
race; that, here, the petted, pampered Savage has
been sutfered to become, nay, almost encouraged to be-
come, the oppressor and despoiler of the White Man.
We cannot but think, however, that the present dis-
turbances at Taranaki will end in that consummation so
devoutly to be wished, named in the concluding remarks
of our Historical Sketch. We cannot but think that
the brave and patient remnant of the long-suffering
Settlers of Taranaki are at last drawing near the dawn
of better days ; and that, if when the sword is sheathed
and the community are turning again to the arts_ of
peace, they, among other measures for the restoration
of their Settlement, would adopt some popular “ Free
Grant ” Land Regulations,* such as those which have
drawn so many strong arms to Auckland, their Pro-
vince, in a few short years, would become as pro-
minent in New Zealand _ for its substantial agricul-
tural and pastoral prosperity as it has long been for the
beauty of its scenery, and the richness of its soil.
namely—first, of the Waikato tribe, by Governor Hobson; secondly,
of some of the Ngatiawa tribe by Colonel Wakefield and the officers of
the late New Zealand Company; thirdly (in part), of others of the
Ngatiawa and of some of the Taranaki tribe by Governors Fitzroy and
Grey.
* As one step in this direction, we were glad to leant that Sir George
Grey had proposed drawing some of the hardy digger population from
Otago and Melbourne over to Taranaki by the offer of free grants of
fifty acres of land. But on the restoration of peace we trust that the local
Government will take the subject up, and seek to attract a steady stream
of capital and labour into the Province by the adoption of some popular
land regulations. New Plymouth is still affectionately remembered in that
famous part of England which gave her birth; and if a few thousand
pounds were voted by the Provincial Council for assisted passages for
young single men and young married couples, and 50 acres offered to
every working man, and 50 acres for every £5O a man could show on
his arrival, a body of 4000 or 5000 of the flower of the Devonshire and
Cornish peasantry, and of the small west-country farm class might soop
be drawn to New Plymouth.


Wellington.
Wellington, the southern Province of the North
Island, is about a fifth of the size of England. Its ex-
treme length from north to south is nearly 200 miles,
its greatest breadth from east to west about 80; the
coast line embraces a sweep of 100 leagues. The
colonist population is now about 15,000; the native
about 10,000. .
The chief natural characteristics of Wellington are
its greater liability to volcanic action, and its centrality
of position on the great marine highway of Cook s
Strait. The Province is best sketched in three divisions,
namely, Wellington town and neighbourhood, the Cook’s
Strait Settlements, and the pastoral Wairarapa Country.
Wellington (south lat. 41i°), the capital of the Pro-
vince, 180 miles by sea from New Plymouth, and Can-
terbury, and 140 from Nelson, was the first Settlement
founded by the New Zealand Company, and was planted
by the late lamented Col. Wakefield, and a body of
pioneer colonists, in 1840. Standing at the entrance
of Cook’s Strait, midway between the northern and
southern extremities of the two Islands, Wellington
occupies the most central site _in New Zealand. The
harbour is a noble sea lake, six miles in length, sur-
rounded by wooded hills, and opening by a deep chan-
nel into Cook’s Strait. The town, containing a popu-
lation of about 6000, occupies a fine position at the
western corner of the lake. It displays a line of stores,
shops, and substantial warehouses standing on the
margin of the water, with some considerable public
buildings, and many snug villas, on the hilly terraces
above; and should Wellington be made the seat of
the General Assembly it will become the occasional re-
sidence of the Governor and his little court, and take
rank as the political metropolis of the Colony. _
Evidences of the volcanic action which still lingers in
New Zealand are now perceptible chiefly in the town
and neighbourhood of Wellington. In the last twenty
years two or three considerable shocks have been expe-
rienced ; but, as before remarked, the inhabitants, who
are the people chiefly concerned in the character of the
ground they stand on, do not appear to regard their oc-
casional “ shakings ” as any serious drawback to the rise
and progress of their infant city. Situated on the edge of
the funnel of Cook’s Strait, the town is swept by fre-


quent gales of wind; and Bishop Selwyn says, with
some humour, that ‘ ‘ no one can speak of the health-
fulness of New Zealand till he has been yentilated
by the breezes of Wellington, where malaria is no more
to be feared than on the top of Chimborazo, where
active habits of industry and enterprise are evidently
favoured by the elastic tone and perpetual motion
of the atmosphere ; and where no fog can ever linger
long to deaden the intellectual faculties of the inhabi-
tants.”
Wellington possesses few or no farm districts lying
contiguous to the town. Wooded steeps rise almost per-
pendicularly from the waters of the harbour-lake, and
the country for twenty miles around consists mainly of
densely-timbered mountain ranges cut up by gullys
and ravines—a country presenting many a dell and
dingle for garden, cottage, and villa, but offering little
or no available land for the plough. The Hutt, a rich
and lovely valley and thriving village about eight
miles from the town, along the shores of the lake, is
indeed the only agricultural district immediately in
connection with the infant capital.
The Cook’s Steait Settlements,— Though, how-
ever, the rugged forest belt surrounding Wellington
isolates her, geographically, from the open country of
the plough and the fleece, she noiv possesses ready access
to some of the finest agricultural and pastoral lands in
either island. A good mountain road of 12 miles, wind-
ing through the forest hills at the back of the town, and
dotted with roadside cottage-clearings, leads to Porirua,
a small and pretiy lake-like harbour, for small
craft, opening into Cook’s Strait, and here, lying along
the shores of the Strait, commences a tract of fine coast
country, 100 miles in length by from 10 to 20 in
breadth; and here, virtually joining each other, and
connected by a fair beach road, wo find the Settlements
of Manawatu, Rangitiki, Turakina, and Wanganui.
Manawatu, about 70 miles from Wellington, is a con-
siderable river, navigable for coasting craft. The Colo-
nists, to the number of some 300, are scattered along its
banks; and possess a considerable extent of cleared
land, and some fine sheep and cattle. Rangitiki and
Turakina are little river townships of a similar cha-
racter.
Wanganui, 50 miles north of Manawatu, is the most
important member of this chain of coast Settlements.


Its river, running nearly 200 miles tlirougli a bold
and rugged country, but exhibiting various native
villages and cultivations along its banks, affords canoe
water-carriage for some amount of native produce, and
admits vessels of 200 tons up to the town. The village-
town, planted about two miles from the mouth of the
river, is a military post, a leading mission station, and
the head- quarters and chief depot of a large and flourish-
ing native trade. The town and district must now
number some 2000 settlers, who carry on a direct trade
with Sydney and Melbourne, and on the thorough
pacification‘of the Taranaki troubles, which have some-
what affected the place, Wanganui is, we think, likely,
by degrees, to rise into one of the most flourishing
Settlements of the North.
Waibaeapa. —A fair road past the valley of the Hutt,
running inland from the head of the lake, places Welling-
ton in communication with the Wairarapa plains, dis-
tant from the town about 40 miles. This is one of the
finest pastoral districts in New Zealand, now exhibiting
two or three little villages, and the homesteads and
stock stations of numbers of thriving squatters rich in
flocks and herds.
The interior of the Province, a country watered by
the feeders of the Manawatu and Wanganui, traversed
by the Rua Wahine range and running up to the con-
fines of lake Taupo, is comparatively little known. The
native population is, however, small and scattered, and
the tract is said to exhibit various small plains and val-
leys well suited for cultivation.
Hawkes’ Bat.
Until the year 1858 Hawkes’ Bay formed a portion of
the Province of Wellington.
In size, compactness of form, pleasantness of climate,
and centrality of position between Auckland and Wel-
lington, Hawkes’ Bay bears a considerable resemblance
to Taranaki —containing, though, a smaller proportion ot
rich agricultural land, but being a more open, grassy pas-
toral country. The Native population may be about 4000,
the Colonist already more than 3000. The area of the
Province is rather more than two and a half millions of
acres, about one-half of which has already been acquired
by the Government, The capital is the infant town of


Napier, latitude 39about 200 miles by sea from "Wel-
lington and 400 from Auckland, containing, with its sub-
urban districts, perhaps some 800 people, and possessing
a fair harbour for steamers and coasting vessels.
Nelson.
Nelson, the northern Province of the South Island, is
about the fifth of the size of England. Its extreme
length from north to south is 160 miles,_ its greatest
breadth from east to west about 100, while the coast
line embraces a sweep of 250 miles. The colonist popu-
lation of the Province is about 11,000 —the native 800.
The chief characteristics of Nelson are these —small
comparative proportion of cultivable land, small native
population, the existence of gold-fields, indications of
great mineral wealth in coal, chrome, copper, and iron,
and a climate said to be the finest in New Zealand.
Nelson (south latitude 41i°), the capital of the Pro-
vince, about 150 miles by sea from Wellington and New
Plymouth, was the second Settlement founded by the
New Zealand Company. Counting the suburbs, it may
now contain about 5000 inhabitants, and was planted by
the lamented late Captain Arthur Wakefield and a body
of pioneer colonists in 1842. Standing on the margin
of a snug, dock-like harbour, at the bottom of a noble
Bay, and nestling from cold south blasts under a wall-
like circle of precipitous hills, Nelson enjoys a climate
of brilliant serenity, well fitting her to become a New
Zealand bay-side Bath.
In picturing to himself these little New Zealand
towns, however, the reader should bear in mind that they
differ radically from anything in England. When,
says Mr. Hursthouse, “ we are told that Auckland, and
Wellington, and Nelson, and Christchurch are places
containing a few thousand inhabitants, we might
naturally suppose that they bore a certain resem-
blance to our second-class English towns; and that
they possessed much the same local and relative im-
portance as Poole or Beading, or Bideford or Ber-
wick. But the supposition would be utterly erronepus :
the social features of the places are utterly dissimilar.
The people of Poole, for instance, were born in Poole,
have never been much out of Poole, speak Poole Eng-
lish, have a small inheritance of Poole ideas, and see
no more of the reigning powers of the State and the


governmental machinery of the country than may he
compressed into the circumference of a Poole Mayor.
But the people of Auckland, and Wellington, and
Napier, and New Plymouth, and Nelson, and Christ-
church, and Dunedin, and Invercargill, are people
brought to one focus from all parts of the United King-
dom : Liverpool merchant and London clerk, doctor
from Dublin, lawyer from Leeds, M.A. from Magdalen,
B.A. from Brazennose, naval officer from Jersey, old
cavalry man from Brussels, Indian invalid, Lincolnshire
squire, shipwright from Portsmouth, brewer from Brigh-
ton, bishop from Eton, bricklayer from Bath, constitute
their multifarious populations. Each place, too, has its
own little parliament and complete governmental ma-
chinery on the spot, and this description of population
and mode of government, coupled with the greater ro-
mance and hardiness of young colonial life, impart a
social variety, a vigour, boldness, and originality _of
character to these little antipodal communities, which
we should find little trace of in the small town popu-
lations of the Mother Country. The New Zealand pro-
vincial metropolis, top, is not more different from the
English town in social aspects than it is in physical
appearance. Gras and. granite pavement, omnibus and
perambulator, are things to come ; streets are wider,
buildings more scattered, shops more in the general
store style, suburbs more rural; ‘ rus in urbe’ is the
dominant character, and the corn-field and the dairy
farm oft border on the warehouse and the wharf.’’
Nelson, like Wellington, surrounded by a belt of hills
and broken country , possesses hut little available land in
immediate connection with the town. The chief agri-
cultural districts in the neighbourhood are the fine valley
of the Waimea, a tract under high cultivation; and the
Motueka, a pleasant district lying across the bay.
Collingwood, a township created by the gold fields in
the north-western corner of the Province, bids fair to
become a flourishing little place as the diggings extend ;
while, if the indications of auriferous treasure found
near the Buller river should he confirmed by further
Erospectings we may expect that Nelson will soon ex-
ibit a small Settlement or two on her wild west coast.


Marlborough.
Until 1869 Marlborough formed a portion of the Nel-
son Province. Its extreme length from north-east to
south-west is about 130 miles, its extreme breadth
about 60. Being quite in its infancy, Marlborough does
not as yet number more than about 3000 Settlers ; but
it is, we think, likely to become a favourite locality with
emigrants when more known, and to display, in a few
years, many a thriving little port and germ of inland
town. The infant capital of the Province* is Blenheim,
and the chief port Picton, the latter finely situated on
one of the deep arms of Queen Charlotte’s Sound.
The south-eastern portion of Marlborough consists
mainly of the Wairau Plains, one of the finest and
first occupied sheep districts in New Zealand. The
northern end, washed by Cook’s Strait, is a rugged
densely-wooded country, indented with coves, bays,
creeks, havens, and harbours of every size, shape,
and capacity. Queen Charlotte’s Sound, in the centre
of the group, 25 miles long, with one entrance 3, and
the other 6 miles broad, is a gigantic ocean dock,
capable of berthing the whole British navy. But
the wooded hills rise so abruptly from the waters of
these hundred and one harbours that many of them
scarce offer a hundred acres for the plough ; and until
New Zealand is equipping an armament for the con-
quest of Japan, or the repression of France in the Pacific,
most of these ocean docks will prove ornamental rather
than useful to her good Province of Marlborough.
At the same time it should be observed that the land
around some of them, broken as it is, is land capable of
producing corn and fruits in luxuriant abundance; and
looking at the fine position of these ‘ hundred havens'
on Cook’s Strait, at their centrality of position between
the two provincial capitals of Wellington and Nelson,
at the abundance of fish and timber they afford, at the
fine climate and magnificent bay and forest scenery
they possess, there can be no doubt that, as population
spreads, some of them will become the seats of flourish-
ing little communities of fishers, _sawyers, shipwrights,
small farmers, health-recruiting visitors, and others, and
maintaining ready communication with each other,
and with the markets of Nelson and Wellington, by
* The honour of being, or becoming, the capital of Marlborough seems,
as yet, to be a point rather in dispute between Blenheim and Picton.


small steamers and coasters, yawl and yacht; while,
dominating the noble waters of Queen Charlotte’s Sound,
says Mr. Hursthouse, “‘Macaulay’s Traveller ’ may
one day see some great metropolis of the Pacific, in
which South Britain will have her London, her Ports-
mouth, her Pembroke, combined.”
Canterbury.
Canterbury, the great central province of the South
Island, is about a third of the size of England and
Wales. Its extreme length, north-east and south-west,
is nearly 200 miles; its greatest breadth from east to
west, about 170 ; its coast line, 400. The colonist popu-
lation is now 20,000, the native about 500.
Canterbury was founded by a brilliant association of
peers, bishops, and commoners, patriotically interested in
improving the character of British colonisation; and
Lyttelton, its port town (south lat. 434°, 180 miles
by sea from Wellington, and 200 from Otago), together
with Christchurch, its young city of the plains, may be
said to have been planted by John Robert Godley, James
Edward Fitzgerald, and a body of pioneer colonists, in
1850.
Port Yictoria, the harbour of Lyttelton, though in-
ferior in some respects to the Cook’s Strait and northern
harbours, is a line land-locked ocean-inlet, and its dupli-
cate planted at Deal would be a cheap bargain to British
commerce at the price of ten millions sterling.
Lyttelton,now counting some 2000 inhabitants, is a neat
infant town, presenting an air of regularity and finish
seldom seen in the young settlements of a New Land.
It is surrounded by a belt of precipitous hills, climbing
which, we see beneath us the famous Canterbury plains
—“three millions of acres rolling back in gentle rise,
forty miles to the foot of the central highlands, watered
by twenty rivers, and spreading north and south further
than the eye can reach.”
A deep fringe of fine cattle-grazing and agricultural
land extends along the seaboard of this noble plain ; but
the great inland portion of it is a true pastoral country,
covered with perpetual herbage, and well suited, as the
great wool export proves, for the breeding and depas-


turing of sheep. It is bare of timber, and is at present
a monotonous-looking, ugly country, interacted by many
rapid streams, difficult to_ ford when swollen—but
building timber and fencing stuff lie at hand in
the forests of Banks’ Peninsula, planting may be resorted
to, farms and stock stations, squatter’s homestead and
shepherd’s hut, with their paddocks and patches ot
garden and corn-field, are dotted over it in every direc-
tion, flocks and herds are spreading from point to point,
and it deservedly ranks as the greatest district in
either island and as the true domain of the golden
Christchurch, the rural capital of the plains, about
eight miles from Lyttelton, over the harbour hills, plea-
santly situated on the river Avon, now counts about
5000 inhabitants, and is, we think, destined to become
one of the most considerable inland towns which JNew
Zealand will ever exhibit.
The physical difficulty, if we may so express it,°t
the Canterbury Province has been the connecting of the
port town of Lyttelton with Christchurch and the gieat
interior plains. This difficulty, however, has been much
lessened by the introduction of small steamers plying
from Lyttelton harbour up the river Avon to within a
couple of miles of Christchurch, and will, ere long, be
entirely overcome by the completion of a short railroad
from Christchurch to Lyttelton tunnelled through the
harbour hills, when the great wool country of the interior
will lie open to the port. , ,
The principal small Settlements of the Canterbury
Province are Kaiapoi, a rising village port ten miles from
Christchurch on the banks of the Courtenay, Lan-
giora, and Timaru, together with Akaroa, Port Levy,
and Pigeon Bay, in Banks’ Peninsula. Akaroa. origi-
nally a small. French Settlement, abandoned by the
French when New Zealand, became a British Colony, is
one of the finest harbours in New Zealand ; and these
little peninsulated Settlements, all possessing excellent
ports, and all lying within three or four hours run ot
the provincial metropolis, will soon, we think, become
thriving little communities busily engaged in supplying
fish, fruits, vegetables, and firewood for the shipping
and town of Lyttelton, and fence-stuff and building-
timber for the Shepherd Princes of the Plains.


Otago.
This fine, -and now far-famed, Province, bounded
on the north by Canterbury, has an extreme length of
150 miles, a breadth of 180, a coast line of 400, and
an area of 17 millions of acres, nearly equal to that
of the whole of Scotland.* Including the diggers, some
of whom will leave the Province, but more of whom,
probably, will come and stay, the population of Otago
must now amount to nearly 50,000 —the Natives num-
bering only 500 or 600.
The western coast of this great territory, like that
of Canterbury and Nelson, consists mainly of a rugged,
forest-smothered, Alpine, country, offering little or
no land for plough or fleece; but the eastern and
more central portions present a chain of well-wooded
well-watered agricultural and pastoral districts of
great fertility, and there is perhaps no province in
New Zealand which will eventually come into the mar-
kets with greater quantities of corn, and meat, and wool.
In these days, however, Otago is chiefly remarkable
for her gold fields. Discovered in June, 1861, they soon
drew over some thousands of people from Yietoria ;
up to June, 1863, they had produced nearly £3,000,000,
are still yielding rich results, and have done more to
advance Otago in a few months than had been done
before in many years.
Dunedin, the capital of the Province, lying in latitude
45|°, at the head of a beautiful loch-like harbour, 200
miles by sea from Lyttelton, and 150 from Invercargill,
Avas planted by an association of members of the Free
Kirk of Scotland, headed by Captain John Cargill, and
a body of hardy Scotch pioneers, in 1848. Owing to
auriferous attractions, it has sprung, almost in a day,
from a village into a bustling town, and should the Dig-
gings continue to yield results like those of the first
year or two, Dunedin may soon become a smaller second
* The fact of Otago being sometimes spoken of as the Scotland
of New Zealand leads to an injurious misconception as to her cli-
mate. The thermometrical table at page 11 shows that in mean annual
temperature the climate of Otago is only six degrees colder than that of
Nelson, while in regard to inch rain-fall Otago would appear to possess
the driest climate of any Province. The tree fern, the tree fuchsia, and
other tender plants flourish through the winter in the woodlands of Otago,
just as they do in the forests of the North; while the Kakariki, a delicate
little parroquet, is just as common a bird, winter and summer, around
the wooded shores of Foveaux Strait, as it is about the coasts of Cook’s
Strait, or the waters of the Waitimata.


Melbourne, count her 50,000 citizens, and pare her
streets with gold.
Southland.
This Province, until 1861 a part of Otago, may be
described as a large compact slice of territory cut
out at the south-central portion of Otago, and en-
tirely surrounded by it except at the south, where
young Southland has her 60 miles of frontage on
Foveaux Straits, and her ports and little Settlements
of Riverton, Invercargill, and Campbell Town at the
Bluff. The province is about twice the size of Northum-
berland, and will soon number some 5000 pioneer
Settlers: the natives and half-castes counting about
400. Southland contains a very large proportion of fine
agricultural and grazing land, and there is, we think,
no part of the Colony where there is now so much
unoccupied good land lying open and contiguous to a
port town.
Invercargill, the young capital of the province, well
named after one of the pilgrim fathers of Otago, in
latitude 46|°, is about 150 steamer-miles from Port
Chalmers, and five days’ smart run from Melbourne.
It stands at the mouth of New River, capable of
receiving steamers and vessels of moderate size—larger
ships frequenting the great harbour of the Bluff about
ten miles distant. Invercargill, -with her suburbs, in
these her infant days, counts about 2000 inhabitants, a
well-conducted paper, and a couple of banks; and bids
fair to become one of the most flourishing of all the
southern ports.
The climate along the coasts of Foveaux Straits is wet
and boisterous, but dryer and more settled inland.
Southland occupies, climatically, about the same relative
position to the warmer North Island provinces as York-
shire does to Devonshire ; and it is probable that in its
southern districts the more delicate Australian Merino
will not be found to thrive so well as would the Leices-
ter, Cotswold, or Down. But the note at page 58 applies
equally to Southland as to Otago ; and, except for the
old Indian, or the delicate or invalid emigrant, the
climate of Southland would be found just as suitable,
just as salubrious, as that of any province in New Zea-
land.
The best Australian road to some of the Otago gold


fields lies through this province, via Invercargill and
Lake Wakatip; and looking at the large proportion
of fine land which Southland possesses; at her cen-
tral port of Invercargill, and at the near and nohle
harbour of the Bluff (the nearest settled harbour in New
Zealand to the great antipodal mart and market of Mel-
bourne) we should say; that, at the present time, there is
probably no province in the Colony offering a finer field
for the Capitalist, Farmer, Grazier, Trader, Mechanic,
and Labourer.
Stewakt’s Island.
Stewart’s Island, opposite Invercargill, about thirty
miles across the Strait, will, eventually, perhaps, be
colonised and attached to Southland as an Island
County. Some little mixed communities of tens and
twenties, composed of old whalers, natives, and half-
castes, are scattered about the bays. It is well wooded,
and possesses some fertile little valleys, together with
several excellent harbours —Paterson’s Inlet and Port
Pegasus being two of the finest in New Zealand.
Communication between the Pkovinces. —Several
steamers ply along the coasts, and keep up a communi-
cation between the various Provinces and their several
ports ;* while a fleet of small craft is continually plying
round the coasts, from Province to Province, and from
trading-post to station. Thus, save at New Plymouth,
where the sea-journeying facilities are fewer, the New
Zealand tourist, man of business, or emigrant-traveller
(seeing a little of the country beforerhe chooses his loca-
tion and invests his money), has seldom to wait more
than a day or so in any one Settlement without finding-
some means of prosecuting his journey to another.
Hoads. —As yet New Zealand’s artificial roads are
confined, for the most part, to circles of country sur-
rounding the chief Settlements. A great central trunk
road, has, however, been commenced at Auckland. It
will be carried northward 150 miles to the Bay of
Islands, and southwards some 400 miles, to Wellington,
and when entirely finished will exhibit branch roads
to each chief Settlement lying along the coast on either
side. About forty miles of the northern, and forty of
the southern portion of this main highway have been
* See Table, page 3.1.


opened ; and as both the General and Provincial Govern-
ments have a strong interest in this great work, we hope
very few years will now elapse ere it is completed.
Some considerable local roads have also been made in
the various Provinces; whilst, by beach or by inland
paths, plains, and passes, New Zealand is traversable, in
a rough way, from north to south. Prom Auckland to
New Plymouth, via Kawhia, there is a seven days’ foot
post-road, by the native villages and stations along the
beach and cliffs; and from New Plymouth to Wellington
through Wanganui, a somewhat similar eight days’ road
is found —practicable both for horse and foot. There is
also a foot post-road by native paths and villages from
Auckland to the Ahuriri, passing partly through the
beautiful Waikato country named at page 46.
Mr. Hursthouse tells us, that visitors and colonists
bush travelling in New Zealand, generally provide them-
selves with a native attendant or two, as guides, caterers,
ferrymen, and companions ; carry a couple of blankets,
some tobacco, and a little tea, a light gun for duck and
pigeon, trust to native villages for pork, poultry, and
potatoes, and bivouac at night before a rousing_ forest
fire of a dozen trees. Twenty miles a-day is fair pro-
gress ; and with a comrade or two, and a couple of
native guides, New Zealand bush travelling, he says, in
variety of adventure, in scenery, in ludicrous mishaps,
and robust enjoyment, alternated by fits of intense dis-
gust, beats hollow a Highland walking tour, and might
test even the powers of the Alpine Club.
Land travelling in the South Island is generally
performed on horseback. A visitor or exploring emi-
grant would now ride from Nelson to Christchurch
in about seven days, and from Christchurch to Dunedin
in about ten, stopping at some sheep or cattle station
almost every night. Bush inns, and here and there,
by ferry and pass, the little nucleus of some gathering
village, are beginning to dot the ivay; while, looking at
the marvellous progress of New Zealand in the last ten
vears, glancing at the level, open character of most of the
east-coast country of the South Island, and remembering
that Canterbury is already active in the field, we venture
to predict that the day is not very remote when there
will be cheap tiam-railway communication through five
hundred miles of grass country from Cook’s Strait
through the Wairau and the plains of Canterbury down
to Otago and the great southern harbour of the Bluff,


CHAPTER VIII.
VOYAGE. —SHIPS. —OUTFITS. —PASSAGE MATTERS. —FIRST
STEPS OH ARRIVAL.
The Voyage. Clipper ships, favoured with fair
breezes, now make the run to Hew Zealand in 80
days; but the average passage is 100. If the vessel
be not driven from her course by adverse winds, she
will sail near the track marked on the accompany-
ing map, a distance of 14,000 English miles. Save that
there is no stopping to change horses, this long journey
may be said to consist of four stages: the first, from
Gravesend to the Cape de Yerds, which are often
sighted—the second, to Tristan d’Acunha (not often
seen) near the parallel of 40°, where at a distance off of
about 500 miles the vessel is rounding the Cape of Good
Hope—the third, to where she is running, past the Island
of St. Paul’s (sometimes seen)—and the fourth, from
little St. Paul’s to her journey’s end.
Our lady readers, glancing at the map track, might
fancy that all the way from Portugal to the Cape it would
be nicer and nearer to sail more in shore. It is not only
safer, however, to keep away from land, but by so doing
better winds are secured; and if by sailing on a longer
line a vessel gets into winds blowing her along ten and
twelve miles an hour, night and day, the extra distance
she steers to find such winds is amply made up to her
by the speed they enable her to travel at.
Unlike Canada and our North American colonies in
this respect, there is no particular season for sailing to
Hew Zealand. We certainly have to provide for more
Passengers from May to October than in the other six
months; but our ships sail regularly all the year round.
It is always comparatively hot for a week or two near
the equator, and always cool or cold in sweeping round
the Cape and St. Paul’s; but there is no real winter to
be encountered either in Hew Zealand or in going there,
and the practice of our Passengers is to sail when ready,
and not to wait for any particular month.
The voyage may seem, and really is, a long one; but
when passengers are pleasant with each other, especially


during the first unsettled week or two, which is always
the worst time, it passes away far more smoothly and
quickly than would generally be believed. Eating,
drinking, and sleeping, alone, occupy many an hour of
the four-and-twenty; then there is company and con-
versation, the weekly service of religion,* the solace of
books, chess and. draughts, evening song and occasional
dance, the meeting of other travellers on the deep, the
painted skies of tropical sunsets, and the novel sights of
dolphin and boneta, nautilus and flying fish, albatross
and frigate bird, shark and whale.
Some profitable employment, too, may he found on
board : some useful science or pursuit may be studied,f
while there are children and even adults to teach. We
have known father and boys fructify many an idle hour
making a useful fishing net; while mother and girls of
the humbler order of emigrants, providing little stores
of calicoes and cottons, will make up little stocks of
apparel worth good pounds to the family on arrival.
Thus, what with one thing, what with another, the
time passes away; and though in 80 or 100 days at
sea there will be tedious hours, the reflective emigrant
easily endures them when he remembers that emigra-
gration is a tonic medicine, saving or restoring us, and
that the voyage it entails is the mere smack of bitter
tasted for the moment as we take the draught.
As to health and safety, a voyage to Australia or
Hew Zealand in a first-class, well-found, well-com-
manded vessel is now made without fear or risk.
The improvement in the construction of ships, the
higher training and education of captains and officers,
the discoveries of experience in perfecting ventilation,
the aids of science in enabling us to store our liners
with fresh provisions and abundant water, have so re-
duced the “perils of the sea,” that among the many
thousands of passengers whom, in the last twenty years,
we have conveyed to New Zealand, the mortality , espe-
cially among infants, has actually heen less than the
returns of the Registrar General shore would have
occurred among an equal number of people living
ashore.
* When among our passengers there is no Minister of Religion to take
Sunday morning Service, the Commander, or some obliging volunteer,
reads Prayers to all on Board in the Chief Cabin, or, in fine weather, on
the Poop.
f In going to any of the Settlements of the North Island, some of our
passengers nave now and then procured Archdeacon Williams’s Maori
Dictionary and Grammar, and learnt a little of the Native Language.
The price of this work is, we think, 65., at Stanford’s, 6, Charing Cross.


The Crosby Square Like of Packets to New
Zealand was established just twenty years ago, soon
after the colonisation of the Islands first commenced.
In this period, despatching some hundreds of -vessels,
we have conveyed to the Colony no inconsiderable part of
its present population ; and we could not, we think,
adduce a stronger proof of the rapidly-increasing popu-
laxity of New Zealand as an emigration field than by
naming the fact that no fewer than three Lines of Ships,
Messrs. Shaw and Savill’s, Messrs. Houlder’s, Messrs.
Wilson and Chambers’, have lately been started in
the New Zealand trade, and all, we believe, with more
or less success.
Our Packets, vessels of from 1500 to 2500 tons, load
in the East India and London Docks, drop down to
Gravesend, and then proceed down Channel, without
stop or call, to their various New Zealand ports. We
do not advertise them quite so freely as our neighbours
—not, perhaps, experiencing the necessity of so doing,
but they always appear at least once in the Times;
while every information as to Ships on the Berth, Ports
of Destination, and Days of Sailing, may always be
obtained by addressing a line to any ot our country
Agencies, or to ourselves.
Provisioning Ships—Bill of Fare. Our Chief-cabin
Passengers, the same as in the Indian Lines, are sup-
plied with an “ unlimited tablebut as this, to our Lady
readers, may sound rather a vague term, we would
observe tbat our Packets are now all stored and pro-
visioned to enable them to set out a table equal to that
named in the note below by the author of a well-known
work on New Zealand who was once a Passenger by
our Joseph Fletcher.*
Indeed, as, for twenty years, a large number ot our
Chief-cabin Passengers have been those who have come
to us through the recommendations of friends pre-
ceding them to the Colony by our Ships, and as these
recommendations are based partly on a satisfactory
table, we find it to be most conducive to our interests to
conduct our sea “ housekeeping ’’ on a liberal scale, and
we venture to think that in this respect those who how
entrust to us the business of conveying them to New
Zealand will have no reason to complain.
* In his Essay on Wavren Hastings, Macaulay, speaking of the Indian
Voyage, says, ‘ most passengers find some resource in eating twice as
many meals as on land.’ This is the great Historian’s facon de purler
__ we eat three meals a-day ashore, we don’t eat six at sea stul


Wines and Spirits. —ln the lines to India and
Australia, and in the New Zealand Company’s early
ships, the custom was to charge so much for a cabin,
inclusive of drinks; and shipowners, to protect them-
selves from possible loss through the over free consump-
tion of wines and spirits, levied, on all passengers alike,
a sort of “ alcoholic toll,” frequently as high as £l5 and
£2O per head. Now, in the Indian lines, where the
passengers were civil and military officers, writers, and
cadets, many of them single young men, with like tastes
and purses, this system might be fair enough; but on
our establishing the Crosby Square Line we were struck
with its injustice when applied to New Zealand ships.
Under this system it is evident that a gentleman going
to New Zealand with his wife and family, people of
temperate, perhaps almost abstaining habits, might,
under the common toll, be mulcted a sum of £5O for
drinkables where their consumption of them would not
be £lO ; while the bon vivant in the opposite cabin, pay-
ing under the same common toll £l5, might punish the
ship’s cellar to the extent of £3O.
Here, then, we determined to break through the
custom of the trade, to put on board a stock of whole-
some drinkables, publish a tariff of reasonable prices,
and leave each gentleman to order the steward to put
before him what he wished to have. This arrangement
after the first week or two, the “ Dinners of the Deep ’’ are often good,
the appetite comes with the eating, and in my last trip to New Zealand,
where we were fortunate enough to have an excellent cook and steward,
and where our remarkably fine weather all the way from the Channel to
Cook’s Strait enabled us to preserve all our live stock, our feats of knife and
fork, to the best of my recollection, were much as these ;

has given universal satisfaction, and has gradually

* The difference between poop cabin and chief cabin is, that in the
latter the sleeping berths are under the poop, and the reason why the
charge for poop cabins cannot be published is this— that, being standing,
permanent parts of the ship, they of course vary in size with the size and
build of the ship. Thus, while one ship might have poop cabins each
equal to the accommodation of two passengers, another might have poop
cabins of which some might not be large enough for two, and of which
others might be large enough for a little family party of three or four.
In the chief cabin, on the contrary, where the cabins are not standing
permanent parts of the ship, but where they are constructed specially for
the voyage, they are built up of one uniform model size, and can tints

Though the passage to New Zealand now seldom ex-
ceeds 15 weeks, provisions according to the above scale,
by a very wise Government order, are put on board for
a period of 22 weeks, together with an abundant supply
of extra stores as medical comforts for passengers
generally.
REGULATIONS OF THE LINE.
ENGAGING PASSAGE. —The earlier cabins and berths can
be secured, of course the greater the choice. A deposit of one-
half (forfeited in case of non-embarkation) is paid on engaging
the passage : it can be remitted from the country by post-office
orders, or, when large in amount, by banker’s draft.
SEEING THE SHIP.'We are always pleased that our ves-
sels should be inspected by intending emigrants or their friends,
for we know that they will bear inspection. But after our ships
arrive home on their return voyages from China, India, Aus-
tralia, or New Zealand, with their cargoes of tea, silk, wool, or
what not, we always give them a thorough overhauling; and
if any of our country friends should happen to go down to
look at the finest packets of our the finest ship afloat,
when they are in this “ stripped ” state, or even when they are in
dock taking in cargo and finishing fitting up, they would find
them in a very disorderly, slatternly, condition—far worse than
washing-day at home. Indeed, the difference between a ship in
dock receiving her stores and freight, with her sails unbent,
her decks lumbered up with cargo, and the same ship at
Gravesend or in the Channel, all bright, clean, and orderly,
cannot be appreciated by those who have not had a practical
opportunity of judging; and if when a Passenger is looking
at our ships, there happen to be any first-class vessel for New
Zealand or Australia just about to leave dock, such vessel will give
him a more truthful idea of the real sea-going state of one of our
New Zealand packets than the particular ship he may think of
going by, if such ship be only 'preparing for her voyage.
FITTING UP CABINS. —Chief-cabin Passengers fit up their
own cabins.* Second and Third Cabin and Steerage Passengers
have berths built for them, but find their own bedding, and any
little extra fittings they may think they require. They also provide
themselves (according to the number of their party) with knives,
forks, spoons, tin dishes and baking dish, a saucepan or two,
cups, saucers, and mugs, metal tea and coffee-pot (a hook tea-pot
* Shepherd, 90, Bishopsgate, London, keeps a staff of experienced
workmen, and fits up cabins and berths of all sorts and provides all sea
furniture with economy and despatch.


DRINKABLES. —Ale, porter, wines, and spirits, are put on
board, and supplied at the following rates ; but, under the provi-
sions of the Passengers’ Act, spirits cannot be supplied to any
other than chief cabin passengers, save and except as “ raedica
comforts,” under the sanction of the Surgeon; while for the
strict preservation of order and sobriety in the ship, and for the
good of all, the quantity of wine and spirits supplied to any
Passenger is never allowed to be excessive.

to hang on the bars of the stove is very handy), water-cans with
lids (equal to holding a gallon for each member of the family)
and bags, tins, or canisters, to hold a week’s small stores and
half a week’s rations ; together with wash-bowl, four lbs. of
marine soap, towels, brush and comb and slop pail with lid. A
dozen or two hooks to screw into the ceiling and sides of the
berth, some tacks, a couple of gimblets, a claw hammer, and a
ball of strong string, will also be found useful ; and a small filter,
though not necessary, is occasionally taken [in the second cabin,
together with a small safety lantern, and six lbs. of composition
candles.
BEDDING. —Beds, or (better) good new mattrasses, should be
of these dimensions :—Single female, 5J feet by 18 inches;
men’s, 6 feet by 20 inches; married couple, 6 feet by 36 inches.
Bolsters and pillows to match, and for each mattrass two or three
pairs coarse sheets, two blankets, and one strong coverlet. The
Third Cabin and Steerage clothing outfit is described at page 80.
COOKING—This, for the Second and Third Cabin and Steer-
age, is done at the public stoves, by the Cooks of the Ship ; and,
here, Passengers prepare their own favourite dishes, make their
own arrangements for forming themselves into little parties for
messing, and keep their own compartments clean and comfortable. *
ISSUING STORES and RATIONS.—The Steward and one
of the officers of the ship issue the stores and rations to Second
and Third Cabin and Steerage Passengers, at a fixed hour,
generally as follows ;—water every day, meat and large stores
every second day, groceries and small stores once a-week.
4= The assistance of one or two of the ship’s boys is given in cleaning
the Second Cabin.


LUGGAGE.—Chief cabin Passengers carry 40 cubic feet mea-
surement, Second cabin, 30 feet, and Third cabin and Steerage, 20
feet of luggage free of charge; the remainder, ifany,ispaidfor at the
rate of Is. §d, per cubic foot. Boxes intended for the cabin should
not exceed 2 feet 3 inches long, 1 foot 8 inches broad, and 1 foot
3 inches high. Luggage forwarded from the country for shipment
must be carriage paid. The name of the passenger and the port of
his destination should be painted on each case or package ; and
then each should have a card tacked on bearing this direction: —
“ To be delivered at the London Docks, per New Zealand ship
• •” All passengers’ luggage and goods should be deli-
vered at the docks three days before the sailing of the ship.
N.B.—The luggage necessary to have in the cabin should be marked
“ cabin,” and that the most likely to be “ wanted on the voyage” should
bear these words, so that it may be stowed in the hold where it can be
got at. The linen, &c., required by intermediate and fore-cabin pas-
sengers for the first week or two is best packed in a handy bag, and all
bedding should be clearly marked “cabin.”
Every care will be taken of Passengers’ baggage, but no responsibility
m respect of it attaches to the ship unless a bill of lading is taken.
This is recommended when there is much extra luggage, and then each
package must be marked and numbered.
In cases where passengers are taking goods or a large quantity of
effects, requiring the services of a Custom House agent for clearing,
we shall always be happy to undertake such business on being supplied
with the particulars required in the schedule at page 71.
EMBARKATION,— Chief Cabin Passengers, and generally a
portion of the Second, embark at Gravesend the day after the ship
has left dock 5 but Third Cabin and Steerage Passengers will find it
better to embark in the docks. Trains to Gravesend, 30 miles off,
leave the Fenchurch Street Station about every hour and a half.
At Gravesend, the vessel anchors about half a mile from the
pier, and remains there about 24 hours. Shore boats put pas-
sengers on board at the rate of 6d. per head when there is a
party of four. To save themselves expense, fore cabin passengers
from the country, after they have all ready to start, should write
and ask us what day they must be at the Docks. We would
caution them, too, when in London, to give the cold shoulder to
any strangers who may kindly offer to assist them in any little
matter ; for sometimes there are even decent-looking men prowl-
ing round the docks and dock streets, whose room is better than
their company. If any little difficulties arise, Country Passengers
should at once come to us.
JV.B. — When there is a large family 'party, or a party of
friends going together, especially in the Second and Third Cabins,
it will be found a capital plan for one or two of the most active
members of it to come up to the ship three or four days before
the rest, so as to complete the various little arrangements, such
as those named at images 72 and 73, for making the cabins and
berths comfortable, and to get so much at-home on board as to
enable them to receive and, welcome the rest.


SHIPMENT OF GOODS and FREIGHT. —We respectfully
request the attention of Passengers and Shippers, sending up
goods to our care, to the following directions —an observ-
ance of which will save delay, and tend to prevent mis-
takes.
A letter of advice should always be sent to us at the time
the goods are despatched, giving the following particulars
Ist,—The marks and numbers or addresses inscribed on the
packages.
(These should in all cases be legibly written or painted on the pack-
ages before they are sent off.)
2nd.—The number and description of packages, and a
general statement of their contents and value.
3rd. —The time when, and the conveyance by which, the
goods are going to be sent.
4 th. —Whether the carriage to London has been prepaid.
{ln all cases, where practicable, it is desirable that the carriage
should be pre-paid.)
sth.—The name of the consignee to whom the goods are
to be delivered in the colony.
6th. —Whether insurance is required, and, if so, the
amount.
(If the goods are packed in tin or tarpauling, to be stated .)
7th. —Whether the freight is to be paid in London or the

N.B.—The shipping charges and insurance must always be
paid in London, and a considerable saving may be effected
by paying the freight also.
The charge for small packages, if under 3 cubic feet, is 10*. Gd. pay-
able here, 21.?. payable in colony; 3 cubic feet and upwards, 21 s, payable
here, 31s. Gd. payable in colony.
Shipping charges (exclusive of carriage to London) if not pre-paid,
from Bs. to 12s. per package, according to size and value.
Insurance about 30s. to 40s. per cent.
A saving of time will be effected by ordering the goods to be delivered
to the care of Willis, Gann, and Co., at the docks where the ship is
loading.
“ Out at Sea.”
The following quotations from an excellent little
pamphlet called “ Out at Sea,’’ by Mr. P. B. Chadiield,
published by G. Street, 30, Cornhill, may interest some
of our Lady Readers, and furnish a useful hint or two
for our second and third-cabin friends.


Character of the Captain. —As much of the comfort of a sea
voyage depends upon the character of the Master, or, as he is
popularly termed, the “ Captain,” no hesitation need he felt in
choosing at once that vessel which is commanded by a master
who has gained a character for kindness and consideration to-
wards his passengers. More difference exists in this respect be-
tween masters than in mere skill and seamanship, as no man is
ever trusted with the command of a vessel without possessing
the necessary knowledge of his profession requisite for the pro-
bable safety of his ship ; but no certificate being at present re-
quired regarding his behaviour towards his passengers, it some-
times happens that a man of morose disposition and bearish
manners has the comfort and welfare of several hundred human
beings confided to his care. It is true that it is the interest of
the owners or agents to have their vessels commanded by masters
who study the comfort of their passengers, and such is generally
the fact; but when the reverse is unfortunately the case, no con-
sideration should induce anyone to take their passage in a vessel
so commanded.
Medical Man. —One other subject connected with the vessel
may be mentioned as worthy of consideration, viz. the character
of the medical officer. To any one in robust health this matters
but little; but when there are females and children it is a subject
of great importance. Elsewhere mention will be made of a few
medicines which should be taken by the emigrant ;* but diseases
and disorders may occur on board which require the help and
attention of a medical man, and, consequently, as there is but
one to be procured at sea, it is highly necessary that he should
be a man of humane and kind disposition.
Fore and Second-Cabin Stowage . — The water-can should
be secured in one corner by means of a strip of wood nailed
across, of sufficient depth to prevent the chance of the can being
upset, and yet not so high as to prevent its being lifted easily in
and out of its place. Over the water-can, at a convenient height,
should be nailed another strip of wood, to support a shelf for the
wash-bowl, and a small strip of wood should then be tacked on
for a ledge, to prevent the wash-bowl from sliding off. These
strips of wood should be prepared on shore, as it is not always
easy to get the necessary wood and tools on board ship. The
slop-pail should be secured by means of a hook screwed into the
side of the berth, at a proper height for the handle of the pail to
* This might possibly be necessary some years ago in second-class Lines,
but it is certainly not necessary now, at least not in our Ships; and the
Emigrant would only spend his money in providing nauseous drugs,
which if they did not first break in his box and spoil his clothes he would
toss overboard on arrival.


hook and unhook easily. The corner of the berth that is
farthest from the door is the most convenient situation for it.
The exact spot where the hook should be placed is easily
ascertained by placing the pail in its desired position, and then
marking the spot where the hook would allow the pail to be
lifted on and off easily, and at the same time allowing the
weight of the pail to rest on the floor—the hook being merely
used to prevent the pail from being upset by the motion of the
vessel.
Plates and Dishes should be hung up against the sides of the
berth. It is advisable to fasten a string across the place where
they are hung, to prevent their making a disagreeable noise when
the ship is in motion.
Cups, Saucers, Knives, Forks, and Spoons. —The cups may be
hung on hooks, from the ceiling, and the saucers, knives, and
forks, placed in loops formed by strips of tape, tacked to the
sides of the berth, and at the proper distances, so as to form loops
of the proper sizes to suit the various articles in question.
Tins, Bottles, and Jars, for the rations, should be placed on a
shelf, made with a three or four inch edging, so as to prevent the
articles placed upon the shelf from being thrown off by the motion
of the vessel.*
The Clothes Bag may, most conveniently, be hung in a corner
over the bunk.
Other articles will be most out of the way, and soonest found,
when hung up round the sides of the berth ; for which purpose,
plenty of hooks with screws, gimblets, and tacks, should be pro-
vided, and also a small claw hammer.
Too great cleanliness cannot be practised with regard to the
table requisites, nothing being more disagreeable than finding
them dirty when they are wanted for use. They should, there-
fore, invariably be cleaned immediately after being used, and on
no account be put away dirty.
Attention to these little matters, trifling as they may appear,
makes the voyage comfortable, and conducive to health—a want of
it creates a series of petty annoyances, often resulting in loss of
both health and comfort.
Sea-sickness is one of those unpleasant, although temporary
* It is partly to get these little things done, that when there is a large
family or a party of friends going, especially in the Second and Third
Cabin, we recommend one or two of the most active members of it to
come up two or three days before the rest. Passengers are apt to put off
little arrangements of this kind to the last moment, and hence it is that
we sometimes see so much bustle and confusion at the eleventh hour of
a ship’s sailing.


afflictions which “ flesh is heir to,” and which may, like many
others, be alleviated, but not altogether avoided. The best anti-
dote is to live temperately a week or so before going on board,
and to take a dose of aperient medicine. When the symptoms
commence, a drop or two of creosote in a dessert spoonful
of water will be useful. To persons of strong constitution
a good draught of porter will do wonders. The rest must be
left to time.*
Extka Comforts. —We believe our passengers, for
the last twenty years, have found the scale of our sea-
housekeeping such as to provide them with all neces-
saries, and all common comforts too ; but for the benefit
of delicate passengers, or for families where there are
many young children, we give the author’s following
remarks on the subject of extra comforts :
“In times of sickness, or rough weather, when the stomach is
unsettled, some little article or other may tempt the appetite
when the ship’s rations could not be taken. To women and
children a few little comforts are always welcome, and are in some
cases necessary. As the means and tastes of emigrants vary so
much, the following list of the most useful articles of extra provi-
sions is given, from which the intending emigrant may select ac-
cording to his taste and means ; but there is certainly no article
mentioned that is not desirable if it can be afforded :—Cheese,
ham, herrings, sardines, ground coffee, tea, loaf sugar, dessicated
milk, preserves, biscuits, toasted bread, sago, arrowroot, onions,
eggs, spice, pickles, and dried apples.” f
Tins and bottles should be used as much as possible in packing
these little articles, in order to preserve them from the dampness
of the atmosphere, and also from rats or mice. Eggs may be
kept by smearing them with butter or lard, and packing in salt.
Bread Making. —The allowance of flour in the Third Cabin
and Steerage is not more than sufficient for a good supply of
puddings and a few scones or cakes; but in the Second Cabin
there is enough to enable the Passengers to make a moderate
supply of soft bread, for which a little of Berwick’s baking
powder should be taken.
* The author should have informed his readers that after the first
or “settling-down” week there is seldom any sea-sickness among pas-
sengers. He might further have added that after an attack of the
malady the passenger often feels better in health and spirits than he ever
did in his life; and that if, for some of their rich-living, aldermanic
patients, doctors would prescribe “a week in the Hay of Biscay,” they
would prescribe a better medicine than any in the Pharmacopoeia.
f Herrings, coffee, toasted bread, and sago, might well be struck
out here; a few fine biscuits and the other things are well enough, and
£2 or £3 would supply them. A little raspberry vinegar, too, and
some soda and acid, to make a cool effervescing draught in the tropics;
and a preparation of milk in the form of powder, called milk powder,
procurable, like the baking powder, at any of the Sea Grocery shops
n London, are nice things, but rather dear.


Messes and Mess Dinners.— Third-cabin and Steerage Pas-
sengers usually form themselves into Parties or Messes, equal to
about seven adults in number, for the purpose of drawing their
rations, cooking, and taking their meals. These little communities
have each a captain or managing man, selected from amongst them-
selves, for the purpose of looking after th.e interests of the mess.
Should the choice be an unfortunate one, his authority is soon lost,
as the individual members of the mess will soon find it much better
to look after their business themselves; but it is greatly to the
advantage of a mess when the choice happens to fall on a man of
energy and activity, who, by applying himself to his task with
zeal and ability, gains the confidence and support of the whole
mess. When this is fortunately the case, his voice not only car-
ries great weight with his own mess, but also with the officers of
the ship, and the interests of all meet with a proper degree
of attention.
It will be seen, by reference to the list of rations (page 67)
that in the Third Cabin and Steerage there would be, for a mess
of seven adults (or for a smaller number of adults and as many
children as made up seven adults), 7 lbs. weekly of preserved
meat—9 lbs. of beef—and 7 lbs. of pork, and this, with the
other rations, would supply the following dinners :
Sunday.— 3 lbs. preserved meat, with suet pudding and
raisins.
Monday.—3| lbs. pork, with pea-soup.
Tuesday.—lbs. beef, with preserved potatoes.
Wednesday.—li- lb. preserved meat, with boiled rice, and
suet pudding.
Thursday.—3,j lbs. pork, and pea-soup.
Friday.—2£ lbs. preserved meat, with boiled rice.
Saturday.— i} 2 lbs. beef, with potatoes.
This table is varied and enlarged by the remainder of the flour,
made into pastry or bread, or the preserved meat chopped up and
made into pasties. With a little management, too, other dishes
may be obtained, and the cook, or some obliging sailor, is always
ready to show Passengers how to make the most and best of
what they have in the cupboard.
Hot water is provided by the Cooks at 8 in the morning and 5
in the afternoon, for making tea or coffee.
The beef and pork should be steeped in water over night, in
fresh water if procurable, and the water changed early next morn-
ing. This not only extracts the salt, and improves the favour,
but also prevents the meat from shrinking so much in the process
of boiling.
The preserved potatoes should have a little boiling water poured
over them , and be covered over so that they may be well steamed.


A lillle butter, salt, and pepper may then be added, and the whole
well mashed up together. They are also much improved by being
browned in the oven.
Biscuits, when warmed through in the oven, are improved in
flavour, and rendered much tenderer and softer.
Slices of ham, bacon, or salt pork may be frizzled on biscuits,
in the oven, with great 'advantage, as the biscuits soak up the juices
of the meat, and are made much more palatable.
SooiAii and Domestic Life on Board.—Social life on board
ship differs very materially from any ordinary state of society on
shore. An “emigrant ship at sea” is a floating home for the
many families on board ; partaking in a great measure of the
character of a house, a ship presents the somewhat novel spec-
tacle of several grades and conditions of men, and their families,
for a time, domesticated in one habitation. Bound together by
the ties of mutual interest and common safety, the passengers on
board an emigrant ship forget or relax many of those artificial
barriers which too frequently separate different classes of society
on shore. The more affluent have an excellent opportunity of
alleviating the sufferings and discomforts of the sick and delicate
amongst their poorer fellow-passengers ; while, on the other hand,
even the poorest may, by a variety of little acts of kindness and
attention, help each other through the unforeseen difficulties and
inconveniences of their temporary ocean life.
It has been often remarked that in no phase or condition ot
society is the human character more strongly developed than on
board ship. The idle become more idle, the selfish more selfish,
and the disagreeable still more disagreeable. The explanation is
simple : all have their temper and patience severely tried by the
various annoyances and inconveniences unavoidable from so
many human creatures being crowded within the narrow limits
of even a commodious vessel.
Emigrants will, therefore, do well to be on their guard— to
remember that these trials have to be borne, that in nine cases
out of ten they are only aggravated by impatience and ill-temper,
and that any display of bad feeling is sure to recoil tenfold on
the party exhibiting it. When it is remembered how soon all
might be in want of assistance from Him who “holdeth the
waters in the hollow of His hand,” it must surely be confessed
that during a long voyage over the great ocean is a time of all
others when those Christian principles should be borne in mind,
which command us to “ do unto others as we would they should
do unto us,” and to “ love one another.”
Among the motley and varied family groups comprised in the
passenger list of an emigrant vessel, will always be found some


who, from many causes, are inadequately or badly provided for
the voyage. Poor families whose means are too small; women
with children going to their husbands, or children to their friends
or parents. In short, from various reasons, many who need
assistance and help. It should be a pleasure to do all in these
cases that your circumstances will permit, but it is a duty , and
a duty which ought not tojbe neglected; for, under these cir-
cumstances, the helpless need help, and the unprotected stand in
need of protection.
According to the rules of the ship, the passengers should rise at
seven o’clock in the morning, and retire to rest at ten o’clock in the
evening, at which hour all lights in the berths should be put out;
the only lights permitted after ten o’clock being the lamps kept
burning all night in each compartment of the vessel, and which
must be supplied and kept lighted by the officers of the ship from
dark each evening untd daybreak next morning. These rules, how-
ever, cannot always be strictly observed ; at the commencement
of the voyage, for instance, some are so indisposed that it is im-
possible for them to rise so early. Again, children may be ill
during the night and require attention, which it is impossible to
render them without the assistance of a light; but in such cases
the greatest caution should be observed, and a light must never
be used except in cases of absolute necessity. The only circum-
stances which warrant a breach of the rule respecting going to
bed at ten o’clock are when the hot weather, rain, or other causes
prevent a proper ventilation of the between-decks, in which case
many persons prefer sitting up somewhat later.
In the Second and Third Cabin and in the Steerage, Pas-
sengers keep clean their own private berths, and also the
cabin or compartment of the vessel in which their berths are
situated. The business of the day may therefore be considered to
commence with the thorough cleaning out of the general room or
cabin, which should be thoroughly cleaned and swept at least once
a day. The mode of cleaning generally in use on board ship is
scraping and sweeping; but it is also necessary to swill and
scrub the floor at least once a week.* As soon as this duty is
performed by the party whose turn it is to do it, the other occu-
pants of the cabin should be up and dressed, in time to prepare
for breakfast. The hot water for tea or coffee will be ready by
eight o’clock, at which time it must be used. After breakfast is
over, all necessary arrangements may be made for dinner, drawing
off rations and water, baking bread, roasting coffee, &c.
It is the duty of the medical officer to see that proper measures
are taken for the general health of the passengers, among which
* In our vessels, as before observed, one or two of the Ship’s Boys
assist in this work in the Second Cabin compartment


may be mentioned the cleaning before described, ventilation,
airing of the mattresses and blankets, and the personal cleanli-
ness of all the passengers.
At dinner the captain of the mess is supposed to carve the
meat and serve out the various dishes prepared for the mess,
after which he should see, as soon as dinner is finished, that the
plates, &c., are cleaned by the proper person, so that everyone
may put their dinner things out of the way clean, and ready for
use again when wanted.
The afternoon may generally be usefully employed, till tea-
time, in reading, writing, sewing, or other occupations, according
to the various tastes and acquirements of the passengers. At
five o’clock in the afternoon the water will again be ready for
tea, when all should at once attend to it, so that everything may
again be cleared and put away, and the tables cleaned and set at
liberty for other purposes. No regular supper is prepared on
board ship, but any parties who wish for it may easily save a
little from their dinners to serve as a supper.
Having now offered all the suggestions I can towards alle-
viating, in some degree, the inevitable though temporary incon-
veniences of a long sea voyage, to those who cannot afford the
comforts of the saloon, I can only wish them a safe and speedy
passage over the ocean, and hope that they may find in another
hemisphere a better and a happier home than they leave behind
them. To this end they must have a stout heart under all diffi-
culties, a clear conscience under all temptations, and trust in God
for the result.
Outfits. —Almost the only important question on
which practical New Zealand authorities materially differ
is the question of Outfit:—some almost recommend the
Emigrant to land with little more than a walking stick
and a wallet; others, to take almost every article from
house and mangle down to pepper-box and rolling-pin.
We wish we could tell our readers that the last advice
was the best, for if each of our Passengers would carry
some good bulky freight with him, he would he so much
the more a good customer. Judging, however, by the
ovidence of Colonists, who now so frequently visit the
Mother Country on trips of recreation and business, and
many of whom we have the pleasure of conveying hack,
we are bound to say that, in these present days, the
small outfit is better than the big one. Some years
ago, when the Colony was more in its infancy, and


before trade had made its channels, there were many
articles necessary for the emigrant to take which he
could now purchase in the shops and stores of the
Colony almost as advantageously, everything consi-
dered, as he could at-home, and New Zealand outfits
cannot now well he too small.
At the same time it should be said that the capitalist
or small capitalist going to New Zealand to embark in
some particular pursuit might still find it better to
take with him certain special things needed in such
pursuit than to trust to getting them, just when he
wanted them, equally good and genuine in the Colony.
Here, however, it is obviously impossible to lay down
any general rule ; and here any of our readers, desiring
further information, should write to us and avail
themselves of the suggestion made at the end of our
Introductory Remarks.
We think, too, that when a family, breaking up any
little home or household, is about to have a_ Sale they
would do well, first, to put aside a few of their best and
most portable things to take with them. A little store
of table cutlery and linen, a few good blankets, a good
carpet or two, any little plate, a few good books and
prints, any little odds and ends of ornament and use
are easily packed, cost no great deal in freight, and are
familiar “bits of things” which it will be necessary or
S’ ant to have about one in the new house in the New
; while if any of them have to be replaced there,
as would probably be the case, they would cost full double,
possibly quadruple, the money they would fetch at the
Sale at-home.
With these two exceptions, however, and merely add-
ing that there should be taken a fair stock of clothing
of much the same description as would be worn in rural
life in England, including a good supply of strong,
water-tight, lace-up boots, we unhesitatingly say that,
in these days, in fitting out for New Zealand, the Pas-
senger’s motto should be, “ As much money as possible,
and as few things.”
Our Mechanic friends always take their most useful
tools, and both Mechanics and Labourers, in addition to
the following list of clothing, which is the least the
Government Inspector will let them embark with, should
take any little additional apparel they may possess, and
any little, box-packing, articles of handy use.


Clothing (the least) required for the Voyage by Third
Cahin and Steerage Passengers.
Children.
One warm cloak, or outside coat.
Two suits of outer clothing.
Six shifts, or shirts.
Tour flannel petticoats, or waistcoats.
Six pairs of stockings (half worsted).
Two pairs of good boots or shoes.
Hats and caps.
One or two pairs warm gloves.
Women.
One good warm cloak (made with a hood), or one good
warm shawl.
Two strong gowns, one to be warm.
Six shifts.
Two good flannel petticoats.
Six pairs stockings (half worsted).
Two pairs strong boots or shoes.
Hat, or bonnet, or caps.
One or two pairs warm gloves.
Men.
One good, warm overcoat.
Two suits of outer clothing.
Six shirts.
Two flannel or Guernsey shirts.
Six pairs socks, or stockings (half worsted).
Two pairs strong boots or shoes.
One Scotch or other cap, and a southwester or good
felt hat. (Black hats are not worn on board, nor yet in
the colony.)
The bedding and other things required for the voyage,
and for making Cabins and Berths comfortable in all
weathers, are described at pages 68, 69, and 73.
Taking Money. Small sums of money, of from
£5 to £lO, are generally carried in little purses of
sovereigns placed in the box; or, if preferred, a Post
Office order for any sum not exceeding £lo* may be
obtained at any Money Order office in this country, pay-
able at the office of the New Zealand port where the
Passenger is going to disembark. Larger sums are best
* No one order is made out for more than this amount, but any num-
ber of orders are issued. Thus, if the sum be £5O, flve £lO orders
would be taken.


taken in the form of “ Letters of Credit.” As we have
mentioned at page 32, there are now three London-New
Zealand Banks, namely, the Union Bank, 38, Old Broad
Street, the New Zealand Bank, .50, Old Broad Street,
and the Bank of New South Wales, 37, Cannon Street;
and the Passenger may call at any of these, pay in his
£lOO, or £5OO, or £5OOO, or whatever may be the sum he
is taking, and receive in return two copies of a docu-
ment called a “Letter of Credit,” addressed to the
manager of the Branch Bank of the Settlement in New
Zealand to which he is going; when on arrival and pre-
sentation of either of these documents the exact amount
of the money he paid in in London is handed him, if he
wish, in gold. Or, if he does not want to employ his
money at once, the Branch Bank will hold it for him,
and allow him a certain agreed-on rate of interest, or
will supply him with a check-book and open a regular
account Avith him, as a bank would do in England. As
we have said, he receives two* Letter-of-Credit docu-
ments—one of these he takes with him, and the other
he may direct to himself (in the form below) to the post-
office of the Neiv Zealand port he may be bound to
when, as it would go by the quick overland steam route,
it Avould generally arrive before him :

Passenger per Ship
Taking Servants. —Our Chief-cabin Passengers now
frequently take with them some favourite domestic
servant accustomed to the children, or some good mar-
ried labourer or handy working man whose wile will
* The object of giving two copies is to provide aga.nst the possibßJoss
of one. The passenger would eventually get his ® y case where even
lessly lost both his letters, but we have never known a cas
pne was lost, and the two are given to make assurance doubly


help a little in the house on arrival, generally under the
agreement that the passage-money shall he repaid, by
degrees, out of the high wages current in the Colony.
In"going to Auckland, too, as shown at page 38, 40 acres
arc now allowed for each person oyer eighteen, and 20
acres for each person between five and eighteen, who
may be taken out at the expense of any friend or em-
ployer ; while under the “Assisted Passage’’ regula-
tions of other Provinces we can occasionally get the
Government agents to pay half the cost of a third cabin
passage for any domestic, labourer, or labourer’s family
whom our Chief-cabin Passengers may wish to help out.
Insurance. —Looking at the trifling cost of insurance,
it ought not, we think, to be neglected by Passengers,
for in the finest ships afloat accidents, loss or
damage of goods, may occasionally occur. If effects are
well packed in zinc or tin, the rate we charge is 30s. or
355. per cent, on the value insured ; if ordinarily packed,
from 355. to 40s. Amounts exceeding £IOO should be
ordered to be insured as long as possible before sailing.
Arrival in the Colony.— On reaching their desti-
nation, our Passengers have the right of remaining on
board 48 hours after arrival, and in any little matters
of doubt or difficulty, sometimes arising when strangers
first land in a new country, the Consignees of our Ships
will gladly afford them any information or advice which
they may require. Furnished lodgings, cottages, and
plain comfortable family inns and boarding houses, are
now found in all the chief port towns.
Mechanics and Labourers cannot do better than get to
work as soon as possible on arrival, at or near the place
they land at, and thus _ commence at once to pocket
the high wages they will be offered. Where, how-
ever, there is a considerable capital to invest in agricul-
tural or pastoral pursuits, and the capitalist-emigrant
is not fairly satisfied with the particular neighbourhood
he may have come to, he may act wisely if he settle his
family in comfortable lodgings for two or three weeks,
and take a trip by one of the Steamers named at page
35, in order to see if there be any neighbourhood in
any other province which he would like better.
Concluding Remarks. —The Crosby Square Packets
are all first-class ships, constructed on some of the
finest models of combined speed and strength; and are
fitted up with the modern sanatory improvements
for insuring comfortable cabin-accommodation, light,


and ventilation. The Surgeons arc often family men
going out to settle in the Colony, while the Commanders
are experienced officers of high standing in their profes-
sion, accustomed to study the comfort of Passengers,
and long familiar with the Sea.
Here, too, in order to prevent our Readers from being
led away by false impressions on the subject, we may
perhaps offer a word or two as to the announcements fre-
quently made by Shipping Houses, respecting the “ busi-
ness they do,” the “ number of Passengers they carry,”
&Q, &C.
it is often proclaimed by them as a fact which they
fancy will enhance the merits of their Lines in the eyes
of the general Passenger Public, that they have obtained
“ contracts” from the various Colonial Governments for
the conveyance of what is called the “ Assisted Passage ’
emigration. How, as regards New Zealand, by far the
greater portion of this sort of emigration was for many
years conducted by our House, and we dare say it might
he so conducted still—but, of late, this Assisted Passage
business is one which, if we have not altogether with-
drawn from, is one which we have not been at all eager
to obtain. ...
In the first place, it cannot be carried on without
injuring the interests of those higher classes of Pas-
sengers who pay their own way —for it must be evident
that Saloon Passengers, and those in the Second and
Third Cabins are made far more comfortable in a Ship
where they have the whole of the space to themselves
than they can be in a Ship, ever so large, where the
presence of 200 or 300 men, women, and children in
the shape of the lower orders of Emigrants, more or
less crowds the decks, and materially increases the
chance of infectious disease.
In the second place, the great competition among the
various Houses which have lately launched into the N ew
Zealand Trade, and the natural eagerness of beginners
to secure, at any cost, some business, have so run down
this Assisted Passage contract trade, as to have made it
one with which we care to have little to do.
Doubtless, it might be possible to carry troops and
Government emigrants to New Zealand at £lO per head,
as the phrase runs, and with fine weather all the way to
land them all alive —but this would he a sort of Passenger
Business in which we should never be tempted to em-
bark ; and no amount of competition which may arise in
Or 2


the New Zealand Trade will ever lead ris to engage to
carry any classes of Passengers at lower rates than those
at which we know they can he safely and comfortably
carried.
As to New Zealand emigration generally, and inde-
pendently of this “ assisted passage” branch thereof, we
may mention that by far the greater number of Chief
Cabin and Second and Third Cabin Passengers who
have gone to New Zealand, together with returning
Colonists and their friends, have gone by our Packets,
and may add —not as boast, but as a fact which may-
be useful to such of our Readers as are looking to emi-
t ration, and as one in which we take some pride—that
uring the long period in which we have been engaged
in the New Zealand Trade the Crosby Square Line, in
freedom from accident, in comfort and quickness of
voyage, in high testimonials from Passengers and Go-
vernments, has not been surpassed by any Line, In-
dian or Australasian, sailing from the Port of London.
And we shall hope that our long experience in
equipping New Zealand vessels, our careful selection
of Captains and Officers, our endeavours, by a liberal
chief-cabin table and good provisioning throughout, to
ensure the comfort of those who entrust to us the
work of conveying them to the Antipodes, will enable
ns to uphold the good repute of our Ships, and to
retain that much-prized confidence of the New Zealand
Emigrant Public which for twenty years it has now
V.en our good fortune to enjoy.
APPENDIX.
Referring to the observations made in our introduc-
tory remarks on the “ Native Outbreak,” we would here
add that in the face of the grave emergency which
had arisen the Colonial Government, the Colonists, and
the Troops were all acting with promptitude and vigour,


The Government had despatched agents to Australia to
enlist volunteers, and it was hoped that a body of 5000
men would be obtained there, many of them of the
hardy Digger class, who would at once be made avail-
able in the field, and who, receiving grants of land,
would afterwards be located in semi-military Settle-
ments planted in the country confiscated from the Rebels;
the Troops were being admirably handled by General
Cameron and his officers ; while almost every Colonist in
Auckland and New Plymouth able to bear arms, was
active in the ranks of the Militia or Rifle Volunteers;
and if, in aid of these efforts, the Home Government
will at once despatch the help which has been asked for,
we think we shall soon be in a position to say that this
“Maori Rebellion” in New Zealand has been effectually
and for ever put down.
At the same time, we are bound to declare that the
Natives were mustering in great and formidable force ; *
as usual, too, they had commenced hostilities by murder-
ing any defenceless Settlers whom they could surprise;
and though, sooner or later, this Native Outbreak must
end in results which will make the North Island of New
Zealand a far wider and finer emigration field than
it has hitherto been, we hold it to be our duty to our
Readers to warn them, here, that the North Island of
New Zealand, in its present state, is not a country to
which families, at this moment, could prudently gof
A few months, possibly even a few weeks, may so
change the aspect of things as to show us that emigration
to Auckland and the North may soon be safely renewed.
But, meanwhile, and at present, such of our family
Readers as may be contemplating any speedy emigration
to this quarter should either pause awhile, or turn to the
South Island —a country, larger than England, where
* If, from a deficiency of strength on our side, the first affairs with the
rebels should be only partial or doubtful successes, various tribes or
sections of tribes, now wavering or neutral, would probably join their
nation in the fray, when, undoubtedly, they could bring into the field a
force of from 10,000 to 12,000 well-armed fighting men—a force which, look-
ing at the ambuscading character of the country, and at the guerilla nature
of the warfare, must be counted equal, in actual fighting power, to
double its numerical strength. And hence it is that it becomes so necessary
that the struggle should be commenced on our side with such a force as
would keep the neutral neutral, and prevent the flame from spreading
over the entirety of the island.
f We receive fresh news about the 15th of every month, and if after
such date any of our Readers who may be particularly interested in the
state of affairs in the North Island would drop us a line of inquiry we
should always be happy to tell them how things were going on.


there are no Natives—a country where, in the Pro-
vinces of Nelson, Canterbury, Otago, Southland, life|and
property are as secure as in Middlesex or Kent; and
where, in natural advantages of soil and climate and
in openings for the profitable employment of capital and
labour and for the creation of new and prosperous
homes, they would find Emigration Fields equal, if not
superior, to any in the world.
We make these concluding statements, as we have
made all others throughout the book, in the belief that
they are substantially true, and in no desire to exag-
gerate by one word the merits of any part of New Zealand
as an emigration field. As a commercial House engaged
in the business of conveying Passengers to New Zealand
it is of course our interest to promote emigration
thereto—but in attempting to serve ourselves by draw-
ing public attention to the Colony by means of this
little work, self-interest, if no better motive, would
make us careful not to exaggerate the merits of the
country. For if by highly-coloured statements any one
personally disqualified for the work of emigration were
tempted to go to New Zealand and should return home
again, unsuccessful and disheartened, his“ bad reports ”
of the country might well deter half-a-dozen other
people who might be well fitted to succeed there from
emigrating at all. Thus, the gain of one Passenger
might be the loss of many, and honesty, we are sure,
is never better policy than when it is shown in
describing New Countries in such a manner as, on
arrival, the Emigrant shall find the reality equal if not
superior to the expectation.
It has always appeared to us that the great difference
between the position of a man in a young and rising
Colony like New Zealand and his position in the Mother
Country is this—that here, owing fundamentally to
excess of population and excess of competition, a man,
whether he be a man living by his capital of labour, his
capital of money, or his capital of skill, very often toils
hard all the days of his life and leaves his family worse
off than ever at the end —whereas, in a young colony,
where there is a boundless extent of rich virgin soil,and
where injurious competition is a thing unknown, a man,
by the exercise of his labour, his capital, or his skill, may


not only enjoy a less toilsome careworn life than he
would in the Old Country, but may raise himself and
his family into a position of comparative wealth and
independence in other words and homely phrase, if we
work hard all the days of our life here, we often receive
no adequate return in the end for our toil—whereas,
if we are willing to work awhile in the New Land,
“ pay-day,” sooner or later, is sure to come.
We hold it to be indisputably true that in com-
bination of advantages New Zealand is our finest
Colony, the most pleasant, homelike Emigration
Field'we possess ; and we believe that, when it is wise
and prudent to emigrate at all, New Zealand is the
Colony which it would be the most wise and prudent
to choose. For steady industrious _ labourers and me-
chanics, for energetic active families possessed of a
little money, for small-capitalist and capitalist-emi-
grants, possessed of a few hundred or a few thousand
pounds, it is a Country of the brightest promise. Their
first year will be their “trial’’ year; but it should
never be forgotten that every day smooths their path—
that New Zealand is a young Colony in a stake of rapid
growth and transition that both from the Mother
Country, and even from less-favoured Colonies, popu-
lation bringing with it capital and Labour is steadily
flowing in, subduing the wilderness, planting the town,
increasing the value of property and that in the
natural order of things, fit and qualified families now
going to this young Britain of the South might expect
that in a few years their first rude dwellings in the
Bush, and the small privations of their probation
state, would be exchanged for the comfortable edifice
in the midst of cultivations, and for all the necessaries,
many of the luxuries, of Old-World life.
CHAPTER IX.
NEW ZEALAND DTJESUITS AND INVESTMENTS.
On these questions we are able to lay before our Readers
the following communication from a gentleman whose
personal experience of New Zealand, and of Colonies
generally, well qualifies him to discuss the interesting
subjects of which he treats: —


83 NEW ZEALAND PURSUITS AND INVESTMENTS.
18, Chalcot Crescent, Regent's Park,
London, September 1, 1863.
Gentlemen,
Still taking warm interest in New Zealand as a Colony
where many of my friends and relatives are settled, and where
some of my own happiest years have been spent, I gladly put off
Lincolnshire and the stubbles for a day or two to comply with
your request for a short Paper on some of the principal openings
found in New Zealand for the prof table employment of capital
and labour.
For the information of your Readers more immediately in-
terested in the subjects to which I have devoted most of my space,
I may remark that the “ New Zealand Farm ” has long been
a favourite study of mine, that many of my friends are ex.
tensively engaged jn agricultural and pastoral pursuits in that
country, and that I have not only held the plough there mysef,
but have paid some attention to it in Canada, Australia, the Cape
Colony, and the Stales.
I may perhaps observe, too, that the advantages possessed by
Neiv Zealand as a country for farming, grazing, and estate-
creating, and for the establishment of a pleasant home, were
the chief considerations which induced a large party of my people,
including my late father, (an old, experienced Lincolnshire agri-
culturist,) and various members of our family, to move there ; and
should pleasure or profit again lead me to a Colony, New
Zealand, I think, is the one which I should again choose.
The space to which I have limited my remarks has compelled
me to be brief; but I would observe that if any of your Readers
should desire further information on any subject I have touched
on, or, indeed, on any New Zealand matter, I should be happy
to afford it * by giving them an interview, or by replying to any
communications directed to my Town address as above.
Yours Indy,
Charles Hurst-house.

Agricultural and Pastoral Pursuits.—A young
Country endowed with, natural gifts enabling her to
become both a great agricultural and a great pastoral
Country is, of necessity, horn into the world a rich
Country. Gold fields, mines, fisheries, manufactories,
make her richer —but a Young Country which, in being
by nature both agricultural and pastoral in a pre-
eminent degree, is naturally capable of producing cheap
and plentiful supplies of Man s food and clothing, is
a Country which may dispense with all other indigenous
sources of wealth, and be well content to build up her
Sower and prosperity on the solid foundations of the
lough and the Fleece.
New Zealand, in her gold ores, oils, timber, and flax,
possesses a variety of indigenous produce and money-
bringing exports, and may some day figure in the world
with mines, mills, fisheries, and manufactories —but it is
her remarkable combination of natural gifts qualifying
her to become a great Country of Wool and Corn,
Hoof and Horn, which, more than all her other posses-
sions and capacities combined, will make her solidly
and permanently powerful, reputable, and rich.
Agricultural and pastoral Industries will, I think, ever
be New Zealand’s greatest Industries; and as these are
the Industries opening to us those favourite “ rural
pursuits ” which most of us who emigrate to this Colony
emigrate to embark in, I cannot perhaps do better than
devote most of my space to a consideration of the chief
subjects relating thereto, arranged in order following

Concluding Remarks .....
Price of Land.— -In the nine Provinces of New Zea-
land the various Government prices of wild land vary
from ss. to 40s. an acre; hut we may say that good
cultivable land, lying within fair and decreasing dis-
tance of markets, may still be purchased at prices
varying l from 1 5s, to 305. an aero j while in the iro-
vinces of Wellington, Hawkes’ Bay, Nelson, and Marl-
borough (in all of them I should say, but certainly in
some) lands, good and valuable, but which from their
present more remote position or more broken character
are called “ second-class” lands, can yet be purchased
at prices ranging from Bs. to 10s. per acre. Perhaps, if
we were to call the most common price of good, fair
land a pound per acre, we should_ not be far wrong—a
price at which, considering the climate, the easiness of
cultivation, the proximity; of towns and markets, and the
good government and society of the young country, the
lands of New Zealand are perhaps the cheapest in the
The terms are all, virtually, cash. But though the
Provincial Governments wisely give no credit for land
they amerce the buyer in no after costs. Here,
we buy a bit of a farm and then locust-lawyer with
his folios of barbarous conveyancing jargon eats up
half our farm’s first crop—but, in New Zealand, the
Government gives us a Crown title of a dozen lines
for a guinea, and the land is formally and legally our
freehold. , . , ,
At these prices, that common desire of mankind to
have “acres of one’s own” is easily gratified. In
England, this common desire cannot be gratified; for
land, here, is fast becoming a luxury no more within
reach of common people than pictures of Turner or
shawls of Cashmere. In New Zealand, for one year s
rent of an English farm, we may buy what will make us
a nice little estate of our own, or for a thousand pounds
or so get land enough for a Norfolk manor. At these
prices, too, except by the Squatters named hereafter,
little or no land is rented in New Zealand : we can rent
land in England—when we emigrate to an English


Colony we have land of our own. Thus, virtually,
farming and grazing in New Zealand is not to be de-
fined as we might rudely define it in England, namely
as the production of food and Clothing by means of
Plough and Fleece —we must add a word or two to the
definition, and say it is the production of food and
clothing, and, “the creation of an estate,” by means
of Plough and Fleece.
Most people, also, who go to New Zealand to en-
gage in agricultural and grazing pursuits, purchase
wild land. In Canada and the States there are
Settlers who make it almost a business to prepare
land of this sort for the new comer. They buy a
lot, put up a log cottage, roughly clear a few acres,
sell the land and their work on it for a hundred
dollars more than the cost, and then move further
back in the wilderness to repeat the operation. But
there is nothing of this sort in New Zealand. Cer-
tainly, now and then, some cause or other may bring a
a cleared or half-cleared little estate into the market;
but the price generally runs high, and the new comer
finds it best to buy his land in the wild state, at
first cost from the Government, and to subdue it
himself, as others have done before him.
Increasing Yalue of Land.— ln considering the
question, too, of the general suitability of a country like
New Zealand for profitable farming and grazing, the
increasing value of land is an item as much to be taken
into account as the low first cost of land. A farm
in England may ' be defined as a high-rented manu-
factory for the production of food, where when the
tenant has paid all the year’s outgoings (rent, tithe,
rates, taxes, labour) and received all the year’s incomings
from crop and stock, the difference between the two
shows his annual profit or loss, and the year’s account
is complete : Farmer has farmed the farm, Landlord
farmed the Farmer, and be the result of the operation
what it may, the ycar’sjiccount is closed and there is no
more to be said.
But in farming and grazing in New Zealand, where
every man owns the land he is on, when the annual
balance between outgoings and incomings has been
struck the year’s account is not complete —there re-
mains a further and a distinct item of profit to bo put
down among the incomings, and that is the increased
market value of the estate.


If, in 1863, an English tenant manages to buy the
farm he rents, and if in 1870 he or his family want to
sell it again, he may get a little more or a little less than
he gave for it, say a little more —but, in practice, we
know that not one tenant in ten thousand is ever able
to buy his farm, so that the little septennial rise or fall
in the value of freehold land in England is, to him, a
mere matter of moonshine. But the man engaged in
farming and grazing pursuits in New Zealand ’ can and
does buy the land he tills, and in all probability if in
1863 he bought 500 or 1000 acres of wild land at £1
per acre, he might sell it in 1870 for one, if not for two,
pounds per acre more than he gave for it.
The reader must remember that in all popular young
emigration fields there is an annually-increasing rise in
the value of the fee simple of land arising from the
constant incoming and operation of fresh capital and
labour. Hundreds, we might say thousands, of new
comers are arriving in New Zealand every year, most
of whom, sooner or later, get to work on the wild
lands lying around the little Settlements already planted,
where they fell the forest, plough up valley and plain,
create gardens, orchards, pastures, corn fields, extend
roads, villages, and markets, and help to reduce the sur-
rounding wilderness to a civilized and cultivatedeountry.
In this way, 100 or 500 or 1000 acres of wild, back, land
bought to-morrow, say, at 15s. an acre, land lying miles
away from civilization, might in 1865 be on the edge of
a settled district, and in 1870 be in the very centre of a
township within a mile or two of some river-port; and
thus, from its improved position and neighbourhood, be
worth, in the market, full double what it had originally
cost.
Of course, the continuance of this steady rise in the
value of land in New Zealand depends mainly on the
continuance of New Zealand’s popularity as a British
emigration field. If any great national windfall were
to enable the 30 millions of people crowded up in these
little British isles to dispense with emigration; or if any
new country were discovered as superior to New Zealand
as New Zealand is to some other countries, the rapid
rise in the value of land in this Colony would cease.
But these are contingencies which we may dismiss from
our calculation: it would bo easy to show that in all
human probability there will be a greater emigration
from the United Kingdom and Europe during the next


quarter of a century than there has been during the
past; while, as to new countries, the geography of the
world is known, and the discoverers of the sources of
the Nile will never discover a country superior to New
Zealand. Indeed, looking at the certainty of a con-
tinuance, if not an increase, of emigration from Great
Britain and Europe,* looking at the waning popularity of
America as a high-class emigration field,t looking at the
possibility of a great door being opened into Australasia
at Panama, we may safely conclude that there will he an
increased rather than a diminished flow of capital and
labour to the Antipodes ; and that, judging by the ex-
perience of the past, we might say that the future _ in-
crease in the value of the soil in New Zealand is a
thing so certain, that the farming and grazing proprietor
of land purchased at £1 per acre would be warranted,
for some years to come, when making out his annual
balance sheet, in adding to the credit side of the farm
account 15 or 20 per cent, profit on the first cost of
his land.
Climate. —As a poor soil hut not a had climate may
be changed by art, a good climate rather than a rich soil
is the most precious gift which Agriculture can receive
from Nature, and in possession of this great gift, this
sheet-anchor of farming and grazing, New Zealand,
probably, deserves to rank as the finest country in the
world. Recollecting that the North is the hottest
quarter, that the seasons are reversed, and that January
is the chief harvest month, a good general idea of the
climate may be formed by imagining it to he the
climate of England with about half the cold of the
English winter, but with an atmosphere more breezy,
rarifled, and pure. The rain-fall is greater than in
* The only seemingly possible event which would materially interfere
with Emigration would be a war with America. The still great, still
braggart, Republic, undertaking another crusade against Liberty, may, ere
long, wax mad enough to force us into a war of defence of Canada; when
a score or two of Northern Alabamas would make sea travelling so dan-
gerous that there would be no sea travellers. But a war with America
would not probably last more than a couple of years, and on its cessation
the impeded stream of Emigration would flow forth in redoubled volume.
f Celtic peasant and Irish hodman, much of the rascality of Britain,
much of the scum of Europe, will ever be drawn to America—but her
civil war, and the knowledge mankind has gained that, under the
Stars and Stripes, civil war may periodically happen, will, I think,
gradually shut out America as an emigration field for the higher classes
of English, Scotch, and German emigrants—especially, too, as our much
finer Australasian emigration fields are every year becoming nearer and
prore attractive.


England, but there are more fine bright sunny days;
and owing to the combined operation of the constant
breeze, the porous subsoil, and the hilly, undulating
character of most of the country, drained as it is by
countless brooks and streams, the effects of the heaviest
rains soon disappear. There is neither Tropical rainy
season nor Australian drought; and though the dura-
tion of periods without rain is perhaps longer than in
England, any climatal disadvantage in this respect is
more than balanced by the greater certainty in New
Zealand of two dry and brilliant months for harvest
weather.*
All vegetation, too, is evergreen. Forests, wild
shrubberies of small bush, grassed plains, are alike
clothed with verdure, winter and summer autumn and
spring ; and the effects of such a climate with such a
vegetation are these: —that the operations of reclaim-
ing and cultivating land can be carried on almost
equally well at all seasons of the year —that when the
first conditions of successful cultivation are complied
with, all our English grain root and fruit crops are fine
in quality and heavy in yield—that comparatively little
winter provision is necessary for stock,t —and that all
our domestic animals multiply fast, are free from many
of their European diseases, mature early, and present to
* I would not, however, have the reader imagine for a moment'that it
is all sunshine and serenity in New Zealand. The climate has its defects,
or what, to human ken, seem defects. Like a beautiful Shrew, it charms
and then exasperates, and then charms again to exasperate afresh. In
all seasons of the year you have days and days of glorious weather worthy
of the Garden of Eden, and then the climate seems to go mad for a while
and to run a sort of meteorological muck against man and beast. The
demons of the storm break loose, and you get Southerly Burster, batteries
of rain, squalls of the first fury, days worthy of the nether regions.
You resolve to denounce the climate to the world and die—but then comes
bursting in a bright renewal of weather so glorious as instantly to allay
your rage, to banish all thoughts of revenge, and to lap you in roses
again. Colonists assert that these “climatic fits” are climatic tonics,
that they make a pure air more pure by blowing malaria and miasma
innocuous away over the South Pacific; and certainly, judging by the
robust health enjoyed in New Zealand, by the prodigious quantity of
children, the rosy robust appearance of these little men and women,
and the high condition of all domestic stock, it must be admitted that
either because of these climatic fits or in spite of them, the climate is
one of super-excellence.
f Cattle, browsing on the teeming undergrowth of the forests and
picking up the coarse grassy shrubs found about the edges of the Bush
will maintain themselves, in the North Island at least, in good con-
dition throughout the year without a bite of what an English grazier
would call grass; while, even in the colder plains of the Southern
Provinces, the delicate Merino, fat and fleecy as he grows, gets nothing
but what he finds in the wild herbage of the Hun. The English agricul


the eye of the connoisseur that clean, sleek, glossy ap-
pearance of coat and skin seldom seen except among
our primest stock at home.
Surface Character of the Country. —There is,
I think, no territory in either hemisphere of the same
size as New Zealand where the “surface character” of
the country is more diversified. The area of the colony
is nearly seventy millions of acres, and, judging from
my own travels in both islands, I should conjecture
that one-fourth of this may consist of dense, primeval
forest tracts, half of them consisting of level or un-
dulating districts of the best New Zealand soil, and
the remainder of rugged mountain ranges, and waste
Alpine regions exhibiting snow-clad peaks eight and
ten and thirteen thousand feet high. Some of the
finest districts in the North Island remind one a little
of Devonshire, as Devonshire may have been when
Caesar dealt battle to the Britons at Deal, and both in
the North and the South Island there is a large and
magnificent area of “ open country ” exhibiting many
a dell and valley, vale and plain—but, to mark the
agricultural characteristics of the surface-formation of
the two islands, I should call the North Island the
Island of Galleys, the South the Island of Plains.
Almost all our agricultural, and of course all our pastoral,
operations are carried on in the “opencountry ” ;* and
as there are probably forty millions of this more or less
suitable for plough and fleece, hoof and horn, it is not
probable that, for the purposes of cultivation, the great
forest districts of the Colony will be much disturbed by
the present generation of men.
Water and Water Power. —Next to climate, the
most remarkable natural feature of New Zealand is the
abundance, the seeming superabundance, of ever-running
water, generally of the purest, softest quality. Perhaps
turist would at once be struck with the great natural advantages of a
climate where this is done, and where but little winter provision has to
be made for stock; but to realize the full force of this advantage, it
is perhaps necessary to have observed the farming in our North Ameri-
can Colonies and the States.
* I include in this term all tracts and districts which are not true or
dense forest districts. Except on the great plain of Canterbury, most of
the “ open country ” is studded with bits of forest and tracts of bush ;
but this, so far from militating against the right of such land to be called
•‘open country,” fit for the farmer and grazier, of course makes it all
the more suitable for plough and fleece, inasmuch as the intersperse
woods give shade, shelter, fuel, fencing stuff, and building timber.


96 WATER, WATER-TOWER.- —SOILS AND THEIR VARIETIES.
wc can hardly have too much of a good thing like good
water, hut certainly in these early days it seems as it
half the streams which New Zealand possesses would be
better for her than the whole.* Nevertheless, my
English agricultural readers, and assuredly our parched-
up pastoral friends in South Africa and Australia, will
instantly agree that too many streams are better than
too few. We may say, too, that not only are the thou-
sand and one streams of New Zealand great gifts lor her
flocks and herds, useful land boundaries, and nne addi-
tions to her beautiful scenery, but that they would
probably supply water-power enough to drive halt the
machinery in the world. In these rude days, the JNew
Zealand cultivator no more_ dreams of making use of
the water-power wasted at his feet than of getting the
plough to work before 10 a.m. —but, though irrigation
may never be practised in New Zealand, the day will
surely come when the agricultural and cheap food-produc-
ing capabilities of the Colony will be sensibly increased
by some use being made of her present waste wealth ot
waters.
Soils and their Varieties.— Contrary to popular
opinion, I do not hold the New Zealand soil to be a very
rich soil. The land is land of fair medium fertility,
but nothing more; land not half so rich as some 1
have seen in Canada and America; and the fertility
and semi-tropical luxuriance of vegetation in New
Zealand undoubtedly arises far more from pre-eminent
“goodness of climate” than from pre-eminent rich-
ness of soil.” Indeed, if any proof were wanted that it
is the climate rather than the soil which is rich, it would
be found in the effects produced by a little manure. In
manv of the rich virgin districts of America and Canada
the soil is so rich that it cannot be made richer, and
manure is useless. But in New Zealand, a little manure,
a night’s folding of sheep, produces results almost to be
called magical. Three hundred weight of guano per
acre have been sown with turnip seed on one side of a
field and the crop has been nearly 50 tons per acre
* Soon after our arrival in the colony. my brother and
looking about for land, joined an expedition which wm to drive
sheen and cattle overland along the coast from Wellington to iara-
nakn In this distance of 250 miles, counting brook, stream, river and
rivulet we had to cross some 70 distinct running waters, while in
Canterbury. Nelson, and Otago, especially in the former, the folding ot
the ever-recurring rivers is attended with great inconvenience and some-
times with danger.


SOILS : THEIE EASY WORKING CHARACTER. 9?
the crop on the other side, without guano, has scarce been
20 tons per acre ; and it is perhaps not far from the truth
to say that the effects of manure are twice as great in
New Zealand as in England.
In a country of supposed volcanic origin, nearly as
large as Great Britain and Ireland, there is of course a
variety of soils. Either, however, the intrinsic differ-
ence between soils is less than in England, or the strong
over-riding influence of the climate, New Zealand’s
elemental guano, operating on all soils alike, makes
difference of soil, as shown by crop and stock, less
apparent than it is at-home. In Auckland, "Wellington,
and Nelson, I have seen poor scrubby-looking lands,
such as an English farmer might grudge to plough, pro-
duce crops almost as heavy as those obtained on the
light loams of Taranaki. Some of the finest field
pastures are found on lands which, seen in the wild
state, would have suggested productive powers equal to
the grazing of one sheep an acre rather than of five ;
while on a large portion of the great plain of Canter-
bury, so famed for mutton and wool, it may be said
that there is no soil, or rather that the surface soil is
shingle, and a good deal of the subsoil, too.
Some Arthur Young, surveying the agriculture of our
New Zealand counties in the year 2000 may define a dozen
varieties of soil; but in these days, or rather in this
paper, it may suffice to say that in New Zealand we re-
cognize three chief soils: —
1. The warm, light, shallow, volcanic soils, distributed
largely over the splendid province of Auckland.
2. The light vegetable loams prevailing in the Tara-
naki province, but found also in Hawke’s Bay, Otago,
Auckland, and, more or less, in all the provinces.
3. The clays, more light than heavy, found in both
islands but not generally in any over proportionate
plenty.
Easy Working Character oe the Soil.— Though,
however, the soil is not so fertile as the climate is fine,
it possesses one property which in the eye of the prac-
tical farmer would do much to compensate for the ab-
sence of any extraordinary richness, namely, that of
being very readily worked. Owing partly to the
climate, partly to general light character of the soil,
there is probably no country in the world where, when
the land has once been broken up, the operations of
ploughing and tilling can be performed with more ease,
certainty, and despatch, in all seasons of the year.


Wild Lands, and Modes and Cost of Cleahing.
The farmed and grazed lands of New Zealand consist of
three chief sorts, namely, Fern Land, Grass Land, and
Forest Land.
Pure fern land is covered with a dense luxuriant
growth of the Pteris esculenta fern, four and six feet
high,* dotted with a bushy shrub called Tutu, a small
palm-like tree called Ti tree, and a .handsome, reedy,
grass-like shrub called Toetoe, and is best cleared in
this way;—choosing a dry gentle-breezy day, in any
month, the fern is fired to windward, when the fire,
creeping slowly through, shrivels up the shrubs, and
consumes the tops and branches of the live fern, together
with all dead bottom stuff. The charred fern stalks are
then swept down with a stub-scythe, raked in ridges,
and burnt; and the tutu and other stumps grubbed up,
thrown in heaps, and burnt or carted off. The land is
then broken up six and seven inches deep, with a strong
iron plough (wrought-iron share) drawn by two or three
pairs of oxen. After lying a week or two to dry and
pulverize, it is harrowed, and the fem root is then
raked up, heaped, and burnt. A light cross-ploughing
is then given, when the soil after lying in a kind of
maiden fallow for three or four months f will be re-
duced to a fine tilth, fit for crop. The expense of this
process varies from £2 to £3 and £4 per acre, according
to the heaviness of the fern and tutu.
Grass Land, more abundant in the South Island than
in the North, consists of coarse grasses, here and there
intermingled with scrubby fern, ffax, dwarf tutu, toetoe,
and ti-tree. Where these intermingled shrubs grow
strong and thick, they are swept down with bill-hook
or brushing-bill and burnt off; but the lighter, more
open lands of this description may be broken-up and
cross-ploughed at once, lie fallow a month or two, and
then receive the crop. The cost of reducing Grass Land
to seed state may vary from 20s. to 40s. an acre.
* In the Taranaki Province, on the richer soil oftenfound at the edge*
of the bush, I have, by measurement, found this common English plant
attaining a height of even 12 and 14 feet; and, in this Province, the sur-
veyors would frequently use fern stalks as wands for what is called
“boning” (marking) their lines.
+ Fresh fern land is at first inferti.e through “sourness.” An acre
broken up and sown at once with wheat or any crop might not yield
five-fold—an adjoining acre fallowed a few months might yield forty-fold.
Animal manure is of no use for sourness. The soil is full of raw un-
decomposed vegetable matter, and lime would prove the true quickener.
Crass land is less affected by “ sourness,” and Bush land scarcely at all,


Bush Land is the common forest land. Before the
spring- month of September, the brushwood should be
slashed down with the bill-hook, and all the trees, not
exceeding 3 feet or so in diameter,* thrown by the
American axe and cross-cut saw. The fallen stuff lies
withering and drying through the summer, and is
burnt off in autumn. If the first, or running, fire acts
well, everything will be consumed save trunks and
heavy branches, when the latter are lopped off, the
trunks rolled together, and the whole slowly burnt up
in heaps. The cost of clearing and burning off bush
land, so that grass seed or wheat may be sown on the
ashes, varies from £3 to £5 per acre. The ugly stumps
remain in the land about four years, when the smaller
ones may be torn out with a pair of good bullocks and
a strong stump chain, and the lighter lands of this
description made roughly ploughable.
Bush Land is richer soil than either Fern or Grass
Land; and for small Dairy and Garden farms, where
there is family hand labour at command, or for hop
grounds, orchards, kitchen gardens, or home paddocks,
ush land is best; while looking at its value for timber
fencing stuff and fuel, at the shade and shelter it affords,
at the increased beauty it gives the scenery, every one
in buying a lot of land likes to have a portion of it, say
a fourth or a fifth, Bush land. But the process of first
clearing and cultivating it is, comparatively, so slow,
and laborious, that nine-tenths of all our agricultural
operations are, as yet, carried on on Fern and Grass land.
Drainage. —Here and there, as on the rich low-
lying seaboard of the Canterbury Plains, and in the
little manure-bed Kaupo Swamps and alluvial bottoms
found in most districts, the agricultural lands of New
Zealand are improvable by drainage; but, speaking
generally, they may be called lands where, owing to the
combined operation of porous subsoil, sunny, breezy
atmosphere, hilly undulating surface, and countless
brooks and streams, the drainage is so good by nature
as to need little improvement from art.
* The few larger fellows, those more of the Trafalgar-square column size,
are let alone: the fire, and then the want of shade and shelter kills them,
when, gradually becoming blanched by the weather, they stand up in Bush
clearings like huge Forest Ghosts. What with work, what with sport, in
America, Canada, the Cape Colony, Australia, and New Zealand, I have
toiled pretty hard at several things, and should say that for bringing out
the muscle, and arousing the combative, do or die, spirit of the Anglo-
Saxon, nothing better could be devised than to give him an axe and a
barrel of beer and to set him down before ten or twenty acres of gcod
§olid New Zealand forest.

Labour. —Implements.—Machinery. —The present
rate of farm labour is about 6s. a-day—but assum-
ing, as we may, that by “assisted passages” and
“ free grants ” New Zealand wisely continues to attract
population to her shores, and that no large portion of
her labour force be absorbed by permanent gold fields,
I incline to think, taking an average of the next ten
years, that the price of farm labour will not be found
to exceed 55., and may possibly be as low as 4s. a-day.
This, even, is double the English price; but, in over-
balancing per contra, the New Zealand cultivator has
no penny of rent, rate, tax, or tithe to pay. Again,
operating as he is on fresh virgin land where seed
soil and climate, alone, almost produce the crop,
the additional stimulant of Labour proves so powerful
a stimulant that the effect of two labourers on a New
Zealand farm is probably as great as that of three on
an English farm, where their labour is expended on
a long-used, dry-squeezed, partially-exhausted soil.
Nevertheless, this higher price of labour, compara-
tively little as in actual practice it may be felt, is
strong additional reason why New Zealand cultivators
should arm themselves with the best labour-saving tools
and implements, and the best of the simpler forms of
our agricultural machinery. In these respects there
has of late been a great improvement in New Zea-
land, and one which I flatter myself that I, mouse
aiding lion, have helped a little to bring about.
Thrashing machine, reaping machine, Eansome har-
row, Crosskill crusher, Howard, plough, Scotch cart,
Suffolk drill, are gradually driving out nondescript im-
plements fit for the “good husbandrie” days of old
Tusser. Bad tools and implements are still, however,
more common than good ones; and the capitalist or
small capitalist family now going to New Zealand to
create a little estate by farming and grazing would still
do well to provide themselves with a few of the simplest
and most useful of the things described in my work on
New Zealand; things which, together with the tools
named there at page 181, and colonial ironmongery
generally, it may be useful to some of my readers to
say, I have always obtained good and genuine, and at
satisfactory prices, from llichards and Co., 117 and 118,
Bishopsgate Street, London, who on application will for-
ward their prized list.
Eences. —Near forest, the cheapest fence is the split


post and rail; but the commonest fence is the 6 ft. ditch
and 3 ft. hank, or a smaller ditch and bank with light post
and rail, and sometimes furze at top. Furze is a, nasty
straggling thing; but it grows Avith great quickness,
and iu these rude days is found useful in the open coun-
try both as fence and breakwiud. Quick also groAVSAyell in
some of the provinces, but it is subject to blight, and is not
so commonly used as the more humble furze. For home-
field fences, the wild rose broom geranium and two
or three of the native plants are sometimes mixed with
furze, and form fences of great beauty, impervious to
man or beast. In the North Island, hoAvever, perhaps
the best live fence will eventually be formed by that
quick-growing vegetable bulwark the Osage orange :
the plant has been introduced into some of the New
Zealand nurseries, and, after many inquiries, I find
that the seed maybe had at Carter’s, 238, Holborn.*
The cost of fencing varies considerably, according to
the nearness of timber, and the easy digging character of
the soil. I have known it done for 12s. a chain ; hut
perhaps the present average cost of the larger ditch and
bank would be about 155., and of the smaller, Avith light
post and rail at top, about 20s. a chain—the expense of
parti-fencing being borne by the two
Buildings. —As yet, there are not many mansions in
Ncav Zealand. Here and there, on the estates of Colo-
nists of ten and twelve years’ standing;, a handsome
house and homestead with all things fitting Avill be
found; but, at first, small capitalist families, going on
land, Avisely content themselves Avith putting up a
dwelling of some temporary, make-shift character—gene-
rally a building of the rough verandah-cottage order
in which they may enjoy robust health and much comfort
until a good part of the little estate is cleared and
fenced cropped and stocked, and they have earned the
right of treating themselves to a residence more com-
mensurate with their annually-improving circum-
stances and their independent landed-proprietor posi-
tion. A substantial wooden verandah cottage of this
order may cost from £l5O to £2OO ; a good raupo coh or
clay building, from £SO to £7O; but these smaller, more
humble erections are frequently put up wholly or in
part by the Settlers themselves, Avhen their cost in paid-
aAvay cash is next to nothing, for there is little or no
labour to pay for, and the materials lie free at hand.
* Stout galvanized wire fencing is, here and there, corning into econo-
mical use.


Any family going l on land, too, would do well to add to
their outfit a small box of carpenter’s tools—not the flimsy
gimeracks glittering in what are called “Emigrant’s Tool
Chests,” but such strong useful things as are named in
the work just alluded to. I took lessons in the noble art of
Carpentry for half a year before I went to New Zealand,
and can assure the reader that a few good tools, and the
rough ability to use them, which Paterfamilias and
the boys soon pick up, will be found singularly useful
in the many little jobs of building and construction
which have to be done in the work of converting a lot
of New Zealand wild land into a New Zealand farm.
Eoads.— Proximity op Markets. —Within a radius
of ten and fifteen miles of the nine provincial capitals,
the main roads of _ the Colony are now pretty good;
but as we advance inland the roads are still often little
more than rough tracks, studded, in wet weather, with
many a mud-pit and slough of despond; and, generally,
we might say that the tractive power which would draw
two tons on a road at home would not draw more than
one in New Zealand.
Owing, however, to the peculiar, lengthy, configuration
of the country, giving it a coast line of 4000 miles with
a breadth varying only from 50 to 200 ; owing to the
excellent system on which a large portion of the culti-
vable land has been surveyed and laid out, and to the
number of shipping places found in almost every dis-
trict, agricultural and pastoral produce requires com-
paratively little cartage in New Zealand to convey it to
some port or inland creek or river-planted market—so
we may say that if the roads are bad they arc not
both bad and long.
Grain, Root, and Pudse Chops.— Wheat. For
certainty of crop, so far as certainty of crop may arise
through rarity of blight and climatic injuries, for good
harvest-got condition of crop, and for fair average yield,
New Zealand will some day rank high among the wheat-
growing countries of the world; but for super-excellent
quality of grain I should not place her quite so high
as is generally done. I have certainly handled finer
samples of New Zealand than of English-grown
wheat; but none, I think, so fine as some of the mag-
nificent specimens sent to the late Exhibition by
Canada, Tasmania, and South Australia ; and, agricul-
turally, I should call New Zealand less pre-eminent as
a corn country than as a grass and root country.


Wheat is best sown in May or June, the months an-
sweringl to our English November and December, at the
rate of two bushels an acre. It is generally sown
broadcast, but drilling would be a great improvement.
Six and seven quarters per acre are occasionally obtained,
and if common fair farming were practised the soil and
climate would, I think, be found quite equal to the gene-
ral production of four ; but the present average yield of
the wheat crop of New Zealand cannot certainly be esti-
mated at more than three_ quarters per acre —a yield
though, obtained where tillage of soil, application ot
manure, rotation of crops, are conditions of good hus-
bandry very generally neglected, and where, indeed, the
cultivator appears for the most part to labour under the
impression that when he has broken up the land and
harrowed in the seed his work is done.
Barley akd Oats, though liable on new lands to be
attacked by a ravaging caterpillar, sadly needing the
attentions of the English finch and sparrow, are grown
with considerable success. Fine samples of Chevalier
barley are now sometimes seen in the markets, and
I have myself grown .the Lincolnshire Poland Oat
weighing the extraordinary weight of nearly 50 lbs. the
imperial bushel. I may here remark, too, that as fre-
quent change of seed is good practiee_ in New Zealand,
any one going out to engage in agricultural pursuits
would do well to procure among his farming friends
peck or bushel samples of any particularly fine wheat,
oats, barley, or grass seeds, for which their localities
might be famous. All seeds should be put up (dry) in
bags, and then be enclosed in some zinc-lined ease or
cask.
Pulse Crops. —These, as yet, have been but little
grown. Judging, however, by their luxuriance in the
garden, there is no doubt that when an improved sys-
tem of agriculture calls for a greater variety and alter-
nation of crop, peas and beans will bo grown as success-
fully as other crops.
Root Crops. —Potatoes, next to wheat, have hitherto
been the most common crop in New Zealand. They
are generally set in the North Island in September;
but the Canterbury and Otago agriculturists prefer
planting a month later. The quality of potatoes is
excellent, and the crop is a certain one. On common


lands, without manure, 5 and 6 tons per acre is a fair
yield; hut I remember that on the rich hush soil of a
portion of my brother’s little farm in Taranaki 12 and
14 tons per acre were occasionally obtained.
Turnips, Carrots, Parsnips, Onions, and all root
and vegetable crops, are very prolific, and of the finest
quality. From 25 to 30 tons per acre of turnips is
not an uncommon yield. Incredible as it may seem,
nearly 40- cwt. of the white Altringham carrot, nearly
150 tons per acre,* have been obtained from two rods of
ground; 300 lbs. of onions, nearly 25 tons per acre, have
been obtained from one rod of ground ; carrots of 9 lbs.
weight have been exhibited at Canterbury Horticultural
Shows, and cabbages weighing 50 lbs. have been grown
in Otago.
Hops. —A few acres of hops have been grown, and
have _ answered well, particularly at Nelson. The
sorts introduced, however, have often been of inferior
quality; and any agricultural emigrant from our hop
counties would do Avell to carry with him cuttings of
the finest varieties of his district. Brewing is almost
certain to grow into a considerable business and to
create a large and profitable demand for hops.
Grass Crops_ and Pastures. —As before observed,
New Zealand is perhaps even a finer country for
grass than for grain. Assuming, as we safely may,
that the rate of increase in grass crops and pastures in
the three years from 1858 to 1861 has been maintained
up to the present time, the farm grass lands of the
Colony will have spread from 160,000 acres in 1861 to
200,000 acres in 1863.
A smaU portion of this large and largely-increasing
area consists of meadow land mown for hay, for
although dry winter food is not necessary for stock a
little good hay is relished by cattle and horses, and hay
is now being required for livery and stable purposes in
the towns. Nine-tenths, however, of these grass lands
are lands which have been sown with clovers and arti-
* They were grown by a Devonshire Settler named Lethbridge, then
a sawyer, now a flourishing grazier and butcher in New Plymouth, on
a piece of heavy timber land which had been cleared by the sawyers,
and where he had broken up half an acre for vegetables. I did not
see them weighed, but I saw them before they were taken up : the
plot of ground seemed one mass of carrots—in size, the roots were more
like mangel wurtzel than what they were, and from the known re-
spectability and truthfulness of the man I have no doubt that the
yield was what he stated it to be.


ficial grasses for permanent farm pastures; and the
best and cheapest mode of laying down lands to grass,
and the “ feeding powers ” of such lands, are questions
which have an important hearing on the Agricultural
and Pastoral Industries of New Zealand, and which,
among Colonists, have very properly excited some dis-
cussion—inasmuch as it is commonly asserted that there
are ten millions of acres in the country which in the
wild state and under the Squatting System will not, at
the best, graze more than as many sheep; while that
these acres, at an average expense of from £2 to £3 per
acre, could be laid down in permanent pasture and made
capable of grazing five times as large a flock.
I believe we are all agreed that the grazing lands of
the Colony, in their wild state, will not carry more than
a sheep an acre, if that, and this general opinion is
strongly confirmed by the following observations on the
subject from Mr. Weld.*
“ I have now briefly touched upon certain points more or loss
referable to climate —namely, the constant supply of water and
food, its effects on condition and growth of wool, and on the
general health of the animal; but I must not omit here to allude
to the physical characteristics of the pastoral parts of New Zea-
land. No one can have traversed the undulating downs and
grassy plains so characteristic of the Middle Island, or the rich
open valleys that invite the grazier in many parts of the North
Island, without being struck with their peculiar fitness for stock-
farming, and in many cases for that only. The Northern Island
in its natural state appears to me chiefly adapted for cattle,
whilst the Middle offers, in its open, undulating, or broken tracts
of country, inexhaustible pasturage, combined with that shelter
from wind and weather, and dryness of soil, so essential to the
welfare of that class of animals to which the sheep belongs.
“ Nearly the whole of the south and east coast of that island,
with the exception of the great block of the Kaikora mountains,
is one vast tract of pastoral country, well watered, and much of
it comparatively easy of access. A deficiency of wood is indeed
a drawback to this, the most extensive grazing district in New
Zealand. Standing on any summit of the offspurs of the Kai-
koras, or of the inland range that runs down the centre of the
island, the eye wanders over an apparently interminable waste
of grass land, sometimes level, sometimes heaving in wavy outline

Castle.


like a sea, whilst here and there it is attracted by the gleam of
rivers and streamlets, or landward rests on the peaks of snow that
look down on the wide prairie. Ido not mean to say that the
whole of this vast expanse of country is equally good, or that, on a
nearer inspection, it would always be inviting to the eye of the
English agriculturist, accustomed to the rich green and luxuriant
herbage of his highly-cultivated fields. The yellow seed-stems
and dry-looking tufts of rough grass might at first discourage
him, but he would be reassured, on a more attentive examina-
tion, by the abundance of mountain herbs and fine grasses which
he would discover. Moreover, the natural pasture is at first
always thinly spread over the ground; but it often loses its tufty
character on being fed down and manured by stock.
“Again, much of the unoccupied grass country, especially in
the Northern Island, is rough with flax, fern, and bushes ;
and in other parts, where the hills and downs begin to assume
the character of mountains, the wild and desolate nature of the
country would almost remind you of the dictum of Dr. Buck-
land, who pronounced New Zealand to have been colonized a
thousand years too soon. *
“ From this sketch it will be easily understood how difficult it
is to state with any accuracy the number of sheep that a given
quantity of land will support when in its natural state ; but,
judging from the occupied parts of the country, I should say, on
an average of available districts, not more than one sheep to
three acres of wild land, including in the area (as is done in
the estimate given for a licence) a proportion of bush, clift,
shingle, bed of river, and other utterly valueless country; ex-
cluding this, 1 should say that ordinary-runs will keep a sheep
to every two acres, tohilst I know some country that will keep a
sheep to the acre. It must be borne in mind, that in speaking
of the average quantity of land requisite to maintain a sheep,
I here merely allude to wild and unimproved pasture, much
ground too is wasted in keeping flocks apart, which would be-
come available by the use of fences. In no country do artificial
grasses thrive and flourish more luxuriantly than in New Zea-
land, and by their cultivation, and by fencing, and in some
cases by draining, the capabilities of a given area of good land
to maintain stock might be increased TENFOLD. With greater
abundance of capital and labour, and considering the increasing
value of land, I have no doubt that the system of laying down

wild lands in grass will year ly year le more extensively and
profitably acted on."
Colonists, too, arc, I think, pretty well agreed as to the
“feeding powers” of the New Zealand farm grass lands.
On our old family property in Lincolnshire we had pas-
tures which, in spring and early summer, would graze and
fatten ten heavy sheep an acre ; and, incredible as it
may seem to the English grazier, there are some lands
in New Zealand which will graze almost as many sheep
as this through the year.* Lands like these, however,
he they few or many, we will put aside, and content
ourselves with saying that there are some millions of
acres in the Colony which, laid down in paddock-pas-
tures, would carry five sheep per acre through the year.
The only point, indeed, on which there is now any
substantial difference of opinion on this great question ot
Paddocks and Grazing versus Puns and Squatting, is
that of the best mode and the first cost of getting the
Paddocks —here, indeed, doctors still differ; but the
majority of our most practical men would now, I think,
endorse the following propositions
1. The question of the mode and cost of converting
wild, open-country lands into farm pastures turns,
mainly, on the point of whether it he necessary to hreah
up and till the land, or whether the seed may he sown on
the unbroken surface. , .
2. Now, unquestionably, there are portions ot ail
open-country districts where, owing to certain pe-
culiarities of soil surface and indigenous vegetation,
the land must be cleared, ploughed, and worked for
grass seed. But, unquestionably, in almost all open-
country districts there is a breadth of land where,
say after a little slashing-down and burning-off work
and a rough surface-fraying harrowing, grass seeds
may be sown at once and sately left to take possession
of the soil and to turn themselves quickly into pas-
ture, t
* “ There is much of the land in New Zealand which, when cultivated,
grassed, and fenced, will keep eight sheep to the acre all the year round,
and also be proportionately good for cattle.”— Weld.
+ Some of the finest open-country pastures in the Colony have been
obtained in Auckland and elsewhere without any ploughing, while even
the “ bush” land, alluded to in the following extract from a Wellington
Paper, was land where the [seed was merely scattered on the rough, un-
broken surface:
“ Nearly all the wooded hills are well adapted for sheep-feeding when
cleared and sown down with grass. We have friends who now actually
keep from five to six sheep per acre on these mis-termed useless hills. It


3. On the first description of land, where the soil
might have to be regularly cleared, ploughed, and
worked, the expense (including seed and fencing) of con-
verting wild open-land into 50 and 100 acre paddocks
might perhaps he put down, taking one district with
another, at about £3 per acre ;* while on the second
description of land, where burning, harrowing, seed,
and fence would comprise the chief outlay, I should say
that reckoning on some aid from the process named in
the note beloAv,t largo paddock pastures in New Zealand
could now be created from the wild land at an expense
of from 30s. to £2 per acre.
Comparative Acreage of Crops. —Assuming that
the progression has been about the same for the last two
years as it was in the prior three, the following table
shows the present extent and the annual increase of
cultivation in New Zealand; and, in the great pre-
dominance of the grass crop, indicates that it is the
costs about £3 10$. per acre to cut down the small bush and sow grass
seed; and each sheep, in proper condition, will annually yield a fleece
3 lbs. and 4 lbs. in weight, and worth from Is. 4<i. to Is. 6 d. per lb ; there
is, in addition, the increase of say 75 per cent, every year, with Welling-
ton close at hand as a good market for fat mutton and sheep skins. A
labouring man with a very small capital, if of industrious habits, is
pretty sure of realizing a handsome and unfailing income. These use-
less hills may now be had for 10$. an acre. A great deal has been said
about land at 2s. 6 d. per acre, and if this were the place to do so, we
should feel inclined to urge the Government to consider whether it would
not bo advisable to open for sale all the lands between Porirua Harbour
and the west side of the Hutt Valley, in sections varying from 100 to 1000
acres, at 2s. 6d. per acre, with the proviso that the purchaser should, within
five years from the day of purchase, lay down m grass one-half of the
land so purchased. We believe that if this were done some 20,000 acres
might, within the next fifteen years be laid down in grass, carrying,
at the lowest calculation, 100,000 sheep, and annually yielding 300,000
lbs. of woo!.”— Wellington Paper.
4= Under a large wholesale demand and supply, the expense of seed
should not be more than from 18$. to 20$. per acre. The cost of the ditch
and bank fence at 20$. a chain is, of course, £'Bo a mile. In a square mile
there are 640 acres, and this, divided into six great paddocks, would take
six miles of fencing, costing £BO, or 15$. an acre. But, as a portion of the
expense of the external fence would sometimes be borne by the adjoining
proprietor, we may say that the expense of fencing would probably not
be more than from 10$. to 12$. an acre.
f Sheep and cattle having access to any good bit of farm pasture fre-
quently carry the seed over the surrounding wild land, and by treading
and trampling about, manage, in time, to effect a very fair sowing of grass
seed. In New Plymouth, mainly by this process, tracts of wild land,
road sides, banks and ditches, soon became clothed with a splendid growth
of white clover and other grasses; and very generally, 1 think, if in laying
down 1000 acres of wild land the proprietor sowed two-thirds, the stock
would gradully sow the rest.

Sheep. —ln natural advantages constituting a perfect
habitat for the Sheep, there is perhaps no country in
either hemisphere superior to New Zealand. The sur-
face, for the most part, is hilly or undulating; the soil
is light, percolative, and freely impregnated with all
congenial oxides, sulphates, and phosphates; the climate
is the happy mean of temperature and moisture ; no de-
structive animal exists ; * and there is perpetual natural
pasturage with a profusion of the finest water —a rare
combination of natural gifts, creating marked exemp-
tion from disease,f great prolificness, fat and early mut-
ton, fine wool, and heavy fieece.
In the three years from 1858 to 1861 our New Zealand
flock increased from 1,500,000 to 2,700,000, and must now
amount to three millions and a half—a flock, at its
present rate of increase, doubling itself about every
four years, and at present subsisting almost wholly on
the wild pasturage of the Colony, grazed on the rude
squatting system. Nine-tenths of the present flock are
the progeny of the imported Australian merino, im-
proved and enlarged by the finer feed and climate, and
by the introduction of a few thoroughbred merino rams
from Saxony and elsewhere.
The existing New Zealand merino maybe described as
an animal weighing about 15 lbs. per quarter, and clip-
ping 34 and 4 lbs. fleeces of rvool, at once fine and long.
But when improved breeding is more generally attended

f Except scab, that terror of the New Zealand Flockrnasters. Scab,
however, when it decimates a New Zealand flock does so not because of
any peculiar virulence of diagnosis, but because of the difficulty of
preventing contagion and of nipping it in the bud while flocks are grazed
on the present rude squatting system. When sheep come to be grazed
more as they are at home, scab, probably, will be no more common in
New Zealand than in Norfolk.


to, and when the natural advantages of soil and climate
are turned to full account, the New Zealand merino
may, I think, eventually, be raised into an animal weigh-
ing 18 and 20 lbs. per quarter,* and clipping a 44 and
5 lbs. fleece of the finest combing wool —worth, if cotton
sto lose its rank in the world, 25., nay, even 2s. 6 d., a
pound.
The Merino will probably ever remain Ovine King
of South Britain ; but when grazing, as must soon
be the case, is carried on more on the grass-estate
and less on the squatting system, some heavier-
fleeced, long-woolled, sheep will probably take possession
of our lower-lying, richer pastures. And, speaking as
one of a family who, father and son, have been Lincoln-
shire graziers for 300 years, I should say that of
sheep of this description none would prove more profit-
able than that magnificent animal the improved Lin-
coln, as seen in the Kirkham Flock —an animal which,
on such grass as many districts in New Zealand are cap-
able of producing, would probably attain a weight of from
30 to 35 lbs. per quarter, and yield an annual 8 lbs. fleece
of the finest long wool, often worth for the Hudders-
field and Bradford market, Is. 6d. and Is. 9f/. per lb.
Cattle. —New Zealand, in her natural state, is per-
haps even a more suitable country for Cattle than for
Sheep—inasmuch as while the latter thrive only in the
open grassy country, Cattle, a more browsing stock than
Sheep, will not only thrive there but will also fatten
and multiply in the great Bush Districts of the Colony,
where the wilderness of vegetation would make the
country impenetrable to the weaker, more timid Sheep,
or where the rough shrub-and-leaf feed would be dis-
tasteful to that more dainty, grass-loving animal.
In the three years from 1858 to 1861 the New Zealand
Herd increased from 140,000 to 200,000 head, and must
now amount to nearly a quarter of a million—about
doubling itself, at its present rate of increase, every
five or six years.
Like the Sheep, the New Zealand Cattle are mainly the
progeny of Australian imported animals, improved and
enlarged by soil and climate; but, unlike the Sheep, they
are of no particular breed: short-horns, long-horns, no-
* No doubt, a heavier animal could be produced—but, with wool at
1,9. fid. or 2s. per lb., and mutton, possibly, at 3d., it is wool, not meat
which the New Zealand grazier will want; and in Germany and elsewhere
experience has shown that when the Merino is forced, by feeding, into a
much bigger, heavier-framed animal than he is by nature, his fleece in-
lead of becoming heavier and finer becomes inferior and lighter


horns, are so mixed and blended that Yoxiatt himself
could scarce name the predominant strain.
The New Zealand beef, like the mutton, is prime
butcher’s meat, quite equal, when properly fed
and dressed, to our own, which is the finest in the
world. Four-year wild-grazed bullocks will sometimes
weigh 1000 and 1200 lbs. During my last visit to the
Colony I saw a small herd, fed chiefly in the bush and
wild shrubberies of the Waitera, which would have
produced beef fit for a Christmas show ; while the good -
ness of the pastures is tasted in the richness of the
cream and cheese.
Cattle, far more patient and enduring on our bad
colonial roads and rough surfaces than Horses,working in
far cheaper gear, too, and needing far less care, are much
used in New Zealand for farm and draught purposes.
They are capable, also, of doing the State great service in
breaking through, smoothing down, and improving wild
tangled districts of country at first too rough and vege-
tation-smothered for the feeble Sheep ; and I must con-
fess, though it be heresy to say so, that, looking at the
fine beef he gives us, at his heifer’s rich dairy produce,
at his strength and patience in plough and dray, at his
pioneering services in the bush, I esteem the New Zea-
land Ox quite as much as the Sheep, and protest against
the stuck-up Merino, with his golden coat and descent
from the Earn of Colchis, being allowed, by common
consent and the connivance of Squatters, to make him-
self out so much bigger and better an animal in New
Zealand than his modest neighbour the plodding Bullock.
Hoeses. —The Horse in New Zealand, like the Sheep
and Ox, is mainly the progeny of importations from the
Australian continent; and the Horse, like the Sheep and
Ox, and like every living creature, fr6m cat up to man,
transplanted from Australia to New Zealand, has grown
to be a hiqrjer animal in his island home. The New
Zealand Horse, however, has been vastly improved by
the pretty free introduction of some of the best blood
of the English turf. Many years ago, on the occasion
of my first expedition to New Zealand, a felloAV-passen-
ger (the Hon. Henry Petre) took out two thorougn-breds
for stud purposes, and his example has since been so well
followed by other spirited Colonists that, if the length
of the Epsom course were doubled, there are now New
Zealand Horses which might run a very race for the
Derby.


On the turf, indeed, young New Zealand is quite a
chip of the old block. Well-conducted annual races take
place in most of the chief Settlements; while the Nelson
men, who for Horses may be called New Zealand’s
Yorkshircmen, no longer content to carry off the blue
ribbon at-home, have gone forth to seek fresh victories
in Australia. Three or four years ago, at the Sydney
Home Bush Races (the Epsom of Australia), two
New Zealand mares, Zoe and Zingan, carried off the
honours of the day; and their spirited owner, Mr.
Redwood, of Nelson, who had taken over these spe-
cimens of New Zealand blood to New South Wales (a
voyage of 1200 miles), was entertained at a public din-
ner by the Sydney turfites in honour of the event.
Again, at the last Australian Champion Races, held at
Melbourne, where eighteen horses started for the
“Champion Stakes,” Strop, a Nelson horse, carrying
10 st. 4, came in fourth—the distance, over a rough heavy
course, being 3 miles, the time nearly 6 minutes, and the
value of the stakes nearly £3OOO. For the second event,
however, the “ Melbourne Handicap,” another Nelson
horse, Camden, came in first and won his party several
thousand pounds.
The number of Horses increased from 15,000, in 1858,
to nearly 30,000, in 18G1, and should now amount to full
40,000 —the number, at the present rate of increase,
nearly doubling itself, it seems, every three years.
Pigs.—Of English sty-fed Pigs and native tame-kept
Pigs, the number, altogether, may amount to 100,000.
Wild pigs, too, though the cover is so thick and the
creature so shy that few of them are seen, so abound in
certain remote bush localities as to have led us to
imagine that Neiv Zealand must have been the country
which happy Hood had in his eye when he wrote —
“ There is a land of pure delight,
Where omelets grow on trees,
And roasted pigs come crying out,
‘ Oh, eat me, if you please ! ’ ”
The] animal fattens kindly and produces hams and
flitches equal, I think, to any I ever saw at-home. The
editor of one of the New Zealand papers—turning for a
moment from Brutus and Public Virtue to Pork—has
lately told the world that “ five largo pigs were killed
at Wellington this week, the smallest of which, when
cleaned, weighed nearly a quarter of a tonand goes


on to inform the world that he had once seen a Welling-
ton pig which weighed more than a quarter of a ton.
Prices of Corn and Wool.— On the authority of
the New Zealand “Blue Book” for 1861, the last year,
I am told, for which it has been received in England,
the quantity, market price, and value, of the agricultural
and pastoral produce exported to Australia and Eng-
land from New Zealand in the four years 1858-59-60,
and 61, was as follows :
Quantity. Price. Value.
£ s. d. £.
Wheat ... 120,000 bush. 0 7 0 per bush. 42,000
Oats , 190,000 „ 0 5 0 „ 48,000
Barley ... 20,000 „ 0 6 0 „ 6,000
Potatoes... 16,000 tons.
Wool 24,000,000 lbs.
5 5 0 per ton 84,000
0 1 4 per lb. 1,700,000
These figures, I apprehend, represent the shipping
value of the produce at the port—not the prices ob-
tained by the cultivator from the merchant. These
figures, however, are satisfactory, even so regarded ; and
looking at past experience, at the occasional market in
Sydney and Melbourne for corn and potatoes, and at
the largely - increasing home demand, I think we
may safely say that during the next ten years the
four great arable crops will, on the average, bring
the New Zealand farmer the following prices: ■—
wheat, 65,, barley, 55., oats, 45., and potatoes £i per
ton. Wool comes under quite another category, and
looking at the possible dethronement of King Cotton,
the New Zealand grazier, on the average of the next
ten years, is more likely, I think, to make Is. 6d. oi-
ls. 9 d. per lb. of the golden fleece than Is. 3 d. or Is. 4 d.
Present Prices of Stock, Dairy Produce, &c.
Breeding ewes, except in the three provinces
below, fully per head 20s. to 255.
Breeding ewes in Canterbury, Otago, and
Southland per head 255. t) 30s.
Fat wethers, everywhere per head 255. to 30s.

Hay : good grass or oaten hay, near the

N.B.—Occasionally in Sydney and Melbourne hay is 15 1,

With respect to these prices and the probability of
their continuance I would offer the following remarks :
As to Ewes, bearing in mind the great patent facts
that a large portion of New Zealand could be laid
down in pastures at a comparatively small first
cost that such pastures might sustain 30,000,000
of sheep—that in all human probability there will he
a steady and increasing European demand for wool,
ensuring high prices, stimulating production—and that
the conversion of wild land into pasture, the gradual
abandonment of squatting for grazing, is a change which
has commenced and which will go on spreading just as
surely as seed spreads into plant hearing these
things in mind, we may safely conclude that, for the
next decade, good breeding Ewes in New Zealand will ho
worth full a guinea a-head.
As to Wethers, fat Wethers, there is some difference
of opinion. It may be that with my prodigious ad-
vocacy, with the Panama Route, with Europe’s repudia-
tion of Brother Jonathan, his ballot-box, and everything
American, most of the emigrant world will soon he moved
to go to New Zealand, when legs of mutton there might
fetch a shilling a pound. Or it may he that most of the
emigrant world will not be moved this way, and that when
we get the fat pastures in New Zealand which we shall
have, fat Wethers may multiply so fast there as almost to
crowd out the Men. So grave a matter, however, must
not he treated in this light style ; and, returning to that
befitting frame of mind which the subject demands, I
would say that for many years to come there is every
probability of our haying good meat markets in New


Zealand through and hy the increase and incoming of
population—that more_ unlikely things have happened
to sheep than that prime New Zealand wethers may
some day grace the butchers’ shops of Melbourne and
Sydney—that mutton hams are not bad—that bounti-
ful science may discover means of converting some
of the finest meat in the world, New Zealand mut-
ton, into some preparation of dry preserved meat
which would prove a cheap dainty to the half-starved
millions of Europe—and that if the worst comes to
the worst and we have to boil down,* the New Zealand
wether will be found to be a substantial respectable
animal whose weight of tallow, whose skin and many-
crop fleece, will allow him to “ boil” in peace, in debt
to no man, and to leave the Squatter copiously compen-
sated for his keep.
With respect to Cattle, looking at the great de-
velopment of which dairy farming is capable, at the
great demand which must arise for working oxen as
the plough gets more into work, and at the possibility
of a beef-curing, ship-provision, export trade springing
up, there appears to me to be no reason to suppose that
the above-named prices will, for the next few years,
suffer any very material reduction.
As to Dairy produce, glancing at the increasing popu-
lation of New Zealand, at the large and increasing
tonnage of shipping annually > entering the ports, and at
the occasional market found in the great neighbouring
cities of Melbourne and Sydney, the New Zealand cul-
tivator, or rather his wife and daughters, may, I think,
safely calculate on dairy produce maintaining, on the
average, for some years, nearly the prices standing in the
above quotations.
Modes and Systems of Farming and Grazing.—
As regards arable farming it cannot be said that there
has yet been any particular mode followed in New Zea-
land. In the rude, crude, pioneering days which we have
yet had there, the operations of the plough have been
regulated by no system : —tillage of soil, rotation of
* “ Boiling down ” was formerly practised to a considerable extent in
Australia; the mere fat or tallow of the animal for export to England
being worth far more than the meat for colonial consumption. Boiling
down establishments were formed in the pastoral districts, and the pro-
cess became a regular business. The sheep, especially if showing any
signs of scab or other contagious disease, were killed and skinned, the
carcases thrown into the boiling vat, the fat skimmed off for export
tallow, and the meat thrown away.


crop, golden admixture of farming and grazing, where
crop makes stock and stock makes crop, have been
things almost as much neglected in New Zealand as
Tapper’s Proverbial Philosophy, or _ the Olympic
Games. Labour has been dear, capital scarce, the
country a primeval wilderness, and the New Zealand
farmer, when he has moved on to his wild land, rudely
cleared a few acres, lit his pipe, and scattered the
seed, seems very generally to have imagined that he
had exhausted the art of agriculture and that nature
would do the rest.
In grazing, however, a very famous mode, common
to the whole of Australasia, has long been practised in
New Zealand, namely, sheep farming on the “ squat-
ting ” system; and, ten or a dozen years ago, young men,
with a thousand or two, or more, could nowhere embark
in a more pleasant, manly, profitable pursuit. Leasing
tracts of wild land from the Government at less than a
penny an acre and sticking up a hut or two for selves and
shepherds, they cleared a few acres for stock-yard and
paddock—drew in their barrels of flour, chests of tea,
bags of sugar, from the nearest store—took mutton from
the plain, pig and pigeon from the bush—saw their
flocks multiply with little care or labour to themselves—
sent down their annual dray-borne wool-harvest to their
banker-merchant at the Port —rode into the Settlements
as business or pleasure prompted—practised a rude but
hearty hospitality among each other —ever welcomed the
Stranger at their gates—and formed in New Zealand, as
their fellows had long formed in Australia, a frank,
jovial,high-spirited, pastoral aristocracy:—a brotherhood
of bronzed bush centaurs “ bearded like the pard,” and
creating, in the golden fleece, the Colony’s greatest
Export and most certain source of expanding wealth.
There are still some hundreds of men of this goodly
stamp in New Zealand still engaged in this fine, al
f resco, pursuit; but sheep-farming on this system has
now almost reached its limits in New Zealand, owing
to the circumstance of the wild grazing lands of
the Colony being now taken up; * and so far as regards
* In the east-coast and lake districts of Auckland, and along the
southern shores of Taranaki, there is some fine pastoral country in the
hands of the natives; while along the rugged west coast of the Soutli
Island blocks and bits of grass land may here and there be revealed—but
the day any such grazing ground became available it would be taken up by
Squatters on the spot. Indeed, in reality, persons now emigrating to
New Zealand in the hope of being able to hire, first-hand, from the


tho most profitable feature, the basis of the pursuit,
namely the power of hiring from the Government tracts
of pastoral country at a nominal rent, we may parody
the noble Moor and say the Squatter’s occupation’s gone.
I, however, am not one who regards this limitation or
cessation of squatting-grazing at all as a colonial ca-
lamity. In the earlier days of a new country, when
there is a wilderness of wild land and a sparse pioneer-
ing population, it is an Industry most fitting and bene-
ficial to the young community —but as population flows
in and towns arise, and where, as in New Zealand, soil
and climate enable the plough cheaply to quitituple the
feeding powers of the soil, it is an Industry which may
bo most profitably superseded by the European mode of
grazing on the farm-field system.
Squatting, too, has ever been, and from the very nature
of it must ever he, a pursuit far more suitable for single
young men than for settled, house-dwelling, family, peo-
ple. The production of wool and mutton is no doubt a
meritorious and profitable achievement; but it is not the
“he all” and the “end all” of emigration. I speak from
pretty wide experience when I say that three-fourths
of the flower of our upper class emigrants, tho families
who carry with them £2OOO and £3OOO and £5OOO and
£6OOO, emigrate to a colony like New Zealand in the
hope of purchasing a square mile or two of good ground,
where by plough and fleece, by the judicious application
of their capital, aided by some labour of their hands,
they may gradually create a snug little estate of their
own :—an estate annually rising in value, annually in-
creasing their modest income, one giving them a pleasant
country life not too remote from schools and towns, and
one affording them a safe anchorage in the new Land
from which, as time rolls on and children rise, they may
push out their arms and profit by any of the numerous
little openings for the employment of accumulated
capital, or for the employment of talent, energy, and
respectability which a young and growing Colony like
New Zealand presents to all.
Now, “Squatting” offers a man little or nothing
of this sort. A Squatter, be he lord of _ 10,000 or
20,000 sheep, Peasant’s son or Peer’s, is only a
mere tenant of the bush, only a mere lodger in
Government, 10,000 ami 20,000 acre runs of Rood sheep land, could
no more gratify their desire in New Zealand than they could in Cumber-
land or Kent.


the wilderness. _ His life, however pleasant, is a
life far more suitable for one of our bachelor brother-
hood, some pastoral llobinson Crusoe expatriating
himself to a colony for a dozen years hoping to make
a few thousand pounds and then to return and reward
Jane, than for the married man, or man with a
family, who emigrates to a colony meaning to make
it his own and his children’s home.
Farm-grazing, on the contrary, gratifies this com-
mon desire for the possession of land, and enables
a man and his family to surround themselves with
domestic comforts, and to create, by degrees, a snug
little estate and safe harbour of their own. And owing
partly to the growing belief that grazing, though a
more costly pursuit to commence than squatting and
slower in early return, will eventually prove a most
lucrative pursuit; owing partly to the incoming of a
fresh land-buying population, and to the well-
founded fear of the Squatters that if they don’t buy the
lands they rent others will # —no question, that before
many years are over Squatting, in Hew Zealand, be-
coming a pursuit almost as extinct as the Moa,
will be abandoned for Grazing; and that under this
system, while the Individual’s profits may remain
almost as great as before, the Colony, instead of having
an export of pastoral produce worth five millions ster-
ling, may have an export of pastoral produce worth ten.
This consummation, devoutly to be wished, this great
change in the grazing system of Hew Zealand, is doubt-
less, close at hand; and looking at this and at other
causes likely to shape the course of the future farming
and grazing, I think we may say that the greater part of
the agricultural and pastoral industry of Hew Zealand
will, ere long, be carried on and represented in three
chief sorts or classes of farms, which we may call the
“garden farm,’’ the “mixed farm,’’ and the great
“ grass farm.”f
• Some of the more enlightened of the body have already purchased
portions of their runs preparatory to commencing the grazing system,
and many more will probably soon follow the example. Still, speaking with
all possible respect of the distinguished Squatting Body, I must say that
the majority of it regards this threatened introduction of freeholds and
base mechanical ploughs with no great favour—indeed, when Squatters
get together in divan, their predictions as to the fate of coming Graziers
might well, I think, remind ray readers of the prognostics of the old road
Stagers as to the fate of the Rail.
f It is, I think, not improbable, though, that in the next few years a good
deal of Cattle farming may spring up under the squatting system. Though


The first will often be one of from 50 to 100 acres,
lying on the skirts of some rising t9wn or village,
and the proprietor often some industrious ex-labourer
or mechanic, or retired tradesmen, invalid emigrant,
or professional man, farming either for profit and a
living, or partly for pleasant variety and occupation.
Here, there will he orchard and kitchen-garden, two or
three corn fields, and a couple of good paddocks ; and
here the live stock will he pigs and poultry, half-a-dozen
dairy cows, and often a few good sheep.
The mixed farm will commonly be one of from 200 to
500 acres, and the proprietor frequently some old-country
agriculturist or other small-capitalist emigrant, who,
with his family, will perform a fair share of _ the farm
work. Here, about one fourth of the farm will be de-
voted to corn and root and hay crops, and the remain-
der to pasture; and, here, there will mostly be a
good dairy, a score or two of cattle, and three or four
hundred well-bred sheep.
The great grass farm will be an estate often of from
1000 to 2000 and 3000 acres, and here the proprietor will
frequently be one of the present squatters or one of the
numerous capitalist emigrants now moving to New Zea-
land ; here, there will be a little corn and hay land, with
plenty of space left for garden, orchard, game-cover,
shrubberies, and shelter; but here, four-fifths of the wild
land will gradually be converted into large 50 and 100
acre paddocks, where we shall see a splendid flock of me-
rinoes, with here and there some heavier sheep, often
a little stud of blood horses, and generally a herd of
choice cattle.
Profits of Farming and Grazing.— ln the fore-
going remarks sufficient data and particulars have, I
hope, been given to enable attentive Headers to form a
fair idea of the profits and advantages now to be realized
by emigrating to New Zealand, and engaging there in
agricultural and pastoral pursuits. It is my deliberate
opinion, and one, I think, which nine colonists in ten
there is little or no sheep land left, there is plenty of rough browsing
and grazing land admirably suited for horned stock. Cattle farm-
ing, in the presence of the monopolising sheep, has been but little
attended to. It is rather a wild, back-country pursuit, too, and in
its rougher-riding attributes, compared to sheep farming, may be what
fox-hunting is compared to thistle-whipping. This, however, would be
no drawback to active young men, possessing a few hundreds, or a thou-
sand or so ; and, looking at the prices of stock, and the remarks thereon
at pages 113 and 115, I am strongly of opinion that cattle farming, on the
squatting system, might now be made a very profitable pursuit.


would endorse, that if, as we fairly ought, we count the
actual value of the property created, the improved social
position of the family, and the brighter prospects of the
children, any sum from five hundred to five or ten thou-
sand pounds could now he employed in farming, grazing,
and estate-creating in New Zealand in such a manner as,
at the expiration, say, of ten years, would show results
at least twice as good as those which, with an equal
capital and in an equal period, could now be worked out
by the most active, energetic, man farming and grazing
in any county of the Mother Country from north of
the Tweed to south of Kent.
Concluding Kemaeks.— ln England, where we have
a minute sub-division of labour and employment, farm-
ing and grazing, for the most part, are businesses carried
on only by farmers and graziers, just as professions are
carried on by professional men, and shopkeeping by re-
tail traders. But in New Zealand it is not so. There,
the common desire of mankind for land, for 4 4 acres of
one’s own,” and the almost equally common desire for a
rural life,* are so easily gratified ; and there, too, farm-
ing and grazing are such simple, easily-learned pursuits,
that, sooner or later, almost all members of the com-
munity are found to engage in them. In New Zealand,
and, indeed, in all the colonies which I have seen, three-
fourths of all the agricultural and pastoral business of
the country is carried on by men who had no knowledge
whatever of such business before they emigrated.
Eull half the finest estates in Canada, the Cape Colony,
Australia, and New Zealand, have been created by
such men as retired officers, ex-professional men, and
men originally belonging to the trading and commercial
classes of the Mother Country ; while many of the most
successful of the smaller cultivators, proprietors of the
prettiest 50 and 100-acre farms, originally landed in
Colonies as mechanics, shopkeepers, and artizans.
In New Zealand, too, and, indeed, in many colonies,
it is no uncommon circumstance to find families with
two strings to the bow; that is, families who, while
employing themselves partly in some other pursuit, will
buy land and do a little in the way of farming and
* “ Hackney’il in business, wearied at that oar

grazing. Thus, the mechanic working at his trade,
or the shopkeeper attending to the counter, Xvill fre-
quently have his 50 or his 100 acres near at hand, on
which he, or some of the working force of his family,
will find pleasantly-varied and profitable employment
for a day or two in the week; and thus, the professional
man, the public-office man, the capitalist, while attend-
ing to the light duties of their occupations, or looking
out for snug investments at 10 and 12 per cent., will fre-
quently be found to be men who as partners, or in their
own persons, or in those of some relatives or sons, are
connected with, if not directly engaged in, agricultural
and pastoral pursuits, and men, too, who are often pretty
large proprietors of land.
I state these facts to disabuse my readers of any er-
roneous impression which they might form, that, though
they would like the “rural life” in New Zealand,
they would not be successful in it because they had had no
prior experience of it No doubt, an intelligent
Scotch or English agriculturist would set to work on
wild land in a colony with more confidence than the man
who scarce knew beans from barley—but the Old Country
farmer, accustomed as he has been to a plethora of cheap
labour, to the refinements of chemical manures, to a high
tillage “garden” sort of farming, has often a great deal
to unlearn when he gets to work in the New World; and
practical experience in all colonies, from Canada down to
the Cape, from the Cape to Australia and New Zealand,
proves that, in New Countries, agricultural and pastoral
pursuits are quite as successfully embarked in by emi-
grants of all classes as by the particular few who have
been accustomed to such pursuits at home.
Though, however, a knowledge of farming and graz-
ing as practised in the Old Country is not a necessary,
and not even a very valuable qualification, for the suc-
cessful conduct of such pursuits in a colony, there is
one qualification ■which families who may think of
emigrating to New Zealand with the view of purchasing
land and creating a little estate by Plough and Fleece
must ever possess, and that is, not the ability and
willingness to become hewers of wood and drawers of
water for life, hut the ability and willingness to Use
their own hands for a while in work of field and house.
Possibly, the day may come in New Zealand when we
may have our gentlemen farmers and our country
squirearchy riding round their properties on their bits


of blood, and doing enough, in only directing the labour
they employ. But in these more primitive times, when
farm labour is ss. and 6s. a-day, when domestic servants
are scarce and costly, and when everyone, high and low,
works a bit and find himself all the better, all the lighter
and brighter for it, the Emigrant Family, be they who
they may, small capitalists or large, going to New Zea-
land with the design of going on laud, must go prepared,
master and mistress, sons and daughters, not only to
look after the high-priced labour they employ, but to bear
a hand themselves in the varied, the varied and pleas-
ing, work which, out of doors and in-doors, is ever
going on.
If, only, capitalists and small capitalists will go
prepared to do this for a time, and to laugh at the little
“roughings” and make-shifts of their first settling
down,” it is but sober truth to say that in all human
probability they will in a few years place themselves and
their families in a position of comfort and independence
in New Zealand, a position based on the possession of
that safest of all properties, landed property, which
there would be no reasonable chance of their attaining
to at-home.
Pursuits and Occupations other than Agricultural
and Pastoral. —Having thus discussed the two great
Industries of the young Colony, let us turn to the other
“ pursuits and occupations ” in New Zealand open
to the various orders of Emigrants who may now think
of planting a home there.
The remarks offered on this subject must, however, be
very brief —for, in the first place, I see that my space is
nearly exhausted; and secondly, as agricultural and
pastoral pursuits, leading to the acquisition of little
farms and snug landed estates, are the pursuits in which
almost all orders of the New Zealand community ulti-
mately engage, all other callings and avocations are but
of secondary or subordinate importance ; and need only
be glanced at here as mere stepping-stones to the Plough
and Fleece.
Professional Pursuits.— l would certainly not ad-
vise any professional man, doing even moderately well
at-home, to move to New Zealand, in the hope of doing
better there by the practice of his profession. Many pro-
fessional men, however, with large or increasing fami-
lies, and small or decreasing incomes, have settled in New


Zealand, and many more, probably, ■will follow tlxe ex-
ample.
The Law, in New Zealand, exhibits the alarming spec-
tacle of barrister and attorney rolled into one. There
is a good deal of buying and selling going on, and
a fair amount of simple agreement and conveyancing
work, together with a little sessions and assize business ;
and what with this and the many little public offices
which are created as colonisation extends, and which
lawyers often fill,* and what with the opportunities they
have of cultivating a little land, of investing any spare
hundreds in Sheep, or of becoming partners in Farm or
Run, the Profession, though, happily, not prominent in
New Zealand, is thriving and respectable, and manages
to secure its Oyster without reducing the Public to the
Shell.
As to the medical profession, we may say that New
Zealand is so healthful a country that, save for the con-
stant arrival of young Colonists, doctors would have
nothing to do. Many excellent medical men though,
with families, and a thousand or two, have settled in
New Zealand. As a class they are men shrewdly sensi-
ble of the advantages of health, and the apparently
parodoxical circumstance of so many doctors going to
a country where there are so few patients, may, perhaps,
be accounted for on the supposition that partly to
secure fine climate they sacrifice considerations of pro-
fessional gain. In New Zealand, too, as in most young
colonies, the medical man seldom relies wholly, or even
mainly, on his profession. He may add a hundred or
so a-year to his income by attending fair Colonists, and
setting the broken arm; but, like Retired Officer,
Younger Son, old Indian, or man of law, he generally
gets his “bit of land,” and becoming often a very
popular and successful agriculturist or stock-breeder,
employs himself and family chiefly or partly in the
gradual creation of a little estate.
Clergymen, too, with families, and some small means,
* As some encouragement for the junior Bar, I may perhaps mention
that a gentleman with whom I have the honour of being distantly con-
nected, and whose abandonment of Chancery Lane for New Zealand
might, perhaps, in some very slight degree be attributable to me, embraced
public life on his arrival in the Colony, and now adorns the Bench as one
of my Lords the Judges. I should perhaps also observe, however, to show
that even New Zealand judgeships don’t hang on every bush, that this
gentleman was a sort of hidden Bethel, great in Chambers, great in the
House, and a man who merely wanted a small opening to make and sus-
tain a great name.


dissenting ministers, schoolmasters, surveyors, and
engineers, though none of these callings offer anything
rich or good in New Zealand, nevertheless, seem to
do very well there ; and what with their little glebes
and their bits of farms, often supplementing professional
avocations, appear to enjoy life ; and if they don’t grow
rich, certainly don't grow poor.
Speaking of professions, too, and indeed of many Old
Country occupations, investments, and employments, it
should be recalled to the reader’s recollection that New
Zealand is the mere germ of a country in a state of
rapid development and progression. Capital and labour,
consumers, customers, clients, patients, may almost he
said to be pouring in ; and a man who got settled there
now, say on a bit of land where he could live cheaply,
might in two or three years find a capital opening for
the employment of some particular knowledge, skill, or
qualification, which, on his first arrival, would pro-
duce him but little, or which at first might be alto-
gether dead stock
Idle Investments.—lnterest oe Money. —The
great majority of capitalist emigrants * who go to New
Zealand are people who want some active employment
for themselves and families, and who thus generally
employ their capital on land. But here and there, and
for awhile, at least, a man will sometimes reserve a por-
tion of his capital; and after he has got to know the
Colony and its ways, will invest a few hundreds, or a
thousand or two, in mortgages or in some money-lending
openings at £lO and £l2 per cent.
The Reader may fancy that so high a rate of interest
could only come from bad security; but, if so, he would be
wrong. It is evident that in a young and fertile country
like New Zealand, nearly as large as Britain, where the
population is only that of a first-class British town, and
where the work of colonization and civilization is ever
going on, there must be a large and legitimate demand
for money. And it is equally evident that in such a
country as New Zealand, where there is no injurious
* There are no Barings or Rothschilds among emigrants; but some pos-
sess much greater means than others, and this term is used to signify fami-
lies, such as Retired Officers, Professional men, Younger Sons, and others
who carry out sums of from three to five and six thousand pounds. I
have known as much as £lO,OOO and £12,000 taken to New Zealand, and
one of my present correspondents, will, I daresay, carry with him nearly
£20,000; but these are quite exceptional sums, and, as times go, families
who carry from £3OOO to £4OOO to New Zealand rank there as Capitalists,
and those who take from £5OO to £lOOO as small Capitalists.


competition, where the rich first-fruits of a virgin soil
are being enjoyed, where there are no taxes, no plush
and plumes of society to bleed the purse, and where
profits and savings are thus comparatively great, bor-
rowers of money can better afford to pay £lO per cent ; to
enable them to nurse up and extend their thriving
young concerns than borrowers of money at-home can
afford to pay £5.
In truth, 10 per cent, is rather a low than a high rate ot
interest in New Zealand : —a shrewd, active man, plant-
ing himself down in any neighbourhood, and making it
his business to advance money, would, I think, have no
great difficulty in making £3O, if not £5O per cent., of
his capital in bill-discounting, in short term advances,
and in other ways. This is a sort of usury, however,
which we have nothing to do with here,—we are only
alluding to a plain man who wants to invest a few
hundreds or a thousand or two on some good mortgage
or other security,—and, here, the rate of interest, in
these days, would be at least 10 per cent.
A few hundreds, or a thousand or two, may also be
profitably invested in Sheep. The Squatters, as we
have seen, have taken up all the Runs, but half of them
have not yet stocked up their Huns ; and they will some-
times take a small flock of ewes of some town-dweller
or Capitalist, on such “ sharing terms” as will pay him
handsome interest on the money he may so invest.
Commercial Perseits. —Import and Export Trade
supports a considerable number of mercantile and branch
mercantile Houses. I am not prepared to say that there
are, or that there are not, more openings at the present
time in New Zealand for active commercial men trading
on their own account, or for representatives of English
Houses, establishing Agencies in the Colony. Merchants
are but the mere “mediums of conveyance’’ between
Producers and Consumers, and generally rise up in suf-
ficient number for the wants of the community just as
surely as water rises to its level. > Capitalist emigrants,
however, of a commercial turn, might bear in mind that
even in these infant days, the annual export and import
trade of New Zealand, with her handful of some 140,000
people, is represented by the goodly figures of £4,500,000,
and that this trade is said to have increased five-fold in
the last ten years. _ ,
Shopkeeping, or “ Storekeeping,” as it is called, is a
flourishing pursuit; and dozens of little coast ports


and inland villages are being planted or enlarged
oyer the country where an active family, with a few
hundreds, might do exceedingly well in it. They would
establish a connection with some mercantile House at
the nearest port; open a general Store like an English
village shop (the one where you get hats, hoots, bon-
nets, shawls, shovels, sugar, tea, trousers, turnip-
seed, pickles, gingerbread, and Jew’s-harps) ; buy up
a little farm and dairy produce for shipment to the
port; and not unfrequently, as before observed, would
own abit of land handy to their place of business, and
thus, in bye times, do a little at the soil.
Besides Storekeeping, too, there are other pursuits of
a trading nature capable, I think, of great development
and extension in Few Zealand. Brewing has been
commenced with success; and, looking at the cold-
night climate, the profusion of soft water, the fine malt-
ing barley and fair hops of the country, and at the great
demand for fine ales in the near Australian markets,
brewing will probably become a large and profitable
branch of industry.
The Building Trade, too, has paid and will long
continue to pay famous profits; while active Ship-
builders, with a few hundreds to start with, would
find that the increasing fleet of coasting and colonial-
going cutters, schooners, and small craft would give
them plenty of work. The Whale Fishery, also, might,
I think, be prosecuted and extended with success; while,
as capital and skill flow into the country and multiply
steam power and water-mill, the Timber Trade, botli
for the home and the export market, is, in my opinion,
certain to grow into a very considerable business.*
Manufactures. —At present, Few Zealand cuts but a
small figure in Manufacturing Industry—like all young
communities, she finds it easier, in these her infant
days, to import than to make.
Looking at the abundance of water-power, however,
at the growing abundance of many raw materials for
manufactures, such as wool, hemp, skins, hides, barks,
tallow, &c., and at the rapidly-increasing population,
I incline to think that Few Zealand will commence
various branches of manufacturing industry at a much
* The two islands probably contain 10,000,000 of acres of forest land of
the heaviest description, affording every variety and size of timber
needed for house and ship building; and it is worthy of remark that
New Zealand is almost the only country south of the Equator which
grows any free working wood of the pine character.


earlier period of her existence than lias been usual in
British Colonies.
A few small foundries, a tannery or two, and some
infant cloth and rope works, have been established, all I
believe with fair success, and these are all industries
capable of great extension as population goes on in-
creasing, and capital and labour flow in. The Phormium
Tenax , too, or wild flax, perhaps the strongest vegetable
fibre known, but a plant which, owing to the difiieulty
of freeing it from a certain parasitical, clogging gum,
has hitherto batfled all experimentalists, and defied
the batteries both of chemistry and mechanics, is now,
it is said, to be subdued by a New Zealand Flax Com-
pany forming in Jersey who hope to turn it into such
an export of flax and hemp, paper or paper stuff, as
will prove a handsome addition to the resources of the
Colony. _ . . . ,
Mining Pgestjits.— Yanous ores and mineral sub-
stances have already been turned up in New Zealand,
and it is quite probable that others will he discovered as
the country becomes more opened by settlement. The
slight search hitherto made has been confined to three
or four spots ; and most assuredly in regard to what her
mineral kingdom may give forth, New_ Zealand, even
yet, is little more than the “terra incognita” of Tasman
and Cook. Indeed, accidental discovery, rather than
settled search, seems ever to have revealed the world s
precious ores and metals ; and they have sometimes
lain, undetected for years, under our very eyes.
After twenty years’ occupation of the country, the up-
setting of a dray revealed the copper lodes, and created
Adelaide’s “ Burra-burra; ” hundreds of shepherds
roamed the plains of Yictoria for a quarter of a century
little dreaming that they walked on gold ; and though
no country has less need of mineral wealth than New
Zealand, a few years may prove her to be as rich heloio
the surface as she is above and on it.
"With the exception of gold, however, none of the dis-
covered New Zealand minerals can he said to have been
worked —nor do I regard this as matter for regret. It
seems to me that with millions of acres equal, under good
farming, to the production of forty bushels of wheat per
acre, and with millions of acres equal to the support of
millions of fine-wool sheep, all lying waste and wild,
New Zealand’s most legitimate pursuits, in these her


early days, are the Plough and the Fleece; and that
when the waste has become the farm, when hill and
valley are dotted with merino and short horn, it will
be time enough to take the “ pick,” and to leave the
certain surface to adventure with Colonial Douster-
swivels into the dark and dangerous pits and traps of
mines and mining.*
Gold Mining, however, when the results are such as
have been produced in New Zealand,f is not to be
sneered at, even by growers of the golden-fleece ; and
for such men as our coal and copper mining people, our
stout mechanics and labourers, or strong-backed adven-
turous young fellows who could wield the pick, or form
the escort, or keep the store, the New Zealand gold
fields might now offer an opening which it would be
hard to match. We must remember that they lie in a
country where the climate for eight months in the year
is all that could be wished —that, owing to the narrow-
ness of the island and its great sea-board, the New
Zealand digger can never be very far from stores and
towns, that though some of the ‘ ‘ Knights of the Pick” are
as rough as they look, yet that many of them are men
of education and respectability, and that a quiet cheer-
ful person at the Diggings, who could take his own
!)art if need arose, might soon make himself quite at-
tomo; while we have to bear in mind, that if the “pick”
failed, or he tired of it, there would be the farm, the
sheep station, the mechanic’s shop, at hand, offering
him constant employment and pay double or treble that
which he would get in the old country.
* Lord Bacon, in his Essay on Plantations, in advising the pioneer
Settlers in a new country what to do, says—“ but moil not too much
under ground, for the hope of mines is very uncertain, anduseth to make
the Planters lazy in other things.”—Good, my Lord!
f In some remarks made six years ago on the then newly-dis-
covered little gold fields at Aorere, I ventured to observe that, looking at
the similar character of the three hundred miles of country south of that
spot.it was by no means improbable that the precious metal would be found
in considerable quantities in various places of the South Island, and that
possibly New Zealand might some day have her Ballarat and Bendigo.
Certain wise men of the East—“gentle dulness ever loves a joke ” —were
somewhat facetious on this surmise of mine—but let those laugh who
win ; gold has since been discovered in half-a-dozen places in the country
1 indicated ; some three millions sterling of the root of evil have,
I think, already been obtained from the Otago fields; some fine nuggets
have been picked up at two or three spots on the west coast; and
now, most assuredly, there would be nothing visionary in the assump-
tion that after Victoria, California, and Columbia, New Zealand may
ultimately prove to be the chief gold-producing country in the world.


Mechanic and Laboheing Ptjeshits. —Carpenters,
wheelwrights, shipwrights, sawyers, coopers, cabinet-
makers, blacksmiths, bricklayers, saddlers, shoemakers,
boatmen, farm labourers, shepherds, gardeners, and steady
working men of all sorts, and the working sons of all such,
and their daughters, willing for a while to take service,
find constant employment in New Zealand at wages full
double, sometimes treble, those which they obtain at
home ; and there are hundreds, I might say thousands,
of this great order of emigrants in New Zealand who,
landing in the Colony ten years ago with nothing save
strong arms, sober habits, and a few shillings in the
purse, are now masters of thriving businesses, or owners
of comfortable little freehold farms, and debtors to no
man a penny.
Cleeks.— Shopmen, —The experience of practical life
in all Colonies shows that of all the many classes of the
Mother Country who resort to emigration none gain so
little by the movement as youths accustomed only
to the counter and the desk; and most unquestionably,
as a general rule, this order of our community does best
to stay at-home. Here and there, however, there will
he found among its ranks young men of early coun-
try training, or strong country tastes, of bold spirit,
and robust physique, to whom desk and counter grow
daily less endurable, and who often glance longingly at
Colonies and Emigration. And young men of this de-
scription who would prove their fitness for emigration
by such a test as that of devoting six months, or their
evenings for twelve, to the learning of rough carpentry
or some useful handicraft, and who, landing in New
Zealand with a ten-pound note, would be willing to work
with head and hands, and willing “to rough it” for
a while, might undoubtedly now go there assured that
the life they would have would be a more pleasant and
congenial one than that of the office or shop, and
that after a few years of steady industry and active
work they might expect to reach a much better posi-
tion in the new Land than any they could reasonably
hope to attain to in the Old.
Female Emigeation. —Almost any number of re-
spectable young women now emigrating to New Zealand
with parents or brothers, and taking service for a while
in the families of Colonists, where, if they were not
treated more as humble friends than servants it would
be their own fault, would find excellent situations as
K


cooks, house-maids, nurse-maids, dairy-maids, and
maids of all work, at wages full double those which they
obtain at-home ; while, as there are nearly two single,
well-to-do, young men in the colony to one single young
woman, the matrimonial prospects of Anne and Alice,
Jane and Mary, would, I presume, be deemed as good as
could be desired.
With respect to another most valuable, but far worse
requited order of the Mother Country’s female community,
the “ Governess Class,” I regret that I cannot speak in so
wholesale, so confident, a way. I should be most sorry,
even by a word of doubt, to express any premature
opinion that Miss Rye’s admirable efforts to throw open
our Colonies to educated Women will not eventually be
as successful as that brave and philanthropic Lady
could herself desire. But, confining ourselves to New
Zealand, and speaking of New Zealand as it is in 1863,
I must say that I do not think that any great emi-
gration of young ladies to the Colony, as Governesses,
would now be attended with success. At the same
time, I would observe that young persons inclined to
accompany friends to New Zealand, the sort who can
teach plain things well, and who would make them-
selves generally useful in a house, might now go there
pretty certain of obtaining comfortable situations in the
establishments of old-settled Colonists, and pretty cer-
tain, too, ere long, of having little establishments of their
own.
These, I think, are the principal occupations and em-
ployments open to capital and labour, enterprise and
skill, in our young Britain of the South. Whether to go
thither, whether to go somewhere else, whether to stay
at-home, are questions on which volunteered advice
from a stranger to those who are glancing at “New
Homes in New Lands” would be an impertinence, and
questions, too, which each one can best answer for him-
self—but I may observe that when families who may
be contemplating emigration are debating the grave
subject of whether to go, or to stay, and are passing
in review the various advantages and drawbacks of
Colonies, there is one consideration which they
would do well ever to bear in mind, and that is this
—that while many of the “ills and evils’’ of the Old
Country, the things we emigrate to escape from, are
every year becoming greater , many of the “ ills and


evils ” we object to in the Young Country are every
year becoming less.
Despite the persistive guessing of Brother Jonathan,
despite the direful threats of Meaghers of the
Sword, Heroes of the Cabbage Garden, and the
New York press, Old England, we shall trust, will be
loDg ere she reaches the culminating height of her glorious
prosperity, her glorious renown : she is still rising, her
coal measures still last, cotton is not her heart, and
Scythian Celt and Federal Hun, banded with big Bruin
of the North, may never come —or, if they come, may
never return. But, surely, he would be a bold man who
would assert that such evils as excess of competition,
pauperism, high taxation, prohibitive price of land,
difficulty of planting out families, are not evils far
more likely to increase than to decrease in England;
whereas the evils or drawbacks we object to in Colonies,
such as remoteness of scene, roughness of life, dearness of
labour, are every year becoming less—for these things
are but the mere fleeting ailmentsof acolony’searlyyouth,
passing away as the age of manhood is approached, and
as childish troubles are outgrown.
We see that science is every year virtually bringing
our Emigration fields nearer to our doors ; that in all of
them capital and labour are everywhere subduing the
wilderness, planting the town, raising the spire, founding
the school; we see that one year in the New Land some-
times marks as great a change, as great an advance,
as twenty years in the Old; and it appears to me that
there is nothing extravagant in the assertion that
Colonies bid fair to become Countries where while we
shall find much of that which makes the good of England
we shall find but little of that which makes the had.
And now, repeating, here, what I said at the com-
mencement, namely, that I shall always be happy,
during my residence in this country, to give my Readers
any further information in my power about New
Zealand,* and heartily wishing all of them who may go
there all possible success, I bring my humble essay to a
close, and subscribe myself their sincere well-wisher.
Charles Hursthouse.
* Here, perhaps, I may name a little matter which I should
still pass over with indifference did I not think it right to put
those who might like to ask me a question or two about New Zea-
land, or any other emigration field with which I am acquainted,
a little on their guard. There are now in this country several


Agents of the various New Zealand and Australian Governments,
openly and legitimately employed in London and elsewhere in
advocating the merits of their respective Colonies and in pro-
moting emigration thereto. I have never had the slightest
connection with any of these Governments, nor with any of their
Agents; but Colonies and Emigration have long been fa-
vourite subjects with me, and, through reading one or two little
publications of mine thereon, many families contemplating emi-
gration have applied to me, during my residence in this country,
for further information, some of whom have doubtless been en-
couraged to emigrate by me, while others who may have seemed
to me unfit for a colonial career have perhaps been induced to
think better of staying at-home.
Now, most of the gentlemen I allude to, the Agents of these
Colonial Governments, would, I have no doubt, rather thank me
than otherwise for the little assistance I have thus been enabled
to give to the cause of emigration —but others of them, sillily
jealous of me, it would seem, or irate at certain “ cautions ”
I once thought it my duty to publish about New Zealand, appear
to regard me with an almost amusing degree of animosity, and
seldom, I believe, lose an opportunity of throwing stones at poor
Mr. Hursthouse when anyone, contemplating emigration to New
Zealand or elsewhere, happens to let drop before them that he
thinks of asking that unintentional Offender a question or two
before the grave step is taken.
Having had occasion, over leaf, to make passing allusion to the States,
I may here, perhaps, be permitted to add, in grateful remembrance of
the warm welcome everywhere given me when there, that we must not
judge our Western Kinsmen only by their turgid orators and their fla-
gitious Press. Judging the Americans by the brutal utterances, the
revolting mendacity, of some of their Prints, Preachers, and Speakers,
we might almost be provoked to say that mankind would gain were
their name and nation swept off the map—judging them as they are
at-home, weighing their domestic virtues, tbeir practical kindness of
heart, their dashing originality of character, toned down as it is by
their great good sense, we should pronounce them full the equal of the
imperial race from which they spring.
Good, and shrewd, as they may be, however, it is, I think, quite a mis-
take on the part of our American friends to attribute their national great-
ness to their form of government. Next to the virtues and energies of
her sons, the great cause of the marvellous growth and progress of the
United States has not been her republican institutions, but her bottomless
cornucopias of millions of acres of fertile wild land, and the vast, the in-
calculable, gifts of capital and labour, money and people, made her, for
half a century, by Germany and Britain. With the same advantages, any
people, other than Neapolitans or Hindoos, under any government, other
than Mexican or Russian, could not have failed to have made a powerful
nation of a magnificent territory like that of the States; and monarchists
might assert that the real greatness of America no more proceeds from
universal suffrage and the ballot-box than the motion of our carriage pro-
ceeds from the pretentious fly revolving on the spoke of the wheel.
