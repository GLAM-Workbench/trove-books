dark smooth), which we consider the best of their respective grades, in the pipe, and the burn and flavour
are quite satisfactory. The flavour is sweet and soft, with no heat or unpleasant twang, while the burning
is all that could be desired. We consider that tobacco like these samples would come to a very good market
in this country, and find favour with manufacturers, if they could be imported to sell at somewhere about
the prices we estimate as their present value .... We should put the value of these
Australian samples at somewhere about Is. 6d. per lb. for the dark, and Is. 9d. per lb. forthe colory grades.”

REPORT.
The Select Committee of the House of Representatives appointed to inquire into and
report upon the position of the Tobacco-growing Industry in Australia, with special regard to
the following aspects : ®
{a) The request of the growers submitted to the Prime Minister at Canberra in May,
1928, for a bounty on Australian-grown leaf.
(b) The alternative request of the growers, submitted on the same occasion, for an
increase in the duty on imported leaf and a decrease in the excise duty on
locally-grown leaf. J
(c) As to whether the arrangement entered into between the Commonwealth
Government, certain States, and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,
to carry out experiments in the growing of tobacco leaf in Australia, is in the
best interests of the growers.
{d) As to whether, in the best interests of the growers, the arrangement should be
altered so as to ensure that the Federal direction of experimental work should
be made a permanent phase of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia.
has the honour to report as follows :
INTRODUCTORY.
1. The Select Committee visited all the tobacco-growing areas in Australia, with the
exception of those in Western Australia and Northern Queensland. In the two States mentioned
only very small quantities of leaf are at present being produced for commercial purposes, and
the Committee was able to obtain all necessary evidence relating to these activities. The areas
visited were Tamworth, Manilla, Texas and Tumut (New South Wales) ; Wangaratta, Myrtleford
and Pomonal (Victoria); and Mount Barker (South Australia). Evidence in regard to the
Queensland areas was taken at Brisbane ; whilst the Minister for Agriculture in Western Australia
furnished the Committee, by letter, with official information on that State 5 s participation ir the
industry. No evidence was sought from Tasmania, where there is no tobacco-growing for
commercial purposes at present.
All members of the Committee visited the areas in the districts mentioned, and the fullest
possible investigation was made into the condition of the industry, both by inspection of the
work of growers and direct interrogation of witnesses. The greatest publicity was given to these
visits, and to the wish of the Committee to hear evidence from all persons interested in the
tobacco-growing industry. The evidence was not restricted to the specific references, but every
phase was opened to throw light upon the position of the industry in all its cultural and commercial
directions.
The Committee is satisfied that the full scope of the inquiry was explored in every useful
direction , also that the growers, manufacturers and other interested persons who gave evidence
fully appreciated the efforts of the Committee to understand the nature of the problems affecting
this important industry. It is considered that every interest in the Australian tobacco-growing
industry was fully represented in this inquiry, and that ample opportunity was given each interest
to present its views both by means of sworn evidence and cross-examination of witnesses
2. The total number of sittings was 34. Altogether 85 witnesses were sworn and
examined, while the number of questions asked totalled 6,245. The total mileage travelled
by the members of the Committee in the work of inspection and taking of evidence was 8,847.
The inquiry was commenced in Melbourne on 23rd January, 1930. To have its report
completed by the date specified in the Parliamentary resolution, namely, Ist July, 1930; the
Committee had to take every opportunity of sitting.
F. 218.—2


Representation Before Committee.
3. At the outset, a request was received from the British-Australasian Tobacco Co.
Pty. Ltd. to be allowed to have counsel or other representatives at all the sittings, in order that
the interests of the Company should be fully protected. After careful consideration, the
Committee decided that there was no necessity for counsel, but agreed to a non-legal representative,
preferably a director of the Company. The Company accepted this offer and Mr. C. L. Bentley,
a director, who gave evidence on behalf of the Company, appeared at all sittings until
he had to leave for England about the middle of April. His place was then taken by Mr. W. W.
R. Swinson, also a director of the Company. Mr. C. E. Lough, the Company’s tobacco buyer
in Australia, was also given permission to attend the sittings. The representatives of the Company
were at all sittings invited by the Chairman to ask the witnesses any questions, and this privilege
was availed of on many occasions.
The Committee is satisfied that its action in allowing the British-Australasian Tobacco
Co. Pty. Ltd. to take an active part in the investigation was fully vindicated by the attitude
of the growers, who freely answered the questions of the Company’s representatives. The
Company also assisted considerably not only by its comprehensive written statement submitted
in evidence by Mr. Bentley, but by its submission, whenever required, of actual figures from its
account sales showing prices, quantities, qualities and gradings of tobacco purchased in any year
from particular growers. The Committee found this information extremely helpful in ascertaining
the improvement made by various growers in the cultivation, curing and grading of their tobacco.
The Committee also, at the outset, invited the various associations of tobacco-growers
in each State to have an accredited representative present at the sittings. In most cases this
invitation was accepted, but owing to the expense of travelling, it was impossible for growers’
representatives to attend more than the sittings in their local centre. Representatives of
associations or groups of growers who gave evidence and also asked questions of witnesses were
Messrs. F. B. Darling (President of the Victorian Tobacco Growers’ Association, Wangaratta) ;
W. Considine Parkes (President of the Northern Tobacco Growers’ Association of New South
Wales, Tamworth) ; E. V. Kremer (Vice-President of the Manilla Tobacco Growers’ Association);
W. Lennon (Texas Tobacco Growers); M. Murphy (President of the Pomonal Tobacco Growers’
Association) ; E. A. Hunt (President of the Tobacco Growers’ Association of South Australia,
Mount Barker) ; and R. C. Stevenson (President of the Southern District Tobacco Growers’
Association of New South Wales, Tumut).
Mr. G. M. Slagg, M.Sc., Director of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, was also invited
by the Committee to be present on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation, and a similar invitation to be present was extended to the State tobacco experts
to attend on behalf of the State Departments of Agriculture. Mr. Slagg was present at nearly
all sittings throughout the inquiry, and asked questions of witnesses. Messrs. Temple A. J.
Smith (Victoria), and C. J. Tregenna (New South Wales) attended the sittings in their respective
States, as the Government experts, and were permitted to ask questions of witnesses, if they so
desired.
Evidence was submitted, not only by every association of growers and many individual
growers, but by every manufacturer who cared to appear before the Committee ; also by many
individuals outside both the growing and manufacturing interests, who came forward in response
to the open invitation extended in Press notices, to afford any information at their disposal;
all members of the Executive and Research Committees and the principal members of the staff
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, the chief officers of the Commonwealth Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research ; and by the responsible officials of the Departments of
Agriculture in the States of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia.
The Committee regrets that owing to the absence from Australia of Mr. Peter Michelides,
Managing Director of Michelides Limited, Tobacco Manufacturers, of Perth, Western Australia,
it was unable to obtain any evidence from that company, which the Committee understands
from statements made by growers in evidence is a large buyer of Australian-grown leaf
principally from Victoria.
Public Interest in Tobacco Industry.
4. The Committee has been impressed with the interest shown by the Press and
the public in this inquiry. Wherever the Committee went it met mayors, aldermen,
public officials, newspaper proprietors and reporters, and a considerable number of other citizens,
and invariably the keenest interest was displayed in the Australian tobacco-growing industry.
A number of witnesses not actively identified with the industry voluntarily came forward to express
very emphatic opinions regarding the alleged poor quality of Australian-grown leaf. A great
many of the witnesses, also, expressed definite disagreement with the suggestion that various


brands of tobaccoes manufactured in part or whole from Australian leaf were of poor smoking
quality, with a bad aroma. Almost without exception those who, as smokers, were capable of
expressing opinions, disputed the contention that there was a characteristic nastiness about
Australian tobacco, which rendered it distinctly unpalatable to the average smoker. The
majority were of opinion that it was all a question of taste, with the retail price an important
factor. In many instances, these witnesses were invited to examine, and in some cases to smoke
various samples of Australian tobaccoes manufactured by the British-Australasian Tobacco Co.
and Dudgeon and Arnell. With few exceptions the witnesses considered that on appearance
these tobaccoes were inviting, and that the smoking palates to which they were adapted would
not find them unpleasant. “ Waratah ”, an all-Australian brand manufactured by the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, received many favorable comments. Cigarettes and pipe
tobacco manufactured from samples of Queensland leaf submitted by Mr. Slagg, the Federal
Director, were the subject of the highest encomiums. Cigarettes manufactured from samples
of Victorian tobacco, some with a slight admixture of Turkish tobacco, submitted by Mr. Temple
Smith, met with unmistakeable approval.
The great interest taken in the inquiry not only by growers but by other citizens who
can be regarded as representative of the general public, satisfies the Committee that there is now
an awakened public conscience distinctly sympathetic towards the development of tobacco-
growing in Australia. The Committee believes that any Australian brands placed on the market,
and effectively advertised, would attract a large number of smokers, more especially if the price
were considerably lower than the price of the majority of brands made from imported tobacco.
It is probable, too, that if appropriate Australian names were given these local brands, the task
of the retailers would be greatly lessened.
HISTORY OF TOBACCO-GROWING INDUSTRY IN AUSTRALIA.
5. The printed records of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia were made available
to the Committee. It is, however, very difficult to glean a connected story of the whole industry.
An interesting summary of an historical nature is contained in the following excerpt from the
evidence of Dr. Rivett:—
The introduction of the seed of tobacco and its first cultivation in Australia would appear to have taken place
at least 75 years ago. It is possible that migrating gold-miners brought in seed and cultivated the crop for their own
use. Certain it is that all of the older districts are situated at, or in the vicinity of, old gold diggings. On the other
hand, it seems probable that much of the earlier extensive planting was for the purpose of making sheep dip. Once
introduced, tobacco-growing undoubtedly received its first impetus in the decade 1860-70, during and immediately
after the cival war in America, when leaf imports were greatly restricted.
The census records show that tobacco culture in Australia has undergone marked fluctuations. It is ranked
as one of our minor crops, although at one time it gave promise of occupying an important place in agriculture. In
1888-89 the area under crop was stated to be 6,641 acres, including 4,833 acres in New South Wales, 1,685 acres in
Victoria, and 123 acres in Queensland. This early expansion was, however, not sustained, and the following years,
while exhibiting wide variations in acreage and production, showed generally a downward trend. In 1920-21 the total
Commonwealth acreage was 1,345. In 1922-23 this increased to 3,727 acres, but since then the area has declined
until in 1927-28 only 2,133 acres were devoted to the crop. Of this acreage, 803 acres were in New South Wales, 1,176
acres in Victoria, 135 acres in Queensland, 17 acres in South Australia, and 2 acres in Western Australia.
Various witnesses remembered extensive growing by certain individuals in New South
Wales and Victoria fifty or sixty years ago, and in Queensland twenty years ago. In those days
all the leaf was sun-cured, and was of the dark, heavy quality used largely in plug tobacco,
which was the form most popular with smokers up to the beginning of the present century.
New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland employed tobacco experts at various intervals to
assist growers, but as the industry did not show any tendency to expand appreciably, and as
the manufacturers began to show disfavour to growers of dark and heavy leaf, the State
Departments of Agriculture, with the exception of Victoria, did not appear to display continuous
interest. If a suitable man happened to be available, he was given the opportunity to see what
he could do with the industry; but as few really experienced men were available, no systematic
policy was pursued to try out the full possibilities of tobacco cultivation and curing.
6. On the manufacturing side, the history of Australian tobacco is more definite. Prior
to the formation of the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ld., somewhere about the year
1904, a number of small unassociated companies were manufacturing. These companies
bought all the available local tobacco, which was usable for the dark plug brands which in those
days seemed to suit the taste of the smoking public. The prices paid for the leaf were variable,
from Id. to Is. per lb., according to the quality of the leaf or the urgency of the occasion. Prices
in the vicinity of 6d. and Bd. appear to have been general; although in some years as high as
Is. 3d. was secured. Chinese growers flocked into the industry, many on shares with white
land-owners. The tedious method of setting out and looking after the plants appealed to the


Chinese temperament, and the simple process of curing, namely by cutting the green leaf and
hanging it in sheds to dry over a six-month period without any expert attention, made no special
demand upon the technique of the growers. There seemed to be no anxiety on the part of the
manufacturers to secure light and bright leaf, consequently few growers made a study of soils,
varieties of leaf, methods of cultivation and modern processes of curing.
Notwithstanding the poor quality of the leaf grown thirty or forty years ago —poor,
according to present-day standards —many white and Chinese growers kept in the industry
for years, and apparently found the low prices of those days sufficient inducement. Very little
plant or equipment was needed, therefore the capital outlay to commence growing tobacco was
not heavy ; and as a side line the crop was, in a favourable season, likely to yield a satisfactory
profit. There is little doubt that one of the inducements to land-owners was the fact that Chinese
were always eager to grow a crop on shares, taking all the risks and giving the land-owner very
little worry.
Several witnesses testified to the good smoking qualities of some of the early tobaccoes
grown in New South Wales and elsewhere. They admitted, however, that the taste of the
public had radically altered since then. A few of these references are worth quoting:—
Mr. C. F. White, Managing Director of Texas Estates —
3267. I understand that you desire to tell the committee something about a local tobacco manufacturer here;
is that so? -Yes, in the eighties. Greenup Brothers erected a factory in this district. They manufactured a brand of
tobacco, which they called Texas Gold Bar, and I liked it immensely from the first time I smoked it.
3268. Was it a dark tobacco?—No, it was bright. At that time the men on the station all smoked the very
black tobacco, such as Negro Head. When I introduced the Texas tobacco, the men got to like it so much that the
ordinary American stick tobacco was left on my hands for months. While Texas Gold Bar was obtainable, neither
X nor my neighbours smoked anything else. It was a light tobacco that did not burn the tongue. As regards aroma,
it seems to me it is only a matter of getting used to a tobacco. That Texas Gold Bar was Chinese grown and air-cured
and naturally there were only a few leaves on each plant, and only a small part of the crop suitable for that kind
of tobacco. Consequently, there was not much of it made, and it did not become very widely known throughout
Queensland or Australia.
3269. Do you remember at what price it was sold?—lt was cheaper than the American tobacco, but Ido not
remember what the price was.
3270. Do you think that its cheapness had anything to do with its popularity?—l do not think so. It was the
quality that counted. It was grown here on these Texas flats.
Mr. G. H. Saywell, at Sydney—(Q.so22)
“In the sixties there were several factories at work in Sydney. Those factories usually produced a blend of
Colonial and American leaf During the nineties quite a substantial trade was done in this.
blend, and a considerable amount of Colonial leaf was produced and consumed ”
Mr. P. McNamara, at Adelaide—(Q.sl2o)
“ 1 know five tobacco workers who have worked with the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd., for thirty years
They all smoke Australian tobocco. One uses Challenger ”, and another man who has had forty years experience
in the trade smokes dark twist made by the Company ”
7. With the advent of the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd., the position of the
growing industry rapidly altered. The principal local manufacturers, notably Cameron
Bros., Dixson, and W. D. and H. 0. Wills merged into the bigger company, and a
number of the smaller factories sooner or later went out of existence. Up to that time the bulk
of the tobacco smoked in Australia was imported in the manufactured state. According
to Mr. Bentley (Q. 285): —
About the year 1895 manufacturers found that they could not establish a successful business by manufacturing
solely or mainly from Australian-grown leaf, and several businesses actually failed which tried to do so. The public
would not take the product and the bulk of the trade was done in imported manufactured brands. This is borne out
by the fact that of the total quantity of tobacco consumed in Australia in 1896 no less than 60 per cent, was imported
manufactured tobacco. To meet the position, the use of imported leaf became essential to any manufacturer who
hoped for success, and it is only because of the use by manufacturers of American leaf that the competition with the
imported article was met, and that there is any tobacco manufacturing industry of any magnitude in existence in
Australia to-day. As a result of this policy practically the whole of the imported manufactured tobacco trade was
captured by the Australian factories, which would have been impossible had only Australian-grown leaf been used.
It was the policy of the new tobacco merger to manufacture locally. Realizing that to
do this it would be necessary to secure the same class of tobacco leaf which was used largely by
British and American manufacturers, the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd. reduced
its use of Australian-grown leaf very considerably. Prior to this, the local manufacturers were


using as much as 30 per cent, of Australian-grown leaf in their tobaccoes, and within a few
years they reduced this to 10 per cent.; and to-day it appears that only about 5 per cent, of
local leaf is used in the total manufactures, the percentage varying in the different brands of
of tobacco.
In the course of a few years many of the old popular brands of dark and medium plug
tobaccoes disappeared off the Australian market, giving place to light sliced tobacco in attractive
tins and packets. According to the evidence of the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd.,
the public showed marked appreciation of the change, as indicated by the steady increase in
the demand for all light brands of pipe tobacco. In the last few years cigarettes have come
more into favour, necessitating a still lighter type of leaf of suitable burning quality. It is safe
to say that, as in Great Britain and the United States, so in Australia ; at least 60 per cent,
of the manufactured output is in the form of cigarettes, with a decreasing demand for pipe
tobacco (vide Ninth Report of the Imperial Economic Committee, p. 16-17). Cigars are rapidly
going out of favour in Australia, the trade in this regard having fallen to infinitesimal
proportions.
The necessity to import larger quantities of light leaf from the United States seems to
have decided the local manufacturers to definitely discourage the growing of the old types of
dark heavy leaf in Australia. Not understanding the position, and not seeing any objection to
growing tobacco which was purchased at average prices ranging from 6d. to Is. 3d. per lb.,
many of the old growers took little notice of the continual complaint of the buyers that the local
leaf was unsuitable. Probably the presence of many Chinese growers in the principal tobacco
areas, notably at Texas and Tamworth, had a good deal to do with the obstinate refusal to make
a serious effort to improve the methods of cultivation and curing. The British-Australasian
Tobacco Co. Ltd., being the principal buyer—other buyers being spasmodic and not in a big
way of business-found itself between the years 1919 and 1923 overloaded with dark leaf in
storage.
In those years there was comparatively little flue-curing in the northern New South Wales
tobacco areas—Tamworth, Manilla and Texas—and in a good season, notably 1923, the total
crop of the heuvy sun-cured leaf would be as much as 1,500 tons. Flue-curing was being
introduced, to the Tumut district, the only other part of New South Wales which was
endeavouring to grow tobacco with a definite commercial purpose ; but at Tumut less than
100 tons would be harvested. Victoria had by 1922 gone wholly into flue-curing and in that year
produced 150 tons. That State had not for many years made serious attempts to revive the
growing of tobacco by the old-time methods, and not since the very early days have there
been any Chinese communities in the Victorian tobacco areas.
8. The British-Australasian Tobacco Co. decided about the year 1919 to issue an
ultimatum to growers of the dark and heavy leaf. In 1923 a meeting was called at Tamworth
by the late Mr. John Gilmour, the Company’s buyer, and nearly all the local white growers
assembled. Mr. Gilmour told the meeting that the time had come to grow a brighter type of
leaf, and to adopt the flue-curing method, otherwise his company could not undertake to make
any further purchases in those areas. In other words, growers who persisted in offering dark,
heavy leaf would do so at the risk of finding the product unsaleable.
From that time the whole character of the Australian tobacco-growing industry radically
altered. The Company, appearing before the Tariff Board in stated clearly that it had no
desire to kill the Australian industry, but merely aimed at inducing growers to concentrate on
the production of light and aromatic tobacco, which would be more acceptable to the local
taste. An agreement, endorsed by the Tariff Board, was drawn up under which the company
engaged to purchase not less than 1,400 tons each year (700 tons each from New South Wales
and Victoria) for a period of three years at prices ranging from 2s. 6d. to 6d. for the various grades
of leaf, namely, lemon coloured 2s. 6d., bright mahogany 25., and No. 1 dark Is. 6d., No. 2 dark
and bright 6d. to Is. per lb. ; and it agreed to furnish samples of the qualities required for
the inspection of growers at the State Departments of Agriculture.
The growers in all the tobacco districts appear to have awakened to the facts of
the situation. The company extended the period for the extinction of the old sun-drying method
of curing by two years, undertaking to reduce the amount of the purchases of the dark, heavy
leaf in the Tamworth and Manilla districts until at a stated period no more would be accepted.
9. The growers both in New South Wales and Victoria immediately took the keenest
interest in the more intricate problems of the industry, and various associations were started,
culminating in the formation of an Australian Tobacco Growers’ Association. This body


requested a further and fuller investigation into the industry by the Tariff Board, and the then
Minister for Trade and Customs (the late Hon. H. E. Pratten) finally acceded. The Tariff
Board in 1926 visited certain tobacco areas and took evidence from growers, and also held
sittings in Sydney and Melbourne. The inquiry was largely into the economic position of the
industry, costs of production in relation to the prices paid by the manufacturers being the
principal line of investigation. The Board’s report, dated 3rd March, 1927, considered that
the industry had not emerged from the stage of dark, heavy tobacco production, and held that
the manufacturers were justified in their refusal to pay more than the guaranteed prices—which
prices the Board reported were 200 per cent, above world parity. The growers, in their evidence,
had asked for either a bounty from the Federal Government, or more protection by means of
higher import duties and a lowering of the excise. The Board considered the protection of 2s.
per lb., then existing, was ample ; but to encourage growers, who were subjected to serious
risks and losses through seasonal adversities and certain pests, among which blue mould (a
parasitic fungus disease) was proving disastrous, recommended a reduction of 6d. per lb. in
the excise on Australian-grown tobacco. The Board did not offer a scheme, but suggested that
this excise reduction should be handed to the growers in some way to be determined by the
Minister for Trade and Customs.
The recommendation of the Tariff Board was not acted upon ; instead the Minister
accepted an offer made by the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd. to give a voluntary
bonus on certain qualities of tobacco, the amount of the bonus ranging from 3d. to 6d. according
to the colour of the leaf purchased. This bonus was raised in 1928-29 to Is. for all bright leaf
bringing 2s. or over. It was indicated by Mr. Bentley (Q. 318) that the first 3d. was given to
encourage flue-curing, the next 3d. was to give a little more encouragement to the growing of
bright leaf ; and that the additional 6d. was equivalent to the recommendation of the Tariff
Board and was virtually given by the Company to help the grower during the transitory period.
The majority of growers were always dissatisfied with the bonus arrangement, and in
May, 1928, held a conference at Canberra, at which some thirty delegates from Victorian and
New South Wales tobacco areas attended. A deputation waited upon the then Prime Minister
(the Bt. Hon. S. M. Bruce), and reiterated the request for either a Government bounty
ranging from 3d. to 9d. on different colours of leaf, or further protection through the Tariff.
The Prime Minister declined to accept either proposal, but said the matter would be referred to
Cabinet for consideration.
No further action having been taken, the growers in 1929 pressed for Parliamentary action.
The appointment of this Select Committee was the outcome.
10. The history of the industry may be summed up as follows :
From the early eighties to the year 1903 considerable crops of dark, heavy leaf mostly
acceptable to the manufacturers of those days were grown in New South Wales and Victoria.
In that period the industry, particularly in New South Wales, was largely in the hands of Chinese
share-farmers. Various good brands of Australian tobacco were produced by local
manufacturers ; but the bulk of the tobacco smoked in Australia was imported in a manufactured
state.
From 1903 to 1920 the bulk of the tobacco grown in Australia was produced in northern
New South Wales, where the 1 Chinese share-farmers still adhered to the old methods
and produced a dark leaf which was not acceptable to the manufacturers. Victoria had gone in
for flue-curing, but was not growing tobacco extensively, as seen in the Table in this report showing
areas under tobacco. Queensland was confining her attention to small plots of cigar-leaf in
North Queensland and pipe tobacco in the Texas district. None of the other States was growing
tobacco commercially. The total Australian production in any of those years would be from
1,000 to 1,200 tons, fully 80 per cent, of which would be sun-dried, dark leaf.
Between 1918 and 1923, the principal manufacturer, the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company Ltd. decided that it would no longer continue to purchase unlimited quantities of
sun-dried dark leaf, and advised growers to grow bright leaf and to adopt flue-curing. The
company in 1918 entered into an agreement to purchase, if available, 2,000,000 lb. of leaf a year
for three years, at fixed prices. As the result of the smaller output inevitable by the adoption
of flue-curing, and effects of the season, the production dropped heavily after 1923. The next
good season was in 1925-26, when 1,000 tons were produced.
At the present time, the growers are producing not more than one-fifth or one-sixth of
the quantity of bright leaf asked for by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,

FEDERAL TOBACCO INVESTIGATION.
13. The origin of the Australian Tobacco Investigation dates from an offer made by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Pty., Ltd., before the Tariff Board in 1926 to further assist
m the development of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia. Particulars of the company’s
offer and the development of the necessary organization to give effect to it are given in the First
Annual Report of the Development and Migration Commission, 1926-27, viz. :
, August, 1926, the representative of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd., when giving evidence
before the Tariff Board, made an offer on behalf of the Company to provide a sum up to £50,000, for expenditure in
conjunction with the Federal and/or State Governments on a £ for £ basis for the development of the tobacco-growing
industry in Australia. Os
The Development and Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research subsequently
discussed this offer with the Company, with the result that a definite proposal was submitted by the Company and
Com ra°nwealth Government. The arrangement is that over a period of three years the Company
wi find £20,000 rateably with the sum of £lO,OOO to be found by the Commonwealth and/or State Governments for
tlie purpose of carrying out investigations and field experiments. If, at the expiration of the three-year period,
developments are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant further effort, and it is mutually agreed that further expenditure
is justified, the Company will provide a further £30,000, conditionally upon the Commonwealth and/or State
Governments providing a similar amount. The total amount that may be applied to this work is, therefore, £90,000.
ilie Commonwealth Government has made an arrangement with the Governments of the five mainland States, under
which it is provided that, oyer the first period of three years, the Commonwealth will find £5,000 and each State £l,OOO,
and over the second period the Commonwealth £15,000 and each State £3,000.
Under the terms of the Agreement, an Executive Committee to control the policy and general direction of the
investigation was constituted, and it was agreed that the contributing States should nominate the Directors of
Agriculture, or such other officers deemed suitable, to act as an Advisory Committee.
, was also a condition of the Agreement that the Executive Committee should consist of a representative of
the Commission, a representative of the Executive of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and a third
member to be jointly appointed by these two bodies.
n a now consists of Mr. H. W. Gepp, the Chairman of the Development and Migration Commission,
Dr. A C. D. Rivett, Chief Executive Officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research ; and Dr. Darnell-Smith
Director of the Botanic Gardens Sydney, who has had considerable experience on the scientific investigational side
of the tobacco industry in Australia. It has also been decided to appoint as an additional full member of the Executive
Dr. S. b Cameron, the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Agriculture of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
esearch. It may be mentioned that all the State Departments of Agriculture are represented on this Standing
Committee by their permanent heads. &
The investigation will cover the whole field of the economic production of tobacco in Australia. Two factors
which, more than any other, dominate the industry in Australia are, firstly, the prevalence of a destructive parasitic
fungus disease in the seed-beds, commonly called “ blue mould,” and, secondly, the difficulty of producing tobacco
with a good burning aroma. Other factors are the determination of soil and climate best suited for tobacco culture,
labour UCtl ° n & tobaGC ° ° f lgbt colour > for whlcb there is a popular demand, and the problem of securing trained
Appointment of Federal Director.
14. The first task of the Executive Committee was to secure an experienced director
and advertisements were inserted in British, American, Canadian and South African newspapers
offering a remuneration of from £1,500 to £2,000 a year for three years with travelling allowances.
Mr. C. M. Slagg, M.Sc., formerly chief of the Tobacco Division of the Canadian Department of
Agriculture, and with wide experience in the United States of America, was selected from a large
number of applicants. According to Dr. Cameron, Sir George Julius and Mr. Gepp, no promise
was made to Mr. Slagg that his appointment would be continued beyond the three years of the
engagement, but it was admitted that he was given to understand he would very likely receive
an extension in the event of the continuance of the investigation work. Mr. Slagg arrived in
Australia in March, 1928, and immediately commenced his duties. Previously the Executive
Committee had authorized a survey party, consisting of Messrs C. J. Tregenna, Temple A. J. Smith,
R. VV. Howell and E P. Bambndge, to visit the existing tobacco areas, and any other areas,
tor the purpose of collecting data which could be placed at the disposal of the newly appointed
director upon his arrival. This information was given to Mr. Slagg, who used it as a starting

Work of the Federal Investigation.
15. Mr. Slagg has visited existing centres and delivered addresses to the growers. Early in
1930, he issued his first official bulletin, giving the detailed results of his experiments and tests in
regard to the growing and curing of many varieties of tobacco, with soil analysis, and conditions
of growing. He also gave the results of smoking tests.
At the first public meeting of the Select Committee, Dr. Rivett, on behalf of the
Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, presented a Progress Report to
January, 1930—a lengthy document setting out in detail the work accomplished and then in
hand. This report is published in full in the Minutes of Evidence of the Committee.
The Committee is of opinion that the first three years of the Federal investigation have
been productive of good results, which may lead to better results later ; but it is satisfied that
the cost of the limited amount of experimental work has been excessive. Possibly this is due
to the initial difficulties to be overcome. One obvious reason, however, is the generosity of the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, which has contributed its promised quota in a ready
manner, without requiring any report upon the manner and method of the expenditure. The
Company informed the Committee that its motive in adopting this attitude was to dissipate any
suspicion that might be in the minds of the growers and other interested parties that it (the
Company) desired to dominate the investigation work, and direct it into certain channels.
Participation of British-Australasian Tobacco Company.
16. After hearing the evidence of the company, the members of the Tobacco Investigation
Executive, and many tobacco-growers, the Committee is satisfied that the Company, which
has contributed towards the investigation up to the present time, was justified in not interfering
with the policy of the executive and the work of the executive’s officers ; also that it genuinely
desired to see its money well and wisely expended in the improvement of Australian tobacco-
growing. The majority of the Committee, however, considers that as the industry is productive
of so much revenue for the Commonwealth, it should be taken under the wing of the Federal
Government as a permanent responsibility, without any dependence upon the generosity of
manufacturers or others for the continuance of necessary scientific and experimental work.
While suggesting that the expense of this investigation work should be borne as a matter of
necessity by the Commonwealth Government, the Committee considers that the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company is deserving of special commendation for its gift of such a large
sum of money in this direction. If the Company is desirous of further participating in the
investigational work, its offer should be welcomed by the Government; but at the same time,
it should be made clear that any other manufacturer or interest is open to make a contribution
to the funds required for research and experimental work in connexion with this industry.
Possibly, it would be advisable for the Government to establish a fund for the exclusive purpose
of scientific and field work in directions specially desired by the manufacturers. This fund
could be earmarked for that purpose, and thus be prevented from being merged into general
administrative funds used for Federal direction of the tobacco-growing industry.
FUTURE FEDERAL CONTROL.
17. The Committee considers that if Australian tobacco-growing is to develop into a
big national industry, embracing all the States, it is necessary that there should be permanent
and strong central direction of scientific and experimental work. The foundation of this work
has been laid by the Federal Tobacco Investigation Executive, which is now ceasing to function.
The form of new control submitted by Mr. Gepp provided for the appointment of a consultative
committee consisting of Dr. Rivett, representing the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research ; Mr. Gunn, representing the Development Branch of the Prime Minister’s Department,
with himself (Mr, Gepp) as chairman. It was proposed that scientific questions and small scale
field work associated therewith should be handled by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research and that the large scale field work should be placed under the Development Branch.
This proposal does not appeal to the Committee, for the reason that it removes the real control
and the responsibility from the proper officer, who is the salaried Federal Director. There appears
to be no advantage in establishing such a consultative committee of three members, all of whom
have other important duties to occupy their attention and none of whom can act in this particular
direction other than as an intermediary. To set up this outside authority over the responsible
officers, whose very reputations are dependent upon the proper fulfilment of their duties, is in
the opinion of the Committee to court overlapping and confusion. It will certainlv tend to
deprive the Federal Director of a proper sense of responsibility, and may lead him "to regard
himself as a subordinate and inferior authority, with no power of direction or initiation.


It is necessary also that the overhead expenses of the new tobacco control should be cut
down to the minimum compatible with efficiency. To continue the policy of having many
directional heads, all of whom are actively associated with other duties, means, in the Committee’s
opinion, to perpetuate the distrust which has existed in the minds of the growers. The industry
is at present in its infantile stages, and therefore does not require a heavy central directorate.
All it needs is proper departmental control in regard to expenditure upon scientific and field
work, under an easily accessible Minister, to whom the Federal Director should be alone
responsible for the proper fulfilment of his duties.
Considering the large salary being paid to the Director, and the comparatively small
assisting staff required for his purposes at present and for some time to come, the Committee
is convinced that the best results will accrue to the industry, as well as to the Federal Government,
if a responsible Director is appointed to a permanent position, with only the ordinary departmental
conditions of employment. He should be guaranteed freedom from all interference except
through the Minister. This will simplify the whole procedure, invest the position of Director
with more status, and bring the actual directional officer of the Federal Tobacco Department
in personal contact with the growers. He will also be able to discuss with the manufacturers
matters relating to the disposal of each year’s crop ; and in necessary cases he can assist in the
settlement of differences between the buyer and seller.
18. The Committee thinks that the new system of control should be at least as permanent
and efficient as that existing in the United States and Canada, in both of which countries there
are Federal Departments under a director. The scope of these Departments is indicated in the
following evidence given by Mr. Slagg :
131. If a federal department of tobacco were established with a permanent director, do you think it would
still be necessary for the States to maintain their present departments, some of whom might be hostile to the federal
works?— That would be necessary only in those States where tobacco production is a commercial enterprise of value
to those States, and that matter should be left to the various States.
132. Suppose the States abolished their present departments and handed the whole matter over to the
Commonwealth, do you think the interests of the industry could be safeguarded more economically than at present? —
On my experience of agricultural experimental work in Canada and the United States of America I should say that the
States should have men to make direct contact with the growers in all cases where those States have a commercial
going activity, and that the federal body should be concerned with problems that transcend State matters.
133. Can you make it clear just what work should be left to the State?—My attitude is based on experience
as a representative of the Federal Governments of the United States and Canada in carrying out experimental work
on tobacco in co-operation with the different States and provinces. Naturally, the work is not done in an exactly
similar manner in both countries. In the United States of America, the situation is somewhat different from that in
Canada, because in addition to the Federal Department of Agriculture, which is a very large efficient organization,
there are also some large State agricultural experimental stations, generally conducted in connexion with State
universities. The relationship between the Federal Department and the State institutions is quite cordial. The
Federal Department recognizes that certain types of work must be carried out in the district where the problems are
to be met. In that case a federal officer is detailed to work with a State agricultural experimental station. The usual
procedure there is for the Federal Government to pay the salary of the man who is definitely on the staff of the Federal
department, and to pay all his travelling expenses. The agricultural experimental station furnishes him with laboratory
and offices, land, labour, and equipment, and anything he wishes within the limits of its organization. It is supposed
to be a half and half arrangement, so far as expenses are concerned. The results are usually published co-operatively,
though they may be published by both parties, together with a statement that the work has been carried out
co-operatively. lam now referring to agricultural experimentation in general. In Canada the situation is somewhat
different, in that under the British-North American Act the agricultural experimental work is largely left to the federal
organization. There is a strong Federal Department of Agriculture which has done a great deal of excellent work,
and it has a series of branch experimental stations scattered throughout the dominion. At Ottawa, where the
headquarters are located, there is a staff composed of a number of divisions, and the heads of these divisions are
responsible for the work done at the branch stations. The expense is borne wholly by the Federal Department.
Agricultural experimental stations are also carried on in connexion with the agricultural colleges in the different
provinces, but they are by no means as extensive as those in the United States of America.
134. In America and Canada, which authority would control the type of work you are now doing?— The federal
authorities, in co-operation with the States.
5571. Have they a Federal Control Board in Canada?— They have a tobacco division of the Dominion Department
of Agriculture.
5572. Is it purely a federal concern? —Yes.
5573. Is there any form of provincial control?— The States are practically doing no work in this connexion;
it is all done by the Federal Department. In the United States, however, there is a Federal Department of Agriculture
in conjunction with which the States are performing certain work.
5574. What are the functions of the Federal Department in the United States of America?— The tobacco work
in the United States of America Department of Agriculture, is carried out mainly by the Tobacco Investigation Branch.
5575. What is the extent of these departments both in Canada and in the United States of America?—ln Canada
the tobacco division has its headquarters, office, laboratory and greenhouses at Ottawa.
5576. Is there a Federal Director?— They have a chief of the Tobacco Division.
5577. What are his duties? —Generally to supervise the tobacco work of the Department of Agriculture for the
Dominion.


5578. Has he control of all experimental work?—-Yes, in connexion with tobacco.
5579. Including field and scientific work? —Yes, there are pathologists and chemists attached to the division
as well as several practical men. The total technical staff during the past ten years has consisted roughly of about
half a dozen officers. In addition there are field superintendents and field workers as well as a secretary to the division
and the necessary clerical staff.
5580. What does the department consist of in the United States of America? —There is a senior physiologist
in charge of the tobacco investigation, and under him there are three or four assistant physiologists as well as two or
three pathologists and assistant pathologists and others, whom they term field technologists, and a number of technical
assistants.
5581. What would be the total number of staff? —I have not the register with me, but I should say that the
total staff, including the clerical branch of the tobacco investigation, would probably be twenty.
5582. What are the functions of the director? —The physiologist in charge controls all the tobacco work carried
out under the auspices of the Federal Department of Agriculture. In addition he consults with the States officers
who may be undertaking tobacco investigation work in the various States. In the tobacco States a good deal of the
field experimental work and some of the laboratory experimental work is carried out in co-operation with the federal
office. For instance, at the laboratory at which I commenced my tobacco work there was co-operation between the
office of the Federal Tobacco Investigations and the College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin. That university
furnished the laboratory facilities, office staff and casual labour, such as that required for work in the glass or green
houses and in the fields, and the Federal Department of Agriculture placed the technical men of their staff in that
laboratory.
5583. How long has the federal department been established in the United States of America? —-The office of
the Tobacco Investigation as such has been established for approximately 25 years, and before that the work was attached
to the bureau of soils, and was carried out under its auspices for probably fifteen or twenty years.
5584. What is the position in Canada? —The present tobacco division dates back to 1905.
19. In a few years this Federal Department will probably become the most vital factor
in the economic stability of the tobacco-growing industry. As the greatest potential primary
producing revenue-maker for the Commonwealth, the industry cannot be too carefully fostered.
Future Position of Mr. Slagg.
20. So far as Mr. Slagg is concerned, the Committee considers that he has not had time
to fully demonstrate his abilities and his experience ; also that he has not been given sufficient
immunity from outside direction. He has apparently been under the impression that his position
was extremely uncertain, and that its continuance was largely dependent upon the approval
of a number of interests, manufacturing as well as growing. He has also been subject to
the criticism of various State experts, and at least one member of the Tobacco Investigation
Executive.
The Committee recommends that Mr. Slagg be offered the position of Federal Director
with full charge of his department, at a salary and upon conditions to be determined by the
Government.
If this plan is adopted, there will be no need for the additional form of control suggested
by Mr. Gepp. In any case, this Committee does not see any particular merit in that form of
control, and is totally against its acceptance.
Advisory Council for Growers.
21. The Federal Director could be assisted very materially by an Advisory Council of
growers. Under the form of control proposed by Mr. Gepp it would be impossible to have growers’
representation, as there would be no effective way in which such representation could function.
With the Federal Director as Chairman, an Advisory Council, consisting of not more than two
growers from each tobacco-growing State chosen from the organizations therein, could quite easily
function by the holding of meetings at some central place, preferably Canberra,two or three times a
year; and in view of the keen interest being taken by certain States and their offer to continue,
provided a Federal organization exists, the Committee thinks it desirable and necessary that the
Director of Agriculture in each tobacco-growing State should be ex-officio a member of such Advisory
Council. The expenses of these meetings, at rates to be fixed by the Minister, should be paid to
each grower’s delegate, thus relieving the growers’ associations of this item of expenditure. The
meetings should be summoned by thqggFederal Director, but provision should be made for special
meetings to be summoned with the approval of the Minister, on a request by a majority of the
growers’ representatives on the Council. The Advisory Council could discuss with the Director
the progress of investigations, give advice to the Director, and issue a written report after each
meeting to the Minister. In this way a form of representation satisfactory to the growers, and
helpful to the Director, would be set up at inconsiderable cost to the department.
The Committee has given consideration to the question of having representation of
manufacturers on the Advisory Council, and is of opinion that the Council should be given freedom
to invite to any of its meetings representatives of any manufacturing interest for the purposes
of consultation on matters affecting the industry.


Headquarters at Canberra ; and Organization.
22. The Committee considers that the tobacco investigations headquarters should be
transferred as soon as possible to Canberra, where the Director should reside. This move would
give the Department definite status, and bring it closer in touch with New South Wales and
Queensland, while leaving it handy to Victoria.
23. The Committee contemplates in its proposal that the scientific work concerning tobacco
being conducted at the Canberra laboratories shall be under the direction of the Tobacco
Department, and therefore subject to the authority of the Federal Director, who should be the
most competent person to decide in which direction the scientific work should from time to time
be carried. Provided there is adequate co-operation there appears to be no reason for placing
any officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in sole charge of this phase of
the Tobacco Department’s activities. After all, the whole work of investigation is essentially
a tobacco expert’s task, and he should be the best judge of what is required from the laboratories.
Field research should also be under the direction of the Federal expert. Directly under the
control of the Director should be established a corps of field instructors —six or twelve—men
capable by experience and training of advising and instructing growers in all departments of
the industry appertaining to production, and capable of creating the necessary liaison between
the scientific research staff on the one hand and the manufacturing interests on the other. Such
a corps of officers should be able, under the direction of Mr. Slagg, to plan and supervise operations
in the States where tobacco-growing can be successfully operated, to indicate definitely where
tobacco-growing has been found impracticable or economically unsound and have it eliminated,
and thus enable policy and expenditure to be concentrated on areas showing the best cultural
prospects.
24. The Committee believes that this form of control will be much more satisfactory
to everybody than any form which invests numerous authorities with the power to over-ride
and hamper the policy of the one man who is being paid to make a success of the tobacco-growing
industry in Australia.
WORK OF THE STATES.
25. Until the Federal Tobacco Investigation Executive was established in 1927 various
States were the sole directors of tobacco-growing in Australia. The principal efforts were being
made in New South Wales and Victoria, where for the last twenty years or more tobacco experts
have been employed to assist growers. Neither State had built up a strong department, the
work devolving almost wholly on the expert and one or two field assistants. The Under-
secretaries for Agriculture have been content to leave the tobacco industry in the hands of the
experts ; though in Victoria Dr. Cameron, Director of Agriculture, has shown for many years
a definite personal interest, which has taken a strong lean towards the growers. He has known
their difficulties, and has done everything in his power to keep his tobacco staff up to the task.
In this he has been faithfully aided by Mr. Temple Smith, State Tobacco Expert, who some
years ago was sent to the United States to study the industry with a view to improving the methods
of cultivation and curing in Victoria.
26. In New South Wales the work has been under the control of Mr. C. J. Tregenna, State
Tobacco Expert, who has held the office for the last fifteen years. Until a few years
Mr. Tregenna seemed to have every faith in the future of the industry in New South Wales!
He then appeared to develop the opinion that the growers in New South Wales were making
no improvement. This idea, which he seems to have ventilated freely in the Tamworth, Manilla
and Texas districts brought him into conflict with many growers, and finally aroused a definite
feeling of hostility towards him. The feeling became so acute as to impel the president of the
northern growers, Mr. W. Considine Parkes, to wait upon the Under-Secretary (Mr. Ross) in Sydney
and complain of Mr. Tregenna’s attitude. Mr. Tregenna persisted in his opinion, and up to the
time of his appearance before this Committee as a witnessed not become any more favorable
towards the prospects of tobacco-growing in his own State, ot even in Victoria, with the exception
of Pomonal. He was most definite as the following references in his evidence show :
1299. Would you be prepared to smoke cigarettes made half of Australian and half of American leaf?-—lf the
Australian leaf came from Stawell, in Victoria, or North Queensland, a 50-50 mixture with American tobacco would
give a satisfactory cigarette. The position would be quite different if tobacco grown in Tamworth, Manilla or Tumut
were used.
1300. What about Wangaratta?—Anything I smoked from Wangaratta has not been good.
1359. What is your opinion of North Queensland as a tobacco-growing area?—lt is the only place in Australia
that I have visited which I think will produce high-grade tobacco. I think that we can grow there tobacco which
will displace much of the American product now imported.


2467. By Mr. Jones. —ln spite of this report will you agree with Mr. Gepp when he says that he holds the opinion
that Australia can and will supply all the tobacco that Australia requires?—lt cannot be done from New South Wales
or Victoria ; but it can be done from Queensland. That remains true unless and until the public taste changes back
to the old dark tobacco.
2469. Do you rule Victoria out as not being able to supply the tobacco required? —With the exception of Pomonal,
I would rule out Victoria and the whole of New South Wales.
The Committee, having heard the evidence of many growers at Tamworth, Manilla, Texas
and Tumut, is of opinion that Mr. Tregenna’s lack of enthusiasm proved discouraging to many
of them. That he was adopting an incomprehensible attitude towards the growers under his
care is evidenced by the fact that in spite of his pessimistic viewpoint, the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company’s buyer, Mr. Lough, visited the Tamworth, Manilla, Texas and Tumut
districts each year and purchased all the available bright leaf, as well as most of the dark leaf,
without any reference to the bad burning aroma which Mr. Tregenna had persistently alleged
was the fundamental fault with the leaf from these districts, rendering it unacceptable to the
manufacturer. Mr. Tregenna also made insufficient allowance for the steady improvement
in growing and curing shown by numbers of growers in the northern areas; in fact, when giving
evidence before the Committee, he appeared to be in ignorance of what many of these growers
were producing. He did not even know the number of growers in New South Wales, and referred
the Committee for this information to the Customs Department.
Mr. Tregenna’s opinion of the unfavorable future before the tobacco industry in Victoria
and New South Wales cannot be endorsed by the majority of this Committee. His evidence
on this point was not supported by other expert witnesses, including the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company’s buyer, Mr. Lough, who admitted that there had been a marked improvement-
in both these States, both as regards colour and quality. While not insisting that it was as
good as the average American leaf, Mr. Lough in no way supported the view of Mr. Tregenna
that the leaf now being produced in larger quantities by the growers of Victoria and New South
Wales was not the kind required by the manufacturers. This is indicated by the following
extracts from Mr. Lough’s evidence :
1196. Do you agree with the statement made by growers at Wangaratta that they can now produce 60 per cent,
of bright leaf? —Before they can produce that proportion of bright leaf they will have to change their methods. Ido
not think that, on the average, they are producing that proportion of bright leaf. Some growers produce as much as
80 per cent, of bright leaf. That has been done at Tamworth and in some Victorian districts. From one farm at
Tamworth I bought 41 bales of bright leaf, and 34 bales of mahogany. Of those 34 bales of mahogany, 29 bales
were high-grade. There was no dark leaf at all. I attribute those results to intelligent culture.
1197. Does that not indicate that growers who work on proper lines will get satisfactory results?— Yes,
particularly if they pay due regard to colour and grading.
1198, You consider that intelligence on the part of the grower is an important factor as well as soil, climate
and quality of seed?— Yes, it is most important.
1199. On what type of soil in the Tamworth district were those results obtained?—On rather heavy soil on
which tobacco had been grown for some years.
27. In. other States, very little departmental work has been done for many years. In
Queensland, except for some supervision over early Texas growers, and assistance to cigar-leaf
growers in North Queensland, practically no tobacco direction has existed since about 1915,
when the State tobacco expert, Mr. Neville, returned to America. The Director of Agriculture,
Mr. Quodling, however, informed the Committee that if the Federal investigation work was to
continue he would recommend his Government to take a more active part in the industry. He
would even try to secure an expert, and in any case would render active assistance to the Federal
authority. Mr. Boss, Under-Secretary for Agriculture in New South Wales, also favored the
continuance of the Federal investigation work, but said he would probably not recommend the
appointment of another expert as a purely State responsibility. He would, however, be prepared
to employ field officers to give advice to growers.
28. In South Australia, Professor Perkins, Director of Agriculture, admitted that there
had been little or no tobacco direction, mainly for lack of growers. Now that the Commonwealth
had taken up the industry, he would be only too willing to recommend his Government to take
an active interest.
29. Making every allowance for the good work that certain States have done in the
encouragement of tobacco-growing the Committee is unable to see any prospect of State success
without permanent Commonwealth direction. The industry is essentially Federal in character,
consequently it seems unwise and almost unreasonable to expect the States to assume all the
responsibility. The wonder is that the States, which have only indirectly derived financial
benefit, have spent so much money without inviting the Commonwealth to share the burden.


The States have not made any serious effort to place the industry on a statistical basis,
the result being that the Directors of Agriculture and even the experts have not had the actual
figures year in and year out. The Committee had to obtain all definite information as to the
number of growers, the acreage and the value of production from the Department of Trade and
Customs.
The expenditure of each State over a period of years indicates clearly the efforts made to
develop the industry in Australia
New South Wales . . Since 1921-22, an average of £1,199 per annum.
Victoria . . . . Since 1919-20, an average of £1,847 per annum.
Queensland . . . . Figures not available.
South Australia .. . . Since 1920-21. an average of £2IG per annum.
Western Australia .. Average annual expenditure from 1923 to 1926, £3l
per annum (exclusive of supervision—the cost of
which was not supplied to the Committee).
30. Dr. Cameron, Victoria, suggested to the Committee that the work of tobacco direction
could best be done by the States as indicated in his evidence :
3836. Until the Commonwealth, investigational work commenced three years ago, was any attempt made to
co-ordinate the work done by the States who were interested in tobacco-growing?—l do not understand what you
mean by co-ordination.
3837. To exercise a federal supervision over the work. Tobacco-growing is not essentially a State industry
but is common to the whole of Australia. The Commonwealth Government introduced federal supervision of field
work in order to spread it over the whole continent? —I do not see that there is any necessity for co-ordination in the
sense in which you refer to it, or in the sense that you consider that an attempt has been made in the last three years.
No co-ordination of that kind is required in connexion with any other successful staple primary industry ; each State
has its own separate organization, and they are not overlooked by a federal officer with a staff in an attempt to co-ordinate
the work.
3838. The reason that the Commonwealth Government intervened in this industry was that economically its
is a Federal and not a State industry, because 90 per cent, of our tobacco is imported, and the Commonwealth derives
a revenue of £7,000,000 a year from it; so that you cannot possibly compare tobacco with such industries as, say,
wheat or fruit, from which the Commonwealth derives no import or excise revenue?— Assuming that during the last
few years the idea has been to co-ordinate the work or to control the State work, I say deliberately that it has utterly
failed. It has neither co-ordinated the work nor brought about an improvement in the State work To a large extent
the federal organization has had the advantage of. and been educated by, State staff knowledge and experience.
The Committee appreciates the value of the work done by Dr. Cameron for the Victorian
tobacco-growers, but is unable to accept his opinion as to the value of State work generally.
After 40 years or more, the States have failed, even in Victoria and New South Wales, to develop
the industry up to an Australian standard. No doubt the great difficulty has been the inability
of the States to deal with the major problem of protection by means of the tariff ; but before
Federation no successful attempt had been made by any State to force the industry to develop
by this or any other method.
31. The Committee feels that the tobacco-growing States are willing to help the industry
for the sake of the whole nation, and therefore suggests that the Federal Tobacco Department
should formulate a scheme which will bring the States in to help in the way favored by various
Directors of Agriculture.
ALLEGED DEFECTS IN AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO.
32. The Committee thoroughly investigated the suggestions that have been made that
there is a fundamental fault in Australian tobacco directly responsible for a bad burning aroma.
Such aroma, we are told, is entirely absent from American tobacco ; hence the preference of the
Australian public for the American leaf.
A great deal of evidence was taken on this question, and while there were many differences
of opinion, the Committee failed to secure any reliable evidence that a definite fundamental
fault, such as an objectionable burning aroma, which could be classed as characteristically
Australian, existed in any of our tobacco, except perhaps in the inferior and rubbishy grades
of dark leaf most of which is cured in a green condition. The evidence was so contradictory
on this point as. to justify the Committee in summing up the whole question as largely a matter
of individual taste. The Committee is satisfied, however, that the various brands of Australian
tobacco placed on the market by manufacturers now and in years gone by, have not possessed
an inherent and objectionable aroma unacceptable to the Australian smoker. It is probable
that some of these brands burn the tongue, and are not agreeable to every smoker ; but the
same results are obtained from various American brands sold at higher prices. Every witness
who had tried Australian brands found some merit, and none who had tried only American brands
would say that he found them satisfactory in every direction.


It was indicated clearly in evidence that Australian brands of pipe tobacco—cigarettes
have not been attempted except on a small scale and chiefly in Western Australia—have had
a ready sale when brought under the notice of the public by judicious advertising. Some brands
decline in popularity more quickly than others. When it is considered, however, that fully
90 per cent, of the advertising is to popularize mainly imported tobaccos, it is impossible to
gauge the extent of the potential public demand for well-manufactured local tobaccos. Some
of the tobaccos turned out by Australian manufacturers either composite or 100 per cent.
Australian, are quite acceptable to large numbers of smokers. This is proved by the steady
sales secured without extensive advertising.
33. Price is the most important factor in the marketing of manufactured tobacco. It
is true that utterly bad tobacco, which has a noxious effect, would not sell readily at any price,
but no manufacturer would knowingly market tobacco of an unsmokable character. In the final
issue the smoker would decide on two factors —quality and price.
The majority of the tobaccos sold by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company are now
fairly high-priced, ranging from Is. 3d. to Is. lOd. a 2 oz. tin, while cigarettes vary from
“ Capstans ” eleven in a packet for 6d., to ££ Country Life ”23in a tin for Is. 6d. No Australian
brands of tobacco or cigarettes are on the market at a margin which would tempt a finicky smoker.
If the prices were much lower than those for the imported brands, and the fact were properly
advertised, the Committee has little doubt that the demand for the local tobacco —even if such
tobacco were not wholly up to the American standard —would speedily improve, thus creating
a more solid foundation for the local growing industry.
Alleged Eucalyptus Aroma.
34. The Committee heard a good deal of evidence in regard to certain statements made
during the past three years that the alleged fundamental defect in Australian tobacco had at
last been traced to the influence of eucalyptus. The principal witness on this matter was Dr.
Darnell-Smith, Director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney, and a member of the Federal Tobacco
Investigation Executive. In 1927 Dr. Darnell-Smith, at the instigation of the Federal
Investigation Executive, visited the tobacco-growing States in America, and on his return issued
a bulletin entitled ££ Report on a tour through the South-Eastern Atlantic States of U.S.A., with
particular reference to the production of bright flue-cured tobacco.” This report dealt
extensively with certain opinions held by Dr. Darnell-Smith regarding defects in Australian
tobacco ; but the Federal Investigation Executive Committee, holding the view that further
work on the points raised in the report was necessary before making public statements, withheld
this portion of the report from publication. Dr. Darnell-Smith’s report, therefore, as finally
issued dealt only with the production of tobacco in America.
35. It appears that in 1927 the British-Australasian Tobacco Company brought from
America a tobacco expert, Mr. H. A. McGee, on a three-year engagement, at a high salary, to
conduct experiments and report on the Australian tobacco-growing industry. Mr. McGee became
associated with Dr. Darnell-Smith and Mr. Tregenna. When the Federal Tobacco Investigation
was commenced in 1927, the experiments being conducted by Mr. McGee were handed over to the
Federal authority, and towards the end of 1928 Mr. Gee left for America. He seems to have
been disappointed in the results of his experimental work.
About the middle of 1928, however, reports began to appear in various Australian
newspapers that the outcome of the experiments conducted by Mr, McGee, Mr. Tregenna and
Dr. Darnell-Smith had been to prove that phellandrene oil, contained in eucalyptus dives and
eucalyptus blalcelyi, the two most prevalent types of vegetation found in the existing tobacco-
growing areas, was responsible for the alleged fundamental defect, namely, the bad smoking
aroma of Australian tobacco. These reports declared that if the industry were to progress, new
growing areas free from these two varieties of eucalypts would have to be located. It was
also, that one such area had been found in North Queensland, in the district of Mareeba,
near Cairns.
A controversy followed this publicity, and action was taken by various growers’
organizations to secure confirmation. In response to requests for information as to the attitude
of the Federal Investigation Executive, Mr. Gepp, the Chairman, issued a press statement to
the effect that the eucalyptus theory should not be accepted, as it had not been proved ; and
that no one had the authority of the Federal Executive for making any information public. It
appears that a copy of a confidential report submitted in May, 1928, to the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, and signed by Messrs. McGee, Tregenna and Dr. Darnell-Smith was furnished
to the Federal Executive. The Executive refused to publish the report, the reason being explained
by Mr. Gepp in his evidence as follows : —(Q. 1140) ££ The Australian Tobacco Investigation
considering the case had not been proved refused to publish the report ”.


36. The Committee had evidence in Brisbane from Mr. N. A. E. Pollock, Instructor in
Agriculture in North Queensland, to the effect that m 1927 he met Messrs, Tregenna and McGee,
who were members of a survey party appointed by the Federal Tobacco Investigation Executive.
They told him they were looking for suitable tobacco land, and he took them to Mareeba, which
he considered had the requisite rainfall and the poor sandy soil described by these two visitors
as essential requirements for light bright tobacco. Other areas were visited, but only Mareeba
was viewed favorably by Messrs. McGee and Tregenna. Mr. Pollock said that on this occasion
the two experts told him of their experiments in regard to the eucalyptus theory, and he
subsequently made a public statement, which appeared in the North Queensland Register of
Townsville of 11th June, 1928. In this statement Mr. Pollock said, inter alia :
“ Working on these lines, Mr. Tregenna has advanced a most attractive theory, namely, that the influence of
certain species of eucalyptus notably eucalyptus dives, which yield an oil containing phellandrene, growing on the soil
for thousands of years is responsible for the peculiar and objectionable aroma of southern-grown tobacco. Though
a great many species of the eucalyptus gums yield oil, the composition of such oil differs, that only from certain species
containing phellandrene/ ’
From this unauthorized publicity seems to have arisen the discussion which later appeared
in various other newspapers all over Australia.
37. In his evidence in Sydney, Dr. Darnell-Smith explained the Bathurst experiments
in regard to eucalyptus as follows :
876. By the Chairman. —You said that the results of the investigation in relation to eucalyptus taint are
available. Have you any knowledge of the existence of the report ? —Yes.
877. Were you in charge of the experiments dealing with eucalyptus leaves ?—No. We decided to compare
the results of seed grown in American and Australian soils. Mr. McGee, a highly qualified tobacco expert who was
brought from America by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, agreed with the idea. The company brought
out 9 tons of American soil from a typical tobacco-growing area. The soil was carefully taken off 2| inches at a time
so that it could be put into pits exactly as it came from America. The State of New South Wales afforded facilities
at Bathurst for the tests. The expenses were borne by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. A decision as to
what should be done was made after discussion by Mr, McGee, Mr. Tregenna and myself. At the beginning of the
next year the same three were in charge of the operations ; but before the year ended the Australian Tobacco
Investigation was inaugurated. That body then became responsible for the experiments. I took a lively interest
in the matter ; but the control passed from one authority to another. At the end of that year—l92B—some adverse
comments were made about the conduct of the experiments. By that time Mr. Slagg had been appointed. In
explaining the position to him I said that I wanted the experiments to be continued ; but that I did not want to have
control of them. From the end of 1928 to the present time Mr. Slagg has been in charge of the investigations.
878. You were in charge of the experiments for one year ?—I was not in charge ; Mr. McGee was. I handed
over to Mr. Slagg because Mr. McGee had gone to America.
879. Did Mr. McGee start his soil experiments in 1926 ?—Yes.
880. Did you and Mr. Tregenna collaborate with him ? —Yes.
881. In the following year, as the result of a theory advanced by Mr. McGee, you all collaborated in the
vegetation test ?—I would not say that the theory was put forward by Mr. McGee.
882. Was it put forward by Mr. Tregenna ?—No. The three of us discussed the matter, and our experiments
showed that soils produced different results. We then sought the explanation.
883. Was that the first time that the theory about eucalyptus taint in tobacco was advanced ? —Yes, so far
as my knowledge goes.
884. In the Progress Report of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, you refer to the residual effects of fresh
eucalyptus leaves added to river sand. What do you mean by the residual effect ?—ln 1927, into a pit filled with
sand, we dug a number of fresh eucalyptus leaves. The tobacco grown in that pit was tested at the end of the season.
It had a distinctly disagreeable aroma. The next year we decided to leave the soil as it was ;we put no fresh eucalyptus
leaves into the soil. At the end of the second year the tobacco grown in the soil had a good aroma.
885. If the theory regarding the eucalyptus taint is valid, is it not just as likely that, in the course of time
the addition of eucalyptus leaves to the soil would improve the aroma of tobacco ?—lf you were dealing with sand,
that theory would be justified.
886. Would we be justified in saying that, far from being a fatal defect, the presence of eucalyptus in the soi,
might improve the quality of tobacco ? —I think that would be going a bit too far. In our tests we used river sandl
At the end of the first year the aroma of the tobacco was bad, and at the end of the second year it had improved.
887. Would that improvement be due to the greater maturity of the volatile oils in the soil ? —lt might be.,
Bandy soil into which a quantity of stable manure is dug gives wonderful results for six months. In such soil stable
manure gives hardly any residual effect, whereas in heavy soil its effect is much more lasting. lam not prepared to
say that, because we obtained certain results with sand, we should get similar results with heavy soil.
888. If you had continued the experiments for a further year do you think you would have got still better
results ?—The experiments are still going on. A further year will not have passed until March, 1930.
889. Would we be justified in saying that paragraph 7 of the summary on page 56 of the Progress Report,
relating to the residual effects of eucalyptus leaves, largely nullifies the conclusions reached in paragraphs 5 and 6 ?
—I would not say that it nullifies them, but that it renders the conclusions arrived at in paragraphs 5 and 6 rather
abortive. In all experiments the experimenter must keep on until he gets something definite. In this case the results
at the end of the second year were different from those of the first.
On the evidence of Dr. Darnell-Smith, it looks as if a heavy infectation of the experimental
soil with eucalyptus mulch —pulverized leaves —would produce a definite eucalyptus taste in
Australian tobacco grown at the end of the first season ; but at the end of the second season,
after there had been no further addition of eucalyptus mulch to the soil, the taste would be less


pronounced, and the burning aroma of the tobacco would be pleasant. This is the effect of Dr
Darnell-Simth s version. What would happen in the third year, after there had been no further
addition of mulch, has not been demonstrated.
38. The Committee secured the opinions of other witnesses on this theory, and their views
are interesting.
• x Cameron 3884 Do you not think that the eucalyptus theory was a legitimate one, and that in the
interests of the industry, it ought to have been tried out ?-I do not think it was a legitimate theory. The moment
1 a i r( xT Of “7 mind J lzl flized our butter, our wines, and other products that grow on eucalyptus soils, or soils upon
which the eucalyptus has been the only vegetation for aeons.
Professor Perkins—-5300.—1s it at all feasible to argue that, because of the eucalyptus vegetation in Australia
tobacco grown m such soil must be tainted with a eucalyptus odour?-! should not care to express an opinion unless
1 saw the whole of the results and knew who carried out the tests. I cannot see how it could happen. I cannot give
an oft-hand reply. 6
5301. Do you think that far from eucalyptus having a deleterious effect on the aroma it would be more likelv to
have an improving effect?—l would not argue the matter. Why is there no taste of eucalyptus in our rhubarb and
cabbages? Why should this supposed taint be confined to tobacco?
39. The Committee is inclined to the view that the theory originated with Dr. Darnell-
Smith, and is confirmed by the following extract from his evidence :
Q. 865. “ I believe it was I who suggested that eucalyptus might be the cause of the aroma in Australian
tobacco.
40. In view of the demand of the manufacturers for much larger quantities of bright
Australian leaf from all existing tobacco-growing areas, there does not seem to be any value
in these eucalyptus experiments, wdiich up to the present have been quite inconclusive. All
that has been suggested is that an unpleasant aroma can be added to tobacco when soil is heavily
impregnated with eucalyptus leaves. This seems a futile form of experimentation. No data
has been furnished to show that the soil used by tobacco-growers has a natural eucalyptus
impregnation, or if so, to an extent which could possibly produce a traceable eucalyptus aroma.
The Committee is assisted in forming this opimon by the evidence of Dr. Cameron and Professor
Perkins, and also by the definite view of the Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation in the evidence of its Chairman (Mr. Gepp) :
5875. It was as impossible then as it is now for the executive committee to state that there is, or is not a
eucalyptus taint in Australian tobacco, and substantiate the statement with scientific data. It does not for one moment
believe there is such a taint, and in that is at one with others who have given evidence; but the investigation is essentially
a fact-finding institution, and as such must of necessity conduct its inquiries and make its announcements upon a basis
of scientific inquiry. 1
The Committee is satisfied that there is no fundamental fault which has so far been
demonstrated in conclusive fashion by any authorities that have been investigating. Even
he smoking tests carried out from time to time with raw and unmatured leaf chopped into
cigarettes do not appear to afford reliable data.
Opinion of the Factory Workers.
41. A written statement was submitted to the Committee in Sydney by Mr. J. H. Walker
Federal Secretary of the Federated Tobacco Workers Union of Australasia, and formerly an
employee of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. This organization embraces about 5 000
tobacco workers, women included, and as the British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s employees
number 5,300 it is likely that the great majority of these members of the union are Conipany’s
employees. r v
The evidence of Mr. Walker was very emphatic in its hostility to x4ustralian-grown leaf
the contention being that owing to the inferiority of this leaf the handling problem was much
more serious than in the case of imported leaf. He estimated that the wages of tobacco workers
handling Australian leaf would be reduced 25 per cent, through the broken nature of the leaf
and the tearing of the leaf during the process of stemming. The stems, also, were heavier and
harder to remove, and generally the leaf was not so easy to work as imported leaf. Mr. Walker
also declared that if the bulk of the leaf handled in the factory were “ domestic ” there would be
a great reduction in the demand amongst smokers, consequently there would be considerable
unemployment amongst tobacco workers. He could give no estimate of the amount of
unemployment the union expected.
42. The Committee also heard evidence from Mr. H. W. Ninnes, a Vice-President of the
Union and an employee of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. This witness was equally
as hostile towards the local leaf as Mr. Walker, and submitted samples of processed Australian
leaf with samples of ibnerican leaf. At first it appeared as if Mr. Ninnes were attacking all
F. 218, —3 8


qualities of local leaf, but in cross-examination be admitted that his remarks were mainly
applicable to the inferior dark leaf, of which there was a heavy carry-over in the factory. The
sample of local leaf submitted by him was clearly the darker and poorer quality, and the Committee
considered that there was no value in the comparison offered by the witness.
43. In regard to Mr, Walker, the Committee considers that his statement was obviously
inspired by the fear that there would be a great falling off in local consumption if Australian
leaf were more freely used in manufacture. This fear the Committee believes to be entirely
groundless, and it is supported in this opinion by the failure of Mr. Walker to go any further
than state that local leaf possessed a bad aroma. The bulk of the evidence submitted to the
Committee does not bear this out, especially in regard to the brighter and lighter varieties of
leaf.
Improving Manufacture of Local Leaf.
44. Considerable evidence was heard on the subject of the manufacturer’s share of
responsibility for the alleged bad reputation of Australian tobacco. The discussion centred
principally round the methods of maturing or ageing prior to manufacture. Interesting evidence
on this point was given by Dr, Cameron, Victorian Director of Agriculture, who in 1927 paid a
visit to America and closely investigated the tobacco-growing industry. On his return he
submitted a valuable report to the Federal Tobacco Investigation Executive. In his evidence
Dr. Cameron said (Q. 330) :
I pointed out in the report that I presented to the Investigation Committee the following facts regarding the
American system: —
After purchase at the warehouse each buyer’s purchases are packed in hogsheads for transport to the “ prizing
house.” During this packing as far as possible similar types and grades of [leaf are packed together. Opportunity
is also taken to exercise a greater refinement in grading the types and qualities than the growers’ lots show.
At the re-ordering or storage warehouses the preparation for storage or ageing mentioned above is carried out.
The prime object of the process originally was apparently to bring about a uniform and standard moisture content
in the tobacco as purchased on the selling floor, which, of course, would vary considerably, and so result in a variable
intensity and effect of the sweating which proceeds when the tobacco is stored in hogsheads during the ageing period.
The Committee referred this aspect to Mr. Bentley, of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company, whose statement is contained in the following extract (Q. 285) :
In the year 1926 the company completed the erection in Melbourne of a large factory of five floors and a basement
costing £78,000. The top floor of this building was specially constructed to take care of the handling and storage of
Australian tobacco leaf, and the most modern machinery installed at a cost of £6,400. A similar plant has been erected
at our Sydney factory, and all requirements in this regard have been met for a considerable expansion in the industry.
Every possible care and attention, irrespective of cost, is given to the redrying, boxing and storage of Australian leaf,
and in these respects we can claim to be well abreast of the methods adopted in other parts of the world.
whilst Mr. Slagg informed the Committee (Q. 5554) that:—
As regards the period of ageing given Australian leaf before taking for manufacture, one firm reported using leaf
after six months ageing, with the average age of leaf used about twelve months, and the maximum period of ageing
two years. Another firm reports that it only uses leaf a year old and older if possible. The third and largest manufac-
turers state that their Australian leaf stocks at present receive an average ageing of four years. They state, however,
that they begin to use the lemon and bright grades, of which there is a shortage, at the end of twelve months.
So far as the Committee has been able to gather, the principal manufacturer in Australia
has been in the habit of keeping large quantities of local leaf, principally the dark qualities, in
storage for from three to four years. The storage has been in large deal packing cases. The
leaf has been unbaled when received from the grower, re-dried and re-packed ; but apparently
not under heavy pressure as is done in America. The Company has not been storing the bright
mahogany classes of leaf, relying upon the period between curing by the grower and purchase
by the Company —approximately six months. This period is held by the Company to be
sufficient for the ageing of the brighter classes of Australian tobacco.
The Committee considers there is every probability that the poorer dark tobacco is not
susceptible to great improvement by ageing. There is no certainty, however, that correct
methods of ageing have been adopted by the manufacturer. The cost of storage is, of course,
very heavy. It means that the crop purchased in one year has to be kept for from two to four
years ; but with adequate supplies coming forward, the loss would be at the beginning.
45. There is not the slightest doubt that, according to the American standard, even the
brightest Australian leaf should be subjected to an ageing process. This difference in the
treatment of the two tobaccoes may have an important bearing on the smoking qualities. It is
evident that much immature Australian tobacco goes into manufacture. Possibly this may
account for the alleged nasty “ tang ” about which certain experts were emphatic. It stands
to reason that tobacco smoked in a new state would not be so palatable as tobacco smoked in a
thoroughly seasoned condition.


Notwithstanding the unfavorable position of local leaf in this matter of ageing, the
Committee is satisfied that Australian growers are producing much good smokable tobacco,
most of which has a very agreeable aroma after it is steamed and dressed with the manufacturers 5
ingredients. What it would be like alter proper ageing is a matter of conjecture ; but the
Committee has little doubt it would be much better.
That the necessity for better treatment in storage is impressed upon the manufacturers
is indicated by the British-Australasian Tobacco Co.’s provision, in addition to the storage space
at Melbourne, of a large new floor at the Sydney factory solely for local tobacco.
PRESENT POSITION OE GROWERS IN RELATION TO PRODUCTION OF SUITABLE
LEAF.
46. The majority of the Committee are forced to the conclusion that, while in some respects
the growers of tobacco leaf in certain areas, notably Northern New South Wales, Tumut, and the
Wangaratta district of Victoria, have not succeeded in producing a leaf which in colour and
textural quality is up to the highest American standards, such growers have done their best to
make improvements, especially in the last seven years, or since the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company adopted a hostile attitude towards the continued production of air-cured dark, heavy
leaf. The growers have shown the utmost anxiety to improve their methods of curing, those
not caring to incur the expense of experimenting in this direction having gone out of the industry.
None of those who were wedded to the old methods of curing now remain in the industry, but
it is evident that many who formerly grew tobacco under air-curing conditions are likely to return
in the event of the adoption by the Federal Government of a policy calculated to remove the
old-time feeling of insecurity and uncertainty.
47. The available statistics show that after the ultimatum of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company about ten years ago in regard to the elimination of dark and heavy leaf, the
number of growers in Australia dropped by at least 50 per cent.
The main reason for this marked decrease in the number of growers has been given to the
Committee as unwillingness to incur the expense of the installation of flue-curing barns, the cost
of which varies considerably, according to the type of barn and the kind of labour used. Many
growers have built their own barns out of slabs and mud, whilst others have erected concrete,
brick or galvanized iron structures —the cost varying from £4O to £3OO.
Many old growers also disliked the idea of risking the capital outlay needed to grow a lighter
type of leaf. This change necessitated closer planting, the purchase of suitable varieties from
other districts, and the installation in dry districts of irrigation plants of either the overhead
or ground types. The cost of a good irrigation plant appears to be in the vicinity of £5OO, although
many growers have managed with cheaper plants which they utilize for general farm purposes.
The cost of packing and storage sheds for the flue-cured tobacco, which has to be graded and
baled and kept for nearly six months before purchase, also frightened many old growers out of
the industry.
There appears, also, to have been a fear in the minds of many old growers that after the
expenditure of the capital required to grow light types of tobacco leaf for flue-curing, the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company would not pay very much more for the product than it
had been paying for the more cheaply-produced dark air-cured leaf. This fear has not been
realized ; although many growers who remained in the industry assured the Committee that
the present-day prices were, in proportion to the cost of production, no greater than for the
air-cured leaf. The following references make this clear :
Mr. G. A. Lye, Tamworth. —l4o4. So that you practically got the same profit per acre for your flue-cured tobacco
in 1924 as for your sun-dried crop in 1917? —Yes, about the same. It costs more to flue-cure tobacco.
1405. Allowing for the smaller capital invested, it would be more profitable, according to your figures, to grow
sun-dried tobacco if there was a market for it? —That is so.
Mr. H. P. Baker, Manilla. —2389. Comparing the price of sun-dried leaf with that received for flue-cured tobacco,
do you think the price for the flue-cured product compensates for the extra expenditure necessary to produce it?—-I do
not think we are making as much out of our flue-cured tobacco as when we were sun-drying. Our expenses are so much
greater.
48. Some experts appear to have given ground for the feelings of insecurity amongst
growers by their lack of enthusiasm. They have been in the habit of qualifying their opinions
rather too much, and have somewhat damped the ardour of growers. While this absence of
optimism has been justified up to a point, it has probably been carried too far, thus creating


in the minds of growers a feeling of pessimism—of lack of faith in their ability to do better.
Mr. Slagg, the Federal Director, has, however, shown more optimism. In his evidence before
the Committee he stated :
202. Is there any reason why Australia should not produce enough tobacco to meet its own requirements ?
That is not done in any part of the world, even in the most important tobacco-producing countries. The United
States of America exports possibly from 200,000,000 to 300,000,000 dollars worth each year, but it also imports
100,000,000 dollars worth a year for use in manufacture.
203. To what extent is it possible for Australia to meet its own requirements ?—lf our efforts to improve the
quality of the local leaf succeeds, we can reasonably expect to supply the major portion of the leaf required by the
Australian consumer, possibly 60 or 70 per cent. J
204. Did you say earlier that perhaps Australia could supply its own requirements and also have some for
export ?—When we have begun to supply our domestic needs I hope Australia will take its place with the other
dominions in the export of leaf. That is looking a long way ahead.
and in his final evidence he added :
(Q. 5555). Based on the knowledge of what other tobacco-growing countries have accomplished we may
reasonably hope, with improvement in quality, to supply at least 60 per cent, of our domestic requirements.
It is difficult to say how long a time would be required to reach this position. Ten years would be a short period
Much will depend upon the success of the investigations at present under way.
49. The Committee considers the bulk of evidence goes to confirm the opinion that 60 per
cent, of bright mahogany—the type most in demand by the buyers—can be produced much
earlier than Mr. Slagg s estimate. Some growers have exceeded that percentage, for instance
Mr. Murphy, of Pomonal, Victoria, claimed that his crops had been practically all bright
leaf, whilst Messrs. Ridley and Anderson in the same district had obtained 80 and 70 per
cent, respectively of bright leaf. In the Wangaratta district Messrs. Rae Bros, had 60 per cent,
of bright leaf last year and Mr. Kneebone between 50 and 60 per cent. Mr. Hyson, of
Kootingal, near Tamworth, stated his neighbour had between 70 and 80 per cent, of bright leaf
and Mr. Goodman of Loomberah in the game district had 60 per cent, in 1924 and 75 per cent,
in last year. Mr. Baker claimed that some of the growers around Manilla had produced 75 per
cent, of light leaf in 1928 and 73 per cent in 1929.
More Optimism Needed.
50. While extravagant optimism is to be deprecated, especially amongst responsible
experts, a little more faith in the ability of our growers, a little more appreciation of what they
are doing to improve their methods, should be the keynote of future Federal direction. Continued
wet-blanketing by the introduction of “ifs ” and“ buts ” has had, and is likely to continue to
have, a discouraging influence, especially on new growers.
It is a sufficient commentary upon the inadequate optimism of the experts that the principal
buyer, the British-Australasian Tobacco Co., has offered and has paid fairly high prices for an
ever-increasing percentage of bright mahogany leaf—the type of leaf which ten years ago was
almost unknown. It is not to be expected that the buyer should wax enthusiastic for business
reasons ; but the Committee has noticed that the encouragement given growers, who are “ triers ”
by Mr. Lough, the British-Australasian Tobacco Co.’s chief buyer, both by’ his personal help
in growing, grading and curing, and by his prices, has been a definite factor in the creation of
keenness and enthusiasm amongst growers.
The growers had no Australian-wide direction from experts until Mr. Slagg appeared
The effect has been to create an inter-State interest in tobacco research and experimentation
The interest manifested amongst the growers in all tobacco-producing States in the Federal
work is very gratifying, and shows conclusively that the Federal control of this important branch
of the industry is likely to produce more widespread results than all the years of State direction
have been able to do.
51. So far as the present position of the growers is concerned, the Committee is of opinion
that it shows a great improvement as compared with any past period, due to the definite change-
over to flue-curing and consequent introduction of skilled methods of cultivation and curing
the higher prices being paid for the bright leaf by the principal buyer, the intervention of the
Federal Government upon research and experimentation, and the confidence gained in the last
seven years by the production of a tobacco that, in colour at all events, is becoming much closer
to the best American.
The growers have, in the Committee’s opinion, vastly improved their methods of
cultivation and curing in the last ten years. There is really no comparison between the methods
in vogue prior to the introduction of flue-curing and those obtaining at present. Each year
the majority of growers seem to increase their percentage of bright mahogany, some especially
skilful or fortunate achieving as much as 80 and as high as 95 per cent., as evidence already
quoted testifies.


The majority appear to be confident that they can reach as high as 75 per cent, bright
mahogany, and to be satisfied to lose 10 per cent, of their crop on the score of its being unsuitable
to the manufacturer; while some are prepared to lose 25 per cent, provided the prices paid for
the brighter leaf are satisfactory.
52. The industry has become definitely a white growers’ industry, only a handful of Chinese
remaining, and these are confined to Northern New South Wales. The sons of the growers
are very keenly interested in tobacco, and appear to become more expert than their fathers. In
many instances, the sons do the growing, and in most cases the curing and grading. The young
men on the farm seem to like the flue-curing, and show great aptitude in this department
of the work.
The Chinese not being skilful at mechanical methods, show noclination to inlearn the art
of flue-curing, consequently there does not appear to be the slightest danger that the industry
will revert to Chinese labour. A number of Italians from Northern Queensland have found
their way to Texas and Tamworth, where they are showing great interest in tobacco-growing,
and a considerable amount of aptitude in learning both the cultivation of the leaf and the
flue-curing.
Soil and Rainfall.
53. There is a general acceptance, however, of the definite view of the experts that if the
light leaf is to be produced in greater quantities rich soil must be abandoned in favour of light
sandy soil. Evidence on this aspect is contained in the following portions of evidence :
Dr. Darnell-Smith (Q. 807) :
Whatever care the grower bestows on his crop he is not likely to raise really bright aromatic flue-eured leaf
on heavy soil.
Mr. Howell (Q. 4610) :
To produce good quality tobacco one must have poor soil, with a sufficient rainfall, and use fertilizer.
Mr. Temple Smith (Q. 5470) :
Do you still adhere to your opinion that there is a bright future before the tobacco-grower in Victoria ?
—Yes. If we can get open competition in future, the dark tobaccoes grown in Victoria will be driven out by degrees,
or the greater proportion of them will, and the growers will devote their attention to the lighter soils, which will
produce better types of leaf than those obtained to-day.
The great majority of growers seemed to be satisfied that to produce the types of leaf
required by the manufacturer the poorest soils, essentially sandy in nature, were needed. There
are enormous areas of such country everywhere in Australia, and the Committee has no doubt
that once this fundamental necessity is realized 90 per cent, of tobacco will in future be grown
in soil of this character. River flats, which are sandy, appear to provide an ideal foundation
for the production of light tobacco. In all the existing areas in which heavy leaf has hitherto
beem produced rich soil has been used to a large extent; but almost without exception the same
districts contain lighter soils, which many growers are now trying.
Rainfall is the next vital factor in the production of light tobacco. Many parts of
Australia are favored with regular rainfalls which are not excessive in the growing period for
tobacco. In districts where the rainfall is erratic, irrigation is an indispensable adjunct; and
this fact renders it inadvisable for prospective growers in dry districts to plant their tobacco
too far from a natural water supply, thus preventing themselves from employing irrigation.
Varieties.
54. Selection of the right varieties of plants which have been tested for the production
of fight tobacco is the next factor. The majority of growers now avoid varieties which are known
to produce big heavy plants, and have acquired a great deal of knowledge in regard to the
varieties more suitable for their purpose. The growers themselves experiment almost
continuously, and with the help of the State experts and the Federal Director of Tobacco
Investigation have little difficulty in securing varieties which have proved successful in America
and Australia. The British-Australasian Tobacco Co. has also assisted growers in this direction.
The Committee considers that the Federal Tobacco Department should not only give
continuous instruction to growers in the selection of plant varieties, but should secure seed from
other countries for local experiment.
Cultivation.
55. The growers need to improve their methods of cultivation. Many make tobacco a
side line, and in busy seasons neglect such essential work as suckering and topping. The crop
needs constant attention from the time of planting out to the time of harvesting. The Chinese
give it this close attention. Some white growers do likewise ; but not enough of them show
the necessary concentration, Once it is clear that the industry has come to stay, and is to be


xxxvm
developed, this unfortunate feature will be less conspicuous. Many witnesses consider tobacco-
growing, even on a small scale, a whole-time job. The returns in good seasons out-distance
all other crops, and even with a small acreage—from 4 to 10 —the constant attention required
to produce well-nourished and perfect plants ready for picking and curing makes it a whole-time
job for field labour.
Harvesting and Curing.
56. Growers are chiefly deficient in their knowledge of the right time to pick the tobacco
leaves for curing. The evidence shows that this important aspect is largely a matter of
guess-work. Many growers harvest the leaves in a decidedly unripe state, consequently it is
almost impossible to secure the necessary bright colour in curing, and a good deal of tobacco
leaves the barns in a patchy or green condition. A large number of growers are now alive to
the danger of curing the leaf when it is unripened, and the result is a higher percentage of bright
or lemon-coloured tobacco in districts where previously the great bulk was dark and heavy.
Considering the short time they have been flue-curing, however, the majority of growers display
considerable knowledge, and seem to be steadily improving.
Grading.
57. Grading of the leaf into the various colours required by the buyer is not receiving
sufficient attention, but many growers are now awakening to the profitable nature of this phase
of the work. It is estimated that at least 3d. per lb. extra is made by good grading ; but probably
it is a great deal more, for the buyer has more confidence in graded stuff, and is saved time and
labour in unpacking bales and directing a better grading. Ungraded leaf has to be graded in the
factories, and the cost of this is therefore taken from the price paid to the grower on the farm.
Many growers have received helpful instruction from the buyers of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Co. ; but a number have not bothered to learn anything about it, although it is clear
that grading is not a difficult matter, especially when the leaf is purchased on colour.
The Committee found that most of the tobacco rejected by the buyer, or else sold at poor
prices, was ungraded and generally inferior, having been spoiled in curing or else cured in a very
unripe condition. The amount of tobacco rejected last year by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Co., according to Mr. Sambell, Secretary to the Victorian Tobacco-growers’ Association, was
700 bales. There is always likely to be a small percentage of poor stuff mixed up with any grower’s
offering, and it does not seem reasonable to expect the manufacturer to buy it if he cannot use
it in any way whatever. The Committee, in looking through the British-Australasian Tobacco
Co.’s Sydney factory, saw many tons of inferior local tobacco, that had been purchased amongst
good stuff at fair average prices, being ground into manurial powder for sale at a low figure-
58. The growers should, in the Committee’s opinion, avail themselves more of the offer
of the British-Australasian Tobacco Co. to send their sons into the factory for experience. There
is no better method of teaching the young grower all about tobacco. A few growers have availed
themselves of this offer, notably at Pomonal, but probably if the Federal Director organized
this movement and communicated its advantages to all growers it would become an important
educational stimulus to the growing side of the industry. Mr. Murphy, President of the Pomonal
Tobacco-growers’ Association, stated :
(Q. 3564) In 1927 the British-Australasian Tobacco Company took to Melbourne the sons of some of the growers
in various parts of the State, to teach them to grade tobacco, and mine was one of those selected. He spent four or
five weeks in Melbourne, and was paid the company’s ruling rate of wage. He was very much against the company
when he went to Melbourne, but after having handled the tobacco there, he came back and gave an address to our
growers, and I think he surprised them greatly by his criticism of tobacco that even Mr. Lough buys.
59. The grower needs expert instruction in grading. Hitherto he has had to depend largely
upon the buyer, who has acted under instructions from his employers. Co-operative grading
societies, which could employ competent graders, would soon become a feature of the industry
if encouraged and if insisted upon by the Federal tobacco control.
60. The idea of a central grading depot, as developed in the United States, does not seem
to appeal to the Australian growers, who do not like to allow their tobacco to go off the farm
till it is sold. The Committee has not received any practical scheme for a central grading depot,
and therefore does not advise insistence upon this feature, at least for some years to come. Once
the industry assumes large proportions, central grading depots will probably materialize as an
economic necessity.
Blue Mould and Other Diseases.
61. The growers have hitherto proved unable to deal with the blue mould disease, which
in many cases wipes out the tobacco of a whole district two out of three years. Now that efficient
scien.inc investigation is being carried on, under Federal direction, immediate steps should be
taken by the tobacco department to convey the instructions of the scientific branch of investigation


to every grower ; and this should be backed up by expert supervision. Hitherto the growers
have been left largely to their own devices in this matter, the State experts not having been
able to propound any effective remedial measures. In many cases individual growers have
experimented —quite obviously in the dark—and have been fortunate in securing results which
have led them to proclaim the discovery of reliable preventive methods; but in all cases
these claims have not stood the test of further experiment or of different climatic and
growing conditions.
62. Other pests, such as split worm, mosaic, grubs, bunchy top and root rot are not so
serious at the present stage as blue mould ; in fact, root rot appears to be part and parcel of
blue mould. With the exception of blue mould, the majority of growers have been able to invent
their own individual methods of dealing with pests, particularly grubs.
Small Areas Advisable.
63. The Committee desires to impress upon growers the importance of area in relation to
commercial results. The evidence definitely indicates that, as in the United States of America,
so in Australia, the individual grower should not aim at large areas—say from 10 to 50 acres —
but should confine himself to small areas ranging from 4to 10 acres. The area, of course, should
depend upon the supply of labour available. Where a grower has to depend almost wholly
upon his own efforts, with perhaps the assistance of one or two sons, he cannot profitably cope
with more than 4or 5 acres. It is better that he should give proper attention to a small area
which he can easily handle himself, and produce 2 or 3 tons of good quality bright leaf, which
will fetch remunerative prices, than plunge into a big undertaking, involving the employment
of much skilled labour. Failing such labour, the half-attention which means an insufficiently-
cultivated crop, inadequate flue-curing and haphazard grading will almost certainly terminate
in disappointing results. The attempt of some growers, who possess only limited capital and
very little actual experience, to start with anything from 20 to 50 acres, is likely to discourage
not only the growers themselves, but their neighbours. In the United States the average size
of tobacco farms is 3.7 acres.
In cases, however, in which a grower has the necessary capital, the suitable land, and
sufficient skill in growing, curing and grading to justify substantial areas, some excuse might
exist for larger ventures ; but as a general rule 4 or 5 acres will occupy all the personal attentio
which a small farmer is able *lo give a crop that he is treating as a side line.
Outlook Promising.
64. The Committee does not absolve the growers from all blame for any faults in
Australian-grown tobacco, but is satisfied there is now a tobacco conscience amongst growers
and feels sure this will, under conditions of greater stability, quickly develop into a sense of
responsibility to the smoking public. The obstinate and inefficient grower will quickly be
eliminated by the more reasonable and efficient grower who will come into the industry once
it is evident that there is an assured market at remunerative prices for the right article.
The Committee thinks the growers generally show intelligence and initiative, and in
consideration of their dependence upon one buyer, and upon an inadequate scheme of direction,
have shown courage in striving to keep in the industry, as well as a keen desire to improve the
reputation of Australian tobacco amongst smokers.
Good Australian Samples.
65. The Committee is convinced that good light tobacco suitable for pipe smoking and
possibly for cigarette manufacture is being produced in all the existing tobacco areas, and it
does not subscribe to any suggestion that new areas now being opened up, or areas which may be
opened up later, will have to be solely depended upon for leaf of this high-grade character. It
is confirmed in this view by the many samples of good bright leaf shown to it from Northern
New South Wales, Wangaratta (Victoria), Pomonal (Victoria), Mt. Barker (South Australia)
and Mareeba (North Queensland).
New Process of Curing.
66. The Committee inspected many tobacco-curing barns in all tobacco areas, and found
that the types showed remarkable variation. The best types appeared to be in the Tamworth
district, where most of the growers have gone in for expensive concrete or brick barns with good
furnaces. In the Wangaratta district of Victoria the type in most favour is galvanized iron,
with a good system of roof ventilation. In all districts, however, there are numerous small
and cheaply-built barns, which are of doubtful advantage to the grower, who must lose money
by poor facilities for curing.


67. The Committee displayed great interest in the claims of Mr. William Panlook
Managing Director of Panlook Bros. Pty. Ltd., Eurobin, Victoria, who invited the Committee
to inspect a new curing process which it was considered would greatly improve the curing of leaf.
The Committee visited Mr. Panlook’s property, and made a close inspection of his process. His
barns are large and up to date. He has introduced the same principle of drying tobacco, with
some modifications to suit the different type of product, as he has employed in the curing of
hops. This is a forced air-circulation system, designed to drive the air at temperatures controlled
by a dynamo-driven fan from bottom to top of the barn and from top to bottom, excluding the
hot or cold air and re-circulating at regular intervals. By this process he could yellow the leaf—
which, however, had to be cut ripe in the field within 36 hours, and he could cure a barn within
from three to four days, as against at least six days under the ordinary process. He claimed
that this system would give a more even yellowing from top of the barn to the bottom, and all
over the leaf, not leaving a large peicentage about 25 usually—to emerge from the curin° r in
a patchy or wholly green looking condition. He thought he could secure 90 per cent, of bright
yellow leaf by his process, and possibly 100 per cent. Mr, Panlook, however, was careful to inform
the Committee that his experiment was not yet complete, and he required probablv another
year to make it perfect. Until he had tried it right out, he did not advise other growers to on
in for it. -
Even if Mr. Panlook’s process does not prove wholly successful in fulfilling the inventor’s
claims, it certainly looks like the application of a useful new method to tobacco curing. The
instance shows the keener interest which some growers are taking in the improvement of
Australian tobacco.
New Growers Coming In.
68. Although the Committee did not call for evidence in regard to the prospects of an
increase in the growing of tobacco, or the manufacturing of tobacco in Australia, it was informed
by many witnesses that a definite and full measure of protection for at least a period would almost
certainly encourage many primary producers to go in for the cultivation of leaf under flue-curing
conditions. This is, of course, largely a matter of speculation ; but the Committee thinks it is
extremely likely, in view of the publicity now being given to the industry and the fact that the
research and experimental work has been taken over by the Commonwealth Government, that
there will be a considerable increase in the number of growers. The fear that many growers
will attempt to produce tobacco on unsuitable soils, and with very little knowledge of the
difficulties, is probably well-founded ; but if the Federal tobacco department, which the Committee
hopes will be established, makes systematic efforts to warn would-be growers against haphazard
ventures, and also seeks the co-operation of the State Departments of Agriculture in the work
of tendering expert assistance to those who contemplate growing, a proper check should be placed
upon unwise and hasty, experiments except in the case of a small number of isolated individuals.
69. That the more effective protection, coupled with the big profits to be made bv
successful growers, ranging from 100 to 200 per cent, net, will tempt many more farmers and
even larger landowners, to grow tobacco is certain. For instance, at Texas the Committee was
informed by Mr. C. F. White, Managing Director of Texas Estates Ltd., that his Companv’s
idea was to go in for tobacco to assist in a subdivisional scheme later on ; and by Mr. W. Lennon
of River Bend, Texas, that “ tobacco growing is only a small side fine with iis, but we intend
to make it a big thing. If we get encouragement we are all going in for it extensively
70. The Committee also received information that three large tobacco-growing ventures
are about to be launched, one to be established at Mareeba, North Queensland, about eight miles
from the Federal investigation plots ; and the others at Pomonal, about sixteen miles from
Stawell, Victoria.
New Manufacturers.
71. On the manufacturing side, an important development which should be favourable
to the local growing industry is the public announcement that Messrs. Godfrey, Phillips & Co
Ltd., of England, have secured a site for a large, modern factory in Melbourne, and propose to
commence manufacturing tobacco at an early date. This firm has a large and is probablv
able to establish itself in face of the strongest competition. No doubt it will be a buyer of the
Australian product. j ' -
72. The Committee was also informed by Mr. Dyason, Chairman of Directors of G G
Goode Ltd., tobacco manufacturers, Melbourne, that so soon as leaf suitable for cigarettes was
available in Australia, his firm would be a purchaser, 6

Dudgeon & Arnell Pty. Ltd., Melbourne, are already turning out a composite cigarette
tobacco in tins under the title " Happy Thoughts ”, for which there is a very good sale in Victoria ;
they also manufacture the all-Australian tobaccoes “ Sunday Best ” and “ Belvidere.” This
firm is a regular buyer of Australian-grown leaf, and is anxious to secure supplies suitable for
cigarettes and light pipe tobacco. *
Michelides Ltd., of Perth, Western Australia, is also a present and prospective purchaser
of larger quantities of Australian leaf for its brands of cigarettes, which have a large sale in
Western Australia. This company has advised the Committee, by letter, that it is now
manufacturing the following lines : Tobacco —Luxor and Marvel; Cigarettes—Golden West,
Jester, Mena, Luxor and President. It uses quantities of the following tobacco leaf—Turkish,
Greek, Rhodesian, Latakia, American and Australian —its purchases of the last being
approximately 11,000 lbs. in 1927-28, 26,500 lbs. in 1928-29, and 80,000 lbs. in 1929-30.
Local Market.
73. The local market for Australian tobacco is therefore extensive, and once the industry
begins to move forward on the lines being pursued at present there should be a steadily-increasing
quantity of good leaf, suitable for cigars, cigarettes and pipe tobacco every year, until in time
the great bulk of tobacco smoked in Australia is produced locally.
74. Some indication of the market available may be gathered from the following figures
showing the quantity and value of imports of Tobacco, &c., into Australia since Federation ;

PRICES TO THE CONSUMER.
75. The Committee does not think the prices of manufactured tobacco need be further
raised to the consumer, the present prices for all imported brands being from 50 to 100 per cent,
higher than at the beginning of the present century. The most popular brand of cigarettes,
Capstans, were formerly sold for 3d. a packet of ten, whereas now’ they are sold for 6d. a packet
of eleven, the manufacturers having taken one cigarette out of each packet since the imposition
of the extra shilling import duty. Various brands of pipe tobacco went up, also, in most cases
an extra Id. an ounce. Evidence on this point was given by Mr. Bentley in the following portion
of his evidence :
285. When the recent additional Is. duty was imposed on imported leaf, we only increased “ Havelock ” dark
by 9d., “ Lucky Hit ” by 6d., and “ Starlight ” was not increased at all —the reason, of course, being that we were
not increasing our prices for Australian dark and No. 2 leaf, a proportion or the whole of which is used in the manufacture
of these particular tobaccoes.
76. It is certain that local manufacturers will be able to place Australian brands on the
market at a much lower price than imported, and this should greatly stimulate the demand for
the cheaper tobaccos. It should be possible, under the scheme to be proposed by the Committee,
for the manufacturers to retail Australian brands at half the price of the imported. The


Committee feels confident that a move in this direction would rapidly remove much of the prejudice
alleged to exist amongst the smoking public for tobaccoes known to be wholly or partly Australian.
Mr. Jennings, at Texas, also supported this view, as indicated in the following questions:—
2894. That has nothing to do with the buyers?— While we permit the importation of American leaf, the Australia
public will not buy much else. If we put a duty of 10s. per lb. on American tobacco, the public will very soon learn
to smoke the Australian product. Even if the Australian tobacco has a distinctive flavour, there is no reason why
Australians should not come to like it. In Italy and France the people appreciate the tobacco sold there ; but if we
went there it would kill us if we tried to smoke it.
2934. It has been suggested that the best way of getting the Australian public to smoke Australian tobacco
is practically to force the manufacturers to put it on the market and advertise it at a price that will appeal to the
public. The company has given an assurance that “ Waratah ” tobacco was well advertised ; that sales were good
for a year or two, and then fell away. Do you think it would be a fair thing to make the inducement so strong that
the public would have no alternative but to buy the Australian tobacco? —I think it is the only solution.
2935. How would you do it? —By increasing the import duty on American leaf on a sliding scale. As the
Australian growers increased their output, increase the import duty correspondingly, and also increase the excise unless
you are prepared to lose a lot of revenue.
THE POLICY AND PRACTICE OF THE BRITISH-AUSTRALASIAN TOBACCO
COMPANY.
77. The Committee has to thank the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd.
for its assistance in this inquiry. Without such assistance, the task of the Committee would
have been much more difficult. The evidence given by Mr. Bentley, one of the directors, and
Mr. Lough, the Australian buyer for the Company, was comprehensive and very valuable. The
Committee also received very courteous treatment from the Company in visiting, at the Company’s
invitation, the principal factory at Raleigh Park, Kensington, Sydney, where the directors
personally conducted the members through every department of the factory. An invitation
to inspect the other factory of the Company, in Melbourne, could not be availed of owing to
lack of opportunity.
78. The Committee, not having a specific reference, did not seek evidence as to
the Company’s business methods or its profits. All information relating to the quantities of
tobacco purchased both inside and outside Australia was readily supplied to the Committee
by the Company, principally in the evidence of Mr. Bentley, but no questions were asked on
the subject of profits except the following :
291. By the Chairman. —Would not the margin of profit available to the company on all its manufactures have
enabled it to carry the extra duty on imported leaf without increasing the price to the public ? —That brings us to
the profits of the company. That, I suggest, is a matter that does not come within the scope of the inquiry.
292. One of the disadvantages of increasing the duty is that the prices paid by the public are generally increased.
I am entitled to ask whether the extra duty of Is. a lb. on the imported leaf was such that it was impossible for the
company to continue to supply the goods to the public without passing the duty on ? —-I say definitely that it was not
possible.
Beyond these questions, no references were made during the inquiry to the Company’s
financial position, except that made by Mr. Jones, a member of the Committee (Q. 4886), when
in referring to a grower’s evidence that his (the grower’s) average prices had declined from
2s. 4d. a lb. in 1921 to Is. 9|d. a lb. in 1929, an extract from the Sydney Bulletin of 25th
December, 1929, was produced showing that the Company’s profits had increased from £582,979
in 1921 to £1,011,307 in 1929.
Mr. Bentley gave the Committee an outline of the Compay’s size and operations in the
following portion of his evidence :
A great manufacturing industry in Australia has been built up, an industry in which 5,300 employees are
employed and which pays in wages and benefits over £1,200,000 a year.
79. The Committee submitted Mr. Bentley and Mr. Lough, to a lengthy and searching
cross-examination on all phases of the Company’s activities in relation to the Australian growers.
The questions were all answered freely and frankly, and with an evident desire to conceal nothing
which the Committee considered relevant to the inquiry.
80. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company has undoubtedly made systematic efforts
to improve the cultivation of tobacco in Australia, having spent, in the last twenty-five years
the sum of £75,000 on experimental work irrespective of the special contribution to the
Commonwealth Tobacco Investigation. This money has been expended in the carrying out
of experimental plots in various tobacco districts, in instructional work amongst the growers,
and in a very elaborate plantation scheme at Texas, on the New South Wales and Queensland
border. The story of the Texas experiment, which the Company regarded as a costly failure,
was told by Mr. Bentley in the following portion of his evidence :
285. I should like to mention that my company purchased land near Taxas on the border of New South Wales and
Queensland for the purpose of an experimental farm. We erected flue-curing barns and employed only white labour.
We built cottages for the men and spared no expense to try and institute a white colony, but we did not make a
success of it. We kept the farm going for five years from 1910 to 1915, under the supervision of our own experts, but
as we could not get an improved article we closed down the farm and sold it and lost £20,000 on that experiment alone.


The Committee made full inquiry into this experiment when taking evidence at Texas,
and elicited information which tended to indicate that the reasons given by the Company for the
plantation failure were not altogether subscribed to by others. The Committee was fortunate to
have as a witness Mr. H. Jennings, now of Texas, but for many years an employee of the British-
Austraiasian Tobacco Company, and the manager for most of the period of the Texas plantation,
to which was attached a factory for stemming the tobacco. This witness had been sent by the
Company to America for experience in American grading and curing methods at a cost of £l.OOO.
Mr. Jennings indicated that the main cause of the failure at Texas was the attempt to grow
tobacco there on the plantation system, i.e., the employment of men on wages ; he added that
most of the employees were brought from England and were not competent as they had had
no previous agricultural experience—some of them having been dock labourers and lorry drivers.
There was also a serious outbreak of typhoid, which resulted in a number of deaths and added
to the difficulties of the venture.
81. The company has for many years, also, given its buyers carte blanche in regard to the
education of the growers. No doubt this has been largely due to the realization that the more
unsuitable the tobacco grown the more expensive would be the local industry to the Company,
which has for over twenty years been the only buyer of any value to the local growers. The
growers appear to have sought the advice of the Company’s buyers more than that of the State
experts, probably for the reason that they hoped to give the Company a certain amount of
responsibility for the inferiority, if any, subsequently alleged at the time of buying. Another
reason is that the Company’s buyer visits every grower during the year, and is, therefore, more
in touch with each man’s difficulties than are the State experts, who have not, so far as the
Committee has been able to gather, followed a systematic plan of inspection of tobacco crops.
82. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company absorbed all the old Australian tobacco
manufacturers, with a few small exceptions, and at the present time is able to control practically
the whole of the tobacco trade in Australia. The only other manufacturers in Australia who
are competing are Dudgeon & Arnell, Pty. Ltd., Melbourne ; G. G. Goode Ltd., Melbourne ;
Tobacco Company of South Australia Ltd., Adelaide; and Michelides Ltd, Perth. It is
doubtful whether all these and numerous smaller manufacturers of cigars and cirarettes among
them command more than 10 per cent, of the total tobacco trade ; certainly they do not seriously
threaten the British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s virtual monoply of the pipe tobacco and
cigarette trade in Australia. Now that a partial embargo has been placed on imported manufactured
tobacco the competition from outside is almost negligible. In certain lines, such as “ Edgeworth ”
tobacco (American) and “ State Express ” Cigarettes (British) there is a definite competition
between the importing firms and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, the latter having
recent!v introduced to the local market a new Burley tobacco called “ Temple Bar ” which is
designed to displace “ Edgeworth ”, and £t Country Life ” cigarettes, the answer to “ State
Express ”. Although no evidence was called on this matter, the Committee is satisfied that
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, by means of a widespread advertising campaign, has
had considerable success in these competitive efforts against outside manufacturers.
83. Not having sought, or been proffered, any information in regard to the British-
profits, the Committee is unable to make any definite statements
itself with drawing attention to the following statement published
ecember, 1929, and referred to in the course of the inquiry by Mr.

v iew of its privileged and enormously valuable position, the Company, being the
only big buyer of locally-produced tobacco, is under an obligation to the local industry.
Apparently, the directors have recognized this obligation, hence the policy and practice of
purchasing practically all the leaf grown locally at prices which would prevent any suggestion
that the Company had no sympathy for local growers, and no desire to make use of Australian
tobacco leaf. It is obvious, however, that the Company has been able to regulate the consumption
oi locally-grown leaf. This is clearly indicated by the following figures furnished by the Customs
Department, which show that for the last thirteen years, the amount of Australian-grown leaf
used m manufactures has steadily declined from 13.79 per cent, in 1915-16 to 5.11 per cent.

As the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has been the principal manufacturer and
importer in that period—other small manufacturers having imported very meagre supplies
principally for a mixture with local brands—the percentages quoted must, with perhaps a slight
variation, apply to the output of this company’s factories.
85. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company has had the control of the Australian
industry in its hands for nearly three decades. The amount of money it has expended each
year on local leaf, though a considerable sum in itself, would be only a small item in the Company’s
total expenditure in importing, manufacturing and placing its products on the Australian market
The Company has also built up a trade in.New Zealand and in some of the Pacific Islands.
86. The Committee takes the view that, in consideration of its valuable monopoly, its
published profits, and its power to regulate local production by means of carefully adjusted prices,
the Company has done well by local growers in the mass within the limits of the small amount
of local production. As to whether the Company has deliberately kept the consumption of local
leaf down year after year to suit its policy the evidence submitted to the Committee does not
enable any definite conclusion to be formed. All that can be said is that the worst feature is the
downward trend of the local tobacco manufactured shortly after the Company began to gain
control of the market, culminating in what looks like a definite intention to reduce the quantity of
local leaf used in manufacture to the smallest possible percentage. 17
Although the Committee does not say this has been the Company’s policy, it does say
that the Company has not made out a convincing case in the negative. If it be accepted that
the figures show the trend of policy, the motive is fairly clear. The Company is one of the biggest
manufacturing concerns in the world. It has over 5,000 employees, an enormous capital and
two large and very modern factories, fitted with labor-saving plant. There is a vast difference
between organizing production in a new and largely virgin territory and diverting the organized
production of another country which has specialised in tobacco cultivation for over 300 years
By the simple process of appointing buying agents in America, the Company has been able, year
after year, to ensure—except in the war period—a continuous and unlimited supply of high


quality leaf suitable for all its manufacturing purposes. This leaf has been purchasable at an
average figure of lOd. per lb. in the auction selling places which are a feature of the American
tobacco industry. By merely cabling, the Company can increase or diminish its supplies to suit
its annual needs. It has also placed itself in the position that it can compete with other overseas
manufacture!* not only in continuity of supplies but in quality of leaf, for even British
manufacturers have drawn their supplies largely from the United States.
87. As a matter of policy, therefore, the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has had
every reason to conduct its huge and ever-growing operations upon the sound foundation of a
permanent and suitable supply of leaf. The effect has been to enable it to drive nearly all the
overseas competitors out of the Australian trade. Increasing tariff protection for locally-
manufactured tobaccoes, also, has played a part in this, and has further justified the Company
in concentrating its activities upon the always-available American tobacco-growing industry.
That it has considered the possibility of having its foreign supplies cut off is indicated by
the following answers given by Mr. Bentley to the Chairman :
1001. Has it occurred to your company that, in the event of supplies of tobacco from overseas being cut off,
you would, apart from stocks in hand, be dependent on Australian-grown tobacco?— Yes. The company’s definite
policy is to establish the Australian tobacco-growing industry on a satisfactory footing.
1002. At the outbreak of war in 1914 was your company in a position to meet requirements for any lengthv
period?—We got through ; but it was difficult.
1003. company, during the war period, buy all the Australian leaf it could obtain?—l do not know.
The company has always bought almost every pound of Australian leaf available. It has, of course, rejected inferior
leaf.
1004. Is it a fact that, during the war period, your buyer urged Australian growers of sun-dried leaf not to waste
a pound of it?—l do not know ; but I can understand his doing so.
When the world war broke out the Company made a determined effort to secure Australian
leaf, and it also drew liberally upon its accumulated stocks in the factories.
Should Australia’s tobacco supplies be cut off by a sudden outbreak of war in the Pacific,
there would be totally inadequate local supplies to draw from, and in the present undeveloped
state of the industry, the growers could not possibly make up the deficiency inside from three to
five years. The Company is, therefore, taking a considerable risk in its dependence for about
95 per cent, of its raw material upon the United States.
There is said to be a big export surplus now available in Rhodesia ; but an outbreak of
war would probably cut off this source too. No other tobacco-producing country is near enough
to Australia to be able to contribute sufficient for the needs of six and a half million people at
short notice.
88. Another inference to be drawn from the Company’s preference for American leaf,
notwithstanding the risk of losing its principal source of supply, is the heavy cost uppn one
manufacturer of buying under present local conditions. In America, the grower carries his
cured tobacco to local markets, where it is graded and auctioned, as indicated by Dr. Darnell-
Smithin his excellent report on his visit to the United States of America published by the Australian
Tobacco Investigation as Bulletin No. 1, from which the following quotation is interesting;—
In any given tobacco-growing centre one or more tobacco warehouses are built by a firm of tobacco dealers.
Each warehouse is a huge structure of wood covering half an acre or more. The roof is of galvanized iron with numerous
windows, as plenty of light is needed to judge the colour of tobacco. One side has windows alternating with large
doors. The doors at the end of .the warehouse are large enough to admit the ingress and egress of motor lorries loaded
with tobacco ; the floor is of wood. One or more scales with large dials for accurately weighing the tobacco are provided.
There are also provided very large numbers of flat baskets, made of lattice laths about 2 inches broad. Each basket
is about 3 ft. 6 in, square and 7 inches deep. The tare of each basket is known. They hold easily from 50 to 200 lb.
of tobacco and sometimes larger quantities are put into them.
The warehouse has a man who starts the price of the tobacco contained in a basket, the auctioneer calls the
price, the buyers, in two single files on either side of the row of baskets, make their bids very rapidly. The warehouse
representative may bid as often as he likes ; the tobacco is sold to the highest bidder, the price is immediately marked
on the ticket with the name of the buyer. (Dollars per 100 lb. or cents per lb. give the same figure.) Two clerks with
books follow each file of buyers, copies of the tickets are taken (seller, weight, price, buyer), and the clerks check each
other at the end of each row of baskets. The rate at which the tobacco is sold is surprising ; on the average three
baskets are sold per minute. Even so, it is sometimes necessary to have a “ hold over ” sale next day.
In Australia the grower is isolated and individualistic. The buyer has not only to go to
his farm to inspect and purchase the tobacco, but he has to keep track of the growers from year
to year without any system of notification. He has to be a man who knows every grower, and
the shortest route to take in visiting him. Strange as it seems, no system of notification has
been instituted by the growers or by the State tobacco experts. The grower secures a crop,
and waits for the buyer to call upon him.


It is easy to see that a great extension of growing under these crude conditions would
render it necessary for the big buying company to train many men to go round seeking the
sellers —men who would have to be experts. It would also be necessary to bargain with each
seller separately. With thousands of growers this would be a stupendous task for one Company.
If there is to be an extension of growing in Australia, the growers will have to render more
assistance to the buyers, who could refuse to visit the farms and who could tell growers to submit
the tobacco to them at the factories or at some central depot. The main inducement for the
buyers to avoid any such drastic action appears to be the desire for tobacco of good quality. If
the inducement to the buyer to purchase local leaf were made stronger, no doubt he would
continue the present haphazard method of contact with the growers for some time to come,
until so many growers came into the industry as to make this system of buying unworkable.
It would then be the responsibility of the growers to organize on some co-operative selling basis.
When more buyers come in the possibility of adopting the auction market method established
in America could be considered for Australia.
89. Summed up, the Committee has come to the conclusion that although the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company genuinely desires to purchase large quantities of good bright
Australian tobacco, the Company is satisfied from past experience that under the conditions
governing the production in Australia not more than a small percentage of manufacturing require-
ments is likely to be produced. This small percentage enables the Company to confine local leaf in
manufacture to an easily-regulated quantity, The trouble and expense, of purchasing, together
with probable heavy loss through the production at the present stage of large quantities of local
leaf, a proportion of which would be inferior, are contributing factors in the Company’s policy
and practice. But the greatest factor appears to be the ease with which unlimited supplies
can be obtained from America.
90. This brings us to the contention of the Company that the high quality of its products
has had a good deal to do with the heavy increase in Australian consumption of imported tobaccoes
since the beginning of the present century. The contention does not, however, make due
allowance for the doubling of the population within the period of the Company’s operations ;
nor does it allow for the great increase in the smoking public, due to the addiction of women to
cigarettes.
91. It has to be admitted, however, that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s
manufactures are of a very high quality, and are generally acceptable to the public. At the
same time, individual taste has little or no chance to exercise its choice. No other company is
manufacturing tobaccos to any extent, consequently the British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s
products have the market to themselves, with trifling competition. It is difficult to imagine
that if competition had been considerable, the quality of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company’s tobaccos would still have given the Company the same unchallenged position that
it holds at the present moment.
On the question of the smoking quality of Australian tobaccos, manufactured as whole
or part brands by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company it is only necessary to say that
with the exception of “ Waratah ” which has not until lately been made available in considerable
quantities, and certain composite brands, the Australian public has had a very limited opportunity
of forming its opinion. The Committee is convinced that these brands are susceptible to
improvement in process of manufacture ; and with the steady improvement in the production
of bright Australian leaf, will furnish a wholly acceptable article to the local smoking public,
more particularly if the manufacturer is able to place them on the market at a much cheaper
price than any of his imported products.
Bonus Paid by Company
92. The Committee heard evidence from many growers on the subject of the voluntary
bonus paid by the Company, and is satisfied that this bonus has helped to create the suspicion
that the Company considers the local leaf, particularly the best qualities, is worth more than
the prices usually offered, the bonus being an additional instalment on the real value. There is
not much ground for suspicion as the Company in offering! as] much as Is. bonus for all leaf
fetching 2s. or over, is probably endeavouring to stimulate the greater production of bright
mahogany. The Committee considers, however, that it would be advisable for the company to
discontinue the bonus, and pay a straight-out price, offering a wide margin between the prices
for inferior dark leaf and for mahogany and lemon. With only about 5 per cent, of bright lemon-
coloured available, the offer of a big price, say ss. per lb. would certainly stimulate many growers
to improve their varieties of leaf, and pay more attention to their cultivation and their methods
of curing. In this way a much bigger percentage of the next colour—bright mahogany—would


xlvii
almost certainly be obtained. The tendency would be to rapidly reduce the quantity of poor
dark leaf. The high price, namely, from 9d. to Is. 6d. per lb. paid for this class of leaf by the
Company hitherto has undoubtedly caused the growers to think that with better colours fetching
only 6d. more —not allowing for the bonus —there was no great advantage in reducing the output
by going in for the lighter leaf.
In reply to a question put to him by Mr. Bentley, Mr. Temple Smith stated :
269. The growers throughout Australia are producing only enough bright leaf to enable us to put about 24 per
cent. in. Every lb. of bright leaf produced is used? —With the prices now being paid we are likely to get a much
larger proportion of the bright leaf. I blame the British-Australasian Tobacco Company very largely for the quantity
of dark leaf produced, as compared with the bright leaf. The prices paid for the dark leaf have encouraged the growers
to produce it, as it was a better paying proposition. The dark leaf gives about twice the yield per acre. In one case a
grower obtained £250 per acre for dark tobacco, whereas from bright leaf the return was less than £lOO. When the
company guaranteed to take 600,000 lb. per year of the lower grade dark tobacco at a certain price it was an inducement
to the growers to produce it.
The Committee considers that a lower price for the dark ranging from 6d. to Is. per lb.,
and a much higher for bright mahogany, say 3s. to 4s. per lb., and say ss. for lemon-coloured,
offered by the manufacturer for a definite period—say the next five years —would enormously
stimulate the industry and ensure the speedy elimination of all but a small and unavoidable
percentage of dark, inferior tobacco.
FIXATION OF PRICES
93. The Committee did not receive any practical suggestions in the direction of price
fixation. Several witnesses favoured a valuation board, consisting of representatives of the
buyers and the growers, but failed to indicate how the board was to function in the interests
of the growers. In France there is a board which is called the Parity Commission, consisting
of representatives of growers and the Government, with an arbitrator in the event of disagreement.
The Federal Director, Mr. Slagg, dealt fully with its operations in this final appearance before
the Committee as a witness. It does not appear that the French system of price regulation
has resulted in great benefit to the grower, for in 1925 the average price paid by the State
tobacco monopoly for leaf grown in Fiance was 3.72 d. per lb., whilst the average price paid for
colonial and foreign was approximately 6.8 d.
The Committee considers that, in the present state of the Australian industry, the best
method of price regulation is by means of the tariff. It believes that with a larger margin of
protection, the buyers will be impelled to give reasonably good prices for all the better qualities
of local leaf to stimulate the production. This is evidenced by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company’s action in making its voluntary bonus, after the imposition of the additional import
duty in 1928 and 1929, on bright leaf, Is. per lb. on all leaf which sold at 2s. per lb. and over. If
the recommendation of the Committee is adopted regarding further protection for the local
industry, the buyers will almost certainly be induced to pay still higher prices for the bright
mahogany and lemon-coloured qualities.
Various witnesses complained that the absence of an arbitrator enabled the buyer to
alter the grading each year, in many individual cases, so as to bring the price of the better
qualities back to an average of under 25., thus enabling the manufacturer to escape the payment
of his voluntary bonus to an extent which he considered advisable in his own interest. While
there is no doubt this danger is always existent, the Committee does not see how it can be avoided
until there are more competitors for Australian leaf. No means appear to exist of compelling
the buyer —other than through active competition—to pay prices fixed by an arbitrator or a
valuation board. In France the industry is governed by a State monopoly, which renders the
buying problem much more simple ; and it is probable that the Parity Commission has no power
to enforce the payment of prices which the Government monopoly would consider excessive.
No Recommendation for a Bounty.
94. The Committee received very little encouragement to recommend a Federal bounty
on tobacco production. Apparently, since the conference of growers held at Canberra in May,
1928, made a request by deputation to the then Prime Minister (the Rt. Hon. S. M. Bruce),
for a bounty of 3d. per lb. on dark leaf, 6d. on bright mahogany and 9d. on lemon-coloured, or
or as an alternative further tariff protection, feeling has changed. Only one or two
witnesses expressed any favourable opinion towards a bounty, the great majority preferring the
abolition of the excise with additional duty on imported tobacco. The Committee therefore
makes no recommendation that a bounty should be considered as a practicable means
of stimulating the production of higher qualities of leaf in Australia. The British-Australasian
Company has been giving a voluntary bonus for the last three or four years, and the growers
generally appear to think this additional inducement should be regarded by the purchaser as
part of the real value of the leaf.

It will be seen from the foregoing statistics that Australian-grown leaf has not, until
recently, had a margin of protection against imported leaf sufficient to encourage the manufacturers
to offer more than moderate prices. It is true that a profit of as much as £lOO per acre is
regarded as satisfactory by the majority of growers, but as offset there have to be placed seasonal
adversities, heavy losses from blue mould and other pests, and the high cost of skilled white
labour. Many growers claim that they average only one profitable year in three, hence for the
risks encountered higher prices than those now being offered by the manufacturers for the
bright leaf, which generally yields less than half the dark leaf, are demanded.
New Tariff Policy Recommended.
98. The majority of the Committee unhesitatingly recommend a radical alteration of
the tariff policy in regard to imported and local unmanufactured tobacco. There appears to be
no valid reason for continuing excise, at least on tobacco for pipe smoking, and this has
undoubtedly had the effect of maintaining the large importations from America. It was not
until the tariff alteration of 1929, when an extra shilling was added to the import duty, that the
margin between the imported and local leaf was sufficient to encourage the manufacturers to
F. 218.—4


pay more attention to the growing of tobacco in Australia. Since that alteration, the British-
Australian Tobacco Company has increased its voluntary bonus to provide a further stimulus
to local growers to produce more of the higher classes of light leaf. The Committee believes
that, while 3s. per lb. is a good margin, it is insufficient to lift the industry out of its rut of
stagnation.
If the excise duty on all manufactured tobacco were abolished, there would, of course,
be a tremendous loss of revenue to the Commonwealth. The Committee considers the industry
is able to carry the present revenue which it is providing, with possibly a little extra if Government
necessities require it. Excise duty is a revenue-producing device, and not a protective method.
If the local industry were established excise could be safely levied, because the smoking public
is large and constantly increasing, almost in direct ratio to the growth of population. There
is little likelihood of a very heavy decline in tobacco consumption, as shown by the ever-
increasing output of the manufacturers in all countries, particularly in Australia, notwithstanding
that —in Australia at all events —prices have been heavily increased to the public. Manufacturing
costs have increased also, but the profits of manufacturers show no sign of diminishing.
Difficulties arise in lifting the excise off Australian-grown tobacco, but the Committee
considers it has suggested a practicable method. The manufacturer has to use local tobacco
largely in blending ; and until he is able to procure all his requirements locally he will not be
able to meet a heavy demand for 100 per cent. Australian. It would be difficult to estimate
the exact amount of local leaf used for differential excise purposes. The only way would be
to take each year’s percentage in each factory ; and as this percentage varies according to the
seasonal conditions, or the number of growers, there would have to be a constantly varying rate
of excise duty in order to maintain a fixed amount of revenue. It would, however, be a simple
matter to relieve from excise manufactures wholly Australian.
If the excise duty of 2s. 4d. per lb. on pipe tobacco were lifted and transferred over to the
import duty, the protection would be increased from 3s. to ss. 4d. on the present basis
of importations. This would involve a loss of revenue on Australian-grown tobacco. The
Committee finds that last year this revenue amounted to approximately £120,000 ; and as the
amount of local leaf used shows very little fluctuation year after year —the amount varying
only by a few hundred thousand pounds weight —the figure for last year would be fairly reliable.
There is a very effective answer to the contention that if the excise were to be added to
the import duty, the public would be unfairly burdened. The locally-grown leaf would have
to be placed on the market at a lower price than the imported ; consequently that section of
the public which declined to pay the price for imported tobacco would have an opportunity of
purchasing the local article which should be cheaper.
There is the aspect of future loss of revenue through decreased importations as loca*
production expands. This difficulty could be met by the re-imposition of excise duty upon
all manufactured tobacco in proportion to the loss on importations. The Committee does not
think the local production would be materially increased for at least twelve months, and perhaps
two years, during which time there would not be much reduction in importations, Year by
year, as the loss of revenue from the import duty increased, the excise duty could be
strengthened, so as to preserve a reasonable balance.
The Committee considers, however, that the local industry should be guaranteed immunity
from excise duty for a definite period —say three years —during which time the effect of the
protective policy could be gauged with some degree of accuracy. If the industry showed no
sati ffactory progress, the policy of tariff protection could be re-adjusted.
The Committee is satisfied that until this policy of effective protection is adopted oyer
a reasonable period, many of the problems which have exercised the various interests controlling
the industry for the last thirty years will never be definitely settled.
Comparative Cost of Local and Imported Bright Leap,
99. The Australian leaf has received the benefit of the import duty to the extent that the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company has been enabled to pay up to 3s. per lb. for bright leaf,
thus bringing the total cost of local tobacco up to that of the imported. This is borne out by the
evidence of Mr. Bentley, showing that the total cost of one pound of American bright leaf
ready for manufacture is 63.45 d., and the total cost of one pound of Australian bright leaf
ready for manufacture is 63.57 d. This reveals a difference at this stage at which both tobaccos
are ready for manufacture of one-eighth of a penny per pound in favour of American leaf.
The comparison made by the Company is based on an average price of 36.93 d. per lb.
being paid for Australian bright leaf; but it must be pointed out that in another statement
submitted by the Company the percentages of lemon and bright mahogany purchased by it for 1
the four years 1926 to 1929, were as f0110w5:—12.67, 16.71, 10.51, 19.92, and the average

from 137,000 lbs. in 1921 to
prices per pound were 25.3.95 d., 25.7.74 d., 25.7.47 d. and 35.0.93 d. respectively. It will be
seen therefore that only a comparatively small percentage of Australian leaf is purchased as
lemon and bright mahogany, and 1929 is the only year of the last four years that the
average price of 3s. per pound has been paid for this. It is desired by all parties that an
increased percentage of bright leaf should be produced in Australia. The Committee considers
that increased tariff protection, which should enable the buyers to pay a higher price for
this bright leaf, will tend to bring about the desired result much more rapidly than will
the present inadequate margin of protection.
Effect of Tariff Protection in other Countries.
100. A direct and phenomenal increase in production resulted in Rhodesia, Nyasaland,
Canada and Cyprus as a result of tariff protection. The Committee hopes that further tariff
protection in any of the forms recommended will bring about increased production of the
higher qualities of Australian leaf in the same definite degree as in the countries mentioned.
In this connexion the following extract from the Ninth Report of the Imperial Economic
Committee on Tobacco, is of interest as indicative of what has been accomplished by means of
protection :
A preference on Empire tobacco was accorded in September, 1919, by the grant of a rebate on one-sixth of the
full rate of import duty.
In 1925, the rebate was increased by 50 per cent, to one-quarter of the full rate, or to 2s. fd.a lb., and by the
Finance Act of the following year the preference was stabilized at this figure for ten years from Ist July, 1926. This
preference represents more than the value of the leaf itself in recent years. In Canada, where the local market for
leaf has expanded slowly, and the import of the leaf from America has increased, the growth in production is the result
of the grant of preference. In some of the newer countries on the other hand, notably Rhodesia and Nyasaland, it
is obvious that the effect of preference on production has been direct and phenomenal. The following table shows
the increase in production, subsequent to the introduction of preference in those countries of the Empire in which
there has been special development:—

In Cyprus production has multiplied twenty-three times in the last six years,

Alternative Tariff Recommendations.
101. The Committee makes the following alternative recommendations regarding further
tariff protection for the Australian tobacco-growing industry :
No. I—Abolition1 —Abolition of the excise duty now existing, viz., 2s. 4d. per lb. on tobacco
manufactured from imported and domestic leaf used other than in cigarettes
and cigars; leaving the excise duty of 7s. 3d. per lb. on machine-
made and 7s. on hand-made cigarettes as at present. No excise duty to be
imposed for the present upon machine-made and hand-made cigarettes from
leaf produced in Australia, including Turkish or other leaf grown in Australia
for blending purposes; the loss of excise revenue to be made good by extra
import duty upon unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco.
No. 2 —Excise duty on cigarettes, cigars and other manufactured tobaccos to be left
as at present, and import duty on unmanufactured and manufactured tobacco
to be increased so that no loss of revenue will be involved.
No. 3 —Abolition of the excise duty on tobacco, cigars and cigarettes manufactured
in Australia ; the loss of excise revenue to be made good by a proper
adjustment of import duties on all tobaccos, manufactured and unmanufactured.
Effects of Proposals.
102. The effect of the first proposal would be to maintain the existing excise duty, yielding
over £2,000,000 a year in revenue, on cigarettes which are manufactured from imported leaf.
The impost plus the import duty on unmanufactured leaf of 3s. per lb. now totals 10s. 3d. per lb.
If no excise were collected on cigarettes manufactured from all-Australian tobacco, there would
be a big inducement to manufacturers to experiment with local leaf for cigarettes. Up to the
present there has been no move in this direction, consequently there has been no special
inducement offered growers to produce types of leaf especially suitable for cigarette smoking.


With such a margin of protection, manufacturers could offer very attractive prices to growers
for light lemon-coloured leaf of the kind considered to be necessary for cigarettes. There would
be the difficulty that manufacturers would not be able to blend with imported leaf ; but as
Turkish tobacco is being grown in the Ovens district of Victoria—and is being used for blending
—it is probable that a cigarette 100 per cent. Australian with suitable blending could be
manufactured. This part of the tobacco trade is now the most important, and the market
appears to be rapidly expanding, due to the great increase in smoking by women. The local
manufacturer, therefore, would probably make a strong effort to avail himself of the protection
afforded him under this particular proposal.
The abolition of the excise duty of 2s. 4d. per lb. on manufactured tobacco, including
local leaf, would result in a loss of revenue estimated at about £1,600,000. It would be necessary
to make up this loss by additional import duty. The Committee does not consider there are
any difficulties in this direction. The result would be to exempt AustraHan-grown tobacco
from excise, thus increasing the measure of protection by much more than the present 3s. which,
as already shown, is not considered to be adequate on the figures relating to preparation for
manufacture supphed by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, and on the average prices
paid by the buyers for the higher quafities of leaf in the last few years. There is Httle doubt
that this alteration in the tariff would ehminate any complaint of the growers in regard to the
protection afforded them against foreign competition.
The effect of the second proposal would be to further increase the margin of protection
without any reduction of excise. It would also result in additional revenue to the Commonwealth
Government. One effect, however, would almost certainly be to increase the cost of imported
tobaccos to the pubhc. If this method were adopted, the increase would have to be substantial
to satisfy the growers.
The effect of the third proposal would be to give a very wide margin of protection to
AustraHan leaf used both in cigarette and pipe tobaccoes, while at the same time safeguarding
the revenue, notwithstanding the abolition of the excise duty on all manufactured tobaccoes,
cigarettes and cigars. In view of the fact that the excise duty of 7s. 3d. and 7s. per lb. on
cigarettes and 2s. 4d. on other manufactured tobaccos would not have to be paid, there would
not be any extra burden upon the consumers, unless the duty were fixed at a figure much above
the present combined excise and import duties. One advantage of this method would be that
manufacturers could use as much or as little AustraHan-grown leaf in their manufactured
commodities, particularly cigarettes, as they desired.
The Committee considers that either of the last two proposals could be carried out in a
simple and effective manner; but is satisfied that the first or third proposal would provide a
greater measure of effective protection for AustraHan growers.
The Committee recommends that one of the three proposals above-outHned should
be immediately adopted by the Commonwealth Government: the Committee itself having
preference for the third proposal.
CONCLUSION.
103. The enactment of the recommendations in this report will, the Committee feels
confident, not only provide considerable additional increased revenue for the Government, but
will establish tobacco-growing on a firm basis making it an industry which in time will
add considerably to land settlement and provide a greater and more prosperous industry to the
Commonwealth. In the United States of America, there are 460,000 tobacco-growers. In this
country there should be at least 10,000 white growers, the majority of whom should be capable
of producing an ever-increasing proportion of high grade bright leaf entirely suitable to the
manufacturers and wholly acceptable to the smokers of Australia.
104. The Committee places on record its appreciation of the work done during the inquiry
by the Clerk of Committees, Mr. S. F. Chubb, who displayed the utmost zeal and capabiHty as
its official secretary, and who organized the sittings and the presentation of evidence in a highly
efficient manner.
SUMMAEY OF EECOMMENDATIONS.
105. The following is a summary of the Select Committee’s principal recommendations :
No. 1. —That no bounty be paid by the Federal Government on AustraHan-grown
leaf;
No. 2.—That further protection be imposed by an alteration of the import and excise
duties by the adoption of one of the three alternative proposals submitted
by the Committee ; preferably by the aboHtion of the excise on leaf used in
manufacture in Australia, and the addition of an amount equivalent to the
excise so abolished to the import duty on all classes of tobacco entering
Australia.


No. 3. —That the Federal investigation work hitherto carried out with financial
assistance from the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd.,
should be carried on by a Federal Tobacco Department, presided over by
a Federal Director, who should be responsible only to a Minister, and
who should be in charge of all research and experimental work, and all matters
relating to the welfare of the tobacco growers. The British-Australasian
Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd., and any other manufacturing interests should be given
every opportunity to make special monetary contributions to the funds used
by the Department in research and experimental work.
No. 4. —That to assist the Director and give the growers a voice in the control of the
industry, an Advisory Council be formed, consisting of two growers’
representatives from each tobacco-producing State, the Directors of Agriculture
in each tobacco-producing State to be ex officio members ; the Federal Director
to be Chairman of the Council, which should hold meetings at Canberra at least
twice every year ; the Council to report in writing to the Minister after each
meeting.
No. 5. —That the present Director, Mr. C. M. Slagg, should be appointed as Federal
Director on a permanent basis, subject to salary and other conditions to be
fixed by the Minister.
No. 6. —That the head-quarters of the Federal Tobacco Department be established
at Canberra.

The fee shall be computed as from the first day of
January to the thirty-first day of December, and when
by reason of the time of the granting of the licence it
will not continue for a full year, the amount of the
fee shall be reduced proportionately.
2. By Mr. Morgan. —Have those particulars been
published already?— Excluding the list of holders of
manufacturer’s licences, they have been published at
various times in the Commonwealth Year-Booh and the
Overseas Trade Bulletin.
3. By Mr. Jones. —Has the percentage of Australian
leaf blended been published in the Year-Bookf —Yes,
in brief form, for the Commonwealth as a whole.
4. By the Chairman. —That is all the information at
the disposal of the Customs Department?—Yes.
5. Can you tell us from memory the value of the
tobacco now imported into Australia? —In 1928-29 it
was, roughly, £2,500,000, which was lower than the
value in 1927-28.
6. What is the reason for the decrease?—l can only
suggest that the manufacturers found 1927-28 a
favorable year to buy and increased their stocks.
7. Would the average value of importations for the
last ten years be about £3,000,000 per annum?— Yes.
8. Is the excise duty on leaf manufactured in Aus-
tralia collected when the tobacco is made up?— When
it is entered for consumption.
9. Can the manufacturer hold the manufactured
article for any period without notifying the depart-
ment?-—Yes, so far as I know. We are interested in
seeing that the requisite duty is paid on the tobacco
that goes into consumption. If it is not entered we
cannot claim any duty.
10. The department depends absolutely on the manu-
facturer’s notification? —There are excise officers in
attendance at the factories.
11. What steps are taken to ascertain the proportion
of purely Australian tobacco blended in manufacture
with the imported leaf? —The officer keeps a check on
all material going into the factory, and would be aware
from his records how much imported leaf and how
much Australian-grown tobacco was taken into the
factory.
12. By Mr. Morgan. —The officer would be able to
say that a certain quantity of leaf had been taken into
the factory, but would he be in a position to say
absolutely that it had been used in manufacture? —
I should think he would, but I am not an excise officer,
13. By Mr. Bentley. —l am under the impression
that the average annual value of imports of about
£3,000,000 includes not only the imported leaf but also
manufactured cigarettes and manufactured tobacco
of all kinds?—-That is so.
The witness withdrew.
Albert Cherhury David Rivett, M.A., D.Sc., Acting
Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation; and Chief
Executive Officer of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, was called, sworn and
examined.
14. By the Chairman. —You have a statement to
present to the committee?— Yes, the progress report of
the Australian Tobacco Investigation to January, 1930.
I regret that Mr. Gepp, the Chairman of the Executive
Committee, cannot attend to present this report. One
of the members of the Executive, Dr. Cameron, Chair-
man of our Standing Committee on Agriculture and
Director of Agriculture in Victoria, while agreeing
with the report broadly, reserves to himself the right to
disagree with a few opinions expressed in it. The
report is as-follows: —
PROGRESS REPORT OF THE AUSTRALIAN
TOBACCO INVESTIGATION TO JANUARY.
1930.
I.—THE STATUS OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY IN
AUSTRALIA.
(a) Peoduction of Raw Leaf.
The introduction of the seed of tobacco and its first cultiva-
tion in Australia would appear to have taken place at least
75 years ago. It is possible that migrating gold-miners
brought in seed and cultivated the crop for their own use.
Certain it is that all of the older districts are situated at,
or in the vicinity of, old gold diggings. On the other hand,
it seems probable that much of the earlier extensive planting
was for the purpose of making sheep dip. Once introduced,
tobacco-growing undoubtedly received its first impetus in the
decade 18G0-70, during and immediately after the civil war
in America, when leaf imports were greatly restricted.
The census records show that tobacco culture in Australia
has undergone marked fluctuations. It is ranked as one of
our minor crops, although at one time it gave promise of
occupying an important place in agriculture. In 1888-89 the
area under crop was stated to be 6,641 acres, including 4,833
acres in New South Wales, 1,685 acres in Victoria, and
123 acres in Queensland. This early expansion was, however,
not sustained, and the following years, while exhibiting wide
variations in acreage and production, showed generally a
downward trend. In 1920-21 the total Commonwealth acreage
was 1,345. In 1922-23 this increased to 3,727 acres, but since
then the area has declined until in 1927-28 only 2,133 acres
were devoted to the crop. Of this acreage, 803 acres were
in New South Wales, 1,176 acres in Victoria, 135 acres in
Queensland, 17 acres in South Australia, and 2 acres in
Western Australia.
(b ) Manufactuee.
The tobacco manufacturing industry has been firmly estab-
lished in Australia for many years. At the end of June, 1928,
there were 23 establishments (18 using machinery) in opera-
tion, employing 4,192 hands, who received wages totalling
£818,985 during the year 1927-28. The approximate value of
the land and buildings was £783,895, and of the plant and
machinery £510,651. The value of the raw materials used
reached the large sum of £4,492,363, including containers
for the finished product valued at £550,596. The total output
was valued at £6,817,391, and the value added to the raw
materials in the process of manufacture was £2,303,037.
It is gratifying to know that the manufacturing side of
the tobacco industry is satisfactorily established in Australia,
but, on the other hand, it is to be regretted that the pro-
duction of locally-grown leaf is comparatively small. Manu-
facturers are dependent on foreign-grown leaf for the majority
of their raw- materials. The quantities of domestic and
imported leaf, without stem, used during 1927-28 w r ere
1,007,089 lb. and 17,613,104 lb. respectively.
(c) Imposts and Expoets.
The imports of tobacco into Australia in 1927-28 totalled
25,944,905 lb., comprised of 23,682,640 lb. of raw leaf, with
stem; 946,350 lb. of cigarettes; 128,713 lb. of cigars; and
1,187,202 lb. of other manufactured tobacco (smoking, chewing
and snuff). The exports during the same period were almost
entirely of manufactured tobacco and totalled 730,792 lb.
During this same year there were manufactured in Australia
5,391,271 lb. of cigarettes, 390,336 lb. of cigars and 15,096,949
lb. of other tobacco (smoking, chewing and snuff). It may


thus be seen that Australia manufactures roughly 90 per
cent, of her tobacco requirements. At the same time it may
also be pointed out that Australia annually imports about
25,000,000 lb. of foreign-produced tobacco (mainly leaf) valued
at £3,000,000.
(d) Discussion.
From the above statistics it may be seen that while the
manufacturing industry is in a strong position, the tobacco-
growing industry has languished, and manufacturers are
dependent on imports of foreign leaf to satisfy Australian
consumers. Efforts to improve the industry must, therefore,
at present be centred on production, and should logically
deal with the improvement of quality and increase of the
quantity of Australian-grown leaf taken for manufacture,
until at least the major part of the cured leaf used in Aus-
tralian tobacco factories will be grown in Australia. When
this has been done, lucrative employment will have been
found for some additional thousands of tobacco-growers and
their families. Governmental effort in this direction should
cover experimentation to improve the quality of locally-grown
leaf, and to educate the manufacturing and consuming public
to its use. It cannot be over-emphasized that under present
conditions attempts to dictate to the consuming public are
foredoomed to failure. Even to change the taste of a part of
the smoking public in favour of a new tabocco mixture, which
we believe to be good, must be a gradual process requiring
patience and sustained effort.
lI.—THE ORIGIN AND ORGANIZATION OF THE
AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO INVESTIGATION.
(a) Early Tobacco Experiments.
Considerable experimental work to improve the quality
of Australian-grown tobacco has been carried on by various
State Governments and by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company. As early as 1897, Victoria engaged a tobacco
specialist from America to instruct the growers, and Vic-
torian growers have enjoyed the advice and assistance of State
tobacco specialists continuously since 1897. New South Wales
growers have, for an even longer time, been assisted by leaf
experts employed by the State Department of Agriculture.
For some years Queensland also employed a tobacco specialist,
but the importance of tobacco culture in other States has,
apparently, not warranted the employment of a full-time
expert, such work as required being done by officers whose
attention is also devoted to other agricultural activities. In
addition the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has
experimented independently from time to time over a long
period of years, and has spent many thousands of pounds in
an endeavour to improve the quality of Australian-grown
tobacco.
(b) The Origin of the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
Such was the position when, in evidence before the Tariff
Board in August, 1926, and in order to assist in the develop-
ment of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia, the follow-
ing offer was made by a representative of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, Pty, Ltd.:—
“The company will be quite willing to enter into a
definite agreement with any State Government or the
Federal Government to spend pound for pound, up to a
total of £50,000, in developing any district in Australia
which can satisfactorily demonstrate that it can grow
tobacco equal in quality to the tobacco now grown in
America and used by us at present in manufacture.”
This offer was referred officially to the Development and
Migration Commission by the Chairman of the Tariff Board.
The commission and the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research subsequently discussed this offer with the company,
with the result that on 14th April, 1927, a definite proposal
was submitted in writing by the company which even exceeded
the terms of its first offer.
A copy of the company’s letter is submitted, but, briefly,
the proposal was that over a first period of three years the
company would find £20,000 rateably with the sum of £lO,OOO
to be found by the Commonwealth and/or State Governments
for the purpose of carrying out investigations and field experi-
ments. If, at the expiration of the three-year period, develop-
ments were sufficiently encouraging to warrant further effort,
and additional expenditure was considered necessary and
desirable the company offered to make available a further
£30,000, conditionally upon the Commonwealth and/or State
Governments providing a similar amount.
This offer was submitted to the Commonwealth Government,
and on the 28th April, 1927, the Prime Minister informed
the Governments of the mainland States that the Common-
wealth Government was prepared to provide £5,000 of the
total £lO,OOO sought by the Tobacco Company from govern-
mental sources during the first three-year period, and he
suggested that the other £5,000 might be found by the
Governments of the five mainland States, in sums of £l,OOO
each.
The Prime Minister also intimated that if, at the expira-
tion of the three-year period, developments were sufficiently
encouraging to warrant further effort, his Government would
provide £15,000 to be extended over a second period of, perhaps,
five years, and he suggested that the five States referred to
should contribute £15,000 jointly, or £3,000 each to cover this
second period.
In other words, it was proposed that of the total of
£90,000 (if the full programme was to be carried out) the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company should contribute
£50,000, the Commonwealth Government £20,000 and the
Governments of the five States each £4,000.
These terms were accepted by the Governments of the main-
land States—the letter containing the offer of the tobacco
company constituting the basis of agreement—and steps were
immediately taken to organize the investigation.
(c) The Organization of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation.
Amongst the conditions of the offer by the company, which
were agreed to by the Commonwealth and State Governments,
were the following:—
1. That an Executive Committee shall be constituted
to be responsible for the policy and general direction
of this Investigation. This committee shall consist of the
Chairman or Vice-chairman or a member of the Develop-
ment and Migration Commission of the Commonwealth
acting in an honorary capacity, together with the Chair-
man or a member of the Executive of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, also acting in an
honorary capacity, and a third gentleman who shall be
appointed by the Development and Migration Commission
and the Executive of the Council for Scientific and Indus-
trial Research, acting conjointly, and who may be paid
such salary (if any) as may be determined by these two
bodies. This Executive shall have at its disposal the
moneys abovementioned, and shall be responsible for the
carrying out of the work in such manner as it may from
time to time determine.
2. That there shall be an Advisory Committee to the
abovementioned Executive, representative of the Depart-
ments of Agriculture of the various States which con-
tribute towards the expenses of the investigation, and that
one or more representatives from each State shall be on
this Advisory Committee as may be determined by the
Executive.
3. It is understood that the Investigation will cover
the whole question of the improvement in the quality
and the economic production of tobacco of various types
and grades in various parts of Australia. It should give
attention not only to the problem of soil and of plant
growth and of climatic conditions, but also to all economic
factors influencing the satisfactory and profitable produc-
tion of good quality tobacco in Australia. The board of
this company will make available to the Executive and
Consultative Committee as may be requested by the
Executive, any reasonable information in the possession
of this company relating to the growth and curing of
tobacco so far as it can be of use in connexion with this
important investigation.
4. The abovementioned Executive to arrange for the
appointment of a skilled investigator to be the leader in
this work, who should be responsible under the Executive
for the detailed programmes and for the supervision of
the specialists who will be dealing with the problems
both in the field and in the laboratory. Further, that
the specialists of the staffs of the Development and
Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research should be available for consultation,
from time to time, with the special staff engaged upon
this investigation.
The Executive Committee appointed comprises Mr. H. W.
Gepp (Chairman of the Development and Migration Com-
mission) as Chairman; Dr. A. C. D, Rivett, Chief Executive
Officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research;
Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, Director of the Botanic Gardens,
Sydney (in a salaried capacity) ; and Dr. S. S. Cameron
(Director of the Department of Agriculture, Victoria) in his
capacity as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Agricul-
ture of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
which comprises the heads of all the State Departments of


Agriculture. In addition, it was decided to confer, from time
to time, with a Consultative Committee comprised of the heads
of the mainland State Departments of Agriculture.
In view of the source of the major part of the tobacco
research fund, it is pertinent to note that the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company has made it quite clear that,
while it wishes to assist in every way possible, it does not
wish to advise, or to be considered as advising, with regard
to the experimental procedure of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation. Hence no nominee of the company is included
in the Executive Committee.
(d) Appointment of the Director of Investigations, thh
Research Committee and the Supporting Staff.
One of the first acts of the Executive Committee was to call
for applications throughout the world from fully trained
persons capable of directing the technical and scientific inves-
tigations contemplated under the agreement between the
various Governments and the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company. That of Mr. C. M. Slagg, who at the time of his
application was chief of the Tobacco Division of the Canadian
Department of Agriculture, was accepted, and he was engaged
for a period of three years as from 16th January, 1928. Mr.
Slagg, whose official title is now “ Director of Tobacco Inves-
tigations,” has had a lifelong experience of tobacco culture,
and has specialized in the study of tobacco diseases, having
carried out much important research work for the Canadian
and United States Governments and for other interests. He
arrived in Australia on Ist March, 1928. After discussions
with the Executive Committee and after having attended a
meeting of the Consultative Committee it was decided that he
should immediately make an inspection of the tobacco-growing
districts throughout Australia for the purpose of familiarizing
himself with local conditions and to enable him to prepare
his plans for the future conduct of the Investigation.
In addition to the Executive Committee abovementioned,
which controls the finance and general policy of the Investi-
gation and the Consultative Committee, a Research Committee
was also set up, the aim being to relieve the executive of the
necessity of deciding technical details, and to facilitate more
effective supervision of co-operative research.
A supporting staff, consisting of an agronomist, an
assistant-agronomist, an assistant plant pathologist and two
field supervisors has been appointed to date. Other office and
field assistance is also provided. The present personnel of the
Executive Committee, the Research Committee and the
Investigation staff are given below—
Executive Committee. —H. W. Gepp, Chairman of the
Development and Migration Commission (Chairman);
A. C. D. Rivett, M.A., D.Sc., Chief Executive Officer,
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; G. P.
Darnell-Smith, D.Sc., F.1.C., Director of the Botanic
Gardens, Sydney; S. S. Cameron, D.V.Sc., M.R.C.V.S.,
Chairman of the Standing Committee on Agriculture of
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
Research Committee. —C. M. Slagg, M.Sc., Director of
Tobacco Investigations (Chairman); B. T. Dickson, 8.A.,
Ph.D., Chief of the Division of Economic Botany, Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research.
Members of Staff. —C. M. Slagg, M.Sc., Director; V. F.
Olivier, B.Sc., Agronomist; G. E. Marks, Assistant-
Agronomist; A. V. Hill, B.Sc.Agr., Assistant-Pathologist;
R. W. Howell, Field Supervisor (Queensland) ; H, J.
Dimmer, Field Supervisor (Western Australia); S.
Fowler, Secretary to the Executive Committee; T. L.
McCrohan, Senior Clerk.
At present the head-quarters are located on the 6th floor
of the Commonwealth Railways Buildings, 150 Flinders-lane,
Melbourne. Some members of the staff are located away
from head-quarters, including Mr. R. W. Howell, at Mareeba,
Queensland; Mr. H. J. Dimmer, at Manjimup, Western Aus-
tralia; and Mr. A. V. Hill, temporarily at Tumut, New
South Wales. _ Office and laboratory space has been offered to
the Investigation by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research in the new buildings of the Economic Botany
Division at present under construction at Canberra. An area
of land has been set aside there for experimental purposes,
and it is also proposed that the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion contribute towards the cost of one of the greenhouse
units.
(e) Co-operative Relations.
In each of the five mainland States, the experimental work
is carried out in co-operation with the State Department
of Agriculture. Co-operative research in tobacco diseases has
already been arranged with the Economic Botany Division
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and
Dr. H. R. Angell, the Senior Pathologist of that Division,
has undertaken a study of the Blue Mould disease of tobacco.
One Assistant-Pathologist, Mr. A. V. Hill, has been assigned
to work with Dr. Angell, and other assistance is provided as
needed. The full cost of this disease work is borne by the
Tobacco Investigation. A portion of Dr. Dickson’s salary
and travelling expenses is also paid from Tobacco Investigation
funds, in return for his services as a member of the Research
Committee.
Contacts have been established with most of the universities,
and it has been possible to arrange for work in their research
laboratories. This has been mainly in the Universities of
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. It is hoped that this type
of effort may be extended.
(f) Aims of the Investigation.
The aim of the Australian Tobacco Investigation is the
improvement of the tobacco industry. It is evident from the
outset that three groups of people must be considered, namely,
the producers, the manufacturers and the consumers. The
interests of any one of these groups cannot with safety, nor
for long, be neglected. Nevertheless it is clear that we must
have adequate production before either manufacturer or
consumer can be satisfied. Therefore the present activities
of the Investigation deal almost entirely with production. It
is hoped to improve the quality and increase the quantity
•of home-grown tobacco taken for manufacture, until at
least the major part of the cured leaf used in Australian
tobacco factories will be grown in Australia. When this
point has been reached, the possibilities of an export market
can be considered. Australia enjoys, together with the other
self-governing Dominions and the Crown colonies, a preference
of 2s. per lb. less duty on all raw leaf tobacco exported to
the United Kingdom. Here is a large market at hand, pro-
vided the quality of locally-grown tobacco can be improved,
and its production placed on a sound economic basis, so that
it can compete on the English market with tobacco from
other parts of the Empire.
But our first aim must be to satisfy the Australian manufac-
turer. At present less than 10 per cent, of the raw leaf taken
for manufacture is home grown, despite the fact that tobacco
has been grown commercially in Australia for at least 60
years and that we have an import duty of 3s. per lb. on
raw leaf. Prior to August, 1929, the duty was 2s. It was
then raised to 2s. Bd., and in November last it was increased
to 3s. The improvement of tobacco in the existing commercial
areas, and the testing of new areas must, therefore, receive
major attention.
111. THE EXPERIMENTAL AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
OF THE AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO INVESTIGATION.
(A) General Scope of Work.
During the two years of the Investigation which have
elapsed, a staff of workers has been secured, and an organized
scheme of procedure planned and put into operation. A
chart of organization of activities is presented in Table I.
It should be stated that it has not yet been possible to start
work on all the phases of activity listed in this table. Never-
theless, 25 separate projects are already under way or to start
during the present fiscal year. Co-operative relations have
been established with the Departments of Agriculture of all
the five mainland States, and with the Economic Botany
Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
Exploratory and general agronomical field tests are under
way in each of the five mainland States of the Common-
wealth.
The exploratory tests consist of small plots of tobacco grown
outside the commercial areas at widely separate points where
soil and climate appear favorable, the idea being to ascertain
the smoking qualities of the leaf from these plots.
The field experiments are most extensive in New South
Wales and Victoria, because of the presence in these States
of the principal commercial producing areas. This field work
is concentrated at as few places as is possible. At present
field work in Victoria is mainly carried out at the State
Experimental Farm. Wahgunyah, at Myrtleford, and at
Pomonal. In New South Wales this work is located at the
Bathurst State Farm, at Tumut, and at Tamworth. In
Queensland the agronomical work is concentrated at Mareeba,
in South Australia at Mount Barker, and in Western Aus-
tralia at Manjimup.
The pathological work is at present being carried out at
Melbourne, Sydney, and Canberra, with seedbed disease tests
under way at Myrtleford, Victoria, and Tumut, New South
Wales.
The warehouse and factory tests to date have been made in
Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth, and the Investigation grate-
fully acknowledges the co-operation and assistance in these
packing and manufacturing tests, of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, Melbourne and Sydney; of Dudgeon and
Arnell, Melbourne; of G. G. Goode and Company, Melbourne;
and of P. Michelides, Perth.

I. Visit of a Member of the Executive {Dr. G. P. Darnell-
Smith) to the United States of America to inquire into
the Tobacco-growing Industry in that Country.
The Executive Committee arranged for one of its members,
Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, who had had some experience on
the scientific side of the tobacco-growing industry, to visit
the United States of America to study the methods employed
in the industry in that country, and particularly cultural
practices and soils. Dr. Darnell-Smith, with the approval of
the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, by whom
he was employed, left Sydney for San Francisco on 14tb
July, 1927, and returned via Vancouver, 8.C., arriving in
Sydney on 12th November, 1927. His impressions were pre-
sented to the Executive and Consultative Committees in the
form of a comprehensive report, a summary of which was
published in February, 1928, in the journal of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research. The full report in
bulletin form was published by the Australian Tobacco
Investigation in 1929.
2. Survey of the Tobacco-growing Industry in Australia.
As part of its plan for collecting essential data the
Executive Committee early decided to appoint a survey party
to collate details of areas, plantings, soil conditions, climatic
conditions, diseases and pests, types of tobacco grown, prices
obtained, and annual variations, &c. It was thought that
this information, which was intended solely for the informa-
tion of the Executive Committee and especially of the
Director, would save much time and enable him to obtain a
better and a quicker grasp of those details which must neces-
sarily constitute the basis of any scientific investigation, and
also advance by some months the date on which, working
without it, the necessary essential information regarding
Australian conditions would have been obtained.
A comprehensive questionnaire was prepared and personally
submitted to a great number of representative growers through-
out Australia. The officers engaged in this Avork, therefore,
were virtually census officers, and the information obtained,
which was of a highly confidential nature and is preserved
as such, has proved of great value to the Director of Investi-
gations, and has helped him and the Executive Committee
to reach an understanding of the scientific and economic
problems of the industry which it is hoped future inquiry
and experiments will solve.
The survey party consisted of Messrs. C. J. Tregenna,
tobacco expert of the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture; Temple A. J. Smith, tobacco expert of the
Victorian Department of Agriculture; R. W. Howell, a grower
with a long experience of tobacco-growing both in Australia
and the United States of America; and E. P. Bainbridge,
B.Agr.Sc., who collected soil data and samples for subsequent
analysis, under the direction of Professor Prescott at the
Waite Agricultural Research Institute, Adelaide. The report
on soils submitted to the Executive Committee by Mr. Bain-
bridge was published in the journal of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research in November, 1928.
The time occupied in the survey, including the collation of
the data collected, was five months.
3. Aroma Experiments at State Experimental Farm,
Bathurst, New South Wales.
Prior to the institution of the Australian Tobacco Investi-
gation, and as a result, it is understood, of discussions between
Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, Director of the Botanic Gardens,
Sydney; Mr. H. A. McGee, of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company Pty. Ltd.; and Mr. C. J. Tregenna, tobacco expert
of the Department of Agriculture, New South Wales, experi-
ments were carried out at the State Experimental Farm,
Bathurst, by the tobacco company with the co-operation of the
New South Wales Department of Agriculture with the object
of determining whether it is the soil or the climate which
gives Australian tobacco its alleged peculiar and unpleasant
aroma. American soil was imported for the purpose and a
number of plots established with this and Australian soils.
These experiments, which at the time of the appointment of
the Executive Committee had not been completed, were taken
over by the Australian Tobacco Investigation and further
work which will be described later is at present being carried
out.
4. Experiments vn Connexion with the Parasitic Disease
“ Blue Mould.”
Blue mould is the most serious disease of tobacco in Aus-
tralia, and has been known for many years. It is due to a
parasitic fungus which attacks both the young seedlings in
the seedbed and older plants in the field.
Realizing the importance and urgency of the problem of
combating or eradicating this disease, early action was taken
to institute experiments with the special object of determining
the method of primary infection in the seedbed, whether the
fungus mycelium over-winters in old tobacco roots and stems,
and the general location and method of germination of resting
spores. By courtesy of the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture a biologist was made available to the executive,
but the results of the preliminary experiments may be said
to be negative. This indicated the urgent need for further
work on the problem. This has been set in train, and further
reference will be made to it later.
5. Preliminary Experiments Designed to Test the Suitability
of the Soil and Climate of North Queensland for the
Growing of Tobacco Leaf of the Virginian Type.
For the purpose of ascertaining its suitability for the
growing of flue-cured leaf the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion, in conjunction with the Queensland Department of
Agriculture, arranged in 1927 for the planting of a number
of experimental tobacco plots in Northern Queensland.
Several farmers were induced to grow the leaf in relatively
small quantities—some small recompense being made for their
labour, &c. —and under the joint supervision of the executive’s
officers and officials of the Queensland Department of
Agriculture.
The preliminary results of this experiment were promising,
and gave encouragement to proceed with further tests which
are at present being carried out and to which reference will
be made later.


6. Report of Observations and Inquiries Relative to the
Tobacco Industry in the United States of America and
other Countries, by Dr. S. S. Cameron, Director of the
Department of Agriculture, Victoria.
During his visit abroad (July, 1927, to January, 1928) Dr.
S. S. Cameron, who is a member of the Executive Committee,
took advantage of such opportunities as offered to gain know-
ledge concerning the tobacco industry in various parts of the
world. The results of his observations have been presented
to the Executive Committee in the form of a report.
7. Inquiries into the Comparative Chemistry of Australian
and Virginian Tobacco Leaf.
With the object of determining to what substance or sub-
stances the differences in aroma may be due, the Investiga-
tion in 1927 arranged for preliminary inquiries to be con-
ducted into the comparative chemistry of Virginian and
Australian tobacco leaf by Professor James Kenner, F.R.S.,
University of Sydney, in consultation with Mr. A. R. Penfold,
curator of the Technological Museum, Sydney, who had
carried out work of a similar nature. Unfortunately, the
departure of Professor Kenner for England soon after its
commencement prevented the completion of the study.
8. Report by Imperial Institute, London, on Samples of
Australian Tobacco Leaf.
As part of their preliminary investigations and in view' of
the fact that there were so many conflicting opinions and
statements regarding the quality of Australian-growm tobacco,
the Investigation decided to select a number of representative
samples of Australian leaf and American leaf with a view to
obtaining an independent report by some such body as the
Imperial Institute, London. Eventually the samples were
despatched to the representative of the Development and
Migration Commission in England (Mr. F. L. McDougall,
C.M.G.), and at his request the Imperial Institute agreed to
do this work. Duplicate and triplicate samples of both Aus-
tralian and American leaf were retained in Australia, and
every precaution was taken to ensure that manufacturers and
others in England handling the leaf would have no knowledge
of the origin of the samples. The samples of American leaf
included in the parcel w 7 ere not selected to represent the
highest qualities of American leaf used by Australian manu-
facturers. They were chosen with a view 7 to “ matching ” the
Australian samples.
The report by the Imperial Institute on these samples of
tobacco, together with a confidential discussion of the report
by the Director of Investigations, is attached, A report on
these samples is also made on pages 12-19 of Bulletin No. 2
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
9. Experiments to Determine the Relative Merits of Vita
Glass and Plain Glass used as Seedbed Coverings.
It is understood that vita glass, while being as transparent
to visible light as is ordinary glass, transmits a large part
of the ultra-violet rays to wdiich ordinary glass is opaque.
This together with the knowledge that research carried out at
the Kew 7 Gardens had demonstrated that the use of vita glass
gave easier germination and stronger plants, gave rise to the
thought in the minds of the Executive Committee that it
might have an important reference to blue mould.
Accordingly a quantity of vita glass was purchased and
arrangements made for a test at the State Experiment
Farm, Bathurst, New South Wales. These experiments,
how 7 ever, did not disclose that vita glass possesses any special
virtues over ordinary glass for the purpose of growing tobacco
seedlings under Australian conditions, and a subsequent test
has confirmed this conclusion.
(c) The Plan or Field Experimentation, Season of
1928-29.
It will be remembered that soon after his arrival in Aus-
tralia it was decided that the Director of Investigations should
make a personal inspection of the tobacco-growdng districts
throughout Australia for the purpose of familiarizing himself
with local conditions and to enable him to prepare his plan
of campaign. This inspection w 7 as carried out, and, after a
study of the data collected by the survey party, and after
discussions with the State tobacco experts who accompanied
him through their respective territories, and with the heads
of the Departments of Agriculture, the Director submitted to
the Executive Committee a tentative plan of field experimen-
tation. This was approved and put into execution with the
concurrence and co-operation of the State Departments.

(g) General Discussion of Work to January, 1930.
Foreword.
From the outline of experimental work and from the project
list may be seen the types of work under way and their
general location. Many of these projects are only just start-
ing, and on several others the results thus far secured are
so fragmentary and indefinite that they do not warrant exten-
sive discussion. Those phases of work upon which a fair
amount of data has been secured, or those in which the data,
though limited, appear significant, are, it is hoped, treated
in sufficient detail to be adequately understood.
1. Exploratory Test Plots.
These tests are carried out in districts not now producing
;obacco commercially to ascertain the possibilities of new
ireas where the rainfall, climate, and soil appear favorable.
The area used in each case is small, comprising from 100 to
100 plants, and the person on whose land the test is conducted
s paid £5 to recompense him for the use of the land and
: or his labour in caring for the plot throughout the grooving
season. Plants or seed of a suitable variety of flue-cured
;obacco are furnished by the Investigation, which also arranges
! or curing where necessary. If no suitable curing facilities
ire available within one day’s transportation distance, small
oest curing kilns are erected at strategic points. All the cured
leaf is despatched to head-quarters as soon as cured, where
tests are made on burn, ash and aroma of the various grades
of leaf from each plot, and data recorded on the texture,
eolour, and appearance of the cured leaf.
These exploratory tests are now under way in all the main-
land States. The soils selected are sands or sandy loams, in
districts where the rainfall, for the most part, may be con-
sidered adequate. A few of the plots, however, are located
in districts where irrigation is necessary. Areas on which
tests have been and/or are being made include the Mareeba,
Chillagoe, Herberton, Atherton, Townsville, Charters Towers,
Bowen, Mackay, Rockhampton, Gladstone and Bundaberg
districts in Queensland; the Grafton, Tuncurry, Bulladelah,
Gosford and Mangrove Mountain districts in New South
Wales; the Weeragua, Orbost, Flaggy Creek, Shepparton,
Bendigo and Wimmera districts in Victoria; the Mount
Gambier, Millicent, Penola, Naracoorte, Mount Barker, Wood-
side and Upper Murray districts in South Australia; and the
Manjimup, Port Augusta, Nornalup, Denmark, Mount Barker,
Broome Hill and Geraldton districts of Western Australia.
The North Queensland exploratory plots were begun in
1927-28, the Victoria, South Australia and Western Aus-
tralia plots in 1928-29, and in 1929-30 all five mainland States
are included.
Results—Queensland 1927-28.
Weather conditions were favorable for tobacco on most
of the North Queensland areas. Fair growth was obtained
and cured leaf secured from a total of 25 plots. The excep-
tions were at Chillagoe, where the plants were stunted by
drought; in the Mackay and Rockhampton districts, where it
was impossible to harvest the leaf, due to continued floods;
at one or two points where too fertile a soil had been used,
and two plots which were destroyed by stem grubs. Frost
cut down one plot on high ground at Mount Garnet after
the first picking of leaf had been harvested.
Nematodes were numerous and widespread. While they
did not not appear to injure the colour or smoking qualities
of the cured leaf, they doubtless lowered the texture and
yield of leaf. The heaviest nematode infestations were noted
at Herberton, Mount Garnet, Binbee and Charters Towers.
Although some infestation was found even on virgin soils,
nematodes were much more numerous on plots which had
been under cultivation previously with other crops.
A heavy infestation of Blue Mould ( Peronospora nicotianae
Wilson an Speg.) was noted in May, 1928, on volunteer
tobacco at Herberton. This is of interest, since it indicates
that this disease may be serious even in North Queensland.
It is, however, possible that it may not do serious damage
under the higher field temperatures during the North Queens-
land summer.
A small test kiln was erected at Mareeba, and leaf from
most of the plots was flue-cured there. It was not possible,
because of the distance, to cure much leaf from the Towns-
ville, Bowen and inland districts, but small lots of leaf
from these distant plots were transported to Mareeba and
sufficient flue-cured leaf secured for testing purposes.
After the flue-curing of leaf from the widely distributed
plots had been completed, each lot of tobacco was carefully
graded as to texture into lugs, cutters, wrappers and fillers;
*nd as to colour into lemon, orange, bright mahogany,
mahogany and dark. Short and long grades were also made
when necessary, and some nondescript leaf necessitated a
separate classification.
In general, the texture and colour of the 1928 experimental
leaf from North Queensland was quite good. A high percen-
tage of bright colour was obtained, and in addition to a fair
quantity of thin cuttery tobacco, the fillers and wrappers
showed good elasticity and the quality of retaining pliability
and a soft velvety feeling even when exposed to a dry
atmosphere for long periods. Smoking tests were made on
all samples, and the burn and ash were found excellent. The
aroma, while different from American tobacco, and also
different from the aroma of tobacco thus far tested from other
parts of Australia, was for the most part mild and not
definitely objectionable.

Results : 1929. —All of the Queensland 1928 lots were
retested for smoking qualities after twelve months ageing in
a packed condition. The aged samples were compared directly
with the samples cut from the freshly-cured leaf in 1928. In
nearly every case the aroma was found to be better in the
aged samples. The aroma was mellower, and better rounded
out, lacking much of the sharpness and pungency exhibited by
the samples cut before ageing.
1929 Queensland Plots. —In addition to leaf grown at
Mareeba, a total of five outside plots was also cured and
tested. Extremely wet weather during the growing season
interfered seriously with the growth of all plots except those
at Chillagoe. However, some leaf was secured from most of
the areas, and smoking tests made. Due to the unfavorable
season, the leaf texture was much heavier than in 1928. The
leaf colours, however, were better, due to the fact that there
were larger lots of leaf available for curing at one time, and
to a new and better curing kiln being built. Two private
kilns were also constructed, one at Hervey’s Range, near
Townsville, and one at Charters Towers. Most of the leaf
grown at Hervey’s Range, and all of that grown at Charters
Towers and Pentland, was cured in these kilns. One small lot
of Hervey’s Range tobacco was transported to Mareeba and
cured there. The summarized data on leaf texture, colour and
aroma follow:
Texture. —Of seven exploratory test plots in North Queens-
land in 1928-29, two, or 29 per cent., were rated as possess-
ing a very good texture, and five, or 71 per cent., as having
a good texture.
Colour. —8 per cent, was lemon, 76 per cent, was orange,
10 per cent, was mahogany, and 6.5 per cent, was dark.
Aroma. —Of a total of 33 lots tested, 82 per cent, were
rated as possessing a mild and agreeable aroma, 15 per cent,
were passable or fair, and 3 per cent, possessed an indifferent
to poor aroma.
Results: 1929 —Victoria.
Very little leaf of cutter texture was secured from the
exploratory test plots in Victoria this year. The Gippsland
lots, for the most part, were disappointing, although one plot
from Kowat, near the New South Wales border, showed
promise. Extremely poor growth was secured at Dimboola,
in the Wimmera, and no leaf was cured from this plot. Of
all the exploratory test plots, best results were secured at
Kowat and at Shepparton,
Texture. —With regard to texture, of the eight exploratory
test plots, two, or 25 per cent., were rated as fairly good, and
six, or 75 per cent., as poor.
Colour. —o.l per cent, was classed as lemon in colour, 16
per cent, as orange, 58 per cent, as mahogany, 3 per cent, as
dark and 23 per cent, as nondescript.
Aroma. —Of the 34 separate lots in these exploratory tests
the smoking tests showed 18 per cent, as possessing a mild
and agreeable or good aroma, 21 per cent, with a fair or
passable aroma, 23.5 per cent, with an indifferent or poor
aroma, and 38 per cent, with a definitely bad aroma.
Results: 1929 —South Australia.
Extremely dry weather interfered seriously with the growth
of tobacco on the exploratory test plots put out in the south-
eastern part of the State. The leaf textures and colours
were very poor and the smoking qualities bad. But one lot,
grown at Woodside, could be rated as fair.


Texture. —Of the 15 plots in this series one, (or 6.7 per
cent.), was rated as fair, the remainder being poor or very
poor.
experiment is being conducted at Wahgunyah, Victoria;
Bathurst, New South Wales; Mareeba, Queensland; and
Manjimup, Western Australia.
Colour. —Of the total leaf graded 34 per cent, was classed
as mahogany, 59 per cent, as dark, and 7 per cent, as non-
descript.
Results. —As was to be expected, the data thus far secured
indicate that different types of seedbeds are necessary in the
various areas in which the tests have been located. Some
cover appears advisable for the seedlings during germination
and early growth stages in all districts, but for different
reasons. In North Queensland protection from the intense
sunlight is essential, in New South Wales and Victoria the
young seedlings must be shielded from low temperatures.
In some cases the disease factor enters and becomes of
importance.
Aroma. —5.6 per cent, of the lots tested were rated as having
a passable or fair aroma, 56 per cent, as having an indifferent
to poor aroma, and 39 per cent, as being definitely bad.
Results; 1929 —Western Australia.
Dry weather during the growing season interfered with the
growth of many of the exploratory tests plots put out in
Western Australia. A fair quantity of leaf was secured from
most of the plots, however, and data taken on texture, colour
and smoking qualities. Due to the dry season, the leaf tex-
ture generally -rated no better than fair, and the colours
were much darker than would otherwise have been the case.
Nevertheless the mahogany grade for Western Australia leaf
was_ a better tobacco than this same grade from other States,
having a light cast. The smoking aroma was fairly good.
Texture. —20 per cent, was fairly good, 25 per cent, fair, 30
per cent, poor and 25 per cent, very poor.
In North Queensland, we are testing a seedbed raised
entirely off the ground, and with a heavy canvas duck cover-
ing, which can be rolled up when desired. This, system has
been devised to afford protection from beating rains and to
combat a serious stem rot disease which played havoc with
plants both in the seedbed and in the field in 1928-29. The
heavy cover is used, however, only after the rainy season
starts, and is planned to protect the plant bed from the
torrential downpours frequent at that time. In addition to
this heavy cover, which is not used during the early part
of the season, the North Queensland tobacco seedbed requires
other protective cover during the germination and early
growth of seedlings. Present indications are that this cover
may be adequately supplied by loosely woven hessian. Cheese-
cloth may be used, but appears less advantageous, due to the
higher temperatures engendered. The loosely woven hessian
affords protection and also better ventilation, and appears
to lower the seedbed temperature. After the plants are about
half grown, all cover may be gradually removed. The seed-
lings may thus be hardened to withstand better the field
conditions when transplanted.
Colour. —1.1 per cent, was lemon, 11 per cent, was orange,
62 per cent, mahogany, 5 per cent, dark, and 21 per cent,
nondescript.
Aroma. —Of a total of 35 lots tested, 40 per cent, were
mild and agreeable, 29 per cent, passable or fair, 29 per
cent, indifferent to poor and 3 per cent, were bad.
1928-29 Exploratory Test Plot Summary.
The following tables show in summarized form the data
for 1928-29 from the exploratory test plots in the different
States. It must be pointed out, however, that it is very
difficult to assort properly into a small number of classes of
texture and colour, leaf produced on different and widely
separated soils. The aromas encountered are also of widely
differing character, even when mild and agreeable.
At Bathurst vita glass did not appear to have any advan-
tage over ordinary glass as a cover for the tobacco seedbed.
The temperatures engendered in the bed were too high, and
the plants tended to grow spindly and weak. It was difficult
to give the plants sufficient ventilation to protect them from
burning, and no amount of watching could entirely prevent
damage. Ordinary glass or heavy oiled cotton gave the
best results. Open beds cannot be grown at Bathurst because
of frost injury.

At Wahgunyah the trials thus far conducted indicate that
some cover is advisable for the tobacco seedbed in Victoria,
particularly during the first half of the plant-growing season.
The ordinary method, as used in Victoria, of growing tobacco
seedlings without cover, appeared the least advantageous of
any method tried. Both cheesecloth and glass gave good
results. The indications are at present that considerably
earlier plants may be grown under glass, and that they will
be sufficiently hardy if uncovered for a week before transplant-
ing. The best and hardiest (though somewhat later) plants
were grown under cheesecloth.

This test is designed to ascertain the most favorable date
for sowing the tobacco seedbeds in certain areas where tobacco
is grown, or where other experimental work is under way.
Tobacco seed is sown in the beds at different dates, and notes
taken on the rate of growth of the seedlings, and the date at
which they are ready for transplanting into the field. The
experiment is under way at Mareeba, North Queensland, and
at Manjimup, Western Australia. Some preliminary data

Results. —In North Queensland the time of sowing tobacco
seedbeds is governed by the time the rainy season begins.
This is usually during the latter half of December, but varies
considerably from year to year. It has also been ascertained
that germination and seedling growth take place much more
rapidly in North Queensland than in the tobacco-growing
districts of the south. Under ordinary conditions, seedlings
are ready to be transplanted into the field at Mareeba six
weeks after the seed is sown, and this period may be shortened
by forcing methods. It cannot, however, be materially
lengthened. For this reason, seeding prior to November is
impracticable, because the plants cannot be transplanted into
the field until the soil has been wetted by the first rains.
Due to the variable advent of the rainy season, it seems
advisable to sow at least two lots of seedbeds, one about
10th November, and a second a fortnight later. Whether later
sowings would be feasible has not yet been determined.

2. Types of Tobacco Seedbeds.
This experiment was designed to ascertain the relative
merits of various types of seedbeds in the production of
tobacco seedlings. Earliness, hardiness and number of plants
secured were the main factors under consideration. The
tobacco seedlings are grown in beds, raised and unraised,
with boarded sides or in the open, and covered with glass,
vita glass, cheesecloth, hessian, heavy oiled cotton, and no
cover.
In Western Australia convincing results have not yet been
obtained. Much appears to depend on the distribution of
rainfall during the transplanting season. This experiment is
closely allied with that dealing with favorable dates for trans-
planting into the field. At least a part of the seedbeds might
well be sown in the latter part of July or early in August,
so as to have some early plantings which would mature in
midsummer.
Not all of these tests are uvder way in any one place, as
local environmental conditions have necessitated variations
in procedure. With variations in plan and scope, the
Not enough work has been done on this project in New
South Wales and Victoria to justify any statements.

4. Seedbed Soil Treatments.
A number of seedbed soil treatments have been tested to'
find those best suited to the production of clean, healthy
plants in the present producing areas of New South Wales
and Victoria. Tobacco seedlings have been grown on hot-
beds, semi-hotbeds, and ordinary soil; and sterilized with
steam and with formalin, as compared with no treatment.
These trials have been under way at Wahgunyah, Victoria;
Bathurst, New South Wales; and Mareeba, Queensland.
Results. —At Wahgunyah the earliest plants were grown on
steam sterilized hotbed soil. All the steam sterilized plots
were earlier than those not steamed. The semi-hotbed did
not give good results in 1928 at either Wahgunyah or
Bathurst, and also produced weak yellow plants at Wahgunyah
in 1929. Some evidence was secured at Bathurst, however,
that lack of success with the semi-hotbed in 1928 may have
been due to too thin a layer of top soil. The seedlings at
Bathurst in 1929 were better on the semi-hotbed than on
ordinary soil.
Steam sterilization of seedbed soil gave better results at
Mareeba, North Queensland, than sterilization with formalin
at the rate of 1 to 50.
5. Date of Planting.
This experiment is planned to ascertain the most favorable
date for transplanting tobacco into the field in various parts
of Australia where the crop is or may be grown. Tobacco
seedlings are transplanted into experimental plots at intervals
of a week or a fortnight, after danger of frost is past, or,
in areas where frost is not a factor, at various dates through-
out the year. Notes are taken on the comparative growth,
period to reach maturity, yield, quality of cured leaf and
smoking qualities. At present work on this project is being
carried out at Pomonal, Victoria; Mareeba, Queensland; and
at Manjimup and Geraldton, Western Australia.
Results. —All early planting tests in the 1928-29 season
at Mareeba were failures. No plantings took root and with-
stood the sun’s heat except those put out after the rains
started, despite hand watering. It seems evident that no
field planting in North Queensland can be done until the
advent of the rainy season, and that then the transplanting
should be completed as rapidly as possible.
Variable results have been secured in Western Australia,
and it appears that the success or failure of any planting is
greatly influenced by the distribution of rainfall throughout
the season. Conditions in September and October of the
present season favoured early plantings, and much of this
tobacco was harvested during December.
Tobacco planted on Ist October at Pomonal, Victoria, was
ready for the first picking of leaf by Christmas. If continued
success is obtained from such early plantings, it may be
possible to produce tobacco at Pomonal with much greater
certainty. Much of the present difficulty in this district is
due to hot dry weather during midsummer, and if the plants
can be put out early enough to make most of their growth
in advance of the hot weather a crop would seem assured. It
seems doubtful if this method can be adopted in all localities,
however, because of the dangers from late frosts.
6. Machine versus Hand Planting.
In Victoria and in the Tumut district of New South Wales
machine-planting is generally practised. In the northern
district of New South Wales hand-planting is usually fol-
lowed. The particular method which will give the best results
in any district will, of course, vary according to local con-
ditions. Comparisons of machine and hand planting are
under way in Victoria, Queensland, and Western Australia,
and are planned for other points.
7. Winter Planting Trials.
It is hoped to carry out several trials of planting tobacco
during the winter at localities where climate and rainfall
permit. There are areas in which seemingly suitable soils
exist, where summer planting is not feasible, and where winter
conditions may be favorable for the growth of tobacco. At
present only two winter planting trials have been made, and
both were unsuccessful.
8. Variety Tests.
As the heading implies, this experiment is a test of tobacco
varieties primarily to determine which flue-cured variety or
varieties may be best adapted to each district. A number of
flue-cured varieties, including sorts standard in America and
Canada in comparison with local varieties, are planted at
several points in the mainland States, both in the present
commercial areas and in new districts showing promise.
Records are taken on their characteristics, on their compara-
tive growth throughout the season, on their uniformity and
earliness of maturity, yield and quality, and smoking
qualities.
These tests were carried out in 1928-29 at Wahgunyah,
Myrtleford, Cheshunt, and Pomonal in Victoria; at Bathurst
and Tamworth in New South Wales; at Mareeba in Queens-
land; at Mount Barker in South Australia; and at Manjimup
in Western Australia.
In Victoria a fairly good test was secured at Wahgunyah,
while those at Myrtleford and Pomonal rated somewhat less
than fair, and Cheshunt was a failure. In New South Wales
a good test was secured at Bathurst, although the season was
unfavorable. At Tamworth the results were poor, although
some leaf was secured for testing. In Queensland, flood water
destroyed the test at Mareeba just before the first picking
was ready for harvest. On basis of field growth and
appearance, however, all the standard flue-cured sorts gave
good results. The New South Wales variety “ Dunbur ” was
the only sort tested that seemed definitely unsuitable. In
South Australia a number of early plantings failed due to lack
of rain. Some of the later plantings, put in following a light
shower, made a good stand, and a fair amount of leaf was
secured. In Western Australia a good stand was secured,
and the plants made a fair growth despite the abnormally
dry season. Hickory Pryor and Adcock matured somewhat
earlier than other varieties, and yellowed up well in the field.
The various lots of leaf in this test were carefully graded
and notes taken on texture, colour, and smoking qualities
of all samples. Composite tables showing the ranking of the
different varieties tested as to texture and colour, and smoking
qualities are appended: —

The tables above shown illustrate the comparative texture
and colour, and smoking qualities of the different varieties
in each locality. In addition to this information, tables
have been prepared showing the actual percentage of colour
obtained in each variety in all the 1928-29 tests, and the
percentage of all lots tested in each variety having mild and
agreeable, passable or fair, indifferent to poor, and bad or
objectionable aroma. These data have been collated for seven
varieties that have been widely grown and included in nearly
every test.

In presenting the data in the foregoing tables it must be
emphasized that these tests cover one year’s work only.
Certain of the Canadian and American varieties appear to
have given fairly good results, whereas certain Australian
varieties did not show to advantage. It should be noted that
no yield data are included. Yield data were taken wherever
possible, but in many of the New South Wales and Victoria
tests Blue Mould and other factors made the stand so uneven
that yield data were entirely unreliable; hence they were
discarded. It can be stated, however, that wherever yield data
were taken the Australian varieties yielded as well as or
better than the imported sorts. The advantages accruing to

9. Longevity of Nicotiana Tabacum.
Tobacco is grown commercially as an annual, but under
natural conditions in Australia practically all plants will live
for two years, and many of them probably much longer in
districts where heavy frosts do not occur. Observations were
begun on a series of plants at Bathurst, New South Wales, in
1928, but these were accidentally ploughed under in 1929,
so that these observations will have to be repeated. Other
observational evidence, however, indicates that at least
a proportion of the plants can live for three years, and some

Smoking Qualities of Australian Tobacco.
Percentages.
The object of this experiment is to ascertain the texture,
colour, and smoking qualities of tobacco produced in various
parts of Australia. Four hand samples of each grade made by
growers from a number of representative crops in each growing
district are collected. Other similar samples are also selected
from tobacco grown experimentally in districts not yet
important commercially. After taking notes on colour and
texture, a portion is selected for preliminary testing, and the
remainder packed away to age for twelve months, when a
second test is made. In testing for smoking qualities, four or
five representative leaves in each grade are brought to
approximately 20 per cent, moisture, the midribs removed,
and the leaf shredded finely with a small Himoff tobacco
cutting machine. Cigarettes are rolled and comparative data
on the burn, ash, and aroma of each sample are taken.
Observations on smoking qualities are made independently by
several testers, and further careful tests made wherever

leaves are about 11 per cent, heavier after curing than leaves


cured on the stalks. This observation was made on air-cured
leaf. In the process of flue-curing, which is much more rapid,
it is likely that the difference in yield would not be as marked.
Nevertheless, there should be some difference in favour of the
picked leaf. Leaf cured on the stalk would, doubtless, carry
a higher proportion of gum to starch, since the metabolic
activity of stalk-cured leaves would continue slightly longer,
even in flue-cured tobacco, which would tend to reduce the
starch content. Exact data on the comparative yield, texture,
colour, and smoking qualities of leaf harvested and flue-cured
by these two methods are not available, and it is to gather
such information that this test is designed.
15. Height of Topping.
It is well known that low topping produces a thicker,
heavier leaf, with probably a stronger aroma than that of
similar leaves on plants topped higher on the stalk. In
the _ production of thin cigarette leaf, low topping is to be
avoided. High-topped plants usually mature more slowly,
and the yield may be reduced. This test is planned to study
the comparative effects of high and low topping on all leaf
factors, but particularly on the aroma of the flue-cured leaf.
16. Effect of tuckering on Yield and Quality.
After the flowering top is broken out of the tobacco plant,
vegetative shoots spring from the axils of the leaves, and,
if allowed to grow*, will reach the flowering stage in from three
to four weeks. These shoots are called “ suckers.” During
their period of growth, they require considerable nourishment,
particularly when they become large and approach the flower-
ing stage. If they are not removed, the yield and quality
of the resulting leaf may be lowered. It has been noted
that leaves of plants kept free from suckers developed more
aroma than plants on which the suckers are allowed to grow
unchecked after topping. An experiment to test the effect
of the sucker growth on yield and quality under Australian
conditions has been planned, and it is expected that the first
data will be available in 1930.
17. Flue-curing Primed Tobacco.
The process of flue-curing is one requiring considerable skill
on the part of the operator. Exact rules are difficult to for-
mulate, as variations in procedure have to be adapted to
suit the nature of the leaf being cured and the existing weather
conditions. It is felt, however, that there may be certain
general rules laid down for (1) light to medium leaf, and
(2) medium to heavy leaf, in the different districts, and that
steps should be taken to ascertain in a general way the most
suitable methods to follow for each separate growing district.
By varying the respective periods of time and temperatures
devoted to the (a) yellowing, (6) fixing the colour, and
(c) killing out processes, it is hoped to determine those best
suited to light and to heavy leaf. This work can best be
carried out -where several kilns and a considerable quantity
of tobacco are available. It is a type of work requiring a
period of years before results of practical value can be
expected, but nevertheless work of great value to the industry.
18. Flue-curing Stalk Tobacco.
The object of this experiment is the same as that of the
test outlined above. In tobacco harvested by the stalk-cut
system, however, the procedure must be varied, particularly
during the latter part of the cure. ' In addition to the three
periods as outlined for curing primed leaf, a fourth period
is usually ascribed to the flue-curing process for stalk-cut
tobacco, _ called “ killing out ” the stalks. With stalk-cut
tobacco it is also often necessary to lengthen all periods some-
what, due to the effect of the large sappy stalk to which
the leaves are attached during curing.
19. A Test of the “Marks" Seedbed.
During the winter of 1928 it was decided to test out the
“ Marks ” system of growing piants to ascertain if a satis-
factory measure of control of the blue mould disease could
be effected thereby. Arrangements were accordingly made
with the Victorian Department of Agriculture whereby Mr.
G. E. Marks, who was at that time an officer of the depart-
ment, was made available to supervise the erection of the
seedbed and observe the young seedlings during their growth.
Later Mr. Marks joined the staff of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation.
According to the “ Marks ” method, the seedbed consists of a
shallow wooden box frame filled with soil and raised off the
ground. A metal trough at the edge of the frame feeds metal
pipes which penetrate the soil, and all water is applied to
the soil through these underground pipes. The whole is
enclosed in a glass-covered hotbed frame, and the air tem-
perature of the interior of the hotbed frame is maintained
at a higher and more uniform figure than the outside air
by use of a heating unit situated at one end, and by hot
water pipes circulating around the interior. The seedlings
are grown in the soil of the interior frame and watered
through the underground pipes.
For the purposes of this experiment automatic recording
hydrographs and thermographs were located both inside and
outside the glasshouse. In addition, wet and dry bulb ther-
mometer readings were taken twice daily, at 8 in the morning
and 5 in the evening.
Results. During the first experiment, from August to
November, 1928, seedlings of the Warne variety were grown
in both the inside bed and an outside bed. Heat was started
in the glasshouse on 22nd September, and four weeks later
the plants had reached 6 inches in height and were of suitable
size for transplanting into the field. On 18th October, 1928,
an area 3 feet wide by 6 feet long in each of the outside and
inside beds was inoculated by spraying with a water sus-
pension of blue mould spores. Mould appeared on the outside
beds on 24th October, and spread from the inoculated section
to all parts of the bed, which rapidly succumbed. In a fort-
night, only a few green plants could be seen, and in three
weeks after inoculation ail plants were dead. A few spots
of mould appeared in the inoculated part of the glasshouse
on 3rd November, and also at one spot not inoculated, where
Mr. Marks stated that water had dripped through the sash.
Whether these were primary or secondary infections is
problematical. On 9th November, all the plants in the
inoculated sash_ were drawn and examined, and of a total
in’ 433 piants, nine, or 2 per cent., were found to be infected.
During the period 22nd October to Bth November, 1928,
inclusive, the mean air temperature for the glasshouse bed
was 82.0° F., while the mean air temperature for the outside
beds was 01.5° F. The minimum temperature recorded for the
glasshouse bed was 63° F., while that of the outside bed was
38° F. The relative humidity of the air in the glasshouse
beds averaged 55.7 per cent, throughout the period, while
that of the outside air averaged approximately 70 per cent,
throughout the period, which was quite damp.
1929.—The second test beds were sown on 29th
July, 1929, and the seedlings under one sash (3 feet x 6 feet)
inoculated by atomizing with a water suspension of blue
mould spores on 28th September. In this inoculation, the
plants were first watered with a hose. A piece of paper about
18 inches square was placed over one inoculated portion and
left on for twelve hours. The reason for spraying with water,
and covering with paper for twelve hours, was to insure spore
germination and infection before the plant leaves became dry.
An outside block of plants was inoculated at the same time.
On Saturday, sth October, the first symptoms of mould were
seen on both the inside and outside beds. On Thursday, 10th
October, 25 plants were examined from both inoculated blocks
of the inside bed. One hundred per cent, infection was found
in the plot covered with paper for twelve hours after inocula-
tion, and 48 per cent, infection in the lot not covered. A
uniform heavy infection was secured from all outside bed
inoculations, and the plants soon succumbed.
During the period 23th September to 10th October, 1929,
the mean temperature of the air in the glasshouse was 78° F.,
while that of the outside air was 62° F. The minimum air
temperature recorded in the glasshouse bed was 61° F., while
that for the outside bed was 40° F. The relative humidity
of the air in the glasshouse bed averaged 64 per cent, for
the period, while that of the outside air was 69 per cent.
It may be noted that infection was much more severe in
the glasshouse in this experiment than in the first test in
October and November. 1928. It may also be noted that the
mean temperature of this experiment was slightly low r er and
the relative humidity much higher in the glasshouse, than was
recorded in the 1928 test. Whereas only 9 per cent, infection
was secured in the first test in 1928. 43 per cent, infection
was secured in 1929 under approximately similar conditions,
except for humidity. It may also be noted that 100 per cent,
of virulent infection was secured at a mean temperature of
78° F. when the inoculated portion was kept in a moist con-
dition for twelve hours after inoculation. Examining further
our data for this experiment, we find that tile air tempera-
ture of the glasshouse was 75° F. when inoculation was com-
pleted at 7 p.m. on Saturday, 28th September, and that this
temperature increased to 90° F. within a space of six hours
after inoculation. This indicates that germination of the
conidia and penetration of the tobacco leaf by the blue mould
fungus may readily take place at temperatures above 75° F,
if sufficient moisture be present.
The soil of the glasshouse bed was removed, thoroughly
reworked and replaced in the interior frame. Reseeding for
a second 1929 test was done on 19th October. Severe rain-
storms damaged the glass covering the beds and the young
plants were wetted and exposed several times to outside
infection, which was plentiful at the time. The first mould
was noticed in the central sash of the glasshouse bed on Btb
November. This sash had been most severely injured by the
storms, and it appears likely that mould pores from badly
infected outside plants gained entry largely through this sash.
The plants from this sash were pulled and examined on sth
December. From a total of 340 plants, 116, or 33 per cent.,
were found to be infected. On 9th December the remainder of
the plants in these glasshouse beds were pulled and examined.
Of a total of 1,232 plants, 123, or 10 per cent., were found


to be infected. It is impossible to say how much of this
infection was secondary. Due to several disturbing factors,
the air temperatures and moistures recorded in the glass-
house for this test were quite variable and do not merit
discussion. It can be said, however, that the air tempera-
tures were considerably higher than for outside beds.
Conclusions. —On the basis of the tests so far conducted,
it is not possible to draw definite conclusions. The following
tentative deductions appear reasonable, however: —
1. Control of temperature and humidity may afford
protection from mould, but produces no inherent resistance
to the disease in the plant itself.
2. Blue Mould can vigorously attack tobacco plants at
any temperature at which strong healthy seedlings can be
grown.
3. Moisture control appears of considerable importance
as a means of protecting tobacco seedlings from attack
by Blue Mould.
4. The “ Marks ” system of growing tobacco seedlings,
as carried out in these tests, appears promising, but could
be improved by better moisture control apparatus.
20. Study of Blue Mould.
This study has been undertaken to learn the life history,
methods of overwintering and primary infection of the Blue
Mould fungus Peronospora nicotianae Wilson an Speg. The
work is carried out co-operatively by the Australian Tobacco
Investigation and the Economic Botany Division of the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and is under
the direct supervision of Dr. H. R. Angell of that Division.
Work on this project was begun in January, 1929, and a
preliminary article suggesting seed transmission of this
disease has already been published by Dr. Angell. Copies of
this article are attached.
21. A Study of the Stalk Disease of Tobacco in North
Queensland.
This disease appeared in the Investigation’s experimental
seedbeds at Mareeba in January, 1929, and was serious both
in the seedbeds and later in the field. The work contemplated
includes the examination of, and isolation from, infected
material; and a study of the morphology and pathology of
the organisms found. In the nature of immediate control
measures, the experimental seedlings of the Tobacco Investiga-
tion at Mareeba were grown in raised frames at some dis-
tance from the area used last year, and are equipped with
heavy canvas coverings which can be rolled down at any time,
and wdiich it is hoped will protect the seedbeds from the
torrential rains common after Christmas in North Queens-
land. No recurrence of the disease has been reported.
22. Control Measures for Blue Mould.
The object of this investigation is to find practical control
measures for this disease which can be recommended to
growers. From studies of the life history of the fungus and
from studies of methods and sources of primary infection,
practical tests are evolved and experimentation carried out
in the tobacco-growing districts to prove their value. To try
out the possible advantage of seed known to be free of mould
in infected localities, Canadian seed was sown in seedbeds
at three places in each of the Myrtleford and Tumut dis-
tricts. In most cases these remained free of disease until
a considerably later date than other seedbeds in the neigh-
borhood. This indicates that the use of clean seed will
decrease the amount of mould both in the seedbed and in the
field. There have been some indications that the disease may
overwinter in the soil, and for this reason growers should
not grow seedlings upon beds known to have been diseased
the previous year. Seed of a number of standard varieties
of flue-cured tobacco is being produced in quantity by the
Australian Tobacco Investigation at Manjimup, Western Aus-
tralia. As far as is known, Blue Mould has not yet occurred
in Western Australia, and it is hoped to secure disease-free
Australian-grown seed for distribution to growers. At the
present time, based on preliminary work done by the Tobacco
Investigation, the following practical control measures are
advocated: —
(1) Use only seed known to have been produced by
healthy plants, and preferably in a disease-free
district.
(2) Use new or virgin soil for the tobacco seedbeds if
possible. Avoid particularly soils on which
diseased plants grew the year previously. If pos-
sible, locate the seedbeds at some distance from
any other tobacco plants.
(3) Water the seedlings as little as possible, particularly
during October and November, when temperatures
favorable to mould are prevalent.
(4) Use some sort of cover for the seedbeds, in order
to shorten the period of growth and the consequent
exposure to infection.
F. 218.—6
(5) Any method of plant culture which will keep the
leaves of the seedlings free from moisture will
greatly lessen chance of infection.
(t>) Destroy all overwintering and volunteer tobacco
plants.
23. Production of Tobacco Seed.
It is planned to build up and to maintain an adequate
supply of high quality, disease-free tobacco seed for dis-
tribution to growlers, and for experimental purposes. To this
end, as indicated above, considerable areas of the best varieties
are being grown from imported seed at Manjimup, Western
Australia. All seedheads are bagged and labelled, and the
seed carefully cleaned after drying. Germination tests will
be made on all lots before distribution, and no seed showing
low germination will be released.
24. Fertilization to Improve Aroma.
Aroma tests under way at Bathurst, New South Wales, and
smoking tests of cigarettes from a series of fertilizer plots
grown at Myrtleford, Victoria, in 1928, by H. A. McGee,
formerly Experimentalist for the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company, have indicated improvement in aroma from certain
plant food materials. With the idea of further studying the
efiects of these fertilizer ingredients, a series of plots has
been laid out, fertilized and planted at Wahgunyah and
Kowat, Victoria, and at Tumut, New South Wales. The
plots at Kowat are on a virgin loam soil, while those at
Wahgunyah and Tumut are on long cultivated sandy loam and
silt loam soils, respectively. The fertilizer combinations used
include superphosphate alone, dried blood and superhosphate,
urea and superphosphate, nitrate of soda and superphosphate,
dried blood and superphosphate with sulphate of potash. One-
tenth acre plots are used, and after harvest and curing, data
on the yield, texture, colour and particularly on the smoking
qualities of the cured leaf will be obtained.
25. Paper Mulch for Tobacco.
There are considerable areas of sandy soil in New South
Wales and Victoria which are rarely used for tobacco because
the moisture in such soils during the summer season is
usually entirely inadequate for green crops. This test was
designed to ascertain if tobacco can be grown in such dry
sandy soils under conditions of restricted rainfall through
the use of a paper mulch. In Victoria, particularly, some
of these sandy soils receive considerable winter and spring
rainfalls, which might be conserved by paper mulch. It was
also felt that the soil temperature under the mulch might
be raised, so that earlier planting could also be adopted, and
in this way better use made of the available rainfall. This
test is at present under way at Pomonal, Victoria. The soil
used is a light sand loam, and different methods of using
the paper are being tested. It is yet too early to discuss
results, but at present the plants with paper mulch appear
to be growing faster than the check rows. The root systems
also appear to be more extensive under mulch. Some plants
pulled up with mulch on one side of the row and not on the
other exhibited the most root growth on the mulched side.
Rainfall to date has been adequate for ordinary plantings.
The effects of the mulch will be closely studied.
(h) Publications.
A bulletin series has been set up to deal with major publica-
tions of general interest. Minor publications of general
interest will be issued in pamphlet form. Scientific and
general articles are published from time to time in appropriate
journals. In addition to these, press interviews and state-
ments relating to the activities of the Investigation and the
progress of the work have been given from time to time. The
more important publications to date include—
Bulletin No. 1. —Report on a tour through the south-
eastern Atlantic States of the United States of
America, with particular reference to the production
of bright flue-cured tobacco —by Dr. G. P. Daimell-
Smith. 1929.
Bulletin No. 2.—The Smoking Qualities of Australian
Tobacco —by C. M. Slagg. 1929.
Article No. 1. —The Production of Bright Flue-cured
Tobacco in America—by Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith,
in the Journal of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research for February, 1928.
Article No. 2.—A Reconnaissance of some Australian
Tobacco Soils, with reference to Reaction and
Mechanical Analysis, by E. P. Bainbridge, in the
Journal of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research for November, 1928.
Article No. 3, Blue Mould of Tobacco—lnvestigations
concerning seed transmission—by Dr. H. R. Angell
in the Journal of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research for August, 1929.


The data contained in these bulletins, journal articles and
the press statements do not, however, cover all those in the
possession of the Investigation, and it is considered desirable
to draw the attention of the Select Committee to the follow-
ing reports which have not been published: —
(а) Report of the Party appointed by the Executive
Committee of the Australian Tobacco Investigation
to conduct an Economic Survey of the position of
the tobacco-growing industry in Australia.
(August, 1927, to January, 1928).
(б) Report by the Imperial Institute on samples of
Australian and American tobacco submitted by
the Executive Committee.
As a matter of fact, report (a) was not prepared for
publication but for the information of the Executive Com-
mittee and the Director of Investigations. Apart, however,
from this consideration, it contained conclusions which the
Executive Committee was unable to accept as proved, and
some of these conclusions, if published, would, in the opinion
of the Executive, have been liable to affect prejudicially
certain sections of the present growers. This latter considera-
tion, which has always been and will continue to be in the
forefront of the minds of the members of the Executive Com-
mittee, made it all the more essential that they should be
quite sure of their ground before consenting to publication.
Report {6) is a confidential report prepared by the Imperial
Institute at the request of the Executive Committee, and is
part of the preliminary data gathered in order that the
Executive Committee might fully inform itself as to the
true position of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia.
So much has been said in Australia, for and against the
quality of Australian leaf, that the Executive decided to
obtain an independent criticism. Some of the data in this
report have been used by the Director of Investigations, Mr.
Slagg, in his preliminary report on the smoking qualities
of Australian tobacco presented to the Executive Committee.
(Bulletin No. 2.)
The Executive Committee also has in its possession a
Report on Tobacco-growing Experiments at Bathurst, by
Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith and Messrs. Tregenna and McGee.
This document was printed for private circulation by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, and submitted by
the company to the Executive Committee with a request that
the executive agree to publication. The Executive Committee,
however, considered the conclusions in this report were not
proved, and declined to agree to publication.
It is necessary at this stage to explain that in accepting
the report from the authors and in printing it, the British-
Australasian 'tobacco Company was acting under a mis-
apprehension as to the responsibility for the experiments.
These were initiated by the company prior to the institution
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, and carried out
by the authors. Subsequently, however, these experiments
were taken over by the Investigation. The details of this
transference were known to the company’s expert, Mr. McGee,
who, the executive assumed, acted with the full cognizance
of the directorate of the company in this matter. It was
subsequently discovered that the directorate of the company
was not aware of the transference, and that, in fact, it
believed the experiments were still being carried on at its
expense and on its responsibility.
The whole or partial contents of this report were, much
to the regret of the Executive Committee, conveyed to the
press through an unauthorized medium. From the resulting
publicity the inference was readily drawn that the existing
tobacco areas were unsuitable for the production of high-
quality leaf, and that if such leaf was to be produced in
Australia it would have to be grown, say, in Northern
Queensland, where it was alleged test plots established at
the direction of the Tobacco Investigation had resulted in the
production of leaf of the quality desired by consumers.
The attitude of the Executive Committee towards this
unauthorized publicity is clearly indicated in the following
press statements which were issued by the Chairman. Mr,
H. W. Gepp, on the 10th and 18th July, 1928, respectively:—
10th July, 1928.
As Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, which is being conducted
under an agreement between the Commonwealth and
mainland State Governments and the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd., I had a conference in Sydney
in July last year with Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, Director
of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney; Mr. G. D. Ross, Under-
secretary for Agriculture, New South Wales; and Mr.
C. J. Tregenna, who was then working as an officer of
the Tobacco Investigation, being seconded from the New
South Wales Department of Agriculture. At this con-
ference a recommendation was made to me that certain
tests should be carried out in Queensland, and I under-
stand that these recommendations were based upon con-
versations with Mr. McGee, the expert of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company. On behalf of the Execu-
tive Committee I authorized the visit of Messrs. McGee
and Tregenna to North Queensland, and, as a result of
recommendations received from these gentlemen, test
plots were put in hand.
The Executive Committee desires it to be clearly under-
stood that though results were encouraging, no definite
conclusions can be drawn until the results have been
subjected to thorough proof and check.
In this connexion it is perhaps appropriate for me
to state on behalf of the Executive Committee that we
are strongly averse from publishing interim reports on
our work until the results have been thoroughly proved,
and I might add that there will be no deviation from this
attitude right throughout the Investigation.
18th July, 1928.
On 10th July, 1928, on behalf of the executive, I issued
a statement commenting upon statements in the press
regarding results of preliminary tests in Queensland, in
which I emphasized that the tests were entirely of a
preliminary nature and no conclusions could be drawn
from them except encouragement to proceed with further
tests.
The full executive, at its meeting to-day, has further
considered the position, and desires to make plain that
no statements which have appeared in the press regarding
the work being carried out under the auspices of the
Executive Committee, except the one mentioned above,
have any authority from the executive. Investigations
which are now beginning must be carried out to conclusion
before the executive is prepared to issue any recommenda-
tions or criticism regarding the present position or future
development of the_ industry. The executive strongly
deprecates unauthorized and immature statements which
may detrimentally affect the industry. The executive has,
from time to time, urged that further areas should not
be planted pending investigations. However, the execu-
tive desires to definitely dissociate itself from the
inferences which may be drawn from the recent press
statements that proof exists that the present areas are
unsuitable for tobacco production. Such statements may
not only injure growers without reason, but may prove
exceedingly embarrassing to those in charge of the
scientific work which is now beginning under the direc-
tion of Mr. C. M. Slagg. The work which is projected by
th !. e^ eCUt o lVe 0n ie investigation side in conjunction
with the State authorities, will be carried out not only
in new areas, but also in existing areas in the varioui
States, with a view to making further improvements in
production.
The previously described policy of the Executive Committee
in regard to publications will, it is believed, be manifest on
a perusal of these statements.
Subsequently the Executive Committee requested its repre-
sentative on the Bathurst experiments—Dr. G. P. Darnell-
Smith—to furnish a report on the experiments for the informa-
tion of the executive. This request was complied with, and
a copy of Dr. Darnell-Smith’s report will be made available
to the Select Committee, if desired.
The experiments are still in progress, and it is hoped to
publish all the results in the near future. A summary of
these results has been given in the present statement. A
detailed report on the results to date has been prepared, and
this is also available.
1. RksUMfi AND PutUKE PLANS.
The tobacco manufacturing industry in Australia is in a
satisfactory condition, but the production of raw leaf by
growers has languished. Efforts to improve the quality of
the tobacco grown and to increase raw leaf production have
been made for many years by various State Governments
and by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. These
efforts have not met with a sufficient measure of success to
place the commercial culture of tobacco in the Commonwealth
on a satisfactory footing, as evidenced by the fact that 90
per cent, of the manufacturers’ raw-leaf requirements are
imported from overseas.
The public spirited action of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company in making available a large sum of money
for experimental purposes, supplemented by Federal and State
appi opriations, and the subsequent formation, organization
aims and activities of the Australian Tobacco Investigation
have been set forth.
The experimental activities of the Investigation may be
roughly grouped under three headings:—
1. The ascertainment, by exhaustive tests, of the exact
position as regards the smoking qualities of tobacco
grown commercially in the Commonwealth.
2. The improvement of tobacco in the present com-
mercial growing areas.
3. The location of new districts in Australia where
mild aromatic tobaccoes may be grown.


Tlie smoking qualities of Australian tobacco are discussed
at some length in Bulletin No. 2. In compiling data on
smoking qualities it should be pointed out that it is neces-
sary to allow the cured leaf to age or mature for at least
a year in a packed condition before adequate judgment of its
smoking characteristics can be formed. With regard to aroma
till results thus far secured appear to afford some justification
for the criticism of Australian-grown leaf that have been
made in the past. A rather large percentage of the lots which
were tested from New South Wales and Victoria possessed
an aroma which may be considered as objectionable. This
unpleasant aroma appears to be closely associated with the
coarse texture and dark colour of much of the leaf pro-
duced. •
The improvement of tobacco in the present growing areas
includes a wide variety of experimental projects, such as tests
of seedbeds, time of planting, methods of fertilization, soil
treatments, varieties, methods of culture and handling, control
of diseases and insect pests, methods of curing, and a study
of the factors influencing aroma in tobacco. On some of these
projects substantial progress has been made. On others
results of significance have been secured, but which require
further testing. Still others are just under way. Some
varieties, among which may be mentioned Hickory Pryor,
appear markedly superior in texture, colour and aroma to
most of the sorts at present being grown commercially. It
seems likely that with certain types of seedbeds an adequate
supply of early, vigorous seedlings would be assured. With
earlier seedlings, an earlier planting date would be distinctly
advantageous in some districts. Control of Blue Mould
appears at present hopeful of attainment. The aroma tests
have shown that soil and not climate is responsible for the
character of aroma in Australian tobacco, and that the
tobacco plant may take up certain materials added to the
soil in sufficient quantities to influence, favorably or other-
wise, the aroma of the final cured leaf. Certain of the
favorable indications are being tested out on a larger scale
under field conditions. All of these experiments require years
of work before reaching definite conclusions, and varying
local conditions in the different districts have always to be
taken into consideration.
In addition to efforts to improve the quality of tobacco in
the present commercial areas, we are convinced of the desira-
bility of locating new districts in Australia where mild
aromatic tobaccoes may be grown, and ascertaining the value
of these tobaccoes for manufacture, and their relative qualities
in blends with other Australian and imported leaf. Accord-
ingly, a series of exploratory test plots has been laid out in
all of the mainland States, in districts where soil and climate
appear favorable. These plots are small (l-20th acre) and
are widely scattered in each State. Some of the most
promising leaf from these exploratory tests has been secured
from North Queensland and Western Australia. The smoking
qualities of the cured leaf secured from all the different dis-
tricts and States, however, has varied widely. Should the
merits of certain areas be established, there would still remain
a large amount of work to be done in ascertaining the most
suitable cultural methods, varieties, and controls of insect
and disease pests for those districts.
In concluding, it may be pointed out that in the early days
of tobacco-growing in Australia the demand was for a dark,
heavy leaf. This was supplied by dark air-cured tobacco,
grown on the heavy fertile soils of the interior river valleys in
New South Wales and Victoria. In the meantime the demand
has changed, flue-curing has been introduced, and, in Australia,
us in other parts of the world, the smoking public at present
is demanding more of the bright, mildly aromatic tobaccoes.
and less and less of the dark, heavy sorts. In view of this
fact, the grower is faced with the necessity for increasing
the proportion of thin, bright grades in his crop. The problem
of accomplishing this requires the best co-operative efforts
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, the State Depart-
ments of Agriculture and the tobacco-growers.
15. Have you taken a personal part in tlie experi-
ments in the various tobacco-growing areas?— Not in
the actual experimental work. I have not visited any
of the areas.
16. These conclusions are based on reports of your
Director, and his field officers?— Yes, we have on the
committee Dr. Darnell-Smith, of New South Wales,
who has had close touch with the industry and is still
in touch with it.
17. Is he in charge of the experiments in New South
Wales?—No, he is a member from New South Wales
of the Executive Committee which, of course, dominates
he work carried out by the staff.
18. Is he charged with any special duties in New
South Wales, such as keeping the Investigation Com-
mittee informed of what is going on in the tohacco-
growing areas?— No.
19. In drafting this report did you have the benefit
of Dr. Smith’s opinions, based on his first-hand know-
ledge of the industry ?—This report was drafted in Mel-
bourne and was submitted to him. He took no part
in its actual compilation. He was appointed to the
committee largely because of his technical knowledge.
20. Your report states that the report of the party
appointed by the Executive Committee to conduct an
economic survey of the position of the tobacco-growing
industry in Australia, which was made from August,
1927, to January, 1928, was not prepared for publica-
tion, but for the information of the Executive Com-
mittee. You point out that apart from this considera-
tion the report contained conclusions which the
Executive Committee could not accept as proved, and
that some of these conclusions, if published, might pre-
judicially have affected certain sections of the present
growers. The growers have, at various times, asked for
that report, and here you give the reason why it has
been withheld?—lt was withheld virtually because we
did not accept the conclusions, as we did not consider
them proved. We felt that if they were published,
even accompanied by a disclaimer from us, they might
have affected the value of certain properties. The
report was of very great value to Mr. Slagg, who came
out here shortly afterwards, but with its major con-
clusions we did not agree.
i 21. Does that mean that for all practical purposes
that report is of no use to the Investigation Committee*
—We are making use of it.
22. But you do not accept the conclusions?—We
consider certain conclusions are not proved.
23. Is there any intention to proceed with that part
of the investigation with the object of ultimately pub-
lishing the report ?—We were seeking certain informa-
tion and we got it. The report is of great use to us,
but in it are certain conclusions with which the
Executive committee does not wholly agree. As
we considered that the conclusions were not proved we
did not feel justified in putting out conclusions that
would have prejudicially affected present values.
24. Considerable value was attached to that report
by the Investigation Committee. You expected big
things from it?—We expected information. The
questionnaire system was adopted, and we got a good
deal of information. We felt however that before such
conclusions as were contained in that report could justi-
fiably go out, a great deal more work had to be done.
Ye were not satisfied that it was impossible by further
research work to improve certain properties.
20. Is it not a fact that certain conclusions of this
committee were made available to the press ?—Certainly
not by the Executive Committee.
26. Are you aware that a statement appeared in the
New r South Wales press last year that the committee
had discovered a serious taint in the existing tobacco-
growing areas of Australia. I refer to the eucalyptus
oil taint. Mr. Tregenna and some of his associates
on this investigation were responsible for the conclusion
that the tobacco grown in the present areas was tainted
by phellandrene ?—That is a theory that has been very
much to the fore, and tests have been carried out.
This could not have been a conclusion based on experi-
mental work. So far as present areas are concerned. 1
regard the theory as unproven.
27. That is not one of the reasons why this report
was withheld from publication ?—No.
28. Will we receive a copy of it?— Yes; but if this
Select Committee publishes it, it must do so on its
own responsibility. The body responsible for the


investigation considered that the conclusions were not
justified by the evidence. I think Mr. Temple Smith
dissociated himself from it.
29. The report you have just presented to the com-
mittee says that the party was appointed by the
Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation to conduct an economic survey of the
position of the tobacco industry ?—Yes.
30. What particular qualifications did the members
of that party have to conduct an economic survey?—
Presumably the tobacco experts in the States, who have
years of experience behind them and know a great
number of the growers, are likely to be qualified to get
information from them.
31. What do you consider to be the economic aspect
of the industry?— That really dbes not concern me,
although it is a matter of extreme importance. I am
concerned only with the scientific aspect.
32. Are you satisfied that an attempt was made to
deal with the economic aspect, or merely only with
certain cultivation aspects?—A definite attempt was
made to get at the economic conditions. The ques-
tionnaire will give an idea of the inquiry.
33. Is the field work in connexion with these experi-
ments proceeding through Australia at present in a
comprehensive and determined manner ?—lf we are not
doing the work in a determined way, and doing our
level best, we are not fit to be in our positions.
34. A couple of years ago the tobacco areas were
visited by various experts associated with these com-
mittees, but nothing regarding that part of the work
has since been heard of in the tobacco areas. So far
as the growers know, most of the work is being done
at head-quarters in Melbourne or Sydney, and very
little field work is being undertaken. One of the
experts has not been doing anything for eighteen
months. I refer to Mr, Tregenna?—He is not an
officer of the Australian Tobacco Investigation; nor
has he ever been, except that we asked the Yew South
Wales Department of Agriculture, to which he belongs,
to permit him to take part in the initial survey. We
have a staff at work. The complete list is set out in
the report that I have presented.
35. Do those officers make periodical tours?— They
are at the work all the time, and it is proceeding in
all parts of Australia, particularly in regard to explora-
tory test plots.
36. But the growers in Yew South Wales have not
heard of any of these gentlemen for a long time ?—The
object of the investigation is to improve the quality of
the tobacco grown in Australia. To that end we are
investigating numerous types of soil in every State,
as well as carrying out a certain amount of work in
connexion with existing areas. It is not our business
at this stage to advise growers as to this and that. We
are investigating the matter from the more fundamental
side.
37. But is not the investigation work being confined
to new areas, while the existing areas are being left
alone?—lt is not correct to say that. Mr. Slagg will
be able to tell you what he is doing in existing areas.
38. By Mr. Jones. —How long has the investigation
been going on?—lt began about the end of April, 1927.
39. How long would it be before the growers will be
told anything?—ln any scientific work it is impossible
to say when results will be obtained.
40. By the Chairman. —Has any determination been
arrived at as to what recommendations shall be made
to the Government regarding the continuation of the
investigation?—Yo. That matter will be decided at
our next meeting.
41. We are within three months of the conclusion of
the term of this very expensive and important investiga-
tion? —As a committee we have not reached a final
decision, but personally I can tell you that the work
is not finished and ought to go on.
42. There is no danger that the work will he closed
down?— Personally I think it would be sheer madness
to do that.
43. But it depends on the Government whether the
necessary money can be found for its continuance?—
That is so.
44. Can you tell us whether the money allotted by
the Commonwealth and State Governments for this
work for the first three years has been spent ?—I submit
the following statement of the receipts and expenditure
in connexion with the investigation:—

# 45. Have any arrangements been made about a con-
tinuance of the contributions by the British-Australa-
sian Tobacco Company ?—The company expressed its
attitude very definitely in a letter addressed to the
Development and Migration Commission. It intimated
its willingness “to enter into a definite arrangement
with any State government or the Eederal Govern-
ment to spend £1 for £1 up to a total of £50,000 in
developing any district in Australia which can satis-
factorily demonstrate that it can grow tobacco equal
in quality to the tobacco now grown in America and
used by us at present in manufacture.”
46. Has there been any variation of that attitude?
—To my knowledge, none.
47. The recent alterations in the tariff did not bring
about any noticeable alteration in the attitude of the
company?—Yot the slightest sign of it.
48 ; By Mr. Martens. —Have you at any time heard
opinions expressed by the company as to the work of
the Investigation Committee?—Yo.
49. By the Chairman. —Has the company taken no
steps to keep in touch with the work of the committee?
Is its attitude that of an onlooker?—lt is of course
a very interested onlooker. Yo comments from it have
come before the executive committee.


50. Have you had any communication from the com-
pany regarding the conduct of the investigation?— Hot
so far as I know.
51. The company has contributed some £50,000 in
the last three years, but has not in any way attempted
to influence the work of the committee, and, so far
as you know, has not taken any active interest in it ?
At the outset it particularly said it wanted to hand
the matter over to an independent organization, so that
it could not be even suspected that it had tried to
influence the inquiry. The company has given us every
possible assistance when we have asked for informa-
tion.
52. Have any investigations in the tobacco-growing
areas been carried out in collaboration with officers of
the company?— Mr. McGee was associated with the
experiments at Bathurst, but, beyond that, I do not
think the company has come into the matter at all. We
have sought its help, and it has detailed officers to give
information for which we had asked.
53. Do you think the present committee can carry
on the investigation for an indefinite period without
collaboration with the company?—We get any informa-
tion we desire from it. Throughout the whole matter
the company has been very open, and to that extent we
could not have had more active collaboration, but it
has definitely decided to keep apart from the investiga-
tion.
54. By Mr. Jones. —Were names submitted to the
company for approval before appointments to the
committee were made? —Hothing was submitted to it, so
far as I am aware.
55. By the Chairman. —Did the company receive a
copy of the report of Mr. Tregenna, Mr. Temple Smith
and the other officer on the results of the economic
survey, which was withheld by the Executive Com-
mittee?—l do not think so.
56. The company has not communicated in writing
with the Executive Committee on any phases of the
work?— Hot so far as I know.
57. By Mr. Morgan. —What do you think are the
troubles in connexion with the tobacco-growing
industry. Are they agricultural, industrial, or econo-
mic?—To some extent they are probably all three.
I suppose the main trouble is that Australians will not
smoke Australian-grown tobacco. They do not like it,
and that is the trouble.
58. Is it possible, by selection of soils, or by the aid
of suitable fertilizers, to produce a leaf that is attrac-
tive to the Australian smoker? —It is largely a soils
problem. We mentioned something in the report about
the work done on soils imported from America, and
the work done on river sands.
59. Is there any industrial problem?— That is out-
side my line.
60. By Mr. Jones. —Figures from the Customs
Department show that in Western Australia the per-
centage of Australian leaf used in manufacture
increased in one year from 7.85 per cent, to 12 per cent.
Has any attempt been made to manufacture a purely
Australian tobacco?—So far as I can see the tobacco
company is doing its best to incorporate as much Aus-
tralian leaf as possible.
61. Is it not also contended that Australians will
not smoke tobacco in wffiich there is a large proportion
of Australian leaf ?—I have heard that approximately
10 per cent, of the total amount used is Australian
grown.
62, By the Chairman. —Has the Investigation Com-
mittee taken steps to ascertain why the Australian
smoker will not use Australian tobacco?—lt is hard to
get reasons for tastes.
63. On what ground do you base your opinion that
the Australian, smoker will not use the home-grown
leaf?— The facts of the case, so far as I understand
them, are that Australian leaf is incorporated in cer-
tain products to a certain percentage, but blends con-
taining more than that percentage are apparently
umvelcome to smokers generally.
64. Is it only your private opinion that Australian-
grown tobacco is unacceptable to smokers ?—That is
so.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Mervyn Slagg, M.Sc., Director of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, sworn and examined.
65. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
in Australia?— Since Ist March, 1928.
66. Are you an American?— Yes. When a resident
of Ottawa, Canada, on request and recommendation
by certain persons I put in an application for the posi-
tion of Director of Tobacco Investigations.
67. Eor any period?—As I recall the advertisement
it stated that the period of the appointment -was three
years, and that it might be extended. The advertise-
ment was headed “ Commonwealth of Australia,” and
the applications were to be forwarded to Sir Hugh
Denison, Commissioner for Australia in Hew York
City, Eventually I received a letter and several wires
requesting me to go to Hew York to meet Sir Hugh
Denison and Dr. Cameron, who was to come from
England. Dr Cameron was then, as he is how,
Director of Agriculture in Victoria. We had a general
discussion as to the possibilities of experimental work
in connexion with the tobacco industry in Australia.
They inquired as to my previous training and experi-
ence, in addition to what had been included in the
application. They informed me that I would be recom-
mended for the position. I understood that they had
already interviewed other applicants. I was informed
some six weeks later that the appointment had been
made, and I was asked for my formal acceptance, which
was given both by letter and wire.
68. What were the terms of the appointment?—l
cannot recall them all, but I shall give a summary
of them as I remember them. There was a straight-
out offer of employment for three years.
69. With the probability of an extension?—l do not
remember the wording of the appointment in that
respect.
70. You accepted on a three-years’ basis?— Yes, with
the probability of an extension.
71. Did they make it clear to you that there was
every likelihood that the appointment would be for a
longer period ?—A es.
72. If it had been an appointment for three years
only would you have accepted it?— Ho.
73. Will you supply us with the actual written con-
ditions of your appointment ?—Yes.
74. What happened when you reached Australia?—
I was met at Sydney by Dr. Darnell-Smith, the Sydney
representative of the Executive Committee, by Dr.
Dickson of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Besearch, and by Mr. Tregenna of the Hew South
Wales Department of Agriculture. I proceeded im-
mediately to Melbourne and met the committee.
75. Did you interview Mr. Gepp?—To the best of
my recollection I met him a few days after my arrival.
Shortly after my arrival a meeting of the
Executive Committee was held, at . which all
the members were present. Mr. Gepp, as chairman,
officially welcomed me to Australia. The steps that
had been taken prior to my arrival were discussed, and


the question of my status in the investigation, as well
as my responsibilities and duties, was brought up.
Certain preliminary decisions as to procedure were
made. It was decided that a survey of the tobacco
being grown in the commercial districts of Australia
should be made as soon as possible, and arrangements
were put in train for the tobacco specialists in the
various State departments of agriculture to -accompany
me on this tour.
76. Did the Investigation Committee give you any
written statement as to what you were to do here?—
There was nothing in Avriting as to wdiat my exact duties
and responsibilities were. The committee has largely
given me a free hand in carrying out such investigations
as may seem desirable; in that respect I have no
criticism wh a tower to offer.
77. You intervieAved Mr. Gepp within a few days of
your arrival. Did he then lay doAAui clearly Avhat your
duties Avere to be?—l am afraid I cannot speak with
any clear recollection of what was said after my first
conversation with Mr. Gepp. The matter was left
largely to me and the committee looked to me for a
plan of action.
78. Was any idea given to you by Mr. Gepp or the
committee as to the course the Commonwealth Govern-
ment desired to pursue in regard to the industry ?—Mr.
Gepp made it plain that the desire Avas to improA'e the
industry in every way possible.
79. So you had to begin practically from nothing?
—To a certain extent, yes. But, as has been pointed
out by Dr. Rivett, the report of the sun r ey party was
available, and this gave me a starting point. There
were also other reports available, many of which I had
looked up before I came to Australia, such as the
bulletins published from time to time by the State
departments of agriculture. Shortly after my arrival
a tour was made of the tobacco-growing districts, and
then, after discussions with groAvers, manufacturers
and State tobacco specialists, a plan of action was drawn
up, and presented to the Executive Committee.
80. You started off in March Avith a clear mind as
to Avhat you had to do to bring the Australian tobacco
industry to a much sounder position?—Yo. When we
see a certain situation we may know that something is
wrong; but the correct solution can only be obtained
by experimentation.
81. Can you say that your mind is clear to-day as
to what is required to establish the Australian tobacco
industry in a sound position?—l could not say that
my mind Avas absolutely clear on any point requiring
i m-estigation.
82. You have been here tAvo years, and you should
have a pretty clear idea noAv Avhere this investigation
is leading?—As to wdiere Ave hope it is leading, yes.
As Director of the Investigation, I may say that our
aim is to increase the amount of Australian-grown
tobacco used by manufacturers. We hope to increase
that to the point where, at least, the major part of the
tobacco used in Australia may be groAvn in this country.
That is the definite policy.
83. By Mr. Morgan. — What do you think are the
main problems regarding tobacco production here.
Are they agricultural, industrial, or economic, and
which is the greatest factor of the three?— They all
interlock, and it is difficult to separate any of them,
but possibly the soil problem may be regarded as the
greatest to be considered in connexion A\dth the aromas
of Australian-groAvn tobacco.
84. Do you think it is possible to produce tobacco in
the different States and make it pay?—We hope that
the industry may be established on a footing that will
enable it to compete in markets even beyond Australia.
85. Do you think that is possible?— Yes; if the
industry can be placed on a proper foundation. Aus-
tralia, in common with the other self-governing
dominions and Crown colonies, enjoys a preference of
2s. a lb. on all leaf tobacco exported to England. Were
it possible for us to build up our industry to the point
of producing 50 per cent, or more of the tobacco used
in Australia, we should be justified in looking out for
an export market also.
86. Do you think Ave could obtain an export market
Avithout the assistance of a bounty under existing
economic conditions? —Yes. With the protection of
2s. a lb., Avhy not? The other dominions are doing it.
Canada Avas able to increase its exports from
1,000,000 lb. per annum in 1923 to OA'er 6,000,000 lb.
in 1927.
87. Is there a parallel between the economic con-
ditions of production in Canada and Australia ?—A
parallel may be draAvn. The cost of production in
Canada should not be far different from that in
Australia.
88. Does Canada produce tobacco Avith white labour?
—Yes. There is an import duty of Is. Bd. a lb. on
tobacco sent to Canada and of about Is. 6d.
a lb. on leaf sent into the United States of America.
Bounties are objectionable in that they are likely to
lead to production on soils that are, perhaps, unsuit-
able, or in districts Avhere it might not be desirable to
encourage production. When you commence to inter-
fere Avith the laAv of supply' and demand you are on
dangerous ground from the economic stand-point.
89. You consider the soil problem the greatest that
confronts the industry?— There are other problems that
are very important, and one is blue mould, Avhich has
a serious effect on the aroma and smoking qualities of
the leaf. I feel strongly' that Australia can and will
produce its own tobacco in time. If desired, it could
produce a type of Virginian leaf. This is a term often
improperly applied to all American tobacco. More
of the bright, flue-cured, type is grown in Uorth
Carolina than in Virginia.
90. By Mr. Jones. —Is not the foreign duty in Eng-
land over Bs. a lb.?—Yes; but there is no excise duty
in the United Kingdom. The manufacturer receives a
drawback on all tobacco exported. The conditions in
the industry there at present would probably be not
greatly different from the conditions in Australia.
91. Do you regard the tariff as an effective means of
stimulating the industry?—l doubt if any further
increase in the import duty would increase the con-
sumption of Australian tobacco, unless the duty were
raised to such a point as to be entirely prohibitive.
With a 3s. a lb. protection, to which must be added the
cost of the imported tobacco and the cost of shipment,
the Australian grower already has a protection Avhich
is far greater than the value of the tobacco produced.
So. in my opinion, any increase in import duties from
uoav on should be regarded as revenue producing, and
not as assistance to the tobacco-groAvers.
92. Do you think that the reduction of the excise
duty on Australian-groAATi leaf as recommended by the
Tariff Board would stimulate the Australian tobacco
industry?—l think it would have the same effect as an
increase in the import duty.
93. The percentage of Australian leaf decreased from
6.6 per cent, in 1925-26 to 5.6 per cent, in 1927-28.
That shows that the percentage of Australian leaf
being used is generally on the decrease?— That Avould
appear so.
94. You do not agree with the recommendations by
the Tariff Board that the excise duty should be
reduced?—l do not pass an opinion on that point. A
decrease in the excise duty Avould the same effect
as an increase in the import duty.


95. Do you favour a reduction of the excise in addi-
tion to the preference, with a view to stimulating the
industry ?—I deprecate all changes in import duties
and excise. They are a disturbing factor both from the
experimental and industrial stand-points.
96. The tobacco production of Southern Rhodesia
multiplied 30 times between 1918 to 1926, in Cyprus
it multiplied 23 times in six years, and in Canada it
doubled. Still you deprecate any changes in the tariff
to assist the industry?—-It appears to me that the
industry is amply protected at the present time. There
are other aspects that need attention badly, and that is
what we are trying to give.
97. By Mr. r dully. —You are trying to find out, for
instance, why the area under tobacco cultivation in
Yew South Wales was reduced from 2,658 acres to 803
acres, between 1923 and 1928?— Yes.
98. By Mr. Morgan. —Australia is the one dominion
of all the Empire that has not responded to preference.
Is that not due to economic causes? —We may look
upon it as an economic problem and say that until
Australia is able to produce at least the major part of
the tobacco taken for domestic manufacture, the price
of Australian leaf is likely to remain at too high a
level for export to England to be possible even under
the preference.
99. Might not the price be too high for home con-
sumption ?—That may be a factor. Of course, the
economics of production as it is carried on at present
may be unsound; but, until we can remedy some of the
defects in our present production which appear to be
factors, it will not be possible to put the industry on
an economic basis.
100. By M r. Jones. —On page 31 of your report there
is a reference to the 1928 experiments in Yorth
Queensland. Are these plots the same as the 1929
Queensland plots mentioned at the top of page 33?
Yo.
101. On page 32 we are told that the aroma of the
1928 Queensland leaf for the most part was “ mild and
not definitely objectionable ”?—The aroma was entirely
different from that of American leaf, or the flue-cured
leaf that we have secured from other parts of Aus-
tralia. At the same time it was a mild leaf, and in
our opinion it was not definitely objectionable.
102. It has been reported that from 7 acres in
Queensland a gross return of £l,OOO has been obtained,
or an average of 2s. lOd. a lb.?—That was in the
Texas district. There must have been some good
crops there last year.
103. By Mr. Martens. —ls the use of that manure
dangerous ?—There is danger in using animal manure
of any description in growing flue-cured tobacco.
104. Were your own officers at fault there?—Yo.
The plots were laid out without knowledge of the fact
that part of the land had received goat manure the
previous year.
105. Was the individual grower concerned advised?
-Yo.
106. One of the complaints is that the growers are
not advised as to faults in their methods of production?
—We have made a few recommendations in Bulletin
Yo. 2 regarding the fertilization of flue-cured tobacco,
pointing out that all excess of nitrates must be avoided.
That applies to ordinary animal manures as well as to
artificial fertilizers.
107. By Mr. Morgan. —Would the Texas experiments
indicate that the eucalyptus taint is a disappearing
quantity?— The report at pages 54 to 56 inclusive,
shows the outstanding results of the last series of tests.
Regarding eucalyptus leaves, clauses 6 and 7 set out
the results secured last year. The tobacco was har-
vested in three different pickings and cured at three
different times. The tests were carefully made by a
minimum of three men at each test. You will notice
that fresh eucalyptus leaves added to river sand
definitely impaired the aroma, and no difference was
noticed between Eucalyptus dives and Eucalyptus
Rlakelyi, both being equally bad, but tobacco grown on
sand to which eucalyptus leaves had been added in the
previous year, none being put on during the planting
season of 1928-29, was markedly superior in aroma to
that produced from sand to which no leaves had been
added. That is a tentative conclusion on the experi-
ments so far conducted.
108. Is there complete freedom from the taint in the
Bowen area?—We are not prepared to discuss that
matter' at present. Practically all vegetation is
different.
109. By Mr. Jones. —There is a reference in your
report to the report by the Imperial Institute on
samples submitted to it. At the bottom of page 10 the
statement is made that: “In many cases the combustion
is poor and the flavour strong and unattractive.” Are
flavour and aroma one and the same thing ?—They have
confused the two qualities.
110. The report goes on, “ The chief cause of these
defects is no doubt insufficient or unsatisfactory
curing ” ?—That would be simply a guess on their
part.
111. According to that it is not a matter of the soil?
—But they are not familiar with the tobacco curing.
The leaf may have appeared to be insufficiently cured.
112. Have you any comment to make on that
opinion?—Yo. The quality of the leaf might have
been such that it was impossible to cure it.
113. Do you know of any other samples that have
been sent home to England?—Yo. I have had requests
for samples, and I intend to send some. Samples may
have been sent by the State Departments. Our com-
mittee would be glad to receive any reports on such
mittee would be glad to receive any reports on such
tests.
114. By. Mr. Martens.— Generally speaking, the
quality of the soil determines the aroma?—We feel that
soil is responsible for the character of the aroma. As
pointed out in Bulletin Yo. 2, aroma is influenced
by a number of factors, such as soil, type of tobacco,
method of curing, method of packing and ageing, and
method of fertilization. In addition to the character
of the aroma, we also have the amount or degree of
aroma, and climate has an influence on that. We
expect the same sort of aroma from Virginian leaf each
year, irrespective of seasonal variations, but we know
that there are differences in aroma between one year
and another. We consider that a humid climate pro-
duces a tobacco with less aroma than a district with
dry atmospheric conditions.
115. By the Chairman. —Are you satisfied with the
results of your one year and ten months in Australia in
carrying out your investigation ? Do you think that the
results are being obtained sufficiently rapidly to justify
the expenditure incurred?— That, of course, is a diffi-
cult question to answer. In experimental work the
experimenter is never satisfied. He is always trying to
discover something new.
116. Has sufficient been achieved in view of the sub-
stantial expenditure incurred ?—I should say, yes. We
have a large amount of work in progress, and we are
planning still further investigation, I received
authorization from the executive committee at the last
meeting to carry out work on different stations in the
districts of Tamworth and Myrtleford. We have
certain indications from our preliminary work, and we
want to be in possession of areas in the present com-
mercial districts, so that the tests can be carried out


in close proximity to the growers. When the investi-
gations started each of the States was a party to the
agreement, and contributed to the funds. It was felt,
therefore, that the experimental work should be done
in each State in co-operation with the State Depart-
ments of Agriculture. In the case of Hew South Wales
work was undertaken at Bathurst, and in Victoria at
Wahgunyah. In addition to these tests, we are now
planning experiments to be conducted in the heart of
the growing districts. We thought that the growers’
organizations would be satisfied if they could see this
work being carried out. We also felt that if it were
done on the soils in the commercial districts the results
w r ould be directly applicable.
117. So you think that the Federal investigation
since you have been been in Australia has produced
results that are quite satisfactory, in view of the expen-
diture of about £21,000? —So far as expenditure on
experimental work can be satisfying, yes.
118. Do you think that the experiments would
warrant a higher rate of expenditure? Could you get
better results and obtain them more quickly if the
expenditure were doubled?—lt certainly would enable
more work to be carried out. The expenditure could
possibly be increased somewhat, with value to the in-
dustry.
119. Has the investigation committee considered that
aspect?—-Ho. All the experimental work is only just
getting under way, and it is difficult for me to estimate
ihe expenditure required from year to year.
120. What department has been created since you
arrived in Australia? —We have created no department
in that sense. We have an agronomist, an assistant
agronomist, an assistant pathologist, and two field
superintendents. We also have one clerk and a typist.
We avail ourselves as much as possible of the assistance
of the State officials, and that help has been considei’-
able. We are in touch with the State experts.
121. Is it a fact that there is considerable friction
between certain tobacco experts employed by several
States and yourself ? —Hot so far as I am aware.
122. You have had no evidence of it?—Ho direct
evidence.
123. Do they keep out of your way and avoid con-
sultation with you? Do one or two of them under-
estimate the value of your work as Federal Director?
Have you any evidence of that? —Only in press state-
ments that have been made from time to time.
124. Is there any hostility towards your work from
these State Departments?—lt will be readily under-
stood that an officer like myself would have a certain
amount of feeling to overcome in the State Depart-
ments of Agriculture, and in other circles. Here was
a field which had not previously been touched by a
Federal organization.
125. Is this difficulty disappearing? —I think so.
126. Would you say it arises from resentment on the
part of the State departments, because of the possi-
bility of the creation of a Federal department, that will
really be superior to them ?—Probably that would have
a great deal to do with their attitude. At the same
time I emphasize that our relations with the State
departments have been cordial, and I have no com-
plaint in regard to them.
127. Have they done everything required to assist
you?— Hot in all cases, but in co-operative work it is
often found necessary to arrive at something in the
nature of a compromise. The State Departments have
a view-point, and they have a right to view their
activities in their own field, in a way that suits them,
based on their past experience. Haturally, we have to
make some compromise.
128. Did you find that there was no co-operation
between the State departments and that they were
separate entities? —That is always the case, and may
be considered an inherent defect in State work.
129. Do you regard the industry as presenting
essentially a Commonwealth problem?— Yes. We find
tobacco of different qualities produced in various parts
of Australia. The problem is to find out what may
be the use for the various tobaccoes grown throughout
the Commonwealth, and the possible advantage of
blending the leaf grown in one district with that pro-
duced in other districts. In that way we may be able
to overcome certain objectionable characteristics. The
problem can best be dealt with by the Commonwealth
in co-operation with the States.
130. If the experiments now being conducted by the
Commonwealth were gradually reduced at the end of
the first three-year period, is it likely that the States
Avould take the inquiry up where you had left off, and
pursue the subject to some definite conclusion ?—They
might; but that would be a more costly proposition than
the present arrangement. It would be more economical
for the Commonwealth and the States to continue the
investigation, and it would still be desirable for each
State to go on with its present work. In the opinion
of the executive committee, and in my opinion, the
functions of the Federal investigation should be largely
experimental, and we should leave to the States the
work that they have been largely doing in the past in
giving direct assistance to the growers in the way of
publicity and advice about curing methods.
131. If a federal department of tobacco were estab-
lished with a permanent director, do you think it would
still be necessary for the States to maintain their present
departments, some of whom might be hostile to the
federal works?— That would be necessary only in those
States where tobacco production is a commercial enter-
prise of value to those States, and that matter should
be left to the various States.
132. Suppose the States abolished their present
departments and handed the whole matter over to the
Commonwealth, do you think the interests of the in-
dustry could be safeguarded more economically than
at present ?—On my experience of agricultural experi-
mental work in Canada and the United States of
America I should say that the States should have men
to make direct contact with the growers in all cases
where those States have a commercial going activity,
and that the federal body should be concerned with
problems that transcend State matters.
133. Can you make it clear just what work should
be left to the State?—My attitude is based on experience
as a representative of the Federal Governments of the
United States and Canada in carrying out experimental
work on tobacco in co-operation with the different States
and provinces. Haturally, the work is not done in an
exactly similar maimer in both countries. In the
United States of America, the situation is somewhat
different from that in Canada, because in addition to
the Federal Department of Agriculture, which is a
very large and efficient organization, there are also some
large State agricultural experimental stations, generally
conducted in connexion with State universities. The
relationship between the Federal Department and the
State institutions is quite cordial. The Federal Depart-
ment recognizes that certain types of work must be
carried out in the district where the problems are to be
met. In that case a federal officer is detailed to work
Avith a State agricultural experimental station. The
usual procedure there is for the Federal Government to
pay the salary of the man who is definitely on the staff
of the Federal department, and to pay all his travelling
expenses. The agricultural experimental station fur-
nishes him with laboratory and offices, land, labour, and


equipment, and anything he wishes within the limits of
its organization. It is supposed to he a half and half
arrangement, so far as expenses are concerned. The
results are usually published co-operatively, though they
may be published by both parties, together with a state-
ment that the work has been carried out co-operatively.
1 am now referring to agricultural experimentation in
general. In Canada the situation is somewhat different,
in that under the British-North American Act the agri-
cultural experimental work is largely left to the federal
organization. There is a strong Federal Department
of Agriculture which has done a great deal of excellent
work, and it has a series of branch experimental stations
scattered throughout the dominion. At Ottawa, where
the headquarters are located, there is a staff composed
of a number of divisions, and the heads of these divisions
are responsible for the work done at the branch stations.
The expense is borne wholly by the Federal Department.
Agricultural experimental stations are also carried on
in connexion with the agricultural colleges in the dif-
ferent provinces, but they are by no means as extensive
as those in the United States of America.
134. In America and Canada, which- authority would
control the type of work you are now doing?— The
federal authorities, in co-operation with the States.
135. Have you been here long enough to express an
opinion on the value of the work that the States have
done in the past in tobacco cultivation?—No; it would
be rather difficult to express an opinion.
136. I suppose you have been more in touch with the
Victorian State departments than with those in other
States?— Yes, because our headquarters are established
in Melbourne.
137. Was any reason given to you why they should
be located in Alelbourne?—When the investigation was
begun, Melbourne was the headquarters of the Chair-
man of the Development and Aligration Commission,
and also of the Chief Executive Officer of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research, and it seemed
logical that our headquarters should be close to them.
One advantage was the cutting down of expenditure in
travelling.
138. When the Development and Migration Commis-
sion is disbanded will there be any particular reason
why you should be quartered in Alelbourne rather than
in any other State?— Not so far as I can see.
139. Would it be practicable for you to carry out
your work from Canberra?—-That could be done, but
cither Sydney or Alelbourne would be preferable.
140. What States have you visited?—l have seen the
humid districts in the five mainland States. On each
trip I have attempted to spend as much time as I could
spare from my other duties to look over the general
situation of the industry. I have tried to visit each
State at least once a year. Of course, New South
Wales and Victoria have received the major share of
attention, because in those States are the principal com-
mercial areas. In Queensland, I have been as far north
as the Mareeba-Cairns district. There is no commercial
cultivation of tobacco in Tasmania, but I have been to
Western Australia. I have obtained a fairly extensive
knowledge'of the industry, and I try to keep in contact
with the growers. I addressed a meeting of growers at
Tam worth, and I have spoken at a number of meetings
in other places.
141. Did you find the growers were keenly interested
and asked a lot of questions?— Yes.
142. Wbuld you say that they are men of a fairly
high standard of intelligence?— Undoubtedly they are,
but that does not mean that their efficiency is as great
as that of the growers in Canada.
143. But do you think they are eager for information
to let them know where their methods are wrong?—
Yes,
144, Have the methods pursued by the State depart-
ments for many years been adequate to satisfy the
thirst of more information about the industry?— The
figures speak for themselves. The fact that the to-
bacco acreage has remained practically stationary for
a number of years indicates that there is something
wrong. The efforts of the State departments in the
two large States have been continuous for well over
30 years.
145. The fact that the Commonwealth has tried to
lead the inquiries regarding the industry indicates that
things have reached a dead end?— That would be sub-
stantially the situation.
146. Is there anything substantial in the statement
broadcast very liberally in the last twelve or eighteen
months that the fundamental fault with the Australian
tobacco grown in the present areas is eucalyptus taint?
—At present, on the basis of the experimental work
so far done, we are not able to say that the aroma of
the leaf grown in the present districts is due to the
eucalyptus oils.
147. You say that there is an objectionable aroma in
the tobaccoes at present produced?— That has to be
admitted.
148. Is that aroma so bad as to make the smoking
of Australian tobacco quite impossible ?—ln some cases,
yes.
149. How do you account for the fact that some
growers make up their own tobacco and smoke it?—
That is so.
150. Have you ever sampled any of the tobacco
that Air. Temple Smith has made up?— Yes.
151. Do you consider it so objectionable as to be
unacceptable to the Australian consumer?— Not at all.
We found that leaf with a certain texture and of a
certain colour is likely to have a certain aroma. The
texture of the leaf has a great deal to do with the
aroma.
152. Is it not possible that a good deal of the Aus-
tralian tobacco would not be objectionable to the
average smoker?— Take the 1928 tests. On testing
48 lots selected from the crops of twenty Victorian
growers, we found that 10 per cent, of the leaf had
a mild agreeable aroma, 29 per cent, a passable aroma,
31 per cent, an indifferent to poor aroma, and 29 per
cent, an aroma that was definitely bad. The figures
for New South Wales were not greatly different.
153. Is it not evident from the qualifications made
that there is an element of uncertainty about the whole
matter ? On the figures you have given, Australian
tobacco cannot be classed as having a definitely objec-
tionable aroma? —Not all of it.
154. Have you secured data on which the allegation
was made by State experts?— Yes.
155. Did Mr. Tregenna furnish you with any data?
—lt is in the form of a report to the executive com-
mittee on the experiments of the first two years by
Dr. Darnell-Smith.
156. Until twelve months ago the Australian tobacco-
growers had never been confronted with the allegation
as to the defect referred to?— Our experiments to date
have not borne out the theory that the aroma of the leaf
in general in New South Wales and Victoria which in
many cases is bad. is due to eucalyptus oil or phellan-
drene.
157. Have you carried out any field tests in that
regard?^—Not yet, but tests are planned for the near
future. The Bathurst aroma tests were taken over by
the Australian Tobacco Investigation, and since they
have been definitely under my personal super-
vision certain very important evidence has been
secured. We are not in a position at present
to discuss that evidence in detail. We have


summarized the results in the progress report.
Briefly, we found that fresh eucalyptus leaves in the
soil had a definite effect on the aroma, but after they
had been in the soil one year they improved the aroma
on the particular soil on which we were experimenting.
That soil was light sand.
158. Do you say there is no evidence available or in
your hands to-day to justify the allegation that Aus-
tralian tobacco suffers from that fundamental defect ?
We have very little evidence at present which would
lead us to the statement that phellandrene might be a
factor.
159. Is there sufficient evidence at present on which
to base such a charge?—No, not so far as our organiza-
tion is concerned.
160. Do you say it is possible that the investigation
may ultimately prove that to be so ?—lt may ultimately
prove anything. At present we have a great many
significant facts. For instance, we have found, on
the basis of one year’s tests, that urea appeared to
have a distinctly beneficial effect on ordinary New
South Wales river terrace soil, and that eucalyptus
leaves improve the aroma after twelve mouths.
161. Is eucalyptus taint more likely to be beneficial
than harmful? —We are not in a position at present to
formulate a theory as to what the aroma is due to.
It may possibly be due to some harmful organic in-
fluence or simply to an excess of nitrogen or an up-
setting of the balance of nitrates in the soil.
162. Have you come across any definite taste of
eucalyptus in any Australian tobacco you have smoked?
—I think not.
163. Do you consider it fair in the interests of the
industry that this charge should be left hanging over
it, as it has for the last eighteen months, without some
definite attempt being made by your organization or by
the State experts to refute it?—l think the attitude of
the executive committee has Ibeen fairly set out.
164. That is that sufficient data is not available on
which to base that charge?— Yes, and that is still our
attitude. If our present season’s tests are confirmatory
of those carried out in the past—l am speaking of the
Bathurst aroma tests —we shall make a definite state-
ment in about eight months.
165. Supposing all the supplies of foreign tobacjo
were shut out of Australia to-morrow, do you think
that the tobacco at present being produced here, with
all its defects, would be regarded by the Australian
smoking public as a very acceptable substitute?—lt is
possible that they would smoke it. I have no doubt
that, if they could not get outside tobacco, they would
have to be dependent upon home supplies. The average
Anglo-Saxon smoker is rather particular about the
tobacco he uses.
166. Are you familiar with the South African pro-
duct?— Yes.
167. Do you think any Australian tobacco would
compare favorably with any South African leaf?—
No.
168. Do you know that Boer tobacco is pretty deadly
stuff?—l would class it as peculiar. As you go into
Nyasaland and other districts, you get tobacco with still
different characteristics. One of the outstanding facts
of the present investigation is that Western Australian
tobacco is different from that grown in Victoria and
New South Wales.
169. You seem to have been favorably impressed
with Western Australian tobacco?— Yes.
170. If it were made up into 100 per cent. Australian
smokes would it compare favorably with any South
African tobacco you have smoked?—We have not yet
secured sufficient quantities of Western Australian
tobacco that is properly aged. Our tests to date are
from raw leaf. In a manufacturing test you must
take a number of samples from a number of districts.
171. Do you not think that the Australian leaf in a
properly manufactured condition would be much more
likely to be acceptable?—l have strongly advocated
that it should be aged for at least a year before being
manufactured. That is done in practically all cases.
172. Are you familiar with French tobacco?—l have
smoked some of it.
173. Do you know the reputation it has amongst
Australian returned soldiers? —There you have the
case of a government monopoly. The French Govern-
ment depends upon the tobacco monopoly for a very
large proportion of its income. The product is obtained
by the use of low grade imported tobacco blended with
locally-grown leaf. The Government prescribes the
places where it shall be grown and the prices to be
paid to the growers, and they are not very remunera-
tive prices.
174. By Mr. Jones. —Do not the growers participate
in the fixing of the prices?— They have nothing to say
about it; the Government decides that.
175. In a letter received by the Queensland Govern-
ment direct from France, I saw an official statement
that the French Government does not fix the price, but
that it is determined by a committee on which the
growers are represented?— The governmental members
of that committee probably have a very strong voice in
the matter. I shall look into that point.
176. By Mr. Morgan. —What is phellandrene?—
Eucalyptus oil is composed of a number of other, oils,
of which phellandrene is one.
177. I suppose that, despite scientific investigation,
the ultimate result will depend on what the people are
prepared to buy?— Yes, the demands of the consuming
public govern the production of tobacco almost entirely.
We have many districts where production has been dis-
continued, because the demand of the public for the
leaf produced there has ceased.
178. By the Chairman. —On the results obtained
from the 1928 tests, the manufacturers could use at
much as 22f per cent, of Australian-grown leaf without
seriously affecting the smoking qualities of the tobacco ?
—Not quite that. We state that the locally-produced
tobacco could be blended with American leaf in fairly
large proportions.
179. Do you mean that the whole of that 22| per
cent, could be safely blended? —The proportion would
vary. The 22| per cent, included samples graded as
having a passable or fair aroma, as well as those which
had a mild or agreeable aroma.
180. Will you explain the principal classes and
qualities of the leaf used in manufacture ?—Flue-cured
tobacco is usually classified into lugs, cutters, heavy
cutters, fillers, and wrappers, with an extra grade called
primings, which refers to leaf that has been harvested
when immature. These grades are based on texture;
but, in addition to that, the leaf of the flue-cured type
is classed under different colours, such as lemon, orange,
bright mahogany, mahogany, and dark. There are non-
descript and green grades as well, and there are varia-
tions in between the colours I have mentioned. What
we call mahogany here is very different from what
is regarded as mahogany leaf in America. What is
classed here as mahogany would be definitely classed as
dark in America. In addition to the factors of colour
and texture there are some grades in America that
are made according to size, although size is not con-
sidered important in flue-cured tobacco. In addition
to grades based on texture, colour, and size, there is
also a quality basis, such as lemon colours Nos. 1, 2
and 3, the numbers referring to the quality of that
particular grade. In Australia we have a limited
number of grades based largely on the colour of the
leaf. Possibly much more could be done in the matter
of improvement in grading.


181. What is the best quality of tobacco produced
in Australia ?—The lemon grade. The purchasers of
this leaf have to make some distinction between a lemon
grade which is not first-class with all the leaves uniform,
and one which includes leaves which should not he
there, and where the colour is not good enough.
182. On page 26 of your bulletin you say—
From the growers’ stand-point it would appear that if
leaf of lighter texture and colour could be produced, the strong
objectionable aromatic properties would be overcome.
Does that mean that the only safe course to pursue
is to produce leaf of a light texture and colour?— Yes,
in the present areas.
183. Are the growers not doing that?—Ho, not as
they should. You will notice that we found 4.48 per
cent, of bright leaf including lemon and bright
mahogany in the leaf we tested.
184. Have you seen a 50 per cent, production of
lemon and bright leaf?— Yes, at Pomonal.
185. What do you mean when you refer on page 29
to the “vast amount of work” remaining to be done?
Do you mean work covering a long period of years? —
Yes. On many of the points it would take at least
ten years to reach a definite conclusion.
186. After 300 years of experience in tobacco-
growing other countries are faced with these problems?
■ —Yes. We must know what is the best variety for
each district, and what is the best fertilizer to use. In
1926-27 the United States Department of Agriculture
published a bulletin on the fertilization of flue-cured
tobacco, and the data on which it was based had been
compiled during the previous fifteen years.
187. Are there many tobacco pests in the United
States of America and Canada ? Are they similar to
ours?— Yes, with the exception that in Canada they do
not include blue mould. This disease is not peculiar
to Australia. The first report of blue mould is from
Southern California, and it has been known for years
in the Argentine.
188. The opinion is that it is due to the moisture
in the atmosphere?— Moisture is probably the most
important meteorological factor.
Does your work embrace experiments regarding blue
mould ?—Yes.
190. Have you investigated any other tobacco pests
in Australia ?—We have done little or nothing with
any other disease up to the present. We intend to
attack these problems; but we have figured that our
first work should be on those problems which, seem to
be most pressing.
191. I take it that you regard it as desirable to
maintain federal direction of the investigations, in
co-operation with the States?— Yes.
192. Do you think it necessary to establish a federal
“Department of Tobacco Research” similar to that
in Canada?- —Such a department might be a very good
thing as a permanent federal organization.
193. Could it be conducted any less expensively than
the present organization? Could it be run for £lO,OOO
a year?—l have not given a great deal of thought to
that matter. The amount of work we could do in a
year would naturally depend on the money made
available.
194. Is £lO,OOO a year sufficient to enable you to
carry out all the w r ork you have in view? —I should
like twice as much.
195. A vote of £20,000 a year would put the Tobacco
Investigation on a sound footing?— Yes; but I do not
suggest that it could not be carried on by a smaller
appropriation than that. At present we are carrying
out experiments in each of the five mainland States.
We ought to see them at least once a year, and, there-
fore, the expenditure on travel is high; but as time
goes on the work can be better organized, and probably
the expenditure will not be so great. The Common-
wealth Government was deriving approximately
£6,000,000 per annum in revenue from the tobacco
industry before the recent increase in duty. If there
are no changes in the imports and in the use of tobacco
it is probable that the Government will increase its
income in the current year by £1,000,000, making the
total amount taken £7,000,000 per annum. As one
who is interested in tlie development and improvement
of the industry I consider that the Federal Government
might well devote a fraction of that money to efforts
to place the industry on an improved basis.
196. By Mr. Morgan. —Referring to page 25 of your
bulletin, you say that 22.53 per cent, of the 1928 crop
tested could he safely blended with American leaf.
Apparently the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
does not see eye to eye with your organization?— That
is so.
197. Assuming that the company did blend 22 per
cent, of the crop, what would become of the remaining
78 per cent.?—l suppose some of it would be destroyed
in order to get rid of it. I have been informed that
this is done.
198. By Mr. Jones. —Dealing with the experimental
work in Queensland, you point out on page 20 of your
bulletin that 44 lots out of 136, or 32.5 per cent., had
a “ mild, agreeable aroma.” You say on page 33 of the
progress report that, of a total of 33 lots tested, 82 per
cent, were regarded as possessing a mild and agreeable
aroma?—We had fewer lots in Queensland last year.
The tobacco was grown in larger quantities.
199. Is not 82 per cent, quite good?— Yes. The
progress report oi the Executive Committee, referring
to the 1928 series of tests, states that—
Even the best and mildest samples from Victoria and New
South Wales carry a slight tang suggesting turpentine, while
Western Australian tobacco has a full, sweetish aroma. North
Queensland flue-cured leaf carries an indefinable, but not
objectionable tang, characteristic of all North Queensland
tobacco. The Pomonal district in Victoria produces cured
leaf with a different aroma from that of Ovens Valley
tobacco.
200. You do not say whether the aroma of the Pomo-
nal leaf is agreeable or otherwise?—lt is largely agree-
able.
201. What about the Ovens Valley?— Tobacco from
Ovens Valley, Tamworth and Tumut seems to be quite
agreeable if the leaf is not too heavy. The light, thin
grades are not objectionable, but anything with a heavy
texture is likely to have an objectionable aroma.
202. Is there any reason why Australia should not
produce enough tobacco to meet its own requirements?
—That is not done in any part of the world, even in
the most important tobacco-producing countries. The
United States of America exports possibly from
200,000,000 to 300,000,000 dollars worth each year, but
it also imports 100, 000,000 dollars worth a year for use
in manufacture.
203. To what extent is it possible for Australia to
meet its own requirement?—lf our efforts to improve
the quality of the local leaf succeeds, we can reasonably
expect to supply the major portion of the leaf required
by the Australian consumer, possibly 60 or 70 per
cent.
204. Did you say earlier that perhaps Australia could
supply its own requirements, and also have some for
export?— When we are supplying the major portion of
our domestic needs I hope Australia will take its place
with the other dominions in the export of leaf. That
is looking a long way ahead.
The witness withdrew.
Temple Alsop Jennings Smith, Tobacco Expert,
Department of Agriculture, Victoria, was called,
sworn and examined.
205. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position?— For 30 years, except that I
was on the Soldiers Settlers Board for two years,


206. Have you a statement to present to the com-
mittee?—l have prepared a number of statements. I
submit three samples of cigarettes manufactured from
Australian leaf. One is entirely Australian leaf, one
contains 20 per cent, of Virginian tobacco, and the third
has 13 per cent, of Turkish tobacco. I also submit
samples of an all-Australian tobacco known as “ 888
I also produce a gold medal awarded at the Panama
Exhibition in 1914 for tobacco exported from Victoria.
I submit reports of experts and others on the quality
and value of four different grades of tobacco sent to
England, as well as reports from the agents who asked
for the handling of that tobacco when Australia was
in a position to export it in any quantity.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
{Taken at Melbourne.)
FRIDAY, 24th JANUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones I Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens j Mr. Tully,
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company; Mr. C. M. Slagg, repre-
senting the Australian Tobacco Investigation: Mr.
Temple Smith, Expert, Department of Agriculture,
Victoria).
Temple Alsop Jennings Smith, Tobacco Expert,
Department of Agriculture, Victoria, was recalled
and further examined.
207. By the Chairman. —I understand you wish to
draw the committee’s attention to a certain matter?—
Yes. A report of the proceedings before this committee
published in last night’s Herald was headed, “ Tobacco-
Growing Languishes.” That statement is not correct,
so far as Victoria is concerned. When I took over the
work in 1901 less than 200 acres was under cultivation,
and to-day the area has been increased to 1,260 acres,
or even more. The statement that the industry lan-
guishes despite the duty of 3s. per lb. is not quite cor-
rect, because the duty is not yet fully operative.
208. Have you statements to present to the com-
mittee?— Yes. My first statement is as follows:
MAIN POINTS IN HISTORY OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY.
Prior to the year 1900 the bulk of the tobacco leaf grown
was produced by Chinese on the share system with white land-
owners, the varieties used being more calculated to yield
the heaviest possible crops, and the richest land was selected
for this purpose. The resultant crops were heavy, dark and
coarse. All the leaf was air-cured in primitive sheds, which
did not tend to improve the quality of the leaf. Prices up
to this period ranged from 3d. per lb. to Bd. per lb.
In 1898 a glut occurred, and tobacco was unsaleable at
any price, and to relieve the situation the Victorian Govern-
ment established a stemmery at Wangaratta, where the leaf
could be reconditioned and stripped, and paid a bonus of 3d.
per lb. on all leaf shipped to England in 1901. More than
100 tons was exported, and realized prices ranging from 4d.
to per lb. At that time, American leaf of the same
grades, sold on the London market at from 5 to 10 cents.
Messrs. Maxwell, the agents who handled this leaf, reported:—
“ This price, considering the state of the market, is an ex-
tremely good one.” { vide Age 7th January, 1902.) And later
the Victorian agency cabled: —“The English manufacturers
who purchased this tobacco regret the cessation of shipments
from Victoria.” (vide Age sth February, 1903.)
In 1901, the area under tobacco fell to 103 acres, only
seventeen growers operating owing to the uncertain market,
and the Chinese element from that time onward gradually
became eliminated to such an extent that to-day not more than
2 per cent are engaged in the industry. From the year 1901,
the area has gradually increased to 1,200 acres, and prices
reached 25., 2s. 6d., 3s. 3d. per lb.
Flue curing became general about 1920, and a shipment
of leaf to England, to test the value and quality of Vic-
torian leaf, was made, which was valued at Is. per lb. for
air-cured leaf and Is. 6d. and Is. 9d. per lb. for flue-cured
leaf. About this time the British-Australasian Tobacco Co.
gave a guarantee to purchase Victorian leaf at prices rang-
ing from 9d. for dark leaf to 2s. 6d. for lemon leaf, and later
offered a bonus on the better grades of 3d. per lb., which
was increased to 6d. per lb., and again, last season, to Is. per
lb. on the top grades. At the prices paid for the different
grades until last season, it paid growers to grow the heavy
dark types, and much capital was invested in land, buildings
and plant. The prices obtained for the heavy leaf, together
with large yields resulted in the continued production of
this type of leaf (see “Economic Survey Report”). The
recent additions to the import duty should go far towards
inducing growers to produce bright leaf provided a fair pro-
portion of the added duty is passed on to the producers.
However, growers have no power to enforce their rights in
this respect.
209. You refer in your report to the establishment of
a government stemmery at Wangaratta in 1901. What
became of that?—lt was not required after the glut
of tobacco had been disposed of. The building was
merely rented. The plant was very small, and would
not have involved an expenditure of more than £250.
210. The Victorian Government also paid a bonus
of 3d. a lb. on all leaf shipped to England in 1901?
A little over 100 tons went to England, and 70 tons
went to South Australia. That was the only occasion
when that was done. The Government has not been
approached since to do anything like that. The growers
have discussed the provision of a central grading estab-
lishment. It is impossible to-day to get the growers
to grade their tobacco properly. Australia is in a had
position, as compared with the American grower, be-
cause we have no middlemen or dealers to buy up the
loose leaf, treat and age it, and prepare it for the dif-
ferent markets. It is impossible to induce half a dozen
growers to grade even a small part of the tobacco evenly.
211. Would not the buyer have to take all those dif-
ferent grades and re-grade them?—lt is a matter of
great complaint to-day that the grading of tobacco,
at any rate in Victoria, is bad. Some 700 or 800 bales
were rejected by the buyer this year, partly on account
of bad grading. I advocate the establishment of a
central grading warehouse, preferably in Melbourne.
In my opinion, the work could be done more cheaply
and better in that way than by the grower doing it him-
self.
212. By Mr. Bentley. —Do you not think that what-
ever is done the grower should be educated in the grad-
ing?— That is a good idea. The natural tendency with
a great many growers is to “ ring in ” leaf of an in-
ferior grade to that to which it belongs. Some growers
could never be taught to grade.
213. Regarding the 700 or 800 bales rejected, we had
arranged to send our buyer back to the growers. Is
not that personal contact desirable so that the growers
can be individually coached ?—ln my opinion, the work
would be better done by experienced men. The buyer
is the best judge of the grade he requires,
214. By Mr. Jones. —Would not the risk of their
crop being left on their hands be a strong lesson to
them? —It should, but that is not going to overcome
the difficulty.
215. By the Chairman. —Would you have the central
grading establishment provided at the - Government’s
expense?—l have urged growers to make a levy on the
tobacco sold each year, with a view to getting a fund
to enable them to establish their own warehouse, which
should then be subsidized by the Government.
216. How was that suggestion received?— Very badly.
217. By Mr. Morgan. —Are the growers in a position
to do that?— l think so. With a 10s. a ton levy they
would get a few hundred pounds behind them. In the
United States of America the co-operative tobacco
growers’ associations were offered a large sum of money
by the Government, I believe $30,000,000, to establish
warehouses, not only for grading, but also for re-hand-
ling their tobacco and selling it.
218. By the Chairman. —That would be essentially
a State Government function. The Commonwealth


Government could hardly be expected to establish a
warehouse of that kind?—l do not see why it should
not be a State concern, and I do not see why it should
not be made self-supporting. I have had literature
from the United States of America recently showing
that tobacco can be regraded, packed and prepared for
market for less than 3£ cents per lb.
219. The shipment of Victorian tobacco to Great
Britain in 1901 was repeated in 1920. Why was
exportation stopped for practically twenty years?—We
were following much the same old methods up to 1914.
That is chiefly air-curing. It was not until 1920 that
growers began to flue-cure their leaf, and that turned
out to be an immense improvement. To test the value
of the tobacco on the London market, the second ship-
ment was made. The first shipment was all air-cured
leaf. In the second shipment there was one grade of
air-cured and the rest was flue-cured. No lemon
tobacco was sent in 1920.
220. By Mr. Jones. —You compared the prices of the
first lot sent away with the American prices, but you
said nothing of the second lot?- —Later on I mentioned
that up to 1921 the American tobaccoes of the same
grade sold up to Is. lOd. per lb.
221. Tty the Chairman. —You refer in your state-
ment to a cable published in the Age of sth February,
1903, stating that the English manufacturers regretted
the cessation of shipments from Victoria. Why should
there be any cessation? —Because at that time a revival
of the purchasing of tobacco took place in Victoria,
and the local prices offered a better paying proposi-
tion.
222-3. By Mr. Jones. —In 1901-2 there was not much
difference in the quality of American and Australian
grown leaf ?—I certainly think it pointed in that direc-
tion. Messrs. Phillips & Wright, who were asked to
furnish opinions, wrote on the 16th January, 1922 —
“We were verbally informed that, should any of this
tobacco be shipped to this country, it would be put in our
hands for sale and in view of the trouble we have taken,
we shall be glad to have this confirmed.”
Mr. C. M. Shroeder, of Nottingham, wrote on the
19th November, 1921 —
“ I would, therefore, strongly advise you if you wish to
establish your tobacco on the English market, to ship a few
bales on consignment to me or to a bank in this country in
the first place, and I shall be pleased to sell the same for
you and to report thereon.
You run no risks whatever, and I feel confident that it will
lead to our doing a large and prosperous business together.”
224. By the Chairman. —Was further action taken to
follow that up?—lt was a better paying proposition to
sell on the Australian market.
225. Apart from the 1901 and 1920 consignment no
attempt has been jmade by the Victorian growers to
open up an export trade? —That is so.
226. Was that done under the direction of the Vic-
torian Government?— Yes.
227. By Mr. Bentley. —Regarding the 1921 shipment,
that was specially selected tobacco sent for exhibition
purposes, was it not?—lt was. a fair sample of our
better grades. There was a bright mahogany, some
dark leaf, some heavy leaf, and some air-cured. There
was no lemon-coloured. You could not call it a selected
sample. It was sold all round at Is. a lb.
228. By Mr. Slagg. —What was the average price at
that time for similar grades ?—ls, 10Jd.
229. Are you familiar with the market conditions in
Liverpool and London? —No.
230. Do you think that Victorian leaf could be sold
at reasonable prices on the English market? —Yes.
The following reports, dated 26th October, 1921,
received from Messrs. Phillips & Wright will answer
that question:—
We have examined the six samples of Australian leaf which
you have submitted to us for our report. These samples may
be described as follows:
D.M. 1. —Fair length, colory but mixed.
D.M. 2. —Long, colory.
D.M. 3.—Good bright orange leaf.
H.P. 4. —Long, dark, smooth.
H.P. 5. —Dark, rather rough,
A.C. 6.—Colory, mixed, rather ragged and broken.
We have tested the samples marked D.M. 3 and H.P. 4,
which we consider the best of their respective grades, in the
pipe, and the burn and flavour is quite satisfactory.
The flavour is sweet and soft, with no heat or unpleasant
twang, while the burning is all that could be desired.
We. consider that tobaccoes like these samples would come
to a very good market in this country, and find favour with
manufacturers, if they could be imported to sell at some-
where about the prices we estimate as their present value.
In view of the large reduction in the present cost of all
American tobacco, and the low prices at which Nyasaland
and similar competing growths are being sold at, we should
put the value of these Australian samples at somewhere about
Is. 6d. per lb. for the dark, and Is. 9d. per lb, for the colory
grades.
These samples are packed in bales, but we are of opinion
that if the tobacco were packed in the usual American hogs-
heads, further improvement would be apparent, as the leaf
matures and improves in flavour by being packed in wood,
and at the same time this method has a great advantage
over packing in bales, owing to the protection it affords the
contents from breakage and damage in transit. This is a
very important consideration.
We need scarcely point out that one of
and most important considerations in all tobacco imported
for home use in this country is the condition, i.e., the amount
of moisture it contains. This should not amount to more
than 12 per cent., or at the outside, 14 per cent.
I can assure you that none of these grades is as good
as our best grades now.
231. By Mr. Bentley. —That report indicates that all
the tests in Australia are wrong, including tests by
the Imperial Institute. It also suggests that the Aus-
tralian smoker is wrong, because, despite everything
that has been done, he refuses to take any large quanti-
ties of Australian tobacco? —That tobacco was sent to
England for independent reports, and I have given you
one of them.
232. By Mr. Slagg.- —Have you other reports? —Yes,
I have handed them all in to the committee.
233. By the Chairman. —Do you consider the bonus
of Is. a lb. offered by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company on the better grades of Victorian leaf has
stimulated production in Victoria?—l do not think it
has stimulated the bright types as far as they might
be encouraged. So far as the Is. a lb. goes, only last
season’s crop benefited, and I do not think 30 per cent,
of the whole crop commanded the higher bonus. Lemon
and bright mahogany were the two grades. At
Pomonal the growers are producing more than 30 per
cent, of the bright leaf, but in other districts not 10
per cent. The bonus of 6d. is on the bright leaf too.
It would be an average of about 9d. a lb. on all bright
grades.
234, Did that not encourage the growers?—No doubt
it will encourage them. As a matter of fact there is
an increased area going in at Pomonal this year, and
from now on the increased bonus will be the means of
encouraging the production of a larger quantity of
bright tobacco.
235. With this average bonus of 9d., what would
be the fair average price of bright leaf in Victoria
to-day?— From 2s. 6d. to 2s. 9d. a lb. including the
bonus. The guaranteed price for the bright mahogany
is 25., and the bonus is paid on that. The guaranteed
price for the lemon tobacco is 2s. 6d. and the growers
have received up to 3s. 6d. for that leaf.
236. By Mr. Bentley. —The average price paid by us
in 1929 for the bright leaf in Victoria was 3s. Id.
There is no question of an average bonus on bright
grades. The bonus is a straight out Is.?— That was
subject to the duty being confirmed.


237. By Mr. Jones. —Regarding the 1901 shipment
to England, you say in your statement that it realized
from 4d. to 6|d, a lb., and at the same time American
leaf of the same qualities sold in London at from 5 to
10 cents a lb. So the Australian samples brought
actually higher prices?— Yes.
238. And they were a fair average sample?— They
consisted of tobaccoes that were held by the farmers in
the glut.
239. So, in 1901, Australian tobacco held its own
against American tobacco on the London market?—
Apparently.
240. In the second shipment it brought from Is. 6d.
to Is. 9d. a lb. for flue-cured leaf, while American leaf
of similar grade realized up to Is. 10d.? —Yes.
241. So in 1920 Australian tobacco held its own
again?— Yes, according to these reports. The tobaccoes
we grow to-day are very little superior to those we sent
in 1920. Messrs Maxwell, the agents, said that con-
sidering the market the price was extremely good.
242. By the Chairman. —You say in your statement
that at the prices paid for the different grades until
last season, it paid the growers to produce the heavy,
dark type, and that much capital was invested in land,
buildings and plant. Does that mean it would not
pay them to grow heavy, dark tobacco to-day?—lf the
company is not going to buy it or will only purchase
10 per cent, of it, it will not pay them to grow the
dark types.
243. Does that mean that the company is definitely
refusing to-day to buy what you class as a dark
tobacco?—lt is taking a certain percentage, but it is
refusing a quantity this year and in the 1931 season.
244. Mahogany is included, and you think it is not
necessarily dark?—lt is and it is not. Our mahogany
leaf in Victoria is a better grade of the dark type.
245. The company has notified growers that it is
restricting the purchase of dark tobacco to 10 per cent,
of the total crop?— That is so. That operates in 1931.
246. Are the prices, plus the bonus, adequate to
stimulate the production to a satisfactory extent? —I
think the prices paid for the right leaf are good. A
good average price would he 3s. Id. for the bright
leaf, but that is only the price paid last season. It ia
an excellent price compared with overseas figures.
247-8. Has there been any marked stimulation of pro-
duction?— There has not been time yet. The growers
were not sure they would get that 3s. Id. until the new
duty was ratified, but from conversations I have had
with growers and from things that have happened, I
know that this price will stimulate the growing of better
quality leaf. The increased import duty has had a
good deal to do with it.
249. If the company maintains an average of 3s.
for the bright class, that will be quite sufficient to
encourage the industry for a considerable period?— Yes,
but another question comes in there, and that is Aus-
tralian parity. I have prepared the following state-
ment on the matter: —
AUSTRALIAN PARITY.
Australian growers contend that they are not concerned
with world’s parity, in that local production only amounts
to a small percentage of local requirements, and there is no
surplus for export. Therefore, every pound of Australian
leaf that takes the place of imported leaf should be worth
to the manufacturer the price paid for imported leaf. In
recent years the average price paid for Australian leaf has
been approximately 2s. per lb. Under the old duties no leaf
could be imported under 3s. per lb., while much of the leaf
imported cost considerably more than 35., including the duty
of 2s. per lb. During the season just past, the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company has, owing to the import duty
being raised by Bd. per lb. by the Bruce Government, raised
the bonus on the two top grades of Australian leaf a further
(id. per lb., which action should have a beneficial effect i t
inducing the growth of larger quantities of the bright grades,
but as the proportion of bright leaf grown is only approxi-
mately 30 per cent., the balance of the increased duty goes
into the coffers of the company. The present Government has
raised the import duty a further 4d. per lb., making the duty
3a., as against 2a. twelve months ago, which, if passed on to the
grower in fair proportion, will go far towards encouraging
growers to produce the types required.
250. What do you mean by the expression “ in fair
proportion”?— If the import duty has been raised Is.
the growers should receive their fair proportion of that
sum for their product. 1 admit that American leaf,
when imported here, arrives in better condition for
handling. It is aged, and there is less cost to the
manufacturer. The Australian leaf contains a larger
percentage of .moisture, and requires a certain amount
of regrading and re-handling. If that process is worth
25 per cent, of that shilling the growers should
receive 9d.
251. By Mr. Bentley. — Your argument is that for
the bright Australian leaf we should pay as much as
the cost of American leaf plus duty ?—I understand
you arc anxious to encourage bright leaf, and as your
company is the only buyer you should do something
towards its encouragement.
252. Hy the Chairman. —1 assume you do not dispute
tiie wisdom of the policy of the company in insisting on
the increased production of bright leaf?— Not at all.
253. You are not arguing for the encouragement of
dark leaf?— No.
254. Is the company paving what yon consider a
fair price, in view of the capital invested by the growers
and their difficulties in regard to adequate prices?—
The 6d. of the Bd. per lb. was passed on hy the company,
in the form of a bonus, on the two top grades of leaf
only, which amounted to about 30 per cent, of the whole
mop. Therefore, nearly 70 per cent, was not affected.
So that added Sd. was of greater value to the manufac-
turer than to the grower.
255. Will you proceed with your next statement? —
It is as follows
ASSISTING AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO INDUSTRY.
In my opinion, the best way for Parliament to help the
tobacco-growing industry is to reduce or abolish the excise
on tobacco made from Australian tobacco leaf, and to increase
the import duties on leaf entering Australia. By apportion-
ing the excise, and import duties, the revenue could be
maintained, or increased, as desired, while the cost to the
smoker need not he unduly raised. For instance, for every
1,000,000 lb. of Australian leaf used there is 15,000,000 lb.
of imported leaf manufactured. If the excise on Australian
leaf was abolished (viz., 28d.), and the import duty increased
by 2d. per lb., the revenue would he balanced. Failing a
reduction in the excise, a further increase in the import duty
would benefit the local growing industry. The present excise
duty prevents any intending manufacturer competing with
the present monopoly, but the abolition of the excise would
admit of locai manufacturers operating with Australian leaf,
and also make it more desirable to present manufacturers,
'•'his lias been the experience in other countries.
A substantial reduction in the excise on Australian leaf
should permit of a cheap manufactured tobacco being placed
on the market. The introduction of competition for local-
grown leaf would lead to better prices for good leaf, and
lower prices for poor leaf, and so induce growers to produce
belter tobacco. Under recent conditions it did not matter
to tiie one buyer what he paid for Australian leaf so long as
he bought the leaf at an all-round price of 2s. or under.
This led to much discontent as to prices received. Every
penny excise tax on local leaf is a handicap on the industry.
The recent import and excise duties have protected the
monopoly from competition, which is not desirable. During
the past season 700 bales of leaf were left on the hands of
growers, and though it may he conceded that some of this
leaf is not useable, open competition would have shown
growers which leaf was saleable and which not saleable.
Tobacco leaf is imported to a value in some years of £3,000,000,
and it is believed that Australia could produce two-thirds of
this amount. This money goes chiefly to the United States
of America, a country that docs not reciprocate in taking
goods from Australia to as great an extent as her sales
amount to. It is said that a large proportion of the net
£1,000,000 profit made by the monopoly goes out each year to
foreign shareholders.
A marketing board is required to place a fair value on
tobacco leaf for sale in Australia, where a monopoly exists.
Such a board might consist of a representative of the buyers,
the growers, and one independent person appointed by the
Government, to fix the prices, taking into consideration the
value of the leaf to growers and manufacturers. Up to the


present the average price paid for Australian leaf is 2s. per
lb., which is at least Is. per lb. below Australian parity on
an average. For instance, no leaf is imported under 3s. per
lb., including 2s. duty, while much of the imported leaf costs
more than 3s. to import. Why should the manufacturer get
this Is. per lb. advantage ?
I would point out that the Tariff Board in 1927, after
taking evidence from growers and manufacturers, recom-
mended as the best way to assist the local-growing industry,
a reduction of Gd. per lb. on Australian leaf paying excise.
This recommendation was not adopted. In my opinion a
marginal difference in the duties on tobacco should be at
least 4s. per lb., to enable new manufacturers to compete with
the monopoly, which latter is sufficiently powerful to under-
sell tobacco for a period, which might stamp out small com-
petitors before an Australian tobacco rvas established on the
market. The import duties on tobacco leaf in England are
Bs. 2d. per lb., and I believe there is no excise duty. In the
United States of America the import duty on Sumatra leaf
is 7s. per lb.
Growers argue that the bonus system is wrong in principle,
and unfair in practice, as for example—Take leaf worth
2s. Gd. per lb. made up of leaf at 2s. and 6d. bonus, whereas
leaf worth 2s. sd. per lb., the buyers need only pay Is. lid.
and 3d. bonus, total 2s. 2d. Moreover, the bonus creates a
wrong impression in the eyes of the public, because the
present price paid, plus the bonus, does not equal Australian
parity. The so-called bonus is really a part of the value
of the leaf to the buyer. The differentiation in values caused
by this method leads to much dissatisfaction amongst
growers. The bonus system also savours of charity, which is
objectionable.
256. By Mr. Jones. —-Do you contend that a reduc-
tion of excise on Australian-grown leaf of the better
grades as recommended by the Tariff Board would do
more to stimulate the industry than the bonus at
present being voluntarily paid by the company ?—ln
my opinion, the abolition of the excise duty would do
more to stimulate the growth of tobacco on right lines
than the bonus per lb. given on tobacco.
257. Was this bonus paid by the company prior to
the investigation by the Tariff Board?— Hot at the
recent rates, but there has been a bonus ever since the
guarantee has been in force.
258. Have you had complaints from growers in Vic-
toria that they have been paid less than the value of
the leaf, and, therefore, have not received the bonus?—
Yes. Here is a letter I have received from a grower
at Tam worth, in Hew South Wales: —
I am writing to see if you could kelp me as well as others
in this district in the matter of selling our tobacco leaf.
The British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s buyer is only
buying the very best of the leaf this year, that is lemon-
coloured and No. 1 bright, and in most cases paying a poor
price. Any other grade lie seems to leave on the growers’
hands. He offered me 2s. I id. for lemon-coloured, and Is. Bd.
for No. 1 bright. This is Gd. a lb. below the price of other
years, and the next grade, which is really good leaf, he did
not want at all. The result is that there is a lot of good
tobacco not bought in this district. However, I did not
accept the price, and still have the tobacco. But there is
not a great quantity. There is about 1 ton in all —about
250 lb. of lemon-coloured, about 640 lb. of No. 1 bright, and
about 800 lb. of the next grade and two other lesser grades,
I saw by the Tamworth newspaper that you sold tobacco
leaf to a Western Australian firm at satisfactory prices. 1
would be very thankful to you if you would let me know
if there is any buyer you know' of wTio might visit this
district, or to whom we could send samples, as there is a lot
of good grade leaf to be bought here. I would get an
estimate of the quantity and let you know' if there w r as any
likely buyer. Mr. Lough, the buyer, admitted that ray leaf
was w'dl got up and properly cured.
Here is a letter sent to me from Queensland, dated 19th
September, 1929:
I would esteem it a favour if you wrauld let me have two
or three copies of article on production of tobacco leaf,
curing, &c., I require them for several of our growers in the
Texas district. You will remember meeting me at Gunyan
when you were down there with Mr. Tregenna. I have
followed with interest your good work in the tobacco in-
dustry, and I hope now 7 that a select committee has been
appointed you will won out. We flue-cured some very good
leaf this year, but w r e do not think, taking the price all
through, that we got a very fair deal. Mr. Rogerson grew
a fair amount of tobacco in the Texas district last season.
It w'as sun-dried, and he sold it to a firm in Melbourne
and got Is., Is. sd. to Is. per lb. Wills’ best price for
same class of leaf was Is. Id. I cannot understand this.
A further letter from Victoria states:—
Dear Sir, —The buyers were here yesterday, they did not
buy any of our tobacco. I want you to come up and see what
you think of it. It is as good, if not better, than when 1
topped the market with it. I have never had anything
better. Every one that saw it thought it quite impossible
to fault, but there it is. What am I do about it? If you
had a look at it you could advise me. I am sending some
of the leaf on to Mr. Jones. Having had a bad spin for
several years in succession, we are right up against it. We
do not know where tne next month’s food is coming from.
That is the position tobacco-growing has got us into, and
there is no work to be had. Our plants are more forward
this year than usual, but one hardly knows whether to put
them out or not. It is not very encouraging as you know
there is a big family of us, and you know what a struggle it
is. They were not anxious to buy. They only opened two
bales out of nineteen. We had to open some of the others
and almost force them to look at them. If you can strain
a point to come along you will help us greatly.
That position would be obviated if there were more
buyers.
259. Have the growers any voice in fixing the price ?
—Hone whatever.
260. The company alone fixes it ?—As a rule.
261. And the prices regulate the bonus ?—Certainly.
262. Do you favour a valuation board?— Yes. There
will never be satisfaction amongst the growers under
the present system, whether they are fairly or unfairly
treated.
263. Do you say the present conditions are not con-
ducive to the best interests of the industry?—l do.
264. By the Chairman. —Tour remedy is competition
amongst die buyers ?—That is so.
265. The only way you think that could be brought
about is by the total abolition of the excise duty ?—I
see no reason why that should not be done. The collec-
tion of the excise duty is an expensive process. The
loss in revenue could be easily counterbalanced by
an increase in the import duty, and even then the
duty would not be anything like the English import
duty of Bs. 2d. a lb. When the industry was well
established it could probably stand an internal duty for
revenue purposes.
266. By Mr. Jones. —lf the excise duty were removed
it would be an incentive to the manufacturers to buy
more Australian leaf, and the price to the public would
not necessarily be raised?—lt would certainly be an
incentive to buy Australian leaf.
267. It would be possible to stimulate the industry
without the consumers having to pay more for their
smokes?— Yes, if the import duty were raised about
2d. to balance the loss of the excise.
268. By Mr. Bentley. —The present position is that
100 per cent. Australian brands are retailed at ss. 2d.
a lb. as against dark Havelock at Bs. lid. a lb., and
even then the public will not buy the Australian brands ?
—I do not understand the secrets of Australian manu-
facture, but I consider that Australian tobacco makes
a good smoke. I have had cigarettes made up entirely
of Australian leaf, and they are generally approved
of. Surely if I could sell them the company should be
able to do better.
269. The growers throughout Australia are producing
only enough bright leaf to enable us to put about 2%
per cent. in. Every lb. of bright leaf produced is used?
—With the prices now being paid we are likely to
get a much larger proportion of the bright leaf. I
blame the British-Australasian Tobacco Company very
largely for the quantity of dark leaf produced, as com-
pared with the bright leaf. The prices paid for the
dark leaf have encouraged the growers to produce it,
as it w r as a better paying proposition. The dark leaf
gives about twice the yield per acre. In one case a
grower obtained £250 per acre for dark tobacco, whereas
for bright leaf the return was less than £lOO. When
the company guaranteed to take 600,000 lb. per year
of the lower grade dark tobacco at a certain price it
was an inducement to the growers to produce it.


270. By Mr. Slagg. —You mentioned an import duty
in America of 7s. a lb. That applies only to cigar
wrappers, which form only a small percentge, of the
total imports. Tor the cigarette and smoking tobaccoes
the import duty is about Is. 6d. a lb., and in Canada
it is about Is. Bd.?—l merely mentioned those figures
to show that other countries had higher duties than
Australia, and that in America it is considered neces-
sary to impose an import duty.
271. By the Chairman. —lf the excise duty is abol-
ished and the company is forced to buy a large amount
of Australian leaf and competitors come into the field,
we shall have a tobacco that the Australian people
will not buy ?— I That will be rather extraordinary. The
tobacconist from whom I purchased the “ 888 ” to-
bacco, a sample of which I submitted yesterday, told
me he was selling a lot of it. I asked him if sales had
increased since the duty had been raised, and he told
me he was selling more of it than of the Havelock
brand. The all-Australian tobacco certainly suits the
taste of one section of the public.
272. By Mr. Jones. —Is the average grower a fair
judge of the value of the leaf he produces?— Hot all.
Personally, I think the manufacturers have a better
knowledge of the value than the grower, but a grower
who has had a number of years experience should be
able to gauge the value of his leaf one year with an-
other.
273. Have you seen leaf on which you think a greater
value should have been fixed than the sum actually
paid?— Yes. One of the troubles to-day is that one
grower thinks he gets a lower price than his neighbour,
although he imagines he has a better grade of tobacco.
If a grower had leaf which was worth 2s. a lb. it would
automatically carry the 6d. per lb. bonus.
274. What is the average production of a small
grower?— About tons.
275. Do you strongly advocate a valuation board? —
Yes. If we had half a dozen manufacturers competing
for the leaf the prices would regulate themselves, but
to-day the farmer is liable to think that the monopoly
should buy all leaf.
276. Under present conditions what alternative has
the grower if he refuses to take the prices offered by
the company?—He does not know what to do. It is
true that a buyer from another State is buying up leaf
rejected by the company. Only the day before yester-
day a man told me he had tobacco left on his hands.
Under the present system of marketing the grower does
not know whether to plant out crops or not.
277. By the Chairman. —You referred to the case of
Chaffey Brothers. Why did you pick out that par-
ticular instance £ —That case struck me very forcibly
as inconsistent with the statements made by the com-
pany. Just prior to that purchase the company made
a complaint about the aroma of Australian tobacco,
its inferior quality, bad treatment, and production on
wrong soils. Yet immediately afterwards this purchase
was made. The tobacco must have been coarse, rank,
and heavy-ribbed, because, it went to Id tons to
the acre. It was grown on particularly rich, black
land, and perhaps one of the last types of soil one
would choose for the production of a tobacco crop.
278. You regard that as a marked inconsistency on
the part of the company in regard to encouraging
the growth of bright leaf ?-—Yes. Results such as that
would have a wonderful influence in inducing others
with similar land to have a go at the industry.
279. Is that one of the most undesirable features of
the industry in Australia?— Yes.
280. Some time ago it was stated in Victoria that
a certain grower received a cheque for £7,000, Do
»ou regard these isolated instances as being of any value
to the industry?— They induce men to make inquiries
about the industry, but, when these large amounts arc
obtained for a type of tobacco that it is not desirable
to grow under present market conditions, the result
is detrimental rather than beneficial.
281. What is your next statement ? —lt deals with the
investigation into the industry and reads as follows:
INVESTIGATION OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY.
Tobacco-grower s were not consulted as to whether they
desired an investigation into their industry, or as to their
representatives on the survey party, or committees, dealing
with the investigation, and it was only through the influence
of the Minister of Agriculture for Victoria (Mr. Slater) that
they were able to get a representative on the survey party.
Though requests have been made by growers that the survey
party report be made available to them, this privilege has
been denied, with the consequence that they have been left
in the dark as to the position they were in as to their future
plans.
Up to the present they have no information as to where
they can safely continue their efforts to grow tobacco, or
definite information as to the result of experiments carried
out in various parts of Australia; or as to whether the large
sums of money being spent on this work is being devoted
to best advantage; or as to the results of experts’ opinions
of samples of leaf sent away to England, and whether the
samples of leaf were selected for quality and age to make
the test a reliable one.
282. It was against your wish that the report, of the
survey party was withheld from the growers?— Ce-
rtainly. Personally, I did not agree with Dr. liivett.
It was merely a survey of the conditions that existed
then, and the opinions of the members of the board.
The withholding of that report left the growers in the
dark as to their prospects, and they have been wonder-
ing whether to abandon the industry.
283. By Mr. Morgan.— Can you say what parts of
the report Dr. Rivett thought would be prejudicial to
the interests of growers?— No.
284. By the Chairman. —Do you think the growers
have been seriously concerned about its non-publication ?
—Yes. They have made several requests for its publi-
cation. So far as I know 7 it is simply a report on the
information gleaned from the growers as a whole, and
in each State.

tralasian Tobacco Company. Pty. Ltd., Melbourne,

285. By the Char man. —Will you read the statement
that I understand you have prepared ?—-This statement
was drawn up before I came here yesterday morning.
Since then I have heard some of the evidence, but I
thought it desirable to present the original statement.
It is as follows :
My company welcomes this opportunity of giving evidence
before this committee and sincerely hopes that the inquiry
may result in benefiting the tobacco-growing industry in
Australia.
In the first place, I want to say that the policy of my
company has always been to encourage the growing" of Aus-
tralian leaf along proper and scientific lines. Statements
have been made from time to time that my company is
interested in tobacco-growing in other parts of the world,
and therefore, does not wish the industry in Australia to be
successfully established. Neither The British-Australasian
'Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited nor any of the asso-
ciated companies have ever had any interest in tobacco-
growing except in Australia.
In our opinion, the following are the main reasons why
the tobacco industry in Australia has not in the past suc-
ceeded:—
1. The difficulty of procuring suitable soil and climate
for tobacco culture.
2. The prevalence of the blue mould disease which is
peculiar to Australia.
3. The difficulty of producing tobacco of a light colour,
for which there is now a great popular demand.
4. The difficulty of producing tobacco without an un
pleasant burning aroma.


It was with a view* to finding a remedy for these diffi-
culties that the Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee
formed, and we submit that a solution of these diffi-
culties can only be found by a series of experiments under
the supervision of experts who have knowledge of the grow-
ing of tobacco.
My company, recognizing the value which it would be, not
only to my company, but also to Australia, if tobacco equal to
the tobacco which avc import from America could be produced
in Australia, expended large sums of money and a great
deal of time in its endeavour to bring about this desirable
state of things.
My company, therefore, Aery much resents the statement
that it is insincere in its efforts to assist the industry to
flourish, and asserts without fear of contradiction that there
is not one atom of evidence to support this statement.
In A T ieAv of the fact that misleading statements have been
made from time to time m regard to the industry, and doubts
have been raised in regard to the sincerity of this company
toAvards the industry, I AA r ould like to mention some of the
material facts relating to its history over the past thirty (30)
years and to refer more particularly to the steps Avhich my
company has taken to encourage the industry and improve
the quality of the leaf.
About the year 1895 manufacturers found that they could
not establish a successful business by manufacturing solely
or mainly from Australian-grown leaf, and several businesses
actually failed which tried to do so. The public would not
take the product and the bulk of the trade was done in im-
ported manufactured brands. This is borne out by the fact
that of the total quantity of tobacco consumed in Australia
in 1896 no less than 60 per cent. AA r as imported manufactured
tobacco. To meet the position, the use of imported leaf
became essential to any manufacturer Avho hoped for suc-
cess, and it is only because of the use by manufacturers of
American leaf that the competition Avith the imported article
was met, and that there is any tobacco manufacturing in-
dustry of any magnitude in existence in Australia to-day.
As a result of this policy practically the whole of the im-
ported manufactured tobacco trade was captured by the
Australian factories Avhich would have been impossible had
only Australian-groAvn leaf been used.
My company and its predecessors have at different times
by means of experimental farms and in various ways in con-
nexion Avitli tlie cultivation of tobacco in Australia spent
not less than £75,000. .As one instance of this, I should
like to mention that my company purchased land near Texas
on the border of New South Wales and Queensland for the
purpose of an experimental farm. We erected flue-curing
barns and employed only white labour. We built cottages
for the men and spared no expense to try and institute a
white colony, but we did not make a success of it. We kept
the farm going for five years from 1910 to 1915, under the
supervision of our own experts, but as we could not get an
improved article Ave closed doAvn the farm and sold it and
lost £20,000 on that experiment alone.
About the year 1919 the company found that sun- and
air-dried leaf was proving increasingly unusable and realized
that if the tobacco-groAving industry in Australia Avas to
become permanent, the leaf would have to be flue-cured.
It had become abundantly clear that an improA T ement in the
burning aroma of Australian leaf AA r as essential, and further-
more there had been a distinct change in the public taste
and the demand was—and still is—for bright aromatic to-
bacco. The flue-curing process not only produces a lighter
leaf, tuit it also helps to neutralize the unpleasant smoking
characteristics in Australian leaf to Avhich the consumer takes
exception.
In the month of January, 1923, Mr. C. M. Chaffey, Avho
was president of the Tamworth District Tobacco GroAvers
Association, felt uneasy in vieAv of the extensive planting of
tobacco in tlie Tamworth district having regard to what the
company had stated, namely, that sun- and air-dried leaf
Avas proving unusable and that the prospects of disposing
of future supplies was decreasing instead of increasing. This
statement had been made by our buyer individually to groAvers
continuously for the five previous years, and Mr. Chaffey,
who was aAvare of this, thought that it would be in the best
interests of the industry that the statement should be made to
tobacco groAvers colledWely. He accordingly asked our buyer
to address members of tlie association at TamAvorth. Our
buyer accordingly addressed a meeting of the association,
when more than 100 persons Avere present, and in the course
of his address, emphasized the necessity of improving the
leaf by the process of flue-curing.
In order that the position should be understood, I should
explain that a very large proportion of the tobacco leaf
groAvn in Australia was at that time—and a substantial pro-
portion still is—groAvn by Chinamen on the share system.
The natural inclination of the Chinamen is to raise as large
a crop as possible without regard to the quality, and his
conservatism stands in the way of the adoption of any new
scheme for improvement, such as flue-euring.
F. 218. —7
The position was fully explained to the growers, and thejf
were warned against producing large crops of sun and
air-dried tobacco. The action of the company at this time—
Winch it has since been realized \vas entirely in the interests
of tiio industry was misunderstood and the company was
accused of trying to ruin the industry. As a direct result
ol the company’s attitude, however, the majority of growers
have been persuaded to adopt this most desirable, and in
America, almost universal method of treatment.
] 'Vith a view to helping growers to change over from the
old method of and air-drying to flue-curing, advances
amounting to £7,002 have been made from time to time by the
company without security to assist them to erect flue-curing
earns. Tlie usual basis was to limit the advance to the
sum of £lOO for each barn to be erected, but not exceeding
a lotai advance of £2OO to any one grower. The money was
lent tree of interest until the existing crop was harvested,
and if the value of half the crop was less than the sum
advanced the amount of the deficiency was allowed to run
on until the folloAving year and such balance bore interest
at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum. Plans of Hue-curing
barns are issued free, together with pamphlets on the art of
curing tobacco.
in September, 1923, the company notified the Tariff Board
that it had made an offer to the New South Wales Govern-
ment to defray the expenses of a field laboratory to enable
tlie government biologist to conduct further experiments in
the search for the cause of the blue mould trouble.
In tiie year 1925, Avith a aucav to improving the quality
of the leaf, my company engaged Mr. McGee, an American
expert in tobacco-growing, at a salary with a bonus approxi-
mating £l,OOO per annum for a period of three years, with
a view' to his studying the method of growing and cultivating
tooacco in use in Australia Avith special attention to the
latisc flue-curing methods and to carry out and assist the
growers to carry out experiments with view to improving
tlie quality of the leaf. The full-time seiwices of three of our
own experts wore placed at Mr. McGee’s disposal, and the
total cost of these experiments over the three years amounted
to £9,075.
In order to try and determine whether or not the peculiar
aroma characteristic of Australian-grown tobacco was due
to properties in the soil or in the air, we arranged for the
Importation of 10 tons of American soil; the experiments
in this connexion Avere carried out by Mr. McGee under the
control of the Commomvealth Tobacco Investigation Com-
mittee.
For many years past, our own experts have spent a large
portion of their time amongst growers endeavouring to assist
them to improve the quality of their tobacco. This work
is all done free of cost to the growers.
In the year 1926 the company offered to enter into a
definite arrangement Avith the Federal Government to spend
£ for £ up to the total of £50,000 in developing any district
in Australia Avhich could satisfactorily demonstrate that it
could groAv tobacco equal in quality to tobacco grown in
America and used by the company for manufacture.
As a result of negotiations with the Development and
Migration Commission and the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, the company exceeded the terms of its
first offer and agreed that over a period of three years it
would find £20,000 rateably Avith the sum of £lO,OOO to be
found by the Commonwealth or State governments for the
purpose of carrying out im’estigations and field experiments.
Up to date, £15,000 of this sum has already been paid by
the company on account of the £20,000, leaving a balance
due of £5,000.
if, at the expiration of the three-year period, develop-
ments are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further effort,
and additional expenditure is considered necessary and desir-
able, the company will provide a further £30,000 conditionally
upon the Commonwealtlx and/or State governments providing
a similar amount.
In this connexion I Avant to make it quite clear that my
company is neither represented on the committee nor does
it in any Avay directly or indirectly control its policy or the
manner in which the experiments or operations of the com-
mittee are carried out.
My company fully recognizes the difficult position which it
has been placed in owing to its being the chief buyer of leaf,
and it has honestly done its best to stand up to its responsi-
bilities. 8o far from taking advantage of its position in this
respect, my company has gone further than could have been
reasonably expected of it, and as a result has been put in
the position of having leaf on its hands which it has been
unable to use.
With a view to encouraging growers to improve the quality
by giving them a definite and assured market for their pro-
ducts, and thereby ultimately putting the industry on a
sound basis, the company has from time to time made various


offers of purchase at prices which admittedly are highly re-
munerative to the growers. I now submit a statement setting
out particulars of such offers: —

For the years 1930 and 1931, it is distinctly understood
that, as regards the No. 1 dark, the purchases will not exceed
10 per cent, of the total crop purchased.
Prices referred to in the abovementioned offers do not
include bonuses which have been given from time to time
to growers by the company, ranging from 3d. to Is. per lb.
Coming now r to more recent events, statements involving
in some cases very serious implications, have been made
regarding my company’s actions towards the leaf-growing
industry. We take the view that it is highly desirable that
these apparent misunderstandings should be cleared up, and
I therefore now propose to deal with these matters.
It has been stated that my company has been responsible
for educating the consumer to smoke American leaf. This
is not true. As I previously explained, 60 per cent, of the
tobacco consumed in Australia in the year 1895 was imported
into Australia in manufactured form, consequently it is
apparent that the Australian consumer had already shown
his preference for American-grown leaf prior to the year 1895.
To compete with the imported trade, my company had to raise
its standard, and in order to do this it had to greatly extend
its use of American leaf, and it was only by this means that
the Australian manufacturers were able to compete and even-
tually to capture the Australian trade for Australia.
As a result a great manufacturing industry in Australia has
been built up, an industry in which 5,300 employees are
employed, and which pays in wages and benefits over £1,200,000
a year. This trade can only be held by the continued use
of imported leaf until such time as the Australian leaf is
sufficiently improved in good smoking quality as to be accept-
able to the Australian smoker.
It has also been stated that the additional bonuses on lemon
and bright mahogany leaf of 3d. per lb. paid as from the
year 1927 and Gd. per lb. paid in 1929 were fictitious in that
the company compensated itself by a corresponding reduction
in prices. I give this statement an emphatic denial. At no
time have our buyers been instructed to adopt such a repre-
hensible practice, nor have they done so.
1 submit a statement wherein is set out the total purchases
by my company of lemon and bright mahogany leaf, and the
average prices paid for the years 1926 to 1929, both inclusive,
and which amply disproves the charge made against my com-
pany and to which I have just referred. I would direct special
attention to the fact that in 1927 and 1929 the percentage
of lemon and bright mahogany leaf bought at the higher
prices was greater in each case than the purchases of the
corresponding grade in the previous year.
Further, it will be noted that the percentage of lemon and
bright mahogany leaf purchased, increased from 12.67 per
cent, in 192 C, to 19.92 per cent, in 1929, and that the average
price of lemon and bright mahogany leaf increased from
2s. 3.95 d. in 1926 to 3s. 0.93 d. in 1929, the latter increase
being 9d., and which represents the extra bonus of 3d. given
in 1927, and the additional bonus of Gd. given in 1929. I
particularly mention these points, because it has not only
been asserted that the company has not paid the bonus, but
also that, in order to circumvent the bonus, it lowered the
grade of the leaf. The company’s purchases of lemon and
bright mahogany leaf for the years 1926 to 1929 were as
follow:

I may say that, in support of the above figures, we have on
file at our offices a copy of every agreement, account sales and
receipt covering our purchases from each individual grower
for the past four years referred to, and these documents can,
if required, be readily produced.
Furthermore, I wish to state that, as regards all figures
quoted by me in this statement and the six supporting state-
ments, my company is perfectly agreeable that these figures
should be audited by the company’s auditors—Messrs. Yarwood,
Vane and Company, in Sydney, and Messrs. 'Wilson, Danby
and Giddy, in Melbourne—and certificates supplied by them to
the* committee if so desired.
We contend that the prices which we have paid for several
years past are from 100 per cent, to 200 per cent, more than
the prices which the tobacco would fetch on the world’s
markets. In this connexion, I would quote the following
extract from the Report of the Imperial Economic Committee
on Tobacco: —
“The United States Department of Agriculture reports
that American farms received an average of 17 cents.
(B|d.) a lb. for their crop in 1925, and an average
of 18J cents. (lOd.) a lb. in 1926, and yet, apparently,
grew it at a profit.” (Section XXll.—Leaf Prices.)
Before departing from the question of prices, there is one
aspect, not generally understood, which should, perhaps, be
cleared up. I refer to the prices paid by us for Australian
leaf as compared with American leaf, plus the duty.
In the first place, it must be remembered that composite
and all-Australian tobaccoes are sold very much cheaper to
the public than those brands containing substantially all-
American leaf. Our list price of “ Havelock ” dark plug is
Bs. lid. per lb., “Lucky Hit” (a composite brand) dark plug
7s. Gd. per lb., and “Starlight” (an all-Australian brand)
dark plug ss. 2d. per lb. In the tobaccoes mentioned, the
Australian leaf used is either dark or No. 2, and obviously
the smoker and not the company gets the advantage as regards
any cheaper price than American duty-paid leaf that might
be paid for dark or No. 2 Australian leaf. To carry the
illustration further, I might mention that, when the recent
additional Is. duty was imposed on imported leaf, we only
increased “ Havelock ” dark by 9d., “ Lucky Hit ” by 6d., and

Strips.
The leaf has now to be converted into strips
—i.e., the mid-riba have to be removed by
the process known as stemming. The
stems are useless and the remainder of the
leaf—known as strips—has, of necessity,
to bear the cost of the whole. The Aus-
tralian leaf on the whole has a larger and
heavier stem than the American, the
average yields of bright strips being, as
under:—
American—80.55 per cent.
Australian — 77.42 per cent.
The average cost of 1 lb. strips is, therefore

I submit the following statement from which it will be seen

of our of Australian leaf, as on the 31st December,

A conference was held on 22nd January, 1929, with the
Minister for Agriculture and the State Tobacco Expert for
Victoria, when it was explained to them that on account of
the decreasing demand for dark and cheap manufactured

The company has been criticized for the attitude it has
adopted in regard to the production of dark and No. 2 leaf.
In order that the committee may understand the position I
should explain that no dark and inferior leaf can be used in
our bright tobaccoes. They can only be used in the dark
and cheaper tobaccoes.
I may say that the the position created by the over-
production of dark and inferior leaf is all the time becoming
Total, all grades
The increase in the stocks held of dark and No. 2 leaf
is due to two reasons, viz.:—
accentuated by the decline in the trade for dark and cheap
(а) the decrease in the consumption of dark and
cheap 100 t ( coes ;
(б) the failure of the growers to produce in 1928
anything like a reasonable proportion of bright
leaf.

It IS contended by Mr. Temple Smith that the company
is responsible for the increased production of dark leaf
for the reason that on the prices paid for bright and’
dark leaf respectively it paid the growers better to grow
the dark variety. In this connexion it may be said that
the company had adopted the following measures to dis-
courage the production of dark leaf, viz,:—

(2) By decreasing the quantities of dark and No. 2
leaf when renewing the triennial agreements
with the Department of Agriculture.
(3) By 'withdraw,!!-; the bonus of 3d. per lb. on
dark leaf and increasing the bonus on bright
leaf from 3d. to 6d., thus increasing the
difference between bright and dark leaf by a
further 6d. per lb.
Mr. Temple Smith’s solution of the difficulty is to
further suesease tue price of the bright grades, and he
claims the company can well afford to do this in view
of the 2s. protection given by the tariff. The figures he
is reported as quoting in this connexion are misleading,
and, furthermore, he makes no mention of the differences
in the list pv.ces of the various tobaccoes manufactured
by the company, the following of which are examples,

In June, 1926, the Tariff Board conducted a public
inquiry into the tobacco leaf-growing industry in Aus-
tralia, and a copy of their report and recommendation
is submitted. attention is directed to the follow-
ing extracts from this report as being specially relevant
to the particular aspects under review, viz.:—
Page 18 —
“ The price paid by the company would probably
have encouraged the growing of the coarser leaf to
a greater extent had not the payment of such price
been hedged around by conditions designed to dis-
courage the production of such leaf.”
“ The board has no hesitation in expressing the
opinion that in the prices it has paid to growers the
company has been actuated at all times by a desire
to improve the quality of leaf. The evidence given
not only by the company’s representatives but also
by growers indicate that the company has con-
sistently opposed the cultivation of inferior leaf and
has spared no effort in its endeavours to raise the
standard of leaf.”
“ The Tariff Board is quite satisfied that the price
paid by the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany Proprietary Limited for Australian leaf
is from 100 per cent. to 200 per cent,
above world parity, and this being so, the
local industry of tobacco-growing is really receiv-
ing a subsidy already from sources other than
the Federal or State Governments. If the growers
were dependent upon the world’s prices for their leaf,
growing in Australia, except at an enormous loss,
would be quite impossible.”
Page 19—
“ After hearing the evidence tendered by the
growers and their representatives on the one hand
and the representative of the manufacturers
on the other hand, the Tariff Board is
unable to accept the statements made ‘that
the present position has been brought about
by a lack of desire on the part of the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited to
use Australian leaf, or to a failure on the part of the
company to place on the market a tobacco manu-
factured wholly from or containing a greater pro-
portion of Australian leaf. These statements the
board regards in the light of the evidence as totally
unjustifiable.”
It was pointed out that any drastic steps in this direction
for the 1929 season would create hardship amongst the growers
who had already completed their planting. Notwithstanding
that my company had given every reasonable warning to
growers, my company, as a result of negotiations, agreed that
it would buy 420,000 lb. of dark and No. 2 leaf from the 1929
crop, but that its purchases should be restricted to a maximum
of 250,000 lb. for 1930 and 150,000 lb. for 1931. As a matter
of interest it may be mentioned that in 1929 my company
actually purchased in Victoria 501,927 lb. of dark and
No. 2 leaf; i.e., 81,927 lb. in excess of its undertaking.
Quite apart from the economic position created by the
continued o\ er-production of nfeiior dark and No. 2 tob.-v-cnes
the company has no hesitation in stating that it is in the
best interests of the industry that these types of leaf should
be rigidly restricted. The unpleasant characteristics are
intensified in those tobaccoes and they damage the prestige
of Australian leaf.
the company has either destroyed or sold for fertilizer
purposes during the last six and a half years, no less than
821,057 lb. of inferior Australian leaf at a cost of £36,136,
luch leaf being entirely unfit for manufacture.
On the question of inferior leaf, the following comment
from the report of the Imperial Economic Committee on
tobacco is interesting:—
“ The desirability of -preventing tobaccoes which do not
reach a certain minimum specification from reaching the
market, is worth the grave consideration of producers’
organizations and, possibly, of some of the Governments
concerned.”— (Section XXI. —Grading.)
A further reason that has been advanced as to why the
industry is not progressing is that any extension would involve
the manufacturers in a considerable outlay on plant, and that
they are not prepared to find the necessary money. So far
as my company is concerned, this is absolutely contrary to the
facts.
In the year 1926 the company completed the erection in
Melbourne of a large factory of five floors and a basement
costing £78,000. The top floor of this building was specially
constructed to take care of the handling and storage of
Australian tobacco leaf, and the most modern machinery
installed at a cost of £6,400. A similar plant has been erected
at our Sydney factory, and all requirements in this regard
have been met for a considerable expansion in the industry.
Every possible care and attention, irrespective of cost, is
given to the redrying, boxing and storage of Australian leaf,
and in these respects we can claim to be well abreast of the
methods adopted in other parts of the world.
V\ e hope the members of the committee will visit and
inspect for themselves our plants, both in Sydney and Mel-
bourne.
One big difficulty that confronts the industry is blue
mould. Phis disease has of recent years been much
more pronounced, and the absence of any remedy or pre-
ventative against it lias kept many growers from continuing to
plant tobacco, and prevented others from taking it up. It is
viral that blue mould should be overcome if the industry is
to be successful, as continuity of supply of established quality
is essential.
Every effort has been made by my company to popularize
Australian leaf, but the public has not responded, notwith-
standing that they can purchase very much more tobacco
maufactured from Australian-grown leaf for the sartie price
tney would have to pay for tobacco manufactured from
imported leaf.
A statement already submitted shows our sales of com-
uosifco and all-Australian brands of tobacco. In addition
to the information appearing thereon, I will now supply par-
ticulars regarding the sales of two brands of tobaccoes
which have in recent years been introduced by us to the
public with a view to increasing our usings of Australian
leaf.
" Waratah” is an all-Australian brand manufactured from
|' u '. brst quality bright Australian flue-cured leaf, and
'• Signet ” is a composite brand containing 50 per cent, of
American leaf. “ Waratah ” is supplied in 2-oz. packets and
2-oz. hermetically sealed tins, the retail price of which at the
■present time is Is. 3d. for the packets, and Is. 4d. for the
tins, as against Is. 6|d. to Is. 7|d. respectively, for similar
packings in “ Champion and “ Havelock"” tobaccoes.
“ Waratah ” was well advertised upon its introduction.
The sales for the past six years of these two brands arc as
follows: —■
“ Waratah.” “ Signet.”
" Signet ” up to the year 1927 was sold only in plug form,
but in January of that year as a direct result of a sug-
gestion made at the Tariff Board Inquiry, this brand was
put iip in cut form, containing 50 per cent, of the first
quality bright Australian flue-cured leaf, and 50 per cent,
of American leaf, and is supplied in 2-oz. tins, the retail
price for which at the present time is Is. 4|d.
The sales of “ Signet ” cut tobacco for the three years
llmt it has been on the market are as follows:
1927 .. .. .. 27,139 lb.
1928 .. .. .. 14,616
1929 .. .. .. 13.217 ..
.Signet ” cut tobacco was also well advertised on its intro-
duction, and was put out in a first-class packing, but as is
shown by the above figures, it was not taken up by the public.
It was thus again demonstrated that smokers will not buy
a brand containing so much Australian leaf, oven with a
great inducement in price.
The explanation of the smoker’s attitude is simply that
he does not like the unpleasant characteristics of the Aus-
tralian-grown leaf. It has been truly said that the object
of tobacco smoking is to enjoy aroma. It does not matter
as to whether the aroma of one class of leaf is distinctive to
that of another provided that it is not unpleasant.


The statement has been made that Australian tobacco is
equal in quality to any imported American leaf, and that
there is no reason why the Australian growers should not
supply all the tobacco consumed in Australia, and have some
then for export.
The making of such statements is deprecated, because they
are not in accordance with the facts, and tend to mislead
growers into the belief that there is no need for improve-
ment in their leaf.
In support of this I would refer to the result of the aroma
tests of Australian and American-grown leaf which have
been conducted by the Australian Tobacco Investigation Com-
mittee, and which results were independently confirmed by
tests made by the Imperial Institute, South Kensington,
London.
I would also refer to the further tests made by the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation Committee on 34 selected fine-
cured crops grown in the States of Victoria and New' South
Wales in 1928, and all of w'hich tests are referred to in the
preliminary report of Mr. C. M. Slagg, Bulletin No. 2, pub-
lished by the Australian Tobacco Investigation. I would
especially refer to Table 8, which is set out on page 25 of this
publication, where it wall be seen that of a total of 265,836 lb.
of fine-cured Victorian and New' South Wales leaf tested, only
22.53 per cent, was classed as possessing aroma which might
lie considered suitable for manufacture.
In dealing with the dark and No. 2 leaf, none of which
is classed as having passable to good aroma, Mr. Slagg in his
reports states as follow's: —•
From such tests as we made it seems doubtful if the
dark, heavy grades, could be used wdth safety in more
than very small percentages, except in low grade
mixtures.
We know' nothing whatever of these tests, but no doubt
evidence regarding them will be given by the proper people,
but the tests fully confirm our contentions, the opinion of
the smoking public as demonstrated by our sales, and the
findings in the report of the Tariff Board made in the year
1926, wherein it was stated as follows:
The Tariff Board has not the slightest doubt from its
investigations, confirmed by its owm experience, that the
statements made by Dr. Darnell Smith, Messrs. Howell,
Stevenson and others are accurate, and that the burning
aroma of the average Australian tobacco is unpalatable
and offensive.
On the evidence at its disposal the Board is unable to
arrive at any other conclusion than that although much
improvement with a small proportion of Australian leaf
has been brought about of late, the quality of the Aus-
tralian leaf, even at its best, has not yet reached a
standard of quality comparable with the imported leaf,
and seeing that the standard of smoking tobacco
demanded by the Australian public is as high as it is, it is
useless and hopeless to expect that any greater quantity of
the Australian leaf can be incorporated in the manu-
factured tobacco than is done at the present time.
It is quite clear, therefore, that the chief problem to be
solved, so far as Australian-grown leaf is concerned, is that
of aroma. And the solution lies in the elimination of the
grades that are not wanted by smokers and which are not
susceptible to improvement, and the production of a con
tinning and increasing quantity of flue-cured bright tobaccoes,
gradually improving until the aroma is to a greater and
greater extent more acceptable to the smoker.
The Imperial Economic Committee in their Ninth Deport
on Empire Tobacco include the following in their summary
of conclusions, viz.:—
The chief requisite is a gradually increasing supply
of high quality, and to this end we believe producers’
organizations carefully conducted and taking the long
view, can greatly contribute.
My company has always endeavoured to take the long view
so far as the industry in Australia is concerned, because we
believe that there is no short cut to successfully establishing
the industry. We took the long view when we insisted on
line-curing, and time has proved we were right. We are
taking the long view in regard to the production of unsuit-
able types of leaf, and we have no doubt whatever that in
the long run our attitude in this regard will he found to be
in the best interests of the industry.
On a survey of the whole position, it is difficult to sec
what further steps my company could have taken in order to
help the industry.
We are quite satisfied that the time and money which has
been expended in the past few years has been justified, and
that the investigation of the experts is proceeding along the
right lines. As a result, more knowledge has been obtained
and more progress made in the endeavour to solve the difficult
problems which confront the industry than at any time
(lin ing the last 50 years.
My company is very hopeful that if all concerned will work
in unison along scientific lines, the methods of the growers
will be improved and new districts will he found where
tobacco more suitable for manufacture can he grown, with the
result that a greater proportion of the tobacco consumed in
Australia will be grown here; but until this position has
arisen we are of opinion that it would be disastrous to try
and compel us to use the present Australian-grown leaf in
manufacture to a greater extent than we are now doing, as
this would probably result in the public demand for our pro-
ducts decreasing, and consequently restrict our ability to
purchase from the growers. In addition, the position of our
5,300 employees w r ould be jeopardized as also would be the
revenue amounting to approximately £7,000,000 per annum
derived from the industry by the Commonwealth.
Any attempt to put obstacles in the w T ay of the improve-
ment in the methods of the growers, and of growdng tobacco in
any districts which the experts may consider more favorable
than the present commercial areas, is going to prevent the
successful development of the industry.
In this connexion we are of the definite opinion that the
Federal authority is the proper authority, assisted by the
State authorities, to have supervision of the whole matter, as
it will take the long view r and consider the matter from an
Ansira 11a.i and not from a local point of view'.
286. By Mr. Martens. —What are the benefits re-
ceived by the employees of your company?—We have
a life assurance scheme; the life of every employee is
insured at the expense of the company. Our desire is
that at the age of 60 years each employee should retire
with £6OO in cash. Up to a certain salary the company
pays the whole of the premium. The various benefits
may be seen from the following statement; —

Since the above date the basic wage for male adults has
been increased from £4 18s. 6d. to £5 Is. per week, with
corresponding increases to females and juveniles. In addition,
payment for all holidays including two w’ceks at Christmas
has been granted to piece-workers thus establishing a con-
tinuance of wages for 52 weeks in the year to all employees
in the industry.
287. By the Chairman . —I notice tliat tire company
has allocated £38,160 for the current year to enable
its employees to participate in tbe profits?— Yes, Dur-
ing the last fifteen years employees have been allotted
540,000 shares, on which dividends have amounted to
£56,743. Those are allotted to all males aged 21 years,
having two years' service, and all females aged 21
years, with two years’ service, or any other females who
have four years service. There are no awards in the
tobacco industry. We make our own arrangements
with the employees.
288. By Mr. Jones. —ls the profit-sharing scheme
given effect to by a cash distribution?— No. The only
cash distribution is the dividend on the shares allotted.
Some four or five years ago we revised the whole scheme
and opened trust accounts for our employees. They get
a share in the profits on the basis of their earnings up
to a maximum of £250 a year. They cannot touch
the principal until they are 60 years of age. We build


houses for our employees at low rates of interest. The
rate was originally 3 per cent., and now, I believe,
it is 4| per cent. The profit-sharing scheme together
with the life insurance scheme, aims at each employee
receiving a cash sum on retirement. When the bread
winner dies in our industry the widow receives on an
average from £BOO to £l,OOO.
289. By Mr. Smith. —Have you been able to age the
bright tobaccoes for two years before using them? —No,
but as science is being brought to bear on the work we
are proceeding on the idea that as we have two years'
stock it is wise for us to keep that for Australia.
290. You have not raised the prices of the cheaper
grades?—l have already said that Havelock dark has
only been increased 9d. a lb. Where the company has
not paid the increase to the growers it has given it to
the public. When the price of Havelock aromatic was
raised Is. we only raised it lid. to the public. The
duty on American leaf was Is. Our reasons for increas-
ing the price of dark Havelock by 9d. only was that
there w 7 as a proportion of Australian leaf in it.
291. By the Chairman. —Would not the margin of
profit available to the company on all its manufactures
have enabled it to carry the extra duty on imported leaf
without increasing the price to the public ?—That brings
us to the profits of the company. That, I suggest, is a
matter that does not come within the scope of the
inquiry.
292. One of the disadvantages of increasing the duty
is that the prices paid by the public are generally
increased. I am entitled to ask whether the extra duty
of Is. a lb. on the imported leaf was such that it was
impossible for the company to continue to supply the
goods to the public without passing the duty on? —I
say definitely that it was not possible.
293. By Mr. Jones. —You said the average price paid
for Australian bright tobacco for a certain period was
3s. Id. For what period ?—For the last twelve months.
294. Apart from the increase due to the bonus, has
any increase been paid?— No.
295. On what percentage of the Australian pro-
duction was the price of 3s. Id. a lb. paid last year?
On 19.92 per cent.
296. Did you say that a fair average price of Ameri-
can bright leaf was Is. a lb.? —No. I said the average
landed cost of American bright leaf, re-dried, was
17.88 d. a lb.
297. Does it cost 6d. a lb. to laud that? —The Is. is
for green leaf, which w’ould compare with the price of
3s. Id. which we pay 7 here, but the green leaf has to be
re-dried. It has to be cased and shipped to Australia.
298. By Mr. Smith. —l understand the American
leaf travels out here with 10 per cent, to 12 per cent, of
moisture in it?—lt is generally reckoned at about 14
per cent. The Customs Department have a way of
their own for calculating the moisture content of Aus-
tralian leaf. When we buy leaf from an Australian
grower, the customs officer takes a “ hand ” of tobacco
out and cooks it on a stove for a certain number of
hours. I think 6.3 per cent, is a conservative figure.
299. By Mr. Jones.— Have you any 7 idea of the sum
spent in advertising the brands showing a decrease in
popularity, as against those showing an increase?—l
will get any figures the committee may require, but
the sum spent in advertising is not a factor in regard
to the decline in the popularity of certain brands.
300. Most of the tobaccoes advertised in the Australian
newspapers are not made from Australian leaf? —That
is so; but they contain a percentage of Australian leaf.
We made special efforts to popularize No. 2 brands;
but it w r as useless. We spent about £BOO to get a sale of
27.000 lb. of “ Signet ” tobacco. “ Waratah ” has been
remarkably well advertised, and our sales are now 7 only
1.000 lb. per annum, although in one year w 7 e formerly
sold 14,000 lb.
301. By Mr. Morgan. —From 1931 the growers must
not produce more than 10 per cent, of the dark leaf?
—We have not been so severe as that. No. 1 dark leaf
includes mahogany. We say we will take 150,000 lb.;
but we will not have more than 10 per cent, of the pure
dark leaf. Assuming the crop last year was 750,000
lb., we are taking 150,000 lb., or 20 per cent. We have
used this tobacco up to the absolute limit of safety.
302, By Mr. Smith. —ln your company’s guarantee
prior to the present guarantee, did you not undertake
to purchase 600,000 lb. of dark tobacco? —In 1926, 1927,
and 1928. We entered into an undertaking in 1925,
when the position was very different from to-day.
303. Had you purchased that quantity?— No.
304. The fact that you guaranteed to take that
quantity induced the growers to produce it?— Yes; but
as I have already pointed out, we were faced with a
huge decline in the demand for Australian tobacco.
305. What was the company’s object in purchasing
inferior leaf ?—ln the past we have “ carried the baby.”
Now we have come to the stage where we say we cannot
continue as in the past. We think substantial improve-
ment is being made. We have more bright leaf this
year than ever before. I have been in the field. If
we refuse to purchase individual crops our actions are
misjudged.
306. But the growers have thought that there was
a demand for this tobacco?— Not at all. The bright
spot in the industry is the increased production of
bright leaf.
307. By Ihe Chairman. —Do you know that, as a
result of their experience in the last five or six years,
a number of growers in Victoria and New South Wales
have themselves discovered methods of, not only resist-
ing, but in many cases eliminating blue mould ?•—-I
believe that is so. It is largely a matter of personal
opinion. I have a feeling that they are getting the
better of this disease.
308. Apart from the statement you have presented
have you any suggestions of your own to put forward
for the improvement of the industry?— No. To a large
extent the report I have read represents my personal
views.
309. What do you think of the suggestion that the
excise duty should be abolished? —I do not think that
would have any good effect at all. I think everything
has been done as regards prices. The grower does not
need any more protection than he is now getting. Qn
the aromatic leaf we are paying 3s. Id., and as the
percentage of bright Australian leaf increases the posi-
tion of the grower will improve. The public has
demonstrated that it is not a question of prices. They
can now buy all-Australian tobacco for ss. 2d. a lb., as
against Bs. lid. for dark “ Havelock.” As regards the
more expensive brands, I do not think the proposition
in regard to the excise is practicable. Every available
pound of the bright leaf is used. We have offered to
take 1,350,000 lb. per annum of bright tobacco, and the
growers are only producing 250,000 lb., or roughly 20
per cent, of requirements.
310. Do y 7 ou say Australia is contributing not more
than 10 per cent, of the tobacco smoked in the country
to-day?—l think it is less than 10 per cent.
311. Is it fair to say that the Australian contribution
to the consumption is about 5 per cent.?—l think it
is a little more than that.
312. Is it a fact that, in 1904, the proportion was
as high as 20 per cent, or 25 per cent.?—lt is quite
possible.
313. By Mr. Morgan. —What are the best selling
lines ?—“ Havelock,” “ Champion,” and “ Capstan.”
314. You do not think an alteration of the tariff
policy would make any difference in the economic posi-
tion of the industry?— No.


315. What do you think of the economic effect of the
recent rise in duty?— Obviously, it must help the
grower, even more than he was being helped over the
transitory period, when he had to produce more bright
leaf. The present duty is virtually a bounty.
316. The growers point out that, no matter how good
their grade of leaf is, the return works out at an
average of 2s. a lb?—The leaf is bought and paid for
according to its quality.
317. Do you think a bounty granted by the Com-
monwealth Government would be of assistance to the
industry ?- My company is not opposed to anything
that will assist the growers; but since it has given a
bounty of Is., and as the price of bright tobacco is so
high, I do not think a bounty is necessary. On dark
tobacco it would be a tremendous mistake, and a
hindrance to the industry.
318. The proposal of the growers presented to the
Federal Government last year was for a bounty of
6d. a lb. on dark leaf, 9d. on dark mahogany, and Is.
on lemon-coloured?—On the present basis of prices I
do not think there is any necessity for it. The mini-
mum offer for lemon-coloured is 25., plus Is. bonus.
There has been a reason for the bonus. The first 3d.
was given to encourage flue-curing, the next 3d. was
to give a little more encouragement to the growing
of bright leaf. The additional 6d. was equivalent to
the recommendation of the Tariff Board and was
virtually given by the company to help the grower
during the transitory period. I can see many dis-
advantages and no advantages in altering the present
prices.
319. By Mr. Jones.— ls it a fact that you have not
been able to procure as much bright leaf as you have
been prepared to purchase?— That is so. For 1926,
1927 and 1928 there was a written undertaking to
take 900,000 lb. per annum.
320. What is your opinion as to the abolition of the
excise duty on Australian-grown leaf, graded as bright
leaf, as an incentive to the growers to produce more of
that type ?—I do not think they require a greater incen-
tive than they now have. When they were getting only
a bonus of 3d. they said that, if they bad a further 3d.
they would be made.
321. If a reduction in the excise on bright leaf were
brought about, would that not be an advantage both
to the growers and the company?— No. As soon as an
alteration in duty of any bind is made it has always
been the policy of the company to give the benefit to
the public.
322. If the abolition of the excise duty were brought
about you could obtain the leaf 2s. 4d. a lb. cheaper
than at present. That would give you an advantage
over the American leaf? —If there is any advantage
coming in that way it should be given to the smokers.
The grower is now in a very good position.
323. By the Chairman. —You think that, if the
grower receives an average of 2s. a lb. for his tobacco
he is in as satisfactory a position as he should be?—l
do not put it that way. I have quoted the 2s. which
is generally quoted by growers as the average, but as
to what profits they make I cannot say. My attitude
is that surely the growers, with the protection they
now enjoy, should be able to carry on their industry!
324, By Mr. Jones. —How long prior to the Tariff
Board’s investigations were bonuses paid?—l think we
gave the first 3d. from the time whmi we went in for
encouraging flue-curing.
325. Do you favour the establishment of grading
depots, as has been suggested?— Something ought to
be done; but I am not prepared to say what is the
best way to accomplish the desired object. One essen-
tial is that there should be more assistance from the
government departments in the matter. The grower
himself should know all about grading, and therefore
I do not believe in sending all the leaf to Melbourne
for grading purposes. There should be somebody on
the spot to advise the growers. In the past the com-
pany has arranged to give the growers as much advice
and assistance as possible.
326. Do you favour grading depots?— Those
interested might try to devise a workable scheme. One
difficulty is that the districts are very far removed from
one another.
327. Would you suggest one depot at Wangaratta?
—The trouble is that that would not take in Pomonal.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.

SATURDAY, 25th JANUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman:
Mr. Jones i Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens | Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C, L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company; Mr. C. M. Slagg,
representing the Australian Tobacco Investigation:
Air. Temple Smith, Tobacco Expert, Department
of Agriculture, Victoria).
Samuel Sherwin Cameron, D.V.Sc., M.R.C.Y.S.,
Director of Agriculture, Victoria, and member of
the Executive Committee of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, was called, sworn, and
examined.
328. By the ChnJnnan. —How long have you occu-
pied your position. For nineteen years.
329. Do you wish to make a statement to the com-
mittee?—l have no view to express on paragraphs a
and h or in terms of the reference to this com-
mittee, inasmuch as they refer to what may
be termed political expedients for helping the
industry. I prefer to state my views from
the point of view of tobacco-growing as a primary
industry, of which I have had 19 years official ex-
perience in the administrative efforts made by the
Victorian Government particularly, and to some extent
I have knowledge of the efforts of other Governments,
to promote the welfare of the industry, the vicissitudes
of which I have followed during that period. Tobacco-
growing is one of a number of primary industries in
respect of which the grower has only the initial
responsibility. He is finished with his job after he has
harvested his leaf and submitted it to the first of many
processes that it has to undergo before it becomes fit
to smoke. That preliminary post-growing process is
barn-curing, which should be very clearly distinguished
from other processes that the tobacco has to be subjected
to for maturing its qualities. This industry comes
much within the same category as butter manufacture;
that is to say, there is a secondary process. The farmer
may produce a perfectly good milk and cream, and
quite an unsatisfactory butter, cheese, or casein may
be made from it. Similarly, even wheat, before it is
consumed, is subjected to processes of , a secondary
character. Perhaps a more suitable parallel is fur-
nished by the wine industry, in which the grower’s job
finishes with the production of the grape or raisin which
is subsequently used for the distillation of wine or spirit.


The drying of the raisin practically corresponds to the
curing of the tobacco leaf. I have emphasized that
point, because I am going to submit a viewpoint on
which I hold very strong opinions, based upon observa-
tions and very careful inquiries and comparisons of
the processes that tobacco leaf undergoes after it
leaves the grower and before it reaches the manufac-
turer, For years I w r as puzzled to accept the suggestion
that the alleged bad aroma of Australian tobacco was
due to soil or climate, or to soil and climate. I could
not understand how it was that Australian soils and
climates, which enable us to produce butter, grains of
all kinds, wine, fruits of all kinds, both raAv and manu-
factured —all of which possess aroma and flavour, and,
in the case of wines, bouquet—fell down in the case of
tobacco.
330. That is only a suggestion?— Hot only that, it is
only an assumption. As I became experienced and
made observations I learned that, after being har-
vested, and before it was consumed, tobacco underwent
many different and distinct processes of treatment. It
appeared to me that on the law of averages there were
many odds in favour of the leaf receiving adverse in-
fluences after it had been harvested than before. In the
first place, is had to be subjected to curing in the barn.
Two years ago, when abroad, I was asked to make in-
quiries on behalf of the Tobacco Investigation Com-
mittee concerning any phases of the industry that came
under my purview. I furnished a report to that com-
mittee, which is referred to in the report presented
yesterday by Dr. Rivett. In that report I indicated,
by comparison of methods and practices in America,
what I think are the reforms necessary to remedy the
faults in Australian leaf. If I tell you what is the
procedure in up-to-date American circles it will give
some indication of what is required. The tobacco is
bought in America from the grower at much the
same stage as in Australia, that is, after it has been
barn-cured by the grower. By barn-curing I mean any
one of the forms of curing that are adopted according
to the types of tobacco. There are types suitable for
flue-curing and others suitable only for air-curing.
There are also types that are better sun-cured, and there
is a fire-cured type. That is all done before the tobacco
is sold by the farmer. As a general rule the leaf is
purchased, not by the manufacturers, but by an inter-
mediary body of merchants or traders, a set of organi-
zations that does not exist in Australia. Tobacco is
graded in America at about five different stages, and
this body does at least three of the gradings. This
intermediary organization, comprising a number of
firms, has buyers and warehouses known as “ re-order-
ing ” or packing warehouses, and they take the respon-
sibility for the tobacco from the time it is purchased to
the time when it is bought from them by manufac-
turers. I do not mean that the whole of the tobacco
is handled in that way, but in the majority of cases it is.
Some big manufacturers have their own re-ordering
and packing warehouses, but this function is very
distinct from the manufacture of the leaf. The
organization undertakes the responsibility of the cost
of keeping so much capital idle during the ageing
period. Then it is able to sell the tobacco in big lots
to the manufacturers. The intermediary organization
undertakes—
(1) The purchasing of growers’ graded and cured
tobacco;
(2) The grading, “ re-ordering,” and processing
for storage;
(3) The “ prizing ” and storing of tobacco
(usually in large hogsheads) for from one tt
three or more years. “Ageing” period.)
(4) The sale to manufacturers in lots suitably
graded and of suitable size for manufac-
turers’ requirements.
I pointed out in the report that I presented to the
Investigation Committee the following facts regarding
the American system: —
After purchase at the warehouse each buyer’s purchases
are packed in hogsheads for transport to the “ prizing
house.” During this packing as far as possible similar types
and grades of leaf are packed together. Opportunity is also
taken to exercise a greater refinement in grading the types
and qualities than the growers’ lots show.
At the re-ordering or storage warehouses the preparation
for storage or ageing mentioned above is carried out. The
prime object of the process originally was apparently to bring
about a uniform and standard moisture content in the
tobacco as purchased on the selling floor, which, of course,
would vary considerably, and so result in a variable intensity
and effect of the sweating which proceeds when the tobacco
is stored in hogsheads during the ageing period.
331. By Mr. Bentley. —What is the percentage of
evaporation?— First of all the leaf is dried until it is
practically brittle. The heat applied is bacteriocidal
and fungicidal. Then it is subjected to cold, and later
on the opportunity for re-absorption of moisture is
given by passing the leaf through steam ovens to bring
it back to a moisture of 12 to 14 per cent, for local
manufacture.
332. By the Chairman. —Will you resume your
statement ? —Having got the tobacco to a uniform mois-
ture content it is packed into hogsheads weighing from
600 lb. to over 1,000 lb. Then it is subjected to prizing
or pressure as in the case of wool, and it is left in the
hogsheads for varying periods. In years gone by four
years was considered desirable, but the enormous cost
of holding such large quantities for so long was so
great that the period has been reduced. During the
time the tobacco is undergoing this ageing process
sweating takes place, heat develops as in a silo, and
changes go on in the organic constituents of the tobacco
leaf. There is evidence that there is a very definite
interchange of a chemical character between the con-
stituents of the leaf and between various blends of
tobacco or of individual leaves. There is scientific
foundation for that statement. There is also ample
evidence published that this ageing process has a very
definite influence upon the character and quality of the
tobacco, including the aroma. It is unfortunate that
it is not known on what aroma depends.
333. By Mr. Jones.- —Are those processes carried out
in Australia ?—I have been told that the ageing process
is not. I have no knowledge on that point, except the
statement of Mr. Bentley yesterday that prior to last
year the tobacco was used practically as it was received
during the year following its reception in the factory.
334. Do these processes have a marked effect on the
aroma ?—Yes.
333. By Mr. Bentley. —At least 90 per cent, of the
American leaf we use is purchased on the market floor
out of the current year’s crop?— The keeping of the
tobacco by the farmer in loose piles from January
to October is not the ageing that it is subjected to in
the re-ordering and prizing houses in America, which
is a particular process following upon a sterilization
and the giving to the tobacco of a uniform moisture
content under a particular pressure, whereby particular
sweating actions are set up.
336. By the Chairman. —Do you suggest that the
methods adopted in Australian and the periods allowed
for ageing are quite inadequate to bring the best
qualities out of the local leaf?— Yes, assuming that that
is not being done in Australia. Definite investigations
could be made on that point. My main contention is
that there are factors other than soil and climate that
are likely to operate in the non-development of a
satisfactory aroma in Australian tobacco. Therefore I
place little reliance on smoking tests which are purely
empirical tests, based on the smoking of cigarettes
made from raw leaf that has not undergone any of the
mellowing processes to which I have referred. Figures


suggesting that only 22 per cent, of such and such a
tobacco has a suitable aroma, and that about 80 per
cent, is bad or objectionable, are not fair to the
industry. If the smoking tests were carried out after
the leaf had been properly aged, the percentage of
disagreeable aroma would be very much lower, and the
reputation of the Australian leaf would be greatly
enhanced.
337. By Mr. Morgan. —But the consumers are the
final court of appeal?— Absolutely; but it is my job to
look after the interests of the grower, and to protect
him as much as possible.
338. By the Chairman.- —Does the fact that an
explanation is not published with these tests detract
further from their merits?— Yes. I have put this view-
point so that the committee will not get such an
exaggerated notion of the inferior smoking qualities of
Australian tobacco as those tests would indicate.
339. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you think that the
growers’ interests should override those of the con-
sumers? —Certainly not. Unless the grower does his
part his industry must eventually suffer. But the
growers’ work should be subject to the arbitrament of
a test comparable with that applied by the consumer.
That is to say, the tobacco should he judged according
to the flavour and aroma after it has passed through
the manufacturing stages.
340. By the Chairman. —You say the tests are based
on inconclusive data?— Yes. It is like attempting to
estimate the bouquet of a chahlis or hock in the first
juices.
341. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you say that the manu-
facturers to-day are avoiding that standard? —My
references are to the smoking tests with respect to
investigation work.
342. By Mr. Jones. —Have these tests been made to
any extent in Australia, and is it fair to condemn Aus-
tralian leaf until they have been made?—l have no
exact knowledge as to what happens to the tobacco
after it is bought from the farmer.
343. By the Chairman. —Referring to the appoint-
ment of Mr. Slagg, the following advertisement
appeared in Nature of the 27th xiugust, 1927, an
English scientific publication:—
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.
Tobacco Production Investigations.
Applications are invited for the position of director of
tobacco investigations to be conducted under the aegis of the
Governments of the Commonwealth and the States of Australia.
The investigations will cover the whole field of economic
production of tobacco in Australia. The aim will be to im-
prove the quality and aroma of Australian-grown leaf, and
it will be necessary to study the influences of climate, soil,
fertilizers, &c. upon the growth of the plant; also to study
and control diseases such as “ Blue Mould ” as well as other
economic factors in the industry.
Applicants should have had thorough university training
(or its equivalent) in plant physiology and pathology, with
special experience, in some aspects at least, of tobacco-
growing and curing. It is not expected that any applicant
will possess expert knowledge of every phase of the industry;
hence selection of a supporting staff will be deferred until the
director has been appointed.
The salary offered is from £1,500 to £2,000 per annum
(with travelling expenses) according to qualifications. The
period of appointment will be three years, and the term may
be extended. Sealed applications in duplicate, accompanied
by full details of training and experience, and by not more
than six testimonials, should be addressed marked “ To-
bacco ” to—Official Secretary, Commonwealth of Australia,
Australia House, Strand, London, and should be delivered
not later than noon, 17th October. 1927.
344. Were you charged with the work of making
the selection?— Advertisements were published all over
the world for this position and the applications were
transmitted to London at a time when I was there
attending the Imperial Agricultural Research Confer-
ence. I think there were about 23 applications, and I
was asked by Sir George Julius, one of the other dele-
gates to the conference, to assist in making a choice.
Prior to my leaving Australia, Mr. Gepp, Chairman
of the Investigation Committee, had said there was
a possibility of the applications being received in time
for me to examine them and possibly for me to inter-
view any applicants. The list had been reduced to six,
hut as a matter of fact I went through all the appli-
cations.
345. Who collaborated with you in this work?— Sir
George Julius. Four of the six were Americans.
346. Did you have anything to do with the elimina-
tion to six?— Ho. I do not know who was responsible
for that.
347. Did you go through them with Sir George
Julius ?—I went through them by myself. Concerning
the South African applicants I took the opportunity
of a discussion with Colonel Williams, who was the
delegate to the conference from the South African
Union, with Mr. Hornby of Hyassaland, and with
another delegate from Ehodesia. I consulted the dele-
gates from India and the Punjab about the Indian
applicants, and I consulted particularly with Mr.
Archibald who is head of the Canadian Agricultural
Division. When I left for America I was asked by
Sir George Julius to confer with Sir Hugh Denison,
then Australian Commissioner to the United States
of America. I was asked with him to interview, if
possible, the three American and the Canadian appli-
cants. I myself interviewed the three American appli-
cants, and we jointly interviewed Mr. Slagg. Sir Hugh
Denison then communicated with Mr. Gepp and I com-
municated with Sir George Julius by cable in London.
The three American candidates were interviewed at
Washington.
348. The final selection was made by you in con-
junction with Sir Hugh Denison?—Ho; subsequent
to that Sir George Julius visited the United States of
America. I cabled to him stating that we recommended
Mr. Slagg.
349. Mr. Slagg told us that he accepted the position
because the inducement v/as given to him that at the
end of three years he was practically certain of a
renewal of his appointment; otherwise he would not
have accepted it?— That is not correct.
350. The advertisement stated that the period of
appointment would be for three years, and the term
“may he” extended?— That is so. We did not go
beyond that. The advertisement indicated a salary up
to £2,000. Our recommendation was made by telegram
in these terms, “We jointly recommend appointment
three years, commencing salary £1,500. Increments
for your determination later without obligation. Also
transportation expenses to Melbourne, including wife
and daughter, and return transportation if engage-
ment terminates within three years.” With our limited
authority we could not possibly make any statement as
to a continuation of the engagement after three years,
except that we represented that in the event of it being
determined by all parties to the agreement that further
investigation was necessary the investigation would con-
tinue beyond the three-year period.
351. It seems clear that no specific undertaking was
given, but as a result of the conversation with you and
Sir Hugh Denison, Mr. Slagg accepted the position,
fully believing that he would be in Australia in charge
of this work for a much longer period than three years ?
—I think he would have had reasonable ground for
believing that, provided it was decided to carry on the
investigation, and his work was satisfactory, he would.
352. By Mr. Jones. —Did you alone interview the
American applicants?— Yes.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.


{Taken at Wangaratta.)
WEDNESDAY, 29th JANUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C, L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company; Mr. 0. M. Slagg,
represented the Australian Tobacco Investigation;
Mr. Temple Smith, Tobacco Expert, Department
of Agriculture, Victoria).
Leslie Herbert Sambell, Beechworth, Secretary of the
Victorian Tobacco-growers’ Association, Wangaratta,
was called, sworn and examined.
353. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
that position?— About six months.
354. Do you desire to make a statement to the com-
mittee?— Yes. We are handicapped by the fact that
the late secretary of the organization, Mr. Bradley,
had to resign on account of ill-health.
355. Has the statement been prepared by you on
behalf of, the association? —Yes. It practically
embodies the policy of the association. It is as
follows:
The Victorian Tobacco-growers’ Association comprises a
membership of approximately 150, with six district branches
chiefly carrying on activities in the Ovens and King River
valleys. The association was formed to primarily assist
growers in—
(o) Production of better quality leaf.
(6) Improved methods of curing and grading.
(o) Marketing and sale of leaf. (Prices to be based on
Australian parity) ; and
{ d) Generally to assist the industry not only from the
growers standpoint but in the wider interests of
the State.
The industry has had rather a difficult career —if career
it may be called —and the objective of the association, which
claims to represent practically the whole of the growers in the
north-east, is primarily to place the industry on a sound basis.
The growers have by honest endeavour demonstrated that
suitable leaf can be grown in Australia, and have been, and
are, prepared to adopt new and/or improved methods to meet
altered conditions.
The two main factors affecting their efforts were —
(а) The change over to flue-curing within the past ten
years or so, and
(б) The comparatively recent change in public taste
demanding light tobacco.
The construction of the requisite kilns, drying sheds, &c.,
involved an expenditure of some thousands of pounds, but
was readily undertaken by growers, and practically all leaf
is now flue-cured.
With regard to the decreased consumption of dark tobacco
—in no way due to quality of Australian leaf— growers again
responded, and by improved methods of planting, selection of
seed, artificial manuring, watering of crop, attention to stem-
ming and cultivation and careful grading and handling have
succeeded in increasing the production of bright tobaccoes from
12 per cent, to 20 per cent, of the crop. iTmust be admitted
that the offer of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company to
in 1925 purchase 800,000 lb. of dark leaf—representing more
than 50 per cent, of its total purchases—was an indication
that dark leaf was required, and to now, within five years,
limit that ouantity to 10 per cent., must be conceded
a definite setback to scores of growers. Many of these have
erec eel on their properties kims, barns, &c., costing some
hundreds of pounds, on the recommendations of the Govern-
ment and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, and
are now informed that the type of leaf grown on their par-
ticular plots cannot be purchased, and they are thus being
forced out of the industry. The committee will realize that
this involves the loss of specially prepared kilns, &c., erected
as above stated at a cost of hundred of pounds, and as areas
specially purchased for tobacco-growing are insufficient to
aiiab e growers to grow other remunerative crops the position
is a very serious one. My association is hopeful that these
growers will be able to purchase new areas of lighter soil,
so that not only will a continuity of supply be maintained,
but the experience of these growers will be still retained in
the industry. Fortunately there are large, if not almost
unlimited, areas of these lighter soils available in the north-
east (and in other parts), and if the proposals of the
association are favorably viewed by the committee we will
continue to meet the changed conditions and encourage growers
to meet the popular demand so that a definite and much needed
impetus will be given. In this connexion it may be of interest
to state that the cost of land and buildings to the average
grower is approximately £2,500.
Referring to the statement of Mr. Bentley of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, that his company agreed to
take 420,000 lb. of dark leaf in 1929, I desire to point out
that the original offer was to take 200,000 lb. only, and it
was as a result of the representations made by the Agricul-
tural Department and by this association that the quantity
was increased. I want to make it clear, however, that such
representations were made because we recognized that it was
not possible for the growers to change over from dark to
light leaf in such a short period. In regard to this we
further state that we have impressed on growers not merely
the advisability but the imperative necessity of producing the
hvhter icat to neec he po nuar demand. Circulars embodying
the recommendations of Mr. Temple Smith of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture and the Australian Tobacco Investi-
gation Committee have been sent by us to growers throughout
the district.
Reference has been made to the reduced percentage of
consumption of Australian-grown leaf, and this has been
attributed by the manufacturers to the quality or aroma
of the local article. Personally, I consider that there may be
other contributing factors such as the unfair and inexplicable
prejudice of a large percentage of the public to “ Australian
made,” and to the fact that the brands of all American leatf
are sold under such well known names as Havelock, Champion
and Capstan, and that the purely Australian or composite
brands are thereby handicapped. Fortunately there appears
now an increasin'.!' tendency of the average Australian to
support the home-grown product, and he (and she) may well
be iadu'-.’d to extend such preference to tobaccoes and cigarettes
made from our own leaf. The removal of the excise duty
on Australian-grown leaf would also enable the public to
obtain a cheaper smoke, and the demand for this leaf would
then increase considerably.
Having thus traversed the position generally, I now wish
to refer to the requests of the growers referred to in the
terms of the inquiry by this Select Committee. Clauses (o)
and (6) refer to the request for a bounty or, alternatively,
i"! M'/’re-scd import duty and a doorcase in excise duty on
locally-grown leaf.
My association definitely prefers the decrease in excise duty
and asks that this be abolished. Personally, it appears to
me that the levying of such an excise duty (of 2s. 4d. per lb.
in case of tobacco) on any Australian-grown article cannot be
justified and is fundamentally opposed to the general practice
and policy of all Governments to foster its own products. We
have the extraordinary position of the Government receiving
in m m-<e much mure than the actual growers from the sale
of tobacco leaf grown in Australia—in plain fact the growers
receive approximately 2s. per lb. for their leaf and the Govern-
ment receives 2s. 4d. per lb. from same leaf in excise. What
other industry would or could stand this impost? On the
contrary, on other home-grown products bounties are paid,
official marketing boards formed, national headworks for
water supply constructed, advances made at nominal rates of
interest and generally every assistance given by the Govern-
ment. Why the difference in the tobacco industry?
It may be advanced that tobacco, or rather the smoking of
it. is a luxury, or something we do not need for our mere
existence. I join issue here and require evidence in support
of any such contention. Motor cars are generally included
under the heading of luxuries, particularly referring to
private cars, &c. The Government places a heavy import
duty on motor cars. It is now proposed to build cars in
Australia. Will the Government be game to place an
“excise” duty on the locally manufactured car? We have
the State Government on the one hand assisting the tobacco-
growers to increase their supplies and to grow improved
quality leaf, and on the other hand the Federal Government
imposing an excise or penalty on the same product. The
situation to me appears almost Gilbertian. Webster states
that a luxury is an expensive rarity as jewels, rare fruits,
&c., and quotes “ riches expose a man to luxury ”, Well it
cannot be contended for a moment that only rich men smoke.
This excise of 2s. 4d. on the poor man’s tobacco cannot be
justified.
Now it will be asked where and what are the benefits to be
derived from the abolition of the unfair and unjustifiable
impost. There are very substantial benefits to be derived
both to the grower and to the State. The grower would
receive increased prices for his leaf, which would encourage
him to grow increased quantities and would induce others to
take up the industry. The increased prices would encourage
new companies to take up the manufacture of locally-grown
leaf, with a reduction in price of the manufactured article
thus giving twofold benefit. When it is recognized that
tobacco leaf to the value of almost £3,000,000 is imported into
Australia every year it will be seen that the possibilities are
incalculable.


The extension of the industry would mean that instead
of 200 growers we would have thousands of growers, giving
employment to tens of thousands of Australians, who, in turn,
would become potential consumers of this and other Australian-
grown products. The opening up of markets for many of our
other home-grown products is greatly agitating the minds
of our Governments and organizations, but with this industry
there can be no possibility of over-production for a generation
or more. The Government, therefore, can with confidence give
all the assistance in its power to foster production and relieve
this industry of the impost placed upon it. If the excise duty
were lifted the loss of revenue would not exceed £lOO,OOO per
annum, which cannot be a serious factor in the total revenue
of the Commonwealth, and in any case is less than one-tenth
of the extra revenue now received as a result of the extra
Is. per lb. duty recently imposed, which will bring in an
increased revenue of about £1,000,000 per annum. The Tariff
Board, after exhaustive inquiry into the whole industry in
1926, recommended that the excise duty payable on all lemon-
colored and bright mahogany tobacco leaf be reduced by 6d.
per lb., but effect was not given to this recommendation. Mv
association definitely is out to obtain Australian parity for
its growers, and does not wish to increase the price of the
manufactured article to the public.
In Western Australia the sale of tobacco containing 50 per
cent, of Australian leaf has increased sixteen-fold. Yet on the
whole the percentage of Australian leaf used has been reduced
from 10 per cent, to approximately G per cent. My association
cannot see why this position should obtain, and is prepared to
assist in every way to rectify same.
It would appear that the chief objejetions to Australian
leaf are—
( a ) Aroma.
(6) High percentage of dark leaf,
(c) Faulty grading.
{a) Aroma. —The Australian Tobacco Investigation Com-
mittee has been and is making exhaustive tests of the aroma
of various types of leaf selected from various States, and up to
88 per cent, of locally-grown bright leaf appears to possess
mild agreeable aroma and on the whole good burning qualities,
The tests showed that the percentage of passable and agreeable
aroma much lower in the dark and mahogany samples.
Therefore it appears that the policy of my association in
advising to improve percentage of bright or lemon-
colour leaf and in discouraging the production of the dark
quality leaf should improve the position and the reputation
of our product. There still remain the effect of soil and
climate. With the diversity of soils in the State—l speak
more particularly of the north-east—it would appear that
this condition can be met, and my association is confident
that suitable soils aie available. With regard to climate it
would appear that there is little variation between maximum
and mean temperatures in this district and certain tobacco-
growing districts of the United States of America, and I
suggest that humidity and temperature tests in our own
Victorian and other States’ tobacco-growing districts should
be taken and recorded along with other investigations. It
appears that the best results in the United States “of America
are obtained from leaf stored in cool, well ventilated buildings
lor two or throe years, and as tests of Australian-grown leaf
have been generally on new leaf, the latter has had the dis-
advantage there. America has had the benefit of over three
centuries of tobacco culture, and naturally is in a position
to produce better leaf, but the various investigations, tests,
and experimental stations will enable our growers to profit
thereby and to obtain improved results from year to year
as recognize that there is no “open sesame” to* the
immediate and complete success of the industry.
• [V Excess Percentage of Dark Leaf.—As stated earlier
m the report the growers cannot be charged with the position
that has now arisen due to change of public taste and prefer-
ence for lighter tobaccoes. The growers naturally were per-
turbed by this development, hut with certain reservations
are prepared to meet it; in fact the percentage of bright leaf
now produced has, as before stated, been almost doubled
in a space of two or three years. Apparently {vide United
States of America Year-Book 1922) other foreign markets
are indicating more and more a preference for the Imht
coloured cigarette type of leaf. My association agrees with
die extract in Mr. Bentley’s statement from the report of
the Imperial Economic Committee that “ The chief requisite
is a gradually increasing supply of high quality,” and to this
end we believe producers’ organizations carefully conducted
and taking the long view, can greatly contribute.'
(c). Faulty Grading.— This aspect* of production has been
exercising the minds of the growers and has been considered
at various times by my association. Mr. Bentley, Director of
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, in living evidence
last week in Melbourne, said that grading vas”a mo.A impor-
tant feature in tobacco production, and Mr. Temple Smith
hfis advocated that my association consider seriously some
scheme to bring about improvement. From the report of
G. P. Darnel I-Sraith issued by Australian Tobacco Tnvestiga-
tion Committee Bulletin No. 1 (page 25) it appears that
the growers in the United States of America do not in many
cases grade or re-dry their leaf- —this being carried out by
buying lirms. A system of grading by the Government was
being considered which it was expected would lead to the
grower obtaining a better price and the buyer a more uniform
article. My association will continue its investigation into
this question of grading and it is proposed to consider the
advisability of establishing a central grading depot as ad-
vised by Mr. Temple Smith and others. The growers will
certainly be consulted regarding this as it is felt the wishes
of the buyers must be met and the best interests of the
industry must be paramount.
I propose now 7 to deal with paragraph (c) of the inquiry “ As
to whether the arrangement entered into between the Com-
monwealth Government, certain States and the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company, to carry out experiments in
the grow ing of tobacco leaf in Australia is in the best inter-
ests of the growers ”. My association at the outset considered
that this arrangement was not in the best interests of growers.
A rather extraordinary feature of this matter is that the
growers’ association was not consulted either regarding the
appointment of this committee or its personnel. This com-
mittee was appointed to carry out experiments in the growing
of tobacco in Australia, yet the growers were not taken into
the confidence of the Federal Government, and no grower is
actually on the committee. The growers feel that there has
not been that spirit of co-operation essential to the success
or any investigation of the industry so vital to their interests.
It is considered that the results have not justified the exces-
sive expenditure incurred and we are prepared to confer with
representatives of the manufacturers and the Government to
discuss the whole position.
My own personal opinion, based on a visit to scores of
growers during the past month or so, is that an area should
oe smectad in each district and worked on the share system
with the Government and the association, and a small com-
mittee with representatives of both appointed to carry on.
ui this instance, 1 might mention that during present grow-
ing season certain crops have been affected by blue mould
at a much later stage than before, and any investigation
committee, I contend, should have promptly investigated this
iron Die which has caused not only a loss of hundreds of
pounds but Inn caused certain growers to pick leaf in im-
mature condition, and the sale of this leaf will reflect against
the industry generally. The results of the growth of these
experimental crops —including the initial sowing of seed and
planting out —could be forwarded at definite intervals to, say,
a permanent committee in each State representative of the
State and Federal Governments (cliiefly providing the techni-
cal side) and growers from various districts and results and
recommendations published in bulletin form regularly. Bv
Ibis means such committee would be in constant touch with
every phase or the production including picking, grading
and drying, and, I feel sure, would win the confidence of the
growers, which is much to be desired.
1 lie above is the reply to a certain extent to paragraph ( d)
oi the inquiry. Possibly no objection would be taken to the
Federal supervision, hut not direction of the experimental
work, which should he undertaken by a committee in each
lufnte on lines; indicated above. This I maintain would
ensure more direct and definite results at a • fraction of the
cost of die present committee.
MarkeUny or Sale of Leaf.- —This phase of the industry is
most important and my association recently received a favor-
able reply from the Minister for Customs to our request for
a Marketing Act. This proposal was not submitted in any
.-.pirit of antagonism against the present buyers, but on the
genera] principle that the grower and seller should have
some voice in the sale of his product. Practically all other
primary produce is in the market or at market rates, but
in this ease there is practically only one buyer. Agreements
have certainly been arrived at between the association on
behalf of growers, and the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany, but the majority of growers contend that this does not
operate fairly and does not give them any voice in the
valuation of their leaf. The agreement or offer set out in
.Statement 1 of Mr. Bentley was not the original offer of the
company but was amended as a result of negotiations carried
or. by this association and the Minister for Agriculture. The
comparison of costs set out m Mr. Bentley’s Statement No. 3
applies to bright leaf only, but not to other grades, and my
association will be glad of an opportunity later to supply
a statement regarding purchases of all qualities of leaf. It
will he noted that no actual increase in price for bright
leal was offered by the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany the past two years or so, though the average
qualify was higher due to improved methods of cultivation
curing, &c. In fact, though the import duty was increased
Is. pei lb., tlxe average increase paid to the grower on bright
Lai was only 5.4!. pence, and no increase in price of dark
leaf, though a certain brand of all Australian tobacco has
been raised 4d. per lb. to the consumer. But the chief objec-
tion is to the system adopted by the company in paying
bonuses on certain classes of I6af. It is claimed that the


bonus is given to encourage the production of bright leaf,
but the same result could be achieved by adding the bonus
to the price fixed for certain quality leaf. Might I illus-
trate the point this way. The grower is offered Is. lid. per
lb. for his leaf; this carries a bonus of 3d. per lb. or total
of 2s. 2d. If, however, the value of his neighbour’s crop is
2s. the total received is 35., or lOd. more, though actual value
of leaf is admitted to be only Id. more. The objection lies
in the fact that the bonus is paid on the company’s own
valuation and, without reflecting in any way on the buyers,
the grower is naturally inclined to complain. It is perfectly
certain that wool or wheat-growers would not accept such a
system. If the bonuses were paid on the values obtained in
open market the same objection may not lie, but my asso-
ciation considers that the objective, i.e. the incentive to
growers to produce the best leaf, could be obtained in the
ordinary way and give greater satisfaction than at present.
Pending the promised Marketing Act, my association con-
siders that a representative of the department and/or the
association should accompany the buyer when valuing the
leaf on the farm, and I have the assurance of the company
that this will now be arranged for. The grading of the leaf
is a big factor in fixing values, and, as already indicated,
the association will consider this. We also definitely request
that in any recommendations of the select committee regard-
ing a marketing act, the control remains with the growers.
My association will oppose any bill that provides for govern-
ment control.
Mr. Bentley in his statement set out that a substantial
proportion of locally-grown leaf was produced by Chinese.
This I do not think is correct, and in Victoria, at least,
practically no leaf is now produced by Chinese, so that it is
purely an industry employing white labour and entitled to
every assistance.
Mr. Bentley gives four reasons why, in his opinion, the
tobacco industry in Australia has not succeeded, and I
desire to somewhat disagree with same—
1. The difficulty of soil and climate. I have traversed
this phase of the position overleaf and again contend
that suitable soil is available and generally climatic
conditions do not greatly differ from those in certain
tobacco-growing districts in the States.
2. The prevalence of blue mould. This certainly was
a very serious matter some years ago, but the steps
taken to combat same have been generally successful,
and the majority of growers now feel that this trouble
can be, and has been, overcome.
3. Difficulty of producing tobacco of light colour, &c.
I have shown that the production of bright leaf has
increased 100 per cent, in three years, and as in certain
cases practically the whole of the leaf has been purchased
as bright or mahogany there appears no reason why
the percentage should not further increase. Every effort
will be made in this direction.
4. Aroma. —I have dealt fully with this which is to
some extent dependent on objections 1 and 3, and tests
by the investigation committee show that 88 per cent, of
bright leaf possesses mild agreeable aroma.
In Victoria, the area under tobacco culture has greatly
increased and gradually the industry is being placed on a
definite footing. The progress will depend to a great extent
on the recommendations of this select committee, and the
following is a brief summary —based on opinions set out
earlier in this statement—of recommendations which are cal-
culated to give maximum benefits—
{«) The abolition or reduction of excise on all Aus-
tralian-grown leaf.
( b ) Appointment of investigation committee with sub-
committees in each State directing experimental
work outlined on previous page. This to provide
for definite contact and co-operation between grower
and committee on which grower to have represen-
tation.
(c) Results of investigations test and experiments and
work of committee generally to be forwarded to
each grower regularly, and expert member of sub-
committee keep in touch with growers right
throughout the season.
(d ) Marketing act, giving growers control of marketing
of own leaf and not government control.
Xote. —Pending legislation as above, bonus system be
eliminated and representative of growers and/or
Department of Agriculture in each State to accom-
pany buyer when inspecting valuing and purchas-
ing leaf at the kiln.
Other Organizations’ Methods. —-I would refer to the
system of marketing of broom fibre by the Victorian
Broom Growers Association. A valuation board com-
prising representatives of the growers and buyers and
of the Agricultural Department has been appointed
and values every grower’s crop. The growers agree not
to sell under that valuation and as a result of this,
sales have increased from £25 and £3O to £4O and £5O
per ton. Also the association makes a survey during
every growing season of area under crop and estimates
in advance the yield. It also has arrangements regard-
ing financing advances on crop and advises growers
regarding various factors affecting the industry and
also in prejiaring and baling the broom for market. The
advice given by Mr. W. L. Baillieu, recently, regarding
the position of the wool industry is of interest. Mr.
Baillieu suggested the formation of a central organiza-
tion governed by the wool-growers of the Common-
wealth, with representation by districts as well. This
organization would be charged with the complete hand-
ling, sale and finance of the Australian wool clip, also
to be the supreme authority in the direction of techni-
cal research, continuous economic survey of the industry
and selling propaganda, and to be vested with powers
to make a percentage deduction on all wool sold to
finance these activities.
Marketing. —Extract from the Minth Beport of the
Imperial Economic Committee, July, 1928, states —
PROBLEMS OF MARKETIXG.
Producers’ Organizations.
The immediate problem confronting many Empire producers
is one of marketing. In Bouth Africa the growers are orga-
nized in producers’ organizations. There is an element of
compulsion in the South African co-operative movement which
is absent from that in -Southern Rhodesia. Within the Union
when 75 per cent, of the producers in any area, together
producing at least To per cent, of any specified kind of agri-
cultural produce, are members of a co-operative society, then
that society can, in accordance with the Co-operative Societies
Act, move the Government to order that all members in
that area, whether members of the society or not, must deliver
their crop to, and sell through the society. Five of the chief
co-operative societies of tobacco growers have received such
compulsory powers. These five, with other co-operative
tobacco societies, are associated in the Central Co-operative
Tobacco Company, which regulates the prices at which leaf
must be sold to local manufacturers for the home market and
controls the selling of the whole of the surplus stock of their
members available for export. Thus, a practice of centralized
selling, combined with the co-operative practice of giving
the farmer, at the time of delivery of his crop, an advance
based on its anticipated market value, has been established.
In 1925-26, and again in 1926-27, the societies succeeded in
obtaining good prices for the growers, with the result that
there was a rapid extension of cultivation and several farmers
were led to take up tobacco as a sole and not as a rotational
crop.
Producers’ organizations can assist most powerfully in
encouraging orderly marketing. We consider, however, that
much of their most beneficial work lies in regularizing supply,
establishing grades, and stimulating demand. The long view
is especially important in the ease of tobacco, which is not a
perishable article.
Open-Selling Floors. —lf such markets were organized, we
should expect them to develop into centres from which trade
information of value to planters would be disseminated, and
at which improved methods of grading and [tacking would be
gradually evolved and standardized.
Advertising.
The work of the Empire Marketing Board, while continuing
to create a favorable “ background ” for general Empire pur-
chasing, is also developing in the direction of stimulating
demand for definite Empire products, and it seems to us that
tobacco affords a special opportunity for doing this. In the
second place, the public will demand definite information
regarding the Empire goods available in the market. It seems
to us that, in connexion with tobacco, the Empire Marketing
Board might compile, from information supplied by manu-
facturers, lists of the brands which satisfy conditions as
constituting “ Empire ” produce, and advertise the fact that
such lists are available and can be obtained on application.
Care would obviously have to be taken to make it clear that
no liability was thereby incurred in the matter of guarantee-
ing quality. That procedure would enable the consumer to
put pressure on the retailer by meeting his not infrequent
argument that supplies were not available.
Extract from summary of conclusions of British
Economic Committee—
In the last two decades there has been a rapid increase
in the production and consumption of tobacco in the world
generally.
Partly, at any rate, as the result of the customs preference
granted to Empire tobaccoes in the United Kingdom, the pro-
portion of imports of tobacco from the Empire has risen
from 3 per cent, of the total imported in 1921 to 18 per cent,
in 1927.


There has been a very great change in the smoking habits
of the people in the United Kingdom in recent times, for,
whereas in 1007 only 24 per cent, of the tobacco was smoked
in cigarettes, in 1924 that percentage has risen to 58. (Note
—-now over (10 per cent.)
The report that I have just read contains a reference to
the possibility of others being induced to take up
tobacco-growing. Yesterday a representative of the
Shepparton irrigationists telephoned asking us to
inspect large areas there suitable for tobacco culture.
Those irrigationists say that the Water Supply Com-
nission is behind them, and will assist them if it is
;onsidered advisable to extend the industry to that
listrict. They are up against the problem of market-
ing, and must get out of the fruit industry, so they
ire looking for new crops.
356. You say in your statement that the growers have
endeavoured to shoAv that suitable leaf can be grown in
Australia ? What steps have they taken to introduce a
more suitable type of leaf?— They have followed the
advice of experts as to the variety that should be
grown, and they have adopted the latest methods in
regard to kilns and curing.
357. You refer to the “comparatively recent change
in public taste demanding light tobacco.” That change
has been taking place for a considerable time?— Five
years ago the company said the agreement must relate
to due-cured tobacco to encourage the lighter types of
leaf. It is not possible for the growers to SAvitch over
from dark to light in two or three years. It means
cultivating different soil. Decently Mr. Smith and the
Investigation Committee agreed that certain steps
should be taken and the growers are uoav attempting
to adopt that course.
358. When was the notice issued by the company
limiting the quantity of dark tobacco to 10 per cent. ?
■ —-I think it Avas Avhen the neAv agreement A\ 7 as made
last year.
359. Did the company secure 800,000 lb. of dark
leaf in 1925?—1 do not know; but that was the
agreement.
360. The company states that, while it Avas prepared
to purchase 1,350,000 lb. of bright, it was only able
to secure about 250,000 lb. ?—Two years ago the whole
industry had a set-back because of blue mould. Last
year we were able to grow 60 per cent, of bright
leaf.
361. Any grower of bright tobacco has no difficulty
in selling it? —That is so. When the growers saAV that
the company wanted 800,000 lb. of dark leaf it
encouraged men on rich land to produce heavy crops,
which brought them better results than could be
obtained from bright leaf.
362, You point out in your statement that many
of the groAvers erected kilns, barns, &c., costing some
hundreds of pounds, on the recommendation of the
Government and the British-Australasiau Tobacco
Company. When did the company make that recom-
mendation?— All the agreements Avere subject to the
tobacco being flue-cured. They advanced money for
the erection of kilns.
363. You also say the growers are now informed
that the type of leaf grown on their particular plots
cannot be purchased, and they are thus being forced
out of the industry. Have many growers been so
informed?— Yes. There are 800 bales that the com-
pany has refused to buy. We admit that some of the
grading is faulty.
364. lla\ T e they not been informed that some of the
types grown are unsuitable?— Yes. There are cases
in Avhich the whole of the tobacco grown has been
refused.
365. You say, further, that if the proposals of the
association are favorably viewed by this committee,
the growers will continue to meet the changed condi-
tions. Does that mean that, if the committee does not
take a favorable view, the growers will not persevere ?
Some of them have informed the association that the
present prices really do not justify the expenditure.
We shall submit statements later in the day showing
that, in several cases, the price paid for bright leaf
last season was less than that received in the previous
year, although better methods have been adopted. I
do not wish my statement to be regarded as a threat;
but we think it will be difficult to induce other growers
to take up the industry unless our proposals are favor-
ably entertained.
366. Have new growers come in this year?— Yes. I
know one man who has given up growing broom in
favour of tobacco.
367. Do you keep in touch with the men who have
gone out of the industry?—We have done that in the
past, and we intend to continue to do so.
368. By Mr. Martens. — What proportion of the
groAvers belong to your association?—ln this district
about 80 or 90 per cent, are in the association, and we
hope to get them all in. I am told that there are five
groAvers at Shepparton avlio are quite willing to join.
Pomonal is the only other tobacco-groAving district in
Victoria, and the area under cultivation there is com-
paratiATely small. In the Ovens Yalley Ave have 1,200
acres or more under tobacco.
369. By the Chairman. —Regarding the manufacture
of Australian tobacco you say that there is an increas-
ing tendency to support home-grown products. I pre-
sume you are referring to tobacco?—To everything.
370. HaA r e you obtained any information as to the
actual public demand for the A T arious Australian brands
that ha\ T e been on the market recently?—We had infor-
mation from one shop in Melbourne Avhich sells more
“ 888 ” tobacco than any other line.
371. Your association does not consider that the
proposal to obtain a bounty from the Federal Govern-
ment is likely to assist the industry?—We prefer the
abolition of the excise duty. I think the bounty was
emphasized by the Hew South Wales Association. We
do not Avant to run counter to that body.
372. But your association definitely pins its faith
to either the abolition of or a substantial decrease in
the excise duty?— Yes.
373. That is your main proposal for putting the
industry on an economic basis?— Yes. We emphasize
that we are doing all Ave can to put a better product
on the market.
374. If the excise duty Avere abolished or substan-
tially reduced, do you think it Avould induce the com-
pany to purchase more Australian tobacco and pay
higher prices?— Yes.
375. You consider that, if a grower secured in-
creased prices he Avould groAA T larger quantities?—
Yes.
376. Has not the price of about 2s. a lb. been suffi-
cient to induce men to take up the industry?— That
is the aA'erage for all tobaccocs ; but our information is
that it is under 2s. Of course, there is the extra bonus
of 6d. under the last tariff; but that has not affected
this year’s crop.
377. You say that the increased prices wmuld
encourage new companies to begin the manufacture of
locally-grown leaf?— According to the local press, there
is a firm in Queensland that is getting in touch Avith the
growers, and such a company Avould certainly be
induced to come in if it were able to buy Australian
leaf at 2s. 4d. a lb. less than the other leaf.
378. Have not Australian manufacturers quite
recently competed with the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company—one in Victoria and one in Western
Australia?—Yes.
379. Does that not indicate that they can secure
Australian leaf at a price enabling them to make
Australian tobacco at a profit?— But these companies


must obtain the bulk of tbeir leaf from America. We
ask that a greater percentage of Australian leaf should
be used in manufacture.
380. It appears that other companies can secure
quantities of Australia leaf and put it on the market
at a price which pays them?— But the growers contend
that they are not getting the full price for their leaf.
381. Your association has no doubt that the difficulty
of finding suitable soil for tobacco culture can be over-
come in Victoria? —Yes. Certain growers can produce
60 per cent, of bright leaf.
382. Are you a tobacco grower?—l induced Mr.
Temple Smith to visit Beechworth two years ago. I
grew tobacco there on sandy ground, and unfortunately
experienced a blue mould year. Nevertheless, I hope
to show again that tobacco can be grown at Beechworth.
383. You say that the Australian tests have been
carried out with leaf that has not been aged?—Y r es.
384. What do you think would be a fair period?—
Three years, at least.
385. You say your association is considering the
advisibility of establishing a central grading depot.
Where do you suggest it should be?—ln this district.
The matter will be considered by the association.
386. Mr. Temple Smith suggested that Melbourne
would be a suitable place?—We prefer to leave the
question of grading until we consult with the whole
of the growers.
387. Does your association favour depots for each
district? —We think there should be some supervision
of grading, and we shall make a recommendation on
the matter.
388. Deferring to the experiments carried out by the
Commonwealth Government, you say; “My association
at the outset considered that this arrangement was not
in the best interests of the growers.” Is the reason for
that simply that there was no growers’ representative
on the Investigation Committee, or was the objection
a general one ?—The objection was made at least twelve
months before I took over the position of secretary.
The association considered that there should be some
co-ordination between the technical and the growing
sides of the industry. Another feature was that the
growers had given exhaustive evidence before the Tariff
Board, as the result of which the board recommended
the reduction of 6d, in the excise duty. The Govern-
ment did not adopt that recommendation; but instead
of that appointed the Investigation Committee without
asking the growers. That is where the growers think
they should have been consulted.
389. Have the growers followed up the work of the
Investigation Committee very closely?— They have not
had much information about it until a couple of months
ago, when the bulletin of Mr. Slagg was issued. We
invited him along, and assured him we were anxious
to hear what he had to say. Prior to that, I do not
know that the growers were really considered. The
committee may not have had any information to give
at that particular stage.
390. You state, as your personal opinion, that an
area should be selected from each district and worked
on the share system. That would be a form of local
experimental work? —Yes; but also associated with the
Agricultural Department, and the results would be
under the supervision of some federal committee.
391. You say also that blue mould has caused cer-
tain growers to pick leaf in an immature condition,
resulting in the loss of hundreds of pounds. Have
you collected any statements from growers bearing on
that?— Yes, I interviewed the growers personally.
I am speaking of this year.
392. Has that been done in the past?—A grower
visited yesterday, when asked why he had not picked
some of his leaf, said he knew it was unsuitable, and
he did not wish to do anything to affect the sale of
Australian leaf. Another man, who is not in a good
financial position, took the risk of sending in unsuit-
able leaf, but our association does not approve of that.
393. Is it not desirable to have some central
authority?— Yes. But the Federal Government has
no agricultural department, and we would not like to
see the State departments duplicated. We think that
the State departments should be utilized under the
supervision of the federal authorities.
394. You think the States should be masters in their
own houses ? —But if the Commonwealth is providing
£20,000 a year, it will naturally desire to indicate on
what lines the experiments shall be conducted.
395. Would it not be entitled to direct them? —It
should utilize the services of the State officers rather
than set up a new federal department. We realize that
the control is a federal matter.
396. You say that a number of growers have prac-
tically overcome the menace of blue mould, and are
no longer afraid of it?— They are not afraid of it
causing practically a total destruction of the crop, such
as occurred two years ago.
397. Does your association keep in touch with the
work of the growers on the blue mould pest ?—Yes. I
think they have been able to control it to a great extent
by obtaining their seed from other parts.
398. Have you any figures showing the losses from
year to year on account of this disease ?—Our members
could give evidence on that.
399. It would be nothing like one crop in three?—
No.
400. By Mr. Morgan. —Will you state the attitude
of your members generally regarding research work?
—They are generally in favour of it; but they think
that the policy of the present Investigation Committee
places it rather out of touch with them.
401. You think the results are not sufficient from the
scientific side?— Partly that; but we say there is not
sufficient co-operation, and there should be more inves-
tigation in the growing districts.
402. Do you say that that line of research is not
being followed? —Yes. The visitation to the field is
not sufficient.
403. Would you say the committee is not following
approved lines?— No. When the committee was
appointed the growers were not consulted. Had they
been they could have placed their views before that
body; but they had no voice in the matter.
404. Are not members of the committee going into
the growing districts and talking the matter over with
the producers ?—I do not know whether they are to any
extent. The growers can answer that for themselves.
405, Are you satisfied that the growers are following
the lead given by scientific men? —We admit that there
are exceptions, as in other industries; but, generally
speaking, they arc definitely interested.
406. Do you not think that the groovers are un-
reasonable in expecting these scientific men to make
knowledge available before they are possessed of it?
Scientific research may extend over ten or fifteen
years?—l can only say that the growers were not
informed about the committee, and consider that they
should have been consulted in regard to its personnel
and methods.
407. Do you think they should have been consulted
regarding scientific matters ? —The opinions of the
growers are surely of some value on such subjects as
root rot and blue mould.
408. You said you thought the tobacco here was
being grown on the best available soil in Australia?—
I did not intend to imply that. I said definitely that
we considered the soils in this district suitable.
409. Suppose scientific men, in the course of a few
years, told you you were growing tobacco on soil that
was unsuitable. Would you dogmatize against their


opinion?— That would be probably influenced by the
fact that 60 per cent, of the crop is a marketable
product.
‘ 410. I understand that about £BO,OOO is being
expended on this work, and something like £20,000 or
more is being constributed by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, which has no representation on the
Bommittee? —But the research is mainly into the
growing of tobacco.
411, Do you think that, in view of that large con-
tribution by the company, the growers should be given
preference in the matter of representation ?—The
growers were not asked to contribute. I take it that
they are willing to go into that matter, and if neces-
sary contribute something towards the cost of the work.
As the revenue from tobacco is £7,000,000 a year, we
think the Government could easily afford to set aside
a proportion of that for investigation work. The
association would prefer that the sum spent on research
should be contributed solely by the Government,
assisted by the growers, if necessary. The company
is contributing £20,000, but that money comes from
the growers.
412. Do you not think it comes from the consumers?
-Perhaps it does; but we think it comes from the
growers.
413. By Mr. Jones.—Does your association consider
that the advice of practical growers would be extremely
desirable in this investigation work? —Yes.
414. They were not given an opportunity to give
the result of their experiences to the committee? —I
have no personal knowledge on the matter; but I am
informed by my association that they were not con-
sulted by this committee.
415. Is it possible that some of the theories pro-
pounded by the experts might have been exploded by
practical men fwo or three years ago?—On the whole,
the result of research work lias been beneficial; but take
the question of nitrogen. In one case we had a recom-
mendation to use nitrogen, and now the idea is not
to use it. We are not blaming the committee. The
whole of the agreement is for flue-cured leaf; but
in America quite a big proportion of the tobacco is
fire-cured. Some of our tobacco is possibly suitable
for fire-curing. These are matters on which the growers
could give advice.
: 416. You say that, even at this stage, the growers
Icould probably render practical assistance to the com-
imittee ?—Undoubtedly.
417. Your association would have preferred to see
| the recommendation of the Tariff Board put into
[effect? —Yes. We still have the State Agricultural
‘Department’s research work going on. We would have
(had no objection to the committee being made a federal
[one if we had been consulted.
418. Do you say one of the reasons why the industry
is not flourishing is the uncertainty in the minds of
growers as to whether they will be able to dispose of
their crops?—ln the case of a number of growers
that is so. This year, particularly, a number have
said that they will go out of the industry because their
crops have not been purchased. In many cases a large
proportion has been left on their hands.
j 419. Last year 800 bales were not sold. What about
the balance?—To some extent that was due to faulty
grading, and in some cases the department told the
growers they were cultivating unsuitable land. We
approached the company regarding the 800 bales
refused, and they offered to send a man here to assist
with the re-grading.
420. By the Chairman.— Was that done?— Yes; but
the leaf was in such a dry condition that the matter
was held over until May. One of the members of our
committee was told by the company that there would be
no further visit to the district. It was arranged that
Mr. Lough should visit the district, and he said he
would tell us liow to re-grade some of that leaf, but a
member of our executive committee was informed that
nobody would be sent later on. Mr. Lough said he had
no objection to a member of our association going round
with him next year so that the association would be in
a position to know the actual facts.
421. By Mr. Tally. —Were you ever told that the
company had a 71 months’ supply of dark tobacco on
hand?—l am not able to say that.
422. By Mr. Jones.- —Yon say the growers do not
think they are getting a fair price? —Particularly for
the brighter leaf.
428. Is that the opinion of the association?— Yes.
We are not out to help the man with the dark leaf,
unless he is in extreme circumstances. We are out to
encourage the production of the bright tobacco.
424. lias your association been given indications as
to the results of the experiments?—We have had recom-
mendations, but practically every one of them has been
received before from the State Agricultural Depart-
ment. We do not expect Mr. Slagg to give us definite
results in the few years during which his work has
been proceeding. Circulars were sent out to growers
four or five months ago on very similar lines to Mr.
Slagg’s.
425. By Mr. Morgan. —What proportion of the
growers are producing inferior leaf?—A comparatively
small proportion. Five years ago dark leaf was not
called inferior leaf. A very small proportion of the
growers are producing immature or dark leaf. If the
product is not being graded satisfactorily it is largely
due to lack of advice on that matter.
426. Yon do not contend that the company should
buy leaf that it does not require?— But we ask that a
bigger percentage of Australian leaf be taken.
427. Has not the company been generous in the past?
—I do not think the association holds that view.
428. This year the company has purchased more
dark leaf than in the past, and therefore has been con-
siderate to the growers?—-Very few companies would
buy an article that was useless to them. The growers
did not expect such a great change over in public taste.
I do not know what were the reasons for the larger pur-
chases of dark tobacco, but the growers of that leaf
received no benefit whatever from the increase in the
duty.
429. By Mr. Jones. —lt is admitted that the company
is prepared to purchase more bright leaf than it is
able to obtain?-—-Yes.
430. Has not a difference of opinion cropped up as
to what should be classed as bright?— The growers
contend that leaf which in the past has been called
bright has been reduced in standard, and they are,
therefore, getting a lower price.
431. Are there many cases where the grower would
consider a tobacco bright and the company would think
otherwise? —Unfortunately, there is a good deal of
difference of opinion. There are many grades in
between.
432. Would not that difference of opinion suggest
variation in grading or valuation? —Yes. At the last
sale there were five or six buyers.
433. Do you approve of the appointment of a board
having equal representation of the growers and the
Government, with an independent chairman? —Ho. We
told Mr. Fenton we would favour a Federal Marketing
Board, and until that was appointed we would prefer
some action along those lines. Under the Marketing
Act the growers would be able to demand a poll as to
whether a marketing board should be inaugurated, and
if 60 per cent, voted in the affirmative the Government
would appoint such a board. We ask that the growers
should have the majority of representation. Such a
board would fix values and control the whole of the
marketing. We prefer a Federal board, but I under-


stand we should be up against a constitutional question.
The growers of broom are not allowed to sell their
product under a certain price.
434. Have you any personal knowledge of the broom
industry?-—Yes.
435. Do you think -that the same system could be
applied to tobacco as to broom?— Yes, on general prin-
ciples. There would be alterations, because broom is
not exportable. Where the broom-grower does not
receive fair value he has, in some cases, held over his
crop until next year. The association in that industry
more or less regulates the supply and demand. These
growers are definitely instructed not to increase their
acreage over a certain area. There is an embargo on
broom fibre, and the association wishes to discourage a
number of amateur growers who put an inferior article
on the market. It definitely says it is not out for high
prices.
436. By Mr. Joner. —One of the questions submitted
to the committee is whether the arrangement entered
into between the Commonwealth Government, certain
States, and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
to carry out experiments in the growing of tobacco in
Australia is in the best interests of the growers. What
is your opinion?— Our association replies in the nega-
tive. That has been our attitude from the beginning.
437. Take the next paragraph of the terms of
reference. Do you think that in the best interests cf
the growers the arrangement should be altered so as to
ensure that the federal direction of experimental work
should be made a permanent phase of the industry? —
Yes.
438. Do you suggest that the whole cost should be
borne by the Federal Government?— Yes, or by the
States.
439. By Mr. Bentley. —Regarding the suggestion that
my company has reduced its grades this year, on the
bright tobacco, I understand you to say that the opinion
of your association is that that was done to enable the
company to provide the money contributed to the
Government for investigation work?—We do not imply
anything. We made definite statements.
440. I have offered to produce account sales and
receipts from every individual grower, and in addition
to have the figures audited. Here is the actual posi-
tion. In 1928 we purchased 1,555,617 lb. of flue-cured
tobacco, of which 163,548 lb., or 10.51 per cent., was
purchased as lemon and bright mahogany, for which
we paid an average price of 2s. 7.47 d. per lb. In 1929
we purchased 1,337,262 lb., of which 266,341 lb., or
19.92 per cent., was bought and paid for as lemon and
bright mahogany, at an average price of 3s. 0.93 d. per
lb. Our purchases of lemon and bright mahogany
practically douoled in that period. Is not that ample
evidence that the company purchased it in a bona fide
way? The price in 1928 was 2s. 7fd., and it went up
in the following year to 3s. Id. Did not the increase
from 10| per cent, to 20 per cent, indicate that the
company had not done what was suggested by some
individuals ?—We say that in a great number of cases
a bigger percentage of the bright leaf was grown, but
even in 1928 the company paid less for bright than in
1927. In 1926 the company purchased 12 per cent, of
the total as bright. How you say there is 20 per cent,
bright. That is an indication that there is a bigger
percentage of the bright leaf available out of the total
crop.
441. Do you now say there is more than 20 per cent,
available and we did not purchase it?—l think that is
what we say, and what the figures we shall present
will indicate.
442. In 1923 we agreed to purchase 800,000 of dark
for the next three years. In 1926 we reduced the
quantity to 600,000 lb. I understand your association
is blaming the company for that position?— Ho. I
said it was due to the change over in public taste.
443. You say we have been too drastic recently?—•
Yes.
444. We have been continually warning the growers.
They went on growing the dark leaf so long as we were
buying it. You said you brought Mr. Temple Smith up
to the district four years ago because of the dark leaf
position. You yourself knew it four years ago?— That
is so. In making that statement I said it was one of
the difficulties that the growers had to contend with.
There was a definite demand for dark leaf five years
ago, and now there is not.
445. I have shown in my evidence that it is not due
to the action of the company? —I say it is due to the
popular demand.
446. By the Chairman. —Are the growers satisfied
with your statement that it is not the company’s fault,
but that it is due to the change in public taste ?-—That
is the main reason, but we also think that dark tobacco
could be used to a greater extent without prejudice to
the other leaf.
447. Do the majority of the growers take the view
that the company- should purchase more dark?— Hot
when it has six years’ stock on hand.
448. Would your association convey information of
that nature to the growers?— Yes. We propose to send
a copy of my statement to every grower. We do that
as a matter of policy.
449. By Mr. Bentley. —You say r that the growers
were naturally perturbed by this development in regard
to the dark tobacco, but with certain reservations they
were prepared to meet it ?—One of the reservations is
that the company should still endeavour to use a
greater percentage of the dark leaf. We have evidence
from certain smokers that they prefer an all-Australian
tobacco known as “ 888 ” to other brands. One shop-
keeper selling that line was asked why he had not
advertised it, and ho replied, “ I dare not do it.” If
Western Australia can use a bigger percentage of
Australian tobacco 1 think Victoria could.
450. By Mr. Slagg. —You said the investigation com-
mittee had not called on the growers?—My idea was
rhat the committee might have spent two or three weeks
amongst them.
451. Did you intend to convey the impression that
the tobacco is not graded in the United States of
America ?—Ho.
452. By Mr. Smith. — Was not the guarantee to take
600.000 lb. of dark leaf an inducement to the growers
to continue that type of tobacco?—-Yes.
453. They naturally expected a market for it ?—Yes.
That was in 1928, and in 1930 the quantity drops to
250.000 lb.
The witness withdrew.
Frederick Brooke Darling, tobacco-grower, Cheshunt,
President of the Victorian Tobacco-growers’ Associa-
tion was called, sworn and examined.
454. By the Chairman. —Have you a local branch of
the association ?—All the members of the association
reside in the north-eastern portion of Victoria.
455. How long have you been growing tobacco?—
Ten years.
456. Have you been flue-curing all that period?—
Yes.
457. What area have you under cultivation this year ?
—22 acres.
458. Has the area varied?— Yes, from 1 acre to 22
acres.
459. Have you increased your area each year?— Ho.
I have gone for a bigger area each year, but blue mould
has stopped that.


460. Have you had much trouble with that disease ?
—Yes, during the first four or five years. Latterly
I have had less and less, mainly because of getting
plants from free districts.
461. Have you experimented on your farm with
blue mould?— Yes, to a slight extent, mainly to evolve
a mould-resistant type. The seed grown in the Ches-
hunt district is more mould-resistant than any imported
seed or plants from any other district.
462. Is there any chance of a mould-resistant plant
being evolved in Australia?—To my mind that is a
most likely way to overcome the trouble.
463. Are you getting near it yet?—Ho, but there
is a noticeable improvement in our district in plants
grown there from local seed.
464. Have the growers derived any benefit in regard
to blue mould from the experiments conducted by the
State Tobacco Department?— Yes.
465. Have the experiments been extensive?—l do not
know, but I believe they have been carried out year
by year.
466. What benefit have you personally derived?—
Ido not know that I have benefited very much. When
I started I knew nothing about tobacco-growing, and
most of the knowledge that I have has been obtained
from other growers in the district.
467. Do you read all the literature issued from time
to time by the Victorian Government Tobacco Depart-
ment? —Ho, but I read a certain amount of it. I read
what I receive.
468. Have you written for the bulletins?—! have
written for special bulletins, but not for a continuous
supply. I always receive what I write for.
469. Do you keep in touch with the other growers
from year to year?— Yes.
470. Do the growers welcome that attention?— Yes.
471. Is there any suspicion that you are trying to
pry into their affairs?— Ho.
472. Would you give advice to a new man in the
industry ?—Y es.
473. Do the members take much interest in the
association?—A certain proportion show a very great
interest, but the majority do not.
474. Are the meetings well attended?— Ho.
475. Is that an indication that the growers are not
interested in any form of organization that does not
concern the actual growing and marketing of their
tobacco?— They are interested, but in the majority of
cases they live a considerable distance from where the
meetings are held. Most of them knock off work about
the time the meetings start. They either have no
time or are too tired to attend them.
476. Are they anxious to improve their knowledge?
—At least 75 per cent, are very keen, and they will
try everything possible to improve the quality of their
leaf.
477. Do you think there is any improvement in the
cultivation methods?— Yes.
478. Is the quality of the tobacco grown in the north-
eastern districts of Victoria improving rapidly?—lt
is subject to seasonal variation. During the past
three or four years the rate of improvement has
steadily increased as compared with previous years.
To a considerable extent this is due to the price for
brighter leaf having improved during the last six
years. Another reason is that the State Department
of Agriculture has been dinning it into us for four or
five years that we will have to improve the colour of
our leaf. Speaking for myself, the buyer of the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company has told me
that the colour will have to be improved. That has
all tended to stimulate growers in the improvement of
the leaf.
F. 218.—8
479. How does the percentage of bright leaf grown
to-day compare with five or six years ago, or when you
first look up the industry?—lt is considerably greater
than when I started. Last year I had about 60 per
cent, of bright leaf, which is the highest percentage I
have ever had.
480. Was that due to any sudden improvement in
your methods, or just luck ?—Mainly improvement in
methods, but last year was a favorable season.
481. Will the accumulated experience of the growers
tend to increase the percentage of bright leaf?— Yes.
482. Is the large percentage of dark leaf produced in
the past due to the ignorance of growers?— Ho. The
buyers have been prepared to purchase dark leaf in
past years.
483, Has the action of the company in definitely
Informing the growers that only 10 per cent, of dark
leaf will be purchased stimulated the production of
bright leaf? —It is easier to produce dark leaf, but it
is becoming more difficult to sell it, and that is why
the switch over has taken place. The growers
naturally want to produce the article that is easier to
sell.
484. Do you think we have to thank the buyers for
the improved position ?—Hot altogether. I think the
question of price is the main factor. The bright leaf
commands a better price and the growers naturally
go for it. Owing to the change over to light tobacco
the rate of progress must be slow, but as the years go
on progress will be accelerated, because there will be a
better knowledge of improved methods of production.
485. Is the change-over now well established?—l
should say it is.
486. Is there reason to justify the belief that the
desired improvement will be brought about without
any change in present methods and appliances?—!
feel that the ideal of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company is one that no other country has arrived at,
and that is a production of 90 per cent, of bright leaf.
We can undoubtedly improve the quality of our tobacco,
but I maintain that we cannot arrive at that position.
487. Hot for many years?—Hever. I asked Mr.
Slagg, and he said it would not be reasonable to ask
the growers to produce 90 per cent, of bright leaf.
488. But whatever improvement can be made can be
brought about with the existing mechanical appliances
and methods of cultivation ?—I should say not. There
may be certain areas in Victoria more suitable for
cigarette leaf than for pipe leaf, or alterations may be
necessary in the direction of the establishment of
central grading depots, but broadly speaking we are
on right lines. Ido not suggest that there is no need
for research work by competent bodies. We all realize
that that is essential.
489. Have you had any trouble with the company’s
buyers in disposing of your tobacco in recent years ?
My relations personally with the company, within the
terms of their guarantee, have alw T ays been satisfactory,
and if Here is anything on which I do not agree with
them, it is in regard to the terras of the guarantee
itself.
490. Have the buyers treated you in cavalier fashion ?
—I have had only one experience of that. It happened
in the second or third year in which I growing, and it
was my own fault.
491. Generally your relations have been satisfactory?
—Yes, subject to my qualifying remark.
492. By Mr. Martens. —ls it the general wish of
the growers to produce the type of leaf required bv
the manufacturers?— Yes. In the whole of mv
experience there has been that desire because of the
higher price obtainable. During the first few years
when I was trying to establish myself in the industry 1
was only interested in growing the leaf for which 1


could get the best price. But during the last few years
there has been a definite demand for the bright leaf
and a definite desire to produce it.
493. By the Chairman. —Has your industry proved
profitable during the ten years you have been connected
with it?— Ho. For the first three years I was well
out of pocket, and it is only in the last two or three
years that it has been payable. Even then I would
be nearly as well off if I had invested my money in
Government bonds, after allowing for myself the
ordinary wages paid to the men in my employ.
494. Do you think it is wise for you to stick to the
industry?— Yes, because I believe in its future.
495. By Mr. Jones.— Do you consider that Australia
will, within a reasonably short time, be able to grow
sufficient bright tobacco to meet its own requirements ?
—Yes, but I think it will take from fifteen to twenty
years, and encouragement of the industry will be
necessary.
496. By the Chairman. —Have you any further
evidence to submit?—l point out that although the
price paid has not been reduced the standard sample
on which the crop is bought has been raised. Leaf
that just brought 2s. a lb. in 1928, plus the bonus of 6d.,
was dropped down in 1929 to the mahogany grade.
497. You say that the buyer is raising the standard?
—lt has been slightly raised each year, but particularly
last year.
498. By Mr. Morgan. —You do not suggest that the
company should lower its standard? —Certainly not,
but raising it means a reduction in price.
499. By the Chairman. —Is there any other point?—
We have always understood dark leaf to include Ho.
1 dark mahogany, but we have an intermediate grade
called mahogany on which the company for a number
of years has paid a bonus of 3d. a lb. There has been
no trouble in selling our mahogany leaf, but when the
guarantee came up for renewal last year the original
offer was to take 10 per cent, of dark leaf for the
second and third year of the guarantee. It was sud-
denly suggested to the association that dark leaf might
include mahogany. We approached the company, and
found that that was a fact. The mahogany grade has
been encouraged definitely by a bonus and we suddenly
find that we are only allowed to grow 10 per cent, of
mahogany and dark, after having been encouraged
to grow that tobacco for a number of years under the
bonus. So far as the dark leaf is concerned, the
growers are not averse to the 10 per cent, basis, but
they claim that the mahogany leaf should not be
included in that grade. We admit we have had warn-
ing in regard to the dark leaf.
500. What percentage of mahogany do you say you
must produce?—ln an average season there would be
about 30 per cent, of that and 10 per cent, of dark.
501. The industry could not produce less than 30
per cent, of mahogany, and therefore there is an
inevitable loss to the growers?— Yes. But there is an
additional method of overcoming that difficulty and
that is the abolition of the excise duty.
502. Do you think that the Australian smoker
could be induced to use darker tobaccoes if the price
could be reduced?— Yes. A small firm in Melbourne
sells smokes of all-Australian tobacco. I tried it and
was not keen on it for the first week, but ever since
then I have smoked nothing but Australian tobacco.
503. If the dark plugs could be sold for half the
price of the bright, would it induce people to smoke
the dark? —It depends on how the tobacco smokes, and
how much mahogany leaf it contains. I maintain that
tobacco made from mahogany leaf smokes as sweetly
and has as good a flavour as that made from bright
leaf, although it has not the colour. Too much stress
is laid on colour.
504. By Mr. Slagg.— Do you recall that at the meet-
ing you mentioned which I addressed, when you asked
me regarding the lowest percentage of dark that it
might be possible to reach, that dark leaf included
mahogany and Ho. 1 dark grades?— The question was
asked whether we could much reduce on the present
percentage of mahogany in the next few years. My
impression is that you said we could reduce slightly
but not appreciably.
505. By Mr. Jones. —Is the Australian tobacco that
you have found satisfactory advertised?— Very slightly.
I started off with “ Sunday Best ”. I now smoke
“ Bronzewing ” because I think that the American leaf
is hotter to smoke than the Australian.
The witness withdrew.
Wilfrad McDonald Gardner, tobacco-grower, Milawa,
and Vice-President of the Victorian Tobacco-growers
Association, was called, sworn, and examined.
506. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?— For about five years; at first on
the share system, but for the last two years for
myself.
507. Have you had any experience of blue mould?
—Hot much; but plenty of trouble with grubs.
508. Which is the worst pest?— Grubs are one of the
worst.
509, Have you had any experience of root rot?-
With cold nights it seems to become noticeable.
510. Do you think blue mould has been a serious
factor in retarding the progress of the industry?— Ho.
About two years ago we had our worst experience with
that disease, and it affected about 20 per cent, of the
crop.
511. Do you know of any growers who have had a
worse experience than that?— Ho. The Milawa dis-
trict has one of the largest branches of the association,
and in the last two years a good many new men have
taken up the industry.
512. What area have you under crop?— About 50
acres.
513. Is that your largest area?— Yes. Last year
it was from 40 to 45 acres. We have been increasing
from year to year.
514. What would be the average area in your dis-
trict?— About 20 acres. That does not include
Ever ton, where Mr. Eugene Kneebone has about 80
acres.
515. What is your average yield?— About 8 cwt. to
the acre. Last year that w r ould be about the average for
the whole of the Horth-Eastern District.
516. Do you ever produce tobacco by the sun-drying
method?— Ho. I put up flue-curing appliances from
the start.
517. Do all the growers in your district adopt flue-
curing?—Yes.
518. What is the cost of the plant required for a
5-acre block?—£soo for a couple of kilns and a packing
shed, assuming that the grower has other agricultural
appliances.
519. That sum would not include an irrigation
plant?— Ho. If a person had to purchase a pump such
a plant would probably cost £3OO.
520. Have many of the growers installed pumping
plants?— Ho. If they were sure of a crop every year,
like wheat or oats, they would probably go in for irriga-
tion plants. This year there has been no growth owing
to the cold weather, and my experience leads me to
the opinion that it would not make much difference
whether the grower had an irrigation plant or not, if
the season were not warm enough to send the crop
along. We generally experience a hot summer in this
district.


521. You do not think the absence of irrigation
plants is causing a falling off in the quality of the
tobacco?—No, so long as the crop keeps growing with-
out check you may get a better crop without irrigation.
In a normal year growers without irrigation systems
do fairly well. Since the company has started to take
the brighter leaf the growers have felt rather doubtful.
They think they are producing a better leaf every year;
but the prices are going back, because a higher standard
of quality is set on the leaf. On the average, prices
have been decreasing compared with previous years,
having regard to the quality of the leaf. As far as I
am concerned the industry has not been a paying pro-
position,
522. Did the industry pay you on the share system ?
—I cannot say that it did. The outlay was heavy at
the start.
523. Have you all the plant you require?— Yes,
except, perhaps, that I may put in another irrigation
scheme.
524. If you have a fair run of seasons from now on
you are likely to make a profit out of the industry in
the next few years?— That is what I hope for.
525. That is the inducement to stay in it?— Yes.
526. Have you studied tobacco cultivation?— No. 1
get the Journal of the Department of Agriculture, and
I always peruse any article on tobacco.
527. Have you had material assistance from the
department?— Yes. Mr. Temple Smith has called once
or twice every year, and he has helped to put us on
the lines we are now following. Mr. Marks has also
called there.
528. If you made a request for a visit from Mr.
Smith, or another officer, would it be granted?— Yes,
promptly.
529. Have you followed the latest methods of tobacco
culture? —Yes, to the best of our ability. We have
erected barns of the most approved designs. All the
information that I have obtained about tobacco culture
has been got from Mr. Eugene Kneebone, and Mr.
McNamara.
530. Have you experimented yourself?— One experi-
ments with every kiln.
531. Do you think that you could depend largely on
your own knowledge of the industry to carry you
through ?—'Yes.
532. Is the quality of your leaf improving?—l am
sure it is.
533. What percentage of bright leaf did you get
last year?— Unfortunately I did not make a sale of
bright leaf.
534. Do you do the grading yourself ?—No. I employ
casual labour. I have to give instructions to the
employees and trust to them to carry them out.
535, Would you put three or four men whom you
pick up casually on to grading work?—l have a certain
number of hands all the year round, and I put them
on as supervisors.
536. The grading is really done by unskilled labour?
-Yes.
537. What does the buyer think of that? —Some-
times he is not too satisfied.
538. Do you think you have suffered in not making
sales and in getting reduced prices through that inferior
system of grading?— There has been a little of each.
The grading might have been better, and the buyers
might have assessed the prices higher last year; but in
other years I have always made a sale at a satisfactory
price.
539. If that goes on for a few years you think there
is a chance of your recovering your position?— Yes.
540. If you went out now what would you have
lost?— The plant is easily worth £5OO.
541. And the land?— There is no loss so far as the
land is concerned.
542. How do you know you have a suitable soil for
bright tobacco?— Only that I have seen the tobacco
grown in other places.
543. You did not get the tobacco experts down?—
The experts have never said that this country is not
suitable.
544. Do all the growers follow that method in soil
selection? —Yes. The soil on the river between Wan-
garatta and Myrtleford is practically all the same.
545. Are you in favour of a central grading shed?
—Yes.
546. In Wangaratta or Melbourne? —I do not see
that it would make a great deal of difference. Probably
Melbourne would be as good as anywhere.
547. If it were established at Wangaratta you could
have a look at your tobacco while it was being graded ?
—That is so.
548. Have you given any attention to the problem of
dark tobacco?— That is one of my reasons for being
strongly in favour of the abolition of the excise duty.
At present Australia wants to retain all the cash it
can. The sum of £3,000,000 goes out on tobacco, and
if the excise were abolished smaller manufacturers
would be encouraged to come on the market, and a
cheaper tobacco would be available to the public,
because the lower grade from mahogany down to dark
could probably all be used. It would give the smaller
manufacturers a bigger margin to work on.
549. Have the latter manufacturers looked at your
tobacco? —Not yet.
550. Have your relations with the British Australa-
sian Tobacco Company always been cordial?— Yes;
but there have been differences of opinion in regard to
prices.
551. Has the company ever refused to buy your
tobacco? —Yes. I have a parcel of 7 or 8 tons now on
hand. They are ready to buy some of it; but they
say that the rest needs re-grading. Some of it was
said to be immature, and has a green tinge in it.
552. If it had been kept twelve months it would have
been better? —Yes. It has already appreciated in
value. The Government expert looked at the tobacco
on the same day as the company’s buyer turned it down,
and he was satisfied that it was quite marketable.
553. In what respect has the leaf improved?— The
colour is better, and it has improved in aroma since
it has been stored. I am quite satisfied that 1 will
be able to sell it.
554. Do you know any other growers who have kept
their tobacco ?—Yes. In the last week about 26 tons
which growers have been storing has, I believe, been
purchased by Mr. Michelides.
555, But the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
is the mainstay of the industry?— Yes.
556. On what do you base the opinion that the
standard of grading has been raised every year ?—ln
other years the company paid what it guaranteed to
pay, and it may have paid a bit more; but now it has
come right up to the standard, because each year the
price has been di’opping although the quality is the
same.
557. Does that make any serious difference to your
returns?— Yes. I do not think the bonus principle is
quite a good idea. If the price is Is. ll|d., the
bonus is 3d.; but if the price is 25., the bonus is
Is.
558. You have no objection to the bonus?—l prefer
a straight-out market price.
559. What do you consider a fair, average payable
price?—2s. a lb.
560. If you got that for all your tobacco, you would
say that the industry would be worth while?—As a
young grower, I think it would be worth trying.


561. Have you averaged that price since you began?
—No.
562. Do you do your own curing?—l keep a general
eye on it.
563. Do you employ efficient curers or just casual
men?—l generally have about eight men permanently.
564. By Mr. Jones. —What percentage of your last
season’s crop was rejected?— About 55 per cent.
565. Is that the first time you have had any rejected?
—Yes.
566. By the Chairman. —Do you still hold that
tobacco, hoping that another buyer will come along?
—Yes, all of it. I think it has improved because of
the storage.
567. Do you suggest that, if the growers held their
product for twelve months, it would be a much better
article than when sold in practically a green state ?
Yes; but they would need something extra for holding
it.
568. Have you smoked Australian tobacco?— Over
a year ago I saw “ 888 ” bright quoted in town at
6s. 6d. a lb. I was prejudiced against it from the start.
I smoked about half a plug, and put the rest away.
About two months ago I ran out of tobacco; but found
some of the “ 888 ” that I had discarded, and then I
thought it as good as any tobacco I had ever smoked.
It had improved in quality considerably because it had
been lying in my house for about twelve months. I
should never want a better tobacco than that. Two
acquaintances of mine remarked upon the aroma of
this tobacco, and after, trying it said they liked it very
much.
569. From what you know of Australian tobacco do
you think that if it were pushed more it would be
more popular?—l think that if “ 888 ” were held for
twelve months to mature there would be a very good
market for it. Our tobacco is put on the market much
too soon, in my opinion. The company tells us it
can use as much bright tobacco as we can produce.
It also says that American tobacco has to be kept for
three years. If our tobacco is good enough to be used
in the first twelve months it should appreciate in value
if held for a considerable period.
The witness withdrew.
Henry Otto Muller, tobacco-grower, Wangaratta,
was called, sworn, and examined.
570. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco ?—About nine years. I was associated
with the industry in my younger days for a number
of years.
571. What is the average area you have been plant-
ing?— About 15 acres.
572. What is the area you have planted this year?—
About 25 acres.
573. What is the reason for the increase? —I am
cultivating lighter soil.
574. Have you any statement to make?—l am
entirely against bounties. I believe that the abolition
of the excise duty would be of great assistance to the
industry. I do not think that the present arrangement
with the British-Australasian Tobacco Company for
assistance in experimental work is in the best interests
of the growers. I consider that this work should be
entirely under federal control and finance. Although I
am in favour of research work proceeding along the
lines indicated by the association, I still believe that
price is the dominant factor that controls the industry.
At present we have only one buyer. The company has
practically a monopoly in the buying. The other firms
can be counted out. So far as I am concerned I am
entirely dissatisfied with the company’s methods of
purchasing. The reduction in price I obtained for last
year’s crop caused me a loss of between £2OO and £3OO.
By methods which. I contend were really unfair tin
company was able to place a certain quantity of my
tobacco into a class which deprived me of the extra
3d. bonus, and the extra 6d. which the last duty gave.
The abolition of the excise duty would give a fairer
field to other manufacturers, and induce them to come
into the market, I think the only solution of the
problem of extending the industry lies in competition
between manufacturers. The Victorian Tobacco-
growers Association was never consulted concerning
the appointment of the original Investigation Com-
mittee, and it was only by representations made at the
last minute that we had Mr. Temple Smith appointed
to the survey party. We were completely ignored by
Mr, Gepp. When the survey party had completed its
work w r e asked for a report, and we were refused infor-
mation. Many questions were submitted to the Federal
Investigation Committee, and before Mr. Slagg came
to our district we had read press statements to the
effect that the committee had no information to disclose
at the present time. We were left completely in the
dark concerning the investigation. We appealed for
representation, and were told that Dr. Cameron was
representing us. We were never consulted as to
whether Dr. Cameron was acceptable to us as a repre-
sentative of our association. I admit that Mr. Slagg
came to our district and gave us indications of what
was going on; but from the start the work of this
Investigation Committee has been simple in character.
Its experiments for the last two years have all been
carried out before by the State experts in Victoria,
and all this could have been taken for granted instead
of going into elementary tests concerning soils and
the application of manures. I believe that, if the
Investigation Committee had consulted the growers’
associations, this would have been pointed out and
a considerable saving of money would have been made.
On his first visit to this district, Mr. Slagg was asked
whether he would investigate the economic position.
He shied off that question as much as possible. At the
outset it became apparent to the growers that the com-
mittee w r as really blocking the extension of the industry,
which we, as an association, desired to foster. It was
really placing the industry on the shelf for three years
at the beginning, and then for an extra three
years pending investigation. We regard that as
being a block. It would have been better, in my
opinion, to have made a grant to the State depart-
ments for research work instead of establishing
this investigation committee. I believe that the
industry would then have gone further ahead, if we
had been granted Australian parity for our tobacco.
Although the government of the day is out to give us
a better price, I contend that we are not getting the
benefit of even the 3s. a lb. protection. If we got
Australian parity it would considerably assist to extend
the industry into the lighter soils. It is absolutely
necessary for us to get a better price. I am not in
any way reflecting on Mr. Slagg; our association has
passed a vote of confidence in him. I am reflecting,
however, upon the methods by which the investigation
has been conducted from the commencement to the
present day. If it is the desire of the Government to
extend the period of the committee’s appointment, I
favour federal control entirely, dissociated from any
manufacturer, or even the Growers Association; but
federal control in co-operation with the States. The
abolition of the excise duty would enable us to get
more manufacturers competing for our leaf, and, if
necessary, there could be a further impost on the
foreign article.
575. You do not see any merit in the suggestion
that there should be a federal bounty instead of a
reduction in the excise? —No. I think bounties are


merely temporary, and influenced by financial circum-
stances. The tariff is more lasting in its effect, and
it is the means by which other Australian industries
have been assisted.
576. Tobacco is almost a daily necessity, like meat
and drink, to many people. If there is anything in
the suggestion that Australian tobacco has objection-
able characteristics, it would be a serious matter for
the Government to force upon smokers an article that
was unacceptable to them ? —There may be a percentage
of undesirable Australian leaf; but I have yet to learn
that our tobacco generally is bad. Growers themselves
have made reasonably good smokes up, under crude
conditions, out of the tobacco cured in the same
season. Tobaccoes containing 100 per cent, of Aus-
tralian leaf are manufactured, and others contain
50 per cent, of the local product. I think everything
depends on the treatment that our tobacco gets in the
factories. It has not been given a show until recently.
577. How do you know that? —I have seen it in the
factories. Every effort has been made by a consider-
able proportion of the growers to produce the lighter
tobacco required. It is probably because of the advice
given by Mr. Temple Smith years ago, and his per-
sistent reminders ever since, that we are now growing
the light tobaccoes.
578. Have you had any of your product rejected by
the company?— Hot rejected; but reduced in grade,
and that automatically lowers the price. The lowering
of the price by |d. a lb. deprives me of 9d. a lb.
That is the pernicious effect of the bonus, which has
not been regarded as part of the price until recently,
and I contend the bonus system is unfair in principle
and unjust in practice.
579. Do you expect the grower to be able to put the
price ticket on his tobacco?—Ho, but if we had other
competing buyers we would have the option of insisting
on our grading. In most years I have been entirely
dissatisfied to the extent of Id. or 2d. per lb., but this
year to the extent of from sd. to 6d. per lb.
580. Why is your grading better than that of the
buyers? —Many growers of long standing in my dis-
trict have compared my samples of previous years with
the present year’s crop.
581. What independent authority could you suggest
to determine the standard grade?—A Commonwealth
tobacco leaf expert who would fix the samples for the
season.
582. Would a central grading depot get over the
difficulty?—l think it would help. We w T ant the excise
duty abolished and competing buyers.
583. Do you think the growers would accept the
decision of an independent authority?— Yes.
584. You say the growers have no confidence in the
Investigation Committee ?—The association was entirely
ignored, and it came to the decision that the committee
was blocking the industry, the economic position of
which concerns us most vitally. If we are to produce
the bright tobaccoes cultivation must necessarily extend
to the lighter soils. If the Government wishes us to
have protection to the extent of 3s, a lb., we should
have some legislation to enable us to secure that pro-
tection.
585. You also allege that the work of the committee
has been conducted in secret?— That is so.
586. Surely the growers have no objection to scien-
tific investigation?— Hot at all.
587. What good would a growers’ representative be
on that committee?—He could have advised the com-
mittee that its preliminary investigation as to soils and
the use of fertilizers had been carried out many years
ago in the tobacco-growing districts. That would have
enabled the committee to deal with matters more vital
to the industry.
588. What do you suggest should have been done? —
The money could have been spent in extending experi-
mental plots in other parts of Australia.
589. Do you say the results have not justified the
expenditure ?—Yes.
590, Do you know what the results are? —They are
very slight.
591. Have you read Mr. Slagg’s bulletin, Ho. 2,
which was issued late last year ? Did you get a copy of
it?—Ho, but I have seen a summary of it in the press.
592. Mr. Slagg has only been in Australia two years.
He has had to get in touch with the growing areas,
collate all the data, and issue it in pamphlet form.
Do you think that is insufficient in the time? —Yes, In
the meantime the industry has been crying out for
assistance. The complaints of the growers should he
dealt with.
593. Do you mean that the investigation has gone
on ahead of any preliminary protection to the industry?
—Exactly.
594. You have no objection to the investigation?—
So far as its work has gone I do not expect much from
it.
595-6. Do you know of many growers in the district
who have had any trouble in disposing of their leaf?
—Yes, there are several this year. The reason given
was that the tobacco was dark and poorly graded. The
grading has been one of the arguments of the buyers all
along.
597. Is it not a natural tendency for a grower to
put his product into a higher class than that to which
it belongs?— Odd growers may do that,
598. Have you had instructions in grading from the
State expert?— Yes.
599. I suppose it is on that instruction that you base
your knowledge of grading?— Yes, and the advice given
by the buyers. In one year the buyer tells a grower
his leaf is just what is wanted, and in another year
another buyer from the same company will say it is
not the sort of leaf required. Thus there are varying
standards in different years.
600. By Mr. Morgan. —lf you do not get the results
you expect from scientific research in two or three
years, is that any reason for stopping that research? —
Hot at all, but the late Prime Minister said he would
not do anything to help the industry because the matter
was under the consideration of the Investigation Com-
mittee. That is why we objected to the industry being
blockaded for a number of years.
601. Are you not inclined to confuse the economic
position with the scientific side?— Ho. The farmers
are naturally concerned chiefly with the economic posi-
tion of their industry.
602. My point is that the two aspects should be
kept separate?— But the Investigation Committee
should inquire into the economic position as well.
Thousands of growers would gladly go into the lighter
areas to produce the leaf that is demanded if they
could get the benefit of the present tariff.
603. Then you have no faith in scientific research?
—I welcome any research so long as the economic posi-
tion is not overlooked.
604. Do you seriously suggest that the research work
constituted an obstacle to the progress of the industry?
—lt appears so.
605. By Mr. Jones. —Your contention is that, if the
growers had been consulted, scientific research into the
tobacco industry would have been much more advanced
than it is to-day ?—Yes. We could have suggested
acceptance of the results obtained by estimable men
like Mr. Temple Smith.
606. I understand that leaf which you regard this
year as better than a similar grade produced in pre-
vious years has been placed in another class?—l will
not say better, but equal in quality.


607. If leaf worth 2s. a lb. brought only Is. lid., the
grower would be losing 9d. a lb.? —That is so.
608. The buyer fixes the price and the price regulates
the bonus?-—That is so.
609. A reduction in price of less than Id. a lb. might
mean the difference between ruin and success?— That
is so.
610. By Mr. Slagg. —What do you mean by the
expression “ Australian parity ” ?-—The cost of
American leaf landed in Australia, plus import duty.
611. Can you tell me Avhat information is available
concerning soils? —There is information as to the use
of nitrogen in the tobacco-growing soils in Victoria
and the different quantities of superphosphates that
have been proved to be beneficial.
612. Can you be more specific?—l am not an expert,
but I know that the preliminary experiments carried
out could have been accepted by you.
The witness withdreiv.
Arthur Ernest Rae, tobacco-grow T er, Gapsted. was
called, sAvorn and examined.
613. By the Chairman. — Hoav long have you been
growing tobacco ?—About 40 years.
614. When did you begin flue-curing?—T think it
was 1916.
615. You must have been one of the first?—l think
I was one of the first in Victoria to adopt that method.
616. Have you been increasing your area under cul-
tivation ?—Lately we have been trying to plant from 20
to 25 acres.
617. Some growers go in for 80 acres. Is that wise?
—Personally I like to keep close supervision over the
tobacco I grow.
618. Do you employ much labour?— Four or five
men at certain seasons of the year.
619. Do you do your oavu curing?— Yes.
620. Do you have much trouble in getting a certain
percentage of bright tobacco? —Ho, Ave have about 50
per cent, of mahogany and dark.
621. What percentage of that would be really dark?
—About 20 per cent.
622. If your mahogany leaf Avere included as dark
you would lose about 40 per cent, of your crop?— Yes.
Last year the company took the mahogany but left
part of the dark, about 1 ton in 10, on our hands.
623. Are you satisfied Avith that ?—Ho.
624. What did you do with the tobacco left o\ T er? —
We have just sold it; after holding it since October.
625, Did you notice any improvement in the leaf
because of holding it ?—Three bales that we did not
ask the buyer to take shorved a green tinge, but when
we opened it recently there Avas no green in it, and
the buyer w r as quite agreeable to taking it Avith the
rest.
626. So you think the storage improA 7 es the colour
and aroma ?—I am certain of it.
627. Have you anything further to say?—lt is my
opinion that if the excise Avere abolished we should
soon find an outlet for our dark tobacco, but unless avc
do that we shall have to go out of the industry.
628. Where will you find the outlet?—lf a cheaper
smoke is put on the market many people will buy it,
and eventually the manufacturers will go in for that
grade. Mr. Michelides remarked to me, “ Don’t
throw any aAvay; I have a brand for eA 7 ery grade ”.
If a young smoker began on Australian leaf, I think
he would acquire a taste for it.
629. I suppose you know most of the groAvers. Have
you known many men to go out of the industry?— They
come and go.
630. Why is that?— Because of the price.
681. Is it not because tobacco-growing is an arduous
business requiring skilled labour and close personal
supervision? —Yes, you w T ant a packet of aspros when
you start. When you work day and night and find
prices going down it is very irksome.
632. What do you consider a fair price?— Most of
us w T ould be satisfied with 2s. a lb. all through.
633. Have they not been getting that? —Speaking
for Rae Brothers lam certain we have not. In 1919
our top price Avas 2s. 6d.; in 1920 we got up to 35.;
and in 1929 Ave obtained 3s. 3d., including Is. bonus for
six bales. In 1921 Ave greAv 4,000 lb., for which the
average price received was 2s. 4d., and in 1922 the
average was 2s. Ifd., while the Income Tax Department
received £9O from us. Since then our .average prices
have been as follow: —1923, 2s. 2d.; 1924, Is. 9|d.;
1925, Is. 10|d.; 1926, Is. 7d.; 1927,' Is. 10fd.; 1928,
Is. B^d.; 1929, Is. 9|d. Last year there was 1 ton
rejected, wdiich would have loAvered the average, but
we never had better tobacco than in that year. Ten
years ago four grades Avere the limit, but now, accord-
ing to the account sales, there are eight grades, and the
lower grades are rejected. We do not get higher
prices, although the grades have improved.
634. What was your percentage of bright leaf last
year ?—About 60 per cent.
635. What was your average price for it?— The top
price Avas 3s. 3d., including Is. bonus a lb. for about
12 cwd. All the rest was under 25., and therefore W’e
only a bonus of 3d.
636. Do you do your own grading? —Yes.
637. Do you disagree with the buyer as to the grad-
ing ? —Certainly.
638. You think your judgment better than his?—l
think I know as much.
639. Does the buyer ever put your leaf in a higher
grade than you expect?— The late Mr. Gilmore has
done that.
640. Have you any suggestion to offer as to how
the difficulty could be OA 7 ercome? —Only by abolishing
the excise duty and perhaps encouraging more factories
to start.
641. What do you say to a Federal expert fixing the
standard each year, the groAvers to Avork to those
standards and the buyer to conform to them?— There
could be no luav t to compel anybody to buy the tobacco.
642. Would you abolish the excise or reduce it?—l
ibink it should be abolished.
642 a. The Commomvealth Avould lose a good deal of
nwenue. If there is an increase in the consumption
of Australian tobacco there will be a reduction in the
imported leaf, and the country Avill lose both ways?—
But Australia Avould gain something from the increased
population. Some smokers would always prefer
American tobacco, no matter what the price.
643. HaA T e you considered that if Ave abolished the
excise duty the loss of revenue AA 7 ould put us in a bad
way ?—But the Railway Department took £25 in freight
on tobacco in one year from us alone,
644. Do you believe in the bonus system? —l would
sooner have a straight-out price. In 1920 AA’e received
3s. a lb. Avithout the bonus, and last year Ave got 3s, 3d.,
including the bonus.
645. By Mr. Morgan. — Yesterday I saw about a
dozen ucaa’ barns between Myrtleford and Wangaratta.
They Avere on typical farms near the road. Do you
think that shows confidence in the industry?— The
only ucav barn I knoAv of Avas built to replace one that
was burnt down last year.
646. By Mr. Martens. — The assumption is that when
a groAver builds a barn he believes he can make a
success of the industry?— That is so.
647. By the Chairman. — You would be satisfied if
you could average 2s. a lb. ?—I base that figure on past
crops. If we are to increase our percentage of bright


tobacco Ave shall certainly want more than an average
of 2s. At present if we had 50 per cent, dark and
50 per cent, bright, including our No. 2 grade, 2s. a
lb. might pay us, but if we increased the quantity of
bright tobacco to 80 per cent, and still received an
average of 2s. a lb., it would not be worth while staying
in the industry.
The witness withdrew .
James Rees, tobacco-grower, Moyhu, was called, sAvorn
and examined.
648. By the Chairman. —How long have you been a
grower ?—I started about nine years ago, but only
grew two crops. I Avas successful the first year. I
was the first groAver at Moyhu to flue-cure tobacco.
We have not so many growers there noAV as there were
three or four years ago. Several have dropped out
because they could not make sufficient money out of the
industry. Some of them were unsuccessful, possibly,
owing to the adoption of wrong methods. Last year
I returned to the industry, and with two share-farmers
greAv about 7 acres. The crop was exceptionally good.
We obtained about 4 tons of tobacco, excluding f of a
ton lost through fire. This year we have increased the
area to 22 acres. I was quite inexperienced in flue-
curing when I started, but I obtained all the informa-
tion I could from Mr. Temple Smith, and was fairly
successful. I received 2s. 3d. a lb. for one crop and
2s. 6d. for the other. There Avere no grades then. The
blue mould struck me badly, and in about three years I
was bankrupt.
649. Have you had any blue mould in the last two
years?— No. I returned to the industry Avhen I found
that success was possible by obtaining seedling plants
from other districts.
650, Is that the general method noAV? —Yes. In
my opinion it is the only Avay to combat the disease.
651. Have you seen any sign of it this year?— No.
652. Hoav about the percentage of dark and light
tobacco?— Last year we were fairly successful with our
curing. Had it not been for the fire we experienced in
the middle of the drying season, when we lost our
best kiln, we would have had from 50 to 55 per cent,
of bright mahogany and lemon-coloUred tobacco. Our
average price Avas about 2s. a lb., including the bonus.
652 a. Did that pay you?— No.
653. But one grower might have dear land or might
have gone in for irrigation and expensive sheds, and
he would require a bigger return ?—-That is so.
654. What plant have you?—l have a Nunan spray
irrigation plant. If a grower wishes to be sure of a
crop he must have some way of irrigating the crop.
It is possible to groAV a crop successfully almost any
year without irrigation, but an irrigation plant is
desirable on some of the land. My plant consists of
about 20 chains of main pipe, and about 10 chains of
spraying pipe. Including the pump and engine, it
would be worth about £5OO.
655. You Avould have to make a good deal more out
of your , tobacco in one year than another grower who
did not go in for irrigation ?—Yes, if the plant was
used only for irrigating tobacco. It would not be fait
to make such-a plant an. overhead charge on tobacco
only. It is a general asset. . A .
656. Did you do your oavu grading?-—The men who
were growing the tobacco did that. This year I shall
do my OAyn grading under the management of my son.
I can observe a general improvement in the methods of
cultivation and treatment as compared with nine years
ago.
657. Do you think most of the growers are pro
gressive?—Yes. Those who are not are being
eliminated, because the industry is unremunerative to
the unprogressive grower.
658. Have you had any dispute about the grading
of your leaf?—We w r ere fairly successful in disposing
of our crop last year. A small quantity was held over,
but was sold recently. On examining it we found that
it had considerably improved in colour through being
packed doAvn. It would also have improved in aroma.
659. Are you a judge of aroma?—As good a judge
as any ordinary man. My son has made samples of
tobacco in his own Avay, and men about the town have
tried it and spoken highly of it.
660. What do you think of the prospects of the
industry?— With proper Government support it should
flourish.
661. Could the growers possibly produce up to 60
per cent, bright tobacco?— Yes.
662. What percentage of mahogany will they get ?
About 30 per cent., or perhaps only 20 per cent. They
might only get 50 per cent, of bright, but if they got
good prices for the bright and the mahogany they could
well afford to dispose of the dark leaf and the tobacco
that is regarded as unsuitable for manufacture,
eliminating it from consumption as tobacco.
663. Could they afford to burn their dark tobacco?
—Yes, if they recei\ T ed for the other grades the prices
that they should, and, I think, could get.
664. But they could not carry the dark and the
mahogany leaf, too ?—No, that would be too much.
665. It is possible for the growers to rub along on
50 per cent, of bright tobacco?— Yes.
666. Have you formed any opinion as to the best
way to improve the economic position of the industry
in regard to marketing?— Yes, I am entirely in accord
with the statement made by our secretary this morning.
I think that the abolition for a time of the excise duty
on the locally-groAvn leaf is very necessary. Possibly
after three or five years, when the industry should have
become established, a light excise duty could be imposed,
on an increasing scale, as the industry became better
established. Nothing would tend to improve the posi-
tion so much as the abolition of the excise, because it
would encourage the purchase of local leaf and put
it on the market at a lower price.
667. Do you think Australian smokers would buy it
simply because it was cheap, irrespective of aroma or
burning qualities?— Yes. With all due respect to the
experts, I consider pure Australian tobacco to be as
smokable as the imported leaf.
668. Do you think that the bright Australian leaf
is suitable for cigarettes ?—The very bright leaf
could be used for that purpose,
669. Are the growers likely to continue to improve
the quality of their product?— Yes.
670. Do you need more buyers?— Yes. That would
be of great benefit.
671. There might be honorable understandings
among them?— Home method of supervision is essential.
There should be some standard set by the Federal
Government, and some form of market control.
672. You know that the Federal Parliament has no
power to legislate in a w r ay that would influence the
market?—-That is so; but that does not mean that it
will never have those powers.
- 673, Do ■ you favour any form of State marketing
control?— Yes. That might assist; but I think it
would be preferable for the Federal Government to
retain the marketing control for the sake of uniformity.
674. Have you followed the work of the Investiga-
tion Committee?—No, except last year, when I
became a member of the association.


675. Have you read Mr. Slagg’s bulletin No. 2?—
676. Are you prepared to await further experimental
work before arriving at any conclusion as to whether
that work will be of lasting value?—l fully expect
that the work of Mr. Slagg will be of much use to
the growers; but I would have preferred to see some
of the experiments carried out in the Ovens and King
Rivers’ districts, Avhich are looked upon as the home
of tobacco-growing. I feel that these experiments
should have been carried out on the farms, under the
close supervision and with the co-operation of our most
experienced growers.
677. Do you think the growers should carry out the
experiments themselves ?—They could do so; but
experiments conducted by the Government would be
more likely to be successful if carried out in co-opera-
tion with the growers.
678. Would the growers bother to take part in that
work?— Yes, if approached in the proper way.
679. Is not the average grower so concerned about
making ends meet that he is quite indifferent about
the national aspect of the industry?— No. He could
be paid for any assistance given by him in connexion
with the experiments.
680. What is your opinion as to a central grading-
depot?—We have discussed the matter in the associa-
tion; but have not yet reached any definite conclusion.
Personally, I should prefer the depot to be located at
Wangaratta.
681. Have you formulated any practicable scheme to
overcome the difficulty regarding prices?— That diffi-
culty will always obtain. At present there is no inter-
mediary between the grower and the manufacturer.
Some definite standard should be fixed by a third party,
say a government man.
682. Would it be fair for a government official to
come in and tell the buyer what he should pay?—lt
does not sound altogether fair; but, when there is no
competition, it is just as fair as the buyer saying to
the grower, “ This is our price; if you do not take
it that is the end of it.”
683. What if the buyer refuses to take leaf under
those conditions ?—lt is up to the Government to make
the conditions such that, if the leaf is worthy of con-
sumption, it is worth his while to buy it.
684. Suppose the Government adjusted the condi-
tions so that the company decided to go in for a much
larger percentage of Australian leaf, and then people
refused to smoke the tobacco?—l do not think that
is possible.
685. The company has gone out of its way to manu-
facture tobaccoes containing 50 per cent., and even
100 per cent., of Australian leaf; but the popular
demand is not sufficient to justify the company in
putting those brands on the market?—ln my opinion,
all Australian tobaccoes receive practically no publicity.
They are never encouraged by any of the retailers.
686. Mr, Bentley said the company advertised
“ Signet ”; but the sales fell off despite the publicity ?
—I have never seen a card relating to “ Signet.”
687. Do you know “Waratah”?—Only by repute.
688. Have you ever heard of “ 888 ” ?—Only in the
last couple of months.
689. Are there any Australian brands with which you
are familiar?—“ Sunday Best” had a good run for a
time; but the best qualities of leaf were not con-
tinuously used in its manufacture, I have smoked
that tobacco in cigarettes. I was quite satisfied with
its smoking qualities when it was first put on the
market.
690, Do you know anybody who smokes all-
Australian tobacco?-—Mr. Darling, the president of our
association, has told you that he smokes it. I have
heard very few disparaging remarks about “ Sunday
Best.”
691, Is “Bronzewing” still on the market? —Yes.
692. Do you think a 100 per cent. Australian cigar-
ette made from the bright tobacco would be in demand ?
—I have smoked a cigarette made from the crude
tobacco, as it is done up by ourselves, and there is
nothing very objectionable about it. I am referring
to tobacco that has not been aged in any way. One
of the growers has smoked it continuously.
693. By Mr. Jones. —Has your association ever con-
sidered a co-operative scheme subsidized by the Govern-
ment similar to that operating among the fruit-growers
at Shepparton?—The members may have discussed
it individually, but we have never considered it as an
association. It is desirable to encourage young men
to take up tobacco-growing on the share-farming
system. Invariably they are not very financial, and
it is a good way of obtaining reliable labour, because
a man who is sufficiently enthusiastic to take up share
farming is generally a worker. They have to wait
twelve or fifteen months before they get any return
for their labour. If the Government or some other
body could see its way to finance young men of this
description they could grow tobacco successfully under
the supervision of experienced growers, and thereby
extend the industry.
The witness withdrew.
Eugene Kneebone, tobacco-grower and grazier, Ever-
ton, was called, sworn, and examined.
694. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?—! started when I was about fifteen
or sixteen years of age and stopped when I was about
33. I have been at the industry again for the last
eleven years, making about 28 years altogether.
695. Then you have had experience of both flue-
curing and air-curing?— Yes. I have been a smoker
practically all my life, and I am sure there has been a
vast improvement in the quality of Australian leaf
since the introduction of flue-curing.
696. How do you judge smoking aroma? —By the
smell when I draw it in. I have had smokes of flue-
cured tobacco even before its manufacture, and leaf
that I had aged for about two years seemed as good as
any tobacco I had ever smoked.
697. What area have you under crop this year?—
Abour 75 acres.
698. Is that your largest area?—No; last year we
had about 80 acres.
699. What was your smallest?— Eleven years ago
we only grew about IT|- acres.
700. What is the idea of going in for a larger area
than the average grower?—l have a good many sons.
I like to have them home, and they have been engaged
in the industry.
701. Do they like the work?—l presume so.
702. What sort of plant have you?—We have an
irrigation plant that cost about £650, and we have
seven curing barns.
703. Have you made a profit out of the industry?—
There may be one or two industries that would have
been more profitable.
704. A statement appeared in the press that you
received a cheque for £6,000 for one year’s crop of
tobacco %—I read that in the newspaper, and two
or three weeks afterwards the registered letter con-
taining the cheque reached me. The statement in the


press was to the effect that I had shown that cheque to
a certain gentleman, although I had not then received
it.
705. You have not lost anything through flue-curing?
—Presumably so. I might have done better at some-
thing else.
706. What did your crop average last year?—ln-
cluding the 6d. a lb. paid by the company on account
of the increase in the tariff I received an average of
about 3s. 4d. for 15 bales, 3s. Id. for 115 bales, 2s. Id.
for 45 bales, and od. for about 20 bales.
707. Do you find the average price to be about the
same as in previous years?—l have told the buyer that
the price has been slipping back all the time. In 1926,
when I had only 45 bales of bright mahogany and 11
bales of lemon-coloured, or 56 out of a total of 211,
my price for the 45 bales was 2s. sd. with 3d. bonus,
making a total of 2s. Bd. In 1929 I had 235 bales, in-
cluding 115 bales of bright mahogany, the basic price
of which was 2s. Id. plus a bonus of 6d., making a
total of 2s. 7d. That represented a loss of Id. per lb.
as compared with the previous price quoted, although
the crop was over 200 per cent, better than in 1926.
The same men graded the two crops, and the buyer
found no fault with the grading; in fact, he com-
plimented us. The buyer was the same in each case.
708. What is your opinion about the bonus? —I have
often wondered what it is for.
709, Is it not to encourage you to produce leaf of a
better quality ?—lnstead of 2s. a lb. and a bonus of 3d.,
a straight-out price of 2s. 3d. would be more acceptable,
and easier to understand.
710. What was your percentage of bright mahogany
last year ?—Between 50 and 60 per cent.
711. Could you average that percentage every year ?
—Under proper conditions, yes. The members of the
Select Committee on their tour through the district
yesterday noticed a curing barn that is commonly seen
in our district. It w r as 16 feet square, and had a small
square ventilator on top. In the last seven or eight
years I have closely studied the process of flue-curing.
If you filled a 16-ft. barn witfl green tobacco, the weight
of the green leaf would be 9,100 lb., and when cured
about eight days later the weight would be 1,300 lb.,
so the loss of weight through evaporation would amount
to 7,800 lb. When you consider that from 85 to 90
per cent, of that moisture has to pass out of the top
ventilator hi about the first three days, you can easily
imagine that a grower with such a barn could not make
a success of his curing, because the ventilator is so
small that a pigeon could hardly crawl through it, I
have seen the tobacco after it has been treated in barns
inadequately ventilated and have found the leaf spongy
and sweated. I maintain that this fault is responsible
for most of the dissatisfaction between the buyer and
the grower. The heat is kept in, and instead of the
moisture escaping it spreads amongst the leaves. The
ventilator should be, perhaps twenty times larger than
it is. There is too much cold air coming in at the
bottom, and this condenses and makes the conditions
still worse. That is enough to practically ruin the
tobacco.
712. Have you brought that matter under the notice
of your association? —Yes. I have spoken about it
until I have almost been afraid of being regarded as a
nuisance. I have proved to growers that the use of
the large ventilator advocated by me is desirable.
713. Have you brought this phase of flue-curing
under the notice of the Victorian tobacco expert?—l
have had many friendly discussions with him on the
matter.
714. That shows there are possibilities regarding
improved methods of curing which should have a great
effect on the future of the industry?— Yes,
715. In view of its present economic position, do
you think the industry is likely to improve if the
growers stick to it?— Yes, I have great hopes that it
will.
716. Have you had cause to regret going in for
tobacco?— Once a year the buyer and myself have a
heart-to-heart talk over it. I have to accept what is
offering and hope for something better.
717. Are you reasonably satisfied with your results?
—Yes, except one sale last year. For a grade that
four years ago returned me Is. 9d. a lb. and 3d. bonus
I only received 9d. a lb. last year. I am not satisfied
with that.
718. Are you in favour of the abolition of the excise
duty?— Yes.
719. Do you express any opinion concerning a bounty
instead of an alteration in the excise? —Ho. When I
was before the Tariff Board some time ago I said I
was not in favour of a bounty, and I have not altered
my opinion since. I think that a struggling industry
like that of tobacco-growing should not carry the
present impost. Other industries, such as sugar and
banana-growing, that are not as precarious as tobacco-
growing, do not carry such an impost.
720. Do you think an average price of 2s. a lb. for
bright leaf Avould be sufficient to keep the growers in
the industry? —Ho. I would not stay in it for a minute
at that price.
721. Is that because you have spent so much capital
in plant?— Ho. I am aiming to produce tobacco that
will be worth between 3s. and 4s. a lb. If I could not
grow leaf worth more than 2s. on the average I would
not ask the company to buy it.
722. Would 3s. a lb. give you sufficient profit?— You
would not want an average price of 3s. including the
dark tobacco.
723. What do you think of the Federal Investigation
Committee?—l have had no assistance from it.
724. Are you prepared to wait until it has had time
to complete its investigations before you ask for ade-
quate protection?— Ho. I think that the growers
should be properly encouraged, and then they would
overcome their difficulties themselves.
725. Has there been a noticeable improvement in the
quality of the leaf from year to year?— Yes. I have
seen young fellows working at the kilns practically in
rags. They have put their whole heart and soul into
the work with the object of getting their tobacco
sufficiently light in colour.
726. Does the industry appeal strongly to the young
men on the farms?— They seem to take a remarkable
interest in it. I have had numerous letters from fine
types of young men begging me to take them on and
teach them tobacco-growing. I have taught several
already. They put in eighteen months with me, and
now they are growing tobacco on their own account.
1 have several men working with my sons, and they
want to go into the industry on the share system, but
I have had to refuse scores of such offers because I
have no room.
727. By Mr. Jones. —What do you regard as the pros-
pects of Australia in the near future in meeting its own
requirements in the matter of bright leaf?— With
proper encouragement we could grow our own tobacco,
and in ten or fifteen years smokers should be able to
get their tobacco for half the price they are now
paying.
728. By the Chairman.— Have you anything further
to say?—We see many statement regarding blue mould
by men who pose as experts. I do not agree with them
that this disease is as serious in Australia as they would
have us believe. Six years ago I started to raise my
own seedlings. In 1925 I grew 14 tons of tobacco; in
1926, 25f tons; in 1927, tons; in 1928, 23f tons; in
1929, 26 tons; and this year I estimate that the crop


will amount to 22 tons. That does not look as though
blue mould is a very terrible disease. This year we
sent to another district for our plants, but previously
we grew our own.
729, By Mr. Jones. —Have you experienced any
season when the crop was free from blue mould?—l
have seen signs of the disease every year, more or less.
Some of the experts claim that blue mould is seed
borne, hut I exploded that theory 40 years ago. We
had a bottle of seed from which we obtained plants
nine years in succession. Some of the beds of seedlings
showed no sign of blue mould, and a good crop was
obtained, but in the following year beds planted with
the same seed would be destroyed by the disease.
730. Is that an argument to show that the growers
could have been of assistance to the Investigation Com-
mittee?—l do not say that, but I am giving my prac-
tical experience.
The -witness withdrew .
John Smith, tobacco-grower, Myrtleford, ex-President
of the Victorian Tobacco Growers Association, was
called, sworn and examined.
731. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco? —40 years.
732. What areas do you cultivate?—We have tried
it all ways, and have come to the conclusion that the
larger the area the better you can deal with the crop.
733. What is your area this year?— About 60 acres.
734. Can you obtain the necessary skilled labour?—
We generally have the same team on every year.
735. Then you require a fairly expensive plant?—
Tobacco-growing is one of the most expensive indus-
tries.
736. What is the cost of starting on a 20-acre block?
—lt is considered that there should be one barn for
every 6 acres, and a barn costs from £lOO to £l5O. I
think an irrigation plant is essential, and this costs
about £6OO.
737. It would probably require a capital of £2,000?
—Yes.
738. Would an average of 2s. a lb. pay the grower?
—Ho. Hobody in this room can point to a man who
has made a lot of money out of tobacco. I have paid
over £3OO for plants alone, and I did not get a return
for fifteen months. We were paying out £7O a week
for labour during the curing period, extending over a
period of about three months.
739. Would the returns be sufficient on the last
prices you received?—We received 3s. 6d. for the best
tobacco and 3s. for the rest. Eor 50 bales we got
3s. 6d., and that put a different complexion on the
industry.
740. Allowing for the cost of operations, seasonal
difficulties and the prices you received have you been
satisfied with the industry?—We have made no money
out of it. We may have just cleared our way.
741. But you have not lost anything?-—I would not
say that.
742. Do you keep a profit and loss account?— Yes.
Last year our returns were about equal to those from
maize, although the maize was produced for about
one-third of the cost.
743. Some of the growers have left the industry
and returned to it?—A few of the young immigrants
who have gone in for tobacco-growing will receive a
set-back. A “ little brother,” who left my place with
£BO, lost the whole of it in growing tobacco this year.
744. Do you agree with the excise duty ?—Ho, it
is an unfair impost. The industry should not be
regarded from the revenue-producing point of view.
If we had 8,000 families growing tobacco they would be
worth more to the country than the revenue derived
from the duties,
745. Could they depend entirely on tobacco ?—Yes.
A man who does not specialize on it is likely to fail.
A man could make a living for himself and family
with IQ or 12 acres of tobacco-growing land.
746. What is your opinion of the Federal Investiga-
tion ?—The Government should put an expert in charge
of a plot of a few acres, erect a barn on it, and ask
him to prove the proper varieties to grow, and the best
fertilizers to use.
747. Have not the State Governments done a good
deal in the way of experiments?— Yes, but they have
not done anything practical by way of demonstration.
Let the expert carry the work through, from the seed-
lings to the cured article, and let the work be done in
a tobacco-growing area. A practical demonstration is
better than hundreds of pages of literature.
748. There must be expert supervision?— Yes. The
farmer knows nothing about the chemical analysis of
soils.
749. The grower would be the ideal man to have
working under the supervision of an expert?—l do
'not think any grower would take that responsibility
on his own shoulders.
750. Have you any further evidence to give?—A
letter signed by Mr, Gepp appeared in the press
advising groovers not to extend the area under cultiva-
tion. We have been led to believe that to a certain
extent the Investigation Committee were in opposition
to the interests of the tobacco-grow T ers generally. The
committee sent a quantity of tobacco to England for
testing purposes nearly two years ago, and when we
asked Mr. Gepp for the result he refused to give us
any information.
The witness withdrew.
John Henry Gray, tobacco-grower, Myrtleford, was
called, sworn and examined.
751. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?— Eight years. The area I have had
under cultivation has varied from sto 30 acres. This
year I planted 14 acres, but as I have adopted a dif-
ferent planting system from that of other growers it
is equivalent to about 20 acres under ordinary con-
ditions.
752. Do you advocate small areas of about 20 acres
rather than blocks of 60 or 80 acres? —Many growers
cannot afford large areas; not many put in as much
as 20 acres.
753. In what respect is your system different from
that of other growers ?—I learned my method of plant-
ing from Mr. McGee, wffio puts in 7,200 plants to the
acre instead of the ordinary 4,800. It was an experi-
mental plot and I obtained very good results. The
yield was 1 ton to the acre of good mahogany leaf that
averaged Is. 9d. a lb. I have followed that system
and found it quite satisfactory. This year my pro-
portion of bright leaf was over 50 per cent.
754. What is your average price?— This year it was
2s. 4d. a lb., including the bonus. It would average
about 2s. without the extra 6d., and at 2s. I think it is
a far better paying proposition than any other crop.
I know of nothing so good. I have had a couple of
bad years, but, taking the good with the. bad, I think
an average price of 2s. would pay me. A crop yielding
8 cwt. of tobacco to the acre would return £96 gross
per acre. I contend that tobacco should be grown for
£5O per acre, leaving an average profit of £46 per acre.
755. In view of the high risks run you want a profit
of 100 per cent?— Yes.
756. Although other growers have said that 2s. a
lb. does not pay, you regard it as a fine paying price?
—X do.


757. Did you put in an expensive plant?—l have 40
acres costing £27 10s. per acre, and I have erected
four barns and a shed measuring 50 ft. x 32 ft. These,
together with the necessary implements and horses,
did not cost me more than £2,000, including the land.
758. At the end of eight years you are quite satisfied
with the industry on the present scale of prices?—
Quite..
759. What about blue mould?—We all experience
that. I think it was worse before I came to the dis-
tinct. It is not so serious as it was eight years ago.
Prior to that the plants were grown in the district, but
by obtaining their plants elsewhere the growers have
reduced the trouble from this disease.
760. What is your opinion of the Federal Investiga-
tion work? —It is a very proper thing for the Federal
authorities to do, and, if the time ever came when the
growers and the State members were represented,
heaven have mercy 7 on Mr, Slagg.
761. Do you think that if the investigations are con-
tinued on the.present lines, without the growers being
represented on the committee, the results are likely to be
beneficial ?—Yes. I am guided in my 7 opinion by the
results obtained from a small allotment that I grew
for Mr, Slagg last year. It was a new variety of
tobacco that he sent to me. Unfortunately, Mr. Slagg
left the matter in the hands of the State experts.
Seventy plants reached me, but arrived in a half-baked
condition. From the plants that survived I obtained
a far better colour than has been produced for some
time. I quite agree with Mr. Slagg that any experi-
ments made should be entirely under the supervision of
a member of his staff. The work should never be left
to the ordinary grower.
762. Do you think that the excise duty should be
abolished or reduced?—lt does not matter very much
while the present prices continue. I do not think the
public could be induced to smoke a different tobacco,
unless it suited the palate.
763. If the Australian tobacco were aged for longer
periods would it have better smoking qualities?—l
cannot offer an opinion on that point. I have never
experimented on those lines, and I doubt whether any
of the growers have.
764. While you can get 2s. a lb. you are perfectly
satisfied -without any alteration in the excise duty
and without further protection ?—Certainly.
765. Have you anything to add to your evidence?- —
I am going to borrow the words of a very old friend.
In talking over the matter yesterday with Air. Eugene
Kneebone, he said he would give 15 per cent, in every
100 per cent, to the selection of the proper varieties
of tobacco suitable for our soils, 80 per cent, for the
curing of the leaf, and 5 per cent for the grading. A
lot of tobacco has been grown and sold for about Is. 6d.
to Is. 9d. per lb., whereas if it had been cured by an
experienced man it w 7 ould have fetched from 2s. to
3s. a lb. We have never had any assistance from the
experts in the curing of tobacco. Nor has the grading,
so far as I know, ever been mentioned in the district
by a tobacco expert. How can the growers be expected
to properly grade their leaf?
766. Do you do your own grading and curing?—
Yes. I am not good at curing. That is a matter in
which we need more assistance. With expert advice
as to the proper varieties to plant, we could grow 75
per cent, of bright tobacco.
767. By Mr. Smith. —ls it not a fact that Air. Alarks
was selected as the best flue-curer in Australia to act
as assistant in that v/ork to the expert of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture?— Yes.
768. How many times has Mr. Marks visited your
place and given you information in regard to curing?
—Not once.
769. 1 have been there pretty often myself?—l do
not think you have been there for two years.
770. I have been there a number of times when yon
were not there?—We want a practical demonstration
of curing and we have never had it.
The witness withdrew.
Eugene Kneebone was recalled and further examined
771. By the Chairman. —l understand you wish to
supplement your evidence? —I contradict the statement
attributed to me by Mr. Gray. He said something
about 80 per cent., 15 per cent., and 5 per cent. Ido
not know what he means. I have never had any con-
versation with him on that subject.
The witness withdrew.
John Smith was recalled and further examined.
772. By the Chairman. —What do you wish to say?
—I live in the same district as Mr. Gray. Mr. Marks
is no personal friend of mine. He stayed at my place
for over a week curing tobacco.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
[Taken at Sydney.)
THURSDAY, 30th JANUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr, Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan.
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd.; Mr. C. M. Slagg,
representing the Executive Committee of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation ; Mr. Temple Smith,
of the Department of Agriculture, Victoria).
George Percy Darnell-Smith, D.Sc., F.1.C., Director of
the Botanic Gardens, Sydney, and member of the
Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation, was called, sworn, and examined.
773. By the Chairman.—-How long have you held
the position of Director of Botanic Gardens, Sydney?
—Six years.
774. How long have you been a member of the
Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco Inves-
tigation?— Since its initiation, about three years ago.
775. The committee would like to hear your views
regarding tobacco-growing in Australia ?—ln discussing
the production and consumption of tobacco one may
take one of two views—(1) that all tobacco is very
much the same, there being a few different degrees of
strength, and that all that has to be done is to grow the
tobacco, dry it, allow it to mature, and then cut it up
and smoke it; or (2), that the tobacco plant is extra-
ordinarily susceptible to variations in its surroundings,
and that almost every quality of the leaf is susceptible
in a greater or less degree to variations in the soil and
the climatic conditions under which it is grown. I
hold the latter view; I see no escape from it. Provided
the rainfall is sufficient and the temperature warm and
no frost occurs, there is very little difficulty about
actually growing tobacco; but the quality of the tobacco
obtained will vary immensely. In the south-eastern
States of America, where bright, aromatic, flue-cured
tobacco is grown, they recognize in this one tobacco
alone no less than six different groups, nine different
qualities in each group, and five different colours,
making in all a total of 270 grades. This is quite inde-
pendent of the varieties of tobacco grown. Moreover,
there are four so-called types, which are determined


by geographical position—type 1 coining from Vir-
ginia, type 2 from North Carolina, type 3 from South
Carolina, and type 4 from Georgia, and these 270
grades occur in each type. In England, American
tobacco is very largely known as Virginian tobacco, this
being the original source from which tobacco was
obtained. The bright, aromatic, flue-cured tobacco, for
which there is at present such a big demand, is, in
Virginia, grown upon the light soils only. On the
heavy soils they do not attempt to grow it, but have
to be satisfied to grow the far less profitable dark, fire-
cured tobacco. It is somewhat surprising to find that
not tobacco, but poultry-raising, is the principal
industry of Virginia to-day. This brings one to the
change of public taste in tobacco. Before 1900 most
men were pipe smokers, while few women smoked. By
1914 many men had become cigarette smokers. At the
end of the war, in 1918, still more men w r ere cigarette
smokers, and very many women became cigarette
smokers also. The general tendency was a steadily
increasing demand for bright, aromatic, flue-cured
tobacco. This demand has been felt in Australia as well
as elsewhere. The manufacturer must ever keep in
touch with the demands of the consumer and endeavour
to meet them. The tobacco-grower must ever keep in
touch with the manufacturer and endeavour to meet
his requirements. By far the largest manufacturers
here are the British-Australasian Tobacco Company.
They have fairly definitely set out their requirements.
The New South Wales tobacco-grower has been able to
meet them only in part. This has not been entirely
due either to faults of the growers or to the instruc-
tions he has received from officers of the Department of
Agriculture, nor has it been entirely due to
demands impossible of fulfilment by the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company. I have considered the
question very carefully, and some points which emerge
are the following:-—-In the past the tobacco industry
has developed mainly in the districts around Tam-
worth and Tumut. In the Tamworth district most of
the tobacco is grown under irrigation; a considerable
amount of money has been expended in irrigation plant
by the growers. In the Tamworth and the Tumut
districts a considerable amount of money has been
expended upon curing barns also, which, in general, are
far more elaborate than the majority of those I saw
in America. Yet the type and quality of tobacco that
the growers and the manufacturers desire has not been
obtained. In America the type of tobacco under dis-
cussion is grown in very poor soil—so poor that it
would not produce a worth-while crop without manure.
A very careful study has been made of the kind and
quality of fertilizers to employ. This latter is most
important. Just enough fertilizer is applied to see
the crop through to maturity, and no more. The crop
is all yellow in the field before it enters the curing
barn, and the aroma in the barns is sweet and honey-
like, even before heating commences. I am of opinion
that good qualities must be in a tobacco leaf before it
is dried or cured, and that no amount of subsequent
treatment will put them there. Holding leaf in storage
for a year or more before manufacture will produce a
certain amount of mellowness, but nothing more; it
will not put in qualities that are not there before
storage. I have been over the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company’s factory in Melbourne. My obser-
vations were that the treatment given to Australian leaf,
so far as maturation was concerned, was the same as
that given to American leaf. I have gone over the
factory of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
in Sydney when Australian leaf was being manufac-
tured, and the treatment given to Australian leaf was
the same as that given to American leaf. I have
attended auction sales of tobacco in the American
markets and seen excellent leaf bought in open com-
petition for the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
at lOd. to per lb. The question arises, therefore,
wherein does New South Wales leaf fail? I can only
speak broadly here; time will not permit of me going
into detail. Generally, the burning quality of the leaf
is most excellent, but elasticity is wanting; the colour
of a large proportion of it is unsatisfactory, and the
aroma is not good, it being rather better in the light
than in the dark leaf. What, then, can be done to
improve the colour and the aroma? To get colour in
a leaf, the leaf must be mature, and no curer, however
skilful, can satisfactorily cure a leaf that is not mature.
I think that one reason w r hy the leaf in the areas
referred to does not mature is that the soil is too rich.
The plant, instead of reaching maturity in three
months, may go on growing for five months without even
then showing much sign of ripening. Another reason
is that the grower frequently loses his early seed-beds
through the ravages of blue mould. In consequence,
he plants out late, and then is faced finally with one of
two alternatives— (a) leaving his crop to mature with
the possibility of losing the wEole from an early frost,
or (&) gathering it too soon and attempting to cure
it before it is mature. Naturally, he chooses the latter
course; but the final colour of the cured leaf is very
bad. Blue mould is due to a parasitic fungus known
as Peronospora hyoscyami. I have tried many means
of controlling it, and in all this Avork have always had
the hearty co-operation of tobacco-growers. Steam steri-
lization of the soil, spraying with Bordeaux mixture,
spraying with Burgundy mixture, dusting with copper
carbonate, dusting with sulphur, planting American
seed in near and remote places have all been tried, but
no method which could with confidence be recom-
mended for adoption by the growers has been found.
The outstanding point is that the less water used
commensurate with the actual water requirements of
the young plant, the better, and the temperature of the
seed bed should not fall below 45 degrees F. I have
previously indicated that in a poor soil just sufficient
fertilizer can be added to carry the plant to maturity.
There does not seem to be much sense in adding fer-
tilizer to a rich soil, but certain fertilizers have a
marked effect. Superphosphate, for example, hastens
maturity, but if added to a rich soil it does not follow
that the plant will take it up. I have seen fertilizer
applied to rows of plants in the Tamworth district, but
little indication that the plants have taken much of it
up. Certainly no analyses were made, but their roots
extended far away beyond the fertilizer into soil which
apparently was more congenial and better suited for
furnishing plant food. I merely quote this to illustrate
the difficulty of effecting improvement by the addition
of fertilizers to a rich soil. One cannot be certain that
the plant will take them up and utilize them. The aroma
of a large proportion of New South Wales tobacco is
disagreeable. I understand from the manufacturers
that tobacco made entirely from it has met with
no demand, and that only a certain percentage can
be used in blending. How then can the aroma be
improved? To what is aroma due? Aroma must be
due to certain constituents in the leaf. It is generally
held by plant physiologists that all the constituents of
the plant, except carbon, are derived from the soil, and
that the other constituents of the plant are taken up
from the soil in some simple inorganic forms and
elaborated into more complex substances in the leaf.
In accordance with this view, it is held that the plant
does not take up any organic compounds from the soil.
This may be the correct view ; but because it has been
held for a long time it by no means follows that it is
necessarily correct. In regard to tobacco, it does not
fit in with experience. The seed of Havanna tobacco
when grown in Manilla does not produce Havanna
tobacco; the seed of Turkish tobacco grown in America
does not produce Turkish tobacco. The Americans
wish it did, for it save them much. They have


spent a great deal of money in attempts to produce it.
The plants grow, but the leaf has not the true Turkish
aroma. These and other considerations lead to the
conclusion that the nature of the soil has a great
influence on the aroma of tobacco. If the plant merely
took up from the soil simple inorganic substances, as
has been generally supposed, it is difficult to conceive
that the soil would have much influence upon the aroma
of tobacco. But if the plant does take up organic
matter from the soil, the whole aspect changes. Soil
is made, firstly, by the decomposition and disintegra-
tion of rocks, and the soil from, say, granite in one
part of the world is likely to be very similar in chemi-
cal constitution to soil from granite in another part of
the world so far as its rock origin is concerned. But,
in addition, soil is also largely made up from the decom-
position of vegetable matter. The vegetation in
Havanna is different from that in Manilla; the
vegetation in Turkey is different from that in America.
If any of the organic decomposition products of this
vegetation were taken up by tobacco it might influence
the aroma. The aroma is certainly quite different,
although the same tobacco seed is used in the countries
mentioned. Turning now to Australia, the charac-
teristic vegetation of Australian is the eucalypt. There
are over 300 species, and only two or three occur outside
the continent. Supposing all the eucalypts were re-
moved, the characteristic vegetation would be the
acacias, of which there are over 500 species. And
supposing all the acacias were removed, the charac-
teristic vegetation would be the banksias and their
allies. In reference to the question, therefore, as to the
influence, if any, of decomposing vegetation upon
tobacco aroma, the foliage of eucalypts naturally
suggests itself for trial in the first place. Experi-
ments carried out in 1926 and subsequent years indi-
cate that the decomposing foliage of certain eucalypts,
and certain organic compounds added to the soil do have
a marked influence upon the aroma of tobacco. It must
not be assumed that the foliage of all eucalypts will
have the same effect, for the content of that of each
species is different. Even with Eucalyptus dives, the
one from which a large quantity of oil is distilled for
commerce, the chemical proportions of the constituents
of the oil differ according to the locality in which the
tree is grown. That is, in itself, confirmation of the
proposition that I am placing before the committee.
The careful analyses that disclosed this fact were made
at the Technological Museum. If it is assumed that
the aroma of Australian or any other tobacco has no
connexion with the decomposed or decomposing vege-
table matter in the soil, and can be altered by some
process of maturation or treatment after drying or
curing, the experiments which have been carried out
at Bathurst have no significance. But if, as I believe,
they indicate that the decomposed or decomposing
vegetable matter in the soil has a marked influence
upon the aroma of tobacco, they are of fundamental
importance and far-reaching significance, for they
indicate that the plant does take up organic matter,
not inorganic matter only, from the soil. They may
lead to an explanation of the origin of aroma in
tobacco, and possibly to its improvement or control.
They will, no doubt, be fully exploited in other coun-
tries. Unfortunately, an agricultural experiment of
the type described can be carried out only once each
year; it cannot be repeated rapidly several times like
many experiments in a chemical laboratory. ’Beach-
ing finality is, therefore, a slow process. But tests and
experiments, accompanied by the sober thoughts of
earnest men, are likely to lead to greater progress than
assertions.
776. Do you consider that the large number of grades
in the various quality groups have been sufficiently
studied by tobacco-growers in Australia? —No. In the
present state of the industry, Australian growers could
not possibly grade as they do in the United States of
America; but in the grades which they have adopted
they could, and should, exercise very much greater care
in grading. I do not suggest that they should adopt a
lot of fresh grades; but Ido urge that more attention
be paid to grading in order to get greater uniformity.
A sample hand of tobacco should be a fair sample of
the tobacco it purports to represent. At present not
sufficient care is taken with the grading of leaf.
Naturally, buyers do not want to take any risks, and
if they think that the bulk is not quite up to the
standard they protect themselves by offering compara-
tively low prices.
777. How many grades of tobacco are there in Aus-
tralia?— From three to five.
778. Have you had a lot of experience with Aus-
tralian growers?— Yes, at Tam worth and Tumut.
779. Would you say that Australian growers are
taking an intelligent interest in the grading of tobacco ?
—Yes; but there is need for greater accuracy in
grading.
780. Is grading complicated ?—No. Once a grower
has been shown half a dozen samples of leaf he should
be able to grade his crop accordingly. It is merely a
matter of judgment.
781. You would not expect a grower to divide his
crop into 270 different grades?— No.
782. Are there 270 colour grades?— No. First,
tobacco is graded according to the locality in which it
is grown. A tobacco man in America can easily tell
whether the leaf submitted to him is grown in Carolina
or Georgia. The leaf is then graded according to
the part of the plant from which it is taken —whether
it is a wrapper or a stripper leaf. It is then graded
according to quality. Considerable care is exer-
cised in the grading of American tobacco. They
take into consideration the quality and amount
of midrib and ribbing in the leaf, its elasticity,
thickness, texture, amount of oil, and other qualities.
It is then graded for colour. In Australia grading into
five grades is sufficient at present.
783. Would it not be beyond the knowledge of Aus-
tralian growers to grade tobacco into four types with
270 grades in each type?—ln America experts go into
the market and select haphazardly samples of tobacco
leaf which have been sold at auction. The growers are
then asked to grade the leaf and to fix a value for it.
Afterwards the experts point out where they have failed
in grading, either as to colour or quality. In addition,
a county agent, who occupies a similar position to
that of agricultural instructor in Australia, is always
visiting the growers and giving them assistance in the
matter of grading.
784. Then the American tobacco-grower receives a
considerable amount of valuable assistance from tobacco
experts?— That is so.
785. Does he depend on that assistance?—To some
extent he does. It may be that he has in his barn
a number of men known to be good graders. In such
cases he does not depend so greatly upon expert advice.
786.,D0 not the American growers themselves, bj
reason of their experience, tend to become more expert
in grading?— Yes, Every tobacco farmer of experience
is or should be well informed in the matter of grading.
787. Nevertheless, they need assistance from depart-
mental experts ?—The department there desires that
the grower shall be kept in touch with the latest develop-
ments.
788. Does that not suggest that the cultivation of the
grading instinct is complicated, and necessitates expert
tuition?— Yes.


789. It would appear that the Australian tobacco-
grower who has had little experience is being asked
by the manufacturers to do too much to grade his
tobacco without any great amount of expert assistance?
—No. What is necessary is further instruction by the
department in grading. I should not throw the onus
upon the company, for then it would be open to the
grower to feel somewhat hurt if his tobacco is graded
low.
790. Do you consider that the Australian grower,
in view of his limited experience and lack of expert
tuition, is faced with a difficult problem in the grading
of his tobacco ?—I consider that he needs more frequent
instruction in grading.
791. How can he get it ? —Only by tuition from men
with a good knowledge of tobacco.
792. Would you say that the tobacco experts in the
Hew South Wales Department of Agriculture are
sufficiently expert in grading to instruct growers?—
Yes.
793. Are there sufficient such men available ?—Not
during the grading season, which is comparatively
short. It is difficult to visit all the farms in the season
and give instruction to growers. I suggest that a good
grader be sent around to the different farms to instruct
the growers in grading. He nqed not be a tobacco
expert.
794. Are there sufficient men in Australia with the
requisite knowledge to fill those position?— Yes. There
are only five grades of tobacco in Australia, and it
would be a great improvement if all the tobacco grown
here were properly graded into those five grades.
795. If that were done, Avould it improve the com-
mercial value of the leaf ?-—T think so.
796. Does bad grading reduce the value of the leaf?
—Yes. When tobacco is badly graded the buyer does
not know what he is buying. Consequently he makes
a conservative offer for the leaf.
797. It has been suggested that there should bo
central grading depots. What do you think of the
suggestion?—lt does not appeal to me. It would mean
extra handling of the leaf, which, in a dry year, would
be damaged by too much handling.
798. Is Australian leaf more brittle than American
leaf?— Yes.
799. In your pamphlet you devoted a considerable
amount of space to grading. I take it that the prin-
ciple part of the grading is done in the American
depots?— No. All the grading is done in the sheds
of the growers.
800. Do you think that grading on the farm is the
proper method?— Yes. In America, in spite of the
comparatively good grading, poorly graded leaf some-
times gets on to the market. That leaf brings a low-
price. Speculators buy it cheaply, and have it regraded
by expert coloured women. Generally, they sell it at
a profit.
801. Those speculators make their profits out of the
bad grading of the groAA'ers?—Yes.
802. You do not favour the establishment of central
grading depots?— No. A man going round to the
growers in the grading season to assist them Avould be
better for both the farmer and the industry.
803. Would you say that one of the first require-
ments is that Australian groAvers must master the art of
grading ?—Yes.
804. How can they be better trained in grading?—
I suggest that three hands of typical samples of each of
the five grades be prepared and sent to growers, who
should be asked to grade their crops to those standards.
The samples should be prepared by experts.
805. Do you think that the buyers would be satisfied
with such grading and pay. accordingly ?—At present
groA\ r ers classify their leaf according to their OAvn ideas.
The standards of different growers are different. If
they all worked to the same standard there would be
greater uniformity, and their leaf would bring better
prices.
806. The growers complain that the final judge of
the grading is the buyer, who practically fixes the grade
and the price?—l think my suggestion would help to
meet that difficulty.
807. Do you consider that Australian growers have
endeavoured to keep in touch with the requirements of
the manufacturers?-—Yes; but the dice are loaded
against the grower. He has developed his industry in
districts which are suitable only for the production of
a fairly heavy dark-coloured leaf, whereas light bright
tobacco is now increasingly in demand. Manufacturers
want that type. The growers have tried to meet the
demand; but they are growing tobacco in districts in
which it is extremely difficult to grow the type asked
for. Whatever care the grower bestows on his crop,
he is not likely to raise really bright aromatic flue-cured
leaf on heavy soil. Most of the tobacco grown in the
Tamworth district is grown on the more or less heavy
alluvial flats of the Peel River, where the grower can
irrigate his crop. But nearer the ranges, where the
soil is lighter, the crop cannot be irrigated, and the
rainfall is uncertain.
808. Has not the change in the public taste for
tobacco, and the consequent demand of the manufac-
turers for light flue-cured leaf, placed growers at a
disadvantage?—No one can foresee the trend of taste
in smoking. The growers have endeavoured to meet
the changed demand by erecting barns for flue-curing
their leaf.
809. Notwithstanding the efforts of growers to meet
the demands of the manufacturers, a further change
in the public taste might affect them at any time?—
If further losses are sustained because of a change in
the public taste for tobacco, I do not know who should
bear the loss. The growers would naturally feel that,
having established flue-curing barns to meet manu-
facturers’ requirements, the} 1- should be recompensed
for the outlay.
810. Do you think the manufacturers should, for a
time, offer growers higher than market prices for bright
tobacco, in order to encourage them to grow that type?
—No. If groAvers Avere paid higher prices for a time
they Avould not want to accept lower prices later.
811. Do you think that manufacturers Avould be
foolish to offer higher prices for light tobaccoes in order
to encourage groAvers to groAv that type of tobacco
instead of the darker grades ?—Yes. If a grower is
able to produce equal quantities of bright and dark
tobacco from the same soil he should be able in time
to increase the quantity of bright leaf and reduce the
quantity' of dark leaf; but Avhere his lighter types are
grown on light soil and the darker tobaccoes on heavy
soil, it is more difficult to do so.
812. Then if he has not the right soil for growing
light tobacco, he may just as well get out of the busi-
ness?-—That is practically Avhat it comes to.
813. If a groAver can produce, say, from 60 -per cent,
to 80 per cent, of bright , leaf, AAmuld it not be worth
while for the buyers to encourage him for a feAv years
until he becomes more established?— The higher price
paid for bright leaf is his encouragement.
814. -You say that the type and quality of tobacco
that the growers and the manufacturers desire has not
been obtained. Would you say that no tobacco of the
type and quality acceptable to Australian smokers
is being produced in Australia ?—I do not say that no
tobacco of the type desired has been produced. While
Australian tobacco has - improved lately, it has not
reached the standard which the manufacturer desires.
It is not equal to that Avhich he can get from America.


One has only to handle Tam worth tobacco to see how
it differs from American tobacco. When I w 7 as in
Carolina the atmosphere was as still as it is in this
room for two months at a time. It was so saturated
with moisture that it resembled the atmosphere of a
glass house. Tobacco grown in Carolina grows in a
humid atmosphere. At Tam worth there may be a few
points of rain, and then some bright hot days, followed
by a strong wind. The Tamworth tobacco is therefore
more harsh. The veins are larger. It is not so elastic
or oily as American tobacco.
815. Are the ideal conditions of Carolina found in
other parts of the world wdiere tobacco is grown, as, for
instance, Rhodesia and South Africa ? —I do not know
the conditions in Rhodesia and South Africa, and am
therefore unable to make a comparison. I referred
to Carolina because the best tobacco comes from
there.
816. Bo you know of any parts of Australia where
satisfactory conditions obtain? —In North Queensland
there are large areas in the Mareeba district and on
towards Chillagoe where the soil conditions appear to
be ideal. The rainy season commences in November,
and the atmosphere remains humid until about March,
when the rain ceases. The climatic conditions there
should be suitable for tobacco-growing. Last year,
however, they had terrific downpours of rain, and this
year they have had heavy floods. Such occurrences are
not favorable to tobacco-growing; but, generally, the
conditions in that part of North Queensland are such
as to indicate that tobacco could be grown there success-
fully.
817. Have you conducted any tests in that district ?
—The Australian Tobacco Investigation made a
number of exploratory tests there. They made a
number of trial plantings at different places and the
tobacco seemed satisfactory as regards colour and
texture, while there was an improved aroma. The
following year, instead of a number of scattered plots,
a larger area was planted with tobacco at Mareeba.
A fair quantity of tobacco was grown; but, owing
to heavy rains and under-soakage which was not pro-
vided for, much of it was lost. However, the tobacco
when tested showed promise.
818. Would those heavy downpours of rain be a fatal
handicap to tobacco-growing?— Not fatal. I have not
been there in a tropical downpour; but, from w 7 hat I
have seen of the country, I think that the difficulty
could be met by a simple system of drainage.
819. I submit to you some samples of Australian
tobacco for your opinion ?—The appearance is satis-
factory ; but after a trial smoke I should say that the
smoking qualities are not seductive. A smoker wants
a tobacco or cigarette that he enjoys. The sample has
a somewhat penetrating action on the nostrils. The
aroma does not appeal to me. I do not feel that I
want to smoke another cigarette of the same kind.
820. Are you acquainted with “ Waratah’ 7 tobacco?
—I cannot express an opinion on pipe tobacco, as I
smoke cigarettes. I have smoked “ Waratah ” tobacco.
The aroma is not bad; but it is not sufficiently aromatic
to make me want one cigarette after another.
821, Do you think that the smoking of a cigarette
should leave a desire for another? Would you regard
that as a fair test of a cigarette?—lt might not be a
fair test; but, if tobacco is to be sold in large quantities,
the greater the desire of smokers to smoke it, the better
for both manufacturers and growers.
822. A tobacco which merely incites a desire to smoke
more, while perhaps good for the manufacturers and
growers, might not be good for the health of the com-
munity. Would it not be better if the smoking of a
tobacco left the smoker with a feeling of satisfaction?
—I do not agree with that view.
823. Is it correct that no remedy has been found for
blue mould?—USTo absolutely effective method of dealing
with blue mould is known.
824. Growers in Victoria told us that, if they sent to
other districts for their plants, their crops were almost
entirely free from blue mould ? —That appears feasible,
so long as the districts from which the plants are
obtained have never had blue mould. There is some
evidence that blue mould is carried in infected tobacco
seed. Blue mould is mainly a disease of the seed bed,
and it is probable that, if pure seed from another dis-
trict is obtained the crop would be free from blue mould.
825. Are you aware that different growers have their
own varying methods of dealing with blue mould?—
I have not yet met a grower whose method of dealing
with blue mould was effective.
826. Is it not probable that the growers will evolve
some means of dealing with blue mould?—l do not
think that they have yet found a satisfactory method
of dealing with the disease. A man who could raise
his own seedling plants free from blue mould year after
year would be in a very satisfactory position. I have
not yet found such a man.
827. You say that a large proportion of New South
Wales tobacco has a disagreeable aroma, and that you
understand from the manufacturers that tobacco made
entirely from it has met with no demand, and also
that only a certain percentage of it can be used in
blending. Is that a fair statement, seeing that there
is a fair demand for some Australian tobaccoes ?—Take
“Waratah” tobacco, for example. That brand was
well advertised, and samples were distributed through-
out Australia. A considerable quantity was sold; but
the demand not only has not increased, but it has not
been maintained. When I say that there is no demand
for New South Wales tobacco, I use the word
“ demand ” in a permanent sense. Perhaps I should
have said there has been no continuous demand for
it.
828. Do you think that manufacturers would go to
the expense of manufacturing tobacco which smokers
do not want?— No. It would pay manufacturers to use
Australian tobacco if they could sell it. I also realize
that many Australian smokers would prefer Australian
tobacco if it suited their taste. A manufacturer who
can produce Australian tobacco suitable to the Aus-
tralian smokers will get the business. I understand
that the demand for “ Waratah ” tobacco has not been
maintained.
829. lou say that if any of the organic decomposi-
tion products of vegetation were taken up by tobacco
it might influence the aroma. Does that mean that you
and the other experts are not in a position to say that
the vegetation does influence the aroma of tobacco?—
The view has been held that plants take from the soil
only inorganic matter and that plants do not take up
organic manure as such. That first the manure is
disintegrated into simple inorganic forms, and then
the plant takes them up. We were looking for a reason
why the aroma in Australian tobacco makes it
unpalatable to smokers, and we thought that probably
the decomposed vegetable material in the soil affected
the aroma. We made some tests with tobacco grown in
pure sand, and some grown in sand into which euca-
lyptus leaves had been dug. Cigarettes made from those
tobaccoes were given to a number of smokers, and
without knowing their origin, they reported that one
lot had a good aroma and the other a bad aroma.
That is an indication that the aroma of tobacco is
affected by the vegetable matter in the soil. I am not
prepared to say that it is any particular constituent of
the eucalypt that causes the unpleasant aroma in Aus-
tralian tobacco. Our experiments have not been carried
sufficiently far to enable us to make a definite pro-
nouncement on the subject. We have found that organic


matter in the soil derived from decomposing eucalyptus
leaves affected the aroma of tobacco. I should not like
to make a definite statement on the matter yet; but that
is what our experiments indicate. Without further
investigation, it would be unwise to express a definite
opinion. The experiment can, of course, be carried out
only once a year. We think that we have gone some
way towards ascertaining the reason for the aroma in
tobacco.
830. It has been definitely stated in the press that
a fundamental and fatal defect in Australian tobacco is
its eucalyptus taint caused by the presence of a volatile
oil known as phellandrene, which is absorbed by the
tobacco plant. The committee would be glad to know
what data the experts have at their disposal?— All the
data available are summarized in the report of the
Australian Tobacco Investigation, entitled “ Progress
Report of the Australian Tobacco Investigation to
January, 1930.” On page 54 of that progress report
the following appears:—
11. SOME FACTORS INFLUENCING AROMA IN TOBACCO.
To determine if the distinctive aroma of tobacco grown in
New South Wales and Victoria is due to the soil or to the
climate, and to gain knowledge of other factors influencing
aroma in cured tobacco, an experiment was begun in 192(5
by Mr. H. A. McGee, then experimentalist with the British-
Australian Tobacco Company. This test was taken over by
the Australian Tobacco Investigation in 1927.
American soil from the Tobacco Experimental Farm at
Oxford, North Carolina, was imported in 192(5, sterilized, and
placed in two concrete pits each 7 feet x 11 feet in dimensions.
Typical Australian soil from the Bathurst Experimental
Farm was placed alongside in two similar pits. Clean river
sand from a deep excavation was placed in twm more similar
pits. One pit of American soil and one pit of Australian
soil were left unfertilized. The others were fertilized at
the rate of 1,000 lb. per acre with a 3.8.3* tobacco fertilizer,
excepting the two sand pits, which received 2,000 and 4,000
lb. per acre respectively. These pits were then planted
(October, 1926), with the Dunbur variety of tobacco, and
a screen of hessian placed over and around the whole. When
the plants had matured sufficiently the leaves were harvested
and flue-cured. Smoking tests were then made on the cured
leaf, These smoking tests disclosed no objectionable aroma
in the tobacco from the two American soil plots, nor from
the two river sand plots, but a very objectionable aroma from
both the fertilized and unfertilized Australian soil plots.
In the winter of 1927 six more pits were added, two of
Australian soil and four of river sand. The two additional
Australian soil pits were fertilized as before except that the
nitrogen on one was furnished in the form of urea, and on
the other in form of calcium cyanamide. All six sand pits
were fertilized with the 3.8.3 fertilizer at the rate of 4,000
per acre. In addition, two of the new sand pits received 40 lb.
each of freshly macerated green leaves of Eucalyptus dives,
and the other two new pits received 40 lb. each of freshly
macerated leaves of Eucalyptus Blakelyi. One of the original
sand pits was watered with a 1 to 100,000 emulsion of
phellandrene oil and water, and one of the original Aus-
tralian soil pits had chlorine added in the form of common
salt (NaCl).
The 1928-29 series was conducted as above outlined for
1927-28 except that fresh eucalyptus leaves were not added
to one pit of each of the E. dives and E. Blakelyi pairs.
Results {1927-28) .-—An agreeable aroma was found in the
cured leaf from the American soil pits and from the
fertilized river sand. Leaf from the sand pit watered with
an emulsion of phellandrene oil seemed somewhat objection-
able, and leaf from all the Australian soil pits and from the
pits to which eucalyptus leaves had been added was highly
objectionable.
Results (1928-29). —The leaf was harvested in three pick-
ings, and each picking tested separately. The outstanding
results may be summarized as follows: —
(1) Soil imported from North Carolina in 1926 still
produced leaf with an agreeable aroma at
Bathurst in 1928-29.
(2) The addition of urea to the Australian soil at
Bathurst definitely improved the aroma of tobacco
leaf produced thereon.
(3) Calcium cyanamide as a source of nitrogen had
little or no effect on early pickings of leaf grown
on the Australian soil, but appeared to improve
the aroma of late picked leaf.
* The numbers refer to the respective content of nitrogen, phosphoric acid
and potash in the fertilizer. Thus this fertilizer carries 3% nitrogen, 8%
phospnoric acid, and 3% potash,
(4) Salt (NaCl) had little or no effect on the aroma of
cured leaf harvested from Australian soil to which
it had been applied.
( o) Phellandrene oil appeared to affect somewhat the
aroma of early pickings of leaf from river sand
to which it had been applied, but had little or no
effect on late picked leaf.
(6) Fresh eucalyptus leaves added to river sand definitely
impaired the aroma of tobacco grown thereon. No
difference was noted between E. dives and E.
Blakelyi. Both were equally bad.
(7) The residual effects of fresh eucalyptus leaves added
to river sand in 1927 appeared markedly to improve
the aroma of tobacco grown thereon in 1928-29.
'these results have been set out in the form of an article, a
copy of which is available.
They were simply experiments to try to ascertain the
cause of aroma in tobacco. We are not yet in a posi-
tion to say definitely that eucalyptus oil is the main
factor, but the experiments are highly suggestive.
831. Does that report contain all the data available
in regard to the alleged eucalyptus taint in tobacco?—
It is a summary of the experiments which have been
conducted.
832. Do you know whether any other experiments
have been made?— Yes. Some experiments were carried
out by Mr. Tregenna at Tamworth with the idea of
improving the aroma of Australian tobacco. He made
a number of soil treatments, but I think his experi-
ments were confined to one year.
833. Would it be fair to say that the Progress Report
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation to January,
1930, comprises the whole of the data which you con-
sider should be made available on this subject at the
present time?— Yes.
834. It appears that the method adopted was to
infect certain plots of land with an emulsion of
eucalyptus leaves?—lt was not an emulsion. The
green leaves were dug into the soil. The idea was to
do by artificial means in a short time what is done
naturally over long periods, I do not suppose that
40 lb. of eucalyptus leaves would fall into a pit of the
size of the experimental plot in the ordinary course of
nature. We really exaggerated natural conditions. If
I had not made the test I should have thought that the
only effect of digging in the eucalyptus leaves would be
to produce bigger plants. But the tests showed a
marked difference in the aroma of the tobacco. When
the test was repeated the result was the same. If
eucalyptus leaves dug into the soil affect the aroma of
tobacco, it is probably equally true that other vegetable
matter placed in the soil would affect it also. That is
why I say that if the theory is correct it is of great
importance. Turkish tobacco is grown in Turkey. The
American tobacco-growers cannot grow in their country
tobacco with a Turkish aroma. That suggests that
there is some vegetable ingredient in the Turkish soil
which causes the Turkish aroma.
835. Is it possible that the Turkish aroma is due to
the chemical composition of the Turkish soil?— The
chemical composition of the Turkish soil would depend
upon the vegetable matter in that soil.
836. Would you say that the impregnation of the
soil with eucalyptus by digging in eucalyptus leaves
Avould be likely to produce more definite results in the
aroma of tobacco than would the impregnation of the
soil in the ordinary course of nature?—To answer that
question I should have to knoAv the history of the soil.
Take a barren island thrown up in the sea by volcanic
action. At first it has no vegetation on it, but after
a while the rock begins to disintegrate and to form
sand. In time struggling plants will be found grow-
ing in the sand. Those plants decompose and fertilize
the soil. Later, small shrubs appear. In the course of
ages the disintegration of the rock and the decomposi-
tion of vegetable matter determine the character of the


837. Bo you think that river flat soil on which most
of the Australian tobacco is now grown, is likely to
contain a definite impregnation from the eucalyptus?
■ —Yes. Any soil contains a large amount of vegetable
matter. Tamworth soil contains a large residue of
vegetable matter from past ages; and that probably
influences the plant life grown in it.
838. Would not that river soil be washed down from
the mountains?— Yes.
839. Do you consider river flat country ideal for
making tests ?—Experience has shown that tobacco
grown on that country has not a desirable aroma.
840. Do you say that tobacco grown there has a
definite eucalypi aroma?— No. We chose eucalypt
leaves for the test because the eucalypt is the prevail-
ing vegetation in Australia.
841. Your purpose was merely to ascertain whether
a eucalyptus taint existed in the tobacco?— Yes.
842. You considered that the experiments conducted
by you have given you a lead?— Yes.
843. As the result of your experiments, would you say
that any person would be justified in saying that
tobacco, with a good aroma, could not be produced in
certain districts because experience had shown that
tobacco grown there had a eucalyptus taint?—No
tobacco expert is in a position to say that.
844. Would any tobacco buyer be justified in saying
that experts were of the opinion that tobacco grown in
certain districts has a eucalyptus taint ?—I do not think
he could say that; but he might say that he would
prefer not to purchase tobacco from certain districts
because it had an aroma which he did not like—not
necessarily a eucalyptus taint.
845. By Mr. Morgan. —Seeing that the eucalypt is
the characteristic vegetation of Australia, would it not
be practically impossible to secure a tract of land free
from the possibility of eucalyptus taint?—l do not
like the term “ eucalyptus taint ”, So far, we have
experimented with only two species of eucalypts—Euca-
lyptus dives , and Eucalyptus Blakelyi. We chose Euca-
lyptus dives because it was known to be rich in eucalyp-
tus oil, and we chose Eucalyptus Blakelyi because it
had very little phellandrene. Eucalyptus dives is
generally known as a peppermint. In some experimen-
tal plots in Queensland, we found that the tobacco
produced was of good quality and aroma, I was there-
fore desirous of ascertaining the nature of the vegeta-
tion in the district, I made a survey of the district and
found fourteen or fifteen varieties of eucalyptus. The
varieties of eucalyptus in the district around Mareeba
are different from those in the Tamworth district.
846. Are Eucalyptus dives and Eucalyptus Blakelyi
to be found in the Mareeba district?— No.
847. Do they exist in the Tamworth district?—
Eucalyptus Blakelyi, does, but not Eucalyptus dives.
848. Do those varieties grow in the Ovens Valley?
I am not acquainted with the vegetation of Victoria.
849. So far as you are aware, it is only a coincidence
that there is no Eucalyptus dives or Eucalyptus Blakel-
yi in the Mareeba district where good tobacco is ob-
tained, and that in districts where tobacco with an
unpleasant aroma is grown, those varieties of eucalyp-
tus are to be found?— Yes. The flora of the Tamworth
and Mareeba districts are different.
850. I understand that good results were obtained
from tobacco grown at Manjimup in Western Australia.
Do the same conditions obtain there?—l do not know*
I have not been to Western Australia. ’
851. Are we justified in concluding from your evi-
dence that, to a great extent, we are growing tobacco
on areas that are not particularly suited to tobacco
culture?—We are growing tobacco in districts not
F. 218.—9
suited to the growing of the type of tobacco demanded
by manufacturers. We are not in the correct position
as regards soil and climate to produce the type of
tobacco required.
852. Would it be correct to say that because blue
nould is not epidemic, it is indemic?—Not at all.
853. Is your statement that there is no continuous
demand for Australian tobacco based on statistics sup-
plied by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,
showing the falling off in the sales of “Waratah”
tobacco?— The figures supplied by that company in-
dicate that there is no continuous demand for “Wara-
tah ” tobacco. The greater consumption of “ Waratah ”
tobacco in 1927 indicated that smokers were giving it
a trial. If they had liked it the sales would have been
maintained. That they have dropped suggests that the
tobacco did not meet with popular favour.
854, By Mr. Jones. —You say that holding leaf in
storage for a year or more before manufacture will
produce a certain amount of mellowness, but nothing
more; that it will not put in qualities that were not
there before storage. Do you refer merely to ageing
or to the scientific processing of tobacco?—l referred
to ageing. American leaf if purchased in the market
and manufactured immediately, has a nice aroma, but
it has also a certain scratchiness. If it is put away
for a time that scratchiness gradually disappears. Leaf
without that scratchiness is described as mature. Un-
less you have good quality leaf in the first instance, the
mere storage of it will not put into it the desired
qualities.
855. Does storage include processing?— No. The
bulk of the tobacco I saw in America was put into hogs-
heads, pressed down and placed in storage. Tobacco
as it comes straight from the market is something
like new wine; it requires to be kept for a time. Once
the public becomes accustomed to a certain brand of
tobacco or cigarettes, the manufacturer must take steps
to maintain the uniformity of the blend. No two
tobacco crops are alike. Consequently, he blends the
crops of three years, and thus maintains an even
quality.
856. You say that storage without scientific process-
ing will not put into tobacco qualities that were not
there before?— That is so.
857. Would storage with scientific processing put in
those qualities?— No.
858. Would storage remove any undesirable quali-
ties of tobacco?— Only the newness or rawness of the
tobacco.
859. Mr. Cameron in his report states that the twang
of Nyasaland tobacco may be eliminated by different
methods of curing. Would you say that the twang can
be removed by storage ?—I do not know. Mr. Hornby
(“Tobacco Culture in Nyasaland”) says that better
results are obtained from certain tobaccoes if they are
hung up to dry for a long time or by spreading the
curing process over a long period. I can understand
that, but I do not think the twang could be removed
after the leaf had once been strongly heated in a barn.
860. It has been suggested that there is a turpentine
flavour in Australian leaf. Could that be removed?
I do not know. In America, tobacco is grown on land
on which trees from which turpentine is obtained
formerly grew.
861. As the result of your experiments, are you con-
vinced that an undesirable aroma can be placed in
tobacco by digging eucalyptus leaves into the soil?—
Yes, when the tobacco is grown in sand.
862. If a certain aroma can be put in tobacco, is it
not possible that an aroma in tobacco could also be
removed ? That is what we were trying to ascertain
when we made the experiments. If we know the cause
of an aroma we may be able to find a remedy.


863. Were Mr. Tregenna’s experiments carried out
before the Bathurst experiments?— They were carried
out about the same time.
864. Was the suggestion that the unpleasant aroma
in Australian tobacco is due to eucalyptus heard of
before the Bathurst experiments?— Only since that time
so far as I know. I had been told that good tobacco
was not grown in Western Australia on eucalyptus
land; but I did not know whether that was so or not.
865. Would you say that smokers knew nothing of
any eucalyptus taint until the experiments were con-
ducted? —I do not remember any smoker ever suggest-
ing that he was smoking eucalyptus, nor do I say now
that he is doing so. I merely suggest that vegetable
organic matter in the soil may have an influence
on the aroma of tobacco. I believe that it was I who
suggested that eucalyptus might be the cause of the
aroma in Australian tobacco. If vegetable matter in
the soil does influence the aroma of tobacco, it is only
natural to inquire what is the prevailing vegetation
in Australia. There is no doubt that the characteristic
vegetation of Australia is the eucalypt, after which
comes the acacia. In our experiments we could have
used acacia leaves, but we chose eucalyptus. When
Mr. Tregenna, Mr. McGee and I, obtained different
results from tobacco seed grown in different soils, we
collaborated with a view to finding the reason.
866. You say that a large proportion of the tobacco
grown in Hew South Wales has a disagreeable aroma.
On pages 24 and 25 of Bulletin Ho. 2. of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, Mr. Slagg, dealing with the
smoking qualities of Australian tobacco, shows that
88 per cent, of bright thin tobacco grown in Victoria
and Hew South Wales has a mild, agreeable to passable
aroma, and bright mahogany, medium to heavy tobacco,
45 per cent, mild agreeable to passable aroma. He
also shows that the first type represented 4.48 per cent,
and the latter type 13.57 per cent, of the total tobacco
grown. Assuming that the quantity of those tobaccoes
was increased to 60 per cent. —which the growers say
they can produce—would you say that a large propor-
tion of our leaf would have a mild, agreeable aroma?
—That is more a question for Mr. Slagg, from whose
report you have quoted.
867. If the growers can produce 60 per cent, of
bright leaf, would you say that it would possess a mild
agreeable aroma?— Ho. Generally, the lighter the leaf
the better the aroma; but I could not say definitely
what the aroma would be, excepting that the tendency
would be to get a better aroma from the lighter leaf.
868. Do not Mr. Slagg’s figures give that indication?
—They indicate that there is a tendency for the aroma
to improve as the leaf becomes brighter.
869. Has the aroma of bright leaf grown in Australia
shown an improvement?— Yes, in some cases.
870. Would you say that, with the quantity of bright
leaf improving, the growers appear to be heading
towards greater prosperity ?—Yes, some of them.
871. Samples of Australian leaf were sent to England
in 1901 and 1902, The bright leaf brought higher
prices than American leaf of the same type. In 1921
the position was much the same. Although in the
latter instance the crop sold at Is. a lb., it was valued
by competent valuers at Is. 9d. a lb. Does not that
suggest that Australia ought to be able to grow suffi-
cient good quality leaf to meet her own requirements?
—Hot her present requirements.
872, Do you think it possible for Australia to supply
her own requirements of tobacco?—lt is possible. Hew
South Wales is six times as large as England, and
Queensland a good deal larger still. It should be
possible to find areas on which tobacco can be grown
successfully.. At present, however, we are not supply-
ing anything like our own requirements. Apparently
Australian smokers are prepared to consume only a
certain amount of Australian tobacco. If there was
a greater demand for our tobacco, it could be supplied.
873. Can you explain why the percentage of Aus-
tralian leaf in the blend increased from 7 per cent, to
over 12 per cent, in Western Australia, while it
decreased in Victoria?— Ho. It may be because there
is a man in Western Australia who is trying to estab-
lish the tobacco manufacturing business in that State.
His tobacco has a particularly good burn, which possibly
is acceptable to Western Australians,
874. Should it not be possible to do in the Eastern
States what is done in Western Australia?—l would
not say that it was either possible or impossible. The
average man in Australia can afford to be particular
about the tobacco he smokes. He is willing to pay a
little higher price for the tobacco that suits him. In
parts of Western Australia I imagine that there are
men who would be - prepared to accept an inferior
quality tobacco to what could be sold in Hew South
Wales.
875, By Mr. Martens. —Have you at any time stated
definitely that there is an eucalyptus taint in Aus-
tralian tobacco? —Ho.
876. By the Chairman. —You said that the results of
the investigation in relation to eucalyptus taint are
available. Have you any knowledge of the existence
of the report?— Yes.
877. Were you in charge of the experiments dealing
with eucalyptus leaves?— Ho. We decided to compare
the results of seed grown in American and Australian
soils. Mr. McGee, a highly-qualified tobacco expert
who was brought from American by the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, agreed with the idea.
The company brought out 9 tons of American soil
from a typical tobacco-growing area. The soil was care-
fully taken off inches at a time, so that it could
be put into pits exactly as it came from America. The
State of Hew South Wales afforded facilities at
Bathurst for the tests. The expenses were borne by
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. A decision
as to what should be done was made after discussion
by Mf. McGee, Mr. Tregenna and myself. At the
beginning of the next year the same three were in
charge of the operations; but before the year ended
the Australian Tobacco Investigation was inaugurated.
That body then became responsible for the experiments.
I took a lively interest in the matter; but the control
passed from one authority to another. At the end of
that year—l 928 —some adverse comments were made
about the conduct of the experiments. By that time
Mr. Slagg had been appointed. In explaining the posi-
tion to him I said that I wanted the experiments to be
continued; but that I did not want to have control of
them. From the end of 1928 to the present time Mr.
Slagg has been in charge of the investigations.
878. You were in charge of the experiments for one
year ?—I was not in charge; Mr. McGee was. I handed
over to Mr. Slagg because Mr. McGee had gone to
America.
879. Did Mr. McGee start his soil experiments in
1926?— Yes.
880. Did you and Mr. Tregenna collaborate with
him ?—Yes.
881. In the following year, as the result of a theory
advanced by Mr. McGee, you all collaborated in the
vegetation test? —I would not say that the theory was
put forward by Mr. McGee.
882. Was is put forward by Mr. Tregenna?—Ho.
The three of us discussed the matter, and our experi-
ments showed that different soils produced different
results. We then sought the explanation.
883. Was that the first time that the theory about
eucalyptus taint in tobacco was advanced?— Yes, so far
as my knowledge goes.


884. In the Progress Eeport of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, you refer to the residual effects
of fresh eucalyptus leaves added to river sand. What
do you mean by the residual effect?—ln 1927, into
a pit filled with sand, we dug a number of fresh
eucalyptus leaves. The tobacco grown in that pit was
tested at the end of the season. It had a distinctly
disagreeable aroma. The next year we decided to leave
the soil as it was; we put no fresh eucalyptus leaves
into the soil. At the end of the second year the
tobacco grown in the soil had a good aroma.
885. If the theory regarding the eucalyptus taint is
valid, is it not just as likely that, in the course of
time, the addition of eucalyptus leaves to the soil would
improve the aroma of tobacco ?—lf ,you were dealing
with sand, that theory would be justified.
886. Would we be justified in saying that, far from
being a fatal defect, the presence of eucalyptus in the
soil might improve the quality of tobacco?—l think
that would be going a bit too far. In our tests we
used river sand. At the end of the first year the
aroma of the tobacco was bad, and at the end of the
second year it had improved.
887. Would that improvement be due to the greater
maturity of the volatile oils in the soil?—lt might be.
Sandy soil into which a quantity of stable manure is
dug gives wonderful results for six months. In such
soil stable manure gives hardly any residual effect,
whereas in heavy soil its effect is much more lasting.
I am not prepared to say that, because we obtained
certain results with sand, we should get similar results
with heavy soil.
888. If you had continued the experiments for a
further year do you think you would have got still
better results?— The experiments are still going on. A
further year will not have passed until March, 1930.
889. Would we be justified in saying that paragraph
7 of the summary on page 56 of the Progress Eeport,
relating to the residual effects of eucalyptus leaves,
largely nullifies the conclusions reached in paragraphs
5 and 6?— l would not say that it nullifies them, but
that it renders the conclusions arrived at in paragraphs
5 and 6 rather abortive. In all experiments the
experimenter must keep on until he gets something
definite. In this case the results at the end of the
second year were different from those of the first.
890. Par from announcing that there is a eucalyptus
taint in Australian tobacco—a charge based on incom-
plete experiments—would it be fair to announce that
a continuation of the tests showed that "when eucalyptus
leaves w T ere added to the soil the aroma of Australian
tobacco improved?—l could not say that. The test
was conducted with river sand.
891. Have you heard of a preparation of 100 per
cent, pure eucalyptus which smokers are recommended
to add to their pipes of tobacco?— Ho.
892. What would you say if a manufacturer advised
smokers to add to their pipes some pure eucalyptus
leaves?—l could not tell the effect unless I smoked
the mixture. It is conceivable that the addition of
pounded eucalyptus leaves to a pipeful of tobacco
would improve the tobacco for some men. I could
not connect anything of that kind with the experiments
we have conducted.
893. By Mr. Temple Smith. —Would it be possible
to ascertain by a chemical analysis whether tobacco
leaf grown in average soil contained a percentage of
any element from the eucalypt?—lt is impossible to
tell by an analysis of tobacco leaf, either Australian
or American, exactly what the plant took up from the
soil.
894, Would it not be possible to find in the tobacco
leaf the element contained in the eucalypt leaf ?—lf, on
analysis, a tobacco leaf was found to contain a par-
ticular compound, you could not say definitely that
that compound was in the soil. Bu. dives, for instance,
contains phellandrene cineol and other compounds, but
it does not necessarily follow that those compounds are
in the soil in which the tree grows.
895, If the phellandrene which is in some eucalypts
were lound in the tobacco leaf by a chemical analysis,
would that not be a line to pursue as to any possible
taint of eucalypt in the tobacco ?—I do not think it
would be. It is conceivable that a tobacco leaf may
have phellandrene in it, although the tobacco has not
been grown in eucalypt soil.
896. Have you made any chemical analysis of tobacco
leaf along the lines I have suggested?— Ho.
897. A great deal of the tobacco grown in Victoria
is grown on land that has been cleared of eucalypt
for 20 or 30 years. Would you say that the soil is
still affected by the eucalypt which once grew in it?—
No. There seems to be a wrong impression about the
investigations we made. We did not deal with
eucalypts as determining aroma, but with vegetation as
a possible factor.
898. Land which has been cleared of eucalypts some-
times grows trefoil which is often turned in when the
land is ploughed for tobacco. Would it not be as
reasonable to accuse the trefoil as the eucalypt for the
unpleasant aroma in Australian tobacco ?—I have never
blamed the eucalypt for it.
899. The eucalypt has been blamed for it by an
expert ?—lf it was found that tobacco grown in a pit
into which trefoil had been dug had a worse aroma
than that of tobacco grown in pure sand, I should be
justified in saying that trefoil had an influence on the
aroma of tobacco. That is the only deduction I could
draw from the experiment.
900. Would you say that a skilled man would be
able to grade tobacco better than the average grower
can ?—Yes.
901. Would it not be possible to do in Australia
what is done in America, namely, have the tobacco
regraded, and sold by middle men?—ln America when
tobacco is taken to the conditioning plant of the middle
man, it is his property which he has bought; whereas,
in Australia, if the product of a number of growers
who had not sold their tobacco were taken to one
depot for regrading purposes, the tobacco would still
belong to a number of growers. In such circumstances
any damage caused to the leaf would probably give rise
to dissension and dissatisfaction.
902. By Mr. Slagg. —Have you seen large quantities
of tobacco sold on the American market?— Yes.
903. What proportion of dark tobacco that would
compare with the dark tobacco sold in Australia did
you see sold there?— Only 1 or 2 per cent.
904, And in the case of mahogany grades?— The
American and Australian standards are different.
What we in Australia call mahogany would be graded
as dark tobacco in America. Their mahogany is only
a little darker than the orange, whereas our mahogany
is distinctly brown. The colours vary with the types
of tobacco. When dealing with light aromatic flue-
cured tobacco, mahogany means anything with any
brown in it. When dealing with Burley tobaccoes,
which naturally are brown, mahogany means a dark
brown. When dealing with fire-cured tobacco,
mahogany would be a still darker grade.
905. What proportion of the leaf that you saw
sold in America would come in the class graded as
mahogany in Australia?— Hot more than 5 per cent.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.


{Taken at Sydney.)
FRIDAY, 31st JAHUABY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited;
Mr. C. M. Slagg, representing the Australian
Tobacco Investigation; Mr. Temple Smith,
of the Department of Agriculture, Victoria).
Charles Leslie Bentley, Director of the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd., was recalled and
further examined.
906. By the Chairman. —In your previous evidence
you said that the policy of your company had always
been to encourage the growing of Australian leaf along
proper and scientific lines. Will you explain what
steps your company has taken to carry out that policy ?
—I endeavoured to show what we had done when I
previously gave evidence. We have encouraged the
growing of fiue-cured tobacco with the object of pro-
ducing a lighter leaf, for we know that the objection
able characteristics of the heavier leaves are not so
predominant in the brighter types. We feel that Aus-
tralia should produce more and more light bright
leaf. The company also made funds available for
scientific investigation of the industry.
907. Is your company prepared to await the out-
come of the experiments now being conducted before
arriving at any final conclusion as to the future of the
Australian industry?— Hot altogether. The company
has purchased and used every pound of bright Aus
trail an leaf it could purchase. We have given growers
an undertaking to purchase their product at prices
which we consider are remunerative to them. We
offered to buy 1,350,000 lb. of bright leaf tobacco in
Victoria if we could get it; but we were unable to
obtain it.
908. Are we to assume that, irrespective of the result
of any experiments, your company is satisfied with the
commercial value of the bright Australian leaf as now
produced? —We are satisfied with it to the point to
which we have used it. It is a matter for the future
whether Australia will produce sufficient quantities of
bright leaf, and also to what extent the quality of the
leaf will improve, I believe that more suitable areas
for the growing of tobacco will be found and that the
quality of the leaf will improve.
909. Should more suitable areas not be found, is
your company prepared to continue buying bright
Australian leaf to the extent of 1,350,000 lb. annually?
—Hot necessarily.
910. What quantity would you buy ?—I can give no
undertaking.
911. Did your company tell the Tariff Board that it
was prepared to buy 1,500 tons of Australian leaf per
annum? —I do not know 1 .
912. Are we to regard the offer of the company as a
benevolent gesture to tide the growers over a period of
experimentation, rather than that you regard the leaf
as having a commercial value? —I would not say that.
I believe that the quality of Australian leaf wall
improve.
913. Would you describe your company’s offer as an
expression of its faith in the future of the industry?—
Yes.
914. I suppose your company would not be greatly
concerned if it could not get one pound of Australian
tobacco? —We could obtain it elsewdiere.
915. You say in September, 1923, the company noti-
fied the Tariff Board that it had made an offer to the
Hew South Wales Government to defray the expenses
of a field laboratory to enable tbe Government biologist
to conduct further experiments in the search for the
cause of the blue mould trouble. What became of that
offer?—lt was not accepted.
916. Were any reasons given?—l do not know of
any.
917. What were the terms of the offer?—l do not
know.
918. Did the company receive any reply?—l am not
aware, but I shall find out.
919. Have any other offers been made by your com-
pany to any State Government with a view to assisting
the scientific development of the tobacco industry?—
Apart from what I have already stated, I know of no
offer.
920. Then I take it that the only two offers made bj
the company were one to the Government of Hew
South Wales to establish a field laboratory, and the
other to the Federal Government to contribute to the
cost of experiments conducted under Federal direction?
—I think that is all.
921. Do you know whether any offers were made to
the Victorian Government?—l shall look further into
that matter.
922. Has your company taken any steps on its own
behalf to investigate the alleged eucalyptus taint in
Australian tobacco ?—Ho.
923. When was your company first advised that the
possible explanation of the defect in Australian leaf
was the existence of eucalyptus in the soil?— The first
intimation we received was a report on the investiga-
tions conducted by Mr. McGee, Mr. Tregenna, and Mr.
Darnell-Smith.
924. Did those three experts furnish their report to
your company ?—I am not sure about that. Mr. McGee
was employed by the company. Later, the Australian
Tobacco Investigation took over the experiments which
Mr, McGee, Mr. Tregenna, and Dr. Darnell-Smith
started.
925. I take it that the company then washed its
hands of the experiment?— Yes,
926. Did Mr. McGee remain in Australia for the
full term of his engagement?— Yes.
927, What was the purpose of bringing him here ?
To investigate the industry in Australia with a view
to advising how it could be improved.
928. Did he submit a report to your company before
he left Australia?— Yes.
929. Has that report been made public?— Ho. It
was a private report, submitted to the company by one
whom it employed.
930. I take it that Mr. McGee, when he left Aus-
tralia, handed over the whole of his work to the Federal
Investigation Committee?—l would not say that. He
left Australia for America, and the Commonwealth
Investigation carried on the experiments which he was
conducting.
931. Did Mr. McGee carry out any experiments?—
He had a number of experimental plots. In addition,
he visited and inspected farms in various districts such
as Tam worth, Tumut, and Myrtleford.
932. Would you say that the allegation of eucalyp-
tus taint in Australian tobacco was unknown to your
company until Mr. McGee suggested it?—l would not
say that it was Mr. McGee’s suggestion. I understood
Dr. Darnell-Smith in his evidence to say it was he
wdio first advanced the theory. My company does not
know who was actually responsible for the suggestion.
933. Did your company ever give any attention to
that aspect of the matter prior to the suggestion coming
from the three experts?— Hot to my knowledge.
. What steps have your company taken to inves-
tigate the correctness of the theory?— Hone.


935. Has your company been placed in possession of
any data in regard to the matter that has not been
made available to this committee? —Hot to my know-
ledge.
936, I take it that the company has an open mind in
the matter? —Yes.
937. Has your company intimated to growers that,
pending further investigation, they should not extend
the areas of tobacco under cultivation?— Hot to my
knowledge.
938, Is your knowledge confined to Victoria?—ln a
matter of such importance I should expect to know
about it whether the experiments were made in Vic-
toria or elsewhere. Mr. Beading, one of our directors,
had the direct handling of the matter. So far as my
knowledge goes, the company made no intimation to
the growers in that connexion.
939. Are we to assume that, in spite of the fairly
definite opinion of three experts as to the eucalyptus
taint in tobacco, your company has not allowed it to
affect its purchases of Australian leaf? —That is so.
940. Is your company prepared to buy in Victoria
alone 1,350,000 lb. of bright tobacco leaf, irrespective
of its aroma? —Yes. We have stipulated that the total
quantity must contain that large portion of bright leaf
tobacco, because its aroma is better than that of the
dark leaf.
941. You are really taking a chance on the colour?
—Yes.
942. Have you made any laboratory tests to deter-
mine the cause of the aroma?— Ho.
943. On what is the statement that Australian leaf
has an objectionable aroma based?—On the smoking
qualities of the tobacco and the demand of the public
for it.
944. Do you subject your tobacco to smoking tests
before placing it on the market?— Our experts test
it.
945. Then before it is placed on the market you
know that it has an objectionable flavour? —That is
so.
946. Does it not seem remarkable that your com-
pany will place on the market an Australian product
knowing that it has an objectionable aroma and that
it will probably not suit the public taste? —I do not
admit that. There is a certain sale for it.
947. Would it be fair to say that your company
is prepared to go to any length to show that Aus-
tralian smokers will not buy Australian tobacco ? —Ho.
There is a certain demand for it which w r e endeavour
to meet.
948. To what do you attribute the decline in the
demand for Australian tobaccos? —Wlien a new 7 line
is placed on the market, smokers give it a trial, but
if they do not like it, they will not continue to buy
it.
949. Does your company consistently advertise its
Australian brands of tobacco? —“ War at ah ” and
“ Signet ” brands have been well advertised.
950. Do you continue to advertise them until it is
evident that the demand is falling off? —If an article
which has been brought under the notice of the public
does not suit the public taste, all the advertising in the
world will not sell it.
951. Do you advertise American brands of tobacco
consistently?—We do so in the case of cigarettes;
but considering the extent of our sales, it can scarcely
be said that we are advertising any of our lines exten-
sively. We have done very little newspaper advertising
of our tobaccoes.
952. What lines have you advertised most exten-
sively during the last five years ?—'“ Champion ” and
#f Havelock ”.
953. Do you think that your policy of advertising
has had a great deal to do with the public demand
for certain tobaccoes? —I think that advertising helps
to maintain the demand for any brand of tobacco that
is acceptable to the public. Where a number of dif-
ferent brands are acceptable, the one which is best
advertised will probably have the greatest sale. But
advertising will not help to sell a brand of tobacco that
is not acceptable to smokers.
954. Has it been your experience that the moment
you cease to advertise an article, the demand for it
falls off?— Ho.
955. You think that a good article advertises itself?
—Yes. A new line must be well advertised for a few
months, but once it has taken on the advertising can
fall off.
956. If your company withdrew its advertisments
relating to “ Champion ” and “ Havelock ” tobaccoes,
do you think your sales would decrease ?—I do not think
so, so long as there was no other brand of tobacco of the
same quality available. If, however, a powerful com-
petitor advertised his tobacco extensively, we should
lose ground if our article was not as w r ell advertised
as his.
957. Has your company any such fear?— Yes.
Lately w 7 e have had to meet strong competition from
“ Edgeworth ” tobacco. Consequently w T e advertise
our “ Temple Bar ” brand extensively. It is difficult to
say wdiat effect advertising has on sales. Some of our
brands which are selling well are advertised very little.
958. What was the result of your advertising cam-
paign to combat the competition of “ Edgeworth ”
tobacco? —Very good.
959. Would you have such good results if your
“ Temple Bar” had not been advertised?— Ho. In
addition to the advertising, our sales were maintained
because “ Temple Bar ” sold at Is. 6d. as against
Is. lOd. for u Edgeworth”.
960. I take it that you are of the opinion that
advertising pays only -when you have a good article
to advertise?— Yes.
961. You say that your company has never had any
interest in tobacco-growing except in Australia. Does
that mean that as buyers of tobacco you are indepen-
dent?—We have our buying agents.
962. Do your buyers purchase tobacco as indicated
yesterday by Dr. Darnell-Smith ?—Yes. They buy in
open competition on the warehouse floor.
963. Would you say that every pound of tobacco you
get from America is purchased in open competition
with other buyers?— That is the case in respect of 90
per cent, or 95 per cent, of the tobacco we import
The balance is bought privately from dealers.
964. You say that it was v/ith a view to finding
a remedy for the difficulties which confronted the
tobacco industry in Australia that the Australian
Tobacco Investigation was formed, and that in the
opinion of the company a solution of those difficulties
can be found only by a series of experiments under the
supervision of experts who have knowledge of the grow-
ing of tobacco. Has your company taken any steps
to ascertain the qualifications of the tobacco experts in
Australia ?—Ho.
965. Would you accept them as experts because the
State Governments regard them as such?—We would
accept as experts men regarded as such by the State
authorities.
966. Is your company prepared to await the decision
of these experts no matter how long their experiments
take ?—The company feels that only by scientific inves-
tigation can the problems confronting the industry be
solved. In the meantime it is doing its best to
encourage the industry in Australia.


967. In view of the amount advanced by your com-
pany for experimental purposes, do you not think
it peculiar that it does not insist upon some supervision
of the work? —No. We must be very careful in these
matters. We do not want it to he said that the corn-
pany has in any way influenced the committee’s
decisions. Investigation is a matter for experts; the
company’s job is to supply the Australian demand.
The company is desirous of doing everything possible
for the Australian industry, and it is of the opinion
that the industry can flourish only with the assistance
of experts. To indicate how inadvisable it would be
for the company to be actively associated with the
experiments, I mention that many growers would be
pleased if the investigations were carried out without
any assistance at all from the company. My personal
view is that the company should be entirely discon-
nected from the experiments, which should be con-
ducted solely by the Federal authorities. The
company’s offer was made with a view to assisting the
Australian industry; it offered £50,000 if a suitable
tobacco-growing area could be found in Australia.
968. Has the Australian Tobacco Investigation
furnished your company with its various progress
reports?—l do not think so. Mr. Slagg’s report was
a complete surprise to the company. It was sent to
the company by post, Ido not think that the company
received the report earlier than any one else did.
969. Would your company take steps to place that
report before its own experts, asking them to make
comments to be forwarded to the Investigation Com-
mittee ?—The company would not attempt anything of
the kind.
970. company accepted the report irrespective
of whether it agreed with the conclusions of the experts
or not? —The company left the matter entirely in
the hands of the Investigation Committee. It has no
reason to doubt the scientific correctness of the com-
mittee’s conclusions. That does not mean that the
company would refuse to discuss with members of the
committee the extent to which its conclusions agreed
with the company’s experience.
971. If your experience did not agree with the con-
clusions of the experts, would you take any steps to
indicate to Mr. Slagg where you thought he was wrong?
—-Not officially, but we might discuss the matter with
him. The company has never attempted to interfere
with the scientific work of the experts.
972. I take it that the comnany is satisfied to pay
its money and await results ?—That is so.
973. You say that your company and its predecessors
have at different times by means of experimental
farms, and in various other ways, spent not less than
£75,000 in connexion with the cultivation of tobacco in
Australia. Is that the total amount that your com-
pany has expended in that direction ?—That would be
a safe assumption. That amount does not take into
account the huge stock of Australian tobacco which we
are carrving. Our direct expenditure has been not less
than £75.000; but indirectly we have probably spent
a great deal more.
974. With regard to the experiments at Texas, you
say that as you could not get an improved article, you
closed down the farm and sold it at a loss of £20,000
on that experiment alone. When was the farm closed
down?—ln 1915,
975. Would you say that the tobacco industry in
Australia has improved considerably since 1915?— We
have had fifteen years’ further experience. Probably
we would not now go to Texas if we decided to make
further experiments. The whole position has changed
during those fifteen years; and if we set out to do
something alone: similar lines now, we should probably
get better results.
976. By Mr. Jones. —Was it at Texas that 7 acres of
land recently produced tobacco to the value of £233
per acre?—l do not know; but I shall find out.
977. By the Chairman. —lf it is true that a Texas
farm such good results, does it not suggest
that the experimental farm there was rather before
its time?—l do not think so. Experiments have been
carried out in Australia for the last 30 or 40 years.
The outlook to-day is entirely different from what it
was, say, fifteen years ago. Personally, my outlook is
different.
978. view of the changed outlook, it would be
hardly fair to say that the Texas experiment showed
conclusively that good tobacco could not be produced
in Australia ?—At the time the statement was made,
the evidence was regarded as conclusive.
979. Would it necessarily be conclusive to-day?—
No. J
980. You say that about 1919 your company found
that sun-dried and air-dried leaf was proving increas-
ingly unusable, and that the company realized that,
if the tobacco-growing industry in Australia was to
become permanent, the leaf would have to be flue-
cured. Have the growers done their best to provide
flue-cured leaf?— Yes,
981. Is most of the tobacco you buy flue-cured?—
Yes.
982. Would you say that 90 per cent, of your pur-
chases comprise flue-cured tobacco?— Yes.
983. Seeing that Australian growers have, within
the last ten years, changed from air-drying to flue-
curing, does that not suggest that they are worth
encouraging?— Yes. My company has shown its appre-
ciation by the offers it has repeatedly made. Some of
the growers are most enterprising and worthy of assist-
ance.
984. You say, also, that the flue-curing process not
only produces a lighter leaf, hut that it also helps to
neutralize the unpleasant smoking characteristics in
Australian leaf to which the consumer takes exception.
Would you qualify that by saying “to which the
majority of consumers take exception”?—Only 2.74
per cent, of our trade is in all-Australian tobacco.
985. Is it correct that a considerable portion of your
tobacco is composite mixture?— Yes.
986. What percentage of Australian smokers are
smoking composite brands of tobacco ?—About 2.67 per
cent.
987. Then it would appear that about 5 per cent,
of Australian smokers smoke Australian brands of
tobacco?— That is so in respect of the products of our
company.
988. Would it be an extreme statement to say that
10 per cent, of the people of Australia are smoking
all-Australian and composite brands containing 20 per
cent. Australian tobacco?— Our sales for 1929 show
that a little over 5 per cent, were for brands of that
description.
989. Would you put the consumption of other Aus-
tralian tobaccoes at about 2 per cent.?—l should say
that 10 per cent, of the tobacco smoked in Australia
comprises all-Australian and composite brands of
tobacco.
990. When your company in 1919 advised growers
to flue-cure their tobacco, was there any condition as
to its aroma?— No. We got them to change over,
because we knew that the flue-curing process would
improve Australian tobacco.
991. Are you satisfied with what the growers have
done in that connexion?— Yes.
992. Since the change over to flue-curing was made,
condition you have imposed on growers is that
their tobacco must have an improved burning aroma?
—The question of an improved burning aroma has been


with us from the beginning. The great problem all
along has been to get an improved burning aroma and
a tobacco which will suit the public taste.
993. Can we assume that flue-curing will result in an
appreciable improvement in the burning aroma of
tobacco?— Flue-curing assists in that direction. It is
giving better results than were obtained under the old
sun-drying process.
994. Would you say that, apart from questions of
soil, and types of plant, flue-curing in itself neutralizes
the unpleasant smoking characteristics in Australian
leaf?— The brighter the leaf the less objectionable it
ia.
995. Do your buyers buy on colour?— Yes.
996. Does not that system place the grower at a
disadvantage, seeing that, in addition to colour, you
demand a good burning aroma?— There is no such
condition. We buy the leaf on its colour because we
know that the brighter the leaf the less objectionable
it will be in smoking quality. The buyer buys on
colour, texture and quality generally.
997. Then you cannot blame growers if they aim
at obtaining a brighter leaf and disregard other
characteristics?— That is so. After all, the judge of
tobacco is the smoker. Growers must endeavour not
only to get a good colour, but also an aroma which will
please smokers.
998. It would appear that the company is playing
with a double-headed penny. Theoretically, all it asks
of the grower is good quality; but actually it takes
into consideration other characteristics, such as the
aroma of the tobacco?—We have never imposed any
condition as to aroma in respect of bright leaf. We
have offered to purchase in Victoria alone 1,350,000 lb.
of that leaf each year. So far, the growers in that
State have not been able to produce that quantity, but
only about 250,000 lb. of bright leaf.
999. Supposing Victoria actually produced over
1,350,000 lb. of bright leaf in one year, w T ould your
company then say that the leaf was deficient in burning
aroma, and that it would not buy more than the
quantity contracted for?—lf, after say, ten years, it
was proved that the tobacco still had an aroma that was
not acceptable to Australian smokers, there would be
only one thing to do—discontinue manufacturing it.
But I do not anticipate that. If we have the will
to succeed, I feel sure that we shall do so.
1000. Would it be correct to say that up to the
quantity mentioned in the undertaking the company
will buy on colour, but that beyond that quantity
considerations of burning aroma would become pre-
dominant?— The question of burning aroma is in the
lap of the gods. The leaf must be improved. In my
opinion, that can be done only by scientific investiga-
tion, or, possibly, by growing tobacco in new areas. I
have sufficient faith in the industry to believe that
the present obstacles will be overcome. We must, how-
ever, proceed on proper lines and be prepared for
improvements to come gradually.
1001. Has it occurred to your company that, in the
event of supplies of tobacco from overseas being cut
off, you would, apart from stocks in hand, be dependent
on Australian-grown tobacco?— Yes. The company’s
definite policy is to establish the Australian tobacco-
growing industry on a satisfactory footing.
1002. At the outbreak of war in 1914 was your
company in a position to meet requirements for any
lengthy period?—We got through; but it was difficult.
1003. Did your company, during the Avar period, buy
all the Australian leaf it could obtain? —I do not know.
The company has always bought almost every pound
of Australian leaf available. It has, of course, rejected
inferior leaf.
1004. Is it a fact that, during the war period, your
buyer urged Australian growers of sun-dried leaf not
to waste a pound of it?—l do not know; but I can
understand his doing so.
1005. You say that in 1923 a large proportion of
the tobacco leaf grown in Australia was grown by
Chinamen on the share system. How many Chinamen
are working in the industry?— Our sales agreements
show that the registered growers in Hew South Wales
comprise 148 Britishers and 65 Chinese. The attached
statement gives the number of registered growers in
each State:—

1006. Has the proportion of Chinamen become less
since the growers adopted flue-curing?—l think so.
1007. Would it be correct to say that, prior to the
introduction of flue-curing, 90 per cent, of the tobacco-
growers of Hew South Wales were Chinamen? —-I shall
obtain the information.
1008. Would it be fair to say that the tobacco-
growing industry to-day is a Chinamen’s industry ?
Ho.
1009. Are Chinamen gradually getting out of the
industry?—l think so. I shall endeavour to obtain
figures showing the proportion of Chinamen engaged
in the industry both before and after the introduction
of flue-curing.
1010. Is it reasonable to assume that eventually it
will be entirely a white man’s industry I—l hope so. _
1011. Has your company considered the possibility
of the tobacco-growing industry absorbing a consider-
able amount of rural white labour ?-—The company
realizes that the satisfactory establishment of the in-
dustry would assist not only the company itself, but
also Australia as a whole.
1012. Has your company prepared any statistics
showing the average size of tobacco farms in Australia?
-—I do not know T .
1013. Do you regard it as a small man’s industry?
—Yes.
1014. Have you any knowledge of the proposal to
establish a big tobacco growing plantation in Queens-
land, by Pacific Plantations Ltd. ? —All I know about
it is what was contained in a newspaper cutting.
1015. Do you regard such an undertaking as some-
what risky at this juncture?— Yes. I would not put
my own money into it.
1016. Would you regard the £7,602 advanced by
your company to growers for the erection of flue-curing
barns, as only a small percentage of the amount actually
invested in barns?— Yes.
1017. Did the growers generally avail themselves
freely of your company’s offer?— Ho. It was made
particularly to necessitous growers.


1018. You say that if, at the expiration of the three-
year period, developments are sufficiently encouraging
to warrant further efforts, and additional expenditure
Is considered necessary or desirable, the company will
provide a further £30,000 conditionally upon the Com-
monwealth and/or State governments providing a simi-
lar amount. On what basis will the company deter-
mine whether the results are sufficiently encouraging
to warrant further effort? —It will take the figures
available and the reports of its buyers and study them,
1019. You said previously that the company was
taking no steps to keep in touch with the experiments?
—The two statements are not contradictory.
1020. I take it that at the end of three years the
company will take all matters into consideration and
form its own conclusions?— Yes.
1021. You say that the company has not taken ad-
vantage of its position as chief buyer of leaf in Aus-
tralia; that indeed, it has gone further than could
reasonably have been expected of it, with the result that
it has on its hands leaf which it is unable to use,
Would those stocks of unusable leaf have any con-
siderable bearing on the company’s finances?—We have
large stocks of dark Australian leaf which we cannot
use.
1022. You say that prior to 1895 the Australian
smoker had already shown his preference for American-
grown leaf. Do you think that the inherent prejudice
of many Australians to Australian articles accounted
for that?—l do not think so.
1023. What was the idea of the company in offering
bonuses to the growers of bright leaf?—We desired to
encourage growers to produce the kind of leaf we
wanted. At first the bonus was 3d. per lb.; subse-
quently it was raised to 6d., and later to Is. per lb.
1024. Has the bonus stimulated growers to produce
brighter leaf?— Yes.
1025. Do you agree with the growers at Wangaratta
that the company’s heavy purchases of dark leaf
accounted largely for the slow development in the pro-
duction of bright leaf?— Ho. I contend that the com-
pany has for years been warning growers against grow-
ing dark leaf. Apart from refusing to buy dark leaf,
the company has done everything possible to dis-
courage its production.
1026, Then you do not agree with witnesses who
stated that the company is responsible for the continued
production of dark leaf?—Ho,
1027. You do not see any connexion between the price
paid for dark leaf and the desire of growers to produce
it?—We want an article which is demanded by con-
sumers, and have been trying to assist growers as well
as to establish the industry on a sound basis. The com-
pany chose the less of two evils.
1028. You say that the explanation of the smokers’
attitude is that he does not like the unpleasant charac-
teristics of the Australian-grown leaf. How did the
company arrive at the conclusion that Australian
tobacco is unpleasant?—By testing it and by a study of
the sales.
1029. Is the company convinced that it is un-
pleasant?— Yes,
1030. Is that its opinion in spite of evidence that
a certain number of smokers like it?— The opinion of
the company coincides with that of 97 per cent, of that
of the smokers of Australia.
1031. Then /he company is definitely of the opinion
that, irrespective of the improvements caused by flue-
curing, Australian tobacco is unpleasant?— Yes. The
dark tobacco is more unpleasant than the lighter types.
1032. In the statement previously submitted you
quote from the report of the Tariff Board in 1926 as
follows:—“ Tim Tariff Board has not the slightest
doubt from its investigations confirmed by its own ex-
perience, that the statements made by Dr. Darnell-
Smith, Messrs. Howell, Stevenson and others, are accu-
rate, and that the burning aroma of the average
Australian tobacco is unpalatable and offensive ”. Do
you agree with that statement ?—I would say that cheap
dark Australian tobacco is objectionable and offensive,
but I would not say so of the average Australian
tobacco.
1033. You say that your company has always en-
deavoured to take the long view in connexion with the
industry. What do you mean by that? —I mean that
the company is out to stop the production in Australia
of leaf that is unsuitable and unsaleable, and to pro-
mote the growth of brighter and better leaf. It does
not take a provincial view in relation to the areas in
which tobacco shall be grown, but is looking for places
with the proper climate and other characteristics suit-
able for tobacco culture, irrespective of State boun-
daries. The company also believes that the success of
the industry depends upon careful scientific investiga-
tion.
1034. Can we take it that the company’s ultimate
object is that the whole of Australia’s tobacco require-
ments shall be produced in this country?— That is an
ideal which any Australian ought to have; but its
attainment is a long way off. In any case, it is not
likely that Australia will ever produce 100 per cent,
of her tobacco requirements.
1035. It is only 25 years since the people of Aus-
tralia first believed that we could make anything in
this country. Do you think that in another 25 years
we shall be producing all our requirements of tobacco ?
—There will always be a quantity of tobacco imported
for blending; but apart from that I think it would
be rather optimistic to expect us to produce all our
requirements in 25 years.
1036. You state that the company is definitely of
the opinion that the control of the industry should be
in the hands of the federal authorities?— That is so.
The matter is so important that it should not be deter-
mined on the basis of State boundaries. We should
find the best place in Australia for tobacco-growing,
regardless of State considerations.
103 i • Can you suggest any scheme of Commonwealth
supervision?—l have not thought of that.
1038. Do you think that the Commonwealth should
work in conjunction with the States?— Yes. That is
done in America.
1039. Do you think that by abolishing the excise duty
on Australian leaf a cheaper article would be placed
on^ the market?—l do not think that tariff adjustments
will help. The present price inducement should be
sufficient. Pure Australian tobacco is sold for from
to ss. 6d. a lb,, as against Bs. lid. a lb. for
Havelock ”. I think that the margin is sufficient to
encourage a demand for Australian tobacco.
1040. I hand you two samples of tobacco of “ 888 ”
brand. Are they 100 per cent. Australian ?—The dark
sample is all-Australian tobacco, and the lighter sample
about 93 per cent. Australian.
, IC4I. Mould you say that on appearance alone thev
should sell well?— Yes, J
1042. If tobacco of those types were placed on the
maiket at haif the price of the best American tobacco,
do you think there would be a good demand for it?—’
They are on the market at practically that price now
i mrk plug “ 888 ” is sold at lOd. for a 2-oz. block
as against Is. 3d. for a 2-oz. block of “Havelock’’
tobacco, while /he 4-oz. blocks are sold at Is. 7d. and
2s. 6d., respectively.
1043. If “ 888 ” tobacco were sold at Is. per 4-oz,
n °t /he demand for it increase consider-
duly i Ido not think the result would be very different
from what it is now.
1044. Has this brand been extensively advertised by
your company?—lt is really a private brand.


1045. Do smokers generally know that “ 888 ”
tobacco can be obtained at comparatively cheap rates?
—That is more a question for the retailers to answer.
We prepare a number of cheap tobaccos for different
traders.
1046. Is there a steady demand for that tobacco in
Victoria?— The demand is decreasing.
1047. By Mr. Jones. —Would you say that “ 888 ”
tobacco improves with age ?—After about a month it
does not change greatly.
1048. Were your experiments at Texas satisfactory?
—No.
1049. You say that, with a view to encouraging
growers to improve the quality of their leaf by giving
them a definite and assured market for it, the company
has offered to purchase tobacco at prices which ad-
mittedly are highly remunerative to the growers. One
grower, who received 3s. 3d. a lb. from your company
for his leaf last year, was not made an offer at all
this year. Has he an assured market for his product?
—Without having the particulars of his case I am
unable to deal with it definitely, but I assume that his
leaf this year was either inferior or badly graded.
1050. Would you regard Mr. Marks as a competent
grader ?—Yes.
1051, The grower referred to said that Mr. Marks
valued his crop at 2s. 3d. per lb,, but that your com-
pany would not make him an offer for it?—l suggest
that our buyer be asked to answer that question.
1052. Do you not think that the uncertainty as to
the disposal of their crops is a deterrent to growers?—
I do not think so. There is of course the possibility
of grower and buyer placing different values on a
crop. The disposal of a crop is largely a matter of
good faith based on the standing of the company.
1053. Who has admitted that the prices paid to
growers are highly remunerative ?—The growers them-
selves have stated that they would be w T ell satisfied to
get 2s. a lb. all round for their tobacco. The mini-
mum price for bright leaf is 2s. a lb., plus Is. bonus —
a total of 3s. a lb. If they can, as is alleged, produce
60 per cent, of bright leaf, for which the minimum
price is 3s. a lb., and can obtain Is. 6d. a lb. for the
dark and mahogany type, comprising the remaining
40 per cent, their average would be over 2s. a lb.
1054. Have you any figures to show the average price
paid for the tobacco purchased by your company?—lt
was Is. 9i|d, a lb. If the growers produce a fair pro-
portion of bright tobacco, then their receipts must be
regarded as highly remunerative. Supposing they pro-
duced 50 per cent, bright and 50 per cent, dark leaf,
for which they receive 3s. and Is. 6d. a lb., respectively,
that would average 2s. 3d. a lb., which the growers
themselves admit is satisfactory.
1055. Would you say that the growers regard the
prices paid to them as being highly remunerative?—
—Probably they would not admit it. Ho seller ever
admits that the prices he receives are good.
1056. By Mr. Tully. —Would they get as much as
Is. 6d. a lb. for their dark leaf?— For mahogany they
would get 2s. 2d. a lb. If they had 33 per cent, of
mahogany they would receive on an average Is. Bd.,
plus 3d. I think Is. 6d. a lb. is a conservative basis.
1057. My Mr. Jones. —lt appears that only the com-
pany admits that the prices paid are highly remunera-
tive? —It is admitted by most people other than the
growers.
1058. Having heard the evidence of the growers,
would you say that they regard the prices as remunera-
tive?— With one exception, the growers at Wangaratta
agreed that 2s. u lb. all round would be remunerative.
They also said that they could grow 60 per cent, of
bright leaf. If they can do so, they will receive 2s.
a lb. on an average. I would not expect any grower
to admit that the prices he receives are good.
1059. In its report for 1926, the Tariff Board says,
“ It is useless and hopeless to expect that any greater
quantity of the Australian leaf can be incorporated in
the manufactured tobacco than is done at the present
time.” Do you agree with that view? —Yes, at the time
it was written. The last four years have shown an
improvement.
1060. In the Progress Deport of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation it is stated, “It is hoped to
improve the quality and increase the quantity of home-
grown taken for manufacture until at least the major
part of the cured leaf used in Australian factories will
be grown in Australia. Do you agree with that?—l
agree with that hope. For the industry to prosper w r e
must have hope, faith, and the wull to prosper.
1061. But the Tariff Board said the outlook was
hopeless?—At that time it was hopeless.
1062. Would you say it is hopeless now? —We have
improved considerably during the past four years, and
the position is not now hopeless. In making its report
the Tariff Board was probably influenced by the tre-
mendous proportion of dark leaf then being produced.
The hope of the industry lies in the brighter types.
1063. The Progress Report also states that the
tobacco-growing industry is languishing?—l can hardly
agree with that statement. A person viewing the farms
in the Myrtleford district would bardly say that the
industry was languishing.
1064. Is Sir Hugh Denison a shareholder in your
company?—l think he holds some shares in it.
1065. Do you think that Australian leaf of suitable
quality will be grown in sufficient quantities to meet
Australia’s requirements?—l have already given my
view's in that connexion. In my opinion the solution
lies in tbe elimination of the grades that are not wanted
by smokers and are not susceptible to improvement,
and tbe production of increasing quantities of flue-
cured bright tobacco gradually improving until the
aroma is more acceptable to smokers.
1066. Do you think that the abolition or reduction of
the excise duty on Australian leaf would be to the
advantage of growers, manufacturers, and consumers?
—Ho. Any advantage would be so small as not to
justify a fiscal alteration.
1067. Would it be an incentive to growers to produce
more tobacco?— Ho. I take it that the benefit would
accrue to the smokers.
1068. Would it be an inducement to manufacturers
to purchase Australian bright leaf instead of Ameri-
can ? —We cannot offer any greater inducements to
Australian groovers than we are now offering.
1069. Would it obviate the necessity of increasing
the price to the consumers?—lf the excise duty were
reduced to-morrow we would reduce the price to the
smoking public.
1070. By Mr. Morgan.— You say that the policy of
your company has always been to encourage the grow-
ing of Australian leaf along proper and scientific lines.
Does that mean that hitherto we have not proceeded
along proper and scientific lines?— Yes. We are getting
experience as we go on. The prospects are brighter
now than they were.
1071. Would you say that to some extent we have
been groping in the dark in the past?— Yes.
1072. Is it likely that scientific research will indicate
that our activities should be transferred to other areas?
—I think so.
1073. On the basis of existing facts, where do you
think those areas will be found?—lf the problem is
ever solved, I believe it will be solved by Queensland.
The climate and soil of Queensland will produce the
best percentage of bright leaf such as is grown in
Carolina and Georgia. That really is a matter for
experts.


1074. What proportion of the tobacco consumed in
Australia does your company supply?—l shall obtain
the information for the committee.
1075. By Mr. Martens. —There is a small quantity
of air and sun-dried tobacco grown in Australia.
Where is it grown, and by whom?—lt is grown in the
Texas and Inglewood districts, chiefly by Chinese.
1076. Who are the manufacturers of “ Country Life ”
cigarettes?—W. D. and H. O. Wills—one of our
companies.
1077. What would be the effect if cigarettes of Aus-
tralian tobacco were similarly advertised?—l do not
think it would be successful at present. Australia has
not yet reached the stage when satisfactory cigarettes
of Australian tobacco can be made. The palate is
more susceptible to cigarettes than to tobacco. The
first essential is to have a good article to advertise.
1078. Do you pay 2s. a lb. for all bright leaf
tobacco?— That is our minimum price for that type.
1079. One witness at Wangaratta said that although
he produced 60 per cent, of bright leaf, his crop
averaged less than 2s. a lb.?—l feel inclined to con-
tradict his statement. If it is correct I should say
that his leaf was inferior or badly graded.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Sydney.)
SATURDAY, Ist FEBRUARY. 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones j Mr. Morgan
Mr, Martens j Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd.; Mr, C. M. Slagg,
representing the Australian Tobacco Investigation;
Mr. Temple Smith, tobacco expert of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, Victoria.)
Herbert William Gepp, Chairman of the Development
and Migration Commission, and Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation, was called, sworn and examined.
1080. By the Chairman.—r-1 understand that you
have been in control of the Federal Tobacco Investiga-
tion?— Yes, as chairman of the Executive Committee
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, a body which
is not directly connected with the Development and
Migration Commission.
1081. Will you explain the procedure adopted by the
Development and Migration Commission to bring
into existence the Australian Tobacco Investigation?—
The first I heard of the willingness of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company to contribute towards
the investigation of the tobacco industry was an inter-
view 7 which the then Chairman of the Tariff Board,
Mr. Hudson, had with me in August, 1926. Mr!
Hudson said that in giving evidence before the Tariff
Board Mr, Reading, a director of the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company, offered on behalf of the
company a contribution of £50,000 on a £1 for £1
basis towards a solution of the problems confronting
the tobacco-growing industry, Mr. Hudson said that
he thought it was a matter which ought to be investi-
gated by the commission. I mentioned the matter to
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. In
1927 negotiations entered into with Mr. Reading,
and arrangements were made for the investigation to
be conducted.
1082. Did you receive any communication from the
then Prime Minister, Mr. Bruce, initiating the move'
ment, or did it arise solely as a result of negotiations
between yourself and Mr. Beading?—So far as I know,
the first action of the Commonwealth Government was
its approval to the scheme which we had initiated,
and concerning which I had kept Senator Sir George
Pearce, the ministerial head of the department,
acquainted.
1083. I take it that you would not initiate a scheme
which would involve the Government in considerable
expense without first ascertaining the views of the
Government on the matter?— That is so.
1084. Can we take it that on your return to Aus-
tralia in 1927, you consulted with the executive of the
Development and Migration Commission, and then
brought the matter before Senator Sir George Pearce?
—That is my recollection of what took place.
1085. Is it correct to say that before any definite
undertaking was entered into with the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company the Government had approved
ot the proposal to join with the company in carrying
out investigations?— Yes. The investigations were
undertaken with the full support of Sir George Julius,
Chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, who was consulted from the beginning bv
me, and who assisted in negotiating the details. The
whole negotiations were subject to the approval of the
Commonwealth Government. Indeed, nothing could
be done without the Government’s financial assistance.
I thought that the tobacco company should contribute
more than one-half of the cost. It was on my sugges-
tion that they offered to pay £30,000 as against £20,000
by the Government, instead of each paying an equal
share.
1086. Do you know of any condition made by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, that in con-
sideration of its assistance, the Government should
agree that there would he no alteration in the tariff
schedule then existing until the experiments were con-
cluded? —There was no such condition. Indeed, the
only condition imposed by the company was that it did
not wish to be represented on the executive, because its
directors felt that the company should be free from
the charge that it in any way influenced the policy of
the committee. The British-Australasian Tobacco
Company made it clear from the beginning that the
policy to be adopted was to be the policy of the
executive uninfluenced in any w r ay by the company. 1
mean the executive of the Tobacco Investigation which
was appointed by the Government on our recommenda-
tion.
1087. What is the personnel of that executive?—
The executive comprises Dr. Rivett, Deputy Chairman
and full-time chief executive officer of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, a highly scientific
man, trained in research, and one of the finest scientists
in Australia; Dr. Cameron, representing the States,
and Chairman of the Agricultural Advisory Committee
attached to the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, the members of which are the directors or
Under-Secretaries of Agriculture in the States; Dr.
DarnelTSmith, Director of the Botanic Gardens,
Sydney, a man with previous tobacco experience, nomi-
nated by the Hew South Wales Department of
Agriculture; and myself. We still comprise the
executive.
1088, I take it that the whole responsibility for the
investigations rested on those four men?— Yes.
Neither the Development and Migration Commission
nor the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
has any influence or direction as an organization upon
the investigation.
1089. To whom is the Tobacco Investigation respon-
sible? We report to the Minister. When we wanted
to appoint Mr. Slagg, I took the papers to Senator


Sir George Pearce, at that time the Yice-President
of the Executive Council. Dr. Rivett accompanied me.
Our recommendation was approved and Mr. Slagg was
appointed.
1090. Tobacco-growers at Wangaratta claim that
they should have had representation on the Executive
Committee. Can you say why they were not granted
representation ?—I fancy that that matter was dis-
cussed by the Tobacco Executive after its appointment,
and that it was felt that it would be difficult to get
a man representative of all the growers. We were
afraid that local interests might predominate. I have
had 35 years’ experience in technical and experimental
work, and I felt that it would be better to establish an
organization and gradually build up a connexion with
representatives of the growers in the various districts,
rather than that the growers should be directly repre-
sented on the executive. We regarded the work as
being of a scientific nature. Personally lam confident
regarding the future of the industry; I feel sure that
Australia will eventually grow her own requirements
of tobacco. I am not opposed to a representative of
the growers being on the committee, but I do not want
an unwieldy committee. If a grower truly representa-
tive of growers generally can be obtained, I would offer
no objection to his appointment.
1091. Were any steps taken to see whether such a
man existed?— Ho. I felt that it was best for us to
determine our general policy first. Only comparatively
recently have we got properly into our stride. The
four men I have mentioned comprise the Board of
Directors. They are all skilled men in their own
spheres, but wdth the exception of Dr. Darnell-Smith,
they are not skilled in tobacco matters. Then there is
the Director. There is also a Research Committee,
including Mr. Slagg and Dr. Dickson of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research, a number of
field officers, an expert recently brought from South
Africa, and after that, there is the organization in each
State. That organization has taken some time to
build up. I felt that there was no greater need to
have a representative of the growers on the Tobacco
Executive than there would be to have a representative
of the pastoralists on a committee wdiich may be
investigating black disease in sheep. The work is one
for scientists; but that does not mean that they will
not consult with tobacco-growers in the one case or
sheep-producers in the other case.
1092. The growers contend that the problems of the
industry might be more easily solved if the committee
had the aid of the knowledge and experience of the
growers themselves? —I expected that the Director
would give us that information. We have been in
consultation with the State experts and have had advice
from the several State departments. Moreover, there
has been continuous consultation between the growers
and the Director. The growers at Wangaratta have
expressed their confidence in the Director.
1093. Are you prepared to reconsider the question
of granting the growers representation on the executive ?
—I have no objection to the growlers being represented;
but I think their representation should be confined to
one member.
1094. If the growers can nominate a suitable man,
are you prepared to re-open the question?—As chair-
man of the executive committee I am willing, but I
cannot speak for my colleagues. I could put the matter
before the executive. Personally, I should welcome
such representation.
1095. Apart from the scientific aspect of the work,
what organization has been created by the Tobacco
Executive? —We have a small organization which is
functioning under the executive which is responsible to
the Minister. The executive receives reports from the
director from time to time but it does not deal with
the details. Its control is confined to the broad lines
of policy. With the exception of Dr. Darnell-Smith,
who receives £250 per annum as a technical director
to assist Mr. Slagg, the members of the executive com-
mittee receive no remuneration from the Tobacco
Executive.
1096. Does Dr. Darnell-Smith collaborate with Mr.
Slagg in the direction of the work? —He is a consul-
tant.
1097. Does that mean that Mr, Slagg is bound to
confer with Dr. Darnell-Smith on all matters of im-
portance?— Hot on all matters.
1098. Has Mr. Slagg a discretionary power in the
matter?— Dr. Darnell-Smith attends all meetings of the
executive. He gets copies of the reports from the
director, and may at any time send a memorandum to
the director.
1099. Can Dr. Darnell-Smith veto any of the
decisions of Mr. Slagg?—Ho; but as a member of the
executive he can say what he likes.
1100. Is Mr. Slagg handicapped in any way by local
expert opinion?— Ho. As chairman, I give every one
the freest run possible. I always pick my men care-
fully. I expect them to understand their job. I then
leave it to them to carry out the policy approved by
myself, or by my colleagues and myself. If I am not
satisfied with a man’s work, I do not retain him.
1101. Is Dr. Darnell-Smith really a servant of the
executive?—He is a technical member of the executive
who gives more time to tobacco matters than do the
other members.
1102. Would you say that Dr. Darnell-Smith is a
co-director with Mr. Slagg?—Ho. There is only one
director—Mr. Slagg. Dr. Darnell-Smith advises and
consults. I asked him to accompany Mr. Slagg to
Queensland. He will probably accompany him to
Bathurst also.
1103. Does Dr. Darnell-Smith carry out any investi-
gations independently of Mr. Slagg?—He must consult
with Mr. Slagg.
1104. Is it essential for Mr. Slagg to consult with
him?— Hot in regard to all the details. I look to Dr.
Darnell-Smith to express his views, and I expect Mr.
Slagg to consult with Dr. Darnell-Smith on all matters
of broad principle.
1105. Would it be fair to say that Bulletin Ho. 2,
purporting to be issued by Mr. Slagg, is actually the
joint work of Mr. Slagg and Dr. Darnell-Smith?—lt is
Mr. Slagg’s work, but copies of his report were sent to
each member of the executive before it was published.
1106. Was Mr. Slagg’s report approved by Dr. Dar-
nell-Smith before publication ?—lt was approved by
each member of the executive.
1107. Supposing Dr. Darnell-Smith disagreed with
Mr. Slagg’s conclusions, would that nullify the work
of Mr. Slagg ?—I might disagree with Mr. Slagg regard-
ing some detail in his report, but I would not consider
that sufficient justification for withholding publication
of the report. If it was a matter of importance, I, as
a non-expert in tobacco, would ask for further in-
formation.
1108. Dr. Darnell-Smith’s name does not appear on
the pamphlet. Would the Tobacco Executive have
authorized publication of the pamphlet had Dr, Darnell-
Smith strongly disapproved of Mr. Slagg’s conclusions ?
—I should say not, until there w T as a thorough investi-
gation. If any member of the executive offered strong
objections to the conclusions, a record of his objections
would be kept. I hold Mr, Slagg responsible for the
views contained in Bulletin Ho. 2.
1109. How is the work of the committee financed?—
We draw as required upon the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company for £2,000 at a time, and propor-
tionately on the Commonw T ealth Government. The


Commonwealth Government receives a certain sum
per annum from each of the State Governments except
Tasmania.
1110. Do all the States pay the same amount?— Yes.
At a conference of Ministers of Agriculture, I urged
the States to contribute equally to the work. The
governmental contribution is paid half by the Com-
monwealth Government and the other half by the State
Governments between them. The secretary of the com-
mittee, Mr. S. Fowler, is a member of the staff of the
Development and Migration Commission.
1111. Outside Melbourne, has any organization been
created by the Tobacco Executive?—At Mareeba, in
Queensland, we have a field supervisor in the person
of Mr. Howell. He has four or five men under him,
and he engages casual labour from time to time.
1112. Do the persons whose names appear on the
cover of the Bulletin comprise the whole of the staff
employed by the tobacco investigation?— They com-
prise the full-time staff; that is, all except steno-
graphers and casual employees.
1113. Have any steps been taken by the executive to
establish branches in other States?—ln Western Aus-
tralia there is also a field supervisor, Mr. Limmer, who
takes his instructions from Mr. Sutton, the State Direc-
tor of Agriculture. In South Australia, we work in
consultation with Professor Perkins, the State Director
of Agriculture. In Queensland, the work is being done
in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and
the permanent officers of the department in the area
where investigations are being carried out. We felt
that it would be unwise to build up a separate organiza-
tion wdien the State departments already existed.
1114. Have you taken any steps to continue the ex-
periments previously conducted? —Yes. I am now pre-
paring a report on the -work which has been done up
to date, and a recommendation that the work should
continue. The three-year period was based on the
£50,000 allocated for the work. The expenditure to
date is a good deal less than the amount provided.
Recommendations will be made that the Avork continue
along the same lines as heretofore.
1115. What would happen in the event of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company not agreeing to make
any further contributions ?—The governments of the
Commonwealth and the States would have to decide
Avhat should be done.
1116. Some growers consider that the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company should not contribute to the
cost of the investigations?— That is a natural feeling,
but it is not justified. It would be a tragedy to dis-
continue the Avork. Should the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company offer no further assistance, the con-
tinuation of the Avork would simply mean that the
several GoAmraments Avould have to pay more.
1117. Do you see any disadvantage in the association
of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company with
the experiments ?—Yone Avhatever. The company’s con-
tribution was made without any condition being im-
posed. I go further and say that if the company
attempted to impose conditions, I would tell it plainly
that the suggestion Avas entirely out of order and would
not be tolerated. I feel sure that the company would
not attempt to make any condition.
1118. Are you faAmrable to the company continuing
its contribution?— Yes.
1119. Do you think there is any fear that the com-
pany’s participation is not in the interests of the
growers?— There are no grounds for any such fear.
Had I not been so overloaded with work, I had in-
tended to visit each of the growing areas to talk matters
over with the groAvers. I shall do so at the first oppor-
tunity.
1120, Have you formed any opinion as to the period
which it will take to complete the investigation?—As a
result of my experience in research, I estimate a period
of ten years. To solve the major problems will pro-
bably take less than ten years; but after they have been
solved there will be a good deal of steady routine work
to be done. I have no doubt as to the ultimate success
of the investigations.
1121. Would you recommend the establishment of
a permanent department of federal investigation into
the tobacco industry similar to that in the United States
of America?— Ultimately that could be done; but I
strongly recommend that the organization be left as it
is until the major problems have been solved.
1122. You think that eventually the present organ-
ization could merge into a federal department?—lt
would, in time, become an ordinary research depart-
ment of the Government, under the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, but I strongly urge
that the organization be left a.s it is for the present.
After the major problems have been solved it could be
handed over.
1123. You referred to a report about to be presented
to the Federal Government. Will that be a later report
than the progress report recently handed to us by Dr.
Rivett?—lt will be a fresh report similar to the other.
1124. By Mr. Jones. —Your investigation committee
sent samples of Australian tobacco to the Imperial In-
stitute. Do you know of any other samples having
been sent?— Some years ago Victoria sent some samples,
the results of which were satisfactory.
1125. Were not two lots sent?—l do not knoAv. I
sent samples because I Avas desirous of getting an in-
dependent opinion. Duplicate and triplicate samples
are still in stock in Melbourne. We took precautions to
see that only one man in London had a key to the
samples.
1126. Should not the committee have had the reports
on the samples previously sent?— Dr. Cameron is on
the executive committee. The previous samples w’ere
sent so many years before that I do not think they
were considered to be of great importance.
1127. Were the reports on the Victorian samples
favorable?—l think so.
1128. And were the reports on the samples you sent
unfavorable ? I would not say that. They varied.
Full details are aA’ailable for inspection and study.
1129. One grower informed us that a theory noAV
being investigated by your committee Avas exploded by
him years ago ?—Before I could say anything about
that matter I should want to knoAV Avhat the theory is.
I am not an expert in tobacco, but I have had con-
siderable experience in research, and my vieAV is that
no theory or hypothesis which has any possibility of
success should be rejected. EA*ery matter must be in-
vestigated from every possible standpoint in order to
make certain that nothing is missed. Even where one
member of the executive has been disinclined to follow
a certain line, I urged that that line be followed
in order that may be perfectly sure that we are
coA r ering the Avhole ground.
1130. When the investigation committee Avas being
formed, do you not think that experienced groAA T ers
should have been consulted in order to obtain the
benefit of their experience?—We did consult them.
A special committee Avas sent around Australia to
obtain information from the growers. My idea of that
survey party Avas that it should collect the accumulated
knowledge obtainable in Australia, so that the time of
the director, when he arrived, would be saved. With
that information before him the director would have
something to go on, and he could then make more
detailed investigations where he considered it advisable.


1131. Do you think that the results of the investiga-
tions now being conducted will eventually be success-
ful? —I have no doubt about it; but it will take time.
I went to Broken Hill in connexion with an experi-
mental flotation process. Our investigations took five
years before the process returned one penny profit.
My experience in Tasmania was much the same. That
was the case in connexion with one comparatively
simple process where the problems were concentrated.
The problems confronting the tobacco industry are
much more complex; we have to take into consideration
all kinds of tastes, climate, and soil. The work will
take time. Ninety per cent, of research work is
negative; the other 10 per cent, is the dividend.
1132. Except for a small percentage of choice
tobacco, desired by fastidious smokers, do you think
that in time Australia will be able to grow all the
tobacco she requires?— Yes, particularly by blending.
I am hopeful that by blending tobaccoes grown in the
northern and the southern districts, the most satisfac-
tory results will be obtained.
1133. In the meantime would you advise growers to
go in for more extensive cultivation?— Yes, so long as
they grow light-coloured tobacco. They should keep
in touch with the requirements of the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company and others.
1134. Do you think it is in the interests of the
tobacco industry to have only one buyer in Australia?
—I have not investigated the selling side of the in-
dustry. Competition is always good for trade. The
Select Committee will be able to ascertain the prices
paid by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
and to determine whether that company has been
playing the game. I understand that it has paid fair
prices for the tobacco it has purchased, but have no
personal knowledge.
1135. Do you think that the abolition or reduction
of the excise duty on Australian leaf would benefit the
tobacco-growing industry?—l have not studied that
aspect of the matter. I take it that revenue must be
raised somehow, and that it is better to raise it on
luxuries than on necessities.
1136. Are you aware that great strides have been
made in the tobacco industry in certain British
dominions, notably Rhodesia, Cyprus, and Canada, as
a result of a British preferential tariff?—l know that
there is an over-production of tobacco in Rhodesia and
South Africa to-day.
1137. Do you think that the industry could be
stimulated by a reform of the tariff?—l think there is
sufficient attraction in the industry to-day without any
further fiscal assistance being granted. Every ounce
of good tobacco grown in Australia has a market.
1138. We have had evidence that growers are losing
money ?—Those growers probably had diseased crops or
grew the wrong type of tobacco.
1139. When did you first hear about a eucalyptus
taint in Australian tobacco? —About eighteen months
ago, when the results of certain tests were made known.
Before Mr. McGee returned to America he gave me a
broad outline of what he had been doing.
1140. In 1926 the sales of “ Waratah ” tobacco
totalled 11,667 lb., whereas in 1927 the sales dropped
to 4,090 lb. Do you think there is any connexion
between that drop and the suggestion of eucalyptus
taint?—l have no idea. The Australian Tobacco In-
vestigation, considering that the case had not been
proven, refused to publish the reports.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Edward Lough, Senior Leaf Buyer for the
British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd., was
called, sworn, and examined.
1141. By the Chairman-. —How long have you held
your present position?— Since the death of Mr. John
Gilmore, in 1924.
1142. What experience had you before your appoint-
ment as senior buyer?—l had been associated with the
company for twenty years. After one year’s clerical
experience with the company I was sent to Texas, in
Queensland, to study the business there. After eighteen
mouths at Texas the manager was transferred, and I
took his place.
1143. Were you there when the place was closed
down?— No. 1 had been re-transferred to Sydney
before that.
1144. How long were you at Texas ?—About five and
a half years.
1145. Are you familiar with the whole of the opera-
tions carried out there? —Yes, from the time I went
there.
1146. Had you any experience as a buyer before
being appointed senior buyer?— Yes. On my discharge
from the Australian Imperial Eorce in 1919 I was
appointed assistant buyer to the late Mr. Gilmour. I
travelled with him, visiting farms and assisting him in
all his work. Mr. Gilmour w T as the company’s technical
adviser for about 30 years, and bought tobacco in all
parts of Australia.
1147. Do you find it difficult to visit all the tobacco
farms?—lt is difficult to get to some of them; but I
manage it.
1148. How do you locate the growers?—lt is mostly
a matter of personal knowledge. I know wdiere most
of the regular growers are to be found, and I make
inquiries for new growlers as I go about.
1149. When in the Wangaratta district would you
go to the secretary of the Tobacco-growers’ Association
there for information? —Mr. Sambell has been in his
present position for only a few months. I have asked
branch secretaries of associations for information.
1150. Can we take it that you are desirous of
getting in touch with new growers ?—Yes.
1151. Is there any possibility of your missing some
of them?—lt is possible; but Ido not think it has
happened. Of course, it might happen that a new'
growler establishes a farm in a district removed from
other farms; but if he notified the company that he
was growing tobacco, he would be visited.
1152. Do all'the growers notify the company that
they have tobacco for sale?— Not all of them. It is
not a common practice.
1153. The position really is that the growers depend
upon your visiting their farms and take no steps to
communicate with the company ?—That is so. The
Company keeps in touch with growers by circularizing
them.
1154. Is that not rather a lax organization on the
part of the growers?— They have no organization.
1155. The committee heard of farms that had not
been visited by a buyer?—lf they had tobacco for sale
I would have inspected it.
1156. Do you recollect any recent instance in which
you refused to get out of your car to inspect tobacco?
—No. My job is to buy tobacco wherever obtainable.
1157. Would you be influenced by one grower’s
opinion as to another grower’s crop ?—No.
1158. Then there is no foundation for the state-
ment that you refused to inspect certain crops of
tobacco? —No. Actually I go Out of my way to in-
spect tobacco.
1159. If there were a considerable increase in the
number of tobacco growers* would you still follow the
same procedure?—ln that event I should report the
matter to my directors.


1160. Supposing the production of tobacco increased
to 1,350,000 lb, per annum in each State, would you
be able to inspect it all?—It would depend largely
on whether the increased production was from existing
farms or new farms. In the one case it would not
mean many more calls, whereas in the other case it
might mean a good deal more travelling.
1161. Is there a different buying season for each
district ?—Tobacco does not ripen at precisely the same
time in all districts. I endeavour to travel from district
to district as the tobacco in each area is ready for
inspection and sale.
1162. What is your procedure when visting a farm?
—The grower submits his tobacco for sale, and I take
samples of it from the bales. I have to satisfy myself
as to the average quality of his grade, and I make
my valuation accordingly. I compare the samples
taken with the samples held by the department, and
on which the guarantee is based.
1163. Who selected those samples?— They were
selected by the company and submitted to the depart-
mental experts.
1164. Have the growers any means of seeing the
samples ?—They have the right to see them at any time.
I understand that from time to time the samples are
taken to the tobacco areas for the growers to see. If
a man thinks that his tobacco is not being graded satis-
factorily by the buyer, he has the right to go to the
department and compare his sample with the official
sample. If he is still dissatisfied he can call in a State
tobacco expert to give his judgment.
1165. Has that ever been done?— Hot to my know-
ledge.
1166. Would it be fair to say that the majority A
growers are dissatisfied with your grading?—l do not
think so.
1167. Do they indicate their views to you?— Some of
the growers who gave evidence at Wangaratta are not
truly representative growers. I could give the names
of men who are always satisfied with my grading. They
are generally men who grow good tobacco,
1168. Are your relations with the growers cordial?
-Yes, in 98 per cent, of cases.
1169. Do you announce your price immediately after
inspecting the samples?— Yes.
1170. Do you hear many adverse comments?—lt
depends largely on the season. In a good season there
is very little trouble, because the quality of the leaf
is good and the prices satisfactory. In a bad season,
the quantity of poor tobacco is greater, and conse-
quently there are more disappointed growers.
1171. What would be some typical comments by dis-
satisfied growers when you announce your price ?— u Hot
a fair deal ”; “ tobacco is worth more ”; “I got more
four or five years ago for the same class of tobacco ”;
“ I was expecting more ”.
1172. Do many growers reject your offers?— Hot
many, but some do. Sometimes they ask me to let the
offer stand for a while, which I always do. Once I
make an offer I do not withdraw it.
1173. Does the company support that attitude?— Yes.
1174. We were told at Wangaratta that tobacco for
which you offered 4d. a lb, one year, was purchased by
you the following year for Is. 4d. a lb. Would that
happen often?—lt probably has not happened at all.
In the first place, it is not usual to offer only 4d. a lb.
because the lowest price mentioned in the guarantee is
sd. a lb.
1175. Perhaps you said that such tobacco was worth
only about 4d. a lb. ?—Tobacco of that quality would
not be worth buying.
1176. Are you acting under any instructions from
the company to raise the standard every year ?— Ho. In
the grading of leaf I use my own discretion.
1177. Have you adopted a very marked upward
trend in the standard during the last twelve months?—
Wo. To the best of my judgment the grades now are
not different from what they were in previous years.
Some growers include in their leaf a quantity of worth-
less trash. It would damage the industry if I were to
buy it.
1178. Are the growers improving in their grading?—
The grading varies from year to year. A grower may
improve considerably, and then fall back again.
1179. Have you met any men who have a natural
aptitude for grading?— There are some men whose
tobacco one can buy almost on one sample, because the
whole of the leaf they offer is well graded and up to
standard. Those men naturally get better prices.
1180. Do you take into consideration good grading
when buying?—A well-graded crop of tobacco is paid
for at its full value. There are some men whose crop
I could buy on their own description of it, because I
have learned that their word can be relied on.
1181. Do you buy tobacco from any Chinamen?—
There are still a good many Chinamen in Hew South
Wales who grow tobacco. Some of them are share
farmers, in which case I deal with the white landlord.
ldB2 \P o J ou have many transactions with China-
men? les. We get on well together.
118u. Are they more reasonable in regard to prices
than are the white men?— Yes, on the whole—that is if
there is any difference at all.
1184. Do you find the white growers more scrupu-
ous in their grading ? Ido not think any comparison
can be made. Some Chinamen are just as scrupulous
as any white man could be.
1185. By Mr. Morgan. —Have you anything to say
with respect to the evidence of the growers at Wan-
garatta in the matter of prices ?—I submit a table
showing the prices paid to them.
1186. By Mr. Jones. —What is your opinion of the
tobacco leaf grown in the Jamieson district?—l have
seen some tobacco of promising quality produced there,
but last year the tobacco grown in that district was of
poor quality. It was also badly graded. Much of it
was immature when placed in the curing barn.
1187. Would you regard the district as a promis-
ing ope for tobacco culture?— From the soil point of
view, yes, but not for climate. It is difficult to mature
the crop with the result that there is a danger of the
tobacco being cut before it is ripe.
1188. When you offer a certain price for tobacco
and the grower wants more, do you ever split the dif-
ference?—lf the grower can show that the average
quality of the crop is better than the sample on which
I base my offer, I am always prepared to amend the
oner.
1189. Can a grower persuade you to make a better
offer than your first?— Only by proving that the crop
as a whole is better than the sample first submitted.
Where the grading is irregular I might by chance pick
out an inferior sample and make an offer accordingly'
but a more detailed examination of a crop might prove
it to be of higher quality than I thought. In that case
i would offer more.
1190 Would you say that the growers of tobacco
generally are satisfied with the prices they receive o
ihe growers of good tobacco are satisfied.
1191. Would you say that the dissatisfied growers
are not growing good tobacco ?—Yes.
l ou on a fixed scale of prices supplied
the company, or do you use your own discretion?—
hirst we have our guarantee as a basis. Where I see
obacco up to the standard, I always offer more than
the price stipukted m the guarantee. I have received
price tlonS fr ° m COmpany not t0 exceed a certain


1193. Could you offer as much as 4s. a lb. for
tobacco ?—I would not care to do so without first
referring the matter to the company. I might recom-
mend that that price be paid for a particularly good
sample.
1194. Do you work on any system of averages?—
Ho. I buy on the quality of the leaf.
1195. Do you think that the quantity of dark leaf
is decreasing?—l am unable to say.
1196. Do you agree with the statement made by
growers at Wangaratta that they can now produce
60 per cent, of bright leaf?— Before they can produce
that proportion of bright leaf they will have to change
their methods. I do not think that, on the average,
they are producing that proportion of bright leaf.
Some growers produce as much as 80 per cent, of bright
leaf. That has been done at Tamworth and in some
Victorian districts. From one farm at Tamworth
I bought 41 bales of bright leaf, and 34 bales of
mahogany. Of those 34 bales of mahogany, 29 bales
were high-grade. There was no dark leaf at all. I
attribute those results to intelligent culture.
1197. Does that not indicate that growers who work
on proper lines will get satisfactory results? —Yes,
particularly if they pay due regard to colour and
grading.
1198. You consider that intelligence on the part of
the grower is an important factor as well as soil,
climate and quality of seed? —Yes, it is most important.
1199. On what type of soil in the Tamworth district
were those results obtained?—On rather heavy soil on
which tobacco had been grown for some years.
1200. Do you attribute the high grade mainly to the
curing?—l attribute it to careful picking and harvest-
ing of the crop. The crop was matured.
1201. Do you give the growers any tuition in grad-
ing?— That was done until the Investigation Com-
mittee was appointed. I take it that now that work
is more for the committee than the company.
1202. If a grower asks you for advice, do you give
it to him?— Yes. We offer advice where we think it
advisable to do so.
1203. By Mr. Slagg. —What was the texture of the
bright high-grade leaf grown at Tamworth?—Fair;
not the best.
1204. Have you been able, in Victoria, to secure
tobacco that will hold moisture in a way that is com-
parable to imported tobacco? —I have not tested that,
but usually the Australian tobacco is drier than the
imported article.
The witness withdrew.
(Taken at Sydney.)
MOHDAY, 3rd FEBRUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited;
Mr. C. M. Slagg, representing the Australian
Tobacco Investigation; Mr. Temple Smith,
Tobacco Expert of the Department of Agriculture,
Victoria.)
Cecil Joseph Tregenna, Tobacco Expert, Department of
Agriculture, Hew South Wales, was called, sworn
and examined.
1205. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position?— Fifteen years.
1206. Did you come to Australia to take up that
position?— The position was offered to me when I was
in Sydney. Before that I was engaged in tobacco-
growing in Rhodesia for about four years. I left
Rhodesia sixteen or seventeen years ago, and was in
Australia about two years before I came to Sydney.
I secured the position mainly in consideration of my
experience as a tobacco-grower in Rhodesia. In April,
1914, at the request of the ISTew South Wales Govern-
ment, I furnished a report on tobacco-growing in the
Tamworth district. The State Department of Agricul-
ture desired to know the prospects of success in tobacco-
growing there. That report is still in existence.
About six months after I furnished that report I was
offered my present position, which I accepted.
1207. Did Hew South Wales have a tobacco-expert
before you were appointed ?—I think that Mr.
Gornitzka, who is now in America, held the position
before me.
1208. Was Mr. Howell ever an expert in the depart-
ment ?—That Mr. Howell is now dead. The field
supervisor in Queensland is his son.
1209. When you were appointed was the State
Tobacco Department in existence, or did you create it?
—I created it.
1210. Have you any staff ?—Ho. I have no assist-
ance whatever.
1211. What about Mr. Kefford? —He has left the
department, and at present I am without assistance.
1212. Why did the department terminate his appoint-
ment?—He resigned his position to take up another.
1213. Has his position not been filled only because
there is no man available to fill it?—ln view of the
investigations being undertaken by the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, it was decided not to make any
further appointment until that body had furnished
a report.
1214. What has been the work of your department
during your term of office?— The initiation of flue-
curing. When I came there were no flue-curing barns
in Hew South Wales. The department has also made
trial plantings of different varieties of tobacco and has
carried out general field experiements, including experi-
ments with different fertilizers.
1215. Have you personally been in charge of the
work?-—Yes.
1216. What do your duties comprise?—l visit the
growers in the different districts and give them advice
and instruction.
1217. What is the extent of the tobacco-growing
industry in Hew South Wales?— There has been a
great falling off during recent years.
1218. Could you say what number of men are
engaged in the industry in Hew South Wales? —The
number of growers varies considerably according to
the season. When blue mould appears, the numbr-
decreases.
1219. In what districts is the tobacco produced?—
It is grown at Tumut, Tamworth and Manilla, and
some near the Queensland and Hew South Wales
border adjoining the Texas district. Those are the
principal areas. Some tobacco is grown at Wagga
and on the Upper Murray, as well as a little in the
Upper Hunter district.
1220, In what way does your department keep in
touch with the growers?—By visiting them.
1221. Do you keep records of the tobacco-grow’ers ?
—Ho. All growers are registered by the Customs
Department, and that information, as well as the
amount of tobacco they sell is obtainable there.
1222. Do the growers keep in touch with the depart-
ment by letter?— Hot in recent years. The growers
are more or less unhappy because they realize that the
market for the class of tobacco which they produce is
falling away. Many of them, I think, realize that they
have no hope of growing the light tobacco suitable for
manufacturing cigarettes. The reason is that the soils
are too heavy.


1223. The senior buyer for the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company said that one man in the Tam worth
district grew 90 per cent, to 95 per cent, of bright
tobacco on fairly heavy soil. Does not that man’s
experience indicate that good bright tobacco can be
grown on heavy soils? —Yes. Nevertheless, much of
the land in the Tamworth district is not suitable for
the production of good light tobacco.
1224. Would that large proportion of good bright
tobacco from heavy soil be due to exceptionally good
cultivation?— No. Dungowan soils are lighter than
those lower down. Moreover, they have been cropped
for many years. Our experience shows that the longer
tobacco is grown in heavy soil the better its quality
becomes.
1225. It would appear that it is possible to produce
bright tobacco on heavy soil? —Yes; but it might have
a bad aroma.
1226. Do you think that careful cultivation of heavy
soils would enable growers to produce light bright
tobacco suitable for cigarettes?—ln some places it can
be done.
1227. Has the department classified the soils of the
various tobacco-growing districts?—No; but we know
them.
1228. In what way has your department attempted
to organize the industry ?—We have shown growers how
to flue-cure and prepare their leaf.
1229. Have you any statistics showing the area of
tobacco farms, the number of growers, and the methods
followed by them ? —That information is not on record.
1230. Does the department leave the whole w 7 ork
entirely to you?— Yes,
1231. What has been the greatest number of growers
in New 7 South Wales at any time during your
experience?—At one time there w 7 ere between 800 and
1,000 Chinamen engaged in tobacco-growing in the
Tamworth and Manilla districts.
1232. How 7 many tobacco-growers have been under
the supervision of the department at one time in the
whole State ?—There are about 50 in the Tumut dis-
trict. The Texas district is chiefly in Queensland,
and I do not know the numbers, but in the New 7 South
Wales portion of the Texas district there would be
under a dozen growers. Whites and Chinese tobacco-
growers in the Tamworth district number between 300
and 400. All the growers are registered,, and exact
figures can be obtained from the Customs Department.
1233. Would it be an exaggeration to say that at one
time there were 500 tobacco-growers—whites and
Chinese—in New South Wales?—No; but there is not
that number to-day.
1234. Would there be 250 growers in the State to-
day?— That would probably be the total number there
to-day.
1235. What is the cause of the decrease?— The to-
bacco they produce is not what buyers want.
1236. Would the change to flue-curing account for
the lower number?— Yes, to some extent.
1237. Is it a fact that the majority of Chinamen
w 7 ho went in for air-cured tobacco have gone out of
the industry?— Yes.
1238. Did their Chinese employees also go wdth them ?
-Yes.
1239. Can you say that, as a result of the ch
to flue-curing, tobacco-growdng is no longer a Chinese
industry?— Yes. It became a white man’s industry
wdth the change.
1240. Did you find it difficult to get on with the
Chinese?— They are very conservative, but once their
confidence is gained one can influence their opinions.
1241. When the Chinese were growing air-cured to-
bacco, did they go along on their own without seeking
vour advice?— Yes. Generally, they resented advice.
1242. Even when you pointed out their mistakes
they would not change?— That is so.
1243. Are they keen on irrigation?— They are
natural irrigationists. They would not grow tobacco
without water. They were concerned more with quan-
tity than with quality.
1244. What is the white man’s idea?—To get as
much as he can for his crop. He is more concerned
about a good quality leaf than the Chinaman is.
1245. What is your experience of the mentality of
the white growers generally?— They are keen and in-
telligent, and anxious to improve. During the last ten
years they have improved the quality of their tobacco
tremendously.
1246. Would you say that the white man is more
concerned about quality than quantity?—He wants
both; but he is generally desirous of improving the
quality.
1247. Have-you found the wdiite growers willing to
accept your advice?— Yes.
1248. Would you say that the white growers expect
to be spoon-fed by experts?— No. There was a time
when they did, but they are getting more practical
experience now 7 and require less expert assistance.
1249. Would you say that their experience is mak-
ing them expert ? —They are becoming very proficient.
The average white grower knows a good deal about
tobacco culture.
1250. If you were asked to select half a dozen men
to assist you in field work, could you find them?— No.
1251. What is the reason?— The experience of one
district is not that of another. A man might be a
good grower at Tumut, yet he would fail at Tamworth.
1252. Would not a good man adapt himself to altered
conditions?-—Yes; but at present 1 could not find suit-
able men to assist me.
1253. Does your department distribute literature
among growers ?-—Yes. It has a pamphlet on tobacco
growing wdiich is sent to those who ask for it. Oc-
casionally a Chinaman asks for it.
1254. Have you any reason to believe that the absence
of requests for advice from the department is because
growers are opposed to you personally?— Yes. I have
found that 1 am most popular when I praise their
work and say their tobacco is good. But if I criticize
their work I am unpopular. As, unfortunately, I am
frequently not able to speak w 7 ell of their efforts, lam
not popular.
1255. You say that the position wdth regard to the
tobacco they produce is practically hopeless?—ln view
of the conditions of the market, a large proportion of
the tobacco they produce does not meet with popular
favour. That applies particularly to dark tobacco,
1266. Are you hopeful regarding the future of light
tobacco ?—Yes.
1257. Then I take it that you regard the position as
hopeless only in respect of dark tobacco?— Yes.
1258. If the growers were able to produce 60 per
cent, of bright tobacco, would that remove your pessi-
mism? —I am pessimistic about dark tobacco. In view
of the demand for light tobaccoes the outlook for dark
tobacco is hopeless.
1259. Would you say that most of the bright tobacco
bought by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
is suitable for pipe smoking?—lt is all a matter of
taste. Ido not like it. The light tobacco is better than
the dark.
1260. Seeing that the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company is prepared to buy in Victoria alone,
1,350,000 lb. of bright leaf tobacco annually, and that
last year in, the whole of Australia the quantity of
that leaf produced was only 250,000 lb., would you say
that there is a bright future before the industry?—lf
the growers produce bright tobacco they will have no
difficulty in disposing of it.


i.261. Then your pessimism is not well founded? — I
.m not pessimistic about the industry as a whole, but
I am pessimistic regarding the future of dark tobacco.
1262. Have you conducted any tests as to the smok-
ing qualities of Australian bright leaf ?—Yes. The
records of those tests are available.
1263. What were the results of the tests? —The tests
indicated that the cause of the aroma in Australian
tobacco was certain organic matter in the soil.
1264. Were those tests conducted in collaboration
with the federal department?— Yes. They were con-
ducted under the direction of Dr. Darnell-Smith, Mr.
Massie, a director of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company, Mr. Slagg, and Mr. Scarvell. The experi-
ments were not under the control of Mr. Slagg, but
he was asked to express an opinion on the quality of
the tobacco grown. The department will not permit
the results of the tests to be published.
1265. Are the results of those experiments to be made
known to the growers?— Apparently not.
1266. Is the matter to end there?—lt looks like it.
1267. Is that because it is desired not further to
prejudice public opinion against Australian tobacco?—
That is the reason, probably.
1268. Have those experiments anything to do with
the theory of eucalyptus taint in Australian tobacco ?
That theory is based on the work done at Bathurst.
1269, In his evidence, Dr. Darnell-Smith referred
to the tests made with fresh eucalyptus leaves dug into
the soil. He said that at the end of the first year the
tobacco grown in that soil had an unpleasant aroma,
but that by the end of the second year, during which
no additional leaves were dug into the ground, the
aroma had improved. Was that a correct account of
the result of the tests?— Yes. I was associated with
Dr. Darnell-Smith in the tests and noted the improved
aroma at the end of the second year.
1270. Do you agree that there is no data in the pos-
session of the authorities to justify the publication of
a definite opinion that any unpalatable aroma in Aus-
tralian tobacco is due to eucalyptus in the soil?— Yes.
1271. Do you agree with Dr, Darnell-Smith that it
is possible that after the first addition of eucalyptus
leaves to the soil the aroma of tobacco may be improved
by the amount of eucalyptus oil in the soil?— There
has been no suggestion of eucalytpus oil or phellan-
drene in the soil.
1272. Would you describe phellandrene as a vola-
tile oil?—It is an oil, but not a volatile oil.
1273. Would you say that phellandrene is a definite
factor in determining the aroma of Australian tobacco ?
—No. All we can say is that we have carried out
certain experiments which have given certain results.
The inference is that those results are caused by vege-
table matter in the soil, but we have not yet gone far
enough to make a definite pronouncement to that effect.
1274. Are you aware that about eighteen months ago
the Daily Telegraph Pictorial, Sydney, stated that it
had been definitely ascertained that eucalyptus in the
soil was the cause of the bad aroma in Australian
tobacco? —I am not responsible for any newspaper
statement to that effect. Any statements which I have
made on the subject are contained in a report bearing
my signature.
1275. Have you at any time made a public state-
ment which would lead growers to believe that you held
the opinion that eucalyptus in the soil was the cause
of the unpleasant aroma in Australian tobacco ?—That
view might be an inference from remarks I have made,
because I think that the aroma of Australian tobacco
is affected by decayed eucalyptus vegetation in the soil.
Everything points that way; but not sufficient work
has been done to make a definite statement to that
effect.
F. 218. —10
1276. The experiments indicate the opposite, because
in the second year the aroma was improved ?—lt must
be remembered that pure sand was used for the experi-
ment, and that the second year organic matter or plant
food in the sand had disappeared, or was taken up
by the previous crop.
1277. Do you think that it is fair to base any con-
clusion regarding the aroma of tobacco on the experi-
ments made?— Yes. The only way to improve the
aroma of tobacco is to alter the soil conditions.
1278. Does that mean that we shall have to alter
the character of the soil in which tobacco is grown?—
No. In North Queensland tobacco of good quality has
been produced in eucalyptus country.
1279. How do you know there is eucalyptus in Aus-
tralian tobacco?—l have not said that I can taste any
eucalyptus in Australian tobacco. The aroma is
probably due to vegetable matter in the soil. The
tobacco of every country has its own aroma. The
aroma of Australian tobacco is different from that of
tobacco grown in other countries.
1280. Have you detected any eucalyptus taint in
Australian tobacco ?—No.
1281. Then why has eucalyptus been blamed?—
Eucalyptus is the predominant vegetation of Australia.
I have never said that Australian tobacco has a
eucalyptus flavour or aroma. All I have said is that
it has an objectionable aroma when compared with
American tobacco.
1282. Do you consider that eucalyptus is an objec-
tionable aroma?—l do not object to eucalyptus; but
I do not like smoking Australian tobacco.
1283. is it not possible that a eucalyptus impregna-
tion might improve the aroma ?—That is possible.
1284. Would you say that the aroma of eucalyptus
is agreeable ?—That is a matter of individual taste.
1285. Is there any evidence to show that the public
will not buy a product impregnated with eucalyptus?
—The public stopped buying Australian tobacco before
the theory of eucalyptus taint was advanced.
1286. Are we to understand that your objection to
Australian tobacco is confined to the heavier types?
I think the light types are also inferior in aroma.
Cigarettes made of light Australian tobacco would not
be so acceptable to the public as are “ Capstan ”
cigarettes.
128 <. If the public could not get other cigarettes,
would they smoke Australian tobacco?—l doubt it.
1288. You think that smokers buy the cigarettes they
like best?— That is only natural.
1289. If you could not get other tobacco, would you
give up smoking rather than smoke Australian cigar-
ettes? —-Yes, in the case of most Australian leaf.
Australian cigarettes tend to make me feel sick.
1290. Have you smoked any cigarettes made entirely
of Australian tobacco?— Yes.
1291. How did they affect you?— They affected me
in the nose and throat.
1292. Were they cigarettes made by yourself from
Australian tobacco? Yes. I have also smoked manu-
factured Australian cigarettes, but the ones to which I
refer were made by me from the best Australian leaf I
could get.
1293. Have you noticed any marked improvement
in the colour of our bright leaf during recent years?
Yes; there has been a great improvement.
1294. Does that colour improvement necessarily
involve an improved aroma?— Not necessarily; but
generally the brighter the tobacco the less pronounced
the aroma.
1295. If the growers can eliminate the dark leaf
and produce, say, 60 per cent, of bright leaf, would


not much of the objection to Australian tobacco dis-
appear?—! doubt it. The public has been educated to
smoke high-grade American tobacco, and naturally it
is hard to change them.
1296. Were the Australian cigarettes you smoked
made of bright leaf ?—Both bright and dark.
1297. Did you find the same objectionable features
in each?—My objection to those made of bright leaf
was not so strong as to the darker variety.
1298. Could a good cigarette or pipe tobacco be
produced from a mixture of Australian and imported
bright leaf?—lt would depend upon where the tobacco
was grown. Bright colour does not necessarily mean
good aroma.
1299, Would you be prepared to smoke cigarettes
made half of Australian and half of American leaf?
—lf the Australian leaf came from Stawell, in Vic-
toria, or North Queensland, a 50-50 mixture with
American tobacco would give a satisfactory cigarette.
The position would be quite different if tobacco grown
in Tamworth, Manilla or Tumut were used.
1300. What about Wangarratta?—Anything I
smoked from Wangaratta has not been good.
1301. Would you say that cigarettes made of Stawell
tobacco would equal “Capstan” cigarettes?—No; but
they are good cigarettes.
1302. What steps are taken to determine the
suitability of cigarettes?—A number of cigarettes of
different kinds are handed to different smokers, and
they are asked to express their opinion without know-
ing the kinds.
1303. Have you found the opinions of experts to
agree?— Yes.
1304. Do you compare the aroma of Australian
tobacco with that of imported tobacco ? —That is always
at the back of one’s mind when making smoking
tests.
1305. Do you think that “ Capstan ” cigarettes have
a pleasant aroma?— Yes.
1306. Would you say that the more of those
cigarettes one smokes the less pleasant the aroma
becomes?— Too many cigarettes spoil the palate. That
is always the effect of excess.
1307, Would that not also apply to Australian
cigarettes?—My experience of Australian cigarettes
and tobacco is that I do not want to smoke any more.
I do not like any brand of tobacco w T hich contains a
good proportion of Australian leaf.
1308. I hand you some samples of tobacco. The
dark sample is 100 per cent. Australian, while the
lighter sample is all-Australian excepting the wrapper.
What is your opinion of them? —-The appearance of
both samples is good.
1309. What is your opinion of their aroma ?—I judge
tobacco by smoking it.
1310. Do not buyers buy tobacco on the smell of
the “ hand ” ?—Yes.
1311. What do you think of the smell of the samples
submitted to you?—l do not like it; but that is purely
a matter of taste.
1312. Would you say it is offensive?— No.
1313. The Tariff Board in its report of 1926 says
that it has no doubt that most of the tobacco produced
in Australia is unpalatable and offensive. Do you agree
with that description?—l should say that it is un-
palatable. What is offensive to one man might not be
offensive to another.
1314. Judging by appearance and smell, would you
say the two samples submitted are offensive?— No.
1315. If you were looking for a good Australian to-
bacco, would you give them a trial on appearance only ?
—Yes, particularly the bright sample; but whether 1
smoked it later, or not, would depend on whether I
liked it.
1316, Would you say that the various processes
through which tobacco passes improves its smoking
qualities?—l know nothing about the manufacture of
tobacco.
1317. Do you think that the ageing process affects
the aroma of tobacco?— Not so much as most people
think. Australian tobacco is at its best immediately
it comes from the barn. My experience is that there-
after it deteriorates.
1318. Were those the only tests you carried out? —
No; numbers of tests have led to the same conclusion,
namely, that New South Wales tobacco is best when
it comes out of the barn.
1319. What do you think of the prices Australian
growers are getting for their tobacco?—l think they
are good, but I do not know the actual expenses of
production. Every grower says he is losing money,
but still he continues to grow tobacco.
1320. Have you compiled any statistics to show the
financial and commercial position of growers?— Only
the information gained during the economic survey. It
is difficult to get from growers the actual cost of pro-
duction.
1321. Would you say that most of the growers are
doing well?—I cannot conceive of men continuing to
grow tobacco to make further losses.
1322, Have many growers gone out of business be-
cause of low prices?—My opinion is that if they grow
good leaf the industry is highly profitable.
1323. What should he the average profit?—lf r,hey
grow the right class of tobacco, the returns should be
from, say, £5O to £lOO an acre.
1324. Has the department ever investigated the cost
of tobacco production?— No. The growers do not like
to give the information.
1325. Are you aware that the Tariff Board went
fully into the cost of production, and that it ascer-
tained that it cost the Tamworth growers £132 an acre?
—I think that amount is absurd.
1326. The Victorian average is £45 an acre?— That
is more nearly correct.
1327. The Tariff Board in its report for 1926, said
that there is no doubt that Australian tobacco is un-
palatable and offensive. Do you agree that it is offen-
sive ? —I say that it is unpalatable, but not offensive.
1328. By Mr. Jones. —One man at Wangaratta told
us that from the day he first smoked Australian tobacco
he has smoked nothing else?— Evidently it suits his
particular taste.
1329. Do you think there are many Australian to-
baccoes of which Australians have never heard? —They
are not so extensively advertised as are other brands.
1330, Do you think their sales would increase if they
were more extensively advertised?— No.
1331. When was the suggestion of eucalyptus taint
in tobacco first made?— That suggestion was made by
certain newspapers about two years ago.
1332. Do you think that that statement affected the
sales of Australian tobacco?— No.
1333. About the time that that statement was made
the sales of “Waratah” tobacco dropped considerably.
Do you see any connexion between the two things?—
I should say that the public did not like “ Waratah ”
tobacco. Other brands met with similar results before
the theory of eucalyptus taint was advanced.
1334. Would you say that Australian tobacco loses
its aroma with age?— The objectionable aroma is accen-
tuated with age. When the tobacco is taken from the
barn it has a pleasant aroma, but if it is kept for a
fortnight it becomes more objectionable.
1335. Is it not generally recognized that the aroma
of tobacco increases with age?—A good aroma improves
with age, but a bad aroma is accentuated.


1336. By Mr. Tully. —You had four years’ experience
as a tobacco-grower in Ehodesia. Was that the limit of
your experience before you came to Australia ?—Before
that time I was financially interested in tobacco-grow-
ing.
1337. By the Chairman. —Were you successful as a
grower in Ehodesia?—Yes. My last crop nearly topped
the market.
1338. Are you acquainted with Texas in Queens-
land ?—Yes. I was there for about a year, during which
time I experimented with tobacco. I did not continue
because I regarded the climatic conditions as unsatis-
factory.
1339. Was that in 1915 ?—Yes.
1340. Were you then appointed to your present posi-
tion?— Yes. The New South Wales department wanted
a man with experience of flue-curing, and I was
appointed. In Ehodesia, flue-curing was in general
use.
1341. Do you think that, ultimately, almost the
whole of our tobacco requirements will be produced in
Australia ?—Y es.
1342. Do you think that that tobacco will be pro-
duced in the existing areas?—l think it will come from
North Queensland.
1343. Do you suggest that operations in the existing
areas be continued?— That is a difficult question. It
will be a number of years before the proportion of
bright tobacco grown in the existing districts increases
to any great extent.
1344. If the proportion of bright leaf increases each
year, would you say that we should be justified in con-
tinuing operations in the existing areas? —Personally,
I should not'grow tobacco in the Tamworth or Tumut
districts. Those districts are more suitable for the grow-
ing of dark tobacco, for which there is now little
demand.
1345. What quantity of tobacco is produced per
acre in the Tamworth and Manilla districts?— About
12 cwt. to the acre.
1346. Would you say that the total production of
those districts is about 200 tons a year?— Yes.
1347. If more than half of that were classed as bright
leaf, would that not represent a marked improvement
in the last ten years?—-Yes; there has been a marked
improvement.
1348. Then would you say that the growers are en-
titled to further encouragement ?—So long as the public
demands light tobacco, it is useless to grow the darker
types.
1349. If you could sell the tobacco you produced,
whether light or dark, would you not continue to grow
it?—l should always be afraid that it would not be
bought.
1350. Have you had anything to do with the federal
experiments?— Practically nothing. I was with the
economic survey party.
1351. Did you agree with the report of that body?
—Yes.
1352. Why was that report not made public?—l do
not know. Probably it was because Mr. Slagg was
coming here and it was felt that he should have a free
hand.
1353. Do you confer with Mr. Slagg in regard to
the federal experiments?— Very little.
1354. Does Mr. Slagg keep in touch with you?—
This is the first year that anything has been done.
1355. Was Mr. Slagg’s Bulletin No. 2 referred to
you before publication?— No.
1356. Are the federal investigations being carried
out independently of State experts?— There has not
been much occasion for collaboration. I agree with the
contents of Bulletin No. 2.
1357. Who asked you to visit North Queensland and
report on the tobacco possibilities there?— Mr. Gepp,
of the Development and Migration Commission.
1358. Did you submit a favorable report?— Yes.
1359. What is your opinion of North Queensland as
a tobacco-growing area ?—lt is the only place in Aus-
tralia that I have visited which I think will produce
high-grade tobacco. I think that we can grow there
tobacco which will displace much of the American pro-
duct now imported.
1360. To what parts of North Queensland do you
refer ?—The country around Mareeba. The leaf grown
there is the best Australian leaf I have seen.
1361. By Mr. Martens. —Were you at Mungana?—
Yes. I was particularly impressed with the country
from Mareeba to near Chillagoe.
1362. Were you at Herbert Eange?—No. I went to
Charters Towers and Eavenswood. That locality is
not so good as the district around Mareeba,
1363. By the Chairman. —-Are you acquainted with
the Chaffey Brothers of Tamworth?—Yes.
1364. In 1927, Chaffey Brothers sold tobacco for
2s. a lb., which brought them a return of £250 per
acre. Does that not indicate that good tobacco can be
grown in that locality?— Yes.
1365. How do you account for such good results? —
Their tobacco must have suited the buyers.
1366. Do you think that the fact that the company
bought large quantities of dark tobacco at fair prices
accounted for growers continuing to produce that type ?
—Yes.
1367. Would you say that the growers are making
a determined effort to produce the type of tobacco now
required?—-Yes.
1368. Do you think that there should be a permanent
federal department of tobacco investigation in Aus-
tralia—that the Pederal Government should have con-
trol of all experiments, but that they should be carried
out by the States?— That would be all right so long
as there was a time limit. A good deal of work has
already been done which should be of value to Aus-
tralia, The creation of a new permanent department
would be a waste of public money.
1369. Would you fix a period for experiments to be
carried out by the Commonwealth?—No; but I do not
think there should be a permanent department.
1370. Do you agree with Mr. Gepp that it will pro-
bably take ten years to complete the federal experi-
ments?— That is a fair period. It is necessary that the
man who undertakes the experiments should be given
sufficient time to do his job thoroughly,
1371. Do you agree with Mr. Gepp that 90 per cent,
of the efforts of scientists is negative?—l prefer not
to express an opinion.
1372. Do ybu consider it reasonable that the federal
investigations should be continued for ten years, sub-
ject to some effective scheme of co-operation with the
States ?-—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Tamworth.)
WEDNESDAY, 12th FEBEUAEY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones I Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens j Mr. Tully.
(Mr. O. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited;
Mr. W. C. Parkes, representing the" Northern
Tobacco-growers Association; Mr. C. J. Tregenna,
tobacco expert, Department of Agriculture, New-
South Wales).
George Albert Lye, tobacco-grower, Piallamore, Tam-
worth, was called, sworn and examined.
1373. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
in this district?—l was born in Tamworth 57 years
ago.


1374. How long have you been growing tobacco? —
Ten to twelve years.
1375. Has it been all in the one district ?—Yes, and
on the one farm.
1376. Have you a written statement which you wish
to place before the committee? —I have no statement
of my own; hut I propose to tender one later on behalf
of Mr. Steinbeck. He has given me figures covering
his last two years’ returns.
1377. What has been your experience of tobacco-
growing in the Tamworth district—first regarding the
difficulty in the way of growing tobacco in the district
owing to such things as insect pests, blue mould, &c.;
secondly, any difficulties you may have encountered in
marketing; and thirdly, what efforts you have made
to improve the quality of your leaf?— The first year 1
grew tobacco I obtained a crop. For the next five
years I got no crop, owing to blue mould. My first
crop was sun-dried.
1378. You sun-dried your tobacco up till the sixth
year ?—Yes.
1379. Did you try to raise a crop each year? —I
have tried each year since.
1380. In the sixth year you obtained another crop ?
—Yes.
1381. What was the first crop like?—l obtained
over 4 tons from 4 acres. The tobacco was sun-dried,
and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company bought
everything I had to sell at a fair price. I was well
satisfied with it. It returned me £l6O to the acre.
1382. Have you any idea what profit you got from
that?—l did not go into the figures, but there was a
substantial profit.
1383. Would there have been a profit of £lOO an
acre? —Yes, at sun-drying there would be.
1384. It cost £6O an acre to produce, and you made
a profit of £lOO an acre? —Yes, easily.
1385. During the next few years there was no crop ?
—Hothing that one could call a crop. One year I put
in 9 acres, and got only 13 cwt. Blue mould was the
trouble. In the sixth year I got another crop, har-
vesting 6 tons from 7-| acres —that crop was flue-
cured.
1386. What year was that?—-I cannot remember;
but I think it was about 1924.
1387. At that time had the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company given notices to the growers that
they were not prepared to buy any more sun-dried
leaf ?—Yes.
1388. Did that influence you in changing over from
sun-drying to flue-curing?— Yes; I changed over
wholly that year.
1389. What expense did it involve you in?— The
barns and plant cost me £750.
1390. Was that all the expense?—l had to get new
sticks, &c.; but I think that £750 covered the lot. I
intended to grow more tobacco; but when the crop
failed in so many years, I cut the area down and
planted lucerne.
1391. Did you have any difficulty in going back
to lucerne after tobacco? —Ho, it does not affect the
land in any way.
1392. You got 6 tons off 7-| acres, and you flue-cured
your crop. Did you have any difficulty in selling it ?
Ho.
1393. Was there much dark tobacco?— About a third
was dark; the rest was bright.
1394. Did you class it as bright?— Yes.
1395. And did the buyer accept your classification?
1396. What did he pay you for it?—l cannot re-
member.
1397. You told us that your return for the first
year was £l6O an acre, which yielded you a profit of
£lOO an acre. Can you remember when your first flue-
cured crop was sold what it yielded you ? It would cost
you more to produce, of course?— Yes.
1398. Would it be as much as £5O an acre?—lt
would cost £lOO an acre to produce. There were so
many failures.
1399. I am not taking failures into consideration.
What would be the cost of production for this one year ?
—My son took out the figures, and the return panned
out nearly Is. per lb.
1400. You consider it cost you £lOO an acre to pro-
duce?—Ho, £lOO a ton.
1401. How many tons did you get to the acre?—
Close on one ton —about 17 cwt., I think.
1402. Then we can refer to profits in terms of acres.
If I say you got £lOO an acre profit, I would be about
right?— Yes.
1403. The gross return was about £2OO an acre,
and the net profit about £lOO an acre?— Yes.
1404. So that you practically got the same profit
per acre for your flue-cured tobacco in 1924 as for your
sun-dried crop in 1917?— Yes, about the same. It costs
more to flue-cure tobacco.
1405. Allowing for the smaller capital invested, it
would be more profitable, according to your figures, to
grow sun-dried tobacco if there was a market for
it?— That is so.
1406. Do you employ Chinese?—Ho; my sons and
I employ casual labour.
1407. Can you pick up casual labour, and set it to
growing tobacco, with good results?— The trouble is
with grading. Casual labour can grow and cure
tobacco; but they must have experience to grade it
properly.
1408. Who does your grading?— Mostly myself.
1409. How did you learn it? —From Mr. Lough, or
the buyer, I took my cue from the buyer, because he
was the man I had to please.
1410. Who is Mr. Kefford ?—He is the ’ depart-
mental expert, assistant to Mr. Tregenna.
1411. Did you get advice and help from the experts?
—We got any advice we asked for. They never turned
us down.
1412. Did you ever write to Mr. Tregenna or to Mr.
Kefford for assistance?— Ho.
1413. So you depended on their calling on you. If
they did not come you did not care?— That is so.
1414. Did they help you in learning the art of
grading ?—Yes.
1415. Did they pay any visits to your place?— Yes,
each time they came to Tamworth.
1416. I suppose your view was that if you wanted
them at any time you could get them?— Yes.
1417. Did you ever write to the Hew South Wales
Agricultural Department for literature on tobacco-
growing?—Ho; my son may have done so.
1418. Did you ever receive any pamphlets or plant-
ing instructions from the department ?—I believe my
son did.
1419. You never felt the need of them?— Ho.
1420. How did you pick up the complicated art of
curing and grading tobacco without any real assistance
from any departmental expert?—We always got what
help we needed.
1421. Did you think it is an easy thing to master?
—There is not any great art in it; the main thing
is to get a crop. If you get a good crop it is easily
cured. If you put 7,000 plants to the acre on heavy
soil, you will get a good percentage of bright leaf.
Then, if you keep the water up to it, and do not let it
go back, the crop will be all right.
1422. Do you use an irrigation plant for your
tobacco ?—Yes.


1423. What did it cost?—£lso to £2OO. It is a
petrol engine, and the water, which is obtained from a
well, is run along the surface.
1424. You do not use any overhead spray?—No,
the water is carried along trenches.
1425. Have you ever considered overhead spraying?
—I do not think'it is any better than the other way.
I have seen a demonstration on the Tamworth "Race-
course, but I do not think it would be workable for
tobacco. There would be too much labour in shifting
the sprays.
1426. We inspected farms at Wangaratta, where
“ Noonan ” sprays were in use, and, apparently, giving
satisfaction?—l have asked Mr. Kefford about the
system, and he advised me not to touch it.
1427. I take it that you really learned what you
know about tobacco-growing through years of
experience on your own property, with a little help
from the department, and a considerable amount of
help from the British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s
buyer ?—Yes.
1428. The buyer, I presume, was Mr. Lough?— Yes.
1429. Does he come to your farm every year?— Four
or five years ago he used to come round and look at
the crop, and also wuitch the crop being cured. Mr.
Gilmour has also visited the place.
1430. Have they alw r ays imparted any information
you required ?—Yes.
1431. So far as grading is concerned, your desire is
to please the buyer?— Yes.
1432. When the buyer conies to your farm to inspect
do you show 7 him the tobacco graded out by yourself ?
-—lt is graded and put in different heaps before we
press it.
1433. Did he tell you w r hether it w 7 as well or badly
graded ?—He is not frightened to say what he thinks.
1434. If he says that it is badly graded, what do
you do ?—lt is all graded at one time; we do not grade
the barns as they are cured.
1435. But if the buyer tells you that the tobacco
is badly graded, what do you do then?—lt is prac-
tically too late then; we have to put up with it.
1436. Do you not consider it wnuld be a wise thing
to learn a bit more about grading with a view to
getting a better price?— Yes.
1437. Have you any ideas about the matter?—l
think it would be a good thing if an experienced man
were to come up and teach us. The grades vary in
different years. For instance, w 7 e might get three
grades of bright leaf in one year, and only two grades
in another year. Sometimes there might be as many
as four grades, including a small quantity of lemon.
1438. You grade entirely on colour?—-Yes.
1439. Are you any judge of aroma?—l smoke
c ' Sunday Best ” tobacco myself. As regards aroma,
I think it all depends on a man’s taste.
1440. Does the buyer pick the tobacco up, sniff it,
and say whether or not it has a good aroma? —He
always smells it.
1441. Does he pass any remark about the aroma? —
Yes; he sometimes says the aroma is good or other-
wise.
1442. What are you doing yourself to overcome the
difficulty in regard to grading. The buyers have told
us that the grading in the Tanrwor'th district is par-
ticularly bad. They say that the growers have not
mastered the art of grading, and that if the growers
could grade their tobacco better they would get better
prices. There is too much dark leaf, the buyers say,
and the leaf is badly graded?— There is no difficulty in
grading dark leaf. The trouble is that in grading
bright leaf a man is apt to become colour blind after
he has been on the job for some time. I sometimes
get that way myself.
1443. Would you say that was common amongst
growers ?—I can speak only for myself.
1444. Are you liable to put dark tobacco witb other
grades?—No, but if one has three colours of mahogany
one is liable to mix them.
1445. The buyer notices that?— Yes, unfortunately.
1446. Would it not pay to get expert assistance or
tuition ?—I would willingly pay for it if I could get
a man to grade the crop.
1447. Have you ever tried?— No. I cannot say that
I have.
1448. Is there any man in the district sufficiently
expert to be employed on such work?—l do not think
so, except the Government men.
1449, Do you think that the Government should assist
the growers in that respect?—No, but the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company could send men up to
the farmers to train them.
1450. But if the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany does not want to buy your tobacco, why should
they assist you ? —lf they could recommend a man to me
I would be prepared to pay him.
1451. If such a man graded your tobacco, and you
got a poor price for it, would you be satisfied?—l do
not know 7 that I would.
1452. It was suggested at Wangaratta that there
should be a central grading depot. Do you think that
a central depot at Tamworth, into which all the tobacco
growm in the district could be brought and properly
graded by experts, w 7 ould be acceptable to the growers"?
—I cannot see what would be w 7 rong with it.
1453. Have you read Dr. Darnell-Smith’s pamphlet
on conditions in America?— Yes.
1454. According to that the tobacco there is taken
to the local markets, where it is graded, and the buyer
purchases according to the grade. If it were prac-
ticable, to have such a system in Australia, do you think
the growers w 7 ould be favorably disposed towards it?—
I think they would.
1455. Would you be prepared to send your tobacco
here to Tamworth for sale ?—lt could not be brought
in in bulk and then graded. The growers would have
to grade it as we do, and then it wnuld be regraded.
1455 a. That is so; the experts grade it again and
the grower must take the price or leave it. Would that
be satisfactory?— Yes.
1456. Do you think it would be possible for the
growers to combine and establish a central grading
depot?—lt wnuld depend on the cost. There are not
so many growers in the district now as there were,
and the cost would be proportionately higher for each
one.
1457. If the growers received more for their tobacco
as the result of such grading, would it pay them?—
Yes.
1458. It has been said that the growers would
probably get more ?—Probably they would.
1459. To what do you attribute the reduction in the
number of growers in this district?— For one thing,
very few Chinese growers are left in the industry.
Also blue mould has driven a lot of growers out. Ido
not think that prices have anything to do with it.
1460. Have the growers made any serious attempt
to deal with blue mould?— Experiments have been
carried out by the experts, but Dr. Darnell-Smith says
that no good results have been achieved.
1461. Did he supervise the experiments?— Yes; the
experiments were carried out by my son under Dr.
Darnell-Smith’s supervision.
1462. Did you find out what w T as being done in other
tobacco-growing districts with a view 7 to overcoming
pests?—No; the trouble with blue mould is that one
man may get an excellent crop while his neighbour
across the road might have his crop completely wiped
out.
1463. Have you heard of the plan followed by many
growers in Victoria of getting their plants from mould-
free districts. For instance, many of the Wangaratta


growers get their plants from Bendigo and other
places ?—I always found that if the plants were healthy
in the bed, one could rely on getting a crop.
1464. Do you know of any growers here who follow
the practice adopted in Victoria?—No, not as a pre-
caution against blue mould.
1465. Do you think that if the growers thought they
could reduce their losses from blue mould by following
that course they would go to the trouble and expense
of doing so ?—I would, at any rate.
1466. Is the committee to believe that you are one
of the satisfied growers so far as price is concerned?—
Yes.
1467. In 1918 you averaged £lOO an acre profit for
your sun-dried tobacco?— Yes.
1468. Most of that was dark?— Yes, it was all dark.
1469. In 1924 you had changed over to flue-curing,
and again you averaged £lOO profit. How much bright
leaf did you have that year?—l had pretty well half
bright, if you call mahogany bright.
1470. During the first six years you had two crops
which were financially successful. What was your ex-
perience during the following years ?—Sometimes I got
a half crop, and sometimes only a quarter crop. Blue
mould was the trouble all the time.
1471. When did you last get a good crop?—l had a
good crop last year, but lost half of it by frost.
1472. Do you insure?—No, the premiums are pro-
hibitive. I insure the crop when it goes into the barn,
but to insure against hail one might as well give them
the whole lot.
1473. Do you mean that your crop last year was good
in quality?— Yes.
1474. How many acres did you have?— About 6|
acres. I had 1,611 lb. of bright mahogany No. 2, 36 11.
of lemon, 3,114 lb. of mahogany No. 2, and 428 lb. of
dark.
1475. So that you had a big proportion of bright,
and only a small proportion of dark? —Yes, about two
bales out of 25 were dark.
1476. And the buyer paid you on that basis?— Yes.
1477. What was your average price ?—I did not work
it out.
1478. What did you get for your dark tobacco?—
Is. 4d.
1479. Did the dark tobacco include any lemon?—No,
the lemon brought 2s. 6d. a lb., plus 6d.—l had only
36 lb. of that.
1480. What did you get for your bright tobacco? —
2s. 6d. a lb.
1481. There was only 6d. a lb. difference between the
bright and lemon coloured?— Yes.
1482. Do you think there is sufficient margin between
those two grades ?—Lemon is hard to get.
1483. Would you get as much as 10 per cent, lemon
in an average barn?—No; it depends on the year. If
you get an even crop you can produce some lemon.
1484. Your big line is your bright leaf?— Yes.
1485. Do you consider that with the present methods
of cultivation and the improvement in flue-curing dur-
ing the last few years the average grower is producing
a much larger proportion of bright leaf than formerly?
—Absolutely.
1486. What are the proportions to-day?—l have here
the figures for the crops of Mr. Steinbeck, of Dungowan.
1487. In all the time you have been growing tobacco
do you consider that the prices paid you by the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company have been satisfactory?
—Yes; I would not wish for anything better if I could
get a crop every year.
1488. By Mr. Jones. —Your percentage of lemon was
certainly a negligible quantity?— Yes.
1489. Would that be a fair average proportion for a
crop here?— No. For instance, Mr. Steinbeck had
499 lb. I had only about 3 tons of tobacco, but he had
11 tons.
1490. You got 36 lb. of lemon from 3 tons of tobacco?
—Yes. I had more in other years though.
1491. You said that some years the grower might
have as many as four grades of bright tobacco, including
lemon, and next year he might have only three or two ?
Yes, that is governed by the season. I think a moderate
fall of rain will produce a better article than irrigation.
1492. You said that if some dark leaves were put in
with the bright, it would adversely affect the price?—
Yes.
1493. Would not re-grading be a solution of that
difficulty ?—Sometimes the leaf will alter in the bulk.
1494. If a few dark leaves are included will the whole
lot be classified as dark? —We do not put dark leaves in
with bright, but we sometimes, by mistake, mix the
different grades of bright leaf.
1495, If a few lower brights were put in with other
of better quality would you accept the price for the
lower grade article, or would it be better to have the
whole re-graded?—l think it would be better to accept
the lower price. Unless a man had a proper place for
re-grading, the leaf would be so dry that it would be
impossible to handle it.
1496. Is blue mould still a big difficulty?— Yes, it is
our only great difficulty.
1497. Have you worked out the cost per ton of grad-
ing?—No; you see, I only work the tobacco crop in
with the other crops.
1498. By the Chairman. —We have had definite
grading. If we could find out how much a ton it costs
to grade tobacco we might be able to find out whether
it would be cheaper for a man to do his own grading,
and to put up with the lower price, or to get an expert
to grade ?—I think it would pay to get the grading done
evidence from the buyers that one of the big problems
is grading, and that the growers are complaining about
prices when the real cause of the low prices is the bad
properly.
1499. By Mr. Morgan. —You say that the blue mould
is your chief enemy?— Yes.
1500, Have you gone into the matter of soil condi-
tions, as they affect the quality of the crops?—Of course
some people have better land than others, but if one gets
an even crop of tobacco one can always rely on getting
good colour.
1501. You are satisfied that the soil here is all that
can be desired?—l have never had any tobacco left on
my hands.
1502, Do you consider that your area of 6£ acres
provides you with sufficient data to form the conclusion
you hold?—I had 25 acres.
1503. Do you think that scientific investigation is
worth while?—l have £750 sunk in plant and fittings,
and if I do not use that plant, the money is a dead
loss.
1504. But do you think that scientific research in
regard to this industry is worth while ?—I think it is.
1505. Do you consider that you are producing a better
article generally as a result of such investigation ?—We
are producing a better quality than we used to.
1506. Then, if the scientific people, as a result of
their researches, told you that you are growing tobacco
on land which is unsuitable, what would you say?—
The testimony of the experts is so conflicting. Some
say that we have produced beautiful tobacco; others
contradict them. Whom are we to believe?
1507. Have you read the report of Mr. Slagg on the
smoking qualities of Australian tobacco?— Yes.
1508. Have you seen the statement to the effect that
tobacco is being grown on land which is unsuitable for
it ?—I do not think that is right. My own land is cer-
tainly fairly heavy, but I have never had any tobacco
left on my hands. If the company could not make use
of my tobacco, they would not buy it.


1509. You are satisfied that you are proceeding along
right lines?—l am satisfied that a pipe smoker can
smoke whatever is produced here.
1510. By the Chairman. —ls your soil heavy or light?
—Fairly light.
1511. Have the experts ever pointed out to you that
your soil is unsuitable?—l would not care who said it
was unsuitable. Until the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company refuses to buy my tobacco I shall go on grow-
ing it.
1512. Has the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany’s buyer ever said that your soil was unsuitable?—
Ho.
1513. Have you formed any opinion as to the actual
smoking qualities of the tobacco grown in the Tamwortb
district? —Yes, I can smoke “Waratah” tobacco.
1514. That is not necessarily Tamwortb tobacco?—
I have not seen Tamwortb tobacco manufactured by
itself. As for smoking the raw leaf, I have American
leaf in my cellar at home, and the experts, after trying
it, have put it aside. Even they are liable to slip.
1515. Did the expert turn the Australian tobacco
down also?— Yes; he said none of it was much good.
1516. Have you smoked any all-Australian tobacco?
—I have smoked “ Waratah”. It is all right, but the
trouble is to get it.
1517. Did you notice any objectionable aroma about
it? —At first it burnt my tongue. When I could not
get it I smoked “ Sunday Best ”. Afterwards, when
I went back to the old tobacco again, it also burnt my
tongue.
1518. How do you account for the fact that the
demand for “Waratah” has fallen off. The company
says that for the first two years after it was put on
the market, the sales were very satisfactory. Then
there was an enormous drop, and to-day the demand is
practically negligible?—At first it was only done up in
paper packages, not in tins, and it used to get very dry,
1519, Is it not in tins now?—l have never seen it in
tins. Nobody stocks it in Tamwortb.
1520. Have you tried “ Signet ” tobacco; it is half
Australian and half American?— No.
1521. Do you think that the sales of “Waratah”
tobacco fell off because it was not done up in tins?—l
could not buy it in Tamwortb.
1522. By Mr. Morgan. —Would you attribute the fall-
ing off in sales to a change of public taste?— Pr-
obably.
1523. By Mr. Jones. —lf you could not get the Aus-
tralian brands in country towns would you say that
would contribute to the falling off in demands? —I
should say it would.
1524. By Mr. Morgan. —The company representa-
tives say that they advertised the Australian tobaccos,
and that in 1926 11,000 lb. were sold; in 1929, sales
had fallen to 1,000 lb. Obviously, it would not pay the
company to keep on advertising it at that rate?—l do
not suppose it would.
1525. By Mr. Martens. —Do you remember whether
the falling off took place about the time the alleged
eucalpytus taint was mentioned?—l cannot say.
1526. Have you seen advertisements for “ Country
Life” cigarettes?— No.
1527. Has “Waratah” tobacco been obtainable in
Tamwortb at any time?— Yes.
1528. When you were unable to buy it, did you ever
ask why people would not smoke it?—No; when I could
not get it I began smoking “ Sunday Best ”.
1529. By Mr. Jones. —You say that you inquired for
“Waratah”, and were not able to get it? —That is so.
1530. Do you know of any others who had a similar
experience?—l do not know of any others.
1531. Would you say that the fact of this tobacco
being unobtainable in country towns was a strong
reason for the decline in sales?— Yes.
1532. By the Chairman. —You have some evidence to
put in on behalf of Mr. E. E. Steinbeck?— Yes.
1533. How long has he been growing tobacco?— The
newspaper comment which I proposed to read relates
to 1924, and evidently he was growing tobacco before
that. The following paragraph appeared in the
Northern Daily Leader, of 25th April, 1924: —
Mr. E. R. Steinbeck, of Dungowan, has 22 acres under
tobacco, and it is estimated that he will have a return of
15 tons of flue-cured leaf. This crop is considered both by Mr.
Tregenna, State tobacco expert, and Mr. Gilmour, of the
British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Ltd., to be the best and
most even crop, as far as quality and quantity are concerned,
that has ever been grown in Australia.
It is also considered to be the nearest approach to the
best American leaf that has yet been grown in Australia, and
as well as having a pleasant aroma, flues to the right colour—
the mahogany shade.
I have here Mr. Steinbeck’s figures for the 1928-29 crop.
In that year he had 71 bales altogether. This included
19 bales of bright mahogany; 36 bales of mahogany,
and 6 bales of No. 3 mahogany. There w T ere two bales
of inferior bright, and 8 bales of No. 2 dark.
1534. So that out of that crop he had 10 bales which
were either dark or inferior bright?— Yes.
1535. And 61 were classed as bright?— Yes.
1536. What prices were received for that tobacco?
1537. Mr. Bentley. —That year, Mr. Steinbeck had
16 bales - of dark and inferior bright tobacco out of
71 bales. For 19 bales of bright mahogany (No. 1),
he received 2s. 3d. per lb.; plus 6d. bonus. For 36
bales of mahogany (No. 1), he received Is. 9d., plus
3d. bonus; for 6 bales of mahogany (No. 3), he re-
ceived 25.; for 2 bales of No. 3 dark he received Is.,
and for 8 bales of inferior dark he received 6d. His
average price was Is. ll.Sld. In 1929, he had 2 bales
of lemon, 17 bales of bright mahogany (No. 1), 37
bales of bright mahogany (No. 2), and 43 bales of
mahogany (No. 3) ; his average price was 2s. 5.35 d.
per lb.
1538. Has Mr. Steinbeck got the best tobacco-growing
soil in the district?—He gets the best colour. As a
rule sandy loam produces light tobacco.
1539. Is there much of that land in the district?—
Yes, but the trouble is to get it irrigated. Mr. Sieinbeck
irrigates his tobacco.
1540. Does it mean that the tobacco area is limited
to ihe river flats?— Yes.
1541. There is no prospect of its spreading all over
the whole district? —No.
1542. By Mr. Morgan. —lt must be grown on alluvial
deposits, and on rich soil?— Yes. It is almost impossible
to grow tobacco without irrigation.
1543. By Jie Chairman. —How far away are you
from the river?—l am half a mile away, but I am on
the flat.
1544. Is the only suitable land in the Tamwortb dis-
trict on or near the river flats?— Yes.
1545. How much is there of that?—lt extends right
along the Peel Yalley, also along the Dungowan Creek
and Duncan’s Creek.
1546. Would you say that the tobacco-growing area
in this district extends from Dungowan to Manilla?—
It extends from this side of Nundel to Manilla,
1547. Is Mr. Steinbeck satisfied with the price he
receives for his tobacco?— Yes, he wished me to inform
the committee to that effect.
1548. By Mr. Morgan. —Are the returns obtained by
Mr. Steinbeck and Mr. Chaffey representative of what
growers receive in this district? —They go to show, at
any rate, what can be done if there is a good season.
They are, of course, the extremes, and I do not think
they could be beaten in America as regards the amount
of bright tobacco produced.
1549. At Wangaratta, several growers led us to be-
lieve that it did not pay under existing conditions to
produce tobacco. Your figures show that it is a


thoroughly lucrative proposition?—l have given you
the figures only for the best years; over a number of
years the return would not be the same,
1550. You said that you desired nothing better?—
Neither I would if I could get a crop every year. Blue
mould is our great trouble.
1551. We were told at Wangaratta that tobacco-
growing was a losing proposition. Your evidence to-day
gives an entirely different impression. Do you think
the Wangaratta people were right in saying that it
was a losing proposition?—l would not take on tobacco
growing by itself.
1552. Do you know anybody who does?—l was
foolish to do it for five years.
1553. By Mr. Martens. —What price would be re-
quired to make tobacco-growing profitable over a
number of years?—lt is payable at 2s. a lb. all round.
There are more misses than crops.
1554. With one good year in three, what price would
you require?—l do not bother much about it now. I
have practically given the business up. Only that I
have the barns there I would not bother growing
tobacco.
1555. By the Chairman. —Supposing you got one
good crop out of three, would 2s. a lb,, year in, year
out, pay you?— No.
1556. Would 3s. be enough?—l have never gone into
the figures. My son, who has kept the figures, said
that the expenses would run into £lOO a ton over the
two years.
1557. Then your profit would be £5O an acre over
the two years. Would that not pay you?— No.
1558. Would any other crop produce that amount?
—I do not suppose it would.
1559. Some Wangaratta growers told us that £5O
an acre profit would pay them handsomely ?—I suppose
it would if they got it every year. In my case I was
at it for five years, and did not get a crop. Last year
[ got a crop, and lost half of it with the frost.
1560. If you get one good crop in three, and average
£lOO an acre profit for a good year, your average profit
would be £33 an acre. Would that pay?— Yes, that
would pay.
1561. Could we say your opinion is that, if the
tobacco-growers could average £3O an acre profit year
in year out, they would have very little to growl about ?
—I was wrong when I said that £33 an acre profit
would pay. Taking everything into consideration it
would not. One has to consider the overhead expenses,
the outlay on plant, the cost of irrigation, &c.
1562. By Mr. Morgan. —ls the committee justified
in assuming that you are quite satisfied with the prices
received for tobacco, but that the seasons are wrong?
—Yes, we are too much handicapped by the diseases
we have to fight.
1563. By the Chairman. —l understood the growers’
argument was that they wanted a bigger price because
of the bad seasons?— That is so.
1564. By Mr. Jones. —Would you say that the crops
for 1928-29 which have been mentioned were about
the best as regards quality of leaf and price received
of all those produced in the Tamworth district?— Yes,
I think so.
1565. They were by no means average crops?— Som-
ewhere near the average.
The witness withdrew.
Michael John Connors, farmer, Tamworth, was called,
sworn and examined.
1566. By the Chairman. —Are you a member of the
Northern Tobacco-growers Association?— Yes.
1567. Do you grow tobacco?—No, not now.
1568. Have you been a grower?— Yes, in 1924.
1569. How long had you been growing before that?
—For five years. I was at it three years before that,
but the crops were a total failure.
1570. When did you first start?—ln 1910; I wag
sun-curing then.
1571. Were you growing with Chinese labour?—Ho,
with white labour. I worked the place myself with the
assistance of other labour.
1572. What has been your experience of tobacco-
growing since 1910?— On the whole the results achieved
were very poor. The crops, taking it all round, were
all right; but the prices were no good.
1573. What crop did you have in 1910?— Nothing
worth talking of; the crop was a total failure through
blue mould.
1574. What w-as the biggest crop you got from sun-
dried tobacco ?—Twenty-eight and a half hundred-
weight off 15 acres.
1575. That did not pay you? —No, the trouble that
year was blue mould. That -was in 1921, and the
following year I got one bale, about 216 lb. We had
blue mould again that year. In 1923 I got about 60
lb. In 1924 the crop was wiped out altogether.
1576. That was the sum total of your experience?—
Yes, I have had no experience of flue-curing.
1577. Over the whole fourteen years your biggest
crop was 28 cwt?—Yes; the only reason I can give
is that I went on to virgin soil on the river fiat. I was
advised to do so by Mr. Tregenna.
1578. You had already had experience yourself, and
thought you would try a new line?—-Yes.
1579. You sought the expert’s advice?— Yes, it was
a light and dark mixture of soil.
1580. That bears out what Mr. Tregenna told you
—that you would get a better crop on that soil?—We
tried everything possible; we even tried an electrical
treatment for the seeds. The only result was that the
seeds germinated five days earlier than the others; but
it did not prevent blue mould. I obtained some plants
from Sydney, and although there was no sign of blue
mould when they arrived, they developed the disease
afterwards. I also got some plants from Maitland,
They were not a total failure, but the mould was
there.
1581. You know nothing about flue-curing?— No.
1582. Can you tell us anything about the industry
generally in this district. Is it going back?— Most
decidedly it is. Many growers have gone out of it
altogether.
1583. What do you put that down to?— The uncer-
tainty of the crop, and the uncertainty of selling a
sun-dried crop.
1584. How many growers are here now?—l cannot
say.
1585. Would there be a 100?— I do not think so.
Were there more growers in the district when
sun-drying was in vogue than there are now?— Yes.
1587. Is it a fact that in those days most of the
tobacco was grown by Chinese labour?— Yes.
1588. There are not many Chinese here now?— No.
1589. Is the change over to flue-curing responsible
for the reduction in the number of growers ?—That is
one reason, and the other is that the prices received
were not adequate to remunerate growers.
1590. Your opinion is that most of the men who have
gone out did so because they could not get enough for
their tobacco, allowing for the bad season?— That is
80.
1591. You admit that your case is one of the worst
in the district?— Yes.
1592. Would you say that those who have gone into
the industry to-day as flue-curers have done very much
better than those who were in it as sun-dryers ?—I do
not know that they have done much better.


v 1593. Do they speak optimistically of the future of
the industry?— Decidedly they do not.
1594. Are many of the growers dissatisfied with the
prices received?— Yes, many of them.
1595. Do you say that the evidence given by Mr. Lye
represented an exceptional case ?—I should say so.
1596. You heard him say that he was satisfied with
the price if he could get a crop?—l heard that.
1597. Do you think that the other men in the district
would be the same? —If they were sure of a crop every
year, the price might pay them. The difficulty is that
we do not get a crop except once in five years.
1598. But that is not the general experience in the
district, is it ?—I think ,so. Over the last ten years the
average has been one good crop in five.
1599. By Mr. Parhes. —Did you employ Chinese
labour ?—Ho.
1600. It was the exception at that time not to employ
Chinese?—lt was the exception.
1601. Do you suggest that that was one reason for
your lack of success? —No.
1602. But Mr. Steinbeck has always employed
Chinese labour, and has always been successful? —•
That may be so.
The ivitness withdrew.
George Albert Lye was recalled and further examined.
1603. Witness. —l was asked by one member of the
committee wdiether I tried to get plants from elsewdiere.
While I did not send to other districts for plants, I
have tried growing my own plants out on the hills for
three years. They were grown at a considerable dis-
tance from the place they were planted out, but the
result w r as not much better than when they were grown
on the same ground.
1604. By Mr. Parhes. —Did Mr. Steinbeck use
Chinese labour to produce the crops concerning which
you gave evidence?— Yes.
The witness withdrew.
Reginald Augustus Hewlett, tobacco-grower, Pialla-
more, Tamworth, sworn and examined.
1605. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
in this district?—l have been in the Tamworth dis-
trict for five years.
1606. Have you been growing under flue-curing con-
ditions ?—Yes.
1607. With Chinese labour? —The first year I had a
white man on. I had beautiful plants, but they w T ere
wiped out by mould. The second year I grew by
myself with white labour. The next year I had no
crop at all, and the last two years, not including this
year, I grew on shares with Chinese labour.
1608. What has your experience been?— The first
year w r as a failure due to excessive rains and the blue
mould. I did not plant out. The second year 1
planted 4 acres, from which I got 35 cw T t. of tobacco.
Two acres of that got the mould in the paddock, and
the other 2 acres were a good average crop. The next
year the crop was a failure. The fourth year, with
Chinese labour, I planted 7 acres and got about 4
tons. Last year I had a very good crop, but most of
it was destroyed by frost and hail. I got 35 cwt.
altogether.
1609. Your experience has not been satisfactory?—
It has not.
1610. Has it paid you to be in tobacco?— The year
1 grew by myself the return was £350, out of which 1
had to pay labour, cost of irrigation, &c. I do not
know what the net profit was; £350 was the gross
return.
1611. Your profit could not have been very much?
-No.
1612. What was your best year?— The best year was
1928. 1 had about 4 tons of tobacco, and my return
was a little over £BOO. Of that the Chinese obtained
two-thirds, and my share was one-third.
1613. Did it pay you that year?— Yes, it paid.
1614. Would you be satisfied'with that every year?
—Yes.
1615. Do you consider the prices being paid are
fairly satisfactory, without regard to seasonal condi-
tions?—l think so. Last year I had three bales left
on my hands. The buyer said it had a green tinge,
and was a little frost bitten.
1616. Did you keep that tobacco ?—I still have it.
1617. Has it improved?—l have not examined it.
1618. We have had evidence that a buyer at Wan
garatta offered 4d. a lb. for certain tobacco. The nexl
year it had improved so much that the buyer offered
Is. 4d.?—l am keeping mine.
1619. Are you any judge of the smoking quality of
the Tamworth tobacco? —I am not a heavy smoker.
1620. Do you get a large proportion of bright leaf
in your crop?— Last year I had 23 bales of tobacco,
including the three which were not bought. Bor five
bales I received 2s. 9d., plus 6d. bonus, and for fifteen
bales I received 25., without any bonus.
1621. Were those fifteen bales dark tobacco? —Ho,
they were bright. I had no dark tobacco, with the
exception of the parcel that was rejected as being green
1622. What sort of soil have yon ?—lt is not heavy
soil; it is medium.
1623. Do you irrigate?— Yes, I bought the plant with
the farm.
The witness withdrew.
Colin Hyson, tobacco-grower, Kootingal, via Tam-
w r orth, was called, sw T orn and examined.
1624. By the Chairman.— How long have you been
growing tobacco? —For six years.
1625. Are you a member of the Horthern Tobacco
Growers Association?— Yes.
1626. Have you been growing under flue-curing con-
ditions ?—Always.
1627. What sort of soil do you grow on?—lt is river
fiat, but the soil is not heavy. It cannot be classed as
sandy either. There are certain clay deposits.
1628. Have you been employing Chinese labour?—
On two occasions.
1629. What has been your experience. Have you
had much blue mould ? —Blue mould has been the chief
cause of any failures I have had.
1630. Have you had many failures?— Yes, several.
On two occasions I have had practically no tobacco al
all.
1631. What has been your experience during the
other four years ?—Apart from one year wffien I got a
very good crop, the other crops have been only
moderately successful. Last year the crop was good,
but it was spoilt by the frost. Much of the trouble
lias been due, not so much to blue mould, as to insect
pests. On two occasions I have had no plants at
all, and have had to get some from other parts of the
district.
1632. How far away did you go for them?—On one
occasion I got plants from Wallamore, and on another
occasion I got them from Dungowan, about twelve or
fourteen miles away.
1633. What proportion of dark tobacco did you have?
—More than half.
1634. Would it be as much as 70 per cent.?— Yes.
1635. Is that due to the nature of the soil?— 1
would explain it by saying that it was due to my having
to w'ait for plants because the growers would not part


them until they had finished their own planting. That
left me late, and gave me only a short growing season.
I have had some good coloured leaf, the best year being
1926. Last year I cured only two barns of tobacco,
which was practically all bottom leaves, there being no
bright amongst it. I sold it all except ten bales which
were frost bitten. The tobacco was inspected by the
State expert, and he was of the opinion that it was all
right. Mr. Kefford did not give me any indication that
the tobacco would be unsaleable. I went to the expense
of getting it ready, and now I cannot sell it,
1636. Did you grade it yourself?— Yes.
1637. You said that 1926 was your best year. How
much bright tobacco did you have then?—l grew a
good deal of bright tobacco on sandy soil, not on the
river flat.
1638. You did not persevere with the sandy soil?—
I have planted more this year, but the weather has
been dry, and the land is not irrigable.
1639. Do you consider that the prices you have
received for tobacco over the six years you have heen
growing have been remunerative?— Tobacco-growing is
practically my living.
1640. Do you not go in for anything else?—Probabh
a little corn and lucerne.
1641. What is the biggest area you have ever had
under tobacco?— Last year I had 20 acres, and in 1926.
I had 30 acres.
1642. You are making it your sole means of liveli-
hood ?—Yes.
1643. Has it provided you with sufficient to live on?
—That is about all. lam generally behind at the bank
when the next crop comes along.
1644. Is that position due mainly to the difficulty of
getting a decent crop ?—Yes, I think I can attribute it
to that.
1645. What was your average price last year?—
About Is. 7d. a lb.
1646. You had a good percentage of dark leaf?—lt
was all dark.
1647. And you got Is. 7d. a lb. on an average for
your dark leaf?— Yes.
1648. Mr. Bentley. —His average price for the year
was Is. sd. a lb.
1649. By the Chairman. —Do you think that was a
fair price, or did you expect more?— For the quality,
I think it was. The best leaf is taken from the centre
of the plant, but I did not get any of that quality. I
had to go over the crop twice to get a barn full.
1650. Seeing that you had such a large proportion
of dark tobacco, you are not altogether dissatisfied with
the price the company paid you?—lt would not pay to
produce wholly dark tobacco at the price I received.
1651. Do you think you are reducing your quantity
of dark leaf?— Yes.
1662. What steps are you taking to that end?— Last
year I did not alter my tactics, but that was mainly due
to the fact that the plant was not able to mature before
it was cured.
1653. Are you doing your own curing?— Yes.
1654. Who taught you?— Mr. Tregenna and Mr. Kef-
ford. They are always willing to help me.
1655. Have you ever written to the department for
literature on the tobacco industry?—Ho, but I have
received it and read it.
1656. Are you a keen student of the tobacco industry
in other countries?—Ho, I cannot say that I am.
1657. Do you consider that you are improving as a
curer?—From my results I cannot say that I am. If
I have reasonably good tobacco, well matured and care-
fully selected, I can produce a good article out of the
barn.
1658. Do you think that the prices the company is
paying for bright tobacco and dark are sufficient to
encourage men who have suitable soil, and who are keen
on the industry, to continue growing?— Yes, provided
the company will take our dark tobacco, but I do not
think it is a payable proposition if we produce one-
third of dark leaf and it is left on our bands.
1659. have been taking your dark leaf with the
exception of the frost bitten stuff?— Yes.
1660. Have they given you any notice that they will
not take your dark tobacco —lt has been reported in
the press that the percentage is to be reduced.
1661. What would you say was a fair percentage of
dark leaf ?—I should say that 30 per cent, would be a
fair thing. The company should take 30 per cent of
the dark leaf frorh the Tam worth district.
1662. Would you say that it would be too much to
expect to companies to buy 50 per cent, of the dark
tobacco from the Tam worth district?—l do not think
there would be that much dark leaf produced.
1663. Have you seen any published statement regard-
ing the high percentge of dark tobacco produced in the
Tam worth district?—l have read the newspapers, and
I have seen Mr. Tregenna’s evidence to that effect.
1664. What have you to say on that matter?— From
my knowledge of local conditions, and the experience
of other growers, I should say that Mr. Tregenna is
wrong.
1665. Is the improvement of recent date?—lt has
been most marked during the last two or three years.
1666. Would you say that the district is capable to-
day of producing at least 50 per cent, or 60 per cent,
of bright leaf?— Yes, probably more.
1667. But you have not done as well as that?—Ho,
but a friend of mine on the opposite side of the river,
Mr. Wilson, produced somewhere about 70 per cent!
or 80 per cent, of bright leaf last year.
1668. Is it possible, do you think, by improved
method of cultivation and curing to bring the average
of bright leaf produced in the Tamworth district up
to 70 per cent.?—l think so.
1669. Are the tobacco-growers here improving in
their methods of cultivation and curing?—l am sure
they are.
1670. Do you think they are keen on the industry?—
Some of them must be keen because they are staying
on in the industry. Others are a little disappointed,
and frightened that the company will not take their
dark leaf.
1671. Do you think that that fear is driving men
out of the industry?— Yes.
1672. Do you know of any who have gone out because
of that?—l know of two men who have gone out; Mr.
William Sage, of Kootingal, and Mr. K. Gill, of the
same district.
1673. Did they go out because they were producing
too much dark tobacco I — I cannot express their point
of view, but I think that was the reason.
1674. By Mr. Martens. —As a result of your studies,
have you arrived at any conclusion as to the cause of
blue mould ?—I have noticed that rain with cold changes
from the south brings the mould. I have had mould
practically every season until this year, when I had a
considerable amount of plants which I sowed myself.
1675. By Mr. Jones. —Has there beeu any season here
absolutely free from blue mould?— Hot throughout the
whole district.
1676. A Wangaratta grower said that he was no
longer frightened of blue mould. Are any of the growers
here so confident?—l am not, and Ido not think the
others are.
1677. By the Chairman.—Do you know whether the
growers, through their association, have made any con-
certed effort to combat blue mould?— Several members
have tried schemes of their own, and experiments have
been carried out by the department, but they are just
as far off from the solution of the difficutly as ever


1678. Do you know of any men in the district who
are not frightened of blue mould; who say they can beat
it every time ?—I have heard that there were such men,
but they think differently now.
1679. By Mr. Bentley. —Have you ever seriously con-
sidered getting off your present land?— Yes.
1680. Your case is an exceptional one. In 1926 you
got a large crop, but your average price was only Is. sd.
per lb. You have not improved that average?— No.
1681. On the other hand your neighbour across the
river is getting nearly twice as much as you have
been. Is not that due to your bad soil?—lt may be
so, and it may be due to the fact that the soil used by
him has been cropped continuously for the past 30
years.
1682. You only go in for tobacco, and expect our
company to take your dark leaf from you ?—I have not
been able to secure plants in time to allow the tobacco
to mature. I feel confident that, given a reasonable
growing season, I could produce tobacco on my country
that would be practically up to the standard which my
neighbour produces. In the past I have been handi-
capped in getting plants.
1683. By the Chairman. —Have you taken any steps
to overcome that difficulty?—l have tried to grow
plants in different parts of the paddock, and also in
the sand.
1684. Have you consulted the experts about it?—
Mr. Kefford mentioned the practice of the Victorian
growers in securing their plants from other districts.
1685. Is it good enough for you to depend on a hap-
hazard system of getting your plants from other
growers?—lt does not seem good business.
1686. Do you expect the company to buy tobacco
that they do not want?— No.
1687. They have never refused to take your tobacco,
except the frost-bitten stuff?— That is so.
1688. What are you going to do about your dark
tobacco? —If I cannot get a better quality I shall have
to give the game up.
1689. You think that the company should take 30
per cent, of dark leaf?— Yes, one needs to sell the whole
of one’s crop. I think that 70 per cent, of light leaf
is a fair thing.
1690. If the company paid the existing prices for
dark tobacco, and bought the bright leaf at 2s. a lb.
on an average, would it be payable to the growers?—l
think that it would be payable to the growers if they
could average 2s. a lb. for their dark and bright leaf.
1691. Have you lost money at tobacco-growing?—l
have not lost money; but it is not the proposition it
should have been.
1692. By Mr. Martens. —What is the approximate
cost of producing tobacco?—lt costs about £lOO a ton
to get the tobacco ready for sale. If the crop is bad, or
the weather is dry, it is necessary to employ more
labour than in a good growing season,
1693. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you think the obligation
is upon the company to buy what it does not want
rather than on you to produce what the company does
want?— The obligation is on me.
1694. By the Chairman. —What percentage of dark
leaf has the company informed you they will take this
year?—l cannot remember what figure was mentioned.
1695. By Mr. Parkes. —Your great trouble is that
you cannot sell the whole of your crop ?—I have always
sold my leaf with the exception of frosted leaf this
year.
1696. In the past you would have been able to sell
the tobacco you have produced this year. It is the
standard that has been raised?—l think the standard
has been raised.
1697. By the Chairman. —Have you anything to
add?—l think the industry would be benefited by the
establishment of an experimental station in this district
where experiments could be carried out, and possibly
where experts could grow plants and supply them to
the farmers. Such a station might also help in com-
batting blue mould.
1698. By Mr. Jones. —ls any experimental work
being done in New South Wales? —Some has been done
in Bathurst; but we do not hear much about it, and I
do not think that anything done there would help us
here very much. Conditions vary so greatly.
The witness withdrew
John Bernard Pearson, farmer, Wallamore, Tamworth,
was called, sworn and examined.
1699. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco-grower?
—Not at the present time.
1700. You have been, though?— Yes.
1701. For how long?—I started in 1912,
1702. Have you been growing ever since? —Until
about three or four years ago.
1703. Were you sun-drying all the time?—l had
only one year of flue-curing.
1704. When did you last grow tobacco?—ln 1926.
1705. Did you have a crop every year?— No.
1706. How many years did you miss?—l cannot
remember, I never kept a record. Sometimes there
would only be a small crop.
1707. You always had some tobacco?—l had some
nearly every year.
1708. What was the biggest area of sun-dried tobacco
you ever grew?—ln 1912 I had 30 acres. That was my
biggest crop. For the best of it I got Bd, a lb.
1709. Was it grown on heavy soil? —On river flat.
1710. Did you get a ton to the acre?— Yes, I had
30 tons altogether.
1711. Was it mostly dark?— Nearly all of it was
dark.
1712. What did you receive for it?—l received Bd.
per lb. for the best of it, and per lb. for the second
grade.
1713. Do you consider that Bd. per lb. was a low
price for dark tobacco in that year?—l did not make
much out of it. It was grown on shares with Chinese
labour. After that I kept on growing, hoping to get
better results. In 1914 I had a fair crop, which I
sun-dried, and for which I obtained a fairly good
price. In 1915 I got up to Is. for sun-dried
tobacco. That was the biggest price I ever got.
1714. Do you consider that it was a good price for
sun-dried leaf?—lt was a payable price.
1715. Was that dark leaf?—lt was not dark; it was
mixed. There was a lot of good coloured tobacco in
it.
1716. In 1926 you went in for flue-curing. Did
you erect barns? —Yes, I built three flues.
1717. Did you put in any other plant?— No. I
already had the other plant.
1718. What did the barns cost you?—l built them
myself with the help of my sons. The material cost
about £6O0 —that was, £2OO each. I built them of
galvanized iron and timber, and filled up underneath
with earth. I had cement foundations, and put
rubberoid underneath the roof.
1719. Where did you learn how to flue cure?— The
experts taught us. Mr. Tregenna and Mr. Kefford told
us how to run the flues. I tried to follow their instruc-
tions regarding temperatures, &c. Apart from that I
had no expert assistance.
1720. Did you employ any labour?—l had my son
helping me, together with two other men.
1721. Did you have a good crop in 1926?—1t was
a middling crop. I had two sons growing on their
own, with white labour. I grew with Chinese labour.


I had about 18 tons, apart from what my sons grew.
They grew about 10 or 11 tons. We had about 30
tons between us, all of which was flue-cured.
1722. Was it cured in the three barns?— Yes.
1723. You were in charge of the curing?—l and my
sons. We knew nothing about curing except what
instructions we had received.
1724. Did the experts go to the farm?— Mr.
Trcgenna came, and Mr. Kefford also came to the
place once or twice.
1725. Did they spend much time there?— Only a few
minutes at a time. They told us how to run the heater
during the different stages.
1726. Did they come back to look at the tobacco
afterwards?— Yes, after it was finished.
1727. What did they think of your efforts?—l do
not know that they expressed any opinion.
1728. Did they say that you had carried out their
instructions?— Mr. Tregenna picked out some leaves
and said he thought we had raised the temperature too
quickly. Sometimes we did a bit of experimenting on
our own, but the result was generally the same.
1729. So you cured your tobacco by a series of experi-
ments of your own?—We did afterwards. At first we
tried to carry out the instructions we received. After-
wards, when we were not satified with the results, we
varied the method.
1730. Did you spoil any of your tobacco?—lt was
not bad; but it was not what I expected it to be. We
were told to wilt it in the barns. Often the leaf was
damp when we put it in. I got better results from
sun-drying than flue-curing as far as colour was con-
cerned.
_ 1731. When the buyer looked at your tobacco what
did he say?— When the boys were sorting their tobacco
the buyer said that it would pay them to go down to
Sydney for a fortnight and get an idea of how to do
the work. I consider that it cost the boys 3d. per lb.
to grade their tobacco.
1732. Did the white men you employed have any
previous experience ?—ISTo.
1733. You called in inexperienced men for grading?
—lt was the first time they had done any work of the
kind.
1734. You might have lost another 3d. per lb.
through bad grading?—l do not know about that; but
I know it took them a long time to do the work.
1735. What price was paid for that crop?
1736. Mr. Bentley. —ln 1926 Pearson Brothers
averaged 19.39 d. per lb. The average price received
by J. B. Pearson was Is. 6.2 d. per lb.
1737. By the Chairman. —Your sons did not do very
much better than you did?— They did not do as well.
They got a better average price; but it cost them
a lot more to produce their crop. I estimate that it
cost them 3d. per lb. for grading.
1738. It did not cost you anything?— The Chinese
did not grade the tobacco; they just sorted it into
firsts and seconds.
1739. Why did you not grow after 1926?—1t did not
pay. I could not get Chinese labour, and from my
sons’ experience I knew that it was not a payable pro-
position.
1740. Did you work out the figures?—Ho; but my
sons did, and they found that they were not making
wages.
1741. By Mr. Jones. —-Is Chinese labour cheaper
than white labour?— They work longer hours, and
actually it is cheaper.
1742. What does white labour cost?—My sons were
paying £1 for eight hours’ work at flue-curing.
1743. But you would have to er 'loy white D T wr
for curing, in any case?— Yes.
1744. By the Chairman. —What white labour did
your sons engage that you did not? —They cured their
crops with white labour, whereas I had the Chinese
on shares.
1745. I understand that you made a piofit that last
year?—l did, and I did not, because the tobacco flues
cost all I got.
1746. So you want to put that £6OO on to the year’s
cost?—lt has been of no use to me since.
1747. Apart from the flues you would have shown a
profit, mainly owing to the Chinese labour?— Yes.
1748. Why did you not continue growing after 1926?
—I could not get suitable Chinese labour, and I con-
sidered it would not pay to employ white labour. I
came to that conclusion as a result of my sons’
experience. One of my sons told me that he had
received, as a result of the year’s operations, only £lOO
for his own labour.
1749. May we take it that you have not gone on
with tobacco-growing because the price of Is, per
lb. did not pay you?—lt might have paid me if I had
been able to get good labour.
1750. Do you think it reasonable to load the cost
of installing flues on to that one year’s crop ?—lf I had
kept on growing, the flues wmuld have paid for them-
selves eventually.
1751. The w 7 hole thing is that you cannot grow
tobacco profitably with white labour?— That is so.
1752. Have you considered that you might get a
better price by employing white labour wliich would
produce a better quality of tobacco. You heard Mr.
Lye say that 2s. a lb. all round wmuld be profitable?
—Taking one year with another, I do not think that it
would be a very payable proposition at 2s. a lb.
1753. In 1926 you suffered from two serious diffi-
culties—one w r as that you were inexperienced in flue-
curing, and the other w 7 as that you had done no grading
at all?—Ho, I did not grade.
1754. Have you anything else you would like to tell
the committee ? —I came to the Tamworth district in
1887, and people were growing tobacco here before then.
There wrnre some growers operating at Hemingha,
where they were raising tobacco on the sandy flats!
Better tobacco than that it would not be possible to
get anywhere in the world.
1750. By Mr. Morgan. —Does not that suggest that
you are working on a wrong basis when you attempt
to grow 7 tobacco on heavier soil?—I understand that
it w 7 as not a profitable proposition to grow tobacco
undei those conditions at the price obtainable, because
the w 7 eight w 7 as not sufficient. ’
1756. You think it better to produce heavy tobacco
irrespective of quality?— Europeans w 7 ent in *for grow-
ing alongside Chinese. They grew a very light tobacco.
It w 7 as really cigar leaf. The Chinese w 7 ere growing
heavy leaf, and getting about 1 ton to the acre. They
received Bd. a lb. for their leaf, wliile the w 7 hite growers,
who grew 7 a much lighter leaf, did not receive any more.
I have here with me a sample of tobacco which was
condemned by Mr. Lough. I picked out the mouldy
stuff, and sold the rest for Bd. a lb. Mr. Lough did
not see it. It is possible sometimes to make good
tobacco out of bad. What is needed here is plenty of
competition amongst buyers. If we had a manufactur-
ing company in Tamworth w 7 e would not hear any-
tiling about condemning dark tobacco. The sample
to which I have referred w 7 as too strong at the start,
but afterwards it seems to mellow considerably. I
admit that locally-growm tobacco has, in its raw “state,
a very strong aroma, but even at that it is not much
worse than tobacco grown in other parts of the world
When I was a lad I was a sailor, and I have seen
the sailors make up tpbacco themselves which was much
stronger than anything we have here.
1757. By the Chairman.— You think that Tamworth
tobacco improves with age?—l am sure of it.


1758. How long should it be kept?—lt is like
whisky; the longer it is kept the better it is.
1759. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company
has been keeping Tamworth dark tobacco for two or
three years?—l should say that it would not harm it
to keep it longer than that.
1760. By Mr. Martens. —Do you think that keeping
the tobacco effects any other improvement than in
aroma? —I suppose the manufacturers could improve it
by putting in the right kind of dressing when they are
making it up.
1761. By Mr. Jones. —I understand that the tobacco
of which you produced a sample just uoaa t , realized Bd.
a lb. ?—Yes, it was “ rung in ”.
1762. By the Chairman. —Official figures show 7 that
60 per cent, of the tobacco produced in the world goes
into cigarettes?— That may be so. I think it was
the Mediterranean people who first brought the
cigarette smoking habit to Australia.
1763. By Mr. Parches. —Do you think it would be
an advantage to this district to have an experimental
farm established here. In the past you have had no
one to appeal to for help?—On one occasion Mr. Tre-
genna came to the district and endeavoured to cure
blue mould. He visited the district in company Avith
Dr. Darnell-Smith, and they suggested spraying the
plants with a weak solution of bluestone. I made up
a solution, and the Chinamen sprayed the tobacco. In
two or three days the tobacco was all dead. The
Chinamen turned round to me and said “ Whaffor ?
The doctor he no good. He kill him all I could
not persuade the Chinamen to use any other remedy
after that. Perhaps the tobacco would have died in
any case. The mould might have been there before
the spraying took place, and once the mould is estab-
lished there is no cure for it.
1764. Mr. Pearson has been talking about Chinese
labour. I do not think he means that he employs
Chinese labour at so much a week, or so much a day ?
I paid the Chinamen 10s. a Aveek for three years and
half the crop; the remaining years they were on the
third system.
1765. You did not deduct that 10s. a Aveek from the
share due to them at the end of the season? —No.
1766. By Mr. Tregenna. —Can you recollect any
occasion upon which you have asked for advice from
the department, and it has not been given to you?—No,
if we asked for advice we received it. It Avas, however,
very little use getting expert advice when the tobacco
was being grown by Chinamen, because the Chinese
would not follow the advice.
1767. By Mr. Parkes. —But could you have obtained
such advice at a critical stage in the process of flue-
curing if it were necessary?—We never required it,
and we never asked for it.
1768. By the Chairman. —You never had any doubt
that if you could get the Chinese to follow the advice
you would have been able to get it without difficulty
from the department?—No doubt at all.
The witness withdrew.
Alexander Goodman, tobacco-groAver, Loomberah,
Tamworth, was called, sworn and examined.
1769. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco? —I have been growing under flue-
curing conditions for six years.
1770. Were you growing before that?—l grew a
little under sun-drying conditions, but for the past
six years I have been flue-curing.
1771. What has been your average acreage?— About
14 or 15 acres.
1772. Are you growing on the river flats? —Yes, in
sandy loam.
1773. Do you irrigate your tobacco?— Yes.
1774. Did you put tlie irrigation plant in specially
for tobacco? —Yes, it cost me about £5OO. I use it
for lucerne and vegetables also.
1775. So you cannot put tbe cost of tbe plant solely
against your tobacco crop?— No.
1776. What other plant did you install?—l put. up
two barns.
1777. What would you say the total outlay required
was to flue-cure 14 or 15 acres of tobacco?— About
£lOO a ton.
1778. What is your average crop?— About a tqn
to the acre.
1779. Do you say that the capital cost to you to
enable you to flue-cure 14 or 15 acres of tobacco was
£1,400 ?—lt cost £5OO without the barns. Then there
was the cost of the barns, and a tractor for pumping
the water, &c.
1780. You are putting in the cost of the irrigation
plant?— Yes. It would cost £lOO a ton to produce
tobacco one year with another.
1781. Did you have an irrigation plant before you
went in for tobacco-growing?— No.
1782. If you had never gone in for tobaccow-growing
would you have installed an irrigation plant?-—No.
1783. The additional items would cost nearly £1,000?
—Easily; it could not be done for less. ,
1784. You say that it costs you £lOO to produce one
acre of flue-cured tobacco?—To produce one ton.
1785. Have you any figures in relation to it?— No.
but I know what it would cost.
1786. What Avould you say your net profit per ton
has been over the six years?—We have always averaged
£2OO a ton for our tobacco.
1787. So that you have been making a profit of
£lOO a ton?— Yes.
1788. What percentage of bright leaf did you get
six years ago compared with your percentage to-day ?
—We have been improving the quality wonderfully
during the last f cav years. Six years ago our crop was
3 tons 16 cwts., for which AVe averaged Is. 9d. a lb.
We are iioav averaging 2s. a lb. The yield that year
was badly affected with mould in the paddock.
1789. The company did not pay a bonus then?— No.
1790. What crop did you get last year?—lt was a
good crop only for the frost; We got about nine tons
off eight acres.
1791. How much of it Avas lost OAving to the frost?—
About £l,OOO Avorth, or approximately five tons.
1792. Was it completely destroyed?—We never
pulled a leaf.
1793. So you only got half a crop?—A little better
than that.
1794. Of the crop Avhich you saved, Avhat percentage
was dark?—ln the European-grown leaf there was no
dark tobacco at all. But the Chinamen groAving on
shares produced dark tobacco.
1795. Was your tobacco bought by the company as
bright ? —I never lost a leaf.
1796. Hoav do you account for the Chinamen having
dark leaf?— They left the suckers in.
1797. Are the European growers more careful than
the Chinese? —I Avould not say that the European can
grow tobacco better than the Chinese, but he has a
better head for curing. I got rid of my Chinamen.
1798. Would you say that the quality of Chinese
labour has deteriorated?—l would not put them on.
1799. We have been given to understand that the
Chinese cannot flue-cure, but do you say that they are
no good even as growers?—l say that. They pull the
green leaf.
1800. Do you think it would be a payable proposi-
tion for the growers in the Tamworth district to employ
white labour and pay them the ruling wages rather than
put Chinamen on on shares?— Yes, I think it would.
They would get better prices.


1801. What has been your experience with blue
mould? —It is a very serious problem. I have had
only two good crops in six years. I have had two partial
failures, and. two total failures.
1802. Would you say that if you got one good crop
in three, it would represent the average experience for
the Tamworth district?— Yes. It would take one all
one’s time to do that.
1803. Then if you made £lOO a ton profit on your
tobacco, you would, by getting only one good crop in
three, average only £33 a ton all round. Would that
pay you?— No.
1804. What would pay?—lf you could get a half
crop each year it would pay.
1805. You consider, then, that £5O an acre profit
would pay you?— Yes, but the trouble is that one cannot
look after anything else when looking after tobacco
It has to be watched day and night.
1806. So far as blue mould is concerned that is purely
the growers’ risk. The buyer is concerned only with
the quality of the tobacco. Are we to understand that
if the crop is attacked by blue mould its value is com-
pletely destroyed from a selling point of view? —Not
always. Some stalks might be all right, and others not
go good. One effect is to shorten the leaf. Then, when
you put the affected leaves in the flue, they will not
care. They will not stand the heat if there is anything
wrong with them. We throw away about two tons a
year when we have a big crop.
1807. But do you not get a proportion of leaf that
cures up to a certain standard when affected by mould ?
How do you get on with the buyer regarding that leaf ?
—I have no complaint against the buyer.
1808. Does the buyer go through the tobacco very
carefully ?—Yes.
1809, Can he tell by pulling a few handfuls out
whether or not it is mouldy ?—He can tell by the smell.
1810. Do you tell him there is blue mould in the
barns? —We never have it.
1811. You leave it to the buyer to find out ?—Yes, he
will find it.
1812. What is the depreciation on slightly mouldy
tobacco?— Once it has been in the bulk I do not think
it has any value. If there are only a few spots, and
the leaf is not damaged, the buyers will take it at a
fair price, but they will not take tobacco that is really
mouldy.
1813. When you escape the total destruction of your
crop by blue mould what percentage do you sometimes
get? —Sometimes we get as much as 50 per cent. I
have known the plants to get blue mould in the beds,
and yet when set out in the paddock produce a record
crop.
1814, Have you adopted the practice of sending to
other districts for plants ?—No. I do not think it would
be any use sending to Victoria for plants as they would
be out of the ground for too long.
1815. Would you send to Texas for them?—No, not
without seeing the plants. There is not enough in the
business to pay for plants.
1816. Where do you buy your plants ?—I do not buy
them.
1817. Would it not pay you to get outside plants at
£2 a thousand if you were by that means able to get a
very much better crop?—lt would be better than a
failure, but I would rather grow my own plants.
1818. The Wangaratta growers have practicalh
eliminated blue mould as a fatal factor by sending to
other districts, such as Bendigo, Shepparton, &c., for
their plants?—lt would certainly be better to buy your
plants from outside than to get no crop at all.
1819. In your opinion, have the experiments carried
out by the government experts and others had any
effect in diminishing the losses due to blue mould ?—No,
I think we are further away than ever.
1820. Do you think that the growers have made any
real attempt to follow up these experiments?— Yes,
sometimes we are very successful when the crops fail
all round us. Other times our experience is the reverse.
1821. Do you know of any growers who think they
can beat the mould?—No; we can beat the insect pest,
but not the mould.
1822. Are we to assume that but for blue mould in
this district, tobacco-growing would be a profitable in-
dustry at the present prices?— Yes, I would not grow
anything else.
1823. Do you consider that the growers here are im«
proving in their methods of cultivation and curing?—
Yes, some of them.
1824. Would you say that over the last ten years there
has been an all-round improvement in the method of
flue-curing in the Tamworth district?— Yes; the colour
is getting better and better.
1825. Do you apply any aroma test?—No, I think
the buyers judge solely by colour.
1826. Does the buyer ever complain about the aroma
of the tobacco?— No.
1827. You have heard of this supposed eucalyptus
taint?—-I have heard something about it.
1828. Has the buyer ever said anything about a
eucalyptus taint in the soil?— Never.
1829. Has he ever suggested it as an explanation of
the peculiar aroma of the tobacco grown in t-bis dis-
trict?—No, he has never mentioned it.
1830. Has anybody else ever mentioned it?— No.
1831. Has the buyer ever discussed the tobacco with
you on any other basis than that of colour?— No.
1832. Does the buyer ever discuss aroma with the
growers at all?— Never with me.
1833. Is there anything to lead the growers to any
conclusion regarding the standard of aroma in their
tobacco ?—No,
1834. Have you had anything put up to you by
experts or by the buyers to the effect that, apart from
the colour, there was a very serious defect in the
tobacco grown in this district; as, for instance, the
burning quality?—l have heard about it, but neither
the buyers nor the experts have mentioned it to us.
All they consider is the colour and texture.
1835. What has been your experience regarding the
proportion of bright leaf ?—Every year we are improv-
ing it.
1836. What proportion of bright leaf did you get in
1924? —About 60 per cent.
1837. What did you get last year?— Apart from that
grown by the Chinese, the percentage of bright leaf
was 75 per cent. Our dark leaf brought Is. 7d. or
Is. Bd. a lb.
1838, Do you consider that it is possible for the
growers in the Tamworth district, with their present
knowledge of growing and curing, to produce up to
80 per cent, of bright leaf every year?— Yes, if they
grow the right variety.
1839. What variety do you suggest?— Gold leaf.
1840, How did you come to grow that leaf?—We
found it out for ourselves.
1841. How did you learn the process of flue-curing;
did you have any expert advice?— No. Mr. Kefford
was with us once or twice, but we never learnt any-
thing from him.
1842. Did you not, in the initial stages, suffer losses
through experimenting?—No, we gained by it. We
were not satisfied until we got the right colour.
1843. How did you learn about grading ?—We taught
ourselves, except what Mr. Gilmour told us the first
year, Mr. Lough gives us a lesson when he can. He
tells us how to grade the leaf, and we follow his instruc-
tions. We have to depend on the buyer.
I? 44 ; ? oe ® Mr - Bough give you information
willingly?— Yes.


1845. Have you made any attempt to get informa-
tion or literature from the Agricultural Department
in Sydney?— No.
1846. Are you interested in that?—We are interested
in tobacco, and we can grow it here.
1847. Do you not think it would be interesting to
get the current literature on the subject, especially if
it is free?—-We are always prepared to listen to any
one who can tell us anything of use to us.
1848. Have you read Mr. Slagg’s recently published
pamphlet ?—-No.
1849. Have you read Dr. Darnell-Smith’s book on
his visit to America?—No, but I have heard of it.
1850. Do you take the Agricultural Gazette ?—No,
1851. So far as you are concerned you have not
taken any interest in the work the Agricultural Depart-
ment is doing for tobacco-growers?— No. We have
learned to look after ourselves.
1852. Do you not think that such an attitude is dis-
couraging to the department?— No. Mr. Tregenna
never came near us. I sent for him once and he came
to my place on a Sunday when I was away. He said
that my land was no good for growing tobacco.
1853. Did you write asking him what he did say?
—No, lam going by what I have been told. I cannot
swear he said it. He never came near me any more,
and I did not ask him again.
1854. Do you think you are following the right
course?—We have been getting a good price all the
time, and have never had a leaf left on our hands.
1855. Do you consider your experience has been
satisfactory over the six years you have been growing?
—-Yes, when the crops have been good. But there have
been too many failures.
1856. Have you had any complaints about the price
paid by the company?—No, we are averaging about 2s.
a lb.
1857. What do you think of the company’s system of
paying bonuses?—l think it would be better to have a
hard and fast price.
1858. What if they gave you only 2s. and no bonus?
—I do not think they would do that.
1859. Do you find that much of the tobacco is
bought at Is. ll|d. a lb.?—We had a lot of that last
year. We had 36 bales, for which the company paid
that price. It would have meant £2OO more to us if
we had got the other The buyer gave us no reason
for fixing the price at that figure.
1860. Do you ever argue with the buyer about the
price ?—Sometimes.
1861. How does he treat you?—He often comes up
Id. He always treats us fairly.
1862. Do you sometimes go colour blind when grad-
ing your leaf ?—Any man might make a mistake
occasionally, but not very often.
1863. Do you think that Mr. Pearson’s estimate of
3d. a lb. for grading is a fair thing?— Yes. One has
to go through the tobacco very carefully.
1864. By Mr. Martens. —Have you ever tried to find
out what is the cause of blue mould?— Yes. I con-
sider that the state of the weather has everything to
do with it. The mould makes its appearance during
hot weather or after a sudden cold snap. It has been
very bad this year, and there has been no rain at all.
1865. By Mr. Jones. —Have you discovered an effec-
tive means of dealing with insect pests as a result of
your own efforts, or on the advice of the experts?—
As a result of our own efforts.
1866. Have you any suggestions for settling dif-
ferences of opinion between yourself and the. buyer
on the question of grading?— No. We have to accept
the buyers’ ruling,
1867. By the Chairman. —Have you ever seen any
samples upon which the buyer judges*the grades?—l
have seen American samples at our association office.
1868. Have you seen any Australian samples?—
No.
1869. Did you know that samples are lodged with
the Department of Agriculture in Sydney, and that you
can see them if you wish?—No, I did not know that.
Our aim is to get as much bright leaf as possible. It
is not worth while trying to get lemon-coloured leaf.
1870. What is a fair percentage of lemon leaf in the
Tamworth district—lo per cent.?—lt depends on the
variety of tobacco.
1871. Do you think that the growers study the sub-
ject of varieties?—l do not think they study it enough.
I have studied it closely and with advantage.
1872. Have you made a study of soils ?—Yes, and I
have derived benefit from it.
1873. Do you use superphosphate?—No, we use no
fertilizers. The land is too strong already.
1874. By Mr. Morgan. —How can you say that you
have studied these matters when you did not avail
yourself of the assistance of the experts?—We tried
different varieties, and observed which cured the best.
1875. You rely upon your own experiments, and
think that scientific research is not worth while?—
We have the benefit of practical experience. Scientific
research may be very valuable, but we have never
received any benefit from it,
1876. Do you mean that the tobacco-growing industry
in Australia has received no benefit as a result of
scientific research ?—-Some people may have benefited
from it.
1877. What do you think of the proposal for the
establishment of a central grading depot ?—I do not
think that it would be much good to us. How would
we get the tobacco to the depot in a dry district like
this? We would*lose tons of it.
1878. By the Chairman. —lt could be run in quickly
on lorries?—We live about 9 miles away from Tam-
worth, and it takes only about two minutes to damage
the tobacco. I think it would be a much better idea
if we had some good men to assist us in grading on
the farms.
1879. By Mr. Jones. —We were told this morning
that Mr. Steinbeck produced a very large percentage
of bright leaf with Chinese labour ?—Chinese growers
are no use to me. The Chinaman will not wait for
the tobacco to ripen. I have never yet seen a China-
man who can pick the leaf at the right time,
1880. By the Chairman. —You consider, then, that
the Chinaman is better out of the industry?—l think
so. One cannot trust the Chinese to pick the right
leaf. They can chip and hoe all right, but they are
no good for the other work. There are not many
Chinamen employed in this district now.
1881. By Mr. Martens. —You said it would be a
good thing to have some one to teach the farmers how to
grade their tobacco. Do you think it would have
helped you at the beginning to have had such expert
assistance ? No doubt it would have been of benefit
to us. I think the whole secret of producing good
tobacco lies in selecting the right variety, and in the
proper grading of the leaf.
1882. By Mr. Parkes. —How much of your tobacco
did you sell at Is. Hid. per 1b.?—36 bales.
1883. So that it would have meant a considerably
increased return for you if you could have got the
other id. —It would.
The witness withdrew.
Horby Walter Phillips, tobacco-grower, Piallamore,
Tamworth, was called, sworn and examined.
1884. By the Chairman.'-— How long have you been
growing tobacco ?—I was growing from 1919 until
.1


1885. What was your average yield?—l have had
much the same experience as other growers. I have
had two really good seasons, hut my average was about
one in three. The bad season was due on every
occasion to blue mould.
1886. Did you have any total failures? —This year
the crop was a failure. The plants died of mould in
the beds. I have never tried to get plants from other
districts.
1887. What was the largest area you ever planted?—
Twenty-five acres. The first year we sun-dried the crop.
We had twelve acres and took off tons, which we
sold at 2s. a lb.
1888. Who bought that crop?—lt was bought by
Dudgeon and Arneil, of Melbourne.
1889. Did the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany make you an offer for it?— They offered Is. 7d.
per lb.
1890. Did Dudgeon and Arneil ever buy from you
again?—No, I did not see them again.
1891. Was that all dark tobacco?—lt was all very
bright. We were persuaded to go in for flue-curing
by Mr. Howell. We applied to him for assistance from
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, and I ob-
tained £2OO to erect barns. This sum was deducted
from the price of the crop next year. Previously, they
had tried flue-curing at Chaffey Brothers, but the bam
was not suitable and it was not a success.
1892. What was your experience after you went in
for flue-curing?—l have seen reports to the effect that
Tamworth cannot grow bright tobacco. I am con-
vinced that it can. I grew it that first year.
1893. What was the highest percentage of bright
tobacco you ever had?—We had very little dark that
year, and we received 2s. a lb. for two bales.
1894. What year did you get the best price?— The
best year was when the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company had Mr, McGee conducting experiments on
my farm. Our average price that year w'as 2s. 4|d.
The tobacco was grown alongside a Chinese crop which
realized only Is. lOd. I cured both lots of tobacco in
my barn.
1895. Did Mr. McGee take the responsibility off your
shoulders that year ?—No, I cured the tobacco. Mr.
Tregenna was there.
1896. Did he give you any assistance?—He came
there as often as he could and told me a lot about it.
Plue-curing is an art. You cannot learn it in one year
or in two. The crops vary each year, and the method
of curing has to vary as between one sort of crop and
another.
1897. Did Mr, McGee put any new ideas into your
head? —He did as regards curing. I got a good price
for what I cured myself, but not for 4 what the Chinese
grew.
1898. Do you think the Chinaman is a good grower ?
—The Chinaman is a good labourer. He is patient and
industrious, but as regards the application of any
scientific principles he is hopeless. The actual growing
of tobacco requires a man with the temperament of a
Chinaman to do it successfully. The Chinese, however,
are hopeless at curing. They usually put in an extra
large fire to hurry up the process. They also try to
grow the heaviest leaf they can. A few of them are
now becoming impressed by the fact that the company
will not buy their heavy leaf, and they are going out
of the industry. Others are growing a lighter leaf.
1899. Do you think that tobacco-growing would be
a successful industry here for white labour from start
to finish ?—Certainly, if the white men are prepared to
work.
1900. Do you know of many Australians here who
are quite successful in curing tobacco? —Yes.
1901. Do you know any who are not keen on the
work, who spoil their crop through carelessness?— Yes,
I know of a crop that was spoilt recently either through
carelessness or ignorance; it was probably more ignor
ance than anything else.
1903. Do you think the quality of Tam worth
tobacco has improved since flue-curing was introduced ?
—Yes.
1903. Are you any judge of aroma in tobacco ?—No.
The buyer wants colour and texture. I think that the
manufacturing process, of which we are entirely
ignorant, has a good deal to do with the quality.
1904. Have you any opinion on the subject of ageing
tobacco?—-I do not think that Australian tobacco im-
proves much after two years.
1905. Would you say from your own knowledge that
the tendency in this district is rapidly to increase the
proportion of bright leaf?—l think most of those on
unsuitable soil realize that. People are growing tobacco
on more suitable soils, and are selecting more suitable
varieties.
1906. Mr. Hyson told us that 30 per cent, of dark
leaf for this district would be a fair thing. Do you
agree with him?— Yes. If those on the heavier soils
grow a lighter variety of tobacco and look after it
properly they should be able to get a good percentage
of bright tobacco. We could do with an experimental
farm here to teach us something about the proper
varieties.
1907. Would you say there has been a substantial
improvement in the methods of cultivation and grading
since you have been here?— Yes, I think so.
1908. Do you regard blue mould as the chief obstacle
in the way of successful tobacco-growing?—-It has
accounted for what failures I have had. Except for
that I should have been independent now.
1909. What would you regard as a fair price for a
crop which yielded 75 per cent, of bright leaf?— One
cannot allow failures to influence the price paid, and
1 think the prices the company are paying this year
are satisfactory. They are paying 3s. a lb. for bright
and lemon. If we averaged 2s. or 2s. 6d, a lb. for
a crop it would pay us very handsomely. That, of
course, is including the dark tobacco.
1910. Would you say that an average price of 2s.
would pay: —If we could get a good crop every year
it would pay.
1911. If you got one good crop in three, and made
£lOO a ton profit, you would average £33 over the three
years. Would that pay ? —lt would pay if one put in
a sufficiently large area.
1912. If you got 10 tons one year in three, it would
average about £3OO a year. Would that be enough?—
It is not very much. It is really only wages, and one
has to work a great deal more than eight hours a day.
In the curing season we are going all day and all night.
1913. Would you be satisfied with a return of £lO a
week ?—Yes.
1914. Do you know of any men in the district who
are averaging £lO a week?— Not many.
1915. Have you any suggestions to make regarding
the industry here?—l agree that it would be a good
thing to buy plants in other districts and bring them
here. If we could get the growers to organize and make
a specialty of it we might achieve something. Mr.
Howell tried to bring that about, but the growers could
not agree.
1916. Do you favour the establishment of a central
grading depot ?—lt would be difficult to get the tobacco
to the depot owing to the dryness of the atmosphere
It might, however, be possible to transport it at night.
1917. Do you think that the growers need more in-
struction in the process of grading?—l do not think
they have been neglected. Either Mr. Tregenna, or Mr.
Kefford have always been available.
1918. Have you ever approached Mr. Tregenna for
advice? —Yes, and I have always obtained it. Mr. Tre-
genna has got me out of trouble on many occasions.


1919. Have you studied the scientific side of tobacco-
growing?—l have read all I could about it, but that
is not the same thing as growing it, nor does it help
one to combat blue mould.
1929. How did you get your knowledge of what
varieties to grow?— From what X have learned. I have
tried several varieties.
1921. Do you not think that many growers are
working a good deal in the dark?—l am sure they are.
1922. And do you think they are taking sufficient
trouble to acquire knowledge?—lt is sometimes hard
to get them to follow advice.
1923. Do you subscribe to Mr. Goodman’s theory that
one gets much more beneficial results from practical
experience on the farm than from the study of scien-
tific literature?— When the tobacco company sent Mr.
McGee to carry out experiments in this district, he tried
several kinds of fertilizers; one variety produced a much
brighter leaf, which had a better aroma. Whether oi
not it, was what the company wanted I cannot say. J
do not understand anything about the alleged eucalyptus
taint at all. I suggested once to an American expert
who was on my farm that perhaps the distinctive flavour
of Australian tobacco was due to the humus in the soil,
and that the humus was the product of eucalyptus trees,
I do not know whether the theory of the eucalyptus
taint eventually evolved from that.
1924. Dr. Darnell-Smith told us that there was no
indication from what source the individual aroma
arose ?—The whole thing seems to be in the experimental
stage.
1925. By Mr. Jones.— Have you given any considera-
tion to the question of the abolition or substantial reduc-
tion of excise duty on Australian-grown leaf as a means
of stimulating the industry in Australia?—l have not.
We had a tariff board inquiry here, and I supported
the association when it asked for a reduction of excise.
1926. Has the association gone into that aspect of
the matter?—We asked for a reduction at that time.
When I supported the motion for the reduction of
excise I spoke as the secretary of the association. 1
have not been in the association for the last two years,
because I am no longer a grower. I am not now
attempting to speak on behalf of the association.
1927. By the Chairman.—Have you done anything
else besides growing tobacco in this district?— Not until
recently. My farm is rather small for anything else.
Recently, I took up poultry farming as a side line, and
I now hope to make poultry farming my principal
activity, and to grow a little tobacco as a side line.
1928. Am I to understand that for some time tobacco-
growing enabled you to keep yourself?— No. I have
had to contract a great many obligations, and tobacco-
growing has not helped me to discharge -them : I put
that down to bad crops.
1929. There are possibilities of getting rich quickly at
tobacco ?—Possibly, if we could eliminate blue mould.
1930. We have been told that even though a grower
got a crop every year an average price of 2s. a lb. would
not pay him?— The overhead expenses are, of course,
high.
1931. Would you be prepared to go back into the
industry under the old conditions?—l would not take
it on again except as a side line, I want another string
to my bow.
1932, What is a fair area for one man to work?—
About 5 acres.

{Taken at Tamworth.)
THURSDAY, 13th FEBRUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones | Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens | Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited;
Mr. W. C. Parkes, representing the Northern
Tobacco-growers Association; Mr. C. J. Tregenna,
Tobacco Expert, Department of Agriculture, Ncav
South Wales.
Clarence Mervyn Challey, tobacco-grower, Tamworth,
was called, sworn and examined.
1933. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?—l have been associated with the
industry for approximately ten years.
1934. Have you been growing by yourself ?—During
the last four or five years I have been growing with
ray brother under the name of C. M. and W. E.
('haftey.
1935. How long have you been flue-curing?— For
nine years. For one season only we sun-dried our crop.
1936. How much did you have under crop that
season?— Twelve acres. The yield, I understand, was
about 12 tons.
1937. Was it all dark tobacco ? —No, it was good sun-
dried leaf. I cannot remember what price it brought;
but it was under 2s.
1938, What was the average price of sun-dried
tobacco before the introduction of flue-curing?—l
cannot say; it is going back just a little further than
my time..
1939. Would Is. or Is. 6d. be well within the mark?
—I think it would for that time.
1940, Do you cure tobacco for yourself and your
brother ?—Yes.
1941. How did your acquire your knowledge?—
Hard work and careful watching of the process.
1942. Did you not get any instruction from the
State tobacco expert?— Not personally.
1943. Did you get any from him indirectly?— Po-
ssibly from my father, who was curing before me. He
imparted a certain amount of instruction to me. I
really picked it up myself by doing the job, and as
a result of discussions with other growers.
1944. Were you pretty raw when you started?— Yes.
X spoilt some tobacco at first.
1945. Did you study any books or pamphlets by the
department on the subject?— No.
1946. Have you studied the scientific side of tobacco
growing?— No.
1947. Have you ever written to the department for
information ?—No.
1948. Has Mr. Tregenna ever visited your farm and
offered you advice?— Yes, and when I asked for
criticism of tobacco, I was told in all cases that I
was doing all right; that I was working on the right
lines.
1949. Have the experts ever inspected your finished
work and said whether or not it was good?— Remarks
have been passed; but I cannot remember what they
were.
1950. Did Mr. McGee, the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company expert, visit you?—He visited me
once. I was not curing then, and Ido not think he saw
any of our work. At that time he was interested in
fertilizer experiments.
1951. Where did you get your knowledge of the
cultivation of tobacco ?—I gathered it in the first place
from the Chinese.
1952. Did you improve on their methods at all?
I think so. There are many different ways of planting.


1953. Did you see any daws in the Chinamen’s
methods of growing tobacco? —Not in regard to plant-
ing, irrigating and working the land.
1954. What do you consider the chief fault is with
the Chinese?— They never put their plants in close
enough. They were planting at the rate of 4,500
plants to the acre, with the plants 2 ft, 6 in. to 3 feet
apart, and 4 feet between the rows. That produced a
very heavy tobacco. We persuaded them to plant
closer, with about 2 feet between the plants. The
result was a smaller plant, but a better colour.
1955. Do you think that the Chinaman, as a grower,
is a very much over-rated man?—l have always held
that the Chinaman could grow tobacco up to a certain
stage; after that it needed some one else to take charge
of it.
1956. Do you think the industry needs the Chinese ?
—No. The white man can do better in all stages.
1957. Do you consider that the white, unskilled
labourer going into tobacco is more intelligent and
just as keen as the Chinaman ?—Keener, in most
instances.
1958. You do not find any of the so-called lacka-
daisical spirit of the Australian among the white
workers in the industry?— No.
1959. As a matter of fact, do you not find that
especially the younger men who go in for tobacco-
growing are intensely keen; that it seems to fascinate
them?—lt is a fascinating work once one gets into
it.
1960. What prices have you been getting for your
flue-cured tobacco?—ln 1926 we had 39,951 lb. of leaf
grown by Chinese, and received about Is. 9fd. per lb.
for it.
1961. Was much of that dark leaf?— Thirty-one bales
were dark, and 85 were bright.
1962. We have heard that the Tamworth- district
produces mostly dark tobacco? —It is not so in our
case. We have always had more than 50 per cent,
of bright leaf.
1963. What price did you get for your different
grades that year?— The top grade, mahogany (No. 1),
brought Is. lid. per lb., plus 3d. bonus; 21 bales of
mahogany were sold at Is. Bd., plus 3d. bonus; 31
bales of dark brought Is. 6d. and 9d.; 17 bales bringing
Is. 6d., and 14 bales 9d. Those 14 bales were slightly
frost-bitten. In 1927 we produced 2,854 lb. of leaf
grown by the Chinese. The average was about Is. 7fd.
per lb. We produced 1,899 lb. of leaf with white
labour, and averaged Is. for it. That was all flue-
cured.
1964. How much dark leaf did you have in those
two lots ?—ln the Chinese tobacco two bales were dark,
and there were five bales of dark in our own.
1965. What were your results for 1928?—1n that
year we had 19,208 lb. of Chinese-grown leaf, for
which we averaged Is. 7|d. per lb. Out of 88 bales we
had 26 bales of dark leaf.
1966. You had more dark leaf that year than before?
—Yes. The reason is that, with the Chinese growers,
you cannot get the leaf taken out in the same way as
you can with white growers. In 1929 we had 18,664
lb. of tobacco which was grown by myself under my
own supervision. That leaf averaged 2s. 6|d. per lb.
There was only one bale of dark out of 77. Those
77 bales included one sample package, so that there
were really 75 bales of bright out of 76.
1967. How do you account for such satisfactory
results?—lmproved cultivation, largely. The crop was
thicker grown, the season was better, and we had more
knowledge of curing.
1968. What sort of soil do you grow on?—lt is
inclined to be on the dark side.
1969. Were you paid a bonus on your tobacco?— The
top grade brought 2s. 3d., plus 6d. bonus. The addi-
tional bonus of 6d. paid on 10,398 lb, brought the
average price of the wdiole crop up to 2s. 6fd. per lb.
1970. Do you consider that a satisfactory price?—
Yes; if we could get that every year we would be well
satisfied.
1971. Is it possible, in the Tamworth district, by
proper methods of cultivation and curing, to average
£2OO an acre in a good season ?—Speaking of our own
property, I think it is possible to average round about
that figure.
1972. Would that yield you £lOO an acre profit?—l
think it would.
1973. Subject to favorable conditions, then, the posi-
tion is this: It costs about £lOO to produce one ton
to the acre, and your gross return is £2OO a ton, so
that you are making a net profit of £lOO an acre? ; —
We go in for mixed farming, and it is difficult to say
what the actual cost of producing the tobacco is. On
last season’s prices, however, it would be easy to make
£lOO an acre profit.
1974. Do you know much about how the other
growers are fareing?—l have seen some of their work
when they have finished curing.
1975. Do you think any of the growers have shown
marked improvement in their product since the intro-
duction of flue-curing ?—I should say so.
1976. Do you think it is quite erroneous to say
that the Tamworth district produces only dark, heavy
leaf?—lt does not produce only dark leaf.
1977. We have heard that the Tamworth district,
mainly owing to unsuitable soil, produces only dark,
heavy leaf with a bad burning aroma?—l would not
like to say that the results which we obtained last
season are a fair sample of what the district can do.
We may have been fortunate in weather and seasonal
conditions. This year the conditions are altogether
different from last year, and w r e anticipate much harder
work to get the same results.
1978. But you do not think that you will get nearly
all dark and very little bright leaf?— No.
1979. We want to know what there is to substan-
tiate the claim that Tamworth cannot produce a good
commercial tobacco. It has been said that eventually
the buyers will not buy any Tamworth tobacco at all.
We want your candid opinion of the Tamworth dis-
trict; whether you think the quality of the tobacco
is likely to improve as the growers gain in experience?
-—I think it will improve. The improvement is quite
noticeable from year to year.
1980. Does the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany’s buyer, Mr. Lough, criticize your leaf when he
comes round? Does he buy it with a bad grace as
though he were doing you a favour?—l have never had
that experience.
1981. Does he ever discuss the aroma with you?—
No. He buys'on texture and colour.
1982. What are the standards of texture?— Some leaf
is more leathery than others. We have found that
a thinner leaf produces a better colour. The best sort
of leaf is produced by planting about 6,500 plants to
the acre.
1983. Is that irrespective of .type?—ln the past we
have grown practically a heavy type of tobacco. This
year \ve have tried lighter varieties, but we are also
growing the old Dungowan. Yellow Pryor is the
variety we are now using.
1984. What steps do you take to get better types?
—I learned from the buyer that we would have to grow
a finer tobacco. We grew a little of the White Stem,
and found it was of a better quality. When we could
sell the heavier tobacco we did so, but now we are
trying to supply the buyer’s requirements, and we have
found him willing to assist in this respect.


1985. Do you have much argument with the buyer
over prices?— Sometimes we think that he might have
given us a penny more, and have told him so, but
that is only natural.
1986. Do you think that the bonus paid by the
company is an incentive to the growers to produce a
better leaf ?—Personally I prefer a straight-out price
for the tobacco.
1987. Do you know that the company is now offering
a bonus of Is. per lb. on all leaf assessed by the buyer
to be worth 2s. or over? Do you regard that as an
inducement to the growers?— Certainly it is.
1988. Have you had the experience of having your
tobacco valued at Is. ll|d. per lb. ?—Sometimes, but
mostly the price for mahogany is Is. lOd. or Is. lid.
T989. Do you do your own grading?—l had an
experienced man from Texas to do the grading last
year, and we found that it paid us. While we had the
Chinese on we could not guarantee the grading. This
man did practically the whole of the grading from start
to finish.
1990. You would not put a Chinaman on to grade
your tobacco? —Hot again.
1991. Did it cost you 3d. a lb. to get your tobacco
graded ?—I have not worked out the cost.
1992. Did you find that the better grading pleased
the buyer, and was reflected in the price you obtained ?
—Yes, it paid us.
1993. Have you studied grading at all yourself? —
Hot to any great extent.
1993 a. Have you studied grading at all yourself? —
Hot to any great extent.
1994. Do you think it a complicated process ?—Yes.
There is such a thing as colour blindness. When a
man is affected in that way he would not put dark
leaf in with bright, but he might mix up the different
grades of light leaf.
1995. Are you in favour of the establishment of a
grading depot at Tamworth? —Without considering the
matter closely, I should say, no.
1996. According to your idea every grower would
have to employ his own grader?—l should say that
the grower should eventually be able to gain sufficient
knowledge to grade his own tobacco.
1997. What do you think is a fair average area
for one man to work?—l should say that one man
could work 6 acres up to the suckering stage. He
would have to employ some labour for planting and
curing.
1998. A farmer who had two or three sons to help
him could manage 5 or 6 acres?—He should be able to.
1999. What is the biggest area you have ever had
under tobacco? —We had 40 acres once some years ago.
2000. Is it your opinion that a large area is com-
mercially unprofitable as compared with a smaller
area? —Yes, it takes too much to handle a large area.
One is inclined to work too fast, and the average
return is less.
2001. What do you consider a reasonable area?—l2
or 15 acres.
2002. And not more than 20 acres? —Ho.
2003, Would you say that a man who -would put 80
acres under tobacco, because he had a large family to
help him, would be doing a wise thing?—l think he
would do better to concentrate on a smaller area. That
has been our experience.
2004. Have you had much trouble with blue mould?
—Yes.
2005. Have you discovered any means of combating
it?—Ho, except to keep the water off the crop.
2006. Have you had a crop every year?— Ho. In
1925, we had a total failure owing to blue mould.
2007. Does it appear to you that the effects of blue
mould might be minimized by getting your plants from
mould-free districts? —The system never appealed to
me.
2008. Do you think the system is worth investigating?
—lt may be.
2009. By Mr. Martens. —What do you think is
responsible for blue mould ?—Seasonal conditions
chiefly. My own opinion is that the plant has developed
mould before ever we can detect it.
2010. By Mr. Jones. —To what do you ascribe the
largely increased percentage of bright leaf in your
crop in 1929 as compared with 1928 ? —I think it was
due to the way in which we grew the tobacco. Ho doubt
it was partly due also to seasonal and atmospheric con-
ditions, and perhaps to greater skill in curing.
2011. Was it the same class of plants in both cases ?
—Yes, the same plants and the same ground. The first
crop was grown by Chinese, and the second by our-
selves.
2012. is there any chance of you continuing to obtain
such good results?—l cannot guarantee that we will
always do as well as that, but we may get near it. v
2013. Do you think that it would be better if the
Government paid the growers a bonus on their bright
leaf instead of this bonus being paid by the company ?
—lt does not seem feasible that a business firm would
pay us the full value of our tobacco, and then pay us
a bonus on top of that. We have never looked on the
bonus as something extra, but as part of the price due
to us for our tobacco.
2014. But if the company merely bought your
tobacco without paying you any bonus, would you
favour the paying of a bonus by the Government for
high-grade leaf? —I would not like to express an opinion
on that point.
2015. What do you think of the proposal to abolish
excise duty on Australian leaf? —I think it would help
the industry.
2016. Do you think that a practical tobacco-grower
could assist the investigation committee which is now
studying the tobacco industry? —From wdiat I have
read I do not know that any good could be done. I
have not gone into the matter, however.
2017. By Mr. Martens— It has been stated in
evidence that, following on the higher prices paid by
the company, they have raised the standard of tobacco
from the buyer’s point of view. Have you noticed
that?—Ho, 1 cannot say that I have.
2018. Are they asking for a better quality of leaf ?
There are times when it seems to me that they are.
2019. By Mr. Tally. —ln 1929, you employed a
special grader to grade your crop. Did you pay him
so much a week?— Yes, I paid him about £4 a week.
2020. How long did he take to grade your crop ?-
About three months. He was not on the work alone;
sometimes there would be as many as half a dozen men
on. To do the job alone a man would take over six
months.
2021. Would he be able to do it by himself in twenty
weeks ?—He might, but I doubt it.
2022. By Mr. Morgan. —Is it not a fact that your
crop and Mr. Steinbeck’s were so superior as regards
the proportion of bright leaf that they could not be
regarded as typical of the tobacco grown generally in
the Tamworth district?—Ho, they seemed to be out-
standing.
2023. We could not take your standard as anything
like representative of the district as a whole?— Perhaps
not.
2024. By the Chairman. —Have you any idea of
what the other men are doing in this district?-—I only
know from hearsay.


2025. By Mr. Martens. —Do you think that hy care-
ful cultivation it would be possible to obtain 80 per
cent, of bright leaf? —With some classes of soil it might
be possible to do that.
2026. By Mr. Bentley. —In the figures you quoted for
your 1929 crop you classified mahogany as bright
tobacco ?—Yes.
2027. We do not classify it as bright; we classify
mahogany as dark?—l was not aware of that.
2028. In 1929 you said that you had one bale of
dark tobacco. According to our records you had 35
bales of dark which included 29 bales of mahogany
(Ho. 1). That was why we paid you only 3d. bonus
on it. As regards the suggestion that our buyer has
raised the standard, your figures for 1928 show that
you averaged Is. a lb..—Yes, that is so.
2029. And for 1929 you averaged 2s. 6fd, with the
bonus ?—Yes.
2030. The added bonus made a difference of about 3d
per lb. all round?— Yes.
2031. Leaving out the increased bonus you got from
your 1929 crop 2s. 3d. a lb. against Is. 7d. a lb. the
previous year. Does not that indicate that if you
have the goods our buyer will pay the price? You
admit it is a substantial increase ?—Yes, certainly.
2032. In 1928, you had only one bale which was
classified as bright mahogany, but in 1929 our buyer
classified 41 bales as bright mahogany. Does that not
show that when the quality is there he will classify it
as bright, and give you the price for it?—-Apparently,
it does show that.
2033. Were you dissatisfied with the 1929 classifica-
tion?—Ho, I never argued about it.
2034. Regarding the suggestion that too much
tobacco is valued at Is. lOd. and Is. lid. a lb., thus
cutting the growers out of their bonus. In 1928, you
had 34 bales of high-class mahogany, and were paid
Is. 9d. to Is. 10ijd. for it. In 1929, you had only 30
bales of that grade, which seems to indicate that if
the quality is there our buyer will pay the price?—lt
appeared to us that if the quality was there, and the
grading was right, it played an important part in the
price paid by the buyer.
2035. By Mr. Jones. —The company’s classification
oYyour 1928 crop was 87 bales of dark tobacco out of
88 bales. The figures you gave were 26 bales of dark
and 62 bales of bright?—-I have never considered
mahogany as dark toFacco.
2036-37. Have you ever been advised by the company
to that effect.—Ho. I understand that no mahogany
tobacco would bring 2s. a lb.
2038. Mr. Bentley. —ln between the dark grade,
which brings Is. 6d. a lb., and the bright mahogany,
which brings 2s. a lb., there is another grade which is
called mahogany. Mahogany tobacco will never get
Is. a lb. bonus, but bright mahogany will get it.
2039. By Mr. Jones. —ls there any difference of
opinion among growers as to whether a leaf is mahogany
or bright mahogany?—l cannot say.
2040. I have sometimes seen growers themselves who
have not agreed on this point?— Yes, we have had that
experience also.
2041. Is it not natural, then, that there should be
differences of opinion between the growers and the
buyers ? —Possibly.
2042. Can you suggest any means of overcoming that
difficulty ?—Ho.
2043. By Mr. Barkes. —How far is your place from
Mr. Steinbeck’s?—About 7 or 8 miles.
The witness withdrew.
Ernest Edwin Heville, tobacco-grower, Attunga,
Tamworth, was called, sworn and examined.
2044. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?—l have been growing since 1923.
AH my experience has been under flue-curing con-
ditions, with the exception of the first year. The first
year we had 15 acres under tobacco, and averaged
Is. B|d. a lb. for about an 8 ton crop. The majority
of it was a good colour. I should say it was bright
mahogany.
2045. What area have you averaged since then?—
About 10 to 15 acres. I work it with Chinese on the
share system.
2046. When you turned over from sun-drying to flue-
curing, what plant did you put in?—l put in two
barns, a 6-inch pump and a Fordson tractor;
altogether it cost me about £750.
2047. What results have you been getting under
flue-curing conditions? Have you had a good crop
every year?—Ho, not every year.
2048. How many good years have you had ?—About
two.
2049. When were your good years ?—The 1926 crop
yielded 21,000 lb.; in 1927 the crop was 7,000 lb.;
in 1928 it was 19,000; and in 1929 it was 9,000 lb,
2050. Out of the crop which produced 21,000 lb.
of tobacco, how much bright leaf did you have?—
According to the company’s classification there was no
bright leaf in that year. There were 30 bales of
mahogany (Ho. 1) and 43 bales of mahogany (Ho. 2).
There were seventeen bales of dark, and nine bales of
inferior dark, together with ten bales of Ho. 2 dark.
The average price was Is. 6|d. per lb. In 1928 there
were 30 bales of mahogany (Ho. 1), 45 bales of dark
and three bales of dark Ho. 2. The average price was
Is. 6fd. per lb. In 1929 there were six bales of bright
mahogany, 31 bales of mahogany (Ho, 1), six bales of
dark, rather inferior, and eight bales of dark Ho. 2.
The average price was Is. lOd. per lb. For the six
bales of bright mahogany the price was 2s. lid., plus
Is. bonus.
2051. Do you do your own curing?— Yes,
2052. What class of soil do you grow on?— Sandy
loam.
2053. Have you made a study of tobacco cultivation?
—I have, but not to any very great extent.
2054. Have you availed yourself of the assistance
of any of the State experts?—l had Mr. Tregenna
once or twice at my place, and afterwards Mr. Kefford
visited my farm.
2055. Do you say that they helped you very much?
—They gave their opinion, and I think they did what
they could.
2056. Did you discuss with them the large propor-
tion of dark tobacco you had grown?— Ho.
2057. Did the company point out to you that you
were not improving the quality of your tobacco?—
The company said that I was improving, particularly
on the last crop.
2058. You got six bales of bright tobacco out of 61
bales ?—Yes.
2059. That was the first year you had any bright
tobacco at all. How do you account for that?—lt was
largely a matter of the quality of the Chinese labour.
In the earlier crops the tobacco was all right, but the
grading was bad.
2060. Do you leave the grading to the Chinese?—
Yes, under my supervision.
2061. When you got the six bales of bright tobacco,
did you leave the grading to the Chinese ?—Yes.
2062. Is it not a fact that you have been losing
money by sticking to the Chinese?—ln regard to the
grading, yes.
2063. Would it not pay you to employ a white
grader?—ln my case the bad stuff went in with the
good and lowered the price.
2064. Have you studied grading yourself ?—Ho.
2065. Do you think you could do better than the
Chinese?—l think so.


2066. What other lines do you go in for besides
tobacco?— Dairying and lucerne-growing. Tobacco is
only a side line.
2067. Do you not think that one of your troubles is
that you have not been giving sufficient personal super-
vision to the tobacco-growing side of your activities ?
—That may be so.
2068. Do you not think that by continuing to pro-
duce low-grade tobacco you are giving the district a
bad reputation?— That may be so, but I contend that
the Tamworth district can produce good tobacco.
2069. You have been in the game since 1923, but
it is only now that you have begun to get the right
colour?—lt would appear so,
2070. Other men are doing better?— The majority
seem to be doing better.
2071. Is it sound economically to employ Chinese
on shares?—-I think so, because it is such an uncertain
crop that it would not pay to employ labour
straight out.
2072. You have been losing money for some years
past by growing a poor quality of tobacco, mainly due
to the use of Chinese labour. Would it not be worth
while to take the risk of employing white labour at
bigger wages?—l think it would be a better pro-
position.
2073. Have you smoked Australian tobacco? —Yes,
I have smoked “ Waratah,” and thought it rather good.
2074. Have you experienced any difficulty in buying
“ Waratah ” tobacco?—Ho, but I understand that there
is not much demand for it.
2075. Do you know 7 of any others who buy it?—Ho
one wdiom I know r of. I have told others about it, but
they have complained that it dries up too quickly in
the paper cartons.
2076. Have you tried any other Australian tobacco?
—Ho.
2077. You are satisfied wdth “Waratah”?—Yes.
2078. Can you detect any objectionable aroma about
it?— Ho.
2079. By Mr. Tally. —ln 1926 you grew 21,000 lb.
of tobacco, and averaged Is. 6|d. for it. You attribute
your low price largely to bad grading. A loss of Id,
a lb. on that crop would amount to £B7 10s. Would it
not have been a good thing, irrespective of the fact that
the Chinese had grown the tobacco, to have it graded
by an expert?—lt might he.
2080. It would not have cost as much as £B7 10s. to
have employed a wdiite grader, and you might have got
as much as 2d. or 3d. a lb. more?— That is so.
2081. By Mr. Parkes. —Do you know of a competent
white grader in this district whom you could employ?
—I do not know 7 of any.
2082. You w 7 ere working on shares with Chinese,
and they have to do their portion of the grading?—
Yes.
2083. By the Chairman. —Has the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company’s buyer complained about
having to buy so much dark leaf from you?—Ho, 1
have had no complaints about dark leaf, but I have
been told once or twice that it was a little too heavy in
condition.
2084. Were you told that by the company or by Mr.
Lough ?—I was told it in a letter from the company.
2085. What action did you take?—-The company went
through the consignment, and deducted the amount of
leaf that was unsuitable. On one occasion Mr. Read-
ing, the Managing Director of the company, advised
me to send the tobacco away to be dealt with in Sydney,
That was done.
2086. By Mr. Bentley. —ln 1926 you had 2,100 lb.
of tobacco rejected, and, in 1928, 1,500 lb, were
rejected?— That was so.
2087. By the Chairman. —Was it quite unfit for
use?— The tobacco was all of good quality, but it was
mixed up by the Chinese at pressing time.
2088. Did the Chinese put mouldy tobacco in with
the good stuff?— Yes.
2089. You lost £l6O over that in 1926. Did you
exercise any personal supervision over the Chinamen
when grading?— Yes, but I had other things to do,
and I could not be there all the time.
2090. You really had to put up with what the
Chinamen did ?—Partly.
2091. By Mr. Martens. —Have you ever heard of the
Chinese using water on the tobacco to increase the
weight?— Yes, I have.
2092. By the Chairman. —lt is apparent that the
Chinese have been a very bad proposition for you?—
That is so.
2093. Are you interested in the tariff as it affects the
tobacco industry?— Yes.
2094. Do you favour the abolition or reduction of
excise on tobacco?— Yes.
2095. Do you think that the company should pay a
bigger price than Is. 6|d. for the dark tobacco you
have been producing?—-Yes, I do,
2096. Do you think it is worth more than you are
getting?—l do.
2097. On what grounds do you justify that?—We do
not get a crop every year, and there is a fair amount
of capital involved. It does not pay us to grow tobacco
at the prices w r e are receiving at the present time.
2098. You think that Is. 6fd. for mahogany Ho. 1
and Ho. 2, and for Ho. 2 dark is not enough?—lt
would not pay me.
2099. What price would pay you?—l could not pro-
duce it at a profit for less than 2s. a lb.
2100. But if the company does not want that dark
tobacco, you cannot expect them to pay 2s. a lb. for
it? I would expect to average 2s. a lb. for my crop.
2101. Do you know that some of the other growers
have been getting 60 per cent, to 70 per cent, of bright
mahogany, for which they have been paid 2s. 3d. a lb. ?
—Yes, I know it.
2102. You are expecting to average nearly as much
for your dark tobacco as they have been getting for
their bright?— Yes.
2103. Do you not think that if you got 2s. a lb. for
your dark they ought to get a great deal more for their
bright tobacco?— Yes. I think they should.
2104. It is a matter for you to consider whether
you should not produce more bright tobacco, otherwise
you will lose money?— Yes.
2105. It is no use your going on producing your
present quality of tobacco?—Ho, it does not pay me.
2106. By Mr. Jones. —You say that last season was
the first occasion upon which you w 7 ere paid for any
bright tobacco?— Yes.
2107. And that in previous years you produced a
good leaf; but that it was graded badly?— Yes.
2108. You understand that bright leaf carries with it
a bonus of Is. a lb.?—Yes.
2109. So that proper grading is of supreme import-
ance ?—Yes.
2110. In view' of that, what is your opinion of the
proposal to establish a grading depot at Tamworth?—
I am in favour of it.
2111. Would not such a depot have saved you a
lot of money?—lt w 7 ould have saved me hundreds of
pounds.
The witness withdrew.
Charles William Quick, tobacco-grower, Attunga,
Tamworth, was called, sworn and examined.
2112. By the Chairman.—Row long have you been
growing tobacco?— About eighteen years.


2113. Have you been growing it by yourself all that
time? —Sometimes by myself, and at other times with
my brother, and with Chinese. I am now growing
some with Chinese and some on my own.
2114. How long have you been flue-curing? —Since
1924. Some of the crops since then have been all
right, and some have not been much good.
2115. How many good crops have you had? —One
could not call any of them really good; the main
trouble has been blue mould.
211 G. Have you been doing the curing yourself ?
Yes, together with my brother.
2117. Where did you learn how to do it?—l learnt
it out on the farm.
2118. Did any one teach you?— Two or three
different people told me how to go about it.
2119. Do you not think you are improving in the
art?—l think so.
2120. How much tobacco did you produce in 1926?
—ln that year I produced 135 bales. There was no
bright tobacco, but there were fourteen bales of
mahogany [Ho. 1), six bales of mahogany (Ho. 2),
115 bales of dark of various grades, including 42 of
good dark. The average price Avas Is. 4d. per lb.
2121. Were you growing with Chinese then? —About
half A\ T ith Chinese, and half on my own.
2122. Was your half better than that grown by the
Chinese ?—lt Avas about on a par, I think.
2123. Did Is. 4d. a lb. pay you?—l do not think so.
2124. Did you install barns ?—We put up two barns.
2125. Did you put in an irrigation plant?— The
plant Avas there before.
2126, What were your results for 1927? —We had
24 bales of dark tobacco, Avhich averaged Is. 7d. per
lb.; in 1928 we had 124 bales, which included seventeen
bales of inferior bright, one bale of bright mahogany,
and the average price was Is. 7.67 d. In 1929
we had 87 bales, which included no bright tobacco, and
the average price was Is. 6.36 d.
2127. Your highest price was in 1928. Did that pay
you?— Taking everything into consideration I do not
think so.
2128, What do you think would pay? —An average
price of 2s. per lb. might pay.
2129. Even for your dark tobacco?— Yes.
2130. You have made practically no progress in the
production of bright leaf since 1926. How do you
account for that? —It depends a lot on the seasons.
2131. But you had tAvo good seasons, one in 1926 and
the other in 1928. In 1926 you got no bright tobacco
at all, and in 1928 you got only one bale. Do you put
your bad results down to Chinese labour? —Partly;
but I do not say they are entirely responsible.
2132. Have you studied types of plants, methods of
cultivation, &c. ?—I have done a little in that way.
but not much.
2133. How many plants do you put in to the acre?
—We have tried different ways; but we are uoav plant
ing 5,000 or 6,000 to the acre.
2134. What sort of soil are you groAving on ?—Sandy
loam on top, with a clay bottom.
2135. Have you decided what type of plant giA 7 es
the best results? —“Dungowan ” is giving the best.
2136. But it is admittedly producing a dark leaf.
Do you not think it would be better to try something
else?— The trouble is that other A r arieties cannot be
groAvn because of various diseases.
2137. Is tike “ Dungowan ” variety less liable to
blue mould than others?—-Yes; but even Avith that we
get some blue mould every season.
2138. Do you do your own curing?— Yes. The
Chinese do their portion of the grading. Whatever
the Chinese grow they grade themselves. I cure it,
Most of my stuff is grown by the Chinese,
2139. Do you consider that that largely accounts for
your big proportion of dark leaf ?—The Chinamen like
to get quantity rather than quality, and it is hard
to teach them anything different. It is difficult to gel
them to understand that it pays better to produce a
smaller quantity of light leaf, rather than a large
quantity of dark leaf. The trouble is, of course, to get
a variety that will stand up to the blue mould.
2140. Other growers do it. Do you think that your
difficulty is one of the peculiarities of the Attunga
district?—Ho, I do not think so. I think we could
improve the colour if we knew more about curing.
2141. Are you studying methods of curing?—l have
done the best I could.
2142. Have you had any help from the experts?—
Mr. Kefford gave us some advice occasionally.
3143. Did you Avrite to the department for any
help ?—Ho.
2144. Or for any literature?— Ho.
2145. Have you asked the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company’s buyer for advice concerning the
class of tobacco you are producing, and how to improve
it?—l did ask him once, and I think he said that
we Avould have to grow a different kind of tobacco;
that it would be better to get off the heavy stuff that
the Chinamen usually grew.
2146. Do you keep any books or figures to show
what it costs you to grow tobacco?—l Avon Id have to
go into the matter to find out.
2147. How can you tell if it is not paying you?—
Generally if a business is not paying you can tell by
your bank account.
2148. You have not been making as much money as
you think you ought, but still you stay in the industry?
—We have all the plant and equipment, and so we go
on growing.
2149. Is the position that tobacco-growing is not
paying you in the sense that you are not making much
money out of it; but you are not losing?— Well, it
may be that.
The witness withdrew.
William Considine Parkes, tobacco-grower, Attunga,
and President of the Horthern Tobacco-groAvers
Association, was called, sAvorn and examined.
2150. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
groAving tobacco?— Since 1921.
2151. HaA r e you been flue-curing all that time?—
Ho, I Avas air-curing until 1926.
2152. I understand that you have prepared a state-
ment to present to the committee?— Yes. It is as
folloAvs:—
Hie evidence you have had before you has, I am sure, con-
clusively proved that the Tamworth district can produce, and
has produced, bright tobacco to the extent of 75 per cent,
to 90 per cent., not in one instance only, but in several. It
has been produced, for instance, by Messrs. Steinbeck, Lye,
Chaffey and Goodman. You have Mr. Tregenna’s published
statement in which he declared that the tobacco produced by
Mr. Steinbeck was equal in all respects to American leaf.
All this tobacco was bought by the manufacturers at prices
satisfactory to the growers, and yet Mr. Tregenna asserts
in his evidence that we cannot grow tobacco to satisfy the
manufacturers’ requirements. How can we place any reliance
whatever in a man whose statements are so contradictory?
Mr. McGee conducted experiments in manures which failed.
He attempted to grow tobacco on Mr. Steinbeck’s property, but
in spite of all the expert and financial assistance placed at
his disposal by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, his
product was not comparable to that produced by Chinese
(on the share system) on adjoining plots. Mr. McGee intro
duced a system of closer planting, which has been responsible
for lessening the excessive growth on heavy, rich lands. Mr.
McGee, Dr. Darnell-Smith, and Mr. Tregenna, who raised the
bogy of the eucalypti taint

Mr. Slagg has recommended to the executive of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation Committee the establishment
of a small experimental station in the Tamworth district,
which should, in my opinion, be of great value to the groAvers,
This recommendation was approved.


Excise.
We receive an average of 2s. per lb. or under for our
tobacco, and the Government receives 2s. 4d. per lb. excise.
This is an anomaly which should be rectified, more especially
as a proportion of this amount was added comparatively
recently as a war measure. Its abolition would tend to give
smokers a cheaper tobacco. The grower would receive a
better price without increasing the cost to the consumer.
The selling of tobacco from the growers’ point of yiew is
unsatisfactory. The buyer fixes the price, and his decision is
final. Victoria wants a marketing control act; we already
have one, but it is not yet possible to put it into execution.
With the advent of competing manufacturers it might be
availed of. In the meantime we would suggest, as Victoria
does, that the buyer should be accompanied by a representa-
tive of the growers chosen by the growers.
Recommendations of Tamwokth Tobacco Association.
The Tamworth Tobacco-growers’ Association has agreed upon
the following recommendations:
(1) The abolition or reduction in excise on all Aus-
tralian-grown leaf.
(2) The appointment of an investigation committee hav-
ing in its constitution one representative from each
State, with sub-committees in each State on which
each tobacco-growing district should have represen-
tation, thus establishing a definite contact and co-
operation between the growers and the committee.
(3) The establishment of a central grading station.
(4) The establishment of a small experimental station in
the Tamworth district as recommended by Mr. C. M-
Slagg, Director of Investigations, and approved by
the executive committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation.
2153. Has your association given any consideration to
the proposal for a bounty on Australian leaf? —We
have approached the Ministry on the matter several
times, and also put the proposal before Mr. Bruce at
Canberra. We advanced the proposal on the ground
that the encouragement of primary industries by the
payment of bounties was at that time the policy of the
Government. Mr. Bruce did not give us much en-
couragement. On another occasion we approached Mr.
Pratten, but he did not give us any encouragement
whatever. He said, however, that the Government
might do something with the excise duty. The Tariff
Board had investigated the matter, and had recom-
mended that 6d. per lb should be deducted from the
excise duty and passed on to the growers without being
handled by the manufacturers. The proposal w'ent no
further, however, and we got nothing from Mr. Bruce.
2154. Am I to understand that your association does
not recommend the payment of a bounty on Australian
leaf, but prefers a reduction of excise?— Yes, that is our
present proposal. We see the impossibility of a bounty,
and we have been converted to the idea that a reduction
of excise duty would be the fairest way of helping the
growers. We receive only 2s. per lb. for our tobacco,
while the Government receives in excise 2s. 4d. per lb.
There seems to be something wrong about that.
2155. In your recommendations you suggest the
appointment of an investigation committee having on
it one representative from each State, with sub-
committees in each State on wdiich each tobacco-grow-
ing district should have representation. Do you sug-
gest that that organization should supersede the present
Federal Investigation Committee?—l think it should
be supplementary to it. The arguments advanced at
the meeting of my association the other night w T ere
rather ambiguous. We had the Victorian recommenda-
tions before us, and made them the basis of our recom-
mendations. There is an investigation department at
the present time, and we are asking for representation
of the growers on it. ' We are a long way from Vic-
toria where all the activities are taking place at the
present time. Mr. Slagg keeps us in touch with every-
thing of importance, and is only too willing always
to give us information. I have the greatest confidence
in him, and I think he will ultimately achieve success,
but I do think that the growers ought to have represen-
tation on that investigation committee.
2156. What you are really seeking is representation
of the growers on the present Federal Investigation
Executive? —That is so. These recommendations of
ours stipulate one representative from each State; that,
I admit might make a somewhat cumbersome body.
2157. At present, the committee consists of four per-
sons. If your recommendations are given effect to the
committee will he increased to ten and will be
dominated by the growers’ representatives?—My per-
sonal opinion is that we should have on that body one
or two representatives. There should be one from the
bigger States.
2158. Would it satisfy you to have one representa-
tive on the committee in lieu of one representative from
each State?—l think it would; I can only give my
own opinion.
2159. Mr. Gepp said that he, personally, had no
objection to a growers’ representative. The real diffi-
culty, he pointed out, was to get a man who would be
representative of all the growers of Australia? —Would
there be any possibility of getting two growers’ represen-
tatives on the committee?
2160. It is difficult enough to get one? —Mr. Bruce
could not offer us any encouragement on that point.
He was unable to see why we should have any repre-
sentative. It was, he said, “ Simply done ”.
2161. Would it not be better to get one representative
on the committee, and see how it works, before bothering
about getting two? —Yes, it might be better.
2162. Can you make any suggestion as to how a man
who would be considered representative of all the
growers might be located? —From an interstate point
of view it would be a very difficult thing. There would
probably be a lot of jealousy.
2163. Could you suggest any way in which you could
get all the growing interests in each State to select a
single representative ? —The only suggestion I can make
is that a conference should be called. The trouble is
that the most eloquent man might be chosen, and he
might prove the biggest “ dud ” of the lot.
2164. Your association would not push its recom-
mendation that there should be a representative from
each State? —Ho, I do not think we would push that,
but it is essential that we get representation on that
committee.
2165. What do you mean by your Ho. 3 recommen-
dation about the establishment of central grading
stations ?—Personally, I doubt whether we could convey
the tobacco to the central grading station without in-
juring it.
2166. It is carried now from Tamworth to Sydney?
—lt is reconditioned, and it is never touched after being
put in the bales.
2167. Do you suggest that there should be a central
grading station in Sydney, or one in Tamworth which
would serve the northern districts? —I should say Tam-
worth.
2168. It has been stated, in evidence, that it would
be practically impossible to carry the leaf 9 or 10 miles
without injuring it?— Our climate is so dry, especially
during the winter, that for weeks and months we can-
not touch our tobacco because it is too brittle. It
could, perhaps, be handed, and sent in provided the
cost was not too much.
2169. Do you favour the establishment of govern-
ment grading stations, or co-operative stations estab-
lished by the growers?—l am in favour of the Federal
Government taking over the control of the whole of
the tobacco industry as far as possible.
2170. The Federal Government can only control such
matters as experimental stations. It cannot control
depots or marketing arrangements, because it has no
constitutional power to do so?—I do not know whether
the manufacturers would be prepared to consider the
establishment of grading stations.


2171. They have their own grading stations. You
want to be independent of them?—As far as possible,
yes, but it is impossible to be entirely independent of
them.
2172. You recommend the establishment of a small
experimental station in the Tamworth district. What
information have you on that point?— Mr. Slagg in-
formed us that at the meeting of the executive com-
mittee of the Australian Tobacco Investigation he
recommended the establishment of a small experimental
station in the Tamworth district. This was approved
and he hoped that ways and means would be arranged
to have the work proceeded with well in advance of the
next growing season. The advantages of such a station
would be enormous. Experiments wmuld be carried out
on the spot, and tests made under our own climatic
conditions. We have sent samples of local soils to
Adelaide for analysis, but have heard nothing more
about them. I, myself, sent the samples at the instance
of Mr. Tregenna.
2173. Have you seen Mr. Slagg’s Bulletin No. 2?— l
can see no reference in it to that soil analysis. The
sample was sent before Mr. Slagg arrived from America.
2174. Can you tell the committee whether tobacco-
growing has been a profitable industry for you, person-
ally, or otherwise ?—lt has been a supplementary source
of income. No one can make a living here by tobacco-
growing alone. Taken in conjunction with something
else it is very useful. It provides something to do dur-
ing time of drought. The chief trouble is blue mould.
As regards the proposal that plants should be brought
from other districts, it must be remembered that they
deteriorate quickly. I have heard that some growlers
have got plants from Mildura, but I cannot understand
how they carried so far.
2175. One man at Wangaratta told me that he got
£l,OOO worth of plants from Bendigo?—That seems
rather wonderful. Of course, there is no man in this
district who would take such a risk.
2176. What do you think of the Tamworth district
generally as a tobacco-growdng locality?—l do not say
that it is as good as other districts, but it is a safe
district if the growers could overcome the blue mould
difficulty. There is no doubt that growers here can
produce tobacco. Whether it will continue to be accept-
able to the buyers Ido not know r . The buyers’ require-
ments have altered considerably owing to the spread
of cigarette smoking.
2177. How do you get on with the company?—l get
on all right as far as the buyers are concerned. Of
course, w ? e are in the position of having the price fixed
by the buyer, and we have to take it.
2178. Are you generally satisfied with the prices you
get?— Not always.
2179. Have you had much dark tobacco?— Yes, T
have had.
2180. What your results last year?—My crop
was a failure.
2181. What your best year?—My best year was
1923, when I air-cured. That year I had 237 bales.
It averaged only Is. 2d. a lb., but I received £3,049 for
the crop,
2182. What has been your best year since you started
flue-curing?—l think it was 1927! In that year I had
26 bales of mahogany No. 1 at 2s. per lb., 15 bales of
mahogany No. 2 at Is. Bd., 1 bale of mahogany No. 3
at Is. 3d., 12 bales of dark No. 1 at Is. 6d., i 6 bales
of dark No. 2 at Is. 6d., and 14 bales of dark No. 3 at
Is.
2183. Did you get any bright tobacco that year?—l
got nothing brighter than mahogany.
2184. What labour do you employ?—l have had
Chinese employees, and others as well. The Chinese
have been employed on the share system. They carry
the risk, which you cannot get white men to do/ If the
crop is a failure and fetches nothing, they simply walk
out. You could not ask white men to work under those
conditions.
2185. What was your average price for 1927?—1t
was Is. 6,62 d.
2186. What is your opinion of Chinese labour?—l
would rather have European labour if I could get it.
2187. By Mr. Martens. —The white labour is not so
easy to exploit ?—We do not exploit our Chinese.
2188. By the Chairman. —'There are more Chinese
growers than whites, according to the figures we have
received?—l am not sure they are accurate.
2189. Mr. Lough. —ln the northern district, includ-
ing Manilla, Tamworth, &c., there are 37 white growers
and 59 Chinese. Those figures were taken from last
year’s returns. Most of the Chinese are on shares.
The 37 white men do not include the landlords.
2190. The Chairman. —You do not include Mr.
Parkes as a wdiite grower?—No; possibly his son is
included.
2191. By the Chairman (to witness). —You regard
yourself as an actual grower?—l do.
2192. You yourself have not been very successful in
producing bright tobacco, and there are two other men
from your district who have not had much success,
either. How do you account for it?—l think most
of our land consists of new flats broken up only a few
years ago. Some of us made a mistake, myself
included, in laying down under tobacco land on which
we had previously grown lucerne. There may be some
thing in the curing, also. When we first took up curing
we were entirely in the dark except for the little assist-
ance we got from the State Agricultural Department.
2193. Do you cure your own tobacco?— Yes.
2194. Then the man who cures his own tobacco
must he included as a white grower?—We employ a
certain number of white men in curing once the tobacco
is put into the barn.
2195. Have you included those, Mr. Lough?
2196. Mr. Lough. —Take, for instance, a case like
Chaffey Brothers. I know how many wdiite men are
employed there, and I have allowed for them.
2197. By Mr. Morgan {to witness). —The two most
successful growers, Messrs. Steinbeck and Chaffey, have
said that they depend upon Chinese labour?— Mr.
Steinbeck has three or four Chinese. Mr, McGee, with
his great experience, did not produce anything like the
tobacco that the local growers did.
2198. By the Chairman. —You have every faith in
the Tamworth district as a tobacco-growing area?—l
have. The present difficulty is to produce the class
of leaf that is wanted. In the wool industry the buyers
take everything. Tobacco is the only industry in
wffiich there is not a market for everything that is
produced. In America, I understand, there is a market
for all grades of tobacco. Even in the best districts
there, I understand that they produce from 10 per cent,
to 25 per cent, of dark tobacco, but they can always
sell it. They have a nigger class there, and I suppose
they buy the dark tobacco. I have a letter now r from
an Afghan in Sydney, to the association, in which
he asked for a bale of this inferior tobacco which he
might sell to his countrymen. That is the stuff that is
rejected by the company.
2199. Do you think it is a fair thing for the com-
pany to fix the proportion of tobacco from the Tam-
worth district at 30 per cent. ?—lt does seem hard that
mahogany tobacco should be classed as dark. It is a
good, saleable tobacco.
2200. Mr. Hyson said that 30 per cent, of dark
tobacco would do him?—lt wmuld do me.
2201. You have been getting higher than that?— Yes,
and some of the tobacco has not been accepted on that
account.


2202. You think that in order to give the growers a
chance the company should take at least 30 per cent,
of dark tobacco? —Yes.
2203. And you would be prepared to have Yos. 1, 2
and 3 dark, and mahogany included in that 30 per
cent. ?- —Yes.
2204. That would throw on the growers the respon-
sibility of producing 70 per cent, of bright tobacco?
—The whole of the growers will not produce 70 per
cent, of bright tobacco. A few of them might.
2205. By Mr. Jones. —In view of the fact that
several growers have told us this morning that they
have been producing no bright leaf at all, and bearing
in mind that the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany is prepared to take 1,250,000 lb. of bright tobacco
in 1930, and only 250,000 lb. of mahogany and dark,
w!hat do you say the prospects for growers in this
district are this season ?—Much the same as in other
districts, I presume. I do not see why the company
should limit us to those proportions, however. We
hope that, with the establishment of other manufactur-
ing concerns, that condition of affairs will be altered.
2206. In 1931 the company is prepared to buy
350,000 lb. of lemon, 1,000,000 lb. of bright mahogany,
and 150,000 lb. of mahogany and dark. That is from
Victoria alone?— Why should there be any limits
imposed at all? The company imports tobacco.
2207. Seeing that in the past the growers have
produced no bright tobacco at all, and that under these
new conditions the quantity of dark tobacco being
accepted by the company is diminshing every year,
what do you consider the prospects of the growers in
this district to be?—l hope the conditions will alter.
Are we to be dependent on this one company all the
time to buy our tobacco?
2208. According to the figures furnished in respect
of Mr. Chaffey’s operations, he had only 1.1 per cent,
of bright leaf in 1928, when growing with Chinese
labour, while in 1929, without Chinese labour, the
percentage was raised to 54.5 per cent. Do you think
that other growers here could effect such an improve-
ment as that?—l think they could. A great deal
depends on the season.
2209. Do you think that the elimination of Chinese
labour would affect the matter ?- Hot to the extent you
have mentioned, but it might help. We would all
employ European labour if we could get it.
2210. We had evidence from the buying company
that American bright leaf costs as much as Australian
bright leaf. In view of that do you think that, if the
excise duty on Australian leaf were abolished, it would
encourage the growers to produce more bright leaf ?
lam sure it would. It is the only thing that will make
the industry prosper.
2211. By Mr. Bentley. —You referred to some Tam-
worth growers who were producing 75 per cent, to 90
per cent, of bright leaf. You were including mahogany
tobacco in that, I suppose?— Yes.
2212. The actual position was that in 1929 the pro-
duction of bright leaf in the Tamworth district was
17 per cent.?—l did not know that.
2213. You said that the growers in America produce
from 10 per cent, to 25 per cent, of dark leaf. The
position there is that the growers produce whatever
dark leaf is wanted; but evidence has been produced
before this committee that Carolina and Georgia pro-
duce about 8 per cent, of leaf which would be described
as mahogany and dark, Dr. Darnell-Smith, who gave
this evidence, said that the mahogany leaf he saw in
America was more on the bright side, but that the leaf
classed as mahogany in Australia would be definitely
graded in America as dark tobacco. In America
they grow light or dark tobacco as it is wanted?—
Some of the tobacco imported here from America
is dark. Could we not produce that?
2214. Our attitude is that the objectionable
characteristics of Australian tobacco are accentuated
in the dark leaf. We believe that the production of
this dark tobacco is very undesirable in the interests
of the industry. My company feels that we will not
stop the production of dark tobacco to the extent it
should be stopped until we take up a firm stand, and
refuse to buy it. That attitude has been amply justi-
fied by the evidence I have heard during this inquiry.
A few growers like Mr. Steinbeck and Mr. Chaffey
appreciate the position; but the efforts of these men
are nullified by the action of others who persist in
producing dark tobacco?— With the exception of Mr.
Steinbeck, the other growers have produced a high
percentage of bright leaf only upon occasions.
2215. By Mr. Tregenna. —Mr. Parkes prepared a
statement, a portion of which was not read. There
may have been matter in the portion not read which
would be of interest to me, and upon which I should
like to cross-examine him?—l can produce it if neces-
sary.
2216. The Chairman. —Only that portion read here
goes into the records.
2217. Mr. Tregenna. —ls the statement complete as
it stands?
2218., The Chairman. —As far as we know he has lost
one folio.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Manilla.)
FRIDAY, 14th FEBRUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited;
Mr. E. V. Kremer, representing the Manilla
Tobacco-growers Association; Mr, C. J. Tregenna,
Tobacco Expert, Department of Agriculture, LTeAv
South Wales.)
Henry Percival Baker, tobacco-grower, of Manilla,
was called, sworn and examined.
2219. By the Chairman. —What position do you hold?
—I am secretary of the Tobacco-growers Association
of Manilla.
2220. How long have you held that position ?—About
eighteen months.
2221. Are you a tobacco-grower?— Yes, I have been
growing for ten years.
2222. Have you a statement to place before the com-
mittee?— Yes, the following statement was drawn up
by the association:—
A. The Manilla Tobacco Growers Association feels that it
is necessary to make some reference to the early portion of
the tobacco-growing industry in this district, to enable the
committee to get a grasp of the whole industry leading up
to the present position. From the commencement of tobacco-
growing in this district up till 1923 the growing and prepara-
tion was done principally by Chinese on the share system,
and was sun- and air-cured. Conseqiiently, when the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company refused to buy any more
sun-dried leaf, Chinese tried to produce flue-cured leaf, but
were unsuccessful in producing a quality acceptable to the
company at a profitable price to the grower, so have prac-
tically 7 gone out of the industry.
B. Quite a number of Europeans took up the growing and
flue-curing of leaf after 1923, but not having previous ex
perience to help them they were under a great disadvantage,
and suffered severe losses. Had a tobacco expert been
stationed in the district, who was capable of demonstrating
the growing, harvesting, flue-curing, bulking, grading, and
baling of the crop, most of the growers would have been


trained to be good flue-curers by now, the talk of inferior
leaf would have considerably disappeared, and the growers
would haA 7 e been much more prosperous.
C. In the face of those difficulties we claim that the growers
in this district have proved beyond all doubt that they can
produce the class of leaf suitable to the requirements of the
manufacturers, both as regards to quality and colour, as will
be seen by the results from 1925 to 1929 shown by some
growers, viz.1926 bright leaf, 18 per cent.; 1928, 75 per
cent.; 1929, 73 per cent.
D. The growers consider that the demands of the company
for a 90 per cent, average of bright leaf is a high standard
to set with such brief experience, as we understand a 75 pei
cent, average of bright leaf is considered a good average in
America, where they have had many years’ experience in
flue-curing.
E. Our association takes strong exception to certain reports
published in the press giving the opinions of various officers
connected with the Federal Research Committee, as on dif-
ferent occasions they have stated that the objectionable aroma
is caused by the eucalyptus oils in the soil of the tobacco-
growing districts of the north. This report had a very bad
effect on the industry, and was the means of not only injuring
the value of the various tobacco-growing farms, but also in-
jured the growers in obtaining financial assistance.
F. We further ask for the abolition or reduction, by at
least Is. 6d. per lb., of the excise on all Australian-growm
leaf, and an increase on all imported leaf sufficient to make
up the loss brought about by this reduction. The appoint-
ment of an investigation committee having in its constitution
one representative from each State, with sub-committees in
each State on which each tobacco-growing district have repre-
sentation, thus establishing a definite contact and co-operation
between the growers and the committee.
G. That an experimental station be established in each
district where growers can get first-hand information, failing
which the Department of Agriculture send an expert to each
tobacco-growing district to grow, cure and grade, and carry
out general experimental work. We are further of the
opinion that the whole of the money subscribed by the Com-
monwealth and State Governments should not be spent entirely
in research work, but a portion should be allotted to growers
who have produced a crop, and need financial assistance for
harvesting, curing, &c.
2223. What have become of the Chinese growers?—
They have all disappeared.
2224. How many white growers are there in the dis-
trict?— About a dozen, besides those who are employed
on the tobacco farms.
2225. Do you consider that the Chinese have been
driven out of the industry by the introduction of flue-
curing?—l do.
2226. Do you consider that it is now a white man’s
industry ?—Yes.
2227. Do you think that the white man takes to it
intelligently and enthusiastically ?—That has been my
experience.
2228. Do you find that the casual labourers adapt
themselves to the work?— Yes, after a while. We pay
from 10s. to a£l a day. They are engaged at £1 during
the flue-curing period.
2229. Do you think that the growers have improved
in their flue-curing methods?— Yes.
2230. Do you know 7 all the growers in the district ?
Yes, I visit their farms at times, and I have noticed
an improvement both in their growing and curing.
2231. In what way has the growing improved?—
They have adopted the system of planting closer, top-
ping higher, and of cultivating on improved lines.
2232. How 7 do they deal wdth pests?— Certain pests
are dealt with by spraying.
2233. Wliat spray do they use?—Arsenate of lead is
used for some pests.
2234. Have you ever tried bluestone?—Not person-
ally.
2235. How are you getting on as regards blue mould ?
We get it occasionally.
2236. Not every year?— No.
2237. What conditions do you find conducive to blue
mould ? Cold nights, with cold easterly or southerly
winds, together with an excessive amount of rain just
after a cold snap.
2238. Do you know whether any growers have
adopted methods of their own to deal with blue mould ?
—1 know some who have tried, and with a measure of
success.
2239. Do you consider blue mould a serious factor?—
I do in a way. We get blue mould fairly often, but
we rarely get wiped out altogether.
2240. Where do you get your plants from ?—I always
try to grow them, and if I am not successful, I buy
them in the Tam worth district. N
2241. Do you find that the imported plants resist
the mould better than the local ones ?—lf they are
healthy when they arrive, they resist fairly well.
2242. What has been your general experience of blue-
mould ?—One year in ten we were wiped out completely,
and seven years in ten we suffered partial losses.
2243. So that you had only two years out of ten when
your crops were absolutely free from mould?— Yes, that
has been our experience; one unaffected crop out of five.
2244. You do not know of any effective remedy for
blue-mould?— No.
2245. In your statement you suggested that it would
have been beneficial to have had a tobacco expert in
the district to supervize curing, &c. Is it not a fact
that for a considerable time you had the benefit of Mr.
Kefford’s services?—He was stationed at Tamworth
and visited us sometimes. My own experience is that
I knew nothing about flue-curing when I started. We
wrote to the department and they sent their assistant
expert to us. The trouble was, however, that he could
spend only an hour or two with us, and it takes six
days and nights to cure a barn full of tobacco. A man
who has had no previous experience at all may do the
wrong thing in an emergency, and spoil a whole barn,
whereas, if the department had sent a man along to
put each grower through one or two full barns, it would
have been much easier for us to pick this thing up.
2246. Did you avail yourselves much of the assistance
of the tobacco experts' —We did all we could.
2247. Did you have any difficulty in getting their
services?—No, they came when we wrote for them.
2248. Did you get any literature from the depart-
ment?—-Yes, and we found it helpful.
2249. Your complaint is that you did not have a
resident expert?— Yes.
2250. Would the industry have been big enough to
carry such an arrangement?—l think it would. It is
better for an expert to make three successful flue-curers
in one season than to have a dozen or twenty with only
a half knowledge of it.
2251. That would be of use only to the three, not to
the twenty ?—He could get three one year, and three
the next.
2252. If you could get three men taught properly
each year would you be satisfied ?—I think one expert
could demonstrate to ten growers in a season.
2253. How many growers have there been here at any
one time?— There were about 30 once. Now there are
only twelve.
2254. What is the cause of that?— The change over
from sun-drying to flue curing.
2255. Do you think those men who went out of the
industry made any serious effort to learn flue-curing ?-
I think a lot of them did not have the finance to instal
the flue-curing plant,
2256. Do you know that the company offered to
assist any one to build barns?— They set a certain
amount of money aside, but I do not know 7 that they
offered to assist everybody.
2257. Do you do your own grading ?—Yes,
2258. W hat assistance have-you had?—— We have had
the experts to help us grade. _ We employ unskilled
labour because it is the only kind we can get.
2259. Does not the employment of unskilled labour
result in loss?—lt may at first.
2260. You lose money by it, do you not ?—Yes.


2261. And there is no other way?— No.
2262. How do you grade, by texture and colour?-
Yes.
2263. You said that there had been a big increase
in the percentage of bright leaf since 1926. To what
do you attribute that? —We are becoming more efficient
in growing and curing the tobacco.
2264. Do you consider that the colour depends on
the curing more than on the type of leaf and method
of cultivation?—lt depends to some extent on how the
leaf is grown.
2265. What was your percentage of bright leaf in
1926?—1n that year avc had 18 per cent, of bright
leaf. We had 32 acres under crop, and produced an
average of 486-3/16 lb. per acre.
2266. That is a small yield?—lt was not as high as
some growers got.
2267. Did you have blue-mould that year ?—No.
2268. What was the total yield from your 32 acres?
Would it be as much as 10 tons?—l cannot say exactly.
That year we did a little experimental work with
varieties. We grew five different varieties altogether,
and some did not yield very heavily. The variety that
yielded best was the one that had been grown in the
district for years past.
2269. What sort of soil do you grow on?— Sandy
•loam, which we irrigate.
2270. What price did you get for your bright leaf
in 1926?— Some brought 25., plus 3d. bonus, some Is.
6d., plus 3d. bonus, and some Is. 10d., plus 3d. For
our dark tobacco we got Is. B|d. and Is, 2d. The
average price for the whole crop was Is. 6|d.
2271. In 1927 you had no tobacco? —No, we were
wiped out with blue-mould.
2272. What did you have in 1928?— We had twelve
acres, Avith a yield of 1,118 lb. to the acre. We had
75 per cent, of bright leaf that year.
2273. Did the buyers pay for it as bright leaf? —Yes.
2274. On your grading?—l supervised some of the
work.
2275. How do you account for the improvement ?
1 improved in the method of flue-curing, and, possibly,
also in the method of growing.
2276. What price did you get for your 1928 crop?—
The average was Is. 104 d. per lb.
2277. What were your results for 1929?— We had
eighteen acres which yielded 389 lb. to the acre. We
were caught by an early frost that year. We had 73
per cent, of bright leaf, which brought 2s. 44d. per lb.
2278. Did the 1926 season pay you when you aver-
aged Is. 6|d. per lb. ?—I do not think it did.
2279. Did you work out the figures?—ln 1926 it cost
us for labour alone 9-|d. per lb. to grow the tobacco.
That does not include our oavii labour, nor the interest
on the money invested. Neither does it include the cost
of running the irrigation plant, insurance, shire rates,
or depreciation.
2280. You made a profit of 9d. per lb.? —Yes, but
there was our owm labour, depreciation, &c., to be con-
sidered.
2281. And for 1928? —The cost of labour for that
year Avas per lb. That did not include any of
the other factors mentioned, either.
2282. What did it cost you in 1929 ?—Labour costs
amounted to Is. per lb.
2283. Hoav do you account for the increase ?—Labour
was dearer. The crops were Avorked on the share
system.
2284. That cost of labour A\ 7 ould include the profit
of the share farmers?—lt Avas AA’hat it cost us to get
the job done.
2285. What tobacco have you this year?—l have
about nine acres, Avhich I am growing myself. I have
had to plant it out three times.
2286. Have you any white labour employed?— Yes,
I pay some on a weekly wage, and some by the day.
Some of the labour costs me as much as 15s. a day.
Some of the men on a weekly basis get £3 a week. They
are single men.
2287. Do they take kindly to tobacco growing?—
They seem, to like it, and they are improving.
2288. Do you find white labour more helpful to you
than Chinese labour? —Very much more so. It pays
me to go in for white labour.
2289. You say in your statement that the growers
consider that it is too much to expect an average of
90 per cent, of bright leaf. When did the company
stipulate that amount ?—Some time last year Mr.
Lough told us that the company would buy only 10 per
cent, of dark tobacco.
2290. Did he say that the bright leaf would include
mahogany ?—He said that the company would take
only 10 per cent, of dark tobacco.
2291. He did not mention mahogany ?—Mahogany
would go in with the light tobacco.
2292. Has it been your practice to class mahogany
as bright tobacco?—l went according to the returns
received from the company, and anything which was
not classed in the returns as dark I counted as bright,
I considered that lemon No. 2 was bright, as was also
bright mahogany, bright mahogany No. 2, and
mahogany first.
2293. Did the company ever notify you that
mahogany would be classed as dark?— No.
2294. Did the buyer ever tell you that by including
mahogany in your bright tobacco you were doing some-
thing he did not approve of?—I could never get a very
accurate idea of what really was considered dark
tobacco.
2295. You do not know now?— No.
2296. Excluding mahogany, do you expect to get 50
per cent, of bright leaf?— Yes.
2297. Would you get 60 per cent. ?—I do not think
so.
2298. If you include mahogany as bright, Avhat per-
centage of dark leaf would you get?— Last year’s crop
would work out at 27 per cent.
2299. If they had made you put your mahogany in
as dark tobacco what percentage would you have had?
—Between 50 and 60 per cent.
2300. Do you think that if you had to put in your
mahogany tobacco with the dark leaf you would be
able to get as much as 70 per cent, of bright leaf?—
We might in future.
2301. What do you consider a fair price, year in.
year out, for all grades of tobacco to make growing a
payable proposition ?—I should say about 2s. 9d. per lb.
2302. 2s. would not pay?—l do not think so.
2303. Evidence has been given before this committee
that 2s. would pay handsomely provided the growers
could get a crop every year. Would you be satisfied
with 2s. all round for a good crop?—l do not know that
t would.
2304. Would you be satisfied if it yielded you a profit
of £lOO an acre?—l would. Probably the districts from
which those groAvers come provide bigger average
yields per acre than ours does.
2305. In the Tamworth district the average yield is
nearly a ton to the acre?—We haA 7 e never been able to
do that here.
2306. Mr. Chaffey, in the TamAvorth district, said
that from ten to fifteen acres was the most profitable
area to put under tobacco?—lt is about enough to
handle.
2307. Would it not be possible for you to improve
your yield per acre ?—We might be able to do so.
2308. Do you use fertilizers? —Yes, I have used
them for three years past.


2309. Did it result in improving your yield?—No, I
do not think so; we just tried them out.
2310. Do you think that the men who have remained
in the industry are sufficiently expert to instruct others
in the art of tobacco growing? If any of your neigh-
bours ask you for advice, do you know enough about it
to be able to help them ? —I would give them what help
I could.
2311. If you were asked by your neighbour whether
you would advise him to go in for the industry, what
would you say?—l would advise him to do so. I base
my optimism on the fact that we are producing a better
leaf every year, and I think that in time we will be
able to produce as much as 90 per cent, of bright leaf.
2312, You say in your statement that the associa-
tion takes strong exception to the published statements
about a eucalyptus tint in tobacco-growing soils,
and that this report not only injured the industry
but depreciated the value of tobacco-growing farms,
and made it difficult for growers to obtain financial
assistance. In what way exactly did it injure the
industry?—lt tended to decrease the value of tobacco-
growing land.
2313. Did you have any such experience?—lf a to-
bacco-grower wanted to sell his farm after that he had
no chance of doing so.
2314. Where did you see those reports about the
eucalyptus taint ?—I saw them published in The Daily
Telegraph of the 9th July, 1928.
2315. Do you say that it was a general condition in
the district that as a result of those reports there was
a tendency to depreciate the value of tobacco land ?
Yes.
2316. Did your association take any steps in the
matter?— Yes, we took the matter up, as also did the
Tamworth Association. The statements were challenged
in the press, and as far as I know the experts re-
sponsible for the allegations have not so far proved
their case.
2317. Did you association get any definite evidence
that land values had depreciated as a result of these
association that whereas before the making of these
allegations?—l know the growers complained to the
statements they had been able to get financial assistance
they had afterwards to have their accounts guaranteed
before they could get any help. I know of one grower
who had the experience.
2318. Was the eucalyptus story the reason given for
the refusal to extend credit ?—lt was not stated de-
finitely, but the circulation of the report had a tendency
to make storekeepers nervous.
2319. By Mr. Jones. —Did the banks take any
notice of the story ?—I do not know whether the banks
took notice of it, but a man who does a little valuing
for the banks told me the tobacco land was not worth
as much to-day as it was a feAv years ago.
2320. By Mr. Morgan. —Does that not apply to all
agricultural land?—l would not say that. Land has
changed hands in this district lately at a good figure.
2321. As high as would have been obtained for it
three years ago?— Yes.
2322. By the Chairman—-1 take it you mean that
there was a general opinion among growers that the
circulation of this report did not improve the value of
tobacco land?— That is correct, too.
2323. You say that this report also injured the
growers in obtaining financial assistance; can you tell
us of any growers who were not able to obtain
assistance, say from the banks, as a result of the report ?
I cannot say, except that I know of one grower who
had to have his account guaranteed.
2324. Did the Association interview any of the hanks
in order to find out what their opinion of the report
was? —No, I do not think it did.
2325. In paragraph H of your statement you refer
to the abolition, or reduction by Is. 6d. per lb. of the
excise duty. Why did you pick on Is. 6d. ?—The Assoc
iation thought that the industry would not benefit much
from anything less.
2326. Would the Association prefer the abolition of
the excise duty ?—They would prefer its abolition, but
failing that would like it reduced by at least Is. 6d.
2327. The present excise is 2s. 4d. per lb., so that a
reduction of Is. 6d. would leave an excise duty of lOd.
per lb. You really prefer to have the thing abolished
altogether ?—Yes.
2328. What do you think would happen then?—l
think it would induce the buyers to manufacture more
Australian leaf.
2329. The buyers say that they do not think so.
They say that they might be able to market the leaf,
but that the public would not smoke it. The represent-
ative of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has
stated in evidence that he cannot get the tobacco he
wants in Australia. He has offered to buy 1,500,000 lb.
of leaf from Victoria alone, but that practically 75 or
85 per cent, must be bright. He cannot get anything
like the quantity. The company’s attitude is this: “We
are in the market for bright tobacco, but we cannot get
it. It is not produced in the country.” What have you
to say about that ?—Probably there are not sufficient
growers to produce the quantity of tobacco required.
2330. You have never had any difficulty in selling
your bright leaf to the company?— No.
2331. Have you had difficulty in selling any of your
tobacco.—We had difficulty in selling the first crop of
tobacco we flue cured.
2332. But you did sell it?— Yes.
2333. What do you mean when you say had difficulty
in selling it?—We had difficulty in getting a payable
price.
2334. Did the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany come up to your price?— No. We eventually sold
it to Dudgeon and Arnell. They gave us considerably
more than was offered by r the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, That was in 1925.
2335. Have you heard from them since ?—Yes. .
2336. Are they still buying?— They have bought
some since.
2337. You would not depend on them?— No.
2338. You look to the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company to buy your tobacco?— Yes.
2339. That was the only occasion upon which you
had any difficulty of disposing of your tobacco to the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company?— Yes.
2340. Have they rejected any of your tobacco?
—Yes.
2341. Why did they reject it?—l think it was
because the leaf was a bit on the green side.
2342. Did you keep the leaf to mature?— Yes.
2343. Did it improve?— Yes.
2344. Did you try to sell it again?— Not to the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company. We sold it
elsewhere.
2345. According to your statement your Association
favors the appointment of an investigation committee
having in its constitution one representative from each
State. Have you thought about the difficulty of ap-
pointing those representatives ?—lt may he difficult.
2346. At present the investigation committee is
composed of Mr. Gepp and three scientists. Do you
suggest that the committee referred to in your recom-
mendations should take charge of federal investiga-
tions?— No.
2347. How would it work, then?— Our idea was that
every tobacco district should appoint a representative.
Those representatives would look after the interests of
their own districts, and make suggestions to the rep-
resentatives of the State. In turn, the State repres-
entative would make suggestions to the committee;
that is the present Research Committee,


2348. Would it not be possible for your association
here to select a man and ask him to keep in touch with
the federal committee direct ? Can you think of a man
who would fill the bill?'—Yes, I can.
2349. Would you be satisfied to have one grower’s
representative on the executive representing the whole
of Australia? —It would be better than no representa-
tive at all.
2350. Do you not think that if you had a repres
entative of each district on the committee they would
tend rather to handicap the scientists in their work?
Suppose you had five or six tobacco growers and three
scientists, the scientists would get nowhere at all? —
That may be so, but our idea was that conditions vary
so much between one part of Australia and another,
that it is necessary that the committee should have
someone to advise it regarding local conditions.
2351. The position is that the committee will accept
one representative of the growers but no more. The
difficulty is to get a man who would be really represent-
ative of the tobacco growers. If you know of such a
man send his name along to Mr. Depp. In the last
paragraph of your statement you recommend the
establishment of a small experimental station in this
district. Mr. Parkes has told us that the Agricultural
Department proposes to establish such an experimental
station at Tamworth. Would that satisfy the Manilla
growers ? —I should not like to speak for all of them.
2352. Do you think that such a station would be of
any use to you?—lt might, but our soils are different
from those at Tamworth.
2353. You would like to see an experimental station
here, too? —I would.
2354. It wmuld cost a lot of money. —It would be
possible, perhaps, to make it self-supporting.
2355. Could not an experimental farm at Tamworth
conduct experiments here? —It could.
2356. Would not the Manilla growers be prepared
to accept that on trial, and see what happens ?—1
should not like to speak for the association.
2357. You are secretary, and should know 7 the view’s
of members. Do you think that if the proposition
were put to them they would not press for the establish-
ment of an experimental farm at Manilla? —-Probably
they would not.
2358. You admit that you have had Mr. Keffard
here to assist the growers, but that he was not able to
stay long enough. Has your association ever put it up
to the department that you required more assistance?
Ho, the association has not.
2359. How do you know what, view the department
would take of such a question ?—I do not know what
view it would take.
2360. Anyway you suggest that you do need more
expert assistance? —I think that it would be beneficial.
2361. By Mr. Morgan. —Evidently the report regard-
ing the alleged eucalyptus taint caused something of a
stir in this district?—lt did.
2362. Do you know, as a matter of fact, that not one
of the experts, either those of the company or of the
Government, has associated himself with the statement
about the eucalyptus taint?—l saw in the press where
they said that they did not.
2363. As a matter of fact no expert has done so.
They all deny that they had anything to do with that
report. In other words, the report has got about as the
result of newspaper commentary on a series of investi-
gations made by the research people to try to locate
the cause of the objectionable aroma in Australian
tobacco. Experiments had been carried out with euca-
lyptus, but the newspaper commentator seized on this as
an excuse for saying that the experts had declared that
the objectionable aroma of Australian tobacco was due
to eucalyptus. Even in The Daily Telegraph report ol
the 9th, July 1928, to which you. referred, Mr,
Tregenna only says that it might be due to eucalyptus
and that experiments were being carried out to prove
or disprove the possibility. Do you see the point?—
Yes.
2364. By the Chairman.- —Dr. Darnell-Smith ad-
mitted that there was no data on which they could base
a definite conclusion. Certain experiments had been
carried out. One was to add mascerated gumleaves to
the soil. The first year they produced a eucalyptus
aroma in the tobacco. The next year no fresh leaves
were added, and while there was still an aroma, it was
not objectionable. He declared that it could be deduced
from that experiment that eucalyptus, over a period of
years, could be responsible for a very palatable aroma.
Ho evidence has been put before this committee which
could substantiate the allegation that the character-
istic aroma of Australian tobacco is due to eucalyptus.
—We were going by what we saw in the newspapers.
2365. By Mr. Tully. —Do you know Mr. Slagg? —1
have met him.
2366. Have you seen his book? —I have a copy of it.
2367. Did you write for it, or did he send it to you 1 *
—He sent it to me.
2368. By Mr. Martens.— What is about the average
production per acre in this district ? —I cannot give the
average for the district, but on our own place our
average over the past four years has been 659f lbs. to
the acre.
2369. What is the highest yield you have had ?—One
year we got 1,118 lbs. to the acre off twelve acres.
2370. Do you know whether that is a fair average
for the district? —Yes, for that particular year. In
a good year, if everybody had a good crop, they would
produce somewdiere about that quantity.
2371. Have you heavy or light soil? —light, sandy
loam.
2372. By 'he Chairman. —Have you ever discussed
the suitability of the soil with the expert ?—One year
we sent a parcel of soil to the Department of Agricul-
ture for analysis with a view to determining what fer-
tilizers to use. The department wrote saying that they
were unable to analyse the soil at the time. Since then,
I. believe, the department has obtained some scientific
equipment which enables them to make an analysis of
the soil.
2373. When was that?—ln 1925.
2374. By Mr. Morgan. —Did you try the Common-
wealth Council for Scientific Research?— Ho.
2375. Do you think it would be worth while?—lt
might be.
2376. By Mr. Martens. —Might it not be a good
thing to try again, and also to get the Commomvealth
people to furnish a report ?—Yes, it might.
2377. You might be trying to grow tobacco on soil
that is not suitable for it, while it could grow other
crops quite well?— That is possible.
2378. The point is that in Tamworth they are pro-
ducing a ton to the acre, wdiile you say that half a
ton to the acre is a good average crop for this district
in a good season? —We never bothered to get samples
of our soil analysed after our first unsuccessful attempt.
2379. By Mr. Jones. —With regard to the proposal
for reducing or abolishing excise, do you realize that
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company cannot now
purchase in Australia all the bright leaf that it requires?
—I realize that.
2380. Do you know that American bright leaf and
Australian bright leaf cost the company about the
same? —I did not know that.
2381. It is a fact. If 2s. 4d. per lb. excise on Aus-
tralian-grown leaf were removed, would it not be an
incentive to the buyer to buy Australian leaf in prefer-
ence to American? He would be able to give the Aus-
tralian grower Is. per lb. more and still be getting the
leaf cheaper than he could import it.from America?—
That is so.


2382. Would that not be an incentive to the grower
to produce more bright leaf ?—That is very likely.
2383. That is the opinion of your association?— Yes.
2384. Do you think that experimental work should
be extended? —Yes.
2385. Do you think that such work should be super'
vised wholly by the Federal Government?—l think it
should.
2386. Does you association think it would be a good
thing to have the whole cost of such experimental work
borne by the Federal Government?—l think the Govern-
ment should undertake the whole of the cost.
2387. Is that the opinion of your association? —Yes,
as far as I know/.
2388. By Mr. Bentley.- —There is a remarkable dif-
ference between the results obtained by yourself and
your father last yetir ? —I might be able to explain that.
My father had a pretty fair stand of tobacco on his
place, with no misses. On my place, we had a touch
of blue mould, and had a lot of misses.
2389. By Mr. Kremer. —Comparing the price of sun-
dried leaf with that received for flue-cured tobacco, do
you think the price for the hue-cured product compen-
sates for the extra expenditure necessary to produce it ?
—I do not think we are making as much out of our
hue-cured tobacco as when we were sun-drying. Our
expenses are so much greater.
2390. What was the highest price you got for your
sun-dried -tobacco ?—ls. Bd. per lb., 1 think.
2391. Do you remember the number of hands em-
ployed in the industry at the peak period?—ln 1926
there were about 60 white men, I should say.
2392. And how many are there employed at the
present time?— About 25.
2393. Would you say that it cost £lOO a ton to pro-
duce hue-cured tobacco ?-—I should say it costs con-
siderably more than that.
2394. Have you read the article in The Northern
Daily Leader, dated 11th July, 1929, headed “ Prema-
ture Statement ” ?—I have read it, and I should say
that the statement was made without proper authority.
2395. By Mr. Martens. —Did you take it that some
damaging effect might accrue from the statement
already published?—l took it that way, and also that
it might interfere with the work being done.
2396. By Mr. Kremer. —How r many years do yon
think it w-ould take a man to understand flue-curing?—
It would depend upon a man’s intelligence. One man
might pick it up in Jive years, another might take ten
years.
2397. Could you become proficient in five or seven
years?—l think I could.
The witness withdrew.
William Considine Parkes, tobacco-growei, Attunga,
and President of the Northern Tobacco-growers
Association, w r as recalled and further examined.
2398. By the Chairman. —I understand that you have
some further evidence to place before the committee?—•
Yes. A folio w T as missing from the statement which I
read before the committee at Tanrworth. It w-as just
after I had introduced the subject of the eucalyptus
taint in tobacco, and Mr. Tregenna took exception to
the incomplete statement going on record. The missing-
portion of the statement is as follows:
The first publicity given to the supposed eucalypti taint was
at a meeting at Canberra composed of interstate delegates,
at which Mr. Tregenna stated that Mr. McGee, Hr. Darnell-
Smith and himself had decided that the inferiority of the
tobacco grown in Australia was due to the above, and that
the whole of the soil where tobacco had hitherto been grown
was impregnated with the taint. Being in the chair, I pointed
out to Mr. Tregenna the danger of allowing such an unproved
assertion to be broadcast throughout the w'oHd, as it might
leave a stigma not only upon Australian tobacco, but upon
many other of our primary products also. To our astonish-
ment, he replied that a report, per medium of Mr. McGee,
was already on its way to America, and that the result might
be wiied any day. I asked him if it was a fair and reason-
able thing that America should receive through a foreign
agency a report the contents of which was of vital importance
to Australia. His reply was that the company had paid for
it. and could do what they liked with it.
It would appear to the growers, as to you gentlemen, that
on the flimsiest of nnsnbstantiataed evidence, Mr, Tregenna
was prepared to sacrifice the interests of tobacco-growers of
Australia, and probably imperil the hitherto unchallenged
excellence of other primary products.
2399. By Mr. Tregenna. —ln the earlier part of your
statement, you refer to a newspaper paragraph in
which I am reported as having said that the tobacco
grown on Mr. Steinbeck’s property was equal to any-
thing produced in America. Do you accept that news-
paper report as a statement of fact?— When such a
report is allowed to go uncontradicted, I do. It
affected you individually, and you were in a position
to contradict it. Did you do so?
2400. I am questioning you at the moment?—My
reply is that it was reasonable to assume that the
report was correct.
2401. Are you aware that on no occasion have 1
expressed the opinion that Tamworth leaf is equal to
American leaf in quality of burning aroma?— You
have not said so to me, I admit; but we have not
discussed the matter very much.
2402. You have mentioned the subject of the alleged
eucalyptus taint. Is it not a fact that at Canberra
t was asked whether certain works had been done in
connexion with the eucalyptus theory?—lt might be.
2403. Have you any record of the statement I made
at Canberra?— Yes, a mental one, wliich can he cor-
roborated if necessary by other persons here to-day.
2404. Are you quite sure that your account of what
took place is correct ?—lt is, to the best of my belief.
2405. Are you of opinion that any man of average
intelligence, given suitable tobacco soil, could produce
light coloured leaf?— With experience, yes.
2406. Can you tell us what price you have averaged
for your tobacco?— About Is. 7|d. per lb.
2407. Why do you not produce light leaf. Is it due
to the quality of your soil?— The soil has not been
analysed. Ours is a comparatively heavy soil.
2408. Has the quality of your tobacco improved?—•
I think so.
2409. Has that improvement been reflected in the
price?— Bad seasons are reflected in the quality of the
tobacco, and will affect it as much as soils.
2410. Would you compare your soil with that of
Mr. Quick’s adjoining you ?—-Yes, I would.
2411. Can you say why Mr. Quick has never pro-
duced any light tobacco ?—Because he has worked the
soil for only a short time, and has not been on it long
enough. His is a new farm.
2412. How many years has Mr. Quick been working
that farm?—-Only about five or six years, I think.
2413. And he has never produced any bright leaf?
—I did not say so. Who said that?
2414. By the Chairman. —We have been told that
Charles William Quick has been growing tobacco for
eighteen years?— Yes; but not on that farm. He was
growing it as a boy on his father’s place.
2415. By Mr. Tregenna. —The point is that Mr.
Quick, having similar soil to your own, has not pro-
duced any bright tobacco, nor have yon. Do you think
it is a matter of intelligence, or of soil?—lt is not a
matter of intelligence, but of soil. Mr. Quick has
bad bad results from his flue-curing. In the first place,
w r e did not know anything about flue-curing. Mr. Quick
and I started at the same time. Mr. Tregenna used to
pay us a short visit, and stay perhaps an hour or two,
and then go away. That is no use to a man who is try-
ing to learn flue-curing.


2416. Are you aware that picked samples of your
1926 and 1927 crop were sent to the Imperial Institute
in London for report?—lt was sent without my know-
ledge. Who sent such samples?
2417. They were taken by the Australian Investiga-
tion Committee in Sydney, and sent to London?— Who
picked the samples?
2418. Mr. Gepp suggested it, and the samples were
picked by me?—lf it was known that the tobacco was
of such inferior quality, why were they sent?
2419. Would you be surprised to learn that this leaf
was reported on as of no commercial value, and useless
for the English market?—Ho, I would not be surprised.
If you picked rubbish, what else could one expect?
2420. I picked fair samples from the crop ?—I say
that you are not competent. The company would not
have bought the tobacco from me if it was as bad as
the report makes out.
2421. Have you ever made a statement, or have you
ever heard one, to the effect that I am in the pay of
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company?— Ho.
2422. By inference or innuendo, have you ever
heard it or made it?— Ho.
2423. By Mr. Martens. —lf it is true, as has been
suggested by Mr. Tregenna, that samples of tobacco
grown by you were sent to England for report without
your knowledge, do you think that was fair?—T think
it was an abominable thing.
2424. By the Chairman. —Have you anything fur-
ther to add?— The proportion of white and Chinese
labour employed in the tobacco industry of this district,
given by Mr. Lough, is apt to create a wwong impres-
sion. There are more white people employed in the
industry than Mr. Lough gives it credit for. For
instance, my neighbour employs four or five white men
and three Chinamen. On my own farm I have had
three Chinamen, and five or six white men, some on
shares and others working for wages. My own son is
working on shares.
The witness withdrew
Cecil Joseph Tregenna, tobacco expert, Department
of Agriculture, Hew South Wales, was recalled
and further examined.
2425. By the Chairman. —Would you like to tell the
jommittee about any samples of tobacco tested from
the Tamworth and the Manilla districts ?—-Yes. Mr.
Gepp, the chairman of the Australian Tobacco Inves-
tigation, instructed me that samples from all the States
of the various types of tobacco should be sent to the
Imperial Institute in London. Among the samples
of Hew South Wales tobacco chosen was one from Mr.
Parkes’ farm, taken from the highest-priced tobacco
grown that year. Duplicate samples were sent to
Melbourne. Ido not know whether the report on those
samples has been published; but I do know that it is
in existence, and if reference is made to that report
it will be seen that the facts are, as I stated, in regard
to Mr. Parkes’ tobacco.
2426. The report has a key, from which it can be
learned whose were the samples sent?— The key is held
by the Australian Tobacco Besearch Committee in
Melbourne.
2427. Do you know the nature of the report received
from the institute?— Yes.
2428. What was it?—lt was to the effect that the
sample was of no value whatever, and was unsale-
able.
2429. What was the nature of the investigation?—
The Imperial Institute is used by the colonies and the
dominions as a clearing house for information, and
for testing their products. The samples are submitted
by the institute to judges in Great Britain.
2430. Were the samples .of tobacco sent from here
made up into smoking mixture?—l should say so; but
I do not know.
2431. Were other reports received regarding samples
from this district?— Half a dozen samples were sent
from each State.
2432. Was Mr. Parkes’ the only sample from this
district?—A sample of Chaffey Bros.’ tobacco was also
sent.
2433. Was any sample from Manilla?—A sample was
sent of the tobacco grown by Mr. McGee for Mr.
Heydon. The report stated that this sample was very
inferior, and practically of no value. I am speaking
from memory.
2434. What was the report regarding Chaffey Bros/
tobacco?—lt was equally bad. It was stated that it
had little or no value.
2435. Can you tell us why these particular growers
were picked on?—As representative samples of tobacco
in the district.
2436. They were regarded as a fair sample?— Yes.
The highest priced tobacco in each grade was sent
from each State.
2437. Did Mr. Parkes get the highest price?— Yes,
in that grade.
2438. What it amounts to is: That report would
apply only to that particular sample?— That is so.
2439. Do you consider that those reports would be
highly damaging to the tobacco industry generally in
this district?— Yes.
2440. Do you think it would be a fair standard to
apply ?—A perfectly fair sample was chosen. All the
samples represented the best quality leaf in their grade.
2441. Mr. Parses was picked on as representative of
the Tam worth district. Only one other man was
chosen, Mr, Chaffey. On the tobacco grown by those
men judgment was passed, and it would appear that the
tobacco grown in the Tamworth district was valueless.
That would be sufficient to condemn the tobacco of the
whole district?— Ho.
2442. I thought you just admitted it?—l did not
mean that. They were representative samples of that
grade of tobacco.
2443. In any publicity given to the matter would it
appear that those two samples represented the highest
grade of tobacco in this district, and that those samples
were commercially worthless?— Yes.
2444. Do you think the effect of that report would
be damaging to the district as a whole ?—Possibly, yes.
2445. Do you think it a fair test to choose a sample
of tobacco grown by a man who is not known as a
grower of high class tobacco, and to treat that as repre-
sentative of the district?— Mr. Parkes is a grower of
long standing, and is a representative grower in the
district. He is president of the Tobacco Growers’
Association. It was thought it would be a good thing
to get an opinion on his tobacco.
2446. But there are 200 growers in the district? —
The matter was governed by the price paid.
2447. Supposing a buyer had no local knowledge,
and refused to buy tobacco from this district because
it was reported to be valueless. Would that not be
an injustice?— Apparently the buyer here does not
think the tobacco worthless.
2448. Why was not a sample of Mr. Steinbeck’s
tobacco sent?— Because a higher-priced tobacco in that
grade was produced elsewhere in Hew South Wales
that year.
2449. The system seems to be absolutely unreliable.
Here is_ a man producing the highest grade tobacco
in the district, but his leaf is not taken into considera-
tion in determining the standard of value for this dis-
trict. Ho opportunity was given the judges to test
the quality of Mr. Steinbeck’s leaf?—Ho, that is so.


2450. By Mr. Martens.— How were the tests made?
—-Cigarettes were made from the leaf and smoked.
2451. How many people took part in such a test? —
I cannot say. The leaf was sent to England and
judged there. The samples kept here were tested by
Mr. Slagg and his assistants in Melbourne, and refer-
ence is made to those tests in, Mr. Slagg’s pamphlet.
2452, By Mr. Jones. —When were those samples sent
to the Institute?—ln 1927.
2453. What was the gist of the report?— That the
tobacco was of inferior quality.
2454. The report of the institute, after enumerating
the defects of the samples tested, states —“The chief
cause of these defects is insufficient or unsatisfactory
curing.” I take it that this refers to Australian
tobacco as a whole? —I am not in a position to say.
2455. The report says that the chief cause of the
defects is insufficient or improper curing?—l do not
agree with that.
2456. You do not agree with the conclusion set forth
in the report of the Institute?—l do not agree that
the defects of any of the tobacco are due to insufficient
curing.
2457. You do not place much value, then, on any of
the reports?— Hot on that point.
2458. Do you know that the samples of Australian
tobacco sent home in 1901 held their own with the
American tobacco of similar leaf?—l was not aware
of that.
2459. In 1920 further samples were sent from Vic-
toria, and they practically held their own with
American leaf in open competition. Do you still say
that Victorian tobacco is valueless? —Ho.
2460. Can you reconcile the favorable report regard-
ing the Victorian tobacco with the unfavorable report
regarding that sent from Hew South Wales? —Unless
I had seen the leaf I would not care to express an
opinion.
2461 . By the Chairman. —The Imperial Institute
report says—“ At the same time, the series taken as
a whole indicates the possibility of producing tobacco
of satisfactory character in Australia.” Do you agree
with that ?—I do.
2462. So it comes down to this, that the samples
you sent in represent only poor types of tobacco ?—•
Selected from land which, in my opinion, is unsuit-
able for the production of good tobacco.
2463. Mr. Chaffey received 2s. and 2s. 2d. per lb. for
his tobacco. Can you blame him for continuing to
grow ?—Ho.
2464. Do you blame Mr. Parkes for continuing
when he gets Is. per lb.?—Mr. Parkes says it does
not pay him, so I do blame him for continuing.
2465. Can you tell us why the growers were not
notified about the samples being sent?—l was simply
acting on the instructions of Mr. Gepp. The idea
was to find out whether Australian tobacco was good
or otherwise. I picked the samples according to the
prjee .of the various grades, and on as even a sample
as possible.
2466. Were you given any instructions to notify the
growers?—Ho, it Avas desired to keep it absolutely
confidential.
2467. By Mr. Jones. —In spite of this report will
you agree Avith Mr. Gepp Avhen he says that he holds
the opinion that Australia can and Avill supply all the
tobacco that Australia requires?—lt cannot be done
from Hew South Wales or Victoria; but it can be-done
from Queensland. That remains true unless and until
the public taste changes back to the old, dark tobacco.
2468. You believe that in spite of the reports on
the samples’of Australian tobacco sent aw r ay in 1901
and 1921 ? : —I do. The public taste has changed very
much even since 1921. The public are going in more
and more for light, and even neutral tobacco.
2469. Do you rule Victoria out as not being able
to supply the tobacco required?— With the exception of
Pomonal, I would rule out Victoria and the whole of
New South Wales.
2470. How r do you reconcile your opinion with the
attitude of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,
who say they are prepared to buy ten or fifteen times
as much tobacco from those two States as they have
been able to get ? The company makes no distinction
between Victoria, Hew South Wales or any other part
of Australia?—l take it that the company Avould not
buy the tobacco if it could not use it.
2471. By the Chairman. —Does not that indicate
that there is a future before the industry in Victoria
and Hew South Wales?—lt indicates that the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company is a far better judge
of tobacco than I am.
2472. It indicates that there is a future demand for
ten times as much tobacco as there is being produced
to-day. Does not that alter your opinion as to the
quality of tobacco that can be grown here?— Ho.
2473. Do you consider that the Hcav South Wales
Department of Agriculture is in any way responsible
for the poor development in the industry?—Ho, I think
it has done its best, and cannot do any more.
2474. Would you say that it is worth the depart
ment’s while to continue in its attempt to improve
the quality of the leaf?— Personally, I say “Ho,” but
my chiefs say “ Yes ”.
2475. By Mr. K remer. —How many years have you
been an expert?— For fourteen years.
2476. What was the quality of tobacco grown in
South Africa when you were there? —Bright, high-
grade cigarette leaf .
2477. Would you compare what is known as Boer
tobacco with our leaf?—lt is very similar to that now
being grown in Tamworth.
2478. Do you know Mr. McGee, the tobacco
authority?—l did know him.
2479. He possesses university qualifications, does he
not ?—I do not know.
2480. You say that samples of Tamworth tobacco
sent to the Imperial Institute in London were declared
to be worthless?— Words to that effect.
2481, Evidentally the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company is manufacturing tobacco which, in the
opinion of English experts, is worthless?— Worthless
for the English market.
2482. You agree with the report of the Imperial
Institute?—l must agree.
2483. Yet you disagreed with the opinion of a scien-
tifically qualified man who declared that our soils were
suitable for the growing of tobacco?—l would disagree
with him if I believed him to be wrong.
2484. You will accept the scientific report of the
English authorities to the effect that our tobacco is
worthless ?—As a matter of fact, that was a trade
report. The people who judged the tobacco were
tobacco-dealers in Great Britain.
2485. Was it not a scientific test ?—1 do not think
you can make a scientific test of the smoking qualities
of tobacco. Tobacco is judged on palate and taste,
and no scientific qualifications are required for that.
2586. Did you see the report in which your name
was mentioned, and which dealt Avith certain acti\ r ities
in Queensland? —I ssav it, but I did not challenge it.
As a public officer I Avas not permitted to do so.
2487. If I said that you were holding a position
which you were not qualified to fill, would you challenge
that statement?— You Avould be entitled to say it if you
believed it. You are perfectly free to say whatever
you like about my qualifications. If it were a criminal
libel, it would be a different matter.
2488. You saw the reports to which I referred?—
I saw them.


2489. Did your chief protest ?—He could not protest,
2490. I thought you were a member of the board? —
I was associated with the members of the board in
an advisory capacity. I was lent to the board for six
months, and at the time that report appeared in the
press 1 was not attached to the Australian Tobacco
investigation.
2491. Many years ago you made a statement in my
hearing that Bathurst was one of the finest tobacco-
growing districts in Australia ?—I have never said
that about Bathurst.
2492. During the past fifteen yeai’s you have stated
from time to time that you had discovered new tobacco-
growing areas. You are still discovering them?— Not
during the last two years.
The witness withdretv.
David Munro Mackenzie, storekeeper, Manilla, sworn
and examined.
2493. By the Chairman. —We have been informed
that, following upon the publication of the report
regarding a eucalyptus taint in tobacco, land values in
this district depreciated. Do you know anything about
it?— People certainly seemed to be less keen on tobacco
growing after the publication of that report.
2494. Did you discuss the matter with any of them ?
—ln a general way only. They seemed to have the
idea that they would not be able to dispose of their
tobacco at a profit.
2495. Do you think that that rumour seriously
affected the growing of tobacco in this district ?—No,
not in itself.
2496. Did you, as a storekeeper, take an unfavorable
view of the industry on that account?— Not altogether.
2497. Has it been your practice as a business man
to give credit to growers?— Yes, I did a large business
in that direction.
2498. Do you regard the tobacco-grower as a man
whose industry is valuable?— Yes. My view is that
by assisting the growers we are helping to build up the
industry,
2499. Have you assisted many of them?— Yes, by
giving stores and making cash advances sometimes.
2500. Would you advance as much as £loo?—Some
times as much as £2OO or £3OO throughout the year.
It depended on the amount of tobacco a man grew 7.
2501. He would give you particulars of the crop?—
Yes.
2502. The value of that crop would depend on the
price they were getting for it ?—I am referring to the
old sun-drying days, Avhen we knew pretty well what
prices would be obtained. A man would tell us how
much tobacco he was growing, and we knew what his
return would be. Some of the growers let us down;
not always through their own fault, but because the
crop did not yield as much as was anticipated.
2503. Have the growers been more anxious for
assistance since flue-curing came in?— Yes, because the
expenses are greater.
2504. What view have you taken of it?—l am still
anxious to assist the industry. Ultimately something
may come of it.
2505. Are the flue-curers doing better than those who
grew under the sun-drying conditions ?—No, it was
more profitable in the sun-drying days.
2506. Have any of the flue-curers let you down?—
I do not regard it as being so satisfactory as in the old
days. I have not the same confidence in the industry.
2507. Would you accept a man’s word if he told you
he had 20 acres under crop and excepted to get 10 tons
off it, or would you personally investigate the matter?
—I would not investigate it personally. I have not an
expert to do such investigations, but can get one of
our own staff to give a rough idea.
F. 218. — 12
2508, Did land values depreciate after the publica-
tion ol the report about a eucalyptus taint?— There
were no actual sales.
2509. Did it make any difference to you in your
attitude towards the industry ?—I had it in the back
of my mind that the prospects were not so good as they
were. 1 did not regard it as a death blow to the
industry, but as a serious drawback.
2510. Did you regard it as throwing the whole
industry into the melting pot?— Not to that extent.
1 did not think that there would be no sale at all for
tobacco, but I thought there might be lower prices.
2511. Did you refuse to assist any grow T er on that
account ?—No.
2512. Did you find that after the publication of that
report the growers were not able to stand up to their
commitments ? That might be due to the seasons. No
one told me that he could not get a good price just
toi that reason. Personally, I did not hold that report
against any of the growers in making advances.
2513. Do you consider the growers bona-fide in
their desire to grow a good class of tobacco?— Yes.
2514. Have you ever met any growers who made it
clear that so long as they grew something that looked
like tobacco they could bluff the buyer?—Nbj they are
all anxious to establish the industry.
2010. Do you think that if there were more growers
it would materially increase the prosperity of the dis-
tinct ?—T think so. If there were 200 growers here
it would be better for the district.
2516. Have you formed any opinion as to the
improvement effected by growers in recent years?
Have you visited their farms?— Yes, I have seen them
curing.
2517. Do you consider that the growers have made
any noticeable improvement in the appearance of their
leaf? There appears to me to be a marked difference
between the leaf now, and that produced in the old sun-
curing days.
2518. Do you think there is any comparison at all?
I should say that the flue-cured leaf is infinitely better
than the other.
2519. Are you a smoker?— Yes.
2520. Do you consider yourself a judge of aroma in
tobacco?— No.
2521. What do you smoke?—De Beske cigarettes,
and sometimes a pipe. At present, I am smoking
Edgeworth tobacco.
2522. Here are two brands of Australian tobacco;
Waratah ” and “ Sunday Best ”. Would you be pre-
pared to smoke them?—l should be tempted to do so.
They smell very nice indeed. 1 cannot detect any offen-
sive odour whatever in them.
2023. Is there any great demand for those tobaccoes?
I do not think that we sell much of them, so 1
assume there is not much demand for them.
2,)24. Do you think that the demand for a tobacco
like that depends largely on advertising?— Very largely.
2525. Evidence has been given that the company
advertised these local tobaccoes, and for two years the
sales increased. Then, in spite of the advertising they
fell almost right away. The company came to the con-
clusion that the public, after having tried the tobaccoes,
did not continue smoking them. Do you think you can
consistently' sell a bad article by 7 advertising?— l would
not go so far as to say that.'
2526. Well, a moderate article ?—Yes, good advertis-
ing will sell an article of moderate quality.
2527. In the ease of a good article, if you cease to
advertise it, will the demand fall away?— Yes, the
demand will go off no matter how good the article is.
Were it not for this the well-known articles would cease
to be advertised.


2528. Have you anything else to say ? —I should like
to see some assistance given to this industry, because,
ultimately, 1 think, something will come of it. We
send a lot of money out of the country every year, and
it would be better for us if we could produce our require-
ments here.
2529. Assuming that there is in Australian tobacco
a fundamental defect such as a bad burning aroma,
would any government be jusified in forcing the public
to use it ?—1 would not have the public forced to use
it, but I think that by research, and attention to the
proper class of tobacco and proper methods of curing
any such defect might be remedied.
2530. What is your experience as a business man
handling various commodities; would you say that if
the public badly want a thing they will, if supplies are
suddenly cut off, turn round and accept the next best ?
Certainly. If the public were used to a certain tobacco,
and supplies of that tobacco were cut off, they would
soon become used to Australian tobacco. People will
smoke, and if they cannot get one sort of tobacco they
will accept another.
2531. By Mr. Jones. — The tobacco industry is
languishing in this district ?—lt is inclined to do so.
2532. What do you think is the reason ?—Bad sea-
sons, perhaps as much as anything else. When the
growers were sun-drying, very little expense was in-
volved; but now so much capital is required for the
erection of barns, &c. that the growers become dis-
couraged.
2533. But there has been a falling off ever since 1926
when hue-curing came in ?—The seasons had something
to do with it perhaps. This year the crops are light on
account of the bad season.
2534. Have you thought anything about a reduction
in excise duty on the tobacco ? —Ho.
2535. At present, both imported and locally-growm
tobacco pays an excise duty of 2s. 4d. per lb. If the
excise duty were abolished on locally-grown tobacco
would it induce more people to engage in the industry
to supply the increased demand ?—lt seems reasonable.
It would depend, of course, upon the selling price to
the public. If the excise duty on Australian leaf were
wijoed out, and the price to the public correspondingly
reduced, that would naturally stimulate the demand for
local tobacco.
2536. By Mr. Tully. —lf the price were reduced by
4s. a lb. it would help the industry?—l think more local
tobacco would be sold.
2537. By the Chairman. —Would you say that the
public are concerned at all times wdth the quality rather
than the price?— With tobacco that is so to a consider-
able extent.
2538. Will they go for the better quality even though
it is dearer ? —ln the case of tobacco, I think that is so
more than with other things.
2539. Take Capstan cigarettes, for instance, the
cheapest on the market, for which there is a great
demand. Do you think that if a somewhat inferior
Australian blend were put on the market at the same
price, they w r ould have any chance in competition with
Capstans ?—Ho.
2540. But if the Australian cigarette w r ere sold at say
3d. a packet, would they have a chance? —Yes, they
w 7 ould.
2541. Do you remember wdien Capstan cigarettes
were 3d., and 6d. cigarettes were regarded as something
of a luxury, the demand for 3d. cigarettes w ; as enor-
mous ?—Money was scarcer then.
2542. The cheap cigarettes w 7 ere regarded as bad,
but people still smoked them? —That is so.
The witness withdrew.
Henry Morriee Baker, tobacco-grower, Manilla, was
called, sworn and examined.
2543. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
a tobacco-grower I —l have been growing for about
eleven years, under both sun-drying and liue-curing
conditions.
2544. Do you work your place in conjunction with
your son? —Yes.
2545. Can you tell us anything about the introduction
of Hue-curing in this district? —Yes. At the time we
were informed that we would*have to install hue-curing
plant, I had only just bought my present property, and
had improved it for air-curing. I had only obtained
one year’s crop when the change-over was made. The
result was that I was involved in extra cost to the
extent of £2,500. I had been told by the representative
of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company that sun-
and air-dried tobacco would have to go out, but that
it would not go out in my time.
2546. How do you make out that the change over
cost you £2,600? —It is made up by the cost of build-
ing sheds, purchase of poles, forks, &c. The two large
sheds cost £l,OOO, and there was one shed which I
bought on the place as an improvement.
2547. Could you not use a lot of the sun-drying plant
for flue-curing? —A little of it could be used. We did
make a bulk shed of one of the existing sheds, but w r e
had to build two flue-curing barns which cost £6OO.
2548. Did you get any warning about the change
over ? —There w-as no warning until a meeting was
called in Tamworth on the last day of October, 1923.
We lost a year’s production over that, because w r e did
not know 7 until it was too late to produce a crop that
any sun-dried tobacco would be bought at all.
2549. Did you ever receive any direct wuirningc—
Ho; neither in writing nor verbally.
3550. What did you do when you received the warn-
ing at the meeting?—We set about producing another
crop.
2551. The company bought some sun-dried tobacco
after that?— Yes, but we did not know 7 in time to get
a crop ready.
2552. What has been your experience of flue-curing?
—lt has been a difficult job for those who had no
previous experience. It is like learning a new trade.
We certainly received advice and assistance from the
department’s experts, but, unfortunately, the amount of
time at their disposal w 7 as not sufficient to enable them
to give us as much instruction as w T e needed.
2553. Before you could get the hang of the business
they would go off somewdiere else?— Yes. The experts
should have at least one full season in a district, and
the district should not be too large at that.
2554. How 7 many growers do you think an-expert
could deal wdth satisfactorily?— About ten in one season.
2555. If you had 100 growers in a district you w 7 ould
need ten experts?— Other growers could be invited to
come along and learn.
2556. Do you think a grower would like to have a
herd of other farmers running around his place wdiile
his curing w 7 as going on?—I think most of the growers
would be broad-minded enough to make whatever sacri-
fice w 7 as necessary for the good of the industry.
2557. Did you association ever put that proposition
to the Department of Agriculture?— Ho.
2558. Did you ever complain that you -were not get-
ting enough personal attention?— Ho. The growers
recognized that the experts had more than they could
do. I maintain, how 7 ever, that if the activities of the
experts had been confined to one district for one season,
and to another district for another season, we should
have had more proficient growers than we have now.
2559. That refers to curing the leaf only. What
about the growing of it?—lt would be better to have
an expert stationed in a district for, say, three years
to assist in the general production of satisfactory leaf.


3560. Do you think there are sufficient experts avail-
able in Hew South Wales for that?—l would not ven-
ture an opinion on that, but I think there is a number
of growers capable of giving instruction in flue-curing.
3oCl. Those' are men who have picked it up them-
selves s —Probably they have received some help.
-•'6-. I’o yon think there are half a dozen growers;
here competent to undertake that work? Mr. Tro-
genua says there are not?— Perhaps Mr. Tregenna is
right.
3568. Would it not be better for the growers them-
selves to throw more energy into learning the art of
Hue-curing? Most of them have learnt by their own
efforts, and are getting good results if they are keen?-•
f think that is what most of the grousers are doing
but they would get on much quicker if they had more
expert tuition.
3564. Do you think the sons of the present tobacco-
growers are likely to be more expert at curing and grad-
ing than their fathers are?- —Undoubtedly.
3565. Do yon find the young men taking an intelli-
gent interest in the industry ? —A very keen interest.
3566. Do you find them lacking in energy, and more
anxious to lie down than to work? —Hot when there is
anything important to do. At times one can give and
take a little.
3567. One grower told us that one fault with white
labour, so far as tobacco-growing is concerned, was
that they were, inclined to be lackadaisical; like a good
many other Australians, he added. Do you find that?
—USTo.
3568. You do not think there is any labour difficulty?
—Ho, except in getting skilled labour. However, th“
young men shape very well.
3569. Do you think there is such a thing as the
“tobacco bug”? I mean an all-pervading enthusiasm
amongst those who take up tobacco-growing?—-Of
course, there are men who are very optimistic. What
holds a lot of men in the industry is the fact that
they have all their money sunk in it. They are hoping
ail fhe time that they will be able to make a success
of it eventually.
3570. Does tobacco hurt the soil for other crops ?
We have not found it so.
3571. Does it take the strength out of the soil?—f
do not think so. We have grown good cabbages and
other vegetables after tobacco.
3573. Have you made money out of tobacco?— Ho.
There have been years in which we have shown a
profit; but, generally speaking, on account of the large
sum of money we have invested in the industry, we
have not made anything.
3573. It has paid you to stay in the industry ?—We
have had to stay in because we have been hoping
to get our capital back. We are not actually losing
money. We have been just living out of the thing.
2574. Do vou make tobacco-growing yonr main line ?
—Yes.
2575. Do you think that, is a mistake?— Yes. There
are years when w T e have done better out of cauliflowers
and other crops.
2576. Do you think the best thing is to grow tobacco
as a side line?—l think it is best to make it one’s
main crop. I have confidence in tobacco, and I think
we will eventually overcome blue mould.
2577. If you got a crop every year at present prices,
the industry would be a good one to he in?—l think
eo.
2578. Have you been dissatisfied with the prices you
have received from the company?— Ho. I consider
I have always received a fair price for the class of
leaf I have had to sell.
2579. Have you ever argued with the buyer about
the price he has offered you?— Yes, at times. That is
only natural. On one occasion we sold our crop to
Dudgeon and Ariieli, because were were not satisfied
with the price offered by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company. I grew some sun-dried leaf for
the Melbourne firm afterwards, but they are not
regular buyers.
3550. Do you think the colour of the local tobacco
lias improved?—! do. Within the next three years
I think there will be a still greater improvement. ISTew
men are learning flue-curing all the time. Many
growers did not change over to flue-curing because of
the lack of labour. They will come back into the
industry, I am sure, when there are enough skilled
men.
3581. What do you consider is a fair average area
lor one man with two or three sons to work?—A man
with three sons should be able to wmrk 16 acres.
3583. With side lines?— Yes, some side lines, hut not
too many.
3583. Do you think tobacco-growing is a whole-time
job?—lt demands a lot of attention, but it is possible
io attend to other things.
3584. You think a man would get better results if
he devoted his whole time to tobacco-growing?— The
crop needs to be watched very carefully wffien growiug.
3085. Have the local growers- improved in their
methods of grading?— They have improved, and are
still improving. At first many growers used to think
it was ail right to stick in a bit of faulty leaf now and
again, but they are beginning to realize now that it is
bad business.
3,)86. Would you say that an average price of 2s. per
jb. for everything would pay you?— Hot if one has to
irrigate. 1 think the average price should be at least
3s. 3d., but to produce what is required at least 3s. 9d.
would be a fair price.
3587. Do you think this district can eventually pro-
duce 70 per cent, of bright tobacco, not including
mahogany ?—Yes, J do.
3588. You know that the company is now classing
mahogany as dark?— Yes.
3589. Does that make any difference? —It makes a
difference, of course. However, I think that in two or
three years at the outside the growers should be able
to produce 70 per cent, of bright leaf, excluding
mahogany.
3090. By Mr. 'Bully.- —What sort of soil do you grow
on ? —-Sandy loam.
3591. What fertilizers do yon use?— The fertilizer
recommended by the company.
3593. Have you ever planted tobacco after lucerne ?
No.
3593. Does your crop turn yellow in the field ?—lt
has a yellow tinge.
3594. And you do not harvest it until it matures? —
Not if one wants to make a good job of it. We under-
stand that the company wants an improvement in the
colour, texture and aroma.
2595. By Mr. Jones. —ls a half ton to the acre the
must the growers can get in this district ?—When we
were sun-drying the leaf, we have grown more than
half a ton to the acre. Since then our returns have
not been better than half a ton. 1 still think that when
we are favoured with suitable seasons we should he able
to produce at least 14 cwt. to the acre.
3596. Most of the growers at Tamworth said that
tney could average one ton to the acre?— The Tamworth
soil is heavier. Our soil is supposed to produce better
leaf.
2597. What do you estimate the cost of producing one
( on of tobacco?—l think it would be more than £lOO.
3598. At 3s. a lb., a ton of tobacco yields £224. Do
you think that payable?—l do not think ii would be
payable if growing by irrigation.
3599. You mentioned 3s. 9d. ? —Yes.


2600. That would return £275 or £3OO a ton. You
do not think that £224 a ton would pay you?— Not
year in, year out. If we could get good seasons every
year it might pay, but I still think that at least 2s. 3d.
per lb. would be needed.
2601. Do you think that a price of 2s. per lb., plus
Is. bonus, is sufficient? —Yes, that Avould be all right.
Anything sold at 3s. per lb. would be very payable.
2602. What percentage of bright leaf Avould you need
to produce in order to make the industry payable?—l
have not gone into the figures. We try to produce Avhat
is required.
2603. If you could produce 70 per cent, of bright
leaf, and get 3s. per lb. for it, would that pay you?—
Ues.
2604. Even if you get nothing for the dark? — The
other AA r ould not be so inferior that Ave Avould not get
something for it. The tAA T o combined would be payable.
2605. Are your views on the future possibilities of
tobacco-growing in this district as pessimistic as those
of Mr. Tregenna ?—Absolutely no. I think the industry
is going to be an important one in this district.
2606. By the Chairman. —How do you account for
so many groAvers going out of it during the last feAV
years?— The bulk of the groAvers were sun- and air-
curing, and they did not go in for flue-curing because
of the lack of experienced labour. Previously, they had
their tobacco grown by Chinese labour, and the land-
lords themselves had little experience. They were not
prepared to take the risk under the new conditions.
2607. What experience have you had of Chinamen in
the industry?— None since the sun-drying went out.
The Chinese are not necessary to the industry now.
2608. Will they do what they are told? —Not always.
2609. What is the trouble? —-They have been follow-
ing their own methods for so long that they will not
depart from them.
2610. Perhaps they cannot? —That may be so.
2611. But they do try to get decent tobacco. They
are not out to grow rubbish? —They endeavour to grow
a heavy type of tobacco. They top too low, Avith the
result that there is only a small number of leaves on
the stem. This has the effect of producing a big leaf.
Their argument is that if they can get as much per
plant by leaving tAvelve leaves on as by leaving eighteen,
the sensible thing is to have only twelve, and thus save
themselves handling.
2612. By Mr. Bentley. —Your average of bright leaf
improved in 1929. Was it due just to seasonable con-
ditions, or did you make any change in your methods?
—ln 1929 we had a very good stamp of tobacco. This,
together with the greater experience Avhich my son has
gained in flue-curing, resulted in a better return for
my crop. My tobacco Avas cured at the end of the
season.
2613. Your price improved from Is. lOd. in 1928, to
2s. 9f in 1929. The improvement Avas partly due to
the payment of an extra bonus. Out of fourteen bales
you had ten that we classified as bright, Avhile the other
four were very close to it. You were very close to 100
per cent, bright?— The plants came from the beds in
good condition, and did \ r ery well.
2614. Is your soil the same as your son’s? —Prac-
tically; the places adjoin.
2615. By Mr. Tregenna. —With regard to your last
crop, do you not think that the reason for your success
is that your son had shown so much improvement in
flue-curing and grading?—We attributed it to having
good, healthy plants to start with, together with the
fact that my son had improved in his method of curing,
2616. By Mr. Jones. —In view of the general lack of
experience, and the difficulties encountered by groAvers
in getting expert graders, what is your view regarding
the proposal to establish a central grading depot?—lt
would be a good thing if it did not entail too much
expense.
2617. Do you think that such a depot would be of
benefit both to buyers and growers?— Yes, if it could
be established on a proper footing.
2618. By Mr. Bentley.— Mr. Baker, junior, has
pointed out that there was one bale rejected by us.
Unfortunately, no mention was made of it in our notes.
That, of course, would alter the percentages.
2619. By Mr. Kterrier. —At what do you estimate the
cost of irrigating tobacco?—-I estimate it at 6d. per lb.
2620. By the Chairman. — Do you make that up in
the better price received for irrigated tobacco?— One
might make up the leeway by getting a more uniform
crop.
The witness withdrew.
William Aubrey Haydon, tobacco grower, Manilla,
was called, sworn and examined.
2621. By the Chairman. —Are you a member of the
Tobacco Growers’ Association?— Yes.
2622. How long have you been growing tobacco? —
For eighteen years. I have tried it in partnership, and
with Chinese labour.
2623. What has been your average acreage?—l have
always been associated with partners, and we have
planted anything from 20 to 30 acres.
2624. What has been your average yield?—lt varies
considerably. According to Mr. McGee, the biggest re-
turn obtained in the southern hemisphere for tobacco
was achieved in this district, when three acres produced
over 1 ton to the acre, and brought £765.
2625. Was that on your property?— Yes; the ave-
rage Avas over £255 an acre. That Avas four years
ago.
2626. What proportion of dark tobacco Avas there in
that? —I do not remember.
2627. Do you call mahogany bright tobacco?—We
were taught it was bright when we began to grade.
2628. Who taught you that?—We were led to believe
that. I Avas taught by a young employee of the com-
pany.
2629, Have you been classing mahogany as bright
ever since?— Yes, I have been calling it bright
mahogany. It was left to the buyer what he should
class it as.
2630. Did not the buyer tell you that he did not
class it as bright?—l have not sold them any bright
tobacco during the last two years.
2631. But at any time did the buyers tell you that
mahogany was not being bought as bright tobacco?—
I do not remember.
2632. You kept putting it in as bright without re-
ceiving any directions to the contrary?— Yes.
2633. Is this the first time that the company did
not class it as bright ? —I heard about it a few months
ago. Of course, mahogany is in a class by itself.
2634. Did the return you received from those three
acres pay you?—lt did.
2635. That Avas an exceptional case?— Yes.
2636. To what do you attribute it? —Mr. McGee had
a special fertilizing mixture with which he was experi-
menting. Also, it was a particularly good season. We
attributed the exceptional results to the fertilizer. We
ha\ r e been trying for the last four years to do the same
thing again.
2637. Are you using the same fertilizer?—lt is sup-
posed to be the same chemically, but the manufacturers
made certain alterations which were supposed to be
for the better. We put it on one lot of tobacco two
years ago, with the result that it smelt like dead fish.
2638, Have you continued to use fertilizer?—Wa
have cut it out.


2639. That crop was grown under the supervision of
Mr. McGee? —Yes; we attribute its success to Mr.
McGee and his assistant.
2640. He went away without giving you a clear idea
of how to continue it?—We expected to see a lot more
of him but did not. He was supposed to be here for
three years, but we could not get in contact with him
again.
2641. When he went away you had no idea how to
continue his w T ork?—He merely told us to use the fer-
tilizer, and to practise intense cultivation. We failed
to reproduce his results because the chemical content
of the fertilizer had been changed. Reports concern-
ing the excellence of that crop were published in the
press at the time, and the following article was printed
in The Manilla Express, of 27th August, 1926.
Maxilla Tobacco Leads the Way.
Although he only arrived in Australia last November, Mr.
McGee quickly set to work and established experimental plots
on the Ovens River, Victoria, on the Upper Murray, Tumut,
Tam worth and Manilla. The result of the experiment has
now been ascertained, and shows that the whole of the
southern plots have been a failure. At Tamworth better
results were obtained, but it was at Manilla that anything
near approaching success has been acquired. Mr. McGee
v isited Manilla on Monday last, and in an interview stated
that the Manilla experiments were most outstanding. He had
adopted a system of specially prepared fertilizer, assisted by
intense cultivation. The experiment had had a fair trial in
every way. The land was a composition of rich sandy loam,
and was for the most part composed of river made soil. The
fertilizer had operated on the plant life with double effect,
it had retarded the rankness which usually accompanies forc-
ing of growth, and at the same time developed the finer
qualities of the leaf. In this way weight is increased and the
quality standard raised. The 31 acres of the experimental
plot produced 31 tons of tobacco, or a shade over 20 cwt.
per acre. This compares more than favorably with the usual
average of 10 < vvt. of this district and the 5 cwt. per acre
averaged in Victoria. But it is in quality that the experi-
ment has been most successful. Australian tobacco is noted
for its wild scented smell which is objectionable to tobacco
smokers. One of the objects of Mr. McGee’s mission is to
overcome the presence of this evil smell. He now feels sure
he has to a large extent attained success. Bales of the
tobacco from the Manilla experimental plot were opened on
Monday, the 23rd of August, after being pressed for periods
of from five to six weeks, the aroma resembling the sweet
odour of new mown hay, and the present appearance being
excellent. “ I am more than pleased with the result ” said
Mr. McGee, “ which has borne out my theory. lam convinced
that tobacco equal in quality to America’s best can be pro-
duced in Australia. It needs cultivation, and science, to
find out how.” As regards the adaptability of Manilla dis-
trict soil for tobacco, Mr. McGee said that it compared favor-
ably with any district he had seen in Australia. He predicts
a big future for the district in the tobacco industry. “ Your
district has the sole requirements necessary to produce
tobacco leaf with the assistance of science that any Aus-
tralian will enjoy to smoke; that is what the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company requires,” he concluded. Mr.
McGee is a firm believer in irrigation. We drew his atten-
tion to the fact that the Government had publicly stated that
good tobacco could not be grown by means of irrigation.
“ Rot ” said Mr. McGee. “ The experiment in Manilla dis-
trict has proved that tobacco responds better to the effects of
fertilizer per medium of irrigation than by rainfall. To
grow tobacco successfully you must fertilize, and in order
to give the fertilizer a chance to operate to best advantage in
these dry climates you must irrigate ”.
Mr. McGee will be staying permanently in the north during
the coming season, and will be prepared to give growers every
advice and assistance within his power that might help them
towards improving the quality of their tobacco crops.
2642. Did your association discuss that article?—
Yes.
2643. You are satisfied that it represents fairly
what Mr. McGee said?— Yes.
2644. Mr. McGee never made any correction to that
statement?— No. He made the statement to me first,
and the following day he made it in The Express
office.
2645. Does his statement mean that this is the only
district possessing the necessary requirements for grow-
ing satisfactory tobacco?—l think he meant that it
was the only such district of which he had had experi-
»nce.
2646. Are you aware that since then Mr. McGee par-
ticipated in experiments with Mr. Tregenna and Dr.
Darnell-Smith in an endeavour to locate the cause of
the alleged objectionable aroma in Australian tobacco?
—Yes.
2647. According to evidence submitted, Mr. McGee
was responsible for experiments with American soil.
He also sought to locate new districts in which tobacco
could be successfully grown. Does not that indicate
that after he left here he changed his opinion?— Yes.
and I wondered why.
2648. Your opinion as a tobacco-grower of eighteen
years’ standing is that the Manilla district is suitable
for producing bright leaf?— Yes.
2649, Have you yourself had much success in pro-
ducing bright leaf?— Yes.
2650. You have heard that a sample of this leaf was
picked out and sent to the Imperial Institute in London
which reported unfavorably upon it. What have you
to say regarding that? —I think it must have been
picked out of somebody else’s tobacco.
2651. It was from your leaf?—l am surprised that
the report should have been as it was. It indicates to
me that one cannot put much faith in experts.
2652. Was the sample taken from part of that three
acres to which you have referred?— Mr. Tregenna
said that it was part of that crop.
2653. If we could only find out for certain whether
the samples were taken from that crop it would he
enlightening. Do you know r as a fact, Mr. Tregenna,
that the samples were from that crop?
2654. Mr. Tregenna. —They were.
2655. Mr. McGee said that it was first class tobacco,
while the report said that it was worthless?— That is
so.
2656. What success have you had in producing
bright leaf?—lf we have a good stamp of tobacco, and
the curing is properly supervised, we can produce good
leaf.
2657. But have you yourself been getting bright
leaf?—lt looks bright when it comes out of the barn,
but the longer it is kept the worse it gets.
2658. Do you do your own curing?— Yes. I was
instructed in the art by Mr. Scarvell, of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company. He was resident on
the farm when Mr. McGee’s experiments were being
undertaken. Mr. Jensen also taught me something
about curing.
2659. Is he supposed to be an expert?—He is a good
man when he likes.
2660. Do you consider you are improving?— Natu-
rally one improves every year.
2661. We want to know how you have got on as
regards the production of bright and dark tobacco over
the last five years?—lt was grown on shares, and I
cannot take the responsibility for another man’s
curing.
2662. Mr. Bentley.—ln 1926 Mr. A. B. Haydon had
76 hales of tobacco, of which 29 bales were graded by
us as bright. His average price for the bright tobacco
was 2s. 6d. He had another lot of 88 bales, which was
nearly all air cured, and for which he averaged Is. Ofd.
per lb.
2663. By the Chairman. —ln 1926 you had a little
more than 60% of dark tobacco?—l was working with
Chinese that year.
2664. Mr. Bentley. —ln 1928 Mr. Haydon was work-
ing in with a number of other persons. He had 45 bales
of tobacco which averaged Is. 3.16 d. Four bales were
classified as bright, and eight bales as inferior bright.
2665. By the Chairman. —You did not improve your
percentage that year?— The crop was badly affected
with blue mould, and the fertilizer which I used was


unsatisfactory. A farmer cannot afford to carry out
experiments because mistakes cost too much. Such
work should be done by experimental stations.
2666. Do you make tobacco growing a whole-time
business? —Hot altogether, but it is the principal crop.
2667. How do you think it has paid you over the
eighteen years you have been growing?—lt paid well
in the old sun-drying days. How, however, the cost oi
production is so high that the prices we do not
pay us. There is too much trouble and expense in com-
bating pests, blue-mould, &c., and the strain on the man
who is trying to grow tobacco is tremendous. If a man
put as much energy into another line oi business be
could make a lot more money.
2668. What does it cost a ton to flue-cure your
tobacco ?- —About £45.
2669. I Avas told yesterday that it cost about £3o?
It is a technical point where the curing ends, and the
bulking down begins.
2670. Do you do your own grading?— Yes.
2671. Have you bad any instructions? —Yes, Mr.
Scarvell taught me something about it.
2672. But for him you would have been hard pushed
to learn anything about it? —Yes.
2673. Have you ever applied to the State departrneni
for information? —Ho.
2674. Has it been offered to you?-—Air. Kefford has
visited the farm, and has always been prepared to give
information. He was a man avlio could teach one some
thing every time one spoke to him. 1 Avould he quite
satisfied to haA r e Air. Kefford stationed iu this district.
2675. Do you think it Avas a retrograde step for the
department to take him aAvay ?—I think so.
2676. As a matter of fact, he resigned, but I do not
suppose he would have done that if it had been made
worth his while to stay on? —I think he Avould have
liked to have progressed Avith the industry, and when
the industry seemed to suffer a set-hack he thought it
better to get out.
2677. Would you say that an average price of 2s.
per lb. for your tobacco, including light and dark,
would pay you? —Ho, it Avould not pay expenses.
2678. Blit if you got a good crop every year?—!
think avc would need to get 2s. 3d. per lb. even then
it would need 2s. 9d. per lb. to keep a man in the in-
dustry under present conditions.
2679. Have you given any consideration to the pn>
posal for the payment of a bounty, or the reduction ot
the excise duty?—l endorse what has been recom-
mended on the subject by our association. I also think
it Avould be of great assistance if the act were altered
to alloAv any person to manufacture up to 5 lb. of
leaf without having to get a licence. In that "way we
could sell a lot of local leaf, and the public might
eventually go hack to the old style of t hacco.
2680. But in that case you would have manufacturers
all over the place?— Hot if the limit w T ere made 5 Ih.
In the old days every man made up bis own tobacco
for his own use.
2681. Do you favour the payment of a bounty?—Ho
I should prefer to see a reduction in the excise duty,
and an increase in the duty on imported leaf.
2682. Do you know that there has been an increase
of Is. on imported tobacco in the last twelve months ?
Yes.
2683. By Mr. Morgan. —According to your theory
you Avould have everybody smoking Australian tobacco ?
—lt would he some time before there were sufficient
groAvers to produce all the tobacco needed in Australia
2684. By the Chairman. —Do you not think that the
protection of Is. per lb. on Australian leaf uoav is
sufficient? TAvelve months ago there was no protection
at all. Do you think that abolishing the excise duty
would cause the manufacturer to buy more Australian
leaf ?— I am certain of it,
2685. But w'hat if the manufacturer could not sell it
to the public?— That would be awkward, but I think
the public would buy it. Apparently a lot of manu-
facturers have faith in the industry. Take, for instance,
the number of companies that have been formed since
this inquiry began.
2686. We have heard of only one. Do you think the
taste of the public could be altered in favour of Aus-
tralian tobacco by cheapening the price?—l do.
2687. According to the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company, all brands of Australian tobacco are sold at
less than the imported tobaccoes, and yet there is little
demand for them? —But the company contend that the
public are smoking cigarettes.
2688. By Mr. Jones. —Do you think that a reduction
in excise duty and a corresponding decrease in the price
of the tobacco to the public, would encourage new
companies to explore the possibilities of manufacturing
Australian tobacco? —I do.
2689. Do you think the possibilities have been ex-
plored already? —The trouble is that new firms are
absorbed by the bigger companies.
2690. By the Chairman. — We have no evidence of
that. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company says
that it is prepared to buy at least ten times as much
bright leaf in Australia as it is getting now, hut is
unable to obtain it. It is prepared to buy that tobacco
at prices from 2s. to 3s. per lb. What do you think
of that?—ln order to produce the quantity of bright
tobacco Avhich the company wants it is impossible to
avoid producing a large quantity of dark tobacco.
2691. It has been said that in the Tamworth district
it is possible to produce 60% of bright tobacco, and one
grower has got as high as 95%. That is Air. Steinbeck.
Mr. Baker said that it Avas possible to produce up to
70% of bright tobacco Avithout mahogany? —Yes, zt can
be done, but I am not sure that avc can beep up our
present yield per acre T AA r e do.
2392. 'The position seems to he that any man who has
bright tobacco is sure of a price for it in the vicinity of
2s. per lb.. The company cannot get enough of it at
the price. What do you consider the reason?— The
reason is that it does not pay the growers to produce it
2693. The evidence given before us is that anything
above 2s. per lb. Avould pay. At 2s. per lh., a ton of
tobacco is worth over £2OO, and that, Ave have been
told, should yield a profit of £lOO an acre? —If one
had those returns every year it might pay.
2694. Then the real difficulty seems to be, _ not in sell-
ing your bright leaf at a payable price, but in overcom-
ing had seasonal conditions? —Just at present that is so.
2695. Do you think that difficulty Avill he minimized
by scientific investigation?—l think so.
2696. Have you any faith in scientific research? —1
think our main hope lies in that.
2697. Have you in your possession Air. Slagg’s Bul-
letin Ho. 2?— Ho, I die! not know until to-day that it
had been published.
2698. Do you think.the growers are at a disadvantage
in not being able to get in touch with the work being
done by the scientists? —Possibly.
2699. Do you not think that the association might
arrange Avith the Department of Agriculture, or Avith
the Federal Tobacco Investigation, to send regular sup-
plies of literature ?—I think it would be a good thing.
Personally, I never treated the department seriously
in regard to tobacco. The department has said for the
last fifteen years that our tobacco is no good.
2700. Can you refer us to any definite pronounce-
ment to that effect ?—lt has been always told us by our
experts.
2701. Who, in authority, has told you that? —I have
heard Mr. Tregenna say that.
2702. But that was only to-day?— Mr. Tregenna has
told me before that we must improve our tobacco.


2703. Leaving out Mr. Tregenna’s statement to-day,
can you point to any authority which has stated, either
verbally or in writing, that the tobacco produced here is
no good?—No, I cannot.
2704. By Air. Tully. —How many plants do you grow
to the acre ?—There were 8,000 plants to the acre in
the famous crop which Mr. McGee grew. We now
keep the number down to about 7,000. If more than
that are put in the leaf is too thin.
2705. By Air. Jones. —Was the Pacific Tobacco
Company one of those to which you referred when you
said that new companies had been recently formed?—
Ves.
2706. It has a capital of £90,000, and there is also
the Phillips Tobacco Company, with a capital of
£500,000 ?—Yes.
2707. Would you say that it would be in the best
interests of the tobacco industry in Australia to have
those companies in operation ?—lt would mean com-
petition, and competition Avould benefit the farmers.
2708. Would not the abolition or reduction of excise
duty be an inducement to further companies to begin
manufacturing-?— Yes, it would be an inducement to
others to come in, and some of those who have gone out
might come back again.
2709. Suppose you had half a dozen buyers coming
here, would you take a risk and increase your area so
as to supply the tobacco needed? —I rvould.
2710. By Air. Morgan. —ls there not a possibility
that with more companies in operation the overhead
cost of manufacturing would be increased, and the
price to growers might actually be reduced? —Of
course, anything can be carried to extremes.
2711. By the Chairman. —If two or three big com-
panies were competing, and found that prices w T ere
getting too high, they would make an agreement among
themselves to limit prices?— That is looking a good
way ahead.
2712. Ho you not think the first thing to do is to
grow enough light tobacco to meet the demand of the
present company?— Yes.
2713. And if the price is not sufficient you can then
consider bringing about some alterations in the fiscal
policy?—lf v. r e could produce the necessary quantity
every year eA T erything would be all right.
2714. By Air. Jones. —Ho you know that the rebate
given by the British Government on tobacco grown in
the dominions is more per lb. than the average price
obtained by the Australian growler?—l did not know
what it amounted to.
2715. Ho you know: that in eight years, owing to that
rebate, the production of tobacco in Canada has
doubled ?—I have heard that.
2716. Ho you think that what has been done in
Canada as a result of tariff protection could be done in
Australia ?—I think it is Avorth a trial.
2717. By the Chairman. —Suppose a war were to
break out to-morrow and all our supplies from abroad
cut off in a night, lioav would the demand for tobacco
be supplied Avith Australian leaf? Ho you think that
the growlers could possibly meet the situation?— The
only way to do it immediately would be to take a big
percentage of air-cured tobacco. Tobacco can be pro-
duced not only in these districts, but in numerous places
through Australia. Thirteen years ago, I was growing
tobacco in Harwin. The seed was brought from
Manilla, but it had a decided cigar tang.
2718. Was there any blue mould there?—No, and avc
had 65 inches of rain in the year.
2719. Hoes that support the theory that the best way
of combating blue mould is to get your plants from other
districts?— There is a lot in it. I do not think you
would get blue mould up in Cairns. I have seen tobacco
groAving wild there among the cobble stones,
2720. By Mr. Jones.—Do you class yourself as an
optimist or a pessimist regarding the future of the
tobacco industry i —lt depends on the attitude of the
Government.
The witness withdrew.
Edmund Victor Kremer, tobacco-grower, Manilla,
and Vice-President of the Manilla Tobacco Growers
Association.
2721. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?-—I became interested in tobacco 21
years ago.
2722. Have you been growing it continuously since
then ?—Practically.
2723. On shares or in partnership ?—Partnership,
principally, with the exception of about three years.
2724. Ho you employ Chinese labour? —I did in the
early sun-drying days.
2725. You were always able to sell your tobacco? —
We sold it in Brisbane at an average price of about
Is. 3d. to Is. 4d. per lb.
2726. Hid that pay you?— Yes, we preferred that to
present conditions.
2727. Hid you go over to flue-curing?—l was forced
over.
2728. What area did you have? —Prior to flue-curing,
27 acres was the largest area I ever had under tobacco.
After wards the biggest area I ever planted on shares
lias been about 16 acres.
2729. With Chinese or white men? —Chinese.
2730. What has been your experience with flue-cured
tobacco?—-It Avas a severe financial knock. I had just
completed valuable sun-curing appointments when I had
to incur the expense of installing flue-curing apparatus.
2731. Hid you put in barns?— Yes, we built two.
2732. Hid you put in an irrigation plant?--No, we
had a plant before. Prior to the change-over I shifted
my locality. I lost £1,400 at tobacco growing in three
years.
2733. What was the trouble, seasonal difficulties?—
Yes. and trying to encourage ■white labour.
2734. How are you getting on with flue-curing?—l
flatter myself that I am getting on well.
2735. What soil are you growing on ? —Light loam.
2736. What has been your yield per acre ?—Between
12 and 15 cwt. We got 80 bales of sun-dried leaf, and
37 of flue-cured leaf off 16 acres.
2737. Have you, personally, cultivated your tobacco?
—On three different occasions I did the whole of the
work myself. I also did the curing.
2738. Hid you find the process difficult to learn?—lt
is really like manufacturing any other commodity.
Sixty per cent, of one’s knowledge comes from eye-
sight observation. It is much the same as wool-classing,
or any other such occupation.
2739. Hid you spoil many barns?— No. I assisted
Mr. Scarvell Avith the crop that Mr. McGee grew.
2740. Ho you find the grading difficult?— Not diffi-
cult, but tedious.
2741. Ho you think it pays to be careful?—lt does,
but it is hard to get helpers to take that alcav.
2742. Have you had competent assistance?—l was
shown the grades by the company buyer.
2743. llaA r e you been able to get men to carry it out
in the same Avay? —Only sometimes.
2744. Hid you watch the process carefully all the
time ?—While the crop growm by Mr. McGee was being
harvested I Avas present the whole time it was being
handled and classified.
2745. Ho you consider yourself a fairly competent
grader?— Yes.
2746. You Avould be prepared to accept a price on
your oAvn grading?— Provided the grades were not
altered. Of course, the prices for the various grades
may change.


2747. Does the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany buyer comment on your grading when he comes
round ? —I would not say that he commented adversely;
he always treated me very fairly.
2748. Did he say that the grading could have been
(hme better? —Yes, he has said that. I realize that
if I grade badly I am the loser.
2749. Do you ever suffer from colour blindness in
your grading?—No; some people’s eyes fail, however.
2750. Have you improved in your grading?—l think
so.
2751. Are you getting a better colour? —I think so.
2752. What prices did you get last year?—ln 1927,
the average price was Is. B.Bld. per lb.; in 1928, there
were 38 bales which averaged Is. 6.64 d. per lb.
2753. You had only a small proportion of bright
tobacco?— During 1928, I was sick, and did not do the
grading.
2754. Do you consider the prices you received paid
you?—l would not say that tobacco-growing is not a
payable proposition, but, personally, I was handicapped
through sickness.
2755. Do you think with your present knowledge you
are likely to improve your percentage of light tobacco?
—Had it not been for the increase of the tariff I would
not have gone on with tobacco-growing. I could have
done better with something else.
2756. Do you think you will get a better percentage
in future?—l expect to.
2757. Were you ever unable to sell any of your
tobacco ?—Only two bales as far as I can remember
The company practically rejected my second last crop,
but I afterwards saw the Chairman of Directors, Mr,
Reading, in Sydney, and he arranged to take the tobacco
and have it graded there. He did not charge me for
grading.
2578. By Mr. Tully. —Would there be any justifica
tion for putting dark brown leaf and yellow leaf to-
gether when grading?— No.
2759. We have seen it mixed like that?—l have seen
Chinamen doing that sort of thing. I have sometimes
seen absolute muck gathered up and sent in. That sort
of thing has influenced the company in tightening up
on the growers.
2760. Do you know that the company has on hand
6| years’ supply of dark tobacco ?—Probably.
2761. By the Chairman. —Have you anything else to
add ?—I have here a pamphlet compiled by G. F.
Sutherland, and issued by the New South Wales Depart-
ment of Agriculture, showing the qualities of tobacco
grown in New South Wales from 1888 to 1892, together
with the quantity imported, and the quantity used. The

2762. Have you tried different varieties of tobacco?
—Yes, I have tried White Burley. I got the plants
from Sydney, and they were a failure.
2763. Have you done any experimenting besides to
try to defeat blue mould?—ln my opinion, the right
way to defeat blue mould is to choose the right spot to
grow your plants. Usually, excessive watering tends to
produce blue mould, and it depends upon the local
character of the soil whether or not the water sticks too
long, or whether it evaporates quickly. The worst kind
of soil to choose is that which adheres quickly to your
boots when it is wet.

The committee adjourned.
{Taken at Texas)
MONDAY, 17th FEBRUARY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully,
(Mr. C. L. Bentley, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd.; Mr. W.
Lennon, representing the tobacco-growers of
Texas.)
William Lennon, grazier, River Bend, Texas, was
called, sworn and examined.
2764. By the Chairman. —ls there a tobacco-
growers’ association here?— No.
2764 a. Do you wish to represent the tobacco-growers
of the Texas district?— This matter has been taken up
by the Chamber of Commerce in Texas. That is the
only public body we have that can deal with it. I am
president of the Chamber of Commerce, and have been
deputed to represent the tobacco-growers.
2765. Your Chamber of Commerce is a Queensland
body?— Yes, but it is a district association, and includes
residents both of New South Wales and Queensland.
2766. What do you mean when you say that the
Chamber of Commerce has taken this matter up?—
When we heard that the committee was coming here,
we held a meeting and decided on our course of
action.
2767. The Chamber of Commerce have organized
everything ?—Yes.
2768. Are you a tobacco-grower?— Yes.
2769. For how long have you been growing tobacco?
—The first crop was in 1910. I grew for five years.
2770. You were then growing under air-curing con-
ditions ?—Yes.
2771. What average area did you have under culti-
vation during those years?—ln 1909 I had 10£ acres
worked by two Chinese growers.
2772. Did you increase that area?— Yes. In 1910
the two men produced 12£ tons of tobacco off 10£ acres.
The next year the same area produced a ton to the
acre. In 1912 I had six growers on 35 acres, and
they were all Chinese. In 1913, I had four growers
on 23 acres, and in 1914 I had four growers on 20
acres. Then I knocked off, and did not grow any
more tobacco until last year, when I had a European
grower on an area of about 3 acres.
2773. When did you start again?—ln 1929. I grew
no tobacco from 1914 to 1929. It was really the 1928
crop, but it was sold in 1929. In 1929 we had four
growers on 12 acres. We had blue mould that year,
the first I have had in my experience.
2774. Did you have any mould from 1910 to 1914?
—On one occasion the Chinese said that the plants
were sick, and delayed the planting out, but in 1929 it
was very serious. We started off with 12 acres,
and the mould got into it. We finished up with about
6 acres of tobacco. Out of the four growers with


whom we began the season two gave it up and took up
other employment on the place, leaving the remainder
of the crop on terms with the other two.
2775. What did the 3 acres produce in 1928?
About 35 cwt. He was an inexperienced grower, and
was only experimenting. That crop was air-cured.
2776. Are you going to flue-cure your next crop?—
Yes. This is our first flue-cured crop. We have three
barns.
2777. How many labourers?—We have four.
2778. Your area has been reduced from 12 to 6
acres?— Yes. This has been our first contact with
blue mould.
2779. Going back to the period from 1910 to 1914,
what prices did you average? —In 1910 the price w T as
Bid., and the same in 1911. I did not average our
1912 crop, but I know that for one small parcel I got
Bd. per lb., and for another 7-|d. lb. In 1913 the average
price was Bd. per lb., and in 1914 it averaged 7d. per lb.
2780. So that for those five years average price was
about Bd.?—About that.
2781. What did you average in 1928?— For our air-
cured tobacco, about Is. per lb.
2782. Did most of your tobacco from 1910 to 1914
turn out dark?-—Yes, it was mostly dark. Of course,
it was all air-cured.
2783. In 1928 you averaged Is. per lb. for your
air-cured tobacco. What percentage of bright tobacco
did you have that year?—lt was all sold at the one
price, and I think there was about 50 per cent, bright.
2784. Did you include the bright mahogany?—lt
was as bright as it was possible to get air-cured tobacco.
2785. How do you account for the difference in the
price for the 1928 crop as against that of the earlier
crop?— Different types of leaf. The Chinese growers
in 1910 used to grow a very heavy leaf, and did not
seem to pay much attention to getting a bright colour.
They were interested only in weight.
2786. Did you irrigate?— Ho.
2787. What soil have you?— Alluvial.
2788. Are you still growing on the same soil?— Yes,
on the same class of soil, but we are now irrigating.
2789. Did you put in the irrigation plant especially
for tobacco?—Yes. It cost about £250.
2790. What did the barns cost?—l did not work it
out. We built them with our own labour, but they cost
about £7O a barn.
2791. What were they built of?— They were built of
heavy logs, and roofed over.
2792. Did they cost £7O without including your own
labour?—Ho, that is counting our own labour.
2793. How many other persons are growing tobacco
in the district at the present time?— Texas station and
Gunyan station; Ido not know of any other growers.
2794. When you were growing before, were there
many other growers operating?— Texas and Gunyan
stations have been growdng all the time, but there were
a good many others then also.
2795. How many?— There might have been three or
four others. In 1914 something happened to put me
out of growing, together with the rest of the small
growers.
2796. Would there have been a dozen growers at
that time?—l do not know, but there would have been
more than half a dozen. There might have been seven
or eight.
2797. By Mr. Morgan. —You mean that there were
a number of tenants growing for the Texas and
Gunyan stations? —Yes.
2798. By the Chairman. —You said that something
happened in 1914 which put you and some of the
other growers out of the business. What was that?—■
The buyers would not take all our leaf. We were told
by Mr. Gilmour that only two-thirds of all the tobacco
which brought less than 7£d. per lb. would be accepted.
Very little tobacco brought that price, and the rest
was left on our hands. We had the greatest difficulty
in disposing of it, but at last it was taken by the local
stemmery at a low price. Many growers were dissatisfied.
I had six growers that year on 35 acres. We pulled
the sheds down, and went out of the business.
2799. Did Bd. per lb. pay you then?— Yes, it paid
well.
2800. Did Is. per lb. pay you in 1928?—1t would
have paid, but I had an agreement with the grower
that he was experimenting. He was growing on his
own, and I did not get any of the proceeds.
2801. Was there much tobacco grown in Texas from
1914 to 1928?— Yes, the stations kept on all the time,
but nearly all the small men went out. We con-
sidered that we had a serious grievance, and we com-
plained to the company. The buyers said that they
had notified all the growers that they must reduce
their area, but they did not notify us.
2802. But other growers have told us that they were
notified?—We did not hear anything about it and kept
on growing, but the company took only a portion of
our crop.
2803. When the buyers came round, they said that
your tobacco was not worth 7|d, ?—They took about
only a quarter of the crop at 7^d.
2804. So this was the position in 1914: The buyer
told you that unless the leaf was worth it would
not be taken? —They would take two-thirds of all the
tobacco that was valued at less than per lb. The
rest was afterwards sold for about 7d. per lb. to the
stemmery.
2805. They told you that only a quarter was worth
?—Yes. They took a quarter of that, and two-thirds
of the rest at 7d., and left one-third on our hands.
2806. So that the statement that they would not
buy your tobacco was not correct? —It was our own
risk. The tobacco was left on our hands, and it was
our own responsibility to sell it. After a long time it
was sold. I know that some of the growers had gone to
China and returned again before the tobacco was sold.
2807. It did not pay you to continue growing?—Ho,
it did not pay me, and other growers went out also.
2808. Have you taken any interest in the industry
from 1914 to 1928?— Hot much.
2809. You did not keep in touch with what other
men were doing?— Ho.
2810. Did you go to other districts to see what w r as
being done there?— Ho. I had given the matter up
until this new movement was started to foster the in-
dustry. It was the fact that we knew this inquiry was
on foot, and that other steps were in contemplation to
foster the industry, that induced us to take it up again.
2811. When you discovered that the industry was
changing over from sun drying to flue-curing did you
get interested in it?— Yes. We became interested, and
started to erect barns because w T e thought we would get
a better price.
2812. Did you tell the company?— Ho.
2813. Did you tell the buyer you were starting to
grow again?— Yes, and we got very encouraging re-
plies. Young Mr. Gilmour w r as up here, and inter-
viewed my grower. Mr. Gilmour told him how to build
a barn, and said he w r ould send a man up and show
him how to cure.
2814. You are expecting that promise to be fulfilled?
-We are sure it will be.
2815. Do you know anything about flue-curing—Ho.
2816. Have you your eye on any likely curers ? —Yes,
1 saw Mr. Bryant in Tam worth, who told me that he
would come up and cure my tobacco if he was paid
for it.
2817. Do you think it would be better to do that than
to depend on the company’s representative teaching
you?—l think it would, but we were going to start in
such a small way that the company might have been


able to have given us the necessary instruction. Our
own man might then have been able to go on -with it.
2818. Do you not think it is placing the company
in rather an awkward position to announce that you
propose to go in for growing tobacco, contingent on its
providing you with expert assistance? —Of course we
are prepared to pay for expert assistance. If they
could not send their own expert, they might know of
somebody else who could do the work.
2819. Then you are not throwing yourself on the
company’s mercy. You only expect them to put you on
the right track? —That is so.
2820. Have you made any study of types of leaf,
and methods of cultivation for your 1930 crop?—No, I
have left that in the groAver’s hands, who is a Avhite
man.
2821. What does he think about it? —He has been in
touch with the company, and has obtained advice from
them as to Avhat kind of leaf to groAV. The company
is supplying him with seed.
2822. When do you start curing here ? —Ours Avill be
fit to start on in about a fortnight.
2823. Have you ready? —Not quite, but
they are working on the barns now.
2824. Have you been told by the company that
unless you produce bright leaf you are not likely to sell
it ?—Yes, they 1 told my groAver.
2825. Who told you that ?— I think it Avas Mr. Gil
tnour.
2826. Not Mr. Lough?—l am not sure Avhich of them
it was.
2827. It is clear to you that you must produce bright
leaf?— Yes.
2828. Did the company make any stipulation as to
hoAv much dark leaf they would buy? —No, I do not
think so.
2829. Suppose you produce 60 to 70 per cent, of dark
leaf, Avhat do you expect to happen?—We should look
upon it as our oavu fault if Ave do not produce Avhat the
buyer wants. We are prepared to take the risk.
2830. Have you made eA r ery effort to get the bright
leaf? —Yes. With such a small quantity of tobacco as
Ave are growing this year, Ave are not worrying so much,
but w T e are quite sure Ave can cure this small amount
thoroughly. If we grow a large quantity wo shall make
it our business to get the best curer Ave can. We shall
get a man from Tamworth or someAvhere else, and pay
him.
2831. Have you ever had any assistance from the
Noav South Wales tobacco experts?— No.
2832. Have you ever asked for any.—No.
2833. Have they been up here? —Yes, Mr. Tregenna
has been here, but I have never had anything to do
with him.
2834. Were you not sufficiently interested?— When I
had Chinese growers they Avould not take any notice
of what the experts said. Mr. Gilmour advised me once
not to allow the Chinese to grow “ Lax ”, Avhich is a
strong tobacco. I had one man who would persist in
growing it, and it always produced a good crop for
AAhich I got a good price, although Mr. Gilmour advised
us not to grow it. He used to grow a hardy tobacco,
but he took extra trouble to get a good colour.
2835. Although the experts have been here, you have
never taken any steps to confer Avith them? — No.
2836. Has your grower?— No. I did not have a
Avhite groAver when Mr. Tregenna Avas here. He has
been on my property, but I think it was before he held
his present position. I think it Avas Avhen he Avas
growing tobacco here himself. I know Mr. Tregenna
fairly well.
2837. Was it because he was Mr. Tregenna, or be-
cause he Avas an expert that you never bothered to get
into touch with him?— Because I had no confidence in
him as. an expert.
2838. You may have been wrong in that regard?—l
may have been, but I did not think he had made much
of a success of grorving tobacco himself.
2839. Did you base your opinion on Avhat you kneAV
of him yourself, or on Avhat you had heard? —On both,
2840. Have you ever written to the department for
literature?— No. My growers have obtained literature
and studied it, but I have ne\ T er gone in for it myself.
2841. All you know about tobacco-groAving is what
you have picked up?— Yes. I am busy on other things,
I am a sheep man, and my job is to look after sheep.
I haAm confidence in the man I have on as a tobacco
grower. Tobacco-groAAnng is only a small side-line
with us, but we intend to make it a big thing. If Ave
get encouragement Ave are going in for it extensively.
2842. In 1914, Avhen things went against you, you
threw it up?—We hope to get more buyers than one.
2843. If you get 2s. per lb. for your bright leaf, to-
gether with a bonus of Is., would that encourage you
sufficiently ?—lt would if we were confident that avp
could get a sufficiently high price to earn the bonus.
2844. Would it pay you if you got an average price
of Is. 9d. per lb. for all classes of leaf ?—-Probably, but
it Avould pay us better if Ave got a price sufficient to
earn the bonus. We might get within a Id. of the
price, and so miss the bonus.
2845. What steps are you taking to aA r oid that-?-—We
are hoping that the system will be altered; that the
bonus system will be done aAvay with and prices im-
proved.
2846. What steps are you taking to make a loav
price impossible to be offered you?— The only safe
thing is to a valuer independent of the buyer to
value the tobacco. We think Ave Avill a better
chance of getting the bonus then.
2847. But you could not make the company buy il
even then. If the valuer said the tobacco Avas Avorth
2s. per lb., and the company offered you only Is. 9d.
what A\ r ould you do ?—The same thing Avould happen as
in 1914.
2848. It is a matter of price, then, as to Avhether
you go on or not ?—Yes.
2849. You are not putting yourself up as an ex-
perienced tobacco man at all? —I am leaving that to
my tobacco grower.
2850. Is he an experienced man ?—No. He has had
no experience before this.
2851. Do you not think you are taking a risk? — -1
do not think so. We can groAV perhaps two or three
small crops, and by employing good curers Ave should
be able to get on all right. We can grow the tobacco
here, and all Ave shall have to do is employ curers.
2852. The point I am trying to make is this: You
expect the company to pay you a fair price for whal
you groAV although you are Avorking largely in the dark.
Then, if the company says that you have not produced
the right article, and therefore it cannot pay you 'what
you think you should get, you will go out of the in-
dustry altogether?—No, Ave av ill try to get the tobacco
up to the standard required, and if that cannot be done
we shall have to go out.
2853. Are you making sufficient alhnvance for the
fact that your crop this year is largely an experi-
mental one?— Yes.
2854. You hope to learn a lot as a result of this
year’s activity?— Yes. We are satisfied Ave can grow
the tobacco, and I think it is possible to get competent
men to cure it.
2855. Are your sons interested in this plan for groAV-
ing tobacco?—We work as a registered firm. We. arc
trading as William Lennon and Sons.
2856. Are they interested in the tobacco-growing?—
They are interested, but they are essentially sheep men.
The property is split up a good deal, and the'" five
about 15 to 18 miles from here.


2857. They are not taking steps to become flue-
curers ?—Ho.
2858. You have to add the cost of an expert curer to
the cost of producing the tobacco? —Yes.
2869. By Mr. Morgan. —Do the growers here realize
that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company has
already bought more dark tobacco in Australia than it
requires, and that it intends rigidly to restrict the
further purchase of daik tobacco?—l think so. I am
going into the business with the full knowledge of whal
that means to the growers.
2860. By Mr. Jones. —You say that if you receive
encouragement you will stay in the industry. What
encouragement do you want ? —We hope to see Aus-
tralia produce all the tobacco that Australia consumes.
We can produce good tobacco here; that has been
proved. We hope also that there v. ill he more buyers
in the market for our tobacco, and when several buyers
are competing against each other for our crops, they
■will perhaps take tobacco which is not being taken
now. They make take more dark tobacco, for instance.
2861. We were told that a sample of tobacco grown
at Tamworth was sent to the Imperial Institute in
London for an opinion. Did, any go from here? —A
man named Hammond Watt, of Ashford, sent a sample
of tobacco to the Chicago exhibition over twenty years
ago. It was flue-cured tobacco, and he was awarded a
gold medal for it.
2862. By the Chairman. —Have you seen that medal ?
—Ho, but I know it is all right. I heard a lot about it.
I think he obtained first prize in open competition with
American tobacco.
2863. You contend that tobacco can be grown here,
but shat it has not been properly cured?—l think that
is the trouble. The tobacco is of good quality, and
when we get paid according to results, it will be an
incentive to produce only the best.
2864. Concerning the samples to which I referred,
it was pointed out by the institute that the cause of such
defects- as existed was insufficient or unsatisfactory
curing?— Yes. I agree with that.
The witness withdrew
Horace Hocking Jennings, grazier and commission
agent, Texas, was called, sworn and examined.
2865. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco-grower:
Ho, not now.
2866. When were you growing? —l was growing for
the tobacco company from 1904 to 1920. I grew
tobacco, and conducted experiments all over Australia.
At that time I was in the employ of the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company.
2867. In what capacity?— First of all I was in the
old Cooper-street factory in Sydney. I had charge of
our domestic leaf operations for some time.
2868. Y r hat did you do after you left the factory.
Were you superintendent ? —Only of the colonial part.
2889. What position did you have after that?— Bu-
ying, and conducting experiments all over Australia.
2870. What sort of experiments?— Growing experi-
ments in different parts of Victoria, Queensland and
Hew South Wales.
2871. In what places?—On the Ovens River, at
Wangaratta, Bathurst, Tumut, Tamworth and here in
Texas. Also in different places on the north coast of
Queensland, including Proserpine, Caldwell, Coomera
and Cairns.
2872. You carried out experiments in all the present
tobacco areas, as well as in some that are spoken of
as likely areas ?—The company always had somebody
available to help the growers, and advise them regard-
ing seed selection, growing and curing. Ashford had
quite a lot of white growers in 1907, and produced quite
good tobacco. It was flue-cured even at that time.
There was quite a number of flue-curers there, and at
Tumut, Bathurst and Tamworth. Some Chinese tried
fine-curing, but it was never a success.
2873. What was the trouble with the Chinese?— They
could not understand the thermometers, the different
degrees of humidity, &c.
2874. When did you finish up with that work?—
I finished with the company about 1919 or 1920.
2875. Had you been carrying out those duties all
the time from 1905 to 1920 ? —I was connected with the
colonial side of the operations. For some time I was
here at the Texas stemmery, which was stated about
1908.
2875 a. Our evidence is to the effect that the stemmery
was operating from 1910 to 1915? —Hot the stemmery.
It was operating before the experimental area at
Raleigh was undertaken, and that w T as from 1910 to
1913. The tobacco stemmery w T as started about 1907.
2876. Were you manager of the stemmery?—Yes, off
and on when I resided here. The last two or three
years I resided here altogether.
2877. When did it close down? —-About 1918, I
think.
2878. By the Chairman. —lt was operating for about
ten years?— Thereabout.
2879. And all that time you were in charge of it? —•
Yes. I built it in the first place for the company..
2880. Can you tell us about that stemmery? We
have been told, subject to correction, that the company
went into the Texas stemmery enterprise, with the idea
of demonstrating whether it was possible to grow and
cure good tobacco in this district. They went to con-
siderable expense, and lost about £20,000, at the rate
of £3,000 a year. We have been told that they did
everything possible, but owing to blue mould and
seasonal conditions, together with labour difficulties,
they were losing money and were not even able to get
a decent class of leaf so that they had to close down.
Is that a fair statement of the position?— The stemmery
was first established at the suggestion of a man named
Fannan, who was brought out here by the company
from the United States of America. His theory was
that the mechanical re-drying of the leaf gave it
improved keeping qualities. He proposed to establish
this plant to try out his methods with Australian leaf.
We first of all put in a stick dryer, but it was not a
success, and we converted it to an apron dryer. After-
wards we discontinued drying in the leaf altogether,
and went in for stemming. That is why the stemmery
was erected here. I must say that it was not too much
of a success.
2SBI. What were the reasons ?—There was a number
of reasons. For one thing this is not America; there
is no other country in the world which can grow
American tobacco, just as there is no country other
than Cuba which can grow Cuban tobacco. You can-
not take any plant, which is not indigenous to the soil,
and expect it to grow as it does in its native country.
2882. Did you encounter seasonal difficulties?— Yes,
there were droughts, and the plants suffered from blue
mould.
2883. Would you say that blue mould was a fatal
factor in the affairs of the stemmery?—lt was fatal.
2884. By Mr. Jones. —What about the gold medal
which was won by local tobacco at the Chicago Exhibi-
tion?—l do not know anything about it. I do not
think that any local tobacco would win a first prize in
open competition with American tobacco. I think the
last exhibition in Chicago was in 1880, about 50 years
ago.
2885. Would not the winning of that award indicate
that decent tobacco can be grown here?—We can grow
good tobacco.
2886. By the Chairman. —What other factors con-
tributed to the failure of the stemmery?—The stemmery
had a capacity for five or six times the amount of leaf


we were handling. The local crop was dwindling every
year, while the overhead expenses remained the same.
Our production was only one-fifth or one-sixth of what
it should have been. It was a losing proposition from
the start.
2887. Was the leaf flue-cured ?—lt was all air-cured,
and was mostly grown by Chinese. The difficulty has
always been here to get the white man to grow tobacco.
3888. The company now has various grades of
mahogany, and mahogany as such is treated by it as
dark tobacco. What grades did you have when you
were with the company?— The bulk of what we were
handling then was dark tobacco, with a fair amount of
medium, light leaf. It would be just a fair-coloured
leaf.
2889. Hid you see any bright leaf? —In 1909 there
was plenty of bright leaf, and the 1905 crop was also
a good one. It is entirely a matter of seasonal con-
ditions. All the curing in the world will not give
you bright tobacco if you have not the right kind of
crop.
2890. How do you account for the fact that the bulk
of the air-cured tobacco w r as dark, but now that the
growers are going in for flue-curing, they are obtaining
a much greater percentage of light leaf?— They are
doing different things. They are _ planting more
thickly, and by this means are obtaining a better tex-
ture. Flue-curing Kelps to produce a better burning
mixture, and improves the aroma.
2891. Was the stemmery a rank failure?—l would
not call it that. It proved something; for instance, it
proved that most of the soil was not suitable, and
that it was useless to persevere with Chinese growers.
We shall never be able to obtain a suitable article
until we are able to get white men to grow it.
2892. Do you consider that now that white men are
coming into the industry again there will not be the
same difficulty in getting the right kind of leaf?—
Ho, provided the white growers were given sufficient in-
ducement.
2893. Do you think they would want £lOO an acre
profit? —It depends whether a man is growing on
tribute or straight out.
2894. That has nothing to do Avith the buyers?--
While we permit the importation of American leaf, the
Australia public will not buy much else. If we put
a duty of 10s. per lb. on American tobacco, the public
will very soon learn to smoke the Australian product.
Even if the Australian tobacco has a distinctive flavour,
there is no reason avliv Australians should not
come to like it. In Italy and France the people appre-
ciate the tobacco sold there; but if avc went there it
would kill us if we tried to smoke it.
2895. Have you smoked South African tobacco? —
Yes, during the war; before Rhodesia starting growing
at all.
2896. Hoav does Australian tobacco compare with it?
—Unfavorably, I seen plenty of South African
tobacco since then.
2897. Here is some “Waratah” tobacco produced
from Australian leaf in Australia. Does it, on
appearance, seem to you to he a reasonably good
tobacco? —It looks all right.
2898. If it were not possible to get American tobacco
do you think the Australian public would get used to
this “Waratah” tobacco? —I think so.
2899. Here are some samples of plug tobacco Avhich
sold fairly well in Melbourne. They are made from
Australian leaf, and one of them has an American
wrapper?— One of these samples, the one without the
American wrapper, does not cut with much eye, and
it would probably smoke fairly rank.
2900. What do you mean by rank ?-— OffensiA r e to the
taste.
2901. What about the other sample, the one with
the American wrapper ? Would you say that if a man
were hard pushed for a smoke he would regard that as
satisfactory? —After a while, when his palate became
accustomed to it, he would like it all right.
2902. Here is a sample of “ Sunday Best ” tobacco,
another Australian brand. What do you think of it ?
—We are not likely to get any colonial tobacco to stand
out with that fine bright eye which characterizes the
American leaf; but I could smoke this tobacco if I
had to. It is quite a good tobacco.
2903. Here is a tin of “ Signet ” tobacco, a blend
of half American and half Australian leaf. What do
you think of it?— Years ago this was quite a good
seller when the public taste did not mind dark
tobacco.
2904. Would you say, from appearance and smell,
that it is quite a good tobacco ?—Possibly. It is all a
matter of palate. One man will smoke Turkish cigar-
ettes, and another will not.
2905. Is it not a fact that for the most part, when
the public asks for tobacco, they are given American
tobacco, and do not get a chance of coming in contact
with the Australian brand? If they want it they have
to go looking for it?—l do not think that there is any
doubt that American tobacco is better than ours.
2906. What is the difference between “ Havelock ”
and “Waratah” tobacco?—lf you put them side by
side you can see the difference immediately. There
is a difference in the brightness of the eye, and a
difference also in the coolness of the smoke.
2907. Personally, I could not tell one from the other.
Do you contend that it takes an expert to tell the
difference?—l do not think so.
2908. Do you think that if “ Waratah ” tobacco were
put in “ Havelock ” tins the public would know the
difference? —-I think the public would. However, it is
all a matter of taste. The average Australian cannot
smoke the tobacco sold in England until he becomes
used to it. The reason is that the dressing put on the
tobacco is different, although both the English tobaccoes
and the majority of that sold in Australia are made
from American leaf. French tobacco is different again,
but one can get used to it.
2909. What about South African tobacco? — That is
different again, but it is the nearest to American
tobacco of any grown outside America.
2910. Your argument is this: The Australian public
have been educated to smoke American tobacco; but
if they could not get it they could, Avithout great diffi-
culty, be educated to smoke Australian tobacco ?—That
is my opinion entirely.
2911. Have you conducted any experiments with
Australian leaf to determine its smoking qualities?—
Yes, Avith both sun and flue-cured leaf.
2912. Hoav were the experiments carried out?—
Generally, when one is preparing an Australian sample
for manufacture one does not pick the Avorst leaf. It
is, perhaps, a bit above the average. We have picked
cigarette tobacco, cut it, and packed it in air-tight tins,
and smoked it when it is fairly ucaa 7 , and again Avhen
it is fairly old. It goes through the ordinary course of
manufacture.
2913. We were told that, in carrying out such tests,
the judges used just the ordinary leaf. That they
merely chopped up the raw leaf and smoked it. That
Avas when they Avere testing for aroma. Do you think
that is a fair test?—lf you are comparing it Avith
American leaf treated in the same way it is fair.
2914. What is your opinion of the existing tobacco
lands with which you are familiar ? Do you think they
are hopeless from a tobacco-producing point of view?
—lt all depends on what standard is set.
2915. The Australian brands of tobacco which I
have shoAA r n you have been manufactured from leaf
grown on the present tobacco-producing lands. Do


you think it is necessary to set a much higher standard
than is represented by these tobaccoes in order to
appeal to the Australian palate?—lt is just a matter
of cultivating the Australian palate up, or of cultivat-
ing it down. In recent years it has been cultivated up.
We have been getting the finest quality of American
leaf produced.
3916. Are you familiar with the “ Edgeworth”
brand, which is a Burley tobacco? —I do not think
that there is much of it sold here.
3917. We have been told that a lot of it has been
sold? — I believe the nearest approach to American
tobacco grown in Australia is Burley; but the trouble
is that all the pests settle on it. Many people will not
smoke it, however. It is a matter of taste.
2918. Do you think it is a fair contention that we
must rule out all present tobacco-growing lands in
Australia, and look for new country?—lSTo. The first
thing is systematic research, which should be con-
ducted by the Government, not by the company.
3919. Do you think that Texas soil can produce
good, bright tobacco? —Yes, I was favorably impressed
with it.
2920. What percentage of bright leaf was there? —
I cannot say.
2921. Here is a newspaper paragraph dealing with
a recent return from a crop of tobacco grown in this
district. It is from the Melbourne Age of 10th
January, 1930, and is as follows; —
PROFITABLE TOBACCO CROP.
Return of £233 an Acre.
Brisbane, January 9.
Proceeds of sales of tobacco from an area of about 7 acres
grown at Gunyan, near Stanthorpe, just finalized, show a
gross return of £1,631 Is. Bd. The leaf was flue-cured, and
yielded 11,346 lb. It was sold at an average price of 2s. lOd,
per lb., or £233 an acre. The tobacco was grown by J.
Matchetti and his brother, and it gave them a net return
of £1,075.
If the cost of production is the same here as in other
districts that would yield a profit of £133 an acre?—
Probably.
2922. In Tamworth the average yield is a ton to the
acre? —If an experimental station were established by
the Government it would help. I do not think that
sufficient attention has been paid to fertilizing.
2923. Mr. McGee carried out experiments in Manilla
with fertilizers a little while ago, and samples of the
crop he produced were sent to the Imperial Institute
in London, which pronounced the leaf to be poor stuff,
and commercially valueless. What have you to say
about that?— About 1907 the company sent a sample of
tobacco grown in the Tumut district for sale in London.
The price realized was a long wmy below T what we paid
for it here. Our tobacco has always brought above
world’s parity prices. Neither the Imperial Institute
or any other authority is justified in saying that our
tobacco is worthless.
2924. Mr. Tregenna says that the institute’s opinion
must be respected?—lf the tobacco was a fair article
out here, how could it be rendered commercially worth-
less because it was sent to London.
2925. By Mr. Martens.— Would the English judges
judge it according to the standard of tobacco appre-
ciated in England?— They would have no other basis
on which to judge it. They would not base their judg-
ment on a chemical analysis.
2926. By the Chairman. —We learned that the judg-
ment of the institute represented a trade report ?
There are different kinds of trade reports; for instance,
the sample might be sent for judgment to Liverpool,
where the shipping trade is catered for. In that caae
it would be judged on a different standard from that
of Bristol.
2927. Have you a good knowledge of “ Gunyan ”
tobacco? —I have seen their leaf.
3938. Do you think the quality is improving?—
Decidedly.
3939. Would you say the results obtained there are
very promising?— They are.
3930. Do you consider that this is economically a
white man’s industry?—l do not know. It is rather
a hard question to answer. Tobacco is a most pre-
carious crop. If a white man grows it, and grows
tobacco only, he must come to grief. For years I
preached that tobacco should be grown in conjunction
with other crops. In America one rarely finds a farm
devoted to tobacco alone. The farmer grows cotton or
corn, or goes in for hogs as well. His season there is
practically assured. He has no drought, and no blue
mould. All he has to contend with are the ordinary
insect pests.
3931. Would you say that an average of 2s. per lb.
all round for all grades would be a fair price?—l
should not like to say that. It is just a matter of
seasons and cost of production.
2933. Do you think that the Australian grower,
having regard to seasonal difficulties and local costs
of production, &c., is entitled to a higher price than,
say, the American grower?— l suppose if we want to
build up the tobacco industry here in the same way
as we built up the sugar industry we must make the
Australian public pay for it.
2933. Do you think it is a matter of making them
pay for it?—lf they want to smoke they will pay for
it.
2934. It has been suggested that the best way of get-
ting the Australian public to smoke Australian tobacco
is practically to force the manufacturers to put it on
the market, and advertise it at a price that will appeal
to the public. The company has given an assurance
that Waratah tobacco was well advertised. That sales
were good for a year or two, and then fell away. Do
you think it would be a fair thing to make the induce-
ment so strong that the public would have no alter-
native but to buy the Australian tobacco? —I think it
is the only solution.
2935. How would you do it? — By increasing the
import duty on American leaf on a sliding scale. As
the Australian growers increased their output, increase
the import duty correspondingly, and also increase the
excise unless you are prepared to lose a lot of revenue.
2936. By Mr. Morgan. — That is coercing the con-
suming public?—lf you are prepared to reduce your
tobacco duties, both colonial and American, by ss. or
6s. a lb., well and good.
2937. By the Chairman. —Do you think it would be
a good thing to leave the import duty at 35., plus an
excise duty of 2s. 4d. on American leaf and abolish the
excise duty altogether on Australian leaf? — l do not
think it would make much difference in the amount of
Australian tobacco smoked. The difference would not
be large enough.
2938. There would be a difference of 6s. 4d. per lb.?
— I think the public w r ould still pay it.
2939. Do you think that if Waratah tobacco were
sold at ss. 4d. per lb. less than American tobacco the
Australian public would still refuse to smoke it?—ln
the first place there are not many people smoking that
kind of tobacco, though a lot of it is made into
cigarettes, especially in the bush. I think that even
with the difference of ss. 4d. per lb. in favour of Aus-
tralian tobacco there would not be any appreciable
difference in the consumption of American tobacco,
and there would be a serious loss of revenue.
2940. By Mr. Jones. —Do you know the result of
the increase of duty on imported spirits?— The public
are coming back to colonial spirits.
3941. By the Chairman. —If you could put Aus-
tralian tobacco on the market at half the price of the
American tobacco would that be an inducement to the


public to buy ?—Yes, but I do not think it would make
any great difference in the amount of Australian
tobacco consumed.
2942. Would it not make a difference to workmen?
—Yes, in bad times, but not in good.
2943. At the present time you have to pay Is. 7d. or
Is. Bd. for a 2oz. tin of Champion tobacco; that is
about the best on the market. If it were possible to
buy W aratah at lid. or Is. a tin do you not think it
would be an inducement to a man who has not much
money to buy the Waratah tobacco? —Yes, in bad
times. In the old days we used to make a lot of
colonial tobacco. During strikes, and times of de-
pression, a lot of colonial tobacco was bought, but in
good times the sales dropped off.
2944. But do you not think that the colonial tobacco
now r is much better than what was sold in the old
days?— There was some good, bright tobacco produced
in the old days as well.
2945. Your opinion is that you have practically to
prohibit the importation of American tobacco in order
to make the public smoke the Australian product?—-
That is what they have had to do in other countries.
2946. Do you think it would be a sound economic
step to take such drastic action ?—lt is no more drastic
than the action taken in regard to sugar.
2947. Sugar is a necessity, tobacco is a luxury?—
That is a matter of opinion.
2948. Economically, sugar is a vital necessity to
the country; from tobacco we receive a revenue of
£7,500,000 a year?—That is an off-set against the value
of the leaf coming in.
2949. If we prohibit the importation of American
tobacco we must make up that amount of revenue. Do
you think it is worth while taking such an extreme
step just to be able to say that we have a self-contained
tobacco industry ?—I should not like to say that.
2950. If a war were to break out, and our supplies
from overseas were cut off in a night, do you think that
the demand for tobacco would be so insistent that almost
any measure would be justifiable in order to ensure
our tobacco supplies'?—l should not like to answer that.
It is a matter for the public to decide whether the
country can forego £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 a year in
revenue so that the Australian tobacco-grower may take
it.
2951. Is it worth while to put many more growers
on the land, and assist those already there, to produce
tobacco as a measure of national protection? Also, is
it worth while to safeguard the country against the
cutting off of supplies of foreign tobacco?—We are
essentially a primary producing country, and our
secondary industries never will be of much consequence.
Therefore any primary industry which can be sup-
ported in a reasonable way is worth supporting.
2952. Of course the market is growing all the time
with the increase in population, but suppose it were
limited to £3,000,000 a year, would it be worth while
to take such steps as you recommend to foster the local
industry?—l think any primary industry is worth
while.
2953. Do you think that, allowing for the poor
smoking qualities of Australian tobacco of which you
have spoken, it would be worth while taking the neces-
sary steps to preserve that £3,000,000 for distribution
among Australian growers?— Yes.
2954. Although you might thereby be inflicting a
hardship on the consumers?—l do not think it would
be a hardship. In a few years the Australian smoker
would not like any other sort of tobacco. However,
anything done without a proper scientific backing
would be fatal. The Commonwealth Government, not
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, should es-
tablish experimental stations and conduct them on
scientific lines. I do not know who was responsible
for starting the story about a eucalyptus taint, but I
think it is rubbish. The Government should establish
held bureaux, and also a central bureau.
3955. By Mr. Martens. —On somewhat the same lines
as have been done in connexion with [he sugar industry?
-—Yes, or as has been done with regard to tobacco in
America, if a crop is worth encouraging at all it is
worth do mg in the proper way.
2950. Nothing explicit in regard to that alleged
eucalyptus taint has been put before use? —It is admit-
ted, I think, that our tobaccoes are grown on heavy soil,
with too much nitrogen content, and where that pre-
vails you will get heavy burning qualities.
2957. It appears that the tobacco growing industry
is virtually confined to river plants because of climatic
conditions? —it is a matter of breaking down the soil
and conserving moisture.
2958. Are you in favour of the establishment of a
permanent federal tobacco investigation committee?—
Such a body could deal with other things besides
tobacco.
2959. We have brought a man from America to deal
with this subject, and his term has almost expired. Do
you think he should be retained for, say, a period of
ten years? —I think it is very hard luck if we cannot
get an Australian-born scientist to do the work. An
.American who comes hero has to spend a considerable
time becoming acquainted with the local conditions.
2960. America has had 300 years’ experience in
growing tobacco? —Not from a scientific point of
view.
2961. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you think the research
work should be in the hands of the Federal Govern-
ment, and the experimental work in the hands of the
States?—l think the whole thing should be in the
hands of the Federal Government.
2962. Do you think the State departments have
materially helped the industry?—lt did in Queens-
land many years ago.
2963. By the Chairman. —Apparently it helped the
industry so much that there is no tobacco grown in
Queensland to-day?— When old Mr. Nevill was there
very good work was done.
2964. And what about New South Wales?—l think
the work of the department there has been negligible.
We have not had men with the necessary qualifications.
Any one can grow tobacco, but it is the selection of
seed, and the building up of the soil that counts. Our
universities are turning out men every day who should
be suitable for this work.
2965. Mr. Tregenna secured a position on the
strength of four years as a grower in Bhodesia. Do
you know anything about his experience here ? —Before
he became an expert he was growing tobacco at Ingle-
wood. The bulk of the investigation work in Aus-
tralia has been done by the British-Australasian
T obacco Company,
2966. Do you think that if the company had not
given the growers some expert help there would have
been no tobacco? —There would not have been a pound
of tobacco produced. Much good cigar leaf has been
grown right up the Queensland coast at Coomera,
Proserpine and Cairns.
2967. By Mr. Morgan. —What do you think of North
Queensland as a tobacco-growing district?—l do not
think the coastal areas are su table for light tobaccoes.
2968. What about the tablelands?—l do not know
enough about them to say, but I see no reason why they
should not be suitable.
2969. You said that you favoured the experimental
work being done by the Government; but you also said
that the company had done the work very well? —It is
not a job for the company; the responsibility should
be on the Government.


2970. By the Chairman. —But if the company prac-
tically insists on contributing as an evidence of its
great" desire to help the industry you would not dis-
courage it? — Mo. They have experts to deal with the
leaf after it leaves the 'growers. They are very neces-
sary, and the industry could not get on without them.
2971. By Mr. Morgan. —You referred to the differ-
ence between the dressing put on manufactured tobacco
in England and that put on the tobacco on sale here.
Is there any essential difference? —There is a big dif-
ference. The English tobaccoes are manufactured in an
entirely different way. Practically every country has
a different manufacturing process. In France they
just throw the leaf in huge piles, and put it through a
sweat. The result is that it all comes out perfectly
black, and it all smokes the same.
2972. By Mr. Martens.—Rave you been through the
areas in Queensland in which tobacco has been grown?
■ —Yes, some years ago.
2973. What area -would you suggest is the most
likely place for growing tobacco in Queensland? —The
company conducted some experiments at Cairns, and
grew good tobacco, Bowen also produced a good
quality leaf. Nearly all those places grew excellent
cigar leaf, not wrapper leaf as a rule, although some
good wrapper leaf was grown. The leaf was quite
good as a filler, however.
2974. Did they continue growing tobacco? —The leaf
contracted a disease called mosaic. It is a bacteria,
not a fungoid, and can be controlled. The growers
also complained about the price received, but the price
was not too bad. They received as high as 2s. 6d per
lb. for some of their leaf. The trouble was that they
cased it badly, and sent it down in bad condition.
2975. Are you aw r are that those growers went in
afterwards for other crops that pay them better? —Yes,
they grow tomatoes, peanuts, &c. I think there are
great possibilities for tobacco, however. The
trouble is that the market for cigars is limited.
2976. By Mr. Jones. —Do you think that there is any
hope of improving the quality and increasing the
quantity of Australian-grown leaf to such an extent
that the greater part of the leaf manufactured here
will ultimately be Australian grown?— Why should
there not?
2977. You said that some of the growers were flue-
curing in 1907?— Yes. Some of them w 7 ere flue-curing
in 1903.
2978. From 1908 until 1918, the period during which
the stemmery was operating, was the leaf all air-cured?
—Practically all.
2979. What sort o fcrops were they on the whole?
Were they good?— The crops fluctuated according to
the seasons. The 1905 crop was easily the best grown
in Texas; the best, I should say, ever grown in Aus-
tralia. There was a wonderful percentage of bright
leaf in that. Texas produced 500 tons that year.
2980. By the Chairman. —The company did not
grow any tobacco then? —No.
2381. By Mr. Martens. —There were three companies
operating then? —Yes.
2882. By the Chairman. —Do you think that tobacco
growing is deserving of a further trial in this district?
Yes. I would not rule it out altogether. As regards
the failure of the stemmery, I think it would have failed
had it been anywhere else.
2983. By Mr. Jones. —Do you think that the tobacco
produced at Gunyan is of good quality?— Yes.
2984. Have you heard the story of the hawker who
was going through the country selling American and
Australian tobacco. The American tobacco w T as being
sold at Ss. per lb., and the other at 3s. per lb. When
all the American tobacco at Bs. per lb. had been sold
he filled up the American box with Australian leaf
and continued to sell that at Bs. per lb. Do you think
there is a prejudice against Australian tobacco? —I
do not think the majority of people know what they are
buying.
2985. By the Chairman. —Do you think that the cir-
culation of that story about eucalyptus taint did the
industry much damage? —It would bring the industry
into disrepute.
2986. Do you think it would tend to give the growers
the idea that the industry was hopeless?—l do not
think so.
2987. By Mr. Jones. —Would you favour an increase
in the import duty on tobacco?—l would bump it
well up.
2988. The tobacco industry in France is controlled
by a monopoly w r hich yields the Government
£20,000,000 a year. Do you think w T e could do some-
thing like that here?—-In France the Government
farms out the tobacco shops to certain people instead
of paying them pensions. I am dead against govern-
ment control of marketing.
2989. You think the outlook of the industry is hope-
ful?— Yes, with proper backing and scientific research.
2990. By the Chairman.— You said , that you were
in favour of putting a stiff import duty on American
tobacco, but we are not yet growing enough tobacco
to supply our own needs? —The first thing is to formu-
late a scheme. As the supplies increase, so the import
duty could be raised.
2991. The company says that it is prepared to buy
ten or fifteen times as much locally-grown bright
tobacco as is being produced. If another 2s. per lb.
duty were put on, it would increase the price of
American tobacco to the consumer?—l think it would
increase the sale of Australian dark tobacco.
2992. We are looking for a less drastic method than
that ?—Do you think it is drastic ?
2992 a. I think so. Personally, I would give up
smoking to-morrow if I had to go back to dark tobacco ?
—lf it were toned down by fermentation it would make
a great difference.
2993. By Mr. Jones. —lf a heavy import duty were
put on, then those who made up the revenue would be
those who preferred to smoke the imported tobacco in
preference to Australian?— Yes; if you want to smoke
a Corona cigar to-day you have to pay for it. If you
want a good smoke at a lower price you buy a
Monopole.
2994. By Mr. Lennon. —Do you think that if the
stemmery here had been smaller, and had been handling
flue-cured tobacco, it might have succeeeded?—l think
it would have, but it was impossible at that time to
get a smaller machine. The one we had cost over
£2,000. We hoped that the industry would growq and
that w r e should be able to use the machine to its full
capacity, but blue mould and other causes retarded
development.
2995. Were the company’s growing operations at
Raleigh discontinued because it w T as found impossible
to produce a good quality of leaf, or because the
crops were bad?— Raleigh was started to demonstrate
the suitability of the Texas district, and, incidentally,
of Australia generally for growing tobacco. We
attempted to grow tobacco there on the plantation
system. That was the main cause of the downfall of
Raleigh. It is impossible to carry on an industry
of that kind in Australia on the plantation system,
which is the employment of men on wages.
2996. What area did you have?—s6o acres. Most
of our employees were brought from England, and
they w ? ere not competent.
2997. What class of men -were they, labourers?—
Yes, labourers, but not agricultural labourers. The
British Migration League superintended the despatch
of these men from England. They were mostly
married men from the cities.


2998. By the Chairman.-— What were some of their
previous occupations? —Dock labourers, lorry drivers,
&c. We had 100 or more of them at different times.
2999. Did the company pay their expenses out here?
—I am not sure.
3000. And the league selected the men? —They were
supposed to select them.
3001. I do not suppose that the company deliberately
asked for dock labourers to grow tobacco?—l do not
think so.
3002. What other classes of men did you have?—
They were mostly from the cities. Not 5 per cent,
were agricultural labourers.
3003. How did those men take to the job out here ?
—They did not take to it at all. They used to last
two or three months and then go.
3004. Did you have any supervision over them ?
I was in direct supervision over them.
3005. Were they difficult men to handle? —1 should
not like to have another lot like them. They were
absolutely impossible. On one occasion I sent a man
for a tomahawk and he brought me back a wedge,
an ordinary splitting wedge.
3006, That would be due to ignorance?— Yes, but
it took a long time to teach them. They did the
actual work of growing. Besides them I had a few
good colonials.
3007. By Mr. Morgan. —To what extent was the
soil a factor in the failure of Raleigh?-—lt had nothing
whatever to do with it.
3008. By the Chairman. —You had about .100 of
these labourers?— Not at one time. We had a maxi-
mum of about 30 labourers at a time. We had 24
cottages. We were growing on the same land as the
Gunyan Station.
3009. Did the Raleigh experiment have much to do
with the downfall of the stemmery?—lndirectly it did.
We could not get the quantity or quality of leaf.
3010. Do you think that if you had had suitable
agricultural labourers you would have done better? —
I am doubtful whether Ave could have succeeded on
the plantation system.
3011. Did you give the men a home? —Yes, together
with so much per week, and whatever other allowances
were agreed upon.
3012. Did you provide them with food? —No.
3013. Did you fix their hours? —It is impossible to
fix hours at tobacco-growing. The hours AA 7 ere too
long, I admit, being from fourteen to fifteen hours a
day. That was for six months in the year. It was not
laborious work, but the men had to be on the job.
3014. If you had not adopted the plantation system
would the experiments have been a success? —I think
so. Had avc got good agriculturalists, and put them
on tribute, alloAving them to use our irrigation plant,
and giving them expert advice in curing and grading,
I think it Avould have been successful.
3015. Surely the company became quickly aware that
the experiment had little chance of success on the
lines it Avas folknAung?—We had blue mould one year
which wiped us right out. As a business proposition
it was hopeless. Aftemvards avc employed colonials.
3016. Did thej 7 do any good? —They did better.
We had 140 acres one year, but got 8 inches of rain
one night which washed the Avhole lot away. EA 7 en
part of the irrigation plant went.
3017. By Mr. Lennon. —Another of your troubles
Avas that you had an epidemic of typhoid?— Yes, that
was an incidental. We got a carrier off one of the
ships. I had to establish a hospital, and I helped bury
five of them myself. There were 28 cases altogether.
3018. By the Chairman. —Do you wish to add any-
thing to your statement? —I should like to stress the
necessity of getting a scientific man to study tobacco
production, and to pay him well. On one occasion the
New South Wales Government asked me, when I was
about to visit the United States of America, to engage
a scientist for them at a salary of £3OO a year. That
was when H. 0. L. Anderson was Under-Secretary for
Agriculture.
3019. Just what did they ask you to do? —To get a
scientific man, and an expert combined, for £3OO a
year. That was before the war.
3020. Did you make any attempt to get the man? —
.No, I did not.
The witness withdrew
Herbert Fraser Elywn, formerly manager of Gunyan,
Station, Texas, was called, sworn and examined.
3021. By the Chairman. —Where do you live? —I
reside in Sydney at the present time.
3022. Are you a tobacco-grower?—l was managing
Gunyan Station from 1886 to 1926, and was growing
tobacco there for 36 years on behalf of my principals.
3023. Will you tell us something about the industry
here?— The first grower here was a man named
McPhillips, who took up country in 1886 and grew
tobacco. He took his leaf to Brisbane, where at that
time there were three buyers, Cameron, Dixon and Back-
house. The buyers liked his leaf, and told him it was
infinitely better than what had been coming to them
from other growers. They gave him a good price for
it. On the strength of that, other growers started.
Mr. Fleming started shortly after that, and I began
growing in 1890. Others shortly followed suit.
3024. How many people have been growing tobacco
here at any one time ?—The greatest quantity of tobacco
ever grown in the district was in 1906, when 550 tons
were produced. That was all sun-dried. It was not
only a very large crop, but a particularly good crop
as well. In the early days only two varieties tof
tobacco were grown, Shoestring and Broad Dutch.
They were big, coarse, dark varieties that would have
no commercial value at all now. That was during
the period from 1886 to federation. In those days the
first buyer who come along the river and bought a
crop established the price for the season. Messrs.
Cameron, who were the biggest buyers, went out of
their way to buy the heaviest and darkest leaf. They
did not want bright leaf, because the public taste at
that time Avas for a heavy, dark, strong tobacco. The
favourite tobaccoes then were Negro Head, Derby and
tobaccoes of that sort.
3025. Things haA 7 e changed since then?— The public
taste has changed altogether. Whether the manufac-
turers began the fashion by introducing lighter tobacco,
or Avhether they had to supply the lighter tobacco in
ans Aver to public demand, 1 do not know.
3026. Have you had any experience of growing
tobacco under the new conditions?—l have had no
experience of flue-curing, but I have seen a lot of
flue-cured tobacco. About the middle of the nineties’
avc began experimenting with other varieties. We
tried Lax, Hester, Yellow Pryor, Blue Pryor, Burley,
and other varieties. About that time the Queensland
Government engaged as tobacco expert Mr. Neville, an
American, avlio practically lived here. We were
gradually changing over to a brighter leaf. We were
not getting the same Aveight, but we were getting better
quality.
3027. Did you get better prices?— Prices were never
very much until the AA 7 ar. Up to the time of federation
the biggest price I ever got was Bd. per lb. That was
when there Avere only Brisbane buyers.
3028. What do you think of the quality of flue-cured
leaf as compared Avith the old sun-dried tobacco ?—I
think the improvement is mar\ 7 ellous. There is no com-
parison Avhatever.


3029. And as compared with the sun-dried tobacco of
a few years ago ?—The due-curing of leaf undoubtedly
improves the value.
3030. You are speaking of the Texas district? —Yes.
I used to buy tobacco for Dixon from Warwick, and
other districts. All those places have now gone out of
tobacco growing. On one occasion I bought 100 tons of
tobacco at Warwick for per lb.
3031. By Mr. Morgan. —That was Killarney grown
stuff? —Yes, I think it went into the Kanaka trade.
3032. By the Chairman. —What do you think of
Chinamen as tobacco growers?— They are good toilers.
They have hearts like lions and they are good tobacco
growers, but that is all you can say of them. They are
absolutely useless at flue-curing, and they are very
stupid at grading. Ido not think they would be of the
slightest use growing tobacco for flue-curing.
3033. If flue-curing is to continue the Chinese must
get out?— Yes. In any case we cannot get Chinamen
now. All those we had are growing old, and no new
ones are taking their places.
3034. Even if you could get them you would not take
them?— Ho.
3035. Have you had much experience with white
labour in the industry?—l have had some, but my ex-
perience is that white men will work hard for eight
of nine hours, but are not satisfied to keep on at light
work for fourteen or fifteen hours a day. I cannot
blame them for that.
3036. Have you noticed that the white men are very
keen about the industry?— Yes; some of those now en-
gaged in flue-curing will make good, I am sure.
3037. Do you think that Gunyan made a profit out
of its tobacco enterprise?—We did well, one year with
another. We were the biggest growers in Australia for
a good many years. I had 47 Chinamen growing at
one time.
3038. How long ago was that?— About fifteen years
ago.
3039. Gunyan should have accumulated a fair
amount of experience in tobacco growing?—We did. I
maintain that the two greatest enemies are hail and
grubs, not blue-mould.
3040. You did not have much experience of blue-
mould here in your time?—We had a good deal of blue-
mould, but it came only about once in three years. It
never wiped us out altogether. It probably meant that
we lost our beds planted out in the spring, but the later
plants very rarely got blue-mould.
3041. Do you think the prices now obtained for flue-
cured leaf compare favorably with the prices of the
old sun-dried leaf ?—The prices are higher, but of
course it costs more to produce the tobacco.
_ 3042. Do you think the present prices are sufficiently
high to justify growers remaining in the industry?—
Yes, I think that 2s. per lb. should show a profit, but I
understand that the buyer will take only bright leaf. A
tremendous lot of the tobacco grown is mahogany, and
mahogany is a most elastic term, covering anything
from nearly jet black to yellow. It is new 7 s to me to
learn that all mahogany is now being classed as dark.
Some of the Ho. 1 mahogany is almost yellow.
3043. Mr. Bentley. —Bright mahogany is paid for as
bright tobacco.
3044. By the Chairman. —There are very few
persons growing tobacco here now?— Fewer than there
have been. Most of the Chinamen have gone, and very
few have taken their places.
3045. By Mr. Jones.—hi round figures what would
you say w 7 as the cost of irrigating and flue-curing
tobacco ?—I cannot say. I was working under different
conditions. The cost of irrigation depends entirely
on the season, A 6-inch pump wall put three inches of
water on four acres of ground in a day. Such a pump
will irrigate four men’s tobacco comfortably in a week.
F. 218 —13.
3046. Would £lOO a ton cover the cost of production ?
—I should think so.
3047. By the Chairman. —And if you made £lOO an
acre profit you would be satisfied ?—Yes.
3048. But if you had only one good season in three ?
I should not be satisfied then, but we get more than one
good season in three here.
3049. Would £5O an acre profit, year in year out, pay
you ?—lt might, but it has to be remembered that there
is a good deal of capital sunk in a present-day tobacco
farm, in such things as sheds, barns, irrigation plant,
land, &c.
3050. Do you think there would be any difficulty in
getting labour apart from Chinese ?—I do not think so
There is plenty of unemployment at the present time.
3051. You heard Mr. Jenning’s evidence about his
labour troubles with the Raleigh experiments ?—-If
ever there was an enterprise that was dogged with mis-
fortune that one was. The men could not work, and
did not. The tobacco got blue-mould. They put in the
-Noonan system of irrigation and they pumped the hole
dry in the river. They cut a channel to another hole
and pumped that one dry, too. Then they got a cyclone
that wiped out the whole crop, and on top of that they
had an epidemic of typhoid. It was anything but a fan-
test.
3052. Do you think that a similar experiment to-day
might be a success?— Hot under the plantation system
3053. Do you think that was the cardinal mistake ?
—I am sure it was. That, and getting the wrong class
of labour. You must give a man an incentive to work
long hours at cultivating tobacco.
2054. By Mr. Martens. —ls the tobacco being grown
on Gunyan Station now by white growers?— Yes. I
think they are growing on the share system with the
owners. There are no Chinese growers on the river
now. In my time all the tobacco was grown by Chinese.
The witness withdrew.
Wylde Howes McMaster, of Runnymede,
Texas, was called, sworn and examined.
3055. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco grower (
Hot now 7 , but I have recently been interested in tobacco
through my association with Gunyan. lam now a
grazier. I occupied the position of manager of Gunyan
for four years, from 1926 to the end of 1929.
3056. During that period did you grow any tobacco
for the company?— Yes.
3057. Can you tell us anything about it ?—Tobacco
was being grown wffien I w 7 ent there. There were twelve
Chinese on 95 acres, and they were growing sun-dried
tobacco. They were not doing any good, and the
company decided to grow 7 tobacco on some other system.
It w r as necessary to make an alteration from air-curing
to flue-curing.
3058. Did you receive notice that there would have
to be a change?— Yes. That was partly wffiy we changed
over, but I w 7 as also influenced by the fact that the
Chinese were failing to come up to the mark. They
wnre getting too old and not producing good crops.
The seasons also were adverse. European labour vras
introduced in August, 1927.
3059. How many men?—We put on five.
3060. Were they Australians?—Ho, Italians.
3061. What area?—7s acres was set apart, but that
was not all cultivated. It eventually boiled down to
approximately 25 acres.
3062. Did you build barns?— Yes, there were
fourteen barns for flue-curing. The barns had been on
the property from the time of the Raleigh experiment.
It w 7 as the same land which had been sold to the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, and wffiich had fallen
back to the company again. They were old, of course,
and the flood had been through them, but we renovate.!
them. The Italians went on and produced a crop.


3063. What did it yield?—l cannot say, but it was a
good crop.
3064. Mr. Bentley. —ln 1926 they produced 143 bales
of tobacco, none of which was bright. It averaged
11.65 d. In 1927 they produced 220 bales which
averaged 14d, In 1928, 211 bales were produced, of
which 142 were flue-cured. That was the first year
that any flue-cured tobacco was produced. Out of that
number 28 bales were bright, and there were 104 bales
of mahogany. The average price was 18.9 d. In 1929,
354 bales were produced of which 78 were air-cured,
and the balance flue-cured. Of the flue-cured tobacco
60 bales were bright. The average price for both air
and flue-cured tobacco was Is. 9.93 d.
3065, By the Chairman. —Gunyan tobacco has
steadily improved in quality and price since 1927? —
That is so.
3066. When did you finish up at Gunyan?—At the
end of last year. We had then about 60 acres of
tobacco all told. We had five Chinese growers besides
the Italians.
3067. How many Italians?— There were three
groups.
3068. How many altogether?— The number varied.
They would employ labour as they required it.
3069. Can you tell us roughly how many Italians
were employed altogether on the property?— Possibly
25 or more.
3070. What was the idea of putting Italians on?—
As far as I could see they were a suitable class of men
for that work.
3071. Had they had previous experience?— They
said they had never seen a plant of tobacco before.
3072. Were you not taking a big risk in putting them
on?— Possibly, but they did very well.
3073. Did they master the flue-curing?— Yes.
3074. Did they carry out instructions? —Yes.
3075. Who was the head man?— One man was
appointed in each group. He was an Italian, but had
had no previous experience.
3076. Was your company satisfied with the result?—
Yes.
3077. Have prices since 1927 paid you?— Yes.
3078. Did you have any difficulty with the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company’s buyer?— Sometimes
I did not see eye to eye with him.
3079. After Mr. Lough has offered you a price do you
try to bring him up? —Yes.
3080. Have you found him reasonable? —Yes.
3081. Have you any views you would like to express
regarding tobacco cultivation here? —Personally, I feel
very optimistic about it. Gunyan provided an example
of what can be done with inexperienced men. With
the assistance of Mr. Kefford and the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company we made a success of it. The
British-Australasian Tobacco Company sent an expert,
Mr. Gilmour, up from Sydney to help us with the
curing.
3082. Did you pay his expenses?—We offered to pay
them, but the company would not take the money. He
assisted us through the curing and later on he came up
and gave us a start with the grading.
3083. Did the Italians do the grading?— Yes, they
mastered it quickly.
3084. And they mastered the flue-curing?— Yes, I
do not think there is any great art in it. The bulk of
the curing is done in the field. It is all a matter of
knowing the right time to pick the leaf. These men
learnt in one year how to pick it. The man who got
the big price this year had never before taken a shift
in a barn.
3085. How many men are there in a group?— There
were five in the original group.
3086. Do you think these men will improve?—lt is
difficult to say. I think they have made wonderful
headway so far in a short time. There is room for
experimenting in the selection of seeds. We have ex-
perimented with seven different kinds of seeds in two
years, and these men have had the benefit of it. Mr.
Lough on one occasion suggested that we experiment
with a different variety. He sent up four kinds of
seed, and I passed the seed on to the Italians who grew
it. It was with plants grown from that seed that the
wonderful crop of which we have heard, was produced.
Mr. Tregenna and Mr. Kefford were there. It is rather
interesting to note that Mr. Tregenna condemned the
whole four of those varieties. They were White Stem
Orinocco, Gold Leaf, Goldfinder and Yellow Pryor.
3087. When was that?- —After the 1927 season.
3088. How did Mr. Tregenna come to be there?—He
was paying a visit to the district. He said that these
varieties would not be suitable to the soil.
3089. He inspected the seed?—Ho, I told him that
I proposed to put in these seeds.
3090. Do you not think that if you had mentioned
the fact that the seeds had been recommended by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company he might have
hesitated before condemning them ?—I did not tell him.
He said that it was no use putting in those seeds. He
said that he had had experience wdth them before, and
it was only waste of time planting them. Anyway,
we put the seeds in and found that two of the varieties
appeared to suit the soil very well. They were the
White Stem Orinocco, and the Gold Leaf.
3091. Did you let Mr. Tregenna know T the result of
your experiments?—Ho, I was not in touch with him,
3092. Have you any idea of going in for tobacco-
growing yourself ?—Possibly.
3093. Do you think as a result of what you have seen
at Gunyan you would be sufficiently experienced to take
on growing?—l think so.
3094. Would you get Chinese growers?—Ho, cer-
tainly not.
3095. Would you put on Italians?—l think so.
3096. What about Australians?— Yes, if I could get
the men I wanted.
3097. Do you think the local labour would do?—lt
is a precarious crop to grow, and a man might have
to wait a long time before getting any return. How-
ever, if the owner is willing to help I think that suitable
young men might do well at it.
3098. Have you gone into the matter of soils?— Ho.
3099. Before going in for growing would you get
expert advice regarding soils?— Ho.
3100. If Mr, Tregenna told you that the soil was no
good, would you believe him?— Ho.
3101. Would you believe Mr. Lough if he told you
that the soil was no good?—Ho, I would not,
3102. Would you be satisfied with' 2s. per lb., year
in year out? —Yes. I think a crop is a certainty if it
is cultivated properly.
3103. Have you had any trouble with blue mould?—
I have not seen blue mould yet.
3104. What if the company would not buy your
dark leaf ?—I would not grow it.
3105. What percentage of bright leaf do you think
this district can produce under proper methods of grow-
ing and curing?— From 50 per cent, to 70 per cent.
3106. By Mr. Bentley. —ln reference to that crop
mentioned in the newspaper cutting, the figures for the
best crop purchased here are as follows;— 13 bales at
3s. per lb.; 32 bales at 2s. 6d. per lb.; making an average
price of just under 2s. Bd. 25 bales had to be regraded.
The price for these was lower than the above average,
so that the final average must have been lower than
2s. Bd.
3107. By Mr. Lennon. —Did you use all the plants
from the seed which Mr. Tregenna said was no good?—
Yes.
3108, What was the result? —They were not all
planted out, but the crop from such of those as were
planted brought good prices. Only two lots germinated
with good results.


3109. The excellent results referred to applied only
to one man’s crop of seven acres. He did not grow
the plants himself, but got the White Stem Orinocco
and Gold Leaf plants which had been grown by some-
body else. There were two men growing?—He had a
wages man.
3110. By the Chairman. —Did you take any notice
of the story about the eucalyptus taint when it was
first published ?—I read the article, but I thought it a
lot of rot. It seemed to me a most disloyal statement
for any one in Australia to make.
3111. Did you take any steps to see whether it was
true? —Ho. On the face of it I should not think it was
correct.
3112. Do you think that any unfortunate conse-
quences might flow from the circulation of such a
report?— Yes. It could have the effect of depreciating
the value of tobacco-growing land.
3113. Did it discourage any local growers? —It did
not apply here so much as to Tamworth.
3114. Did you discuss the matter with the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company’s buyer?— Yes; he did
not seem to take it very seriously.
3115. Did he give you any advice to hold your hand
a bit until you saw what came of it?— Ho. It did
not seem to worry him as a buyer.
3116. Did you communicate with the company
regarding the future of the tobacco-growing enterprise
at Gunyan ?—I did, after the first year’s venture. The
idea was to start more men. I wrote to the company
suggesting that it takes a proportion of the first two
or three years’ crop in the form of air-cured leaf. The
company wrote saying that it would not advise this
venture as the result of investigations in the north of
Queensland might have a big effect on the industry
in this district.
3117. The company advised you not to continue with
the Gunyan experiments?— That is so.
3118. Did you take it as a hint to get out?—Ho, but
to go slowly.
3119. Did they say anything about limiting the area ?
—Ho, only as regards sun-dried leaf,
3120. They did not mention air-curing, particularly,
did they. It has been suggested that the company told
the growers not to increase their areas until the eucalyp-
tus business had been settled?— That was the letter
I received, but nothing was mentioned about eucalyptus.
3121. Did the company tell you how long it was
likely to be until the Queensland experiments were
finished ?—Ho.
3122. Have you anything else to say ?—I should like
to stress the point that if we are to make a success of
the Australian tobacco industry, we must increase the
duty on imported leaf.
3123. You would make the public smoke Australian
tobacco whether they liked it or not?— Yes.
The witness withdrew.
John Campbell Scott, tobacco-grower, Biver Bend,
Texas, was called, sworn and examined.
3124. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco-grower ?
—Yes, this is my second year.
3125. What area did you have last year?—ln 1928.
I had about three acres.
3126. What area did you have in 1929? —We in-
tended to have sixteen acres, but we had a lot of trouble
with blue mould and grubs, and have now only six acres,
3127. How did you get on last year?— Fairly well.
We had a yield of about 34 cwt. Our crop was sun-
dried.
3128. To whom did you sell it?—To the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company at Is. per lb.
3129. Was it all dark?— Yes.
3130. What are you doing this year?—We are flue-
curing.
3131. Why did the company buy your air-cured
leaf last year?—Ho particular reason.
3132. Just because you grew it?—l interviewed the
company, and represented to them that I had had a lot
of trouble growing the tobacco, and had not had time
to build barns. On condition that I put in barns
this year, the company bought my tobacco.
3133. How many barns are you building?—We are
building three.
3134. Did Is. per lb. pay you for that crop?— Ho.
3135. What did it cost you to produce those three
acres ?—My expenses were about £4O without my own
wages.
3136. What did you put them down at ?—I worked
on the crop for about eight months, so that my own
wages would be about £2OO.
3137. What are you doing this year?—l am super-
vising the field work.
3138. You averaged about £2O an acre profit on the
other crop?—-Ho, there was no profit at all; it was a
loss.
3139. What labour are you employing this year?—
So far we have had to employ none, but we have not
yet started to cure. There are four of us in the enter-
prise, and we are working as a sort of company. We
are doing the work ourselves as far as possible. When
we start to cure we shall have to employ labour.
3140. What do you think of the Italians as growers?
—I think they are very intelligent, and very efficient.
3141. You have had only two years’ experience?—
Yes.
3142. What price would you need to get to induce
you to stay in the industry ?—lf I could get 2s. per lb.
for all the tobacco produced, including dark, it would
pay.
3143. How much bright tobacco do you think you
can produce?—l cannot say, not having done any flue-
curing.
3144. If the company refused to take your dark
tobacco, would it pay you to stay in the industry?— Ho.
3145. What sort of soil are you growing on ?—Bather
a light, alluvial soil.
3146. Where did you pick up your knowledge of
growing?— From the Chinamen on Texas station,
3147. Are you going to increase your area? —Hot
next year. I think four acres is a fair thing for one
main
3148. Have you had much trouble with pests?—We
had blue mould this year, but the tobacco got over it.
The failure was caused by cut worms. A part of the
land was planted four times.
3149. Are you doing anything about it ?—We tried
baits and spraying, but nothing seems to do much good.
The witness withdrew.
Edwin Cowley, Manager of Texas Station, Texas, was
and examined.
3150. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
tips position?— Just on six years,
3151. What experience have you had at tobacco-grow-
ing?— Since I have been here; none before that.
3152. How long has the station been growing tobacco ?
—Something like 20 years.
3153. With Chinese labour?— Yes.
3154. Have you been growing it every year?— Yes.
3155. What has been the average area? —In 1927,
we had up to 75 acres. That was our biggest area. We
were growing with Chinese.
3156. What did you have next year?—4s acres.
3157. Why the reduction?— The Chinese were getting
old.
3158. Was the 75-acre crop sun-dried? — Yes.
3159. And the 45-acre crop?— Yes.


3160. Did you get notice from the British-Austra-
lasian buyer in 1927 that they did not want sun-dried
tobacco? —I always understood that they did not want
it, but that they would take it from us.
3161. What price did you get in 1927 ?—Up to Is. sd.
3162. By Mr. Bentley. —The average price for 1927
was for 1928, 12.15 d., and for 1929, 12.87 d.
3163. By the Chairman. —What area did you have in
1929?— About 60 acres, but 45 acres was practically
a failure, due to drought.
3164. You have now gone in for flue-curing?-—-Yes.
3165. Why did the company let you go on air-curing
for three years after it had refused to take other people’s
air-cured tobacco?—l do not know the reason.
3166. You must have given them an undertaking
that you were going in for flue-curing?—We did promise
them we would do it as soon as possible.
3167. You have been getting just a little over Is.
per lb. every year. Did that pay you?— Yes.
3168. Have you introduced Italian growlers?— Yes.
3169. What are you doing with the Chinese? —Letting
them go. We picked out a few 7 good Chinese, but they
would not undertake flue-curing. They have all gone
now.
3170. What area have you put in this year?—We
planted about 30 acres, but owing to the grubs we
shall have not more than 22 acres of tobacco. It has
all been grown by Italians.
3171. What was the largest number of Chinese you
ever had on? —Uourteen, since I have been there.
3172. Do you employ any Australians at all?— Hot
in connexion with tobacco.
3173. What has been your experience with the
Italians?— They are very keen. We have them on
shares.
3174. This is your first flue-cured crop?— Yes.
3175. Have you any idea how it will turn out?—
The growers are very pleased with it so far, and expect
to get a big proportion of bright leaf.
3176. It would not pay you to sell it at Is. per lb.?—
Ho, not for flue-cured leaf.
3177. Would 2s. per lb. pay?—lt would depend upon
the season. If it was a good season no doubt 2s. would
pay-
3178. I suppose your company is able to extend the
area almost without limit ?—Yes, we have a lot of river
flat.
3179. Would that mean introducing more Italian
labour?—l do not see anything to stop Australians
from growing tobacco.
3180. Why did you not give the local men a chance?
—Hobody seemed keen on it.
3181. Did you try to get them?—Ho, but nobodv
made inquiries.
3182. Have you ever had any consultations with the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company’s buyer in re-
gard to the kind of land you are growing this tobacco
on?—We often have a talk over it, and he seems to
think our land is suitable.
3183. Has he expressed any opinion about this year’s
crop ?—I have not discussed it with him.
3184. Have you formed any opinion about the future
of the industry in the Texas district?—l think Texas
is a wonderful district for tobacco. I have been here
for six years, and we have not had a failure through
blue mould. We have been troubled with grubs this
year. The Italians have been spraying, and that has
steadied them.
3185. Did you hear the story of the Raleigh experi-
ment?—l heard part of it.
3186. Have you tried smoking Australian tobacco?
—Hot for some years.
3187. Have you tried any of the brands on the market
to-day, such as Waratah?—l generally smoke Have-
lock. I have never tried Waratah.
3188. How does Waratah appeal to you on looks and
smell?—lt smells quite all right.
3189. If you had nothing else to smoke would you
regard it as acceptable?—l would.
3190. Do you see any reason why Australians should
not smoke Australian tobacco? —Ho reason whatever.
3191. Do you think their taste is so refined that they
would never get used to smoking Australian leaf?—l
think they would get used to the local leaf if they had
to smoke it.
3192. How did you get in touch with the Italians
who are growing for you?— They approached me.
3193. By Mr. Martens. —Do you think the other
Italians in the district induced them to do so?— Most
of those who are with us were growing on Gunyan
last year. They were either growing there, or were
working for the men who were growing.
3194. By Mr. Jones. —Have you given any considera-
tion to the effect of an increased tariff on the industry?
—Yes.
3195. Do you consider that the abolition of excise
on Australian-grown leaf would be in the best interests
of the industry?-—I think it would be a good thing to
raise the tariff on the imported leaf.
3196. The present excise duty is the same on
American and on Australian leaf, namely, 2s. 4d. per
lb. Opinions have been expressed that the excise duty
on Australian-grown leaf should be abolished in order
to assist the industry. Do you support that view?—l
would rather see the duty raised on American leaf.
3197. By the Chairman.—lf the import duty w r ere
raised to such a level as to leave the manufacturer no
alternative but to supply all his requirements from the
Australian leaf, do you think it would be a fair thing
to the consumer? —Ho one would like to smoke really
bad tobacco, nor do I think that any one would like
to go back to the old dark tobacco that w T as smoked
years ago.
3198. In that case, would it not be better to take the
necessary step to produce a sufficient quantity of bright
leaf before putting on a prohibitive duty?—l think
that would be wise.
3199. You would not favour practically closing the
market to American leaf just for the sake of protecting
the few Australian growers in the industry at the pre-
sent time?—Ho, I think it "would be better to do it
gradually.
3200. Would you smoke any of the Australian grades
of tobacco rather than give up smoking?— Certainly.
I like the Waratah tobacco.
3201. Did you know that it was possible to get
Waratah tobacco on the market?—Ho, I have never
seen it in the shops here.
3202. Here is another brand known as Bronze Wing.
What do you think of it?—lt is all right, but I prefer
Waratah.
The witness withdrew.
John Maccioni, tobacco-grower, Texas, was called,
sworn and examined.
3203. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
living in Texas?—Hearly three years. I came from
Ingham, in Horth Queensland.
3204. Were you born in Italy?— Yes.
3205. Have you been growing tobacco here for three
years ?—Yes.
3205. Where did you learn to grow tobacco?—At
Gunyan.
3207. You knew nothing about it before that?— Ho.
3208. Did you have any of your countrymen with
you?—We started with five Italians, my brother and
three other fellows.
3209. You were growing on shares? —Yes, on Gun-
yan station.
3210. Were you head man?— Yes.


3211. Did you have much trouble at first when you
began ?—When I started, I knew nothing about it. Mr.
Jennings and Mr. McMaster gave me advice in put-
ting in the seed beds.
3212. After that you had no trouble?— Ho.
3213. How did you get on the first year?—We had
a good crop.
3214. Was it flue-cured ?—Yes.
3215. You have been curing for three years?— For
two years; this is the third.
3216. Who taught you to flue-cure?— The first year,
Mr. McMasters brought a man named Bryant from
Tamworth. We did not learn too much from him.
There has been much jealousy in the job. He did not
teach us.
3217. How did you get on?—We watched Mr.
Bryant all the time, and afterwards did the same as
be did.
3218. Mr. Bryant was there only for one year?—
Yes. Last year we worked on our own. The other four
men at Gunyan made three groups. I worked on my
own.
3219. You have been teaching all the other Italians
who have been coming along?—-Ho, we got another
man to help with the curing. He was Bob Watts, from
Ashford.
3220. Do you consider you can flue-cure now?—l
think so.
3221. Did you do the Hue-curing last year?— Bob
Watts was overseeing the job then.
3222. Are you in charge this year ?—Yes.
3223. With two years’ tuition you consider yourself
a flue-curer?—l think so.
3224. What about the other men, are they picking
it up ?—One of the men, Marchetti, is on his own, and
is growing good tobacco. He started off at the same
time as I did.
3225. What do you think about tobacco-growing here?
Sometimes it is all right. This year w T e had bad luck.
There were too many grubs. Last year, we got a good
crop without much trouble, but this year the grubs
were terrible. There has been no blue mould on my
place.
3226. What do you do to keep the grubs down?—
Spray them, but w r e cannot get rid of them.
3227. Do you think that with what you learned in
the three years you have been here, you could take
charge of the tobacco-growing on Gunyan stations?—
I think so. Mr. Gilmour has been down there from
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, and I have
learned a good deal from him. Mr. Watts also taught
me a good deal.
3228. Have you made any money out of tobacco in
the last three years?— Hot too much. I am satisfied
for the present, but I should like the returns to be
better.
3229. Are you getting much bright tobacco?—l shall
have a good deal of it this year. I am doing my best
to get it.
3230. What price do you expect to get from bright
tobacco; what price would you need to get for it to pay
you?—2s. 6d. or 2s. 9d. per lb. I would be satisfied
with that.
3231. Do you like tobacco-growing?— Yes; my
countrymen like it too.
3232. If tobacco-growing develops into a big industry
here, will more of your countrymen come along?—l
think so.
3233. What will the sugar industry in Horth Queens-
land do then?—l do not know T . Any way, there is too
much sugar being grown now.
3234. Do you smoke?—-Yes. 1 smoke Capstan
tobacco.
3235. Have you ever tried Australian tobacco? —I
do not think so, I do not smoke a pipe.
3236. Did Mr. Gilmour tell you to get a good colour
in your tobacco?-—Yes; they are asking all the time
for that. I know the company does not want the dark
stuff.
3237. Do you know what mahogany tobacco is?—
Yes.
3238. Do you know that they are classing mahogany
as dark ?—Y es, all except bright mahogany.
3239. Would 2s. per lb. all round pay you?—l think
it would.
3240. By Mr. Martens. —How’ did you come to Texas ?
—I met the Italian Consul in Brisbane. He said that
if I could get another four men, there was a company
at Texas that would give us land to grow tobacco on.
a quarter of the proceeds to go to the company, and
three-quarters to us. I did not know anything about
it apart from that. The Consul told me to give it
a try, as I might do all right. I said I would if I
could get four others. I found the others and we
came down.
3241. What were you doing at Ingham?—l was
growing sugar with one of my brothers.
3242. How many Italians are there here now?—
About fifteen or sixteen.
3243. How many came the first time?— Five.
3244. Did you write to the others? —Yes, we wrote to
friends. One group on Texas station was with me last
year.
3245. What part of Italy do you come from?— Sa-
rdinia.
3246. How long have you been out here ?—Eight
years.
3247. Did you see any tobacco grown before you
came out here?— Ho.
3248. How many hours a day do you wmrk?—Some-
times nine or ten, sometimes more, sometimes a little
less.
3249. By Mr. Jones. —Do you get a ton to the acre?
—Ho. We had 20 acres under tobacco, and got 17
tons.
3250. How much do you think it costs you to grow
a ton of tobacco ?—lt depends on the season.
3251. By the Chairman. —Do you estimate the cost
of production as you go along?— The station does that
3252. Do you put in your own wages?— Yes, wages
for each man.
3253. Is 17 tons off 20 acres a satisfactory crop?—
Hot bad.
3254. By Mr. Martens. —Who consigns the tobacco
away ?—The company. I represent the men, and settle
with them afterwards.
3255. You and your men work on equal shares? —
Yes. We made a mistake last year with our tobacco.
There were four different kinds of seeds. We got good
plants. Mr. Tregenna and Mr. Kefford came along
when we were planting out. Mr. Tregenna asked me
what sort of seed I had used, and I told him we had
got it from the British-Australasian Tobacco Company.
He said it was no good, and I might as well throw it
away.
3256. Did you tell Mr. Tregenna that the seed was
from the British-Australasian Tobacco Company?—He
knew that; Mr. McMaster told him.
3257. Did you tell him that, and did he still say to
throw it away?— Yes, he said it was no good. I put
2,000 plants in my place after Mr. Tregenna said it
was no good, and I got the best crop of the lot with it.
3258. By Mr. Jones- —Since Marchetti got that good
crop, have a lot of other Italians been trying to get
land?—l do not know.
3259. Do you keep in touch with other Italians in
other parts of the country and tell them how you are
getting on?— Yes.
3260. Did you tell them about the good crop Mar-
chetti got ? —Yes.
The witness withdrew.


Charles Frederick White, Managing Director of Texas
Estates; sworn and examined.
3261. By the Chairman. —Where do you live? —At
Stanthorpe.
3262, Have you had anything to do with the lexas
tobacco industry? —Yes, insofar as I have had the final
g<jy the growing of the tobacco on our station.
3263. How long have you been managing director?
—Since 1924.
3264. You maintain a general supervision over the
enterprise? —Yes.
3265. Can you tell us whether the company has had
any correspondence with the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company with regard to the future of the
industry in this district ?—Yes. _
3266. Mr. McMaster mentioned a letter which he
had received from the company. I presume it was in
reply to a letter written to the company. Have you
those letters? —Yes. I suggest, as a fair way of dealing
with the matter, that our letter to the company he read
and considered in conjunction with the company s
letter. Our letter is dated 7th August, 1928, and is as
follows: —
7th August, 1928.
The Secretary,
The British-Australasian Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd.,
Sydney.
Doubtless you are aw'are tbis company introduced Italian
labour on “ Duncan ” last year to grow and flue-cure tobacco
leaf, and the whole of the leaf recently purchased from here
was’grown by a group of five Italians.
This group, as originally constructed, has disbanded, but
the head man and another remain, and they intend to plant
a minimum area of 30 acres, and have arranged for five
years’ lease of the area, and all improvement and plant
necessary for the venture. They will employ other labour
as required.
Two Italians (members of the original group) wish to stay
and continue growing and flue-curing, and we are willing to
provide them with suitable land, and certain requirements
such as irrigation plant, working outfit, &c., but are not
prepared to finance the whole of the cost of further cui mg
barns.
The men are willing on being given a reasonable lease
or occupation of the land, to eventually erect cuiing barns
at their own expense, but they cannot afford to do so now,
and to overcome this difficulty it is proposed that they an -
cure their crop the first year. The second year they erect,
say, one curing barn, or sufficient barns to flue-cure 50 per
cent, of the leaf they grow. The third year the whole of
their crop must be flue-cured.
This arrangement would be binding by agreement, and a
specimen agreement has been prepared on the above lines.
The object of this letter is to request your assurance that
your company will be prepared to purchase the air-cured leaf
for the first and second year, it being understood that the
quality of the leaf would at least be up to the standard of
that grown by Chinamen here in the past and at present.
The total area to be planted the first year by these two
men would not exceed 30 acres.
The Chinamen are slowly but surely going out of the
tobacco-growing business here. They will not flue-cure, and
will not adopt modern cultural methods. In any case, they
are too old, and cannot be replaced by younger men of the
same nationality. As the Chinamen go off, it is hoped to
replace them with Italians or other suitable men who will
flue-cure, but without the assistance of your company in
the matter (by way of purchasing the air-cured leaf, pending
the erection of curing barns) the position is made very diffi-
cult from our point of view to enter into a satisfactory agree-
ment with the new man.
It is hoped this letter will be favorably considered and
the request granted.
Thanking you in anticipation of your early reply.
Yours faithfully,
Manager.
To this the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
replied on the 14th August, 1928, as follows
Raleigh Park, Kensington,
Sydney, 14th August, 1928.
The Manager,
Texas Estates (Queensland) Ltd.,
C unyan-Inglewood, Queensland.
Dear Sir,
Replying to your letter of the ith instant regarding
the putting under tobacco of an area of 30 acres by two
Italians, who have leased this area from you, we note the
basis which is proposed, and would suggest that the question
of the erection of flue-curing barns be left in abeyance for
the present.
As regards the first year’s crop, we will be prepared to
purchase air-cured tobacco from your district, provided the
total quantity is not in excess of our requirements, and which
we should feel bound to probably limit to a total area for
the whole district of, say, 75 acres.
You are no doubt aware that the Australian Tobacco In-
vestigation now have their own expert, Mr. Slagg, and they
are about to conduct a series of experiments in the various
States, and more particularly in North Queensland, and it is
just possible that important developments may arise from
these experiments which would have an influence upon what
it would be advisable to do in your district as regards the
erection of flue-curing barns.
We have been anxious to encourage flue-curing in the various
tobacco-growing districts with a view to improving the quality
of tobacco, but for the present we can continue to buy air-
cured leaf from your district provided the quantity produced
is not excessive. Compared to other districts, your air-cured
leaf does suit a trade in certain of our brands for which there
is still a small demand, and this enables us to buy it. At a
later stage, it may be necessary for us to stipulate for flue-
cured tobacco only.
We suggest, therefore, that further and final consideration
might be given to this matter about this time next year, when
we will be in a much better position to make a recommenda-
tion to you to meet your particular circumstances.
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) C. H. Reading,
Managing Director,
The British-Australasian Tobacco Coy. Pty. Ltd.
3267. I understand that you desire to tell the com-
mittee something about a local tobacco manufacturer
here; is that so? —Yes, in the 80’s, Greenup Brothers
erected a factory in this district. They manufactured
a brand of tobacco, which they called Texas Gold Bar,
and I liked it immensely from the first time I smoked
it.
3268. Was it a dark tobacco?—Ho, it was bright. At
that time the men on the station all smoked the very
black tobacco, such as Hegro Head. When I intro-
duced the Texas tobacco, the men got to like it so much
that the ordinary American stick tobacco was left on
my hands for months. While Texas Gold Bar was
obtainable, neither I nor my neighbours smoked any-
thing else. It was a light tobacco that did not burn
the tongue. As regards aroma, it seems to me it is
only a matter of getting used to a tobacco. That Texas
Gold Bar was Chinese grown and air-cured, and
naturally there were only a few leaves on each plant,
and only a small part of the crop suitable for that kind
of tobacco. Consequently, there was not much of it
made, and it did not become very widely known
throughout Queensland or Australia.
3269. Do you remember at what price it was sold?—
It was cheaper than the American tobacco, but I do not
remember what the price tvas.
3270. Do you think that its cheapness had anything
to do with its popularity?—l do not think so. It was
the quality that counted. It was grown here on these
Texas flats.
3721. Are you satisfied with the financial side of the
Texas Estates’ tobacco-grownig venture? —Yes, so far
as it has gone. We looked on it as encouraging enough
to extend the area under tobacco. My directors’ opinion
is that there is a big future before tobacco-growing in
this district provided the right varieties are used, and
the proper methods of cultivation, curing and grading
are studied.
3272. What steps are you taking to bring about that
improvement?— Last year I wrote to the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company asking them whether they
could recommend to us a thoroughly competent man to
instruct the growers in picking and curing the leaf.
They wrote that they would, if possible, send one of
their own officers, and, if not, they would recommend
a suitable man. When it came to the time for curing
the crop we wrote again, and they arranged to send
Mr. Gilmour. He was up here during curing operations
for some weeks. He did not leave until he was able to


tell us that the men knew a good deal about the job,
and could continue with the curing themselves. When
it was time to grade the leaf, Mr. Gilmour came back
and showed the men how to do the job.
3273. Did the company make any charge?—We
naturally expected that the charge would be made, but
the company refused to make one.
3274. Your relations with the company have been
very friendly?— Very. Of course, there is always that
matter of the Is. lid. per lb. which crops up.
3275. Have you had much of your tobacco priced at
Is. lid. ?—Last year, we had one lot, but we have really
not had much trouble in that way.
3276. Do you suggest that the tobacco which is priced
at Is. lid. per lb. was worth anything more? —I have
not had enough experience to venture an opinion.
8277. If Mr. Lough had paid you Is. Bd. or Is. 9d.
per lb., you would not have been so disappointed?—•
There is always that about it. You asked some wit-
nesses how the Italians first came to this district. I
can give you the history of it. The Italian Consul
paid a visit to Stanthorpe, where some Italians were
growing fruit. Mr. Rudder and I got into touch with
him. The growing of tobacco came up for discussion.
We induced the Consul to come down here and have a
look at the tobacco. He told us that there were ex-
perienced Italian agriculturists in the north, where they
were growing too much sugar, and they might be
induced to come down here and try their hand at
tobacco-growing. After several conversations with him
we agreed that if he would pick a group of Italians,
wdio were experienced agricultural workers, we would
provide the necessary land for them to commence
tobacco-growing and due-curing. The original group
broke up after the second year. Maccioni kept on with
the original farm, and two of the others went on each
of two other small farms. At first, w 7 e intended that
they should erect their own barns after the first year,
but w 7 e found that we had more barns than we required
on the original farm, and we removed tw-o of these to
each of the new farms. It was one of those men who
produced the crop that has been referred to as bring-
ing a high price.
3278. Are you satisfied with the Italians? —Very well
satisfied. We have since received applications for land
not only from Italians, but from Australians also:
young fellows who had been reared in farming centres.
Hi some cases, they have been experienced tobacco-
grow 7 ers in other parts of the Commonwealth, and 1
think I am right in saying that v*e have received appli-
cations from South Africa.
3279. Has the company given them any encourage-
ment to come along and start growing on the same term?
of the Italians? —Nothing final has been done with
any of the applications. They w r ere received too late
to make any arrangements for the season now in pro-
gress. We hope w T e will be able to have more growers
on the land for next season.
3280. Including Australians? —Yes.
3281. Is your company going in for large areas of
tobacco?— Our idea is to go in for tobacco so as to
assist us in a subdivisional scheme which will come
about later on. We w T ant to show 7 that the flats are suit-
able for mixed farming and tobacco-growing. With
that idea in view 7 we are adding to the Maccioni farm
a small dairy next year. He is getting a cousin of his
out, who is experienced in dairying, to take it, over.
E agree that tobacco is not a safe crop for a man to
depend on, but tobacco, with mixed farming, will be
a very safe proposition on this river.
3282. By Mr. Jones. —Since Marchetti got that good
crop on your land, have any other Italians sought to
obtain land under similar conditions ?—Yes, their appli-
cations w r ere amongst those of which I told you.
3283. I suppose you would not be able to substan-
tiate the figures given in the press paragraph to the
effect that the return from seven acres was £233 an
acre? —I know the figures were taken from the actual
sales records. Unfortunately, we have not a report of
the sales here at Gunyan. The files have been taken up
to the office at Stanthorpe.
3284. By Mr. Martens—The head office of your com-
pany is at Stanthorpe?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Canberra.)
THURSDAY, 13th MARCH, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Tully.
Mr. Jones
Mr, Martens
Albert Cherbury David Rivett, M.A., D.Sc., was re-
called and further examined.
3285. By the Chairman. —I understand that you
are leaving for England soon?— Yes, next week.
3286. Will you be away for any lengthy period?
—I am not quite sure about that. If the Prime
Minister wants me to stay for the Imperial Conference
I shall not return until November or December.
3287. Is there any statement that you would like
to make to amplify your previous evidence? —I should
like to mention one point in connexion with the control
of the Tobacco Investigation., Some time ago the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company made to the
Tariff Board a suggestion, winch in turn w r as passed
on to the Development and Migration Commission, and
which, after certain negotiations had taken place,
resulted in the formation of a committee representing
the Development and Migration Commission, the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, and the
various States through the medium of the Standing
Committee on Agriculture. We added to that com-
mittee a technical officer, Dr. Darnell-Smith. Speak-
ing now 7 as a member of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, I should like to say that we
regard it as a little illogical to have a special body
constituted to deal with one agricultural product when
there is in existence the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, which is concerned with research
work in connexion with quite a number of other pro-
ducts. When this committee developed we did not
object, because it seemed at that time inadvisable to do
so; but we are of the opinion that, as far as the Common-
wealth is concerned, this work should really belong to
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
We suggest that it is advisable to hand over to us
certain sections of the work of investigation, particu-
larly the scientific sections. The work on plant patho-
logy and so forth might be carried on more cheaply
and possibly more efficiently by our staff. We have at
our laboratories men who are well trained in plant
investigation. We have already tackled the blue mould
problem, and have every reason to believe that w r e
shall find a solution of it. There are other virus
diseases which are worrying the growers, and their
investigation might well be taken over by our division
of plant industry.
3288. That would really mean the elimination of the
present Tobacco Investigation Committee? —I suggest
that the work could probably be carried out more


effectively by our staff. We would have to give con-
sideration to the precise type of controlling body. Per-
sonally, I think that the controlling body might well
be the present executive of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, with the same representative
of the States, viz., the chairman of the standing com-
mittee. Then we would follow the policy that we have
adopted in other directions, so as to keep closely in
touch with the actual industry. In animal health work
for example, in connexion with the McMaster labora-
tory, which is being built in Sydney, we have an
advisory committee on which three members out of six
are pastoralists, and, if it desired it, the pastoral
industry could have four representatives out of seven
members. This means a tremendous lot to us, because
it enables us to keep in intimate touch with the industry.
If my suggestion is carried out I feel certain that the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research would
in some way keep in close contact with the grow ers, thus
following the practice that we have adopted in other
directions.
3289. You suggest that the present Tobacco Inves-
tigation Committee should cease to function, and in
its place we should have an advisory committee consist-
ing of representatives of the growers and certain
persons nominated by the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, and that that committee should
co-operate with the executive body of the council?—
Yes.
3290. We shall give consideration to that suggestion.
Is there any other statement that you would like to
make?—l rather hesitate to raise this point; but one
cannot be associated wdth this work without feeling
that there is a very undesirable atmosphere of mis-
trust and suspicion throughout the industry, and that,
of course, hampers the scientific work.
3291. You mean that there is a suspicion in respect
of the scientific section of the inquiry?— Hot parti-
cularly; but there is mistrust on the part of the
growers towards the company. I expect that the mem-
bers of the committee know more of this atmosphere
than I do. It cannot be missed, although it is rather
difficult to define. If we were to undertake this work
our first objective ivould be to get rid of the atmosphere
of mistrust and suspicion, because its existence would
make it difficult for us to carry out our work satis-
factorily.
3292. Judging by the evidence given by some of
tlm experts in the States, I should say that that sus-
picion is well founded?—l cannot give any instances
or details; but the suspicion is there all the time.
3292 a. Dr. Darnell-Smith is a member of the Tobacco
Investigation executive. Mr. Gepp told us in ' Sydney
that that officer is receiving from the committee £250
per year. That information was not previously in our
possession. We were under the impression that these
experts and scientists were doing their work volun-
tarily, or rather, that they had been allotted by the
various States to assist in this work. What is Dr.
Darnell-Smith doing for that remuneration?—l shall
have to go back to the start of the investigation. The
proposal originally was that Mr. Gepp and I should
act in an executive capacity. I know nothing about
tobacco-growing at all. I was to be a member of the
executive as an officer of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research. I do not know that Mr. Gepp
claims to know much about tobacco-growing. We
therefore came to the conclusion that we should get
hold of some one who had a knowledge of the scientific
side. Certain names were suggested: We consulted
with the Yew South Wales Department of Agriculture,
and ultimately it was decided to invite Dr. Darnell-
Smith to be a member of the committee, the idea
being that he should be a technical officer on the
committee, which was otherwise an honorary body. It
was decided that he should receive £250 per annum.
Shortly afterwards he was sent to America to make
inquiries there. I believe that the committee has a
copy of his report.
3293. Were his expenses defrayed by the Tobacco
Investigation Committee?— Yes, as far as I know.
Pull details could be obtained of those costs.
3294. Should not the cost of defraying the expenses
of the trip have been met by the States?— The States
contribute towards the funds of the Tobacco Investiga-
tion, so we did not consider it fair to ask them for anv
indirect additional contribution.
3295. We should like to know the actual cost of the
trip?-—I shall ask the secretary of the Tobacco Inves-
tigation Committee to send those details to the com-
mittee.
3296. \\ e want to know what work is being done by
Dr. Darnell-Smith ?—When he started his work he
certainly did more than he is doing at present. He
was able to give us information on certain lines, but
when Mr. Slagg came the need for that largely dis-
appeared.
3297. My impression is that Dr. Darnell-Smith has
done little in connexion with the actual work of
investigation for the last couple of years?— There has
been a good deal less for him to do for the last two
years than we at first anticipated.
3298. Has any decision been come to regarding the
continuation of the investigation?— I think I said
when I previously gave evidence, that that was a
matter which the executive had to consider imme-
diately, because of the three-years 5 period ending in
April. We have not yet been able to hold a meeting
of the executive, although we have kept in touch by
correspondence. The whole matter has been discussed;
but we have not had an opportunity of meeting as
an executive. A memorandum has been drafted and
circulated, and it contains a recommendation that the
work of investigation shall be continued.
3299. What is the executive actually proposing?-
I think that that information should come from the
executive after it has met and determined what action
it intends to take.
3300. Can we assume that steps are being taken to
continue investigations on previous lines?— Yes. You
can take it as quite certain that the executive will
recommend that it is well worth while continuing the
investigation, although it may have to be modified in
some way.
3301. Is any period stipulated?—We are thinking
of recommending a period of three years.
have evidence from Dr. Darnell-Smith
and Mr. Tregenna to the effect that it would take at
least ten years to get anywhere with this investigation ?
—I do not know on what they base those statements,
and I have no idea of their probable accuracy.
3303. Mr. Gepp expressed the same view. We have
had fixed in our minds the fact that ten years is the
minimum period in which an investigation can be
successfully carried out ?—One would want to get down
■° details. It would be extremely disappointing if our
work in connexion with blue mould, for instance, could
not be completed for ten years. The question of
finding suitable areas for growing better-class tobacco
may take some time to determine, because that depends
upon the class of soil, the rainfall, and so forth \n
experimental block was put in at Mareeba; but unfor-
tunately, it failed owing to floods. That is one year
delays' lllustrates liability to unforeseen


3304. You do not subscribe to the view that it will
take ten years to complete the investigation?—ln
scientific work it is dangerous to fix any period. Results
may come quickly or they may not.
3305. By Mr. Jones. —Do you suggest a change of
control, in consequence of the abolition of the Develop-
ment and Migration Commission?—l do not think that
that need affect the position. I suppose that there will
still be something resembling the Development and
Migration Commission in existence, because Mr. Gepp
is being retained in an advisory capacity.
3306. Do you think that if the cost of the investiga-
tion were borne Avholly by the CommonAvealth Govern-
ment that would tend to remove the air of suspicion
between the groAvers, the company, and the immstiga-
tion committee ?—I think that to a great extent these
antagonisms and suspicions are unreasonable, and my
own feeling is that it would be a pity to decline to
take money from the tobacco company.
3307. Would that be a factor in creating that sus-
picion ?—lt should not be. As far as I can see, and
I have watched the position closely, I think that the
tobacco company is absolutely straightforward. It
really wants a good type of tobacco to be grown in
Australia. There is no evidence that the company has
any ulterior motive.
3308. If the CommonAvealth Government bore the
whole of the cost would not that remove the atmosphere
of suspicion and distrust ?—I do not see why it should
affect the situation at all, unless, of course, the growers
may suspect the company of exerting some secret in-
fluence on the investigation committee. If they think
that they had better say so, and if such an astonishing
allegation could be proved, the body controlling the
investigation should get out of the business.
3309. By the Chairman. — My impression is that the
groAvers consider that the investigation has been a clever
moA-e on the part of the company. The period of the
inquiry is indefinite, and until it is completed the
company Avill be able to say that as the whole of the
tobacco industry is in the melting pot it cannot be
expected to say that Australian tobacco is as satisfac-
tory as the imported article?—l have heard elsewhere
that that exists, but I can only say that from
my experience it is unreasonable and unfair to the com-
pany. Possibly, if the growers kneAv that the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research Avere taking
control of the investigation they might lose the feeling
tliat the investigation has anything in it of the nature
of organized procrastination. In any case, the feeling
is AAdiolly unjustified.
3310. By Mr. Martens. — lf the grovcers had direct
representation on the controlling committee it vvould
haA r e a Avonderful influence on the industry?—l think so.
3311. By the Chairman. —Have you investigated the
carious organizations of the States as far as tobacco-
growing is concerned ?—No.
3312. By Mr. Jones. —Mr. Tregenna said that the
whole of New South Wales and of Victoria, except
Pomonal, Avas unsuitable for tobacco-growing?— The
tobacco investigation committee has no evidence before
It to lead it to subscribe to that view. It may be the
ease, but we have no definite evidence to that effect.
3313. By the Chairman. —The British-Australasian
Tobacco Company has said that it is prepared to buy
at least ten times more tobacco of bright colour than
it purchases now, without any regard to aroma at all.
Would not that disprove the suggestion that the tobacco
groAvn in New South Wales and Victoria to-day is of
no use commercially ?—I presume that the companv
Avould not use the tobacco unless it paid it to do so.
3314. Mr. Tregenna said that there has not been
much occasion for collaboration with the State experts.
Is that the case ?—I would not like to admit that there
has not been much occasion for collaboration, because
actually there has been a good deal of occasion for that.
The Tobacco Investigation Committee has sought to
carry out its exploratory work in co-operation with
State officers. We have done our level best to consult
and co-operate with the States. That has been our
definite policy.
3315. Mr. Tregenua says that North Queensland is
die only place where suitable tobacco leaf is likely to
be grown. What is your opinion of that statement?—
It is far too sweeping.
3316. By Mr. Jones. —Would not the evidence given
by Mr. Tregenna give good ground for suspicion on the
uart of the growers towards the Development and
Migration Commission?— The whole attitude of the
Development and Migration Commission has been
absolutely fair and above board, and I see no reason to
uispect that body in the least.
3317. By the Chairman. —Have you any further
statement to make ?—-After I gave evidence previously
it Avas reported in some neAvspapers that I had
associated myself Avith the vieAv that there is a
eucalyptus taint in Australian tobacco. I want to make
;t clear that I said nothing of the sort. I know of no
definite acceptable evidence in support of that view,
f wrote to the newspapers concerned asking them to
correct the press reports.
The witness withdrew.
Sir George Alfred Julius, Kt., B.Sc., 8.E., Chairman
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, was called, sworn and examined.
3318. By the Chairman. —I understand that you
iui\e had a good deal to do with the tobacco investiga-
tion, and that AAdiile you vvere in America you co-
opeiated AAuth Dr. Cameron and Sir Hugh Denison
in the selection of Mr. Slagg?—That is not quite
correct. My association with the Tobacco Investigation
iwgan Avitb the early negotiations that Mr. Gepp and
myself had wii.h the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company. At that time the company said that it was
prepared to make certain sums of *’ money available
under certain conditions provided that the Avork was
entrusted to a committee consisting of a member of
the Development and Migration Commission, a member
ot the executive of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, and a third member selected from
outside by those two officers. After completing these
negotiations securing the agreement of the Com-
monwealth Government to take up the matter with the
State Governments, the Council appointed Dr. Rivett
as its representative on that committee. I then Avent
to England on other business. While there I met Dr.
Cameron, and discussed Avith him the various applica-
tions received for the position novv occupied by Mr.
."Jagg. The appointment had then been made, and
until then I had had no opportunity of meeting any
one Avho knew anything of Mr. Slagg. I then went to
America and came into contact with the Canadian
authorities under whom Mr. Slagg had previously
worked. Dr. Grisdale, the Deputy Minister for Agri-
culture m Canada, was interviewed by me, and also
Dr. Garner of Washington, Avho originally was Mr.
s chief, and who at that time was a departmental
it - j n o the service of . the federal Government of the
inited.States of America. I discussed the whole posi-
aon with those authorities and made inquiries about
Mr. Slagg s work and capacity. In addition, I met
Mr Slagg at Washington prior to his departure for
c- la, -rr ' as . l can rem ember, my only contact
with Sir Hugh Denison on the matter was when 1
landed in New York, Sir Hugh Denison Avas then
within a Aveek of returning to Australia, and he men-
Roned to me that he had assisted Dr. Darnell-Smith
And others in obtaining applications for this appoint-
ment. Beyond that I do pot think that I discussed
che subject with him,


3319. You had nothing to do with the actual appoint-
ment of Mr. Slagg? —Mo. I tried to find out from both
Dr. Grisdale and Dr Garner the kind of work that they
thought Mr. Slagg could do effectively. I made in-
quiries particularly in Washington. In addition, I
sought advice of Dr. Garner as to the best way in
which Australia should tackle this problem, and 1 got
from him valuable assistance which I communicated
to Dr, Kivett, which, as a member of the committee, he
no doubt has used.
3320. Can you recollect whether any definite promise
was made to Mr. Slagg that his appointment would be
permanent, or for more than three years?—Mo such
promise Avas made, so far as lam aware. It is highly
probable that Mr. Slagg may haA r e asked me whether
the job A ! , as likely to last for some time, and in that case
I may haA r e replied that that Avould be so provided that
things ran smoothly. I certainly made no promise.
3321. Mr. Slagg informed us in Melbourne that had
he thought the job would not last more than three years
he would not have taken it. We assumed, of course,
that some definite assurance had been giA'en to him.
Dr. Cameron most emphatically repudiated any sug-
gestion that Mr. Slagg had been appointed for a longer
period than three years, and he stated that, so far as
he Avas aAvare, no inducement whatever had been held
out beyond a three years’ period?— Mr. Slagg had
already been appointed when I met him. I did not
communicate Avith him in any Avay. He must have
made up his mind from something that he heard before
I met him. He had left the Canadian Government
serA'ice and Avas in Washington. I met him in Dr.
Garner’s room. He Avas then on his way to Australia.
One must be fair to Mr. Slagg. I should say that in
almost every case when a man is appointed for a
certain period he Avould ask Avhat were his chances for
an extension of the period. In such cases my reply
has always been that it depends on the person’s suita-
bility for the job and the progress of the Avork.
3322. From your knowledge of the circumstances
of that Avork, Avould you consider that Mr. Slagg would
be justified in thinking, particularly as he had brought
his family here, that provided his Avork Avere satisfac-
tory there Avas no question about the position lasting
for a longer period than three years?—ln a measure
I think so, because Dr. Garner and Dr. Grisdale told
me emphatically of the experience of the United States
of America and Canada in respect of this work, and that
it Avas most improbable that Australia Avould solve the
problem in three years, and that if Ave meant business
and Avere prepared to tackle the problem on a proper
basis it could not be settled Avithin that time. Any
man, therefore, Avho had confidence in his capacity
for the AA T ork Avould, I think, be quite justified in
believing that the position Avould last longer than three
years.
3323. What is the salary paid to Mr. Slagg?—lt
AA-as, I belieA'e, to be £1,500 a year.
3324. If Mr. Slagg is re-appointed at the end of
three years, will his appointment be under the original
terms?—-I firmly believe that, for the efficient conduct
of this work, it should be transferred to the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research. In that Avay
financial economies would be achieA T ed, and much more
effective use made of the scientific services now avail-
able in the Commonwealth laboratories. I believe that,
under our methods, much of the present distrust and
opposition Avould disappear. If the work is to be under
the aegis of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, Mr. Slagg’s salary Avould certainly be no
more than £1,500, if as much, because the nominal
salary of the head of the division under which this
Avork Avould come is £1,500.
3325. Have you any suggestion to make that might
assist the committee in this Avork?—Mo, beyond the
suggestion made by Dr. Rivett that the control should
be transferred to the Council for Scientific and Indus-
trial Research. I am wholly in agreement with that
suggestion. I believe it to be the proper solution of the
problem. I learned from Mr. Slagg’s previous
employers that his training and experience lay entirely
on the field side. I was told that the scientific work
required in the United States of America and Canada
had been conducted by persons other than Mr. Slagg;
that the kind of service that we would get from that
officer would be in the field, and that, if we were wise,
vve would make arrangements for the scientific work
to bo done by officers more competent in this particular
aspect than Mr. Slagg. I have since seen no reason
since then to doubt that advice. I believe, therefore,
that this work would be more effectively carried out if
entrusted entirely to the scientific officers of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research. They are men
who are indubitably of higher scientific qualification
than Mr. Slagg, although they do not approach his
experience in field work. My belief is that Mr. Slagg’s
proper position is field officer, and nothing more.
3326. Will you indicate what would be the actual
scientific side of this investigation as against the field
and experimental side?— Take, for instance, the ques-
tion of blue mould. That problem is being tackled by
our scientific men, and a solution is, I think, in sight;
but there are other diseases which must be investigated,
and they can only be tackled by highly specialized
scientific workers. Yesterday, I was shown a case of
u bunchy top.”
3327. We have had evidence to show that experts
such as Mr. Tregenna and Mr. Temple Smith, who
have been connected with this industry for many years,
are definitely making statements which are having an
adverse effect on the growers and the economic position
of the industry. Would you say that these experts are
essentially field men, and not scientists at all? —I have
not sufficient knowledge of their training and past
history to know whether they have had experience in
scientific work; but I have always understood that they
have not. The question of blue mould has been a vital
problem among the growers for many years, and when
the investigation committee came into the field little
advance had been made towards its solution, yet within
a relatively short time scientific workers have, I under-
stand, a solution in sight. That shows that there has
been inadequate scientific Avork prior to the time that
the investigation committee was appointed. Whether
the experts did not have the capacity to carry out that
work, or whether it was delayed for some other reason,
perhaps financial, I cannot say. The fact remains that
the Avork Avas not done, and it is a logical deduction to
say that, prior to the appointment of the Investigation
Committee, something had been Avrong.
3328. Would you say that the experts other than the
scientists associated Avith the investigation AA T ork are
not proper persons to express definite opinions regard-
ing any scientific phase of the industry?—l do not
think that any man without appropriate and adequate
scientific qualifications should express any opinion on
the scientific aspects of this problem.
3329. Mr. Tregenna informed us that the Imperial
Institute of Great Britain has been sent samples of
Australian tobacco, and that he had been deputed
by the Development and Migration Commission to
select samples. He selected samples on the basis of
price, and sent them to England. The report was that
the samples had no commercial value, yet he admitted
that among the samples was one produced by Mr.
McGee, an expert who was brought out from America
by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company?—lt
is all a matter of relative value. As a continuous
smoker, I think that there are a great many deficien-
cies, from the point of vieAA T of the burning aroma,
in Australian leaf. We..-have far to go .before we


can grow leaf that can be regarded as satisfactory
from the smokers’ point of view r , and, after all, that is
the main objective. I can, therefore, understand buyers
in some other parts of the world, w r ho are able to secure
a leaf that is attractive to the smoker, saying that there
is no commercial value in Australian leaf. The very
fact that the tobacco company is prepared to buy large
quantities of this leaf, and to use it in conjunction
Avith other leaf, shows that they can obtain, by blending,
satisfactory result from the local product. From the
opinion that I obtained from Dr. Shaw, head of the
Botanical Service in India, from Colonel Williams,
head of the Agricultural Department of South Africa
—I met both those gentlemen in London —and from
Dr. Grisdale, in Canada, I came to the conclusion that
the success that had been achieved in those three
countries could be achieved here. Originally their
conditions were very similar to what they are here; yet
they have been able to produce a marketable type of
leaf. In the first stages the leaf was such that would
not commend itself to smokers, but each of those
countries, as the result of persistent work, is now in
a position to supply leaf that compares favorably
■with that grown in America. After talking the
matter over wdth Dr. Shaw;, of India, I came
to the conclusion that w 7 e have no reason to be
pessimistic. We can do equally well in Australia,
where Ave have a variety of climates and soils. We
haA r e no reason to suppose that Ave cannot succeed as
those three countries haA r e succeeded. In Australia
we are experiencing unquestionable difficulties in the
treatment of various tobacco diseases, but the indications
are that Ave may be clear of most of them before long.
There has to be a definite advance made in the smoking
quality of the leaf. I am still of the opinion that I
formed AA r hile overseas three years ago —that there is
no earthly reason why avc should not meet Avith the
success that has been achieA r ed in other countries.
I can quite understand that tobacco leaf, selected in
Australia, and sent to another part of the Avorld, might
not commend itself to oversea buyers. Whether good
leaf will be obtainable in Australia, suitable to the
smokers’ taste, is a matter that time must decide. I
do not think that the London report that the Australian
types of tobacco were of no commercial value is much
of a criterion as to the possibility of the production of
a good leaf in Australia. It is purely a matter of
relatiA r e values.
3330. Would not the tests of the Australian tobacco
in England haAm been v r ery cursory and unsatisfactory,
seeing that the only tobacco manufacturing company
here pays a high price for that class of leaf?— That
is so.
3331. The report on the Australian tobacco Avas
made on the 13th August, 1928. Was the Investigation
Committee in existence then? —Yes. I think it Avas
appointed in 1927.
3332. Would the samples selected by Mr. Tregeuna
have been submitted to the Tobacco Im r estigation Com-
mittee for approval, or Avas that Avork done over the
heads of that committee?- —-I have no knowledge of
that. Dr. Bwett has neA'er mentioned to me the fact
that samples were sent to Great Britain.
3383. Even the growers had no knowledge of the
samples being selected. Those samples which brought
the highest prices here Avere considered to be commer-
cially worthless in London. Would the Tobacco Investi-
gation exccutiA’e authorize any State expert to conduct
a test of that kind?—iNo. Any examination of Aus-
tralian leaf by buyers in London may, to a large extent,
be valueless. To form any opinion of the A'alue of
leaf in. Australia .one requires to knoAv the whole of
the local marketing conditions,
3334. Would you say that the report on the 20
samples sent to London would he .a very useful contribu-
tion to the tobacco investigation work in Australia? —
I should say not. It would not deter me in the slightest
from going on with the job. 1 do not think that the
report would have much bearing on the investigation
work.
3335. Have you given consideration to reports ex-
pressed from time to time that the fundamental diffi-
culty in growing the Australian product is the
eucalyptus taint?—l have seen the statement reported,
and I have discussed the subject. There is no vestige of
evidence to support such a contention. I have not
seen anything that would satisfy me that there is
eucalyptus taint in Australian leaf. I have discussed
the subject with scientific workers, and it is from their
reports that I have formed this opinion.
3336. By Mr. Martens. —There is no doubt that the
bugbear of the growers is blue mould ?—That is beyond
question. I do not think that any of our scientific
workers would be prepared to say definitely that they
have solved the problem of blue mould; but they
have told us that they can really see daylight in the
matter. I believe that they are definitely on the track
of a solution. They arc quite sanguine about it.
3337. Is the mosaic disease in tobacco similar to
t!iat in sugar-cane?—l do not know. It has a wither-
ing effect, and I was shown samples of it yesterday.
3338. By Mr. Jones.— You said that there was a
great deficiency in burning aroma in Australian
tobacco ?—Yes.
3339. Supposing that six hands of Australian-groAvn
tobacco were mixed Avith six hands of similar type
American-groAvn tobacco, would your experts be able
to test them and pick out the Australian from the
American leaf ?—I would not like to express an opinion
on that. The kind of expert that I should select for
such a test would be a smoker, because he is best
able to detect any deficiency of burning aroma. It is
simply a matter of taste. I have smoked Australian
leaf, and some of it I have found most unpleasant.
But there are wide differences in the tobacco. I am
told that there has been a distinct in the
burning aroma of tobacco grown in two parts of Aus-
tralia, namely, Pomonal and Mareeba. I heard
it said that if avc can produce a leaf equal to that
groAvn in those two places, we shall be in a position to
replace a large percentage of the leaf that is at present
imported into Australia.
3340. Would you say that blue mould is seed borne?
1 personally have no opinion on that, but our scien-
tific Avorkers are of that opinion. Of course, the soil
itself may be contaminated.
3341. On the State committees there are men of high
qualifications and with university degrees. Would it
be an advantage to have a practical man on the com-
mittee ?■—-Yes, on the State committee, and also on the
advisory committee that Dr. Riv'ett referred to. This
advisory committee would consist of scientific men
and industrial experts. The State committee is supposed
to represent the industry generally OA r er certain geo-
graphical areas, and on that committee are represen-
tatiA T es of universities, representatives of State scientific
services, and representatives of industry. On the
XeAv South ’Wales committee, for instance, Ave have
a representative of the steel industry and three
representatives of pastoralists, and it is hoav proposed to
other industrial representatives. On State com-
mittees it is at any time possible to bring in other
representatiA r es if thought desirable. But that is not
the kind of advisory committee that would control the
conduct of the work in connexion Avith the tobacco
investigation. The advisory committee Avould be on
the lines of that which is being constituted for the
conduct of the McMaster laboratory.


3342. We have had evidence in connexion with two
consignments of Australian tobacco leaf sent from
Victoria to London in different years, and that leaf
held its own in open competition with American leaf
of similar type. How would you reconcile that favor-
able report with the pessimistic report furnished to
the Development and Migration Commission? —
Obviously, there were differences either in the quality
of the leaf or in the opinions of those who made the
examinations regarding marketable leaf.
3343. By the Chairman. —If the control of the
Tobacco Committee were transferred to the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, would there be
any reduction in overhead cost? —There would be a
definite reduction in overhead cost, and a further reduc-
tion in the cost of the scientific services. It is much
cheaper to conduct an investigation under an organi-
zation which already embraces the required scientists
among its personnel than to have the work carried out
by an independent body of experts located all over the
place. I cannot estimate the saving, but I am quite
satisfied that it w r ould be considerable.
3344. If the work of tobacco investigation were made
one of the many jobs handled by the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, would not that
adversely affect the experimental field work?— Not in
the slightest. I do not think any handicap would be
involved in the transfer.
3845. What is your opinion of the suggestion that
the British-Australian Tobacco Company should
withdraw- from the experimental work?—lt would be
a disadvantage to allow the company to withdraw.
We would lose not only the advantage of their finan-
cial assistance, but also the advantage of their close
co-operation. The closer we bring our scientific
workers into contact with the man who grows
the leaf and the man who buys it, the more
it will facilitate the work of our scientific men. I
know of no bolter w 7 ay of getting the active co-opera-
tion of the grower and the buyer than to get them to
subscribe to the job. Men like Mr. McMaster and
Mr. John Darling have been of the greatest assistance
to us in our scientific work. It is certain that in the
conduct of the tobacco w r ork we w T ant the co-operation
of the grower and the manufacturer.
3346. You see no reason wdiatever to support the idea
that there is a suspicion among the growers respecting
the association of the tobacco company with the
experiments that are being made?— None whatever.
The company has given us an absolutely free hand and
every assistance.
3347. You favour the appointment of an advisory
committee?— Yes, just as we are doing in many other
directions.
3348. What part would the advisory committee play
in the investigation work?—-Quite a useful part. All
the problems to be investigated would be discussed by
members of the committee, and all suggestions as to
possible solutions made by the scientific workers would
also come before the committee. A proposition might
be all right in theory, but not in practice, and there-
fore the close co-operation of the producers is abso-
lutely necessary. It is a most valuable association.
3349. By Mr. J ones. —When we visited the tobacco
farms we found that individual growers were carrying
out their own experiments. Would not the experiments
be better carried out by the investigation committee ?
That may be so, but I think that it is a good thing to
get the growers to do a certain amount of that work.
It has a stimulating influence, particularly if there
is an advisory committee to which the growers can
make known the results of their experiments,

{Taken at Canberra.)
WEDNESDAY, 2nd APRIL, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones j Mr. Tully.
Mr. Martens
(Mr. C. M. Slagg representing the Australian Tobacco
Investigation.)
Bertram Thomas Dickson, 8.A., Ph. D., Chief of the
Division of Plant Industry, Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, Canberra, was called,
sworn and examined.
3350. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position?-—Since Ist October, 1927. I
joined the council as chief mycologist.
3351. Were you in Australia when you received this
appointment?—No, I came here from Canada. I was
appointed from Canada.
3352. Was your present position available when you
arrived?—No, I had to wait for it.
3353. We understand that you have been in charge
of some experimental work in connexion with tobacco?
—Yes.
3354. For how long have you been associated with
this work?—So far as the council is concerned, since
the 13th December, 1928.
3355. What form have the experiments taken ?—We
are experimenting in connexion with blue mould
disease.
3356. Are the experiments only in connexion with
that subject, or in connexion with diseases generally?
—They include experiments with diseases generally.
3357. Was there a special reference to blue mould?
—Yes; because of its importance to the tobacco-
growing industry.
3358. What steps have you taken to carry out the
experiments ?—I have prepared a statement for presen-
tation to the committee, and have prefaced it with a
few general remarks upon the constitution of the
Division of Plant Industry. The statement leads up
to our work in connexion with tobacco. The statement
is as follows:
The Division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, of which I have the honour to be chief, is that
which has to do with research into problems concerning plants.
The aim of the division is to augment the agricultural wealth
of Australia by reducing the toll taken by disease and by
improving the quality and yield of the crops. With this in
view, the division has five major sections: —
(a) Plant Introduction and Agrostology.
( b ) Plant Genetics and Breeding.
(c) Plant Pathology.
( d) Plant Nutrition.
(e) Seeds and Poison Plants.
(a) PLANT INTRODUCTION.
This section is engaged in securing from such parts of the
world as are climatically similar plants which are likely to
do well in Australia, and which will add to the crop wealth
of the country. Such are grasses and forage plants suited to
the varying pastoral or dairying areas of Australia. Tobacco
varieties and strains will be sought under this section. Plants
and seeds so introduced are first quarantined and examined
for disease, &c. They are then grown and studied for freedom
from disease, for quality and yield, and the nutritional
requirements therefor. If satisfactory, they are then released
for breeding or for further test in the field, and finally for
propagation.
(b) PLANT GENETICS AND BREEDING.
This has to do with the crossing of plants, development of
new varieties, and so on. The work of determining the mode
of inheritance in crop plants of those qualities which render
them of value falls within the scope of this section. When
we know what factors influence yield, quality or disease
resistance, it is then possible to hybridize suitable parent
stocks so that from the succeeding generations selections mav
be made which possess the desired qualities. These are their
established, multiplied and produced on a commercial scale
for field test. An illustration is the work of Farrer in
connexion with “ Federation ” wheat, which was done twenty
miles south of Canberra.


(o) PLANT PATHOLOGY.
The diseases of plants constitute the field of study of this
section. All crops grown suffer from disease, and it is
generally estimated that the usual loss amounts to about
10 per cent, of the crop. In certain years, and with certain
crops and diseases, the loss is much greater and we have
what is known as an epidemic. This is the case with “ blue
mould ” of tobacco. In addition to this disease, tobacco in
Australia suffers from several virus diseases, and from stem
and root diseases. Not the least important, however, is that
due to unsatisfactory nutritional conditions, which gives rise
to poor quality in texture and aroma. It should be noted
that, throughout the world, tobacco is effected by some 48
diseases all old, but fortunately not all occur in the same
area. In Australia there are two major problems, viz., that
of blue mould, which is pathological, and that of unsuitable
aroma, which is patho-physiological. Together, these two
troubles prevent the proper development of the tobacco-growing
industry in this country.
{d) PLANT NUTRITION.
In the case of the human race, a considerable body of
knowledge is now available concerning diet and food values,
yet investigations continue to bring to light new and
important facts. In the case of plants we know something
of the major nutritional requirements which go to the
development of a normal plant, but there is still much to learn.
A plant requires certain substances for its juvenile growth,
but later, when approaching maturity, i.e., blossoming, seeding
and ripening, there is a change in the balance of essential
substances. If for any reason there is an unbalance in the
first place the plant, which may be likened to a living chemical
laboratory, will respond and the response may be shown by
coarser leaf texture or by smaller leaves, or by an unpleasant
odour on burning and so forth. For example, if too high a
nitrogen ratio is found in a soil-water the tobacco grown
therein will probably have a high protein, &c„ content, and
on curing will be of poor smoking quality. When it comes
to the effects of substances, which are present in soil water
in dilutions of two or three parts per million, we are working
in practically a new field. This is the case with substances
like boron, manganese, copper, zinc, &c., which are now r being
shown to play an important part in the growths of plants and
particularly of types. It must be remembered that the plant
obtains its food supply from two sources, viz., the air and
the soil water. Only those substances which are soluble in the
soil water are available to the plant, and in certain cases not
all of these for the presence of a quantity of one substance
may “ lock up ” another, so that while necessary to the plant,
it is not actually available.
In addition to soil-water constituents, another important
group of factors is embodied in environment. The duration
of sunlight, its intensity and quality, humidity, evaporation
and temperature all come in this category, and all play an
important role in determining the type of plant finally
developed. One might have exactly the same soil conditions,
but variation of the above-noted factors would eventuate in
different types from those same soils.
It follows, that in order to obtain light on the nutritional
and environmental factors which influence a plant, it is
necessary to be able accurately to control all possible factors.
Exact knowledge can be obtained only by exact methods. In
the case of tobacco, for example, not only should types be
grown under controlled conditions, but ' they should be
harvested and cured under controlled conditions, so that when
the final test for smoking quality is made it is known just
what is being smoked.
In order to do this work, and also that on diseases, the
necessary equipment must be available. This includes
laboratory, glass-house and field accommodation. In the
laboratories, the usual equipment for pathological and nutri-
tional investigations is required, but there should also be in
close proximity a small chemistry laboratory with a bio-
chemist in charge. Glass-house space is necessary, because
without it an investigation becomes purely seasonal as only
during the growing season can work on the living plant be
done. With glass-house and field available, work is carried
on practically the year round. Further, it is only under glass-
house conditions that controlled experiments may be arranged
and performed. For this reason a range of glass is required
for the culture of tobacco plants at any time during the year
and in any quantity. Space is also required where plants
may be grown under known conditions of nutrition and light,
humidity and temperature. Further space is essential for the
progress of disease studies, because obviously it is impossible
to grow plants for nutritional investigations and for disease
studies in the same house by reason of the virulence of blue
mould. Such a series of glass-house units would require
heating and lighting, &c.
The work of this division on the blue mould problem
would have been carried considerably further had such glass-
house accommodation and equipment been available. Field
space is required in order that experiment plots may be laid
down both for disease investigations and for nutritional and
breeding studies.
DIVISIONAL PARTICIPATION IN AUSTRALIAN
TOBACCO INVESTIGATIONS.
In view of the fact that the function of the Division of Plant
Industry is to undertake investigations into the problems
of crops it was logical to assume that, while the Australian
Tobacco Investigation Committee was established as a separate
entity, this division was definitely interested in the problems
involved.
In late 1928 it was decided to establish a committee to deal
with technical problems concerning the investigation. This
committee comprised Mr. C. M. Slagg and Dr. B. T. Dickson,
with the possibility of a third member later.
In early 1929 it was arranged, as a result of discussion
by the above committee, that Dr. H. R. Angell, Senior Plant
Pathologist in the Division of Plant Industry, should assume
responsibility for the investigation of the problem of blue
mould of tobacco. Dr. Angell is to give evidence before the
Select Committee on the Tobacco Growing Industry, so I
shall leave him to deal with the details of his work. It is but
just to point out, however, that in late December, 1928, when
I laid the problem before Dr. Angell, we came to certain
conclusions as to the line of investigation to be undertaken.
As the result of following that line for one year, Dr. Angell
has made a very material advance towards the possibility of
the control of blue mould.
Although very definite progress has been made in the
demonstration of the fact that one way in which the disease
is transmitted is in, or on, or with the seed and also the
role of insects in the spread of the disease from seed bed to
seed bed, there remain numerous phases of the problem for
elucidation. Those upon which work is planned or in progress
are:-
1. To determine whether the disease is carried in, or
on, or with the seed and how infection takes place.
2. To determine whether the organism can live over in
the soil or on debris in the soil, and, if so, how seeding
infection occurs from this source.
3. To determine the factors involved in spore dissemina-
tion through the air in order to advise growers as to the
safe distance for planting isolated seed beds.
4. Investigations into the distribution of the organism
in the host-plant.
5. No further work on the role of wild hosts.
(i. Determination of the identity of the organism with
respect to organisms described from South America and
Europe.
7. Possibility that certain local stem-rots may be
another phase of blue mould.
In addition to work on the blue mould disease, this
division is at present engaged in studies of a very important
and difficult group known as “ virus ” diseases. These diseases
are usually very easily spread, and especially so in tobacco.
We have commenced studies of these diseases in anticipation
of the time when much more tobacco will be grown in Aus-
tralia than is the case at present. Mosaic, ring spot and
bunchy top are among those being studied, and especially with
respect to wild and other cultivated hosts.
Stem-rot and root-rot troubles are also being looked into
as time permits.
3359. By Mr. Tully. —l should like you to explain
what you mean by virus diseases?— That is a rather
long story, and takes us back to the beginning of inves-
tigations into plant troubles. We have a number of
diseases, the causes of which are known. We can look
at a plant and say that it is suffering from the kind
of disease which attacks part of a plant. We can
cultivate the organism under artificially-controlled con-
ditions in test tubes or in little dishes such as you saw
the other day. We can actually grow the organism
which causes the disease and grow it under controlled
conditions. We can also change the conditions of its
growth. We can study the whole of the life history
of these organisms. More than that, we can take some
of the material which we have been growing and put
it on or into a healthy plant, and under the controlled
conditions. We can, in a word, reproduce the disease
by artificial inoculation of healthy plants. In other
cases, we find bacteria that cause a number of diseases.
We can isolate the bacteria. We can take it out of
the tissues of the plant, and study it. We can do that
in relation to plants, just as we can do it in relation
to animals and human beings. But there is a very
important group of diseases that we have come to
study, which we have found it impossible to get at in
test tubes, because we cannot see the cause of the
disease. Some of the diseases of this kind attack men
and animals, and others attack plants. It is to the
plant diseases of this nature that we are devoting a


good deal of attention. We have found, however, that
while we cannot see anything which causes these
diseases, we can take the juice from a part of the body
of animal or plant, and pass it through a porcelain
filter. We know that bacteria cannot pass through
the porcelain, which is extremely fine, but we
find that a clear liquid passes through. We
can use this clear liquid to inoculate men, animals, or
plants, and by this means we can reproduce the disease
in a standard time. The trouble is that we do not know
what it is that we inoculate with. All we know is that
we can inoculate and reproduce the disease. Diseases
of this character are known as the virus group. At
present we are unable to say whether the disease is
caused by an organism, so we use the term virus, 'which
really conveys the idea of the w T ord virulent.
8360. It is liquid that you inject?— Yes; hut, of
course, it is something in the liquid that brings about
the infection. So far we are unable to say what it is.
I have looked through the highest-powered microscope
at this liquid, to try to discover some organism, but
have not been able to do so.
3361. So far as you can see there is nothing living
in it ?—That is so.
3362. Yet it must be something virile?-—-Yes. We
have not been able to discover any life; but there
may be life there.
3363. Will the liquid reproduce bacteriological
diseases?—Ho; only virus diseases.
3364. What is the highest power microscope that
you can use for this class of work ?—With a very good
Zeiss w r e can get 2,500 magnifications, but even that
tremendous magnification is not sufficient to enable us
to see anything in the clear liquid that comes through
the porcelain filter. I have actually used a microscope
which gave 3,000 magnifications, but at that point
light problems become difficult. With 3,000 magnifica-
tions there is a certain indefiniteness, whereas with
2,500 magnifications we get a good illumination. Of
course, we are able to see something that is very small;
yet we are unable to find any organism in the liquid.
3365. By the Chairman. —You are not prepared to
say there is some organism in the liquid?—l am
not prepared to say that.
3366. There may be a very minute organism ? —Yes.
With our present scientific knowledge it is unsound to
be too positive, or to dogmatize, about anything. There
may be types of life so minute that we cannot see them
with our present methods of vision. On the other hand,
there is this to be said, that while we do not know
what it is that actually causes the disease, we do know
that we can reproduce the disease, and that it is
extremely easily reproduced in most cases. Take such
a disease as tobacco mosaic. Tobacco mosaic is so
called because of the fact that this particular virus
produces mottled leaves, and a rough corrugated sur-
face. It also results in the lack of growth.
3367. By Mr. Martens. —l suppose the tobacco
mosaic is much the same as cane mosaic?— The
mottling is very characteristic.
3368. The green growth becomes shrivelled? —Yes.
In time it becomes absolutely dead. When you come
across a plant with mottled leaves you can rub your
finger along the hairs on the leaf, and you will find
a sticky substance. If you take your sticky fingers
then and rub them lightly on the leaf of a healthy
tobacco plant you will mix the juices of the two plants,
and the healthy plant will absorb some of the juice of
the other plant.
3369. Impregnation takes place through that act of
rubbing the leaves with the fingers?— Yes; it is not
necessary to crush the leaves. The rubbing wounds
the hairs, and that makes it possible for the juice from
the affected plant to be absorbed in the other plant.
Provided that the atmosphere is not too dry, in from
eight to fourteen days’ time you can go to that healthy
tobacco plant and see an exact reproduction of the
mottling of the diseased plant. This means that the
tobacco-grower, or a man who is working in the fields,
may, in going from row to row, brush a diseased' plant
with his coat, and thereby convey infection to healthy
plants. The infection may be conveyed by a cultiva-
tion tool. If a healthy plant is growing next to a
diseased plant, infection may be conveyed by the wind
bringing the two plants into contact.
3370. By the Chairman. —Would the disease spread
from plant to plant without any intermediary?—Ho,
it must be carried. There must be contact. The con-
tact may be brought about by the leaves rubbing
together, or by a man working in the fields, or by
insects which travel from plant to plant. All that
is necessary is to break the hairs of a diseased plant,
and convey the juice to a healthy plant. Insects
travelling from plant to plant may convey infection,
but this would not be probable in the case of insects
which merely light on a plant, but do not disturb or
break the hairs, and so get their feet entangled in the
diseased juice. But in the case of a sucking insect that
settles on a plant and sticks its proboscis into the plant
for feed, there would be danger of infection. The
sticking in of the proboscis would have something like
the effect of the sticking in of an inoculation needle.
3371. By Mr. Martens.— Would one of those long
green grasshoppers convey infection ?—ln certain con-
ditions, I cannot see any reason why they should not
carry disease; but it is not usual. They chew the
leaves, and there would not be much juice left on them
to convey to another plant.
3372. But they lie very close?— Yes; but they would
not be so dangerous as sucking insects, which are
important, seeing that their proboscis penetrates the
living tissue.
3373. By the Chairman. —I suppose you have
identified a large number of these sucking insects?—
Yes. We are also watching them in relation to tobacco.
3374. You made a reference to the likeness of a plant
to a living chemical laboratory?— Yes; I should like
you to get hold of that idea. All plants—-cabbages,
peas, beans, or tomatoes, and so on —get their food
supply from two sources, air, and water in the soil.
These substances are relatively simple and are
absorbed by the plants. The plants do not absorb from
anywhere at all any complex substance such as nicotine.
But the plant, in its tissues, carries on a regular series
of chemical operations. Every plant is, therefore, a
little chemical laboratory, which is carrying on a
complex building up and breaking down of chemical
substances, the end of which, the potato or the tomato,
as the case may be, or, in the case of the tobacco plant,
contain characteristic qualities. The plants do not
obtain these characteristics from the soil; they
are worked out in the plant itself. But the ability of
the plant to develop these characteristics is affected
by environment, such as temperature, humidity, the
amount, strength, and quality of sunlight, and so on.
Everything in the plant it makes itself, from the simple
substances which it absorbs from the air or the soil-
water, or both.
3375. You mentioned that scientists were now
working in practically a new field in regard
to plant nutrition?— Yes. Up to the beginning
of this century it was thought that such sub-
stances as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, sul-
phur, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium
and iron were the only substances required by a
plant, because in . analysing plants these were
the only ones found to be present. The idea
was, therefore, developed that if we could supply
these chemical substances to a plant in the right pro-
portions we should be able to grow a plant anywhere,
even in a rest tube. This was accepted for a very long


time. But early in this century investigations were
undertaken to ascertain whether this was really so.
When the investigators got these chemicals in absolute
purity they found to their astonishment that, although
they could grow corn or wheat or tomatoes, or other
plants, they could not get them beyond a certain stage,
and could not get them to maturity. They then found
that there were, in the soils, the slightest traces of
such substances as boron, manganese, copper, and so
on. When these missing substances were supplied in
proper proportion the plants grew to maturity. The
amount of these substances that had to be added was
very minute, perhaps only one part to 2,500,000 parts,
but that slight addition made all the difference. These
substances must be present in the soil if success is to be
achieved. If they are not present the plantation suffers
accordingly. The attempt was made to grow oats in
certain parts of South Australia in soil which was
deficient in manganese. The soil had no manganese
whatever. The result was that the oats grown were
chlorotic, stunted, and dwarfed. The addition of a
trace of manganese to the soil made it possible to grow
good oats. The part that these investigations will play
in the development of types is at present uncertain, but
the investigation will no doubt ultimately reveal that
substances like boron play an important part in the
development of plant life.
3376. You made some reference to the duration of
sunlight and so on, and the importance that these
play in plant life? —Yes. Not only the length of time
that the sun is shining, but also the strength of the
ray, and particularly the kind of ray, the intensity of it,
and so on, have a big effect on plant life. You could
have a dozen samples of exactly the same soil, and the
same plants and arrange them in glass houses under
different conditions of light, as to duration, intensity,
and quality, and different conditions of humidity and
evaporation, quite apart from soil content, and the
plants produced from the soil might be so different in
type that you would never recognize them as being
originally the same.
3377. You mentioned that work is being planned to
advise growers as to a safe distance of planting isolated
seed beds? —Yes; we are planning equipment that will
enable us to measure the volume of air passing through
an apparatus. This will involve using a meter by
which we shall be able to measure say 10,000 cubic feet
of air as it passes through the apparatus. We are also
planning a piece of apparatus that will enable us to
gauge the number of spores in the air. If we can
determine the numbers of spores in a given quantity
of air, we can form some idea of the density of them.
It might be that the blue mould is so prevalent in the
tobacco field that a person would breathe the spores in
through his nostrils. If we can gather the data that
we are seeking, we shall be able to say to the grower,
“You must not plant a seed bed within a certain
distance of the place where this disease is known to
exist, or you will be asking for trouble.”
3378. You referred to certain organisms that are
known to exist in South America and Europe?—We
know that a disease similar to blue mould occurs in
South America and Europe. We are anxious to ascer-
tain ivhether the organism is exactly the same. If it
is the same we shall know where we are.
3379. I suppose that in the absence of an adequate
number of plant doctors, to treat plant diseases, it is
a case of the survival of the fittest, just as it used to
be a case of the survival of the fittest of men before
we had a sufficient number of medical practitioners to
treat our diseases? —That would be the case. In nature
it is still a case of the survival of the fittest, but we are
dealing with cultivated crops. In the ordinary pasture,
the plant that cannot stand up to dry conditions, or
that cannot stand being nibbled close to the ground, is
liable to pass out, but in dealing with potatoes, tomatoes,
and tobacco for example, we are dealing with plants
that have been developed horticulturally. Should
disease occur in these plants which have been cultivated
for so long, it might destroy them, although it might
not have destroyed their ancestors.
3380. With cultivated plants, ignorance of disease
and their remedies would naturally lead to the elimina-
tion of the unfit?— Yes; nature will take its course.
3381. By Mr. Jones. —Are virus diseases prevalent
in tobacco plants? —Yes; although I am not in a posi-
tion to say to what extent. I could not say, for
instance, that ten per cent, of the plants are affected by
it. The position is complicated by the presence of blue
mould, which wipes out plants that might otherwise
develop tobacco mosaic. There is no doubt that tobacco
mosaic is present in Australia. I have seen it and so
have Mr. Slagg, Dr. Angell, and others. Ido not
suggest that it is important, economically, at present ;
it may become an important factor with the develop-
ment of tobacco growing. It is not one of the major
problems with which we are at present dealing; but we
must keep it in mind so that if it develops to any great
extent, in say, ten years’ time, we shall know what to
3382. Does your work include experiments in
endeavouring to combat this disease? —The whole aim
of our work in the plant pathology section of the
Division, is to combat disease. If we can prevent the
disease from occurring, we are doing better work than
we should do if we merely told the grower what to do
after the disease has become prevalent. The object of
our pathological division, is to prevent the diseases
from developing. We are trying to develop the kind
of plant which will be able to resist diseases. If we can
do that, a man will be able to plant out his seedlings,
knowing very well that although the crop in certain
areas might have been seriously affected last year, his
new crop will not be affected because his seedlings are
disease-resisting.
3383. You say in your statement, “In Australia
there are two major problems, namely, that of blue
mould, which is pathological, and that of unsuitable
aroma, which is patho-physiological ” ?—I should have
said “ supposed unsuitable aroma ” for, after all, it is
a matter of opinion.
3384. One witness, Mr. Jennings, who was in charge
of the domestic leaf operations for the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company, said that he did not know
of any objectionable aroma in Australian tobacco.—As
I have said, it is purely a matter of opinion, and I am
quite prepared to modify my statement.
3385. By Mr. Tully. —l think Mr. Jennings said
that the American aroma could not be got in any
country outside of America. Is that right?— When I
was talking about nutrition, I said that it was believed
formerly, that only ten elements were essential for the
growth of plants. It has since been found that other
elements are in the soil, such as boron, manganese, and
so on. The Havana leaf has a very characteristic and
delectable aroma, which many connoisseurs consider to
be the best in the world. It will probably be a very
long time before the plant pathologist, or bio-chemist,
will find out what it is that gives the Havana leaf its
characteristic aroma. It is not possible for us to say
much on this aspect of the subject at present.
3386. By the Chairman. —l have smoked samples of
unmanufactured cigar leaf grown in Australia, and
consider it as good as any Havana leaf. Some people
may say it is better. Some of the leaf was grown in
South Australia and some in Queensland. After all
this question of aroma is a matter of opinion?— That
is so. It is probably a very minute difference in some
element of growth that causes the variation. On the
other hand it is a fact that if tobacco is grown under
such conditions that it develops a high protein or nitro-
genous content, you will have in that tobacco no matter


what you may do with it, so high a protein or break-
down protein content, that it will have an unpleasant
aroma and taste.
3387. Is your suggestion of “ unsuitable aroma ” the
verdict of smokers or of experts?—l should say of
smokers.
3388. Have you any data upon which to base the
statement to which Mr. Jones has referred? —Ho; it
is merely an expression of opinion. Probably I should
not have made the remark except that questions of
aroma are patho-physiological. lam certainly pre-
pared to delete that sentence, or to modify it.
3389, Our object is to ascertain the best means of
putting our tobacco-growing industry on a better foot-
ing, and we have been unable to discover any one who
will father the opinion that Australian tobacco is of
unsuitable aroma?—As a matter of fact the statement
is really taken from a basic statement, upon which the
Australian Tobacco Investigation was founded.
3390. It is more or less a mystery to us where this
statement came from ?—I am quite prepared to elimin-
ate it from my evidence.
3391. By Mr. Tally. —ls not tobacco bought on
colour? —That is the case in America.
3392. By the Chairman. —l know a man who, more
or less accidentally, smoked some “ Sunday Best ” to-
bacco, which is an Australian production, and found it
to be so satisfactory that he continued smoking it ?—I
am very glad to hear that. Personally I have, so far,
had nothing to do experimentally with the aroma
problem, I desire to correct the paragraph in
my evidence which relates to unsuitable aroma.
I wish it to read, “In Australia one of the
major problems is that of blue mould, which is patho-
logical. This trouble prevents the proper development
of the tobacco industry in this country.”
3393. It has been suggested to us that the control
of the tobacco investigation should be handed over
completely to the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, and that Mr. Slagg, as an officer of the
Investigation, should become part and parcel of the
business, under the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research and should be made responsible for
the field work. Have you any opinion on that subject ?
—lt seems to me to be a matter of policy. I certainly
think it is logical to place the whole business under
the aegis of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, which should have ample opportunity for
carrying out the work in the speediest and most effec-
tive way possible, and without duplication of
endeavour.
3394. To what extent are the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research and the Australian Tobacco
Investigation Committee co-operating?— Mr. Slagg and
I are members of the technical or research committee,
which is supposed to be in charge of the technical
problems of investigation, the laying out of them, and
the checking of results and so on.
3395. Are you connected with the Executive Com-
mittee?—Ho; that is a point at which I have found
difficulty. I have no connexion with the Executive
Committee, execept through Mr. Slagg, and I have felt
that I should have a definite connexion with it.
3396. Is not the work of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research in relation to tobacco, and
the work of the Tobacco Investigation Committee
closely interrelated?— Yes; on the scientific side
particularly.
3397. By Mr. Tully. —lf you were working together
could you not do better work?— Yes; but the combina-
tion of the two authorities seems to me to involve a
question of policy upon which I would rather not
express an opinion.
3398. By the Chairman. —Have you had any rela-
tions with Dr. Darnell-Smith since you undertook this
investigation ?—Ho.
3399. Has he communicated with you in any way?—
1 cannot recollect having received a letter from him.
3400. Do you furnish him with the results of your
experiments ? —Ho.
3401. Do you forward the results of your experi-
ments to any authority for publication?— Yes; I
forward the results of our work to my executive for
publication in the journal of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research. The details are, of course,
discussed with Mr. Slagg, as a member of the Research
Committee.
3402. By Mr. Jones. —Are the results of your blue
mould experiments likely be of benefit to the growers
in the immediate future ?—We have not discussed that
yet. It is impossible for us to work amongst the
growers, but there is no doubt that the growers are
developing an interest in the subject, and are anxious
for information about it. It would be a mistake,
however, to say too much, too early. We must be
absolutely sure of our position before we offer any
definite advice. Dr. Angell has now come to certain
conclusions, which I think could be given to the
growers almost straight away.
3403. When are they likely to be passed on ? —I can
see no reason why they should not be passed on at once.
That will be a matter for our executive committee to
consider.
The witness withdrew.
Herbert Raleigh Angell, B.Sc.Agr., M.Se., Ph.D.,
Senior Plant Pathologist, Division of Plant
Industry, Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, Canberra, was called, sworn and
examined.
3404. By the Chairman. —How long have you
occupied your present position ?—About fifteen months.
3405. Did you come to Australia specially to take up
that office?— Yes; from the University of Wisconsin.
3406. Are you an American citizen?—Ho; I am
British. I was studying at the University and had
just finished my post graduate course before coming to
Australia.
3407. We understand you have some information to
give the committee in regard to the experimental work
you have done in relation to blue mould ?—Yes. I have
prepared the following statement:—-
(1) BLUE MOULD.
IsTKoarcrrox.
Early in 1929, arrangements were made with the Australian
Tobacco Investigations Committee whereby the investigation
of the blue mould disease of tobacco was to be undertaken
by the Division of Economic Botany of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research. The research committee,
consisting of the Director of Tobacco Investigations and the
Chief of the Division of Plant Industry, later assigned the
problem to Dr. H. E. Angell, Senior ' Pathologist of the
Division.
With a view to becoming acquainted with the disease in
the field, visits were paid to the tobacco-growing districts
around Myrtleford, Victoria; Tamworth, New South Wales;
Mareeba and Herberton, Queensland; and the Experimental
Station at Wahgunyah, Victoria. During these visits, seed
was collected from many farmers who had had blue mould
during the previous season.
Blue mould is one of the principal factors limiting the
expansion of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia. This
disease does not occur in North America, nor in most tobacco-
growing countries. We have been recently informed by cable
that the disease is known in Europe. It is perhaps most
destructive and of greatest economic importance when the
plants are in the seedling stage. Under certain weather
conditions favorable to the rapid development and spread of
the causal organism, beds of seedlings may be entirely
destroyed in a few T days. Sometimes apparently healthy
plants from the beds lightly attacked may be transplanted
in the field, but more often than not they develop the disease


and die within a week or two. This loss of seedlings and
transplants necessitates the growing of successive seed-beds
and several replantings—a series of operations expensive of
time, patience, effort, and money. Should weather and other
conditions be such that young tobacco plants infected with
blue mould are able to survive the initial attack of the
parasite, they may for a time fail to show any of the usual
leaf symptoms of the disease, appear to develop almost
normally, and sometimes may yield good crops.
Sources a.\d Means of Spread of the Disease.
It had been previously observed by others that the fungus
causing blue mould of tobacco lives from one season to
another in diseased over-wintering plants and wild hosts.
Seed of diseased plants shed in the field during the previous
season may also be a source of the disease during the next
season. On such plants the spores of the fungus are pro-
duced in thousands and are spread to the seed-beds in the
vicinity by the wind, insects, and other animals, including
man.
Outbreaks in seed beds in isolated districts cannot be
claimed to be due to the above sources of infection. Our
investigations were, therefore, directed to a study of the seed
sown by the farmers. We found that when seed from North
America was sown at the same time and under the same
conditions as some Australian samples the seedlings from the
latter developed the disease, whereas those from the former
remained healthy until they were deliberately exposed to
infection. Had they not been exposed to infection they would
have remained healthy indefinitely. The logical conclusion
was that the Australian seed used carried the disease in, on,
or in association with it, and would, therefore, have produced
diseased seedlings wherever they were sown. This explains
how the disease occurs in new' districts in which tobacco is
sown for the first time.
The specific instance of the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tions’ plots at Mareeba may be cited. In the 1928-29 season
blue mould appeared in the seed beds in which Australian
seed was sown, and from them it spread to the seedlings
from North American seed. In 1929-30, as a result of our
investigations and recommendations, only North American
seed wns sown and healthy plants were obtained. In this
instance there were no over-wintering plants nor wild hosts,
nor other diseased plants nearby, and consequently the plants
remained healthy throughout the season.
Prevention of the Disease.
In new tobacco-growing districts only seed that was pro-
duced in healthy districts should be sown. No seedlings from
districts in wdiich the disease occurs should be introduced.
Where the disease has become established the success that
may attend the growing of seedlings is problematical unless
each and every farmer strictly observes the following pre-
cautions :
1. All tobacco plains should be ploughed under as soon
as practicable after the crop is gathered. The ploughed
field should be thoroughly inspected at intervals during
the autumn and spring, and all living plants, however
small, destroyed.
2. On account of the shedding of seed from diseased
plants during the late summer and its germination in
the spring, seed beds should be made on new ground.
Volunteer plants growing in the field should be destroyed
as soon as they appear. Another reason for advising
that seed beds should be made on new ground is that the
disease has yet to be proved not to over-winter in the
soil.
3. Only seed from healthy plants from districts
entirely free from blue mould should be sown.
4. No diseased nor suspected seedlings should be
introduced from other districts.
5. Diseased seed beds should be destroyed because they
serve as centres from which the disease spreads to other
seed beds. Contrary to the belief of many growers,
plants do not generally recover from blue mould when
once infected, although they may appear to do so.
6. As it is very unlikely that each and every farmer
in a given district will observe these precautions, it is
recommended that those who wish to make certain of
obtaining healthy seedlings should have their seed beds
removed by as many miles as possible, the further the
better, from other seed beds. Seed from disease-free
districts should be sown.
7. As our investigations on seed transmission are not
yet complete, we cannot recommend that disinfection
should be tried. Healthy tobacco seed can be obtained
at small cost.
8. It must be borne in mind that the investigation
of the blue mould disease is still in progress, and it
may, therefore, be expected that as more is learned other
preventive measures may be recommended. In the light
of our present knowledge, however, we have no reason
to doubt that the means of prevention outlined above
are well founded.

(2) BASAL STEM AND ROOT ROT.
Among the many diseases that have been observed during
the season, a basal stem rot in the Tobacco Investigations
Committee's experimental plot at Mareeba, Queensland,
appears to be one that may be serious in wet seasons. Two
organisms—Rhoma and Colletotrichum —appeared to be
generally associated with the trouble. Pure cultures of these
organisms have been isolated, and their pathogenicity will be
tested as soon as field or greenhouse space and suitable
temperature conditions are available.
(3) VIRUS DISEASES.
Two well-known virus diseases, mosaic and ring spot,
appear to be increasing in economic importance in the Myrtle-
ford district of Victoria. In view' of the great amount of
loss caused by mosaic in the United States of America, it
appears that growers would be well advised to take measures
aiming at its control. Another disease, apparently hitherto
undescribed and provisionally referred to as “ bunchy-top ”
of tobacco, also appears to be due to a virus. Dwarfing of
plants is quite common ■in certain fields. Its cause wall be
investigated as soon as time and opportunity permit.

3408. By Mr. Jones. —When will the publication
you mention as being in the press be available?—l
hope it will be available Within very few months. I
have a copy of the report which I shall submit to the
committee if they desire.
3409. By the Chairman. —You have suggested a
number of measures which could be adopted for the
prevention of blue mould. Are you able to tell the
origin of the disease?—lt has been known for a long
time that it is due to a fungus, which is a parasitic
plant.
3410. But the origin of the fungus seems to be a
mystery still?-—The fungus is present in plants which
over-winter in the soil, in wild hosts, and in volunteer
plants. The disease is also found in, on, or in associa-
tion with, the seed. Consequently if it is desired to
prevent blue mould from occurring these over-winter-
ing volunteer plants and wild hosts should be
destroyed, and clean seed used. Wild hosts have not
been found in the tobacco-growing districts of Aus-
tralia, and they are consequently not so very important.
The wild hosts are known as A icotiana glauca, and
Xicotiana suaveolens.
3411. What is the popular name for those plants?—
One is known as native tobacco and the other as wild
tobacco. Yo other wild hosts harbour the fungus so
far a.s we know.
3412. By Mr. Jones. —Are these plants prevalent in
Victoria ? —They do not, to the best of my knowledge,
grow in the tobacco-growing districts of Victoria, but
Nicotiana. glauca and Nicotiana suaveolens have been
found within 40 miles of Melbourne. In Victoria there
is practically no danger from this source. In the
tobacco-growing districts, the main thing is to use clean
seed and to destroy the volunteer and over-wintering
plants that grow in most farmers’ fields.
3413. By the Chairman. —lf these precautions are
taken, do you think that that ivould be fairly effective ?
—Yes.
3414. Do not the spores live in the soil and might
they not affect plants, even if the precautions you
suggest are taken?—We have not yet been able to get
any positive results in that connexion. I have tried
on quite a few occasions to infect plants by putting
diseased plants away to rot and mixing up the debris
with soil, but I have not yet been able to get any
definite evidence from the experiments that the fungus


lives in the soil. There is still a doubt about it, how-
ever, and it would be advisable for the farmers to aow
their seed in new ground which has not grown tobacco
before.
3415. Let me get this clearly: In your opinion it
would be a wise precaution for the tobacco-grower, in
the present incomplete stage of investigation, not to
attempt to grow this year’s seedlings in last year’s
soil ?—Yes.
3416. By Mr. Tylly. —You suggest that new ground
should be used for the seed? —Yes; there is new ground
available for growing seedlings on nearly every farm.
3417. By the Chairman. —Some growers keep on
growing in the same soil, year after year?— That is a
great mistake in regard to seedlings. From the point
of view of modern agricultural practice it is also a
mistake.
3418. Do you consider that the regulation of tem-
peratures in the seed beds would give any measure of
protection against blue mould? —The measures I have
indicated, which are much simpler than the regulation
of temperature in a seed-bed, will be quite sufficient
if they are faithfully followed. If these measures are-
followed there will be no sources of inoculum present,
and if there is no inoculum, temperature does not
matter, as no infection from blue mould can obtain.
3419. The growers are under the impression that it
is largely a matter of temperature and air. They have
told us that they have had nice seed beds coming along
well, and a cold snap or rain has apparently had the
effect of introducing blue mould? —If the fungus were
not present it would not matter how many cold snaps
occurred.
3420. You say that the spores must be present for
the cold snap to have had any affect? —The spores are
present in the air; a change of temperature could not
create them. The fungus is present on diseased over-
wintering or volunteer plants, or in, on, or in associa-
tion with the seed.
3421. Certain experiments were carried out by the
Yew South Wales Department of Agriculture at
Bathurst some years ago in regulating the temperature
in seed beds in glass houses by means of electricity,
and blue mould was practically eliminated? —Extreme
regulation of temperature may have the effect of kill-
ing the spores but it may also kill the seed, or the
plants, in which case the remedy may be worse than
the disease.
3422. Have you conducted any experiments in
regard to the regulation of temperature in the seed
beds?—So far we have no apparatus for doing it.
3423. What apparatus would you need? —Green
houses, which are also known as glass houses. We
shall need two of these at least.
3424. What would they cost? —I have no definite
figures, but they are fairly expensive. They will
probably cost £14,000.
3425. What would they consist of?—I am thinking
of green houses equipped with temperature and
humidity control apparatus.
3426. Do you consider that these are essential for the
purpose of carrying out investigations in regard to
temperature and humidity?— Absolutely.
3427. Where do you think they should be built?—
At Canberra. They should be close to our laboratories.
3428. By Mr. Tally. —Would it be difficult to get an
exact estimate of the cost? —We have had an estimate
of the cost of green houses, with suitable apparatus, for
the division of plant industry.
3429. Would you require these green houses solely
for your tobacco investigations, or could you use them
for other investigations?—We need them for the gen-
eral purposes of the Division,
3430. By Mr. Jones. —Do you suggest that the
farmers should not grow two consecutive crops of
tobacco on the same land? —I was referring only to the
seedlings. If you start with a diseased seedling, you
will get a diseased plant.
3481. By the Chairman. —lf you get a disease-free
seedling, is it not liable afterwards to contract blue
mould? —The plants are not liable to the same
extensive destruction.
3432. By Mr. Jones. —lf healthy seedlings are put
into land where there may be spores, would the plants
be affected? —In the light of our present knowledge,
they would not become affected.
3433. In your statement you say that in 1929 at
Mareeba, seed beds in which Australian seed was sown
were affected with blue mould, and that it spread from
them to the seedlings from Yorth America. But in
1929-30 only Yorth American seed was sown and
healthy plants were obtained. If Australian seed had
been sown the second year, is it not likely that healthy
plants would have been obtained? —Yot if the seed
carried the disease with it. The American seed was
free from the disease. The blue mould infection came
to the American plot of seedlings from the Australian
seedlings.
3434. We had evidence at Wangaratta from a man
who had been growing tobacco for 28 years, that he
planted seed and the plants were free from blue mould,
but the following year he used the same seed, and the
seed beds were destroyed by the disease ?—I have no
doubt that he had neighbours who were growing
tobacco, and that the blue mould came from them.
The disease can be spread by means of air or by in-
sects, or by animals or by man himself. It is of no
use to take steps to prevent infection from one of these
sources and to take no steps in regard to the others.
You must have healthy seed to begin with, and you
must see there is no danger of infection from over-
wintering or volunteer plants or wild hosts.
3435. If a growler had seed which grew healthy
plants one year, w T ould he not be justified in assuming
that he could grow healthy plants from the same seed
next year?— Yes.
3436. If he had blue mould the following year he
could not blame the seed?—No; he should blame his
neighbours.
3437. Would you care to express any opinion in
regard to the aroma of tobacco?—Yo; my investiga-
tions are wholly and solely in relation to disease.
3438. Could you tell us what species of fungus it is
that causes blue mould ?—lt is a species of Peronospora.
This species attacks only Nicotiana tohaccum, Nicotiana
rusiica, Nicotiana glauca , and Nicotiana s-uaveolens.
3439. Is the disease known in the tobacco-growing
districts outside of Australia?— According to a cable
that we have just received, it is known in Europe.
3440. By Mr. Slagg. —ls the disease known in
America ?—lt is not known in America at present-
Some years ago is occurred during one season in a
certain district in Florida. It has not been found
since then.
3441. Is it not a fact that we have our first descrip-
tion of this disease from California?— The fungus was
reported on Nicotiana glauca , but not on tobacco.
3442. Is it not a serious disease in the Argentine?—
Yot on tobacco, so far as I know. We do not know
whether the organism in South America is the same
as this organism.
3443. By Mr. Jones. —ln regard to tobacco, this
disease is peculiar to Australia? —It is best known in
Australia; but it has been reported by cable from
Europe.
3444. By Mr. Tally. —ls it known in France?—lt
has not been reported from France. It is not known in
South Africa.


3445. By the Chairman. —Have you any objection to
your statement of to-day being made available to the
growers immediately ?—Ho; provided the recommenda-
tions concerning prevention are given in detail.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Mervyn Slagg, M.Sc., Director of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, was recalled and
further examined.
3446. By the Chairman. —We understand that you
desire to make a statement in regard to the Research
Committee of the Tobacco Investigation?— Yes. The
procedure in relation to the Tobacco Investigation and
the Executive Committee has been that the report of
the Research Committee meetings has been made
jointly by Dr. Dickson and myself. This report has
then been submitted by me, as chairman of the
Research Committee, at the next following Executive
Committee meeting. We have discussed several times
in our Executive Committee meetings the advisability
of having Dr. Dickson in attendance; but it has so
happened that he has not been in Melbourne or Sydney
at the time of an Executive Committee meeting. We
hope that it may be possible to hold an Executive
Committee meeting at some time when he may be able
to be present. The present contact of the Research
Committee with the Executive Committee is through
the Director of Tobacco Investigation.
3447. Do you have any relations with Dr. Darnell-
Smith in this investigation?— Yes.
3448. To what extent? —Dr. Darnell-Smith was
chosen by the Executive Committee as the technical
member of it. As such, he is supposed to advise the
Executive Committee on all technical and research
matters. As director of the investigation, I have been
in close contact with Dr. Darnell-Smith, and he has
been of assistance to me in a great many ways.
3449. What form has the contact taken? Has it
been by consultation, or meetings in Sydney and
Melbourne, or merely by letter?—ln all three ways.
3450, Is he actually taking a serious interest in the
investigation ?—I feel sure that he is.
3451. What we want to find out is whether he is
performing any useful function for the £250 a year
which he is receiving?— Dr. Darnell-Smith’s primary
relation is to the Executive Committee. He is only
related to the Research Committee in a secondary way.
But since he has lived in Australia for a great many
years, and had contact with plant work, and in addition
had a great deal of interest in tobacco investigation
work, I have consulted with him in regard to practically
all experimental work that has been under way, and
particularly the work that has been in hand at present
in Hew South Wales and Queensland.
3452. He did not appear to be able to give us any
definite idea in Sydney of what investigations were in
hand. He seemed to be hazy about the whole business?
—Dr. Darnell-Smith’s relation is to the Executive
Committee, under whose immediate supervision I am.
3453. Can you tell us on how many occasions you
have had personal interviews with Dr. Darnell-Smith
since you came to Australia?— Probably on twenty
occasions. Whenever Igo to Sydney I call upon him,
and he has been present at nearly all the committee
meetings that have been held in Melbourne.
3454. Do you attend the committee meetings?— Yes.
The meetings are held every two months. But
recently, on account of the inability of either the chair-
man or vice-chairman to be in attendance, w r e have not
been able to hold them quite regularly,
3455. Do you confer with any of the State tobacco
experts ?—Y es.
3456. With whom?—-With all the experts in the
States in which tobacco is grown. In Hew South Wales
I am in touch with Mr. Tregenna, in Victoria with
Mr. Temple Smith, in South Australia with Messrs.
Scott and Opie, and in Western Australia with Mr.
Clifton.
3457. Are they all tobacco experts ?—Hot in the case
of South Australia and Western Australia. Tobacco
culture in those States comes under the control of the
Departments of Agriculture, and the gentlemen I have
mentioned are in close touch with what has been done.
They have done excellent work in the last two years.
3458. When will the first three years of tobacco
investigation in Australia conclude?—On Ist July.
3459. When does your three-year term expire?—On
16th January next.
3460. Have you had any conversation with the
Executive Committee about your future? —I have had
no official communication with them at all.
3461. Are you prepared to continue with them if you
are invited to do so? —It would depend upon the
facilities that are made available, and the form of
organization that the work takes.
3462. And, I suppose, on the terms offered you?—
Yes.
3463. Could you leave Australia now and say, “ I
have done three years of very useful work and have
put the tobacco-growing industry on a very sound
footing ” ?—I could not go so far as that,
3464. Mr. Gepp told us that it would take ten years
to get anywhere with these investigations. Would you
subscribe with that view?— Yes; even ten years might
not be long enough.
3465. I suppose you would not expect to get any-
where in less than ten years? —It is rather difficult to
set a time limit. All the work done in a laboratory or
in a glass-house has later to be tried out in a field.
It has been demonstrated many times that the field
environment may be sufficiently different from the
glass-house and laboratory environment to prevent the
achievement of the expected results. Tobacco is par-
ticularly sensitive to changes of environment and
other conditions.
3466. You have heard the proposal that the Tobacco
Investigation work should be transferred wholly to the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research?— Yes.
3467. If that were done you would be under the
control of the Council. How does that proposal appeal
to you?—lt seems to me to be logical and practical,
if the Executive Committee should cease to function for
any reason.
3468. Is it not a fact that the Executive Committee
is at present merely a kind of supervising authority,
and that the actual field work is being done by you,
and the laboratory work by the officers of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research taking over the
gatioual work is under my supervision. The Executive
Committee merely deals with matters of policy and
finance.
3469. Could those matters of policy and finance be
satisfactorily conducted if the proposed change were
made?—l should think it could be done.
3470. There is a risk, of course, if such a transfer is
made, that the work of tobacco investigation may
become a mere side-line of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, and we desire to guard against
that ?—There should be no difficulty in the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research taking over the
tobacco investigation as a unit. Tobacco is rather a
peculiar crop, in that it exhibits many phases which
ordinary crops do not exhibit. If the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research took over the investi-
gation, it should be as a definite unit. At present we
are co-operating with the Division of Plant Industry,
in our investigations into blue mould. I can see
no difficulty in co-operating with other branches of the
council. We also wish to co-operate with the Division
of Entomology. Many insect pests afflict tobacco plants,


and excellent work could be carried out in this direc-
tion. . The .Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research is also.investigating.Soil problems. Professor
Prescott is doing valuable work in this respect in
Adelaide. We might be able to co-operate in that
connexion.
3471. We have to be sure that there is an organiza-
tion behind the tobacco investigation if it is passed over
to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
to guard against its becoming anaemic and dying of
sheer inanition. Can you suggest any form that such
an organization should take? —-It seems to me that the
investigation should have some head officer, with as
much experience as possible, in all branches of tobacco
work and research. Unless there is some provision of
this kind tobacco investigation may become a sub-
sidiary interest of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research, and not much good might come
from it.
3472. We would like you to suggest, if you could,
some sort of practical executive committee Avhich Avould
take the place of the present body? —I should say that
the chairman of such a body should be the chairman
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
3473. Would you adAmcate a representative of the
groAA^ers?—l would rather say some outstanding repre-
sentative of scientific agriculture.
3474. Why not a representative of the groAvers?—
A representative of the might be placed on
such a. committee, provided a man could be found Avdio
Avas truly representatHe of all the different States and
Avould be satisfactory to them all. There might be a
practical difficulty there; but certainly such a man
would be a logical addition.
3475. If avc had an executive consisting of- the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, your-
self, and a representative of the growers, Avould that
be sufficient? —I should like to see a representative of
the tobacco manufacturers on it.
3476. They might not Avant to be represented?—At
the same time, it Avould be a good thing if we could get
them on it. I am looking at it from all angles with
the object of doing the best for the industry.
3477. Is there any other point on which you would
like to give evidence at this stage V —Something was
said about the aroma of tobacco: I Avish to make it
quite clear to the committee that so far as our investi-
gations haA r e gone up to the present, we are able to say
that a number of factors can influence aroma. Some
of these are innate in the plant itself. Some are
inherent in certain types of tobacco. These types
produce a certain characteristic aroma, no matter
where they are grown, or under what conditions.
3478. By Mr. Jones. —Are you referring to an
objectionable aroma? —Hot necessarily.
3479. Well, an unsuitable aroma?—l am talking par-
ticularly of types of tobacco grown in different parts
of the Avorld AAdiich have reproduced characteristic
aromas, no matter Avhat their environmental conditions,
soil, and climate have been. Our experiments in Aus-
tralia have indicated quite definitely that soil is a very
important factor. Eor instance, we have different
soils side by side at Bathurst. We have tobacco
groAving in American soil, in Australian soil, and in
plain sand Avith certain fertilizing ingredients added.
The American soil has produced tobacco Avith an
American aroma, the Hew South Wales soil has pro-
duced tobacco Avith a Hew South Wales aroma, and the
soil Avhich had no nutriment in it at all-—it was sand
taken from 50 feet below the surface, to Avhich we
have introduced fertilizing elements —has produced
tobacco Avith a quite different aroma from the other
two. More than that, we have evidence at present that
Ave can influence aroma by planting tobacco in some
of the rich river-bottom soils in Australia, by the
addition of certain types of fertilizing ingredients.
This, of course, is only an indication at present. We
are carrying out some preliminary field tests this year
which should provide further information. In addition
to soils, which we have found to be far and away more
important than climate, we recognize there are a great
many more factors which influence aroma in tobacco;
and some of these factors we may be able to control
with the help of the grower. By proper methods of
culture, handling and curing, it may be possible to
greatly improve the aroma of tobacco in the present
tobacco-growing districts. The point I wish to make
is that many factors influence aroma, of which soil is
probably the most important.
3480. Would you say that there is any characteris-
tically unsuitable or objectionable aroma in Australian
tobacco?— That is a matter of opinion. We have made
thousands of tests, and have come to recognize a
characteristic aroma in tobacco that is grown in Hew
South Wales, and at Myrtleford, in Victoria, which
may or may not be objectionable according to one’s
point of vieiv. It is a stronger aroma and quite dif-
ferent from anything we have noted in any other
tobacco.
3481. Is it a fact that the manufacturers take tobacco
from different districts, say, from Myrtleford, Victoria,
and Tumut, Hew South Wales, and mix it together for
marketing as one brand of tobacco?—l do not think
they mix Myrtleford and Tumut tobacco, for Myrtle-
ford tobacco goes principally to Melbourne and Tumut
tobacco to Sydney.
3482. Well, shall Ave say Myrtleford and King
tobacco ?—They Avould go together.
3483. And be sold as one brand? —Yes. We find
very little aromatic difference between Myrtleford and
King River tobacco.
3484. What about Pomonal tobacco?— That -is in
quite a different class. I can arrange for the com-
mittee to inspect and test different varieties in Mel-
bourne if they desire to do so.
3485. Smokers do not seem to have discovered any
unsuitable or objectionable aroma in Australian
tobacco?—We have discovered that there are a number
of different aromas in tobacco groAvn in different parts
of Australia. Some are not as pleasant as others,
according to one’s taste. Tobacco groAvn in certain
districts is milder and more agreeable than tobacco
groAvn in other districts. I am not prepared to say
that any tobacco groAvn in Australia is Avholly objec-
tionable. Even in the tobacco groAvn in the heaviest
soil in the Myrtleford or Tam worth districts, a certain
proportion of the leaf may be quite mild and not
objectionable. The aroma of tobacco depends upon
the texture of the leaf to a marked degree. This is
particularly true of districts in Victoria and Hew
South Wales. The thickness of the leaf has a good
deal to do with the quality and aroma which tobacco
exhibits. As pointed out in Ho. 2 bulletin, we find
that a percentage of the crop is quite unsaleable. The
final test, of course, is in the manufacture and sale of
tobacco. The final test Avould be the smoker. The best
avc can do is to develop something Avhich we think is
good, and try to get the public to take it.
3486. Did you try the Australian ciragrettes that
were submitted to the committee?— Yes.
3487. What did you think of them?—l thought they
were quite mild. We have a number of cigarettes of
various kinds made up; I should like the committee
to try them.
3488. By Mr. Tully. —Do you think it Avould be pre-
mature to make available to growers Dr. Angell’s pro-
nouncements this morning in respect of blue mould? —
Hot at all. I think pronouncements of that kind
should be made as quickly as possible providing they
are not premature.


3489. By the Chairman.-—Axe. you taking any part
in the distribution of such information to the growers?
—Yes. We have prepared several bulletins, but we
have not been able to do as much in that direction as
we should like to do.
3490. Some of the growers we have met have never
heard of the bulletins. Have you taken steps to get a
list of the people actually growing tobacco in Aus-
tralia?— Yes. We have also written to the secretary or
president of each tobacco-growers’ association to the
effect that these bulletins will be available, and they
will'be sent free of cost to any tobacco-grower who
applies for them. A large number of bulletins have
been sent out in this way. We feel, however, that the
main function of the Tobacco Investigation is in field
and laboratory work, and that direct contact with
growers should be a function of the State experts.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Stawell, Victoria.)
MONDAY, 14th APRIL, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr, Tully.
(Mr. W. W. R. Swinson, representing the British
Australasian Tobacco Company; Mr. C. M. Slagg,
representing the Australian Tobacco Investigation;
Mr. M. Murphy, representing the Pomonal
Tobacco-growers Association; Mr. Temple Smith,
Tobacco Expert, Department of Agriculture,
Victoria.)
Michael Murphy, tobacco-grower, Pomonal; President,
Pomonal Tobacco Growers’ Association, was called,
sworn and examined.
3491. By the Chairman.- —Are you a tobacco grower?
—Yes.
3492. How long have you been growing it? — For
about eight years.
3493. How many members are there in your associa-
tion ?—About sixteen.
3494. What has been your experience in the grow-
ing of tobacco during the last eight years ?—ln the first
year I planted out about a quarter of an acre as an
experiment, and it was a success.
3495. Did you get a good price for it?— Yes, about
£l7 for the lot.
3496. Have you been flue-curing all the time?—
Yes; but I did not cure that crop; it was cured in a
neighbour’s barn. I put up a barn in 1924 at a cost,
excluding labour, of about £60..
3497. What building materials were used?—Mal-
thoid inside and iron outside.
3498. Have you found that sort of barn satisfactory
for flue-curing?— Yes. I think we cure about as good
a tobacco as is cured in the district.
3499. Did the tobacco expert have a look at your
barn when it was built?— Both Mr. Temple Smith and
Mr. Marks, but particularly the latter, when we
started, spent a good deal of time in the district in-
structing us in the curing of tobacco.
3500. Did they approve of that type of barn?—
We built the barn according, to the specifications that
were supplied to us.
3501. Have you used that barn all through ?—Yes.
3502. Did you extend your area in the second year?
-I think that we put in a small quantity. In 1924,
when we. built our barn, we had about three acres
under crop,
3503, What have-you this, year?— About gix acres.
3504. You have never had any more than that
quantity ?—No.
3505. What yield do you get, on an average? —
Between 600 lb. and 700 lb. to the acre.
3506. Do any of your neighbours get a better aver-
age, or is that the average for the district?— For light
leaf that would be the average; with heavier leaf,
grown on darker soil, there would be a greater yield.
3507. Is the soil at Pomonal light or dark? —It is
mostly light.
3508. Have you ever heard of any man getting half
a ton to the acre? —We have got half a ton in patches.
3509. Have you ever heard of any man getting a
ton? —No.
3510. Do you go in for irrigation?—No; but one
grower at Pomonal has done a little irrigating.
3511. Has it improved his yield?— This is the first
year that he has irrigated, and his tobacco is still in
the field.
3512. Previously all the growers did without irriga-
tion? —Yes.
3513. What is your rainfall? —The average is about
28 inches.
3514. Do you consider that that average rainfall
on light sandy soil is quite sufficient without irriga-
tion?—-There is no question that we would do better
with irrigation.
3515. What prices have you been getting?— Very
good prices.
3516. Who is your buyer?— Mr. Lough.
3517. Does lie criticize your tobacco much? —He
does if he thinks that it deserves it.
3518. If he tells you in any year that your leaf
is not a good colour, that there are faults in the curing,
or that you have harvested it before it is ready for
curing, do you take notice of that? —We have to.
3519. From your knowledge of the growers at
Pomonal do you think that year by year they are try-
ing to improve the quality of their leaf ? —I think that
some of them are.
3520. Do you know of any who are not?— Some
growers will never make tobacco.
3521. Aie they careless or indifferent, or just stupid?
Some growers may be pigheaded, and consider that
they can grow a light leaf on dark soils. That cannot
be done.
3522. They will not take notice of what anybody
else tells them?— That is so.
3523. Do the other growers try to reason with them?
It is a pretty hard thing to tell some people.
3524. Yo have meetings of your association, do you
not? —Yes.
3525. Do you not discuss problems there? —Yes.
3526. Some of these men attend, I presume; do you
not try to convince them that they are on the wrong
lines?—We do. But take it in another way: If I had
a paddock of tobacco, and was making a success of it,
and you had over the road a paddock which was more
or less a failure and you, consequently, had trouble
with the buyers, do you think that I w r ould have to
tell you?
3527. But these meetings provide an opportunity for
the men who are successful to take in hand the unsuc-
cessful ones; because, if you have a percentage of
growers who, through ignorance or stupidity, wilfully
produce bad stuff, do they not keep the district back ?
—But often the other chap thinks that he is doing a
better job than you are.
. 3528 . By Mr. Tull/y.- —But .do not the results prove
that the opposite is the case?— You will have to change
human nature before you wall be able to cope with that
sort of thing.
3529, By Mr. Martens. —Is this class composed of
our own people—British people ?—I should say that the
worst growlers are not our own people.


3530. They are difficult to deal with?— Very difficult.
They will tell you how T they grew tobacco in, say,
Macedonia, or some other foreign country; and it does
not matter who comes along —Mr. Lough, Mr. Temple
Smith, or anybody else —they will tell them the same
thing.
3531. By the Chairman. —Southern Europeans who
have grown tobacco in other countries think that they
know all about it, and have a contempt for the methods
that you have adopted here?— That is correct.
3532. Has your association taken any steps to reason
with these men and to get them to adopt up-to-date
methods?—l have, but it is useless. There is only one
way to deal with them, and that is not to buy their
tobacco.
3533. What is the average price that you have
received?—l think that last year my crop averaged
about 2s. 6d. a pound. I had a shade over a ton.
3534. Was it nearly all light tobacco? —Yes. I
suppose that the buyer would call it light mahogany;
and probably the poorer quality he would class as
inferior bright.
3535. Have you noticed year after year an improve-
ment in the colour of your leaf?— Sometimes the
colour is better; it depends a good deal on the nature
of the season. Rainfall has an effect on the curing of
the tobacco. Although you may try to improve the
quality, in the following year your tobacco will be a
little harsher.
3536. In the course of eight years has there not been
a steady and noticeable improvement in the colour and
quality of the tobacco grown at Pomonal ?—I think that
there has been. You can always grow a good colour
tobacco on light soil.
3537. What steps are the growers here taking to
ascertain the best varieties to grow?—We have prac-
tically been under the guidance of the Department of
Agriculture in trying out different varieties and curing
them in the barns. Since Mr. Slagg took charge of
the federal investigation he has brought new varieties
into the district, and some of them ai*e turning out
a very fine type of leaf, superior to some of the old
varieties.
3538. Do the State tobacco experts visit you once a
year ?—Sometimes they have been up here once a
month. We haA r e had more visits from them than
a few other districts.
3539. When things are not going well, do you send
for them? —Yes. We have had no trouble Avhatever.
Mr. Slagg has been just as helpful as the Department
of Agriculture.
3540. You have been satisfied Avith the prices you
have receiA-ed?—There has been nothing wrong with
them.
3541. Do you consider that an average of 2s. 6d. a
pound, year in, year out, will pay you ?—lt will do me.
3542. By Mr. Jones. —That is, including the bonus?
—Oh, yes.
3543. By the Chairman. —Have you worked out the
cost of production?—lt runs into about £3O an acre.
But A\e do all our own work. We might have an odd
man for a day.
3544. You do your own curing?— Last year three of
us worked all our tobacco on a co-operative basis, each
helping the other in turn. The other two were Mr.
Anderson and Mr. Robson. We cured all our
tobacco.
3545. There is no arrangement whereby, if you cure
for another man, he pays you so much?—He does not
pay us; each one helps the other.
3546. Have you found that the other growers are
dissatisfied Avith the prices they are receiving?—l
should say that more than 90 per cent, of the people
in our district are satisfied.
3547. Do they all average the same price, or do you
get a better price than most? —Some growers have got
even better prices than I have; but they have deserved
it.
3548. Does the buyer complain about the aroma of
your leaf? —Sometimes the buyer says that the aroma
is not right.
3549. How does he ascertain that; does he smell it?
—Yes, I think that they can tell all right by the smell.
3550. He does not submit it to any smoking test cm
the farm? —Ho. At the present time in our district
there is a good number of men who, probably owing to
economic reasons, are smoking only raw Pomonal
tobacco leaf. I have seen them cutting up the raw
leaf. The Greeks smoke nothing but the raw leaf.
3551. Have you ever tried any of it yourself?—l do
not smoke.
3552. Have any tests been carried out on the farms,
under your own observation, by the buyer or any
experts, to give an idea as to the smoking qualities of
the leaf?— The smoking quality of tobacco is open to
so much prejudice that I have always had my doubts
about tests.
3553. If you did see tests made you would not be
satisfied that they were conclusive ?—I have tested
people out myself. I gave a man some tobacco that
he thought was Pomonal tobacco, and he said that it
burned his tongue and throat; in fact, he looked ill.
That tobacco was taken from a plug of light Have-
lock manufactured by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company. On the following day that man w*as
handed that same plug of tobacco, and he said, “ When
you can manufacture tobacco like this in Australia I
shall smoke it ”. I had a tobacconist’s business for a
while, some 30 years ago, and sold a good deal of
tobacco. We used to cut up tobacco; there was uo
“ fine cut ” in those days, and we chopped it Avith the
chopper. We called it our mixture. Men used to buy
the mixture who could not smoke the plug; yet it Avas
the plug tobacco chopped up !
3554. Have you any idea of extending your tobacco
activities?—l am more in favour of people groAving a
small acreage, pretty A\ T ell AAffiat they can handle them-
selves.
3555. It is profitable if you can handle it yourself?—
Yes.
3556. Have you any sons that you employ? —I have
a son who is now engaged in fruit-growing, but he and
his wife help with the tobacco-growing.
3557. Does he do any curing?— Yes, he helps to cure.
3558. Did you learn to cure without any instruction
from the experts?—We could not have done it without
their assistance; some one had to show us.
3559. Do you now find that you can manage the
curing ?—Yes.
3560. You can turn out a good barn? —Yes, fair.
3561. Would you say that, if you had more pro-
ficiency in curing, you Avould turn out a much better
leaf? —Yes, I think that you Avant a lot of scientific
knowledge and a fair amount of training to be an
expert curer. Any one can cure tobacco up to a cer-
tain point, but there is in it something that is a little
beyond the average grower.
3562. If you could acquire that little extra skill do
you think it would make a great difference in the
quality of the tobacco turned out?—l am sure that it
would. My son does a slightly better job than I do.
3563. Your argument, then, is that different curers
will get different results?— Yes.
3564. By Mr. Martens. —From the same leaf? —Yes.
Grading is supposed to play a A r ery prominent part
in the industry, but there is not such a lot in the
grading if you have the right leaf. In 1927 the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company took to Mel-
bourne the sons of some of the growers in various parts
of the State, to teach them to grade tobacco, and mine


was one of those selected. He spent four or five weeks
in Melbourne, and was paid the company’s ruling rate
of wage. He was very much against the company
when he went to Melbourne, but after having handled
the tobacco there, he came back and gave an address to
our growers, and I think he surprised them greatly
by his criticism of tobacco that even Mr. Lough buys.
3565. By the Chairman. —Did he suggest to the
growers that Mr. Lough was really a benefactor to them
in many ways ?—A philanthropist.
3566. In the last few years has the area under
tobacco at Pomonal increased very much? —It is
steadily increasing. More men are now taking up resi-
dence at Pomonal and growing tobacco.
3567. Is there very much more light sandy soil avail-
able? —A great deal of it. It is estimated that there
are somewhere about 100 acres now under crop.
3568. By Mr. Martens. —What is the average value
of land at Pomonal?—ln some parts where they are
now growing tobacco you probably would not be able to
buy the land. It would not do to tell you what we
want for a piece of land that we have there. We
would not think of selling it. You might be able to
buy land uncleared for about £7 an acre round about
the district.
3569. By Mr. Morgan.- — What Avould be the clearing
cost ?—lt would cost about £l2 an acre to clear it.
3570. By the Chairman. —Would you say that the
prohibitive price you want for your land is due to your
opinion of its value for tobacco-growing?— Yes, that is
the only reason.
3571. Has your association discussed an organized
marketing scheme, such as the establishment of a
central grading depot?—We are not in favour of it.
3572. You prefer the buyer to go to your property
and take the stuff off it ?—Undoubtedly. One objection
against a central barn is that it would take from the
grower portion of his income. We might send our
tobacco to a central grading depot, and it might not
be bought, and we should have had to incur the expense
of paying someone to handle it. In my opinion, the
present method of buying cannot be improved on. The
buyers will go many miles to buy just one bale of
tobacco from a grower.
3573. So long as that system is continued by the
buyer, you do not think that it can be improved upon?
—I do not.
3574. But if the buyer suddenly discarded that
system and decided that you should take your tobacco
to him, would you consider the wisdom of having a
central grading depot?—We should have to do it then.
3575. You would favour the establishment of a
central grading depot, or a grading depot of any kind,
only if the buyer refused to buy your tobacco on the
farm? —Yes. I believe that it wmuld be easier for the
buyer if he could buy from a central place; but it
would not be so good for the grower.
3576. By Mr. Martens. —Are there representatives of
any other companies who try to buy tobacco in your
area ?—Ho.
3577. Do you think that it would be an advantage
to you as an association if there were other buyers?—
It might; lam not sure on that point. I think that
while you have one buyer he is able to charge the
public as much as he likes; but if buyers start to put
one another they might start to cut the grower’s price.
3578. By the Chairman.— ls it a fact that, before
you started to grow 7 tobacco at Pomonal, land was
selling for as low as 325. 6d. an acre?— That is true.
There was any amount of scrub-growing land that you
could have bought for 10s. an acre.
3579. Did not the fruit industry enhance its value
to anv extent ?—Fruit is a pretty doubtful proposh
tion.
3580. Then the fruit industry practically proved of
no value in enhancing the value of the land; hut as
soon as you started to grow tobacco, and it looked as
though you could make more money, the value shot up
to a prohibitive extent? —Yes, it is the tobacco that has
put the value on the land.
3581. Would you say that the majority of the people
at Pomonal would want £lOO an acre for their tobacco
land to-day ? —I do not know; you might buy it cheaper
than that. But we would not take that for our
ground. Others who are growing tobacco might sell
for £7 an acre.
3582. If you heard that somebody had sold for £lOO
an acre would you think it a ridiculous price to pay ?
I should be astonished if our particular block was sold
for £lOO an acre.
3583. By Mr. Jones. —What percentage of bright
leaf would you say is grown at Pomonal ?—My own has
been practically all bright leaf.
3584. By the Chairman. —According to the prices
paid you by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
over the last four years, you have averaged 80 per cent,
of bright leaf, including all grades?— Yes.
3585. By Mr. Morgan. —Is there any serious result
from blue mould in your district? —We have had blue
mould there, but not so seriously as in other districts.
3586. By the Chairman. —Has it ever wiped out a
crop ?—lt is very seldom that we have not had sufficient
plants to plant all the year. In some years we have
no blue mould. Last year there was a bit.
3587. By Mr. Morgan. —When did it first show
itself? —Abut the second or third year after we started
to grow tobacco; about 1924.
3588. By Mr. Morgan. —An expert in the Patho-
logical Department at Canberra gave evidence before
the committee in connexion with blue mould, and
mentioned w ? ays of overcoming the difficulty of infec-
tion. Briefly, he advocated that growers should use
only seed known to have been produced by healthy
plants; that all tobacco plants should be ploughed
under as soon as practicable after the crop is gathered,
and all living plants during the autumn and spring
destroyed; that seed beds should be made on new
ground; that volunteer plants growdng in the field
should be destroyed as soon as they appear; that no
diseased nor suspected seedlings should be introduced
from other districts; and that diseased seed beds should
be destroyed. Has that advice been generally fol-
low'ed?—lt has not.
3589. Do you not think that over-wintering and
volunteer tobacco plants are responsible for the per-
petuation of blue mould ?—There is no doubt about it.
3590. By the Chairman. —-Does it trouble the
Pomonal district very much?— Ho.
3591. Do you get seed from other district?— Hot
if w T e can avoid it. In every instance that I have ob-
tained seed from the Wangaratta district I have had
mould from the beds. Our owm beds -were free from
the mould.
3592. By Mr. Morgom. —l w 7 as told yesterday that
young plants were being brought from South Australia.
Is that so ?—That was last year.
3593. Were they a success? —Yes.
3594. And free from blue mould?— Yes.
3595. By Mr. James. —Would you say that your per-
centage of bright leaf is the average in the district, or
higher ?—Some growers would have a better percentage
of bright leaf than I had. A great deal depends on
the soil. There is plenty of soil out there on which
you can grow similar leaf. A lot of the better class
of land we cleared years ago and people think it is
easier to grow tobacco on that than to clear some of
the poorer quality land, with the result that they do
not get so much light leaf.


3596. Do you consider that the prices which were
obtained last year were profitable ?—Very profitable.
3597. By Mr. Martens. —You are satisfied to carry
on at that price ?—I am.
3598. By Mr. Jones. —The Tariff Board has recom-
mended a reduction of 6d. a pound on _ the excise
charged on Australian-grown leaf, to he given to the
growers in addition to the price they receive. Do you
think that a reduction of the present excise would
help the Australian industry ?—One is always in
favour of getting more if one can.
3599. Would it stimulate the industry?—lt certainly
would lead to many more people growing tobacco. But
if the price were raised to 6s. a pound it would not
benefit the man who is growing an inferior leaf,
because the company would not buy it. Those growers
who want the excise reduced are growing a class of
tobacco that is very difficult to sell. Still I will say
that for us light leaf growers a reduction of the excise
duty would be a very fine thing.
3600. Suppose it were stipulated that the reduction
should apply only in the case of the light leaf, would
that be an inducement for those growers ?—No doubt
many more people would go in for tobacco growing.
3601. By Mr. Morgan. —Your success has been
largely attributable to the fact that you have given an
intelligent interpretation to expert advice, has it not ?
—Yes. We have always found the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company quite willing to discuss with us any
matter connected with tobacco growing. If we have
any doubt about the quality of the leaf they are
always ready to give an opinion.
3602. By Mr. Martens.—Wh. at lias been the advice
of Mr. Slagg, and particularly Mr. Temple Smith, re-
garding the quality of tobacco you should grow ?
They have always wanted us to grow the best. Some
other growers have thought that if they grew heavy
leaf it would pay them better. Mr. Slagg, from the
time he has come among us, has always been keen on
our growing light tobacco leaf.
3603. You have been well advised from the expert
point of view ?—We would grow nothing but light
tobacco if we followed the advice of the experts.
3604. By Mr. Jones. —Are any Italians growing
tobacco at Pomonal ?—No, but there are other
foreigners, such as Greeks and Armenians. I believe
that a new grower has a far greater chance of making
a success of it than the old growers had.
3605. By Mr. Temple Smith. —Can you give an esti-
mate of tke area of land suitable for tobacco growing
of the right type, within a radius of 20 miles of
Pomonal ?—There are several thousands of acres suit-
able for tobacco growing.
3606. In your estimate of the cost of growing, which
you put at £3O an acre, did you include rental, value of
land, and wages paid hy a person wdio does not do the
work himself ?—My son wmrked it out and that is
his estimate for everything.
3607. By Mr. Martens. —What wages did he esti-
mate ?—l2s. a day
3608. How many hours a week ?— lt would be 48
hours. Our land is very much lighter than land in the
north east, and does not require the same amount of
working. Many of the estimates given before the
Tariff Board were dictated by a desire to get a
higher price for tobacco.
3609. You did not include cost of irrigation ?
Oh, no.
3610. By Mr. Swinson. —Were you president of your
association in 1926 ?—Yes,
3611. Was the following letter written by it to my
company in August of that year :
Pomonal,
7th August, 1926.
C. L. Bentley, Esq.,
British-Australasian Tobacco Co., Ltd.
a’Beckett-street, Melbourne.
Dear Mr. Bentley,
Thank you for your letter of 28th July containing your
offer for sons of growers to obtain factory experience. My
reply lias been delayed because I wished to bring the matter
before a general meeting of growers.
The meeting was unanimous in its appreciation of the
offer, wliich it was eager to accept. Some time ago I wrote to
your company asking that a representative be sent to educate
ns in correct grading and general methods of handling our
cured leaf. Your present offer gives us more than we asked.
May I say that we regard this move as one of the best
your company has lately made in its dealings with Australian
growers. It will help us to understand move thoroughly what
is required from us, and help us both to co-operate in serving
better that public which we both supply.
That in itself would justify the scheme. But we see in it
more than that—we see in it a gesture of frankness and good-
will; you are laying your cards on the table for all to see.
Too long there has been between the growlers and the company
an air of distrust, perhaps not mutual, a sense of greivance, a
suspicion that the company is not giving the growers fair
treatment. Quite often ignorance of the full facts gives rise
to suspicion. Some grievances probably have some foundation,
many are exaggerated, many are quite groundless, but this
uncertainty breeds hostile suspicion, and the growers experi-
encing one adverse season after another, watches the unfailing
prosperity of the company with a vague feeling that they
are making the money out of him; he is being cheated.
I need not emphasize the existence of this attitude. You
know it well enough. You were speaking to the writer on
the subject when you last visited this district.
It was with great pleasure then that we received your
offer. The growers now have a chance to see your business
from the inside, to see for themselves, through the eyes of
their sons; and better understand your own pecular diffi-
culties. The sons will be able to carry back the message to
the growers.—“ This is so,” and “This is not so; for we have
seen and heard for ourselves at first hand.”
Mr. Norman Mur pixy (junior) would like to go to the
factory w 7 ith the first lot and, subject to your approval, will
be ready to go at an early date. Mr. C. Clark, though a
grower and not the son of a grower, is anxious to gain this
handling experience; but the difficulty arises that the second
lot visiting the factory w T ill be going down at a time when
each one must be at home planting seed beds. A grower
having several sons could easily spare one son at this season,
but a man working alone is unable to be away at such a time.
If you are willing to let Mr. Clark come down to the
factory, would it be possible for him to come down at the
same time as Mr. Murphy, completing our quota in one lot ?
I shall be glad if you can tell me about what date vou wish
them to commence with you; and also what date "approxi-
mately you will be buying in Pomonal. As you know 7, we have
not this year much leaf to offer you. but early advice of your
intended visit would be appreciated.
T am,
Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) R. E. Fowler, Secretary.
—Yes.
3612. By Mr. Morgan. —Was full advantage taken of
that offer ?—Yes. My son and Mr, Ridley went down,
but Mr. Clark could not get away.
3613. Do you attribute the subsequent successful re-
sults to their visit ?—Yes; they considered that the
company was justified in its criticism of the leaf which
it was buying.
The witness withdrew.
Henry Rowe, Curator for the Borough of Stawell,
was called, sworn and examined.
3614. By the Chairman.— How long have you held
your present position ?—Just on 18 years.
3615. What evidence do you wish to give ?—The
first attempt to grow tobacco on a commercial scale at
Pomonal was made under my supervision by a syndi-
cate of Stawell citizens formed for the purpose of
trying to foster the industry for the good of the district.


That was in 1921. We were largely in the experi-
mental stage. The experts advised us to plant without
manuring, and our efforts met with failure. We were
growing on the higher lands, which were very sandy,
and the leaves were very small. In the following year
we used a little manure, with somewhat better results;
and in the third year we used still more manure and
obtained a fair crop, but unfortunately avc had a fair
amount of White Hurley tobacco, and avc had blue
mould in the fields, which destroyed the lot. I gretv it
in the following year or two, but avc never had very
much success. That crop, however, was sufficient to
show that, with more knowledge of necessary manuring,
we Avould succeed. Unfortunately, I haA 7 e been so placed
that for the last five or six years I have not been able
to grow it.
3616. What acreage did you grow?—lt varied from
two to three acres up to five acres.
3617. Had you had any experience beforehand?-
Not on a commercial scale. I experimented in the
park, growing the plants. In that class of soil aa t c
grew the leaf all right, but it Avas very rough stuff.
3618. You did not approach the experiment as a
novice ?—Hot altogether. Our difficulty Avas, and I
believe it still is to a certain extent, knowing the neces-
sary manuring to give you a full crop Avithout destroy-
ing the quality of your leaf.
3619. Did you flue-cure that crop? —Yes; I built the
first barn that was erected in the district.
3620. Did you cure it yourself?—Ho, my son cured
it; he was there all the time; I Avas only a week-ender.
3621. Was he experienced ?—Ho, he acted under the
instructions of our GoA 7 ernment experts, Mr. Temple
Smith and Mr. Marks.
3622. Were you able to sell the tobacco?—ln the
first year or two we had practically nothing to sell,
and in the third year Ave did not have much. My big-
gest crop turned me in about £4O.
3623. How many citizens were in the syndicate?—
We issued 50 shares at £5 each, since increased to £B.
We have spent, roughly, £4OO on the experiment. We
also selected a block of land with the intention of carry-
ing on the experiment still further. There is one point,
the aroma of the leaf, about AAdiich I should like to giA 7 e
my experience. The last tobacco I grew a little over
fiA r e years ago. One half of my area under crop I gaA 7 e
a dressing of I cwt. of nitrate of soda to the acre; the
other half had none. I saA 7 ed some of the leaf to
smoke myself. I am rather particular in regard to
the tobacco I smoke, and I found that that A\ 7 hich
had been grown on the land which had been txnated
only Avith superphosphate and a little potash had no
bad aroma, Avhile the other leaf that was taken from
the ground that had been dressed with nitrate of soda
was practically unsmokable in my opinion. So it is
quite possible that excessive nitrogen in the soil, or an
unbalanced manure, is causing the bad aroma.
3624. Did you manufacture the stuff that you
smoked?— Very roughly.
3625. Would you say that tobacco smoked in that
form is likely to be in any Avay smokable?—There was
very little flavour in it, but there was absolutely noth-
ing objectionable. I could smoke it always, but one
wants something with a little more flaAmur.
3626. Is that, all the experience you haA 7 e had?—‘
Yes, I haA 7 e not been groAving it for the last fh 7 e years.
3627. Have you followed the progress of the in-
dustry at Pomonal?—To a certain extent.
3628. HaA 7 e you noticed any marked improvement in
the’colour'of'their leaf?— Hot in the colour of the
leaf. It seems to me that under our experimental con-
ditions we got as good a colour as they are getting.
Without any manure, the colour Avas excellent, but the
crop was so poor that it Avould not pay to grow it.
used no superphosphate for p. start. From what
I have seen in following up the progress of the in-
dustry, you require an abundance of superphosphate.
In fact, with any crop that land out there responds
very readily to super.
3629. By Mr. Tally. —In those experiments did you,
during any year, sow a crop of, say, barley, and plough
it into the soil ?—¥e sowed a crop of rye.
3630. Did that give you any better results? —"Well,
yes; but I do not think we went far enough with it.
I am quite of the opinion that green manure in that
particular class of soil would make for success. It is
lacking in humus. Whether peas would make too much
nitrogen I do not know. Green manure in that hilly
soil, the ideal light leaf soil, is necessary, because it is
so deficient in humus.
3631. Do you know Avhether the growers are follow-
ing that line at the present time? —I could not say.
3632. By Mr. Jones. —You said that in 1923 thd
blue mould practically destroyed the whole of the crop;
so it was a serious problem?— Yes; and it seemed to
attack the White Burley. But Ave have since been
advised by the company not to grotv that class of leaf
because they do not require it.
3633. Do you remember Avhether blue mould Avas
prevalent'throughout Victoria in that year?-—I could
not say. But I remember that we struck cold, showery
weather in the summer time. We had a little blue
mould in the seed beds early in the season, but we had
worked it out because we burned all the plants that
we satv Avere affected; but it developed Avith the
inclement Aveather.
3634. It has not been serious since then? —Ho, only
in the seed beds.
3635. By the Chairman. —ls there any other point
that you would like to touch upon?—l am quite con-
vinced that the industry is going to be a big thing,
and, A\dien circumstances permit, I shall grow tobacco
again.
3636. You are not concerned with the marketing
side? —I am a great believer in community effort. In
a district like Pomonal, which shows excellent promise,
it would be better for the growers if they established
their own bulking and grading shed, and had an expert
staff of graders. The buyer uoav has to visit every
farm. Some growers grade Avell, and others not so Avell,
and it is very difficult for the buyer to assess an average
price; whereas, if there were an expert staff to grade
correctly every groAver Avould get the correct value for
his leaf.
The witness withdrew.
AndreAv Anderson, tobacco-groAver, Pomonal, Avas called,
sworn and examined.
3637. By the Chairman. —Are yon a tobacco-
grower?—Yes.
3638. Are you a member of the Pomonal associa-
tion?— Yes.
3639. How long have you been groAving tobacco? —
Four years.
3640. What area? —In the first year I grew half an
acre. In the second year I put in about four acres,
but harvested only half an acre. Last year I grew
three acres; and this year I have twelve acres in, and
have a share farmer doing the work.
3641. What has been your experience?-—ln the first
year it Avas only an experiment. I am a fruit-grower
chiefly, but have been very interested in tobacco-
groAving. The second year, being an off season for
apples, I put in a few acres so that I Avould have some
return from tobacco. It was a dry season, and it did
not do any good. I had two and a half acres of it in
betA\ 7 een the young apple trees. But half an acre which
I had close to a creek, and Avhich I irrigated in Feb


ruary returned me a cheque for £26. Last year I put
in three acres and had a very good crop. I harvested
a hit late, and sold 2,700 lb.
3642. Hoav much of that was bright leaf?— About
500 lb.
3643. Do you do your own curing?—l did my own
curing last year, with the assistance of Mr. Murphy
and Mr. Robson, in their barns.
3644. You had a very poor proportion of bright
leaf, did you not? —I think I know the reason for that.
The same piece of land had had tobacco grown on it
several years before. I loaned it to Mr. Robson one
year, and before that to Mr. Bailey, and they grew r a
bigger percentage of light leaf on it. It was heavily
manured. I think that Mr. Robson put on half a ton of
manures. For a few years it was idle, and grew clovers
and other things. That was ploughed in as green
manure, and I think that there was too much nitrogen
in the soil, with the result that I obtained a bigger and
heavier crop, but not of the same quality. This year I
shall have about 70 per cent, of bright tobacco.
3645. Would you say that a fair average of bright
tobacco in the Pomonal district, with the present
methods of cultivation and curing, is 80 per cent.?—
Providing it is grown on proper ground, not on the
richer soil.
3646. What sort of price have you been getting?—
I was satisfied with the prices last year; they worked
out at somewhere about Is. lid. per lb. That was
much below some of the other prices, but was satis-
factory considering the quality of the leaf.
3647. Do you think you can do better this year ?
Yes.
3648. If you averaged 2s. a lb. would that pay you
handsomely on the present cost of production ?—Hot
with the light leaf. You cannot possibly get the same
quantity of light leaf as you can of the poorer grade;
therefore the cost of production is much higher, because
more handling is required and a greater amount is
spent in wages.
3649. Have you done your own curing all through ?
—Ho; last year was the first time I did any curing.
When I had only a little leaf it was put in with Mr.
Murphy’s crop and cured with that. I live alongside
Mr. Murphy. Mr. Marks has been there every year,
showing them how to cure tobacco, and I have watched
the curing being done.
3650. Do you think that with your limited experi-
ence it is safe to trust yourself to cure this year’s crop
and expect to get a good price for it ?—I shall certainly
seek the advice of others who have been growing for
a longer period than I have. I do not think that I am
competent to cure a barn right through and obtain the
best results.
3651. Is it not a fact that a number of growers with
a limited amount of experience in this important phase
of the industry are not getting a finished product but
expect a very high price ?—I do not know about their
expecting a high price. There are new growers, how-
ever, who are undertaking flue curing by the book
method. The Department of Agriculture has issued a
booklet dealing with flue curing, and that has given
them the only knowledge they possess. We know from
experience that you have to deviate from those instruc-
tions a lot at times. Those men are not making the
success they should make.
3652. By Mr. Jones. —You grow both fruit and
tobacco. Given a good season for each, which would
you say is the more profitable crop to grow ?—Tobacco
would win by a good bit.
3653. If you were assured of fair crops and prices
you would cease fruit growing in favor of tobacco ?
X certainly would,
3654. By Mr. Temple Smith. —Can you confirm Mr.
Murphy’s opinion as to the area suitable for tobacco-
growing in the Pomonal district ?—The estimate of
5,000 acres within a radius of 20 miles of Pomonal
refers to land on only one side of the hill. In three
directions you can go for 20 miles, but in a fourth
direction you cannot go a mile in places.
The witness withdrew.
Matthew James Ridley, tobacco-grower, Pomonal, was
called, sworn and examined.
3655. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco grower?
—Yes.
3656. Do you belong to the association at Pomonal ?
—Yes.
3657. How long have you been growing tobacco ?-■-
I started experimenting in 1921.
3658. Have you been growing it ever since ?—Only
off and on. I have not grown any since 1925.
3659. Why did you give it up ?—I had two or three
failures with blue mould, so I went back into the fruit
trade.
3660. Have you had any success with it ?—ln 1924
I was fairly successful, but I had only about acres
under crop.
3661. That represents the result of your experience ?
—Yes.
3662. Did you have blue mould in 1923 ?—Ho, I had
blue mould only in one year.
3663. When you went into tobacco growing did you
know anything about the dnager of infection from
seed ?—Ho. We got all our seed from the department
and put it in new ground.
3664. What did you do after you had blue mould ?
—We got further seed and put it in different ground.
3665. Did you have the same result ?—Ho, we had
no blue mould.
3666. Was that adjoining the other land ?—Ho, it
was a good bit away from it.
3667. Did you put up a barn ?—Yes.
3668. Did you cure it yourself ?—Yes, with the
assistance of Mr. Marks.
3669. What yield did you get from the, acres ?
I think the payment I received was about £ll2 or £ll4.
I had somewhere about 1,000 lb.
3670. Was it bright leaf?— About 80 per cent, of it
was bright leaf.
3671. Did not that encourage you to persevere with
it ?—-I had the business of handling fruit and I could
not spare the time for it.
3672. You have not grown any since 1923 ?—Hot
until this year. I now have four acres under crop.
3673. Did you take any precaution against blue
mould ?—Hot at first. I obtained my seed from the
department as usual, and put it in fresh ground. I had
had blue mould very badly in the seed beds.
3674. Then it must have been in the seed ?—I do
not see how it could be. They say that the seed under-
goes a test at about 100 degrees Fahr., and so cannot
contain blue mould. The seed which I had was put
under a fire test of 150 degrees Fahr. before I planted
it in beds.
3675. And you put it in fresh beds ?—Yes.
3676. Did the other growers have blue mould this
year ?—Yes, several of them. Some had it very badly,
others only slightly.
3677. Did the blue mould this year reduce the crop ?
—lt reduced mine by one-half.
3678. Then you will be lucky if you get 2 acres ?
—Yes.
3679. And that may yield you about I ton of
tobacco ?—About that.


3680. Suppose you made a profit of £lOO per ton,
would that pay you for the trouble and expense you
have gone to with the 4 acres, and would you be
satisfied to go on similarly year after year ? —Oh, yes,
with an average of about 2s. a lb.
3681. If every year you get only 50 per cent, of the
crop ?—Yes, if 1 get a good lemon leaf.
3682. I suppose vou are growing on light sandv soil ?
—Yes.
3683. Do you irrigate?-—-No.
3684. Do you use super ?—Yes, 1 used 5 cwt. per
acre last year.
3685. Do you think that that improved the yield ?•
I do not know that it improved the yield; but it is said
that it improves the quality and assists the leaf to ripen
quickly.
3686. Who has said that ? —Several people who are
growing in the district.
3687. Do the buyers say so?- —Oh, no.
3688. Does the buyer tell you that it is advisable to
use super ?—He has not told me anything, but he may
have told some of the other growers.
3689. Do you think that if blue mould could be got
rid of there would be very much brighter prospects for
the industry in Pomonal? —I do.
3690. But even allowing for blue mould, do you
think it is worth while continuing in view of the output
and the prices you get?— Yes, I think that, taking the
good years with the bad, it would be a payable propo-
sition.
3691. By Mr. Tally. —Do you notice whether your
neighbours allow the plants to go on growing through
the winter after they have harvested the crop ? —Yes,
some of them.
The witness withdrew.
John George Frank Hobson, tobacco-grower, Pomonal,
was called, sworn and examined.
3692. By the Chairman.— Are you a tobacco grower ?
—Yes.
3693. Are you a member of the association at
Pomonal ?—Yes.
3694. How long have you been growing tobacco ?■—
Six or seven years. I went to Pomonal with the idea
of growing tobacco, but did not have much success at
the start.
3695. Where did you come front ? —I came from
England.
3696. You did not have any experience of tobacco
growing ?—None whatever.
3697. What induced you to go to Pomonal ?~I was
in this district and there was a good deal of talk about
the prospects of Pomonal as a tobacco centre.
3698. You were rather allured at the prospects ?
Yes.
3699. You went straight into tobacco growing ?
Yes.
3700. How many acres did you plant ?—-Unfortu-
nately for me, I went on a scrub block with the idea of
clearing the land.
3701. What price did you pay for the land ?—I
bought 50 acres privately for £2 10s. an acre, and I had
to clear it.
3702. What did the clearing cost you?— About £l2
an acre.
3703. So that, before you could start to grow tobacco,
the land had cost you £l4 10s. an acre ?—Yes.
3704. What did you put under crop the first year ?
I grew a little area on shares with a neighbour while
I was carrying on clearing operations. I did not get
very far for several years. The first year seemed very
promising, I had about an acre, and it returned me
about £BO. That encouraged me to go on. After that,
however, I did not have much success for a few years.
Last year was really my first good year.
3705. What acreage did you have last year ?—About
5 acres.
3706. Did you clear all the land yourself ?—Yes.
3707. Is it light sandy soil ?—Yes.
3708. Is there any irrigation ?—No.
3709. Up to last year you had had about four
years’ experience ?—Yes, with the exception of one year
when I went out of it.
3710. Did you get advice from the experts ?—Oh,
yes.
3711. Did you ask for it, or was it volunteered ?
They volunteered it.
3712. Whatever you wanted in the way of advice
they were only too willing to give you ?—Yes.
3713. Did you find that it benefited you very much ?
—Oh, yes, Ido not think that I would have done much
without their advice.
3714. Did you study any literature on the subject ?
—Yes, I have been through a certain amount.
3715. But for the allurement of tobacco growing you
probably would not have gone to the district ?—No.
What little money I had, I sunk in that.
3716. Did you have any idea of going into fruit
growing ?—I have put in a few acres of trees.
3717. Have you done any good with it ?—They have
not reached that stage yet.
3718. It is only now that you are beginning to see
results ?—Yes.
3719. Flow many acres under tobacco have you
this year ?—About eight.
3720. Are you still working on shares, or by your-
self ? —By myself.
3721. Did you yourself plant that eight acres ?—I
had a young fellow working with me.
3722. Where did you get the seed ?—lt was my own
seed that I had saved from last year.
3723. Have you had any blue mould ?—I did not
have any sign of blue mould until I had planted out all
my crop, 1 suppose 50,000, 60,000 or more plants,
besides my own requirements,
3724. Should it not have been free from mould?—
Theoretically it should have been; yet I have had it
this year.
3725. What are the prospects this year ? —Generally
speaking, the crop is lighter than it w y as last year.
3726. Did you use super this year ?—Yes, about 8
cwt. to the acre.
3727. And yet it is a light crop?— Yes.
3728. What do you attribute that to ?—We have
had a very long dry spell since Christmas.
3729. Might not irrigation have effected an improve-
ment ?—lf we could have put on one watering I think
that it would have made a big difference.
3730. What do you think will be the yield ?—4 cwt.
or 5 cwt. to the acre. The colour of the leaf is very
good.
3731. Up to the present have you found any diffi-
culty in getting a good colour?—At first I did. We
used all sorts of different manures and that sort of
thing, but I think the colour was spoilt chiefly on
account of the stuff growing late. I had late green
stuff and was not able to get a good colour. Last year,
however, I had a pretty good colour.
3732. Do you do your own curing ?—Yes.
3733. How many barns have you?— One.
3734. Did you put it up yourself ?—Yes, with a
certain amount of assistance.
3735. Did you get any specifications from the de-
partment ?—Yes.
3736. Did the experts have a look at it when it was
finished ?— Yes.
3737. Did they approve of it ? —Yea,


3738. Do you consider that you have improved as
a curer ?—Yes, I do.
3739. You are game to take the risk of curing the
coming crop ?—Yes, I have most of it cured.
3740. Is it fairly light ?—lt is practically all light.
3741. Up to the present you have made practically
nothing out of tobacco, and you are depending on this
year to pull you through ?—I got a bit out of it last
year. I had about 3,000 lb., and it averaged 2s. 6d.
alb.
3742. Were you satisfied with that?—-Oh, yes.
3743. If you got that average every year, would you
consider that you were on a good wicket even though
you lost 50 per cent, of your crop ?-—Ye.s.
3744. Would you be satisfied to go on under those
conditions ?—Yes.
3745. Would an average price of 2s. a lb. pay you ?
—I do not think that it would for the bright leaf.
3746. Do you think that, in view of the quality of
the tobacco you are producing, you ought to get more
than you are receiving ? —I think they give good prices
for the really good stuff.
3747. You consider that an average of 2s. 6d. a lb.
>a a good price ? —Yes.
3748. But would it be a good price for the best
quality leaf ?—lncluding the bonus I received as high
as 3s. 6d. a lb. last year.
3749. In view of your failures and difficulties, have
you any reason to regret having gone to Pomonal and
invested your capital there to grow tobacco ? —Oh, no;
if things continue as they seem to be panning out I
think that I shall be on a good wicket.
3750. Have you communicated with any other people
in Great Britain informing them of the prospects of
tobacco growing in Australia based on your own experi-
ence ? —Ho, I have not.
3751. Supposing you were writing to a man in your
position who wanted to make a start out here, would
you recommend him to go in for tobacco growing ?
Hot unless the Government was prepared to do some-
thing for him. Before I came out here I was told all
sorts of wonderful yarns by Australia House as to what
they were going to do, but I found that it was a
different thing once I got over here.
3752. Did they mention tobacco to you ? —Hot
tobacco exactly. But once you get here it is difficult
to make progress unless you do it “ off your own bat.”
3753. You were looking for some inducement. If
they had held out to you the inducement that you could
get for £2 10s. an acre land that would return you a
profit of £lOO an acre from tobacco would you have con-
sidered that a very fine proposition ?—A lot of people
would not have been able to consider it because they
had not the capital. I have had to put many hundreds
of pounds into that place to do what I have done.
3754. And you are depending on tobacco to get that
back ?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
Eeginald Edward Fowler, orchardist, Pomonal, and
secretary to the Pomonal Tobacco-growers As-
sociation was called, sworn and examined.
3755. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco grower?
—I am an orchardist; but I have grown tobacco experi-
mentally.
3756. Are you a member of the Pomonal Tobacco
Growers’ Association ?—I am secretary of that body.
I have grown a little tobacco experimentally this year,
but Ido not call myself even now a grower. The fact
that I have an established orchard that has to be
handled has so far prevented me from engaging in
tobacco growing to any large extent.
3767. At the present time you regard tobacco grow-
ing as a side line ?—Yes, along lines that I may have
something to say about later.
3758. What induced you to go in for tobacco at all ?
—Simply the fact that the profits from tobacco ap-
peared to be so good that, in spite of my having a good
orchard from which I obtain excellent returns, I feel
that it is a side line which, in Pomonal at any rate, is
justified. In the event of my fruit failing in any one
year I feel that I shall have in tobacco a side line
which, if managed on similar lines, will return me at
least as much as my fruit.
3759. Would it not return a lot more ?—-I receive
pretty good prices for my apples.
3760. But some growers have made profits averaging
£lOO an acre ? —Acreage profit doe.s not mean every-
thing. When I speak of profit I mean in comparison
with capital invested. Acreage means very little either
from tobacco or fruit. You can get either a lot or a
little off an acre. It is the money you put in and the
money you take out that counts.
3761. With the exception of the present year yon
have had no experience as a tobacco grower ?—Hot
with my own tobacco. I have been intending to go in for
it each year, because I could see that it was an attrac-
tive proposition; but as I have an established orchard,
which is a perennial and not an annual crop, I have
had to do the best I could. If I were dealing with
annual crops, that could be put in or left out, the
chances are that I would not sow one in competition
with tobacco. I have a good orchard, and Ido not feel
that I can mix the two. Under Mr. Slagg’s supervision
I am following lines that I hope will enable me to
combine them. Until now I have not been able to do so.
3762. You have plenty of light sandy soil ?—The
soil is suitable. If I had not an orchard in it, I would
put in tobacco immediately. If a sudden disease wiped
out my orchard, I would put in tobacco straight away
and go all out on it, because I know that there is money
in it. The leaf that I have taken for my experimental
plot is equal to that which my neighbours have taken
from similar soil. Under present circumstances, how-
ever, my tobacco production is limited.
3763. What are you putting in now as an experi-
ment ?—Half an acre.
3764. From what you have seen during the last few
years, do you not consider that you ought to take a
bigger plunge ?—I have every intention of doing so
next year.
3765. It is not that you have any doubts regarding
the industry ?—Hot at all.
3766. Have you studied tobacco growing in any way ?
—Ho, Ido not profess to be an expert in any branch of
the industry.
3767. Have you had conversations with the experts ?
—Only during their visits to the district.
3768. Did they try to induce you to go in for it ?
Hot at all. They have always cautioned me to be care-
ful. But Avhen a man sees his neighbour getting good
returns it takes a lot to dissuade him from going in
for it.
3769, Have you put up a barn ?—Hot this year,
because half an acre does not justify it; but I have
every intention of putting up at least one next year.
3770. I suppose you realize, from what you have
learned round the district, that to make a success of
tobacco cultivation you have to consider quite a number
of factors, such as the value of using superphosphates,
of irrigating, and of having proper methods of curing
and grading the leaf. Have you given consideration
to all of those possibilities, or are you, like some other
men, just Sowing the seed and leaving the result to
chance ?—ln my opinion that is the biggest fault in


all districts. We do not grow the leaf as the Ameri-
cans do. My impression is that in every form of pro-
ducion we do not give to our cultivation the attention
that it warrants. We are beginning to understand now
that we cannot leave our ploughing until about a week
before we put the plants in. So far we have adopted
the practice of putting the plants in and letting them
get along as best they could, and then taking off the
best leaves. Because we have been somewhat favored
we have perhaps been induced to be slack. If we culti-
vated and gave to the matter the close attention that
is given to it by the Americans we would no doubt get
better results. Ido not think that any crop in Pomonal
has had the attention it should have had. We all
intend to do a lot more than we actually do.
3771. Mr. Hobson, as a result of irrigation, can
detect a very marked improvement in his prospective
yield; yet only one man in the district is irrigating
to-day ?—lrrigation is not possible in most parts of
Pomonal. I maintain, too, that it is not essential. I
have on my land plants which, before I topped them,
were over my head. They were put in in the middle
of Hovember, and had no cultivation except a slight
hand hoeing once in the middle of December. They
were topped last month, since when they have had no
cultivation whatever. The leaf is now yellowing in
the field, and the plants are up to my chest. That land
was cultivated before with plough and disc to a depth of
6 or 8 inches, but since then has not been touched except
for a slight scratching on the surface with a hand hoe.
Irrigation is important, no doubt; but I maintain that
if we cultivate properly we can do without it and get
results. The nature of the country does not lend itself
to irrigation; there is no big available water supply at
present, although one was suggested which was thought
to be a little too expensive. Then again, the ground
is very absorbant. If a big storage were available, a
pipe line system with sprinklers would probably be
feasible and no doubt would make a lot of difference.
But apart from irrigation, if proper attention is paid
to more intensive cultivation, suckering and topping,
a good crop can be produced. We do not yet know
our possibilities. Where you can irrigate there is no
doubt it is best to do so.
3772. How long have you been in the district ?
Six years.
3773. With your knowledge of what has been going-
on, would you say that the present prices that are paid
for tobacco are sufficiently encouraging for the growers,
and that there is the chance of a large increase to
tobacco cultivation ?—I should say “Yes.”
3774. Do you think that the number of growers is
likely to be doubled ?—I should think so. In the case
of most primary products there is a restricted market;
cost of production very steeply, the price paid for this
tobacco that we are growing. That fact will have a
great deal of influence on any one who is starting; if he
knows that his market is assured with a particular
commodity he is more likely to go in for that than for
another that is already overloaded.
3775. We have had evidence that, provided the
growers at Pomonal get an average of 2s. 6d. a lb., they
are quite prepared to take the risk of being wiped
out totally with blue mould, and in any case of losing
50 per cent of their crop. What is your opinion ?-
I should say that that is right. Considering that the
growing of the lighter and brighter leaf raises the
cost of production very steeply, the price paid for this
J-saf should be considerably greater than for dark leaf.
3776. Would an average of 2s. 6d. a lb. satisfy you ?
—lt would be a very payable proposition.
3777. A profit of £lOO an acre would be good enough ?
—Yes. I know of no other primary product from
which you could get that return.
3778. By Mr. Jones. —Has your association linked
up with the Victorian association ?—Ho. We were
originally associated with them, but we separated from
them on the issue of growing light leaf. We found that
we were defending their attitude towards the growing
of dark leaf, while we were growing light leaf. We
disagreed entirely with them on that point, but we
found ourselves drawn into defending the dark leaf.
Our leaf was so different from theirs that it justified
our forming a separate association. We are only too
happy to work with them on points in which we have
a common interest. When they have increased their
output of light leaf sufficiently to justify their joining
with us we shall be only too happy to join with them.
We have been separated from them for some years. We
have never agreed to the sale of dark leaf. If we
happen to plant in soil that is not suitable, and get dark
leaf, we do not offer it. It is not our policy to try to
force it on the buyers; never has been, and never
will be.
3779. Has your association been asked recently to
link up ?—Hot officially. Unofficially, yes.
3780. If the prices that are now being paid for leaf
are maintained, would you consider the advisability of
rooting out your fruit trees to grow tobacco? —Hot
in Pomonal; but I would in most of the other districts
in which there are orchards providing tobacco of equal
quality to ours could be grown. By a coincidence, Po-
monal happens to produce better fruit than the average.
Except in the case of fruit of exceptional quality it
would pay to grub out the trees, provided the same
care and attention were given to the cultivation of
tobacco. In the majority of cases the orchards have
been so long established that a routine has been set
up, which is followed more or less closely. That is not
so with tobacco. If we gave to it the same time and
attention that we give as a matter of course to the fruit,
we would get very much better results from tobacco
growing.
3781. To a person who was launching out now in
Pomonal would you suggest that he should go in for
tobacco cultivation ?—Certainly; I would not plant
fruit trees.
3782. How would you regard a reduction of the
excise as a means of stimulating the tobacco industry in
Australia?— That is a very difficult question. Any-
thing that will stimulate the industry is welcome, but
you will be on dangerous ground if you over-stimulate
it. We should get a price that will tide us over any
mishaps that may occur, but beyond that I do not
believe it would be sound economics to proceed in the
direction of an excise bonus. Ido not say that w T e have
reached the price that we should get for profitable
production under all circumstances and in all seasons,
but Ido not believe in putting on too much; although
we are always glad to get what we can.
3783. Australia is not producing the quality for
which there is a demand. In order to stimulate the
production of the bright leaf, how would you regard the
reduction of the excise duty with respect to leaf which
is classified as bright ?—lf a reduction in the excise
will stimulate the production of bright -leaf so that
Australia can more nearly produce its own require-
ments and not be obliged to import any, I should say


it is justified, so long as there are no ill effects
economically.
3784. Would not that be an inducement to growers
to strive to get the bright leaf ?—We are striving to
get it now; but we would welcome an added induce-
ment.
3785. Would not that be an added inducement ?
If it would be that and nothing else, well and good.
I have not gone into the economic consequences, and
have not given the matter sufficient thought. There
may be more to it than first appears. If it would have
no other effect but the stimulation of the production of
bright leaf, I should support it. I believe that the
brightest leaf is very expensive to produce, and a good
price is necessary to make it payable. I should be
entirely in favour of the proposal provided it had no
counter effects economically. I have in mind the case
of wool. The price of wool went up to a fairly high
level, and then it came down. You may create an
artificial value, and if it is too artificial something is
bound to happen.
3786. Mr. Anderson had 2-| acres unirrigated and
half an acre irrigated. The first was practically a
failure, but he got a good crop off the other. Does not
that seem to be evidence that irrigation is a good thing ?
—Yes. But bear in mind, also, that you do not know-
how much cultivation the 2|- acres received. Mr.
Anderson may agree that it could have been fallowed
or cultivated more before the crop went in, and thus
have conserved the moisture, with results equal to the
irrigation given to the other land. Because of lack of
cultivation we do not conserve half our moisture. It
is not uncommon to plough a very short time before the
plants go in. That is not sound business from a pro-
duction point of view’; yet circumstances often compel
us to do it. Therefore, although irrigation is good w 7 e
have not exhausted the possibilities of ordinary cultiva-
tion.
3787. How do you explain the fact that growlers with
28 years’ experience are going in for irrigation ?—-I
have no doubt that under certain circumstances irri-
gation will help; and they have the necessary facilities.
But until you have explored the possibilities of
cultivation the question of irrigation hardly
arises in our particular district, because we
have an unusual soakage from the mountain.
Only last Sunday a visitor told me that in
his district, where they have irrigation, they have
Munro apples, and it is very hard to get them to the
2J inch size; they are anything down to inch. In
my shed we are averaging over 3000 cases of the sizes
2f inches and 3 inches. The chances are that I give
mine less cultivation than he gives his; but they are
grown in loose sand, wdth underground soakage. We
do not have a big rainfall.
3788. By the Chairman. —Do you think that if, as a
result of some alteration of the export policy wdth a
view to stimulating the purchase of Australian tobacco,
a larger quantity of that tobacco came on the market
in manufactured form, it w 7 ould be a fair deal to the
smokers ?—A lot of the opposition to Australian
tobacco is due to prejudice. You could put Pomonal
tobacco inside a cigarette, and I would challenge the
average tobacco smoker to tell the difference between
it and a cigarette made from imported tobacco. Mr.
Temple Smith has made up Pomonal tobacco, and it
has been smoked without comment. The average man
in the street is not a discriminating smoker and his
taste is easily satisfied.
3789. Allowing for the possible inferiority of Aus-
tralian tobacco in comparison wdth the best American
leaf, wmuld you consider it a fair thing to withdraw-
suddenly from the market a great deal of the American
tobacco, and to replace it with Australian tobacco ?
That would be injurious, because it would put a lot of
people off smoking or reduce the consumption by giving
the people a sudden bump. That would not be good busi-
ness from either our point oi view or that of the manu-
facturers. An odd cigarette would pass unnoticed, but if
one tobacco were suddenly withdrawn and wholly re-
placed by another it would be noticed and that would
be to the detriment of both the growers and the manu-
facturers. Australian tobacco should be introduced in
a blended form as rapidly as the people will take it,
with the idea of eventually replacing wholly the Ameri-
can tobacco. The Australian tobacco may not be
inferior to the American, but it is different," and that
is sufficient to discourage people from smoking it.
3790. Have you ever tried Australian pipe tobacco ?
—There is some awful tobacco, and some that is not
bad. We in Pomonal are not very interested in pipe
tobacco. We can mix our own leaf fifty-fifty with
Havelock and smoke it.
3791. Apart from the Pomonal cigarettes you have
had no experience of Australian tobacco ?—Only raw
tobacco. Mr. Slagg gave me samples from different
States, and there certainly was a distinct aroma
about it.
3792, Supposing that your supplies of other brands
of cigarettes were suddenly cut off for months, and all
you had were Mr. Temple Smith’s cigarettes, would
they be a reasonable substitute ?—They would satisfy
me, but I do not guarantee that they would satisfy
any one else.
3793. You wmuld not consider that you suffered any
hardship by being compelled to smoke" them ?—ISTo. I
would enjoy them as much as any other cigarettes, I
have smoked plenty of imported cigarettes that I
liked less. I am not a heavy smoker, therefore, I do
not profess to be a discriminating one; but I suppose
that my throat is as sensitive as that of any other
person.
3794. By Mr. Slagg—As a result of your prelimi-
nary w’ork you feel that earlier planting and more
thorough cultivation of the soil w r ould be an advantage#
Most decidedly. We have proved the advantage of
earlier planting this year; and I have never had any
doubts about the advantage of cultivation. If we did
not have good underground soakage we would have to
cultivate more.
3795. By Mr. Jones. —A witness in Texas urged that
the duties should be raised to such an extent that Aus-
tralians would be compelled to smoke Australian
tobacco. \ou do not agree with that ?—I believe that
that would be a mistake. It should be introduced
gradually, and as fast as practicable, but not suddenly.
3796. You would smoke just as many Pomonal
cigarettes if none other w-ere available?— Yes; but there
is not sufficient Pomonal tobacco available.
3797. By Mr. Martens. —lf you were called upon
at the present time to provide Australia with its
requirements of tobacco, you could not do it ?—That is
so. We must not put the smoker off his habits.
3798. By Mr. Jones. —Would you say that there are
5.000 acres around Pomonal suitable for growing
tobacco?—l would not. There is land in the Pomonal
district wdiich will not grow’ tobacco. Every district is
patchy. There are tracts which will good
tobacco, and others in a different situation or wdth a
different slope which will not do so. There are tracts
in Pomonal where w 7 e do not attempt to grow 7 it,
because w 7 e know that they are not suitable.
The witness ivithdrew.
The committee adjourned.


{Taken at Melbourne, Victoria.)
TUESDAY, 15th APRIL, 1930.
Present:
Mr, Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. W. W. R. Swinson, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company; Mr. C. M. Slagg,
representing the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion; Mr. Temple Smith, Tobacco Expert, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, Victoria).
Samuel Sherwin Cameron, D.V.Sc., M.R.C.Y.S.,
Director of Agriculture, Victoria, and member of
the Executive Committee of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, was recalled and further
examined: —
3798 a. By the Chairman. —When you previously gave
evidence in Melbourne you expressed certain opinions
regarding the aroma problem in connexion with Aus-
tralian tobacco, and dealt particularly with the ques-
tion of ageing. We have since taken a lot of evidence,
particularly from experts and those who have been
associated with the manufacturing side, who have been
asked about ageing. The opinion expressed by Mr.
Bentley, of the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany, Mr. Tregenna, New South Wales tobacco expert,
and Mr. Jennings, an ex-buyer for the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company at Texas was to the effect
that Australian tobacco would not lend itself to such
a lengthy ageing process as that which American
tobacco undergoes. While these gentlemen do not
deny that ageing is a good thing, they consider that
there is no comparison between the necessity for ageing
American tobacco and Australian tobacco; because,
whereas in America the tobacco improves with ageing,
in Australia, after two years, it commences to deterio-
rate, even under the ageing process. Would you care
to make any further comment? —These opinions, but
particularly that of Mr. Tregenna, I should say, can
in the main, be just opinions, and not based upon an
experience of the treatment and processing of tobacco
as between the time of purchase from the grower and
the time of its coming into manufacture in the factory.
Such processes apparently have not been carried out
with the meticulous care with which they are carried
out in America. Furthermore, it is remarkable to
me, for the reason that I have just given, that such
opinions should be expressed unless backed by some
definite fact concerning the variation between the Aus-
tralian tobacco as it is grown, and as it leaves the
grower and the curer, and American tobacco. Then
there is the outstanding fact that it is not untrue to
say that millions of pounds sterling are invested in
buildings and plant in America for this purpose, and
that also large sums of money, to the extent of millions
of pounds, are involved in holding the tobacco for
those periods, and in the establishment and general
running of the organizations which undertake the in-
termediary handling of the tobacco between the time
it leaves the grower and the time when it actually
reaches the stage when it begins to be transformed
into tobacco ready for the pouch or pipe.
3798b. At Kensington we inspected what the
company classed as dark tobacco, which had
been kept for at least three years, and the
factory manager informed me that he could not
detect any marked improvement in the smoking
quality of the tobacco as the result of the ageing pro-
cess; hut, so far as I could see, it was only the dark
tobacco, which the company is not now buying, that
was being kept ?—Exactly; and it is the bright tobacco
that is most sought, and that should receive the most
care in that regard, if the Australian tobacco industry
is to be properly encouraged. On one occasion, when
there was a shortage, one company could blend only to
the extent of 3 per cent, of Australian tobacco instead
of the usual 10 per cent., and it blended practically as
it received the Australian supplies.
3799. Do your opinions in regard to ageing apply
as much to the bright Australian leaf as to the dark?
Undoubtedly. I have brought with me a copy of a
letter addressed to Mr. Slagg by Mr. F. L. Dixon, who
is one of a staff of six scientists —two physical
chemists, three analytical men, and one industrial man
—who are engaged by the firm of Liggett and Meyers.
It is a manufacturing firm, purely and simply, and has
a laboratory at Durhum, North Carolina. The letter
deals with scientific matters, but there are in it cer-
tain statements which indicate the importance that this
firm attaches to the changes which take place during
storage and processing prior to manufacture. That is
partly indicated by the fact that the firm employs this
staff. Mr, Dixon, referring to the method in which
the aroma problem should be attacked, says—
Concerning the method of attack, I am positive you must
know thoroughly the composition of your tobaccoes and their
behaviour under ageing, forced sweating, heat treatment,
casing treatment, &c.; you must be thoroughly acquainted with
the composition of tobacco produced by different areas in
order to intelligently approach the blending requirements.
He proceeds to state the laboratory investigations of a
scientific character that are required, as follows:
Tobaccoes of the characteristics displayed by the sample
analysed could be cured at low heats, and subsequent drying
should not exceed 180 degrees Fahr., and should be prized
at as high moisture content as will provide immunity from
damage.
“ Prizing ” is storage in bogheads under pressure, with
a certain moisture content. He goes on to say—
2nd. Improvement is limited to the availability of certain
forms of nitrogen, which under certain cases of deficiency,
may be supplied.
3rd. Certain forms of growth produce excess fibre and low
materials, producing exceedingly irritating smoke; this phase
needs investigation, and is not solved to my knowledge.
4th. It is known that in certain blends of tobaccoes of vary-
ing composition there is an actual exchange of constituents
which is beneficial to both.
sth. Blends of any number of acid tobaccoes, so far analysed,
may be up to any desired composition index, from the com-
position indices of the individual tobaccoes, which will be
quantitively correct for the individual constituents.
6th. Tobaccoes are now being used in cigarette manufacture,
as small percentages of blends, which, when smoked alone,
are very objectionable. There should be a solution to the
second phase of your problem.
I respectfully submit that there is scientific support of
the statement that I made, and which I repeat, that
very great care and attention is paid in America to
that phase of the tobacco industry.
3800. Since we had your evidence we have gone very
fully into the question of aroma; and we have dis-
covered, that so far as the principal buyer —the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company—is concerned,
aroma does not enter into the question when it is pur-
chasing. The company buys on colour, and the ques-
tion of aroma is left to the factory experts to settle.
The evidence is conclusive that the eucalyptus question
to which you referred has not, up to the present, entered
seriously into the calculations of the manufacturer, nor
has any other alleged deleterious matter. Would you
care to comment on that? —Simply to remind you that
that is a confirmation of the statement which I made
concerning the buying that I saw proceeding in
America. I was in about twenty selling warehouses


■while the preparations for selling were going on, and
I do not recall attention haying been paid by the buyers
to the smell, and its influence on the tobacco, nor
during the grading processes which I saw proceeding
in the prizing houses. They buy on colour, texture,
appearance and evenness of grade.
3801. In your opinion, then, aroma has no more to
do with the buying side of the tobacco industry in Aus-
tralia than it has in America? —All the information I
have is your statement that that is the practice. I
have not seen any buying proceeding in Australia,
because it is done on the individual farms, and I have
not been there at the time.
3802. The growers have been educated to the point
that they are out to get colour, and they are not worry-
ing about aroma. In your opinion, would that dis-
pose of such damaging suggestions as that of the
eucalyptus taint in Australian leaf, or some other
fundamental fault in regard to aroma?-—lt goes to
show that, so far as the tobacco is concerned at the
time that the grower finishes with it, aroma does not
count.
3803. It is to be presumed that if the grower pro-
duces the right colour, the correct texture and quality
will be present?—l do not think that that follows.
3804. Must it not, because the buyer does not sub-
mit to the grower any stipulation regarding texture and
quality, but simply says, “If you produce lemon or
bright mahogany I will pay you so much ”; that is,
assuming that the leaf is normally healthy. That is all
that has so far been thrown upon the shoulders of the
grower ?—Broadly, I suppose that that is correct, be-
cause the darker tobaccoes are usually of coarser texture
than the lighter tobaccoes.
3805. Does not the evidence that I have referred to,
and your own statement that they do not buy on
aroma in America, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
that it is impossible for the grower to concern himself
with the aroma of the leaf, and that it is simply beg-
ging the question to submit to him that unless he im-
proves the aroma he has no future in this industry; do
not those facts prove that it is impossible to place on
the grower the responsibility to produce aroma, and
that he is held responsible for the colour?—I say
“ yes ”; with the natural comment, in view of the
whole trend of my evidence, that aroma is a subse-
quent development produced by changes in the con-
stituents of the leaf.
3806. There must be fundamental constituents from
which the aroma is developed; and similarly there
must be fundamental constituents which result in good
burning qualities ?—The Maryland tobaccoes are
famous for that.
3807. By Mr. Morgan. —ls aroma developed to any
extent by the adulterants that are subsequently used?—
That is a different question altogether. It is very
important to differentiate between the changes that
occur in tobacco before it is subjected to the processes
of manufacture. Those are secret processes, and are
governed by formulae which are known only to the
manufacturers and their special staffs. Various com-
pounds, or sweetening, flavouring, aromatic substances,
are used for the purpose of masking, and they do mask,
the flavour of tobacco, which would be existent if it
were not masked in that way. They may be used to
give a particular tang to tobacco to suit the palates of
certain classes of smokers. As a fact, variations take
place from time to time in the tastes of the public,
according as the manufacturers develop a process of
manufacture that tickles the public taste, that tickling
being largely supported by advertisement. The out-
standing instance of that is the wonderful jump into
popular favour of the Camel cigarettes in America,
and the more recent cigarette brought out to fight the
Camel cigarette, the Old Gold cigarette, from the
sales of which the company concerned pays its divi-
dends for the year, and, in advertising which, it has
spent millions of pounds sterling. Then there is the
local instance in Australia within the last three years
of Temple Bar being introduced to meet the competi-
tion of Edgeworth tobacco. It quickly became one
of the most popular pipe-smoking tobaccoes. I have
no hesitation in saying it is a fact that the public
taste is influenced from time to time concerning the
aroma, the flavour, and that sort of thing, by the
blending of tobaccoes. The answer to your question,
therefore, is that there can be no doubt that the sauces
and other ingredients that are used in the actual manu-
facture affect those qualities which influence public
taste and public demand for tobacco. There is an-
other outstanding instance in Rhodesian tobacco. That
tobacco had a peculiar characteristic of its own. I
believe that steps were taken in South Africa to pro-
mote the smoking of Rhodesian tobacco there, with the
result that they secured practically the whole of the
internal trade. At a later stage, when attempts were
made to reintroduce other tobaccoes, the South African
people had swung to the Rhodesian flavour, and con-
tinued to smoke that tobacco. Similarly', any person
who has been smoking Virginian tobacco for a long
time does not take to Turkish tobaccoes. Since I was
eighteen years of age I have smoked nothing but
cigarettes. Eor over fourteen years I had cigarettes
made up by the pound by a firm in Melbourne. When
I went to America on the first occasion I took with
me a number of pounds of those cigarettes.
3808. By the Chairman. —Were they made from
Australian tobacco ?—They were manufactured here.
When I reached America I found that I could land
only 3 lb. I nursed those 3 lb. as long as I could,
but I finally had to change, and I swung to Camel
cigarettes. In the course of a week or a fortnight I
discarded the half lb. of Australian cigarettes that I
had left, and brought them back to Australia with me.
3809. Is it not a fact that the assumption has been
widely broadcast that Australian tobacco of every kind
so far produced is deficient in burning qualities, and
also in smoking aroma, and that that assumption,
which has been widely accepted by the public and the
majority of the growers, has had a lot to do with the
discouragement of the industry, because mfen have
thought that there was no market for Australian
tobacco, and that it was practically impossible to pro-
duce a smokeable tobacco and, consequently, have not
bothered to study the matter to ascertain its possi-
bilities? I am in entire agreement with every word
of that statement.
3810. In view of the facts that have been elicited
by this inquiry, and of which you are cognizant, is
there any justification for continuing to present to the
public and the growers the view that, until the problem
of aroma, is solved, we cannot expect to develop a very
much bigger industry in Australia ?—I do not think
there is any justification for continuing what may be
regarded almost as propaganda against Australian
tobaccos; and I do not think that there are any abso-
lute facts to prove the justification for it.
3811. Would you say that, provided the growers
improve their methods of cultivation and curing, aim-
ing at a very much brighter and better quality tobacco,
that is all that they can reasonably be asked to do?
Exactly. Great improvements are possible in that
direction, and they ought to be encouraged to the
full.


3812,' It would not be fair to superimpose upon those
conditions another condition which appears to be
impossible' of solution so far as they are concerned;
that is, that by some means which nobody can indi-
cate to them, they must infuse a better aroma into the
leaf?— Quite so.
3813. Is that a fair view to take ?—I think that it is
an absolutely fair view.
3814. Well then, seeing that Australian tobacco is
deficient in aroma, who is to shoulder the responsibility
of improving the aroma?—l consider that the problem
will need to be attacked from certain standpoints.
There is the chemical standpoint, and the physiological
standpoint. There will have to be a very thorough
and true scientific investigation. I consider that that
can be done only by a body properly organized for the
conducting of scientific investigation. This problem
might well be, and, in my opinion, should be, given as
one of its functions to the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research. That council is building up
an organization which, with slight additions to staff
and equprnent that would not involve a great deal of
expense, could tackle the problem.
3815. Sir George Julius, Dr. Rivett, and Dr.
Dickson, have put to the committee the view that the
present Australian tobacco investigation should be dis-
continued, and that the whole conduct of the investi-
gations should be handed over to the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research. Do you subscribe
to that view ? —Entirely.
3816. Are you not a member of the executive com-
mittee of the investigation?— Yes.
3817. And from your knowledge of the working of
that committee, do you think that the work of tobacco
investigation, as a Commonwealth function, could be
more efficiently carried out by the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research?—I do.
3818. Can the investigations be conducted on a per-
manent basis under that proposal, and can we be sure
that tobacco investigation will not become a subsidiary
concern of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, and the whole thing be white-anted?—l do
not think there need be any apprehension in that
direction, for the reason that the work of the Council
for Scientific Industrial Research is a complex of many
important independent investigations. The prickly
pear problem, the blow-fly problem, and similar pro-
blems with which the council is concerning itself, are
entirely separate and distinct from each other, but thy
attention which is given to them is not one whit less
on that account. Tobacco investigation would natur-
ally fall within the scope of the work of the Division
of Economic Botany, probably assisted by one or more
of the other divisions. The work of the ..Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, and its method of
handling problems that it has investigated, give confi-
dence that it will not allow important problems to be
white-anted as you suggest. Ido not know of that hav-
ing happened to any problem, the investigation of which
it has undertaken, and I do not see why it should be so.
3819. The other problems you have mentioned pre-
sent only one aspect, that of scientific investigation; in
connexion with tobacco, in addition to scentific investi-
gation there is the economic development of the in-
dustry. If the Council for Scientific and Industrial Re-
search is to concern itself only with the scientific side,
virtually dealing with pests in the industry, what
authority is to control the economic side, such as
experimentation in the field, the right kinds of leaf to
grow, and the economic areas that tobacco-growers can
handle g Would you say that the States can continue
F. 218. —15
to handle that phase satisfactorily?— That plan Would
be in accordance with the existing arrangements with
respect to practically all the work relating to primary
production that the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research is undertaking. It undertakes the scientific
investigation. The application of the methods arising
out of the work of the council are left to the State
organizations. The council has not said, and does not
think, that it can successfully carry out the function
of applying its results in the field and on the farm. It
has not the organization to do so. The building of
such an organization would be an unnecessary duplica-
tion. At the present time the State Departments of
Agriculture have left to them the function of applying
those methods or of engaging in propaganda and in-
structional work based on the discoveries of the council.
An outstanding instance of that is the work that is
proceeding in connexion with a disease called black
disease of sheep, which has been the subject of investi-
gation for three or four years, and that has resulted
in the discovery of a vaccine. The council has been
trying out laboratory produced vaccines on certain
farms in each State. Last year, the stage was reached
when it looked as though a wide range of experimental
application was necessary, and the council sought the
help of the States. Each State agreed to apply this
vaccination method in the case of all farmers who
formerly had the work done under the control of the
State veterinary officers, so that exact observations of
the particular results could be made on a big scale.
About 70,000 sheep are now being handled in different
States by State officers, under the guidance and in-
struction of the investigating officers of the council.
Similarly, whatever emerged from the work of the
council in tobacco investigation would, to my mind, be
oest applied by the State departmental officers, who
are in close daily contact with the farmers concerned.
3820. What would you do with Mr. Slagg. He is
a Commonwealth officer, and his work is not scientific
but experimental field work. How could we hand the
control of an officer like him over to a purely scientific
body like the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research? Would he be at a sort of loose end?—
Yaturally, one hesitates to express an opinion on such
a matter. That would be a question for the determina-
tion of the body to which the whole problem was
handed over.
3821. I have a letter dated the 14th April, the effect
of which is that the executive committee of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation has carried a resolution
agreeing to the proposal made by Mr. Gepp to hand
over to the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research the control of the investigation. If we re-
commend that, we must also consider the position of
Mr. Slagg, who would be under the control of a purely
scientific authority which had no real interest in his
field experimental work. Would you suggest that the
council should take over the responsibility?—l have
already put it to the committee that the necessity for
the continuance of an organization such as the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation does not exist.
3822. Would you suggest that it would be advisable
to establish some new authority to work in conjunction
with the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
a sort of departmental authority that would be respon-
sible for Mr. Slagg and his organization ?—I do not
think that there is any room for an organisation such
as the Australian Tobacco Investigation; there is no
job for it to do.
3823. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company
has so far provided more than half the finance for the
carrying on of Mr. Slagg’s organization and the work
of the investigation. Do you suggest that the Council


for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch should take on
that arrangement and negotiate with the company ?
Yes, and determine to what extent the class of work
that has been carried on in the past should he con-
tinued.
3824. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Ee-
search would be the authority in control of Mr. Slagg
and would hold him responsible to it for his field work ?
—Yes, to the extent that field work was found to be
necessary.
3825. Do you think we can get over that difficulty
by suggesting that Mr. Slagg should be a permanent
officer of the Commonwealth Department of Markets,
and thus be responsible to some ministerial head ?—I
would not suggest that.
3826. Our idea is to have continuity of Common-
wealth control. What have you to say about that ?
I think that recent events have shown that there is no
likelihood of the continuity of control by the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch being interfered
with.
3827. Ho; but is there not a likelihood of cessation
of responsibility? Up to the present the Australian
Tobacco Investigation has been recognised by the Com-
monwealth Government as the proper authority to
appoint Mr. Slagg and to be responsible for his work
and his organization. If that body goes out of exist-
ence we must suggest some other body that will exer-
cise at least some similar measure of responsibility.
Mr. Slagg cannot be employed by the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch? —The Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation was set up as
the result of an agreement between the British-
Australasian Company, the Commonwealth Go-
vernment, and the Governments of the States, for
a definite period of three years, which will expire on
the 30th June next, and on the understanding that in
the event of all parties to the agreement agreeing that
an extension of the time was desirable and was justified
by the work that had been done further funds would
be provided in the manner set out in the agreement.
There is no justification for continuing the kind of
work that the investigation has undertaken.
3828. What work is that ?—lnvestigations concern-
ing the growing of tobacco in districts other than the
present tobacco districts, exploratory work in remote
districts, and so on, a great deal of which has already
been done. A great deal of the work of the Investi-
gation was merely a repetition of what had already
been done; and so far it has not given any indication
of resulting in any great alteration in regard to dis-
tricts, areas, or methods that have been gradually de-
veloped in the past.
3829. I take it you do not consider that there is any
necessity to continue the present Federal experiments
in field work at the termination of this agreement ?—I
think that there will be required a considerable amount
of field work, and the application in the field of the
results of investigation made by the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Eesearch; but the continuance of
field work on the knowledge that at present exists can be
done as well —in my opinion better —by the State
departments as by a federal field tobacco department.
By reason of their smaller areas, greater density of
population, and so on, the States are in close touch
with the farmers and the districts concerned, and can
maintain that touch at much less expense than would
have to be incurred by a federal field organization.
3830. There is one very big flaw iu your argument;
that is, that with the exception of Hew South Wales
and Victoria there has been no advance in the tobacco
industry during at least the last 30 years, and those
are the only States that are making any serious attempt
to develop it ?—For the reasons that you have adduced
and with which I have agreed, concerning the lack of en-
couragement given to the expansion of tobacco growing.
Up till now, the authorities in the other States have
not considered it worth while to set up an organization
because they have known that the States which were
growing tobacco were having difficulty in getting rid of
their product.
3831. After three years you consider that the experi-
ment of having Commonwealth control of field work is
not worth while, and that now that the three years are
up we should terminate it and hand the control back to
the States ?—During those three years, the Tobacco
Investigation has been engaged on work that to my
mind there is no justification for continuing. The
results have not been such as in my opinion to justify
the continuance of that class of work.
3832. Mr. Gepp gave evidence that in his opinion it
would take at least ten years to complete the investi-
gations that have been undertaken in the last three
years. What have you to say to that ?—Speaking out
of a much wider experience, I disagree with that
opinion.
3833. But Sir George Julius and several experts gave
a similar opinion ?—I do not wish to be misunderstood.
I agree that ten years is not an unreasonable time to
suggest as a period during which the alleged aroma
problem can be solved. But I say quite confidently that
it will not be solved by the methods that have been
adopted during the last three years. It will be
solved by a scientific attack by a properly organized
scientific investigation.
3834. Can you say that in view of their record up to
the present, the States will be able to function much
more efficiently in future in conjunction with the Com-
monwealth scientific work ?—I certainly say that if
scientific work is undertaken by the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Eesearch it will place the State
organizations in a much better position to do more
effective field work than they have done in the past.
Here again I do not wish to be misunderstood. I do
not say that a certain amount of field work will not be
necessary; I think it will be necessary in connection
with the laboratory work of the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Eesearch; it will be the material upon
which the council will work. The collection of that
material the exact recording of its origin, its history,
and that sort of thing, will have to be done. That is
all field work. A knowledge of methods of cultivation
and so on will have to be possessed by the scientific
workers, and to that extent a certain amount of obser-
vational field work and experimental field -work will
have to be undertaken along with the laboratory work.
3835. If this is to be an Australian-wide industry do
you not think it will be necessary to have a federal field
expert to co-ordinate the work of the States?— That
raises another question. During the last three years,
no attempt has been made by the States to develop their
organization in any way; they have been marking
time. Take our own State as an example; we have
been in a state of uncertainty for the last two years.
Our Mr. Temple Smith was due to retire two years
ago, but his period of employment has been extended up
to the present time. We do not know quite where we
are. We have not had any chance to make arrange-
ments to continue our existing organization, to add to


it, or to improve it. But if a definite and permanent
arrangement were come to, I have no doubt that the
States in which a field organization was justified, by
reason of the extent of the industry which existed,
would make those arrangements. I can say that for
Victoria,
3836. Until the Commonwealth investigational work
commenced three years ago, was any attempt made to
co-ordinate the work done by the States who were
interested in tobacco growing ?—I do not understand
what you mean by co-ordination.
3837. To exercise a federal supervision over the
work. Tobacco growing is not essentially a State
industry but is common to the whole of Australia. The
Commonwealth Government introduced federal super-
vision of field work in order to spread it over the whole
continent ?—I do not see that there is any necessity
for co-ordination in the sense in which you refer to it,
or in the sense that you consider that an attempt has
been made in the last three years. Ho co-ordination of
that kind is required in connection with any other
successful staple primary industry; each State has its
own separate organization, and they are not over-
looked by a federal officer with a staff in an attempt to
co-ordinate the work.
3838. The reason that the Commonwealth Govern-
ment intervened in this industry was that economically
it is a Federal and not a State industry, because 90 per
cent, of our tobacco is imported, and the Common-
wealth derives a revenue of £7,000,000 a year from it;
so that you cannot possibly compare tobacco with such
industries as, say, wheat or fruit, from which the Com-
monwealth derives no import or excise revenue ?
Assuming that during the last few years the idea has
been to co-ordinate the work or to control the State
work, I say deliberately that it has utterly failed. It
has neither co-ordinated the work nor brought about
an improvement in the State work. To a large extent
the federal organization has had the advantage of, and
been educated by, State staff knowledge and experience.
3839. Would you subscribe to the view that the
States have been hostile to the Australian Tobacco In-
vestigation ever since it began to function?— Certainly
not. I can speak only for my own State.
3840. I am not mentioning any individual State.
Would there be afiy grounds for assuming that State
experts have deliberately refrained from co-operating
in a friendly spirit with Commonwealth experts, and
that they have regarded the activities of the Common-
wealth as an intrusion in their own domain ?—As a
member of the Australian Tobacco Investigation I say
deliberately that, with the exception of one State, in
which it has come to the knowledge of the executive com-
mittee of the Investigation unofficially that there have
been differences between the State expert and the officers
of the Investigation, nothing has reached the committees
to justify the report that there was antagonism between
the State officers concerned and the Investigation’s
officers. Let me emphasize that by stating that the
whole of the information before the committee is to the
effect that very full and liberal help has been given by
the State officers to the staff engaged by the Tobacco
Investigation.
3841. Did not the State Departments of Agriculture
approve of the agreement made by the Development
and Migration Commission with the British-Austral-
asian Tobacco Company?— The State Governments
did, on the advice of the State departments.
3842. Is it not reasonable to assume that, before
agreeing to that, the State departments realised that
there must be definite advantages to be gained by
having a form of Commonwealth organization to carry
out the experimental work ?—The States thought that.
3843. And your opinion, as the result of the experi-
ence of the last three years, is that those expectations
have not been realized?— Exactly.
3844. By Mr. Martens. —Am I right in assuming
that, under the jurisdiction of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation, a certain class of ground in each State
been tested for tobacco growing purposes ?—Yes.
3845. Would it have been possible to do that without
adoption of such a method ?—What have been de-
scribed as exploratory tests could have been carried out
equally well by each of the States, if those States had
considered them worth while. As a matter of fact,
with the exception of three districts, they have already
been carried out in Victoria.
3846. Queensland, South Australia, and Western
Australia have had experimental plots established
under the Australian Tobacco Investigation. Could
the respective Governments of those States have been
induced to establish those plots on their own initiative ?
They would have done so had it appeared to them to
be for the expansion of the industry.
3847. How would you have assured them of that
without experimentation ?—By doing away with what
has been described as unjustifiable propaganda, detri-
mental to Australian tobacco.
3848. What method would you pursue to disabuse
their minds in that direction; could you do it other
than by producing the very thing that would disprove
that propaganda?— These exploratory tests have not
done that, and have never been calculated to do it.
3849. Then what was the idea of having them ?
lo satisfy the Director of Tobacco Investigations as to
the suitability or otherwise of the areas in which the
plots were established.
3850. For the production of a tobacco suitable for
Australian needs ?—Yes.
3851. In the old days, they ceased to grow tobacco
in Queensland because of the prices that were paid ?
Yes, but the position is very different now from what it
was a few years ago. The price paid to Australian
growers has been gradually rising over the last ten or
fifteen years. The Tariff Board’s report gave 22d.
a lb. in 1924. That is very different from the 3s. and
3s. 6d. a lb. that is now paid.
3852. Have you any information showing that a
suitable arrangement can be made with the State De-
partments of Agriculture to carry out the work under
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research?
To carry out the application of the lessons taught by
the work of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, undoubtedly.
3853 And would expert knowledge of tobacco be
required by the person supervising that class of work *
—Certainly.
3854. He would need to have expert knowledge in
regard to the cultivation of tobacco ? Yes.
iW Mr - l ones -~regard to the operations
that take place after the tobacco leaves the grower and
comes into the possession of the manufacturer which
are so scientifically investigated in America, what has
been the practice in Australia ?—The Tobacco Investi-
gation committee requested the Director of Investi


gations to make an investigation of the matter. He
adopted the plan of issuing a questionaire to the
various tobacco firms. The questionaire was replied to
by the different firms concerned, and from my memory
of the answers that were given practically no manu-
facturer except the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany adopted a practice corresponding to the recon-
ditioning, prizing and ageing processes carried out in
America. Some manufacturers regrade the tobacco,
others do not. Some of them keep it for varying
periods up to twenve months, but under a system of
bulk package; they have no redrying plants. The
British-Australasian Tobacco Company has a redrying
plant in both Sydney and Melbourne. The practice of
redrying is carried out in the Melbourne factory in
regard to all their tobaccoes.
3856. Both the re-ordering and the prizing? —Ho.
The dark tobaccoes are stored in boxes. The infor-
mation concerning the bright lemon tobaccoes is some-
what ambiguous. It stated that they were commencing
to store the bright lemon tobaccoes. That is in accord
with the evidence that I heard Mr Bentley give, that
they had recently commenced to accumulate a quantity
of tobacco with a view to holding it and ageing it over
a period. Any disparagement of the bright leaf, due
to aroma or anything of that kind, has come about
during a period when those bright tobaccoes have not
been subject to ageing processes. It is not fair to Aus-
tralian bright leaf to compare it with the bright leaf
imported from America that has been subjected to those
processes. I do not think that there is any justifi-
cation for continuing the disparagement until Aus-
tralian leaf is subjected to similar processes. I am
very glad to know that the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company has undertaken those processes. I
have not at any time made any allegation as to their
not doing so. But in my report dealing with my visit
to America, I stressed very strongly the point that to
my mind it was the second most important function
that the Tobacco Investigation ought to undertake,
the first being to combat blue mould. Any tobacco man
will say that the ageing of tobacco mellows it.
3857. Would you suggest that we can stimulate the
Australian tobacco industry through the agency of the
tariff, or by reducing or abolishing the excise on Aus-
tralian-grown leaf ?—That is an aspect of the matter
upon which I have no decided opinion. The import
duty ought to be sufficient to warrant the payment of
a price that in itself would encourage the growing of
tobacco. But of course I inn aware that both the
import duty and the excise have a revenue object.
Tobacco has been the sport of governments for
revenue purposes ever since the day of James 11. In
the first instance a duty was imposed to stop tobacco
smoking, which was regarded as a dirty habit; but it
was found to be a fine way of filling the coffers of the
king, so he increased it. Such a duty has always been a
source of national revenue in all countries.
3858. The Commonwealth Government noiv receives
in excise considerably more than the grower ?—Yes.
3859. In your report of your visit abroad, you state
that the warehouse staff of the Port of London
Authority maintains a small museum containing
samples of all varieties of tobacco imported, and that
while tobacco from many countries is shown, Australian
leaf is not represented. Would it not be a matter for
the Investigation committee to see that Australian leaf
is represented in such an institution ?—The fact that
they did not have Australian leaf in that museum may
have been accidental. It can be remedied by the officials
at Australia House. A few samples of Australian
;obacco could be sent there.
3860. You also say that in Rhodesia the production
of tobacco increased from 2,810,881 lb. in 1922-23 to
17,420,000 lb. in 1926-27. What would you say to the
suggestion that the man who was responsible for that
marked increase should be invited to visit Australia ?
—I think it was due not to any one man but to the
prohibition of imports.
3861. Would not that seem to indicate that we might
stimulate production in Australia through the agency
of a tariff?—We can do so. Of course they adopted
very severe methods in regard to embargoes and the
restriction of imports.
3862. What period do you suggest would be reason-
able for our bright leaf to undergo the ageing process?
—Yot less than two years.
3863. Until our bright leaf has gone through
that process for two years it has not had a fair try
—Yo.
3864. We saw at Pomonal a plantation on which the
plants were poor, and the opinion of the President of
the Pomonal Tobacco Growers’ Association was that
there was too much nitrogen in the soil. On page 9
of your report you say that flue-cured types of leaf are
only satisfactory when grown on soils with low nitrogen
content, and which are sandy and dry ?—lt is a
definitely accepted fact that high nitrogen content is
undesirable.
3865. Would it result from sheep running on the
land ?—lt is quite likely with heavy sheep stocking.
3866. By the Chairman. —You have said that the
States have not been able to issue any propaganda to
overcome the injurious effects of propaganda directed
against Australian tobacco?— The States are not in a
position to do so. Propaganda involves such a thing
as advertising, or failure to advertise.
3867. Do you remember the stories that were cir-
culated very widely a while ago that eucalytus was,
possibly, a fundamental fault in Australian tobacco ?■—
Yes.
3868. Did your department take any steps to over-
take that story and place the true position before the
public?— Yes, in discussions with the farmers and at
meetings, I believe that our tobacco expert w r as very
prominent in that regard. Our chemists made certain
analyses. There has never been any definite statement
that you could challenge. There has been a sort of
newspaper discussion giving the opinions of this, that,
and the other man, and a lot of mystical references
have been made to certain experiments at Bathurst
and so on. There is such a thing as giving a matter
too much prominence by contradicting it.
3869. Do you not think that if the people get the
idea that Australian tobacco is impregnated with
eucalyptus they will not buy it when it is put on the
market ?—Yes.
3870. Therefore, do you not think that if the States
are to control the field work and the economic aspect
of the industry, it is necessary for them to have some
organization which can deal with that sort of trouble
when it arises?— That story was circulated during the
first twelve months that the Australian Tobacco In-
\ estimation functioned. The States were co-operating
Vvith it, and in a sense were leaving matters to it.
The chairman of the executive committee on two or
three_ occasions issued official statements denying any
association with the view that was being expressed, and
intimating very definitely that nothing had emerged
of a character that would justify in any degree the
assumption that was being promulgated.


3871. Still, no steps were taken by either the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation or the State Departments
to issue to the press definite information that would
convince the public that there was no data of any kind
available; it was merely pointed out that the investi-
gation was not associated in any way with those
rumours, and that so far as it knew they could be dis-
counted ?—As a matter of fact, the executive committee
of the investigation did associate itself with those
experiments at Bathurst, and took them over after the
first two years. It is still conducting them, and is
responsible for their control and the expenditure in-
curred upon them. They were established by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, in conjunction
■with the State Department of Hew South Wales. The
statements concerning the work done during the first
two years were apparently issued precipitately. The
Australian Tobacco Investigation had by this time
taken over the work. It realized that there was no
justification for those statements, and that it must put
itself right with the public on the matter. It adopted
the attitude, which I think was the correct attitude at
the time, inasmuch as it had taken over the experi-
ments, that it must await the result of the experiments.
3872. Do you think that definite steps were taken
by either the Australian Tobacco Investigation com-
mittee or the States Department to indicate that there
was no probability of this theory being justified, and
that it was merely a possibility?—As a matter of fact
the Australian Tobacco Investigation committee did
not feel that at the time.
3873. Until this select committee commenced its
deliberations, the definite idea was broadcast that
eucalyptus taint had been definitely located in Aus-
tralian tobacco?—lt was.
3874. Could not the State Departments or the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation have taken some steps
to insist upon a fair treatment of the issue?—l do
not know to what extent I must regard myself as a
member of the Australian Tobacco Investigation com-
mittee.
3875. This committee finally located what it believed
to be the source of the report, in the evidence of Dr.
Darnell-Smith, of Sydney. He described certain ex-
periments that were conducted. Prom beds that had
been infected with eucalyptus mulch the aroma in the
first year was distinctly bad; but in the second year,
when no fresh mulch was added, the aroma was very
much improved, in fact, it was quite an agreeable
aroma. Dr. Darnell-Smith is a member of the
executive committee of the Australian Tobacco Investi-
gation. That committee, as well as the State Depart-
ment, should have been made acquainted with the true
nature of that experiment, and thus have been enabled
to locate the origin of this story; but no action w r as
taken to reveal to the public the actual nature of
experiments on which it was based. Dr. Darnell-
Smith repudiated any suggestion that he was the
author. Only two other persons were associated with
the experiments—Mr. Tregenna and Mr. McGee, an
expert imported by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company, We have not had the evidence of Mr.
McGee, who is out of the country. But neither Mr.
Tregenna nor Dr. Darnell-Smith will accept responsi-
bility for the authorship, and each has declared that
the other was not the author. That shows how much
out of touch the investigation committee and the State
departments are with the experiments that are being
conducted. Would you care to comment on that?—
I have no objection to making a comment on it. I am
rather surprised to hear the statement concerning Dr.
Darnell-Smith’s denial of his having said and written
that eucalyptus was responsible for the flavour in Aus-
tralian tobacco. Dr, Darnell-Smith made a report in
which he committed himself definitely to the statement
that the influence of eucalyptus upon tobacco grown in
Australia was so pronounced that no soil treatment of
any kind would be capable of overcoming the influence
in those areas where certain species of eucalyptus have
flourished for centuries. He also said that there
seems to be no more probability of getting away from
what is known as the Australian aroma in domestic
tobaccos than of getting rid of the Turkish aroma in
tobacco grown in Australia or of the Havanna aroma
from tobacco grown in Cuba, as the aroma of Aus-
tralian tobacco was quite as distinct as either of the
others.
8876. It is quite clear from the evidence of Dr.
Darnell-Smith that three men originated the eucalyptus
experiments—he, Mr. McGee, and Mr. Tregenna. Both
he and Mr. Tregenna disclaimed responsibility for
originating the theory that Australian tobacco has a
fundamental eucalyptus taint. Dr. Darnell-Smith
has explained that so far as the investigation has gone,
not only is the theory totally unproved, but that quite
the reverse is the case; that at the end of the second
year, not a bad but a good effect could be obtained.
Have you any comment to make on that?—As a
matter of fact the Australian Tobacco Investigation
committee realizing the lack of justification for the
very definite statements made under the signature of
Dr. Darnell-Smith, suppressed the report.
3877. Are you aware that certain organizations, or
groups of persons calling themselves companies, are
issuing prospectuses, one emanating from Hew Zealand
and another from Queensland, asking people to take
up shares in those companies for the purpose of
engaging in tobacco cultivation in Hew Zealand and
Queensland, and that in at least one of those reports
it is indicated that tobacco grown in all other parts of
Australia, with the exception of Queensland and Hew
Zealand is likely to be affected by a bad aroma, pre-
sumably due to the eucalyptus taint?—l have seen one
or two of those prospectuses, and I know that a num-
ber of company promotors are on the job, but I have
not come across that particular statement.
3878. Mr. Tregenna’s evidence agreed with the state-
ments made in bulletin Ho. 2 issued by Mr. Slagg.
Do you not think that is a vindication of the work
which Mr. Slagg has done during the last two and a
half years?— Apparently so, in Mr. Tregenna’s
opinion.
3879. He also made the definite statement that in
his opinion we cannot grow high grade tobacco in either
Victoria or Hew South Wales. When the tobacco
expert of the biggest tobacco-growing State in the
Commonwealth publicly makes that statement, and
says that we shall have to go to another State to grow
tobacco, do you not think that it is evidence of the neces-
sity for some form of federal supervision?—l do not
think that there is justification for taking that view.
It is merely a question of the committee placing a
value upon that evidence in the light of other evidence
that is placed before it.
3880. Mr. Tregenna has been the tobacco expert in
Hew South Wales for fifteen years. Does it not
indicate that in that period at least one State has not
succeeded in advancing the prospects of the industry?—
He cannot have had the opinion during the fifteen
years. If he has, he is a dishonest man.
3881. He says that Horth Queensland is the only
place that will grow high-grade tobacco. What have
you to say?— That is merely an opinion.


3882. From your knowledge of Victoria, would you
subscribe to that view?—l would not.
3883. Do you not think that that lack of faith by the
State departments in their own possibilities has had a
big influence upon keeping to its present level the Aus-
tralian tobacco industry?—lf that view has been held
by Mr. Tregenna for any length of time, or harbored
in his mind without being expressed, it certainly would
have had an effect not only in the direction of not
encouraging the expansion of tobacco-growing, but also
in not making attempts to improve matters. We have
never held that belief in Victoria. We have made
encouraging attempts at improvements. Success has
attended our efforts at Pomonal. There would emerge
a very definite success in other tobacco-growing dis-
tricts if they had commercial encouragement.
3884. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you not think that the
eucalyptus theory was a legitimate one, and that in
the interests of the industry, it ought to have been tried
out ?—I do not think it was a legitimate theory. The
moment I heard it my mind visualized our butters,
our wines, and other products that grow on eucalyptus
soils, or soils upon which the eucalyptus has been the
only vegetable for aeons.
3885. Is not any theory that is not a manifestly
one a fair subject for scientific research, to
determine one way or the other?— Yes.
3886, One of the greatest complaints in regard to our
butter to-day is that it is affected by a taint from the
box in which it is packed. Is not that so?— Yes.
3887. Do you not think that this theory was one
which, in the interests of the tobacco growing industry
in Australia, should have been investigated?— Yes.
3888. And because it is now being tried out and
has so far proved to be a theory that will not hold
water, is it not a good thing for the industry?—l have
been very disappointed that there has been no public
announcement of such disproof.
3889. As a matter of fact, Dr. Darnell-Smith has
never attempted to avoid the accusation that he was the
originator of the idea; he has publicly stated so?—He
is rather proud of it, I believe.
3890. By the Chairman. —l asked you earlier
whether you had any knowledge of prospectuses having
been issued by company promotors in which it was
suggested that Hew Zealand and Queensland were the
only places in Australasia where we were likely to grow
taint free tobacco; and you said that you had not seen
that statement. I have before me the prospectus of
Pacific Tobacco Industries Australasia Ltd., incor-
porated in Hew Zealand under The Companies Act
1908 with a capital of 90,000 shares of £1 each. Para-
graph 10 says:—
Answering an investor’s queries: The Liverpool Tobacco
brokers report that New .Zealand leaf is the finest in the world
and they can market as much as can be produced. New
Zealand tobacco is very much superior to Australian grown
owing to the eucalyptus tree not growing in New Zealand.
Does not that appear to be a definite attempt to
capitalize the theory that has been advanced that Aus-
tralian tobacco is suffering from this taint?—lt does.
It is only fair to say that the executive committee has
loyally attempted right throughout the piece, to come to
its conclusions on the basis of the reports of its officers,
particularly the Director of Investigations, and that up’
to the present it has not been told that the eucalyptus
theory has been disproved. Indeed, it has been rather
encouraged to believe that there may still be some
justification for it and that another season’s work will
be required.
3891. Was the executive committee made aware of
the actual nature of the experiments that Dr. Darnell-
Smith, Mr. Tregenna and Mr. McGee were carrying
out ?—Yes.
3892. Was the view placed before you that in the
second year there was an improvement?— Yes,
3893. How can the executive committee accept the
theory that, if you continue with those experiments, you
must come back to a worse condition?— Because it has
been told that it has to wait another year, and that there
is still a possibility that it may be proved.
3894. Do you think it reasonable that in the third
year you would revert to the original state of the taint?
—I would not, and never have; but our director of
investigations told us that.
3895. Mr. Tregenna’s evidence, beginning at question
1396, reads:—
Would you fix a period for experiments to be carried out by
the Commonwealth?—No; but I do not think there should be a
permanent department.
Do you agree with Mr. Gepp that it will probably take 10
years to complete the federal experiments?— That is a fair
period. It is necessary that the man who undertakes the
experiments should be given sufficient time to do his job
thoroughly.
Do you agree with Mr. Gepp that 90 per cent, of the efforts
of scientists is negative?——l prefer not to express an opinion.
Do you consider it reasonable that the federal investigation
should be continued for 10 years, subject to some effective
scheme of co-operation with the States?— Yes.
Would that cause you to modify your view that the
federal investigation as it is carried on at present can
be handed over to the Council for Scientific and Indus-
trial Research on a new basis?— Ho. That statement
about 90 per cent, of scientific investigation being
negative is ambiguous. If it means that 90 per cent, of
scientific investigations are of no use, it is entirely
wrong; or at all events, I disagree with it. Negative
results from experimentation are obtained more fre-
quently than positive results.
_ 3896. Mr. Gepp explained that 10 per cent, was your
dividend and the other 90 per cent. was the capital
invested. What is your view?—l agree with him.
3897. Do you not think that 10 years is the minimum
period in which we can expect to get from the work
that is being carried on by Mr. Slagg the maYirmim
results for the expenditure that is incurred?—l do not
think that the co-ordination of the work, along the lines
on which it has been carried on by Mr. Slagg, so far as
what is alleged to be the main problem is concerned,
would justify any continuance.
3898. And if Mr. Slagg’s work is discontinued at the
end of the three-year period do you think that we can
safely hand over to the State authorities the work that
has been done, and expect to get much more substantial
results than were obtained prior to the inauguration of
the federal investigation?—lf the work undertaken by
the Council for Scientific Investigation and Research
in lieu of the present w T ork resulted in suggestions for
advance and that sort of thing, I think that the work
would be undertaken by the States; and if it were not,
that would be time enough for the Commonwealth to
step in in those States which did not undertake it. But
I should say that, so far as the States of Victoria and
Hew South Wales are concerned—at all events, Victoria
—it certainly would be carried on. In other words, the
kind of work that has been done in Victoria can be
carried on by the State authorities just as well without
the control of the Director of Investigations as with it.
It has done so, and has received no inspiration from
that control during the last three years. Rather has it
given inspiration and assistance.


3899. Is it not a fact that you have experienced very
great difficulty in securing a successor to Mr. Temple
Smith?—lt is.
3900. Does not tfiat indicate that there will be a lack
of experienced men to carry on the work in the future,
and that investigation will be seriously handicapped
from a State point of view?—lSTo. I venture to say
that, if the conditions had been settled three years ago,
12 months before Mr. Temple Smith was due to retire,
by this time or earlier there would have been an officer
Avho would have been quite competent to continue his
work. Throughout my experience as Director of
Agriculture in Victoria I have had to face the problem
of meeting emergencies in other branches of agriculture,
where new subjects have had to be taken up and no
one had had experience of them, and I have had to
materialize the staff. I realized very early in my career
as Director of Agriculture that I could do no good
in my department unless I materialized a staff of
scientifically-trained men. Consequently I induced the
Government to reorganize the department and prac-
tically to establish the university course on agriculture,
so providing a flow of scientifically-trained men to staff
the department. We now have in our department no
fewer than 33 degree men, who have largely taken the
place of the older type of what might be termed self-
trained experts and who have been responsible in other
agricultural directions, such as wheat culture, for the
advances that have taken place in recent years, whereby
the materialization of wealth from the wheat industry
in Victoria can be definitely measured in terms of
hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum, or, it
might be said, of millions over a period of years. That
is what has to be done when you have to look ahead
and train your men. I have in the department officers
who, I have no doubt whatever, in the course of 12
months, if switched on to tobacco work, would be com-
pletely effective men. One man in particular I have
in mind; but the position has been so uncertain that he
has been utilized in other directions. It has not been
worth while to give him a 12 months’ training and rob
of his services the activity in which he is now engaged.
3901. Is it the intention of your department to have
a full-time man on the work when Mr. Temple-Smith
retires ? —lt depends wholly upon what happens in con-
nexion with this organization. We do not know what
is going to happen, and we are marking time. We
recently appointed a young officer as a field officer on
tobacco work. We have taken no steps to replace Mr.
Marks, for the same reason. But the tobacco industry
in Victoria is such that the Government, I feel quite
sure, would respond to its necessities, whatever they
might be, in the future, in the application of that which
would emerge from the activities of the Council for
Scientific Investigation and Research. I think that the
same thing would apply in the other States. In
Western Australia the financial burden has not been
shouldered by the State department, but quite a lot of
work has been done by State officers under the aegis of,
and financed by, the tobacco investigation executive
committee.
3902. You have prepared a statement outlining the
work of your department? —Yes.
For convenience, the Department’s work may be regarded as
falling under two headings;-
1. Experiment and research investigation in the field and
in the laboratory.
2. Instructional and propaganda activities amongst
growers.
As regards the former, such work has been carried on at
Wahgunyah Nursery and Burnley Gardens Plant Research
Laboratory (departmental institutions) and on areas on
selected farms, and may be summarised as follows: —
WAHGUNYAH NURSERY.
(1) Variety Plots. —Variety plots of pipe, cigarette, cigar,
and Turkish tobacco, comprising from 15 to 29 varieties
each season, with the object of ascertaining the most suitable
for the improvement of quality, yield and resistance to disease
(blue mould in particular). As the result of these tests,
officers have been able to recommend certain varieties to
growers for special areas and purposes.
(2) Seed acclimitization. —Tobacco seed has been imported
from time to time from the United States of America, selected
for its apparent suitability to Victorian conditions, tested
and acclimatized, and distributed to growers, as desired. Not
less than 500 growers in Victoria have been supplied with
seed produced at this nursery, which has there been shown as
likely to succeed under local conditions, while some varieties
have proved unsuitable and have not been sent out.
(3) Seed selections. —A system of seed selection is followed
at Wahgunyah from plants truest to type, with early ripening
propensities and healthy appearance and showing the other
qualities desired. The seed so saved is distributed to intending
growers. Quantities of less than one ounce are supplied free
for experimental purposes, and for larger quantities a charge
of 3s. Od. per ounce is made.
(4) Seed bed experiments. —Many different types of seed
beds for raising tobacco plants to the transplanting stage have
been tried out. These have been primarily designed to mani-
fest the best methods to produce strong, early plants, but
also to lessen the incidence of, and loss from blue mould
disease in the seed beds. The following different types of beds
have been subject of test:—Raised beds for good drainage and
level beds; beds covered with grass; cold frame beds covered
with glass or cheesecloth or hessian or uncovered brick frame
beds covered with glass, cheesecloth and uncovered; beds treated
with farmyard manure and/or artificial fertilizers; beds with
sub-surface irrigation; hot beds. Variations in the seasonal
period for seeding has been tried to ascertain the best times
to sow. Heavy or light sowings have also been subject of
test. Further remarks re seed beds will be found under the
heading of diseases.
(5) Fertilizer tests. —Each season, areas of from 3 acres to
5 acres have been devoted to fertilizer experiments with the
object of determining the treatments of value for the improve-
ment of grade, colour, smoking qualities (burn, aroma, tex-
ture ) and yield per acre. The area of each plot varied from
1/10 th acre to l/4th acre. In addition, an area of several
acres has been grown annually as a test of any experimentally
proved treatment on a commercial scale. The experiments com-
prised plots treated singly and with combinations of nitro-
genous, potassic, and phosphatic fertilizers of organic and in-
organic origins, and in varying quantities with interspersed
check plots which received no fertilizer. Lime, magnesia, and
other soil adjuvants have also been tested. The ploughing in
of stable manure and cover crops for green manure has been
tested.
The application of the fertilizers by different methods such
as drilling, broadcasting, sowing in the furrows, sowing before
or after planting, has also been subject of experiment.
The results of this experimental work have been published
from time to time, but, shortly, it may be said that nitrogenous
fertilizers (especially nitrate of soda, and sulphate of am-
monia) except in small quantity in the early stages of the
crop, are liable to injure the colour and render the leaf diffi-
cult to ripen and cure.
Potash fertilizers have given negligible results, while lime
has, if anything, a detrimental effect on the quality of the
leaf. It has been shown that superphosphate is the most
valuable fertilizer and can be conveniently used in quantities
up to 500 lb. per acre on poor soils, and to 1,000 lb. per acre
on rich flats with advantage.
(6) Planting methods. —Experiments have been carried out
to ascertain whether hill or ridge planting is an improvement
on level planting, which latter is the generally adopted system
in Victoria. It has been found that level planting gives the
best result over a long period of years, especially where irriga-
tion is not practised.
(7) Crop culture. —Experiments over many years in the cul-
tivation of the crop include deep or shallow ploughing, hand
planting or machine planting, hilling up, topping high or low,
intercultivation with the plough or scuffler, ridging, leaf prim-
ing and stalk harvesting.
(8) Irrigation. —Experiments in irrigation have been carried
on at various times at the Wahgunyah Nursery, and the ex-
perimental orchard at Bamawn, also at Wyuna and other
places, show that no hard and fast rule can be laid down
as to to the number of waterings required, a dry or moist
season, and the stage of growth of the crop, varying its
requirements. Certainly over-watering has a bad effect, and


especially watering after the flowering stage. Irrigation is
now being practised on a commercial scale by growers in a
number of the tobacco districts.
(9) Curing and smoking tests. —Flue-curing experiments
have been carried out at Wahgunyah Nursery and smoking
tests of the leaf of both pipe and cigarette tobaccoes grown
on the various plots.
FIELD EXPERIMENTS ON FARMERS’ PLOTS.
In the established tobacco districts such as the Ovens and
King Valleys, and Pomonal, quarter-acre experimental plots
(variety and manurial plots) have been carried on for several
successive seasons on private farms. Similarly, experimental
plots have been conducted in many parts of the State with
the object of determining the suitability of the soils and other
environmental factors for the establishment of the tobacco
industry in these districts.
The districts covered have included Ararat, Buffalo River,
Cann River, Drouin, Dimboola, Freeburgh, Flaggy Creek, Gun-
bower, Harcourt, Murrungowar, Pomonal, Orbost, Shepparton,
and Walwa.
Over the last two seasons the “ exploratory ” part of this
plot work has been done in co-operation with the Tobacco
Investigation Committee at Cann River, Flaggy Creek, Har-
court, Gunbower, Myrtleford, Murrungowar, Orbost and Shep-
parton, in three of which districts exploratory work had not
been done previously.
BARN-CURING EXPERIMENTS.
The first flue curing was done in Victoria at Cheshunt, King
River Valley, in 1901, by Mr. Temple Smith and Mr. James
Travor. At that time Mr. Temple Smith was a tobacco-grow r er
on his property at Cheshunt.
The first departmental effort in this regard was conducted
in 1912 at the farm of Messrs. Rae Bros., Gapsted, on whose
property departmental field experiments were being carried
out at the time, and flue-curing demonstrations were given to
growers.
The war having interfered with progress and experimental
work, it w'as not until 1919 that flue-curing caught on, the
system being largely assisted by demonstrations of the de-
partment, and by the action of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, and the Department of Agriculture in mak-
ing grants of assistance for the erection of flue-curing barns.
Following on the decision of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, in 1923, to purchase none but flue-cured
tobacco, practically all the tobacco grown in Victoria has
been flue-cured, although the imposing of this condition pre-
vents the growing of many varieties of the Burley and other
types of tobacco, which are largely grown as pipe tobaccoes
in America and the specific qualities of which are best
developed by air-curing.
DISEASE INVESTIGATION.
Investigations are conducted into diseases and insect pests
affecting the tobacco crop whenever such prevail, but the
disease known as blue mould, which is by far the most serious
of the diseases that have ever appeared in Victoria, has been
subject of practically continuous investigation in its various
phases.
The investigational work involved has comprised field work
on farms of growers, and at the Wahgunyah and Burnley
Experimental Stations and in the Plant Pathological and
Chemical Laboratories. The work has included experiments

DURING THE PERK
in the raising of plants in districts warmer and earlier and
remote from the growing districts, the largest experiments
in this regard being conducted at Wahgunyah Nursery, and
its adoption by growers on areas further afield has proved a
most practical method of meeting the trouble up to the
j (resent.
The Marks system of growing plants under glass with
superficial heating and underground watering has also been
subject of trial.
The plant pathologists of the department, Messrs. Brittle-
bank and Adam, have conducted specific investigations and
researches into various aspects of the disease. The field work
of the plant pathologists has included spraying methods in
respect of epidemics of the disease induced artificially by
atomizing the beds and plants with spores of the fungus.
Investigations based on manurial treatment have also been
carried out.
The search for a possible resistant strain of tobacco plants
has been prosecuted since 1924 by successive annual selection of
plants which showed the greatest resistance to blue mould
under both natural and artificial occurrence of the disease.
Investigations were also made resulting in proof that in-
fected plants which over-wintered in the field, harboured the
fungus, and, during spring reproduced it in the form that
could have permitted its spread.
Laboratory investigations have been carried out to deter-
mine definitely the species of fungus and its life-cycle, and
such problems as (a) the viability and conditions for the
germination of the comidial or summer spores of the fungus.
(&) the incubation period of the fungus under different con-
ditions of temperature, (c) the susceptibility of different
plants parts to infection.
Studies have also been made in the distribution of fungus
throughout defective plants, resulting in the knowledge that
all parts of the plant are invaded —leaves, roots and stems
to the seed head itself.
The Agricultural Research Chemist and staff of the Chemical
Laboratory have been engaged from time to time in making
extensive soil analyses of both present and prospective tobacco-
growing areas in different parts of the State. Analyses of
tobacco leaf in various conditions have also been made.
MISCELLANEOUS.
The department has been instrumental in opening up a
market for Victorian leaf in Western Australia, and demon-
strations and lectures are a regular feature of the Better
Farming train when its tours include any of the tobbacco-
growing districts. Curing and grading demonstrations, and
lectures on all phases of the industry have been given in all
important tobacco-growing centres, and are a regular seasonal
procedure by the departmental officers engaged on tobacco
work. Meetings of growers are regularly attended for the
purpose of supplying information that may be required.
For the last four years short addresses have been given
periodically over the air by 3LO.
The department has undertaken publication of bulletins
and leaflets from time to time for distribution amongst growers
and prospective growers, and articles are published at intervals
in the departmental journal.
Consignments of tobacco leaf have been sent to England
for exhibition and report by the trade, and ultimate sale.

SUMMARY.
Total average cost each year, £1,847 3s. 6d.
3903. By Mr. Slagg. —-As a member of the
executive committee you are aware that we have grown
tobacco in what are called exploratory test plots in
various parts of the Commonwealth? —Yes.
3904. You are also aware of reports that have been
made from time to time on those tests? —Yes.
3905. You are aware that we have found intrinsic-
ally different aromas in tobacco grown on ground in
different parts of the Commonwealth?— That has been
reported to the committees; but the finding of that
aroma has been on a basis that I do not consider at
all scientific, nor is it worth while to pay any attention
to it. I have communicated my view of that to the
executive committee practically on every occasion that
the reports have been presented.
3906. Assuming that the evidence so far collected by
the investigation is correct, and that we have in West-
ern Australia an aroma intrinsically different from
that exhibited by tobacco grown in Victoria, and that
again the aroma of the tobacco grown in Northern
Queensland is intrinsically different from either of
those two, do you not think it is definitely a Common-
wealth problem to decide what to do with those
tobaccoes?—First of all, I do not assume that; and
secondly, those tests have been made with raw leaf,
cured under different conditions and with different
degrees of success.
3907. But surely as a member of the executive com-
mittee you must know that those tests have been made
on leaf which was aged as well as on leaf which Avas
fresh from the curing barn?—l do not know that. I
do not think there is anything in Bulletin No. 2, which
describes those tests, to indicate the character of the
ageing or the quantities concerned. Ido not regard
tobacco as having been subjected to the ageing process
unless it has been prized in considerable quantities.
3908. With regard to the processing of Australian
tobacco, you mentioned a report prepared by the
Director of Investigations that discussed the methods
adopted in connexion Avith the packing and ageing of
Australian leaf. Do you recall that that report stated
quite definitely that modern methods Avere being used
with respect to the largest portion of the leaf packed
in Australia? —I referred specifically to the answers
given to the questionnaire, not to any report.
3909. Do you suggest that the executive would be
agreeable to haA r e that report tendered in evidence?—
Yes, I do not think they would object to that.
3910. Do you mean to state it as your definite
opinion that the aroma of leaf tobacco is due to the
process of ageing after the leaf has been packed?— No.
I have explained exactly what I mean in that regard,
in a way that I think the members of the committee
understand. At least, lam satisfied with the explana-
tion I have given of my views in that regard.
3911. You inferred that the tobacco was a crop
which could not he influenced by the methods employed
by the growers?— Nothing of the kind. I am too ex-
perienced an agriculturist to make that suggestion. I
would no more think of making it than of saying that
the grower could not influence the quality of his grapes,
his peaches, or his wheats.
3912. Would you suggest that aroma in flue-cured
leaf tobacco can be definitely changed in character by
ageing?—l do not quite understand the question.
3913. Can the character or the kind of aroma present
in flue-cured tobacco be changed during the ageing
process?—lf you will tell me what the character of
aroma is, I will answer the question.
3914. The character of aroma is the quality of
aroma. You have a certain quality of aroma which is
quite comparable to the quality of the flavour in
apples. You know that the Mackintosh apple has
different flavour from the Delicious apple. Would you
say that the aroma of flue-cured tobacco could be
definitely changed in character during the ageing
process ? —There is the fullest scientific justification
for the belief that aroma is developed in tobacco leaf
during the post-growing period.
3915. Are you not aware that that is definitely
contrary to the results of the experimental Avork thus
far conducted by the Tobacco Investigation?— But the
decision of the Tobacco Investigation concerning
aroma and character of aroma is so based that I have
no faith in it; it is based upon smoking tests made by
persons whose identity has never been disclosed to the
committee. The circumstances under which the tests
were carried out has never been disclosed and generally
the material used has not been of such a character as to
give me any faith whatever in those tests.
3916. Are you not aware that the material used in
the State of \ ictoria was selected by your oavu expert ?
—I believe that some of it was; but the history of that
tobacco has not been disclosed to the committee.
3917. Do you not feel that you are walking on rather
dangerous ground in discussing the question of aroma ?
—Not in the slightest. My evidence is sworn eAudence.
I am Avilling at any time to produce chapter and verse
Avhich to any reasonable man will constitute satis-
factory backing and support for every statement that
I have made.
3918. By Mr. Swinson.— ls it not a fact that in
America tobacco leaf is bought on colour, texture and
quality?— That would appear to be the case; also on
a knoA\dedge of the district in Avhich it is grown.
The witness withdrew.

DEVELOPMENT AND MIGRATION COMMISSION.—TRUST FUND TOBACCO-GROWING INVESTIGATION ACCOUNT.


1. FINANCIAL PROCEDURE.
Expenditure in connexion with the Australian Tobacco In-
vestigation is made from a special trust fund created by the
Commonwealth Treasury, to which the contributions from
the parties to the agreement—the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited, the Commonwealth
Government, and the Governments of the mainland States —
are credited.
Under the agreement authority to incur expenditure from
this trust fund is vested in the Executive Committee, but,
with a view to facilitating the purchase of minor equipment,
the chairman, on the committee’s behalf, has authorized the
Director of Tobacco Investigations, Mr. C. M. Slagg, to incur
individual items of expenditure up to £25 in any one case
without reference to himself or the executive. In the absence
of the director this authority is delegated to the secretary,
Mr. S. Fowler.
All items of expenditure over £25 must first be approved
by the Executive Committee, or by the chairman acting on
its behalf. The allocation by the executive of any round
sum for any programme of work does not obviate the neces-
sity for submission to the chairman, or the Executive Com-
mittee, for approval all items over £25 covered by the ap-
propriation.
In the absence of the chairman, authority to approve of
expenditure from the trust fund is delegated to Dr. A. C. D.
Rivett, and, if he be absent, to Dr. S. S. Cameron, and, if he
also be absent, to Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith.
2. COMMENCEMENT OF ACTIVITIES OF THE
AUSTRALIAN TOBACCO INVESTIGATION.
The offer of financial assistance by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited wuis made on the 14th
April, 1927, and accepted by the Commonwealth Government
on the 28th April, 1927; on the same day the Governments
of the mainland States were invited by the Prime Minister to
co-operate in the proposed investigation. This invitation was
accepted; the last acceptance (Xew r South Wales) wais made
on the Bth August, 1927.
The first meeting of the Executive Committee was held on the
31st May, 1927, and the first contribution to the trust fund,
i.e., that of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Pro-
prietary Limited, was made on the 25th August, 1927.
As practically no investigational work was instituted by
the Executive Committee prior to the Ist July, 1927, and as
that date is especially convenient in that it marks the com-
mencement of the fiscal year, it may be, and is, regarded as
the date from which the Australian Tobacco Investigation
commenced, and as marking the beginning of the first three-
year period covering the financial obligations of the contract-
ing partiesto the tobacco agreement.
3. CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TRUST FUND.
The agreement between the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company Proprietary Limited, the Commonwealth Govern-
ment and the Governments of the mainland States provided
that during the first three years of the investigation the
tobacco company should contribute the sum of £20,000, the
Commonwealth Government £5,000, and each of the main-
land States £l,OOO, making a total of £30,000.
Up to the present time (the Bth April, 1930) contributions
have been received as follows: —
British-Australasian Tobacco Company Pro-
prietary Limited . . . . . . 15,000

(a) Contribution by the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion TO THE COST OF ERECTING THE GREENHOUSE AND
Refrigerating and Heating Plant of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research at Canberra.
At a meeting of the executive committee held on the 19th
November, 1929, it was agreed to contribute the sum of
£1,500 towards the cost of erecting the plant house of the
Division of Economic Botany at Canberra, in consideration
of provision being made for the use of certain portions in
connexion with tobacco investigations. It is understood that
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research are at
present seeking Ministerial authority to proceed with the
work, and that some £15,000 has been acquired for the
purpose.

Excluding salaries and travelling expenses of Investigational Staff and Field Officers.
3920. Dr. Angell has been receiving £7OO a year
since the Ist January?— That is the date on which he
commenced work on tobacco investigation. It does not
necessarily mean that he has been receiving a full time
payment since that date. The basis of his association
with the Tobacco Investigation is similar to mine; his
department claims only for the time that he actually
spends on tobacco investigation, and at that rate.
3921. Is this in addition to some other salary that he
receives? —No. I understand that that is his salary as
an officer of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research.
3922. Why is the whole of that amount charged to the
Tobacco Investigation?— The charge is only for the
time that he spends on tobacco investigation. He may
spend only three months in the year on that work. In
that case the charge would be only a quarter of £7OO.
3923. From the Ist January to the 31st December,
1929, what did Dr. Angell receive? —From the Ist
January, 1929, to the 31st March, 1930, he received
£286 14s. 6d. on account of the w r ork which he did in
connexion with tobacco investigation.
3924. Do you not think that a statement like this is
likely to lead to very great confusion? —It might,
according to whom it was presented. From the Ist
July, 1927, to the 31st May, 1929, I received a total of
£356.
3925. The amount shown is the maximum that can
be drawm if the whole year is spent on tobacco investi-
gation?— Yes.
3926. Who is to decide to what extent you work on
tobacco investigation ? —ln my case it is left to me. I
am expected to discharge the duties of secretary of the
Tobacco Investigation as well as other investigational
work. I indicate that, over a period of a fortnight or
a month, I have spent, say 20 per cent, or 50 per cent,
of my time on tobacco investigation. I give broadly
an indication of the time that I have thus spent.
3927. Would it be possible under this arrangement
for an officer in your position to put in a statement
claiming the whole of the salary allotted for the year,
and be the judge of whether you had done that amount
of work, although you might have done only 20 per
cent, or 50 per cent.? —That would be impossible.
3928. Who decided what amount of work is done for
the Tobacco Investigation by Dr. Angell? —The
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
3929. What evidence has the council upon which to
come to a decision? —-I assume that it is submitted by
Dr. Angell. I believe that the actual time is cheeked
by the Director of Investigations, Mr. Slagg. We
accept the statement of claim of the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research.
3930. Is Dr. Dickson the authority who decides the
amount of salary to be paid to Dr. Angell on account
of the work that he does for the Tobacco Investiga-
tion ?—He is the immediate authority between Dr.
Angell and the council, but the final authority is the
council itself.
3931. Does that apply to the other members of the
Tobacco Investigation?—No, the others are full-time
officers of the Tobacco Investigation.
3932. The statement shows that Dr. Darnell-Smith
receives a salary of £250 per annum. Does he get that
merely by virtue of his being a member of the executive
committee, or in return for some specific service that
he renders ?—I take it that he receives that sum for the
specific services which are employed in his association
with the executive committee.
3933. Is it a sort of retaining fee?— One must hark
back to the tobacco agreement. It was laid down in the
offer made by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company that the Development and Migration Com-
mission and the Executive of the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research, acting conjointly, should
appoint a third member to the executive committee
who might receive such salary as they might determine.
At that time Dr. Darnell-Smith’s appointment was
made on the understanding that he possessed a good
deal of scientific knowledge of tobacco-growing, and
he was regarded as the consultant on the executive
committee.
3934. In return tor that service as consultant,
whether it was availed of or not by the committee, he
was to receive a fixed fee of £250 a year? Yes.
3935. He has been receiving that since the 30th
November, 1927?— Yes.


3936. Supposing that no call was made on his
services, would he still receive that £250? —I assume
that he would.
3937. How is it paid?— Quarterly.
3938. Dr. Dickson receives a similar amount. Is that
in addition to his ordinary salary as an employee of
the Council for Scientilic and Industrial Research? —
Ho. It is an agreed upon proportion of his ordinary
salary.
3939. Since the Ist January, 1929, £5OO a year has
been going out to these two gentlemen for some services
that they may or may not have rendered? —Yes, it is
certainly paid for services expected without any stipu-
lation as to what services are expected, except that you
might regard as a stipulation the expectation that Dr.
Dickson will assist the Director of Investigations on the
research committee, and that Dr. Darnell-Smith will
carry out such work as may be expected of him from
time to time.
3940. The only man who is definitely charged for
any research work is Dr. Angell; he has a definite
obligation?—He is engaged on a specific job.
3941. Is any supervision exercised over Mr. Howell ?
—Mr. Howell works largely on his own responsibility ;
subject, of course, to the direction of the Director of
Investigations. He is a definite employee of the
Tobacco Investigation.
3942. Was he appointed by the director, or by the
Investigation?—By the Investigation.
3943. The amount of £490 is set opposite the name
of Mr. Marks. Where is he stationed? —His head-
quarters are in Melbourne, but his work may take him
to other States. I understand that the largest part of
his work is in Victoria.
3944. Is he a full time man?— Yes.
3945. He has no connexion with the State
authorities? —Ho, he has severed his connexion with
the State.
3946. Where is Mr. Hill? —I understand largely in
Victoria and Hew South Wales. I am not altogether
aware, at times, of the movements of these officers.
Haturally, they come under the direction of the
Director of Investigations.
3947. Does not the director report to you as the
secretary of the Tobacco Investigation, as to what these
officers are doing, and give you some idea as to where
they are discharging their duties? —Ho such intimate
report is presented.
3948. The whole matter is left in the hands of the
director? —It is his responsibility.
3949. Where is Mr. McCrohan located?—ln the
office of the director in Melbourne.
3950. What do his duties consist of? —General
clerical work.
3951. Is he a full time man? —Yes.
3952. What procedure do you adopt when you want
to get some more money from the company ?—We send
a statement of account and intimate that more funds
are required in accordance with the terms of the agree-
ment. It is generally paid over within 24 hours.
3953. Does the company keep in touch with you to
know how the money is being spent?— Ho. Ho formal
or personal request has ever been received by me for
particulars as to the manner in which the money has
been spent. I should say that the company’s attitude
is one of implicit faith in our integrity.
3954. Do they never ask you for a statement as to
how the money has been expended? —Ho.
3955. Do you submit any reports to them? —-Hone
other than the formal reports issued by the Investiga-
tion.
3956. By Mr. Martens. —ln the case of Mr.
Tregenna there is an amount of £216 17s. 4d. on
account of salary, and £229 os. 4d. for travelling
expenses. What work was done by Mr. Tregenna for
that? —I should say that that represents wholly the
reimbursement of the Hew South Wales Government
of that portion of Mr. Tregenna’s salary for the period
that he was associated with the Tobacco Investigation.
You possibly remember that at one time an economic
survey party was appointed, and for that purpose Mr.
Tregenna was seconded to the Investigation. The State
Government was reimbursed his salary during the
time he was thus engaged.
3957. Does the same thing apply to Mr. Temple
Smith? —Yes, as well as to Mr. Bainbridge and Mr.
Howell. They were members of the first economic
survey party. Howell has been with the Investigation
for a longer period than any other technical officer.
3958. How do you account for the large amount of
travelling expenses paid to Dr. Darnell-Smith? —He
must have done a good deal of travelling. I have
already submitted to your secretary details of the
amounts paid to Dr. Darnell-Smith as the scientific
member of the executive committee, and the amount
paid to him during his visit to America, when he was
paid at the rate of salary he was receiving from the
Hew South Wales Government, wffiich, I think, was
£9OO a vear.
3959. Where would the travelling expenses of Dr.
Angell be incurred ? —He has made one visit at least
to Horthern Queensland, and he has also travelled a
good deal through Victoria and Hew South Wales.
3960. Who is the “ H. Pollock” who is mentioned?
—Senior instructor in agriculture for Horthern Queens
land.
3961. By the Chairman. —How did he come to
receive so much on account of travelling expenses?—
He was associated with the first exploratory test plot.?
in Queensland, which were spread over a large area,
and out of which Mareeba really crystallized. He
superintended the growth of those plots, and a tre-
mendous amount of travelling was necessary. We re-
imbursed the Queensland Government for that ex-
penditure. The travelling expenses include not only
the sums represented by the cost of transport, but also
the travelling allowance which is paid to all officers.
For example the cost of a return ticket to a place may
be only £lO, but if an officer remained there for a
month the cost would be £4O, because he would be paid
an allowance of £1 a day. The officers of the investiga-
tion are paid the Public Service rates of travelling
allowance.
3962. By Mr. Martens. —There is an amount of
£849 6s. Bd. for an Austin car. Will you give me some
particulars regarding that?—lt was purchased for the
purpose of carrying the economic survey party over the
field. It was bought second-hand for £4OO. The
balance includes the total running expenses. The car
was finally sold to the Development and Migration
Commission for £7O.
3963. Then there is another Austin car that has cost
only £496 15s. 9d?—The second car was purchased
when the first was sold. The first had reached the stage
when it was not economical to run it.
3964. What was the cost of that car? —£399, less 12-|
per cent. It is a touring car.
3965. The expense attached to that would not be very
much?— Hot a great deal,
3966. By the Chairman. —Can you tell us the area
of the experimental plot in Queensland ?—So far we
have cleared between 10 and 12 acres of ground. Only
part of that, however, is under cultivation. We have
taken over a holding of approximately 700 acres. It
should be emphasized, however, that this was donated
by the Queensland Government and we had no actual
expenses in connexion with the purchase of the land.
3967. How long has that experiment been going on?
—lt dated from the earliest operations of the Investi-
gation, at the time when the economic survey w T as being
conducted. Mr. Tregenna, I think, in association with


Mr. McGee, was sent to northern Queensland to spy
out the land and to indicate areas where exploratory
test plots might be laid down. He did so, and actually
arranged for such plots. That was the birth of the
Queensland experiment.
3968. That is the only experiment which has been
carried out on such a scale?— Yes.
3969. There is a balance of £1,400 for miscellaneous
expenses. What does that represent?— That would
coyer the cost of the material involved in experiments
in the other States.
3970. You have set down an amount of £2BO for
advertising. What is that ?—That is world advertising
in connexion with the appointment of the Director of
Investigations and the agronomists. In all of those
cases applications were invited throughout the world,
and it was an expensive process.
3971. Mr. Slagg has drawn £1,178 in travelling
expenses ? —That is for the whole period since his
appointment, the 16th January, 1928, and includes
passages for himself and family from Canada to Aus-
tralia.
3972. Can you tell us w'hether either the Common-
wealth or the States have at any time called for a
statement setting out the manner in which the money
was being expended?— Hot specifically in that way.
Drom time to time the Investigation, through the Minis-
ter, has been called upon to supply statements in reply
to questions asked in Parliament.
3973. You have had no definite requests from the
State Departments of Agriculture for particulars as to
how their money was being expended?— Ho.
3974. Have you had any difficulty in getting the
money out of the States ?—That is a matter upon which
I cannot speak intimately, because it is arranged in
the Prime Minister’s Department at Canberra. That
department makes an appropriation covering the con-
tributions of both the Commonwealth and the States,
and it is a matter between it and the States as to
when the latter’s contributions are paid.
3975. By Mr. Morgan. —l suppose that the contri-
buting States are supplied with a statement of account?
—Yes, by the Prime Minister’s Department.
3976. My Mr. Martens. —That is not your affair?—
Ho.
3977. By the Chairman. —So far as you know, no call
from any quarter has been made on you, as secretary,
for a detailed statement of the expenditure of any par-
ticular State or even of the Commonwealth ?—I have no
recollection of any such definite request.
3978. Have you furnished statements to the executive
committee similar to those that you have presented
to-day?— Yes, they receive a financial statement at
every meeting. Meetings are supposed to be held every
two months, but that may be varied if a sufficient
number of members is not in Melbourne. It is some-
times difficult to arrange a meeting.
3979. By Mr. Martens. —Do your accounts come
under the supervision of the Auditor-General?—Yes,
all accourts are audited by the Auditor-General.
3980. By Mr. Jones. —According to your financial
statement, the sum of £3,150 13s. 9d. has been spent on
the experimental plot in Queensland? —That is for
actual material, and wages of hired hands but does
not include the salaries of officers of the Investigation
or travelling expenses. We found that it was impossible
to allocate those to the States, except in the case of Mr.
Howell. The approach to the problem of improving
the industry is along Commonwealth lines, and no
cognizance is taken of States as States.
3981. Only approximately £7OO has been spent in the
other States ?—On material. Of course, you must
realize that the position of Queensland is somewhat
different from that of the other States, in that the work
involves the clearing of virgin land. We are reducing
that to a stage when tobacco can be planted.
3982. In Victoria the total amount for the term that
the statement covers is only £l49?—Yes.
3983. By the Chairman. —How did the Queensland
experiment originate?—lt originated at a meeting
between the chairman, Mr. Gepp, Dr. Darnell-Smith, as
a member of the executive committee, Mr. Tregenna,
who was then associated with the Investigation, having
been seconded from the State department, and Mr.
Hoss, ot the Hew South Wales Department of Agricul-
ture. The general lines of work 'were discussed, and
authority was given for Mr. Tregenna, accompanied by
Mr. McGee, to go to Queensland to explore and to lay
down these plots.
3984. Mr. Slagg (by leave). —We have considered the
matter from a Commonwealth stand-point rather than
from the stand-point of States, and have therefore made
no attempt to allocate our expenditure to the various
States. Actually we have expended a great deal more
time and energy in the States of Victoria and Hew
South Wales than in any of the others.
3985. By Mr. Jones. —The total amount spent on
material in Victoria over a period of two years nine
months is £l49?—Yes.
The witness withdrew.
Martin Henry Sullivan, Secretary, Dudgeon & Arnell
Proprietary Limited, Tobacco Manufacturers,
Lonsdale-street, Melbourne was called, sworn and
examined.
3986. By the Chairman. —How long has your firm
been in business?— Since 1851,
3987. Continuously?— Yes.
3988. What are its operations in regard to the pur-
chase and manufacture of Australian tobacco leaf?—
Until three or four months ago I was employed by the
firm in a secretarial capacity. It is only during the
last two months that, owing to the illness of the
manager, I have been in touch with these aspects of its
operations, and I do not feel disposed to give expert
evidence. I am not an expert, and do not know any-
thing about the matter.
3989. Can you indicate approximately the extent
of your purchases of tobacco in a year, and the policy
which you adopt towards the growers in encouraging
the growth of Australian leaf, so far as prices are con-
cerned, with a view to placing that leaf on the market ?
—To a certain extent we are governed by the prices
lLat our competitors pay; they fix the price and we have
to live up to it.
3990. Do you buy tobacco all over Australia?— Yes,
but not consistently; sometimes in Hew South Wales,
and sometimes in Queensland.
3991. The majority of your purchases are made in
Victoria ?—Yes.
3992. Do you have a buyer out every year?— Yes.
3990. Does he visit all the tobacco growing areas in
Victoria?— Ho. Our buyer has never been to Pomonal.
He has generally confined his activities to the north-
east.
3994. Can you give us an approximate idea of the
quantity of tobacco you bought last year?— Approx-
imately 70 tons, I suppose.
399e Do you have a scale of prices similar to that
of the British-Australian Tobacco Company—so much
for lemon, so much for bright mahogany, and so much
for mahogany?— Yes.
3996. What is the highest price you offer to the
growers?— Last year the highest price was 3s. 6d. a
pound.
3997. What was that for?— Lemon.
3998. What do you pay, as a rule, for bright
mahogany?—We generally go by the condition, the
appearance and the texture, and pay from 2s. to 2s 6d
per lb.


3999. Do you class mahogany as “ dark ” ?—No, that
would run from about Is. 9d. to 2s. Id. or 2s. 2d. per lb.
4000. Do you offer any bonus to the growers ?—Last
year we paid a bonus of 6d. per lb, on bright and lemon.
4001. You do not operate to any extent in the other
States? —Not a great deal.
4002. Have you ever had any difficulty in getting
supplies in Victoria ?—Not to my knowledge.
4003. Is all the tobacco manufacturered by Dudgeon
and Aruell Australian grown, or do you blend it with
imported tobacco?—We blend.
4004. Where do you import tobacco from ?—America.
Some years ago we imported from the East and from
Africa, but not recently.
4005. Do you place on the market any brands that
are 100 per cent. Australian? —Yes; “Sunday Best”
is one, and “ Belvidere ” another.
4006. Have they been on the market long? —“Sun-
day Best ” for five or six years and “ Belvidere ” under
various names ever since I can remember.
4007. Has there been a good public response to your
enterprise ?—No.
4008. Have you advertised “ Sunday Best ” ?—Ex-
tensively.
4009. What was your experience; did the sale
increase for a while and then go off? —It went up to
a peak and then dropped off again.
4010. Did you make any investigation into the
causes of that falling off?— Yes, we had an internal
investigation.
4011. What is the opinion of your company, that
the tobacco is not acceptable to the smoker?—lt is ac-
ceptable to some, but to a greater percentage it is not.
4012. What experience have you had with your
blended tobaccoes? —We have a steady demand for those.
4013. The results have been better than in the case
of the wholly Australian tobacco? —I should say so.
4014. What percentage of Australian leaf do you
put into a good selling line; it would not be a paltry
thing like 5 per cent., would it?—Oh, no; it would
have to be more than that.
4015. Have the results been more satisfactory with
that blend of tobacco than with the other? —Certainly.
4016. Have you advertised both the blended and the
Australian tobacco fairly equally?—l should say that
we have.
4017. You did not concentrate on the blended and
give the other a poor run? —No.
4018. Is your company prepared to extend its opera-
tions if more Australian tobacco comes on the mar-
ket? —I should certainly say that they would be pre-
pared to extend their operations in any way.
4019. You have never been handicapped by lack of
supply of the Australian leaf?— No.
4020. Your company has offered every inducement
to Victorian growers to grow bright leaf? —Yes.
4021. Have you found the growers to respond fairly
well?— They do their best.
4022. Can you say whether of late years your com-
pany has had less difficulty than formerly in getting
bright leaf?— There always appears to me to be a dif-
ficulty in getting bright leaf; there is always a shortage
of bright leaf.
4023. Have you extended your selling operations to
embrace the other States?—To a limited extent only.
4024. Have you ever exploited the Sydney market ?
—-To a certain extent, yes.
4025. Brisbane?'—To only a limited extent.
4026. You do not advertise your tobacco in those
places ?—Not extensively.
4027. By Mr. Jones. —Have you any arrangement
v/ith another company as to the districts which your
buyer shall visit?— None whatever.
4025. By the Chairman. —Has the company deve-
loped in the last twenty years; has it erected bigger
buildings and installed more plant? —Certainly, more
up to date plant has gone in at various times.
4029. Have you depended mainly on Australian
tobacco? —So far as I understand the position, they
have made principally Australian tobacco for years.
They used to buy huge quantities of it.
4030. Have you been selling a larger quantity of
Australian than of imported tobacco?— Within recent
years there has been more Australian than American.
4031. By Mr. Slagg. —You are aware of the assist-
ance that has been given to the Australian Tobacco
Investigation by your company, particularly by Mr.
Kennan?—Yes.
4032. By The Chairman. —Mr. Slagg this morning
brought along a sample of manufactured Australian
tobacco. Did you manufacture it according to the pro-
cesses ordinarily used by your firm, or according to some
special process?—l do not know how or by what pro-
cess it was made.
The witness withdrew.
Edward Clarence Evelyn Dyason, Chairman of Direc-
tors, G. G. Goode Limited, Tobacco Manufac-
turers, Melbourne, was called, sworn and examined.
4033. By the Chairman. —You represent the firm of
G. G, Goode Limited?—l do.
4034. In what capacity?—l am chairman of direc-
tors. The general manager left for England about
three months ago, and is now in that country.
4035. How long has your firm been in existence? —
It must be more than 50 years.
4036. In Melbourne?— Yes.
4037. What is its address?— The present address is
at the corner of Campbell and Perry-streets, Colling-
wood. Originally it was the firm of Snider and
Abrahams.
4038. Does the firm manufacture Australian tobacco
to any extent? —Not at all. We are constantly ex-
perimenting in the manufacture of cigarettes w T ith
Australian leaf, but we manufacture nothing for public
sale.
4039. Where do you get your leaf for those experi-
ments ?—Mostly from Mr. Slagg, and from people
round the Ovens district. We have so far formed the
view that, until the Australian public alters its taste
or until the Australian leaf is changed, there cannot
be a successful market for cigarette leaf. Either one
or the other must happen.
4040. Have your put any Australian tobacco on the
market?—No, we have not so far been satisfied with
the flavours.
4041. Have you subjected to any smoking tests the
cigarettes you have manufactured? —Yes, we ourselves
have tested them. The staff are constantly testing the
Australian leaf. The manager sends the travellers
round to the different retailers to offer them one and
then another cigarette, and the results are brought in
and tabulated. No regular, systematic test is made.
4042. You manufacture imported tobacco?— Vi-
rginia tobacco for cigarettes, and recently a fine cut
mixture. Most of our business is in cigarettes.
4043. Mr. Slagg has given to the committee a box
of cigarettes manufactured by your firm from Austra-
lian leaf. Has that cigarette been subjected to the
smoking test ?—Yes.
4044. What is the opinion of your firm with respect
to it?— They feel more hopeful about the Queensland
leaf than about anything else that has yet been sub-
mitted.
*4045. Have you tried New South Wales leaf?—l am
speaking of our experts. They say that it is not fair
to talk about New South Wales leaf, or Queensland


leaf, or Victorian leaf; rather must we grade it into
its particular qualities and look for those. While you
may get from any district occasional samples that are
quite satisfactory, you do not get the regular aroma,
colour, or flavour, sufficiently to run the risk of using
them. We feel very strongly that it is necessary to
have a proper re-ordering equipment before you can
hope to get leaf of a grade that the Australian people
will smoke. We are only too anxious to stimulate the
industry if we can do so.
4046, I suppose you will admit that price has a lot
to do with the public taste? —I should not think so
at all.
4047. Might not a cheap cigarette Avhich is a good
smoke, but not absolutely first class be demanded if
it were advertised?—! should not think so. I should
say that the evidence of the last few years goes to show
that the public pay for the flavour rather than for what
you might call real value. You cannot say that one
cigarette is intrinsically worse than another; it is a
question of how the human palate re-acts to it. Un-
less you change the taste there will be no demand for
it. In five years the Americans swung over the whole
nation from Virginia to a mixture of Burley and
Turkish.
4048. Was not that mainly due to a tremendous
advertising campaign and the expenditure of a large
amount of capital, with the deliberate intention of put-
ting a certain article off the market ?—So we are led
to understand.
4049. Must not cheapness be a factor in a populav
commodity like tobacco; if you make it dear, you limit
the demand for it ?—The Government doubled the price
in twenty years by taking half its retail value in tax;
and the consumption has increased.
4050. Is not the most popular cigarette in Austra-
lia the cheapest?—Oh, yes.
4051. Is not that an indication that cheapness is a
factor?— Yes; but I should not have thought that it
was a major factor.
4052. If an Australian cigarette which was a fair
smoke was put on the market and sold for 6d, a packet,
would there not be a fair demand for it?—l do not
think the leaf has been produced yet. I would not say
that we are not getting near to it; I am speaking of
what has been done in the past. I do not think that
the leaf which the Australian will smoke has yet been
produced in quantity.
4053. Do you think that a sufficiently decent quality
has been produced for blending with the imported?—
again with the exception of the last Queensland
specimen.
4054. Have you had charge of the advertising for
your firm?—To some extent I control its policy.
4055. If you advertise along right lines must you
not sell the article advertised ?—But so long as your
people tell you that the flavour is too harsh, that the
colour, on the average, is wrong—too dark for cigarettes
—and that the aroma is unpleasant, how can a firm
run the risk of an advertising campaign involving
perhaps £50,000?
4056. What people tell you that?— The manufac-
turers in our factory.
4057., They are only a few people; may not the great
mass of public form a different opinion?—We brought
a man out from England who had never heard of
this tobacco, and the moment he got here we put him
on to smoke one of these cigarettes. He immediately
said, “ It is too harsh.”
4058. By Mr. Morgan. —What is your attitude with
respect to the excise and the tariff as they affect the
tobacco industry in Australia ?—I should think it would
be insignificant. The only hope is scientific study,
either to develop the article that the public now wants,
or to spend money in so cultivating the public’s taste
that it will smoke what you now produce. I do not
think that the tariff itself can affect the position, any
more than the imposition of an excise and a tariff duty
amounting to 50 per cent, will stop the public from
smoking. Our expenditure on tobacco manufacture is
something in the neighbourhood of 70 per cent, for local
and 30 per cent, overseas.
4059. By the Chairman. —lf you could buy Austra-
lian leaf free from excise you could afford to put it on
the market at a very low price compared with the price
asked for the imported article?— Yes.
4060. And if there were anything in the contention
that price is a vital consideration to the smoker, you
would have a chance to test it out thoroughly?— Yes.
We would have a “ go ” at it to-morrow if we had the
leaf.
4061. Are you concerned about inadequacy of
supplies?—Yo; so far we have not got the right kind
of leaf. Of course I should say that richness is only
a question of conformity to an existing standard which
is not a real standard.
4062. Tou are not buying any Australian leaf?—We
buy a little. A good deal of our Turkish leaf is pur-
chased locally. Some people in the Ovens district grow
the Turkish leaf.
4063. Do you get the Turkish flavour?— Yes.
4064. Who are they?— Two Greeks at Snowy Creek,
near Harrietville.
4065. By Mr. Jones. —Does it compare favorably
with the Turkish?— Yes.
4066. Mr. J eunings has stated that you cannot trans-
fer one aroma from one country to another. That would
appear to disprove his statement?—l think that one
tremendously important thing is the regrading of
tobacco and the treatment—what happens to the tobacco
alter the farmer disposes of it and before the manufac-
turer gets it. I spent a lot of time at Richmond, Vir-
ginia, seeing what was done there.
4067. By the Chairman. —-What would you say is
a fair ageing period ?—I should say eighteen months or
two years. The Americans seem to be satisfied with
two fermentations. I think that there is a definite
bacteriological fermentation which goes on after the
first and second years.
4p68. By Mr, J ones. —lt has been stated in evidence
that the American bright leaf costs the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company approximately as much as
the Australian-grown bright leaf, and that they have
not been able to procure anything like the quantity
they are prepared to purchase. In view of that, would
you say that the abolition or reduction of the excise
on Australian-grown bright leaf would tend to stimulate
its growth in larger quantities?—! should say that
it would.
The witness withdrew.
Victor Frederick Olivier, B.Sc., Agronomist, Australian
Tobacco Investigation, was called, sworn and
examined.
4069. By the Chairman. —Have you prepared a state-
ment i— —Yes. In 1919 I started the study of tobacco
by taking a degree in science and also in agriculture
m America, with special reference to cotton and tobacco
From 1923 to 1928 I was in the employ of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture in South Africa, as tobacco and
cotton expert and research officer in charge of the
south-western districts, Eastern Province and Transkei.
During this period I obtained one year’s study leave
and took the Associateship of the Imperial College of
Tropical Agriculture, Trinidad, British West Indies,
again concentrating on cotton and tobacco; with special
reference to genetics. From 1928 until I took up my
present appointment I managed a farmers’ tobacco co-
operative society in South Africa, which handled
between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 lb. of tobacco annually.


My active association with the Australian Tobacco In-
vestigation dates from the 17th dune, 1929, the day
of my arrival in Australia. Brora that date until
towards the end of November I was engaged in grading,
reporting on and tabulating the experimental tobacco
for the 1929 season. I was further occupied with the
cutting and preparation of this leaf, as well as the leaf
from farmers, for smoking tests. Innumerable smoking
tests on Australian leaf were made by myself alone,
and in conjunction with other members of the staff.
The results of these tests were tabulated by me. Dur-
ing this period I was engaged for a few days in the
re-drying and packing of a portion of our experimental
tobacco, 1364 lb. in all, at the premises of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company in Melbourne; and in
determining the moisture content of samples before and
after re-drying. Some time in November I accompanied
the Director on a one-day trip to Pomonal, to assist in
the transplanting of tobacco. Towards the end of No-
vember I visited the Wahgunyah State Barm to take the
necessary seedlings from there for transplanting in our
experimental plots along the North Coast of New South
Wales. These seedlings, however, were not available,
but, on instructions, I continued my journey to Sydney
to visit the sites selected for our experiments along the
North Coast. By agreement with the Director, Mr. C.
J. Tregenna, the tobacco expert in New South Wales,
took me by car on this trip and in company with him
I visited Gosford, Bulladelah and Tuncurry. During
December I again visited these areas as well as Grafton
to plant out the plots. Early in January I had a nine-
days’ trip .through the tobacco areas at Gunbower, Shep-
parton, Whitfield, Myrtleford, Wangaratta, Wahgun-
yah, Tumut (New South Wales), Cann River, Orhost,
and Bairnsdale, in company with Mr. Marks. In
January I visited Gosford, Bulladelah, Tuncurry and
Grafton, and since then I have made several trips
to Gosford, one to Bulladelah and none to Tuncurry or
Grafton, as the plots at the two last-named places were
failures. Early in March I went by car from Bathurst
to Tamworth with Mr. Tregenna to visit the tobacco-
growers and areas in that district. Since then I have
visited Gosford twice to harvest the tobacco and des-
patch it to Bathurst, where the curing is done. I stayed
at Bathurst for six days, whilst the first picking was
being cured. The second picking is being cured at the
present time. The intervals between the various trips
since November have been spent at head office, making
smoking tests, whilst a few clays were spent in attempt-
ing to make blends of the tobacco from the various
States of the Commonwealth.
4070. Can yon tell the committee bow many of the
tests with which you have been associated have
survived the full period of operation?— That at
Grafton was a failure, due to unsatisfactory climatic
conditions.
4071. "Where did you have the experimental plots at
Grafton ?—On the State farm, about seven miles out.
That at Tuncurry was a failure, due to unsatisfaetory
or unsuitable soil and climatic conditions. That at
Bulladelah was a failure, due to unfavorable soil
conditions and very hot weather. At Mangrove Moun-
tain, the plot on Robinson’s place was a failure because
it was ploughed out inadvertently by one of his
employees. At the Gosford farm borne It was a failure,
due to bad soil conditions. The failure at Thompson’s
was attributable to the same cause. The plot at
Cowlishaw’s failed because of late planting. The plots
at Hutchinson’s and the Narara nursei’y were a
success. ’
4072. Have you had any association with the
Queensland tests?— Yes.
4073. Were you at Mareeba at any time?—No; I
have only tested the smoking qualities.

4074. Have you published any results of those tests?
iso. They wore tabulated, and are in our office. Some
of the results are given in Mr. Slagg's Bulletin No. 2.
4073. What is the extent of the experiments that have
been carried out at Bathurst? —We have the aroma
beds, variety tests, and tests to determine whether
tobacco is an annual, a biennial or a perennial plant.
4076. You are not yet in a position to make those
results public ?—No; except that the variety tests are
mentioned in the progress reports. I am prepared to
make a statement on the aroma tests so far as I person-
ally am concerned. Alluding particularly to Bathurst
and the theory of eucalyptus, I feel that if we put in
a more or less inert organic matter we might see
whether this bad aroma that is alleged to be due to the
application of eucalyptus is not, perhaps, due to the
incorporation of organic matter in the soil, irrespective
of where it comes from. We would expect a bad aroma
from too much nitrogen in the soil. Any one will bear
me out in saying that too much nitrogen in the soil
vail give you a ilue-cured tobacco that is not good,
'w’xch regard to the residual effects of the second year —
mat is, of the eucalyptus that was incorporated but
not added to in the second year—l personally think
that, as it was only river sand and as the conditions
were not those that we find in the field, we cannot draw
any conclusions. Besides, they are only cement beds,
and a lot of the material may be washed down and
drawn out through the sand much more readily than
would occur m die case of soils on which tobacco is
grown.
4077. Bo you consider that it would be proper for
any scientist or expert to deduce that sufficient data
had been compiled to tag definitely the eucalyptus taint
on to Australian tobacco ?—No.
4078. Bor the reason that the conditions are totally
dissimilar ? —Besides, we have not tried any other
organic matter. Why put it down purely to
eucalyptus ?
4079. I suppose if you put poison in the beds you
would get a poison tang in the tobacco?—l would not
say that.
4080. By Mr. Morgan. —Would you say that the
contrary has been proved, that eucalyptus does not
taint the tobacco ? —No, I would not say that. I have
a definite idea, but it may be controversial. I say,
advisedly, we have made many tests of Australian
tobacco, and in the majority of cases where we have
struck a dark, heavy textured tobacco I, at least, have
found an objectionable aroma. My theory about that
objectionable aroma is that the tobacco is grown on a
heavy soil that has in it too much organic matter. I
do not know enough about your conditions to make a
definite statement as to the source of that organic
matter.
4081. By the Chairman. —ls there any other state-
ment. that you wish to make? —With regard to Mr.
Dyason’s statement about growing Turkish tobacco in
the north-east of Victoria, we all know that Turkish
tobacco will retain a certain amount of its
Turkish flavour no matter where you plant it. We
■have tried out Turkish tobacco in many areas. They
grow a fairly good Turkish tobacco in South Africa
and in Rhodesia. In spite of the preference, we have
not yet persuaded the British manufacturer to utilize
that Turkish tobacco. In our own opinion it is quite
a usable tobacco. Admittedly it has a Turkish taste;
but according to expert evidence it is not up to the
standard. Several attempts were made in North Caro-
lina to grow Turkish tobacco. No doubt they get a
Turkish flavour, but it is not comparable with the best
quality Turkish tobacco you get from Greece or
Macedonia.
4082. I suppose that you are working in collabora-
tion with Mr. Slagg, with a view to publishing the


results of all tests that are being carried, out? —The
question of publication rests entirely with the
director.
4083. All the scientific work that has been carried
out under your direction in the field is being collated
with a view to publication, if desired?—No doubt if
it justifies publication it will be published. You have
heard that 90 per cent, of experimental work is nega-
tive, in so far as you do not get positive results. But
you can draw positive conclusions from negative
results.
4084. Are we to assume that all the data you collect
is being kept with a view to publication when directed
by the Director of Investigations?—No doubt that will
be done.
The witness withdrew.
George Edward Marks, assistant agronomist, Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, was called, sworn
and examined.
4085. By the Chairman. —Have you prepared a
statement? —Yes. For the past twenty-six years I
have been associated with the production of tobacco
in Australia, the first eight years of which I
was engaged continuously in growing tobacco in
the respective districts of Tumut, Manilla and
Inverell, of New South Wales. At the end of
that time I had the opportunity of visiting the tobacco
States of America, where I spent one season. On my
return to New South Wales, I again took up tobacco
culture, and added five years more ta my experience as
a grower at Griffith on the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area. At the end of this period I accepted a position
in the Department of Agriculture of Victoria as an
expert in tobacco culture and curing, after which I
joined the staff of the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion in August, 1929. My experiences as a grower and
curer have been most varied and unique. I received
my first tuition in flue-curing in 1903, under the late
Mr. A. M. Howell, tobacco expert for New South
Wales. At this time flue-cured leaf ranged in price
from Bd. to Is. 3d. per lb. according to quality and
colour, the brighter coloured commanding the higher
prices. The bulk of tobacco in that period was sun
and air dried. The latter method as applied there
was very crude, the tobacco being hung on scaffolds in
the sun for days or even weeks before being transferred
to the open sheds, which were then in general use. The
chief objective was to obtain colour without any con-
sideration for the smoking qualities of the leaf.
Tobacco in Australia should never be subjected to the
influence of sun or dry winds during the early stages
of curing, but should be placed in properly constructed,
closed, air-curing or flue-curing barns, in order to
facilitate the proper finality in ripening. This must
not be confused with maturing of the leaf in the field,
as such maturity should be completed before harvest-
ing. Growers who give careful attention to this latter
principle are producing Australia’s best tobacco, and
its contravention results in the production of such a
high percentage of inferior leaf at the present time.
Eeviewing the tobacco-growing situation in Australia
I believe there is reason for optimism. The fact that
tobacco, which is acceptable to buyers, is being pro-
duced on a commercial scale at remunerative prices to
growers, is sufficient to warrant such optimism. I
believe that more careful attention to detail in (a) the
selection of suitable soils, (&) choice of the most suit-
able varieties, (c) production of healthy plants on
adequately prepared soils at such a season as to-allow
time for full maturity in a particular district, and (d)
the application of irrigation where the rainfall is
insufficient, will greatly improve production in Aus-
tralia. Perhaps the greatest mistake is made in
attempting to grow tobacco on an area which is too
large to receive careful attention. This disadvantage
is most obvious during dry seasons when extra culti-
vation and watering are required. It must be borne in
mind that maturing is a process requiring heat and
moisture, while a dry atmosphere is advantageous
after maturity. Many growers neglect watering at
this period of maturity. This is a mistake as tobacco
ripens more evenly and better if it has been supplied
with sufficient water to maintain a continuous growth
from time of transplanting until full maturity is
reached. My past experience has shown me that New
South Wales and Victoria produce leaf with the same
general aroma throughout. The character of the
aroma is determined by each individual soil, and the
excellence or strength of the aroma is due principally
to the climate. The more nitrogenous the soil, the more
pronounced is the deleterious effect of unfavorable
climatic conditions. Even rich soils may produce fine
aromatic tobaccoes when such are grown in a tropical
climate and cured by a method suited to the particular
type. A rich soil cannot, however, ordinarily be used
for flue-curcd tobacco. While on the subject of aroma
I would like to relate some of my experiences with
fertilizers. It is a well-established fact that where
tobacco is grown on a soil -which has been supplied
with an excess of any coarse, undecayed matter,
whether it be gum leaves, straw, stable manure, &c., a
rank ill-smelling product results. The effect will be the
same whether the soil be sand or clay and I have seen
from experiments that similar results occur when an
excess of artificial fertilizers containing nitrogen are
supplied to tobacco plants. The bad influence of such
undecayed materials is largely lost as soon as decom-
position takes place. Since my engagement with the
Australian Tobacco Investigation I have been
associated with experimental work embracing manurial,
exploratory and variety test plots, and smoking tests
of the raw leaf products. The smoking tests were
carried out, first by grading, and then selecting from
each grade about four representative leaves which
previously had been sufficiently moistened for pressing,
and cutting into fine-cut tobacco from which cigarettes
were roiled. Each series of tests was represented by
about four grades, and a comparative test, the results
of which were duly recorded, was made of each of the
grades for burn and also smoking qualities, including
aroma. The lemon and bright leaf almost invariably
prove superior in aroma and burn. All of these test
samples have been re-conditioned, and packed in boxes
for the purpose of a further test after ageing, when a
more accurate valuation of smoking qualities can be
obtained. The manurial test plots near Cann-river,
East Gippsland, and also on the State Earm, Wah-
gunyah, are each yielding results which will supply a
good deal of information concerning the effects of
nitrogenous fertilizers. In the variety tests on Mr.
Fisher’s farm, near Wangaratta, the seed varieties
known as Hickory Pryor, Yellow Pryor and Conqueror
show most promise at the present time. Though the
season generally has been an adverse one and the
rainfall during the growing season has been below
normal, a good deal of valuable and interesting
information should be gathered from the results of the
various test plots.
The witness withdrew.
Temple Alsop Jennings Smith, Tobacco Expert, De-
partment of Agriculture, Victoria, was recalled
and further examined.
4086. By the Chairman. —You have a statement re-
lating to percentages of Australian leaf used in local
manufacture?— Yes. Notwithstanding the fact that
the quality of Australian leaf has been improved by

the use of better varieties, flue-curing, and methods of
handling, the percentage of Australian leaf used has
gradually become less. So far as I can ascertain, the
figures show that, in years, the percentages were: —
per cent.
This may be due to the increased demand for light
tobaccoes by the smoking public, but I feel sure that
our smokers can be induced to smoke more of the dark
leaf if desired. As, for instance, many brands of
cigarettes made and sold in United States of America
are a darker colour than those in use in Australia.
It appears strange that some manufacturers can make
a usable tobacco of 100 per cent. Australian leaf, that
growers can make and smoke their own leaf, imper-
fectly manufactured; and that larger percentages can-
not be used by skilled manufacturers. Before the
excise duty was imposed, several local brands of Aus-
tralian tobacco were made in the north-east by Henley,
Chad and Barker from air-cured leaf which was in-
ferior to that now produced. The advent of the excise
duty, however, made it impossible for these men to
continue, as it meant the maintenance of a locker, and
high licence fee. One manufacturer has said that he
uses Australian leaf to blend with American to im-
prove the burn and smoking qualities. The British-
Australasian Tobacco Company has recently reduced
the quantity of dark leaf that it will purchase, notwith-
standing the fact that, prior to 1928, the prices paid
for dark leaf made this class of tobacco a better paying
crop to grow than the bright tobacco. For instance,
crops of dark leaf yield from 1,000 lb. to 1,500 lb.
per acre, which, at Is. 6d. per lb., gave a return of
from £75 to £ll2 10s. per acre. Bright leaf of lemon
and bright mahogany yield from 600 lb. to 700 lb.
at an average price of 2s. 6d. per lb. viz., £62 10s. per
acre to £B7 10s. In the year 1927 Chaffey Bros., of
Tam worth, sold to the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company 15 tons off 15 acres at an average price of
2s. per lb., which returned £250 per acre. The whole
crop averaged 25 cwt. per acre and a portion yielded
£2BO per acre. This sale was made soon after the
company had complained that Australian leaf was
grown on wrong soils, this soil being a rich black, not
considered a suitable soil to produce good quality leaf.
The effect of such a sale would materially induce other
growers to endeavour to grow tobacco on similar soils.
As showing the possibilities in the future, if Australia
can supply her own tobacco and establish an export
trade, some United States of America figures are
interesting. In that country there are 42 States pro-
ducing tobacco on 448,572 farms. During the five-year
period—l9l7 to 1921 —the average area under tobacco
was 1,702,000 acres. The average production was
1,362,000,000 lb., the average value being £72,925,000.

{Taken at Brisbane.)
THURSDAY, 24th APRIL, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. W. W. R. Swinson, representing the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary
Limited; and Mr, C. M. Slagg, representing the
Australian Tobacco Investigation.)
Harold Cecil Quodling, Director of Agriculture,
Queensland, was called, sworn and examined.
4087. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position?— Since 1915,
4088. During that period have you had charge of
tobacco investigation work in Queensland? —Yes, so far
as that applies to more recent tobacco developmental
work, when I have been working in conjunction with
the Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee.
4089. Did you establish a department to control the
tobacco industry in Queensland? —Ho. We do not
possess an expert at present. It is fifteen years since
we had one.
4090. Why were his services discontinued?—He left
to go to Georgia, U.S.A., He was the late Mr. R. S.
Nevill, who was imported by the Queensland Govern-
ment. After serving a term in this State he returned
to Georgia, I believe under a promise given to his
relatives.
4091. Was he the only tobacco expert employed by
the Queensland Government?—l believe so.
4092. Why did not the Government fill his place?—
Because at that time the industry was declining and
there was no immediate call for the services of a
tobacco expert. Mr. Slagg has submitted to me a
few samples of tobacco produced at Mareeba, which I
hand to the committee for examination and test. I
believe that they will disprove certain disparaging state-
ments regarding Queensland tobacco. They comprise
two tins of flue-cured cigarette blend, two tins of flue-
cured fine cut smoking tobacco, and two tins of flake cut
smoking tobacco. It is only within the last three years,
following the formation of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation Committee and the carrying out of its
programme, that any appreciable move has been mani-
fest in the resuscitation of the tobacco-growing industry
in Queensland. Some twenty years ago 1,000 tons of
tobacco leaf was produced, principally in the Texas and
Inglewood districts. Owing to a number of reasons the
industry has declined almost to vanishing point, not-
withstanding a determined effort which was made to

keep it going by the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany and several individuals interested in tobacco pro-
duction. The position to-day is far more encouraging.
Although the initial experiment work carried out since
1927 in the north suffered certain handicaps, due to
difficulties in supervision, harvesting and transport, and
to the effect of two excessively wet seasons, the
published reports of the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion Committee have been generally of a satisfactory
nature. It indicated that northern grown flue-cured
leaf was of good marketable colour and aroma and w r as
also of good smoking quality. In my opinion there is
a bright future for the tobacco-growing industry in
Queensland provided that growers are educated up to
its requirements, aud that men with experience of both
growing and curing are encouraged to settle in proved
localities. Much requires to be done in the way of
experiment work with a view to testing the crop in
different districts, in many of which the soil and
climatic conditions appear to be very favorable to pro-
duction. Where it is found that tobacco of good
marketable quality can be produced, it follows that the
commercial possibilities of the crop would require to be
tested as a preliminary to the permanent establishment
of the industry on the more modern and scientific basis.
I have the authority of the Minister for Agriculture, the
Hon. H. F. Walker, to State that he is agreeable to a
renewal of the existing agreement between the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, the Commonwealth and
the individual States to carry on experimental work for
a second term of five years. Since the commencement
in Queensland of tobacco experiment work under the
direction of the Australian Tobacco Investigation
Committee, this State has contributed its share of the
expense connected therewith at the rate of £333 6s. Bd.
per annum, as provided for under the agreement entered
into between the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany Limited and the Commonwealth and various State
Governments. A sum of £666 13s. 4d. has been paid to
date, which covers our contribution towards the 1927-28
and 1928-29 activities. The 1927-28 experiments con-
sisted of 27 small exploratory test plots situated at
various centres in North Queensland and known as the
Mareeba, Townsville and Mackay series. The 1928-29
season’s experiments were confined to work carried out
at the Mareeba Tobacco Experiment Farm. In this
latter season, the department also rendered assistance in
the form of instruction to the Townsville and Charters
Towers Chambers of Commerce in connexion with
tobacco growing and curing experiments carried out at
Hervey’s Range, Pentland and Charters Towers. The
expenditure incurred in this connexion is not included
in the contributions under the agreement, but as a
record of same has not been kept separate from the
expenditure on general experiment and instructional
work for the Northern Division of the State, it is
regretted that details are not available. Queensland’s
contribution towards the current season’s experiments,
when the operations for the first three-year period will
have been concluded, will embrace work performed at
the Mareeba Experiment Farm and also on fifteen
Central Queensland exploratory plots situated at centres
between Sarin a and Bundaberg. Since the year 1920
and prior to the advent of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation Committee in 1927, the department
carried out a number of experimental trials in North
Queensland with seed imported from the United States
of America. Stocks of imported seed were also kept at
this office for distribution to growers at cost price. It is
regretted that expenditure in this connexion is not
available. I tender, for the information of the com-
mittee, photographs which I took as recently as March
last, showing tobacco plots produced under Government
supervision at Woodstock, in the locality of Townsville,
North Queensland. The soil is alluvial and granitic in
origin.
4093. Was the 1,000 tons of tobacco to which you
refer grown in the Texas district in one year?— Yes;
and it would be practically all air-dried leaf.
4094. Was any attempt made in those years to ex-
plore the possibilities of tobacco-growing in Queens-
land?— Yes; Mr. USTevill travelled extensively through-
out Queensland and endeavoured to stimulate tobacco-
growiflg in the districts that he considered to be suit-
able for the purpose. He paid particular attention to
the production of cigar leaf in Yorth Queensland.
Later, our Mr. Pollock carried out a number of experi-
ments in the production of cigar leaf in that area which
were more or less successful. He did not give much
attention to pipe tobacco.
4095. At what places were those experiments carried
out?—ln the Bowen, Proserpine, and Cardwell dis-
tricts.
4096. Why did the Queensland Government practi-
cally go out of the production of tobacco for such a long
period?—-Chiefly because of the decadence of the in-
dustry.
4097. What were the general conditions that brought
about that decadence? —It is somewhat difficult to
answer that question from a departmental point of
view. Beyond making recommendations it was not
within my province to arrange for the appointment of
tobacco experts. I have made recommendations during
the last seven years that a tobacco expert should be
attached to the staff of my department.
4098. Did you recommend the appointment of a
whole-time officer?— Yes.
4099. On what did you base your recommendation?
—On the opinion that the prospects of the industry
were improving, and partly on the experimental work
that has been carried out during the last few years.
4100. Seven years ago practically no tobacco was
grown in Queensland, yet you form the opinion that
the position of the industry justifies much greater
efforts on the part of the Queensland Government?—l
have always held the opinion that Australia should
grow 7 its own tobacco.
4101. Are you a smoker ?—Yes.
4102. Were you aware seven years ago that the
general opinion was that Australian tobacco was of an
inferior smoking quality?—l believe that that opinion
has changed since flue curing and more scientific
methods have been used. I am confident that if the
soil and the locality are satisfactory we can produce a
flue-cured tobacco which will be satisfactory to the
Australian palate. Hitherto, the tobacco produced in
Queensland has been far too heavy.
4103. Have you ever visited Texas and examined the
country on which tobacco is grown there?— Yes.
4104. Are you aware that a good deal of that country
is light sandy soil ?—Generally speaking, the soil in
that district is fairly fertile.
4105. Do you consider that the Texas district had a
fair try-out in bygone years ?—I should not be prepared
to say that, but the growers did the best that they could
with the knowledge at their disposal.
4106. Have you heard about the stemmery estab-
lished by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
in that district?— Yes.
4107. Have you investigated its failure?— Ho.
4108. Did you form any opinion upon the subject?—
No. I thought that the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company had thoroughly investigated the matter, with
the assistance of experts; men who knew more than I
on the subject.
4109. We had evidence from a Mr. Jennings to the
effect that unsuitable labour was imported, mainly men
from British cities who were not agriculturists; also
that typhoid and, later, blue mould had helped to bring


about the failure. Are you in a position to comment
on that?— No. I am confident that the soil in the
Texas district is particularly suitable for the produc-
tion of White Burley.
4110. Are you aware that the Texas growers are
again coming into the industry, and are using flue
curing?— Yes.
4111. Do you know anything about the proposal +o
sub-divide the Gunyan Estate, principally for the cul-
tivation of tobacco, provided that the future of the
industry is assured? —Not departmentally. I under-
stand that the company concerned had some intention
to sub-divide the estate and encourage not only tobacco-
growing, but mixed farming.
4112. The management informed the committee that
the principal object was to encourage tobacco cultiva-
tion. If that were brought about, would it be a great
advantage to Queensland? —Yes, undoubtedly.
4113. I take it that the Queensland Department of
Agriculture has not taken a very serious part in the
extension of the industry?— That is so.
4114. Apart from the actual contribution towards
the establishment of the Australian Tobacco Investiga-
tion Committee did the Queensland Government take
an active part in the revival of the industry?—We have
at all times been ready to co-operate with that com-
mittee.
4115. I want to ascertain whether the Australian
Tobacco Investigation Committee was the body re-
sponsible for the revival of the tobacco industry in this
State ?—lmmediately prior to the establishment of that
committee, I had a visit from Mr. Tregenna, who was
then New South Wales tobacco expert, and a Mr.
McGee. They discussed the problem with me. Fol-
lowing that visit and the establishment of a number of
exploratory plots in North Queensland, my department
co-operated with the Australian Tobacco Investigations
Committee in its experiments. My department wel-
comed the establishment of that committee and would
welcome its continuance. It has received very helpful
advice from the committee.
4116. Dr. Cameron, the Director of Agriculture in
Victoria, was not altogether favorable to the continua-
tion of the committee. What have you to say about
that? —I believe that if we had a qualified tobacco
expert in Queensland this State would gain by having
the investigation work still carried on by the committee,
particularly if the State voted additional money en-
tirely for investigation work in Queensland.
4117. Would you go so far as to say that if the
Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee had not
begun to function three years ago it is extremely prob-
able that the Queensland Department of Agriculture
would not have taken any greater interest in tobacco
cultivation than it had done for the previous seven
to ten years?— Mr. Pollock has interested him-
self in tobacco work for seven years; first of
all with cigar leaf, and latterly in connexion
with the production of pipe and cigarette leaf.
I am confident that his activities would have
been carried on irrespective of the establishment
of the investigation committee. My department was
particularly anxious to promote tobacco-growing in
North Queensland, as there is a great deal of unex-
ploited country there suitable for the purpose, and of
little use for anything else.
4118. What action had your department taken before
the Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee
began its operations?— There was a revival of interest
in tobacco-growing immediately prior to the establish-
ment of that committee.
4119. Do you consider that its establishment invested
the Queensland Government with a new interest in the
matter, and caused your department to determine that
it was worth while to revive the industry on a compre-
hensive scale?—Yes. When the committee was formed
it gave my department a fresh perspective with regard
to the industry, and indicated its possibilities if carried
on on a scientific basis. I should regret the discon-
tinuance of the Investigation Committee, unless some
other provision were mads to carry on the work.
4120. The figures show that the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company has contributed practically two-
thirds of the cost of that committee so far. If the
committee decided to withdraw and leave the Austra-
lian Tobacco Investigations Committee in the air,
would the Queensland Government attach sufficient
importance to the work to increase its contribution? —
That is entirely a matter for the Minister. I should
be quite prepared to recommend an expenditure of a
sum of money adequate to carry out experimental and
developmental work in Queensland.
4121. In conjunction with the Eederal Government?
—Yes.
4122. And irrespective of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company?—No; I should like their co-opera-
tion.
4123. What if they declined their assistance after the
three years had expired ?—Correspondence in my office
indicates definitely that the company is prepared to
carry on.
4124. Dr. Cameron of Victoria is opposed to the con-
tinuation of the committee, and contends that the work
should be handed back to the States. If the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company decided to discontinue
its activities in the matter, would you then recommend
that the Commonwealth Government should continue
the work on the basis of additional expenditure being
made available by the States? —Yes; but I should
regret the withdrawal of the British-Australasian To-
bacco Company.
4125. Is not the position in Queensland that Mareeba
is the beginning and end of the tobacco industry in this
State?—-It is certainly not the end of it. Mr. Pollock
will be able to give the committee a different impression
on that point. I tender two reports by Mr. Pollock,
who is senior instructor in agriculture for North
Queensland. They are dated 7th January, 1927, and
7th October, 1929.
412 G. Can you tell the committee how Mareeba "was
located as the centre for tobacco experiments?—Mr,
Pollock, accompanied by Messrs. Tregenna and McGee,
made a wide survey of North Queensland, and Mareeba
was one of the places that they located as suitable for
tobacco-growing. Since then Mr. C. M. Slagg, when
visiting North Queensland, was struck with the pos-
sibilities of Mareeba. He showed a practical interest
by making a request that the Queensland Government
should set aside 1,000 acres in order that experimental
work might be carried on over picked portions of that
area. That land was allocated hy the Queensland Go-
vernment as a reserve for the purpose. It is vested
in my department.
4127. Has not the Government virtually handed it
over to the Australian Tobacco Investigations Commit-
tee for experimental -work?— Yes. Our officers co-
operate in the activities.
4128. If Mr, Slagg decided that the operations should
take a certain course at Mareeba, would your officers
have the power to override him? —Mr. Slagg is given
a free hand.
4129. Has your department evolved any policy as to
the future of that 1,000 acres? —So far as my depart-
ment is concerned the experiments can be carried on
indefinitely.
4130, Have you any idea of sub-dividing it?— No.
It would be possible to extend that acreage to other dis-
tricts if necessary.
4131. What was the value of that land when it was
set aside for tobacco-growing?— Presumably, about 10s.
an acre.


4132. Is there any railway communication with it ?
The central farm is about 4 miles by road from the
railway at Mareeba, and about 2 miles as the crow
flies.
4133. I presume that the only expenditure by the
State Government on the tobacco experimental plots
at Mareeba during the last two years is £666?— That is
all that is accounted for departmentally, but it has cost
the Tobacco Investigation Committee more money than
that to develop the property.
4134. Has the State given the authority for the
committee to develop that property?— The committee
can go ahead and effect any improvements necessary
in connexion with drainage to the land, irrigation,
fencing, buildings, and other work that is found neces-
sary for the experiments.
4135. Supposing that the value of the property was
greatly enhanced by this Federal expenditure, would
that revert to the State after the investigations were
discontinued? —I should not be prepared to express an
opinion on that.
4136. There would not be any refund to the Federal
Government? —I know of no arrangements existing for
that purpose.
4137. So that the Federal Government, which is
expending a lot of money at Mareeba, has no means of
securing any enhanced-value accruing from its experi-
ments? —I take it that that is a Commonwealth
matter.
4138. But the Commonwealth has no hold on the
State so far as a refund is concerned?—l do not think
that that side of the matter has been considered.
4139. What was the value of land adjoining that
1,000 acres at the time that the scheme was launched?
■ —Mr. Howell will be able to speak more definitely on
that point. Generally speaking, land adjoining
Mareeba is very low in value. I take it that it would
be worth approximately 10s. an acre. The land is of
poor grazing capacity, and not considered of any value
for the growth of crops. The position has entirely
changed since the tobacco experiments have taken place.
4140. Can you tell the committee whether any
individuals have taken up land since the investigations
began?—l understand that land has been purchased
there, hut I have no particulars.
4141. Could the committee obtain those particulars?
Yes, probably through the Titles Office.
4142. So far as you know, had any attempt been
made to develop the land surrounding Mareeba prior
to the tobacco investigations ?—lt was principally unim-
proved country; mineral reserve leases.
4143. Has the Department of Agriculture found any
other use for Mareeba lands apart from tobacco-grow-
ing?— Mr. Pollock could speak more definitely on that
point.
4144. Has your department taken steps to keep track
of any outside interests that may be waiting to see how 7
Mareeba will develop ?—I cannot say that it has.
4145. Have you heard about the Commonwealth
Tobacco Company Limited?— Yes.
4146. Has your department made any inquiries as to
the extent of that company’s operations at Mareeba? —
Hot from head office. Mr. Pollock may be able to
enlighten the committee on that point. Mr. Pollock
reported on the operations of the Pacific Tobacco
Industries Limited.
4147. Has your department made any similar experi-
ments outside of Mareeba?—Ho other separate depot
has been established, but a number of exploratory plots
have been established under the supervision of the
Australian Tobacco Investigations Committee in the
Rockhampton district.
4148. Would they be principally on private holdings?
—Yes, because it is necessary to have somebody to take
care of them. The matter of utilizing Crown lands
for developmental work has been under investigation
by my department, and soil surveys have been made in
two or three instances. Mr, Brooks is in charge of
operations in the Mackay district, and some years ago
he located several promising areas there.
4149. Do yon know of any other attempt to estab-
lish a company for the development of tobacco culture,
with the exception of that in the.Mareeba area? —Ho,
except experiments made by the Townsville Chamber
of Commerce last year. That was not a commercial
undertaking.
4150. Does it not appear to you that the prospects
of the Commonwealth Tobacco Company Limited are
based entirely on the results of the experimental work
carried out at Mareeba? —That appears to he so. I
have no knowledge of private experimental work having
been undertaken in that district.
4151. By Mr. Martens. —If the Investigations Com-
mittee went out of existence would your department
then be in a position to continue its experimental work ?
—I think that the Queensland Minister for Agriculture
would do all that he could to carry those experiments
to finality.
4152. On the present basis?— Possibly on an ex-
tended scale.
4153. Would that mean a re-organization?—lt would
mean an extension of the staff of the department to
include a tobacco expert, and possibly an assistant.
Everything would depend on the scope of the opera-
tions.
4154. To what extent did the State carry on experi-
mental work prior to the establishment of the Investi-
gations Committee?—lt was concerned principally
with producing cigar leaf at Bowen. Specially im-
ported seed was used for the purpose, and the work
was carried on under Mr. Pollock’s supervision. His
report outlines the activities.
4155. I assume that it is not an easy matter to
obtain tobacco experts?—l do not think that it is.
4156. Ho matter how desirous the Queensland
Government was of carrying on this investigation work,
would it not be difficult for it to obtain a qualified
officer to continue the operations if the Commonwealth
Government withdrew in the matter? —Yes, although
our own officers are acquiring a knowledge of many
sections of the business.
4157. They have not yet had sufficient experience?
That is so; but they are trained agriculturists.
4158. Dr. Cameron stated that Victoria could carry
on satisfactorily without the Investigations Com-
mittee. That "would not be the case with Queensland?
—At this juncture we should, to some extent, be like
a ship without a rudder.
4159. By Mr. Morgan. —Are you quite satisfied with
conditions as they are, and desire them to continue?—
The existing arrangement is quite satisfactory to my
department. Queensland is looking forward to the
development of the tobacco-growing industry, and with
the information that it now possesses it has every hope
that development will occur in future. If it does the
tobacco industry will be a very valuable one to Queens-
land and to the Commonwealth.
4160. By Mr. Jones. —Do you consider that the
prospects of Mareeba are favorable?— Yes; decidedly
so this year.
4161. Is the committee to understand that prac-
tically all the land in the vicinity of Mareeba is Crown
land?— There is a large extent of Crown land in the
vicinity of the 1,000-acre experimental plot.
4162. Is it similar to the 1,000-acre area?— Mr.
Howell could speak more definitely on that point. I
understand that there is an area of from 80,000 to
100,000 acres in that district capable of producing good
tobacco.


4163. Within what radius of Mareeba? —Mr. Pollock
investigated that matter and submitted maps to the
office showing the areas. It would he approximately
within a radius of 30 miles of Mareeba.
4164. Would that 100,000 acres he Crown lands? —
The major portion of it.
4165. Is the land which will grow good tobacco worth
10s. per acre? —I question whether that value would
apply in every case. There is a good deal of rough un-
available land in the area, but the greater amount of the
land which would grow good tobacco is worth 10s. an
acre unimproved.
4166. How much would it cost to clear the land? —
From £6 to 7an acre. It is not very heavily timbered.
4167. By the Chairman. —Is that what it cost to clear
the Mareeba experimental plot?—I have not the figures
available, but I take it that with a modern power plant
the cost of clearing would not exceed £6 to £7 an acre.
4168. By Mr. Morgan. —It was stated in evidence in
Victoria that it took from £ll to £l2 an acre to clear
heavily-timbered bracken fern country ? —The timber
is not big in the Mareeba district. In the wet season
it can easily be pulled down with a good forest devil.
4169. By the Chairman. —Is there a Queensland
tobacco-growers’ organization?— Hot to my knowledge.
4170. Have you any statistics concerning the tobacco-
growing industry in Queensland? —Mr. R. B. Curd,
Collector of Customs, Brisbane, has supplied the
following information :
1928. —Registered growers of tobacco numbered 54, but only
12 of these grew tobacco during the year. Area under tobacco,
IG4 acres. Quantity of tobacco leaf cured, 127,240 lb.
1929. —Registered growers of tobacco numbered 48, only 9
of these grew tobacco during the year. Area under tobacco,
158 acres. Quantity of tobacco leaf cured, 192,794 lb. The
1929 figures are not quite complete.
The witness withdrew.
Herman Arthur Robert Pollock, Senior Instructor,
Department of Agriculture, Horthern Division,
Queensland, was called, sworn and examined.
4171. By the Chairman. —Are you senior instructor
for the State or only for the northern division of the
State? —I am senior instructor for the State, with head-
quarters at Townsville.
4172. How long have you held that position? —For
eleven years.
4173. Have you had control of the tobacco super-
vision work of the Department of Agriculture? —Yes,
in the north of Queensland, except that section con-
trolled by the Australian Tobacco Investigation Com-
mittee. I have co-operated with that committee.
4174. Have you had control of the tobacco super-
vision work throughout Queensland? —Ho. My work
has been confined to the northern division.
4175. What is your southern boundary?—l do not
go further south than Proserpine.
4176. Would that be the usual State administrative
division?— Yes, except that portion from St. Lawrence
to Proserpine. The State divisional boundary for the
north division is a line parallel latitude with St.
Lawrence, but not including St. Lawrence. When rail-
way communication was established between Rockhamp-
ton and Mackay the portion of the coast served by that
railway was attached to the central division, as it was
then more easily worked.
4177. How long have you been in charge of tobacco
Investigation work in Horth Queensland? —Since my
appointment in 1919.
4178. What steps did you take to explore the possi-
bilities of tobacco cultivation in that area? —My atten-
tion was solely directed to the production of cigar leaf
until the visit of Mr, McGee and Mr. Tregenna in
1937.
4179. What was the idea of concentrating on cigar
leaf ? Did you not know that the public taste for
cigars was declining?— Yes, that was patent, hut the
position of the tobacco industry of Australia was not
really understood.
4180, Had you any previous practical knowledge of
tobacco cultivation in Australia or elsewhere? —Ho.
4181. When you took up your work in Horth Queens-
land did you do so as tobacco expert or as an agricul-
tural expert?—As an agricultural instructor.
4182. Had you any experience of tobacco to guide
you other than cigar leaf?— Hot until 1927.
4183. —Who were the officers who then assisted you?
—Mr, McGee, who was imported by the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company, and Mr. Tregenna, who
was one of the officers on the first committee appointed
by the Australian Tobacco Investigation to under-
take the survey work. I met those gentlemen in Bris-
bane and we discussed the qualities of soils obtaining in
Horth Queensland. They accompanied me to the north
and together we visited localities between Mareeba and
Chillagoe, Dimbulah, Petford, Alma Den, Carbeen,
Herbertou, Tumoulin, Innot Springs, Mt. Garnet and
Silver Valley. We then returned through other
districts, not suitable for tobacco, to Townsville, and
visited Houghton Valley, Ravenswood Junction, .
Selheim, and Charters Towers.
4184. What was the procedure?—We examined the
country en route , travelling by train, rail motor, and
motor car.
4185. Did your companions suggest any particular
areas, or did they leave it entirely to you to take them
to country that might fulfil their purpose?— They had
no knowledge of the Horth, and depended on my
guidance. We discussed the subject, and plots were
suggested by them at Mareeba and Tumoulin. The
precise location of other plots was left entirely
to me. Although there is only a very small
area of suitable land at Tumoulin, Mr. McGee
considered it worthy of a trial. It was
decided to have 30 plots in all, to be subsidized to the
extent of £5 per plot. The person supervising the plot
was to have 100 plants, and grow the tobacco under
my instructions.
4186. Did those gentlemen then go away and leave
the fate of the experiments in your hands?— Yes. I
reported to my department, which in turn passed the
report on to the investigations committee. I took
control only of those plots which were planted out. Mr.
Howell, of the Tobacco Investigation Committee after-
wards arrived, and he and I went around the plots. He
then undertook the responsibility to flue-cure the leaf.
4187. So that Mr. Howell was really in charge of
the cultivation work?— Most of that work had been
done under my supervision prior to his arrival.
4188. Did those gentlemen give you any instructions
in the art of tobacco cultivation before they departed?
—We discussed the matter, and they suggested that my
experience was quite sufficient.
4189. Although you had not had any personal
experience previously of growing tobacco?—l had the
experience over the previous seven or eight years with
the growers of cigar leaf.
4190. You had no experience of Texas?— Ho.
4191. Did you market any of that cigar leaf?—lt
was marketed, but we did not get the returns.
4192. Would nobody buy it?— Yes, it was all sold.
4193. Who bought it?— All the leaf grown by the
northern cigar-leaf growers could be sold only through
one channel, R. Helson & Company, brokers, Mel-
bourne. Attempts made to sell the leaf outside of that
broker met with failure.
4194. Were attempts made to sell to the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company?— Ho. Leaf was sent down
by a Bowen grower, Robert Johnson, who was dissatis-
fied with the price received from Helson, to the State


Produce Agency, Brisbane. That agency held the
tobacco for two or three months and then decided that
it could not sell it, recommending that Johnson should
get into communication with Robert Nelson & Com-
pany. He then sent his tobacco to the Coastal Farmers
Co-operative Association, Sydney. They held it for
from two to three months and returned him the same
reply, referring him to Robert Nelson.
4195. Was no direct approach made to the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company?— The British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company were not manufacturers of
cigar leaf. That is undertaken by the States Tobacco
Company, Limited.
4196. The whole organization is the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company?— That organization may
have been approached by the State Produce Agency or
the Coastal Farmers Co-operative Association.
4197. Are you in a position to assume that the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company was ap-
proached?— No. No doubt the States Tobacco Com-
pany would have been approached by the brokers—
but that is merely an assumption.
4198. Were you quite satisfied that every manu-
facturer had been approached by the brokers, and that
they had been unable to induce the manufacturers to
accept the Queensland leaf? —The position of the cigar
industry was set out in my report to the department
in 1926, I dealt there with the factors which brought
about the decline in the demand for cigar leaf.
4199. If you thought the States Tobacco Company
had not been approached, I presume that you would
have concluded that the growers- had not had a fair
deal at the hands of the brokers ?—The matter of mar-
keting did not come within my purview.
4200. I suppose that you came into contact with
the growers and discussed the subject with them? —
Yes, and their views are embodied in my report.
4201. They were so disgusted with the position that
they went out of growing cigar leaf? —In 1920 or
thereabouts an additional duty was imposed on cigar
leaf amounting to 6d. per lb. The manufacturers had
gathered that this duty would be imposed, and they
imported two years supply before it became operative.
As a result Queensland leaf, which had previously sold
readily, could then be sold only at a very low price.
Leaf that had been bringing 2s. 6d. and 2s. per lb.
slumped to 9d. and 6d. per lb., which was no good
to the growers. No further cigar leaf was grown in
North Queensland until 1922-3. In 1924 some growers
received letters from Robert Nelson & Company Limited,
inquiring about cigar leaf. It was therein suggested to
them that there would be a market for their leaf.
Those who grew 7 it obtained a satisfactory price for
the leaf that year. • Additional growers put crops under
cultivation in 1925. I remind the committee that cigar
leaf is air cured and can be stripped and packed only
when there is sufficient atmospheric humidity to allow
that to be done. The Bow 7 en district has a very low
rainfall from July until December. A quantity of
leaf was packed and sent to market in August, 1925.
It realized a satisfactory price—up to 2s. 9d. a lb. The
balance of the leaf w 7 as marketed in February and
March, 1926. It was the same as that marketed in
August, 1925, but it brought only half the price. Each
grower received a letter couched in practically iden-
tical terms condemning the leaf and urging him not
to grow any more of it. The reasons given w 7 ere that
it was too coarse, too strong and, generally, that it
was unsatisfactory.
4202. Did you form any opinion as to the value of
that condemnation?—l agreed with it.
4203. Do you think that the growers were taking
any steps to improve their methods of cultivation and
curing?— No. Unfortunately they would not take any
advice with regard to the improvement of their leaf.
The Department secured seed of 42 varieties of
tobacco, some 38 of Avhich came from Uruguay. Others
came from the Philippines, and some from New
Guinea. I endeavoured to induce tobacco growers to
experiment with half a dozen varieties each. It was
a difficult task. Generally, they would not try any
of the varieties. One farmer, C. L. Jones, of Uri Creek,
experimented very successfully with samples of seed of
six varieties. He kept each variety separate when
packing, and submitted the leaf to Nelson for sale with
a request that a report should be given as to the suit-
ability of the different varieties. The only report
that he received was 2s. 6d. a lb. for the whole of
the leaf, and a simple, intimation that the Brazil
variety was the best. Naturally the grower w r as
annoyed. He wanted to know 7 what was the use of
his growing Brazil, which gave a light yield of 500 lb.
to the acre, when he could get the same price for
Zimmer Spanish, wliich cropped 1,200 lb. to the acre.
Other growers reached a similar conclusion. In my
report of the 7th January, 1927, I gave the prices
received for tobacco marketed by different growers
from 1913 to 1926. Those figures are taken from the
actual account sales.
4204. So that growing cigar leaf in North Queens-
land finally became unprofitable and was abandoned?
—That is so.
4205. Are there any growers in the North at the
present time growing pipe and cigarette leaf?— Yes.
There is an area at Hervey’s Range, some 30 miles
due w T est of Townsville, and a small area at Pentland.
An area was also planted near Bowen with bright
tobacco, pipe and cigarette leaf, which is under the
supervision of my department. Then there is the air-
cured type, White Burley, with which we are ex-
perimenting at Woodstock, some 30 miles from Towns-
ville. Some of those plants form the subject of the
photographs which have been submitted to the com-
mittee. In the Bowen district there are three areas on
which White Burley is grown, the growers being James
Pott, Harry Teitzell and A. Albiez. From recent corre-
spondence received by me, I ga-ther that quite a number
of Italians have been induced by the salesmen of the
Pacific Tobacco Industries Limited to grow 7 tobacco
on entirely unsuitable sod near Ingham and Mourilyan.
I nave not been able to get in touch with all of these
people, but when I return I expect to receive a list
of their names. I shall then visit all of them. I
visited one Italian at Trebonne, near Ingham, who pro-
posed to plant fifteen acres of tobacco on unsuitable
country. I warned him and others not to attempt to
grow tobacco unless the soil was first approved.
4206. Could you give the committee an idea as to
the number of tobacco growers in the whole of Queens-
land ?—No. There are not any growers in this State
on a large scale. The largest area under tobacco, out-
side the experimental plots at Mareeba, is 5 to 6 acres at
Hervey’s Ptange. All the other plots are under an
acre.
4207. Do you think that there is any danger of a
large number of people, particularly in North Queens-
land, rushing into the cultivation' of tobacco on un-
suitable soils at the present time?—lt appears that a
lot of Italians are doing so, due to misleading state-
ments having been made by salesmen of shares in the
Pacific Tobacco Industries. That matter w 7 as the sub-
ject of correspondence to the Minister for Agriculture
in this State. I sent him particulars. Those men
have been misled into growing tobacco and have been
induced to take shares.
4208. I understand that the object of the Pacific
Tobacco Industries Limited is to grow tobacco in
New Zealand?— According to the prospectus that is
its definite object.


4209. Do you think that these Italians have been
given to understand that the tobacco that they grow
in Queensland will he purchased by the company?—
Yes, although the agreement states that the tobacco
will he sold for them for the best price obtainable.
4210. But the company does not undertake to manu-
facture the tobacco in Australia? —It does not under-
take to purchase at all. Apparently it does not under-
take to do anything in connexion with the tobacco
grown in North Queensland. It would appear that
the Citizen Brokers Limited, the m m disposing of the
shares, will dispose of the tobacco at the best price
obtainable. The catch is that the company will enter
into the agreement with the farmer only if he will
take shares in the Pacific Tobacco Industries Limited.
4211. In the loose sheet accompanying the prospectus
of the company it is stated that, “ The company will
grow and manufacture in Australia on the same lines
that has put the tobacco industry in New Zealand in
the forefront of the world’s tobacco producers.” It
also states that, “ Fiancial assistance and expert advice
will be available to growers throughout Australia and
worked in conjunction with the company’s own planta-
tions in New Zealand and Australia.” Has your de-
partment taken any steps to warn the public against
the propoganda of that company, which is open to the
most serious criticism?—l have submitted particulars
of the concern to my Minister. I am not sure what
action he has taken.
4212. When did .you submit particulars?— Origi-
nally, on the 27th January last. Later, I collected data,
which I submitted to him towards the end of March.
I sent him a copy of the tw T o folders, one of which
has 24 questions, and the second fifteen additional
questions.
4213. Do you not think that these prospectuses fur-
nish clear evidence of the necessity for a departmental
authority covering the ■whole of Queensland with re-
gard to tobacco culture ?—I think that the matter re-
quires some legal enactment to protect individuals
from being persuaded to enter into something that is
futile.
4214. Do you think that it is likely that people who
may invest in such propositions and subsequently find
that they are not assisting either themselves, or the
tobacco industry of Australia will become rather an-
tagonistic towards tobacco culture in this country?—
Not necessarily. People who have taken shares in the
Pacific Tobacco Industries Limited, have been mis-
led into thinking that this concern is for the develop-
ment of tobacco-growing in Australia, and particularly
in North Queensland.
4215. There is nothing in the information available
to substantiate that view?— That is so.
4216. Is there no machinery at your disposal to
check that kind of propaganda?— No.
4217. Are you not entitled to make a public state-
ment, as the recognized authority on tobacco in Queens-
land, warning the public against too great optimism in
the matter? —I think that anything of that nature
should come from the head of my department, the
Minister for Agriculture. I brought the matter under
his notice.
4218. Have you seen the prospectus of the Common-
wealth Tobacco Company?— Yes.
4219. Have you furnished any report to your Min-
ister on the subject ?—No.
4220. Did you feel that you w T ere not called upon
to do so? —I recommended the individuals -who -were
preparing the prospectus to interview the Minister.
They did sy and he received full particulars at first
hand.
4221. Do you think that the Minister has received
a copy of that prospectus?—Y r es.
4222. Are you aw T are that your name has been used
by the promoters of the company?— Yes.
4223. And that an opinion given by you as Northern
Instructor in Agriculture, Townsville, and dated
18th November, 1929, occupies a very prominent posi-
tion in the prospectus?— Yes.
4224. It says, “ Bead what a Queensland Govern-
ment authority has to say, not only about Mareeba,
but about the actual lands on which the Company
will base its operations. The following is an extract
from a special and very full report, the original of
which may be inspected at the Company’s registered
office.” What report is that? —That is the report.
4225. What follows is only an extract?— There may
be another half a dozen words.
4226. Those words might modify the remainder of
the statement ?—They do not.
4227. Your report says “I have examined the soil
on the areas the Commonwealth Tobacco Company
proposes to acquire and am satisfied that tobacco leaf
equal to the best yet produced in Australia can be
successfully grown thereon ” ? —That is so.
4228. Did you examine that soil at the request of the
company or on your own initiative?—At their re-
quest.
4229. And did you submit a report to them? —Y r es,
They asked my opinion on Mareeba as a centre for
tobacco growing, and that is my report.
4230. Could you let the committee see the original
report?—l have not got it with me. It relates gener-
ally to the suitability of the soils in the Mareeba
district for tobacco growing.
4231. I am merely anxious to find out the circum-
stances surrounding the matter, for the information
of the committee ?—Two gentlemen met me and asked
my view T s as to the most suitable districts in Queens-
land for tobacco growing. Their names were Jones
and Horne. I understand that they are both New T
Zealanders. Mr. Jones is a retired New Zealand
merchant, and a member of the Transport Advisory
Committee of that country. Mr. Horne is a member
of the firm of Bunting and Horne, Australian attorneys
for the Prudential Assurance Company.
4232. When you expressed your opinion that
Mareeba was outstandingly suitable for tobacco culture
had you made a survey of all the tobacco lands of
Queensland? —Of North Queensland. My report
specifically states North Queensland, not Queensland.
4233. Did you make your survey in the course of
your official duties?—-It was based on a general know-
ledge of the soils throughout North Queensland, over
which I have travelled extensively during the last
eleven years.
4234. Have you any knowledge of tobacco lands
in other parts of Australia? —No,
4235. You have not seen Northern New South Wales
or Victoria?— No.
4236. I take it that you know the actual lands that
the company was taking up?—l was taken over the
actual portion to which the company referred in its
prospectus. I understood that the company then had
an option over the land, and have since purchased
it and other blocks.
4237. What is the total area that they purchased?
—About 2,000 acres.
4237 a. Is it all adjoining the Government plot at
Mareeba?—No. Eight hundred odd acres are
in a direct line, perhaps three miles from the
experimental block, and three miles from Mareeba.
The land adjoins the Chillagoe railway line. At the
time the company had an option over that country
and two other blocks. lam not sure that it exercised
its option over the other two blocks, but Mr. Jones
purchased approximately 500 acres of Crown lands at
public auction at Cairns.


4238. Was lie acting for the company?— Apparently.
4239. Although he is a New Zealander? —Yes.
4240. Do you think there is any relation between
the Pacific Tobacco Industries Ltd. and the Common-
wealth Coy. Ltd.? —None whatever.
4241. Do you consider that the soil that that com-
pany has acquired is similar in nature to that on which
the Government’s investigation is being carried out?
4242. Have you seen the manufactured article pro-
duced from tobacco grown at Mareeba?—Yes.
4243. What is your opinion about it? —It is a
tobacco which pleases my palate. The committee has
a few samples of that tobacco, and it appeals more
to me as a smoking mixture than any other Australian
tobacco on the market to-day. I may add that it also
pleases my palate more than any of the imported
tobaccoes that I have tried, and I have sampled a
good many, including Rhodesian.
4244. Have you tried any Australian tobacco other
than the Mareeba product?— Yes, “Sunday Best”
was the most recent. I once tried “ Referee ”.
4245. By Mr. Talley. —Have you ever tried
“ Waratah ” ?—No.
4246. Have you heard of it?— No.
4247. By the Chairman. —Have you tried “ Three
Eights”?—No.
4248. “ Bronze Wing ” ?—No.
4249. Do you consider the smoking qualities of
Mareeba tobacco superior to “ Sunday Best ” and
“Referee ” ?—Decidedly.
4250. Would it surprise you to know that I have
an acquaintance who has acquired a taste for “ Sunday
Best” and wall not try anything else?—l once knew
a man who smoked tea leaves. I agree that there are
quite a number of men who have no palate for tobacco.
Provided they get smoke out of the product they are
quite satisfied.
4251. A member of this committee tried the Mareeba
tobacco and did not like it? —Perhaps that is because
he is accustomed to strong tobacco.
4252. Does that not indicate that opinions as to
the qualities of Australian tobaccoes differ with the
individual concerned? —I can say definitely that the
majority of those who have smoked North Queens-
land tobaccoes have expressed the opinion that it is
a better tobacco than that retailed in the stores. I
am not a cigarette smoker, but I tried and like
Mareeba samples supplied to me by Mr. Slagg. I
also tried them on my friends, wdio expressed their
approval of them, I have not heard one complaint
as to the existence of bad flavour in Mareeba tobaccoes.
4253. Do you consider that there are any other areas
in North Queensland likely to produce as good a
tobacco as that grown in Mareeba? —Decidedly. The
thirty original plots of 100 plants each which were
grown in the 1927-1928 season were spread over'a large
area of country, from Bowen in the south to Mareeba
in the north, and one as far distant as 148 miles
from the coast. Although the tobaccoes differ slightly
in strength, the aroma of all of them is pleasing, and
they appear to possess no objectionable qualities. Mr.
Slagg expressed the opinion that the aroma wans similar
in all cases.
4254. Is not an impression being circulated that
Mareeba is the only portion of Queensland that can
grow smokeable tobacco? —That opinion is not held
in North Queensland.
4255. Does not the prospectus of the Commonwealth
Tobacco Company Limited convey that idea ?—I think
that it indicates that Mareeba offers the best possible
climatic inducement.
4256. By Mr. Tally. —Does it not state that
Mareeha is destined to be the Virginia of Australia?
—Yes, and that is my opinion, too.
4257. By the Chairman. —Although you have no
knowledge of other parts of Australia for tobacco
growing purposes?—l consider that if other parts of
Australia can grow tobacco as good as that produced
at Mareeba they should have done so during the past
fifty years.
4258. But other parts of Australia have not been
the subject of costly experiments as has Mareeba?
—I question the costliness of the experiments. We
consider that too little money has been spent there.
4259. The Australian Investigation Committee has
spent £3,150 at Mareeba within the last 21 years. In
that period only £97 was spent in Neve South Wales,
£149 in Victoria, £l5l in Western Australia, and £3OO
in South Australia. Nearly six times as much money
has been spent on tobacco experiments at Mareeba as in
all the other States of Australia put together ?—Presum-
ably in those other States barns, bulk sheds and cleared
land are already available. At Mareeba virgin land
had to be cleared, ploughed and drained, curing barns
and. bull-: sheds erected, and machinery purchased.
That involved a considerable expenditure of money.
4260. But no similar experimentation effort has been
made anywhere else in Australia. Is it therefore fair
to claim, having in mind the future of the industry,
that that is the only place in Australia that will grow
a smokeable tobacco ?—Although I have no experience
of tobacco growing, in other parts of Australia I have
smoked tobacco produced elsewdiere in the Common-
wealth and blended with American leaf. There is a
peculiar flavour in tobacco grown in southern latitudes
that is distasteful to my palate. I can detect it when
blended with American tobacco.
4261. You intimated that Mareeba was chosen rather
on the advice of Messrs. Tragenna and McGee than
upon your recommendation?— No. Mareeba was one of
ihe places suggested for plot work. It was left to me
to make arrangements as to the precise localities in
which plot work should be undertaken. The visit of
those gentlemen was necessarily hurried, as they had
only a few' davs at their disposal. It was a case of
rushing through a considerable territory.
4262. Were they the gentlemen who selected Mar-
eeba as the best site for the Commonwealth investiga-
tions?—No, Mr. Slagg selected Mareeba.
4263. But Mareeba was chosen before Mr. Slagg
came to Australia?— The Australian Tobacco Investi-
gation Committee’s farm at Mareeba was not decided
upon before Mr. Slagg took charge of operations. The
exploratory plots were established when he was ap-
pointed.
4264.Was Mr. Slagg really the authority who
decided that Mareeba should be the principal testing
ground under the Australian Tobacco Investigations
Committee?—l understand that he was.
4265. Did he select the area of 1,000 acres?—l can
give no information in that connexion.
4266. According to the evidence of Mr. Tregenna at
Sydney, he wans asked by the Development and Migra-
tion Commission to visit Queensland and investigate
its possibilities for tobacco-growing. He was asked
the following questions and gave these answers;—
What is your opinion of North Queensland as a tobacco-grow-
ing area? —It is the only place in Australia that T have visited
which I think will produce high-grade tobacco. I think that
we can grow there tobacco which’ will displace much of the
American product now imported.
To what parts of North Queensland do you refer?— The
country around Mareeba. The leaf grown there is the best
Australian leaf 1 have seen.
Were you at Mungana ? —I was particularly impressed with
tin* country from Mareeha to near Chillagoel
It would appear that Mareeba was the one spot that
stood out above all others in the estimation of Messrs
Tregenna and McGee when they made that trip ?—lts
outstanding merit is the quantity of land suitable for


tobacco culture that is available. There are other
districts which would grow good tobacco, but in which
the areas of suitable soils are less in quantity.
4267. I take it that those authorities would also con-
sider the value of the land with regard to experimental
work, and would not go out of their way to choose
expensive land if cheap country was available?— The
soil around Mareeba was considered most suitable for
the production of bright tobacco. It is a soil on which
little growth can be made without the application of
fertilizers; it is poor and sandy. That is why settlement
has not progressed in the Mareeha district. Crown
lands are available near Mareeba at 10s. an acre. I
understand that that is the lowest value that the Crown
places on any land selected for agricultural purposes.
4268. According to the evidence taken at Pomonal,
Victoria, growers in that area will not take £lOO an acre
for their lands?— People might ask £lOO an acre for
tobacco lands at Mareeba if the area were small, hut
it would be absurd to do so when there are thousands
of acres of similar land available for lease at a capital
value of 10s an acre. Crown lands in the vicinity of
Mareeba are at present held as mining reserves, not
because there is any likelihood of mining near Mareeha,
but because the country is not considered suitable for
agricultural purposes. It is too poor.
4269. You need not necessarily answer any question
that I put to you. Are you aware that Mr. Tregenna
has been appointed the managing director of the
Queensland Planters Limited?'—l gather that from the
prospectus. That is my only information on the
subject.
4270. You know that he was the State tobacco expert
for Hew South Wales for many years?—l understand
that that is so.
4271. By Mr. Martens. —Do you consider that there
is any appreciable quantity of land in the Ingham dis-
trict suitable for the growing of bright tobacco ?—There
is very little suitable land there.
4272. In what localities are the Italians growing
tobacco in that district ?—Some are on the Stone River,
some on the Victoria Estate, and others at Hamleigh.
4273. Do you think that there is any soil in the
neighbourhood of Mourilyan suitable for tobacco cul-
ture? —Ho. The land is too rich and the rainfall
too heavy.
4274. What of Cardwell?—There are areas of poor
soil in the Cardwell district, much of which is held
to be too close to the sea for tobacco-growing purposes.
Also the average rainfall in that district is ton heavy
for the successful production of bright tobacco.
4275. Do you consider that, generally, the northern
wet belt right through from Cardwell to Cairns is un-
suitable for bright tobacco culture? —One could safely
say it is unsuitable north of Rolling-Stone on the
coastal section, right up to Cooktown. Cooktown has
a 70-in. rainfall, but back of that town, at Laura, the
conditions are different.
4276. Do you not think that it would have been a
fair thing for you to report to those people who have
indulged in tobacco-growing on unsuitable land as to
the futility of their project?—l heard about it only
recently. The first person that I knew to be interested
in tobacco-growing in Horth Queensland, outside of
the plots supervised by the department, was Di Vergilio
at Trebonne. I saw him at his farm. Since then I
have been in communication with the Italian Consul
at Townsville, and have advised him that in the opinion
of my department most of the soils in the Ingham dis-
trict are unsuitable for the production of bright tobacco.
I suggested that he should communicate with his fellow-
countrymen telling them not to enter upon tobacco pro-
duction until their soils have been inspected.
4277. Do you know the Rev. Dr. Kelly, at Ingham ?
[ have met him.
4278. Have you had any conversation with him
about it?— Ho. I purpose visiting Ingham on my
return north, and should see him then.
4279. Would a failure on the part of these people
have a deterrent effect on the culture of tobacco in
other areas in Horth Queensland? —Hot if they received
a warning before they went too far. I omitted to
mention that the department is supervising an experi-
mental block near Ingham. Mr. Frank Fraser is
financing it. We do not give him much hope of
success.
4280. By the Chairman. —After Mareeha what is the
next largest area under tobacco cultivation in Horth
Queensland? —The term “Mareeha” is rather a com-
prehensive one. It really overlaps into other districts,
but it is found more convenient for our purposes to
call the whole area the Mareeba district. The experi-
mental plot is not more than ten acres in size. Although
1,000 acres have been set aside for the use of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation Committee it probably
will not use 950 acres of that reserve. A big quantity
of the country is broken and stony, and not useable.
Mr. Howell will give exact evidence as to the country
upon which the experiments are being made.
4281. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you think that a reduc-
tion of excise would materially help the growers?—l
do not think so, as I do not believe that any benefit
would be conferred upon the consumer, and it is
doubtful whether the grower would reap any advantage.
4282. What about an increase in the import duty?—
The present duty of 3s. a lb. affords a great protection
to Australian growers if they can grow a satisfactory
leaf. I should be sorry to see a higher duty imposed,
as the industry is already sufficiently loaded.
4283. Do you think that the agreement between the
States and the Commonwealth and the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company is having a good effect and
should be continued?— Yes.
4284. Do you think that the interests of the growers
have been prejudicially affected by that agreement?—
Ho; on the contrary, the growers should receive specific
benefit from it.
4285. Do you consider that the present system of
federal control by the Australian Tobacco Investigation
Committee is satisfactory, or that it should revert to
the States ?—I am of the opinion that the Investigation
Committee is functioning in an admirable manner.
The only fault that I can suggest is that insufficient
work is being done in Horth Queensland.
4286. Apart from the costs involved in clearing
virgin land and inaugurating these experiments, I take
it that it would be fair to assume that a very much
greater amount has been spent on experimentation in
the south during the past 50 years than has been the
case in the Mareeba area? —I should imagine so.
Judging from the results of experimental work in Hew
South Wales and Victoria, I should say that it would
take the Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee
quite a number of years to achieve the success attained
in Mareeba, on the present basis of expenditure in that
area.
4287. By Mr. Jones. —What is you opinion as to the
prospects of successfully growing cigar leaf in Horth
Queensland? —I believe the cigar leaf could be grown
quite satisfactorily in the north. The trouble is that
the taste for cigar-smoking has changed during the past
twenty years, and the growers have not kept pace with
the latest demand. Previously the average smoker pre-
ferred dark tobacco, and cut his own plug. To-day
smokers prefer light tobacco, and a great number
patronize cigarettes.
4288. In your report of the 7th January, 1927, you
say, “ Horth Queensland is capable of producing the
whole of the cigar leaf required by the Commonwealth
for many years to come, if not for all time.” Have you


any comment to make on that statement? — North
Queensland could supply the bulk of Australia’s require-
ments. I understand that the consumption of cigar leaf
in Australia is 500,000 lb. annually.
4289. You say that the leaf from the experimental
plots was flue-cured? —Not in all cases. The leaf from
the Mareeba series was flue-cured in a small barn
specially built for the purpose at Mareeba. Leaf was
flue-cured from Mount Garnet, Innot Springs, Silver
Yalley, Tumoulin, Herberton, Carbeen, Dimbulah, Pet-
ford, Alma Den, Chillagoe, Hervey’s Range, Binby,
Cardington, and two lots from Mareeba.
4290. What was the result ?—Favorable in every case.
"We got leaf from 25 different plots, and the results
from all were distinctly favorable.
4291. Do you consider that the results from the
fifteen plots that you enumerated are equal to the
results obtained from Mareeba generally?— Yes, in
regard to aroma.
4292. What about other qualities?—We can scarcely
offer a definite opinion in regard to texture, as the
quantity v, r as so small.
4293. Can you supply the approximate total area
under tobacco cultivation in North Queensland? —No.
That and the number of growers could be obtained from
the Customs Department.
4294. If a reduction of excise on Australian-grown
leaf were made and that reduction passed on to the
grower in addition to the price that he now T receives,
leaving the retail prices as they are, would that stimu-
late the industry?— Decidedly. If the tobacco manu-
facturers would purchase the leaf and give the grower
the advantage of the three shillings import duty that
now obtains I do not think that he should desire any-
thing more attractive.
4295. The tobacco manufacturers are prepared to
purchase more bright leaf than can at present
obtain. Should something not be done to stimulate the
industry?—lt only needs one or two growers to begin
production in the north of Queensland, and there Avould
be a rush to that area. Already Italians are rushing
into the industry, on the strength of the prospectus
of the Pacific Tobacco Industries Limited.
4296. Are you aware of the stimulus given to the
tobacco industry in Canada, Rhodesia and Cyprus
Avhen the Empire product was protected by a tariff?—
I doubt Avhether that protection is greater than Aus-
tralia now enjoys.
4297. It Avas a refund of a little OAmr 2s. in the £1
preferential duty?— Our excise tariff might be left as
it is, and the groAvers a bounty on the amount of
leaf manufactured.
4298. Are you aware that Avhen the Tariff Board
the industry some years ago it recom-
mended that the excise should be reduced by 6d. a lb.,
and that that 6d. should be given to the groAvers in
addition to the prices received for their leaf?— That
makes a greater appeal to me. I fear that a reduc-
tion of excise might favour the manufacturers, as it
might not be passed on to the consumer. I favour any-
thing that Avould growers more money for their
product.
4299. By the Chairman. —Would you favour a
Common\A T ealth bounty on Australian leaf, say 9d., 6d.
and 3d. a lb., according to the quality of the leaf?—
Not on all tobacco groAvn, as that might induce growers
to produce poor leaf.
4300. Do you ■subscribe to the opinion expressed
recently in the Sunday Pictorial to the effect that Aus-
tralian tobacco is equal to imported brands, and that
tests haA r c proved that North Queensland is the only
place to groAV the best Australian leaf, as the soil
possesses the necessary properties?—l am not
sufficiently experienced with the Avorld’s tobaccoes to
support that statement.
4301. Are you sufficiently experienced to say that
the tablelands of North Queensland are the only place
in Australia that can produce high-class tobacco? —I
am satisfied that there are suitable tobacco lands in
North Queensland in addition to those on the table-
land. There are a number of localities in North
Queensland which have climatic and soil conditions
favorable to the production of tobacco that would be
appreciated by the smokers of Australia.
4302. Have you conducted any tests of the smoking
qualities of tobacco grown in other parts of Australia ?
—I have smoked small quantities of tobacco produced
in other parts of Australia.
4303. Do you consider that you are a judge of aroma
in tobacco?— Yes, so far as my personal likes and dis-
likes apply.
4304. Do you remember that a story was circulated
some time ago to the effect that there was a eucalyptus
taint m Australian tobacco grown in southern areas?
—A theory was advanced to that effect.
4305. It was published. Had you anything to do
with that? —The statement was made by me to a press
interviewer at Townsville.
4306. On what did you base it? —-It was the theory
advanced by Mr. Tregenna and discussed by him, Mr.
McGee and myself during our travels in North Queens-
land in 1927. The result of certain experiments at tin;
Bathurst State Farm were also discussed in relation
to the objectionable aroma found in southern leaf and
absent from North Queensland leaf. In the north there
are different species of eucalyptus from those found in
the southern latitudes, and that perhaps added support
to the theory. Anything that I then gave to the
reporter was stated as a theory, and I think that it will
be found that I stated “if this eventually proves to be
correct ”.
4307. Can you safely say that Mr. Tregenna was the
gentleman who suggested the possibility of the theory
to you?—lf my memory serves me right it was Mr.
McGee who said most regarding that theory, Avhich
was, of course, corroborated by Mr. Tregenna. We dis-
cussed it when dealing Avith the subject of the bad
aroma of the southern leaf.
4308. Did they give you any data?- —It A\as sup-
ported by the result of their experiment Avith soil
imported from North Carolina and tested with Aus-
tralian soil at Bathurst. They gave me the results of
that experiment.
4309. Was that the first time that you heard of the
eucalyptus theory?— Yes.
4310. You did not put it forward as a theory that
you personally supported?—No, I mentioned the theory
as that of Mr. Tregenna, and I think that it Avill be
found that I said “if this eventually proves to be
correct
4311. The committee Avill be glad to receive a copy
of that statement?—l shall endeavour to supply a
copy. I discussed the matter Avith Dr. Darnell-Smith
subsequently, but the source of my information Avas
mainly Mr. McGee, in Mr. Tregenna’s presence.
4312. When you discussed the subject Avith Mr. Tre-
genna and Mr. McGee, did they inform you that they
bad deliberately added a certain amount of eucalyptus
mulch to the soil?— The experiment had not advanced
that far. That is a more recent experiment. lam
speaking of 1927.
4313. Did they explain anything to you about add-
ing a eucalyptus mulch to some Australian soil, and
tell you that at the end of the first year the aroma
from the bed was distinctly unsatisfactory, with a
strong eucalyptus taint. Further, that they added no
more eucalyptus mulch during the second year, and
that at the end of that year the aroma shoAved a dis-
tinct improvement ?—My conversation Avith them Avas


in 1927. The experiment was made subsequently. Ob-
viously they could not have informed me of those
experiments when they had not taken place at that
time.
4314. These are some questions asked of Dr.
Darnell-Smith in relation to the theory, and his
answers —
Was it put forward by Mr. Tregenna? —No. The three of
us discussed the matter, and their experiments showed that
different soils produced different results. We then sought
the explanation.
Was that the first time that the theory about eucalyptus
taint in tobacco was advanced? —Yes, so far as my know
ledge goes.
In the progress report of the Australian Tobacco Investi-
gations you refer to the residual effects of fresh eucalyptus
feaves added to river sand. What do you mean by the
‘ residual effects”? —In 1927, into a pit filled with sand, we
dug a number of fresh eucalyptus leaves. The tobacco grown
in that pit was tested at the end of the season. It had a
distinctly disagreeable aroma. The next year we decided to
leave the soil as it was; we put no fresh eucalyptus leaves
into the soil. At the end of the second year the tobacco
grown in the soil had a good aroma.
What are your comments on that? —On the theory
that a tobacco plant takes up a disagreeable aroma from
eucalyptus, it would suggest that, as no further mulch
was added during the second year, the tobacco plants
had taken out the whole of the eucalyptus taint from
the soil in the first crop.
4315. The eucalyptus theory is based on the idea that
certain types of eucalyptus infect soil, and that tobacco
grown on such soil has a disagreeable aroma. Dr.
Darneli-Smith’s experiment goes to prove that soil
deliberately infected with eucalyptus leaves imparts
a disagreeable aroma to tobacco plants during the first
years infectation, but that if no further eucalyptus
leaves are added the aroma of the tobacco leaf improves
during the second year, despite the fact that there must
be a residue of the eucalyptus taint in the soil?— Hot
necessarily.
4316. Dr. Darnell-Smith said that the residue was
there, but not, necessarily the residue that caused the
bad flavour in the first crop. The infection of soil by
the addition of a small quantity of eucalyptus leaf and
twigs would not nearly approach that of soil on which
eucalyptus leaves had grown and rotted for thousands
of years.
4317. The theory is that there is in soil upon which
certain eucalyptus trees grow a taint which transmits
itself to the tobacco plant. Does not the experiment of
Dr. Darnell-Smith prove that far from there being a
definite eucalyptus taint, it cannot he detected unless
the soil is deliberately infected with eucalyptus mulch;
that there is no taint normally in the soil?— That could
be suggested.
4318. In view of the experiment, do you not consider
that it was very premature for yon and those other
gentlemen to broadcast a statement that that was a
possible explanation of the had aroma alleged to he
found in southern tobacco ? —I Avas under the im-
pression that the theory and the results of the experi-
ment were common knowledge in Hew South Wales and
Victoria. It was discussed openly by Mr. McGee not
only with myself, hut Avith other persons in Horth
Queensland. If the theory is sound that the objection-
able aroma of southern groAvn tobacco is due to the
organic deposits from the eucalyptus tree it indicates
that Horth Queensland, which contains a distinctive
type of eucalyptus, is immune from the taint.
4319. But the experiment conclusively proves that
unless the soil is deliberately infected the had aroma is
not present?—l gathered that the soil treated was
washed river soil, which contains no organic matter
at all.
4320. This eucalyptus theory is deliberately based
on that experiment? —The experiment certainly sup-
ports the theory.
4321. But at the end of the second year, with no
further addition of leaves, the aroma was good?—lf
at the end of the second year the tobacco was free
from the eucalyptus taint it suggests to me that the
previous crop had taken out the deleterious matter.
4322. Do you suggest that the ordinary soil on which
eucalyptus forests grow would contain the amount of
eucalyptus taint necessary to flavour tobacco? —It
certainly suggests itself. I understand that 40 lb. of
eucalyptus leaves were put into this soil. That would
probably be only about 10 lb. of dry leaf. A plot of
land on which eucalyptus had grown for a thousand
years would have a much greater infection than an
experimental plot to which only 10 lb. of dry leaves
were added.
4323. Then you would assume that you get that
eucalyptus taint in all classes of vegetable plant grown
on that soil?— Hot necessarily.
4324. Would not that be a reasonable assumption?—
Ho.
4325. By Mr. Martens —Why should it he peculiar
to tobacco? —Tobacco is a peculiar plant. A great
many more substances are found in tobacco leaf than in
the leaves of ordinary plants.
4326. By the Chairman. —I take it that whatever
may have been the date on which the experiment with
eucalyptus leaves w r as carried out at Bathurst, you had
no knowledge of the experiment at the time when you
first discussed the theory with Messrs. Tregenna and
McGee %—I had no knowledge of the 1927 experiment at
Bathurst at the time when those gentlemen discussed
the subject with me, which was about the third week
in August, 1927.
4327. Did those gentlemen give you any information
about the experiment when they discussed the
eucalyptus theory with you in 1927 ?—I was
given to understand that the experiment was in
progress.
4328. But you previously said that you knew nothing
about the experiment? —You referred distinctly to an
experiment where, in the first year, the tobacco leaf
absorbed the eucalyptus taint and where, in the second
year, the quality of the leaf had improved. The second
experiment was carried out subsequent to my con-
versation with Messrs. Tregenna and McGee.
4329. I understood yon to say very distinctly this
morning that in 1927, when you had your first con-
versation with these gentlemen about the eucalyptus
taint, you had no knowledge of the experiment that
they were carrying out?—l understood in 1927 that in
that year a certain quantity of eucalyptus leaves had
been added to a bed of washed river sand, and that
it produced this distinctly eucalyptus aroma. I am not
exactly certain that I knew at the time that Mr.
Tregenna was there, but I gave no information of that
nature in my interview with the press reporter.
4330. When you first met those gentlemen in mid-
August, 1927, they gave you some information about
the Bathurst experiment, telling yon that they had
added some eucalyptus leaves to a pit and that the
result was a had aroma?— Yes, and I treated that in-
formation as confidential.
4331. Had that experiment been completed AA T hen
they first met yon?—l am not quite sure that at the time
of their visit they had detected the bad flavour of the
leaf. Whatever they told me at that time was treated
as confidential, and I did not mention it to anybody.
4332. You met these gentlemen in the middle of 1927.
Dr. Darnell-Smith states that the first years experi-
ment Avas under way in 1927. Did they inform you
then that the experiment was under w r ay ?—I cannot be
certain.
4333. Did they furnish you with any data in con-
nexion Avith that experiment? —The only data was that
they were conducting an experiment Avith American
and Australian soils at the Bathurst experimental plot.


4333 a. When did they give you that information? —
In the middle of August, 1927, lam speaking entirely
from memory, and cannot he quite sure.
4334. The crop had to he grown before being tested
for smoking qualities, so that the tobacco tested as the
result of the 1927 pit experiment would he harvested
in March, 1928?—1f that is so they did not tell me
about the experiment. The only information that
they gave me was when we met in August, 1927. I
cannot remember the dates. Perhaps the matter was
spoken of on a later occasion, but I treated anything
that was told me as confidential.
4335. Can you tell the committee when you made
the public announcement at Townsville concerning the
eucalyptus taint ?—That was in 1928.
4336. Would it be soon after their visit?—l think
that it must have been in 1928.
4337. It appeared in the Townsville press?— Yes.
4338. Were you then in possession of the data
compiled by Mr. Tregenna and Dr. Darnell-Smith as
a result of the eucalyptus experiment?— The only data
I was in possession of was that in connexion with the
plot work, concerning tests with American and Aus-
tralian soil, and with washed river sand.
4339. What form did the data take?— Everything
was entirely oral.
4340. Did you see them again after 1927?—N0. I
had a letter from Mr. McGee later on.
4341. You admit that it is quite possible that they
were not in a position to give you data until early in
1928, and that they could not have given it to you in
August, 1927 ?—I could not give the committee the
dates on which I received the first and later informa-
don. The subsequent information was of an entirely
confidential nature, contained in a private letter, and
treated as confidential.
4342. From whom did you get that letter —from Mr.
McGee ? —I could not say at present who it was wdio
told me with regard to the other experiments.
4343. Could yon find that letter ?—No. It is a per-
sonal letter —a private communication.
4344. The results of the 1927 tests were conveyed
to you in a letter from somebody? —I could not tell you
whether 1 got them in a letter, verbally, or how I got
them.
4345. But you bad the information at the time you
made your Townsville statement?—l did not refer to
that. What I said was that it was anticipated that re-
sults would be obtained from the experiment.
4346. You made that statement merely on the verbal
information conveyed to you my Mr, Tregenna and Mr.
McGee when they visited you?— Yes.
4347. You are not in a position to tell the committee
that you had the data in writing?—l did not have the
data. I spoke from memory.
4348. Did you know that that statement was given
great prominence in the Brisbane and Sydney press,
and that it also appeared in the Melbourne press ?—No.
I saw extracts from one Sydney publication, but saw
nothing m cut her the Brisbane or Melbourne press.
4349. Did you receive any communication from Mr.
Tregenna subsequent to that publication, expressing
regret that you had made the matter public?—lf the
committee will permit me, I shall not refer to any com-
munication received from Mr. Tregenna.
4350. Mr. Tregenna's name was coupled with the
statement in Sjdney, and I think that in his evidence
to this committee he said that the statement was released
without his authority ?—That is correct. I received
a letter from Mr. Tregenna informing me that Mr.
Gepp had accused him of inspiring the statement. I
replied to Mr. Gepp to the effect that Mr. Tregenna had
not instigated the statement, that I took full responsi-
bility for it.
4351. Looking back on the matter, do you not think
that it was rather serious for you, the agricultural ex-
pert for North Queensland, on such flimsy grounds as
you possessed, to make a statement which was calculated
to do a great deal of harm to the tobacco industry of
Australia?— No. The theory appeared to me to be
extremely attractive; one that I thought quite possible
of proof. That particularly disagreeable aroma in
tobacco leaf grown in southern latitudes of Australia
was not apparent in any of the cigar leaf grown in the
north over a period of years. 1 gave samples of that
leaf to Mr. Tregenna and Mr. McGee when they w r ere
at Townsville and after testing it they agreed that there
was no trace of the aroma to which they objected in the
southern leaf.
4352. Did you test any of the southern leaf to enable
you to form a comparison of the aromas'? —Yes.
4353. Of cigar leaf?—l have never seen any south-
ern cigar leaf. If that aroma is due to some organic
matter contained in the southern soil it would appear
just as much in the cigar as in the pipe leaf.
4354. Have you heard that cigar leaf with a very
fine aroma is being grown in South Australia?— No.
4355. Have you heard that leaf which has a very
fine flavour is being grown at Pomonal in Victoria? —I
have heard that at Pomonal they grow one crop in every
five years.
4356. The Committee can correct that, from evidence
received in that district ?—lt is only what I have heard.
4357. Did you, at any time, obtain any samples of
tobacco from northern New South Wales?— Yes, from
the Tamworth district. I smoked some of it in the
form of cigarettes.
4358. Have you ever had samples from Victoria—
tobacco from Wangaratta or Pomonal?—No, only
manufactured tobacco; for instance, “ Sunday Best ”.
4359. Have you ever tried Pomonal cigars?—No;
I have never had the opportunity to do so.
4360. In view of your very limited acquaintance with
the leaf that is produced in different parts of Australia,
outside of Queensland, do you not think that even now
you are going rather far in suggesting that there is an
objectionable aroma in tobacco produced in southern
Australia?—l base my opinion on the mixture of Aus-
tralian with American tobacco, marketed by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, such as “ Main
Top,” “ Log Cabin,” “ Vice Regal ” and “ Champion
de Luxe ” mixture. In those four tobaccoes I con-
sider I can detect the bad flavour of Australian
tobacco.
4361. By Mr. Tvlly. —What about “Champion”?—
That appears to me to be wholly American leaf.
4362. By the Chairman. —Have you tried “ Signet ”
tobacco ?—No.
4363. Do you consider, as the result of your smoking
experience, that you are justified in the conclusion that
all Australian leaf grown outside of Queensland to date
has a bad smoking taste?—l suggest that that is so in
connexion with all the Australian leaf that the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company blends with American
leaf.
4364. Some time ago I asked a member of Parlia-
ment if he could give me the name of a really good
smoking tobacco that would not burn my tongue or
make my throat sore, and he said “Yes, I smoke it
myself; ‘Log Cabin’”. Do you contend that that is
an unsatisfactory blend?— That is a tobacco in which
I imagine I can detect the peculiar flavour of southern
Australian leaf.
4365. What form does that flavour take?—ln my
case it immediately affects my throat.
4366. Is that your test to discover the presence of
Australian leaf?— Yes.
4367. You have had a lot of experience growing
tobacco, and you have a practical knowledge of the
industry in Queensland. Your opinion carries weight


with the general public of Australia. JDo you not think
that it was very drastic for you to express an opinion
that the southern Australian tobacco has a bad aroma
simply because it has an unpleasant effect on your
throat?—l never made that statement. The statement
in the press was to the effect that a theory had been
advanced by Mr. Tregenna. I described that theory,
and said that if it were correct it would be to the ad
vantage of North Queensland, which has a different
type of eucalypt from that found in the south, one
which certainly has no phellandrene. That does not,
in my opinion, condemn Australian tobacco.
4368. Do you think it fair to make a public state-
ment at all when it may prejudice the Australian to-
bacco industry, particularly when it is based on such
a flimsy foundation ? —lt is not a flimsy foundation.
4369. Why give it at all?-—It was merely given as
a personal opinion.
4370. But you gave it as an expert?—l gave it as
a trained agriculturist.
4371. Does not your opinion carry considerable
weight with the public?— Not neceessarily.
4372. In view of the fact that no conclusive data has
been produced about the alleged taint in the tobacco
grown in Australia, have you taken any steps to coun-
teract the impression conveyed in your original state-
ment ?—I do not see the necessity to do so.
4373. You are disposed to allow that to continue ir
existence until somebody, such as this committee,
catches it up. You know T that two or three years have
elapsed since you made that statement and that no fresh
data has been supplied?—l have the data advanced by
Mr. Tregenna concerning the theory. I never stated
that the theory had been proved; merely that it had
been advanced.
4374. The evidence given to this committee to the
press goes to show 7 that the theory has, to a large extent,
been disproved?— Washed river sand gives a neutral
aroma. If by the addition of eucalyptus leaves suen
sand conveys to tobacco a distinctly objectionable aroma
it naturally follows that that is due to the admixture of
the eucalyptus leaves.
4375. In view 7 of the fact that Dr. liivett, one of the
members of the Australian Tobacco Executive, Dr.
Dickson, in charge of the Federal Laboratory, and Dr.
Angell, conducting the blue mould experiments, have
appeared before this committee and expressed the
opinion that it would be impossible to condemn Aus-
tralian tobacco on the experiments so far carried out,
would you be prepared to accept their opinions aa
scientists? —I am unaware that those gentlemen have
made any definite statement discounting the theory. I
have never held that it has been proved, but have
merely advanced the suggestion as a theory.
4376. But you allowed the implication to be broad-
cast that it was pretty well understood among experts
that that was the trouble with southern Australian
tobacco? —No. All that has gone out is that newspaper
interview. Nothing was definitely stated that the
trouble was attributable to that cause. I merely said
that such a theory had been advanced, and that it was
an attractive one.
4377. Did you use the words “ attractive theory ”?
Yes, to the best of my belief. To me it was an attrac-
tive theory new in agriculture.
4378. Yet you had no data to support the theory,
and are not in a position to say that you have seen any
such data? —I do not see that data has anything to do
with the matter. You add humus to the soil, and it
has a definite effect on tobacco. That is a most attrac-
tive theory.
4379. As a responsible officer of the Agricultural
Department do you not think that it is necessary for
you to consider any statement before you make it
public?—Wliat possibilities can my statement
I said, “If it can be proved.” It has not yet been
proved.
4380. Assume that the idea gathered support in the
minds of the general public, who would not smoke
Australian tobacco because it contained an alleged
eucalyptus taint. Do you not think that there should
be some responsible authority to disabuse the public
mind on the point ? —The smoking public are not going
to be coerced in their choice of tobacco. They judge
purely upon its effect on their palate. If they enjoy
tobacco they will continue to smoke it. If not, they
will leave it alone.
4381. Are you aware of the use that the Pacific
Tobacco Industries Limited have made of your state-
ment. Their prospectus says, “ New Zealand tobacco
is very much superior to Australian-grown, owing to
the eucalyptus tree not growing in New Zealand”? —
Any damage done by my statements would affect manu-
facturers. So far as lam aware, they have made no
move or protest in the matter.
4382. Does not that convey the impression that the
manufacturers are less concerned about the value of the
theory than the general public?—l presume that the
manufacturer is entirely swayed by the tobacco that
comes before him. If the public will smoke it the
manufacturer will buy and manufacture it. If the
public will not buy it, the manufacturer will not pur-
chase that tobacco.
4383. Do you not think that had you not made the
statement the public would not have heard about the
eucalyptus theory", as the other gentlemen would have
kept the matter quiet until some definite result had been
obtained from the experiments?—l cannot say anything
definite on that point. At the time I made my state-
ment I thought that the eucalyptus theory was common
knowledge in New South Wales and Victoria.
4384. But it was not?— The information was not
given to me under any seal of confidence. Had that
been the case I should have respected the confidence.
4385. By Mr. Swinson. —What do you estimate to be
the yield per acre of tobacco grown on suitable land in
the Mareeba district?—A fair average over a period of
yearn would be about 750 lb. per acre.
4386. What do you estimate the cost of production to
be, having regard to depreciation of barns, bulk sheds,
and machinery?— Approximately £35 per acre, which
would not include interest on the capital outlay.
4387. What would be the cost of clearing?— With
green timber, about £7 to £lO an acre. If the timber
were first killed it could be cleared by power implements
at a cost of £3 to £4 an acre.
4388. What average cost would you suggest for clear-
ing?—£7 an acre.
4389. What percentage of bright leaf do you antici-
pate can be produced from the Mareeba lands?—ln
normal seasons the most suitable land in the Mareeba
district could produce almost 100 per cent, bright,
tobacco if handled by experienced labour; certainly
over 90 per cent.
4390. Therefore, a crop of 750 lb. an acre, at 2s. a lb.,
would bring in £75 gross to the grower?— Yes.
4391. That is about 100 per cent, profit?—At £35
expenditure it is a little more.
4392. And with a bonus of Is. he would get £ll2 10s.
gross, which equals a profit of 210 per cent. ?—He would
receive more than that.
4393. Do you know of any other crop which will pro-
duce such a profit ? —-I have only one instance, a potato
crop produced at a time when potatoes brought £3O a
ton, an exceptional price.
4394. Do you not think that a profit of 100 per cent,
is sufficient inducement to stimulate production?—
Decidedly.


4395. A suggestion has been advanced that the excise
should be altered, or that growers should be given a
bonus. Do you not think that that would encourage the
production of interior tobacco; that people would
engage in the industry with little knowledge of the sub-
ject and without respect to the quality of the land
employed?— Yes. Growers would not be guided by
aavice if they received a bonus on what they produced,
rhey would grow tobacco on the richest soil available,
and produce a rank leaf that was of no use to the manu-
facturer.
m 4396 - you know that the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company offers to buy very much more bright
leaf than is at present available ?—1 have the circulars
of the company.
4397. And that most of the growers contend that an
all-round price of Is. per lb. would pay them?— Yes.
409§. Does sufficient inducement exist at present for
men to take up land and endeavour to grow the right
type of tobacco,, without any alteration of the excise or
the granting of a bonus to growers ?—The price secured
irom the small lot marketed last year by the Townsville
Chamber of Commerce indicates that the growing of a
suitable type ot tobacco is a highly payable proposition
under present circumstances.
4399. Do you contend that Queensland can to-day
produce the bulk of the cigar tobacco needed ?—The soil
is available on which it could be produced. A great
deal of work would be necessary to instruct growlers as
to the culture, maturing, and grading of cigar leaf.
4400. By the Chairman. —lias your department
issued any printed instructions to the Queensland
growers?—Tes, a tobacco pamphlet.
4401. Who is the author?— Mr. Neville.
4402. Would that not be rather out of date?—lt has
an addition by Mr. Tregeuna. That pamphlet is dis-
tributed to applicants for tobacco literature.
4403. Are there many applicants?— Yes. There has
been such a rush on the pamphlet that it is now out of
print.
4404. Do you receive any applications from people
anxious to learn about fine-curing?—l have had only
one or two so far.
4405. Have you any instructor available for the
purpose ?—No, but I have told those men that if they
care to come along when we are flue-curing some of
our tobacco they are welcome to do so. I think that
one or two will come along this year at Hervey's
Range.
4400. Who will he in charge?—l shall.
4407. Have you any assistants?—-Yes.
4408. Are they improving as eurers ?—Yes. We
cured the leaf there last year.
4409. Do you consider that the art of flue-curing
is difficult to acquire?— Not with the northern grown
leaf, which is light, and colours very well.
4410. By Mr. Jones. —The following question was
submitted to Mr. Tregeuna, and the answer is his- —
Are we to understand that your objection to Australian
tobacco is confined to the heavier types?—l think the IMit
types are also inferior in aroma. Cigarettes made °of
light Australian tobacco would not be so acceptable to the
public as are Capstan cigarettes.
Do you hold a similar opinion?—l have no experience
of cigarettes made from light Australian tobacco. The
cigarettes which were tendered this moring, made
from Mareeba leaf, are quite as palatable as ordinary
Capstan cigarettes.
4411. Mr. Tregenna was also asked—
Have you smoked any cigarettes made entirely of Aus-
tralian tobacco?— Yes.
How did they affect you?— They affected me in the nose
and throat.
Were they cigarettes made by yourself from Australian
tobacco?— Yes. I have also smoked manufactured Australian
cigarettes, but the ones to which I refer were made by mo
from the best Australian leaf I could get.
Do these Mareeba cigarettes affect your throat?— No.
I am not a cigarette smoker, but everybody to whom
I have handed those cigarettes and asked for an opinion
has made favorable comments. I presume that the
cigarettes to which Mr. Tregeuna alluded were not
made from this leaf.
4412. in view of the great strides in the production
of tobacco in several of the British Dominions, notably
Canada, .Rhodesia and Cyprus, as the result of tariff
protection, and in view of the languishing state of the
industry in Australia, do yon think that effect should
be given to the recommendation made by the Tariff
Board for a reduction in excise on Australian grown
leaf, provided that the growers received that benefit
in addition to existing prices?— The lack of consump-
tion of Australian leaf indicates that there is something
wrong; that it is unpalatable to the smoker. The duty
is at present high, and I do not see that any further
protection will induce smokers to use the local product.
The quality of our tobacco must be improved before
it will become popular.
4413. Import duty into Great Britain is Bs. a lb.,
with a preferential duty to the dominions of 2s. a lb. ?■—
That is so, but no tobacco is produced in Great Britain.
4414. I o you not think that the Australian industry
needs some stimulus, seeing that we produce only ten
per cent of the tobacco used in this country?—l do
not think that any tariff or excise remedy would make
any difference so far as Northern Queensland is con-
cerned. A number of people are simply waiting for
the word io go ahead and grow 1- tobacco.
4415. Why do you think the Tariff Board would
have made such a declaration, after thoroughly investi-
gating the industry?—l do not know anything about
the evidence advanced to that Board in any other State.
I confine my remarks to Northern Queensland. There
are no disastrous droughts in the Mareeba district
such as are known in other parts of Australia. The
crop may lie relied on year after year. Dry years
might reduce the amount of a crop, hut there would
certainly he a crop, as there is always sufficient rain
during December, January and February to ensure a
result.
4416. You told Mr. Swinson that a reduction of
excise might lead growers to produce inferior quality
leaf ? —I referred to the granting of a bonus.
4417. At present the buyer fixes the price for tobacco,
and that price automatically regulates the bonus, which
is paid by the company. Would you favour the Govern-
ment paying the bonus instead of the company?—So
long as the grower gets the bonus things are quite
satisfactory. I favour the company rather than the
Government paying it.
4418. If the Government paid the bonus would the
company not he more inclined to give the full value for
the leaf. Leaf bringing 2s. a lb. carries a bonus of Is.
a lb. If the price were Is. lid. a lb. the bonus would
be only 3d. a lb._ The company fixes the price of the
leaf, and that price regulates the bonus, which is now
paid by the company?—l do not see that it makes much
difference who pays the bonus, provided that the leaf is
purchased on the company’s valuation.
4419. Supposing that you as a grower had a crop
which you estimated to be worth 2s. a lb. If you
received that 25., it would automatically carry with it
a bonus of Is. a lb., which equals a total of 3s. a lb. If
instead of that the company paid you Is. lid. a lb. for
your leaf, you would receive a bonus of only 3d. a lb.,
a decrease of lOd. a lb. in all. A difference of Id. a lb!
represents about £9 a ton. A difference of lOd. a lb.
represents between £9O and £lOO a ton. That would
mean the difference between success and failure to the
grower?—l consider that it amounts to the same thing.
The grower would be no better off if the Government
paid the bonus.


4420. Bo you think that it would be better to give
a straight out market price and not pay a bonus to
reduce tue excise on Australian leaf, with the guarantee
recommended by the Tariff Board? —I cannot see that
that would stimulate the Australian industry. The
existing duty of 35., together with a bonus, is quite
sufficient to induce prospective growers to begin opera-
tions in Queensland. If I were to leave the department
to-morrow I should undertake the growing of bright
tobacco, I do not know anything more attractive in
North Queensland at present than the growing of bright
tobacco under suitable climatic conditions.
4421. It has not been grown extensively during the
past few years?—lt is only in the embryonic stage.
4422. Have you noticed any signs of blue mould?—
A little. Blue mould was in evidence every year when
cigar leaf was grown in the north, but with the 30
experimental plots tried out in the season 1927-28 there
was no blue mould or any other disease in the seed bed.
We have had no blue mould since in our plot work in
other districts.
4423. Am I right is assuming that you would not
favour the reduction of the excise duty paid on Aus-
tralian leaf in order to stimulate the industry ?—I
cannot see that the reduction of excise would stimulate
the Australian industry. It probably would not cause
the manufacturers to pay any higher price to the
growers, and would not result in any advantage to the
consumer.
4424. Would not the buyers be in a better position to
pay higher prices to the growers?— They would, but
would they do it?
4425. In the Sydney Bulletin of the 25th December,
1929, it is shown that one big buying company made
profits amounting to £1,011,307 during 1927. If a
reduction of excise would make no difference to the
company, but would make a big difference to the
grower, do you think that it would stimulate the
industry?—lt would if the company guaranteed to
give the grower the additional Is.
4426. The recommendation of the Tariff Board pro-
vided for such a guarantee ?—Then I would decidedly
favour such a procedure. Anything of benefit to the
grower would stimulate the industry.
4427. Would that help Australia to produce the type
of tobacco w 7 hich the manufacturers have not previously
been able to obtain ? —Any advance in price on the
cured leaf to the grower would certainly stimulate pro-
duction. I should favour a reduction of excise if the
grower received the benefit.
4428. By the Chairman. —What exactly did you
mean when you said that there were a lot of prospective
growers in Queensland waiting for the word to go
ahead? —My department has advised inquirers about
tobacco-growing not to rush too quickly into the in-
dustry, but rather to "wait and learn the result of the
experimental work now being con ducted at Mareeba.
4429. Did you give that advice to the people who
are floating the Commonwealth Tobacco Company
Limited? —They were already aw T are of that advice.
4430. And they disregarded it ?—Entirely.
4431. Will you report to the Australian Tobacco
Investigation Committee when you know the result
from those experimental plots ?—I should report to my
department, which in turn will report to the Common-
wealth Committee. lam in touch with Mr. Slagg, and
work in conjunction with him. He is made familiar
with all the v/ork that is done apart from Mareeba.
4432. Are you working in collaboration at Mareeba ?
—No. Mr. Howell is in control there. I visit Mareeba
only as an interested person.
F. 218, —17
4433. Are you not interested on behalf of yottf
department, which is financially concerned in the
venture ? Are you not exercising a sort of surveillance
over the experiments ?—I visit the plots and inspect
them, but take no responsibility in connexion with the
work.
TJte witness withdrew.
William Alexander Hollingworth, Clerk-in-Charge of
the Land Settlement Inquiry Section, Lands
Department, Queensland, "was called, sworn, and
examined.
4434. By the Chairman. —Can you give the com-
mittee any information regarding the inquiries for land
in the Mareeba district since 1927? —My department
has not had a very great number of inquiries, con-
sidering the activities taking place there. There have
been only a few during the past twelve months.
Generally, we have sought the advice of the Department
of Agriculture before giving information to inquirers.
My section has not really advised anybody to take up
land in the Mareeba district, as we regard that district
as poor from an agricultural point of view. There is
a very considerable area of vacant Crown lands all
around the Mareeba district w r hich is of very poor farm-
ing quality.
4435. What is the capital unimproved value of that
land?—-Wo have opened it at from 10s. to 15s. an acre.
4436. And cannot you get many people to touch it
at that price ?'—No. It is generally regarded as poor
country.
4437. is it very sandy?— Yes. The description of
the land is “ poor, sandy gravelly, basalt, and granite ”.
It is heavily timbered, with blood-wood, gum and box<
In places there is stunted timber, indicating poor land.
4435. Can you tell the committee what area has
been taken up by the Commonwealth Tobacco Com-
pany Limited, which has its registered office at 19
Bligh-street, Sydney, New South Wales?— That com-
pany has not taken up the land in that name. The
land is registered in the name of H. C. Jones, and is
known as portion 58v, Parish. of Tinaroo. It con-
tains 549 acres, 1 rood, 28 perches. The land was
specially made available for purchase by that company.
It was offered at auction at the Lands Office, Cairns,
on Tuesday, 4th March, 1930, under freeholding
tenure. Since the first of this year these lands are
offered either under perpetual lease or freehold tenure,
but this specific piece of land was specially offered as
a freehold.
4439. What was the price?— The upset price placed
on the whole area was £275. The purchasers were to pay
one-tenth deposit and the balance in ten equal annual
instalments, with interest at 5 per cent, per annum. By
paying regularly every year they would freehold the
land in ten years. The land was bought at the upset
price. There is no provision in our land laws to give
anybody priority over a piece of land that is offered
at auction, but in this instance there was no com-
petition. The surveyor’s description of the country
is “thickly timbered forest, box, gum, blood-wood, and
ii-tree, miscellaneous bushes; very poor, sandy, and
gravelly soil; undulating country ”,
4440. Would £7 an acre cover the cost of clearing
that country ?—I have only passed through that country
in the tram. It did not appear to be as heavily tim-
bered as is our north-coast country, near Gympie,
which costs up to £25 an acre to clear. I should think
that this country would cost easily £ls an acre to clear.
1 say that, not as an authority, but from office informa-
tion. I have had no practical clearing experience. I


know that land cleared for soldier settlement on the
north-coast line cost £25 an acre. That was for pine-
apple growing, and was more heavily timbered than
the Mareeba country.
4441. Has your department had any dealings with
the Commonwealth Tobacco Company Limited?—
There is correspondence in our files from a Mr. M. H.
Hampson. I think he was the man who inspected the
land and interviewed the officers of my department.
His address is Hew Zealand Insurance Buildings,
Queen-street, Auckland.
4442. These gentlemen conducted all the negotiations
for the transfer of the land, but so far as you are aware
it belongs to Mr. Jones, and not to the Commonwealth
Tobacco Company Limited? —Mr. Jones was the man
who signed the sale list when the land was offered. He
did not sign it on behalf of the company.
4443. Have those people applied for any option over
any other land?— Yes, over an area in that locality.
Our records show that the Government has offered them
a further area of 1,500 acres of available Crown Land,
to be auctioned, if they so desire. That is adjacent to
the other property.
4444. Has any upset price been placed on it? —Ho.
The area has not yet been defined. That was the pro-
mise made by the department at the time of the other
sale.
4445. So that, if they choose, they can have alto-
gether a little over 2,000 acres of that class of land?
—Yes. The terms of the option were set out by the
Lands Department, and they will be honored if the
company so desires.
4446. How long will that land be tied up while these
people are making up their minds?—Ho period has
been fixed for the option.
4447. I presume that it can be cancelled at the will
of the department?— Yes. The department is quite
anxious to get the land selected. Hitherto there has
been no enquiry for it.
4448. I suppose that the land would be about the
same upset value as the other land?— Yes.
4449. Have you any application from individuals for
land in that locality?— During the past six months we
have a record of ten new selections that have been
taken up, the total area being 3,400 acres. That land
was not bought at auction, but taken up as perpetual
lease selection tenure, with the right of converting it to
freehold if so desired. Application must be made before
the end of June, or such extended time as the Minister
for Lauds may allow. I tender a list of the names of
the new selectors as follows; —
P.L.S. 1473 (190 Formartine). —G. A. Veivers, of Kuranda,
farmer, 355 acres. 2nd August, 1929.
P.L.S. 1475 (144 Tinaroo). —W. A. Hassell and A. S. Lilley,

P.L.S. 1476 (176 Formartine). —J. McGlexx, of Koah, 264
acres. 4th October, 1929.
P.L.S. 1480 (91v Tinaroo). —L. A. Jenkinson, of Mareeba,

P.L.S. 1481 (55v Tinaroo). —A. S. Lilley, of Atherton,
solicitor, 318 acres. 6th December, 1929.
4450, Are all of those selections in the vicinity of the
land taken up by Mr. Jones?— Yes. Some adjoin that
land, and all of them are within a. 10 miles radius of it.
4451. Are they close to the land taken up by the
Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee?—l have
not the exact location, but in a straight line they would
be about six miles distant.
4452. Is all the land between the two sets of blocks
available for selection ?—There are some areas of
Crown land and some freehold.
4453. Has any of the land within the six miles
area been taken up?— Yes. There is some alienated
land in between, held either as freehold or as selections
from the Crown.
4454. Would it be possible to take up a continuous
area within the eight miles?— Ho.
4455. I take it that the reason for going eight miles
away w r as in order to obtain a continuous block of 549
acres, plus a possible 1,500 adjoining acres? —Yes.
There is really no great area of Crown lands between
the town of Mareeba and any spot 4 miles out, but at a
distance of 10 miles out there is plenty of it.
4456. What area has the Australian Tobacco Inves-
tigation Committee taken up ?—I have not that infor-
mation with me. I believe it is a very large reserve.
4457. Have they not a reserve of 1,000 acres?—l do
not know. I think that the area has been made an
experimental reserve by the department.
The witness withdrew.
George Booth Brooks, Senior Instructor, Department
of Agriculture, Central Division, Queensland, was
called, sworn, and examined.
4458. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position?— For about fifteen years.
4459. Have you had anything to do with tobacco
cultivation in your division during that period?— Only
during the last six months.
4460. How did you come to take it up as recently
as that ?—As a continuation of the developmental work
going on in the north.
4461. Had you any experience of tobacco cultivation
before that? —Practically none. Years ago I used to
visit the Inglewood district when tobacco cultivation
was going on there.
4462. What comprises your activities during the
past six months? —-The carrying out of experimental
plots extending from Mackay to Bundaberg.
4463. Are you in charge of that work?— Yes, in co-
operation with the Australian Tobacco Investigation
Committee. I co-operate with Mr. Slagg. I tender
a description of the respective plots, showing the
experimental work that is being carried out.
4464. How many plots are there in your area?— Ten
full-sized plots and nine with a smaller area.
4465. What is the area of a full-size plot?— One
hundred plants, fertilized, and 25 plants unfertilized.
4466. And a small plot?—lt ranges from 50 to 100
plants.
4467. Have you noticed any increase in the interest
displayed by the primary producers of Central Queens-
land in tobacco culture during the past six months? —
Quite a lot.
4468. What form does it take?—l think it is due
to the operations of the Pacific Tobacco Industries
Limited,
4469. I take it that a canvass was made in the area
to bring the merits of the company under the notice
of the farmers?— Yes. I think that the canvassers
operated in the town for a period, and that they are
now in the country.
4470. Have you come across any man who has
spoken to you about the venture in a critical way?—
Yes.
4471. Are any of them sceptical?— Yes.
4472. Do you think that the prospectus is too
alluring?— Yes. I heard indirectly that the company
had signed up with different farmers in the Dawson
Valley district for an area of over 300 acres to be put
under tobacco. Those farmers will grow leaf for the
company.


4473. Have you beard the conditions? —I believe
each farmer has to take at least 25 shares, and pay
£3 10s. down. I do not know the period that be has
to pay the balance.
4474. He also has to undertake to grow a certain
amount of tobacco?— Yes.
4475. Did any of those farmers tell you whether
the company undertook to purchase that tobacco?—l
believe the company will do so only if the leaf is
suitable.
4476. Have you heard any of the people in your
area discussing the possibilities of big developments in
tobacco culture in Queensland as a result of the Com-
monwealth’s experiments?— Yes, quite a number.
4477. Do you think that they been made sufficiently
acquainted with the extent of those experiments? —
Yes.
4478. Do you consider that they understand all about
them? —Quite a number do.
4479. Where did they get their information? —Erom
the actual experiments carried out in the respective
districts. They see the work going on.
4480. Have you advised anybody to go in for tobacco
culture in your division? —Ho. 1 am waiting for the
results of the test. We begin curing to-day.
4481. Will you publish the results of those tests? —
Yes.
4482. Has the State an agricultural journal?— Yes.
4483. Will the results be published in that journal?
—That is for the department to decide.
4484. Is that not the only medium? —There is the
press.
4485. You would not issue a special tobacco gazette?
—Ho.
4486, Do you find there are many inquiries for
tobacco literature?— Yes. We cannot supply the
demand.
4487. What type of literature do you supply?— The
pamphlet written by Mr. Heville and supplemented by
Mr. Tregenna. It is now out of print.
4488. Is that the only tobacco bulletin that you have?
—We have quite a number of Mr. Slagg’s bulletin,
also that by Dr. Darnell-Smith, many of which have
been circulated.
4489. Do any people grow tobacco in your division
other than experimentally?— Hot now. They did a few
years ago, between Rockhampton and Yeppoon.
4490. Was there not a man named Jones who took a
prize for tobacco a few years ago?— Yes. He is now
dead.
4491. I take it that, so far as the central district of
Queensland is concerned, nobody is growing tobacco on
a commercial basis, but you are conducting a certain
number of experimental plots, and have reason to
believe that if the experiments are encouraging a num-
ber of people who are watching them are likely to go in
for tobacco culture for themselves in the district?— That
is the position.
4492. Are you a smoker ?—Ho.
4493. So that you cannot express an opinion as to the
menace of Australian tobacco?—Ho.
4494. Have you ever heard anything about a
eucalyptus taint in tobacco?— Yes.
4495. When? —I believe I saw it mentioned in the
press prior to the visit of Mr. Tregenna and Mr. McGee.
4496. Did you meet those gentlemen when they came
to Queensland in 1927 ?—I took them around my
country.
4497. Were they looking for likely country on which
to grow tobacco?— Yes.
4498. Did you show them any?— Yes. I took them
over the range west of Sarina.
4499. Had they already been up north when they saw
you?— They were then returning from the north. It
’was in August.
4500. Did they seem to be very favorably impressed
with the north?— Yes.
4501. From your recollection, did they display any
real interest in the possibilities in Central Queensland
for tobacco-growing?— Yes.
4502. They were there only one day?— Yes.
4503. They would not have much time to look over
Central Queensland in that day?— They were particu-
larly interested in the country west of the range.
4504. Would it not be utterly impossible for them,
on the information that you supplied and with the time
available for inspection, to form any accurate con-
clusions as to,the possibilities for Central Queensland
for tobacco-growing?— They could simply explore the
soils.
4505. What is the area of Central Queensland? —
Something like 200,000 square miles.
4506. Do you, as an agricultural authority anxious to
see a new industry developed in your area, consider that
it was possible for those gentlemen to form any accurate
opinion about the capability of Central Queensland to
grow tobacco, as a result of that visit?— Hot of the
central district as a whole. They saw only a very small
portion of it.
4507. Did the story about the eucalyptus theory
concern you very much ?—Ho.
4508. Did you consider that it was a very serious
development in the tobacco industry?—l did regard it
in that light.
4509. Did you accept it as being a proved theory?—
Ho.
4510. Did you realize the danger it would have to the
industry ?—Yes.
4511. Was there much talk about it amongst the
people interested in tobacco in your district?— Ho.
4512. Did you discuss it with Mr. Tregenna and Mr
McGee?—The subject was mentioned.
4513. They must have mentioned it to you, because
you could have known nothing about it at the time ?
I think I made inquiries from them in regard to it.
4514. Do you remember what they told you?— They
told me that experiments were being carried on at the
Bathurst farm with imported soil, and with local river
sand.
4515. They did not tell you their decision in the
matter ?—Ho.
4516. When they went away was it your opinion
that the theory was proved, or it was just in the air ?
That it was merely in the air.
4517. By Mr. Martens. —Just where in the Dawson
Valley are you experimenting with tobacco-growing?—
Hear Wo wan, on the Dee River, at Deeford.
4518. Where is the farm located near Bundaberg?—
At Thabeban, towards Clayton.
4519. And at Mackay?—Hear Mount Chelona.
4520. At what places around the Dawson Valley has
this company induced settlers to undertake tobacco-
growing?—At Biloela and Thangool.
4521. Do you think that would be a good locality for
tobacco-growing ?—Ho. There might be possibilities at
X made tlie experiment at "Wowfiii merely
to ascertain the results.
The witness withdrew.
Robert Wardlaw Howell, supervisor, Australian
Tobacco Investigation, stationed at Mareeba
Experimental Station, Horth Queensland, was
called, sworn and examined.
4022. By the Chairman. —Wliat is your experience in
tobacco culture ? I have been in charge of the experi-
ments since January, 1928.
4523. How long have you been at Mareeba?—Ap-
proximately three years. r


4524. Had you any experience in tobacco-growing
before you came to Queensland? —Yes, a lifetime ex-
perience.
4525. Where ?—Horth and South Carolina, where I
was connected with tobacco-growing and curing. My
father was the tobacco expert with the Hew South
Wales Government, before the advent of Mr. Tregenna.
I have been engaged in tobacco work in all the States
except Western Australia, of which State I have only a
little knowledge.
4526. How long have you spent in Hew South
Wales?— Practically all of my life.
4527. In what district particularly?—Tamworth.
4528. How long were you there?—l was almost
reared there. My father had the Government experi-
mental farm at Tamworth. I left that centre to go to
America and came back from that country to Tam-
worth. I then went to Victoria.
4529. Did you go to America with the idea of im-
proving your knowledge of tobacco?— Yes.
4530. Were you representing any specific body?—Ho,
I went purely on my own account.
4531. Had you any official position when you
returned ?—I was instructor for the Tamworth Tobacco
Growers Association, and employed by them col-
lectively. I had to teach them how to flue-cure tobacco,
and effect any improvements that I could in tobacco-
growing in that district.
4532. How long were you there in that capacity ?—A
little over a year.
4533. Was that when you were introducing flue-
curing in that district?— Yes. I went there first with
the object of introducing flue-curing in the Tamworth
district.
4534. Where did you then go ?—To Victoria, where I
had a temporary position with the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company to teach Victorians curing and
handling tobacco.
4535. In what district ?—The Horth-Eastern district,
including Wangaratta.
4536. Then where did you go?—I established a
nursery at Bendigo to supply growers with tobacco
plants.
4537. Is that still in existence?— Ho.
4538. We were told at Wangaratta that growers were
getting their plants from Bendigo. Did you know any-
thing about that?— Yes. I supplied them. I after-
wards removed the nursery to Wagga, believing that
place to be more suitable for plant growing. My sur-
mise proved to be correct and I remained at Wagga for
two years.
4539. As a result of your experience, do you think
that it would be a good idea for State Governments to
establish nurseries to grow tobacco plants?—l think
that it would be better left in the hands of private
growers, if they could be sufficiently instructed in the
subject.
4540, Apparently" no other private individuals have
gone into tobacco nurseries with the exception of your-
self?— There have been a few in Victoria.
4541. Do you not think that it would be a good idea
for State departments also to establish nurseries for
plant breeding?— Perhaps the States would be better
able to handle the matter than private individuals.
4542. Have you ever had a position under a State
department ?—Ho.
4543. Have you ever applied for one?— Yes. I
applied for the position of expert in Hew South Wales
many years ago, before Mr. Tregenna’s time.
4544. Were there any others after the job ?—I think
there were one or two.
4545. Is it not a fact that there is a very great
scarcity of tobacco experts in Australia ?—Yes.
4546. Has that been a factor in handicapping the
industry?— Yes, to some extent.
4547. It would depend largely upon whether the
experts were experts ?—Yes.
4548. Have not the opportunities in Australia been
limited for experts ? —Yes. Each State growing
tobacco employs one expert. Outside of that there has
been no demand for them.
4549. Only Victoria and Hew South Wales have
employed experts?— Yes.
4550. Do you think that it would be possible to
establish a school of instruction for tobacco experts ?
Yes.
4551. Do you think that we have any men in Aus-
tralia sufficiently advanced in tobacco culture to act
as instructors?— Yes. I do not know of any outside
those filling existing positions.
4552. If you were given the job of carrying out
experimental w T ork for tobacco-growing and you needed
the assistance of men with expert knowledge do you
think that you could find half a dozen amongst the
growers of Australia who would be of any real value
to you?— Ho. I might select one or two with consider-
able knowledge. Possibly I could select half a dozen
with experience of their local conditions, but not with
general experience, although there may be such men
about.
4553. The committee has received a statement from
you which gives a general outline of the tobacco experi-
ments conducted by you in Queensland ?—That is so.
4554. It is dated August, 1929. Would that be
when the report was prepared or the date when the
experiments began ?—That was when the report was
prepared.
4555. That is a month ago. Is there not a good deal
of work to report on since then?— Yes.
4556. Have you added a supplementary report ?
That cannot be done until the present experiments are
completed. Data is being kept for the purpose.
4557. For our purposes this report carries us only
to August, 1929 ?—Yes. It includes the preliminary
experiments carried in 1927, and it is a brief summary
of the work carried out since the inauguration of
tobacco experimental plots in Horth Queensland.
4558. Had you charge of the exploratory plots in
1927 and 1928?— Mr. Pollock has already begun the
work, which was previously set out and commenced by
Mr. Tregenna. I came up to give the benefit of my
knowledge. I worked in conjunction wfith Mr. Pollock.
4559. You were really the expert ?—I had more
experience than Mr. Pollock, although he had conducted
the experiments to a certain point.
4560. Have you personally supervised the various
experiments carried out in Central and Horthern
Queensland ?—Hot altogether. The work performed in
Central Queensland was so far away from Mareeba that
I was unable to give detailed attention to it. I
have assisted Mr. Brooks by letter, and he has visited
the north in order to see what was being done. The
central district has been left in the hands of Mr.
Brooks mainly, and he is assisted by Mr. Slagg and
myself. Recently a young man has been sent up to
give him further assistance.
4561. Don you think that the industry in Queens-
land is sufficiently advanced to justify the appointment
of a State tobacco expert ?—Yes.
4562. Do you think such an appointment would be
very helpful to the Queensland tobacco industry?— Yes,
but the time is not yet ripe for growers, to rush indis-
criminately into tobacco-growing. They have to pro-
ceed cautiously, and must be guided by expert
information if they are to sell the leaf that they pro-
duce. The whole thing will depend upon the report of
the present investigations.
4563. You came to Queensland as an employee of the
Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee ?—Yes.


4564. You opened up the work in North Queensland?
—Yes. Prior to that I made an economic survey of the
tobacco position in New South Wales and Victoria. I
was accompanied by Mr. Bainbridge, Mr. Tregenna,
and Mr. Temple Smith.
4565. Were you a party to the survey report sub-
mitted to the Australian Tobacco Investigation Com-
mittee ?—Yes.
4566. Did you prepare the details embodied in the
report?— Some of them. In some cases we could not
agree, and recorded individual opinion.
4567. Had you the same status as the other members
of the survey ?—Yes. I was entitled to submit a
minority report on an equal footing with the others.
4568. Did you disagree with many of the other
members ?—Yes. I disagreed a good deal with Mr.
Bainbridge and Mr. Temple Smith. In some minor
matters I disagreed with Mr. Tregenna, but generally
speaking I was in accord with his views.
4569. When you came to Queensland were you sent
direct to Mareeba ?—No. The experiment had been
decided upon prior to my arrival, over an area of about
34,000 square miles. The plots were dotted about here
and there on land apparently suitable for tobacco
culture. Particular attention was paid to light sandy
soils, and heavy soils were planted in order to ascertain
the effect. The experiments extended from Bowen to
Mareeba, and as far inland as Pentland, a distance of
about 148 miles from the coast. My report embraces
the results. Mareeba was not selected because it was
the most suitable spot, but because of several reasons,
ft was a large area of available land, and was suitable
as regards climate and soil. Other areas as far as
200 miles away from Mareeba are equally as promising
for tobacco culture. Mareeba was made the centre
merely for convenience. It has the rainfall and the
climatic and soil conditions that we sought.
4570, Was any attempt made to establish an experi-
mental area similar to Mareeba in Central Queensland ?
—Not exactly. In the first place the northern experi-
ments were to extend as far as Mr. Brook’s territory, but
because of an abnormally wet season they were failures.
4571. What is the rainfall of Mareeba ? inches,
taken over a period of 25 years.
4572. Is that rainfall Avell distributed ?—lt is some-
what erratic in some districts, but generally speaking it
is well distributed over a period of four months. The
dry season usually breaks up at the end of December,
and January and Pebruary are the heaviest wet months.
Towards March and April the rain begins to diminish,
and later peters out to nothing.
4573. Is there any blue mould in Mareeba ?—Yes.
We did not notice any in the preliminary plot, but in
the second year blue mould was discovered in the seed
beds. During the last season we have had spots of blue
mould in one paddock, but it has not done any damage
so far. It did not do any damage the first year, although
16 inches of rain fell after the mould made its appear-
ance. It did not spread. It would appear that the
environmental conditions are not so conducive to the
mould spreading as they are in the south. Had there
been a similar rainfall in the south the crops there
would have been wiped out.
4574. How many acres are being experimented with
at Mareeba?—About seven. We have 22 varieties of
leaf planted side by side in one paddock. In all we
have about 25 varieties growing this season.
4575. Have you taken a crop off any one of those
varieties and marketed it?— No. In our first year on
the experimental farm we produced a fair crop in the
field. That was in 1928-1929 when the farm was first
established.
4576. Was that the first year that you produced
tobacco at Mareeba for manufacture for commercial
purposes?— No. We used the tobacco from the pre-
liminary tests in 1927-1928 for that purpose, but we
wanted a larger quantity. We cleared the land and
planted about ten acres of tobacco on the farm in 1928-
1929. We found that it would not stand up to the
excessive rainfalls without drainage, and lost most of
the crop. We harvested some on the higher sections.
This year we drained the land with open ditches, and
that proved most satisfactory. We had more rain in
any given time this season than was the case last
season, but the crop has been most favorable.
4577. Do you expect a crop of half a ton to the acre ?
No, 500 to 750 lb. would be as much as we could expect.
Perhaps with very favorable seasons one could expect
a half a ton to the acre.
4578. Do you expect to get 100 per cent, bright leaf
off the land ? —Very nearly. I have seen 100 per cent,
bright leaf gathered at Mareeba. At a conservative
basis I would average it from 80 per cent, to 90 per
cent, bright leaf.
4579. By Mr. Jones. —Do you class mahogany as
“ bright ” ?—Only bright mahogany.
4580. Do you get much lemon leaf in the Mareeba
district ?—I have seen crops cured in that district with
100 per cent, lemon leaf. I have never seen a similar
result in America. My report gives a coloured percent-
age for 22 plots, some of which were planted in very
heavy ground that could not be expected to produce
good tobacco.
4581. How long do you expect it will take to com-
plete the Mareeba experimental work ?—Three weeks
to a month so far as the harvesting is concerned. I
have already cured three barns of tobacco this season.
4582. Do you expect to supply a conclusive report
regarding Mareeba at the end of this season ?—Yes.
4583. Have you read the prospectus of the Common-
wealth Tobacco Co. Ltd. ?—Not in detail.
4584. You must have noticed that most alluring
prospects are held out to growers in the Mareeba
district; that practically a 100 per cent, proposition is
offered ? —I do not think that that was done intention-
ally to boost Mareeba itself. It is merely because the
experiment has taken place there, and all eyes are
watching it.
4585. Do you consider that, from the inconclusive
nature of your experiments, it is advisable to invite the
public to subscribe to a company such as that at this
stage ?—I should not like to say that. If the company
were managed by the right men it would be quite
all right. I would not advise people to rush into
tobacco growing without expert tuition.
4586. The concern suggests that with expert tuition
the proposition would be safe ?—I agree with them
there, but I am not prepared to pass an opinion as to
the management of labour, and so forth.
4587. Are you a smoker ?—Yes.
4588. And a judge of smoking tobacco? —I claim
to be.
4589. Do you subscribe to the opinion that tobacco
grown at Mareeba will be equal to the world’s best,
including the best American ?—I would not say that
it would equal the world’s best or that it would be
inferior to it. It depends on the taste of the individual
smoker as to what may be called the best. Different
people have different likes and dislikes. I think that
Mareeba tobacco makes an excellent smoke, and I
am quite satisfied that the general public will smoke
it if it is grown on the right type of soil and cured
and handled in the right way. Mareeba tobacco is
different from American tobacco, as is the case with
tobacco grown in other countries, but it is a very palat-
able smoke. Wherever we have tried to grow tobacco,
from Bowen to Mareeba, a distance of 280 miles, where
the soil is sandy and light and the rainfall suitable, we
have produced tobacco which is indistinguishable, one
locality from the other.
4590. By Mr. Martens. —Were not the climatic con-
ditions different ?—They were very similar. There
is a belt running through the north on one side


of which it is too dry and on the other too wet. Where
the conditions are suitable in the belt excellent tobacco
can be grown.
4591. By the Chairman. —Do you know anything
about a concern called the Queensland Planters Ltd. ?
I know that it exists.
4592. What does it consist of ?—I do not know.
4593. Have you ever come in contact wi'th any
member of it ?—Ho. I have no knowledge of the con-
duct of its activities.
4594. Have you inquired about it?—l have not
had time to do so. I know that the company is being
formed, that bonds are being sold, and land purchased.
4595. Do you know of the relation it has to the
Commonwealth Tobacco Co. Ltd.?—l take it that the
Commonwealth Tobacco Co. Ltd. finances the Queens-
land Planters Ltd. to establish the plantation, &c.
4595 a. The latter would be the growing com-
pany, and not necessarily a selling company?— The
prospectus states that tobacco will be planted, harvested
and sold “by the most scientific and expert tobacco
concern in Australia —Queensland Planters Ltd.”
4595b. Do you think that that claim is warranted ?
I do not know the personnel of the company.
4596. Do you consider that the Commonwealth
Tobacco Co. Ltd. is justified in making its claim ?—I
would rather not answer that question. It is possible
for the company concerned to be the most up-to-date
growing company in Australia, because of its manage-
ment. I do not know of a company attempting to grow
tobacco in Australia before.
4597. Is not the claim based on something that will
be done in the future ? —I take it that that is so and I
understand Mr. Tregenna has something to do with
the company, in so far as giving them advice along
certain lines, and has also given them his opinion on
Horth Queensland tobacco in the prospectus.
4598. There must be other people in it?—l have
heard nothing as to who would be associated with the
company. I have merely learned that it is coming
into existence.
4599. So far as the experimental work at Mareeba is
concerned are you in a position to say that it is a justi-
fiable move for the company to invite the public to
subscribe to a growing and selling tobacco concern estab-
lished adjacent to the Government experimental plot ?
—For those who wish to invest in that sort of project,
provided that it is run on proper lines, it is quite all
right. It has the element of speculation that applies to
similar projects. I do not know enough about it to
express an opinion.
4600. Would you say that if the Mareeba experi-
mental results are satisfactory at the end of this season
anybody would be justified in urging the primary
producers of Queensland to go in for tobacco culture ?
Yes, I consider that tobacco culture in Horth Queens-
land would be justified, if they began on a moderate
scale, were supervised by the necessary experts, and
caution was exercised.
4601. In other words, if you can locate any land
similar to that at Mareeba, in regard to soil and climate,
the venture would be safe enough?— Yes, but only sub-
ject to the advice of experts.
4602. Where are the growers to obtain the advice of
experts ? —I do not know.
4603. By Mr. Morgan. —What about the investi-
gation committee ?—lt cannot attend to individual
growers.
4604. It could take soil analyses and advise on htat
point ?—Yes, but it would be necessary for a man to
travel to the farms of the growers to give them advice
and teach them how to cure tobacco. Although the
circulation of literature is helpful it is not altogether
satisfactory. We have had diseases in Horth Queens-
land in our tobacco experiments, and they will recur in
future, as is the case elsewhere.
4605. By Mr. Tully. —Don you know any of the
selectors who have taken up blocks in the Mareeba
locality ?—Yes, two of them.
4606. Have any of them begun to live on that land
yet ?—Ho.
4607. How close is their land to your experimental
area ?—The most distant would not be more than eight
miles away.
4608. Would A. S. Lilley, of Atherton, be far away ?
—About seven miles.
4609. Would Hassell and Lilley be far away ?
About four miles. The experimental area at Mareeba
comprises 700, and not 1,000 acres. It is not all suitable
tobacco land, but was selected because of its variation
of soil to enable the investigation committee to test
those soils variations without having to travel too far
around the district to attend to the different experi-
mental blocks. There is no desire on the part of selec-
tors to get near to the farm. Suitable land extends as
far away as Mt. Garnet, and yet the district is still
termed “Mareeba.”
4610. There is no such thing as irrigation in the
area?— Ho. A suitable district for tobacco-growing
should not need irrigating. To produce good quality
tobacco one must hare poor soil, with a sufficient rain
fall, and use fertiliser.
4611. By Mr. Jones. —Do you know exactly what it
costs to clear land at Mareeba ? —lt depends on the time
of the year that the cleaning takes place. In the dry
season the ground is fairly solid, and then it would cost
up to £3O an acre to hand grub some of the country. If
advantage is taken of the wet season and the timber
is pulled down with a forest devil it could be cleared
for from £6 to £l2 an acre, according to the density of
the scrub. More of it would cost £lO an acre than £6
an acre.
4612. Do you know whether the blue mould that
made its appearance in your district originated in the
seeds ?—That is a theory that has been advanced
recently. I have no doubt that seed coming from
districts where there was no mould would produce
plants liable to infection by other means. My seed beds
were free from it this season. The mould developed
afterwards. It is possible that the disease is carried
in the seed, but I do not think this is the only means
of infection.
4613. How r far away is the nearest tobacco-growing
area from your plots ?—Ten miles.
4614. Was there any blue mould near those adjoining
areas that season ?—Ho.
4615. Can you account for its presence ?—Only by
assuming that some host plant carries the mould from
year to year.
4616. By Mr. Tully. —What plant do you suggest
that would be?—l cannot say.
4617. Is there any wild tobacco in the district?—
Yes, at Atherton, 25 miles away. There are a few
tobacco plants in the gardens of private people at
Mareeba. The whole thing has been a puzzle for some
years.
4618. Have you smoked cigarettes made from Po-
monal tobacco ?—Yes.
4619. Have you liked them ?—I do not like them.
Some of the tobacco coming from Pomonal is better
than that from other southern districts.
4620. Can you see any reason why Australia should
not produce enough tobacco to meet its own require-
ments?—l think that Australia will produce its own
tobacco requirements except brands used for blending
purposes.
4621. Mr. Gepp, when giving evidence, was asked—
Except for a small piece of choice tobacco, desired by
fastidious smokers, do you think that in time Australia will
he able to grow all the tobacco she requires ?—Yes, par
ticularly by blending. I am hopeful that by blending tobacco
grown in the northern and the southern districts, satisfactory
results will be obtained.


Is that your opinion ?—Yes; that is practically what I
have just said, except that I am not hopeful of the
tobacco now grown in the Southern districts being used
in appreciable quantities for blending purposes unless
its burning aroma can be improved.
4622. By Mr. Slagg. —Did you take part in the tests
made with Queensland leaf in 1927 and 1928 ?—Yes.
4623. Do you recollect that in those tests we found
very little difference in the smoking qualities of the
flue-cured tobacco obtained from the 1927-1928 ex-
ploratory test plant over a wide range of country
extending from Bowen in the north to Mareeba in the
south, provided that the soil conditions were approxi-
mately similar ?—Yes, they were practically identical.
4624. Do you also recollect that it was on that
account that we decided to concentrate our experimental
work to Horth Queensland, at Mareeba?—Yes. The
area chosen for experimental work was selected because
it was representative of a large area of country that
possessed soil and climatic conditions conducive to the
production of the best tobacco. It thoroughly repre-
sented the north.
4625. From what you have seen of Central Queens-
land, do you think that there may be a possibility that
the leaf secured from the exploratory tests in that area
may be similar to that grown in the north ?—I should
think it would be the same, or very nearly so. I
cannot see why the central district should not produce
the same type of leaf as the north. I think the experi-
ments there are justified.
4626. By the Chairman. —lf .a tobacco company
could produce on a similar satisfactory scale at
Mareeba, do you consider that that would justify
tobacco production in other of Queensland ?
Hot without experiment.
4627. Do you suggest that all this experimental work
will benefit Mareeba?—Hot Mareeba alone. The
results of Mareeba are applicable to the parts of the
Horth having similar soil and climatic conditions.
Experiments could be carried on on a smaller scale
in places of doubtful suitability and if the indications
were satisfactory, that would warrant more extensive
experimental work. It is possible to determine the
suitability of a place by a small experiment.
4628. By Mr. Martens. —When you refer to
“ Mareeba,” you mean the whole stretch of country
between Bowen and Herberton ?—Yes.
4629. By the Chairman. —l take it that you mean
practically the whole of Horth Queensland? —We
mean any country up there that has soil and climatic
conditions similar to those of Mareeba. Reference has
been made to the expense involved in experimental work
in the north as compared with that in the south. I
remind the committee that we went into virgin country,
remotely situated, where everything was costly. It was
necessary to purchase machinery at considerably higher
prices than those obtaining in the south. The land
had to be cleared and drained, and barns had to be
built at a time when it was raining continuously. Some
of the timber for the buildings had to be carried from
the roadside to the site, because it was too boggy for any
vehicle to proceed right to the place itself. All of that
inflated the expenditure. In the south, existing barns
and other conveniences could be used. I think that the
committee has a wrong conception of that expenditure.
4630. By Mr. Martens. —You are incorrect in your
assumption. There is no desire to misrepresent any-
thing. The committee has arranged to obtain detailed
expenditure, so that it may be enlightened on the
subject ?—I merely desired to point out the adverse
conditions under which we have wmrked in Horth
Queensland.
4631. By Mr. Jones. —Have you had, any experience
in the Texas district ?—Yes,
4632. How do you regard the prospects dfitihe
tobacco industry there ?—I believe that the climatic
conditions are too dry and that most of the soil -Is t6o
fertile. v ■
4633. Have you read in the press how two Italians
averaged £231 from seven acres of tobacco last season,
with a profit of £l4O per acre ?—Yes.
4634. Does that not indicate that that country has
great possibilities ?—lt has, so far as the production of
that type of leaf is concerned, but there can be over-
production of that class of leaf. While they can find a
sale for that tobacco its growth will be profitable.
4635. Is not a leaf that brings 2s. lOd. per lb. a good
type?— Hot necessarily so. Colour does not always
count. A tobacco may be excellent in colour, and have
poor burning qualities.
4636. It is bought on colour and texture only. There
is any amount of similar land to that in the Texas
district. Does that not indicate that it has great
possibilities?— Yes, provided a ready sale can be
found for tobacco with that aroma.
4637. Would you say that the soil and climate of
Texas are suitable for the production of bright leaf ?
Yes, but not a leaf with an aroma up to the standard
demand. I consider that if there is any reduction in
excise and that is passed on to the grower, it should be
made only on the very best quality of tobacco. There
should be very little variation in what is termed the
best. I believe that that would stimulate the Aus-
tralian tobacco industry.
4638. Would you suggest the appointment of a
valuation board to assess the price of the leaf ?—I do
not know how that could be worked satisfactorily.
The witness withdraw.
Behr Lefand, fruiterer, 52 Merton-street, South
Brisbane, was called, sworn and examined.
4639. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco-grower?
—Only upon an experimental basis.
4640. Have you much knowledge of tobacco-growing?
—I grew a certain amount in Ukraine, where I used to
be a buyer nearly twenty years ago. I came to Aus-
tralia in January, 1914, and immediately began to in-
quire as to the possibilities of tobacco-growing in this
country. I was told that Australian tobacco was un-
suitable in its smoking qualities, and that no sale could
be found for it. I therefore discarded my idea tem-
porarily. In 1917 a friend of mine came from
Palestine. He knew a good deal about tobacco culture,
and applied to the Queensland Agricultural Depart-
ment to be assisted in making experiments in tobacco-
growdng in this State. He was referred to the Federal
Government, who intimated that the cost of such experi-
ments would be too great, therefore the Government
could not participate in them. In 1927 I w T ent to
the Queensland Agricultural Department and asked for
some tobacco seed. They supplied me with some, also
a pamphlet dealing with tobacco culture. I planted
the seeds in my yard, but was not successful in raising
tobacco plants. I then applied to the experimental
farm at Bathurst, and was supplied with two varieties
of seed, South and Dunbur. I successfully raised a
satisfactory leaf, cured it, and submitted the result to
the department. At that time Mr. Slagg had just
arrived to take over the directorship of tobacco culture
in Australia, and I asked for his address. Mr. Quad-
ling informed me that there was a job in prospect for
me in Horth Queensland. Just then a Premiers’
conference was taking place, and, as a result of it, the
whole of the tobacco investigation in Australia was
placed in the hands of the Investigations Committee.
I applied to the latter and I was informed that no
position was available for me, but I would be communi-
cated with should any arise in the future. I submitted


samples of my tobacco to Mr. Slagg, and was told
that the quality was only fair. I took first prizes at
the Brisbane Exhibition for my tobacco in 1928 and
1929.
4641. By Mr. Morgan. —What is your present occu-
pation?— Fruit hawking. In 1929 I went to Texas
seeking some land on which to cultivate tobacco. I
was offered some, but could not obtain any financial
assistance. In another place they laughed at my
ideas. Later, I applied to people in the Tam worth
district in an endeavour to take up land there, stating
that I should cure my tobacco in my own way, and not
flue-cure it. The reply that I received was that the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company would not buy
anything but flue-cured tobacco. In November of last
year I endeavoured to locate country in the vicinity of
Brisbane suitable for tobacco-growing. I successfully
did so, ten miles from the city. The soil is a bit sandy,
and the plot is surrounded by gum trees. That I
welcomed, because they afford a protection from the
westerly winds. I planted some seed, and am just
about to reap the harvest. The final lot of leaf should
be taken off the plot in about a fortnight. I tender to
the committee samples of my products. That leaf
grows very well, and, if it cures satisfactorily, the
farmer with whom I am working and I will take up
about five acres of land on which to grow tobacco.
4642. By the Chairman. —Where did you grow the
sample that you once sent to me at Tamworth ?—ln my
backyard, in black, swampy dirty soil. Here I present
the same tobacco. Only a few leaves are left as I
destroyed the lot in the presence of a Customs officer
and made a spray of it.
4643. Is this a sample of cigar leaf ?—I had to show
it as cigar leaf at the Exhibition because I had no flue-
cured leaf, and I have treated it as cigar leaf.
4644. Did you get a prize?— Yes, for my exhibit,
which has been destroyed. I should class the leaf
which you now* hold as third class. It is essential to
have satisfactory soil and a suitable climate to produce
good tobacco. Here the pests are the greatest draw-
back. _ A grower needs to have knowledge and
enthusiasm.
4645. Have you approached the Queensland Depart-
ment of Agriculture to see if they will assist you in
your experiment?— Not yet. If it proves to be satis-
factory I shall have to seek financial assistance to carry
me on for eight or nine months, until the new crop
will be ready when I shall have grown tobacco on a
big scale. So far I have sought no help.
4646. By Mr. Morgan. —Have you approached the
Agricultural Bank for an advance?— No. X liave
nothing to offer as security. I have shown my tobacco
to the manufacturers, who told me that they do not use
any Australian leaf at present. The person whom I
interviewed made a cigar of my leaf and smoked it.
His only criticism was that it was a little too strong.
More likely the heavy soil caused that. He said that
the aroma and flavour were very good, and that it was
superior to some of the imported leaf so far as absence
of bite was concerned.
4647. Why did you not go to some of the people
connected with the Bowen and Mareeba experiments
and endeavour to obtain a piece of land in either of
these localities?—l do not know those people. If the
Government will not assist me, I shall have to try my
friends to obtain some money.
4648. Were you a grower in Ukraine ?—Only on a
little scale. But I have a thorough knowledge of culti-
vation and curing tobacco, but not manufacturing. The
Australian industry is not at present in a satisfactory
position. It has been assisted by the Government, but
apparently, the product raised'lacks quality. There
is no guarantee that a man who grows good tobacco
in Australia will get a satisfactory price. As far as
area is concerned, I think that about five acres would
be enough for two men to handle. I suggest that a
discrimination should be made in the excise duties.
Eor the purpose, tobacco grown in Australia could be
divided into three categories. Its value, in the first
and second instance, would be determined by the retail
price of the manufactured article, and in the third,
a very low duty on locally grown tobacco when manu-
factured separately, irrespective of its value. The
excise would be adjusted accordingly. Such a plan
would induce competition and cause people to realize
that it would pay them to grow a good class smoking
tobacco, and not merely an indifferent article which
is used only to blend with imported tobacco.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Sydney.)
MONDAY, 28th APEIL, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones • Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens Mr. Tully.
(Mr. W. W. E. Swinso% representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited;
Mr. C. M. Slagg, representing the Australian
Tobacco Investigation; and Mr. C. J. Tregenna,
tobacco expert, Department of Agriculture, New
South Wales.)
George David Eoss, Under-Secretary, Department of
Agriculture, New South Wales, was called, sworn
and examined.
4649. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position ?—Since January, 1926.
4650. The object of the committee in asking you to
come before it is to supply its members with an out-
line of the work that has been carried out by the New
South Wales Department of Agriculture with regard
to the development and supervision of the tobacco in-
dustry in this State. Have you prepared any state-
ment?—l have prepared a brief statement which, I
think, clearly sets put the position in New South Wales.
Prior to the appointment of the Tobacco Investigation
Committee, officers of my department connected with
tobacco were engaged in furnishing advice to growers
in regard to the location, preparation and watering of
seed beds, the cultivation of the crop, the most suitable
varieties to plant, and also with regard to flue-curing
and grading. Certain experiments were instituted with
a view to improving the burning aroma by the addition
of artificial manures and various organic substances.
Experiments were also carried out in connexion with
the control of blue mould. These included the use of
practically all known fungicides. Seed was also ob-
tained from overseas and tested. In addition, experi-
ments have been carried out at Bathurst Experiment
Farm by utilizing sterilized soil and controlling the
temperature, moisture, and ventilation in frames
Since the appointment of the Tobacco Investigation
Committee the department has continued to give advice
along the lines indicated above, and has also carried
eut a certain amount of experimental work with the
object of improving the burning aroma, but handed
over the experimental work at Bathurst Farm to the


committee. The amounts expended annually by the
department during the past nine years are approxi-
mately as follows:
£ s. d.
1921-1922 .. .. 1,031 14 9
1922-1923 .. .. 1,148 18 1
1923-1924 . . . . 1,021 14 0
1924-1925 . . . . 1,017 3 6
1925-1926 . . . . 1,288 5 4
1926-1927 .. .. 1,047 15 1
1927-1928 . . . . 1,581 7 8
1928-1929 . . . . 1,726 3 7
1929-1030 .. 930 4 11
Total
10,793 6 11
The figures for 1929-1930 are, of course, for nine
months only; up to the 31st March.
4651. Can you say whether, prior to your present
appointment, the department had an established tobacco
organization?— The first tobacco expert was appointed
in Hew South Wales about 30 years ago. Mr. Tre-
genna was appointed about fourteen to fifteen years
ago.
4652. Did he succeed Mr. Howell?—There was a
gap during which no one was specifically employed
for the purpose. I cannot say exactly how long that
was. Mr. Tregenna was first employed about 1915.
4653. Do you think that the gap between the em-
ployment of Mr. Howell and Mr. Tregenna would be
eight years?— Yes.
4654. Was Mr. Howell a full-time tobacco expert?—
Yes, for about three to four years at the beginning of
the century . During the eight years’ interval to which
you have referred there was no departmental expert.
A Mr. Gornitski arrived from overseas, and engaged
in tobacco-growing -in the Murrumbidgee irrigation
area. He was not employed by the department, but
merely acted on his own initiative. He may have re-
ceived travelling expenses, but he received no salary
from the department.
4655. Was Mr. Tregenna always a full-time officer?
-Yes.
4656. What comprises the tobacco department of the
Hew South Wales Department of Agriculture?—At
the present time Mr. Tregenna is the only officer.
Until recently he had an assistant, a Mr. Kefford.
4657. So that for the greater part of the time Mr.
Tregenna has been the whole of the tobacco organiza-
tion of this State?— Yes.
4658. Had he any clerical staff?— Hone specifically
set aside for the purpose. If he needed clerical assist-
ance it was provided by the department.
4659. How long was Mr. Kefford employed by your
department?— For four or five years as a full-time
man. Prior to that he was employed by the Bathurst
Experimental Farm.
4660. Have you had any other assistants attached to
the tobacco expert?— Ho.
4661. Did you not once have a man named How r ell, a
son of the original Howell? —He was never on our
staff.
4662. Did you ever employ any field men to assist
the expert?— Ho. There has never really been any
necessity to do so.
4663. What steps has your department taken to
supervise the work of the tobacco expert? Has he
merely been a free lance attached to the department,
wdth power to do as he wished?—He has always re-
ported to the head of the department either verbally
or in writing as to his activities.
4664. He has been the head of his own depart-
ment ?—Yes.
4665. And the Agricultural Department has had no
means of checking his work other than through his own
reports?—l have visited some of the tobacco districts
in company with Mr. Tregenna, and have seen the
work that he carried out there. I presume that my
predecessor did the same.
4666. What districts did you visit?—l went to the
Tumut and Tamworth districts with Mr. Tregenna.
4667. Did you ever go to the Bathurst Experimental
Farm? —I have often been there.
4668. Since you have been Under-Secretary, have
you been satisfied that Mr. Tregenna has carried out
the work of investigation and development of the
tobacco industry in this State in a satisfactory manner
and to the best of his ability?— Yes. My department
is quite satisfied with him.
4669. Have any complaints reached your depart-
ment at any time about slackness in supervision or
apathy on the part of the department as to tobacco
culture generally?—l have heard complaints which
were, I think, directed more against the department’s
opinion with regard to Australian tobacco. As Mr.
Tregenna was the officer in charge, he naturally had to
bear the brunt of those complaints.
4670. Have any growers called on you to complain
about the apathy of the department in regard to tobacco
culture in Hew South Wales?— Ho. I cannot re-
member any occasion when a grower has complained
against the department.
4671. Did Mr. Parkes, president of the northern
growers, call on you?—l have discussed the matter on
several occasions with Mr. Parkes when he was in
Sydney.
4672. He has called on you?— Yes.
4673. Is it a fact that Mr. Parkes called on you to
complain about what he regarded as the hostile attitude
of Mr. Tregenna towards the Tamworth growers?—
Towards the Tamworth tobacco.
4674, Hot towards the growers?—l did not take it
to be so. It was more to the effect that Mr. Tre-
genna did not accept the view of Mr. Parkes as to the
value of the tobacco grown in the Tamworth district.
4675. Did he represent himself as having come on
behalf of the district organization ?—I received him as
president of the Tamworth Tobacco Growers Associa-
tion.
4676. I take it that Mr. Parkes put it to you that
the growers in that area were dissatisfied with Mr.
Tregenna’s attitude towards the quality of Tamworth
tobacco ?—-That is so.
4677. What reply did you make to him?—l do not
remember my reply, but I know that I had a long chat
with Mr. Tregenna following that visit.
4678. Was Mr. Tregenna present at that interview
with Mr. Parkes?—Ho. He was in the country at the
time.
4679. What was the outcome of your talk with Mr.
Tregenna?—lt was simply an endorsement of our
previous attitude; to try to bring about an improve-
ment in the quality of the tobacco grown in Hew South
W ales.
4680. Can you remember the exact complaint
lodged by Mr. Parkes ?—Our conversation was a very
general one. I cannot remember exactly its grounds.
4681. Did any growers from the north of Hew South
Wales call on you for the same purpose?—l am not
certain whether anybody else did. Mr. Parkes visited
me in Sydney on more than one occasion, and I have
an idea that at one time another grower accompanied
him.
4682. On each occasion was the tenure of his com-
plaints the same?— Very much the same.
4683. What view did you take of the whole thing.
Did you regard it as a hostile movement towards Mr.
Tregenna personally?—My view was that a grower was
dissatisfied because the quality of his Australian pro-
duct was not equal to that of America, and the depart-
ment had failed to bring about an improvement.


4684. Was there any suggestion that the real trouble
of the northern growers was that they regarded Mr.
Tregenna as being specially prejudiced against ttf
Tamworth tobacco district? —There may have been an
indication of that.
4685. Did they put any suggestion to you that Mr.
Tregenna had informed them repeatedly that he did
not think they could grow decent tobacco in the Tam-
worth district? —I know that he had informed them
very much to that effect.
4686. And after your interviews with him, did Mr.
Tregenna adhere to that attitude? —Yes.
4687. Did he give you any particular reason as to
why he should form that opinion?— Mr. Tregenna ex-
pressed his views with regard to the conditions existing
in the Tamworth district very plainly. He believes
that they do not lend themselves to the production of
the type of tobacco required—that is in view’ of our
existing knowledge.
4688. Did you take any steps to test Mr. Tregenna’s
attitude, to ascertain whether it was well founded.
You, as head of the department, had the responsibility
of not wasting any further time on a district which
your expert regarded as hopeless?— That is not exactly
the case. We considered that while the position may
appear to be more or less hopeless to-day, an addition
to our present knowledge might bring about an im-
provement.
4689. So you decided to persevere with the Tam-
worth district?— Yes.
4690. Did Mr. Tregenna ever give you any idea
about the possibilities of other districts?—l have dis-
cussed various districts in Hew South Wales wdth
him.
4691. Did he ever intimate to you that he regarded
Hew South Wales as a pretty hopeless proposition, so
far as tobacco production w r as concerned? —At times he
was not very cheerful on the subject. Haturally, dis-
appointments in the matter of results would tend to
make him feel that way, but I have always found that
when I discussed the matter with him with a view to
opening up fresh lines of thought and w r ork he was
prepared to take up his investigations again just as
eagerly as was any other officer.
4692. Do you not think that if your expert was
gradually getting himself into such a condition of mind
that he had no hope for the industry in this State you
should seriously have considered the advisability of
abolishing your tobacco department?—An officer can
express a view, and yet undertake investigational work
which may lead somewhere. Mr. Tregenna’s view was
held in the light of existing knowledge. That know-
ledge is being added to continuously, and fresh infor-
mation on the subject might bring about a change in
his views.
4693. I should imagine that, as head of your depart-
ment, you would want to see some result for the ex-
penditure that was being incurred. According to your
statement your expert never held out bright prospects
for the tobacco industry in Hew South Wales?— There
has been a definite improvement in the industry in
Hew South Wales as a result of the money expended.
Many years ago the tobacco produced was a dark
heavy leaf. That has been very considerably improved.
I have sufficient experience of a department such as
mine to realize that failure to obtain results over a
comparatively brief period of years does not mean that
success is impossible. Our experiments which seek to
eradicate the blow-fly have not met with extraordinary
success, and if we were to adopt the attitude suggested
we should now close down on those efforts and say
that the problem was insolvable. But one must con-
tinually seek fresh lines of investigation when en-
deavouring to solve a problem.
4694. So that I take it, in spite of Mr. Tregenna
having been in a more or less hopeless frame of mind,
he gave you sufficient encouragement to make you feel
justified in persevering with the investigations?—l
should hardly like to say that he was in a hopeless
frame of mind.
4695. Has there ever been any disagreement between
you and Mr. Tregenna as to the worth-while nature
of tobacco investigation generally?— Ho. We dis-
cussed matters freely and frankly, and I have always
found Mr. Tregenna only too willing to carry out any
investigations that might be suggested.
4696. Did you ever form an opinion that, for some
reason or other, there was a certain amount of antago-
nism existing between Mr. Tregenna and a number
of growers in the north of Hew South Wales?—l feel
quite sure that some such thing did exist. That was
one reason why Mr. Kefford was stationed in the Tam-
worth district.
4697. Were you satisfied with the results achieved
by him ?—Yes. He was there on instructional work.
4698. Why did he leave?—He resigned to take a
position at Bathurst, where his wife’s people lived. We
did not retrench him.
4699. Has there ever been a desire on the part of
your department to cut down on tobacco investigation
work?— Ho. I should like to see the problem solved,
and I think that it is worth while spending a con-
siderable amount of money on it. The thing is too
important to Australia to be side-tracked.
4700. You are satisfied that Mr. Tregenna has done
his very best to develqp the Hew South Wales tobacco
industry ?—Quite satisfied.
4701. Would not the improvement in the leaf be
largely due to the decision of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company some years ago not to buy sun-dried
leaf, but to concentrate on flue-cured leaf ?—That would
certainly bring about an improvement, but I am
satisfied that without the advice that Mr. Tregenna
gave to the growlers the improvement would not have
been effected.
4702. Has your department compiled any statistics
relating to tobacco production, giving the number of
growers and the value of the crops produced?— Those
statistics are prepared by the Government Statistician’s
Office, and are available.
. 4703. Has not your department filed that informa-
tion?— Yes; we obtain it from the Government
Statistician.
4704. Have you been kept in touch with the com-
mercial value of the work that has been going on from
year to year, the rise and fall of the area under pro-
duction, the value of the crop, ike. ?——X have received
those figures from time to time.
4705. Mr. Tregenna told the committee that in 1914
there were 1992 acres under tobacco production in Hew
South Wales, while at present there are only 800 acres
used for that purpose. Did you investigate that posi-
tion to ascertain the cause of the decline. I do not
indicate that Mr. Tregenna was responsible for it?—
It would be due to a number of causes. I assume that
blue mould was one of the big factors.
4706. Did you ever call for a report from Mr. Tre-
genna showing the reasons for the decline of the in-
dustry in Hew South Wales ?—I do not remember doing
so. I have discussed that phase with him on various
occasions.
1 4707. I shall refer you to the evidence given by Mr.
Tregenna. He was asked—
Do you consider that the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture is in any way responsible for the poor develop-
ment in the industry ?—No. I think it has done its best and
cannot do any more.
Do you subscribe to that opinion?— I think that the
department has done its best, but would not like to say
that it cannot do more.


4708. Mr. Tregeima was also asked —
Would you say that it is worth the department’s while to
continue in its attempts to improve the quality of the leaf? —
Personally, I say “No”, but my chiefs say “Yes”?—
You asked me whether any disagreement had occurred
between Mr. Tregenna and myself in that regard. I
say definitely there has not been any. While we may
have held different views, Mr. Tregenna honestly
attempted to assist to bring about an improvement.
4709. This question was also asked—
In spite of this report will you agree with Mr. Gepp when
he says that he holds the opinion that Australia can, and
will, supply all the tobacco that Australia requires? —It can-
not be done from New South Wales or Victoria; but it can
be done from Queensland. That remains true unless and until
the public taste changes back to the old dark tobacco.
You believe that in spite of the reports on the samples of
Australian tobacco sent away in 1901 and 1921 ?—I do. The
public taste has changed very much even since 1921. The
public are going in more and more for light and even neutral
tobacco.
Do you rule Victoria out at not being able to supply the
tobacco required ?—With the exception of Pornonal, I would
rule out Victoria and the whole of New South Wales.
How do you reconcile your opinion with the attitude of
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, who say they are
prepared to buy ten or fifteen times as much tobacco from
those two States as they have been able to get. The com-
pany makes no distinction between Victoria, New South
Wales, or any other part of Australia ?—I take it that the
company would not buy the tobacco if it could not use it.
By the Chairman. —Does that not indicate that there is a
future before the industry in Victoria and New South Wales?
■ —lt indicates that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
is a far better judge of tobacco than I am.
It indicates that there is a future demand for ten times
as much tobacco as is being produced to-day. Does not that
alter your opinion as to the quality of tobacco that can be
grown here ?—No.
That is the evidence that Mr. Tregenna gave only a
few months ago. He appears to consider that, in spite
of the work done by the Agricultural Departments of
New South Wales and Victoria, the improvement in
the leaf and the demand by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, which cannot be supplied, he still
maintains the opinion that the quality of the tobacco
grown in New South Wales and Victoria is not good
enough, and is not likely to be good enough?—l am of
the opinion that there is very definite room for im-
provement in the quality of the tobacco grown in New
South Wales, and that the demand for it would be very
much greater if that improvement could be brought
about. From my conversations with Mr. Tregenna,
I feel that he is a little dubious as to whether that
improvement can be effected.
4710. He was not dubious in the evidence? —I think
that he really was dubious. I consider that, in the
light of our existing knowledge on the subject, his
opinion is justified to some extent. Fortunately, our
existing knowledge does not stand still. A big field
of research has been opened for our tobacco as the
result of the Bathurst experiments. Nobody knows
where that will lead us. I think, personally, that the
matter is of so much importance to the State that we
cannot afford to cease to carry out the experiments.
4711. Is it a fact that Mr. Tregenna has handed in
his resignation to the department?—l have not seen it.
I do not think that he has.
4712. Has he not notified you that he has accepted
a position in Queensland as managing director of the
Queensland Planters Limited?—He has indicated to
me personally that he might leave us somewhere about
November next. But I have known officers to change
their minds, and I take very little notice of verbal in-
timations of that nature.
4713. So far as you know he is not leaving your
department?—l have not seen his resignation.
4714. But you understand that that is his intention?
—Yes.
4715. In his evidence Mr. Tregenna has been very
emphatic that he regards Queensland, in the of
present knowledge, as the only safe tobacco-growing
State in Australia. He now proposes to go there to
try out his own theory. Ho you not consider that that
chain of circumstances rather indicates that Mr. Tre-
genna has been hostile towards New South Wales
tobacco, in spite of the evidence that he and your de-
partment have collected that there was very much
greater ground for optimism?—l do not think so. Any
idea that he may have with regard to Queensland as a
tobacco area is of very recent origin. The complaints
made to me by Mr. Parkes must have been made a
good many years ago. Mr. Tregenna’s views with
regard to New South Wales have not changed very
materially. I do not think that he had any opinion
at all with regard to Queensland until the last eighteen
months or two years.
4716. In vietv of the fact that Mr. Tregenna has
committed himself to Queensland tobacco, by public
announcement, tvould that not prove to any reasonable
man that he has all along had a hostile view against
the future of New South Wales as a tobacco area? —
No. Mr. Tregenna has come to me on many occasions
in a worried condition of mind, endeavouring to bring
about an improvement in Nfew South Wales tobacco.
Notwithstanding any personal views he may have held
on the subject, he has always been anxious to effect
that improvement.
4717. Has be not conveyed the impression to you
that there is really no future for the industry in New
South Wales?—No; because, possibly, he knew my
opinion with regard to the matter.
4718. Do you think that there is a future for New
South Wales tobacco? —I think that the subject is so
important that we must endeavour to bring about an
improvement.
4719. Have you ever investigated individual results
to ascertain whether any grower in New South Wales
was delivering the goods?—l have seen a good many
samples from the various areas, some of which have
made me think. In some eases the leaf has been very
poor from the point of view of aroma, while in others
the samples have been very fine, particularly from
Chaffey Bros., Tamworth.
4720. That is the district about which Mr. Tre-
genua is not very optimistic?—He saw the same
samples. I know they gave me room for thought.
4721. Did you ever investigate the prices obtained
for leaf from the Tamworth district, and the reasons
for those prices?—l used to discuss that phase with
one of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
buyers many years ago, a Mr. Gilmour, but I have not
been in touch with any of the buyers of late years.
4722. Mr. Lough, one of % the company’s buyers, inti-
mated that a grower named Steinberg had produced 90
per cent, bright leaf last year, for which the company
paid. Would that not indicate that Mr. Tregenna did
not really go out of his way to prove the possibilities
of Tamworth ?—The solution of the future of the in-
dustry does not lie in the production of bright leaf.
4723. The company has told the committee that so
long as it gets the colour it will pay the prices, with-
out any regard to aroma ?—I look to the day when
we will not import any American leaf. To effect that
we must endeavour to bring about an improvement in
the burning aroma of our product.
4724. Are you any judge of aroma?—l smoke both
pipe and cigarettes.
4725. Have you tried any Australian tobacco? —Yes,
both from Bathurst and Tamworth.
'4726. What was its effect on you?—l do not like
Australian tobacco. I have smoked a little of it that
has been quite neutral, but I am sorry to say that,
generally speaking, I do not like it.
4727. Where were the samples made that you tried?
—I presume at the factory, with the ordinary pro-
cesses.


4728. Have you heard of the ageing and curing of
tobacco hy the manufacturers?— Yes.
4729. Do you consider that the highest grade Aus-
tralian tobacco would he a good deal better in its aroma
if it were aged a little more than it is at present?—l
could not say. That is a phase that could well be in-
vestigated.
4730. Dr. Cameron, Director of Agriculture in Vic-
toria, investigated the subject when in America, and
told the committee that the best classes of leaf over
there were aged at least four years before being put
into manufacture, whereas Australian bright leaf was
not aged at all?—I think that Mr, Slagg indicated to
me that results to date showed the very reverse result
in regard to Australian tobacco. I believe that he
told me that it did not improve with ageing. I make
that statement subject, to his confirmation.
4731. Apparently the blame has been placed upon
the growers, by the experts as well as the agricultural
departments, for the alleged bad aroma of Australian
tobacco. Do you not consider that if there is any basis
in that theory the manufacturers are just as mucfi at
fault as the growers ?—There is something that we do
not understand. The trouble may be due to the soil, or
possibly to the method of curing adopted by the manu-
facturers. The whole position has to be investigated
from all aspects in order to locate the source of the
trouble, and effect a cure.
4732. Do you consider that your department has any
hope of investigating problems from those angles,
taking into account its previous activities?—lf the de-
partment were to undertake the task it would have to
branch out on a very much wider basis than at pre-
sent. When the Tobacco Investigation Committee was
appointed my department practically stayed its hand.
4733. In what way?—lt was no use creating a
second organization to do the same work. There are
many problems involved in the matter that necessitate
the services of a scientific expert. I think that the
services of a bio-chemist are essential. We have never
had such assistance. It was only following on the
Bathurst experiments that this new field was opened up.
The Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee then
came into existence, and it was considered advisable to
leave the field to it rather than to inaugurate a second
organization.
4734. Did you not allow Mr. Tregenna to go over to
the investigations committee for a period?— Yes, and
we also agreed to Dr. Darnell-Smith going on the
investigations committee.
4735. Is Dr. Darnell-Smith an officer of your de-
partment?— Yes.
4736. Particularly associated with tobacco investi-
gations?—He was our biologist, and subsequently
became Director of the Botanical Gardens. He has
been associated with tobacco work for many years.
4737. Is he a salaried officer?— Yes.
4738. Would he not form part of the tobacco or-
ganization in the State?— Hardly. It would be diffi-
cult to indicate the actual expenditure involved
through utilizing his services for tobacco investigation
for part of the time. Our plant breeder has on more
than one occasion made an endeavour to produce a leaf
immune to blue mould. Such items are not charged
against tobacco investigation.
4739. Any services rendered by Dr, Darnell-Smith
to assist tobacco investigations would not be charged to
your tobacco department?—No, against his own bio-
logical branch. At all times he has been available for
the tobacco experimental work.
4740. Have you any knowledge of the allegation
that the fundamental fault in Australian tobacco was
the presence of a eucalyptus taint?—l read it in the
press.
4741, Did you discuss the theory with Mr. Tregenna
or Dr. Darnell-Smith ?—I discussed the experiments
carried out at Bathurst, out of which the statement
apparently arose.
4742. Could you give the committee the data of
those experiments?—l think they began in 1926, and
that they have not yet been completed. They were
handed over to the Tobacco Investigations Committee,
which is still carrying on the work.
4743. Your department really initiated the experi-
ments ?—Yes,
4744. Are you sure they are not yet completed?—
Yes. The department simply opened up a field of
investigation which is well worth while following.
Frankly, I do not know that anybody is in a position
to say where they will lead.
4745. Do you not think that, in view of the incom-
plete nature of the experiments, it was unwise to
broadcast a definite statement two years ago that the
real trouble had been located, and that the eucalypt
would have to be eradicated from existing tobacco
areas?—l do not believe in broadcasting anything until
it is proved. lam not sure that the theory was broad-
cast, although I am aware that it was given prominence
by a certain section of the press.
4746. You know that it was given prominence in the
Sydney Daily Telegraph, and that it gave rise to con-
siderable controversy?— Yes, which was most un-
fortunate.
4747. Did you take steps to ascertain the origin of
that broadcasting ?—The officers of my department
assured me that they were not responsible for it.
4748. Did you have a talk with Mr. Tregenna about
it?— Yes.
4749. Are you quite sure that whoever was respon-
sible, he was not?— Yes.
4750. We had evidence in Queensland from a Mr.
Pollock, senior instructor in agriculture, stationed in
North Queensland. He stated that in August, 1927,
he, Mr. Tregenna, and Mr. McGee, went to North
Queensland to investigate certain areas suitable for
tobacco, and that on that occasion those two gentlemen
discussed with him this eucalytus theory. He said
that a little later on, feeling that the theory was highly
attractive, he took it upon himself to make a statement
in the Townsville press to the effect that we were at
last on the track of the real trouble—eucalyptus taint.
That statement was broadcast -all over Australia, and
even in New Zealand, South Africa and the United
States of America, and it caused somewhat of a panic.
What are your comments ?—lt must be remembered
that officers of a department are allowed 10, and must,
discuss all kinds of theories, but usually every officer
realizes the undesirability of such theories leaking out.
4751. Would you say that Mr. Pollock was guilty of
an unfortunate lapse when he broadcast what he him-
self admitted was confidential information ?—lt was
unfortunate that he passed it out. It was probably
due to over-enthusiasm, or something of that nature. I
should imagine that he hardly realized where it would
lead.
4752. Did the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture take any steps to disabuse the minds of
growers as to the authenticity of that statement? —No.
As a rule, we find that if a controversy is opened up
on a subject it does more harm than if the thing is
allowed to die.
4753. Do you not think that, in view of the serious-
ness of the matter, all of the States should have con-
ferred in an endeavour to check the mischief?— Has it
done any harm?
4754. The committee was told in the tobacco areas
that the growers have taken a serious view of it?—
What effect has it had on the growers? Have they lost
any sales because of the statement?


4755. Here is one effect. The Pacific Tobacco In-
dustries Limited state in their prospectus —
What is the comparative quality of New Zealand tobacco?
New Zealand tobacco is very much superior to
Australian-grown, owing to the eucalyptus tree not growing
in New Zealand.
They are capitalizing the theory to the detriment of the
Australian industry. Have you been kept in touch
with the development of the experiments?— Yes.
4756. Right up to date?— Yes.
4757. Were you informed by Dr. Darnell-Smith that
at the end of the second year, when no further leaves
were added, the aroma was rather pleasant?— Yes.
4758. Have you had any results of the third year?—
Ho.
4759. In view of the second year results do you not
consider that some efforts should have been
made to enlighten the public on the matter ?
—Quite frankly, I do not consider that one
can judge on the results so far attained. It
takes a number of years to prove anything. The
fact that a statement on the subject has already been
made somewhat alters the position, and almost justifies
the promulgation of a counter statement, but I doubt
whether there is sufficient justification to make such a
statement on the second year’s results. That might
necessitate a broadcasting of the third year’s results,
which may be unfavorable. The only thing that
should engage our attention is the solution of the prob-
lem. I believe that in the course the Investigation
Committee will publish a report that will cover the
whole field.
4760. You do not endorse the action taken by any
person who prematurely discredits Australian tobacco
on the unproved eucalyptus theory?—l think that it is
regrettable that anything on the subject should have
appeared in the Australian press.
4761. Have you given any consideration to the part
that Hew South Wales will play in the continuation of
the investigation now being carried out by the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation Committee ?—My depart-
ment has not yet formed any definite plan. I prefer to
aw T ait the receipt of a communication from the federal
authorities indicating the lines on which they propose
to continue. When that is to hand my department will
be able to decide whether it will support a continua-
tion of federal activities, or embark upon its own
investigations.
4762. Have you not had sufficient information to
enable your department to conclude whether the State
or Federal Governments should continue the investiga-
tion? —I presume that the Federal Government will
report as to the advisability of future activities, and
I should like to see that report before committing my-
self in the matter. If federal investigations prove to
be satisfactory I am satisfied to see the federal authori-
ties continue the work.
4763. Do you think That the States would continue
to contribute towards the investigations?—l should
recommend to my Minister that that should be done,
and I do not anticipate any difficulty in that regard.
4764. Dr, Cameron of Victoria stated that the
federal investigations were leading nowhere; that they
were doing nothing more than the States had done, and
should be handed back to the States as previously. Do
you subscribe to that view?— Ho. It is lar too early
to condemn the federal efforts. They have Fad only
two years to carry out the work, and one must not
look for miracles in that time in connexion with such
a problem.
4765. In the event of Mr. Tregenna leaving the de-
partment in Hovember, will you find it an easy matter
to fill his place as tobacco expert?—l am certain that
it would be difficult to find his successor. I do not
know yet that I should recommend that his place be
filled. It will all depend on the developments that
arise in connexion with the federal organization.
4766. If you had any difficulty in securing a suit-
able man you probably would not recommend that the
position be filled?—ln all probability I might employ
an instructor to concentrate on cultural methods, leav-
ing the rest of the work to the federal organization.
4767. Mr. Tregenna came from South Africa. Would
you consider going to another country to secure an
expert?—l would prefer to have a local man.
4768. If you merely employed a field instructor, do
you think that the tobacco organization in Hew South
Wales would be of any real value to the growers?—ln
that event we should merely attend to instructional
work, and leave research work to the federal organiza-
tion.
4769. Do you consider that, if the federal authorities
decided to continue to employ a federal director, all
the States would need to have instructors? —Yes, to
provide for the field of operations to be sufficiently
covered.
4770. For the past ten years your expenditure on
tobacco culture has been about £l,lOO a year. Do
you consider that that is sufficient, in view of the
economic position of the industry in Hew South Wales?
—I consider that the industry in this State justifies a
greater expenditure, but I do not think that we as a
State department would be justified in any greater
expenditure if the federal organization is carrying out
the work. If that department dropped out we should
be justified in having a much more complete organiza-
tion for that purpose.
4771. Are you satisfied that the federal programme
is sufficiently wide?—l am satisfied with the work ac-
complished to date. It has proceeded along sound lines,
and development will come later. The federal
authorities have not yet submitted their programme
for the current year.
4772. By Mr. Morgan-. —What is your opinion on the
proposal advanced by a certain number of growers that
a bounty should be paid to foster the industry in Aus-
tralia ?—I am hardly in a position to express an opinion
on it.
4773. Do you think that the principle of bounty is
a good or a bad one? —I do not like the principle.
4774. Do you agree with the proposal to provide a
bounty in this case? —It is a matter that is deeper
than appears on the surface. I should like to in-
vestigate it more closely before venturing an opinion.
4775. It was investigated by the Tariff Board?—l
should not be prepared at this juncture to express an
opinion upon it, but I should like the position of the
growers to be secured by an improvement of the leaf
produced, which might be done if they received higher
prices for their product.
4776. An alternative proposal was put forward for
an increase in the duty on imported leaf and a de-
crease of excise duty on locally grown leaf. What is
your attitude on those two matters? —I think the duty
is already sufficiently high, from the point of view of
the consumer. The demand for Australian leaf de-
pends entirely upon its quality. Given satisfactory
quality the consumption will increase and we could
then look forward to the day when no American
tobacco tobacco would be imported into Australia.
4777. Do you consider that an increased duty is
not desirable?— Again I should prefer to see an im-
provement in the quality of the leaf to bring about the
desired results.
4778. What is your attitude on the excise matter.
The proposal has but put forward to the committee
that if a cut in the excise were made it would improve
the position of the growers by enabling them to obtain
an increased amount for their output. Do you think
that is feasible ?—lt would mean that the buyers would


be in a position to pay a higher price for Australian
leaf —assuming that the cut in the excise went to the
grower. If that could he arranged it would he satis-
factory, provided the payment applied only to high-
class leaf.
4779. How could you proportion the overplus to the
right grower seeing that the excise would be on the
manufactured article and not on raw leaf?— That is a
matter on which one would need to be conversant with
the details.
4780. The Tariff Board has recommended that the
excise should be cut, on the understanding that the
cut went to the grower and not to the buyer. Do you
foresee any difficulties in the way of that cut going to
the grower ?—I think that it should be easy to arrange.
It should be possible to base it on the quantity of Aus-
tralian leaf produced.
4781. Would it be right for me to assume that you
are in favour of a cut on the excise?—l think that it
would be more reasonable to expect help along those
lines than by way of the tariff.
4782. Are you aware of the arrangement that exists
between the Commonwealth Government and the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, in connexion
with subsidising research work?— Yes.
4783. Do you think it wise to continue that arrange-
ment? —I am quite certain that there is no justifica-
tion for any suspicion in the matter, therefore I wel-
come the arangement.
4784. By Mr. Jones. —I take it that you do not
agree with Mr. Tregenna’s evidence, which rules Hew
South Wales out as a possible place in which to pro-
duce Australian tobacco to suit the local palate? —I
believe that we should not accept such a decision, but
should continue our investigation work in the hope of
bringing about an improvement that will enable Hew
South Wales to hold its own with any other country.
4785. So that you differ with the opinion expressed
by Mr. Tregenna?—Yes.
4786. By the Chairman.—Do you ever have any con-
sultations with your Minister regarding the position
and the development of the tobacco industry in Hew
South Wales? —The personnel of the Ministry is fre-
quently changing. I have had consultations with
various Ministers on the subject, including the present
Minister. Previously we had Mr. Chaffey as Minister,
who knew the industry well.
4787. Have you ever considered a suggestion that
Mr. Tregenna should go to America to study the in-
dustry there at first hand, with a view to improving
the position in Hew South Wales?— That matter was
under consideration some five or six years ago, I think
in Mr. Valder’s regime. I am a little hazy why the
project was not proceeded with.
4788. Do you think that had he gone to America
he would have been of greater assistance to the industry
in Hew South Wales?—My attitude is that every
officer of a department would benefit by a trip abroad.
During my term of office I have arranged for many
officers to go overseas.
4789. By Mr. Snnnson. —l wish to correct a state-
ment regarding the production by Mr. Steinberg of 90
per cent, bright leaf. In his evidence Mr. Lough was
asked—
Do you agree with the statement made by the growers at
Wangaratta that they can now produce 60 per cent, of bright
leaf ?
and he replied—
Before they can produce that proportion of bright leaf
they will have to change their methods. I do not think that,
on the average, they are producing that pro-portion of bright
leaf. Some growers produce as much as 80 per cent, of bright
leaf. That has been done at Tamworth and in some Vic-
torian districts. From one farm at Tamworth I bought 41
bales of bright leaf and 34 bales of mahogany. Of those 34
bales of mahogany, 29 bales were high grade. There was
no dark leaf at all. I attribute those results to intelligent
culture.
4790. By Mr. Blagg. —l gather from your evidence
that your department is satisfied with the conduct of
the federal investigations to date ?—That is correct.
4791. You are satisfied that the direction has been
adequate and that the work has been carried out along
proper lines?— Yes.
4792. Am I also correct in assuming that should any
change take place in the present direction, your depart-
ment would consider the question in the light of those
changes before arriving at a definite judgment with
regard to its future activities?— That is so.
The witness withdrew.
Joseph Harold Walker, Federal Secretary, Federated
Tobacco Workers Union of Australasia, was called,
sworn and examined.
4793. By the Chairman. —How long have you held
your present position ?—Approximately for ten months.
On behalf of my association I submit the following
statement to the committee:—
We feel, in placing the view of our federation before the
select committee appointed to deal with the Australian leaf
industry, a full sense of responsibility which such an im-
portant question entails at the outset. We realize also that
the primary industries of this great Commonwealth should
be encouraged as far as possible. We desire that the fullest
protection and assistance should be given to the product from
which we earn our livelihood. It is our opinion that the long
view should be taken; that there is no short cut in the matter
of successfully establishing the tobacco industry in Australia so
that it may compete against the imported leaf, which com-
prises at present 95 per cent, of the tobacco smoked in Aus-
tralia. We shall endeavour to picture the effect which will
be brought about by any immediate increase of the percentage
of Australian-grown leaf in the tobaccoes at present manu-
factured in Australia. First, its effect on the wages of those
directly handling the Australian leaf and the piece-work con-
ditions. Although more is paid to piece-workers per lb. of
Australian stemmed leaf, they cannot, over a day’s work,
earn as much on that leaf as they can when dealing with
American leaf. That is due mainly to the smaller size of
the Australian leaf, which restricts the earning capacity of
the worker as compared with the imported product. Next,
the effect of the use of Australian leaf on employment. Not
being as good in quality as the imported leaf, the local pro-
duct does not produce a tobacco suitable to the Australian
taste. That is proved by the fact that for years there have
been marketed in Australia several brands manufactured en-
tirely from domestic leaf, wdiich are retailed 4s. per lb.
cheaper than the imported article, and still cannot find a ready
market. Again, there are lines made up of 50 per cent. Aus-
tralian and 50 per cent, imported leaf which have been sold
at a greatly reduced price in comparison with American
leaf, and which have not been any more successful than the
wdiolly Australian product. That indicates that the smoker,
who must be conceded to be the best judge, does not consider
the article w T orth the price charged. It is reasonable to
assume that if an increased proportion of Australian leaf
were forced on to the manufacturer, there would be less sales,
and consequently less employment. To emphasize the point,
we mention that Charles Arnell, Director of Messrs. Dudgeon
and Arnell, giving evidence before a commission upon the
tobacco industry in Victoria in 1894, stressed the fact that
his principal selling line was manufactured from imported
leaf. At that time the company employed 250 employees.
To-day, that concern is manufacturing a product which con-
sists of 90 per cent, of Australian tobacco. At present it is
employing only 37 employees. Coming to more recent years,
Mr. Dixon, Managing Director of the Dixon Tobacco Company,
which produced “ Yankee Doodle ” tobacco, at one time manu-
factured solely from Virginian leaf, introduced Australian-
grown leaf into “Yankee Doodle” and a decrease of sales
Immediately took place. Gradually that brand went out of
public favour and it is now practically unheard of. Through
that period of waning popularity the Australian worker em-
ployed in that industry was steadily forced into the ranks of
the unemployed, which proves conclusively in our opinion,
that the public determine the article that they desire.
We believe that it would be an injustice, and would
materially affect the worker in the Australian industry—who
is probably rearing a family, the members of which will be
the future citizens of this country—if the whole of the im-
ported leaf were shut out, or a serious curtailment of its
use came into operation, with the consequent substitution of
Australian leaf.
We believe that this select committee should impress upon
the growers of Australian tobacco the likelihood of their
bringing about the total extinction of the locally grown


article if they neglect to educate themselves as to the cultiva-
tion, curing and grading of their product. Persistently our
growers refuse to eliminate the dark and inferior leaf, which
the Australian smoker absolutely refuses to smoke, despite its
cheapness. That type of leaf has become a drug on the hands
of the manufacturers. It is essential that there should be
instituted a group of practical experts who should give their
undivided attention to the problem of discovering which States
and districts in Australia will grow a bright leaf suitable to
the palate of the Australian smoker, who, despite all that has
been said with regard to aroma and quality, is the sole judge.
We are quite satisfied that the time and money already spent
in investigation has been justified, and that eventually a suit-
able leaf will be grown within the Commonwealth. At the
same time we view with a good deal of anxiety the state-
ments of some of the witnesses who have appeared before this
committee, urging that a prohibitive tariff should be placed
on the imported leaf, as we realize that that would prejudice
the livelihood of the 5,300 members of our federation. The
choice of the smoker has changed from ping to fine cut
tobaccoes or cigarettes, and as those tobaccoes are all aromatic,
there has been a decided swing over to the bright leaf. We
have noticed with interest the decline of the importation of
dark leaf, and the corresponding increase of imported bright
leaf, also the enormous increase in the number of cigarettes
now consumed. It is quite clear that the problem before
the Australian groAvers is to produce a bright or lemon grade
tobacco and to eliminate all other grades, which are not
wanted by the smoker. If growers concentrated on an in-
creased output of bright flue-cured tobacco, ever endeavouring
to improve its qualities, they would eventually place before
the Australian smoker something that would capture and hold
his taste. The following remarks are taken from the ninth
report of the Imperial Economic Committee's report on
Empire tobacco;—
The chief requisite is a gradually increasing supply of
high quality, and to this end we believe producers'
organizations, carefully conducted and taking the long
view, can greatly contribute.
As employees of a large organization which handles practically
the whole of the Australian product, we deprecate and strongly
resent the implication that the manufacturing process could
be improved upon. Such statements would have the Australian
public believe that employer and employee are purposely dis-
honest Avhen manufacturing the Australian article. As
responsible officers w T e give the insinuation an emphatic
denial. We realize we are handling a commodity which en-
tails the exercise of the greatest care and needs considerable
experience. Particular care is given to the treatment of the
Australian leaf, owing to its dryness and frailty, and the
unsatisfactory methods of curing and grading Avhich occur
before it reaches the factory. It is our opinion that the
growers should concentrate upon producing quality and not
quantity. Outside of Itae Brothers and Eugene Kneebone, of
Victoria, and Messrs. Chaffey, Lye and Goodman, of New-
South Wales, the major portion of the tobacco grown in
Australia is of an inferior quality, and AAdiile groAvers
continue to state openly that they should reoeiA r e 2s. per lb.
for all tobacco grown, Australian tobacco will fail to reach
the proper standard.
Wc suggest that this select committee should recommend
to the Federal Parliament that licences to grow tobacco should
be issued only to qualified grorvers who have passed an
examination as to cultivation, curing and grading Australian
tobacco. There is room for vast improvement in the present
method of curing Australian leaf. Wc tender a statement
containing a formula for curing bright leaf, Avhich we com-
mend to the consideration of the committee.
We suggest that the Chinese grower of tobacco in this
country should be eliminated. Such groAvers disregard the
advice of the experts selected to control the industry, and
indulge in loav topping, which brings about a rank growth and
a heavier leaf, so producing a stronger and undesirable aroma.
It is impossible to indulge in low topping and produce high
quality thin cigarette leaf. The matter of suekering should
also receive the attention of the committee. If the suckers
are not removed the yield and quality of the main lea\ r es of
the plant will be loAvered. It is this tendency to include
suckers and frost-bitten leaf—Avhich frequently comes under
our notice when opening bales of the Australian product —■
which confirms our opinion that growers who resort to such
methods should be forced out of the industry, for the benefit
of the honest groAver who at least makes an endeavour to im-
prove the standard of his product.
In conclusion, vre strongly advocate the appointment of a
federal board of experienced experts, under the sole control
of the federal authorities. That would obviate State jealousy,
which is detrimental to the adAumcement of the Australian
industry. We consider that the board should be financed by
the Federal GoA r ernment. We urge that the accomplishment
of an improvement in the industry merits the very best con-
sideration, and requires the co-operatiA-e efforts of the Depart-
ments of Agriculture of the different States with the Aus-
tralian tobacco-groAvers, in conjunction with the suggested
federal board.
4794. —Does your organization include all of tlie Yio-
torian tobacco-workers? —Yes.
4793. So that it embraces practically all of the em-
ployees of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company ?
—Yes, the whole of the employees engaged in the manu-
facture of tobacco in Victoria and New South Wales.
4796. Am 1 to understand that your organization also
embraces the employees of Messrs. Dudgeon and Arnell ?
—Yes.
4797. Does it embrace the employees of Michelides,
in’Western Australia? —No, although we have a work-
ing agreement covering employees in that State.
4798. Have you been a tobacco-worker ? —Yes, since
1911.
4799. Have you personally handled Australian leaf?
—Yes.
4800. Do you consider that the Australian leaf does
not yield as much on wages, at piece-work rates, as
the imported article ?—I do.
4801. Are you referring to all qualities of Australian
leaf, or only to the dark variety?—To the majority of
4802. Are those who do stemming the only factory-
workers in the industry who are on piece-work rates?
—No. Stemmery-workers, those who cover the tobacco
and those who pack, operate on piece-work rates.
4803. Are they ail females? —No, there is a percen-
tage of male workers. The stemming is mainly done
by females, but we have a number of limbless soldiers
also doing that work.
4804. Have you tested by experiment the statement
that Australian leaf of all grades yields a lesser wage
to the piece-rate worker than the imported article?
—No, but I have done so by experience. It has been
found that employees suffer a decrease of 25 per cent,
when working on Australian, as against American
tobacco of all grades.
4805. How do you account for that?— Because it is
in bad condition. It practically has to be picked off
the stem. Two movements strip the American leaf
from the stem.
4806. Do you think that if the growers desisted from
producing dark leaf and concentrated on bright leaf
that that percentage of loss to the stemmers would de-
crease ?—Only where a better type of leaf came in. The
bright leaf gives the workers better results.
4807. Can I take it tliat the 25 per cent, loss applies
definitely to dark leaf?— Yes. I am prepared to go
so far as to say that with a greater percentage of
bright leaf there is a possibility of that being reduced.
4808. Has that not been proved in the factory. The
company has not bought dark leaf for some time?—lt
is still there, and will be there for some years to come.
4809. But the bright leaf that is now coming in in
great quantities must he producing greater results to
the stemmers? —I hope so, hut am not in a position to
give evidence on that phase because of the small per-
centage of bright leaf that has so far come in.
4810. Are you aware that the company is now buying
only a very small percentage of dark leaf? —That is
die company’s business. I understand that the company
has endeavoured to educate the grower to produce a
higher class of tobacco.
4811. Since the company decided to buy only a very
small proportion of dark leaf, and to concentrate on
bright leaf, the growers have made considerable efforts
to produce a better type during the past two years?—
1 have seen very little difference in the crops purchased
during the past twelve mouths. Some of the tobacco
Atas worse than ever.
4812. If you knew that the company was now
specially concentrating on bright leaf, and that the
growers were getting as high as 60 per cent, to 80 per
cent, bright leaf from their plots, would you consider


the outlook more hopeful from the point of view of the
factory-workers?—lf that quantity is being purchased
it is not coming into the factory.
4813. Is it not likely that the factory-workers are
handling a good deal of dark leaf that has been stored
up for a few years?— Yes, in so far as domestic leaf
is concerned.
4814. Will that not be reduced as time passes?—l
have seen a motor truck with a ten-ton capacity carry-
ing away ewt. after cwt. of dark tobacco, which I
understand was sold by the company at Id. a lb., to be
used as fertilizer.
4815. Would that not be Ho. 2 leaf, the rubbish?—
Some of that leaf has been taken in at Is. 6d. and
Is. 9d. per lb.
4816, Would it be leaf that was grown by Chinese?
—Some of it was grown by Europeans.
4817. The evidence placed before the committee in-
dicates that very few Chinese are now growing tobacco.
There are none in Victoria, and most of those in Hew
South Wales are growing on a share basis, and are not
curing the leaf. Where a few years ago there were
hundreds of Chinese growers, there are now only dozens.
Does that not give you a more optimistic outlook?
We should have a more hopeful outlook if Chinese
growers were prohibited from growing something that
is of advantage to the Australian industry. Yesterday
when looking through a bond of tobacco held for the
associated companies, I saw Chinese characters on
hundreds and hundreds of bales, bales that will never
come into the hands of our employees.
4818. Is that not old stuff?— Some of it had 1927
marks. I emphasize the fact that dark tobaccoes, which
the companies dispose of for incredibly low prices,
are a menace to our employees, because they are not
fit for human consumption.
4819. The committee is not defending that kind of
thing. We have evidence that the white growers are
endeavouring to improve their product. I have with
me tobacco which is termed “ dark mahogany,” from
the 1928 crop. Do manufacturers with any concern
for the industry put it in operation?— Similar leaf
was going into that 10-ton truck, being sold at Id.
per lb.
4820. You have stated that if the Australian industry
was protected and more local and less imported leaf
manufactured, there would be a heavy decline in smok-
ing which would cause some factories to go out of
existence?— That has been proved in the past.
4821. Do you not consider that if there is a steady
improvement in the Australia]) leaf, and an improve-
ment in the ageing process, the Australian public is
likely to cultivate a taste for local tobacco?—A very
long view would have to be taken. If such a scheme
were brought into operation with immature considera-
tion many of the members of my organization would
be forced into unemployment.
4822. Do you fear that rather than smoke Australian
tobacco of the quality with which you are familiar, a
good many Australians would give up smoking
altogether ?—I am confident that if the Australian
public were restricted to local tobacco of the quality
with which I am familiar, they would curtail their
smoking until the local article was brought up to the
proper standard.
4823. Members of the committee have smoked various
Australian tobaccoes, including some from Mareeba and
Pomonal, which they declare to be quite satisfactory?
—Do you always smoke Australian brands ?
4824. I cannot always get Australian brands, but I
prefer the cigarettes I have mentioned to Capstan’s,
The committee is hopeful that a large quantity of that
tobacco may be made available?— During the com-
mittee’s tour of the associated factories it was noticed
that you, Mr. Chairman, smoked an imported brand
called “Edge-worth.”
4825. I have given that up, not because I did not
like it, but because of its excessive price?—We have a
better tobacco in Australia than Edgeworth—Temple
Bar. Here is some Havelock, light cut. It will be
noticed that it has a percentage of dark Australian
tobacco in it which is easily perceptible.
4826. The choice of tobacco is surely a matter of
taste ? Last year, when I visited Dudgeon and Amelia
I was presented with a tin of “ Sunday Best.” Later
I was asked by a derelict, a man of 60 years of age,
for a pipe of tobacco, and I gave the tin to him. When
I next met him I offered him another tin of “ Sunday
Best and he refused it, although he was in a destitute
condition.
4827. Surely, if there is a steady improvement in the
quality of Australian leaf, and the manufacturer puts
more of the local product into the blend, the Australian
public will not notice the difference?— Unfortunately,
the public has already noticed the difference. There
has been a natural tendency on the part of the general
public to seek something better than the tobacco placed
on the Australian market. “ Havelock,” once popular,
has gone off. I contend that that is because of the
unaue amount of Australian tobacco that was put into
blend.
4828. Has not bright “Champion” a proportion of
Australian leaf in it ?—There is a slight amount in it.
4829. That is the best seller in Australia and the
public does not object to the Australian content.
Signet ” is a fifty-fifty mixture and quite a good
smoke. Waratah ”is an all-Australian tobacco and
very palatable. Do you not think that advertising
has much to do with the popularity of the tobacco?
ho, the whole thing is its suitability for the popular
palate.
• ColU P a f l y is now extensively advertising
Country Life cigarettes. Do you not consider
that that has had a good deal to do with the improved
sales?— There is a certain amount of truth in that.
At the same time, no matter how widely a company
advertised a tobacco with a "world-wide reputation, if it
did not meet with the desires of Australian tobacco
smokers it would not be purchased.
4831. But if you advertised a tobacco consistently
you would by that process discover the people who
liked it ? That is only an assumption. A few years
ago “Waratah,” “Signet” and other tobaccoes were
widely advertised. The result was negligible.
4832. Would you be surprised to learn that the com-
mittee has been informed that people have asked for
Waratah ” tobacco and could not get it because it was
not stocked by the store concerned ?—That proves con-
clusively that there is no demand for it.
4833. Does it not rather indicate that the basis of
success is advertising? We sell our labour, but we do
not spend one penny in advertising.
4804. That is a different proposition. Are you not
aware that Dudgeon and Arnell are in a comparatively
small way now; that they have been overwhelmed by
tne tremendous associated companies that operate under
the name of the Bmish-Australasian Tobacco Company.
Would that not have a good deal to do with the decline
of Dudgeon and Arnell’s activities ?—They have had the
same opportunities as the other companies. I have read
in the 1906 report on the nationalization of the Aus-
tralian tobacco industry that Mr. William Cameron
stated in evidence when he and his co-director Mr.
Hart approached Mr. Arnell to induce him to advertise
and place on the market the imported brands of tobacco.
At that time Mr. Arnell could not foresee the success of
such a policy and he refused to participate in the
scheme. The firm has declined because it failed to
grasp the opportunity when it presented itself Had L
taken advantage of the opportunity it could graduallv
have educated Australians to appreciate their own
tobacco.'
4835. Is it not proof that Dudgeon and Arnell cannot
possibly compete with an immensely powerful combine
irrespective of the tobaccoes that they support ?— lt will
be noticed that Dixon and Company, who manufactured
Yankee Boodle, one of the most popular tobaccoes in
Australia 20 years ago— when it was manufactured


from pure Virginian leaf—declined, because they mixed
Australian leaf in their product. The same applies to
other companies. Pipe smokers are going out of exist-
ence, and cigarette smokers now preponderate.
4836. Is there not still quite a considerable demand
for “Yankee Doodle ” in Hew Zealand?—l am not
familiar with Hew Zealand statistics.
4837, The Dixon Tobacco Company was absorbed by
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company?— After
their trade had fallen off and they were faced with
extinction.
4838. The future of “Yankee Doodle” then de-
pended upon the policy of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company?— The British-Australasian Tobacco
Company has put up a number of tobaccoes with almost
pure imported leaf.
4839. Do you think that the average tobacco smoker
would know whether his tobacco was American or Aus-
tralian?—l am confident that if you placed two pipes
on the table, one filled with Australian and the other
with American tobacco, covered them with a handker-
chief, called in a man from the street, and told him to
light first one and then the other, he would immediately
detect the Australian product and tell you that it was
“ crook.”
4840. The committee have had information to the
contrary. Is the average smoker capable of drawing
fine distinctions; is he in a position to say that this has
Australian leaf in it and that has American?—l have
given you my views on the subject. He would quickly
tell you that the Australian tobacco w T as not up to the
standard to which he was accustomed.
4841. Do you seriously contend that if there was Aus-
tralian leaf in one pipe he would immediately detect it ?
—Yes, because it would not suit his palate.
4842. We had evidence at Texas to the effect that
“ Gold Bar,” which w r as manufactured at Texas some
40 years ago was then the only tobacco that did not
burn the tongue. Is it not likely that people w r ould
develop a fancy for Australian leaf?—We hope that
that will take place when Australians grow a suitable
leaf.
4843. If the interests of the tobacco workers can be
safeguarded by the marketing of a local tobacco which
the people will smoke, I take it you would have no
objection?—We are anxious that the industry should
improve.
4844. You enumerated a number of growers and
stated that outside of them the major portion of the
Australian product was inferior. Do you not think that
that was a risky statement ?—Those men have received
the best price for tobacco, and they have sent into the
factories the only bright leaf which we considered suit-
able for high-class manufacture.
4845. By Mr. Martens. —Yet other growers have
received 3s. 6d. per lb. for high-grade leaf ?—That does
not say that it will go into high-class tobacco.
4846. By the Chairman. —Are you not aware that
the company buys on colour, and not aroma, so that the
growers can aim only at colour, and not smell?— The
buyer must have been colour-blind wdien he bought the
leaf that I now submit to the committee.
4847, He probably bought that in with a lot of good
stuff ?—That was bought with nine bales of tobacco that
came into a Victorian factory. The grower refused to
take it away, and said that he would take any price that
was offered for it.
4848. The committee has seen cases where similar
tobacco has been refused and the grower has stowed it
aside for twelve months. After that time he has re-sub-
mitted the leaf and obtained a reasonable price ?—Here
is another sample that indicates great care and atten-
tion, something of which Australians might be proud.
4849. Did you seriously wish to convey that the men
enumerated by you are the only growers of good tobacco
F. 218. —18
in Australia ?—There may be others, but those men have
produced the best Australian bright leaf that I have
seen.
4850. By Mr. Martens. —In your statement you say
that so long as growers openly state that they should
receive 2s. per lb. for all tobacco grown so long will the
Australian tobacco fail to reach the necessary standard.
Where did you get your information on that point?—
Prom newspaper reports.
4851. Growers have stated in evidence that if they
got good seasons they would be satisfied with 2s. per lb.,
but they do not claim that they could carry on always
with an all-round price of 2s. They could not do so if
a crop happened to be infected with blue mould.
Growers generally are satisfied that the tobacco buyer
should be the determining factor as to the type of leaf
to be grown. Why do you think the public should buy
“ Capstan ” cigarettes in preference to Australian ?
Immediately a person puts an Australian cigarette in
his mouth it gets him at the back of the throat and in
the eyes.
4852. Has the “ Capstan ” cigarette a particularly
good flavour ? —-It has the flavour and aroma that cap-
tivates the Australian palate.
4853. Are you not taking your present attitude more
because of fear of unemployment than anything else.
You would not be worried if you were assured that no
unemployment would result from the use of Australian
tobacco?—lf my federation was confident that Aus-
tralian tobacco would be equal to the standard of the
imported we should be pleased to see the local industry
prosper.
4854. “ "Waratah ” tobacco was put on the Australian
market some years ago. 4,000 lb. avas sold in one year,
and within the next tw y o years over 11,000 lb, was sold.
For some reason “Waratah” then disappeared, but
has recently conic back, and the committee is informed
that the sales are gradually increasing. What does that
suggest tn you?— That the cheaper form of production
is appealing to the unemployed section of the com-
munity. They have no money to buy the tobacco that
suits their palate, so they buy “ Waratah.” It is merely
an economical matter.
4855. By Mr. Morgan. —Are there any field workers
in your organization?—Ho; they come under the
Australian V orkers Union. We represent the manu-
facturing section.
4856. And you are making a deliberate plea for the
continuance of the importation of American leaf in
order to sustain the industry in Australia?— Yes, until
the Australian leaf becomes sufficiently good to induce
the public to purchase it,
4857. Do you think it wise to recommend that no
grower should be permitted to operate in Australia
until he passes a qualifying examination in cultivat-
ing tobacco?— That vitally concerns the improvement
of Australian tobacco.
4858, It does not apply to members of Parliament? —
feome of them could do with a certain amount of
tuition.
4859. By the Chairman. —What about the wheat-
growers s—They5—They have taken a keen interest in their
industry and have educated themselves in it by attend-
ing agricultural colleges and by employing scientific
methods, in an endeavour to improve the standard of
Australian wheat.
rr , 4860. There are no colleges for tobacco-growers?-
xhey have every facility to improve their knowledge.
I have seen cases where the sons of growers were placed
iii factories to widen their knowledge of the subject.
4861. By Mr. Morgan.— One of the requests sub-
mitted by growers for examination by this committee
is that a bounty be paid on Australian-grown leaf.
Do you think that that would be a wise policy to
pursue?— Already a bounty has been placed on Aus-
tralian-grown leaf, and Mr. Fraser, a member of Par-
liament, stated (definitely that where one to two thousand


acres of land were previously under cultivation, since
the subsidy was paid there are 8,000 acres under culti-
vation, and that the quality of the Australian leaf has
been lowered, because growers were turning out
quantity instead of quality. lam opposed to a bounty
unless it is granted under proper control, and also
provided that the grower should be licensed.
4862. There was an alternative request for an in-
creased duty on imported leaf and a decrease in the
excise duty on locally-grown leaf. What do you think
of a further increase in the import duty?— That would
penalize the Australian industry, because imported
leaf is the standard here to-day. It would overload the
Australian consumer.
4863. How would it affect the grower?—He is
already receiving sufficient protection.
4864. The proposal has been put to the committee
that if the excise were lessened the growing industry
would benefit. What have you to say to that?— The
amount of benefit would be so small to the grower that
it would be negligible. It is a matter for the financial
experts of the country. I do not think that the exist-
ing excise should be interfered with.
4865. You know that an agreement exists between
the Commonwealth, the States, and the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company to foster research work.
The fact that that company is a substantial contributor
to those operations has created suspicion, and some
contend that the whole financial obligation should be
the burden of the Australian Government. What is
your opinion?— That the Commonwealth Government
should bear the cost of the investigations.
4866. Do you think that the company should elimi-
nate itself merely because of public prejudice based on
false premises? —No, but it is the duty of the Govern-
ment to bear the cost if it desires to foster this in-
dustry.
4867. Do you think that the Australian Tobacco In-
vestigations Committee should continue its present
work or that the task should be taken over by the
States?—l support a continuance of the existing sys-
tem.
4868. By Mr. Martens. —You stated that wheat-
growers attended colleges to assist them to grow wheat
scientifically. What percentage of those growers
attend colleges?— They have the opportunity to attend
colleges.
4869. To what extent is the Australian wheat-grower
responsible for the improvement of our wheat? —The
farmer, by scientific investigation and absorption of
instruction, has overcome rust and other disabilities
in Australian wheat.
4870. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you imply that if those
engaged in the tobacco industry had followed a similar
process the tobacco industry would be on a relatively
higher basis than it now is? —Yes.
4871. By Mr. Martens. —To what extent have the
tobacco-growers been advised on the same lines as the
wheat-growers?— Mr. Slagg, a member of the Investi-
gations Committee, has intimated that if they had
followed the instructions of the experts a greater
amount of bright leaf would be grown to-day.
4872. Would it surprise you to learn that the advice
of the experts has been folloAved, and that it is generally
agreed that there has been a tremendous improvement
in the production of Australian leaf? —One of the Bae
brothers stated that his experience in tobacco-growing
was as great as that of any buyer, and that he con-
sidered himself as good an expert as the members of
the Investigations Committee.
4873. Are not the growers generally endeavouring to
do the very thing that you condemn them for not doing?
It . would' appear to me that they do not follow the
advice of the experts, as their product does not show
the improvement that one might expect from an ad-
herence to the instructions of the experts.
4874. What would you say if it were advanced as a
fact that bright mahogany had improved hy more than
100 per cent, of recent years?— The improvement of
bright mahogany is not a solution to our problem.
When that leaf is processed it immediately goes black
and is not acceptable to the Australian smoker.
4875. I referred specifically to bright mahogany be-
cause the buyers draw a definite line of distinction
between light and dark mahogany ?—Erom my point
of view it is like putting the sign of the cross on fish
and calling it meat.
4876. If they are carrying out the instructions that
they have received —and the evidence goes to prove
that —they cannot do more? —They cannot do more than
their limitations allow them to do. I believe that the
majority of the growers do not take the necessary
care. That is based on a practical experience extending
over 20 years.
4877. Do you contend that during the past two years
there has been no improvement in the class of tobacco
produced by Australian growers?— Not beyond the few
that I have specifically named.
4878. By Mr. Jones. —Are you an Australian ?—Yes,
and the father of seven Australian children.
4879. Is the committee to understand that the state-
ment you have made is the official and considered
opinion of the executive of your union?— That is cor-
rect.
4880. I presume that you are speaking mainly from
the point of view of the factory employees?—Yes.
4881. You understand that the growers also have
their point of view?— Yes.
4882. Do you consider that Bae Brothers have im-
proved their tobacco from year to year?— Yes.
4883. And are still improving their output?-—The
last that I saw, from the 1929 crop, showed an im-
provement.
4884. In his sworn evidence Mr. A. E. Bae stated
that the following were his average prices:—1921,
2s. 4d.; 1922, 2s. Ifd.; 1923, 2s. 2d.; 1924, Is. 9fd.;
1925, Is. 10|d.; 1926, Is. 7d.; 1927, Is. 10|d.; 1928,
Is. B|d.; 1929, Is. 9|d. Although his average price
has decreased from 2s. 4d. a lb. in 1921 to Is. 9|d. a
lb. in 1929 you contend that he has improved his
tobacco yearly?— Yes, in regard to brightness. Years
ago Bae Brothers catered for the popular taste by
growing dark tobaccoes.
4885. Were the prices quoted by you paid for the
same amount of tobacco each year? —No; for varying
amounts.
4886. Bae Brothers grew 4,000 lb. in 1921. Mr.
A. E. Bae was a very disappointed witness because
of the price that his concern was receiving for the
leaf. I have here a press clipping showing the profits
made by the British Tobacco Company (Aust.)
Limited. In 1921 they amounted to £582,979, and in
1929, £1,011,307, so that you will see that while the
growers’ prices are diminishing year by year the profits
of the tobacco company have doubled. Is it not
reasonable to assume that the company’s profits were
not made solely from Australian tobacco ?—I should be
curious to know whether the associated companies have
compiled a list showing the net profit received from
Australian and from imported tobaccoes.
4887. Would you like to see the £3,000,000 which
annually goes from Australia to America for tobacco
diverted to the pockets of the Australian growers?—
Decidedly, provided that the standard of the Aus-
tralian leaf was brought up to the requirements of our
smokers.


4888. We have had evidence that many smokers
desire to purchase Australian tobacco and are not able
to obtain it. What have you to say to that?-—lt is the
duty of the company’s representative to pass on in-
formation as to any such demand to his headquarters.
4889. This press cutting also states that the British-
Tobacco Company (Aust.) Limited amalgamated
the interests of W. D. & H. O. Wills (Aust.)
Limited, the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,
which combined the Cameron and part of the Dixon
businesses, the States Tobacco Company, and, later,
S. T. Leigh & Company. Do you not think that that
would be a reason for the decrease in the amount of
Australian tobacco manufactured?—No, the decrease
occurred because those companies put up a composite
instead of a purely imported leaf.
4890. Mr. Jennings, who was in charge of the big
experiment of the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany at Texas, and also in charge of the domestic leaf
operations of the company at Cooper-street, was asked
and answered this question—
Would you favour an increase in the import duty on
tobacco?—l would bump it well up.
What is your opinion?—l believe that the duty has
already been bumped well up. I should not be pre-
pared to bump it further while Australian leaf remains
at its present standard.
4891. Did I understand you to doubt that the Aus-
tralian growers could produce up to 60 per cent, of
bright tobacco?— Yes.
4892. The following questions and answers were put
to and received from Mr. A. E. Rae; —
Wbat was your percentage of bright leaf last year ?—About
60 per cent.
What was your average price for it? —The top price was
3s. 6d. a lb. for about 12 cwt. All the rest was under 2s,
and, therefore, we only received a bonus of 3d.
What are your comments ?—That proves conclusively
that the company’s buyers did not consider that the
average percentage of Rae Bros.’ leaf was bright.
4893. So that their leaf is evidently deteriorating?
—Certainly the crop as a whole. The tastes of the
smokers of the world have been revolutionized. The
prices obtaining in 1921 were influenced by the greater
demand at that time for dark leaf. Now bright leaf
is demanded and if a grower does not produce it he
must be prepared to accept low prices.
4894. The committee has abundant evidence to prove
that there is not sufficient bright leaf available?—l
believe that Rae Bros, have tried to improve their
leaf, but I am not in a position to say that they have
increased their production of bright leaf. I base my
remarks on the tobacco with which I come into contact
at the factory. Rae Bros, and Eugene Kneebone are
the only two who are putting in a satisfactory product.
4895. Are you aware that one of the biggest growers
in Victoria, MacNamara, has gone out of business?—
Yes; but MacNamara was not one of the biggest
growers.
4896. Do you know why he went out of the business?
—No.
4897. Mr. C. L. Bentley was asked—
Is your company prepared to buy in Victoria about 1,350,000
lb, annually, irrespective of its aroma? —Yes So
far the growers in that State 1 ave not been able to produce
that quantity, but only about 250,000 lb. of bright leaf.
Would you not admit that there is any amount of evi-
dence that the growers are not producing as much
bright leaf as the company is prepared to buy?— That
does not absolve the growers from making every effort
to produce a further quantity of bright leaf.
4898. Will you not admit that the growers are mak-
ing some, if not every, effort to increase their production
of bright leaf?—l have already stated that they are
making every effort to increase their quantity of bright
leaf.
4899. Is not the reason for a bigger percentage of
Australian leaf not being used the fact that growers
cannot produce sufficient bright leaf ?—The "whole thing
is ruled by quality.
4900. During the past few years the percentage of
Australian leaf used for blending purposes in Victoria
has decreased, whereas in Western Australia it has
increased from 7to 12 per cent, in one year?—l con-
sider that the Western Australian manufacturers are
taking a decided risk with their product.
4901. And Michelides is purchasing as much of that
leaf as the growers can produce. Would that alter
your view ?■—Until the growers are able to produce
the proper quality leaf, smokers should not be sacri-
ficed on their behalf.
4902. Is it not a fact that the small percentage of
Australian leaf used for blending is due to the fact
that growers cannot produce a sufficient quantity of it?
—That would have a bearing on the matter, but the
smoker has to be educated by a gradual increase of
the Australian product. There has been an ever-
increasing cry from our smokers that brands of tobacco
with which Australian leaf has been blended have
deteriorated in their smoking qualities.
4903. In evidence Mr. Jennings said that the Aus-
tralian tobacco has a distinct flavour, and there is no
reason why Australians should not come to like it.
Do you agree with that ?—That is merely the individual
opinion of one man.
4904. But he handled the domestic tobacco of the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company for some time.
Should his opinion not bear more weight than that
of the ordinary person ?—lt does not give him the right
to dictate to Australian smokers as to what they should
smoke.
4905. Considering your relative positions, do you
not think that his opinion should carry more weight
than yours ?—The opinion of neither of us would have
little weight in affecting public taste. The smokers
are the final arbiters.
4906. Whose opinion should carry the greater weight,
his or yours?— Perhaps in a paper controversy his
opinion might carry more weight, but the public are
the sole judges as to what they will purchase and smoke.
4907. You stated that if two pipes, one filled with
American, and the other with Australian tobacco, were
placed on the table you could immediately detect
the Australian from the imported product?— That is
correct.
4908. If a hand of American tobacco were mixed
up with five of six hands of Australian tobacco of
similar type, would you undertake to select the Ameri-
can?—l wish I were as sure of winning Tattersalls.
4909. I put the same question to Mr. Bentley and
he said that he would not like to be asked to do so?
—I could pick the American by my sense of smell,
even if I were blindfolded, and so could any operative
in the factory who had had a number of years’ ex-
perience.
4910. So that you must be a better judge than an
expert on the subject?—l merely state the opinion of
a humble operative in the industry.
4911. Mr. Jennings intimated that the Australian
public have been educated to smoke American tobacco,
but if they could not get it they could, without great
difficulty, be educated to smoke Australian tobacco.
What are your comments?—l do not think that that
is so, with the present standard of Australian pro-
duction.
4912. Mr. Jennings could see nothing objectionable
in Australian tobacco to prevent the public smoking
it?— That is merely an individual opinion.
4913, He was further asked—
Do you think that, allowing for the poor smoking qualities
of Australian tobacco, of which you have spoken, it would be


worth while taking the necessary steps to preserve that
£3,000,000 for distribution amongst Australian growers? —
iTes.
Do you agree?— Provided that the standard of Aus-
tralian tobacco is brought up to the present standard
of the imported article. It is essential that steps
should be taken to conserve money in a young country.
4914. Mr. Jennings was also asked—
Do you think that there is any hope of improving the
quality and increasing the quantity of Australian-grown leaf
to such an extent that the greater portion of the leaf manu-
factured here would be Australian-grown?
What is your answer to that?— Yes, There are vast
areas in Australia that have never been exploited for
tobacco-growing, I advocate that practical experts
should explore Australia in an endeavour to discover
and cultivate areas of Australian tobacco suitable to the
local palate.
4915. Mr. Jennings’ reply was “ Why should there
not?” If cigarettes were placed before you, would you
be able by smoking them or by any other test to pass
an opinion as to the percentage of Australian leaf that
they contained? —That would be impossible.
4916. If the mixture were fifty-fifty, could you de-
tect the Australian percentage and hazard an opinion
on the subject?— Ho.
4917. If 100 per cent. Australian cigarettes were
placed before you, could you detect that they were Aus-
tralian?— Yes, I have sampled one of the cigarettes
from Mareeba and one from Pomonal. The Pomona!
product is not up to the standard of the other.
4918. The secretary of the Pomonal tobacco-growers
stated that he preferred Pomonal cigarettes to any
imported?—He is entitled to his own opinion.
4919. The secretary of the Wangaratta growers said
that after smoking the Australian product he has con-
fined himself to it ?—To what extent were those cigar-
ettes specially prepared for testing purposes? If Aus-
tralia could produce cigarettes equal to the samples that
I tried to-day, our product would be better able to hold
the market.
4920. Would you agree to the recommendation of the
Tariff Board that the excise duty on Australian-grown
leaf be reduced by 6d. a lb., and that reduction passed
on to the growers in addition to the prices they now
receive, a guarantee to be obtained Horn the manufac-
turers that it would be done ?—Why should a small body
of tobacco-growers receive the benefit of a reduction of
excise duty at the expense of the rest of the community ?
The tax-payers would have to pay it to balance the
budget.
4921. Do I understand you to contend that of the
tobacco consumed in Australia 95 per cent, is imported
leaf ?—-Yes.
4922. The present excise duty on both Australian-
grown and imported leaf is 2s. 4d. a lb. If the scheme
that I have • mentioned were adopted, it would mean
that the imported tobacco would be affected by less than
2d. a lb. There would be no loss of revenue?— Would it
be to the interests of Australia to reduce that excise with
the present standard of Australian tobacco, and hand
that extra money to the growers of our poor-quality
leaf?
4923. Would it not stimulate the growth of a greater
quantity of bright leaf?—l would not be a party to
handing over that excise duty to the tobacco-growers of
Australia.
4924. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company
conducted an experiment at Texas some years ago on a
large scale, and failed. Would you grant a licence to
the company for the cultivation of tobacco?—l should
refuse to license those who grew the product at Texas,
and made a failure of their efforts.
4925. Are you aware that on some of the same land
at Texas a couple of young Italians comparatively new
to the game obtained 1,600 lb. from 7 acres of tobacco,
an average of about £232 an acre? —"What was the
standard of that tobacco?
4926. It realized an average of 2s. lOd. a lb.?—Was
it bought out of charity ?
4927. I take it that the company buys to manufac-
ture? —dSTot necessarily. I have seen hundredweights of
tobacco taken away in trucks, at Id. a lb. for fertil-
ization purposes; leaf that never reached the process of
manufacture.
4928. Do you mean to say that the company would
pay 2s. lOd. a lb. for leaf if it thought that it would not
be able to use it?—At the present time the position is
rather embarrassing to the company. This committee
is conducting its investigation, and if the company
refused to buy tobacco from a grower there would be an
outcry that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
was debarring Australian growers from earning a liveli-
hood.
4929. Would you give those two Italians a licence?—
I would give two Australian citizens a licence. I have
no time for importations.
4930. You seem to have a lot of time for imported
tobacco ?—That means my livelihood.
4931. I admire the ideal conditions under which the
employees of the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany work. Do you believe that your livelihood would
be prejudiced if the leaf manufactured by that com-
pany were Australian instead of American? —Yes, if
the present standard of Australian leaf persisted.
4932. Do you mean to say that if we cut out the
importation of American leaf Australians would refuse
to smoke the local article?— Absolutely. Tobacco is a
food which keeps the human body alive, and for which
men have a craving. Human beings will even go with-
out a feed in order to have a smoke, but they must have
a satisfactory article.
4933. I remind you of the evidence given by Mr.
Jennings, that there is no reason why Australians
should not be educated to smoke their own tobacco?—
That is merely pitting one opinion against another.
4934. The committee has evidence from a number of
witnesses that there is no reason why Australians
should not be educated to smoke the local article? —I
am confident that Australians would gradually limit
their smoking in an endeavour to spend what little they
had on the prohibited imported article.
4935. Would you have any objection to raising the
import duty so that those who persisted in smoking
imported tobacco would bear the extra cost?— That
would sacrifice the smoker lor the sake of the grower.
Tobacco is a luxury that is essential to the welfare of
the community, and if the importation of leaf were
blocked individuals would either not smoke at all, and
so cast the members of my federation into the street,
or they would obtain the imported article surrep-
titiously.
4936. I take it that you regard the matter solely
from the point of view of the employee?— And also as a
citizen.
4937. Do you regard the growers as citizens?—
Absolutely.
4938. By Mr. Morgan.- —Among the remedies sug-
gested by Mr. Jennings to overcome the existing dispro-
portion of Australian as against American leaf was the
absolute prohibition of imports, to force Australian
smokers to patronize the local article. What is your
idea ?—That is the biased view of a man who is not now
an employee of the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany.
4939. Excise is paid on the manufactured leaf. Sup-
posing that a lop off of excise occurred and an
endeavour was made to divert that lop-off to the grower,
how would it be done so that the growers of the better
class of tobacco would get the enhanced value?—lt
would be_ necessary for customs officers to trace the
tobacco right through from the growers until it was


manufactured, and mark each individual lot. I regard
the proposal as impracticable as the cost would be
greater than the benefit conferred.
4940. By Mr. Swinson. — When referring to Rae
Brothers, I take it your remarks concerned the quality
and not the quantity of bright leaf produced?— Yes.
4941. Is the bright leaf produced by that firm of
better quality than in previous years?— Yes.
4942. By Mr. Martens. — Do you handle all the bright
leaf produced by the growers ?—lt would not be
humanly possible to do so.
4943. To w T hat extent do you handle the bright leaf
that comes in from the different districts?—lt is my
duty to make inquiries as to the crops when they come
in.
4944. Are the employees -whom you question qualified
to express opinions as to the aroma and burning
qualities of the tobacco? —The majority of them have
had a lifelong experience in the industry.
4945. Do you of your own knowledge know that there
are not any growers other than those specified by you
producing satisfactory bright leaf?— There are others
who produce small parcels. I quoted those who turn
out the greater quantity.
4946. By Mr. Jones. —Can you see a sufficient
reason why Australia should not in the future grow' all
the tobacco needed for its own requirements?—l see no
reason why in years to come Australia should not pro-
duce a tobacco which the public of this country will be
educated to smoke.
The witness withdrew
Henry Walter Hinnes, tobacco worker, Covering
Department, British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany, and Vice-President of the Federated Tobacco
Workers Union of Australasia, was called, sworn
and examined.
4947. By Mr. Jones. —Do you wish to support the
statements of your secretary?— Yes. The additional
use of Australian tobacco can only take place if our
growers produce that class of leaf which is suitable
for blending. Unless our leaf has quality and aroma
approaching the American product the blending will
be detected by the smoker. I have handled and worked
all classes of Australian leaf for the past 30 years,
and during that period I have noticed that whenever
the company began to blend Australian with American
leaf the demand for that particular brand decreased. I
handle “Yankee Doodle” during its manufacture, and
I notice that it is only once in every couple of months
that the company makes a small parcel of it, of about
I,ooolb.
4948. Hove do you reconcile that statement with the
increased percentage of Australian tobacco in Western
Australia. There, the increase has been from 7 to
12 per cent, in one year, with no diminution of sales?
—I cannot give a straightout answer to that. Michelides
believes in plenty of blending. Possibly he drowns the
flavour of the Australian leaf with the other leaf that
he uses.
4949. So that his experience is different from that of
your company?—l do not know whether his sales have
increased or not.
4950. Do you contend that smokers in the east of
Australia are greater connoisseurs than those in the
west?— Hot necessarily.
4951. Do you admit that what is possible there is
also possible in Victoria?— Ho. The taste of the
smokers in Western Australia is inclined towards
American tobacco just as much as ever. It is possible
that the employees of the Western Australian com-
pany have urged smokers to support the local product,
and that the smokers have been loval to their comrades.
I know that the secretary of the tobacco workers em-
ployed by Michelides would urge smokers to patronize
the product of the local workers as against that of the
eastern States.
4952. Are those workers linked up with your union?
—The conditions obtaining in the west are entirely
different from those in the east.
4953. By Mr. Slagg. —How long have you been as-
sociated with the industry?— For over 40' years.
4954. So that you know a good deal about the quali-
ties of tobacco leaf?— Yes.
4955. Can you enumerate for the benefit of the com-
mittee those leaf qualities which you consider the
American product has, and which are lacking or not
fully developed in the Australian variety?— Australian
leaf does not contain potash, nicotine or gum.
4956. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you mean that those
qualities are non-existent, or relatively non-existent? —
They are non-existent in the leaf.
4957. By Mr. Slagg. —I refer more particularly to
the discernible qualities of the leaf, for instance its
texture?— The texture of the Australian leaf cannot be
compared with that of the American.
4958. Do you find the Australian leaf elastic?—lt
take hold of and endeavour to open it, whereas the
has no elasticity. It collapses the moment that you
American product can be handled satisfactorily.
4959. Do you find that the Australian leaf does not
hold its condition? —It dries up almost immediately.
To make it pliable it is necessary to use an undue
amount of water, which turns the bright leaf black.
If a good quantity of water is not added, it is im-
possible to handle the local leaf.
4960. Can you give any idea as to the relative size of
midriff in Australian leaf as compared with the im-
ported article?—lt is invariably found that the Aus-
tralian leaf has a thicker stem, which is hollow inside,
and of a furry nature. The American stem is solid
throughout.
4961. By Mr. Jones.— Do you favour the granting
of a bounty on Australian leaf? —Ho.
4962. Or an increased duty on the imported article?
Ho.
4963. Would you favour the abolition of excise duty
on Australian leaf?— Ho.
4964. Do you think that your fellow employees,
working under their present ideal conditions, would be
happier if they knew that all the leaf that they handled
was Australian grown?— Hot with the present stan-
dard of Australian leaf. They would be very unhappy
in the circumstances.
4965. Does that remark apply to the best leaf grown
in Australia? —Yes. Of recent years I have never
seen what can be called good Australian leaf.
4966. Have you seen any from Mareeba? —Ho.
4967. By Mr. Martens. — Have you seen any
Pomonal leaf? —Only what Mr. Walker has in his bag.
4968. By Mr. Tregenna. —Have you found that Aus-
tralian leaf is improved by ageing it ?—The longer you
keep Australian leaf the worse it gets. It withers
away to dust, as there is nothing in it to hold it
together.
4969. By the Chairman. —When you say that, have
you in mind its smoking qualities?—l maintain that
you cannot successfully age Australian leaf.
4970. It is being aged by the company now?— Yes,
I have seen a lot of it. Apparently it came through
the chopper. Ido not know what eventually becomes
of it.
4971. To what year’s crop are you referring?—l do
not know its year, but it was unfit for use.
5972. Does not the company re-condition some of
the leaf? —I am unable to say that. Ido not get the
leaf out of the shed.


4973. By Mr. Jones. —You heard this morning how
one of the experts was caught when endeavouring to
select Australian from American hands of tobacco? —
Yes.
4974. If you were blindfolded, would you be able to
detect an Australian from an American hand of
tobacco? —Yes, either by smell or feel.
4975. So that both you and Mr. Walker could beat
an expert in that respect?— The expert might have
more knowledge than I have, but no one is infallible.
If the aroma is not in the leaf it cannot be brought
out. I have handled a tremendous quantity of colonial
leaf, and that is how one discovers its true qualities—
when working it. This Australian leaf that I hold
has no more in it than a piece of tissue paper.
4976. By the Chairman. —ls that bright mahogany?
—lt is mahogany, but not bright mahogany.
4977. When you speak of the difficulties of getting
qualities out of the leaf, are you referring to this type
or to all classes of Australian tobacco?—To all classes.
4978. Even to the bright lemon?— Bright lemon is a
class apart. If growers would employ the proper soil
and grow bright lemon, more Australian tobacco would
be used, as it is suitable for blending.
4979. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company
is anxious to get bright mahogany?— That is their
business. Here is some Australian bright mahogany.
After handling it will turn dark.
4980. It appears to me that all tobacco at that stage
of manufacture has that dark colour. When it is moist
is becomes dark? —Here is a bright American filler
which has gone through the same process. It has re-
tained its light appearance.
4981. By Mr. Jones. —Do you say definitely that
you have never seen any good quality Australian leaf?
—Hot from a smoking point of view.
4982. You have not seen any Australian leaf good
enough for Australians to smoke?— Ho.
4983. By the Chairman. —Do you like the Mareeba
cigarettes?— Ho. I tried one and it burnt my throat
out. Here is some Australian dark mahogany. It will
be readily seen how impossible it is to blend it with
the imported article. I have only seen one bunch of
real lemon leaf grown in Australia. The grower could
not produce more if it. Here is some Australian
mahogany. It looks well, but when one begins to
process it, it turns dark.
The witness withdrew.
Sir George Alfred Julius, Kt., B.Sc., 8.E., Chairman
of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, was recalled and further examined.
4984. By the Chairman. —l understand that you
desire to give additional evidence to the committee?—
Since I last gave evidence to the committee certain
events have occurred which may be of interest to it.
I w T as not a member of the Tobacco Investigations
Executive when I last gave evidence, but I have since
taken Dr. Rivett’s place on that body. It was unani-
mously agreed by the executive that if the investigations
are to continue the activities of the executive could
with advantage be transferred to the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research. Questions have been
raised as to the likelihood of such work being pushed
forward if that transfer occurred. Tobacco work
differs altogether from the general work effected by
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
Funds for the general work are drawn under Com-
monwealth appropriation and activities are carried out
according to their public importance. If the tobacco
work continues it will have its own fund, and there is
no reason to suppose that the investigations will not be
actively pushed on. The position has very much im-
proved since I last gave evidence. Funds are now
available for the building of plant houses, and that has
relieved the council of a very great measure of its diffi-
culties.
4985. Are those buildings to be erected from the fund
that the federal executive is handling on behalf of the
Commonwealth, the States, and the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company?—Ho, from a separate fund. It is
necessary for the council to have a plant house for its
general work. Only a small percentage of that cost will
be charged against the tobacco fund, and a relatively
small charge against the funds of the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research, as the bulk of this money
is being provided by an outside source.
4986. Who constitutes the council directing these
scientific and industrial researches?—l am the Chair-
man, Dr. Rivett is the Deputy Chairman, and Dr.
Richardson is the third member. During Dr. Rivett’s
absence Sir David Orme Masson is an active member.
In addition to that we have a council which meets less
frequently, with a representative from each of the six
States.
498/. Do you think that if that body assumed con-
trol of the tobacco investigations it would be able to
direct the field experimental work now being carried
out by Mr. Slagg?—Yes.
4988. Would that not be outside its province?—Ho;
it is already doing a lot of field work in connexion with
its animal nutrition section.
# 4989. To what authority is the council finally respon-
sible?— The council is nominally under the Prime
Minister, but its work is looked after in detail by the
Vice-President of the Executive Council. It is left
alone largely in connexion with matters of detail.
4990. Are there any departmental officers supervising
the general work of the council?— Ho.
4991. Has the council any department of its own?—
It has its own headquarters men who look after the
clerical work. An inquiry was recently instituted by
the Public Service Commission as to whether changes
should or should not be made in the organization, and
the recommendation that went to the Prime Minister’s
Department was that the present arrangement was the
most efficient that could be devised.
4992. Do you consider that the council would be able
to work in with the States in a satisfactory manner if
the Australian Tobacco Investigations Committee were
abolished?— Yes. It is doing so at present on matters
of far greater economic importance than that of tobacco.
4993. By Mr. Martens.—Does, it experience any diffi-
culties?— Very little. In my previous evidence I
described the steps that were taken to overcome such
difficulties. The general finding is that any problem
of national significance that is affecting more than one
State, especially one needing fundamental research,
should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. Evidence
could be produced to show T that State Agricultural
Departments have asked the council to take over work
because there is no prospect of their departments being
able to undertake it.
4994. Dr. Cameron has changed his views?—lt must
have been very recently, because the council has
received suggestions from him regarding assistance
within the past few months.
4995. By the Chairman. —The committee does not
desire to see this work handed over to an intangible body
that will supersede the States and give them an excuse
to get right out of tobacco investigation?—l am
entirely in agreement with that. It would be the
greatest pity if a Commonwealth organization were
to be an excuse for lessening State effort.
4996. Do you think that the council could safeguard
the industry against that?—l do.


4997. Would you favour the appointment of a
Federal Director of Tobacco, to have full control of the
industry, including the field work, and to keep in touch
with the council in regard to scientific research?—To
keep in touch, if you like, but not so far as research was
concerned. What might be done from the point of
view of finding markets is another matter altogether.
4998. Would you favour the appointment of a field
officer to have charge of field work and the commercial
side of the business?— The commercial side, yes; but
not the field work at this stage.
4999. By Mr. Martens. —ln what way would the
council give expert advice and tuition to the growers
except through the medium mentioned by the chair-
man?—l do not think that we, as a scientific organiza-
tion, should take on that duty at all. It is not part of
our task to pass knowledge on the growers. I am in-
clined to think that the States should have their own
officers. Whether a federal officer, a State officer, or a
combination of both, it is something outside of the
concern of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research.
5000. By the Chairman.- —Ho State seems to know
precisely what the other States are doing, and
apparently they do not want to know. It would appear
to be necessary to have an officer who would be in a
position to carry on experimental and investigation
work in all the States, in consultation and co-operation
with the State department. Would you favour that?—
The probability is that you might want an authority of
such a nature.
5001. Under what department should such an officer
come?—l should say Markets, under the Minister.
5002. Of course the Council for Scientific and Indus-
trial Research could not take charge of him?— Ho.
5003. So that the Council would then merely be re-
sponsible to the Federal Government for the carrying
on of the scientific investigations?— Yes, and the field
work associated therewith.
5004. And the general direction of the industry, the
distribution of literature, propaganda and general
supervision of the field work might be entrusted to a
field officer directly under the Minister for Markets? —
Yes; except such field work as is required by research
workers.
5005. Mr. Slagg is in charge of field work at
Mareeba, in Victoria and in Western Australia, and
proposes to establish an experiment farm in the Tam-
worth district. Could the council effectively supervise
experimental work of that nature? —In most cases it
comes to a question of personality. It is difficult to
dissociate research work from field work. In another
division the officer in charge of scientific research is con-
trolling eight field stations between Queensland, Central
Australia and Western Australia. He is the chief of
the division of animal nutrition, and I am not at all
sure that we could not also control the tobacco field
work in the same way.
5006. Would it not be possible to have a separate field
man who would pass on instruction to the growers?—
It depends entirely upon the relationship between the
man and the council. The work of both might easily be
stultified unless some careful proposition were put up
to bring about intimate co-operation.
5007. The committee is concerned with the efficient
conduct of this field work, and hopes to see it consider-
ably amplified. We were wondering would it not be
better to appoint a federal director and make him
responsible for all the work. He would be placed at
the disposal of the council, and could carry out its
field 'work? —That might be workable if it were per-
fectly clearly arranged that that officer would be ex-
pected to do such field work for the council as its
scientific activities required. Otherwise we should
have to start off a parallel organization and do that
field work for ourselves, which would cause overlapping.
5008. If such an officer were placed directly under
the supervision of the Minister for Markets under those
conditions, would it bring about co-ordination of con-
trol?—l think the scheme has some promise; I shall
discuss it with the council.
5009. Do you think that the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company should be consulted by the council
before such a change of control took place?— U-
nquestionably.
5010. Have you formed any theory as to why the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company has taken no
active interest in this investigation work, but has merely
handed over the money to be expended?— That has not
been my experience.
5011. In evidence in Melbourne Mr. Fowler gave
the committee to understand that the company merely
handed over its cheques and made no inquiry as to
how the money was expended ?—I can quite understand
that. At the beginning the company discussed the con-
duct of the work with Mr. Gepp and myself and finally
were satisfied that it was in thoroughly good hands.
Apart altogether from that I have frequently been
questioned by the managing-director as to the conduct
of the work during the past few years. I know that
Mr. Gepp has also been questioned officially. Ido not
think that the company worried very much, as it
believed that the matter was in good hands. When it
comes to a change of control the company should be
consulted, as a definite agreement has been entered into.
5012. Do you consider that the company, having
proved its bona fides by advancing the money, takes no
further interest in the matter?— That is not my
feeling.
5013. Do you think that the company is in its own
wes keeping an eye on the progress of the work?—My
opinion is that the company is very definitely interested,
and believe that a well-considered effort should be
made to secure the kind of leaf required in Australia.
The time has arrived when consideration has to be
given to the second stage of the agreement. We have
reached the position when both parties have to decide
whether it is worth while carrying on the investigation,
and a progress report is being prepared to assist the
company in the matter.
5014. Supposing the company decides at the end of
the three-year period not to continue the investigations
further, so making it necessary for the Commonwealth
and States to shoulder the whole responsibility, do you
think that the expenditure could be greatly reduced?
—That is impossible to answer. The greatest portion
of the work is the field section. I am satisfied that
the scientific investigation will be more effective and less
costly in future than in the past, I think that a great
amount of the initial expenditure should not recur.
I understand that the committee has a large amount
of information which will be helpful in building for
the future. Just how far the federal officer may think
it necessary to go, and in what direction the field work
will proceed, must depend largely on the money avail-
able. I cannot help feeling that too great an effort has
been made in the past, and simultaneously, to see
whether tobacco can be grown from Western Aus-
tralia to Queensland. There are field stations in five
States, and I question the wisdom of that. It would
have been more efficient to concentrate on one or two
promising areas for the time being, and perhaps at
a later date to have spread to other territories. The
matter is complicated by the fact that each State is
contributing and wants something for its money.
5015. On the figures submitted to the committee in
Melbourne, there has been a definite concentration at
Mareeba. It has been shown that six times as much
money has been spent there than in all the rest of
Australia, apparently in an endeavour to prove that
that part of Queensland was satisfactory for tobacco
culture?— There are other field stations in Victoria,


New South Wales and Western Australia. Although
small they all cost money to run.
5016. Can you tell the committee how that concen-
tration took place at Mareeba?—No. I was not a mem-
ber of the executive at that time.
5017. Can you tell the committee whether the Federal
Executive has already sounded the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company with regard to this proposal to
change over the control?— Yes, unofficially. Mr. Gepp
and I were to have met the directors of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, but Mr. Gepp, un-
fortunately, was unable to fulfil the engagement. I met
the directors and the matter was fully discussed. _ So
far as I know they have not been approached officially
on the major question as to whether or not they are
prepared to go on with the investigation. The tobacco
executive carried a resolution that if it is decided by
both parties to carry on, the work will be transferred
to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.
If it is decided not to carry on after the exhaustion
of the present fund, the tobacco executive would remain
in existence to wind up affairs. That recommendation
has gone to the Minister, and the transfer should take
place on the Ist July next.
5018. Can you give the committee an assurance that
the present Federal Executive will continue to function
until our report is available?—l understand that the
committee’s report would be in before the Ist July.
5019. The committee does not wish to have its hands
forced ?—I am quite certain that if that view were put
to the Federal Executive it would be prepared to make
the transfer the Ist August.
5020. By Mr. Slagg. —One of the questions put to
you by the chairman dealt with the work now being
carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research and the implication was that the field work
and research work were in some w r ay separate. Can
you, as a member of the executive, make a statement
correcting that idea?—l did not take that meaning
from the chairman’s question. Under the Tobacco
Executive, on which there is a representative on the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, an
arrangement was made that Mr. Slagg. the Director of
the Tobacco Investigations, and Dr. Dickson, should
form a research committee, and up to the present they
have been working in collaboration on the conduct
of both research and field work.
5021. The research section being just as much a
function of the tobacco investigations as the field work,
it is impossible to separate them ?—That is what I feel.
There would be a very grave risk in separating them.
I think that it would be better to have one organization,
so far as the executive side of things is concerned, so
that there would be no divided authority. Under that
organization there could be such sections as would
adequately look after both aspects, the scientific work
on the one hand, and the field work on the other. I
should not like those remarks to apply to the much
wider question of propaganda, regulation and instruc-
tional work, which should be within, the province of the
State. That is a very important section of the work.
The witness withdrew.
George Wesley Saywell, Miner, Scarborough, South
Coast, New South Wales, was called, sworn and
examined.
5022. By the Chairman. —l believe that you have
some ideas to put before the committee ?—My object in
appearing before the committee is to advance for its
benefit what little knowledge I possess on the subject of
the tobacco industry. I was employed in the tobacco
manufacturing industry in Australia over a period of
twenty-five years. I was interested in the industry from
early boyhood, as my uncle was one of the pioneer
tobacco manufacturers in this State. As far back as the
fifties of last century there was, to my knowledge, a
factory in North Sydney. About the same time, or a
little later, tobacco was both grown and manufactured
in the Maitland and Dungog districts. In the sixties
there were several factories at work in Sydney. Among
others were Dixon, Penfold, McEncroe, and Saywell.
Those factories usually produced a blend of colonial
and American leaf. I have preserved the recipes of
some of my father’s most successful blends, and am
quite willing to place them at the disposal of the com-
mittee of inquiry. During the nineties quite a substan-
tial trade was done in this blend, and a considerable
amount of colonial leaf was produced and consumed.
The colour, of which a good deal is said to-day, did not
appear to have any marked effect on sale in those days,
so long as the quality was right. In those days cheap
tobacco, from 3s. Id. to 4s. 6d. per lb., yet of good
quality, was sold in Sydney by such people as O’Lough-
lan, the two Simmons (Michael and Daniel), Ruther
Saywell, Craig and Aitken, and many others.
Avith the coming of the tobacco combine the small fac-
tories closed down, and the use of the colonial leaf
declined. Among other reasons for the decreasing use
of the colonial leaf I desire to suggest: (a) Lack of
government encouragement, due, it has been said,
to the falling off in revenue on account of
the use of the colonial leaf; (&) the attitude
of the combine towards the local grower. In
early days the factories did their ow r n curing,
mellowing, and blending. The combine threw this task
on to the growers. In earlier days the growers merely
sorted the leaf into three grades, firsts, seconds, and
thirds. The combine, being a buyer in large quantities,
was not inclined to bother with the small growers, who
were scattered about the State. It suited it better to
import in bulk. I believe that the blends and costings
which I have to submit can still be produced at a pay-
able price and will still appeal to smokers as they did
in the nineties. I suggest that there is no reason why
steps should not be taken to compel manufacturers to
use at least a big proportion of Australian leaf in their
various blends.
5023. Did your uncle import very much leaf from
America and other countries?—A considerable amount
for blending and covering leaf.
5024. Was the bulk of the tobacco used by your
uncle Australian leaf ?—lt was principally a blended
tobacco, Australian and American leaf. Those Aus-
tralian employees who think that their wages will be
lowered if a greater use is made of the Australian pro-
duct are making an error. The wages paid to tobacco
workmen were much the same at the time of the
American Civil W^ar as they are nowi I have never
heard of the operatives getting a decrease,
5025. Are you a smoker ?—No.
5026. So that you are not able to say anything about
the smoking aroma of Australian tobacco?—My father
made himself a chimney pot. He always smoked the
bad tobaccoes. I asked him w 7 hy. He said that he
knew all about the good ones, and wanted to learn
something to improve the blends of the bad ones. In
those days the tobacco was mostly barn-cured and sun-
dried.
5027. Do you think that if the present Australian
bright mahogany had then been available your uncle
would have been able to turn out a high-class tobacco
suitable to the Australian palate?—Aly uncle always
turned out a high-class blended tobacco.
5028. Have you seen any of the present day bright
mahogany flue-cured leaf ?—I saw the leaf that was on
the table to-day, from a distance, and I heard the re-
marks concerning it. I think that some of it is weeks
younger than the remainder. It wmuld make perfectlv
good filler leaf. P y


5029. Do you think that the public taste has changed
for tobacco very considerably since your young days?—
Only with the ladies. In my day I have seen some
exquisite blends, with a basis of Turkish leaf, in the
proportion of about 1 lb. of the Turkish tobacco to 1
cwt. of Virginian. I came here to-day believing it to
be my duty to my country. I hope that we shall wipe
out the necessity to send this £3,000,000 a year to
America for imported tobacco.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Adelaide.)
MONDAY, 12th MAY, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones } Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens | Air. Tully.
(Mr. C. E. Lough, representing the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company; Air. C. M. Slagg, the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation; and Mr. E. A.
Hunt, the Tobacco-growers’ Association of South
Australia.)
Stephen Alick Cromer, employee of South Australian
Tobacco Company, 26 Osmond-street, Glenelg,
South Australia, w r as called, sworn and examined.
5030. By the Chairman .- —What position do you
occupy?— For twenty years I was factory manager for
the South Australian Tobacco Company. I have been
connected with the company for about 39 years, except
for a period of about six years when I was away tra-
velling. I resigned voluntarily to take up other -work
in Sydney apart from tobacco work. This, unfortu-
nately, fizzled out, and I had to return to South Aus-
tralia and take a lower position with the company. At
present I am demonstrating cigar manufacture at the
exhibition being held at Adelaide.
5031. Are you now representing the company before
this committee?— No. Mr. McNamara and I came
here to do what we could in the interests of the Aus-
tralian tobacco-growers.
5032. Ha.s your experience been confined to the
manufacturing side of the industry?— Yes; but I was
also a buyer for the South 'Australian company. I
consider myself rather an expert with regard to cigar
tobacco. I have bought both imported and Australian-
grown leaf.
5033. Is your company confined to South Australia?
—Yes. It has been carried on for over 50 years. In
the first place it was conducted under the name of
Dungey, Ralph and Company; but for sixteen years
it has been trading as the South Australian Tobacco
Company. The factory is situated at Hurtle-square,
Adelaide. It is purely a manufacturing concern.
5034. Is it associated in any way with the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, or with any other
company?— Not to my knowledge.
5035. Does it manufacture pipe tobacco, cigars, and
cigarettes?—At present only cigars. We make the
“ Senate ” brand. In the past the company has made
both plug and twist pipe tobacco. The brands made
were “ Excelsior,” “ Cavalier,” “ Panther,” and “Union
Twist.”
5036. Are all those tobaccoes off the market now?
5037. What brand of cigarettes did you make?—
“ Sweet Nell.” Much of the pipe tobacco was sold in
South Australia and Western Australia. The cigar-
ettes mostly sold in South Australia, and some
went to Victoria.
5038. They were not sold all over Australia?— Not
to my knowledge.
5039. How long since have they been off the market?
—About fifteen or sixteen years. It is nearly 25 years
since the name of the company was altered from
Dungey, Ralph and Company to the South Australian
Tobacco Company.
5040. Have you prepared a statement with regard
to cigar manufacture?— Yes. I sent this statement to
several members of Parliament, including the Minister
for Trade and Customs (Mr. Fenton), when the sub-
ject of an increased tariff on tobacco was under con-
sideration, soon after the last federal election. The
statement is as follows; —
In asking for a revision of the duties on cigar tobaccoes,
there are several points to be observed —
1. That the various tobaccoes used for blending in
cigar manufacture are not and can never be grown in
Australia, for the simple reason that the tobaccoes
grown in the various parts of the world are quite distinct
in flavour and aroma from each other. For instance,
Havana tobacco is quite distinct in aroma and flavour
from tobacco in any other part of the world and cannot
be reproduced anywhere else but in Havana; the same
applies to Sumatra, Java. America, and other countries.
Havana seed planted in Sumatra will become Sumatra in
flavour and aroma, and planted in Australia will become
Australian. Even if a suitable cigar tobacco is grown in
future in Australia, the tobaccoes from other countries
will still be needed for blending.
2. Suitable cigar tobacco is not being grown in Aus-
tralia at present. The only tobacco which has been used
for cigars is a tobacco grown in Queensland, flue-cured
for cigarette and aromatic tobacco, and is really unsuit-
able for cigars under the present system of curing.
Seeing that tobaccoes for blending purposes can never be
grown here, and that no cigar leaf is being grown at present,
we ask that the duties on unmanufactured tobaccoes be revised.
That a distinction be made between pipe and cigar tobaccoes.
There is at present a general duty on all tobaccoes of 3s. 2d.
per lb.; we ask that the duty be as follows: —Cigar tobacco,
2s. per lb.
A substantial increase on the present duty of imported
manufactured cigars which are made bv cheap Continental
labour would also greatly help the industry, which has been
languishing for some time, and enable us to produce a good
3d. cigar at a reasonable profit.
The question has been raised that cigar tobacco would be
imported bv manufacturers and used for pipe and cigarette
tobacco. This is not possible, as when cleared from bond it
would be specified for what purpose it -would be used and
would have to be shown on the excise returns.
It is my firm conviction that tobacco for cigar manufacture
can be grown in the tropical parts of Australia, viz., Northern
Queensland and Northern Territory. Queensland has pro-
duced some very fine-textured leaf which, if properly handled
and cured, could be used for making cigars, blended with thr
imported tobacco, say, 50 per cent, of each.
But the secret of success is in the proper curing of the leaf.
It took many years of experimenting to produce a good cigar
leaf in America, and the same applies to Australia. The
system of curing in America may be quite unsuitable for
Australia, and, in my opinion, an experimental farm should
be established, say, in Northern Queensland, under an expert
who thoroughly understands the class of tobacco required for
cigar manufacture. The growers should be encouraged, and
a central curing plant could be established on the experimental
farm to deal with the tobacco grown. It is a well-known fact
that, no mottcr what kind of seed is planted, it always pro-
duces a tobacco eventually which is essentially Australian in
flavour and aroma and quality, quite distinct from that of
any other country. But it rests entirely with the proper
fermentation and curing of the leaf to bring out this dis-
tinctive flavour. This has been neglected in Australia, as all
the tobacco I have handled in twenty years of buying has not
been properly cured. I am convinced that there is a great
future in store for Australia as regards tobacco. In all the
tobacco which I have handled, the chemical changes which
take place in the proper treatment of the tobacco, and which
bring out the flavour and aroma, have been sadly neglected.
And it is along these lines that success will be attained, and
until this result has been attained we ask for your help by a
reduction of the duty on cigar tobacco, to keep this important
industry from dying out.
5041. Are you making a request to the committee
on behalf of the cigar-making industry?— More on
behalf of the Cigar Makers Union.
5042. How many members has your union ?—About
ten or eleven.
5043. Are you a member of it?— Yes.


5044. Has the demand for cigars fallen off con-
siderably of late years?— Yes. When I first took on
the management, on the death of Mr. Timmins, the
cigar trade was in a bad way, our output being about
700,000 cigars per annum; hut it gradually increased
to 900,000 per annum. When I resigned about two
years ago the present slump began. Up to that time
we bad been turning out from 800,000 to 900,000
a year. Since tbe depression, tbe trade has fallen
to pieces.
5045. Do you consider that the smoking of cigars
is a barometer as to a community’s prosperity?— Not
altogether. The younger generation has lost the taste
for cigars. They have grown up with cigarettes in
their mouths, and it seems to me that the cigar-makers
will have to turn out a good smoke for, say, 3d. We
are now producing six excellent cheroots for Is. 3d.
They are made entirely of imported leaf and are put
out in handly little boxes. Our “ Senate ” brand is
similar to the “ Monopole Magnum ” in quality, and
sells at 6d. The slump in cigar smoking is probably
due to a great extent to the prices charged. We have
been making a good cigar at 3d. The falling off in
the local trade was due to big importations of manu-
factured cigars until very recently. That was the
cause of several hundreds of men employed in the
other States being thrown out of work. The cigar-
makers in this State have not had much more than
half time for two years.
5046. How many employees are there to-day in
Adelaide ?—About twenty.
5047. Have you had as many as 40?— Yes, more than
that.
5048. I suppose most of the employees would be
women?— Only those engaged in stripping and box-
making.
5049. Can you give information regarding the
capital of this company?— No. I produce a sample of
Australian-grown tobacco from North Queensland, but
I have seen much better samples than this from that
State. Personally, I am confident that in time this
tobacco will be cured sufficiently well to compete with
American seed tobacco.
5050. Did you ever hear of Mr. Nelson, of Mel-
bourne? —Yes. During my term as factory manager
I had samples submitted to me very often from Robert
Nelson, of Melbourne. Almost invariably he sent us
the samples and stated no price. The statement was
simply that the samples had been submitted to the
various manufacturers of Australia and that the highest
bidder would get the leaf. I do not know whether
that is fair and square business, but, in my opinion,
it was rather a peculiar way of doing business. When
I buy a tobacco I like to know the price, and then I
know exactly where I am.
5051. Do you mean that you expect the seller to
name the price?—l think so. Then I could accept
it or refuse it. For the manufacture of a cheap cigar
you want a cheap tobacco at a reasonable price, but if
a man says he has submitted samples to various manu-
facturers in Australia and has told them that the highest
bidder will get the tobacco, not knowing what the other
man is bidding, it is not doing justice to the growers.
I do not know whether he was working for the growers
or for himself. I do not know whether the growers
got the full price that we paid. If the growers got
a certain price, and Nelson was trying to get a higher
price for himself, it was detrimental to the interests
of the growers.
5052. Did you do much business with him?—l was
only the representative of my firm at that time. As I am
not representating them here I am unable to say.
5053. Do you think the public would be shocked
to know that ?—I cannot say.
5054. If you were making a good cigar from Aus-
tralian tobacco, I think it would be rather a wise move
to make it known?— Speaking personally, I think so,
too. With regard to Nelson, we often had to pay as
much as 2s. 6d. and 3s. a lb. for tobacco which was
not so good as leaf obtained for Is. overseas. If the
growers did not get that price they were being robbed,
but if they got it, well and good. It does not pay firms
to buy Australian tobacco at 3s. when they can get
Sumatra tobacco for 3s. 6d., including duty. You get
no refunds on Australian stems, and there is a lot of
stem in Australian tobacco. I have paid up to £1 Is.
per lb. for outside imported wrappers.
5055 Are you not aware that the main reason for
the non-use of Australian tobacco is that there is no
demand for it ?—One reason I found was that our
company had to pay nearly as much for Australian
tobacco as for the best imported leaf; not that good
Australian tobacco could not be grown here, but it
was not properly fermented.
5056. If the duties were altered would it make any
appreciable difference to the market?— Yes.
5057. Do you advertise this cigar that sells at 3d? —
No.
5068. Do you expect the public to know you have an
article that you do not advertise?—l am always con-
tending that the goods should be advertised.
5059. Do you advertise the “Senate” brand?— Not
much, but this cigar has been advertised more than
usual during the currency of the exhibition in
Adelaide. Through our little advertisements there,
more “Senates” have been sold recently than for a
good while. The small cheroots composed of imported
tobacco and selling at six for Is. 3d. are taking on like
hot cakes. My contention has always been that if a
cigar is properly advertised the public will ask for it.
That is why the “Monopole” and the “Matador” have
such a big sale. In my opinion advertising is the
soul of business.
5060. If there were a substantial increase in the
duty on imported manufactured cigars made by cheap
Continental labor, without any decrease in the present
duty on unmanufactured tobacco, would that help the
local industry?—l do not think so. Personally I
think that the present duties are right so far as the
manufacture of cigars is concerned. Even if we grow
a good Australian tobacco we cannot make a cigar en-
tirely of the tobacco; we require other leaf for blend-
ing purposes. In the “Senate” cigar we have a com-
bination of Sumatra, American seed and Havana. The
outside wrapper and the binder are of Sumatra leaf.
Smoking cigar made entirely of Sumatra tobacco
would be like swallowing an egg without salt. I con-
sider that Australian tobacco, when properly cured, will
he as good as American seed.
5061. I understand that the main point of your
evidence is that there is no immediate prospect of grow-
ing tobacco for blending purposes in Australia. You
consider that if an impetus is to be given to the cigar
making industry there must be a decrease in the duty
on unmanufactured leaf? —I think that the present
duty of 2s. 6d. a lb. is reasonable. The excise of 3d.
per lb. is right now.
5062. If the excise were wiped out altogether would
that help?— Yes; but, of course, imported tobacco will
always be used in all countries. I have great hopes for
cigar tobacco in northern Queensland and the Northern
Territory. Some time ago Mr. Holtze grew tobacco
in the Northern Territory and distributed among his
guests at a banquet some cigars made from the leaf.
The opinion expressed was that these cigars were as
good as any the guests had ever smoked. That proves


that there is great prejudice against Australian tobacco,
but our people are waking up and asking for their own
products. I have prepared the following satement: —
CURING AND FERMENTATION.
Although Australian tobacco has been successfully grown,
the curing and fermentation of the plant have been sadly
neglected. Most of the tobaccoes I have handled have been
only partially cured, and it is along these lines that success
will be attained. It took many years of experiment in
America to produce a good tobacco and the same will apply
to Australia. The American system of curing the leaf may
be quite unsuitable to Australia, and in my opinion, central
experimental curing sheds should be established, in those
districts where tobacco is mostly grown, under the supervision
of an expert who has a practical knowledge of the quality
of tobacco that should be grown, and who for obvious reasons,
should be an Australian born, who has the interests of his
country at heart.
For instance, in North Queensland, where excellent cigar
tobacco can be grown, it would be necessary to have a central
curing and fermentation shed, so that the tobacco could be
handled in large quantities as it is necessary for successful
fermentation to have at least 3,000 to 5,000 lbs. of tobacco
in each fermentation bulk or heap, in order to generate the
necessary heat to successfully cure the leaf. This should
also be supervised by an Australian expert who has had a
practical working knowledge of cigar leaf.
MANUFACTURE OF TOBACCO AND CIGARS.
In order to deal with the tobacco when cured, a central
factory should be established, either by private individuals or
the combined growers themselves, or under a subsidy from
the Government of Australia, but absolutely free from the
influence of any foreign trust or combine, for the manufacture
of the leaf into pipe smoking tobacco and cigars. Aus-
tralians at the present time are looking eagerly for their
own productions. During six weeks, at the Chamber of
Manufactures Exhibition being held in Adelaide just now,
where I am demonstrating cigar-making, I am repeatedly
asked, “Is this Australian tobacco?” I have been asked
whether it is possible to buy cigars made from Australian
leaf. Australians are looking for their own products and if
a factory were established on these lines, I am sure it would
be a great success.
5063. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you suggest a govern-
ment factory?— Ho. It could be run by private people
or the growers themselves, but I think that a factory of
some kind is necessary.
5064. What happened to the application to tbe
Minister for Trade and Customs for tariff considera-
tion ?—There may have been other applications from
persons interested in tbe trade. When tbe Bruce-Page
Government was in power tbe duty on unmanufactured
cigar tobacco was raised from 2s. 6d. to 3s. 2d. a lb.
Previously tbe excise bad been 2s. 6d. and 2s. Bd.,
which made ss. 2d. on every lb. of cigars manufactured
in Australia. Since then tbe duty on imported manu-
factured cigars has been made almost prohibitive. As
soon as the imported stocks are depleted this duty will
materially help tbe cigar industry in Australia, but
during the present depression we are not feeling tbe
benefit much.
5065. You are quite satisfied with tbe incidence of
tbe tariff so far as cigar leaf is concerned?— Yes.
5066. Speaking of the industry generally what do
you say on tbe subject of a bounty on Australian-grown
leaf?—Tbe growers should be encouraged to produce
good tobacco, but I do not know that I would like to
express an opinion oil the subject of a bounty. If tbe
tobacco were grown and cured properly it would com-
mand a good price.
5067. Then you are not in favour of a bounty?—l
would like to see the production of tobacco in Australia
go ahead.
5068. Do you think it would go ahead without a
bounty?—l do not quite understand under what con-
ditions pipe tobacco is sold.
5069. Tbe alternative request is for an increased
duty on imported leaf and a decrease in tbe excise duty
on locally grown leaf. What do you think of that? —
Tbat w r ould not hurt. Pipe tobacco is quite distinct
from cigar tobacco.
5070. Would it be fair to impose further burdens on
the consuming public?—Ho, I think they are paying
quite enough now for their smokes.
5071. Would you be prepared to recommend a fur-
ther cut in the excise duty ?—A reduction would be a
good thing.
5072. Would a cut of 6d. be justified?— Yes.
5073. Who should get the benefit of that? —The
grower.
5074. How could be be given it?—l suppose the only
way would be by means of a bounty. In my opinion,
steps should be taken to give tbe grower a cbance
to grow and cure bis tobacco in a way tbat would
ensure a good price.
5075. Would you not give bim a cut in excise, plus
a bounty?—lSTo. A cut in excise would belp tbe manu-
facturer more.
5076. How could your company convey back to tbe
grower a cut in excise?—l do not suppose it would.
5077. Is it not practically impossible to get tbe ad-
vantage of a cut in excise duty back to tbe grower?—
Tbat is so.
5078. An arrangement bas been entered into between
tbe Commonwealth Government and certain States with
tbe Britisb-Australasian Tobacco Company to provide
funds for experimentation to improve the production of
tobacco in Australia. Towards tbat work the com-
pany has contributed some £30,000. Do you think tbat
tbe arrangements in tbe best interests of tbe growers?
—Tbat is a difficult question to answer.
5079. It has been spoken of as an unholy alliance,
and it is said that tbe company is providing too great
a proportion of tbe funds?— Personally, I think tbat
the Government should be free from any outside
influence.
5080. Tbe allocation of the £30,000 contributed by
tbe company is entirely in tbe hands of the Govern-
ment. Do you think it would be a good thing to
eliminate the company and lose tbat £30,000 ?—I hardly
know what to say in reply to tbat question.
5081. By Mr. Jones. —Would you like the ground
for any possible suspicion to be removed?—l do not
know tbe conditions under which tbe company buys
its tobacco or bow much Australian leaf is used.
5082. By Mr. Morgan. —Should tbe Federal Govern-
ment continue to exercise control in tbe matter of ex-
perimentation, or should tbe control pass back to
the individual States?—Tbe Federal Government
should have control.
5083. What kind of wood is used in your cigar
boxes ?—lmported.
5084. Could not Australian timber be used?—We
have tried, but it is too expensive.
5085. Is Queensland red cedar too costly?— Yes. Tbe
wood used in tbe box produced containing “ Senate ”
cigars comes from Holland. When I was buying wood
during the late war I was charged about £32 10s. per
thousand for boxes made of Australian timber, although
w T e bad obtained beautifully finished wood previously
for £2l per thousand.
5086. By Mr. Martens. —Did you take tbe freight
into consideration?— With freight, duty and everything
included tbe price of tbe imported article was not
anywhere near tbe price we would have bad to pay
in Australia.
5087. By Mr. Morgan. —ls there no other wood
that you could use in Australia?—l do not know. I
think that most of tbe cost would be in the sawing.
5088. By Mr. Jones. —What is the number of bands
employed by your company?—ln tbe cigar department
from 20 to 22 in the factory alone.
5089. What is tbe greatest number you have ever
had ?—About 35. Tbe sample of tobacco produced was
grown in North Queensland, and compares favorably
in texture and appearance with American seed, but it
is not properly cured. In tbe curing of this tobacco


there is a chemical which is active in the spring. This
tobacco should be properly dried, and I think that the
fermentation process has been neglected. Throughout
my evidence I am speaking in general of leaf suitable
for cigar manufacture. I have had tobacco which was
flue-cured, and it was utterly unsuitable for making
cigars. Cigar tobacco should be cured gradually by
the atmosphere alone. At a certain time of the year
it is put into a big heap, and during that time there is a
chemical action and the leaf undergoes a change.
5090. Are you aware that the Tariff Board a few
years ago recommended a reduction in the excise on
Australian-grown leaf ?—Yes.
5091. Jt also recommended that if the reduction were
made it should be passed on to the grower, a guarantee
to be obtained from the manufacturers to that effect?
—I did not know that.
5092. In the event of it not being practicable to pass
that reduction on to the grower, do you favor a reduc-
tion in the excise on Australian-grown leaf, with a view
to making tobacco cheaper to the consumer?— Yes.
5093. Would that result in the growing oi: more
Australian tobacco?— Yes, the grower should be helped
in every possible way, and a reduction in the excise
would assist him, because it would enable the Aus-
tralian material to be manufactured more cheaply.
5094. If the excise on Australian leaf were abolished
or reduced considerably, would it be an inducement
to other firms to explore the possibilities of Australian
tobacco ?—Yes.
5095. By the Chairman. Have you anything further
to say?—ln my opinion the main items in tobacco-
growing are the curing and the fermentation.
5096. Have the growers had sufficient assistance
from the State Governments in those matters?— They
need all the assistance that can be given to them.
5097. Do you come into contact with the growers?
—Hot personally.
5098. From your knowledge of the leaf they produce
you consider they are not sufficiently instructed in the
proper methods of curing and fermentation?— That is
so.
5099. Are there any manufacturers of tobacco in
South Australia besides your company?— Hot to my
knowledge.
The witness withdrew.
Patrick McHamara, salesman, 289 Jeffcott-street,
Horth Adelaide, wras called, sworn and examined.
5100. By the Chairman. — Have you ever been a
tobacco-groAver ?—Ho.
5101. Have you ever been associated with the in-
dustry?— Yes, I was with the British-xiustralasian
Tobacco Company for eighteen years, and I knoAV every
phase of tobacco manufacture. I went through every
department from the bottom to the top. For seA r en
years I AA 7 as a superintendent and tra\ T elier in the em-
ploy of the South Australian Tobacco Company.
5102. Do you Avish to make a statement?—l intend
to speak purely on technical points in regard to manu-
facture. The principal factories operating in Australia
are the British-Australasian Tobacco Company and
Dudgeon and Arnell, of Melbourne. In my opinion
the secret of manufacturing good Australian tobacco
lies in the steam fermentation process. A small com-
pany in Melbourne is making a sample of Australian
tobacco, but it does not use steam fermentation and the
result is that it does not get the business. The sample
of “ Sunlight ” tobacco which I now exhibit to the
committee was manufactured in Sydney and treated
under steam fermentation. It consists AA T holly of Aus-
tralian leaf and it is the finest tobacco I have smoked.
It is certainly a dark tobacco, but the aromatic grade
also is good. The treatment by fermentation is one
of the secrets of the British-Australasian Tobacco Com-
pany. When this tobacco is put into the tank dipper
and the ingredients are added the flavour is excellent.
After going through the tank dipper the tobacco is
steam-dried and dried right out, and brought together
with the oils that are used by me. These comprise 25
minims each of oil of cassia and oil of rose geranium,
and 45 per cent, of rectiled spirits to make 3 ounces. I
shall show the committee a line of plug tobacco. If
the Australian leaf is properly and scientifically com-
pounded it will make a tobacco equal to any imported
article, provided steam fermentation is used. For
instance, if I were making Australian tobacco,
I Avould boom the liquids 12 degrees, and boom the
wrappers 5 degrees. I produce a sample of Aus-
tralian leaf grown in Queensland. If you burn a piece
of it you will notice what an excellent aroma it
possesses. If it were prepared scientifically in the
proper liquids, and finished with steam fermentation,
it would be equal to any imported tobacco on the
market. On that point I defy contradiction. A report
appeared in the press recently to the effect that the rib
in the Australian leaf was bad. This statement was
made by a twister named Hinnes, but I maintain that
there is nothing wrong with the rib in the sample of
Australian tobacco produced. It was grown by Geary
Brothers at Giru, Horth Queensland. You have just
seen me make a twist of that tobacco, and if I had the
machinery here I could manufacture a sample equal
to anything imported.
_ 5103. I think that Mr. Hinnes said it was difficult to
rib the leaf, and the previous witness, Mr. Walker, said
the stemming reduced the wages of the steamers by 25
per cent. They said it was a thick stem, and the workers
objected to handling it?— The workers were against it
from the start. I v/as in Melbourne after last
Christmas to see Dudgeon and Arnell. The workers
there tnought that I had come about the matter into
which this committee is now inquiring, and they did
not want to work Australian leaf.
5104, Is it because of the wages?— Ho.
5105. You do not agree with Mr. Walker’s statement
that the wages are reduced 25 per cent, on account of
the steins in Australian leaf ?—I cannot answer that. I
am speaking of Australian tobacco. I have manu-
factured thousands of pounds of it, and I have sold it
throughout the country.
5106. Have you ever heard a complaint regarding the
aroma ?—Hever.
5107. Have sales increased when you have pushed
Australian lines ?—There w r ere always good sales.
5108. Did you advertise them?— Ho. I had to go
out and push them.
5109. Would there be a bigger demand for Aus-
tralian tobacco if you advertised it?— Yes.
5110. What brands have you yourself smoked?—
“ Sunlight ” and “ Challenger.” They are on the
market here and are made by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company. I pay Is. 6d. for 4 ounces.
5111. Have you always been a smoker of Australian
tobacco?— Yes. I have smoked all sorts. I have used
“ Panther.”
5112. Has it an objectionable aroma?— Hone what-
ever.
5113. How does it compare with imported tobacco?—
I here is a bit of a twang in it, but by adopting the
steam fermentation process that could be eliminated.
5114. Yhat is this twang?—l should say it is salt-
petre. Some smokers say Australian tobacco burns
tongue, but that has not been my experience.
Provided the steam fermentation process is used Aus-
tralian leaf will neither burn the tongue nor make the
throat sore.
5115. Do you think that the manufacturers could
improve the aroma of the local leaf?— Yes.


5116. We have been told that if the aroma is not
in the tobacco before it leaves the barns it cannot
be put in afterwards in the factory?— Yes it can. The
British-Australasian Tobacco Company does that. If
I were making a batch of Australian tobacco I would
use 2 lb. of liquorice, 4 lb. of sugar, 6 oz. of gum,
1 lb. of glycerine, and a little carbonate of soda and
spice premento honey. These ingredients would be
boiled for eight hours. I -would take a boom with a
hydrometer and test the sweetness of the liquid. The
tobacco would be dipped in, put through the rollers
and steam fermented. This process would give one of
the finest samples of tobacco equal to the “ Sunlight ”
brand made by the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company.
5117. By Mr. Jones. —ls “ Belvidere ” on the market
in South Australia?— Yes.
5118. By the Chairman.— The British-Australasian
Tobacco Company states that its sales of Australian
tobacco are very small compared with those of imported
lines ?—lt does not advertise the Australian brands.
5119. It did advertise “Waratah?”—l could sell
tons of it.
5120. Does it burn your tongue?—-Ho. I know five
tobacco-workers who have worked with the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company for 30 years. They all
smoke Australian tobacco. One uses “Challenger,” and
another man who has had 40 years’ experience in the
trade smokes a dark twist made by the company. I
think that “ Signet ” is made from all-Australian leaf.
Anything manufactured by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company is good.
5121. By Mr. Jones . —-Are the Australian tobaccoes
sufficiently advertised?—lSTo. If “Sunday Best” were
made under steam fermentation no complaint would be
heard regarding it.- I advised Dudgeon and Arnell to
adopt steam fermentation, but they did not accept my
suggestion.
5122. What do you think of “Bronzewing?”—l do
not like it. In my opinion their tobaccoes arc too dry.
We used to make “ Cavalier ” in plug form in South
Australia. I tried to get some machinery, but it had all
been broken up. I reckon that the growers should start
a factory of their own.
5123. Can you say why the machinery was broken
up ?—Ho.
5124. By Mr. Slagg. —Do you wish to leave the
impression with the committee that any variety or any
kind of tobacco can be grown in Australia and made
into plug tobacco?-—Ho; it must be of good quality.
5125, There must be the proper variety and the
proper grade for certain purposes?— Yes.
5126. By Mr. Jones. —Do you think that more Aus-
tralian tobacco would be used if it were more exten-
sively advertised? —Yes, When employed by the
Tobacco Company of South Australia I went out on an
advertising tour of Union dark and bright twists for
the Tobacco Workers’ Union. We went among the
different unions to encourage the smoking of hand-made
bright twist, and sold thousands of pounds of it. It
was a Virginian and dark American leaf; we were not
using Australian leaf at the time. By going among the
consumers we increased the sale.
5127. By the Chairman. —Could you boost
“Waratah” on its merits? —Yes, I could sell anything
made by the British-xVustralasian Tobacco Company,
but I could not sell any of the other stuff unless I
improved it.
5128. Did you find that your sales decreased .if the
people were left free to choose for themselves?— Ho.
We started with about six employees in 1906, and
finished up with about 60 in about 1911 or 1912.
5129. By Mr. Slagg. —Was this sample of Australian
leaf grown by Geary Bros, near Townsville submitted
to you for testing purposes?—It was sent over to the
factory by mistake with some cigar leaf that had been
submitted for a test. We discovered that it was pipe
tobacco leaf.
5130. Are you aware that it is not hue-cured?—l
was not aware of that.
5131. Do you know that the aroma of this tobacco
is similar to that of cigar leaf ? —lt is something like it.
The witness withdrew.
Albert Lawrence Benda, commission agent, 59 Marl-
borough-street, Malvern, South Australia, was
called, sworn, and examined.
5132. By the Chairman. —Are you associated in any
way with the tobacco industry?—lSTo.
5133. What information do you desire to give?—l
am not a tobacco-grower, but I have been experimenting
in the Barossa district at ISTuriootpa, about 50 miles
north-east of Adelaide. I have had experimental plots,
and I have tried several varieties. About four years
ago the varieties included Lizard Tail, Conquerer,
Spotted Gum and Yellow Pryor, and, of the four, I
found that the best in that district was Yellow Pryor.
My object was to see if tobacco could be grown at all,
and to find out the best variety for the district. I was
prompted in this work, not by mercenary but patriotic
motives. The samples of leaf produced are both Yellow
Pryor. One is sun-cured and the other is air and flue-
cured. Some of my tobacco went to Mr. Slagg, but I
never heard what the result was. I received a postal
not for 25., but no information concerning the quality
of the tobacco forwarded.
5134. Yon sent to the Federal Investigation Com-
mittee two year ago, three-fourths of a pound of leaf
that had been sun-cured by you. You received a postal
note for 2s. from the committee, but no further informa-
tion as to what was thought of the leaf or what had
been done with it?— That is so.
5135. Did you communicate with the committee
further?— Ho.
5136. Did you pursue your experiments?— Yes. I
sent to you a plug of tobacco that I had manufactured
myself. I obtained the information enabling me to
make it through reading books.
5137. Did you put any ingredients into the article?—
Yes. I used a hand press although I understand that
there should be a pressure of 350 tons.
5138. Did you try the tobacco yourself?— Yes. I
could not smoke it. Mr. Golian, the chief excise Officer
here, told me that he could smoke it, and I informed him
that he was a hero. The only fault with the tobacco
it that it had never been fermented, otherwise its qual-
ity would be good.
5139. Do you ever grow cigar leaf?— Ho. I do not
think it can be grown south of Oodnadatta.
5140. When you refer to lack of fermentation, -what
do you mean?—lt is necessary to get the rankness out
of the leaf.
5141. Did you communicate with the Department of
Agriculture about your experiments?— Yes.
514 ! 2. Did it take an interest in your work?— Yes.
Mr. Opie saw my experimental plot at Huriootpa. I
gave my plants about half a pint of water each when
they were put in, but I did not water them again. They
were planted out in Hovember and the -weather was
fairly favorable. The ground was not cultivated in
any way afterwards until I picked the leaves.
5143. Have you anything to add to your evidence?—
At one of your meetings Mr. J. H. Walker said that
the Australian leaf is inferior. 1 say that it is not,
but that it has a different flavour to which smokers
would become accustomed if imported tobacco were
not available. Mr. Walker also said that the use of
Australian tobacco would cause a falling-off of 50 per


cent, in the amount of smoking. That is nonsense. If
smokers could obtain nothing else, I believe they would
use tea-leaves. Then the witness went on to say that
only four growers, whom he named, and perhaps a few
others, were producing first grade leaf. If four can do
that, why cannot 40? Then, again, Mr. Ninnes said
that the main rib was thick and hollow. I invite mem-
bers of the committee to try the samples I have pro-
duced. You will note the ribs are quite solid and yet
thin. My opinion is that the soil at Nuriootpa is ideal
for tobacco culture. It consists of 7or 8 inches of sand,
with a deep clay bottom. The soil is poor.
5144. By Mr. Morgan. —A number of growers in
different parts of Australia have suggested that one of
the main factors in securing an impetus to the develop-
ment of the industry would be the provision of a bounty
on Australian-grown leaf? —I have never favoured
bounties. The wine bounty, for instance, was made
for the growers and not for the wine makers, but the
result was that the growers got 3d. and the wine
makers 3s. 9d. per gallon. It seems to me that the
primary producer never gets the benefit.
5145. As an alternative proposal, other growers have
suggested an increase in the import duty and a decrease
in the excise?—l w T ould favour an increase in the im-
port duty.
5146. To the extent of a prohibitive import duty?—
Not prohibitive. I am referring only to pipe and
cigarette tobacco. I do not think we ought to decrease
that excise duty.
5147. Then you would not favour an absolutely pro-
hibitive import duty to secure your ends?— No. Only
a few people would still be able to smoke imported
tobacco. I think the best policy for a few years would
be to put on a much higher import duty. Smokers
would not pay Is. or more an ounce for imported to-
bacco and they would get used to the quality of Aus-
tralian tobacco that could be retailed at 9d. an ounce.
5148. Do you recommend abolition of the excise
duty?— That does not seem to be a hindrance to the
industry. “ Sunlight ” brand, which sells at 6s. a lb,,
seems to be made from offal. I think that tobacco that
is made from the best leaf in Australia could easily be
sold at about 9d. an ounce, and that would not he
a prohibitive price, but Is. 3d. per ounce would be pro-
hibitive.
5149. Are you in favor of continuation of the present
arrangement made between certain States and the
Federal Government for the investigation into the in-
dustry?— Yes.
5150. You would not interfere in any way with the
present arrangement?—So far as I understand it, no.
5151. It has been proposed in certain quarters, mostly
by experts, that the tobacco research work now being
done under the direction of the Federal Tobacco Inves-
tigation Committee should be abandoned and should
revert to the different States ?—lt seems to me that the
Commonwealth Government should take control of the
investigation.
5152. By Mr. Jones. —Would you be prepared to
increase the import duty so that those persons who in-
sist on smoking imported tobacco would be penalised?
—Yes, The great majority would then smoke Austra-
lian tobacco, and that would help the industry.
5153. By Mr. Morgan. —You could achieve that ob-
ject by prohibition ?—I would not be so severe as that,
but if the quality of Australian tobacco generally were
good, that result might be obtained. I am a great
believer in sun-cured leaf. My father, who had 50
years’ experience of tobacco, contended that sun-dried
Virginian tobacco was the best in the world. In my
opinion the sun-dried leaf produced, is superior to the
sample that was finished off in the flue. My father
was the first man in Australia to put out flake-cut
tobacco.
5154. By Mr. Slagg. —Are you aware that flue-cured
tobacco is not fermented?—l was not aware of it.
5155. Would you like to alter your statement that
your plug was not good because it was not properly
fermented ?—One of the samples produced was all sun-
dried.
5156. Are you aware that most of the types of to-
bacco used for pipe smoking and cigarettes are not
fermented?— No.
5157. Only a very few types used for that purpose
require fermentation and they are not used to any ex-
tent in Australia. With regard to the sample which
was sent to the Investigation Committee, for whicn
you received 25., did you ever ask Mr. Opie about it ?
I do not remember.
The witness withdrew.
Albert William Gordon, farmer, Paris Creek, South
Australia, was called, sworn and examined.
5158. By the Chairman. —Are you a tobacco-
growsr?—Yes.
5159. Are you a member of any association?— No.
5110. How long have you been growing tobacco?—
Since 1924.
5161. What area have you planted?—Up to thirteen
acres. My smallest area was three acres.
5162. Have you erected barns for flue-curing?—
Yes; I had tw 7 o, but one was burned down. One was
made out of slab and other material from the farm and
cost about £25; the other cost a little under £lOO. It
had double walls of galvanized iron and the spaces were
filled with sawdust.
5163. Did you get any instructions from the Depart-
ment as to how to erect it ?—lt was mainly built on
a specification issued by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, except that the flue was flat.
51*64. What results have you had?— Very good.
5165. Have you experienced blue mould?— No.
5166. Any other pests ?—Cut-worm and green cater-
pillar.
5167. Any trouble with frosts ?—Once. I lost about
an acre.
5168. Have you had a crop every year?—No, Last
year, particularly, I lost practically the whole of the
crop owing to drought.
5169. Do you irrigate at all?—No, mainly because
irrigation is depreciated by the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company.
5170. Did Mr, Lough see you?— Yes.
5171. Does he give you any information you ask
for ?—Y es.
5172. Who taught you to do your own curing?—l
picked it up mainly through reading and personal
study. I was assisted with literature by the South Aus-
tralian Department of Agriculture.
5173. What have been the results in the selling of
your tobacco?—ln the first year we harvested acres
which averaged £lll per acre, exclusive of my own
labor.
5174. Did you employ any labour?—No, it was a
family concern.
5175. So that was your gross profit?— Yes.
5176. How did you get on in the following year?—
It was a poor year owing to drought, but in the third
year I received between £7O and £BO per acre including
all labor except my own personal supervision.
5177. What did you pay for casual labor?— From
10s. to 15s. a day.
5178. Did you employ any labor for curing?— No.
5179. How many acres did you have in?— Between
five and six.


5180. What was the yield per acre? —Some of it
went 600 lb. and some a little more. In the first
year I should say it went 800 lb., which was my biggest
return.
5181. Did you fertilize the ground?— Heavily.
5182. Who told you to do that ? —I think Mr. Lough
suggested that, especially superphospate.
5183. You have included the cost of fertilizers?— Yes.
5184. What is the nature of the land? —A light
sandy soil with a clay subsoil.
5185. Did the buyers approve of the class of land? —
I should say they were for and against it. I do not
think Mr. Lough would say he was quite favorable to
the land, but he said it was very fair. Mr. Slagg
said it was very nice land for tobacco.
5186. Who told you the varieties to use? —Mainly
Mr. Opie.
5187. Did you get a fair proportion of bright leaf ?
—Fully 80 per cent, of bright mahogany and some
very fine lemon yellow. In 1927 I had about 60 to 70
per cent, of bright, and I think that would be the figure
right through except in the drought years.
5188. How did you get on in 1928?— That was a
bad year owing to drought, but this year was very good.
I have twelve acres under crop. The crop is still being
cured. I think it should go between 500 and 600 lb.
to the acre.
5189. How are you getting on with the bright leaf?
—I have a good proportion this year of bright maho-
gany and lemon yellow.
5190. Has the industry paid you in the last six
years ? —Yes.
5191. Are you satisfied to keep going on the same
basis of profit ?—Yes, but if I depended soley on to-
bacco there might be a different story to tell, except that
much more of my time might be put into cultural
operations. I might have got better results if I had
devoted the whole of my time to the cultivation of the
land.
5192. Do you think that is fair to the manufacturer,
when you expect a payable price?— That is only one
of the things we have had to learn, because we have
been absolutely on our own.
5193. You admit that owing to your other lines you
are not able to put your best w r ork into the cultivation
of tobacco? —1 am speaking mainly of the drought
years, but during the successful years we have done
our very best with the land. With regard to the varie-
ties, the curing and the grading we have done the best
we could. Mr. Lough has helped with the grading.
5194. You have been getting 2s. a lb., plus a bonus
of 6d., for bright mahogany, and now, if you get the
same proportion of bright, you are entitled to a Is.
bonus ?—Yes.
5195. Have you had much tobacco that has brought
Is. lid. or Is. ll|d. ?—A fair proportion.
5196. What type was that? —Bright.
5197. Can you understand why some of it brought
just under 2s.? —Ho. I had a good deal of corres-
pondence a couple of years ago on that point. The com-
pany said my tobacco had a peculiar smell, but, when I
visited Sydney and had a conversation with Mr. Bentley
and Mr. Lough, they both declared that the smell had
entirely disappeared. Nevertheless I had to pay the
piper.
5198. Had the smell disappeared from the leaf when
they paid you that bad-smelling price?— Yes.
5199. What was the smell? —Ho particular smell.
5200. Did you ever hear of eucalyptus taint?—-That
is ridiculous. There is no support for that assertion.
5201. How do you know that ?- —My ground has never
had any eucalyptus on it. It is a creek flat.
5202. By Mr. Morgan. —Are there no eucalypts on
the water shed? —They certainly grow in the district.
5203. By the Chairman. —Did they ever complain to
you about eucalyptus?— Ho.
5204. Did they give you any theory as to the cause
of the smell? —Ho. In Melbourne I was shown some
of my leaf and it was declared to be entirely satis-
factory in regard to aroma.
5205. Do you know what could have improved the
aroma in the meantime ?—I can only say that the whole
thing was ridiculous because the aroma was exactly
the same as that of my leaf of previous years,
5206. Have you any samples ?—I produce samples of
my 1924 and 1926 tobacco. It has been said by Mr.
Hinnes that the rib of Australian-grown tobacco is
thick and hollow. I draw the committee’s attention to
the fact that the stem of the sample of my 1924 leaf
produced is not hollow. We have noticed no hollow
stem in any of our tobacco.
5207. What do you think of a bounty?—l would
favour a bounty that could be balanced from the
economic point of view. I would not like to see a
bounty paid out of the pockets of the general taxpayers.
5208. Should the grower pay his own bounty?—He
does now to a certain extent. He pays all his own
expenses. I would only favour a bounty if it could be
applied so that the industry alone would pay for it.
5209. The manufacturer or the smoking public?—
Both perhaps.
5210. Hot the grower?— The grower needs a great
deal of assistance, and I think that a little financial help
would be of great value to him.
5211. You say that 2s. 6d. a pound satisfies you?—
There is a lot of expense, and if the growers could be
assisted to experiment with cultural operations and
different types of leaf it w T ould be helpful.
5212. Do you favour a duty on foreign tobacco?—
Yes, but not a prohibitive duty.
5213. A prohibitive duty would result in an increase
in the price charged for the imported article?—-That
would stimulate the production of tobacco in Australia,
in which I firmly believe.
5214. You have no objection to making people pay
more for imported tobacco, which is 95 per cent, of the
tobacco smoked, pending the stimulation of the industry
in Australia? —If anything could be done to stimulate
the industry without raising the tariff I should recom-
mend leaving the duty as it is.
5215. Do you know that the British Australasian
Tobacco Company is prepared to buy at least ten times
as much bright leaf in Australia as it can get?— Ho.
5216. In view of the prices it is paying to-day,
do you consider it necessary to increase the duty at all?
—Tobacco could be grown much more extensively in
Australia than it is to-day. Very few people in my
district know that tobacco is grown there. If it were
generally known that it can be grown in Australia
such an impetus would be given to the industry that
before long the company would be able to meet its
requirements of bright leaf in this country. I am
convinced that this tobacco can be successfully grown
in South Australia.
5217. The price is high enough already?—lf we
could put the local leaf on the market at a lower price
than is now paid for imported tobacco there would be
a bigger demand for it.
5218. What tobacco do you smoke?—l have used
American leaf, and I have smoked tobacco made up on
my own farm. When I buy tobacco now I ask for an
Australian brand. I have tried “ Signet ” and
“ Belvidere ” and I like “Signet.” I have also smoked
“ Waratah ” and “Sunday Best.” “ Waratah ”is very
good.
5219. “ Signet ” is comprised of Australian and im-
ported leaf on a fifty-fifty basis?—l did not know that.
5220. If you had no other tobacco would you smoke
“Waratah?”—Yes, we smoked much worse in France.
5221. Have you anything further to say?— Deferring
to the arrangement entered into between the British
Australasian Tobacco Company and the Commonwealth


Government, it seems to me that if some money were
spent, not in bringing Americans here to tell us that
we cannot grow tobacco, but in sending Australians to
America to find out what is done there, we should
benefit the Australian grower, and the cost of tobacco
might be considerably reduced.
5222. What Americans have come here?—l think
that all the Americans who have come here have told us
that we cannot grow tobacco. My remarks have no
personal application.
5223. Mr. Slagg, the Director of the Investigation
Committee, is an American, and he tells us that we can
grow tobacco in Australia? —-I think that most of the
evidence submitted by him has been against the Aus-
tralian leaf.
5224. Has he not said that we need to improve it
to reach the American standard ?—ln my opinion bis
evidence has been more damning than that. My im-
pression is that if Australians were sent to America to
ferret out the methods adopted there, so that growers
in Australia could obtain practical guidance, they
would be better off industrially and financially.
5225. Do you know that Mr. Temple Smith and Dr.
Darnell-Smith were both sent to America, and that
they published pamphlets relating to their experiences.
Dr, Cameron, Director of Agriculture in Victoria, also
went there and gave his views upon the matter. Have
you read those pamphlets?—l have read Mr. Temple-
Smith’s, but the growers themselves do not get the
experience that is necessary. If one or tw 7 o from each
State were selected over a series of years to go to
America and find out exactly what is being done there,
they could bring back the information obtained. Then
we could make practical use of it. It is all right for an
expert to deal with tobacco-growing from the technical
point of view, but the growers themselves should be
assisted in getting necessary information, and immedi-
ately on their return they could put the knowledge
gained to practical use.
5226. A grower might not disseminate such infor-
mation among all the other growers. Who should
bear the expense of their visits to the United States of
America?—We are spending £lOO,OOO now between the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company and the Federal
Government. In my opinion, the money should be
spent in operations such as I have mentioned,
5227. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you consider it better to
send individual growers to America rather than the
State experts who make their knowledge the common
property of the people of Australia?— One of the con-
ditions under which the grower v. 7 ould be sent away
would be that he made the information available to all
the other growers.
5228. Do you say too much money is being spent on
research wmrk?—Yes.
5229. If scientific wmrk is hampered, who is to make
the necessary investigations ?—Practical men who have
grown tobacco.
5230. How can they tackle scientific problems?— The
problems only arise from practical experience. The
technique is in the soil.
5231. Take the chemistry of soils and fertilizers?—
Those matters, I admit, may well be dealt with by
experts.
5232. How can a private grower attempt the solution
of those problems ?—He could obtain information from
the chemist, but the chemist should not be expected to
tell us how to grow 7 tobacco.
5233. If the grower lacks the essential qualifications
for the job, how 7 can he do it?—lf a certain leaf can
be grown from a particular soil, I can have my soil
analysed and compare the results with those obtained
from soil analyses in America.
5234. Would not the growers who would be prepared
to do that represent an infinitesimal proportion of
the w 7 hole?—I do not know 7.
5235. Has not 95 per cent, of the error in tobaccO-
growing in Australia been due to the use of unsuitable
soil?—I believe that a very great percentage of it is
due to that, but I would not go so far as 95 per cent.
5236. Would you be prepared to terminate the exist-
ing arrangement between the Government and the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company?— Hot wholly.
I should certainly have the experts, but instead of
spending so much money on administration more should
be spent on practical issues.
5237. Much is being spent on experimentation?—
We have not felt much benefit from it in South Aus-
tralia.
5238. It has been suggested to me that the present
basis of investigation is wrong, and that the work
should revert to the various States and to the State
experts ?—lf there is such a person as the State expert,
I should certainly bring the work nearer home. That
would be very helpful to the growers.
5239. Would that not lead to disastrous competition
between the States? Would you not have Mr. Tregenna
at the throat of Mr. Temple Smith, and Mr. Smith
returning the compliment?—l think that is what they
are doing now 7 .
5240. Do you think that helps the investigation?—
Disunity will not help any investigation.
5241. Would not central control help to break down
the antagonism?—l still think the State idea is the
better one.
5242. By Mr. J ones. —Excluding the bonus, have your
prices over the last few 7 years been improving?— They
are disappointing in a sense. In my first year Mr.
Lough made up a hand of tobacco and said, “If you
supply that, it is worth 3s. 9d. to 3s. a pound.” That
was in 1924 or 1925. I kept that hand of tobacco. In
1927 we had what 1 considered a specially good crop
of lemon yellow leaf. I have since modified my idea of
it. It was a very yellow mahogany. We got 2s. a
pound and the bonus of 6d. for it. Since 1927 the
average price has been less than 2s. 6d.
5243. Is the average price you are now getting equal
to the average you got three or four years ago?—l
should say it is about the same.
5244. Supposing a bounty were to be paid, would you
favor an increase in the import duty, so that those
who insisted upon smoking imported tobacco vrould
assist in providing the bounty?— Yes.
5245. In that way the consumers as a body would
not be asked to pay more for their tobacco, but only
those who insisted on using imported tobacco?—
Precisely.
5246. In view of the fact that the British-Austral-
asian Tobacco Company is prepared to buy about ten
times as much bright tobacco as it has been able to
secure, would an increased import duty be an incentive
to the growers to try to meet that demand?— Yes.
5247. Would a reduction in the excise duty also act
as a stimulus to the industry?— Yes.
5248. By Mr. Slagg. —Have you read the reports that
have been put out from time to time by the various
State Governments regarding tobacco culture?— Yes.
5249. Have you read the reports made by the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation?— Some of them.
5250. Have you read Bulletin No. 2 on the smoking
qualities of Australian tobacco?—l think I recollect
reading that.
5251. Do you remember that among other things that
bulletin, in giving the results of smoking tests, em-
phasized the fact that different qualities of leaf were
produced in different parts of Australia?— Yes.
5252. In the light of these facts do you not think
that the problem of wdaat to do with these different to-
baccoes with varying qualities is a Commonwealth one?
—Ho. It is a Commonwealth problem from one point
of view, but it can be handled in the States. Each


State can deal with its own problems. It is a Com-
monwealth problem as well because the whole of Aus-
tralia is concerned from a revenue point of view.
5253. By Mr. Lough. —l believe you said you sold a
good deal of bright leaf at Is. lid. and Is. ll|d. per
lb. In what year was that?—l think the chairman’s
leading question was at about Is. lid. We sold about
ten bales at Is. 3d. in 1923. Ido not recollect receiving
Is. ll|d, or Is. but I think we have sold at
Is. 10d., Is. 9d. and Is, Bd.
The witness vjithdrew
Ernest Robert Spinks Rutland, secretary and
accountant, 32 Eairford-street, Hew Parkside,
South Australia, was called, sworn and examined.
5254. By the Chairman. —How long were you associ-
ated with the tobacco industry?— From 1889 to 1914.
I was employed for 24 years continuously with Robert
Hixson and Co., who bad a factory at Light Square,
Adelaide. In about 1901 the company merged into the
Hixson Tobacco Company, and finally it merged into
the Britisb-Australasian Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd.
The Adelaide branch was closed up in 1914. I have
prepared the following statement for the information of
the committee:—
My opinion is that every effort should be made to en-
courage the growing in Australia of tobacco leaf of the best
quality.
The soil, climatic conditions, and environment, if properly
understood and systematically utilized are ideally suited for
the production of tobacco leaf of the highest grade.
Only about one-fourteenth of the tobacco loaf required for
the smoking section of our community is grown in Australia,
and as yet only a small quantity can be classed as of fine
quality and compare favorably with that of older and
more experienced countries in the production of the soothing
weed. When the growers of tobacco leaf in Australia realize
the necessity for a closer and more intimate knowledge of the
sensitive nature of the tobacco plant, the soil most suitable,
atmospheric surroundings, and the various circumstances to
be taken into account, as well as the proper selection of seed,
raising of seedlings, transplanting, tending, gathering in, and
curing, we will witness the production of Australian-grown
tobacco leaf increase by leaps and bounds.
It is strange that certain theorists and professors of uni-
versities who have been placed in highly salaried positions in
Australia, but have virtually no actual experience in tilling
the soil, have not, long since, guided the growers in obtaining
a much greater yield of high-class tobacco leaf.
It is deplorable to find that if anything the quality of the
tobacco leaf grown has deteriorated of late years, but, in spite
of all this, the prospects of the industry are very bright,
especially if this select committee is able to place a strong
case in its favour before the Federal Parliament.
The growers have asked for a bounty on Australian-grown
leaf, but it is my opinion that if bounties are to be paid to
help every industry that it may be desired to foster, they
will eventually be disastrous to the best interests of the people
of Australia, and in the end thwart the very purpose which
they are intended to achieve. It should be our aim to
institute industries in Australia, and especially primary
industries, but not perpetually, on the spoonfed system.
As an alternative, then, to the Federal Government paying
a bounty, it should seek other means of obtaining the objec-
tive —the growing of all the tobacco leaf required in Australia,
by Australians, for the benefit of the whole of the Australian
people, not allowing the Americans or any other people to
flood our markets with their productions to the detriment of
our workers.
I would suggest that the select committee place before
the Federal Parliament the importance of appointing men who
are experienced in the growth and manufacture of tobacco, to
meet delegates elected by the growers’ associations in Aus-
tralia to go fully into the question of forming a semi-
co-operative body to manufacture Australian-grown tobacco
and distribute it direct to the consumers.
Whether an amicable and financially sound arrangement
were agreed upon or not by such a gathering, the Federal
Government could encourage the growers by creating an
expert department to grade the cured leaf produced into a
standard quality, and when the standard quality had been
arrived at, any lower standard should be rejected, the total
amount of the standard quality estimated or assured to be
deducted from the total amount of leaf required in Australian
manufacture for consumption, and the balance to be rationed
for importation.
F. 218. —19
A guarantee should be given by the tobacco manufacturers
of Australia first that all standard quality Australian-grown
tobacco leaf passed by the Federal Tobacco Leaf Experts De-
partment should be purchased before the Federal Govern-
ment would permit the importation of the balance of foreign-
grown leaf necessary to make a full supply of the manu-
factured article to satisfy the smoking public of Australia.
That would mean that as the quantity of standard quality of
Australian-grown leaf increased a corresponding reduction of
the importation of foreign-grown leaf would be rationed, and
when the time arrived that we could produce ample for our
own requirements foreign importations would be prohibited
until we might be strong enough to compete against the
world.
That the increase of duty on the recently made imported
leaf, and the decrease of excise on locally-grown leaf is justi-
fiable and necessary goes without saying, if our objective is to
encourage the production of locally-grown tobacco leaf, but
if the rationing idea, as suggested before, is carried out, it
would at present be a mere revenue tax and an added burden
to the smoker to further increase the duty. As the request of
the growers for an increase in the duty has been given effect to
by the present Government, no further alteration would
be necessary, except for revenue purposes, under the rationing
svstem.
The arrangement with the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company Proprietary Limited as regards experiments in grow-
ing tobacco leaf, is a most unsatisfactory agreement, and
should be cancelled at the earliest possible moment, as it gives
that combine a moral controlling power which no individual
or collection of individuals should have in such an important
industry as that of tobacco leaf growing, which ought to be
solely controlled by the people, through their representatives
in Parliament.
Private vested interests are always striving for a distinct
advantage, through the innate selfishness of all human nature,
over every other except their particular co-interested fellows,
and are never satisfied until they have the lion’s share of the
spoils in their insatiable grip. We can always be sure that, if
not immediately, eventually, when the people as a whole have
control, a more just and equitable state of things will be
evolved. There are too many instances where a fatal mistake
has been made in allowing the selfish vested interests of a
section of the people to encroach upon those of the people
generally.
My strong opinion is that it would be in the best interests
of the growers, and the people of Australia as a whole to place
the carrying out of experiments in tobacco leaf growing in
Australia, directly under the control of the federal authorities,
and not allow any individual, or any private or public
company to meddle in them. We should not take into
consideration any tempting offer of thousands of pounds
sterling, \ested interests always have the predominating in-
centive of individual gain hidden beneath the desire to appear
so generous.
5255. You consider the present protection satis-
factory. You are opposed to the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company Pty. Ltd. or any interested manufac-
turer contributing towards the cost of experiments and
the general supervision of scientific and field work?—
Yes. It should be solely vested in the Federal Govern-
ment.
5256. You can trace a moral influence which might
handicap the development of the industry?— Yes.
Trust the people, but no individuals.
5257. You are not in favour of any increase in the
import duty?—-Ho. I think that Australian leaf could
be made free of excise duty for the benefit of the
growers and consumers. If a federal expert passed
Australian leaf as fit for use by manufacturers the
latter should have to guarantee the purchase of that
leaf before they purchased imported leaf.
5258. You would really compel the manufacturer to
buy Australian leaf before importing any?— Yes.
5209. Ho you think that that scheme would he
practicable ?—lt should be.
The witness withdrew.
Professor Arthur James Perkins, Hirector of Agricul-
ture, Soutn Australia, was called, sworn and
examined.
5260. By the Chairman. —Ho you wish to submit a
statement with respect to tobacco-growing in South
Australia?— Yes; it is as follows;

ment of the tobacco-growing industry in South Australia have

been largely a matter of advice to growers, and the publica-
tion of articles relative to the cultivation of this crop. All
growers are regularly visited throughout the season, and
assisted in every possible way. The property of intending
growers is inspected, and an opinion expressed as to whether
the soii, rainfall, climate, &c., afford a reasonable change of
producing tobacco of the desired quality. Each year seed of
the best varieties is secured for distribution amongst growers.
In 1928 an area of 10 acres of land at Mt. Barker was
leased by the department for us as tobacco experimental pur-
poses. Upwards of 50 varieties were imported from other
countries with more temperate climates, and are being tested
on this area in comparison with the best flue-cured American
types. In addition, tests regarding the best covering for
tobacco seed-beds have been conducted, and simple manurial
experiments are in progress. So far as expenditure is con-
cerned, no officer is wholly engaged upon tobacco investiga-
tions. Estimating that £lOO per annum is a fair allowance
for the salary of the officer when so engaged, the expenditure
since 1920-21, which was the commencement of work in South
Australia, is as follows: —
Year. f
Although not connected with the Department of Agriculture,
I might add that financial assistance by the Government per-
mitted the Tobacco Growers’ Association at Mount Barker to
erect two barns and a bulking shed for use of their members.
That statement merely consists of replies to inquiries
made by the secretary of your committee.
5261. Do you wish to add anything?— Our experi-
ence up to date is limited, but we are under the
impression from some results secured that we should
in course of time be able to grow a satisfactory light-
coloured leaf. The difficulty, of course, is that all our
growers are practically novices, and we have to learn
ourselves the relationship of soils and manures, &c., to
quality in leaf. To a very great extent Ave are depen-
dent on Mr. Slagg’s work in the other States. We hope
to get information of the work he is doing to enable
us to get out on proper lines. No doubt a good deal of
the leaf grown has not been of a particularly high
quality, but we have produced some good leaf, and,
taking the matter generally, we feel that we have had
the encouragement of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company in that direction. The company has pur-
chased the leaf at what appeared to be reasonable com-
mercial values, and has lent us a good deal of assistance
in the past in that direction. Our greatest weakness in
South Australia is lack of summer rains. Even in the
hills districts the growers have been short of rain of
late. I believe that by the slight use of irrigation we
can overcome that trouble. In most tobacco districts
good water is available at a reasonable distance from the
surface.
5262. Have you been in close communication with the
Federal Investigation Committee since it was appointed
in 1927?—T0 a certain extent, but I cannot claim to
have been in close touch with it. From time to time
results have been reported at the meeting of the Stand-
ing Committee of the Council for Scientific and Indus-
trial Research. I am a member of that committee,
but beyond that I have not been in touch with the
investigation committee. We should have preferred
seeing regular annual reports of the work done, whether
there was any particular matter to report on or not.
5263. Have you had no report at all since the inves-
tigations started? — Simply occasional statements made
to the Standing Committee.
5264. Have you asked for any?— No. I have been
assuming that reports would come out.
5265. Have you been advised of the personal work
Mr. Slagg has been doing?— Not beyond what has
been told to the Standing Committee of the Council
for Scientific and Industrial Research.
5266. Has you department received copies of Bulletin
No. 2, issued by Mr. Slagg some time ago, dealing with
the results of experimentation in Australia? —We have
had it.
5267. From your knowledge of that work do you
think it should be continued?— Yes; but I should like to
see a definite report as to the results secured.
5268. We have had evidence from Mr. Gepp and
others that it would take at least ten years to get any-
where with the investigations in Australia on the
scientific side?—l do not think it is unreasonable to
say that. There is no end to this class of work. Results
might come rapidly or not; it depends on circumstances.
5269. The first three-years period is nearly up.
Would it be advisable to close down this work and allow
it to revert to the States ?—I think that would be inad-
visable. It would be practically throAving away the
money that has been spent already.
5270. Would you be prepared, on the present position
of the federal inquiry, to recommend your Government
to support it further, in the event of this committee
saying that the investigations should be continued?—
Certainly.
5271. And that South Australia should participate?
—Yes, but I would add that the committee be asked to
issue a regular annual report, apart from special
reports, as to its progress.
5272. Do you mean a public or a departmental
report ?—lt could be kept departmental, but such a
report should be given apart from the special investi-
gation.
5273. Subject to that, you would be prepared to
recommend that South Australia continue to participate
in the investigation work?— Certainly.
5274. Do you know that the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company has contributed the bulk of the
money towards that work?— Yes.
5275. In the event of the company ceasing to con-
tribute at the end of the three years, leaving the Com-
monwealth and the States to shoulder the burden
themselves, do you think South Australia would be pre-
pared to consider increased contributions to the work?
—I cannot swear that. You know the difficult financial
position of this State at present.
5276. Rather than that the work should discontinue,
you give favorable consideration to its con-
tinuation even if further expense were involved?—
Beyond the commitments already made, I do not care
to express any opinion. The present financial position
is too critical.
5277. But in any case you personally would seriously
consider the matter before seeing your State with-
draAv from the scheme ?—Apart from finance, certainly.
5278. Any increase in expenditure would be a matter
of policy for the Government?— Yes.
5279. You have not thought it worth while to employ
a straight out full-time tobacco expert?—No, our
interests are so small at present, and we are waiting
to see the result of the investigations and the extent
to which Ave Avould be justified in pushing the industry,
particularly as in the past we have been able to, call
upon the services of experts in the other States and
the Commonwealth.
5280. What area is under tobacco in South Aus-
tralia to-day?— About 40 acres, including the experi-
mental area.
5281. Have you ever had more than that under
cultivation?— That is the maximum.
5282. How many growers are there ?— Eleven.


5283. Have you personally kept in touch with the
development of the industry in South Australia?—As
head of the Department, I visit the growers about once
a year.
5284. Are they making every effort to improve their
methods of cultivation and curing?— Most of them are,
but as you no doubt realize, this type of work is quite
different from that of the average Australian farmer.
It is more in the nature of work that a market
gardener who operates on a large scale would be able
to tackle. Some of the growers do not realize the
detail work that is essential. With practically all of
them, tobacco-growing is a side line. On the whole,
tobacco probably has not had the fair run that it
might have received if the men had been dependent
on that product alone, and were more expert in that
type of work.
5285. Do you think that the expenditure by the
South Australian Government since 1920-21 on tobacco
investigation in this State has been justified by the
results ?—Yes.
5286. If there were any considerable develpoment
of the industry here it might be worth while your
Department extending the field work?— Yes; if there
were a larger number of growers and a greater area
under cultivation, we would do so. It has been im-
pressed on us that only the proper type of leaf should
be grown.
5287. Are there many inquiries from would-be
growers?— Yes.
5288. Has your Department adopted a policy of
caution in regard to advising them?— Yes. We heard
that in other States the tendency had been to grow
tobacco on land where the plants made strong growth.
We have discouraged growers here from cultivating
tobacco except in those localities where leaf of the
proper quality can be grown. Some of them grow a
few plants which do well, but the leaf is not marketable;
therefore we have to keep people back in their own
interests.
5289. Has the financial assistance given to the
Association at Mount Barker been granted on the
basis of a loan?— Yes, we helped them in the same
way as we assist producers to erect cold storage sheds
for apples. The money advanced is repayable on
reasonable terms. ’
5290. Is Mount Barker the only place where this
assistance has been required for tobacco growing?—
Yes, but assistance would be available to other growers
on approved sites.
5291. I take it that the position in South Australia
is that you are satisfied with what has been done up to
the present, but you are now awaiting the result of the
Federal investigation before going further into the
industry?—We do not want people to waste their time
and money on something that will not be profitable.
5292. Did you go to the British-Australasian To-
bacco Company for advice in this matter?— Yes. They
supplied us with seed at one time, and sent an officer to
give us advice. They even sent a man from Sydney to
judge prizes for tobacco. We have had every reason-
able assistance from them.
5293. Did you find that they were not at all
enthusiastic about the development of the industry in
South Australia?— Ho. At one time they thought we
would have an exceptional leaf, but subsequent events
did not turn out exactly as we had hoped. My im-
pression is that if we can produce the type of leaf they
want they will be only too pleased, and that they will
assist us in finding out the conditions under which it
can be got.
5294. Have you smoked any brands of Australian-
grown tobacco?— Yes, but these things go by fashion
and taste. It is quite possible that if there were no
Virginian leaf available people would smoke Australian
leaf. We see that in South Africa where the people
unoke a tobacco which we do not care for.
5295. Have you come across any Australian
cigarettes ?—Ho.
5296. Here is a cigarette made from tobacco grown
at Mareeba, Horth Queensland. Will you try it?—
Yes. I have no objection to this cigarette. I notice
that it is rather too tightly packed.
5297. Can you detect any unpleasant aroma?— Ho.
I have no objection to it at all.
5298. Have you heard of the theory that there is
a fundamental fault in Australian tobacco due to the
taint of eucalyptus in the soil?— Yes, but physio-
logically I cannot understand it. I cannot see how
an essential oil can be directly absorbed by a plant.
That is a matter for a plant physiologist to explain.
5299. It has been said that, in one test, eucalyptus
leaves were mixed with certain sandy soil imported from
America, and similar Australian soil was similarly
treated. These soils were subjected to a two years’ test,
and at the end of the first year the tobacco grown in
these beds had a very unpleasant aroma. In the
second year no fresh leaves were added, but at the
end of the second year the aroma was rather pleasant.
Is it not possible that this might be due to the contact of
the leaves with the soil? —I do not see how that could
be so.
5300. Is it at all feasible to argue that, because of
the eucalyptus vegetation in Australia, tobacco grown
in such soil must be tainted with a eucalyptus odour ?
I should not care to express an opinion unless 1 saw
the whole of the results and knew who carried out the
tests. I cannot see how it could happen. I cannot give
an off-hand reply.
6301. Do you think that far from eucalyptus hav-
ing a deleterious effect on the aroma it would be more
likely to have an improving effect ?—I would not
argue the matter. Why is there no taste of eucalyptus
in our rhubarb and cabbages? Why should this sup-
posed taint be confined to tobacco?
5302. Dr. Cameron, Director of Agriculture in
Victoria, asked the same question, but many persons
are circulating the theory?—lf the tobacco gets a
taint I think that it is due to contact with the leaf
afterwards. It may be due to lack of care or even to
eucalyptus dust being blown on to the leaf, but I cannot
understand how the taint can be obtained from the
soil.
5303. You would not accept the theory unless you
had proof?— Ho.
5304. The idea is that because of eucalyptus vege-
tation in Australia a plant like tobacco is very likely
to be susceptible to that aroma?—l cannot accept that
theory. Can you point to any other plant that is so
affected ?
5305. It has been said that Australia is one of the
few countries in the world where the eucalyptus is
found. The tests are wholly inconclusive and yet the
theory is widely accepted?— You have to make the
theory rest on facts.
5306. By Mr. Martens. —Even knowing you are now
smoking a cigarette made wholly of Australian tobacco,
you say it is good?— Yea.
5307. By Mr. Jones. —l notice that in the last year
more than twice as much has been spent on investiga-
tion work in South Australia than in any previous
year?—Up to last year, we had not done any work our-
selves, but we have now rented a piece of land, and are
now carrying out experiments in order to be quite
certain of the results.
5308. Is the expense borne solely by the State?—
Practically, yes.
5309, What is your opinion as to giving a stimulus
to the industry through the tariff ?—The tariff seems to
be the only means We have. If it would help in any


way, I should say yes. If cigarettes could he produced
like the one I have just smoked, I am sure it would do
as much good as anything.
5310. We have had evidence that the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company has been prepared to buy
about ten times as much Australian-grown bright leaf
as it has been able to secure. In view of that fact,
would an increased import duty, or, as an alternative, a
reduction in the excise on Australian grown leaf, be an
incentive for Australians to go in more extensively for
tobacco culture? —Personally, I should say the Aus-
tralian leaf ought to be free from excise duty, condi-
tional on the grower getting the advantage. If you
increase the price of a commodity to the grower he
will go to a lot of trouble over it. The excise duty
on the local leaf cannot amount to a very large sum
now,
5311. By the Chairman. —The grower says that pro-
vided he gets 2s. 6d. a pound, and secures a crop every
year, he will be satisfied. Then we have the manu-
facturer saying that he cannot sell Australian tobacco
because the smoking qualities do not appeal to the
consumers. He tells us that since they insist on getting
American leaf, it is no use advertising Australian
brands. The company is now paying a price that is
acceptable to the growers for the leaf it requires?—
If a higher price were paid to the grower, there would
be a better chance of the company getting the quantity
it wants. We have uncertain summers in South Aus-
tralia, and sometimes the leaf does not correspond to
the 2s. 6d. price. Damage is caused by hail. I should
say the growers cannot depend on more than 50 per
cent, on the average.
5312. If we gave the excise back to the grower it
would mean an enormous price for his leaf. It would
be nearly ss. a pound. How can you make the Aus-
tralian smoker buy Australian leaf ?—How would it do
to halve the excise between the grower and the smoker ?
5313. If the present excise were removed, and we
gave the Australian smoker a decent pipe tobacco at
the rate of 2 oz. for Is., or 6d. a packet for cigarettes,
do you think he would give the Australian tobacco a
trial? Would that tempt him?— You also want to
tempt the grower. Very few of them average 2s. 6d.
a lb. for their leaf, and that is why I say half should go
to the smoker and half to the grower. The South
Africans smoke their own tobacco because they have
been forced to get used to it.
5314. By Mr. Jones. —Would there be any difficulty
in persuading Australians to smoke cigarettes such as
the one you are now T smoking, which is made of Aus-
tralian-grown tobacco entirely ?-—I do not think so.
5315. By the Chairman. —If they were sold at 6d. a
packet the public would buy them? —I think so.
5316. If these cigarettes were offered at 6d., and sold
as “ Capstans,” the purchasers would say “ They have
greatly improved the ‘ Capstan ’ ” ?—Yes, I think so. I
prefer this cigarette to a “ Capstan ”.
5317. By Mr. Jones. —lf the excise were abolished,
do you think that a gradually increasing excise duty
should be put on after the industry gets on its feet?—
Yes, I should abolish it, say, for five years, and then
review the position.
5318. Another suggestion by the State expert in
Victoria was to abolish the excise on Australian-grown
leaf, which is considerably less than 10 per cent, of the
amount consumed, and balance the revenue by increas-
ing the duty on imported tobacco?—l have no objec-
tion to that. It would be a reasonable way to protect
the revenue. It is quite necessary for the men engaged
in the industry to know where they are for a reason-
able time.
5319. By Mr. Slagg. —You realize that there are
many technical difficulties that the manufacturers will
be faced with immediately the excise is taken off one
type of leaf and put on another?— Would they not have
to declare tlie amount of Australian leaf on which a
drawback would be given?
5320. It would be very difficult from a factory stand-
point. Would it not be wiser to leave the excise duty
as it is, and give any additional protection desired by
increasing the import duty?—l do not like that so
much. I cannot see where the difficulties arise. The
duty is on the leaf itself. What is to prevent each
factory declaring and proving, of course, the amount
of Australian leaf they have received, and getting a
drawback on that quantity?
5321. Looking at this matter from the point of view
of the Federal Government, we are obtaining a con-
siderable revenue from tobacco in the form of import
and excise duties. Would it not be more desirable to
increase the import duty than to take off the excise
duty ? Ido not think so. What I have suggested
could be tried for a certain period.
5322. From the stand-point of the growers, would not
an increase in the import duty give them protection
just as well as a decrease in the excise? —-I do not know
that it would.
5323. A decrease in the excise duty would mean a
decrease in Government revenue? —A very slight in-
crease in the import duty would equalize matters,
because only about 10 per cent, of the tobacco manu-
factured here is grown in Australia.
5324. By Mr. Morgan. —How could we get the
excise back to the grower? Do you think it a prac-
tical proposition?— One has to average certain things.
5325. I can foresee a lot of trouble with the grower
on the question of averages?—He would have to agree
that under supervision he would be getting fair play.
We do this in other matters, and it could surely be
done in regard to tobacco.
5326. But how would the grower get his correct pro-
portion of the excise?— The present excise is 2s. 4d.
on the manufactured tobacco.
5327. That goes into the Consolidated Revenue, and
it seems impossible to secure to the grower his correct
proportion of it. How can the grower know what
proportion of his leaf is used in manufacture?— The
individual grower "would have to take the average.
5328. Do you not think that there would be endless
strife ?—There "would have to be Government super-
vision. The averaging arrangement would" be favor-
able to some and unfavorable to others.
5329. By Mr. Jones. —The Tariff Board in
1926-27 recommended that the excise on Australian leaf
be reduced by 6d. a pound, and that that 6d. be passed
on to the grower, and that a guarantee be obtained
from the buyer that it would be so passed on. Do
you think that an expert body like the Tariff Board
would make such a recommendation if insuperable
difficulties stood in the way of its adoption?—l cannot
see any insuperable difficulties. That body has prob-
ably looked into the matter.
533(1 By Mr. Slagg. —Are you aware that the recom-
mendation oi the board was not put into effect because
it was found impracticable to do so?— Ho. It is only
a matter of establishing a ratio which is acceptable as
an average.
The witness withdrew
Earld Alexander Hunt, tobacco grower, Mount Barker,
and President of the Tobacco Growers Associa-
tion of South Australia, was called, sworn and
examined.
5331. By the Chairman. —How many members have
you in your association?— Seventeen.
5332. In what parts of South Australia are you
growing tobacco ?—Principally in the Mount Barker
district.


5333. Have you made any attempt to enroll members
in other parts of the State?—We did two years ago.
5334. Is any tobacco grown to any extent outside
Mount Barker?— Only at Paris Creek where there are
three growers who are not members of the association.
Hot all the members are growers.
5335. How many actual growers are there in the
association ?—About seven.
5336. How many years have you been growing
tobacco? —Por seven years I have been experimenting.
In 1924-25 I grew four acres. I only cured one barn-
ful because the frost affected the crop.
5337. What did you get for that? —2s. lb., with the
bonus, for one barnful containing from 260 to 270 lb.
I received £26 11s.
5338, Have you taken any steps to work on co-opera-
tive lines ?—We built the barns on that basis. We
obtained a loan from the Government. We had to
give guarantees. Then we obtained a curer from Hew
South Wales, Mr. Howell, who was recommended b 7
the Bntxsh-Australasian Tobacco Company,
5339. On what lines have you been working?—Por
the first twm or three years I carried out some experi-
ments for the Government, and since then I have
been working on my own account. I have made
rnanurial tests.
5340. Have you kept records or submitted reports
to the Department?— Ho.
5341. Have you been asked for any?— Ho.
5342. Pnder whose supervision are you doing this?
—I am doing it on my own account.
5343. Have you satisfied yourself that you can grow
tobacco ?—Yes.
5344. Is the soil right?—l think so.
5345, What types do you grow?—Warne and White
Stem Orinoco.
5346. Do you do your own curing?— Pretty well all
of it. Mr. 110w T ell taught all the members of the
association his system of curing.
5347. What was the cost of the barns?—£l2o each.
They are made of iron and the sides are filled with
sawdust. The bulking shed cost £l4O.
5348. Is it a co-operative society working under an
Act of Parliament?— Yes.
5349. Who repays the money to the Government? —
The shareholders.
5350. Whether you get tobacco or not?— Yes.
5351. How do you get on with the buyer of the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company?— Well, up to
date.
5352. Are there any other buyers?— Ho.
5353. Any quarrels with the. buyer?— Ho.
5354. Are you satisfied with the prices?— Yes. I
think we average 2s. lb. all round. One man got 2s. 9d.
and the lowest was Is. sd. Several got from Is. B|d. to
2s. and 2s. 3d.
5355. If you got that every year the price w’ould
pay?— Yes, if we could get a fair season and a
reasonably good crop.
5356. Are you going in for more tobacco next year?
—Yes, I intend to plant about ten acres.
5357. Are you prepared for all the difficulties of
curing?— The curing does not worry me in the least.
5358. What does worry you?— Cut-worms worried
the Government, but not me. I suggest that the only
way to deal with them is to poison the land before
putting the plants in.
5359. Your only trouble has been the cut-worm?—
Yes.
5360. Have you experienced blue mould?—Ho,
5361. Have you studied the question of how to keep
it out of your district?— Ho.
5362. I think it w r ould be advisable to do that. Have
you considered what steps should be taken to encourage
the production of tobacco in Australia?—We should
try to make it cheaper to the consumer and advertise
it. So far as I can see, Australian tobacco is not
advertised at tbe present time.
5363. Are tbe prices satisfactory to tbe grower?—l
think so.
5364. You do not think they need bigger prices?—
Hot if they keep at the present level.
5365. By Mr. Morgan. —You are aware that a re-
quest has been made by a number of growers throughout
Australia for a bounty. What is your opinion?—
Personally I do not believe in a bounty. It creates a
false impression and does not make us produce our
best and cheapest. A bounty could not last for ever
and I think it economically wrong. It might be all
right for a year or two, but when it is taken off every-
thing falls through.
5366. There is an alternative proposition that
instead of a bounty the import duty on leaf not grown
in Australia should be increased, and there should be
a cut in the excise duty?—lf the import duty were
left alone and there were a cut in the excise, it would
meet the case.
5367. Assuming that a cut was made in the excise
duty, how could it be allocated ?—I leave that matter
to those who have more time to solve the problem than
I have.
5368. Are you aware of the arrangement between
certain States, the Federal Government and the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company in connexion
with the investigation of the improvement of the Aus-
tralian leaf, and do you consider it a wise arrangement?
—lt is wise, and I think it should be continued, but a
little more should come to South Australia for the
money.
5369. It has been submitted to this committee that
the Investigation Committee is not doing all that, might
reasonably be expected, and that better results would
follow if the control were taken from the Federal
Government and vested in the various State Govern-
ments?—-I do not agree with that.
5370. You think that the States w T ould get a better
deal by a continuation of the present arrangement?—
They should.
5371. By Mr. Martens. —What has been your ex-
perience in regard to the advice given by Mr. Slagg?—
1 cannot speak too highly of him. Whenever I have
asked him for assistance he has given it.
5372. What quantity of tobacco do you take from an
acre?— Between 600 and 700 lb. We find that we can
plant more plants per acre. We have been putting in
about 6,000. We started with about 5,000 and I
think that we can safely go to 7,000 or 8,000. The
object is to get a bigger yield and a finer quality of
leaf by preventing the plants from growing too large.
5373. Is there much room for expansion in your
district?— There is any quantity of land and there is
plenty of room for improvement. There are thousands
of acres.
_ 5374. By Mr. Tully. —Are there thousands of acres
similar to the land on which you have the experimental
plot?— Yes. If w r e can get Australians to smoke Aus-
tralian tobacco, land that now does not return sufficient
to pay the tax levied upon it will be rendered profitable.
5375. By the Chairman— What is the unimproved
value of that land now?— About £3 per acre.
5376. By Mr. Morgan. —What is the value of the
improved land?— Prom £4O to £6O,
6377, What is that value created by?— Subterranean
clover. One reason why we think that tobacco will go
ahead more is that at present it does not pay to thresh
clover. Last year between £50,000 and £60,000 worth
of clover seed was sold in Mount Barker, but the market
for it is now glutted.
5378. By Mr. Jones. —What is the cost of clearing?
—On an average, £lO per acre. I refer to clearing
that wrould enable the land to be ploughed deeply.


5379. By the Chairman. —Have you any further
evidence to give ?—Reference has been made to eucalyp-
tus taint. I suggest that perhaps it is caused by
faulty flues and the use of wood on which there are
eucalyptus leaves.
The witness withdrew.
Adolph Charles Langrehr, farmer, Mount Barker, and
Secretary of the Tobacco Growers’ Association of
South Australia, was called, sworn and examined.
5380. By the Chairman. —Do you occupy any other
position in connexion with the industry?—l am secre-
tary of the co-operative company known as Co-opera-
tive Tobacco Barns Limited.
5381. Is that company confined to Mount Barker?—
We also have members at Balhannah and Hahndorf.
5382, The object of that co-operative company is
merely to pay off the money advanced for the barns?—
We do not grow tobacco. We only cure the leaf.
Three years ago we employed Mr. Howell, of Hew
South Wales, as curer, but the two following years
were practically failures. This year the leaf will be
cured with the assistance of the curer used by the
Government. I refer to Mr. Hunt, a nephew of the
last witness.
5383. Have you grown tobacco yourself?— Yes.
Three years ago I had a small area and was well
satisfied with the return. Despite pests, I received
£4B Bs. from one acre, and only about one-third of the
leaf was picked.
5384, Why did you not continue?— The next two
years were failures in the planting out, and in the
second year caterpillars were experienced. This year
I planted two acres. We have not done so well this
year because we had heavy rains before Christmas after
the planting out. The rains made the ground hard,
and the plants did not mature.
5385. What is the biggest area planted by a single
grower?— Mr. Hunt cultivates four acres.
5386. Who would be the biggest grower in South
Australia?— Mr. Gordon. He and two other growers
are not members of our company.
5387. Do you wish to make a statement to the com-
mittee? —Yes. About three years ago, when the move-
ment for the establishment of our barns was inaugu-
rated, a fair amount of enthusiasm was shown in regard
to the growth of tobacco. We approached the State
Government and, in conjunction with the Tobacco
Growers’ Association, it was agreed to give a prize of
£5O for the best acre of tobacco. The prize was made
up of £25 contributed by the Government and a similar
sum given by the association. Various growers agreed
to plant about 50 acres in all, but only about 14 acres
were actually planted. So far as the committee of the
association knew, the only barns available were one
owned by Mr. Hunt and one belonging to Mr. Gordon,
of Paris Creek, who was a member of the association
in that year. Mr. Lough was lent by the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company to judge the crops.
As it was then getting on towards curing time there
were not sufficient barns available for the curing of
the leaf. Of course, the committee of our association
had to look round, and it was then decided to form a
co-operative company. We again approached the
Government and received sympathetic assistance. The
Government agreed to advance us £5OO under the
Industrial Provident Societies Act, We called for
tenders, and had two barns built and also a bulking
shed. It was then necessary for us to obtain a curer.
We wrote to the State tobacco experts in Hew South
Wales and Victoria asking them if they could recom-
mend a man for the job. About six names were sub-
mitted to us, and we chose Mr. B. W. Howell, of Hew
South Wales. He was quite satisfied with our leaf,
but he w T as rather surprised to find that it was all being
cured in one place. He was under the impression that
it would be cured on the various farms. Having a
curer of our own in view we got Mr. Charles Hunt to
give his assistance. Mr. Howell gave Mr, Hunt all the
information he possibly could. In that season we did
not have as much leaf as was anticipated from hte
area planted, and the company made a considerable
loss. Previous to that a deputation waited on the
then Minister for Agriculture. Two members com-
prised the deputation, and they were assured that we
would be helped in regard to any loss on that year’s
operations. That was conveyed verbally to our mem-
bers. We have submitted a request for £lOO to meet
our loss in connexion with curing, and about £2O in
wages paid for assistance, but so far no portion of that
loss has been made up to us. In the next two years
there was a failure in the local leaf, so far as Mount
Barker was concerned. At the beginning of the pre-
sent season we did not know what was going to happen.
We again approached the Minister for Agriculture in
the Liberal Government, and pointed out that the
activities of our members were to a great extent experi-
mental, and asked that the Government should try to
obtain financial assistance from the Commonwealth
grant. We were promised sympathetic consideration
of our request. We were referred to the State Bank
with regard to our financial position. A little later we
met the manager of the State Bank, Mr. Warren, and
one of our suggestions was that the interest on the
£5OO should be waived until we felt ourselves making
progress. Mr. Warren told us that the best thing for
us to do was to close down. He added that tobacco-
growing in South Australia was no good. We hold
that the manager of that hank, sitting in his office,
was not entitled to express that opinion. We went home
rather discouraged. However, we held a meeting of the
committee, and the matter of finance was again dis-
cussed. Mr. Warren wanted us to agree at the meeting
to an undertaking that we would not call up any further
capital to go on with our job. We had to either go into
liquidation or make another call on our members. We
wrote to the State Bank asking for permission to make
a call. The reply received was a refusal. The hank
authorities said that if we made a call against their
wishes they would know how to proceed in the future.
We then got our solicitor to inspect our mortgage, and
he could find no clause giving the State Bank power
to refuse our request for permission to make a call, and,
of course, we did so. Whether we shall have to go
into liquidation or plod on depends now on the pro-
gress of the industry. Ultimately, our capital will he
used up. Our expenses are practically the interest
owing to the State Bank.
5388. By Mr. Morgan. —What is your available
capital now?—We have no unexpended balance. The
sympathy of the Government Department appears to
have fallen off.
The witness withdrew.
Robert Colin Scott, supervisor of experimental work,
Department of Agriculture, South Australia, was
called, sworn and examined.
5389. By the Chairman. —You have charge of the
tobacco investigation work in South Australia ?—Under
the Director of Agriculture, yes.
5390. What have you been doing in that capacity?
—The report that the Director read was my report
dealing with the activities of the Department in regard


to agriculture in this State. We have no tobacco
expert, but we deal with tobacco as an unproved crop,
and from that point of view it comes under my super-
vision.
5391. Have you studied tobacco yourself?—As part
of my duties, yes. I have studied the writings of Mr.
Temple Smith and Dr, Darnell-Smith, I have had
correspondence with Mr. Slagg and similar authorities.
5392. Have you gone among the growers?—As far as
lies in my power I give instructions and visit the
growers regularly throughout the year. I refer to
Mount Barker and the adjacent districts.
5393. How many growers are there in the State?—
Eleven, apart from the men who are growing small
plots for the Investigation Committee.
5394. Do you keep any statistics of the production
from year to year?— Only so far as excise duty is
concerned.
5395. How much leaf was produced last year?—A
few cwt. In 1928 the production amounted to four
tons. There will be a bigger acreage this year.
Approximately 40 acres have been planted, and the
yield should be between 400 and 500 lb. per acre, or
about eight tons.
5396. Are the growers taking a greater interest in
the industry ?—One of the main troubles is that
tobacco culture is not undertaken in South Australia
as a whole-time job. Our best growers are those who
are giving the closest attention to the cultivation of the
crop. The smaller growers do not give it the attention
that it deserves.
5397. Are the growers satisfied with the prices
received?— Generally speaking, they are well satisfied,
but in years when we have a very light crop it leads
to a certain amount of dissatisfaction if the tobacco
is sent to Melbourne and purchased there and a certain
percentage is rejected. If the buyer operates on the
spot the growers are generally well satisfied. Last
year, for instance, it was not worth while the buyer
coming to South Australia.
5398. The State has ten acres where experimental
work is being conducted and the Commonwealth is
interested in it?— Yes, in so far as Mr. Slagg has helped
us with advice, but it is all State expenditure.
5399. What is happening there? —We imported a
number of varieties from different countries as well
as a number of the best American varieties supplied
by Mr. Slagg. These are grown on small areas and
the leaf harvested from different plots is kept separate.
The leaf is sent to the Federal Investigation Committee
for smoking tests. We are also making a variety of
tests of fertilizers such as superphosphate alone, super-
phosphate and potash, and also superphosphate, potash
and nitrogen. We have a report of the first year’s
experiments.
5400. How often has Mr. Slagg visited you?— About
twice a year he goes through the tobacco growing
areas. He may be in the office more frequently than
that.
5401. Do you find tbat the growers taken an interest
in the experiments? —Yes.
5402. Is there any likelihood of an extension of the
industry in South Australia ?—To a certain extent,
the Department can be blamed for holding the industry
back. We have treated tobacco as an unproved crop.
Although we will assist anybody who wishes to go in
for it, we are not recommending its cultivation.
5403. If a grower wanted to go in for it, what would
you tell him?—l should want to know where he in-
tended to grow it. I should point out that certain
growers have been receiving so much per acre, and I
should tell him that if he was prepared to grow tobacco
we would help him, but I would not advise him to take
it up with a guarantee that he would succeed. I
should leave the matter entirely to his own discretion.
5404. Do you say that there is good money in the
industry or do you point out the danger of loss of
crops through droughts and pests?—l draw attention
to what our growers have got in certain seasons, and
I also mention that in seasons like last year they have
had an absolute failure. I would point out what the
general average return has been, and if a farmer con-
tinues with that knowledge, we gladly help him.
5405. On ten acres you have been trying out different
varieties?—We have kept a record as to how they grow
in the field, but we think it would be wrong to publish
the results of two years’ experiments, one year having
been a very poor season. We have published articles
in the Agricultural Gazette, dealing with the best
methods of raising plants in the seed beds, and we
have also published a progress report of the work in
hand.
5406. By Mr. Jones. —How has £3OO been spent, as
stated by the Federal Tobacco Investigation?— Largely
on two curing barns, one at Mount Barker and one
at Mount Gambier. Every grower who looks after a
plot for the committee receives £5 if the tobacco is
grown to our satisfaction.
5407. By Mr. Slagg. —ls not the Investigation Com-
mittee co-operating with the South Australian Depart-
ment of Agriculture in the field experiments and bear-
ing a portion of the expenditure such as Mr, Hunt’s
salary?— The salary of the curer is paid by that
committee for all work done in the curing of the leaf
grown on the experimental plots, and the whole of the
work is done in co-operation with Mr. Slagg and that he
knows what varieties we are testing and is prepared
to continue the tests to bring them to completion in
regard to the smoking qualities of the leaf.
The witness withdrew.

(Mr. W. W. E. Swinson, representing the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company; Mr. O. M. Slagg,

Charles Mervyn Slagg, M.Sc., Director of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, was recalled and
further examined.
5408. By the Chairman. —l understand that you
desire to make a statement in connexion with the new
curing process of Panlook Bros. ? —I have prepared for
the information of the committee the following report
on a process of flue-curing tobacco evolved and being
used by Panlook Bros., of Eurobin, Victoria:—
Following receipt of a request from the chairman of the
Select Committee, the director of Tobacco Investigations per-
sonally inspected this curing process in operation on the
farm of Panlook Bros., Eurobin, Victoria, on the 4th May,
1930. The process had also been previously inspected by Mr.
G. E. Marks, assistant agronomist on the staff of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, who is at the present time
engaged in a more careful study of the system with a view
to ascertaining its possibilities.
Panlook Bros, are large hop-growers, and Mr. William
Panlook has experimented for a number of years in evolving
methods of handling and drying which would ensure the pro-
duction of a uniform and high quality grade of hops. In
this effort he appears to have been quite successful, and
this success with hops led him to hope that the same or


similar methods of artificial drying under forced circulation
of air could be adapted to the flue-curing of tobacco. For a
number of years he has been experimenting along these lines,
and a number of tests which failed were carried out. It is
not relevant at present to discuss the previous methods which
did not achieve success, other than to point out that the
factors involved were different from those encountered in
drying hops, and required different methods.
The present method varies from the ordinary methods of
flue-curing tobacco in that the curing kilns are fitted with a
system of forced circulation whereby air can be either drawn
through or forced through the hanging tobacco at any desired
rate. By opening or closing the ventilator at the top of the
kiln, and by the forced circulation of air through the kiln
at varying rates and temperatures, it is possible to exercise
a considerable degree of control over the humidity in the air
among the hanging tobacco at different stages of the cure.
In the present system, although heat and forced circulation
are used in conjunction with each other, the heating units are
entirely separate from the air circulating apparatus.
The heating system is comparable to that used in other
kilns in the Myrtleford district, excepting that the furnaces
are larger and the heat is distributed inside the kilns by
flue pipes which are more numerous and closer together than
is usual. The forced circulation of air is obtained by means
of a fan which draws air through a conduit built to the
top of the kiln and which fan drives this air back through
the hanging tobacco by means of another conduit leading
under a false floor under the hanging tobacco. When it is
desired to lower the humidity in the barn the air shaft from
the top of the kiln which leads to the fan may be closed,
in which case the air is driven through the hanging tobacco
and passes out of the kiln through the top ventilator. Vary-
ing degrees of heat may also be used as a partial means of
regulating the humidity.
The system as at present in use consists of a series of four
kilns as shown in figures 1 and 3 (which are submitted)
each 20 feet x 20 feet x 18| feet in dimensions, constructed
of galvanized iron inside and out, over 2-in. x 4-in. studs.
The space between the iron is filled with earth as far as
the eaves, and the space between the iron on the roof is
filled with malthoid roofing paper. Each of these kilns is
fitted with a large central ventilator at the peak of the roof,
which is 6 feet in diameter, and may be opened to any desired
width. The heating units for each kiln consist of two brick
furnaces, 4 feet x 4 feet x 8 feet in dimensions, fitted with
fire boxes each 2 feet wide by 15 inches high and 6 feet long,
with 1 foot space below the grate bars. The iron flues inside
the kiln which distribute the heated air consist of sixteen
pipes per kiln, each pipe 15 feet long and 12 inches in
diameter. This leaves a space of approximately 4 inches
between each of these heat pipes inside the kiln. The power
for the forced circulation units is derived from a 3 horse-
power McDonald super Diesel crude oil engine, driving a
counter shaft running the full length of the row of kilns.
This power is transferred from the counter shaft to the fan
units by means of pulleys and belts. The engine and fan
units are shown in Figure 2 (which is submitted). Each
kiln is equipped with a separate fan and system of air shafts
which supply the forced circulation, and each kiln may be
operated entirely separate from its neighbour.
Mr. Panlook believes that by the use of this system he Is
able to yellow tobacco in the kiln to a greater degree and for
a longer time without damage to the leaf, and also that he
is able to complete the curing operation at a much lower
temperature (about 130° F.) than is ordinarily used in flue-
curing of tobacco. He also believes that he is able to secure
a larger proportion of bright leaf than would be possible
under the ordinary system of flue-curing.
At the present time the Australian Tobacco Investigation
is carrying out a co-operative curing test with Mr. Panlook
in an effort to secure data on some of these points, and to
find out the temperatures and humidities which actually
obtain in the kiln under the conditions which Mr. Panlook
has been using. Duplicate curings of tobacco harvested
from the same field and at the same time are being carried
out side by side in similar kilns, one of which is operated
in the ordinary manner, and the other by means of the forced
circulation apparatus. Later, it is hoped to carefully grade
this tobacco and to obtain data on the colour, texture and
smoking qualities of the leaf as cured by the two methods.
The soil upon which Mr. Panlook’s tobacco was grown
varies from a light silt loam to a sandy loam, and is perhaps
more suitable for flue-cured tobacco than much of the soil
at present used in the Myrtleford district. Examination of
a number of bulks of tobacco already cured by Mr. Panlook
indicates that he has secured a fair proportion of bright
leaf.
In conclusion, it may again be stated that the main
principles involved in this process of curing consist of a re-
circulation of moist air through the hanging leaf w r ith
tightly closed ventilators during the yellowing process and
a forced circulation of dry air through the curing leaf and
out through the top ventilator during the later periods of
fixing the colour and killing out the leaf. The humidity and
temperature to he used at different periods of the cure in
order to obtain the best results have not yet been ascer-
tained. The costs of installation, the cost of operation,
and the working economy of the system have not yet been
worked out.
Nevertheless, it is the considered opinion of the director of
investigations that the system is a step in advance, and holds
great promise, in that it offers a greater measure of control
of conditions in the kiln during the flue-curing process than is
obtainable under the system at present in use.
The witness withdrew.
Temple Alsop Jennings Smith, Tobacco Expert,
Department of Agriculture, Victoria, was recalled
and further examined.
5409. By the Chairman. —Do you desire to give
further evidence? —I have prepared a statement giv-
ing a description of the barns used by Mr. Panlook.
I visited these barns with the Assistant Minister for
Agriculture towards the end of April and have since
sent my understudy to take measurements and further
particulars, which are embodied in my report. The
improved method was mooted by Mr. Panlook three or
four years ago. He and I, and also Mr. Marks, then
Assistant Tobacco Expert for Victoria, went into this
matter with Mr. Panlook very fully. We do not wish
to take any credit away from Mr. Panlook, because he
has worked out the system and gone to the expense
of proving it, but in matters of principle we were able
to help him to some extent. My report is as
follows: —
Mr. W. Panlook, of “Rostrevor,” Eurobin, has this season
applied a new system to the curing of tobacco leaf which so
far has given very encouraging results. The barns used
by Mr. Panlook are of the ordinary type which has been in
use in the Ovens and King valleys for a number of years.
These barns are constructed from timber and corrugated
iron, the dimension being 20 ft. x2O ft. x2O ft. The barns
are lined inside and out with iron, the space between
being filled with sand to prevent any escape of heat and
moisture or inlet of air, and generally to make the barns as
air-tight as possible. The inside of the roof which is of
the “ hip ” type is lined with rubberoid. Mr. Panlook’s
principle is as follows; —
1. Recirculation of warm moist air during the sweat-
ing or colouring process, which takes about 36 hours.
2. Forcing warm dry air through the tobacco during
the fixing and drying out periods which occupy three to
four days.
The reticulation of the moist air and forcing the dry
air through the barn is done by means of a suction force fan
16 inches in diameter. During the recirculation of the warm
moist air the sucker illustrated in the accompanying diagram
is brought into use, as w T ell as the sliding ventilator in the
wall, which is open, and the outside inlet, which is shut. The
air is conveyed from the fan to an air chamber situated
below ground level by means of a down pipe 15 inches in
diameter. The air is released into the chamber but cannot
immediately escape up through the hanging tobacco. This
is done by means of a baffle plate. The baffle plate is
constructed from sheet iron and covers the whole of the floor
area. In this plate holes 2 inches x 3 inches are staggered,
and by means of these holes a very even distribution of the
air is attained.
By recirculating the warm moist air through the barn and
incidentally through the hanging leaf, each leaf is receiving
practically the same treatment and the yellowing is pro-
ceeding at the same rate through the whole barn. As is
the case in most of the barns in use at present, it is impossible
to maintain the same temperature throughout the barn as
Mr. Panlook is able to do. This evenness of temperature is
very necessary in order to get a good cure.
When the desired degree of yellowness has been attained,
the recirculation of the warm moist air is stopped by means
of shutting the sliding ventilator in the wall (see diagram)
and opening the outside inlet ventilator and forcing hot dried
air through the tobacco, at the same time opening the
ventilator situated in the centre of the roof. This warm, dry
air absorbs the moisture left in the shed from the yellowing
process, and by means of this process this moisture can be
removed within two hours. As the temperature is gradually
increased during this process of fixing and drying the tobacco


the moisture which collects on the leaf is removed as soon
as it reaches the surface and is carried away. This
moistxire if allowed to remain on the leaf will cause the leaf
to sponge.
By this method of curing it is possible to dry out a barn
of leaf at a temperature of 125° F. This means that the
enzyme contained in the leaf is retained as they are
not destroyed at this temperature. Under the old method
of curing, the leaf is dried out at temperatures ranging up
to 170° and 180° F. By retaining this life in the leaf
it is possible to further process the tobacco after removal
from the curing barn by means of a necessary fermentation.
When a barn of leaf has been cured, it is possible by means
of introducing a steam-pipe into the outside inlet ventilator,
and by means of the fan forcing it up through the baffle-
plate and so into the barn, to take a barn of leaf out in
two hours. The temperatures at which this system works
are as follows:-—
Recirculating or yellowing process, 85° to 95° F.
Fixing of colour, 105° to 115° F.
Drying of leaf, up to 125° F.
After colouring the leaf at a temperature of, say, 90° F.,
it is possible to raise the temperature to 105° F. in an hour
to an hour and a half without doing any injury to the leaf.
Another point of interest is that where leaves are fairly
close on the stick there is no sign of “sponging,” which in an
ordinary shed under the present system of curing is very
common. This goes to show that the air is very evenly
distributed and circulated through the hanging leaf during
the yellowing and fixing stages of the cure. Also every leaf
is definitely one grade or another; that is, there are no
leaves showing two grades, as is often the case under the
ordinary system of curing. Again, the curing time is cut
down by nearly two days and the consumption of wood for
heating is considerably reduced.
The cost of installing this system is not exorbitant, and is
well within compass of most growers.
In my opinion this new system will lead to considerable
improvement in the curing of tobacco and the per-
centage of bright leaf produced. Under the old sys-
tems the temperatures in the barns, the currents of air,
and the humidity could not be controlled, but under
this system there is much better control and that must
lead to a better class of tobacco being produced.
5410. Have the growers in the district taken a keen
interest in this new T system?— Yes. At the meeting
held there, attended by the Minister for Agriculture
late in April, the growers were most enthusiastic.
They spoke of Mr. Panlook as a public benefactor, and
the general opinion was that this system would lead
to much better results in the curing, particularly of
the heavier tobacco grown on the richer soils,
5411. Do you think it will revolutionize methods
of curing?—l would not go so far as to say that, but
it should result in a great improvement on the present
system. Anything that wdll enable the grower to con-
trol his curing methods to a greater degree than under
the old system must be an improvement. I think the
improvement will be largely noticed in greater per-
centage of bright leaf, and it is quite possible that the
smoking quality of the leaf will be improved. It may
be found that such leaf, after fermentation, may make
an improved smoking quality of tobacco, whereas it
was not possible to ferment leaf cured out at 170° or
180° to the same extent owing to that temperature
killing the enzyme life in the leaf.
5412. Would it be possible for other growers to adopt
this system?— Yes; once they have been taught it I
think it will be much easier for them to cure their
tobacco than it has been in the past.
5413. If Mr. Panlook patents his process, it will
mean that no grower can use it unless he pays a royalty
or purchases his outfit from the company that will pro-
bably be brought into existence?—l talked that matter
over with Mr. Panlook, and he told me that if he could
get a patent for the system, about which he seemed to
think there was a doubt, his idea was to charge a
royalty for his labours and brainwork to all persons
using that system of curing.
5414. Has this principle been investigated previously
before Mr. Panlook applied it in a practical way?—
It is not quite a new idea. It was talked over several
years ago. Mr. Panlook attempted to cure tobacco
in his hop kilns. In the first attempt, six tons of
tobacco was spoiled, hut later he improved on the
system, but did not get it anything like so perfect as
it is to-day. He has been working on this system
for several years, but I do not know of the same
system having been applied in any other part of the
world.
5415. By Mr. Slagg. —Do you think that flue cured
tobacco finished at 125° would ferment?— Yes.
5416. You think that ordinary flue cured leaf
finished at, say, 170° to 180° would not ferment?—l
would not say that. I would say that a very mild
process of sweating or fermentation may take place in
leaf that is cured at a high degree of heat, but the
enzyme which sets up fermentation is said to be killed
at 130°, and if the tobacco can be cured at any degree
of heat below 130° the ferment in the leaf would
probably operate to a greater degree during such
process.
5417. Are you aware that there are some types of
tobacco which will ferment at a higher temperature
than 130 degress?—l have just said that I believe
that tobaccoes cured at over 130° go through a mild
form of fermentation, but not to the same extent as
those cured under 130°.
5418. How do you define fermentation?—lt is due
to a ferment or enzyme in the leaf in conjunc-
tion with a certain amount of moisture and a cer-
tain degree of heat. With cigar leaf, particularly,
which is fermented to a greater degree than other
tobaccoes, we know that the leaf is placed in bulk
with 20 to 25 per cent, of moisture. The temperature
is kept at about 80 degrees. The bulk is covered to
keep that moisture in. The temperature will rise
several degrees each hour owing to fern* ‘ntation until
it reaches over 130°, if allowed, but it is pulled down
and re-built before it reaches that temperature. It is
sometimes put through three or four fermentations be-
fore fermenation ceases.
5419. You would say that the main feature about
the fermentation of tobacco, as in many other types
of vegetable matter, is a rise in temperature?—l have
not said anything of the kind. I have said that fer-
mentation is due to the ferment in the leaf, which,
together with the degree of moisture and other con-
ditions, helps to cause a rise in the temperature.
5420. The word “fermentation” as applied to the
curing of tobacco, is one that you would agree has been
largely misused?—lt is known as fermentation, and I
have described the process.
5421. You also agree that flue-cured tobacco as such
does not ferment?— Hot to the same degree as tobac-
coes cured under 130°.
5422. Do you think you could induce fermentation
at all in properly flue-cured tobacco?—l have never
attempted to do it, but it is generally supposed that it
goes through a mild fermentation in the bulk.
5423. Is it not a fact that the conditions necessary
for fermentation are that the enzymes in the leaf have
not been killed; that there is a proper temperature
present, and that there is a proper amount of moisture
present ?—lt has not been actually proved that those
are the only enzymes that cause fermentation. When
I was in the United States of America, I went into
that subject in the re-handling houses, and I was told
that they purposely put flue-cured tobacco down into
hogsheads, and that it went through a mild fermenta-
tion which improved its quality very greatly.
5424. In your opinion, does flue-cured tobacco go
through a mild fermentation?— Yes. I think that
the improvement that occurs during ageing is partly
due to mild fermentation.
5425. Are you aware that that is a slightly different
idea of the fermentation of tobacco from that usually
accepted?—Ho; lam not. It seemed to me to be the
generally accepted view T .


5426. By the Chairman. —Were you kept advised by
the Investigation Committee as to the procedure being
adopted in the selection of sites for experimental plots
in Australia?— Ho.
6427. Did you know that the committee had decided
to experiment very extensively at Mareeba?—l knew
there were experiments, but I was not aware of their
nature.
5428. You were informed by the committee that it
had been decided practically to concentrate the first
three years experimental work at Mareeba?—Ho. I
understood some experiments were being carried out
in other parts of Queensland.
5429. The evidence is that over £4,000 has been ex-
pended in field experimental work in the various States
in the last two and a half years, and more than £3,000
of that has been spent at Mareeba ?—I was not informed
of that fact by the Investigation committee.
5430. Did you ask it to carry out any extensive ex-
periments in Victoria?—l worked with Mr. Slagg in
carrying out such experiments as were conducted in Vic-
toria prior to the past season. I certainly saw a good
deal of Mr. Slagg, and we discussed the various dis-
tricts. As a matter of fact, I provided him with the
names of certain areas where I thought experiments
should be made.
5431. Were you dissatisfied with the amount of ex-
penditure in Victoria?— Yes; it seemed very small as
compared with Queensland, and the growers were under
the same impression. They thought that their dis-
tricts were not getting as much attention as Queens-
land, which was practically an unproved part of
Australia.
6432. Did you inquire as to the reason for that dis-
crimination?—Ho; I did not think it was my business
to do that.
5433. Did you complain to the Director of Agricul-
ture in Victoria? —I certainly informed him. He was
a member of the Investigation Committee.
5434. What experiments have been carried out in
Victoria by that committee?— For the first two years,
variety tests were made in about seven districts, namely,
Shepparton, Gunbower, the Horth-Eastern district, on
the Wahgunyah State Hursery, and several places in
Gippsland such as Murrangower, Cann River, and
Orbost.
5435. Were they carried out under your supervision ?
—Partly. They were simply tests of seven varieties;
practically no manurial tests were made at all.
5436. Do you know anything about the Mareeba tests ?
—When I was cm the survey party with Messrs. Tre-
genna, Howell, and Bainbridge, Mr. Tregenna told me
he had discovered a place in Queensland where the
right class of tobacco could be grown equal to anything
in America. He left the survey party when we were up
in Queensland in the early stages of the survey. He
and Mr. McGee went to Mareeba about August, 1927.
I drove Mr. Tregenna from Texas to Stanthorpe when
he met Mr. McGee and went north.
5437. How long previously had he told you he knew
of this place?—A few days previously. I did not know
whether he had ever seen it them.
5438. Was it understood on that occasion that Mr.
Tregenna and Mr. McGee were to go on this explora-
tory trip?—l knew nothing about it until Mr. Tre-
genna told me that he was going from Texas. As a
matter of fact, Mr. Tregenna was very little with us
on this survey.
5439. How long were they away on this northern
trip ?—I cannot say. Ido not know whether Mr. Tre-
genna returned immediately to the survey party or not.
I think he rejoined us about a fortnight later at Tam-
worth
5440. Can you say whether they went north on that
occasion to inspect Mareeba or to make a general is-
spection of northern and central Queensland? —I can-
not say. I should certainly have thought that they
went to make a general survey.
5441. As a member of the survey party were you not
entitled to know what they were doing?— Ho. I could
not direct Mr. Tregenna’s movements. He told me he
was going up there to inspect this land.
5442. If you had been going off to look at land would
you not have discussed the matter with the whole party ?
—I was left in control of the party. Mr. Tregenna was
nominally the head of the party from its inception.
5443. By Mr. Martens. —In whose interest did he go
to Mareeba. Was it in the interests of the survey party
generally ?—I do not know.
5444. When he came back did he report to the survey
party what he had discovered?— Ho.
5445. By the Chairman. —When he rejoined the
party at Tamworth about a fortnight later, was Mr.
McGee with him?—l think not; I believe Mr. McGee
went straight on to Sydney.
5446. Did you ask Mr. Tregenna what happened in
Queensland ?—Certainly; I tried to find out all I could.
5447. Did you get any information?— His informa-
tion was that it was the ideal spot for the production of
high-class leaf.
5448. Did he mention Mareeba?—Yes, certainly.
_ 5449. Would you say from your recollection of the
circumstances, and from what Mr. Tregenna said to
you during the trip, that when he left you he had
a definite idea of fixing on Mareeba as the one spot
in which tobacco could be grown in Queensland? —I
would not say that. He certainly seemed to have a
high opinion of the place, but what he thought of other
districts I could not say.
5450. We have the notes of a conference concerning
tobacco-growing in Australia held in Sydney at the
office of the Under-Secretary for Agriculture in Hew
South Wales on the 12th July, 1927. This conference
was attended by Mr. H. W. Gepp, Chairman of the
Development and Migration Commission; Mr. D, G.
Ross, Under Secretary, Department of Agriculture; Dr.
G. P. Darnell-Smith, and Mr. C. J. Tregenna. Accord-
ing to this report, Mr. Tregenna referred to the Queens-
land trip, and stated that he had never seen the country
in question. Therefore, it would appear that this was
Mr. Tregenna’s first visit to that country. Did you have
that impression?— Yes.
5451. Did he mention Mr. Pollock, Instructor of Agri-
culture in Horth Queensland? —Ho; but when he came
back he said that Mr. Pollock had a great deal of
tobacco under successful cultivation in Queensland.
5452. Had you ever met Mr. Pollock?— Hot to my
recollection.
5453. We had evidence from Mr. Pollock at Bris-
bane that when he met Mr. Tregenna and Mr. McGee
on that occasion they toured north Queensland exten-
sively. Mr. Pollock took them to certain country which
they investigated. He also took them to Mareeba. The
impression I got was that he was the gentleman who
had brought Mareeba under the notice of Mr. Tre-
genna. Then they left northern Queensland and went
to central Queensland, where they were met by Mr.
Brooks, Instructor of Agriculture" there. Mr. Brooks
said that they spent one day with him. Did they tell
you anything about these movemeints when they came
back? I did not see Mr. McGee on the return journey.
Mr. Tregenna did not give me a description of his
movements. He said that he considered Mareeba would
be “ the ” place for the production of bright tobacco.
5454. Were you not curious ?—Yes; I should like to
have seen Mareeba.
5455. Did you not think you were entitled to know
what the others were doing?——l think Mr. Tregenna
had received his orders from the Tobacco Investigation
Committee to make this inspection, partly with the
view of saving the cost of sending the whole party
there. f j


5456. Can you tell us what Mr. Tregenna said to
you?—l cannot remember his exact words, hut Ido
remember very clearly that he said he had found “ the ”
place in Australia which was going to grow leaf equal
to the best American bright leaf, and that was
Mareeba.
5457. That he had found it on that trip?—l presume
so.
5458. The notes which have been furnished to us of
the conference held in Sydney, to which I have already
referred, were supplied without any request that they
should be regarded as confidential. I bring under your
notice the following statements made during a discus-
sion as to the movements of the survey party:—
Mr. Gepp. —We must not upset Mr. McGee’s Myrtleford
work, and he must be there by the Ist September at the very
latest, I understand. He is going down to-morrow to Myrtle-
ford to start at his beds. Then he must be back, according to
Mr. Redding, by the beginning of September. That would give
you his services for four weeks in August. Would August
be any good for planting out in Queensland?
Mr. Teegenna. —Yes; you can plant out until the end of
September. You can sow seed up to the end of September in
Queensland.
I have known for years that the destiny of the tobacco in-
dustry is in the north, that is in Queensland. Although I
have never seen it, I am quite sure that the soil does exist
there, that poor soil which would be close to the edge of the
summer rainfall, not the heavy rainfalls of 70 or 80 inches,
but just on the fringe of the tablelands. If we ever get to-
bacco, it will come from there.
Mr. Gepp. —You should say “ When we get tobacco,” not “ if
we ever get it,” because I am sure that we will get it, and
within a few years.
Mr. Teegenna. —l think it will be done there.
From that statement it appears that Mr. Tregenna had
some information in regard to Queensland, although
he had never been there. Have you any comment to
make? —Ho; except that I think it was rather in-
judicious on Mr. Tregenna’s part to say he was quite
sure that that was the one place in Australia that would
produce good tobacco when he had never seen that
country. I would not like to pass such an opinion on a
place I had never seen.
5459. He told you he knew of this place before he
went there?— Yes, but I was not advised whether he
knew it personally or by hearsay.
5460. Did your curiosity quicken when you discovered
that the investigation work had been largely concen-
trated there ? The figures supplied by the Investigation
Committee show that for the period from Ist July, 1927,
to the 31st March, 1930, the expenditure on experi-
—Queensland, £3,150 13s. 9d.; Hew South Wales, £97
17s. 3d.; Victoria, £149 16s. lOd.; Western Australia,
experimental work in the various States had been as
follows: —£151 12s. 3d.; South Australia, £3OO ss. sd.
Of the total expenditure of £3,850, Queensland received
£3,150. Did you know of those figures?— Yes; but
only recently.
5461. During that period did you, as the State expert
in Victoria, consider it your duty to ascertain the
reasons for the great disparity, particularly as most of
this money was being spent at Mareeba? —I talked the
matter over with my Director, and I considered that
any objection or suggestion should come from him and
not from me.
5462. But you gave him your views about it?— Ce-
rtainly.
5463. In view of the fact that practically all the
money was spent at Mareeba, does it not appear that
no serious attempt has been made, outside Mareeba,
to explore the possibilities of tobacco-growing in
Queensland ?—lt certainly looks like that. I know that
during the first season six or seven or, perhaps, twenty
small plots were tried in north Queensland. I believe
Mr. Slagg has been there, and he probably considered
that Mareeba was the most promising place to conduct
the experiments.
5464. Have any steps been taken by your Agricul-
tural Department to look into the reasons for this dis-
parity?—l cannot say. I think I did what might have
been expected of me in presenting my views to my
Director, particularly as he was a member of the In-
vestigation Committee. I cannot speak directly for
him, but it is quite possible that he has pointed this
out to that committee.
5465. Suppose the whole of the federal investigation
were closed down this year, and that was the only result
produced, would you consider that the possibilities of
tobacco-growing in Australia had been thoroughly ex-
plored?— Certainly not. We have a territory in Aus-
tralia even larger than the United States of America.
We have a wonderful range of soil and climate, and
there must be many parts that will produce good to-
bacco in future. There are a great many parts of Vic-
toria that will grow good tobacco; some of them, per-
haps, better than any yet grown in this State.
5466. Did you consider that the Investigation Com-
mittee has justified its appointment by producing that
result in three years?—lSTo. As a matter of fact, I
have grave doubts about Mareeba. The first year’s ex-
periment, I understand, was practically a total failure
owing to the excessive rainfall. Only the other day I
aoticed in a Queensland journal that the rainfall at
Atherton during February amounted to 17.25 inches.
That is about 60 or 70 miles from Mareeba.
5467. When we tried to locate Mareeba, we were
unable to do so, because Messrs. Pollock and Howell,
and others, said that they spoke of a tremendous area
when they referred to Mareeba. You were disappointed
with the first year’s results? —I should say they were
very disappointing to everybody, and I cannot see why
such a season should not recur at any time. I came to
the conclusion that if growers there are going to ex-
perience anything like that rainfall in February there
is very little chance of their success. If we got half
of that rainfall in Victoria in February it would de-
stroy all chances of our crop.
5468. I have shown you a sample of Mareeba to-
bacco. With your knowledge of Victoria, do you
think that the prospects are equally as good in this
State? —It is very hard to judge on that sample. A
great deal depends on the yield and the security of the
crop. I have been told by people who know Mareeba
that they are very lucky to get 600 lbs. of cured leaf
to the acre. Of course, they would have to get a pretty
handsome price to make that pay, with the labour and
other conditions to be contended with there. Without
personal knowledge of the district, I point out that the
rainfall may prejudice the chance of their getting a
crop.
5469. Have you seen any manufactured tobacco in
Victoria made from Australian leaf equal to the sample
now before you of tobacco grown at Mareeba?—Ho.
5470. Do you still adhere to your opinion that there
is a bright future before the tobacco-grower in Victoria?
Yes. If we can get open competition in future, the dark
tobaccoes grown in Victoria will be driven out by de-
grees, or the greater proportion of them will, and the
growers will devote their attention to the lighter soils,
which will produce better types of leaf than those ob-
tained to-day.
5471. What are the real obstacles to the development
of the industry in Victoria?— Partly the excise duty.
In 1895 it was pointed out by growers, when the first
excise duty was put on, that that sounded the death-
knell of the industry. That duty was gradually raised
to 2s. 4d. per lb., which was higher than the import
duty of 2s. That was a very great handicap. That has
been in operation for over three years. Another handi-
cap is that the growers have been induced to produce
dark leaf by prices such as those paid last season.
It was a better paying proposition by 50 per cent, to
100 per cent, to grow the dark leaf, and this made it


difficult for the experts to push the industry on along
right lines. In my opinion, that is one of the great
mistakes made in the purchase of our leaf.
5473. So you endorse the present policy of the manu-
facturers to rule out the dark leaf, and buy only the
bright?— Yes. I have asked the manufacturers for
years to make it a better proposition to grow bright
leaf.
5473. Would you favour refusing to take any of the
dark leaf at all? —No. That would be hard on the
growers. In all countries there is a certain amount of
dark leaf produced. Where large tobacco plantations are
established to-day, it would be impossible for many of the
growers to get anything like 90 per cent, or 100 per cent,
of bright leaf from their crops. I certainly think that
the quantity of dark leaf taken will have to be reduced.
I do not expect the manufacturer to take leaf that he
cannot use, but there is a percentage of the consumers
who will smoke a certain quantity of dark tobacco.
5474. Do you think the growers in Victoria are now
honestly trying to meet the wishes of the manufac-
turers ?—Yes.
5475. Is your department assisting the growers in
every way? —Yes. Eor years we have been urging them
to aim at growing bright leaf all the time.
5476. Could you do any more if you had additional
financial assistance?—Undoubtedly-we could.
5477. In what direction?—We have been asked by
the growers to provide competent flue-curers in each
district, but that would be expensive.
5478. Are they asking the Government to pay?— Yes.
We have been asked to establish experimental farms in
each district. That is too big a request. It would
mean the provision of a staff on each farm. We find
that growers very often do not understand the object
of experimental work. We carry out experiments to
prove that certain things are wrong, as well as to show
that certain things are right; but the work is often
judged on the failures, although these may be of more
value to us than the successes.
5479. If the federal investigation were continued, how-
do you suggest it should be operated in conjunction with
the States? —Erom the very inception of this work the
tobacco-growers did not favour the present system.
They would have preferred to see the matter made
wholly a local one. In my opinion, the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research might handle the
whole business through a man like Dr. Dickson, who
could carry out the scientific work, leaving the prac-
tical field -work to be done in collaboration with a
scientific body by the various State officers.
5480. By Mr. Jones. —That would still be federal
control?— Yes. It is a federal matter.
5481. By the Chairman. —We have had evidence from
New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia
that they are strongly in favour of continuation of
federal control, and they are prepared to work in con-
junction with the Commonwealth. In New South
Wales, if there is sufficient federal control, they do not
propose to reappoint an expert, but merely field officers.
In the other States I have mentioned, they have no
experts?— There is certainly room for an extension of
scientific research in a young tobacco-growing country
like Australia. If States have not the necessary
machinery for conducting research work, it necessarily
becomes a federal matter.
5482. Do you favour the work being placed under a
federal Minister, such as the Minister for Markets, who
would be responsible for federal control? —That is
rather a difficult question for me to answer. I suppose
a federal Minister must necessarily be at the head of
such a concern as is suggested, but it seems to me that,
for continuity of research work, the Council for Scien-
tific and Industrial Research should be the permanent
body to control the matter, under the Minister who
provides the funds and places certain aspects before
Parliament when necessary.
5483. Are you in favour of the British and Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company participating in the federal
experiment ?—No.
5484. Did you make that statement in your previous
evidence ?—No.
5485. Will you give me your reasons for the view you
have just expressed?—-I do not think it is a wise
arrangement, because it has been looked upon with sus-
picion by growers, who think that possibly strings may
have been pulled in certain directions. In my opinion,
if the investigation were carried on entirely as a per-
manent federal matter, a great deal of the trouble and
suspicion that exists to-day would be removed.
5486. On the evidence we have up to the present
stage, there is very little ground for the suspicion of the
growers. The British-Australasian Tobacco Company
has not interfered in any way. It has come forward
handsomely with its substantial cheques ?—I do not say
that there is any ground for suspicion, but it does exist.
The growers were possibly hurt, too, when the Tariff
Board recommended that their request for an increased
duty be granted, and it was turned down.
5487. Do you know why it was turned down? —No.
5488. The excise officers reported that it w*as imprac-
ticable to comply with the request of the Tariff Board
that the reduction in excise should be handed back to
the growers, because they could not tell one man’s leaf
from that of another. The company, therefore, offered
to give a bonus. Do you consider that a sound reason?
—No. Under the Excise Act, the quantities of Aus-
tralian and imported leaf are weighed out before the
leaf goes into manufacture. Allowance is made for the
scraps and stems that come out of the leaf. A certain
quantity of manufactured tobacco is allowed for every
100 lb. of leaf manufactured into cigarette or pipe
tobacco. I cannot see any great difficulty there. The
import duty in England is very much higher than the
import duty in Australia, and there is no excise duty.
5489. What is the British import duty?—Bs. 2d.
per lb.
5490. But they don’t grow tobacco in England?—
They have made an attempt. The fact that we grow
tobacco here makes it all the more necessary that the
excise should be cut out. Where would the butter in-
dustry be to-day, if it had to submit to an excise duty
of 2s. 4d. per lb?
5491. If butter were sold in 2-oz. tins there would
be an excise duty on it?— There wnuld not be much
butter used, if the public had to pay an extra 2s. 4d. a
lb. for it.
0492. How are we to get the excise back to the
grower ?—lt will have to go through the purchaser.
In the past we had an import duty of 2s. a lb. and an
excise duty of 2s. 4d. a lb. If the excise had been
removed it would have given the Australian leaf a pre-
ference of 4s. 4d. a lb. To-day we have an import duty
of 35., and if the excise duty were abolished it would
give the Australian leaf a preference of ss. 4d. over the
imported leaf. That would naturally encourage the
manufacturer to pay more for the good Australian leaf
than he is prepared to pay to-day, and it -would enable
small manufacturers to come into the market and use
up a larger proportion of our dark leaf.
5493. Should not the excise be abolished on all manu-
factured leaf ?—No. It w T ould not give us quite so much
preference.
5494. Do you favour the abolition of the excise of
2s. 4d. a lb. all round, balancing up that loss by a
corresponding increase in the import duty?— That
would put us in a better position.
5495. By Mr. Morgan. —What about the consumer?
—lt does not matter to the consumer whether he pays
2s. 4d. as excise or as import duty.
5496. It concerns him if he has to pay a higher price


for his tobacco?— But many consumers would have a
much cheaper tobacco. Why would they have to pay a
higher price, even if the import duty were 6s. ?
5497. —Because 95 per cent, of the tobacco now con-
sumed is imported?— But it would encourage the use
of a greater quantity of Australian tobacco.
5498. It is asking the Commonwealth Government to
give up its excise revenue on tobacco. How are you to
give that back to the farmer?—ln my original report,
I asked for the abolition of the excise, and an additional
2d. on the import duty in order to balance the revenue;
but the price to the consumer would be the same.
5499. By the Chairman. —The only advantage would
be that the Government would save the salaries of excise
officers?— But the great advantage would be to the
growers and consumers of Australian leaf, because it
would make it worth while local manufacturers putting
a cheaper Australian tobacco on the market, and that
would increase the demand for the local leaf.
5500. The only advantage, over and above the pro-
posal to reduce the excise on Australian leaf, would be
the saving of the salaries of excise officers ?—That is so.
The Tariff Board recommended that a reduction be
made of 6d. on the two top grades of Australian leaf,
provided it could be passed on to the grower. To my
mind, it could only be passed on to the grower through
the purchaser. The British-Australasian Tobacco
Company agreed straight away to pass on a propor-
tion of the additional Bd., when it was put on.
5501. By Mr. Martens. —The survey party consisted
of four persons. By whom were they appointed?—By
the Tobacco Investigation Committee, under Mr. Gepp.
5502. Were they to report on any particular locali-
ties? —Our instructions were to report on all the exist-
ing tobacco districts in all States that were producing
tobacco.
5503. Were any particular places named?—At the
outset we were told to interview every grower in the dif-
ferent States. We had a questionnaire prepared, and
inquiry was made regarding the quantity of tobacco
grown, the value of the land, and the prices received
over a certain number of years. There were probably
100 questions. We found that that system was im-
practicable; we could not catch every grower. So we
took a number of growers in each section visited. On
more than one occasion the parties split up. For
instance, Mr. Tregenna, I think, went to South Aus-
tralia by himself. I did not go to the Mareeba district.
Mr. Howell and myself, and Mr. Bainbridge, were
practically together throughout the survey.
5504. At the conclusion of the survey, did you draw
up a report?— Yes.
5505. Who signed it?— Mr. Tregenna, Mr. Howell,
and myself. Mr. Bainbridge was sent to South Aus-
tralia before the report had been completed,' and, there-
fore did not sign it.
5506. Was any reference made to any of the plots in
Queensland other than Texas ?—I do not think so.
5507. Do you know who authorised Mr. Tregenna to
proceed to Mareeba? —Ho. He came up to Texas with
us. After a couple of days he said: “ I have to go to
north Queensland with Mr. McGee,” and that was the
end of it.
5508. There is no reference in the report to that? —
I do not think so.
5509. At any time have you thought of Mareeba as
an isolated place or as a huge territory?—l have re-
garded it as being a more or less isolated locality, and a
difficult place in which to obtain labour, as well as a
place where the climatic conditions arc risky; but I
cannot speak personally of it, because I have never seen
it.
5510. Messrs. Pollock and Howell told the committee
that they spoke of the whole district from Bowen to
Chillagoe, which is nearly 500 miles. I have a sample
of tobacco before me which is alleged to have been grown
at Mareeba, although it was really grown by Geary
brothers at Gim, 25 miles south of Townsville and
about 280 miles distant from Mareeba. It was grown
not very far from the salt water?—l thought Mareeba
was a district about 100 miles square.
5511. By Mr. Jones. —Have you seen any of the leaf
from Mareeba? —I saw portion of it in Mr. Slagg’s
rooms.
5512. Ho samples were sent to your department?—
Ho.
5513. Have you seen the leaf cured at Mr. Panlook’s
place under the new process?-— -Yes.
5514. Does it show a marked improvement over the
old process?— Yes. I think Mr. Slagg was right in
saying that Mr. Panlook had some soils on his farm
that were best adapted for the production of bright
leaf.
5515. Who supplied the funds for the work at Wah-
gunyah?-—-The cost has been shared between the State
and Federal authorities.
5516. You previously advocated the abolition of
the excise duty on Australian-grown leaf, making up for
the loss in revenue by increasing the import duty. Do
you now say that the other suggestion to abolish the
excise on all leaf, and add the excise that was levied on
American leaf to the import duty, plus a few pence
more, to make up for the abolition of the excise on
Australian leaf, would be preferable?—l think that
would answer much the same purpose. It would still
give the Australian leaf the additional preference we
ask for.
5517. Would not the latest suggestion simplify mat-
ters? —Yes. There might be a certain saving in getting
rid of the excise officers. Where a locker had to be
kept it would mean additional expense to small manu-
facturers entering into competition with one another.
5518. You said it has been assumed that the reason
why the recommendation of the Tariff Board for the
reduction in excise was not given effect to was the diffi-
culty in passing the reduction on to the grower. Would
not the other suggestion obviate that difficulty?— Yes.
I think it would have the same effect as the abolition
of the excise duty. If the import duty were increased
2s. 4d., and the excise were removed, there would still
be a preference of ss. 4d. in favour of Australian leaf,
and it would get over the difficulties mentioned.
5519. By Mr. Morgan. —l would conclude from your
statement regarding the survey party’s visit to north
Queensland, that Mr. Tregenna was sent there by the
Investigation Committee to look into the possibilities of
this land?—l do not know whether you are right or
wrong. I was under the impression that he had been
sent there.
5520. You did not say so in your evidence? —I think
I did. So far as I remember, he said “ I have got to
go.”
5521. When he reported to you unofficially what he
had discovered, did it impress you?— Yes.
5522. Was not the impression heightened by the
report of Mr. Slagg in bulletin Ho. 2 that the results
following on the experiments in north Queensland justi-
fied them?— Hot altogether. I knov/ the history of to-
bacco in Queensland. Years ago a quantity was grown
there, but for some reason or other the production has
gradually petered out to practically nothing. It is
40 years since cigar tobacco was first grown there, and
pipe tobacco was grown in southern Queensland. It
is said that blue mould was originally found in northern
Queensland. I know that the rainfall is excessive and
that the first year’s experiments were practically use-
less, owing to wet weather.
5523, Yet they definitely say that with modern
methods of drainage they can take advantage of the
rainfall in Queensland, and produce tobacco without
detriment to the crop ?—I sincerely hope they are right.


5524. They say they can take advantage of the
assured rainfall of north Queensland and produce a
type of tobacco which you say is the best sample of
Australian leaf you have seen made up in that way?—
I think it is early to say yet. It is quite possible that
the drainage may not be effective. It takes more than
one year to prove anything.
5525. I suggest that your evidence goes to prove that
the money expended in north Queensland has been
amply justified?—l do not think it has been proved.
If the same money had been expended in Victoria the
results might have been equally satisfactory.
5526. As a matter of fact the same amount of
money has been expended in the southern States in the
last financial year. To be more precise, £5OO more has
been spent both in Hew South Wales and Victoria than
in north Queensland. The figures for the 1929-30
period are as follows: —Western Australia, £1,700;
South Australia, £500; Queensland, £1,500; Victoria,
£2,000; Hew South Wales, £2,000. I do not suppose
you would say that the expenditure of £3,000 was un-
justified, seeing that new country was being broken?—
I have never hinted at the idea that it was not justified.
5527. It was suggested that, apart from the expen-
diture in north Queensland on experimental work, no
serious attempt had been made to explore the possi-
bilities of tobacco culture in Queensland; but, as a
matter of fact, the industry has been exploited for the
last 50 years ?—That is so.
5528. You admit that there may be no justification
for suspicion regarding the present arrangements with
lie British-Australasian Tobacco Company, but you
are prepared to break down an agreement that has
worked admirably?—l did not say that it had worked
admirably.
5529. You said it should be broken down? —Ho. The
growers in the first place were hurt because their re-
quest to the Tariff Board, which was favorably recom-
mended by that body, was turned down, and they were
not consulted at all as to whether the investigation
would be in their interests, or on what lines it should
proceed. They were not consulted as to whether they
would have a representative on the survey party. I
was practically forced upon that survey party by the
Minister at the growers’ request. They put up certain
conditions which were not complied with, and they felt
suspicious and personally disapproved of the whole pro-
gramme, To my mind, it would be wise to get rid of
that suspicion and make this an independent federal
investigation.
5530. Do you personally regard it as an unjust
arrangement?— Ho. Hot unjust, but inadvisable. It
would be advisable to make it a federal matter.
5531. It is a federal matter? —Ho. It is not a
Federal Government department.
5532. It is administered entirely by a Federal Go-
vernment department ?—nevertheless, it is administered
by Mr. Gepp.
5533. By the Chairman.- —But that is under the
Prime Minister’s Department?—-If you look into the
constitution of the Development and Migration Com-
mission, I think you will find I am right.
5534. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you say that that com-
mission is not a department under the Prime Minister’s
Department ?—lt is not a government department.
5535. The point advanced almost exclusively by wit-
nesses in connexion with the abolition of excise is that
it would be warranted only on the ground that it re-
verted to the grower. You are taking an entirely dif-
ferent view? —Hot entirely different; but I am taking
a different view. In my opinion, if the excise is
abolished it will enable other manufacturers to enter
the market. There will be open competition for Aus-
tralian leaf, and that will add to the value of the leaf
to the manufacturer. It would not be fair for the
grower to get the whole of that amount, because Aus-
tralian leaf requires more handling than the imported
leaf; but he should get his proportion of it.
5536. By the Chairman. —How do you know that it
takes more handling?—l have had evidence of that. I
know that Australian tobacco is not graded as the
American leaf is. It is often purchased with a large
amount of moisture in it. We have the evidence of the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company that there is a
larger proportion of midrib in the Australian leaf. I
have no reason to doubt that; but I want to see the
grower encouraged with a higher price for high-grade
leaf. That would tend to put the industry on a better
footing, and lead to the production of high-grade leaf.
5537. Do you think that the growers take much in-
terest in this offer of the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company of financial assistance in investigation work?
—I do not think so.
5538. Do you think they suspect that the investiga-
tion is dominated by the company, and is designed to
substantiate certain contentions of the company?—l
think some of the growers have that feeling.
5539. If that suspicion is unfounded, do you think
that the company should be encouraged to continue? —
In my opinion, it would be wiser if the company were
not involved in the matter at all.
5540. If the company is not given anything in return
for its contributions, and is proved to be actuated by the
best of motives, would it not be rather ungracious on
the part of the growers and of this committee to con-
temptuously refuse any further financial assistance ?—I
think that the object of the growers in going before
the Tariff Board was to get a reduction in the excise
duty. Then this proposal was put forward to prevent
that reduction, and the growers naturally resented it.
The growers want increased competition for their leaf,
and, in my opinion, that increased competition would
do much to put the industry on a better footing.
5541. If the committee is satisfied on the evidence
that there is nothing to substantiate the suspicion of
the growers that_ the company has sinister motives,
would we be justified in recommending that the com-
pany be asked not to participate further?— Ho. If
you can satisfy the growers that everything is all right,
it will be satisfactory.
5542. If we find that the growers are entirely on the
wrong track in this matter, would we be justified in still
recommending that the company should not further con-
tribute ?—-From the point of view of this committee I
do not think you would.
5543. By Mr. Martens. —The company is making a
very valuable contribution to this work. If we reported
that we were satisfied that there had been no improper
practice, the report would have a reassuring effect on
the growers?— Yes. I think the growers have great
faith in this committee.
5544. By the Chairman. —There has been considerable
expenditure, and the company has been contributing
two-thirds of it. Do you think that the Federal Go-
vernment should continue to make up the balance? I
would suggest that the Government provide the money,
if it is not obtainable elsewhere.
5545. You are in favour of the States participating.
Do you suggest that they be asked to make a heavier
contribution to make up any deficiency, should the com-
pany cease to contribute?— Yes.
5546. In South Australia the Director of Agriculture
said he would not be justified in recommending further
expenditure ?—Personally, I think that is a mistake.
The industry must be put on a proper footing, and it
will amply repay any expenditure incurred.
5547. If we find that the company is genuinely
anxious to get Australian tobacco, would it not'be rather
a good move on the part of the Government to invite
the company to continue to participate, despite this
fear in the mind of the growers ?—lf you can convince


the growers of the wisdom of the arrangement, it will
save a lot of trouble and smooth the path. If you could
see your way to abolish the excise duty, the growers
would be certainly satisfied with the arrangement, apart
from any suspicion they may have.
554-8. If we made such a recommendation would you,
with your knowledge of the company’s participation,
be perfectly satisfied that it was the right thing to do?
—Yes.
5549. Would you favour a representative of the
growers being appointed to the Investigation Commit-
tee ?—Yes.
5550. Would any good purpose he served by having
the growers mixed up in this investigation?— Yes. They
think that they have been kept in the dark most of the
time as to wdiat is being done. The appointment of a
representative would make for peace and remove sus-
picion.
5551. How could one man keep in touch with the
growers throughout Australia ?—A representative could
watch the growers’ interests as far as possible, if they
had a proposal to put before the Investigation Commit-
tee. They feel to-day that they are not represented.
5552. Do you favour the establishment of a federal
department to collate all the literature regarding to-
bacco and distribute propaganda amongst the growers?
—Most certainly. That is done in America.
5553. Should the States he able to collaborate with
that department?— They could, and most certainly
should do so.
The witness withdrew.
The cornmittee adjourned.

Mr. Martens
Charles Mervyn Slagg, M.Sc., Director of the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation, recalled and further
examined.
5554. By the Chairman. —I understand that you
have prepared a supplementary report for submission
to the committee ?—Yes. My report on the progress of
the investigations was presented by Dr. Eivett in
January. The present report deals with certain points
which have developed in evidence thus far given before
the select committee. In this report I speak my per-
sonal views as director, and they are not necessarily
the views of the executive committee.
5555, Although you state that the report represents
your personal views, I notice that you use the word
“ we ” ?—I have used the editorial “ we ”, hut I wish
the committee to understand that I am expressing my
own views. The report is as follows:
The Aim of the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
The aim of the Australian Tobacco Investigation is to im-
prove the tobacco industry. To this end all phases of the
industry will be studied, and it is not the intention of the
investigation to neglect any measures or experiments which
seem likely to yield results of value. However, in view of
the fact that at present less than 10 per cent, of the raw leaf
tobacco taken for manufacture is grown in Australia, it must
be apparent that for some time to come our main efforts must
be centred on production. Working in conjunction with the
States, we hope to improve the quality of leaf tobacco grown
in Australia to make it more acceptable to the manufacturers
and to the consumers, and we hope to increase the production
of such acceptable leaf to the point where at least the major
portion of the tobacco taken for manufacture in Australia
will be grown in Australia.
Extent to which Fobeign Leaf may be Replaced.
We do not believe that it will ever be possible to meet all
our tobacco requirements with locally-grown leaf. Despite
extensive efforts, this has not been done in any civilized
country. The peculiar smoking qualities possessed by leaf
tobacco from different parts of the world depend largely upon
certain inherent characteristics imparted to the leaf by the
soil upon which it is grown. In the present state of our
knowledge, it is impossible to duplicate exactly the smoking
aroma of any standard type of tobacco in any district not
closely adjacent to the home of the type.
We hope, however, by improved methods of culture and
curing, by use of suitable varieties and soils, and by control
of diseases, &c., to secure cured leaf tobacco with good tex-
ture and burn and with an aroma which, although different,
will be mild and not objectionable. Such leaf could be
blended with imported leaf in increasing proportions as the
smoking public became accustomed to it, and thus the tastes
of Australian smokers could be gradually educated to the
use of the local product. It should be recognized, however,
that to change the tastes of the consuming public in favour
of Australian-grown tobacco must be a gradual process. In
this matter the Australian Tobacco Investigation and the
States must work in close association with the manufacturers.
Rapid changes might endanger our tobacco manufacturing
industry, to the benefit of foreign manufacturers. Attempts
to dictate to the consuming public are likely to result in
failure, and may unduly prejudice consumers against the local
product.
Based on the knowledge of what other tobacco-growing
countries have accomplished, we may reasonably hope, with
improvement in quality, to supply at least 60 per cent, of our
domestic requirements. It is difficult to say how long a time
would be required to reach this position. Ten years would
be a short period. Much will depend upon the success of the
investigations at present under way.
COMPARATIVE QUALITY OF AUSTRALIAN-GROWN TOBACCO.
Some witnesses have found no faults in Australian-grow r n
leaf tobacco, and other witnesses have condemned it as almost
useless. In my opinion, the truth lies somewhere between
these two extreme views. The local product is neither as bad
as it has been painted, nor as good as its most ardent sup-
porters have averred.
Considering the bright flue-cured type of tobacco which we
are producing in Australia, and which forms the major part
of our imports for manufacture of pipe tobaccoes and cigar-
ettes, it must be admitted that far too large a proportion of the
leaf at present produced in the principal commercial growing
districts does not compare favorably with imported leaf, as
the leaf texture is coarse, the veins heavy, and the colours
dark. The smoking aroma is different from that of the im-
ported article, and in the heavier and darker leaves, is
usually strong and unpalatable. A certain proportion of the
leaf, however, is usable, and the hope of the present districts
lies in increasing the proportion of good textured, bright leaf
suitable for manufacture.
Some soils in the present growing districts, and some in new
districts may be better adapted for the production of bright
flue-cured leaf than those at present used. The tobacco in-
vestigation hopes to assist an increase of production on such
soils and in such districts.
Some evidence has been placed before the Select Committee
to support the contention that Victorian-grown tobacco would
compare favorably on the English market with leaf grown in
other parts of the world. This evidence is directly contrary
to reports on samples sent to England by the Australian
Tobacco Investigation in 1928, and also contrary to a report
recently received on samples of bright leaf sent independently
by a private grower. It may also be pointed out that the
samples on which evidence was presented to the select com-
mittee were sent in 1901 and 1921. Since 1921 there has been
a marked change in conditions on the British market. Due
to the preference of 2s. per pound accorded to any leaf pro-
duced within the Empire and marketed in England, there has
been a marked stimulation of imports of colonial leaf into the
United Kingdom. At present the stocks of colonial-grown
leaf which have been sent to England and stored in ware-
houses there, greatly exceed the demand; hence large quanti-
ties of unsold leaf which has been grown in Nyasaland,
Rhodesia and other parts of the Empire are stored in ware-
houses in London and Liverpool. Because of the excess of
supply over demand for many types of colonial leaf, the price
which has been paid for such leaf in recent years has not
been remunerative to the growers. For this reason many
growers who have been dependent on the sale of their tobacco
in England have been forced out of business. This has been
particularly true in Rhodesia.


Frank Watson and Company give us the following estimates,
based on average deliveries for 12-month periods from Ist
January to 31st December, 1928 and 1929 respectively, as
to the number of months stock of leaf tobacco from the
various Empire producing countries on hand in London and
Liverpool on Ist January, 1930:
Months.
Cyprus .. .. .. 81
Union of South Africa .. 64
Rhodesia . . . . . . 43
ISTyasaland .. . . . . 31
Canada . . .. .. 25
British North Borneo . . 24
British India .. . . 20
In connexion with the unsold supply of colonial stocks lying
in English warehouses the Select Committee should bear in
mind, when considering these estimates, that manufacturers
usually consider 24 months supply of leaf tobacco as being a
normal stock. When their supply of leaf of any type or
from any district exceeds that estimated to be used during
of 24-month period they consider that they are over-supplied
and they are not willing to increase their supplies of that
particular type unless it can be obtained at an exceedingly
low price. Remembering this fact it will be apparent that
Canada, British North Borneo, and British India are now
the only Empire producing districts whose tobaccoes could
expect to receive a normal price on the present British
markets. Nyasaland, Rhodesia, South Africa, and Cyprus,
have all exported excessive stocks of leaf tobacco to the
United Kingdom. It is obvious, therefore, that they will
need to curtail their growing activities to the extent of their
dependence upon the British market for sales, and in direct
proportion to the size of their surplus stocks of leaf at
present unsold in the United Kingdom. The following table
shows the amounts of leaf tobacco imported into the United
Kingdom from the United States of America, from Empire
producing countries and from all other countries for the
calendar-years 1926-1929 inclusive. These figures are compiled
from the monthly tobacco report and the monthly colonial
tobacco report of Frank Watson and Company Limited, issued
on 7th March, 1930.

From these figures it will be observed that the manufac-
turers of the United Kingdom are still dependent upon
American-grown leaf for the major part of their stocks. At
the same time it should be pointed out that the percentage
of Empire-grown tobacco actually taken for manufacture in
the United Kingdom has increased. During the same four-
year period, these percentages were as follows:
Percentage.
1926 .. . . .. 13.10
1927 .. .. .. 14.71
1928 . . .. .. 16.62
1929 .. .. .. 17.10
The figures indicate that there has been a slow but steady
increase in the use of colonial tobaccoes by manufacturers in
the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized
that there is a large over-supply of colonial leaf in storage
in the United Kingdom, and prices for such leaf are con-
sequently at a low level.
With further reference to the report recently forwarded to
us on samples of leaf tobacco which were sent to the Imperial
Institute, independently of our organization, by a grower
in one of the Victorian districts which, we feel, holds great
promise, the following quotation from the report may be of
interest to the Select Committee:—
“ We do not like the quality of the sample, but we think
there are quite good prospects for the tobacco in this
country, providing the faults that we have enumerated
can be got rid of, either as a cigarette tobacco, for which
a fairly thin leaf is needed, or as a mixed pipe tobacco,
when it can be a little more fleshy in the leaf without
being thick. With the type in its present state, in con-
junction with the over-production of Empire tobacco, which
at present exists, we should not like to put a valuation
on it, but if we had to we should say that, at the moment,
the tobacco, as it stands, is not worth, over here, more
than 6d. to 9d. per pound.”
The Tobacco Investigation has no knowledge of the quality
of the samples upon which the above statement was based,
but we have no doubt that this grower submitted cured leaf
of, at least, fair quality as far as his crop was concerned.
The present quotations on American-grown bright flue-cured
tobaccoes on the markets of the United Kingdom are as
follows;—
per lb.
Semi-bright .. . . . . Bd. to 15d.
Medium . . 16d. to 20d.
Good . . . . . . 20d. to 28d.
Fine . . .. . . . . 30d. to 38d.
These quotations may be borne in mind in connexion with
the abovementioned estimate of 6d. to 9d. on the Australian-
grown sample.
It may further be pointed out that the average price re-
ceived by growers of bright flue-cured tobacco in the United
States of America for the 1929 crop was in the neighborhood
of lOd. per lb., whereas, on the evidence presented to the
select committee, the average price paid to the Australian
grower for the 1928-1929 crop was, approximately, 2s. per lb.
In the evidence given before the select committee the word
“ Australian parity,” has been used as a description of the
price for Australian-grown leaf tobacco which one grower con-
sidered should be received. It appears that the grower giving
this evidence put forward the view that this Australian parity
price which should be paid, consisted of the cost per lb.
to land foreign-grown leaf in Australia, plus the 3s. per lb.
import duty. On this basis the amount received by the grower
for Australian-grown leaf would be well over 4s. per lb.
W hiist sympathizing with the wish of the tobacco-grower to
obtain as much as possible for his product, it should be
noted that such a system of calculating the price to be paid
for leaf tobacco is not followed in any part of the world.
For instance, there is an import duty on pipe-smoking and
cigarette leaf in the United States of America, of 35 cents,
or Is. SM. per lb., yet the grower last year received an
average of lOd. per lb. for his product. In Canada the
import duty on these same types of tobacco stands at 40 cents,
or Is. Bd. per lb., yet the average price received by the Cana-
dian grower for these types of tobacco was much less than
the import duty, probably averaging about lid. per lb. The
Republic of France prohibits the importation of leaf tobacco
except that required by the Government itself, but the average
price established by the Government for tobacco grown in
France during 1929 was set at 640 francs per 100 kilogrammes,
which, at the present rate of exchange, is approximately 6d.
per lb.
Fixing Psice on Tobacco Grown in France.
At one of the early meetings of the Select Committee a
question was raised as to the method of determining the price
per lb. to be paid the grower for leaf tobacco grown in France.
The Director of Tobacco Investigations has written to the head-
quarters of the French Regie in Paris requesting exact details
as to the methods by which the prices to be paid the growers
are arrived at. Up to the present time a reply has not been
received. There recently appeared, however, in the Revue In-
ternationale des Tahacs, for February, 1830, on pages 131-132,
a short article dealing with the fixation of the mean price
for the domestic tobacco crop of 1929. This article has been
translated as follows:
“ After the meeting of the parity Commission, agree-
ment not having been reached, M. Jules Gautier, president
of the Council of State, and president of the Parity Com-
mission, was called on as an arbiter to fix the average
purchase price of the domestic crop of 1929.
This base price has been fixed at 640 francs (per
100 kg.) as a result of his deliberations, of which those
preceding the decision follow:
‘ Considering, among other things, that since the
cost of production varies in different districts where
tobacco is cultivated and there are differences of
opinion relative to the valuation of the abovemen-
tioned cost, and that it cannot be contested that the
increased price of all primary products and manu-
factured articles used in agriculture, as well as the
scarcity and constantly increasing cost of hand
labour, must place on tobacco planters, as well as
other agriculturists, great uncertainty and outlay
without compensation, so that the cost of production
of tobacco, considered in its different items (aspects)
has clearly increased, and there are grounds to
believe that this increase may be permanent, there is
here a situation wdiich should be considered carefully,
at the time of the fixation of the mean price, if we
intend to continue to encourage and to develop a crop
which holds, among the agricultural products of
France, an important place. Considering always
that, as legitimate as may be the desire of the
tobacco planters to find in the base price a fair rew r ard
and increased profits, as the just remuneration for
their improvements and their labour, it is necessary
to abstain from all measures which may endanger


or upset the equilibrium of the industrial manufac-
ture of tobacco, the good functioning of which
interests the whole nation, it thus follows that it is
impossible to consider the price asked by the repre-
sentatives of the tobacco planters other than as a
general indication of their claims, but that it is
necessary to increase the price offered and maintained,
in the name of the administration, by its represen-
tatives.
It is decided that the mean price of tobacco shall be
fixed, for the 1929 crop, at 640 francs (six hundred and
forty francs) for all of the valuing commissions,
except that of the lower Rhone ’.”
The 640 francs is per quintal (220 lb.) and represents
approximately 6d. per lb. To receive that price the tobacco
must be graded as first-class; some tobacco is sold at lower
prices. From this statement one would gather the inference
that the average price for the domestic leaf tobacco grown in
France in the year 1929 was fixed by M. Jules Gautier, presi-
dent of the Council of State and also president of the Parity
Commission.
Under the monopoly or regie ” system the cultivation,
manufacture and sale of tobacco in France has been com-
pletely controlled by the Government since 1811. The follow-
ing table, taken from page 136 of the abovementioned issue of
the Revue Internationale des Tabacs, shows that they are still
dependent on outside sources for a large part of the tobacco
used in manufacture :
Value.

Purchased in colonies .. .. 5,895 .. 44,000,000
Purchased from foreign countries .. 26,665 .. 197,000,000
On the basis of the above figures it appears that the average
price paid by the monopoly in 1925 for leaf grown in France
was 1.86 francs, or 3.72 pence, per lb., while the average price
paid for colonial and foreign tobacco was approximately 3.4
francs, or 6.8 pence per lb.
The Effect of Ageing and Processing on Aroma in
Flue-Cured Tobacco.
Evidence has been given by Dr. Cameron to the effect that
in his opinion any deficiencies in the smoking qualities of
Australian tobacco may be due to faulty methods of packing
and ageing by the manufacturers rather than to any soil or
curing effects. This statment is unsupported by any evidence
secured by the Australian tobacco investigation, and is con-
trary to the data thus far collected. Tests as to the effects of
processing and ageing are at present under way, and all the
data thus far collected indicates that while certain smoking
qualities of flue-cured tobacco such as burn, ash, freedom from
“ bite ” or harshness, may be improved by ageing, the aroma
remains essentially the same in character.
In support of the theory that Australian tobacco should be
improved by ageing and processing, Dr. Cameron read into
the evidence the following paragraph from a personal letter
to the Director from Mr. L. F. Dixon, of Duke University,
Durham, North Carolina; —
“ Mr. Hall and I were greatly impressed with the
problem as evidenced by the tobaccoes and by the informa-
tion given by Mr. Moss. It appears to us to be one
largely of processing, and one which, in the light of work
done by us on the composition of various tobaccoes and
the trend of reactions involved in producing aroma and
smoothness, can very probably be solved by methods of
handling and processing.”
Later, further and official correspondence between Mr. Dixon
and myself occurred, and in connexion with the above
quotation, it is necessary, to correct any misleading impres-
sous, to quote the first paragraph from Mr. Dixon’s next
letter: —
“ Since my letter to you of November 7, 1928, I have
obtained from Mr. Frank B. Wilkinson, of the Office of
Tobacco Standardization, a sample of Australian tobacco,
the crop of which was doubtful (probably 1926), Since
analyzing it, although it is hard to draw conclusions from
tobacco of this age, I am convinced that the impressions
I gathered from the cigarette shown me by Mr. Moss
were erroneous.”
Mention has also been made of a report on methods of
packing and handling home-grown tobacco employed by Aus-
tralian manufacturers. This report was requested by the
executive committee on 19th November, 1929, and submitted
by the Director on 14th February, 1930. Copies of this report
are attached to the present evidence. The following discus-
sion is taken from pages 5 to 7 of the abovementioned
report: —
“ It may be noted that the cured tobacco reaches the
buyer in rectangular hessian-covered bales containing
approximately 200 lbs. of leaf. Each bale is supposed to
contain one grade of leaf. The growers usually class their
leaf in lemon, bright mahogany, mahogany and dark
grades. There appears to be a unanimity of opinion
among the firms at present purchasing leaf from the
F. 218. — 20
growers that the grading is deficient, and requires im-
provement. The largest buyers suggest more attention
to detail to secure uniformity in the pack, and suggest
improvement of methods of grading and packing tobacco
through tuition by experts on the farm.
All Australian leaf purchased undergoes regrading by
the purchaser before packing. The regrading done is
most extensive in the rehandling and packing plants of
the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. They state
that leaf grading is carried out in the lemon and bright
classes, but that generally hand grading is practised, the
growlers’ crops eventually being regraded into about fif-
teen grades, each of which is packed separately.
Of the three firms using Australian-grown leaf, one
does no re-drying of the leaf after it reaches his factory.,
one air-dries to “ 10 per cent, moisture content,” and the
third firm re-dries all its Victorian-grown leaf and most
of its New South Wales leaf at a temperature of 130° F.
140° F., using for this purpose the standard type
(Proctor) of re-ordering machine as used in America and
elsewhere. The moisture content of the leaf as it leaves
the re-drier, they state, is about about 15 per cent. This
is about the same as is adopted with American and
Canadian leaf packed for domestic use. The maximum
temperatures used are somewhat lower than applied to
American leaf. This may be due to the coarse texture
of much of the leaf handled.
One manufacturer reports that he packs and ages all
his domestic leaf in bulks of approximately 2,000 lb.
weight. Another uses this same method generally, but
puts some (presumably the better grades) in casks from
which he has emptied American leaf. The third and
largest purchaser packs and ages all his Australian leaf
after grading and re-drying in pine boxes from which the
American imported leaf has been removed. About 400 lb.
are packed in each box, and this manufacturer states that
liis firm adopts identically the same methods as are used
in America.
As regards the period of ageing given Australian leaf
before taking for manufacture, one firm reported using
leaf after six months ageing, with the average age of
leaf used about 12 months, and the maximum period of
ageing two years. Another firm reports that it only
uses leaf a year old and older if possible. The third and
largest manufacturers state that their Australian leaf
stocks at present receive an average ageing of four years.
They state, however, that they begin to use the lemon
and bright grades, of which there is a shortage, at the
end of twelve mouths.
All firms report some loss by mould due to excessive
moisture in some lots of leaf as received from the grower.
The losses from this cause do not appear to be large,
however.
Very little air-cured leaf is now handled by any of the
firms reporting, but where such leaf is handled it appears
to receive the same treatment as flue-cured tobacco.
In addition to replying to the eleven separate questions,
each manufacturer was requested to give his opinion as to
the relative value of the various processes used by his
firm, and as to the possibility of improving the quality
of Australian-grown tobacco through variation or alter-
ation of these methods. Only one firm, the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company, replied to this paragraph,
and their reply is quoted below:
‘With regard to the last paragraph in your letters, 1
we apply to Australian leaf the most modern methods,
and it receives the same treatment as our American
leaf. There is nothing further that we know of that
could be done by the manufacturers that would make
any improvement in the characteristics of Australian
leaf.
With regard to ageing we do think, for two
reasons, that it would be an advantage to have two
years’ stock of the bright leaf. In the first place, it
would help to ensure the continuity of supply of the
required type, which is essential, and secondly it
would help to tone down the harshness in the leaf.
At the same time we would like to make it quite
clear that while the ageing will mellow the leaf, it
will not alter or improve the character of the burning
aroma.’
From the information above discussed as derived from
the answers to our questionnaire, it is apparent that there
are some differences in methods of handling, packing and
ageing Australian-grown leaf tobacco as practised by the
three manufacturers reporting. It may be pointed out,
however, that the largest manufacturers, who purchase
and pack by far the largest part of our annual raw leaf
production, use modern methods of handling, packing and
ageing of their Australian leaf purchases. The use of
these methods doubtless ensures more uniformity in the
pack, and the more elaborate regrading should also ensure
greater uniformity in the manufactured tobaccoes. At
the same time we have no data at present on which to


packed in bulk without machine re-ordering would be
base an assumption that the aroma of flue-cured tobacco
inferior to that of machine re-ordered leaf. Such tests as
have been made indicate little or no difference in aroma
of samples packed in these two ways.”
Responsibility foe Experimental and Research Work of
the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
There has been a tendency on the part of some witnesses to
consider the work on the blue mould disease at present
being carried out by Dr. H. R. Angell of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research, with the assistance of
Mr. A. V. Hill of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, as
separate from the work of the Tobacco Investigation. It
should be made quite clear to the Select Committee that
this work is under the aegis and control of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, and of the Director of Investigations.
It is financed by the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
Contact with the work is maintained through a research
committee composed of the Director of Tobacco investigations,
Mr. C. M. Slagg (chairman) and the Chief of the Division
of Plant Industry of the Council, Dr. B. T. Dickson. The
general plan of the organization, scope of activity, &e., of
the Australian Tobacco Investigation are discussed in an
article on “ Tobacco Investigations ” published in the Feb-
ruary issue of the Journal of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research. Reprints of the article are attached
to this report for information regarding the exact arrange-
rhents and conditions under which the work of the Investi-
gation is being conducted.
Recent Changes in Smoking Tastes of the Consuming
Public.
There has been in evidence a feeling that the Australian
tobacco manufacturers were discriminating unfairly against
the tobacco growers in insisting that the proportion of
dark leaf be reduced, and warning growers that
prepared to buy only limited quantities of such dark leaf.
It should be stated quite plainly, however, that the lessening
demand for dark tobacco in Australia is only an echo of
what has already taken place in many other parts of the
world. During the past twenty years the tastes of smokers
of many nations, but particularly of English speaking coun-
tries, has changed from dark and medium smoking mixtures
to the light aromatic tobaccoes. This change in taste has
spelled ruin to those American districts where dark leaf is
grown.
That this tremendously decreased demand for dark tobacco
has taken place in Australia as in other parts of the wmrld
is showm quite clearly by a comparative study of our imports
of bright flue-cured and dark Virginia tobaccoes in recent
years. The following table shows the comparative amounts
of these tw r o types of tobacco exported from the United
States to Australia during the past seven years:—

grown dark Virginia tobacco has markedly decreased, so
that while in 1923 the dark Virginia leaf imported repre-
sented 27.4% by weight and 25.9% by value as compared
with the bright flue-cured imports, in 1929 these percentages
had dropped to 4.2% by weight and 2.9% by value. This
indicates quite plainly the change in smoking tastes of the
Australian public that has taken place in the last seven
years. , .
Tobacco Consumption and Tobacco Revenues under State
Monopolies as ' Compared with Free Commerce.
There appears to be 1 an opinion in some quarters that
tobacco is a commodity the manufacture and sale of which
might well be under 1 Government control. We occasionally
hear of the benefits of the French Regie, a Government
monopoly controlling' ail purchase, manufacture, and sale
of tobacco in theJßepublic of Prance. The actual revenues
derived from tobacco 'monopolies in those countries that
have adopted this method* 0f control, however, do not appear
to be as great as those derived from the tobacco industry
in nations with free commerce in tobacco. The following
table shows tobacco consumption and revenue in some of
the principal tobacco manufacturing nations, including two
monopoly countries and four nations with free commerce:

• The Australian figures were not in the original table copied here, but were
added for comparison.
From these data it would appear that for the most part
the revenues to the national treasury are greater in those
countries allowing free commerce in tobacco, and collecting
their tobacco revenues in the form of import and excise
duties.
The Effects of Varying Imposts and Methods of Control
on Production, Imports, and Prices Received ry
Growers.
By using figures collected from many sources it has been
possible to show, in tabular form, the conditions existing
in the tobacco industry in five selected nations. It should
be stated that the figures given are not in all cases strictly
comparable, as many of the nations end their fiscal years
on different dates, and their methods of computation and
expression of totals under the different headings vary widely.
Nevertheless, the data are roughly comparable. Since pipe
and cigarette tobaccos form the principal items of manu-
facture in the countries selected, import and excise duties on
these types only are shown. The table is showm below:—

There are many points of interest in this table. It may
be noted that Australia has a comparatively high import duty,
but still imports most of its raw leaf. The United States
of America has moderate import duties, a tremendous pro-
duction, export and manufacture, but still imports large quan-
tities of tobacco for use in manufacture. Its exports of to-
bacco in 1928 were valued at £37,000,000, and its imports
at over £21,000,000. Canada grows over half the tobacco leaf
used by its manufacturers, exports a fair quantity, but still

imports large quantities of raw leaf for blending and particu-
larly for cigarettes. France, which has had government
monopoly since 1674 (first set up by Colbert, Minister of
Finance in the reign of Louis XIV.) and which has had full
government control of the production, manufacture and sale
of tobacco operating under approximately the same laws since
1811, still finds it necessary to import from foreign countries
approximately half the raw leaf taken for manufacture. It
may be noted that under full government control in France
the average price per lb. for tobacco leaf received by the
grower is the lowest of any of the countries reported. It is
also of interest that the average price received by the Aus-
tralian tobacco-growers is from twice to four times the average
price received by tobacco-growers in other countries, and that
the present import duty on raw leaf tobacco entering Aus-
tralia is more than three times the average price received
by growers in the other countries listed in this table.
The Allocation of Expenditures of the Australian
Tobacco Investioation.
In discussing these expenditures it must be made plain that
the investigation has made no attempt to divide its attention
equally among the States. At the present time New South
Wales and Victoria are receiving the major share of our atten
tion, because the main commercial producing areas are located
in these States. We have felt, however, that as the present
commercial production supplied less than 10 per cent of the
leaf used for manufacture, extensive testing of new areas
was justified. The Australian Tobacco Investigation has
adopted a Commonwealth view of the problem, and in con-
junction with the State Departments of Agriculture has car-
ried out experimental work in all of the mainland States,
with a view to ascertaining the commercial possibilities of
tobacco production in these States. All of the efforts to date
may be classified under three main headings, as follows:
{1) Ascertaining the exact position as regards the tex-
ture, colour, and smoking qualities of leaf tobacco
produced in the present commercial districts.
(2) Improvement of leaf tobacco in the present growing
districts.
(3) Location and testing of new areas where mild aro-
matic tobacco may be grown.
Expenditures incident upon organization of the work have
been heavy. It has been difficult to estimate the expenditures
necessary', due to the fact that the work is just getting under
way. However, an approximate estimate of the probable ex-
penditures for the fiscal year 1929-30 was made well in
advance of the growing season.
It must also be stated that the accounts of the Tobacco
Investigation Trust Fund have been kept by the accounts de-
partment of the Development and Migration Commission.
To date, owing to our taking a Commonwealth view of the
problem no stipulations have been made as to how the various
expenditures should be grouped, but it is possible, however,
to make a rough approximation of expenditures by States, and
this is shown in the following table;—
Expenditures of the Australian Tobacco Investigation for
1927-28 and 1928-29, allocated as far as possible by States ,

Considering these expenditures it may be stated that the
work during 1927-28, and a considerable share of 1928-29, was
largely general organization. In 1928-29, the first extensive
field tests were started. Of the 1928-29 expenditures, the
amounts shown for the various States are fairly accurate.
As regards the estimates for 1929-30, it is probable that the
expenditures allocated to the various States will not be ex-
ceeded, but the amount of £3,300 estimated for general ex-
penses will be inadequate, due to an item of £1,500 for a
glasshouse at Canberra, which was not included in the esti-
mates, being paid out of tobacco investigation funds.
Request fob Bounty on Australian-grown Leaf.
With regard to “ the request of the growers submitted to
the Prime Minister at Canberra in May, 1928, for a bounty
on Australia-grown leaf,” it may be noted that this delegation
of tobacco-growers requested a bounty at the following rates
on all classes of flue-cured leaf grown in Australia: —
Lemon-coloured . . . . Is. per lb.
Bright Mahogany . . . . 9d. „ „
Mahogany and Dark . . 6d. „ „
An average yearly crop of tobacco from the present growing
districts, which are mainly in New South Wales and Victoria,
may be estimated at 2,000,000 lb. With regard to the four
classes of leaf above-mentioned, the proportions which have
been obtained in good growing seasons may be roughly esti-
mated at 5 per cent, lemon and bright, 15 per cent, bright
mahogany, 45 per cent, mahogany, and 35 per cent. dark. The
requested bonuses, if granted on this basis, would cost the
Commonwealth annually £50,000, as may be seen in the fol-
lowing table:—
2,000,000-lb. crop.
£
5 per cent. — 100,000 lb. at Is. = 5,000
15 per cent/ — 300,000 lb. at 9d. = 11,000
80 per cent.—l,6oo,ooo lb. at 6d. = 40,000
Total
56,000
Should the production increase, the total amount paid under
this plan would also increase. Machinery necessary for
properly administering this fund would add to the expense.
Government bonuses of this sort, although possibly justified
in certain cases when strictly limited as to duration, and
under skilled economic supervision, are nevertheless open to
criticism from many stand-points, and they often encourage
production where it is neither warranted nor desirable. They
disturb normal market values, inflate land prices, and gener-
ally disorganize industry. The point must also be emphasized
that the prices received for several years past by Australian
tobacco-growers have been at least 100 per cent, above world
market prices on a weight basis, and on a quality basis prob-
ably 200 to 300 per cent, above world prices. Something is
radically wrong if, under these prices, tobacco cannot be
grown profitably in Australia. The remedy lies, not in in-
creased payments to growers in the form of government
bonuses, but in experimentation and research to improve the
quality and to increase the yield of high-quality leaf. It
may also be pointed out that the largest purchaser of Aus-
tralian-grown leaf, the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,
has for several years paid voluntary bonuses on the better
grades of leaf, and that these bonuses have been recently
increased. At present a voluntary bonus of Is. per lb. is
paid by this company on all Lemon, Bright, and Bright Maho-
gany grades purchased.
Alternative Request for Increased Import Duty on
Foreign Leaf and Decreased Excise Duty on
AuSTRALI AN -GROWN LEAF.
Considering the alternative request of the growers for an
increase in tne duty on imported leaf, and a decrease in the
excise duty on locally grown leaf ”, it may be stated that,
from the growers’ stand-point, either of these methods would
accomplish the same result, namely, an increased tariff pro-
tection for tobacco. From the governmental
stand-point, however, any decrease in excise would entail
decreased revenues, whereas increased import duties would
increase revenues. A changed excise duty on part of the
leaf used by manufacturers would result in increased collec-
tion costs, and difficulties in application. In the meantime,
and since this request was made, the Government has in-
creased the import duty on foreign leaf from 2s. to 3s. per
lb., thereby affording the growers Is. per lb. additional pro-
tection. The present protection of 3s. per lb. appears to be
adequate, since it represents more than three times the average
prices received by growers of flue-cured tobacco in America
for the past five years.
Present Investigation in Best Interests of Growers.
The question is asked “ whether the arrangement entered
into between the Commonwealth Government, certain States,
and the British-Australasian Tobacco Company, to carry out
experiments in the growing of tobacco leaf in Australia is in
the best interests of the growers.” It may perhaps be pointed
out that the _ growing of tobacco leaf” does not comprise
all the activities of the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
The aim of this organization is the improvement of the
tobacco industry, and the interests of producers, manufac-
turers and consumers must all be taken into consideration.
While manufactui e and consumption are in a fairly satis-
factory condition, the same cannot be said of production
and the present efforts of the investigation, therefore, are
mainly centred on this phase of the industry. In addition to
extensive efforts to improve the methods of culture and in-
crease the quality of tobacco grown in the established com-
mercial districts, the investigation is testing out soils in
new districts where _ conditions appear favorable, in order
to ascertain their suitability for tobacco, the smoking quali-
ties of the cured leaf produced, and its qualities in blends


with other Australian and imported leaf. Thus the whole of
the present activity of the Australian Tobacco Investigation
may be said to be in tiie interests of the growers.
Should Federal Direction of Tobacco Experimental Work
be made Permanent
The question “ as to whether, in the best interests of the
growers, the arrangement should be so altered as to ensure
that the federal direction of experimental work should be
made a permanent phase of the tobacco-groAving industry in
Australia ”, is of great importance to the investigation as
Aveli as to the growers. It should be emphaisized that tobacco
experimental work usually requires many years of effort before
results of practical value can be obtained. In company with
other agricultural research, tobacco experimentation requires
continuity to be effective, and by making it a permanent
federal activity, this continuity may be secured. The first
three-year period of the present agreement is nearing an end,
and the various parties to the agreement must shortly decide
whether the investigation should be continued under federal
auspices. It is understood that the present Executive Com-
mittee controlling the investigation has recommended that
the parties to the present agreement continnue their financial
support, but that the executive control of the investigations be
transferred to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Re-
search. Such change in executive control would, of course,
require to be approved by the Federal Gov’ernment, by the
Governments of the mainland States, and by the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company, all of whom are partners
to the present agreement under which the Australian Tobacco
Investigation is being carried on.
In the best interests of the tobacco industry, the work
should be continued as a permanent phase of federal activity.
From the stand-point of the tobacco industry, it is not so im-
portant to what federal department it, is attached, but it is
of paramount importance that the investigation be held
together as a unit, and should be under the guidance of an
experienced leader in tobacco research.
Tobacco is a highly specialized crop. In addition to this,
it may be pointed out that the Federal Government derives
between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 annually in revenue from
the tobacco industry.
These are strong arguments in favour of maintaining a
district federal organization which, in addition to conducting
research in tobacco plant problems, including soils, chemistry,
nutrition and diseases, might be equipped to carry out
research into the economics of tobacco production, manufac-
ture, and distribution. This organization might act also as a
medium for the collection and exchange of tobacco informa-
tion throughout the CommomAealth, and establish and main-
tain contact with similar overseas organizations.
Methods of Packing and Handling Home-Grown Tobacco
Employed by Australian Manufactures.
The director of investigations was requested by the Execu-
tive Committee at its meeting on 19th November last, to
furnish a report on the methods of packing and handling
locally grown leaf employed by Australian tobacco manufac-
turers. While the methods in use were fairly well known to
the director, as a result of personal interviews with the
various manufacturers, it was felt that the importance of the
subject warranted the securing, in definite written form from
each manufacturer, of rather complete information as to the
methods employed. The desired information was requested
from the manufacturers in the form of a questionnaire to which
they were asked to reply. This questionnaire was as follows:
1. What is the form, container, and usual weight of
package in which the raw leaf reaches your factory?
2. What general methods of grading, handling, and
packing are in use by growers from whom you buy?
Have you any sugestions as to possible improvement in
this direction ?
3. Are there any variations in methods of grading
handling and packing or in form, container, and weight
of package in the various districts from which you obtain
leaf? Have you any sugestions as to changes or uniform
practices in this regard?
4. What is the usual percentage of moisture in the raw
leaf tobacco as it reaches your factory from the growers?
5. Do you do any further grading of the tobacco leaf
after purchase from the growers?
6. If further grading is done, what general plan of
grading is followed with flue-cured tobacco?
7. Do you re-dry or re-order your Australian leaf pur-
chases ? If so, approximately what temperatures and
moistures are used?
8. What methods and what containers do you use in
packing your Australian leaf purchases for storage and
ageing ?
9. What the shortest, the average, and the longest
period of ageing and storage of Australian leaf purchases
before taking for manufacture?
10. Do you encounter any difficulties with mould,
sweating or fermentation, black rot, must, or other
storage troubles?
11. Do you handle any air cured Australian leaf ?
If so, what different methods of grading, handling, and
packing for this sort of tobacco do you employ?
To this questionnaire the following replies have been
received:—
I. — From Michelides Limited, 88 Roe-street, Perth,
Western Australia.
1. In the great majority of cases Australian leaf bought
by us 'is in bales of about 200 lb. weight each. We consider
this packing and Aveight quite satisfactory for this class of
tobacco.
2. The grading is Aery deficient and certainly requires
improvement.
3. Some tobacco received from this State is in smaller
containers, but the average 200-lb. standard is more convenient
to us.
4. Leaf received from Victoria and New South Wales
contains an average of 16 to 18 per cent, moisture. But
this year’s crop from this State contained more than 22 per
cent. By the time we received this into the factory it was
quite hot and AA’ent mouldy in no time. Our efforts to save
part of same were unsuccessful.
5. We further grade the leaf to suit our requirements,
but unfortunately Ave have not space enough to do this
efficiently.
6. We separate bright from dark, long from short, sound
from broken leaf and take regard to the thickness of
same.
7. We do not re-dry our Australian leaf. We have no
means or space to do this.
8. We put the leaf up in heaps, other we p*ack in casks
formerly containing American leaf.
9. We use a year old leaf and longer when possible.
10. Outside of Western Australian leaf we are not being
troubled from mould or other inconvenience.
11. We handle air-cured leaf mostly from Queensland,
We leave this in the original bales. The grading of this
is better and the percentage of moisture regular, therefore,
we found it unnecessary to disturb the original packing.
11. From G. G. Goode Limited, Collingwood, Victoria.
This company did not answer the questionnaire, informing
us that they did not use locally grown leaf. Their letter of
explanation follows:
have to acknowledge receipt of your favour of the
27th ult. and would inform you that up to the present
we have not been handling any Australian leaf for cigarette
making purposes.
Lnder these circumstances we cannot answer your inquiries,
but the impression we have gained from the samples which
we have seen is that the locally grown tobacco is not well
graded and that a further re-grading would be necessary.
I urthermore we consider that before the growers Avail make
much definite progress, some re-drying process will have
to be installed in a suitable district.
One reason which makes us hesitant about using local
leaf is the fact that as we have not got the necessarv
facilities for re-drying and storing, we are afraid that the
leaf would become damaged in storage.
The i ecent alterations in duty makes Australian leaf much
more attractive than in th e past, and immediately upon
the writer’s return from abroad. It is his intention to go
very fully into this matter during the coming year. ”
111. T rom the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Limited,
Melbourne, Victoria, and Sydney, New South Wales.
1. Rectangular bales covered with hessian and containing
about 200 lb. of leaf. h
2. The glowers usually class their leaf in lemon, bright
mahogany, mahogany and dark grades, each being baled
separately. In our opinion the grading by growers on the
farm is deficient. It is essential that the growers should
improve their methods, and we think that this could be
brought about by tuition by experts on the farm.
3. There are no variations from this method, although
the various growers differ in their ability to grade accu-
rately, and in the care and neatness of pack. There is also
room for improvement in the handling and packiim par-
ticularly as regards the size of the hands. This could also
be improved by tuition by experts on the farm.
4. leaf as it reaches our factories contains from
12 to 25 per cent, moisture, with the average below 20
per cent. The moisture content varies considerably the
variation being caused by the nature of the season prevailing
when the leaf is being handled by the growers. For
bome of the leaf from the northern districts in New South
Wales (Tamworth and Manilla) has at times, in a dry
season, been too dry to redry, and rehandle. On the other
hand leaf from the Southern districts of New South Wales
(iumut) has at times contained an excess of moisture.
The percentages of moisture given are only approximate.


5. Yes.
0. The regrading done is mostly grading by hands, although
some leaf grading may be done in the lemon and bright
classes. The growers’ crops are eventually regraded in our
warehouse into about fifteen grades, each of which is packed
separately. The grades made include lemon, bright, bright
No. 2, long bright mahogany, short bright mahogany,
mahogany, short mahogany, dark wrapper, long dark, short
dark, long dark No. 2, and short dark No. 2. Mouldy
leaves and green leaves are discarded and sold with other
shorts and refuse for insecticide manufacture. Loose leaves
detached in process of handling from mahogany and dark
grades are packed separately.
7. In Melbourne all our Australian-grown leaf is redried
after grading at a temperature of 130° to 140° F. In
Sydney it is not possible to redry all the New South Wales
and Queensland leaf owing to its conditions, but redrying
is done wherever practicable. In both States we have in
use the standard type of redrying machines as used in
America and elsewhere for redrying. Moisture tests are
not made on each lot as it leaves the redrier, but the moisture
content at this stage is probably about 15 per cent.
8. In these matters we adopt identically the same methods
as are used in America, Australian leaf after leaving the
redrier being packed and pressed in oblong pine cases (from
which American imported leaf has been emptied) and then
placed in storage. The leaf is then stored for ageing purposes,
about 400 lb. being packed in each case.
9. As regards the bright leaf of which there has been
a shortage of supply, we have been commencing to use it
after it has had a summer sweat, which is about twelve
months after harvesting. The dark and No. 2 leaf has an
ageing period ranging from four to six years: the average
ageing period of all grades is at the present time four
years.
10. Some mould loss is suffered before redrying.
11. No air cured leaf is handled and packed in our Mel-
bourne factory. At our Sydney factory small quantities of
air-cured leaf are obtained from Texas, and provided this
leaf is in a suitable condition for rehandling, it receives the
same treatment as flue-cured leaf.
IV. From Dudgeon and Arnell Proprietary Limited, 524 534

1. In bales of approximately 200 lb. weight.
2. This is a difficult question to answer. There is apparently
no set idea as to grading. “A ” will class his leaf as best
bright and “ B ” will name the same grade bright mahogany.
“ A ” grading as mahogany would be classed by “ B ” as No.
1 dark and so on.
3. The handling, packing, container and w 7 eight of packages
are generally the same but in the grading closer attention
to detail is necessary to obtain some uniformity.
4. The average percentage of moisture in light tobacco is
from 18-20 per cent, and in dark 20-25 per cent.
5. Yes.
6. Where practicable the grading is done while bulking,
otherwise light and dark are separated w 7 hen the leaf is
being stripped.
7. Yes, by air drying. The approximate moisture content
is 10 per cent.
8. The leaf is buked in stacks of approximately 2,000 lb.
9. Six months, twelve months and two years.
10. Yes, occasionally, most of the difficulty is overcome
by turning the leaf which requires constant attention.
11. Yes, generally the same methods apply as in the treat-
ment of flue-cured tobacco.
Discussion.
It may be noted that the cured tobacco reaches the
buyer in rectangular hessian covered bales containing ap-
proximately 200 lb. of leaf. Each bale is supposed to contain
one grade of leaf. The growers usually class their leaf in
lemon, bright mahogany, mahogany and dark grades. There
appears to be a unanimity of opinion among the firms at
present purchasing leaf from the growers that the grading
is deficient, and requires improvement. The largest buyers
suggest more attention to detail to secure uniformity in
the pack, and suggest improvement of methods of grading
and packing tobacco through tuition by experts on the
farm.
All Australian leaf purchased undergoes regrading by the
purchaser before packing. The regrading done is most ex-
tensive in the rehandling and packing plants of the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company. They state that leaf grading
is carried out in the lemon and bright classes, but that
generally hand grading is practised, the growers’ crops even-
tually being regraded into about fifteen grades, each of
w’hich is packed separately.
Of the three firms using Australian-grown leaf, one does
no redrying of the leaf after it reaches his factory, one
air dries to “10 per cent, moisture content”, and the third
firm redries all its Victorian grown leaf and most of its
New 7 South Wales leaf at a temperature of 130° to 140° F.,
using for this purpose the standard type (Proctor) of
reordering machine as used in America and elsewhere. The
moisture content of the leaf as it leaves the redrier, they
state, is about 15 per cent. This is about the same as
is adopted with American and Canadian leaf packed for
domestic use. The maximum temperatures used are some-
what lower than applied to American leaf. This may be due
to the coarse texture of much of the leaf handled.
One manufacturer reports that he packs and ages all his
domestic leaf in bulks of approximately 2000 lb. weight.
Another uses this same method generally, but puts some
(presumably the better grades) in casks from which he
has emptied American leaf. The third and largest purchaser
packs and ages all his Australian leaf after grading and
redrying in pine boxes from which the American imported
leaf has been removed. About 400 lb. are packed in each
box, and this manufacturer states that his firm adopts identi-
cally the same methods as are used in America.
As regards the period of ageing given Australian leaf
before taking for manufacture, one firm reported using leaf
after six months ageing, with the average age of leaf used
about twelve months, and the maximum period of ageing
two years. Another firm reports that it only uses leaf a year
old and older if possible. The third and largest manufac-
turers state that their Australian leaf stocks at present
receive an average ageing of four years. They state, however,
that they begin to use the lemon and bright grades, of
which there is a shortage, at the end of twelve months.
All firms report some loss by mould due to excessive
moisture in some lots of leaf as received from the grower.
The losses from this cause do not appear to be large,
however.
Very little air cured leaf is now handled by any of the
firms reporting, but where such leaf is handled it appears
to receive the same treatment as flue-cured tobacco.
In addition to replying to the eleven separate questions,
each manufacturer was requested to give his opinion as
to the relative value of the various processes used by his
firm, and as to the possibility of improving the quality of
Australian grown tobacco through variation or alteration of
these methods. Only one firm, the British-Australasian To-
bacco Company, replied to this paragraph, and their reply
is quoted below:
With regard to the last paragraph in your letters,
we apply to Australian leaf the most modern methods,
and it receives the same treatment as our American
leaf. There is nothing further that we know of that
could be done by the manufacturers that would make
any improvement in the characteristics of Australian
leaf.
With regard to ageing we do think, for two reasons,
that it would be an advantage to have two years stocks
of the bright leaf. In the first place it would help to
ensure the continuity of supply of the required type,
which is essential, and secondly it would help to tone
dowm the harshness in the leaf.
At the same time w r e would like to make it quite clear
that while the ageing will mellow 7 the leaf, it will not
alter or improve the character of the burning aroma.
From the information above discussed as derived from the
answers to our questionnaire, it is apparent that there are
some differences in methods of handling, packing, and ageing
Australian growm leaf tobacco as practised by the three
manufacturers reporting. It may be pointed out, however,
that the largest manufacturers, who purchase and pack by
far the largest part of our annual raw leaf production, use
modern methods of handling, packing and ageing of their
Australian leaf purchases. The use of these methods doubtless
ensures more uniformity in the pack, and the more elaborate
regrading should also ensure greater uniformity in the manu-
factured tobaccoes. At the same time we have no data at
present on which to base an assumption that the aroma
of flue-cured tobacco packed in bulk without machine re-
ordering would be inferior to that of machine re-ordered
leaf. Such tests as have been made indicate little or no
difference in aroma of samples packed in these two ways.
5556. By Air. Jones. —How is the French Parity
Commission constituted ?—lt is composed of representa-
tives of the growers’ organizations and representatives
of the Government. If they cannot agree as to the
price to be paid for tobacco, it is fixed by an arbitrator.
5557. By the Chairman. —You say—
It should be recognized, how 7 ever, that the change of the
taste of the consuming public in favour of Australian-grown
tobacco must be a gradual process. In this matter, the Aus-
tralian Tobacco Investigation and the States must work in
close association with the manufacturer.
Why should the Investigation work in association with
the manufacturers? Are their interests identical? —If
we get hold of something that is good, we must en-
deavour to convince the manufacturers that they
should use it.


5558. The manufacturers will only buy the Aus-
tralian leaf if they want it. Do you mean that your
object should be to bring to their notice any improve-
ments in local leaf and ask them if it is not worth a
better price ? —I am not thinking of the price, but rather
of the use of more Australian leaf if we produce some-
thing that we can recommend to them. Manufacturers
have established brands. My experience in Canada and
the United Kingdom has convinced me that it is abso-
lutely necessary to keep in close touch with the manu-
facturers at all times. They are interested in the work
we are doing, and if we are able to produce something
which is desirable, they will always be ready to give
as much assistance as is possible, consistent with and
considering the requirements of their clientele. There-
fore, the building up of a demand by the consumers for
something new must be a gradual process. I found that
so in Canada in connexion with the introduction of
locally-grown leaf in competition with imported leaf.
5559. You further said, “ attempts to dictate to the
consuming public are likely to result in failure, and
may unduly prejudice consumers against the local pro-
duct.” What do you mean by dictation ?—Shutting out
the imported leaf in order to force the manufacturers
to use only the local article.
5560. Are we not doing that to some extent now
through the tariff?—To a small extent; I am thinking
of a prohibitive duty or embargo.
5561. You do not assume that the public will be com-
pelled to buy a tobacco they do not want by depriving
them of good tobacco and substituting an inferior
article. Would not that cause a decrease in consump-
tion? —Probably. What I have in mind is that in the
best interests of all concerned, any change in public
taste should be brought about gradually and by a pro-
cess of education, ratber than compulsion.
5562. By Mr. Morgan. —In other words, you are
opposed to the proposal of Mr. Jennings, who said
at Texas that Australians should be forced to smoke
local tobacco by a complete prohibition of the imported
leaf?— That would be an entirely selfish policy, and
would disregard the wants of the public.
5563. That would be the maximum of compulsion
that could be applied against the consumers ?—lt would
be an injustice to both the consumer and the manu-
facturer.
5564. By the Chairman. —If many brands of Aus-
tralian tobacco w T ere put on the market and sold at
lower prices than imported brands, would you call that
dictation? —Ho. Australian tobaccoes are sold at lower
prices at the present time. The public would still have
the right to choose between the cheaper local article
and the higher priced imported tobacco.
5565. If the prices of imported tobacco were made
very high and the prices of Australian tobacco lower
than to-day, that would be a form of indirect dicta-
tion?— The present import duties on tobacco are ade-
quate to protect the grower; and further increase should
be considered from the stand-point of revenue rather
than extra protection to the local industry.
5566. By Mr. Morgan. —Should not the consumer be
considered. He should not be asked to bear an addi-
tional impost in order to adjust a position that is
definitely due to the fact that the class of tobacco re-
quired by the public is not produced locally?— The
matter should be regarded from the stand-point of both
the consumer and the producer; all interests should be
taken into consideration.
5567. Is not the consumer already paying a suffi-
ciently high price for his tobacco ?—I think he is.
5568. By the Chairman. —You are not blaming the
tariff policy entirely for that?— Ho.
5569. You realize that the manufacturers are making
a big profit out of the industry ?—They must be making
profits or they would not continue in the business.
5570. By the Chairman. —On page 2 of the statement
which you submitted this morning you state, “We may
reasonably hope with improvement in quality, to supply
at least 60 per cent, of our domestic requirements. It
is difficult to say how long a time would he required to
reach this position. Ten years would be a short period.”
Do I understand you to mean that we cannot possibly
achieve that 60 per cent, within ten years?—lt would
be impossible to say when that could be achieved, but
we hope that if our work is successful to reach that 60
per cent, within a reasonable period. That is a rough
estimate, and is approximately what Canada has been
able to do.
5571. Have they a Federal Control Board in
Canada? —They have a tobacco division of the
Dominion Department of Agriculture.
5572. Is it purely a federal concern?— Yes.
5573. Is there any form of provincial control? —The
States are practically doing no work in this connexion;
it is all done by the Federal Department. In the United
States, however, there is a Federal Department of Agri-
culture in conjunction with which the States are per-
forming certain work,
5574. What are the functions of the Federal Depart-
ment in the United States of America?— The tobacco
work in the United States of America Department of
Agriculture, is carried out mainly by the Tobacco In-
vestigation Branch.
5575. What is the extent of these departments both
in Canada and in the United States of America?—ln
Canada the tobacco division has its headquarters, office,
laboratory and greenhouses at Ottawa.
5576. Is there a Federal Director?— They have a
chief of the Tobacco Division.
5577. What are his duties?— Generally to supervise
the tobacco work of the Department of Agriculture for
the Dominion.
5578. Has he control of all experimental work?—
Yes, in connexion with tobacco.
5579. Including field and scientific work?— Yes.
There are pathologists and chemists attached to the
division as well as several practical men. The total
technical staff during the past ten years has consisted
roughly of about half a dozen officers. In addition
there are field superintendents and field workers as well
as a secretary to the division and the necessary clerical
staff.
5580. What does the department consist of in the
United States of America?— There is a senior physiolo-
gist in charge of the tobacco investigation, and under
him there are three or four assistant physiologists as
well as two or three pathologists and assistant patholo-
gists and others, whom they term field technologists,
and a number of technical assistants.
5581. What would be the total number of staff?—l
have not the register with me, but I should say that the
total staff, including the clerical branch of the tobacco
investigation, would probably be twenty.
5582. What are the functions of the director?— The
physiologist in charge controls all the tobacco work
carried out under the auspices of the Federal Depart-
ment of Agriculture. In addition he consults with the
States officers who may be undertaking tobacco in-
vestigation work in the various States. In the tobacco
States a good deal of the field experimental work and
some of the laboratory experimental work is carried
out in co-operation with the federal office. For
instance, at the laboratory at which I commenced
ray tobacco work there was co-operation between the
office of the Federal Tobacco Investigations and the
College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin.
That university furnished the laboratory facilities,
office staff and casual labour, such as that required for
work in the glass or green houses and in the fields, and
the Federal Department of Agriculture placed the
technical men of their staff in that laboratory.


5583. How long has the federal department been
established in the United States of America?— The
office of the Tobacco Investigation as such has been
established for approximately 25 years, and before that
the work was attached to the bureau of soils and was
carried out under its auspices for probably fifteen or
twenty years.
5584. What is the position in Canada ?—The present
tobacco division dates back to 1905.
5585. On page 3 of your statement you say that
some witnesses have found no faults in Australian-
grown leaf, and others have condemned it as almost
useless. I suppose you are aware that all of those wit-
nesses who had condemned it as useless, and those who
have found no fault with it, have been subjected to
cross-examination. Have you read all the evidence
given before the committee ?—I have perused most of it.
5586. Are you aware that these witnesses, under
cross-examination, modified their statements consider-
ably?— Yes.
5587. You further state that the truth is to be found
somewhere between these extreme views. If these views
are not extreme, as proved by the cross-examination, do
you wish to modify your statement in any way?—l
gather from the evidence that some of the witnesses
considered that Australian tobacco is quite usable in
the form in which it is now prepared, and does not
require any improvement, and that others hold the
opinion that it is extremely difficult for it to be used in
its present state for manufacture. My opinion is that
the leaf should not be regarded as entirely unusable,
neither can we say that it is not without fault. It
is apparent that there are many qualities of leaf capable
of improvement.
5588. On pages 3 and 4 of your statement you
refer to the sample sent to England in 1928 by the
Australian Tobacco Investigation. Who was the pri-
vate grower to whom you referred?— The sample was
sent from Pomonal and I would prefer to take the
matter up with the grower before disclosing his name;
that is, of course, if the committee has no objection to
my adopting that course.
5589. To whom was the sample sent?—To the Im-
perial Institute, which forwarded me a report, which
I sent on to the grower. The Tobacco Investigation
had nothing whatever to do with the dispatching of
that sample. The Imperial Institute sent a report back
through the regular channel and it came through my
office. I have already written to the man in question.
5590. Have you read the evidence given by Mr.
Tregenna with reference to the sample sent to England
in 1928?—N0.
5591. He said that the samples of the leaf that pro-
duced the best price in their grades were picked out
and that the reports from England were based on those
samples.
5592. Are you not aware that samples of the most
inferior tobacco produced in the Tamworth district
were amongst those which were sent?— No.
5593. Good samples of bright leaf from that district
were not sent, and inferior samples from other districts
were forwarded. Is that method of selection fair to
the industry, or to the districts concerned?—To the
best of my recollection the best samples of leaf
despatched came from New South Wales.
5594. Ho you think the method of selection fair?
—I would not have adopted that system.
5595. Ho you think that the system of sending
samples to England is in the interests of the industry?
—I doubt if it has any great value. Personally, I
am quite familiar with the English market, and I know
what buyers there will take and what they will not.
I know what prices obtain on the English market; but
you will realize that the executive committee probably
did not have that information at its disposal, and
wished to know what ordinary grades of Australian
tobacco would bring on the English market, and what
the attitude of manufacturers in Great Britain would
be towards such leaf.
5596. By Mr. Martens. —If you were selecting a
sample of tobacco to send to some recognized authority
for an opinion would you select what could not be
regarded as a fair sample?— No. The people who
judged the tobacco in England knew nothing of the
origin of the samples.
5597. What do you consider the right procedure to
adopt in sending samples from any district? —I should
select at least fifteen grades from the same district
in order to obtain a good idea of all the grades of
tobacco produced in that district.
5598. By the Chairman. —You also refer in your
statement to the protection given to the Australian
tobacco industry, and indicate that you consider a duty
of 3s. per lb. and an excise impost of 2s. 4d. per lb.,
making ss. 4d., quite sufficient. That is not the actual
amount of duty, because the Australian leaf has to pay
the same excise. Would you consider ss. 4d. per lb. too
much protection to give the Australian manufacturers?
—I should consider it more than necessary.
5599. Ho you not consider it a big inducement for
the manufacturers to buy Australian leaf? —It might
be an inducement.
5600. Would it be an inducement if they could save
ss. 4d. per lb?—I would suggest rather an increase of
the import duty to ss. 4d. per lb., and leave the excise
duty as it is, and then you would not be interfering
with the revenue. I doubt if you would find manu-
facturers paying ss. 4d, per lb. even if the import duty
were raised to ss. 4d.
5601. If the import duty was ss. 4d. and there was
no excise on Australian leaf, every pound would repre-
sent a saving of ss. 4d. to the manufacturer? —Yes.
That would be an inducement, but at present Austra-
lian manufacturers have a strong inducement to pur-
chase Australian leaf. I am looking at this from the
standpoint of the industry, and, while I feel that it
is amply protected, nevertheless, I should be in favour
if any changes were to be made, of increasing the import
duty and allowing the excise to remain as it is. We
could abolish the excise duty entirely as is the case
in the United Kingdom.
5602. We would then be protecting the industry
to the extent of ss. 4d. per lb. Ho you think that
too much? —It is a rather high protection and more
than that afforded in other countries. Great Britain
has a high import duty, but no excise; no tobacco is
grown in that country.
5603. What is the import duty in Great Britain?—
approximately Bs. lOd. per lb.
5604. With an import duty in Australia of ss. 4d.
per lb. we would be considerably below Great Britain?
—Yes ;if the excise were abolished.
5605. What is the import duty in the United States
of America ?—Boughly, Is. s|d. per lb.
5606. And the excise duty?—lOd. per lb. on pipe
tobacco and 4s. per lb. on cigarettes, which is not as
heavy as the excise in Australia on cigarettes, which
is 7s. per lb.
5607. What is the import duty in Canada?—On pipe
tobacco it is Is. Bd. per lb., and the excise lOd. per
lb. On cigarettes it is Bs. per lb.
5608. You believe in keeping a fixed revenue, whereas
on the basis of import duties it would be likely to
fluctuate?— Yes. An increase in the import duty would
increase the revenue to the Government, but a decrease
in the excise would decrease the revenue and would be
introducing a disturbing factor in two directions.
5609. If we have an excise duty of 2s. 4d. per lb.
on manufactured leaf we know what revenue is to be
produced; but if we abolish the excise and increase


the import duty, we would not be receiving any revenue
from the manufacturers of leaf, and the import duty
might result in fluctuating figures?— Yes.
5610. Your argument is that under your suggestion
the revenue would be protected?— Yes. At present the
tobacco-growers are amply protected at 3s. per lb. and
any change either in the import or excise duties should
be regarded from the stand-point of governmental
revenue.
5611. By Mr. Morgan. —And also from the stand-
point of the consumer? —The consumer has also to be
considered.
5612. By the Chairman. —If there were a big saving
to the consumer in the price of Australian leaf as
against imported tobacco, the position would have to
be altered before he could be induced to purchase
imported tobacco?—Tobaccoes manufactured of locally-
grown leaf are already on the market at prices which
represent substantial savings to the consumer. It
should be practicable to increase consumption of our
tobaccoes provided we can obtain a mild and palatable
leaf. It may be possible for the Australian consumers
to gradually become accustomed to it.
5613. In regard to the experiments carried out in the
different States, can you say on what grounds you
decided upon Mareeba as the principal centre for your
experimental work?—l should not regard it as the
principal centre; it may be as far as North Queensland
is concerned.
5614. Do you not refer to it as the principal centre
in Australia ?—No. We have expended proportionately
more money at Mareeba than elsewhere, but the reason
is that we had no cleared land or buildings available.
In New South Wales and in Victoria we have been able
to make use of land, buildings and equipment already
available. At Mareeba, we were forced to clear land
and put up buildings and get together equipment in
order to produce tobacco, thus making the original
expenses somewhat heavy. You will recollect that in
1927-28 we had a series of experimental test plots
scattered from Bowen in the south to Mareeba in the
north. The plots on which the tobacco was grown
varied in altitude above the sea level from a few
hundred to three thousand feet, and the soil used was
for the most part a sandy loam. We found that pro-
vided the soil was at all comparable there was little
difference in the smoking qualities of the cured leaf, and
that was our justification for concentrating at Mareeba.
We inspected the district and decided that the facilities
at Mareeba vrere as good as in any other place we would
be likely to find in that locality. At Mareeba there is
a large expanse of Crown lands available for the
asking and a large expanse also of this typical sandy
soil which we wished to try and which is representative
of the soil over a large area in northern Queensland.
5615. When you arrived Mareeba had been decided
upon by the experimental committee?— No. I decided
upon that site.
5616. It was brought under your notice by Mr.
Tregenna and Dr. Darnell-Smith. Is it a fact that they
recommended you to go to Mareeba ?—That is not so.
5617. What are the facts?—l took Dr. Darnell-
Smith with me.
5618. Did they not know the place and take you
there?— No. It was the first time Dr. Darnell-Smith
had been there.
5619. The object was to obtain your opinion con-
cerning it ?—Doubtless.
5620. When you saw it you decided to go on with
it?— Yes. I take full responsibility for the concen-
tration of our activities at Mareeba. I felt that these
widely scattered plots had served their purpose in the
first year. We w r ere producing in an experimental way
fairly good tobacco and it would be difficult to determine
the difference between the lots. I felt that instead
of operating over a large area it would be wise to con-
centrate in the one centre.
5621. Was anything ever said to you in the early
stages of these negotiations concerning the idea of Mr.
Tregenna, Dr. Darnell-Smith and others forming a
company to operate alongside the Mareeba area? —Ho.
5622. Did they advise you at any stage that they
intended doing so ?—As far as I am aware Dr. Darnell-
Smith has no connexion with any tobacco-growing
enterprise. With regard to the company operating
at Mareeba, I think it was about six or eight months
ago when I first heard of the project, and when it
was mentioned in conversation by Mr. Tregenna. He
asked my opinion and I told him that at present we
were not in a position to make any recommendations
at all from the stand-point of commercial culture of
tobacco in North Queensland, and also from the stand-
point of syndicated culture of tobacco. I advised him
to look into the position carefully before committing
himself to anything. My experience of syndicated
culture of tobacco in the United States of America and
Canada led me to believe that it would be successful
only under certain conditions, and that if these con-
ditions were not applied there was every possibility of
failure.
5623. How was your advice received? —Very favour-
ably I trust. But in spite of my warning they decided
to go on with it,
5624. By Mr. Martens. —l understand that you are
operating on approximately ten acres at Mareeba?—We
have about 10 acres cleared and approximately seven
acres under crop.
5625. Have you had more than that at any time? —I
think that is the maximum figure. While we have
cleared about 12 acres, there are only 10 acres actually
ploughed because we had to clear away from the edge
in order to erect the necessary fencing.
2626. What is the size of the plot at Hervey’s
Bange ?—I think they cleared about eight acres the first
year, planted four acres and harvested a portion of the
crop from two acres.
5627. Is that under your supervision?—No, I have
not had much to do with it. The Townsville Chamber
of Commerce, which is interested, came to me after the
project w r as under way seeking advice and assistance.
5628. You know about it?—l have advised them, I
have inspected the tobacco and instructed them how to
cure it. We have tried to do all w T e can to help them.
5629. How many plots have you directly under your
supervision?—ln addition to the work in North
Queensland, we have a series of test plots in the
Bockhampton district which were started this year.
5630. Have you one at Bowen?—No.
5631. Only at Mareeba?—Yes, for North Queens-
land.
5632. The experimental w r ork is concentrated at
Mareeba?—Yes, for North Queensland. In all this
tobacco work we are acting in co-operation with the
Queensland Department of Agriculture.
5633. What plots are you actively connected with?—
The experimental holding at Mareeba, a few outside
plots at Mareeba, Ghillagoe, and Atherton in North
Queensland; and the Central Queensland exploratory
test plots which extend from Mackay to Bundaberg.
5634. There is no other area in the Herbert elec-
torate from Bowen to Mareeba with which you have
any direct connexion ?—Except in an advisory capacity.
5635. In connexion with which plots are you acting
in an advisory capacity ?—Certain plots under the con-
trol of the Townsville and Charters Towers Chambers
of Commerce, which are acting on behalf of people who
have put money into the venture. We have done all
we can to help them by sending a man to show them
how to cure the leaf. When I was in Queensland I


visited the plots and gave them such advice as I could.
In addition Mr. Pollock had arranged, for some men to
grow Burley tobacco which I said we would test.
5636- On page 23 of your statement you refer to the
expenditure of the Australian tobacco investigation for
1927-28 and 1928-29, allocated as far as possible by the
States with estimate for 1929-30. According to figures
previously submitted, £3,000 had been spent in Queens-
land, practically all at Mareeba. Have you incurred
expense anywhere else?— Yes. During the first year
the expenditure was distributed, and during the present
year we have included the Pockhampton series, which
will cost us probably £2OO.
5637. On the previous figures and on which you were
cross-questioned, it showed that much more money was
spent in Queensland than in any other part of the
Commonwealth, or, in fact, nearly as much as the whole
expenditure for the Commonwealth?-—I regret that the
figures to which you refer were brought under the
notice of the committee because they were entirely mis-
leading. I objected to them at the time and I fail to
understand how the accounts section could possibly have
produced them.
5638. The statement you have now submitted shows
the expenditure in Yew South Wales for 1927-28 as
£1149 and for 1928-29, £1,400 and the estimate for this
year at £2,000, making a total of, roughly, £4,500. The
figures for Victoria are £948, £1,596 and £2,000 re-
spectively, whilst those for Queensland for the same
period are £646, £2,078 and £1,500. These figures for
Queensland are much below those of Yew South Wales
and Victoria, and, apparently, while a certain amount
was spent at Mareeba for experimental purposes and
in order to determine whether money could be profitably
invested, other States have at times received much more
than Queensland. The figures previously quoted were
given a good deal of publicity and created the impres-
sion that Queensland was receiving more than any of
the other States. They were entirely misleading, and it
would be interesting to know on what they were based?
—I regret exceedingly that they were ever submitted to
the committee, and I cannot understand on what basis
of calculation they were compiled.
5639. They showed that £3,000 had been spent in one
centre, and that Mr. Tregenna and Dr. Darnell-Smith
had commenced the cultivation of tobacco on land ad-
joining in order to benefit by the expenditure of govern-
ment money?—l had nothing to do with the prepara-
tion of those figures; they were prepared by the
accounts branch.
5640. A close examination was conducted, and it now
appears that the figures are totally inaccurate. It sug-
gests that public money was spent so that certain in-
dividuals could obtain advantage?— The table appear-
ing on page 23 of my statement sets out the position
as it exists to-day.
5641. By Mr. Tully. —Under whose control was the
officer who produced the figures?—l think he was a
member of the accounts department of th ■ Development
and Migration Commission.
5642. Was his name Fowler?— Mr. Fowler was
instructed to obtain the figures relating to expenditure.
Your chairman asked me to arrange for Mr. Fowler to
submit them, bur they were prepared in the account’s
department.
5643. —8y Mr. Martens. —ls he an officer of your de-
partment?—He is the secretary of the executive com-
mittee of the Australian Tobacco Investigation.
5644. As secretary of the executive committee he
should know wdiat is being done?— Yes,
5645. Yo doubt there has been hostility in Victoria
because of the small sum of money which was expended
for experimental purposes in that State compared with
that which is said to be spent in Queensland in one
particular centre. I understand the distance from
Bowen to Mareeba is about 160 miles? —Yes. The
Mareeba covers a large area.
5646. By Mr. Jones. —Did I understand you tosstya t y
on a previous occasion that the tobacco-growers were
represented on the Parity Commission which fixes the
price of tobacco in Prance? —So far as I can gather
from the articles which I have read, the growers have
representation on that commission, but to what extent
I do not know.
5647. Does that not conflict with the statement you
made previously when I asked you in connexion with
the price-fixing of tobacco in France if the growers did
not participate in the fixing of prices, and when you
said, “ They have nothing to do with it; the Govern-
ment decises that ” ?—Perhaps I should qualify that
statement by saying that the growers have representa-
tion on the Parity Commission, which recommends to
the Government the price which should be paid. You
wall notice that for 1929 the President of the Council
of State actually fixed the price.
5648. Does it not seem that the Parity Commission,
which, I understand, consists of equal representation of
growers and government representatives, were unable
to reach an agreement, and that an independent person
in the form of the president was called in?— Yes.
5649. Would not that be the position here?— Yes; the
vital point in that was that the President of the Council
of State was a government official.
5650. When the commission could not agree, the pre-
sident was called in to decide?— Yes. That was what
happened in this case.
5651. On page 11 of your statement you quote a
letter to the director, which was read by Dr. Cameron.
When you refer to the director, do you mean yourself?
—Yes.
5652. You refer also to further official correspond-
ence. Was it subsequent to Dr. Cameron having given
that evidence?—Yo. It was not until after I had a
further letter from Mr, Wilkinson that I brought the
matter to the attention of the executive committee.
The reason I brought it before the committee at that
time was because I was attempting to impress upon it
the need for conducting chemical work on tobacco.
5653. Was it subsequent to the evidence of Dr.
Cameron that you got into correspondence with Mr.
Dixon?—Yo; all this correspondence was before that.
The substance of these two letters was this: The first
Australian tobacco which Mr, Hall and Mr. Dixon saw
"was some cigarettes taken over to America by Mr.
McGee, and on the basis of the tests they wrote me that
letter in which Mr. Dixon said that he thought the
problem could probably be solved by methods of pro-
cessing and handling. In his next letter he referred to
the sample of leaf tobacco which he had received from
Mr. Wilkinson, and in his next letter he reversed his
opinion, and said he did not think it was a matter of
processing and handling, and that the opinion previously
expressed was wrong. I felt that if the matter was to
be brought before the committee it should know what
Mr. Dixon’s later opinion on the matter was, as well as
his first opinion. His later opinion was after he had
the tobacco analyzed.
5654, By Mr. Jones. —The official figures from the
Customs Department show' that the quantity of Aus-
tralian leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco was in
1925-26, 1,153,288 lbs., and in 1927-28, 1,003,288 lbs.,
and that the percentage of Australian leaf used in
manufacture decreased from 6.6 in 1925-26 to 5,6 in
1927-28. Can you explain that decrease?—lt is due


to the general decrease in the consumption of dark
tobacco; as a fact, the public was then changing over
to light tobaccoes.
The witness withdrew.
help he can ?—I should like to have some assistance in
meeting the cost of erecting drying sheds, and shall
consider the suggestions you have made.
The witness withdrew).
The committee adjourned.
Robert Smith Creasy, gardener, Duntroon, Federal
Capital Territory, was called, sworn and examined.
5655. By the Chairman. —l understand that in con-
nexion with certain gardening operations which you
have been carrying out in the Federal Capital Terri-
tory, you have produced some tobacco leaf samples,
which you submit for the inspection of the committee ?
—Yes.
5656. I understand that you are anxious to ascertain
if some assistance can be given you to further experi-
ment in the production of tobacco?— Yes.
5657. Will you explain under what conditions you
have produced this leaf?— The samples which I pro-
duce are, of course, in only a very rough state, and
which I do not regard as tobacco. I produced them,
however, merely to show what, under very primitive
conditions, can be done in the Federal Capital Terri-
tory. This leaf has not, of course, been properly
handled. It was planted on the first day of this year,
and I cut it to exhibit it at the Queanbeyan Show, as in
that district tobacco leaf had not been shown. This leaf
was grown on what is known at Ho. 1 garden,
Duntroon, which is about 3 miles from Parliament
House. I put in about 100 plants, but did not irrigate
it; it is the ordinary light variety. If properly dried it
would, I think, he a success.
5658. What induced you to grow tobacco?— Veg-
etable growing in the Federal Capital Territory is not
a very profitable occupation, and I have, therefore,
been experimenting with certain other crops. I
originated from East Virginia, and was tobacco expert
for Hugh Dixon and Sons, and have grown and cured
leaf in the Molong, Wagga, Tumut, Tarcutta, and
Mangoplah districts.
5659. How long have you been here?— For three or
four years.
5660. How did you form the opinion that tobacco
could be grown here ?—I have always known that where
maize can be grown the tobacco plant will also flourish.
5661. But maize grows in heavy soil, and the infor-
mation we have received is that the best tobacco is
grown on light soil?— Providing you do not top it too
high.
5662. Is there much light, sandy soil in your locality?
—Yes.
5663. Would it be necessary to irrigate the tobacco
plant?— Yes. Some irrigation should be undertaken,
particularly when transplanting, but any such watering
could be done with the use of a water cart.
5664. You said that you required assistance. Do
you mean financial assistance?— Yes.
5665. I am afraid such assistance cannot be granted.
We have a Commonwealth tobacco expert who is always
willing to render any assistance in his power in the
direction of giving advice as to combating blue mould
and in the matter of curing tobacco leaf?— Tobacco
cannot be properly cured unless one has the proper
equipment in the matter of barns.
5666. The British-Australasian Tobacco company
will, if satisfied that the grower is capable of producing
a satisfactory leaf, advance the cost of flue-curing barns
and deduct the money from the crops produced. The
Commonwealth cannot grant financial assistance. If
you think that assistance of that kind would be of use
to you, I would suggest that you get into communica-
tion with Mr, Slagg, who, I know, will give you what
{Taken at Myrtleford, Victoria.)
SATURDAY, 24th MAY, 1930,
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr, Jones I Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens ( Mr. Tully.
(Air. C. E. Lough, representing the British-Australasian
Tobacco Co. Pty. Ltd.; Mr. F. B. Darling, repre-
senting the Victorian Tobacco Growers Associa-
tion ; Mr. C. M. Slagg, representing the Australian
Tobacco Investigation; and Mr. Temple Smith,
Tobacco Expert, Department of Agriculture, Vic-
toria.)
Francis Maurice Seares Rossiter, share-farmer and
tobacco-grower, Gapsted, was called, sworn and
examined.
5667. By the Chairman. —Do you represent any as-
sociation or organization in connexion with the tobacco-
growing industry?— Ho.
5668. How long have you been a grower of tobacco?
commenced in the season 1923-24 and continued
until 1926, when there was a break of two years. X
nave since completed a further two seasons. I have
been growing tobacco on shares and as a member of
a partnership.
0669. What area have you had under tobacco?—
The area has varied. When share-farming we had
ten acres between two of us. That continued for two
years. The third year I was one of a party of four
working on Mr. Gray’s land. We took 60 per cent, of
the proceeds between us. During the last two years
my brother-in-law and I have had respectively 14 and
IS acres under tobacco.
5670. Have the results proved satisfactory?— The
returns have not been good.
°671. Why did you give up tobacco-growing for
three years?—l married and went to Melbourne.
£>672. You must have thought there was something
m the industry to return to it ?—I returned for per-
sonal icasons, not because of the money I expected to
make.
5673 What has been your experience as a tobacco-
grower?—The first year was wet, and I received only
about £oo as my share. That year we had practically
no expense as we grew nearly all our own plants. The
following year my share was under £5O. That repre-
sented 25 per cent, of the crop. The third year each
or tne tour of us who were working on Mr. Gray’s
property received about £l3O gross, or about £lOO net
A little later we sold about a ton of second grade
tobacco, and each received another £7 10s. The year
belore last my share amounted to about £l5O from
which a tow expenses had to be deducted. The third
year was a good one. We received altogether shorn
£4OO between the four of us, from about 20 acres
5G74 What was the quality ?_Tho yield was poor.
We lost a good deal on account of rains and frost
AAT s6 v s ‘i H^ Ve W ll been troub led with blue mould?—
We had a lot of it the first two years.
5676. Was all the tobacco flue-cured ?—Yes. There
were barns on the place.


5677. What proportion of bright tobacco did you
obtain?—At first about 50 per cent., but later less than
that.
5678. What was your best price?— About 2s. 4|d.
a pound.
5679. What acreage did you have in 1928?— About
fourteen acres altogether of which the partners had
about eight, and the shareman slightly less than eight
acres.
5680. Were you troubled with blue mould that year?
—There was mould in the plants to begin with.
5681. What was the yield for the fourteen acres—
About 52 hundredweight.
5682. What proportion of bright tobacco did that
contain? —I think it was less than 50 per cent, I
was away when the crop was sold.
5683. How do you account for such a large per-
centage of dark tobacco? —I think the dry year had a
lot to do with it.
5684. Was the crop irrigated?— No. It was a
difficult piece of land to irrigate; although I believe
that in 1926, when Mr. McGee had some plants on it,
the land was irrigated.
5685. What price did you receive in 1928?— The
average was about 3s. lOd. a pound.
5686. What was your best price that year?—l could
not say.
5687. What was your profit that year?— About £lBO.
The other partners made about the same.
5688. Is that a sufficient inducement to keep in the
business ?—No.
5689. What did you get for the 1929 crop?—lt has
not yet been sold. It is all cured and is now awaiting
a buyer. We expect him about August, September or
October.
5690. What was your yield?— About four tons.
5691. What proportions of bright leaf did you
obtain?—lt is impossible to say, for it has not yet
been graded. There appears to be only a small per-
centage of bright tobacco.
5692. Then you can hardly expect to receive a high
price for it this year?— The little that I had graded
is equal to that for which I previously received 2s. a
pound.
5693. Will you be satisfied if you get 2s. a pound?—
Yes, if the whole crop averages that amount.
5694. Would that not be a high average?— There is
some bright leaf, and the dark leaf is of good quality.
5695. Are you aware that the British-Australasian
Tobacco Coy. is not keen on buying dark tobacco?—
I know it does not want the very dark leaf.
5696. Would you describe your leaf as a bright
mahogany ?—Yes.
5697. Have you received any assistance from the
Victorian Department of Agriculture?— Yes. I have
had considerable assistance from Mr. Marks. I also
received assistance from the department while work-
ing with Bae Bros., Mr. Figgis and Mr. Gray.
5698. Do you do your own curing?—ln the first
two years I was learning from Bae Bros, and Mr.
Figgis. When at Mr. Gray’s I looked after the kilns
at night.
5699. Do you regard yourself as an efficient curer?—
I do not consider that I am an expert; but I have a
fair knowledge of curing.
5700. Have you spoiled' many barns?— Only one
barn in which I was interested was completely spoiled.
5701. Have you tried different varieties of seed and
different soils?—We act on the recommendation of
departmental experts.
5702. Have they said that your soil is satisfactory?
—Yes.
5703. Have they advised in regard to the varieties
of tobacco to plant?— Yes. Mr. Temple Smith has
done that.
5704. Has he inspected your crop at any time?— Yes.
5705. Have you found that he is always ready to
give advice? —Yes.
5706. Are you satisfied that you are adopting right
methods?— Yes.
5707. What would you say is the reason for the poor
prices you have received. Is it that you are not grow-
ing a good type of tobacco, or is the company not pay-
ing a fair price?— The company’s price varies so
much that it is impossible to say what a crop will
bring.
5708. What are the reasons for those variations in
price?—l can only make a wild guess. It may be that
the company is trying to discipline growers into grow-
ing only bright tobacco.
5709. Do you expect the company to buy tobacco that
is not good?— No.
5710. Has the company’s buyer ever complained that
your tobacco is not the sort that he wants ?—He has said
that with respect to some of the lower grades, but not
to the crop as a whole.
5711. Has he ever told you that you are working on
wrong lines?— No.
5712. Have you put much money into the industry?
—No. I have been on shares all the time, and have
had not to erect any plant.
5713. Have you read the literature available on to-
bacco-growing?—l have read all the books on the sub-
ject that I could get hold of.
5714. Are you a member of the local Tobacco
Growers’ Association?— No. I have never been the
owner of a farm.
5715. Do you know whether the local association
does anything to keep its members up to date in re-
spect of tobacco-growing, curing and grading?— No.
5716. Do they have lectures on those subjects?—l
understand that they have field days and lectures.
5717. Do you attend them?—l was at Mr. Gray’s
when the field day there was held.
5718. Did the farmers attend it well?— Yes.
5719. Do you think that the tobacco-growers in
the district are keenly desirous of improving their
leaf?— They all ■seem to take a great interest in any
new idea.
5720. Can you give any reasons for not having made
greater profits ?—I think that the excise duty should
be reduced. That would encourage local manufacturers
to buy more Australian leaf.
5721. Do you think that there is sufficient com-
petition among the buyers?— Greater competition
would assist the industry. We had an example of
that last year. All the tobacco that was left on our
hands after the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
buyer had visited us was bought by the Michelides
Company, of Western Australia. Their buyer bought
all our second grade and dark tobacco. Dor the dark
he paid Is. Id. and for second grade 6d. a pound. He
bought no bright tobacco at all. I wish it to be under-
stood that we had no bright to offer as that had been
bought by the British-Australasian Tobacco Company.
5722. Has he come to you again?—l understand that
he coming again this year. Last year was his first
visit.
5723. Does the fact that he is in the field as a
buyer make you more optimistic as regards the future?
—The more buyers the better. If the Michelides
Company can afford to give us the prices mentioned for
inferior tobacco, it makes the outlook more promising.
5724. Was that tobacco refused by the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company?— Yes.
5725. If the Michelides Company had not come
along would you have been a heavy loser?—We did
not have a great quantity to sell that company.
5726. Will the Western Australian company buy
unlimited quantities ?—I understand that it is prepared
to buy whole crops this year.
5727. Have you seen Mr, Panlook’s plant?— Not
until this morning.


5728. Were t you impressed with the possibilities of
the new system?— Yes.
5729. Do you think it would help to improve the
quality and colour of your leaf if you could adopt his
curing methods?—l think so. I should like to put a
quantity of our own leaf into his barn. Mr. Pan-
look’s leaf was better to begin with than ours was.
5730. Are you a smoker?— Yes.
5731. Have you tried any Australian brands of
tobacco?— Yes. At present I am smoking “Luxor”’
cigarette tobacco which I understand is Australian.
“ Gold Bar,” another Australian tobacco, I found satis-
factory. It was made by Dudgeon & Arnell.
5732. Is the tobacco made by the Western Aus-
tralian company good?— Yes.
5733. Is it all Australian?—l believe it is. I have
not seen the packets in which the cigarettes are packed.
5734. Did you know that it was Australian tobacco
when you smoked it ?—Ho. I was given the tobacco to
make my r own cigarettes to smoke; later I was asked
what I thought of them.
5735. Did thev burn your tongue or make you feel
sick?— Ho.
5736. By Air. Martens. —Did you notice any
eucalyptus taint?— Ho.
5737. By the Chairman. —Have you tried any Aus-
tralian pipe tobacco, excepting “ Gold Bar ” ?—I smoke
only cigarettes.
5738. What is your opinion of the statement that
there is some fundamental fault with Australian to-
bacco?—l am not a judge of tobacco. I base my view
regarding the abolition of the excise on what took place
in South Africa. When the excise was taken off there
the grade of local-grown tobacco improved. Twenty
years ago scarcely any one had a good word to say for
South African tobacco. To-day Rhodesian tobacco is
used in several brands of cigarettes made in England.
5739. Are you prepared to try any Australian to-
bacco ?—Yes.
5740. By Mr. Jones. —When were you working on
shares with Mr. Gray?—ln the 1925-26 season.
5741. Did you regard your returns as satisfactory?—
Ho, In my opinion the leaf was worth more than we
received.
5742. Do you agree with the statement of a witness
that, if Australians were compelled to smoke Australian
tobacco, smoking would decrease by 50 per cent.?—
Ho. There would be trouble for a while, but before
long they would all be smoking Australian tobacco. In
my opinion, it is only a matter of educating smokers
to use it. It might be necessary to blend it with
other tobacco for a time. That is the idea of Mr.
Michelides.
5743. Do you think that if the excise were abolished
on all tobacco, and the import duty increased corres-
pondingly, the Australian industry wnuld be stimu-
lated?— Yes. If the Australian tobacco were a good
deal cheaper than the imported tobacco Australians
would use it.
5744. Would you expect to get a good smoking to-
bacco from bad varieties, badly cultivated and badly
cured?—Ho grower would deliberately grow leaf which
experts grade as inferior. All growers are prepared to
accept the advice of the experts. They are always de-
sirous of improving.
5745. Do you think that smokers would become accus-
tomed to smoking tobacco which had a nasty taste,
burnt the tongue, and parched the throat ?—I think we
can produce better tobacco than that.
5746. We have had evidence by two experts in Hew
South Wales and one in Queensland that most Aus-
tralian tobacco is unpleasant ?—I have not come across
an Australian tobacco of that kind. The general
smoking public might approve of a type of tobacco to
which the experts objected.
5747. By Mr. Martens. —Do you smoke “Capstan”
cigarettes?— Yes.
0748. Are they better than the Australian cigarettes
you have smoked?—l do not prefer one to the other.
Usually I make my own cigarettes from “ Champion ”
tobacco.
5749. Why do most people smoke “Capstan” cigar-
ettes?— Probably because they are the cheapest and the
most advertised. If smokers would get over their preju-
dice against Australian tobacco, it would he all right.
5750. Do you think that the average smoker can
tell the difference between tobaccoes ?—When “ Gold
Bar ” cigarettes were available, they seemed to like it.
5751. By Mr. Slagg. —Do you know whether “ Luxor ”
tobacco is all Australian ?—I understand that it is Aus-
tralian tobacco, but I cannot say for certain that it is.
It is made by the Michelides Company in Western
Australia, which I know T buys large quantities of Aus-
tralian leaf.
5752. If you knew that it contained only a small
quantity of Australian leaf would your opinion of it
alter?— Ho. It would still be the same tobacco. I
regard “ Capstan ” cigarettes as good cigarettes,
although they are made of American tobacco.
The witness withdrew.
Hicholas Clemens, farmer and tobacco-grower, Myrtle-
ford, was called, sworn and examined.
5753. By the Chairman. —Do you belong to the
local Tobacco Growers Association?— Yes.
5754. How long have you been growing tobacco? —
Hine years. Eirst I worked on shares, but now I
am on my own. My son is with me.
5755. What area have you under crop?— About ten
acres.
5756. What is the nature of the soil?— Heavy, sandy
soil on the river flat.
5757. Do you irrigate the land?— Last year I
irrigated it for the first time with a Hunan spray.
5758. How many barns have you?— Two, one of
brick and one of iron. The brick kiln cost over £200;
the iron kiln cost about £lOO.
5759. Which is the more satisfactory kiln ?—The iron
one.
5760. How have you been getting on?— Each year
both the colour and the price have been better.
5761. Do you get good crops?—Eairly good. The
average yield for the ten acres would be between 700
lb. and 800 lb. This year we expect to get about
five tons.
5762. Do you produce a considerable proportion of
bright leaf?—We produce a good grade of leaf.
5763. Do you do your own curing?— Yes.
5764. Have you had any instructions in curing?—
I have attended demonstrations given by Mr. Marks.
5765. Do you think that you can turn out a good
tobacco?— Yes; I submit a sample.
5766. Have you had any complaints from buyers as
to the way you have cured your tobacco?— Ho.
5767. Has there been a steady improvement in regard
to bright leaf?— Yes; a big improvement. Last year
our sales totalled about five tons, three tons of which
comprised grades above mahogany. For the mahogany
I received Is. 8-Jd. a lb. The bright leaf brought from
2s. to 2s. 4fd., in addition to a bonus of Is.
5768. Were you satisfied with the prices you re-
ceived?— Last year I was satisfied.
5769. Do you think you got those prices because of
the improved quality of your leaf?— Yes.
5770. You felt encouraged to continue to improve
your leaf?— Yes.


5771. Are you satisfied that if you can produce a
good leaf of bright colour you will get a decent price
for it?— The company has raised its grades. It is
difficult to get the same proportion of what it calls
bright leaf as formerly.
5772. Do you think that the buyer has become more
exacting—that the more you improve your leaf, the
more improvement he wants?— Yes.
5773. When did that change of attitude take place?
—This year.
5774. Do you think that, notwithstanding the im-
provement you have made, the leaf is still not good
enough?—We expect to get better. The increased price
paid to us last year shows that the company appreciated
the improved quality.
5775. Last year for your bright leaf you received 3s.
including bonus? Were you satisfied with that
price?— Yes, for last year’s crop; but for some of this
year’s crop I hope to get more.
5776. Did you average 2s. a lb. last year?—l think
the average was a little more than that.
5777. Would you regard an average of 2s. all round
as profitable?— Hot unless it includes the dark tobacco.
5778. Will the company buy the dark grades?— Only
a percentage.
5779. Are you getting much dark tobacco? —Ho.
5780. Then in what way are you dissatisfied?—l con-
sider that the grade of tobacco that I am now growing
is the best I have yet produced. It should bring a
better price.
5781. Is the sample you have submitted a specially
good one? —It is a fair, average sample. I expect to
have some better.
5782. The leaf is somewhat broken. Do you know
that that is an objection to Australian leaf —The buyer
has not objected to my leaf on that ground. Any leaf
will break if it is handled when dry.
5783. Do you do your own grading?—My daughters
and son do the grading.
5784. Have they received any tuition?— Yes. Mr.
Lough gave them some tuition this year.
5785. Did he volunteer to do it?— The association
asked the company to allow Mr. Lough to give growers
tuition in grading. We were very pleased that the
company consented to do so.
5786. Did the association offer to pay for its ser-
vices?—I do not know.
5787. Did your daughters and son pick up the grad-
ing quickly?— Yes. They have been grading for a
number of years. The British-Australasian Tobacco
Company has always bought my tobacco.
5788. Would you say that because of the instructions
received in grading your leaf showed an improvement?
—Yes.
5789. Do you regard that as a good act on the part
of the company?— Yes. The company has done the
growers many good turns.
5790. As, apparently, you are of the opinion that
the company has treated you well, what is the cause
of your discontent?—l think we should get a better
price for an improved article.
5791. But were you not satisfied with the 3s. 4Jd.
you received last year for your bright leaf ?—Last year
we received an additional 6d. bonus. After I received
that bonus I was satisfied.
5792. Would you prefer a better price and no bonus?
—Yes. I think we should be paid a straight-out price
for our tobacco, and that there should be no bonus.
5793. Are you satisfied to continue growing Tobacco
under present conditions? —Yes.
5794. Then it must pay you?— Yes.
5795. Do you consider that you have improved your
leaf during recent years?— Yes. My sales show that.
5796. Have your neighbours improved their leaf?
—I do not know.
5797. Do you ever inspect their crops?— Ho.
Tobacco-growing is an industry which requires careful
attention. I am fully occupied on my own block and
have not time to inspect my neighbours’ crops.
5798. Are you a smoker? —Ho.
5799. Is your son a smoker?—lSTo.
5800. Have you formed any opinion as to the best
way to induce Australians to smoke Australian leaf?
—Ho.
5801. I take it that your interest in the industry
begins and ends with the production of good tobacco
and the selling of it?— Yes.
5802. By Mr. Martens. —Do you attend the meetings
of the local association?— Yes.
5803. Are the discussions that take place generally
as to the prices received for tobacco?— Yes, at some
meetings, but not at all of them.
5804. Have you gathered the impression that the
class of leaf in the district generally has improved?—
I could not say whether it has improved or not.
5805. Do you hear other growers express dissatisfac-
tion with the prices received for their tobacco? —Yes,
in a number of instances.
5806. Do you think that the growers generally would
prefer a straight-out price and no bonus?— That is the
general feeling among them.
5807. Would you have felt more contented if you
had received 3s. a lb. straight-out for your tobacco
instead of that amount, including a bonus?— Yes.
5808. By the Chairman. —Do you think that your
best leaf is worth 4s. alb ?—I hope to get that amount
for it this year.
5809. By Mr. Darling. —ls it correct that last year
you grew about 60 per cent, of bright leaf and 40 per
cent of dark and mahogany?— Those were about the
proportions.
5810. Are you aware that in the coming year the
British-Australasian Company will buy only 10 per
cent, of your dark and mahogany leaf?— Yes.
5811. Will you be satisfied with that arrangement?
—Ho.
5812. By the Chairman. —Does the company include
mahogany in its definition of dark tobacco?—l do not
understand that that is so. I understand that the
10 per cent, applies only to dark tobacco, not to the
mahogany.
The ivitness withdrew.
William Banlook, Managing Director of Panlook
Brothers Proprietary Limited, farmers, tobacco-
growers and hop-growers, Eurobin, was called,
sworn and examined.
5813. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
in the tobacco-growing business?— About 30 years,
either for myself or for the company. I commenced at
a time when Mr. Bondurant was brought to Victoria to
instruct tobacco-growers. There was then no mention
of flue curing. When the crop was grown the plant
was split down the stem and cut off. Ho differentia-
tion was made between good, bad and indifferent leaf.
Prequently the tobacco w r as allowed to wilt in the field.
Later, they were put over some sticks and subjected to
a process known as sun curing. The balance of the pro-
cess was carried out in crude barns or sheds. In those
days there w T as very little complaint about the quality
of the tobacco. The principal complaint w r as the poor
prices which growers received. Later, blue mould
appeared. It did not take an expert to decide that most
of the tobacco grown in Victoria in those days was in-
ferior to tobacco imported from other countries. It
required only about three whiffs of the Australian
tobacco to send a man kicking. Any one who wanted
ten whiffs was a glutton. Yet all the tobacco then
produced was bought by the companies which then


existed—Dudgeon and Arnell, Cameron, and others. I
do not suppose it was used as bedding for horses. It
must have been manufactured and smoked by Aus-
tralians. After about eight or ten years the flue curing
system was introduced into Victoria. Acting on the
advice of Mr. Temple Smith, Mr. Marks and others,
we were able to make a start with the new system.
About twelve years ago we grew seventeen or twenty
tons of tobacco. We should have been delighted if we
could then have picked out from that quantity a couple
of dozen leaves similar to that in the sample just pro-
duced by Mr. Clemens. Since those early days growers
have been trying hard to produce a better leaf. In my
opinion, they have been highly successful. They have
paid strict attention to the business, and have erected
barns at considerable expense, with the result that to-
day they are producing an article which is much
superior to tobacco produced ten or twelve years ago.
The worst flue-cured tobacco grown to-day is far
superior to the very best tobacco grown 30 years ago.
Australia has the opportunity to do something to
relieve the depression caused by the adverse trade
balance, and at the same time to provide employment
and assist decentralization. Australia to-day produces
about 10 per cent, of her tobacco requirements.
Scientists tell us after careful analyses and tests, that it
is good tobacco, although its aroma is a little different
to that of American tobacco. They say that there is
a suspicion of turpentine or eucalyptus in it. In my
opinion, it w T ould be a good thing if Australians could
be forced to smoke Australian tobacco. At first, our
10 per cent, could be mixed with 90 per cent. American
tobacco, and later, the percentage of Australian to-
bacco could be increased. That would not only keep
money in the country, but it would also provide em-
ployment in a decentralized industry. I have been a
smoker for over 20 years, during which period I have
smoked all kinds of tobacco. At one time I smoked
Derby, a very strong tobacco. How I smoke Capstan
cigarettes. It is all a matter of getting accustomed to
the kind tobacco. I suggest that the Government
should restrict the importation of tobacco, and require
manufacturers to use Australian tobacco in a blend
with foreign tobacco. In time the public taste would
be cultivated in favour of Australian tobacco, so that
they would not care whether or not the embargo on
foreign tobacco was lifted.
5814. Do you find tobacco-growing a profitable in-
dustry ?—Ho. I have lost a lot of money in it, but that
is largely due to the experiments that I have made. In
1924 and 1925 I believe I had a distinction of being the
largest grower of tobacco and hops in Australia. That
year I lost about £1,500. Blue mould ruined that year’s
crop. The following year we had a good crop; but I
lost more money that year than I did the previous year.
That was because I experimented in unsuitable barns.
For that loss Ido not blame the tobacco or the buyer;
the experiments were responsible.
5815. What has been the results of your experiments
so far ?—They have shown that many of the difficulties
can be overcome.
5816. Have you made up the losses in more recent
years?—l have not had an opportunity to do so. I
experimented until about three years ago, when I be-
came so disgusted that I said I would not touch the
tobacco _ industry again. But there is something
fascinating about the business. I found that I could
not resist the temptation to go back into it.
5817. Would you say that your losses have been due
to your experiments?— Ho. The losses that I and
others have made have been due chiefly to blue mould.
5818. Have you experimented in the direction of
overcoming blue mould?— Yes; but without much suc-
cess. Blue mould has been overcome to some extent by
obtaining our seedlings or plants from warmer areas.
Seedlings froin warmer places and brought here and
transplanted with fairly satisfactory results.
5819. Do growers place mould-free seedlings into
mouldy ground?— The whole district is subject to blue
mould at times. Tobacco is a precarious crop. One
season out of three might produce a good crop. Dor
that reason the price should be good ; the average for
the three years will be poor otherwise.
5820. Has the Department of Agriculture in Vic-
toria made any efforts to combat blue mould?— Yes.
At Hutherglen there is an experimental plot. The
efforts of the department have probably been the cause
of growers going to warmer districts for their seedlings.
5821. Are you aware that scientific experiments
carried out at Canberra indicate that if mould-free
seedlings are put into mouldy land, blue mould is sure
to make its appearance?—! am not aware of that. T
have given the result of experiments in this district. I
have known land which was badly infested with blue
mould one year to produce a good crop of tobacco the
next year.
5822. By Mr. Martens. —Were the seasons similar?
—I cannot say.
5823. By the Chairman. —Have you read any state-
ments by the Federal Bureau of Science and Industry
giving directions to growers as to the best way to mini-
mize blue mould?— Yes.
5824. Do their arguments appeal to you?— Yes.
5825. Do you consider that you know sufficient about
the cultivation of tobacco to produce a good type of
leaf? Yes. At the same time I am always ready to
learn more.
5826. Then you do not blame yourself for the some-
what unsatisfactory results?— Ho.
582 i. You have been troubled with blue mould and
with your inability to cure a leaf in a manner satis-
factory to yourself?— Yes. I do not claim to have pro-
duced a leaf wdiich could command a first-class price,
and, therefore, I am not disappointed with the prices
I have received.
0828. Do you think that faulty methods of curing
have retarded the progress of the industry?— Faulty
methods of curing have been responsible for the waste
of large quantities of good tobacco placed in the barns.
5829. Would you expect the company to buy tobacco
that is badly cured?—Ho; that would be unreasonable.
5830. Was that what led you to make radical
alterations in the method of curing tobacco?— Yes. I
was so disheartened that on one occasion I went to
Melbourne and left my crop of about 50 tons to the
foreman to do the best he could with it. I was afraid
that I would go mad if I remained to deal with it. I
was surprised on my return to find that Mr. Lough, the
buyer for the British-Australasian Tobacco Company,
had bought most of it at very satisfactory prices. The
portion rejected by him—about six or eight tons —
I am using for spraying hops. I obtained the consent
of the Customs Department to use it in that way.
Since Mr. Lough came to our assistance the quality of
the leaf has improved immensely. Ido not claim that
the new system of curing will produce good tobacco
from bad leaf; but I believe that it will produce good
tobacco from good leaf. It will reduce the waste which
now spoils a lot of good tobacco. The new system will
not make up for poor soil, wrong climate, and wrong
methods of irrigating and fertilizing. Given a good
leaf, I believe that, besides reducing waste to a mini-
mum, the new system will produce a better tobacco.
Some of my friends who previously regarded me as
an hot air fanatic have congratulated me on the result
of my experiments.
5831. What percentage of wastage has the new
system eliminated?— About 50 per cent.


5832. Can you get 100 per cent, bright tobacco from
your barn ?—lt is all a matter of comparison. One year
I sold for £3,500 a crop of tobacco which cost £5,500
to produce.
5833. Was not that loss largely due to your ex-
periments ?—Yes.
5834. Were they not costly experiments? —The
trouble was that we were trying to dry tobacco by
the fan system in a barn which w T as too big. The
barn measured 50 ft. x 25 ft. x 20 ft., and contained
nine tiers, or about 3,000 sticks of tobacco. Once the
process commenced, we had to carry on with it.
5835. Have you prepared any estimates of the work-
ing costs of your new system?— Ho. But it is not a
very expensive system.
5836. Do you think that the average grower will he
able to master the details? —Yes. The system is the
old system better controlled. Any grower with a
knowledge of curing tobacco would incur very little
risk in adopting the new system.
5837. Do you think that the system, properly applied,
might produce 90 per cent, of bright tobacco? —It
might produce even 100 per cent.
5838. Have you patented the process?—l have ap-
plied for patent rights.
5839. Do you not think that the new system will
be too costly for most growers ?—They will have to con-
sider whether the cost will be worth while.
5840. If the system is to be used generally, will it
not need to be available at reasonable costs?— Yes.
I have considered that matter. I would not recommend
growers to adopt the new system hurriedly. Hext
season I intend to give it a thorough trial and to
build auxiliary furnaces. The principle underlying the
new system is to create an even temperature and even
humidity throughout the barn from top to bottom.
The experiments so far have not been so successful
as we anticipated because the underground tunnel, in-
stead of discharging dry air, accumulated moisture
and discharged moist air. Hext year I hope to over-
come that disability.
5841. Have you smoked Australian tobacco? —Yes.
I have tried nearly every brand of Australian tobacco,
and found it satisfactory.
5842. If you had nothing else to smoke would you be
satisfied to smoke Australian tobacco? —Yes. In my
time I have smoked tea leaves, roots, and other
materials rather than go without a smoke. If the
Government would take the hull by the horns and
ration the importation of tobacco, it would give the
Australian industry a decided impetus.
5843. I am not assuming that smokers should smoke
Australian tobacco only as a last resort. Do you as a
smoker consider that Australian tobacco is quite satis-
factory?— Yes. It is only a matter of getting used
to it. In Canada and elsewhere smokers continued
to smoke locally-grown tobacco after the embargo on
imported tobacco had been lifted. I think the result
would be the same in Australia. I have grown so
accustomed to Capstan cigarettes that, although I
sometimes smoke better brands of cigarettes I do not
feel satisfied until I get back to Capstan.
5844. Do you think that Capstan cigarettes are
unique among cigarettes, or that your taste has been
cultivated to like them?— There are better cigarettes
than Capstans; but I have got used to that variety.
It is possible that if they were not available, and I
had to smoke purely Australian cigarettes, I should
prefer them to Capstans.
5845. By Mr. Martens. —Do you not think it would
be an advantage to you if you were to meet the scientists
who are carrying out investigations at Canberra?—l
think it would be a benefit. I may visit Canberra for
that purpose.
5846. By Mr. Jones. —l take it that your idea is
to ration the importation of tobacco?— Yes, and to
require Australian manufacturers to blend Australian
leaf with imported leaf. At first, the proportion of im-
ported leaf might be as high as 90 per cent, the propor-
tion to be reduced as Australian production increased.
5847. You regard it as a measure of reciprocity to
limit the quantity of American leaf coming here in
view of the restrictions against Australian goods enter-
ing the United States of America?— Yes.
5848. Do you think that that result would be brought
about by increasing the import duty?— Yes. I suggest
a prohibitive duty.
5849. Are you aware that in Western Australia the
percentage of Australian leaf used in the blend in-
creased from 7 per cent, to over 12 per cent, in one
year?—l am not surprised.
5850. A report by the Imperial Institute, London,
dated 13th August, 1928, after enumerating certain
defects in samples of Australian tobacco, concluded as
follows;—
The chief cause of these defects is, no doubt, insufficient
or unsatisfactory curing, which may be due to the small
quantity of leaf being treated.
Does your experience bear out that conclusion?— Yes.
In dealing with tobacco I have been assisted by my
experience in treating hops.
5851. Would you say that any defects in Australian
tobacco are due to insufficient or unsatisfactory cur-
ing?—l am not a position to say so definitely, but
possibly that is so to some extent.
5852. By Mr. Darling. —You said that you thought
you could get 90 per cent, bright leaf. Would you
expect to get that percentage in all seasons throughout
the whole district?— Ho. But if the right sort of tobacco
is planted, and properly attended to, I should not be
surprised if 90 per cent, of bright leaf were ob-
tained in a season, although over a number of sea-
sons the percentage might be less.
The witness withdrew.
Ralph Selzer, farmer, Ovens, was called, sworn and
examined.
5853. By Mr. Morgan. —Have you any direct in-
terest in tobacco growing ?—I have been growing tobacco
for about twelve years.
5854. What has been the average area under culti-
vation?—About fifteen acres.
5855. Have your returns been satisfactory?—l have
received about £7O or £BO an acre gross.
5856. What was the average price per pound?—
Last year it was about Is. 10|d.
5857. Did you consider that satisfactory?—l was
satisfied at the time, but if dark tobacco is to be cut
out by the company, I shall not be satisfied.
5858. What percentage of bright tobacco did you
produce ?—More than half of my crop was bright
tobacco.
5859. How do you account for such a low average
price with such a high percentage of bright tobacco?
—Bright tobacco brings about 3s. a pound. The
other grades range from Is. to Is. 6d. a pound. The
average would be about Is. I sold some bright
tobacco last year for Is. lOd. and Is. lid. a pound, with
only 3d. a pound bonus. For the first grade tobacco I
should have received 4s. a pound. Instead, I received
only 3s. 4|d. for it including Is. bonus. That formed a
very small percentage of my crop.
5860. Do you include mahogany in bright tobacco?
—Ho.
5861. How did you neighbours fare?— About the
same.


5862. How coi}ld the industry best be helped?—By
the abolition of the excise duty. That, we could hope,
would result in an increased price to the grower for
Australian tobacco; this increase in price would enable
the grower to equip his farm with the most modern
improvements which are very necessary for the proper
growing, curing and treatment of good tobacco leaf.
5863. You regard that as better than a bonus ?—I
do not like a bonus.
0864. Would you favour increasing the import duty?
—Yes. What the Government would lose by abolishing
the excise duty should be obtained from higher im-
port duties.
5865. Are you aware of the agreement entered into
by the Commonwealth and the States for the carrying
out of experiments?— Yes.
5866. Have you read the literature published on
the subject And the evidence given before this com-
mittee ?—Yes.
5867, Are you in favour of. the experiments being
continued ?—Yes.
5868. Do you think that the control should be taken
from the Federal authorities and placed in the hands
of the States ?—Ho. I think that central control
is better.
5869. By Mr. Temple Smith. —ls it correct that
when you worked for Mr. Leslie Eae he simply raked
over a field which had proved a failure because of
blue mould and planted new seeds in the soil and yet
obtained good tobacco?— Yes. I was instrumental in,
and responsible for, the forming of the seed-beds
mentioned. I planted all the seed and had full care and
charge of same. When blue mould, resulting from the
initial sowing, attacked the seedlings, I personally
raked them off and re-sowed the same beds with seed
from the same source of supply. This second sowing
proved so successful that my crop was quite satisfactory.
5870. By Mr. Morgan. —Are you particularly appre-
hensive regarding blue mould?—l think that if the
conditions are suitable for blue mould it will be found
in this district or any other district, while such
conditions prevail. The second planting on Mr. Bae’s
property was made under different conditions, with the
result that the blue mould did not appear, and we
obtained a good crop.
587 L By Mr. Jones. —Do you think that blue mould
makes its appearance periodically?— Hot periodically,
but according to climatic conditions.
The witness withdrew.
Frederick Brooke Darling, tobacco grower, Cheshnut,
President of the Victorian Tobacco Growers’ As-
sociation, was recalled and further examined.
5872. By Mr. Morgan. —Would you be good enough
to explain the action taken by your association with
reference to obtaining the services of a tobacco grader?
Last year the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
left a larger quantity of tobacco unbought than in any
previous year. The executive of the association was
requested by the Myrtleford branch to do something
with regard to the disposal of that tobacco. It was
suggested that we should approach the company again.
My association asked the company to take the rejected
leaf into its factory and regrade it, to buy that por-
tion which was considered suitable, and 1 to reject the
balance. The directors said that they did not have
sufficient accommodation to undertake the grading of
the leaf in the factory, but that they were prepared
to send a man to the various farms where large quan-
tities of leaf had been rejected with a view to indicat-
ing to growers what leaf would be purchased if properly
graded. The company arranged for growers to re-grade
their tobacco under the supervision of the company’s
expert. It did not give any undertaking as to what
percentage it would purchase. The main trouble with
the leaf was its uneven grading. I understood that the
chairman’s question and the answer of the witness
referred to last year’s crop.
The witness withdrew.
Charles Edward, Lough, senior leaf buyer for the
British-Australasian Tobacco Go. Pty, Ltd., was
recalled and further examined.
5873. To Mr. Morgan. —Mr, Darling referred to last
year’s crop. I was under the impression that the
matter referred to by the association was the grading
of this year’s crop. I am here to grade this year’s
crop—not last year’s crop —at the request of the
association.
5874. By Mr. Morgan. —Does your company include
mahogany in its definition of dark tobacco?— That
matter has already been explained 'by one of the
directors of the company.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
(Taken at Canberra.)
THURSDAY, 29th MAY, 1930.
Present:
Mr, Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones
Mr. Tully.
Mr. Martens
(Mr. C. M. Siagg, representing the Australian Tobacco
Investigation.)
Herbert William Gepp, Chairman of the Development
and Migration Commission, and Chairman of the
Executive Committee of the Australian Tobacco
Investigation, was recalled and further examined.
5875. By the Chairman. —Have you a statement for
submission to the Committee?— Yes. Dr. A. C. D.
Rivett has already submitted to you on behalf of the
executive committee a progress report which, at the
time of its compilation, and as no previous evidence had
then been submitted by any interests to the select com-
mittee, seemed to cover all the detailed information
regarding the work of the investigation which it was
presumed the select committee would require. How-
ever, I have had an opportunity of studying the evi-
dence submitted to the select committee, and at this
stage I desire to express appreciation of your courtesy
in making it available. From this portion of the evi-
dence it would appear that certain points have arisen
which call either for an amplification of the notes in
the progress report previously submitted, or for com-
ments by myself as chairman of the executive com-
mittee. The first point is that there would appear
to be an impression that the executive committee did
not take all necessary steps to counter the press reports
which appeared at one time suggesting or alleging that
there was a fundamental defect in Australian tobacco
m. I 1 ) 6 form of a eucalyptus taint and/or that the
existing areas of production were unsuitable and that,
if leaf of the desired qualities were to be grown a
“ change-over ” to new areas, notably Horth Queens-
land, would have to be effected. These unauthorized
press reports were given the closest consideration by
the executive committee, and two statements were issued
by myself, copies of which I hand you, with my col-
leagues’ full concurrence, dissociating the executive
from and deprecating the immature and unauthorized
statements which it was felt would possibly harm the


existing growing interests. I also stated definitely
that the conclusions drawn were unproved. These
statements were issued to the press in all States, and
were published. It was as impossible then as it is now
for the executive committee to state that there is, or
is not, a eucalyptus taint in Australian tobacco, and sub-
stantiate the statement with scientific data. It does
not for one moment believe there is such a taint, and
in that is at ond with others who have given evidence;
but the investigation is essentially a fact-finding institu-
tion, and as such must of necessity conduct its inquiries
and make its announcements upon a basis of scientific
inquiry. Though primarily concerned with the ascer-
taining of facts, the executive, however, is not uncon-
cerned with the welfare of the industry, and I wish
most strongly to emphasize that the form of the dis-
claimer to the press reports which it issued, and the
subsequent reluctance to keep alive the press contro-
versy, were based upon the most serious and thoughtful
concern for the industry's welfare. Subsequently, as
was expected, the authoritative statements of the
executive, and its refusal to reopen the question, had the
desired effect, and the press controversy died away. In
this connexion, it is of interest to note the following
extract from the minutes of the executive committee
of 16th October, 1928:
Dr. Cameron observed that at a recent agricultural con-
ference it was pleasing to note that the various tobacco-
growers were unanimous in their satisfaction of the wmrk
done by the investigation, which showed that the recent pub-
licity given to its work had had no harmful effects.
The “ recent publicity ” referred to by Dr, Cameron is
that associated with the unauthorized publication of
reports on the aroma question. The second point
arising out of the evidence is what I regard as the
adverse criticism of the executive committee, and of its
chief technical officer, Mr, C. M. Slagg, by one of its
members, Dr. S. S. Cameron. In reply to question
3831
After three years you consider that the experiment of
having Commonwealth control of field work is not worth
while, and that now that the three years are up we should
terminate it and hand the control back to the States?
Dr. Cameron is reported to have replied—
During those three years, the tobacco investigation has been
engaged on work that, to my mind, there is no justification
for continuing. The results have not been such as, in my
opinion, to justify the continuance of that class of work.
In reply to question 3897
Do you not think that ten years is the minimum period
in which we can expect to get from the work that is being
carried on by Mr. Slagg the maximum results for the expendi-
ture that is incurred?
Dr. Cameron is reported to have replied—
I do not think that the co-ordination of the work, along the
lines on which it has been carried on by Mr. Slagg, so far
as what is alleged to be the main problem is concerned, would
justify any continuance.
In reply to other questions, Dr. Cameron is also re-
ported to have said, inter alia —
. . . . There is no justification for continuing the
kind of work that the investigation has undertaken . . . .
A great deal of the work of the investigation was merely
a repetition of what had already been done; and, so far, it
kas not given any indication of resulting in any great altera-
tion in regard to districts, areas, or methods that have been
gradually developed in the past.
I say quite confidently that it (the alleged aroma pro-
blem) will not be solved by the methods that have befen
adopted during the last three years. It will be solved by
a scientific attack by a properly organized scientific investi-
gation.
The kind of work that has been done in Vie-
toria (by the Australian Tobacco Investigation) can be
carried on by the State authorities just as well without the
control of the director of investigations as with it. It has
done so, and has received no inspiration from that control
during the last three years. Rather has it given inspira-
tion and assistance.
F. 218. —21
Dr. Cameron is, of course, entitled to hold and to
express such views regarding the effectiveness of the
executive committee, and the value of the work laid
down and performed with its cognisance and approval
of the director of tobacco investigations, Mr. C. M.
Slagg. As a full account of the history and work of
the executive committee has been given, as well as
details of the work of Mr. Slagg, I do not propose to
dilate upon it. What I wish to point out is that
Dr. C ameron’s reported views are entirely at variance
with his attitude and demeanour as a member of the
executive committee, and as a regular attendant at its
meetings. Since its inception eighteen meetings of the
executive committee have been held. Of these, Dr.
Cameron has attended twelve. Since his first attend-
ance on Bth March, 1928, after his return from Britain
and America, Dr. Cameron has been present at every
meeting* of the executive. On no occasion has he in-
dicated that the general plans of work submitted by
Mr. Slagg meet with his disapproval, and, in fact,
his concurrence, as well as that of the other members
of the executive has always been obtained before put-
ting them into execution. For instance, at its meeting
on 2nd and 6th August, 1928, at which Dr. Cameron
was present, the executive unanimously agreed: —
That the plan of experiments in the various States for
1928-29, as submitted by Mr. Slagg should be approved on
the understanding that the proposals contained therein be
regarded as merely tentative, and subject to subsequent modi-
fication if necessary.
Subsequently, at a meeting of the executive on 16th
October, Mr, Slagg detailed the status of the experi-
mental work in the States, and recommended, inter alia,
certain extensions of the work in Victoria. These ex-
tensions were approved, Dr. Cameron concurring. At
a meeting of the executive committee on 10th Septem-
ber, 1929, and when discussing the outline of experi-
mental work for 1929-30, submitted by Mr. Slagg, Dr.
Cameron stated —
That Mr. Slagg had submitted a letter to him containing
plans which were to be a basis for the coming year’s work.
The tentative plans as included in the agenda of the present
meeting were the outcome of a subsequent discussion. It was
planned to divide the work between the department and the
investigation, and Mr. Slagg had undertaken to supply him
with a memorandum covering the programme of work and
this would act as a basis for reference throughout the year.
In short, on all matters instituted during his active
association with the executive, except perhaps on some
minor details, the work of the executive, and that of
Mr. Slagg, has met with his full concurrence as ex-
pressed by his assent at the meetings. I understand
also that the work of the Australian Tobacco Investi-
gation has, in general, met with the approval of the
heads of the Departments of Agriculture in ISTew South
Wales, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Aus-
tralia. In this connexion I quote the following ex-
tract from the minutes of the fourth meeting (11th
December, 1928) of the Standing Committee on Agri-
culture of the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research, which comprises the heads of the State
Departments of Agriculture, and at which were
present: —
Heads of State Departments of Agriculture.
Dr. S. S. Cameron (Victoria), chairman,
Mr. G. I). Ross (N.S.W.),
Mr. F. E. Ward (Tasmania), and
Professor A. J. Perkins (South Australia).
Representatives of the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research.

Professor A. E. V. Richardson,
Dr. A. C. D. Rivett,
Dr. B. T. Dickson, and
Professor Watt.


Extract from the Minutes.
23. Tobacco Investigations. —During tire consideration of
this item Mr. Gepp (chairman, Development and Migration
Commission), and Mr. Slagg (director of the Australian
Tobacco Investigation) were present by invitation.
Mr. Slagg read a report which he had prepared and which
he had divided into three main sections;—
( a ) The present position of the experimental work
- of the Australian Tobacco Investigation;
( h ) The co ordination of tobacco research carried on by
the State Departments and by the Australian
Tobacco Investigation, and
(c) The discussion of co-operative arrangements made
to date.
As regards the co-ordination of tobacco research carried on
by the State departments and by the tobacco investigation,
the various suggestions put forward in the memorandum were
approved in general. These were briefly that for the present
efforts would be mainly concentrated on production problems;
that the tobacco activities of the States and the investiga-
tion would be carried out in collaboration; that the director
of the tobacco investigation would act, when invited, in an
advisory capacity with respect to experimental work with
tobacco carried out under State auspices; that, so far as
possible, the organizations of the State Departments of Agri-
culture would be made use of in carrying out experimental
work by the investigation in the respective States; that the
investigation would consult the State departments in regard
to any appointments it might like to make from State
departmental staffs; and that the investigation would co-
operate with the Division of Economic Botany and Economic
; Mtomology of the Council. The suggestions with regard to
publication and publicity were also approved.
With regard to present experimental work it was reported
that it was now intended to place the details of such work
; n the hands of a committee consisting of the director of the
cbacco investigation as chairman, Dr. B. T. Dickson as a
i tcond member, and a third member, probably a physiological
i a organic chemist, to be elected later if considered advisable.
~t was also reported that the tobacco investigation would be
; irovided with adequate office and laboratory space in the new
, <£ search buildings of the Division of Economic Botany of the
J nmcil shortly to be erected at Canberra, and that it had
men decided to appoint an assistant to Mr. Slagg.
I may add that at a meeting of the executive com-
mittee, held prior to the appointment of your com-
mittee, at which there were present Dr. Rivett, Dr.
Darnell-Smith and Dr. Cameron —I was absent on
work in connexion with the Coal Commission—there
was a discussion relative to the presentation of the
statement submitted subsequently by Dr. Rivett. At
that meeting Dr. Cameron placed on record certain
comments with regard to portions of the report. That,
I understand, w T as made clear. Apart from that, the
only time that I had any indication, even semi-officially,
of Dr. Cameron’s views, concerning the work that was
being done was at a meeting held in camera, with all
members of the staff absent on the Bth April. I feel
personally, that the matter need not be taken any fur-
ther, but I considered it necessary, from the point of
view of the executive, to place on record the fact that
we had endeavoured to work harmoniously, and I feel
sure that had there been any dissentient voice concern-
ing the lines followed in the investigation and the work
itself, I should have given it serious attention at the
time. The third point to which I desire to refer is
the sending of tobacco samples to the Imperial Institute
for confidential report to the executive committee. I
would gather from the evidence submitted to the select
committee that the action of Mr. C. J. Tregenna in
not consulting the growers, from ivhose product the
samples were taken is regarded harshly. If that is so,
I desire to state that Mr. Tregenna’s action in this
matter was strictly in accord with his instructions. So
much has been said for and against Australian leaf
that the executive decided to seek an independent
opinion on tobacco representative of the various grades.
Mr. Tregenna, then seconded to the Investigation, was
instructed to collect three representative samples of
each of the various grades, and to regard the matter as
confidential.
5876. Are you sure that that correctly expresses the
situation ? I understood that the criticism was directed
to the action of Mr. Tregenna in taking samples from
the growers without advising them of his purpose, and
that they were unaware of the nature of the report
received from England. As a matter of fact, it was a
bombshell to them, because they were in entire ignor-
ance of what had been done. Do you consider that
the methods employed were calculated to inspire the
confidence of the growers?—My recollection on the
point is not very clear without looking at the corre-
spondence. But I know there was a full discussion
with representatives of the Victorian growers in my
office in Collins-street, Melbourne; and I intimated
that if they desired they could see the further samples.
I felt that, until there had been further tests made,
it was not desirable to broadcast the results of the rest.
5877. Do you not consider that the growers should
have been furnished with a statement by the investi-
gation, or by Mr. Tregenna ?—Mr, Tregenna could not
be blamed because he was no longer associated with the
investigation.
5878. I put it to you that the method of selection
was entirely wrong. In the Tam worth district the
samples were taken from probably the worst grower,
who admitted that he had never grown any bright leaf.
The growers object to the method, because the samples
taken would be regarded as typical of the tobacco grown
in the Tam worth district. They contend that the
action taken was unfair to the growers of high-class
tobacco. That there is something in the point is
apparent from the fact that Mr. Tregenna, in his evi-
dence before the committee, stated that the tobacco
grown in the Tamworth district was wholly unsuitable
for manufacturing purposes. Have you any comment
to make with regard to that point ?—I am not a tobacco
technician, and, therefore, I cannot say whether Mr.
Tregenna’s choice was sound or otherwise. Ido
know, however, that duplicate and triplicate samples
were retained by us in Melbourne, and these will be
readily made available for examination by the select
committee or by any person or persons it may care
to nominate.'
5879. Is it not a fact that the samples taken would
give London experts a very poor opinion of the quality
of tobacco grown in the Tamworth district and in Aus-
tralia generally ? Is it not true also that any persons
or firms whose interests would be served by slandering
the tobacco-growing industry in Australia would have a
powerful argument in support of their contention if
the result of the tests were broadcast?— Yes. It is,
however, as well to remember that the experts who
reported on the samples, believed they were all Aus-
tralian tobacco. We mixed the Australian samples
with samples obtained from America, and the experts
reported that they did not know which were Australian
and which American. They declared all the samples
to be_ comparatively poor, but they picked out the
American samples as the best of the lot,
5880. You agree, I suppose, that it is difficult, in
some circumstances, for experts to express a definite
opinion. For example, when we visited Dudgeon and
Arnell’s factory in Melbourne, Mr. Tully, who has had
some experience in tobacco, declared that he could pick
out the American leaf by its aroma. I tested him and
he failed. I then applied the same test to one of the
girl stemmers, who selected an Australian leaf and,
judging by its aroma, declared it to be American.
Have you had a similar experience?—l agree that
sometimes there is difficulty. In regard to your point
that we should have communicated with the growers
and informed them the tests about to be made, I
should like to say that in every case the executive gave
most careful consideration to all its actions, having in
view the interests of the Australian industry. We
did not make known the results of the tests because they


were of a preliminary nature. They were not
sufficiently scientific for the formation of final judg-
ment. We considered it undesirable to start any form
of publicity concerning the quality of the Australian
leaf because of the probable risk to the Australian in-
dustry. Personally, lam satisfied that what we did
was quite sound. If we had made known the con-
tents of the report we should have had all sorts of
special interests making comments for their own pur-
poses. The committee was in a position of great re-
sponsibility, and my experience is that when there is
any doubt about the wisdom of a certain course of
action, it is a good rule not to adopt it.
5881. We have been furnished with a report from
Mr. S. Eowler, the secretary to the Australian Tobacco
Investigation, of a meeting held on the 12th July, 1927,
at the office of the Under Secretary for Agriculture,
Hew South Wales. The report states that besides your-
self there were present Mr. D. G. Ross, Under-
secretary, Department of Agriculture, Sydney; Dr.
Darnell-Smith, Government Biologist and Director of
Botanical Gardens, Hew South Wales, and Mr. C. J.
Tregenna, the Hew South Wales tobacco expert. The
meeting was held prior to the survey of certain por-
tions of Queensland from the point of view of tobacco
cultivation. Mr. Tregenna made it clear to those
present that he had certain information which led him
to believe that the Mareeba district in Horth Queens-
land was eminently suitable. He declared that he
was satisfied that the right tobacco could be grown
there. Have you any objection to the committee re-
garding the report of the meeting as a submission by
the investigation?—l do not think so. The notes of
that meeting were taken for the information of my col-
leagues and Mr. Ross, but they have not been con-
firmed by those present. At the time there was noth-
ing, so far as I know, that called for the confirmation
of the record. Mr. Ross has not confirmed the minutes.
I doubt that he has read them. My purpose, in
having a report of the meeting was to arrive at a
general agreement on certain proposals made. If the
committee desires to use the minutes in any way,
obviously the persons present should be asked to con-
firm them as a true record of the proceedings.
5882. Would the report be regarded as the property
of the Australian Tobacco Investigation?—l suppose
it would. It was not strictly a confidential meeting;
it was an ordinary departmental meeting.
5883. That being so, is there any objection to our
using the notes as a submission by the investigation?—
The notes are a record of an official meeting between
the Under Secretary of the Department of Agricul-
ture, Hew South Wales, and myself as chairman of the
tobacco investigation for the purpose of furthering the
business of the investigation. The only point that
occurs 1 to me is that those present have not been asked
to say whether it is a true record of the proceedings.
It is probable that Mr. Ross has not read the report,
and perhaps Mr. Tregenna has not seen it.
5884. At that meeting Mr. Tregenna, referring to
the possibilities of tobacco growing in Horth Queens-
land, is reported to have said —
Although I have never seen it, I am quite sure that the
soil does exist there, that poor soil which would be close
to the edge of the summer rainfall, not the heavy rainfalls
of 70 or 80 inches, but just on the fringe of the tablelands.
If ever we get tobacco it will come from there.
You are then reported as correcting him by saying—
You should say “ When we get tobacco ”; not “if we ever
get it ”, because I am sure we will get it, and within a few
vears.
To which Mr. Tregenna replied—
I think it w ill be done there.
Apparently there is a great conflict of evidence on this
point, especially among experts. Evidently they have
not taken the trouble to keep track of statements made
by them, and they have forgotten a lot of things. This
is evident from the following extract from a letter
which the secretary to the committee received from Mr.
Tregenna under date Sydney, 14th May;—
I have to thank you for your letter of Ist lust
It will, perhaps, be helpful to your committee if the follow-
ing comments be noted:-
3315. By the Chairman. —It is desired to point out that
I have on no occasion stated that North Queensland is the
only place where suitable tobacco leaf is likely to be grown
in Australia.
Apparently Mr. Tregenna has forgotten what he said
at the meeting in the office of the Secretary for Agri-
culture on the 12th July, 1927. Have you any com-
ment to make upon that statement? —That is one of
our difficulties. If you desire it I shall communicate
with Mr, Ross and Mr. Tregenna asking for their
comments on the meeting, and whether they regard
them as a true record.
5885. You have stated it is impossible for the execu-
tive committee to say whether or not there is a
eucalyptus taint in Australian tobacco. Do you wish
us to understand that the committee takes the view
that the truth or otherwise of the allegation is not proved
up to the present, and that it may be inferred that
future experiments will determine this point ?—I can
only say that the executive strongly deprecates un-
authorized and immature statements which may
detrimentally affect the industry. We have from time
to time urged that, pending investigations, further
areas should not be planted; but the executive definitely
dissociates itself from the inference which may be
drawn from recent press statements that there is proof
that present areas under cultivation for tobacco are
unsuitable. These statements may injure growers
without reason, and prove embarrassing to those in
charge of the scientific work. The work projected by
the executive on the investigation side in conjunction
with the State authorities is to be carried out, not only in
new areas, but also in existing areas in the various
States with a view to making further improvements in
production.
5886. In view of the serious nature of the allega-
tions, do you not consider it would have been wise if
the investigation had expressed the opinion that it did
not endorse the belief that there was eucalyptus taint ?
—-You must remember that we have a great deal more
experience to-day as a result of our investigational
work. In 1928 we went as far as we could. Had it
occurred to us, we might have said, “ We do not believe
it ”. I did not think it was necessary to do that. But
we did definitely dissociate the executive from the
statement, and we declared that there was no proof that
existing areas were not satisfactory. One can always
do a job better the second time with the added know-
ledge gained from experience,
5887. Did you at any time form the opinion, from
the nature of the press reports and discussions that took
place, that there was a move by outside interests to
concentrate upon tobacco cultivation in Horth Queens-
land, and that certain persons were interested in direct-
ing public attention to the Mareeba district ?—Ho; but
I gather, from the minutes to which you have referred,
that there was a general atmosphere favorable to the
Mareeba district. Mr. McGee, the tobacco field experi-
mentalist, who had been brought out to Australia, had
great hopes at first that he would be able to overcome
our difficulties by careful fertilizing, but he -was dis-
appointed. In fact, he told me he thought of giving
up his position and returning to England, He added
that by going north he thought he could approach more
nearly the conditions of light soil and summer rainfall
that would be suitable for tobacco-growing. Both he and


Mr. Tregenna said they felt that the future of the in-
dustry as regards the cultivation of light leaf would
probably be in the north. I have a recollection now
that Mr, Tregenna said “ That is the area/’ and added
that if he failed there he was going to give up the job
of trying to grow tobacco. I think I can say that Mr.
Tregenna was genuinely persuaded that the future of
the industry was in the semi-tropical regions of the
Commonwealth.
5888. Do you think the idea was put into his head
by Mr. McGee?—l cannot say. They both mentioned
the matter to me.
5889. Are you aware that Mr. Tregenna stated he
had known the area in Queensland for years, although
he had never been there? —I think that remark was
made at a general talk around the table in Mr. Boss’s
office. lam quite sure Mr. Tregenna would not regard
it as a considered statement.
5890. Are you aware that arrangements are being
made for the flotation of a big plantation company at
Mareeba alongside the site of the Federal investigation,
and that Mr. Tregenna is the managing director?
Would not that indicate that Mr. Tregenna had this
proposal in view for some years, and, naturally, would
be interested in diverting so much attention to North
Queensland? —I should not like to make that inference.
I believe that in all the discussions that took place, Mr.
Tregenna was genuinely persuaded that the future of
commercial tobacco production was in the north.
5891. Would it be right to assume that Mr. Tre-
genna would use all his persuasive powers to induce
the Investigation to explore the area referred to and
prove it before he took any financial risk himself? —
I would not care to draw that inference from Mr.
Tregenna’s attitude.
5892. Is it not significant that although the experi-
mental work at Mareeba has not been completed, the
Commonwealth Tobacco Company and the Plantation
Company, which are part and parcel of one another,
have acquired 2,000 acres of land at Mareeba at a low
figure, and that Mr. Tregenna is named as the manag-
ing director of the plantation company? Do you not
think, in the light of these developments, that Mr.
Tregenna contemplated utilizing the Investigation for
the purpose of proving the area from a commercial
point of view?—l have not sufficient knowledge or in-
formation to make any comment on that matter. I
genuinely believe that Mr. Tregenna was convinced
that North Queensland was a good place to grow light
leaf tobacco.
5893. Is it not a fact that he was chiefly responsible
for initiating the investigations at Mareeba?—He was
not responsible. He and Mr. McGee were authorized
to make a survey of Queensland at the joint expense of
the Investigation and the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company. The company, I believe, paid Mr. McGee’s
salary, and we paid his travelling expenses. Following
upon the report which Mr. Tregenna and Mr. McGee
made, we sent three of our own representatives—Dr.
Darnell-Smith, Mr. Slagg, and Mr. Howell—to inves-
tigate the area, and it was upon their recommendation
that we selected Mareeba. Mr. Tregenna and Mr.
McGee reported that Mareeba was worth investigating,
but we took no further steps until we had before us
the recommendation of our own officers.
5894. From the report of Mr. Pollock, the Instruc-
tor in Agriculture in North Queensland, it would
appear that he knew of this area, and had asked Mr.
Tregenna and Mr. McGee to visit it. Apparently they
conducted a very cursory survey of the remainder of
the State because they were not there long enough. It
was apparent that they went to Mareeba, and decided
that that was the place for tobacco-growing. They
also went to Central Queensland, but Mr. Brooks,
the Instructor in Agriculture for Central Queensland,
informed us that they were with him for one day only,
so, obviously, the examination of that portion of the
State was not intended to be a very comprehensive one.
Mr. Pollock then went back to Townsville and published
a statement in the local newspaper that the experts
had discovered that the fundamental fault in Aus-
tralian tobacco-growing was the unsuitability of exist-
ing areas. All the publicity originated from that
statement. Mr. Pollock admitted that he had no
authority to make it, because at that stage the informa-
tion was confidential. He knew nothing except what
Mr, Tregenna and Mr. McGee had told him, and they
were not then in a position to say, because they were
not within twelve months of being in possession of the
completed data. But Mr. Pollock, being interested in
North Queensland, took advantage of the opportunity
to spread the good news that the experimental work
at Mareeba had been successful. Then we have two
gentlemen from New Zealand, people whom we cannot
trace, applying on behalf of the Queensland Plantation
Company for 2,000 acres of land alongside the experi-
mental station. The land was put up for sale by auc-
tion, and as they were the only bidders, they got it at
the upset price of 10s. an acre. Mr. W. A. Holling-
worth, clerk in charge of the Land Settlement Inquiry
Section, Lands Department, Queensland, in his evidence
at Brisbane stated that a Mr. M. H. Hampson, whose
address was New Zealand Insurance Buildings, Auck-
land, inspected the land, which he understood belonged
to Mr. Jones, and that the Government had offered a
further area of 1,500 acres of available Crown land,
adjacent to the area registered in the name of Mr.
Jones. The prospectus of the Commonwealth Tobacco
Company, for which concern the Queensland Planters
Limited will carry on the operations of working, plant-
ing and marketing, states that the Mareeba district
has been tested at the expense of the Tobacco Investi-
gation. Are you aware that all this publicity has
discounted the value of tobacco-growing areas else-
where in the Commonwealth?— Judging by other pros-
pectus that have been issued, notably in connexion with
the venture at Pomonal, it has not seriously affected
them, and the allegations concerning the eucalyptus
taint have not injured the prospects of the Pomonal
area.
5895. The Pomonal company has been launched
since the visit of the committee to that district. The
prospectus of the Commonwealth Tobacco Company
describes Mareeba as destined to be the “Virginia of
Australia ”, and, apparently, if these gentlemen who
are behind the Mareeba concern have their way, all the
other areas will be closed down. Have you any com-
ment offer upon that aspect of the matter?— All I
can say is that the Investigation has nothing whatever to
do with the developmental side of the industry in so far
as company formation is concerned, and, as far as my
knowledge goes, no member of our staff is interested
financially in any companies.
5896-7. Is it not a fact that Mr. Tregenna made it
clear that he was not remaining in New South Wales;
are aware also that the following statement
appears in the prospectus of the Queensland Planters
Limited:— r
Before undertaking this work the board of directors of
Queensland Planters Limited completed arrangements
whereby, before the planting season commences, Mr. C. J.
Tregenna will join the board as managing director, with
acth e control and direction of the whole business of working
the land, planting and marketing the crop. Nobody in Aus-
tralia holds the same place amongst tobacco-growers right
throughout the Commonwealth as Mr. Tregenna. His written
work is recognized as authoritative; his practical knowledge
is unchallenged. For the past sixteen years he has been the
tobacco expert for the New South Wales Government; he has
acted on special Government commissions; and it is not over-
stating the position to say that it would be impossible to


find anywhere a gentleman whose scientific attainments are
combined with so exhaustive a knowledge of the tobacco
industry in Australia. Mr. Tregenna’s faith in Mareeba
tobacco is unbounded. His leadership of the operations will
be of the greatest value to bond holders.
Does it not appear to you that Mr. Tregenna
was the real originator of the investigations at
Mareeba? —To the best of my knowledge and belief no
action has been taken by the Investigation, or its staff,
since the experiments were begun at Mareeba, and the
Investigation is in no way associated with the pros-
pectus of any commercial undertaking.
5898. By Mr. Tully. —Are you aware that the
prospectus also quotes the views of Mr. Howell?—Yes.
I regretted to. see the statement by Mr. Howell. It
should not have been given without authority.
5899. By the Chairman. —Will you make inquiries
and see how many, if any, of your employees are
associated with this concern? —-Yes.
5900. I suppose it is no concern of the Investigation
where the areas are situated? —Every promising area
should be investigated. The Investigation has en-
deavoured to spread the work over the various States,
exclusive of Tasmania.
5901. Have you any further statement to make? —
Ye.s. I should like to say something concerning future
control of the work of the Investigation, assuming that
the money will be available. I have had an interview
with my Minister (Senator Daly), and Sir George
Julius, and I have been asked to advise your com-
mittee that it is proposed to appoint a consultative
committee, consisting of Dr. Rivett, representing the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research; and
Mr. Gunn, representing the Development Department
of the Prime Minister, with myself as chairman. This
consultative committee will control future policy. It
will discuss and recommend the distribution of the work.
The purely scientific side in the laboratory, and the
corresponding small scale work in the field should be
handed over to the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research to be placed under the Division of Economic
Botany, and a certain portion of the money avail-
able—the amount recommended is £12,000 per annum,
representing £6,000 from the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company, and £3,000 from the Common-
wealth, and £3,000 from the five States —should be
allotted to the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research for this purpose. It is proposed that the
large scale field work of all kinds, including fertiliza-
tion of the different kinds of tobacco and conditions of
growth, age of plants, &c., should be conducted under
the supervision of Mr. Gunn’s department of develop-
ment.
5902. Has Mr. Gunn been allotted a definite depart-
ment yet?— No. The alteration cannot be made legally
pending the passage of the bill to amend the Develop-
ment and Migration Act. Assuming the House of
Representatives passes the bill, and it is returned to
the Senate and confirmed, the arrangements indicated in
the agreements which have been tabled in the House
of Representatives will apply, and a new sub-depart-
ment of development, under the Prime Minister’s
Department will be created. Mr. Gunn, as director
of development, will control the staff, which is at pre-
sent attached to the Development and Migration Com-
mission. Then the large scale field work, and such
other work as may be allotted, will be under Mr. Gunn.
The laboratory work and small scale field work, as well
as other works which may be decided upon by the con-
sultative committee, on which there will be represen-
tatives of the beads of these two organizations, will be
done by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Kesearch. Any necessary co-ordination can be secured
preferably without reference to the consultative com-
mittee. Naturally, the heads of the organizations will
confer and. ascertain what each is doing. If this
scheme is adopted there will, of necessity, be regular
meetings of the heads of these two sections, and reports
of their discussions will be forwarded to the secretary
of the consultative committee.
5903. What control will the consultative committee
have over these two branches ?—There will be meetings
at regular intervals for the discussion of such matters
that may come under the general supervision of the
committee with a view to advising the Minister. In
addition to Dr. Rivett and Mr. Gunn, the two officials
definitely responsible for the tobacco investigations
will attend the meetings and supply information. As
chairman of the Consultation Committee, I will have
a general knowledge of the position. I am authorized
to say that Sir George Julius is in agreement with
this proposal. In his absence, Dr. Dickson will
officially inform the committee that the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research approves of it.
5904. The inquiry has convinced most members of
the committee that there should be Commonwealth con-
trol of the Australian tobacco industry, and that the
States should be asked to assist the Commonwealth Go-
vernment if they so desired. It is advisable that there
should be strong control, not merely control by depart-
mental officials whose chief concern it may be to look
after their own jobs. The committee has not yet
formulated any scheme, but we believe that it should
be under a director wholly responsible to the Govern-
ment or to the Minister. As a matter of fact, we were
thinking of recommending that the industry should be
placed under the control of the Minister for Markets.
I would not give my consent to an important industry
like this remaining under the Prime Minister’s Depart-
ment. Up to the present control of it has been wholly
unsatisfactory, because no one has been specially inter-
ested in it. Do you share this view?— Are you not a
little bit unfair to the Prime Minister’s Department?
You must remember that this organization has been
built up with some of the senior officials in the Com-
monwealth service, officers carrying heavy responsibili-
ties. Naturally, the senior officers of the department
would delegate the details of the administration to
specialists. No one would for a moment expect them
to handle the details. Under the scheme which I have
outlined, details will be attended to by a special organi-
zation under the direction of an officer, and the arrange-
ment, I suggest, will work satisfactorily. Since this
is a developmental proposition it is not one that should
be placed under the Minister for Markets. Mr, Mul-
vany, I know, is already burdened "with sufficient
responsibilities.
5905. Do you not agree that since this is one of the
principal revenue sources of the Commonwealth it
should be under strong control?—We realized the
potentialities of the industry three years ago. I can-
not see why it should be taken away from the Prime
Minister’s Department, which is definitely responsible
for all developmental proposals. Sir George Julius
and Dr. Dickson may be able to support me in this
view.
5906. May I take it that you have made arrange-
ments in accordance with your letter of the 14th April
to continue the work of the executive until the report
of this committee is presented to Parliament?— Yes.
The work is proceeding steadily, and we have recom-
mended its continuance.
5907. Has the Investigation been in consultation
with the British-Australasian Tobacco Company with
regard to this matter?— Not officially, but I understand
that Sir George Julius mentioned the matter to the
representatives of the company. Thev asked if they
should write to us concerning the continuation of tin 1
work, but we advised them to wait until they received
a communication from the Prime Minister.


5908. I suppose you are aware that the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company has intimated that, subject
to a renewal of that agreement, its participation in the
present experimental work terminates on the 30th
June ?—Y es, and we have advised the company to wait
for a communication from the Prime Minister’s
Department.
5909. What is the date of the expiry of the arrange-
ment between the Government and the British-Austra-
lasian Tobacco Company ?—The 30th June next. I
understand the company is agreeable to proceed with
the work. The date of the expiration of agreement was
fixed three years ago, and had no relation to the date
fixed for the presentation of your committee’s report.
5910. Would the position of the industry he com-
plicated by the intrusion into the manufacturing side
of the business of a big firm like Phillips in England?
—I should think that the company already operating
in Australia is big enough to forget that, and agree to
carry on under the present arrangement.
5911. May it not he inferred that since the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company is accepting some
financial responsibility for the experiments, it would
expect to ho placed on a more favorable footing, and
that a new company entering the field might consider
its position prejudiced?— There is absolutely no sug-
gestion of any promise of favours in the arrangement
with the British-Australasian Tobacco Company fol-
lowing upon its contribution to the cost of the experi-
mental work now being carried out. I have always
bad complete faith in the offer of the company.
5912. If the Commonwealth Government decided to
take over the whole of the investigation work, would it
be for the good of the industry?—l do not think it
would make any difference, except that the cost to the
Commonwealth would be greater than at present.
5913. There is a feeling outside that the Common-
wealth is taking a big favour from the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company, and that it is not being
given for nothing. Would the industry be benefited
if a new manufacturing concern came in and the Com-
monwealth decided to arrange for a fair field and no
favours?— Personally, I believe that the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company has never asked for any
favours. Its principal concern is to see that more
Australian leaf of the right kind is grown. If any
departure were now made from the arrangement, it
would be regarded as a slap in the eye to people who
are genuinely anxious to help the industry. If any one
else likes to come in and contribute to the cost of ex-
periments the offer should be accepted. We could very
well spend £20,000 a year. In fact, I should like to
have that sum available, because we could carry out
the work much more rapidly.
5914. In what direction?—ln the direction of in-
tensifying the laboratory and field work. If further
funds were available I could ask Dr. Dickson how
many more men he wanted. The Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research could very -well do with more
revenue for its numerous activities. The blue mould
difficulty alone would justify an intensification of staff
appointments and field work. At present we are not
able to give attention to fertilization. Mr. Slagg has
brought under my notice the results of interesting ex-
periments, and dealing with the deficiency of lime and
magnesium in the light soils of America. There is
definite need for research in the control of inorganic
fertilizers which are apparently of importance in rela-
tion to highly intensified plots. Xo part of that work
is being done in Australia.
5915. Do you consider that useful work could be
done in educating the growers in the methods of culti-
vation and curing?— Yes. I should like to see very
thorough research in connexion with the control of
humidity and temperatures. It is from ten to twenty
years ago since I saw the first drying by low-temperature
process including re-circulation of air. Then we might
have an experimental portable curing plant which
could he tried out under various conditions. Perhaps
we could have several of such plants.
5916. Does your scheme of control take cognizance
of features like that?— Yes. There would of necessity
he a report to the consultative committee from Dr.
Dickson concerning one side of the work and from Mr.
Slagg on the other. All the points of which their work
touch must be maintained, because there can be no
hard and fast lines of demarcation between the
scientific and experimental work. There would he all
sorts of overlaps, and, necessarily, there must be control
of both branches. The scheme provides that Dr. Dick-
son will have charge of one branch of the work dealing
with research. When laboratory work is transferred
to the field, Dr. Dickson will follow it up and have
control. Mr. Slagg will he in charge of the field
experimental work. There will come a point at which
this work will overlap and touch, and Mr. Slagg will
have the final say concerning field work.
5917. Suppose Mr. Slagg wants more research work
in the laboratories, what would happen if Dr. Dickson
did not see eye to eye with him?—ln that event it
would be the duty of the consultative committee to
make a decision. It is definitely agreed that Mr,
“ X ” should be in charge of field work and Mr. “ Y ”
in charge of laboratory and any field work necessary
in connexion with the laboratory experiments. One
man will report to Dr. Rivett, and the other to Mr.
Gunn,
5918. In the event of any difference of opinion,
who will be the “ boss ” ?—Mr. Gunn, the head of the
department.
5919. If Mr. Gunn supports Mr. Slagg, and if Dr.
Rivett supports Dr. Dickson, what will happen ?—lt will
be my job to decide. I would report to the Minister.
5920. Do you agree that there is a wide field for
the extension of propaganda among the growers?—l
do. You have touched upon one of the most difficult
phases of life. The immobility of knowledge, and the
lack of reciptivity in regard to knowledge are two of
the biggest problems, particularly in Australia, because
of our isolation in relation to other countries. If you
wish to have effective propaganda you will have to
secure some portion of that £7,000,000 which the Go-
vernment is obtaining from the tobacco industry. It
cannot be done on the £12,000 to be set aside for the
scheme which I have outlined. The dissemination of
knowledge has been one of the greatest difficulties of
the Development and Migration Commission. [Nothing
much can be done unless we can create a favorable
atmosphere between the Eederal and State authorities.
The dissemination of knowledge is essentially a State
function. We may have an eminently suitable pub-
licity agent on the Commonwealth side, and may
experience a State re-action against Eederal propa-
ganda, because it overshadows the domain of the State.
Tinder our Federal system that is the real difficulty.
We are endeavouring to overcome it. Records of use-
ful discussions upon this subject are to be found in
the British Economic Mission’s report dealing with
increased productivity in the areas of better rainfall.
We are hoping, as the result of this thorough survey of
the dairying industry in Australia and the river
Murray valley to increase the effectiveness and the
number of the demonstrators under State control.
Xew South Wales has already worked out a scheme,
and has outlined the number of men that will be re-
quired. The Commonwealth cannot do this work. It
must be done by the States, with, perhaps, the assist-
ance of the Commonwealth. Xu connexion with tobacco


it may be possible, when growing problems are con-
trolled, to suggest to the States that certain experi-
ments be carried out and the information passed on.
5921. What is to prevent the Commonwealth from
distributing its own propaganda in the form of litera-
ture? —That is being done now. Our reports go to
the growers. The Tobacco Growers Association has
been informed that our bulletins are available. They
are being sent out, but we have not yet made a general
distribution of them. I have studied this problem for
three and a half years. We have 5,000 people on our
mailing list. We send the information, but it does
not seem to “ soak ” in, although a certain number of
the brighter men read and digest it. I will look into
this matter, and have prepared a complete list of
tobacco-growers in Australia, so that we may post our
bulletins direct to every one of them.
5922. If you had a permanent bureau for the dis-
tribution of literature would not its work be of immense
value to the growers ?—I agree it is advisable to
amplify our list, and send out information at regular
intervals. There is no reason why our federal publi-
cations should not go direct to all tobacco-growers
in Australia. lam always urging the reiteration of
facts, whether scientific or economic, so that those
people concerned may have impressed upon them the
,r alue of the information given. Anything of value to
our primary producers should be dressed and redressed,
and presented to them in different form at frequent
intervals. They will keep on reading it, and finally
absorb the information. I feel sure that if these
scientific and economic facts were furnished regularly
to the newspapers in readable form they would be pub-
lished, and hare a wide circulation.
5923. You are aware, I presume, that the depart-
ments of agriculture in the various States circulate
information at regular intervals? In Hew South
Wales the department issues a weekly bulletin to the
newspapers of the State on the understanding that
it is published on a certain day?— Yes, and I agree
that the sooner a similar system is adopted in respect
of Commonwealth publications, the better it will be. It
does not matter how often a fact is published, it will
be read if it' is presented in a sufficiently attractive
form. The Canadian Department of Agriculture pub-
lishes what are known as seasonal hints for the
farmers. These consist of short articles written by
specialist writers, and are published under the super-
vision of an editor whose duty is to see that all the
hints given are timely. If we issued regularly seasonal
hints concerning tobacco cultivation, I have no doubt
the result would he satisfactory, hut we should have to
be careful that there was no overlapping with State
publications, and that conflicting views as between Com-
monwealth and State experts in States were not pub-
lished. I agree that well written, snappy paragraphs
dealing with the cultivation of public taste and other
matters in relation to the use of tobacco would he
helpful.
5924. By Mr. Jones. —On whose recommendation
was Mr, Slagg appointed to his present position?—ln
1927, with the full agreement of the Executive Com-
mittee of the Australian Tobacco Investigation, and
through the agency of the official secretary, Australia
House, London, Sir Hugh Denison, Commissioner for
Australia in the United States, and the Senior British
Trade Commissioner at Johannesburg, South Africa,
the following advertisement was inserted in various
public and technical journals—
COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.
Proposed Investigation into Tobacco Production.
Applications are invited for the position of Director of
Tobacco Investigations to be conducted under the aegis of
the Governments' of the Commonwealth and the States of
Australia.
The investigations will cover the whole field of the economic
production of tobacco in Australia. The aim will be to im-
prove the quality and aroma of Australian-grown leaf and it
will be necessary to study the influences of climate, soil, fer-
tilizers, &c., upon the growth of the plant; also to study and
control diseases such as “ Blue Mould,” as well as other
economic factors in the industry.
Applicants should have had a thorough university training
(or its equivalent) in plant physiology and pathology with
special experience in some aspects at least of tobacco-growing
and curing. It is not expected that any applicant will possess
expert knowledge of every phase of the industry, hence the
selection of a supporting staff will be deferred until the
director has been appointed.
The salary offered is from £1,500 to £2,000 per annum (with
travelling expenses) according to qualifications.
The period of appointment will be three years and the term
may be extended.
With regard to the South African applicants, it was
arranged that the Senior British Trade Commissioner
at Johannesburg should forward one copy of all appli-
cations to the Executive Committee, one copy to Mr.
F. L. McDougall, at Australia House, London, and sub-
mit, if possible, a confidential report upon the general
suitability and character of the applicants to the Execu-
tive Committee. With regard to the United States and
Canada, Sir Hugh Denison, then Commissioner for
Australia in the United States of America, was re-
quested to insert advertisements and to forward one
copy of applications to the Executive Committee, one
copy to Mr. F. L. McDougall, at Australia House, Lon-
don, and to retain one copy. Sir Hugh was also asked
to ascertain from personal inquiries and from the
United States officials the general suitability of the ap-
plicants and to attach a note of the results to the copies
sent to Mr. McDougall and to the Executive Committee.
He was also informed that arrangements were being
made for Dr. S. S. Cameron and Dr. G. P. Darnell-
Smith to inspect the applications in America and to
interview likely applicants. With regard to the United
Kingdom, Mr. T. Trumble, Official Secretary, was
asked to insert advertisements in the United Kingdom,
and, if necessary, on the Continent, and it was suggested
that Mr. F, L. McDougall should do the detail work.
Mr. Trumble was also informed that arrangements
were being made for Mr. (now Sir) George Julius, Dr.
S. S. Cameron and Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith to see the
applications and possibly interview the best of the
British applicants during their visit to London to attend
the Imperial Agricultural Conference in October, 1927.
He was also informed that the latter two gentlemen
would inquire into the American applicants on their
return to Australia, via America. It should be noted
here that subsequently Dr. Darnell-Smith found it im-
possible to visit the United Kingdom. Mr. Trumble
was also advised that copies of all applications received
in the various countries would be forwarded to him and
he was requested, with the aid of Mr. McDougall, to
find out everything possible regarding the suitability of
the applicants. Subsequently, Sir Hugh Denison for-
warded copies of applications and indicated three that
he and Dr. Darnell-Smith agreed were the only ones
worthy of consideration, and that they considered that
of Mr. Slagg was unquestionably the most suitable. Sir
Hugh added that their opinion regarding Mr. Slagg
was confirmed in a letter received from Mr. W. A.
Taylor, Chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, United States of America. Sir
Hugh also intimated that one of the letters supporting
Mr. Slagg’s -application was from Dr. B. T. Dickson,
now of the Council for Scientific and Industrial [Re-
search. Sir George Julius and Drs. Richardson (of
South Australia) and Cameron, when in London,
closely examined all applications from Britain, South
Africa, and America, and all agreed that Mr. C. M.
Slagg was the most suitable as regards qualifications,
age, experience and personality. Subsequently, Dr.
Cameron visited America, and with Sir Hugh Denison,
interviewed four most likely American applicants.


They were of opinion that Mr. C. M. Slagg was the
most suitable and, in a cablegram to the Chairman
(Mr. H. W. Gepp), jointly recommended his appoint-
ment for three years at a salary commencing at £1,500
per annum, with increments to be determined. In this
connexion, the following extract from a cablegram re-
ceived by Sir George Julius on the 23rd November,
1927, from Dr. Cameron in New York, is of interest: —
Sbioo while not brilliant is sound scientifically, knowledge
able and experienced, good personality and administrative
ability. Washington Bureau heads endorse this estimate.
Denison and T consider Slagg suitable and he is cabling
recommendation Gepp accordingly.
Dr. Darnell-Smith, wdien in America, read applica-
tions, and that of Mr. Slagg was the only which ap-
pealed to him as being worthy of consideration. Sub-
sequently, on his return to Australia he intimated to
the Executive Committee that the application of Mr.
Slagg was the most suitable of those seen in New York,
but he urged that applications from all other countries
should be seen before final decision was made. At
the meeting of the Executive Committee on the 16th
December, 1927, close consideration was given to all
applications by Mr. 11. W. Gepp, Dr. A. C. D. Eivett,
and Dr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, and it was unanimously
resolved that the following cablegram be despatched to
Sir Hugh Denison authorizing him, on behalf of the
Executive Committee, to offer the position to Mr. C.
M. Slagg:—
Referring to your cable twenty-first November we authorize
you to offer Slagg position for three years subject to usual
good behaviour clause at fifteen hundred pounds per annum
to commence first January. Incapacity owing to sickness for
more than three months within any twelve consecutive months
will give executive right to cancel appointment. Three weeks
annual leave will be granted on full pay. First class boat and
train passage will be provided for himself wife and child
to Australia and for return to Canada should engagement ter-
minate before or at end of three years. Payment of full
salary whilst travelling to Australia regarded as compensation
and no travelling expenses allowed other than fares for trains
and steamers and hire of motor cars. Will make reasonable
allowance to be determined by you for travelling expenses for
attending conferences and making investigations prior to
departure for Australia. Travelling allowance of thirty shil-
lings per day will be paid in Australia while absent from head-
quarters plus actual cost of transport. Survey party’s and
Darnell-Smith’s reports will be available on his arrival and
will give him good start. If Slagg accepts hope he will be able
leave by Tahiti.
On the 19th December, 1927, the Minister (Senator
the Hon. Sir George Pearce) approved of the cablegram
and it was despatched accordingly.
5925. Do you not think that, in fairness to the
tobacco-growlers of Victoria and New r South Wales,
some reply should have been furnished to the supple-
mentary statement by Mr. Tregenna that he would rule
out all tobacco areas in Victoria and New South Wales.
—I have already said that I consider there was no
justification for that statement.
5926. In view of the importance attached to the con-
clusions of the Imperial Institute concerning the defects
in Australian leaf tested, do you not think that some
official statement should be made as to wffiether the
conclusions were correct or otherwise?—l cannot say
anything at the moment. Ido not know' anything about
that phase of the matter, because I am not a tobacco
expert. The conclusions indicate the necessity for a
more thorough investigation of all the factors control-
ling cultivation, apart from the curing process.
5927. Would you say that the conclusions of the Im-
perial Institute indicate that the alleged defects in
Australian tobacco are the results of faulty curing?—
I have not sufficient knowledge to express an opinion.
5928. In your statement of 18th July, 1928, you said
that the executive had from time to time urged that
further areas should not be planted pending investiga-
tion. Do you still hold that opinion?— When last I
was before the committee I answered that question. I
would not urge that course now',
5929. Then would you suggest that further areas be
now planted?-—I see no reason why further areas should
not be planted provided the growers keep in touch with
the experts as to methods of cultivation and also with
the representatives of the tobacco companies so that
they may know the class of product that will be pur-
chased. Our further knowledge concerning problems
of production and our ability to grow bright leaf under
control, added to the fact that the tobacco companies
are purchasing steadily at prices which are undoubtedly
attractive, should be an inducement to growers.
5930. Mr. Slagg stated that in time the growers of
Australia should be able to supply up to 60 per cent, of
the requirements of the people. Do you support that
view?—l would go further and say that the amount
which our growers can produce will depend upon the
extent to which the people of Australia can afford
imported luxuries.
5931. Do you consider that the growers will be able
to supply 90 per cent, of the tobacco consumed in
Australia ?—I hope so, eventually.
5932. By the Chairman. —Within what period of
time ?—I indicated previously ten years as the minimum
period to enable us to get reasonable control of Aus-
tralian conditions. I have not altered my view. We
have increased our general knowledge of tobacco-grow-
ing already. I told Mr. Bruce, the former Prime Min-
ister, that our difficulties were capable of solution, but
that we must not expect results over-night. We now
have greater knowledge and more confidence. If any
man now wishes to engage in the business of growing
tobacco leaf, I advise him to go to the State and Federal
experts for information as to method, and also to the
buyers to see what they are doing. The curve of the
rapidity and the quality of the attack upon any prob-
lem must rise when the fundamental facts are estab-
lished. For three years our executive officers have been
building up all the fundamental work. We can now'
visualize a great deal more work with an increase in
staff and a continuity in expenditure. Adequate funds
are essential, because we cannot get competent men to
take positions of responsibility if they are in doubt as
to what may happen next year. I have always felt
that the price of the dark leaf w'as too high or the
price of the bright leaf too low. I feel sure that W'e
shall gradually develop an Australian demand for
tobacco with an Australian flavour.
5933. By Mr. Jones. —Will steps be taken to refute
the statement by Mr. Tregenna that he would rule out
all areas in Victoria and New South Wales?—l think
perhaps that is now your job. I have given ray opinion.
5934. By the Chairman. —Have you given fur-
ther consideration to the representation of the
growers on the executive committee?—l said last year
that a representative of the growers would be welcomed,
but the difficulty w'ould be to insure his attendance at
meetings of the consultative committee.
5935. Does your scheme for the future control of
the industry include representations of the States on
the federal directorate?— No.
5936. Have you submitted the proposal to the State
Departments of Agriculture?—No; we have not yet
considered the scheme in detail. I have only discussed
it wdth the Minister and Sir George Julius. I feel
sure that with the Standing Committee on Agriculture,
which meets twice a year at the central office of the
Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch, you can
get all the necessary touch you want on that side. I
all the directors personally and I have always
impressed upon them that if they want any proposal
pushed along to let me know promptly so that we can
deal with it. Personally, I think it would be better
that the field work should be done, as heretofore in co-
operation with the State field experts,


5937. Is it not likely that one of the problems will
be to secure additional experts?— Yes. I feel sure there
is a big future for the industry, if only we can produce
the right class of stuff. This being so, there is ample
justification for expenditure in developing the industry.
The three years’ work that has been done has prepared
the ground for extensive operations. It is now a matter
of making the necessary funds available. We are
hoping to get a couple of tons of tobacco from Mareeba
this year.
The witness withdrew.
Bertram Thomas Dickson, B.A. Ph. D., Chief of the
Division of Plant Industry, Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research, was recalled and further
examined.
5938. By the Chairman. —Do you wish to add to
your statement made before the committee on a former
occasion? —Yes. In order to place the Australian
tobacco industry on a sound basis it is obvious that
more scientific work should be done under controlled
conditions, as I pointed out in my previous evidence.
I am here this morning on behalf of Sir George Julius
and the executive of the Council for Scientific and In-
dustrial Research to state that the executive endorses
Mr. Gepp’s proposals regarding the recommended organ-
ization of the work for future tobacco investigation.
It is essential that work on blue mould shall continue.
We have been able to demonstrate very definitely that
control of this disease is possible; but other diseases
are likely to occur. Therefore, we must always be
aware and prepared to combat them. Investigation
should be continuous in regard not only to tobacco
diseases in Australia, but disease which may reach
Australia from outside. The plant that produces the
foliage must be of first class quality. If it is not it is
impossible to produce a first class tobacco, but it can be
improved by blending. It follows therefore that curing,
processing, and blending should be studied, not merely
from the empirical point of view but also from the
scientific point of view, under control conditions so
that we may get exactly the product we are after. It
is important that we should know what we obtain and
how we obtain it, I am quite certain that, as far as
the council is concerned, we shall be able to carry on
our work as Mr. Gepp has suggested, so that the more
purely scientific work on the one hand, together with
the necessary field work, will be co-ordinated with the
broad scale field work. When problems arising in the
field under the broad scale work call for research, the
necessary scientific investigations will be undertaken by
the council. I can see no difficulties in the "way. Both
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and
the Australian Tobacco Investigation are federal
organizations. This will mean that the federal aspect
of the investigations will be continued. I think I
pointed out previously that a larger staff will be
necessary. If we double our staff, we can quadruple
the work.
5939. How many additional scientists would be
required?—l have not gone into the details of the pro-
posal yet. We shall need specialists for nutrition work.
5940. Can you obtain them in Australia?—l am at
the moment in cable communication with an Australian
who is finishing his scientific training at Berkeley, in
California, and I am hoping he will come back to
Australia and join my staff. He is a graduate of the
University of Western Australia. I have always en-
deavoured to get Australian scientists, but there is a
dearth of them. Australia is not unique in this respect.
There is a scarcity of biologists in all parts of the
British Empire. We shall need more than one officer
for nutrition studies. We sha 1 l also require additional
scientists for the chemical side of the investigation to
give special attention to chemical analyses, and even to
dry distillation methods. I am not in a position to say
yet how many chemists we ought to have, but in all
probability we shall require three or four. I think
we are more likely to get chemists in Australia than
biologists. We shall need trained physiologists to
specialize in the nutrition of plants. The factors men-
tioned by Mr. Gepp this morning call for thorough
investigation, not only in Australia, but all over the
world. We could do with at least two physiologists and
four chemists. They would probably be able to do
other scientific work in addition to their studies in
connexion with tobacco cultivation.
5941. In that case the whole of their salaries would
not be charged against the tobacco industry?— Ho. In
pathology, we have Dr. Angell, and Mr. Hill, a junior,
is available, but we shall need another pathologist for
work in connexion with the tobacco-growing industry.
5942. What will be the additional cost per annum?—
I have not made an estimate, but I will do so and
furnish information to your secretary.
5943. By Mr. Jones. —The other day, Mr. Temple-
Smith, the Victorian tobacco expert, said he had been
informed that not long ago in Victoria a seed bed,
which had been wiped out by blue mould, had simply
been raked over and when re-planted after a lapse of
three weeks, it produced healthy plants. Can you
offer any explanation for that result?—lt is possible
to reconcile the result with the recognized practice,
but before expressing any opinion, I should like "to
have information as to the origin of seed used in the
bed in the first place, and the origin of the seed used
for the re-planting. If the seed used for the first
planting was Australian grown, and had been taken
from diseased plants, that would account for the
diseased condition of the crop. If the seed for the
second sowing had been provided by Mr. Slagg, it
would be clean and give a clean crop. So far, we have
no evidence that the disease is carried over in the soil.
All we know is that it is with the seed or on the seed.
I must state that in offering any opinion on the case
cited by you, I am presuming some facts of which
lam not certain. There is another possible explanation.
It is possible that, when the first seedlings appeared,
there was in the immediate vicinity some over-winter-
ing plants, which, at that time, owing to the right
environmental conditions, were shedding a considerable
quantity of spores which the wind blew on to the
seed bed. If so, down would go the plants. It is pos-
sible also that after a lapse of three weeks, plus seven
or ten days for the germination of the second lot of
seeds planted, the over-wintering plants had ceased to
shed their spores with the result that the second plant-
ing escaped. I am not in a position to do more than
venture an opinion, because I am not informed of the
facts.
5944. By Mr. Martem.—Wovld it be possible to get
different results from seed taken from the same packet ?
—I would not like to say without testing the seed.
5945. By Mr. Jones.--— ls it possible for the germ of
the blue mould to remain dormant in the ground ?
That is one phase of the problem which we are con-
sidering. In the organism which causes blue mould
there are two types of spores —one which is developed
in millions from single plants, and when they appear
on the outside leaves give them the appearance described
as blue mould. Those spores are, generally speak-
ing, thin skinned and quite sensitive to drying out
and other extreme conditions. They are also short-
lived. but extremely active under the right conditions
in spreading the disease. The other type of spore
has entirely different characteristics, and it is eminently
suited to standing adverse conditions of extreme cold,
drying out, and extreme insulation from the sun. It
's mud! larger than the other type of spore, and it lies
an extremely thick wall. It is possible—we do no?
yet know for certain—that this type of spore is
developed je •■'Aition to I he organism which is mspon


sible for the blue mould. If it is, there is the possibility
that those spores may remain in the soil for a long
time dormant until the right conditions develop. It
has been stated that they are to be found in diseased
leaves. We actually have, in diseased leaves, seen
bodies which look like those bodies. We have attempted
to germinate them, but up to the present have been
unsuccessful. Until we can do the trick as Nature
does it, and test them on the tobacco plant, we cannot
safely say that those particular bodies actually belong
to the blue mould organism and will live over the
winter, and, under the right conditions, germinate and
give infection. There are also other organisms float-
ing about in the air, and there is always a possibility
that some of these foreign organisms may reach the
leaf and develop their special bodies which are found
in the same lesion.
5946. Is it advisable, or otherwise, to re-plant in the
immediate future, seed beds w 7 hich have .been wiped
out by blue mould ?—My own opinion is that it wmuld
be unwise to plant in the same ground in the immediate
future, because we cannot guarantee that the disease
is not actually borne by some of these over-wintering
bodies in the soil. The possibility is that it is sound,
but I would not like this view 7 to go out as a press
statement. We have taken some of these seed pans
and grown tobacco seedlings successfully and inoculated
them for blue mould. We have also taken seed pans with
destroyed seedlings, mixed them with the soil and
planted healthy seed from American sources. These
were grown under the same conditions and did not
develop blue mould. We are attempting to show that
the disease is not transmitted through the soil.
5947. Have you tried the same seed under the same
conditions?—No, because w 7 e wished to test out seed
that w 7 as perfectly healthy.
5948. Would not an experiment like that furnish
the answer to Mr. Marten’s question as regards the
seed bed ?—That would depend upon the origin of the
seed. If a seed was from diseased plants, I see no
reason w 7 hy there should not be a second crop showing
blue mould, provided the conditions w r ere similar.
5949. By Mr. Martens. —Under favorable conditions
then, the same seed sowm in a diseased seed bed would
germinate and produce a crop without blue mould?—
Yes, but there are many problems yet to be investigated.
5950. By the Chairman. —How 7 long would it take
to arrive at definite conclusions with regard to these
investigations into blue mould disease?—l should say
within tw r o years. We have been handicapped, not only
by a shortage of staff, but what is very important, by
the lack of glass house accommodation necessary to
carry out experiments under controlled conditions. We
are providing the necessary glass house accommodation
now. This will be available in September or October.
We shall then be able to proceed with our investigations.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
{Taken at Tumut.)
MONDAY, 2nd JUNE, 1930.
Present :
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Jones I Mr. Morgan
Mr. Martens j Mr. Tully.
(Mr. C. E. Lough, representing the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company; Mr. C. M. Slagg,
representing the Australian Tobacco Investigation;
Mr. R. C. Stevenson, representing the Southern
District Tobacco Growers Association of New 7
South Wales; Mr. C. J. Tregenna, Tobacco Expert,
Department of Agriculture, New South Wales;
Mr. Temple Smith, Tobacco Expert, Department
of Agriculture, Victoria.)
Robert Campbell Stevenson, farmer and grazier,
Wyreema, Tumut, and President of the Southern
District Tobacco Growers’ Association, of New
South Wales, was called, sworn and examined.
5951. By the Chairman. —How many members are
there in your association?—Up till last year we had
25 members. That is about the average.
5952. How long have you been growing tobacco?—•
For the past seven years.
5953. Do you wish to make a statement to the
committee?—l have not prepared a statement, but I
wish to submit a report regarding the matters referred
to this committee. They were considered at a duly
constituted meeting of the Southern District Tobacco
Growers Association, held at Tumut on the 29th May,
1930. The majority was in favour of a bounty on
Australian-grown leaf, their view being that growers
would reap a more direct benefit individually if a
bounty were given. The minority was in favour of
an increase of the duty on imported leaf, and a decrease
in the excise duty on locally-grown leaf, and favored,
further, the abolition of the excise duty, the equivalent
of such duty to be collected in duty on imported leaf*
The view' w 7 as that this would stimulate the consump-
tion of locally-growm leaf, especially by encouraging
new 7 manufacturing companies to commence operations
in Australia. The meeting was in favour of the
existing arrangement between the Commonwealth Go-
vernment, certain States, and the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company being continued. The minority
taking exception to the inclusion of the company in
such an arrangement. The meeting was unanimously
in favour of continuing the investigations by the
Federal Government.
5954. How 7 many growers were at this meeting?—l
think nine. Some members of our association are
Chinese, and they do not attend meetings.
5955. How 7 many Chinese grow 7 tobacco in your dis-
trict?—l do not know 7 , but the number has decreased
since last year.
5956. How many w 7 hite growers are there?— About
twenty.
5957. As many Chinese as wdiites ?—On a rough esti-
mate a bom fifteen to twenty; it is hard to say how
many have withdrawn.
t>9sB. Are many Chinese growing on shares?— Some
5959. Have you had any trouble as a grower?—
There has been trouble with blue mould every year. I
have lost up to 50 per cent, of my crop from blue
mould, but it has not wiped out the whole of my
crop. Three years ago this disease wiped out half
m 7 , cr ?P; Tt occurs mostly in wet years. We have
tried different methods of overcoming the pest • treat :
mg the ground with lime, changing the situation, and
securing plants from outside districts, chiefly Wagga
The most successful method has been the securing of
plants from the Wagga district.
—Y e 6 s° the ° ther growers tr J tlle same methods?
5961. Did they get the same results?— Practically.
In certain favoured situations a few 7 growers have been
able to achieve success without experiencing much blue
mould in the seed beds, but that is only on dry well-
drained soil. . '
5962. What is the average loss through blue mould ?
—About 15 per cent, to 20 per cent.
5963. Do you regard that as a serious handicap to
the industry .—Yes because it throws the planting back
a good deal later than it wmuld be If w e had a con-
tinuity of sound plants.


5964. If that loss could be eliminated you would have
no trouble in the district? —Very little. In the last
two or three years Mosaic has been somewhat
prevalent.
5982. Did you find it difficult to acquire a knowledge
of curing and grading?— No. Any man of average
intelligence can do it.
;>983. Have you had any evidence of appreciation of
your methods by the buyers?— Yes. They have taken
the trouble to show me what constitutes the grades they
require, and I have invariably got the prices for those
grades.
5965. Have you been able to combat that?— Not so
far.
5966. Any other pests here? —Bud and leaf grubs.
The insect pests are not serious. One might put the
loss down on that account at about 3 per cent.
5984. How much bright mahogany have you been
getting on the average?— The quantity of bright leaf
varies according to seasonal conditions. In 1927 my
total yield was 5,973 lb., of which 1,877 lb. was bright,
and it realized from 2s. 6d. to 3s. per lb. That is about
the average result year in and year out. The year 1926
was dry, and therefore a better year for growth in our
district. The total yield was 7,417 lb., of which
5,155 lb. was bright. The following year was very wet,
and we had paddock mould. In 1926 the average price
was 2s. l|d., including bonus, and in 1927 it was
2s. per lb. Last year I had 503 lb. of bright and
0,598 lb. ot dark leaf. The following statement sets
out details of my crops:—
5967. What is the total loss through pests of all
kinds?— About 25 per cent.
5968. What areas have yon been planting on the
average? —Five to six acres.
5969. What is the largest area? —Fourteen acres.
5970. Do you find the larger the area you cultivate
the more uncertain the results? —Yes.
5971. What do you regard as a good area for one
farmer to work in this district, assuming he has home
labour to assist him?—A man working 6 acres with the
assistance of his family has about as much as he can
attend to, if the crop is to be properly grown and
harvested. Above that the yield apparently decreases.
You cannot give the necessary attention to the land,
and you cannot obtain sufficient plants for a larger
area. The rushing of the harvest at the end of the
season tends to put into the barns leaf that is not quite
ripe.

for share-farming.

have had at any time? —Probably about 100, including

5975. To what do you attribute the decrease? —
Seasonal conditions and lack of knowledge of growing
generally.
5976. Have the prices anything to do with it?— They
may result from the growers’ lack of knowledge. One
of the greastest contributing factors to the low prices
has been the lack of knowledge of the industry generally
and of the grading requirements of the buying
companies.

5985. Was last'year a bad season?— Yes. It was a
hard curing year. The season was on the cool side, and
the leaf did not ripen fast enough. Seasonal conditions
are a big factor in this district.
5986. What average price did you receive last year ?
—ls. 10|d., including bonuses.
5987. Have the prices you have received in the last
seven years paid you ?—The prices have been satisfac-
tory, but owing to fluctuating seasons the results have
been poor.
5988. What yields per acre have you obtained?—ln
1923, 1,085 lb.; 1924, 678 lb.; 1925, 364 lb.; 1926,
927 lb.; 1927, 427 lb.; 1928, 658 lb.; and 1929, 919 lb.
5989._ Have you gone into the matter of seasonal
fluctuations with the experts?— Yes.
5990. Have they advised that you are growing in an
unsuitable district?— Ho.
5991. Have they said anything about your land?—
The land is O.K.
5992. Dark or light?—lt is mostly a sandy silt
on river flats.
5993. Do you irrigate?— Yes, I use-overhead irriga-
tion.
5994. By Mr. Morgan.—Do you grow lucerne on
the same soil?—Ho; the land would grow lucerne, but
it is subject to floods, especially during the melting of
the snows.
5995. By the Chairman. Has anything been said to
you by the company’s buyers or by the departmental
experis to lead yon to believe that you are wasting your
time by growing tobacco in this district? —Hot to my
knowledge. In the year when I grew 14 acres they
warned me about planting big areas.
5996. Have they warned you about growing dark
tobacco ? —Yes.
5997. Do other growers have as large a percentage
of dark as you?— Some have more.
5998. What kind of warning have you been given?—
They have pointed out that the dark tobacco is not
useful to them.
5999. But they bought it?— Yes, but with a warning
that they were going to buy smaller percentages of it.
6000. What have they been paying for the dark
leaf? —On the average, from Is. to Is. 6d. per lb.
6001. What have they been paying for your best
bright mahogany?—Of recent years about 2s. 2d., plus
6d. bonus. In a favorable season it might be 2s. 3d.,
plus 6d.
6002. Suppose the company carries out its threat
not to purchase dark leaf to any extent?—So far as I
am concerned I have very little tobacco of the class
to which it objects.
6003. If you keep on growing it you must expect the
company to take a drastic stand. Has that phase of
the situation given you any worry?— Hot personally,
but I have been anxious on the subject, because other
growers, who are not so careful as I am, will have to
go out of the industry. The proportion of my tobacco
that is dark is so small that it would make little
difference to my returns.
6004. We understand that the company classes
mahogany as dark tobacco? —If it does that, we are
absolutely wiped out.
6005. In Victoria, it has notified the growers that
in future it requires only 10 per cent, of mahogany
leaf? —If that is the case, the growers in this district
may as well go out of the industry, unless the investi-
gation now being carried out enables us to grow a
brighter tobacco.
6006. By Mr. Jones. —-Have you been free from blue
mould in any season? —Hot in the seed beds. In one
year only have I experienced paddock mould.
6007. In what year was the price you received 2s.
3d., plus 6d. ? —ln 1929. Some considerable time after-
wards we got an additional 6d. If the company classes
Ho. 1 mahogany as dark leaf,' this district has no
chance of continuing as a growing centre. Fifty per
cent, of our whole crop on the average is in the
mahogany class.
6008. What is the highest percentage you have had
that has been paid for as bright?—ln one year only,
I had 5,155 lb. of bright leaf out of a total yield of
7417 lb.
6009. By the Chairman. —Have you anything to add
to your evidence ?—I merely wish to emphasize that it
means wiping out the industry here if Ho. 1 mahogany
is classed as dark leaf.
6010. Could you not improve the colour of your leaf
by putting it into barns in a more ripened condition?
Do you pick it when it is green?-—I think we shall be
able to increase the percentage of bright when the
experimental work carried out by the Investigation
Committee has had time to reach a basis. It depends
on the extent to which the lighter flue-curing varieties
are suitable for planting in this district. Last year
was the first season we worked under the advice of the
Investigation Committee, and it was one of the worst
tobacco-growing years on record. Blue mould was
very bad, and there were very dry conditions. The
greater part of my crop that would have shown the
result of tests for determining the value of the fer-
tilize ;•« used was wiped out by hailstones.
6UII. Is any experimental work being carried out
here? —Yes, by the Tobacco Investigation Department
under Mr. Slagg, who is experimenting in regard to


blue mould and other plant diseases, and the effect, if
any, on the aroma of the tobacco of using different fer-
tilizers. There have also been investigations by the
British-Australasian Tobacco Company, under Mr.
McGee, and I think Mr. Tregenna has carried out
experiments. I consider that the work done by the
Federal Investigation Department is very necessary,
and it is highly desirable that it should be continued.
Without the help of scientific research, we do not know
where we stand, or by what methods we can improve.
6012. The evidence is that in most districts where
they have been growing dark leaf they have been get-
ting a bigger percentage of light as the result of im-
proved methods of curing and the planting of the most
suitable varieties. Could you improve your methods
of curing?—We are trying to follow the advice of the
Investigation Committee in regard to varieties, but the
past season was entirely against us, and we could not
get any beneficial results. But we have learnt that
some fertilization is necessary for quick maturity, and
that the lighter varieties are necessary for a brighter
leaf.
6013. By Mr. Jones. —Was the experimental work
here done by private growers?—ln the case of blue
mould it was done by three private growers, under
the direction of an officer. There were visits from Mr.
Slagg and Dr. Angell in regard to blue mould, and the
fertilization tests were carried out under the direction
of an officer of the Investigation Committee.
6014. Were there any tests of different varieties to
find the most suitable for the district?— Under advice
from the Investigation Committee, a number of growers
tried different varieties this year.
6015. Did the work of the Investigation Committee
include the trying out of different varieties of plants ?
I think they were content this year to try two special
varieties as against the varieties which would be planted
by local growers in the ordinary way.
6016. By Mr. Martens. —Would that method be as
satisfactory as if the department had a special plot
set aside where it could use its own methods?—l think
two or three individual growers could get better results,
because they would have three different soils.
6017. By Mr. Lough. —Assuming you got a really
favorable tobacco season, and had all healthy plants
that were grown on suitable soil, the tobacco making
good quick growth, and thoroughly ripening, do you
think then that by careful harvesting of ripe tobacco
only and curing carefully, you could produce nearly
all bright leaf?—l should think at least 75 per cent,
to 80 per cent, of bright tobacco could be grown. I
am certain that a grower could do that without undue
exertion.
6018. By Mr. Morgan. —How long has tobacco been
grown in this district —For some 60 years I believe.
6019. Has any question of the climate being too cold
ever arisen ?—ln my opinion the coolness of the climate
is responsible for our dark tobacco. A cold growing
season checks the ripening process. We do not ex-
perience snow in the town of Tumut; but, although we
are only 925 feet above sea level, we are immediately
under the mountains, and we get the influence
of the mountain air. In a cool summer the night
temperatures are low, and the ripening is checked to
such an extent that we invariably get a bigger per-
centage of mahogany leaf than in a warm season.
6020. What is the mean frost registration?— About
30 degrees.
6021. Do you get a long succession of frosts?—ln
some years we do. There has been a run of 29 frosts,
and in another season we might not get more than ten
for the whole winter.
6022. By Mr. Jones. —In what year did you have
70 per cent, of bright tobacco?—ln 1926. That was
my best year.
6023. Did other growers have correspondingly favor-
able results? —No. It was mainly due, I think, to the
fact that I got plants of a light type from the Wagga
district. I was one of the few who got those plants.
6024. From whom did you get them?— From Mr.
Robert Howell, who is now in North Queensland. In
my opinion, he is one of the best raisers of tobacco
plants I have ever known.
6025. Did you try the same variety in following
years?— Yes. I have had fairly successful results, but
we have not had the same warm seasons.
6026. By Mr. Tregenna. —From your observations
with regard to the work of the Tobacco Investigation,
and with regard to the seed beds in this district, would
you say that we are now any nearer a solution of the
problem of blue mould?—l cannot say.
6027. Did all the beds have blue mould, or were the
plants used ? The statement has been made that this
problem has been solved?—So far as I understand, the
beds were planted with the distinct object of seeing
whether the plants got the mould under the conditions
under which they were planted, and they all got it.
The witness withdrew.
George Mervin Levett, tobacco grower, Bombowlee,
Tumut, and secretary of the Southern District
Tobacco Growers’ Association of New South
Wales, was called, sworn and examined.
6028. By the Chairman. —How long have you been
growing tobacco?— Fourteen years.
6029. Have you a statement to present to the com-
mittee?— Yes, it is as follows:'—
After growing tobacco in the Tumut district for fourteen
years, I consider a rich sandy loam, devoid to some extent of
nitrogen, suitable soil for growing a good quality leaf. This
land, of which there is a considerable area in the Tumut
Valley, would, in a normal year, yield from 6 to 10 cwt. per
acre. The grade of such tobacco, under careful handling,
should be in the vicinity of two-thirds bright, the remainder
being mahogany..
The prices during recent years have not altered, and with
the inclusion of the extra bonus given by the company (which
really makes the actual value), I think are satisfactory. But
the standard of grades seems to be getting higher each year;
that is, leaf graded for a particular grade one year would
fail to reach the same standard the next year. I must admit
that the last three years have been unfavorable for growing
tobacco, and this has had a detrimental effect on the quality
of the leaf, but the grower suffers by having more of the
lower grades, besides a smaller quantity.
Blue mould which is favoured by climatic conditions is our
greatest enemy, but as this disease has been prevalent in this
district for over 30 years, during winch time very favorable
crops of tobacco have been grown, I feel very hopeful that good
seasons will come again, or that the scientific research now r
in operation will discover some practical method of controlling
the disease.
The tobacco-growing industry, no doubt, is slipping back in
the Tumut district, mainly through the adverse seasons, and
also, possibly, through the talk that our Australian leaf is
no good, and the public will not smoke it. It may interest
the committee to hear that quite recently I could not buy
“ Waratah ” tobacco, which is all-Australian, at a tobacconist’s
stand in Paddy’s Market, Sydney. I was told, in all sincerity,
that it was selling like hot cakes, but they could not get
supplies. Our local retailers have also had difficulties in
obtaining supplies. As the brand of tobacco smoked is an
acquired taste, the advancement of an all-Australian tobacco
seems hopeless, if the public cannot get it to taste. There-
fore. I am in favour of an alteration in the duties on tobacco,
as a permanent benefit to the industry. This might encourage
new manufacturing companies to operate. We would then
have competitive buying and manufacturing, with a dozen
brands of Australian tobacco on the market instead of one
or two. I must say, however, that a bounty, especially if
made retrospective, would give relief to growers, which is
badly needed.
6030. I suppose you have had experience of the sun-
curing method?— Yes.
6031. Were the growers mostly Chinese when that
method was followed? —Yes.


6032. Did you grow tobacco with Chinese labour?—
Only on shares for some years.
6033. Ho w many Chinese are in the district now?—
About twenty.
6034. Are there about the same number of white
growers ?—Yes.
6035. Were there many whites growing when the
sun-curing method was in vogue?— No.
6036. When you adopted sun-curing, did you get a
large percentage of dark leaf ?—lt was nearly all dark
according to the present grading. The highest price
was 2s. per lb., and the average would be Is. S4d and
Is. 7d.
6037. What area do you now plant?— Only 2- or 3
acres.
6038. Do you flue-cure the leaf yourself ? —Yes.
6039. Any difficulty?— Not if we could grow a suit-
able leaf.
6040. Have you had any help from the New South
Wales Department?— Yes.
6041. From Mr. Tregenna ?—Yes.
6042. Have you studied the cultivation of tobacco?
—Yes, to a fair extent.
6043. Have you read any pamphlets or bulletins?—
Yes.
6044. Do you subscribe to the evidence of Mr.
Stevens that when the seasons here were good you had
no trouble in getting a large percentage of bright
mahogany, but in a cold season, w T hen the leaf could
not ripen, the bulk of the crop was dark?— Yes. In
the last few years the cold seasons have been fairly
consistent, but some years ago probably every third
year would be bad.
6045. Have you had much trouble from blue mould?
Yes.
6046. Have you ever had your crop completely
wiped out ?—Practically.
6047. Do you get some blue mould every year? —
Yes.
6048. What price have you been getting since you
have been flue-curing?—Up to three years ago my
average was about 25., or a little more, including the
bonus.
6049. Did you get more bright than dark?— No.
If mahogany No. 1 is considered dark we get more
dark than bright.
6050. Is it possible to increase the percentage of
light?— Yes, in favorable seasons.
6051. Do you get frosts in the summer ?—No.
6052. Do you always get cold nights?— Very often.
6053. Has tobacco-growing paid you?—Up to three
years ago it did; then the seasons became unfavorable.
6054. Has the texture of your leaf improved since
you have been flue-curing?— Yes.
6065. In your statement, you spoke of the “ actual
value ” of the leaf. Do you think that the bonus
is part of the price that the leaf is worth?— Yes.
5056. What do you mean when you say that the
grading is getting higher each year?—We may grade
for mahogany No. 1, and the leaf fails to come up to
that grade. It may be classed as No. 2or No. 3.
6057. Do you do your own grading?— Mostly. Of
recent years the tendency has been for the grades to be
harder.
6058. Do you put the slipping back of the industry
in the Tumut district down to the seasons?— Mainly to
them and lack of confidence on the part of the
growers.
6059. What time of the year do you start curing?—
In a decent season at the end of February, but last
year it was about the end of April,
6060. Has your experience over fourteen years been
that the seasons here are erratic?— Yes.
6061. Have you any complaint to make against the
buyers?—No, they have always treated me fairly
enough.
6062. Have you tried “Waratah”?—Yes, I am
smoking it now.
6063. Does it burn your tongue?— No.
6064. Does it dry your throat ?—No. The only
difference is that it does not seem to have the same
strength in the first draw or two, but it burns better
than other tobaccoes.
6065. Do you know anybody else who smokes it?—
Yes.
6066. If you had no other tobacco would you be
satisfied with “ Waratah” as it is to-day?— Yes.
6067. You say that if the public cannot get Aus-
tralian tobacco the position is hopeless, "and, therefore,
you are in favour of an alteration of the tariff. If
the tariff were altered with that object, and you still
could not get Australian tobacco, it would make the
public pay more?—l firmly believe that their require-
ments can be met by locally-grown leaf.
6068. Do you favour making the imported tobacco
dearer straight away in order to give the local industry
a chance to develop in the next five or ten years? I
think that would help the industry.
6069. Hut would it be agreeable to the smokers of
tooacco to have to wait five or six years before they
couid get sufficient local tobacco at a cheaper price?—
tdo not say that. Not until we can grow enough
tobacco. &
6070. We cannot grow more without protection ?
L nless the industry is helped in some way to increase
tne demand and encourage the local production.
60 <l. You say that the industry Avould be helped by
the appearance of other buyers and manufacturers,
u hat is the use of their coming into the field if they
cannot buy the tobacco that they would need? But
there would be some encouragment for more growers
to go in for tobacco.
6072. If there were more buyers, do you think there
would be more growers in Tumut ?—Yes.
6073. They would have a shot at it on the chance
that they couid sell their leaf ?—Yes.
6074. If they produced only dark leaf, as they are
to-day, found that the new buyers wanted only
light leaf, it would not help Tumut very much?—l
think that dark tobacco would be manufactured as well.
It is not that dark leaf will not smoke as well as light
leaf.
60(5. By Mr. '1 idly. —Do you smoke cigarettes?—
Yes, I make my own.
6076. Smoke this one and tell me what you think
re f, ar( * as mo . re suitable to my taste than
a Capstan. Probably it is somewhat stronger.
607(. By the Chairman. —Does it burn your throat?
—No.
6078. Can you taste any tang about it?— No.
6079. By Mr Tully. —That is made from Austra-
lian tobacco. What do you think of it ?—I do not get
satisfaction out of manufactured cigarettes, but this
one suits me.
The witness withdrew.
Harry Lisle 'Vickery, tobacco-grower, Tumut, was
called, sworn and examined.
6080. By the -Chairman.—Are you a member of the
local association?— Yes.
6080 a. How long have you been growing tobacco?
—-Seven or eight years.
6081. All flue-curing ?—No.
6082. How did you get on with the sun-drying?
Fairly well.


6083. What price did you get in your last year for
sun-dried tobacco? —One shilling and twopence per lb.
I adopted that system for only two years. I got Is.
6|d. the first year and Is. 2d. the second year.
6084, Why did you change over? —The demand
seemed to he for flue-cured leaf.
6085. Did the buyer ask you to change? —No.
6086. What area did you put under crop?— About
two acres.
6087. What yield did you get from that area? —
About 11 cwt.
6088. What would he the average for the district?
—Six hundred or 700 lb. to the acre.
6089. Do you grow on dark or light soil? —Light.
6090. Do you irrigate?— Yes, occasionally.
6091. What is your maximum area? —About six and
a half acres.
6092. Do you work it yourself?— Yes, and pay for
labour.
6093. Do you employ Chinese? —No.
6094. Do you do your own curing?—l taught myself
by watching others. Mr. Lough was the only man
who told me anything about it.
6095. How do you get on with your proportions of
bright and dark leaf?—l submit to the committee my
account sales.
6096. I notice that in 1926 and 1927, you had nearly
all bright, and your average price was about 2s. 6d.
per lb. ?—Yes, about 2s. sd.
6097. In 1928, you had 2,200 lb. and only 114 lb.
of that was dark. You got 2s. 6d. for bright, 2s. Id.
for second bright, and Is. 3d. for dark. In 1929, out
of 4,300 lb. you had only one-fourth dark. How did
you get so much bright while other growers have so
much dark? —I do not know, unless there is something
in the soil, and the attention I give to the crop.
6098. By Mr. Martens. —What varieties do you
grow?— Principally Yellow Gum. I experiment with
different varieties and adopt the best for my purposes.
Yellow Gum seems to resist mould and other diseases
better than other varieties.
6099. By the Chairman. —Are you satisfied with the
prices you have been getting?— Yes.
6100. Are you prepared to keep going on the same
terms? —It is getting harder. Last year, I think, I
should have had a little more.
6101. Why was all your good stuff classed as dark?
—-Possibly it may have been in the grading.
6102. Did not the leaf look as good as in the pre-
vious year? —It did, hut I do not think it was of as
good a. quality.
6103. What do you think last year’s leaf should
have brought ?—The best should have fetched an-
other Bd.
6104. My Mr. Martens.— lf it had been regraded
more carefully would portion of it have brought more?
—Yes.
6105. By the Chairman. —Do you regard Tumut as
a suitable district for bright tobacco?—lt would be if
we could beat the blue mould.
6106. Apart from that you have cold growing
seasons ? —Occasionally we do. The last three have
been cold, but up till then it has been fairly steady.
6107. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you experience summer
frosts?—We get them first about the middle of April.
6108. By Mr. Jones. —ln 1928 you had 82 per cent,
of bright leaf and were paid for that. In 1929 you
had no bright leaf at all?—I was paid for none, but
I think it was my own fault in the grading.
6109. Another 3d. per lb. would have meant a bonus
of 9d. ?—Yes.
6110. Do you not think that it would have paid
you to grade the bright, and get the benefit of the extra
6d. bounty, as well as the extra 3d. per lb.?—lt is
doubtful.
6111. In 1929 you had nearly double the quantity
you had in 1928. Did you have double the acreage
under crop?— Yes.
6112. Notwithstanding that, the total sum received
in the second year was only about 50 per cent, more
than in the previous year ?—That is the only year in
which, I think, the work hardly paid me.
6113. Will it pay you to be more careful in grading?
—Yes.
The witness withdrew
William Arthur Sturt, farmer and tobacco-grower,
Tumut, was called, sworn and examined.
6114. By Mr. Jones. —Are you a member of the
local association?— Yes.
6115. Do you wish to make a statement? —Yes. It
is as follows: —
I have had ten years experience as a tobacco-grower. On
my return from the war I heard glowing accounts about the
huge cheques collected by Chinese growers and a few whites
for air-cured tobacco during the war period, manufacturers
paying up to 2s. per lb., for the bulk of the leaf.
I made up my mind to give it a trial in conjunction with
maize-growing. The first year I contented myself by sowing
an acre of tobacco, yielding 15 cwt., the price being Is. Bd.
per lb. The second year I sowed two acres, the yield being
about the same per acre and the price being Is. 6d. per lb.
The purchaser was the late Mr. Gilmour, of the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company. He stated that the Tumut
leaf, if properly flue-cured, was second to none in the world,
and that he would be prepared to pay 2s. 6d. per lb. for the
flue-cured leaf.
I decided to build a barn and make an attempt at the flue-
curing system. I put in 5,000 tobacco plants and was unable
to secure any more healthy plants diving that season, as
mould was very prevalent. I harvested and cured the 5,000
plants, my average price being a little over 25., net returns
£lO7. The next year I planted a larger acreage, the price
being about the same.
During these two years every local newspaper in areas
where tobacco could be grown was strongly advocating the
growing of tobacco and the flue-curing system, also publish-
ing glowing accounts of the large returns per acre of the
few pioneers of the industry. I have since concluded that
this was propaganda by some of the manufacturers trying
to get an increased production of Australian-grown leaf.
During the next two years the prices remained about the
same, though the standard of grading by the combine buyers
was becoming higher each year; that is to say, leaf which
was classified by them as first bright during the first two
years was classified as mahogany during the third and fourth
years, prices being paid accordingly.
During the second two years all newspaper boosting of
the industry had ceased, and a rumor began to circulate
that the aroma of our tobacco was not up to the standard
of American leaf.
The combine then made a promise to the growers that they
would put 100 per cent. Australian leaf on the market. They
did so, calling it “ Waratah ” tobacco. The extent of their
attempt to market it consisted of advertising it and selling
only in centres where tobacco was grown. It was not ad-
vertised in any city newspapers, nor did city tobacconists
know of its existence. The tobacco was a very moderate
smoke and had the appearance of being chiefly air-dried leaf.
This ceasing to boost the industry caused me to ask the
reason of it, also to make inquiries regarding the matter.
Their boosting for two years, and then suddenly finding an
objectionable aroma, seemed rather strange after having manu-
factured Australian-grown leaf for 70 years. I came to the
conclusion that probably the fact that America was negotia-
ting with France for a 99 years’ monopoly of the tobacco trade
in France had something to do with the matter. If this
arrangement had not fallen through it would have used up
all the American surplus and so left Australia short of sup-
plies.
The combine, after suddenly discovering the inferiority of
our leaf, decided to import American “ experts ” at a re-
munerative salary to discover what was wrong with it, and
I personally consider that their wonderful generosity was
paid through the nose by the grower by the increased stan-
dard of grading. Each succeeding year the standard of grad-
ing has become higher, and their prices correspondingly lower,
the aroma being more objectionable each year. Upon the
agitation of growers a deputation went to Mr. Bruce, asking
for a bounty on our tobacco or a decrease in excise duty.


J he -combine again became generous and offered the Federal
Government £25,000 if the Government would supply the same
amount to carry on research work to try and improve the
aroma of our leaf. 1 again claim that this £25,000 is being-
supplied through the nose by the growers, as the dividends
of the combine have not decreased, and their net profits are
increasing annually.
Regarding the bounty. I do not personally believe it would
help to put the industry on its feet. If we were being paid
(id. bounty by the Government, I believe the combine would
reduce the prices paid to the grower accordingly. M3 7 opinion
is that if the excise duty were abolished and the import duty
increased, that increase would not have to be very great to
compensate the Government for their loss of revenue in
abolishing the excise duty. Its abolition would help smaller
companies to operate successfully against the combine with
Australian-grown leaf.
Regarding research work now being carried on, I believe
it to be most essential, not for the improvement in the aroma
of our leaf, but to concentrate on the diseases attacking
tobacco plants. I believe that this branch of research work
should be a permanent body, paid by the Federal Government
without any assistance from the combine. I realize that one
of our greatest difficulties in this district is to get our tobacco
in early enough to be properly matured and Hue-cured before
the frosty weather sets in, being due to the fact that blue
mould attacks the plants later in this district than in most
other areas. 1 say without fear of contradiction that if the
disease problem could be overcome sufficiently to ensure early
sowings annually, we could produce and cure leaf equal to
the world s best. Regarding the aroma, those who have
travelled the world and smoked tobacco produced and manu-
factured in other countries know that the tobacco grown in
each and every country has a distinct aroma of its own, and
as the taste for tobacco is not born with us, but is simply
an acquired one, gained by constant usage, I claim that
there would be no difficulty in educating the public to smoke
our tobacco if the manufacturers wished it.
1 have spoken rather plainly concerning my views of the
combine, and, to show that I have studied both sides of the
question, I realize that the manufacturers, owing to the
irregularity of production and curing, are not in a position
to manufacture a standard tobacco 100 per cent. Australian.
I would suggest alternative, that if the Government
declined to interfere with excise, a representative body be
appointed annually as a board to fix the price of the various
grades of tobacco, and the manufacturer be compelled to pur-
chase the whole of the leaf at the prices fixed by the board,
being allowed to import only enough leaf from overseas an-
nually to make up the Australian requirements.
I have not gone into any details about my crops during
the last five or six years as my returns have been about on a
par with most other growlers, whom I know will supply vou
with the information which you require.
The statements I have made are simply the conclusions I
have arrived at after ten years’ experience in the industry.
6116. Have you presented the views embodied in
your statement to your association ?—Yes, so far as I
could.
6117. When did you put in 5,000 plants?— About
1924. My net return was £167. It was a wonderfully
good crop; the plants were sown in October and
harvested in 1925.
6118. When did Mr. Gilmour say that Tumut
tobacco, when flue-cured, would be second to none* —
In 1923.
6119. Did he mean second to none in Australia?—
No, in the world.
6120. Do you recommend the abolition of the excise
duty on all tobacco imported?—No, only on Australian-
grown leaf.
6121. You suggest a valuation board?—lf the
Government could not see its way clear to remove the
excise, I would suggest a board of that kind.
6122. You say that the company should be compelled
to purchase the leaf as valued by the board?—lt could
be done by limiting the company’s supplies from over-
seas.
6123. Is it not a big thing to try to compel the
company to buy Australian leaf?— Yes; but it should
be possible.
_ 6124. What is the total area under tobacco in this
district ?—Roughly, 150 acres, or perhaps 200 acres.
6125, It has been said that there are twenty white
growers and twenty Chinese?— There are many more
than twenty whites.
6126. Do you think there would be 100 acres under
crop?— Probably more than that would be sown; but
it has not matured owing to root rot. We have had
three remarkably changeable seasons. Apart from blue
mould, we do not have more than one bad growing
season in six.
6127. What is your biggest area?— One year 1 put
in 8 acres, and harvested only 5 acres.
6128. What about last season?—l had only 3 acres.
I prepared 6 acres, but could not get sufficient plants.
6129. What yield do you expect?— Nine hundred-
weight for the 3 acres.
6130. Will that pay?— Certainly not.
6131. Are your prices satisfactory?— Yes, for the
grades; but we are being asked to produce a very high
standard. A lot of inferior tobacco has been grown
here by the Chinese.
6132. Did you have any bright leaf last year?— Very
little. Por the three years I was growing tobacco
plants at Leeton there was no trouble from blue mould.
The greatest trouble was from the grub.
6133. If things were left as they are would you be
prepared to go on growing tobacco?— No. I do not
think the industry would go ahead at all. In our
district the holdings are rather small. The farmers
have been getting a living out of maize on small hold-
ings. Most of them are too small for dairying, and
therefore they either have to sell out to one another
to make the blocks large enough for dairying, or go
in for tobacco.
6134. In 1927 Mr. Vickery had 82 per cent, of bright
leaf. How was your crop in that year?— Mr. Vickery
has been more successful than I with the curing. My
returns were reasonably good. I think I was 6d. per
lb. lower all round than Mr. Vickery.
6135. Did you ever try to find out why Mr. Vickery
is more successful than you are?— Yes. He seems
to get his leaf to mature a little better than mine.
-My greatest difficulty is to secure plants early enough.
6136. By Mr. Morgan. —What kind of land do you
cultivate for tobacco ?—-My land has been producing
maize. It is alluvial soil.
6137. Would you describe it as rich? —Yes. It
grows good lucerne.
6138. You spoke of “ Waratah ” tobacco, and said
it was not well advertised. You said that it was the
fault of the company that it had fallen from public
favour. Do you know that it was well advertised in
1924?—1 made personal inquiries in Sydney, and 1
never saw it advertised in a city newspaper.
6139. Mr, Bentley, one of the directors of the com-
pany, said in evidence that the product was well adver-
tised ?—Certainly it was in districts where it was
grown, such as Albury and Tumut.
6140. You do not suggest that it was Albury and
places like that which increased the sale from 48 lb.
in 1924 to 3,252 lb. in 1925, and to 11,607 lb. in 1926.
That would suggest that it was well advertised, and
was consumed in populous areas?— Those are not big
quantities for twelve months.
6141. How do you account for the slump to 4,090 lb.
in 1927, to 1,877 lb. in 1928, and to 1,029 lb. in 1929?
—I am not prepared to answer that.
6142. Do you suggest that the 11,607 lb. consumed
in 1926 was used in places like Albury and Tumut?
—That is not a large quantity; it is only about 5|
tons.
6143. By Mr. 1 ally. —After harvesting your crop
what do you do with the plants?— They are either cut
off or ploughed under.
6144. How long through the winter do you allow
them to grow?— Until the frosts kill them off.
6145. Is the major portion of the land on which
you grow tobacco suitable for lucerne?— Yes.


6146. By Mr. Morgan. —Do you know that some
scientific men say that the practice of certain growers
to allow tobacco plants to stand over the winter is
one of the most prolific causes of the perpetuation of
blue mould?—l cannot agree with that. I had it one
year and the next year I did not have any either in
the seed beds or in the field. Some of the growers
consider that mould is not confined to tobacco. They
say that quite a number of other forms of vegetation
are subject to that disease.
The witness withdrew
Frederick Brooke Darling, farmer, Cheshunt, and
President of the Victorian Tobacco-Growers As-
sociation, was recalled and further examined.
6147. By the Chairman. —I understand that you
have a statement to make? —Yes. At a meeting of the
Executive of the Victorian Tobacco-Growers Associa-
tion, the following evidence was agreed to for the
consideration of this committee. The meeting of the
executive was held at Wangaratta on the 30th May,
1930:
Tobacco-growers note with apprehension the suggestion made
by Mr. Gepp to the select committee that the executive work
of tobacco investigation should be shared by the new con-
sultative committee and the Council for Scientific and In-
dustrial Research, with Mr. Gepp as chairman, particularly
in view of the extravagant expenditure over the last three
years for so small a result. Moreover, growers are of the
opinion that divided control is undesirable in that it will
be costly and lead to confusion.
Growers also think that the results as shown to date by
the Director of Tobacco Investigation are not satisfactory
or commensurate with the amount of money expended, and
cannot understand why Victoria, the leading tobacco-growing
State, should have only £l5O spent on experimental work
against £3,000 for Queensland, a State where tobacco-growing
has failed in the past. They would prefer that such an office
be filled by a man selected from Australians who has the
interests of his country at heart. They realize that research
work in tobacco culture and treatment must necessarily cover
a long period of years, and that continuity in such work is
essential, and they believe that scientific research should be
controlled by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Re-
search under its Minister, working in collaboration with the
States’ experts as the most economical and satisfactory system
to be adopted, with a State advisory body having a 50 per
cent, representation of growers to keep the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research in touch with the actual
conditions of the industry. Little new machinery would be
required if this view w T ere adopted, and over-lapping would
be avoided. Growers are also of opinion that the funds for
this purpose should be provided by the Federal Government
and the State Governments interested, and that the work
should be permanent as is the case in the United States of
America where, notwithstanding the fact that tobacco has
been grown for centuries, research is still necessary in regard
to disease and other troubles affecting the industry.
Tobacco-growers consider that they should have an op-
portunity of perusing the economic survey report, as they
have reason to think that misleading statements have been
made with respect to their prospects in Victoria of producing
a good tobacco. This has led to an unsettled feeling which
is prejudicial to the interests of the industry, and they feel
they should be given an opportunity of refuting such state-
ments, if untrue, or at least knowing where they stand. They,
therefore, request that the report referred to be made avail-
able to their association for perusal.
The Victorian Tobacco-Growers Association would finally
urge the committee to abolish the excise duty as the best
means to assist the industry, at the same time adding suf-
ficient to the import duty to balance the revenue. Already
the recent additions to the import duty have had the effect of
inducing a prominent tobacco firm to commence operations
in the manufacture of tobacco, and it is believed that others
will follow suit. Given competition for Australian tobacco,
the industry must progress, and much of the money now sent
out of Australia for raw leaf will be circulated amongst our
own people, while in time probably a large export of leaf
may be expected.
6148. Of course, you realize that the investigation
has been proceeding for only about three years. I
presume you do not expect final results during that
time?— Ho.
F. 218. —22
6149. Do yon consider that the money expended on
the investigation has been proportionately spent in the
different tobacco-growing areas?— Taking it broadly,
over the whole of Australia, we consider that the re-
sults obtained are not commensurate with the expendi-
ture incurred, and particularly in Victoria. In that
State, where we are growing tobacco more or less suc-
cessfully, there has been no investigation at all.
6150. You speak of having a Director of Tobacco
Investigation who is an Australian, who has the in-
terests of his country at heart, but suppose we cannot
secure an Australian with the necessary qualifications
for the work?— But we feel sure that we can get a
man fully qualified for it. With the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research in charge, I under-
stand they have a scientific man available now.
6151. We cannot issue an order that the Economic
Survey Committee’s report be made available to the
growers. It was submitted to us confidentially. My
recollections of it are that it contains nothing to bear
out your contention that hostile opinions were ex-
pressed about the Victorian tobacco-growing areas. The
whole thing was very non-committal ?—The growers
feel that the fact, that the report has not been made
public, indicates that something is being held back.
6152. I will not say that the report gave you a big
advertisement, but I cannot recollect anything in the
nature of criticism about areas being considered un-
suitable; in fact I was rather surprised at the non-
committal nature of the whole report?— Another thing
that made the growers doubtful was that the British-
Australasian Tobacco Company received a copy of the
report.
6153. But the company is a party to the investiga-
tion?—We think that we should have been a party
to it.
6154. It was suggested to us that it would be dif-
ficult to secure a man who would be thoroughly repre-
sentative of all the growers of Australia. They said
they would welcome a man who w T as thoroughly repre-
sentative. This committee has not come to any de-
cision on that matter? —There was a suggestion that
there should be an advisory board in each State, con-
sisting of six members, three of whom were growers.
6155. That would be all right if it had some power,
but if it were merely to advise, and nobody need take
any notice of its advice, it would not “ cut much ice ” ?
—The advisory system works well in the pastoral in-
dustry.
6156. The committee will give full consideration to
the view you have expressed, and to the matter of secur-
ing some representation for the growers. You also
said you vyould like to see the excise abolished. Do
you mean the excise on all tobacco?—l mean the excise
on the Australian leaf only. The loss of revenue could
be balanced by an increase in the import duty.
6157. You are not advocating that the excise duty
should be removed from tobacco generally?—We should
not object to that if we were given sufficient protection
through the import duty.
6158. By Mr. Jones. —Have any representations
been made by your association to the Pomonal growers
that they should link up with you?— Unofficially yes,
but not officially in the last two years. When they
broke away from our association we made representa-
tions to them; but they said they were too far away and
could not send delegates.
6159. By Mr. Slagg '. —l think that you made the
statement that it was the opinion of your association
that the work of the Tobacco Investigation had not
justified the expenditure?— That is so.
6160. Were you speaking for all Australia or only
for Victoria? —The Victorian Tobacco Growers Asso-
cition was speaking for Victoria.


6161. Which association comprises only growers in
the Ovens Yalley?—Also the King Valley and the
Goulburn Yalley—broadly speaking, the north-east of
Victoria.
6162. What percentage of those growers are members
of your association?—At least 70 per cent., and prob-
ably more.
6163. Is that feeling shared by the majority of the
members of your association? —Certainly, on the vote
that was taken.
6164. Did you have a full meeting when the question
was discussed?— Yes.
6165. Is the statement presented merely the result
of a meeting between the secretary of the association,
yourself, and Mr. Temple Smith? —I would hardly do
a thing like that; I am surprised at that suggestion.
6166. Then this was the considered opinion of your
association?— Yes.
6167. Why was not this statement made when the
evidence was taken in your district?— Because the
opinion had not crystallized. We have had an execu-
tive meeting since the committee was last at Myrtle-
ford. Our only general meetings are the annual meet-
ings, and even at them the voting is done by the dele-
gates from the various branches.
6168. By Mr. Morgan. —Has your executive met
since we were at Myrtleford last week?— Yes.
6169. Are you prepared to disclose the names of
your executive?— Certainly. Mr. Sambell, the secre-
tary, will give you the list.
The witness withdrew.
Leslie Herbert Sambell, Beechworth, secretary of the
Victorian Tobacco Growers Association, Wan-
garatta, was recalled and further examined.
6170. By the Chairman. —Have you anything fur-
ther to say regarding the decision of your executive?
—The decision reached on Friday was unanimous.
One reason they approved of the suggestion that the
investigation work be handed over to the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research was that it would
result in continuity of the work. Even if the Inves-
tigation Committee were re-appointed for another
three or four years, at some stage there would have to
be a change-over and there would be overlapping to
some extent. We take it that it would not be policy
to have a body giving sole attention to tobacco when
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was
inquiring into all branches of production. We have
seen in the past that the Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research has done valuable work, such as
in the eradication of prickly pear, and that work has
been done with the advice and co-operation of the
growers. I understand that the Victorian Tobacco
Growers Association objected in the first place to the
appointment of the present Investigation Committee.
So it has always opposed it, partly because it has no
representation and did not consider that this should be
a separate body. Therefore the statement presented
to-day by us squares with the decision of our executive
commitffee two or three years ago, and it has had no
reason to alter its opinion since. Reference has been
made to the part that the association has taken in
giving advice to growers. I think that I said at
Wangaratta that we had 150 members in our six
branches, and had sent out over 2,000 copies of bulle-
tins, including the whole of my statements made at the
Wangaratta conference, and in every case the growers
have supported those statements. We induced the
Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, as well as the
Assistant Minister, last year and this year to visit
tobacco districts to see the crops and to extend the
services of Mr. Smith. We also made application to
the Minister for Trade and Customs, Mr. Fenton,
for the appointment of this select committee,
a federal marketing act, and for an increase in
the import duty. We got in touch with the
growers when the extra duty was imposed, and
assured them that the extra 6d. would be paid imme-
diately the tariff was increased. I have copies of
six bulletins here which bear out what I say. Refer-
ence is made to the fact that the growers must improve
their curing and grading, and that the important
matter was the failure of the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company to buy the 700 bales rejected last
year. We approached the company, and we had to go
down on a second occasion before we could get a final
agreement by it to reconsider its attitude with regard
to the purchase of that leaf. I was authorized to see
the company, and the following week the president
was appointed to go with me. It was not until the
company consulted its Sydney people that it agreed
to the regrading. It then sent Mr. Lough into the
district, and that was done as the result of the repre-
sentations of our association. That is some of the
work that the association has done. Since we gave
evidence at Wangaratta, particularly owing to a leaflet
published by Mr. Temple Smith and issued in
bulletin form by me, in regard to methods
of growing, there has been an increased percentage
of bright leaf in our district this year. I think this
will be definitely shown when the results are tabulated.
It is partly due to the advice of State experts in regard
to early growing, and more careful grading before
curing. We hope also that there will be an increased
price because of more careful grading after curing.
We estimate that if this inquiry recommend our claims
for abolition of excise duty and improved marketing,
it will probably be the means of providing
3,000 or 5,000 farms for tobacco-growers through-
out Australia. We have no axe to grind for
Victoria; but we are interested in the success
of the industry as Australians and as producers. We
think that this industry will be one of the means of
rectifying the adverse trade balance. This committee
has had evidence from men of great experience, includ-
ing Sir George Julius, who are satisfied that Australia
can produce from 60 per cent, to 80 per cent, of its
tobacco requirements. Therefore we think that very
careful consideration should be given to the nature of
future investigations. They must be handed over to
some body, and we think that results would come more
quickly if it were entrusted to a permanent body such
as the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research
rather than to some temporary body. In the King
Valley we have 100 per cent, of the growers in our
organization, and over 80 per cent, in the Ovens Valley.
I think that in a few months over 90 per cent, of them
will belong to the association. The executive meeting,
to which reference has been made to-day, was called
in the ordinary way. Every branch was notified, and
the decision come to was unanimous. A resolution was
also carried that two officers should be appointed in
Victoria in place of Mr. Temple Smith; one to deal
with the industry at the Melbourne end, and the other
to confine himself to field work, in the King and Ovens
Valleys, at Pomonal, or in any new district. The Vic-
torian Director of Agriculture, Dr. Cameron, thinks
that within twelve months he could provide an officer
to take up the work that Mr. Temple Smith has been
carrying out. I think that it will be seen that Victoria
has been most successful in the cultivation of tobacco,
and it has given most assistance to the growers through
its officers. We hope that the results of experiments
in Queensland prove satisfactory. When we mentioned
that only £l5O had been spent in Victoria, we referred
to experimental work, and the opinion we expressed
is based on evidence given to us. We think that, at
a time when the Government is trying to economize,


the abolition of the excise department would be justi-
fied, if it would mean a saving providing the
equivalent of the present excise duty was added
to the import duty. I believe that in Rhodesia
the import duty has been increased to ss.
per lb., and tobacco is being grown successfully in that
country. Therefore, we are merely asking for condi-
tions similar to those obtaining in Rhodesia. When
the grower gets 2s. per lb. for his leaf, and the con-
sumer has to pay 10s. per lb. for the manufactured
article, there must be something radically wrong,
because all the risk in the way of pests, &c., is taken
by the growers. One or two of the growers said that
they would be satisfied with 2a. per lb, if they could
get a crop every year; but they do not get regular
crops.
6171. By Mr. Morgan. —When did you decide that it
was necessary to present this further evidence?— From
the day that the committee sat at Wangaratta when
we obtained assurance that my association could give
further evidence before the close of the inquiry.
6172. Why did you not submit this evidence last
week when we sat at Myrtleford ?—We asked for a copy
of the evidence that had been given before this com-
mittee, so that we might consider it, and it was not
until we saw the chairman at Myrtleford that we
obtained it.
6173. Did not the Victorian Tobacco-Growers As-
sociation pass a vote of confidence in Mr. Slagg and
his work?—l understand that it did, so far as the
investigations had been carried out in co-operation with
the State.
6174. Then why this extraordinary change of
opinion. Were the growers wrong when they adopted
that resolution?—We have not said anything wrong
about Mr. Slagg.
6175. You do not think there is anything in the state-
ment presented to-day that conflicts with the resolution
passed at the meeting of the growers?—l think that
the reason for passing a vote of confidence in Mr. Slagg
was to show that we were willing to co-operate with
him. I think that in the letter written to him we
agreed to co-operate-.
6176. When was that resolution passed?— Towards
the end of last year.
6177. Can you see any dissonance between that reso-
lution and the statement presented this morning ?—I do
not think so. There was no intention to give this evi-
dence at Myrtleford. We asked for an opportunity to
give it at the close of the inquiry, and we were told we
could do so at Canberra or Melbourne. Mr. Lough
said that the growers had no organization, but that is
not correct. At the meeting we had had no definite
results of the investigation. At Myrtleford one of the
biggest growers produced a bulletin issued by the
Investigation Committee, which talked about turpen-
tine in Australian tobacco, and the whole meeting was
unanimously opposed to the suggestion that there w T as
turpentine in the tobacco grown at Milawa.
6178. Have they rescinded the vote of confidence
passed in Mr. Slagg and his work?— Hot definitely.
They have not been asked to do so, but at a large meet-
ing at Myrtleford six weeks ago growers unanimously
carried a resolution requesting an Australian be ap-
pointed.
6179. By Mr. Martens. —What bulletin of Mr.
Slagg’s makes reference to turpentine?—l think Ho. 2.
6180. Mr. Slagg. —In describing a sample of tobacco
from Milawa it was said in the bulletin that bright
mahogany “Ho. 1 thin ” had a very good burn, a grey
ash, and a fairly good aroma. Under the column
headed “ Remarks ” occurred the words, “ A mild
aroma lacking in fullness, with a slight tang like tur-
pentine.” That was merely a method of describing the
aroma. Some of the best American flue-cured tobaccoes
carry a tang suggestive of turpentine.
6181. By Mr. Morgan. —Who are the members of the
executive committee of your association, who attended
the meeting last Friday?— Messrs. Hill, Rae, Rees,
Muller, Smith, Kneebone, Darling and Hoy. Mr.
Temple Smith, and myself, were also present. Every
district is represented.
6182. You said you were waiting to get a report of
the evidence given before this committee before you
summoned this meeting, and that is why you did not
give this evidence at Myrtleford. Have you been
through the 600 pages of evidence that has been taken ?
—Pretty well.
6183. The only thing you found worth rebutting was
the evidence of Mr. Gepp, which was not in that report
at all? —I think that the chairman of this committee
said that there was no necessity for us to rebut a lot
of the evidence that had been given.
6184. But that is the only evidence you saw fit to
come here to rebut?—We would welcome the oppor-
tunity to rebut Mr. Walker’s evidence and others, but
the chairman said there was no necessity for it.
6185. But the only evidence you have rebutted is
evidence not included in that report?— The chairman
of this committee said we need not go to the trouble of
rebutting all the evidence given.
6186. By the Chairman. —-I think that I said it was
not worth while the association traversing the whole
of the evidence, but, if there was anything fresh that
it wanted to say, the committee would like to hear it?
—My reason for coming here was to support the advice
of the chairman of the Council for Scientific and In-
dustrial Research, and Dr. Rivett, that that body should
take over this w T ork. We had not considered that phase
when we gave evidence at Wangaratta, but now we are
unanimous. We refer to the whole of the investigation
work. The field work might probably be delegated to
a certain extent to the States.
6187. By Mr. Martens. —Suppose the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research wants nothing to do
with it except from the scientific viewpoint?—We take
it that that body will not be able to make a thorough
investigation without practical assistance from the
growers.
6188. But it wants to have nothing to do with the
field work. It merely desires to have control of par-
ticular plots for experimental purposes ?—I take it
that it would carry out the research work in collabora-
tion with the States. That is the evidence of Dr.
Rivett and Sir George Julius.
6189. By Mr. Morgan. —How many delegates were
present at the meeting of your executive? —Eight.
6190. How many branches has the association? —
Five.
6191. How many delegates from each branch attend
executive meetings?— Two.
6192. Therefore, eight out of ten were present?—
Yes, every branch is represented and every delegate was
invited to the meeting.
6193, Did any of those delegates give evidence at
Wangaratta?—All, I think, except Mr. Hill and Mr.
Hoy.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.


(Taken at Canberra.)
THURSDAY, sth JUHE, 1930.
Present:
Mr. Thompson, Chairman;
Mr. Morgan | Mr. Tully.
Cecil Joseph Tregenna, Tobacco Expert, Department of
Agriculture, Hew South Wales, was recalled and
further examined.
6194. By the Chairman. —Have you a statement to
make to the committee?— Ho. Unfortunately, when I
arrived at my office yesterday morning my office was
locked, and the key could not be found until the after-
noon. I therefore had no time to prepare a statement.
1 wish to refer to certain evidence which has been
given so as to explain matters which are not quite
clear at_ present. The first question which I wish to
refer to is number 3086, page 287. It is Mr. McMaster’s
evidence, and portion of the question reads—
Mr. Lough on one occasion suggested that we experiment
with a different variety. He sent up four kinds of seed, and
I passed the seed on to the Italians who grew it ... It
is rather interesting to note that Mr. Tregenna condemned
the whole four of these varieties.
I did not make that statement to the extent to which
Mr. McMasters has implied. I advised him to go very
slowly with any new varieties. In the first place, the
seed was not acclimatized, and in the second place, I
had seen some had results from imported seed in the
first year. Men are apt to go “ nap ” with a crop of
new seed, and I have seen some absolute failures.
About six years ago, three growers whom I know, put
in a new variety which was supposed to be immune
from blue mould, but they lost every plant through that
disease. Eor that reason, I am cautious when a man
asks me about new varieties. While there is a certain
amount of truth in Mr. McMaster’s statement, it is
not quite what I said. The evidence is to the effect
that I am against any new varieties being introduced,
and I want to remove that impression. The next
question is number 3315 on page 304. It reads—
Mr. Tregenna says that North Queensland is the only
place where suitable tobacco leaf is likely to be grown.
On the 14th May, I wrote the committee to the effect
that I had on no occasion stated that Horth Queensland
is the only place where suitable tobacco is likely to be
grown in Australia. What I said was that Horth
Queensland was the only place that I had visited where
suitable tobacco could be grown.
6195. According to question 1359, page 178, you
were asked by me, " What is your opinion of Horth
Queensland as a tobacco-growing area?” You replied,
“It is the only place in Australia that I have visited
which I think will produce high grade tobacco”? —
Exactly; the only place that I had visited. That is
my point. I did not say that Horth Queensland was
the only place where suitable tobacco could be grown.
It is quite likely that in the north of Western Aus-
tralia, in the same latitude as Mareeba, probably simi-
lar conditions would prevail.
-6196. We were furnished by the secretary of the
Australian Tobacco Investigation Committee with a
statement on the 12th May, 1930, covering a shorthand
note of a conference which took place at the office of
the Under-Secretary for Agriculture, Hew South
Wales, on the 12th July, 1927. There were present
Mr. Gepp, Mr. Ross, Dr. Darnell-Smith, and Mr.
Tregenna. We have had Mr. Gepp before us and asked
him whether the report was the property of the
Tobacco Investigation Committee, and whether we could
retain the statement not as a record but for our ow T n
information. He was willing to do that, but he made
it clear that he had not the permission of the other
gentlemen who were present at the conference. He
said that he had not read the report, but that as nearly
as lie could remember it was correct. In one place the
report reads—
Mr. Gepp. But you would have Mr. McGee after the Ist
Beptember ?
Mr. Tregenna.—We would not want Mr. McGee. I have
known for years that the destiny of the tobacco industry is
in the north, that is, in Queensland. Although I have never
seen it, I am quite sure that the soil does exist there, that
poor soil which would be close to the edge of the summer
lainfall, not the heavy rainfall of 70 or 80 inches, but just
on the fringe of the tablelands. If we ever get tobacco it
will come from there.
(C r - Gepp. You should say, “ When we get tobacco ” not
If we ever get it ”, because I am sure we will get it and
within a few years.
Mt. Tregenna. —l think it will be done there.
Mi. Gepp. -What about Mt. Barker in South Australia ?
Mr. Ross. I think that not only have you to grow it there
but you have to solve the problem of growing it here as
well.
Mr. Tregenna. I think we will get our quickest results
from Queensland.
T ou did not say on that occasion that Queensland was
the only suitable place in which tobacco could be grown?
I did not make that statement at any time. I came
from Rhodesia to this country, and the conditions that
prevail in Horth Queensland are similar to those pre-
vailing in Rhodesia and Hyasaland. The climatologi-
cal conditions are very similar as are also the soils.
Apart from that, w T e had already gone into the question
of the influence of the eucalypts on the aroma of
tobacco, and w r e had ascertained that there were no
eucalypts in Horth Queensland of the species which
grow in the south of Australia. Eor these reasons, I
said that I thought the destiny of the tobacco industry
was in the north.
619 f. What do you mean by " destiny ”?—I mean
that eventually it will be found that the best tobacco
in Australia, the tobacco which will meet the require-
ments of the Australian public, will come from the
north. It was my experience in Rhodesia which forced
me to that conclusion, and also my experience and
knowledge of the climatological conditions of Hew
South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western
Australia in the south.
6198. You have had no actual experience of Horth
Queensland?— Ho. But I have the records of the rain-
fall, temperatures and the soil conditions, which can be
obtained from any geological map or meteorological
data. I hope that I have cleared that point up. You
have repeatedly asked witnesses whether they agreed
with my evidence that Horth Queensland is the only
place where tobacco can be grown. Eor instance
question 3315 reads—" Mr. Tregenna said that Horth
Queensland is the only place where suitable tobacco
leaf is likely to be grown ”.
6199. Do you still say that?—l did not say that
Horth Queensland is the only place where suitable
tobacco can be grown. I have never made that state-
ment, and I want to correct that impression. It is the
only place that I have visited where suitable tobacco
can be grown.
6200. This is the first time that you have made that
point clear?—l have had no opportunity to do so
before.
6201. 1 have always been under the impression that
you have not concealed your opinion that Horth
Queensland is the only place where suitable tobacco
can be grown, and, in fact in many respects, you have
been most courageous in your attitude. You have a
knowledge of the existing tobacco areas of Australia?
—Yes.
6202. Therefore, it must be your opinion that Horth
Queensland is the only place where suitable tobacco
can be grown?—l have not made such a statement.
6203. At Manilla you stated that you would wipe
out South Australia and Yictona as tobacco-growing
areas?— Yes. &


6204. Question 2467, page 246, reads —
Mr. Jones. —In spite of this report will you agree with
Mr. Gepp when he says that he holds the opinion that Aus-
tralia can and will supply all the tobacco that Australia
requires?— ... It cannot be done from New South
Wales or Victoria; but it can be done from Queensland. That
remains true unless and until the public taste changes back
to the old dark tobacco.
Is that evidence correct? —It is quite right. That
evidence does not say that Queensland is the only place
in which suitable tobacco can be grown.
205. Let us clear the atmosphere. You admit that
you have a knowledge of the existing tobacco areas of
Australia. You exclude all those areas with the excep-
tion of North Queensland from areas likely to produce
tobacco that will be acceptable to the Australian smoker
and comparable with the light American variety ?
That is quite clear.
6206. Therefore, you say that Mareeba in North
Queensland is the one place in Australia to-day that*
will produce the right class of tobacco?— Yes. Of
course, suitable tobacco may be grown in the north of
Western Australia. I do not know. That territory is
uninhabited and unsurveyed. I should not like to say
that the north of.Western Australia could not grow
tobacco, because I have never seen it.
6207. A lot of misconception has arisen mainly
through your own fault. Certain press cuttings are
published in the prospectus of the Commonwealth
Tobacco Company Limited. On page 5 of the pros-
pectus is the following extract from the Sun News-
Pictorial —
Australian tobacco is equal to imported brands. Tests
proved North Queensland as the only place to grow the best.
Soil has necessary properties. “ Sydney, Sunday. —Elaborate
experiments conducted by the New South Wales tobacco
expert, Mr. G. J. Tregenna, have shown for the first time
that Australia can produce tobacco equal to the world’s best
—but under existing conditions only on the tablelands of
northern Queensland.”
That is definite enough ?—Am I responsible for news-
paper statements? I did not publish that prospectus.
6208. The people who are taking shares in this
company would naturally place faith in statements
attributed to you, as a tobacco expert. You are
managing director of the Queensland Planters Limited?
—I shall be.
6209. The Queensland Planters Limited is to grow,
harvest, and cure leaf for the Commonwealth Tobacco
Company Limited? —We are at present referring to
statements that I have made in evidence, and that
prospectus does not concern the matter at all. The
statements published in the newspapers Avere not made
by me.
6210. In all my questions on this subject I have been
concerned Avith only the best quality tobacco. I am
not referring to inferior tobacco at all. This pros-
pectus states definitely that North Queensland was the
only place Avhere suitable tobacco is likely to be
grown?—l have nothing whatever to do with that
prospectus. I said previously in my evidence that,
Avith the exception of Pomonal and North Queensland,
I do not know of any other place suitable for tobacco-
growing. Mr. Temple Smith is going to Pomonal to
groAv tobacco. Why does he not go to the Ovens Valley
or Tumut.
6211. Mr. Temple Smith has said that
Pomonal is the only place where suitable tobacco can
be groAAm ?—Mr. Temple Smith is entitled to his
opinion exactly as I am entitled to mine.
6212. You do not desire to retract from the position
that you have taken up that North Queensland is the
only place to-day where tobacco suitable for the Aus-
tralian taste is likely to be produced?—lt is the only
place of which I know.
6213. You know of all tlie other places?—l do not.
I want to make it clear that I have never stated that
North Queensland is the only place where suitable
tobacco can he grown. Suitable tobacco may be grown
in Western Australia.
6214. Tobacco is grown in South Australia to-day,
and we have a report from the department in Western
Australia that tobacco is being grown in that State in
small quantities?—lt is being grown at Manjimup,
but that is not northern Australia.
6215. The press reports in the prospectus of the
Commonwealth Tobacco Company Limited are to the
effect that you are of the opinion that tobacco equal
to the world’s best can be produced only on the table-
lands of northern Queensland? —I can assure you that
I had nothing to do with that prospectus.
6216. Surely it was your duty, if you disagreed with
those statements, to make your disagreement public.
Mr. Ross said that he never interfered with you; that
he relied upon your judgment and gave you a free
hand. The effect of those newspaper reports might
have been to close up the tobacco industry in other
parts of Australia. A lot of the growers were so dis-
heartened that they were thinking of going out of the
business altogether. We did not ask Mr. Ross a direct
question on the subject, but we gathered from him
that he relied upon your advice. He had no doubt
that you were doing your best, and that you were free
to take what steps you thought fit in respect of the
tobacco industry?—We, as members of a State service,
are not permitted to write to the newspapers.
6217. Did you see Mr. Pollock’s statement? —I saw
his evidence.
6218. He was not deterred from writing to the news-
papers when he considered that it was his duty to do
so?—We are not permitted to write to the newspapers,
without the authority of the Minister. Mr. Ross’s
view was that the best thing was to let this matter
slide.
6219. Mr. Ross did not seem to know what was going
on. My impression was that he relied upon your
advice? —No. Mr. Ross is a responsible officer, and
my chief. He is not swayed by me in any way. As
a matter of fact, he knows a good deal more about
tobacco than most people. He has had actual ex-
perience of the experimental work.
6220. You desire to place on record the fact that
North Queensland is not the only place in Australia
which can grow suitable tobacco ?—That is so. I
should be very grateful if you could make that correc-
tion. I next draw the committee’s attention to question
3327. It reads —
We have had evidence to show that experts such as Mr.
Tregenna and Mr. Temple Smith, who have been connected
Avith this industry for many years, are definitely making
statements which are having an ad\ T erse effect on the growers
and on the economic position of the industry. Would you
say that these experts are essentially field men, and not
scientists at all? —I have not sufficient knowledge of their
training and past history to know whether they have had
experience in scientific Avork; but I have always understood
that they have not. The question of blue mould had been a
Altai problem among the growers for many years, and when
the investigation committee came into the field little advance
had been made in this solution, yet within a relatively short
time the scientific workers have a solution in sight. That
shows that there has been inadequate scientific work prior
to the time that the Investigation Committee was appointed.
Whether the experts did not have the capacity to carry out
that work, or whether it was delayed for some reason, I
cannot say. The fact remains that the work was not done,
and it is a logical deduction to say that, prior to the appoint-
ment of the Imestigation Committee, something had been
Avrong.
In making that statement, Mr. Ross and myself feel
that Sir George Julius rather casts a reflection upou
the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales.
The whole statement is rather ambiguous. I should
like to say that this work on blue mould has been
carried out by scientific workers. Dr. Darnell-Smith is


a graduate of at least three universities, and he has
participated in all the work in regard to blue mould.
It would appear from the statement of Sir George
Julius that we have not the capacity to carry out that
work. It seems to me that he has no knowledge of
what has been done by our department.
6221. I think that he is referring to the scientific
side only?— That may be so; but this work has been
scientifically carried out by Dr. Darnell-Smith. We
have been successful in growing plants free from blue
mould for at least six years prior to the organization
of the Australian tobacco investigation or any research
work on the part of the officials of the Council for
Scientific and Industrial Research. We have succeeded
in growing plants year after year. We do not fear
blue mould in our seed beds at Bathurst. Sir George
Julius has stated that his scientific workers have a
solution in sight. That may be so, but I have observed
the experiments at Tumut. Mr. Temple Smith and
myself are both convinced that there is no solution in
sight as a result of the experiments that are being
carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research. I am convinced that the experiments at
Tumut, judging by the short examination of Mr.
Stevenson last week, have been an absolute failure.
According to Mr. Stevenson’s evidence, he did not get
a single plant. Yet that is the solution which Sir
George Julius has in sight. He makes a statement that
the logical deduction is that prior to the appointment
of the investigation committee something had been
wrong. We have actually succeeded in growing plants.
We have sown seeds in beds and every plant has been
affected by blue mould. We have re-sown the same
year in the same soil and obtained a full crop of
tobacco. So the contention of seed infection is not
proved at all. Yet Sir George Julius says that we have
done no work and that his staff has a solution
in sight. Mr. Temple Smith agrees with my views
on this matter.
6222. We visited the laboratory and inspected blue
mould under the microscope, and we are satisfied that
it is a disease that is carried. What are the proper
measures to take to control blue mould we cannot say,
but we are hopeful?—We have been hopeful for fifteen
years. Before announcing any opinion, Sir George
Julius should have carried out experiments for a much
longer period. I object to the reflection cast upon
myself, and particularly upon Dr. Darnell-Smith, who
is away in England and unable to reply to Sir George
Julius’ statement.
6223. I think that the suggestion conveyed in Sir
George Julius’ evidence is not that you had done
nothing, but that you were proceeding on wrong lines
done what his officers have done. I suppose that Dr.
Darnell-Smith is one of the most highly qualified
scientist in Australia, and for Sir George Julius to
make a statement like that seems to me to be very
unfair. Coming now to question 3333, which reads —
Even the growers had no knowledge of the samples being
selected. Those samples which brought the highest prices
here were considered to be worthless in London. Would the
Tobacco Investigation Executive authorize any State expert
to conduct a test of that kind ?—No. Any examination of
Australian leaf by buyers in London must, to a large extent,
be valueless. To form any opinion of the value of leaf in
Australia one requires to know the whole of the marketing
position.
I did not carry out any tests on this tobacco. I simply
acted on the instructions of Mr. Gepp. I am not
responsible for those samples being sent to London.
I was told to send them.
6224. We are not blaming you, because Mr. Gepp
told us that you were instructed to send them. We
blame the Investigation Committer for permitting a test
of this nature to be carried out in London?—At
Manilla, Mr. Parkes expressed the opinion that it was
a contemptible thing to do. That is not quite fair
to me, because I was not responsible. My difficulty
was that I could not send innumerable samples to
London. There had to be a limit to the number sent,
and I therefore decided to send the highest priced
tobacco of each grade from each State. I do not see
see what else could have been done. I have no know-
ledge of the growers in South Australia, Victoria, or
Western Australia. Yet there have been innuendoes
and insinuations made that I faked those samples. I
do not know how that could be done. I do not know
on what Sir George Julius bases his statement that any
examination of Australian leaf by buyers in London
must, to a large extent, be valueless. I come next to
question 3798. Dr. Cameron was asked —
When you previously gave evidence in Melbourne you
expressed certain opinions regarding the aroma problem in
connexion with Australian tobacco, and dealt particularly
with the question of ageing. We have since taken a lot of
evidence particularly from experts and those who have been
associated with the manufacturing side, who have been asked
about ageing . . . Would you care to make any further
comment ?
Dr. Cameron then made a statement about ageing. I
am just as entitled to my opinion about ageing as he
is to his opinion. I can prove my opinion to be correct.
I refer the committee to question* 4968, which is
addressed to Mr. H. W. iSTinnes. The question reads —
Have you found that Australian leaf is improved by
ageing it?— The longer you keep Australian leaf the worse it
gets. It withers away to dust, as there is nothing in it to
hold it together.
That is the opinion of a man of 30 years’ experience
of handling Australian leaf. He says definitely that
ageing does not improve Australian tobacco at all.
6225. I know from my own experience that Mr.
Hinnes does not know what he is talking about, because
I have samples of tobacco from the Tamworth district
that I have had for eight years, and there is not a
crack of any kind in them. They are just as tough
and flexible as a glove?—l am referring to the aroma
of tobacco. I am entitled to my opinion just as Dr-
Cameron is entitled to his. But it would appear from
the evidence of Dr. Cameron that my opinion is worth-
less. Question 3880 reads—
Mr. Tregenna had been the tobacco expert in New South
Wales for fifteen years. Does it not indicate in that period
at least one State has not succeeded in advancing the prospects
of the industry? —He cannot have had the opinion during
the fifteen years. If he has, he is a dishonest man.
Even if Dr. Cameron disagrees with me, he has no
right to use the word “ dishonest ” in connexion with
myself and my work. I take strong exception to his
statement. My opinions are honest opinions. I am
entitled after fifteen years’ experience to express an
opinion on the quality of tobacco. Up to the last
year or two I have always been hopeful of getting a
good quality leaf of bright tobacco with practically no
aroma at all —perhaps a neutral tobacco. I cannot see
how it is possible to get such a leaf from the heavy
soils at Tamworth. I have been forced to that con
elusion by this long experience. All this time I have
been aiming to get the right aroma, and because. I
have not succeeded it is not fair to say I am dishonest.
Question 3888 reads—
And because it is now being tried out and has so far
proved to be a theory that will not hold water, is it not a
good thing for the industry —I have been very disappointed
that there has been no public announcement of such disproof.
I should like to ask where is this disproof? What
right has Dr. Cameron to say that there is disproof?
I have not seen it in the evidence anywhere.
6226. There is neither proof nor disproof?— Because
Dr. Cameron does not agree with me that is no reason
wffiy he has any right to say that there is disproof.
6227. The only proof that we have is largely an
expression of opinion by experts such as Mr, Temple
Smith, Dr. Cameron, Mr. Jennings, and Dr. Rivett.
They were all of the opinion that it was utterly im-


possible to say from tests made up to the present that
eucalyptus taint was a fundamental defect ?—But there
is no disproof. I have with me the original tobacco of
those experiments. There is none other in existence.
This package contains twelve tins, and it has been
sealed for two years. It is the original tobacco from
the Bathurst experiment. The tobacco is aged two
years, and I have not opened the tins. I suggest that
this committee should submit the samples to some one
who is a judge of tobacco.
6228. We shall hand over the sample to the Tobacco
Investigation Committee and ask it to report?—l sug-
gest that you gentlemen should smoke the tobacco
yourselves, or else send it to some manufacturer of
cigarettes, but not to the British-Australasian Tobacco
Company. This work entailed a lot of careful thought,
and much time and expense; it was done with the inten-
tion of finding out what was wrong with Australian
tobacco. It was an honest endeavour to get to the
bottom of the trouble with Australian tobacco. We
have an aroma which is unpopular. It is different
from the American aroma.
6229. We have had evidence to say that people who
smoke Australian tobacco like it?—A number of people
hold that opinion. There was no ulterior motive behind
this work. It was an honest endeavour to improve the
Australian tobacco to the standard of the American
tobacco. Our idea in starting these experiments was
to help the tobacco industry and not to damn it. In
your cross-examination of witnesses you have often
referred to the question of eucalyptus taint, and my
name has been largely mentioned as being responsible
for any suggestion of taint. After all, I was only one
of three who held that opinion as to the influence
of the eucalypts. It seems to me that there
has been an undercurrent of hostility to this
experiment. I can assure you that we were really out
to get to the bottom of the trouble with respect to the
aroma of Australian tobacco. It will be known to the
committee that the original tea plant was sent from
China to India; yet the Chinese aroma cannot be
obtained in India, and vice versa. If Indian tea could
be grown in Java that country -would not be producing
low-grade tea that it is at present. There is some
reason for the different aromas. The taste of potatoes,
butter and other commodities is not comparable—they
are not subjected to the act of combustion or volatiliza-
tion. All teas are much alike to look at and to smell.
The difference is only noticeable when they are infused
with boiling water. It is difficult to distinguish, by the
eye and the nose the differences between raw American
and Australian tobacco. The only way to determine
the aroma is to put a match to the tobacco. What
happens when one puts a match to the tobacco, no one
knows. The act of combustion alters the whole
aroma. It was for that reason that we worked on the
lines of the prevailing vegetation in Australia. We
had good reasons for working on the eucalypts, and
to pooh-pooh that theory is not fair to us. Naturally,
one would expect some persons to disagree with our
opinions, but nevertheless the fact is that we have
got certain results. Following on the experiments at
Bathurst we carried out experiments at Tamworth, and
the results that we have obtained so far are far-reach-
ing. It is quite likely that eventually we may be able
to produce tobacco similar to American tobacco; but
the existing aroma will need to be corrected.
6230. The only w r ay to finalize experiments is to sub-
mit definite data for testing ?—Unfortunately, those who
criticize our experiments have not smoked the tobacco
that has been grown from those experiments. They
have not had an opportunity to smoke it, and I now
give the committee that opportunity.
6231. It is apparent that the hostility that has
developed has been largely due to the broadcasting of
incomplete results, to the detriment of the Australian
tobacco industry generally. The newspaper cuttings
contained in the prospectus is an instance of that?—
I rather think that before that statement appeared in
the prospectus you had already on several occasions
referred to the eucalyptus taint in tobacco, the inference
being that there was disproof that such a thing existed.
6232. I have never been able to detect any eucalyp-
tus in any Australian tobacco. What I think was
wrong was to broadcast statements to the effect that
certain things had been proved by experiment?— That
was never broadcast by us. The mistake was that the
report on those experiments, around which this con-
troversy rages, has never been made public.
6233. I think that that report should have been
submitted to the committee previously?—l certainly
think so to. There is nothing in it that should not be
made known.
6234. What is the title of that report?—lt is a
“ Beport on an experiment in growing tobacco in Aus-
tralia at Bathurst in 1926-27 and 1927-28.” Had that
report been published, it would have saved a lot of con-
troversy. I have been asked to regard this report as
confidential. The Tobacco Investigation Committee
requested me a long time ago to regard it as con-
fidential. It also asked the British-Australasian
Tobacco Company not to publish it. There are about
twelve copies of this report in existence, and it has not
been furnished to the experts in the various States. I
suggest that the committee send a wire to the Tobacco
Investigation Committee asking for a copy of this
report. Even the printed report prepared by Dr.
Darnell-Smith in respect of his visit to America does
not contain all the facts. The printed copy is a precis
of the original report. References to the Australian
tobacco have been excised.
6235. Does Mr. Ross know that this secret report is
available?— Yes, but he does not know that the printed
report is not the full report.
6236. The full report was never published?— Ho. It
was printed and sent to all the States. Dr. Darnell-
Smith was sent to America to report on American
tobacco as compared with Australian tobacco, and cer-
tain of his references to Australian tobacco were
eliminated from the printed report. The full report
is the most valuable report on the industry that has ever
been written. I think that this committee should be in
possession of all the evidence that is available. I have
put all my cards on the table and others should do so.
It was I who made the committee aware of the fact
that it bad not received the original report from the
Imperial Institute.
6237. By Mr. Morgan. —What is the position as far
as North Queensland is concerned in respect of the
prevalence of eucalypts?—The eucalypts that grow in
the south of Australia do not grow in North Queens-
land. The phellandrene bearing eucalypts do not grow
in' North Queensland; and what is more, the eucalypts
that do grow there contain very little oil. The leaves
will not burn when they are green; but in the south
when a match is applied to the leaves they flare.
6238. Why did you not tell the committee of these
reports when you previously gave evidence ?—I thought
that they would be produced during the subsequent
evidence. One cannot be connected with the industry for
fifteen years without knowing something about tobacco.
I think of nothing else. I live in tobacco. My long
association with Mr. Gilmour, w r ho has been a buyer
for the company for 30 years, has enabled me to carry
out tests and to gain a thorough knowledge of tobacco.
6239. By Mr. Morgan. —The following extract is
taken from the printed report of Dr. Darnell-Smith:—
From the foregoing it will be seen that the tobacco plant
is raised in North Carolina, for the most part, in an atmos-
phere of great humidity, almost entirely free from wind.
Such conditions are productive of a soft, leafy growth. The


compost produced by the decay of fallen leaves of oaks and
pines is evidently not injurious to tobacco. It is to be
noted that land containing much humus or richness is not
favoured for tobacco-growing.
It is to be noted that land containing much humus and
richness is not favoured for tobacco-growing. That
theory implies that the humus, as the result of a com-
post of decaying leaves, does not affect the aroma ?—lt
does not give that tobacco a bad aroma.
6240. A compost of eucalyptus leaves does affect the
aroma of tobacco?— Yes. The following is a report of
the results of experiments carried out at Tam worth,
and they are part and parcel of the Bathurst experi-
ments :
Subject : lobacco Aroma and Paxatability Experiments
at Nemingiia, Tamworth, Season 1928-29.
It was decided to follow up the work previously carried
out on the Bathurst Farm at Tamworth. Twelve concrete-
lined pits were constructed, each being 10 feet x 6 feet x
2 feet deep. Eight plants of the variety Dunbur were planted
in each pit on the Bth December, 1928.
There wore six pits containing water-washed sand from the
Cockburn River, and considered practically free from any
organic matter, and six pits containing soil from the field
where tobacco is ordinarily grown. All pits were fertilized
with 3 per cent, nitrogen, 8 per cent, phosphoric acid, and
3 per cent, potash mixture, and 8 per cent, magnesium at
the rate of 1,000 lb. per acre.
Pit No.
1. Clean river sand to-which was added 1 lb. pine resin.
2. Clean river sand to which was added 1 lb. calletris
resin.
3. Clean river sand to which was added pinene, at the
water rate of 1 lb. to 10,000 lb.
4. Clean river sand to which was added 40 lb. cypress
pine bark.
■5. Clean river sand to which was added 40 lb. E.
Phlebophylla leaves.
0. Clean river sand check.
7. Soil to which was added 1 lb. pine resin.
8. Soil to which was added 1 lb. callitris resin.
9. Soil to which was added pinene, as above.
10. Soil to which was added 14 lb. absorbent clay.
11. Soil to which was added 14 lb. charcoal.
12. Soil check.
It was sought to ascertain whether the burning aroma and
palatability could be altered or improved by the addition of
the substances mentioned above.
The leaf after harvesting was all sent to the British-Aus-
tralasian Tobacco Company’s factory, and manufactured into
cigarettes without any preparation except water treatment.
The testing wars carried out under key letters, and the
judges did not know from which pit each lot of tobacco
originated. They placed the various lots as follows:
Pit No. 4—lst.—Cypress pine bark.
Pit No. 6—2nd. —Check.
Pit No. s—3rd.— E. Phlebophylla.
Pit No. I—4th. —Pine resin.
Pit No. 2—sth. —Callitris resin.
Pit No. 3—6th,‘—Pinene.
Pits Nos. 7-12 were all classed as objectionable, and showed
no appreciative improvement on the ordinary product.
One of the judges was unable to detect much difference in
the leaf from Pits Nos. 1 to G. The other judges, however,
found considerable differences.
Eucalyptus Phlebophylla was used in this experiment
because of its terpene content, as against the tests previously
carried out with E. Dives and E. Blakelyi, each of which have
an eucalyptus oil content, and which, on both occasions, when
fresh leaves were added to the soil, produced a tobacco
having an objectionable aroma. Fresh E. Phlebophylla leaves
did not give an objectionable aroma in this test.
In formulating the experiments, Cypress pine bark was
incorporated with the sand, because in America the country
on which pine trees have grown is regarded as one of the
most suitable for the production of the highest quality of
flue-cured tobacco. It will be noted that this pit produced
the tobacco judged to be best.
Included in the experiments carried out at Bathurst
(Season 1927-28) was one in winch phellandrene oil in the
proportion of 1 to 10,000 parts of water was applied to the
soil, and the result w T as reflected in the burning aroma,
which was objectionable. It was observed that in the Tam-
worth experiments, when pinene was similarly added to the
sand pit, a tobacco with a distinctly different aroma was
obtained which' was not objectionable.
These experiments clearly indicate that the palatability
and the aroma of tobacco on burning the leaf is distinctly
influenced by the organic matter in the soil. Some organic
matters improve the aroma, while some have a deleterious
effect. These results are of particular interest, since hitherto
it has been usual to regard soluble inorganic matter as the
sole food obtained and taken up by the plant. These experi-
ments appear to indicate that organic matter can be directly
taken up by the plant from the soil, and in the case of tobacco
it influences markedly the burning aroma of the leaf.
The experiments with tobacco grown on sand which had
been fertilized and to which organic material had also been
added, show that differences can be obtained in the tobacco
when_ burnt, and a particular aroma results. Thus, the
addition of phellandrene oil resulted in an objectionable
aroma, and the addition of pinene resulted in a not un-
pleasant one, which was quite different from the former.
It is realized that much further work remains to be done,
but the experiments which have so far been carried out,
point most clearly to the fact that soil conditions and plant
food have a marked effect on the burning aroma and palata-
bility of tobacco on combustion.
It is thought that climatological conditions are more likely
to affect the texture of the leaf than the burning qualities
referred to above.
The products of these experiments are also available to
the select committee to test.
6241. Who were present when those experiments
were made?— The director of the cigarette factory,
Mr. Massie, was one of those present. He is a
cigarette expert, and controls the whole of the cigarette
output of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company
Limited in Sydney. Mr. Scarvell, an assistant in the
factory, Hr. Harnell-Smith, and Mr. Slagg were the
other judges-
. 6242. Those experiments were conducted with Cyprus
pine. Have you conducted any experiments with
acacias and banksias?—Ho, except that I carried out
experiments on the soil in the north coast of Hew South
Wales. The soil contained decomposed heather
and heath, and I obtained a totally different aroma
from any that I had obtained before in Australia.
6243. Ho you propose to conduct experiments with
wattle or banksias which are some of the dominating
f egetation in Australia ?—There has been so much
cold water thrown on these experiments that I am
sick of making them.
6244. By Mr. Bully, —How many judges were
present at these experiments?— Four judges. To start
Avith, the cigarettes Avere taken out in groups of four
haphazardly. Each judge placed the cigarettes in
order of merit, namely, Ist, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. The
Ist and 2nd of each group, consisting of eight cigarettes
altogether, were re-tested. That reduced the final
test to four cigarettes. Mr. Thompson M.P., held the
key of these tobaccoes, and until the key was disclosed
we did not know what the results were.
6245. By Mr. Morgan. —ls there much Cyprus pine
country in Australia ?—Yes; hut the trouble is that it
is in the dry areas where there are hot Avinds and
insufficient rains.
The witness withdrew.
The committee adjourned.
Authority: H. J. Green, Government Printer, Canberra.
