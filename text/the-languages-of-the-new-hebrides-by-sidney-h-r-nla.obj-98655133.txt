EXPLANATION.
This paper was published in Australia, and I had no
opportunity of examining Dr. Fraser’s additions until the
printing was completed. It is thus necessary to explain that
the notes referring to the Indian languages must be taken as
representing Dr. Fraser’s views, and not mine. I believe that
our present knowledge of the Oceanic languages is far too
imperfect for the formation of any theory as to their origin
or connection with other linguistic stocks. Their local
relationships must be studied first. My purpose in this and
in other vocabularies was to remedy as far as possible the want
of systematic arrangement of the languages. As stated on
p. 102, the presentation of facts and not of speculations was
the main object of the paper.

THE LANGUAGES OF THE NEW HEBRIDES.

I. Introduction.
The New Hebrides consist of about thirty inhabited and many
uninhabited islands in the south-western part of the Pacific Ocean,
and are situated between 14° 29' and 20° 4' S. latitude, and 166°
41' and 170° 21'E. longitude. The most southerly island, Aneit-
yum, is distant from Sydney, New South Wales, about fifteen
hundred miles, and from Auckland, New Zealand, about twelve
hundred miles.*
* For a general account of the productions of the New Hebrides, the
reader is referred to the following works :—“ The New Hebrides/ 5 by the
Rev. Robert Steel: London, 1880; “ Islands of Melanesia/ 5 by the Rev.
R. H. Codrington, in Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1889; “The Western
Pacific/ 5 by Walter Coote : London, 1883; “Missions in Western Poly-
nesia/ 5 by the Rev. A. W. Murray: London, 1863.


There is a considerable amount of variation in the languages of
the New Hebrides, and this corresponds to differences which
have been noted in the physical characteristics of the islanders.
All accounts, though these are very few, agree in describing the
natives of the southern islands of the group as darker in colour
and inferior in culture to those of the north. An examination of
the languages shows that the inhabitants must be regarded as
sprung from not one, but several sources. The languages of
Tanna and Eromanga, though agreeing in some instances with
those of the Central and Northern districts, contain much that is
different. This is especially seen in the long and complicated
verbal forms they have, and in various points of grammatical
detail. In the nouns, for example, we are told that the removal
of what in the northern tongues would be a separable particle,
will destroy the meaning of the word. In Tanna, nigi is ‘tree,’
and nigum is ‘fire.’ In Efate, these words appear as nekau and
nakahu ;in Malekula, nice , nokamhu . But na, ne , no are separ-
able, being forms of the article, leaving kau, ce (the Fiji kau,
Araga cai), and kahu, kamhu as the roots. But in Tannese, “if the
n be taken away, there would be no longer any sense in these
words, gi and gum”* Other points of divergence in the details
of grammar and vocabulary render the languages of Aneityum,
Tanna, and Eromanga distinct from those further north, while
they are equally distinct from the languages of the Loyalty Islands
and New Caledonia. Whether the southern languages of the New
Hebrides represent an archaic form of the primitive Melanesian
speech, or show traces of admixture with some other linguistic
stock, is a subject well worthy of investigation, but it is beyond
the scope of the present paper, which deals with facts rather than
with speculations.
The languages of the Central portion of the group—those of
Efate and the neighbouring islands—are much simpler in struc-
ture than those found north and south of them. Their vocabu-
laries contain a large number of Polynesian words, and in their
# Eev. W. Gray, in Macdonald’s u South Sea Languages,” p. 134.


general character these languages are very similar to those of the
Solomon Islands. The Epi and Malekula dialects, though locally
not far removed from those of Efate, contain notable differences,
especially in the verbal forms.
In Espiritu Santo, Whitsuntide Island, Lepers’ Island and
Aurora, the languages though distinct are not very dissimilar.
The Santo dialects, to some extent, form a connecting link between
these and the Efatese.
The language of Ambrym alone among those of the northern
islands is difficult to connect, but, as it is the least known of all,
many of its difficulties may disappear upon closer knowledge.
Polynesian languages are spoken on the islands of Futuna and
Aniwa in the south of the New Hebrides group, and at Mae or
Three Hills, Mele, and Fila in the Central district. Aniwa and
Futuna, though purely Polynesian in vocabulary, are strangely
different in grammar. Their complex and numerous forms, though
showing no community of origin, appear to be imitations of Tanna
expressions. The languages of Mae and Mele, are very nearly
pure Maori.
The following classification is founded upon the grammatical
structure of the languages and not upon the vocabulary alone,
though the latter has necessarily been considered in the distinction
of dialects. It will be advisable here to point out the leading
features of grammar in each part of the group, reserving details
for separate treatment.
1. Nouns: —All the languages agree in the distinction of nouns
by means of demonstrative particles which may be called articles.
In the Southern division, the article often coalesces with the noun,
and in Tanna it is said to be inseparable, without destroying the
meaning. With common nouns the article is some form of the
syllable na (ne, ni, in, no, nu, n). In the north, ais sometimes
found as an article used with common nouns. A personal article
i is also found in the north and south, but does not appear in Epi
and Efate.


Two classes of nouns are everywhere distinguished. One of
these is used with suffixed possessive pronouns, the other without.
The class taking suffixes is usually restricted to nouns denoting
parts of a whole, but includes much more in Espiritu Santo than
in the other islands. For the forms of the suffixed pronouns, see
the Vocabulary.
2. Pronouns :—These are all from the same roots, as are also
the words used as possessives. The forms found will be seen in
the Comparative Vocabulary.
3. Verbs :—Particles are used with common words which are
thus made verbs as to their grammatical form. The commonest
particle is, in all the languages (except Espiritu Santo and Efate),
some form of the syllable mo.
The future tense usually is clearly distinguished, but the past
and the present require definition by an adverb. Person and
number are defined by particles, which appear usually as abbrevi-
ated forms of the pronouns. The use of the particles in the
several languages may be summarized as follows :
a. Aneityum: —Distinct words for each tense, number, and person.
b. TannaandEromanga: —Combinations of pronominal forms with
particles expressing the condition of the action (in progress,
completed, continuous, customary, &c.).
c. Efate and Espiritu Santo: —Verbal particles appear to be simply
abbreviated pronouns and indicate only person and number.
Tense is shown by adverbs.
d. Epi: —Particles expressing person and number as in Efate, but
with prefix m (or modification of initial consonant), to mark
actual action (present or past), the verb without a particle
being future.
e. Malekula: —Variation of number made by change of vowel, the
tense sign being invariable. This is the verbal use in the
Solomon Islands.
/. Arag, Omba, Maewo; —Particles as in Tanna and Eromanga.
Also invariable particles denoting tense, used with pronouns.


g. Ambrym: —Same as in (f)
The singular present (or past) and future of the verb ‘to go,
will illustrate the use of the particles, which is here made the chief
basis of classification.

4. Prepositions ;—These are common in the Northern languages
and are often plainly seen to be nouns and verbs. They are very
few in number in the South, where their place is usually supplied
by verbal suffixes. These verbal suffixes are most extensively
used in Efate.
The following Table shows all the known languages and dialects
of the New Hebrides. To it I add a Comparative Vocabulary
with notes; for comparison the Vocabulary has corresponding
words from the nearest Melanesian and Polynesian tongues.
Throughout the Vocabulary, I have used the following Alphabet,
and have transcribed all the words into it.*
* [lt is a pity that so many different systems of phonology have been
used by the missionaries in writing the dialects of the New Hebrides.
But, as the Scriptures in part have now been printed in many of these
dialects, the evil is, I fear, past remedy. Hence, Mr. Ray’s labour here
in transcribing his examples according to a uniform system is a service
to philology.—J. F.]


Vowels: a, e, i, o, u, all as in Italian. Consonants: b, d,f h,
j, k, I, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, as in English.
c as English g in go dh as English th in the
g ~ ng ~ sing th ~ th ~ thin
gc „ ng ~ finger gm as a nasal m, nearly equal to mw.
The Melanesian q is written at length according to its sounds as
kw , pw , kpw, kmhw, gembw, &c. The Melanesian g, a guttural
trilled consonant, is written g‘. The nasal dis written nd; nasal
b, mb; zas English dz in adze. Diphthongs :aias in aisle; au
as English ou in house; ei as ain day.
This method of transcription is also applied to the Mota, Fiji,
Lifu, Samoan, and Maori words which are added for comparison.

Comparative Vocabulary of Thirty-three Dialects of the
New Hebrides, compiled by Sidney H. Ray.
[To Mr. Ray’s list I have added a few lines, numbered 39, 40,
41, 42, drawn from personal sources* which are not available in
London, but which may be useful to philologists in tracing the
connection of the Ebudanf dialects with others. These are ex-
amples of the : —(39) Taian dialect of Uvea (Loyalty Islands), the
Nengonese of (40) Mart Is. (Loyalty Islands), (41) the language of
New Britain Is., to the east of New Guinea, and (42) of Duke
of York Island, a small island which lies in the narrow strait
between New Britain and New Ireland; as an example of the
dialects spoken on the south coast of New Guinea, I add (43) the
Motu dialect of Port Moresby, the best known on that coast.
These examples I have written in Mr. Ray’s alphabet. In the
Taian dialect, most of the personal nouns are here given with the
suffix consonant of the third person, as kamew, ‘his father’; the o
is very broad, something like or in sound, and H is like eu; g is
only g hard in this dialect, and ng represents the nasal g; the in-
verted comma, as in ‘veto, marks a nasal sound. In Lifuan, eis a
subdued nasal, like the last sound in the French hi-en, and 6 is
nearly the German d. —J.F.]

flt is awkward to have to use New Hebrides as an adjective. I there-
fore substitute Ebudan and Ebudans formed from Ebudes, the classical
name for the old Hebrides. —J»F. j

IY. Notes on the Vocabularies.
In the languages of Aneityum, Tanna, and Eromanga, the words
in this Vocabulary are often given in the form in which they
appear in the lists of the missionaries, and the reader should keep
it in mind that an initial n or in represents a demonstrative, the
article, and a final n the possessive suffix, third person singular.
The relationship of many of the following words to those found
in Malaysia and other parts of Oceania is commented upon in the
work of the Rev. Dr. Codrington on “The Melanesian Languages.”
Reference is accordingly made to the pages of that work for fuller
evidence of the connection of the languages of the New Hebrides
with those of Oceania generally. What is intended in this list is
chiefly to show the relations of the New Hebrides dialects to one
another.
[As it may be of interest to some readers of this Journal to trace
the origin of the words used in these dialects, I have supplemented
Mr. Ray’s notes by some notes of my own, which are offered to
assist in determining the origin of the races in Oceania. Apart
from language, the traditions and history of these races give us no
sure evidence on that point. My notes are enclosed in square
brackets.—J.F.]
1. Sun —The word common is some form of alo. In muti-gar,
nipmi-nen, nihmi-umugkum, nimnim-ugkum, meti-ki-au, mare-gi-o,
meta-ni-alo, mera-i-ali, the first member of the compound is mata ,
the common word for ‘eye or face,’ and the expression is a parallel
one to the Malay mata-ari. The Aneityum thigo, Fiji siga are
forms of sina, a common Polynesian word for ‘shine,’ ‘white,’seen
also in the Sesake masina, ‘moon,’ Efate sin, ‘to burn splendidly’
as a great fire. The Marina maso is the usual New Hebrides
word for ‘star.’ Of. Mel. Lang. p. 93.
[Words for ‘sun’ come from roots meaning (1) ‘to shine,’ ‘to
burn’; cognate ideas are : —(2) ‘bright, clear, manifest’; (3) ‘red,
red-hot, scarlet, blood’; (4) ‘white, a sail, splendid, beautiful’; (5)
‘heat, passion, love’; (6) ‘sharp, acrid, sour,to cut.’


The simple roots which express these ideas are:— ka, by meta-
thesis ak; ha; da; di; and, by change of consonant, la , ra; by the
addition of formative syllables, chiefly suffixes, these roots produce
a great variety of words which are spread all over Oceania. All
these roots exist in Sanskrit and other Aryan languages ; thus :
ka: — Sk.* kam, f to burn,’ kdma, ‘love, desire,’ Gr. ka-io.
ak:— Sk. agni, ‘fire, Lat. ignis , ‘fire,’ acer , ‘sharp,’ oculus, ‘eye.’
ba:— Sk. hhd, ‘to shine,’ bhdlu, ‘sun,’ maha, ‘light,’ Lat. (b)uro y
‘burn.’
da: — Sk. ddha , ‘burning,’ Gr. daio , ‘burn,’ dais , ‘torch,’ daelos y
delos, ‘clear, manifest.’
Di:— Sk. dip, ‘to shine,’ div (dya), ‘day.’
EA: —This form has many representatives in Sanskrit, and as these
forms illustrate the process by which variations in the mean-
ing of the original root are acquired, several of them may be
given here; as :
Sk. rang, raja, ‘to colour, to glow’; rakta, ‘red, agitated by
passion, fond, pure, blood, vermilion, copper, saffron.’
rajata, ‘white, silver, gold, ivory, blood.’
rdj, ‘to shine’; rdga, ‘red colour, love, wrath, passion, envy.’
rdma , ‘beautiful, black, white’; ravana, ‘sharp, hot’; ravi
‘the sun.’
ruck, ‘to shine, to please, to desire, to like’; ruchita, ‘bright,,
sweet’; rukma, ‘clear, bright, gold’; ruch, ‘light, lightning,,
beauty, desire’; ruch-aka, ‘agreeable, sharp, a tooth, salt.’
rudhiro, ‘blood, saffron’; Gr. eruthros, ‘red.’
roka, ‘light’; rochana, ‘irradiating, splendid, sharpening’;
rocJiani, ‘red arsenic; the aether’; rochis, ‘light, flame.’
roshana, ‘angry,’ quicksilver, a touchstone’; rohita, ‘red’;
rohini, ‘blood.’
raudra, ‘irrascible, acute, heat’; rupya, ‘silver.’
Examples of most of these meanings are to be found in the
Oceanic languages.
* Abbreviations : — Dr. for Dravidian; Gr. Greek ; Lat. Latin; Sam ,
Samoan; Sk. Sanskrit; Tukiok is the native pronunciation of Duke of
York (island); A.-S. Anglo-Saxon; rt. root.


In the Dravidian languages of Southern India, the root ka is
represented by kay, ‘to burn’ (Telugu dialect, kd-lu, kd-gu, Tamil
kanyei), kdn, ‘to see,’ kan, ‘ the eye,’ kadu, ‘to be sharp, pungent,
fierce, swift, to be hot, to ache,’ kadi, ‘to bite,’ kavi, ‘red ochre,’
kaveri, ‘turmeric,’ chem, ke-n, ss, ‘to be hot,’ semhu, ‘red,’ ti, ‘fire,’
avd (for kava), ‘desire.’
Now, in Mr. Ray’s list of words for ‘sun’ and ‘daylight,’ the
most common is some form of alo, and the nearest approach to
that is the Dravidian kdlu, ‘to burn, to shine.’ The loss of an
initial k is no uncommon thing in Oceania, but the k still remains
in the Samoan l alo-‘alo, ‘ a sunbeam ’; it remains also in several
words used in the Indian Archipelago to mean ‘sun,’ as kaliha,
kluh, and kai, kila , gawak, ‘ daylight,’ kalap, chaleret, ‘ lightning.’
Even the negrito Samangs of Malacca say kael for ‘ sky,’ and Fiji
has kalo-kalo, ‘ a star.’ And l ula (kula), ‘ red,’ is another word in
Samoa which I trace to the Dr, kdlu, for metathesis is common
there. Brightness is the original idea in all these words.
In the list, la, ra is the common Polynesian word for ‘sun.’ It
is immaterial whether we take this from the root ka or the root
DA, for both changes of sound are legitimate; I prefer to take it
from ka, for that is the form which appears to have spread most
to the East, the k often changing into I. The connection of la,
‘sun,’ with words for ‘blood’ fq.v.) is manifest, and the reason
why is shown by the Sanskrit meanings under the root ra, as
above. But in Samoan, la also means a ‘ sail ’; here again you
may see the reason why in the Sk. rajata and rdma; the Sk. ruch
also, when written in Greek, is leukos, ‘white,’ and the Greek
lampros, ‘ bright,’ if written lamh-ara, might pass as a pure Oceanic
word. The Maori ko-ma, ‘whitish,’ and ko-maru, ‘sun,’ ‘sail’ (from
the root ba, ma) illustrate the Samoan double meaning of la.
From this root ma come other words for ‘ sun ’ in Mr. Ray’s list,
ma-so, ma-re, me-ri. In some parts of Oceania this root also means
‘to see’; whence the ma-ta, ‘eye,’ of our lists, and that corresponds
with the Dravidian kan, ‘eye,’ from the verb kdn, ‘to see,’ and the
root ka. Under this head also come ma, ‘ white’ fq.v.), masi (Fiji)


‘ native cloth ’ made from the ‘ white ’ fibre of the mulberry tree,,
the Samoan words masi-na, ‘ the moon,’ and masoa, ‘ arrowroot.’
The root da gives dhb, du, ndae, dan, drai, in our list, nnd di
gives di-na, di-ari, ne-thig, na-diat, with which compare the Latin
di-es, ‘day,’ sub di-o, ‘in the open air,’ di-vus, ‘a god,’ and the Sk.
dev a, ‘ a god,’ Byauspater, Lat. Jupiter. Compare also the Fijian
diva , dia, ‘to look.’ The gar of line 3 I take to be for liar, whence
the Malay min mata-ari, ‘the sun.’ This connection is supported
by the Motu gara-gara, ‘ hot,’ Efate, giri-giri, ‘ bright,’ Tukiok,
garo, ‘to desire earnestly,’ ( cf'. Sk. ruck, and Sam. alo-fa, ‘love’),
kwire, ‘to see, look,’ Maori, koro-tu, ‘ desirous,’ koro-pupu, ‘to boil/'
{cf. Malay, goring, ‘broil’), New Britain, karat, ‘to bite,’ kara-gap,
‘rage,’ Motu; koria, ‘to bite’ (cf. Dr, kadi, Sk. ruchaka). With
gar compare also the Ebudan words for ‘ red,’ No. 78, lines 23 - 25.
Consult also Curtius (“Greek Etymology”) on the roots ghar, hha,
Iharg, rag, arg, lamp, ‘to shine.’ The Sk. has ghr-ansas, ‘ heat of
of the sun,’ and the Keltic has gr-ian, ‘the sun.’
I now wish to show how widely the root ka has spread in
Oceania. Thus the Malay chaya is ‘bright, clear,’ and garam is
‘anger’; the Motu kaka-kaka is ‘scarlet,’ halaka is ‘scorch’; New
Britain has kolot, kan-kan, ‘anger,’ ka-ka, ‘bright red,’ ka-pa, ‘to-
shine’; Tukiok has kal-kalawap, ‘to burn,’ kup, ‘to blaze,’ kum-ala
‘to shine, and wa-kupi, ‘to light’; Maori has kan-apa , ‘bright’ and
the words with koro as given above. A longer form of ka-ka is
the Samoan ‘a‘asa (kakasa), ‘to be red hot,’ and to- l asd, a chief’s,
‘anger,’ from the same root ka. The Aneityumese, which delights
in dethroning an initial root-consonant so that the word may begin
with a vowel, says ef-ehcas (for kakas ), ‘bright, shining,’ ehli (for
kali), ‘to singe’; it also has aces, ‘to bite,’ acas, cas, ‘burning, hot,
pungent, sour,’ acas, ‘to burn,’ acen , ‘sour, angry.’ This acas, cas
or kasa (cf. Samoan ‘a‘asa) is the Fijian ngesa, ‘ to burn’ in cooking,
and seems to me to be the body of the word nagesega (line 1), ‘the
sun,’ as if ‘ the burning one,’ for it may be resolved into na-agese-ga
of which na and ga are formatives. Again, if, following the
analogy of the Sk. derivatives of raj (supra) and the meaning of


the English expression 1 brand new/ we take the Samoan kakasa in
the sense of ‘bright/ it brings us close to hakoso, ‘the sky ’ in the
ancient language of Java, and angkasa, ‘sky’ in the neighbouring
island of Bali.
The root ti also has a place in Oceania. In Maori, ti-aho and
ti-ti mean ‘to shine/ while tio-tio is ‘sharp’; in Samoan tio is
‘sharp,’ said of the eyes, ti-ga is ‘pain/ ti-ti 1 e is ‘to be angry,’ ‘ i l ila
(ki-kila) or i ila- i ila is ‘to shine, to glisten,’ said of the eyes; in
Fiji dhila is ‘to shine’; in Motu, kia-ma is ‘bright.’ The Malay
has kilu, gllang , ‘to shine,’ ngilu , ‘to ache’; the Pali of India has
tikkho, tino, ‘ sharp, acrid,’ and the Dravidian has tindu , ‘to kindle/
iidu, ‘to whet,’and ti, ‘fire.’ Another Oceanic form of ti is si,
whence the Samoan si-sila, ‘ to look, to see, to know,’ si-na, ‘white/
sisifo (as if sisi-ifo, ‘to look down’), ‘the west,’ si-sili, said of ‘shoot-
ing pains.’ From the same root come the Fijian siga-sigau, ‘white,’
the Fijian name for ‘ sun,’ mata-ni-siga, and the Malay sigi, ‘torch.’
Still another root form is se, but this corresponds more with the
Dr. s'e , ‘to be red’ where the s', as in Sanskrit s'ona, ‘to be red,
represents an original k. From s'e the Samoan has se-ga, ‘ the
crimson parroquet,’ se-gi, ‘to burn a scar,’ sega-vale, ‘to shine dimly’
(said of the sun), sega-sega, ‘ yellowish ’ (cf. Sk. rudhira, ‘saffron’),
sege-segi, ‘twilight/ se-sega, ‘to dazzle.’ The Dr. se-mlu is ‘red’
and the Malay se-rah is ‘ red.’ At Baki (New Hebrides) se-mbi is
‘fire.’ From the same monosyllabic roots as above come many
Oceanic words for ‘fire,’ ‘smoke,’ ‘eye’ (qq.v .), as ka-p, ka-pi, ka-bu,
ma-ta , la-hi, and, dropping the k, afi, ahu, asu; also words for
* burn,’ ‘ ashes/ ‘ oven/ and the like. In Aneityum, cap, cop is
■‘hot, red, beloved; cf. Sam. ‘alofa, ‘love.’
I have thus examined at considerable length the words in Mr.
Hay’s first column, for the purpose of showing how intimate is the
connection between the Oceanic languages and root-words which
may be found in India; for my belief is that the races of Oceania,
both black and brown, came thither from their original homes in
India. The ancient literature of the Javanese shows that Kalinga
•of the Madras coast (Dravidian) was well known to them, and that


they had intercourse with the people of that country. Similar
results could be obtained by a careful survey of the words in other
columns of these lists; but the labour would be a long one and
this is not the place for it. In the rest of these notes I shall
merely indicate the direction in which inquiries might be carried
to ascertain the sources from which the words have come.]
2. Daylight —The proper word is ran, maran. In Malekula, it
it is combined with uta, ‘place,’ so that uta-n-rien, ute-rin is ‘place-
light,’ just as in Motu (New Guinea), hanua-boi, ‘land-dark,’ is
night. The word ran is seen in the Efate ran melu, ‘daylight
shadowed,’ ‘evening.’
[For ra-n see ‘blood,’ and my notes on No. 1. La, ra in Poly-
nesian is ‘sun,’ ra-ngi, la-ngi is ‘sky,’ In New Britain rag is
‘scorch,’ and ro, ran is ‘dazzle.’]
3. Moon —The widely spread Oceanic word vula is found in the
Northern languages and in Ambrym. A common word for ‘star,’
vitu, which is hetuch, ‘sun,’ in Dayak, is ‘moon’ in Malo and
Tangoa. The Eromangan itais, iriis is probably the same word.
The Tasiko variu suggests that in ku-bario, Bieri ka-mbatiau,
Aulua a-mbisia and (by regular change of k to s) the Baki si-
mberio, we have vitiu with a prefix, which is found in Kwamera
with the word for ‘star.’ In the three Southern languages mohoc,
mokwa, mauug may be the mag l ag l a of Torres and Banks’ Islands.
Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 82.
[For vula see ‘white,’ line 35. In Samoa pu-pula is ‘shine.’ In
Duke of York Island pua is ‘sun, moon, lamp.’ The Sanskrit root
is bhd, ‘to shine.’ With mohoc compare (Ambrym) moho, ‘star,’
(Sesake) masoe, ‘star,’ Samoan ma, ‘clear, pure,’ Epi ma, ‘see,’
New Britain bo-bo , ‘see.’]
4. Star —Some form of masoe is the usual word in the Southern
and Central languages. Vitu is found in the North, in Tasiko
erue, and, with adjective sarasara, in Malo and Tongoa. Cf. Mel.
Lang. p. 92.
[The same root word in different languages may mean ‘sun,’
‘moon,’ ‘star,’ the idea common to all being ‘shine’; words for


‘lightning’ also come from such a root, Fa-tu is the original form,
from root bhd, ‘to shine’; from fa-tu come fetu and vitu, with which
compare Malay bintang , ‘star,’ the body of that word being lita.\
5. Stone —-The Polynesian fatu is seen everywhere, except in
Tanna, where, however, kahil (properly ‘ limestone ’) seems to be
New Britain bil, a verb, ‘to cast stones,’ with an instrumental
prefix ka. The same prefix is seen in the Tanna ka ‘kil, ‘ a digging
stick,’ from il ‘to dig.’ This prefix, as ga, is common in the Banks’
Islands. [See notes on ‘bone,’ No. 70.]
6. Night: 7. Darkness —-The common word is bog in various
forms. This word also means ‘black,’ in Aneityum Ojpig, Tanna
dialect arabug. In Tanna nxipug is a ‘cave.’ In the Malekulan uta-
meligco, uta mi bug, uta is the Malay utan, common in Melanesia
for ‘land, bush, etc.,’ (see words for daylight). The Efate and
Malekula meligko is in Baki meliju, ‘cloud.’ Malo dodo, Omba
ndondo is also ‘cloud,’ and in Florida (Solomon Is.) rorodo, ‘blind.’
Of. Mel. Lang. p. 85.
\Bog should be ‘day’—from Sk. rt. bhd, ‘to shine,’ Dr. pag- al,
‘day’—but bug, ‘night,’ from Sk. rt. mu, ‘to bind,’ hence ‘to
cover, to close,’ as in Maori puni, ‘to cover,’ Malay buni, ‘to con-
ceal’; cf. “surely the darkness shall cover me.”]
8. Wind —The Polynesian matagi is found in the three Southern
languages. All others have a form of lagi which in Polynesia is
‘sky.’
[The rt. idea in ‘sky’ here is ‘brightness,’ from da, ma, as in
No. 1 ; da-gi gives ta-gi, la-gi. Ma-tagi, ‘wind,’ probably equals
‘from sky.’ But three Pali words mean both ‘air’ and ‘sky.’]
9. Sky —The Malo, Tangoa tug 1 a, tuka is the Mota tuka, properly
meaning the ‘firmament.’ Aulua mao is Omba mawe, Baki mabi,
‘above,’ Duke of York Is., maua.
10. Rain —A form of usa is common. The Maewo reu is ‘water’
in Malo and Nogogu. Eromanga bip may be the Lamangkau verb
‘to rain,’ in na ue i bop, ‘it is raining,’ the rain falls. Cf. Mel.
Lang. p. 86.


11. Water —The common word is wai. Reu, ran, ra are the
Maewo reu, ‘rain,’ and probably also the Santa Cruz luwe. Of.
Mel. Lang. p. 97.
[Sk, rts. are ap, am, ma, and su; cf. Hebrew ma(i), mo, ‘water/
Indian pa-ni, ‘water/ su-mas, ‘milk/ ‘water/ Samoan sua, ‘juice/
‘liquid.’]
12. Sea —The usual word is tasi or tahi. Pangkumu aror is
the sea breaking on the beach,‘waves’; in Ponape (Caroline Islands),
oror is ‘the shore,’ the water’s edge. Omba wa-wa is ‘ the open sea.’
Maewo lama is local in the Banks’ Is., but as laman it is found
also at Nusa on the Northern extremity of New Ireland. Marina
g‘etja is Lifu cedha. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 89.
[‘Sea, salt, bitter, sharp ’ are cognate ideas, and ‘sharp’ is cog-
nate to ‘shine, ‘burn’; hence Aneityumese acen is ‘salt’ and acas
is ‘burn’; so tasi, ‘sea/ may come from rt. da, ha, as in Note 1.
The Sk. has tad, ‘to shine/ tij, ‘to be sharp,’ tikta, ‘bitter.’ Cf.
Gr. tha-l-assa, Lat. ma-re, sa-ld\
13. Land —All except the Southern tongues have some form of
vanua. In Tasiko huru-anua, hum is ‘mass/ ‘lump.’ The Male-
kula batic-venua, hatin-venua, which is also in Malo, is properly
‘the country belonging to a chief.’ Tanna tano is the common
word for ‘ground.’
[Eanua probably for fau-na; a Sk. rt. is hhH (bhav), ‘to be/
whence bhumis, ‘earth,’ and Gothic bau-an, ‘to dwell’; cf. Sam.
mau, ‘to dwell.’]
14. Earth, soil —The common word is tano. Tanna nafa-tani
is probably ‘earth-dust’; afu being the Fiji kuvu, ‘dust/ Efate
afu-afu ‘to be dusty.’ In the Weasisi district there is a continual
rain of black volcanic dust. The Aneityum noboh-tan is apparently
the same word, tan being ‘red earth.’ Nogogu lepa is in Efate
‘clay.’ Futuna, Aniwa, Fiji and Samoa kele, here, gcele, etc., is
‘earth,’ ‘dirt.’ Wulua ono, Maori oneone, is very common in
Melanesia for ‘sand, beach.’
15. Fire —The word kabu is in general use, except in the north,
where afi, which is also Polynesian, takes its place. The Fiji wagca
J—July 5, 1893.


in mbuka-wagca (Ura vag in nampe-vag) is ‘burning.’ ‘The fire
burns’ is in Efate nakahu i faga , in Pangkumu nokambu pagpag ,
Baki sembi-bo vago. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 67. [See Note I.]
16. Smoke —The usual word is asu, with or without the word
for fire. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 90. [See Note I.]
17. Shade —The list is very imperfect, but some form of main
is distributed over the whole region. In Epi fo-melu, va-melu are
verbs ‘to shade’; fo and va are the causative particles.
[The rt. idea of most is ‘ soft ’ (Tukiok malu-a, Efate mul-mul),
that is, away from the burning rays of the sun. Others are
‘leafy, shady.’]
18. Pig The original word was no doubt poe. Puaka, puka
are probable introductions from Polynesia. The Efate, etc., wagco ,
wok may be forms of puaka , since pu or pw is there interchange-
able with w. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 86.
[The rt. idea is ‘fat’; a Sk. rt. is pa, pi-van , ‘fat.’]
19. Dog The origin of the common word kuri is obscure. It
is probably of recent introduction in many of the islands, certainly
so in Tanna, Eromanga, and Aneityum. In Mota the word kurut ,
says Dr. Codrington, was in the language when first known to
white men, though the islanders had no dogs.
[ln the Dravidian of India kudi is ‘to leap, to run,’ and kuderei
is a ‘horse’; the dog and the horse are ‘leapers’; they leap in
running.]
20. Rat —The word kusuwe appears in many forms as hasup,
goba, kaue, souo, kahau, asuk, cetho , adhi. Carivi is found only
in Santo, Omba, Arag and Mae wo. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 86.
21. Bird —The word manu , which is in general use, is in a few
cases used indefinitely of any animal. In Malo and Tangoa, man-
si-auau, nazi-abuabu is ‘flying animal’; cf. Efate kuvanguva , ‘to
fly.’ Tangoa ‘ fish ’ is nazi-ki-tas, ‘ animal of the sea.’ Eralado
karai is applied in Malekula to the ‘flying fox,’ and, in Aulua,
the same word care is a ‘butterfly.’ Cf. Mel. Lang, p, 56.


[Manu ‘an animal’ (hence the addition ni dran, line 39);
the Indian root is hht 2, ‘to be,’ bhav-ati, ‘to exist,’ Pali pani,
'a creature.’]
22. Fowl —The common term is toa. Of the three Southern
languages Aneityum and Eromanga alone ha \ejaa, tuo , = toa; the
others have the general term manu , ‘bird.’ Of. Mel. Lang. p. 70.
23. Snake —The word mata is very common, with variations to
gmata and gala.
24. Fish —The distinctive word is ika. The Marina natj is the
Tangoa nazi, and since n in those languages represents a common
m, these are the Malo mansi, Maewo masi, Nogogu mats, and all
are probably forms of manu; see notes on ‘bird.’ The three
Southern languages have numu or namu. Of. Mel. Lang. p. 68.
[New Guinea dialects show the rt. ma (‘water’?), as ma‘a, wa-
pi, ma-gatn; Admiralty Is., uka (for v-uka ?), ‘fish,’ thence ika. An
Australian dialect has makoro, ‘fish,’ and Sk. has makaras, ‘a sea
animal,’ matsga, ‘fish’; cf. mansi , nazi; and nazi-ki-tas in No. 21.]
25. Shark —An imperfect list shows bako, bekeu, bace, bacio,
pciv as forms of Mota pag'oa. Biauo, pia, bi, bai, pauwun may
possibly be the same word.
26. Fig —All the words found are forms of logo. The Tanna
bas a prefix ki which is also seen in the names for ‘mosquito’ and
'louse.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 69.
27. Mosquito —The common term is namu , The Tangoa moke,
Malo mohe, is possible a general term for ‘insect.’ In Aneityum
moke-moke is a ‘butterfly.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 83, [Rt. mu is ‘buzz.’]
28. Butterfly —A form of bebe is found in the Northern and
Central regions. In Malekula ceri, care are also applied to the
'flying-fox.’ In ceri-kakas. kakas is the adjective ‘little.’ Cf.
Mel. Lang. p. 62.
29. Louse— All the languages have the word kutu, with little
variation. In Baki k becomes sby a change which is there com-
mon. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 81.


[ln the Pali of India khuddo means ‘small.’ South Australian
aborigines say kutta, ‘louse.’]
30. Tree —The common term is Tcau or icai. In Baki bur-iesi,
hur is a prefix meaning ‘ body, mass,’ and is seen also in buru-jo,
‘neck,’ buru-suku, ‘mountain.’ The Epi prefixes la,je , Polynesian
la, ra; Ambrym li has a similar meaning. Another prefix is the
Utaha leu, Malo wu. Cf. Mel. Tang. p. 95.
31. Leaf —The Northern and Central tongues have rau, of
which the Aneityum ri, Maewo ndoui, Mota naui are extreme
forms. The Nguna ulu, Efate uli are properly used of blades of
grass, or as a verb ‘to grow, sprout,’and are the words commonly
used elsewhere for ‘ hair.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 89.
[One Australian tribe uses the same word for ‘hair and grass’;
cf. also the Latin coma.]
32. Root— Aneityum, Tanna, Efate and the Northern languages
have Jcoa in various forms, which may be Mota g‘ariu, Malay akar y
etc. Baki mbati is in Fiji and Nguna ‘tooth,’ the original meaning
being ‘spike.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 88.
33. Fruit —The word vua or wa is the usual term. Malo vira
is ‘flower,’ the Tangoa hira, Nogogu vira, etc. Malo has also wa-
i-ca, ‘fruit of tree.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 71.
34. Gocoanut —The word niu is very widely spread throughout
Oceania. The Aulua leula, Nogogu kolo, Ambrym ol suggest the
name of the island Malekula, ‘the place of cocoanuts.’ Malo in
Nguna is ‘ place,’ and male in Florida of the Solomon Islands has
the same meaning. It is a common custom to name places from
their productions, e.g., Aniwa is ‘full of cocoanut’. I anna and
Futuna are called respectively in Aneityum, Inpece ran ma, ‘land
of breadfruit,’ and Inpece ran has, ‘land of badness. (See also
Codringfon, Mel. Lang. p. 252). The words matua, metui, metu,
maru may probably be the cocoanut when ripe. Cf. the Polyne-
sian matua, ‘ripe, mature, full-grown.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 64.
35. Banana —There being several species of bananas with dis-
tinct names, it is by no means certain that the words given all


represent the same thing. The word vetal , noted by Dr. Codrington
as local in the Banks’ Islands, is here found in Savan, Santo, and
Malo. The Sesake andi, Mae wo undi, is the Fiji vundi, the com-
mon word in the Solomon Islands, and found also in Malay. The
Epi harahi, paravi is nearly the same word as that for breadfruit.
Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 54. [For Sam .futi, ‘banana,’ see ‘white,! No. 79.]
36. Breadfruit —Central and Northern languages have patau,
the Southern have mar. The Savan and Malo haico is nearly the
Epi and Malekula hiako, hiagk, ‘taro.’
37. Yam —The Northern languages have dam in various forms.
The Efate and Epi ui, Sesake wui are no doubt the Polynesian uji.
38, Taro —The common Epi and Malekula words are forms of
huagk or hiako, to which the Malo haico, ‘breadfruit,’ may perhaps
be also referred. The Malo and Santo hueta, and similar words
in Omba and Mota, are connected with words for breadfruit, hitau,
hatau , by the Ambrym peta. The Southern languages have the
Polynesian taro.
39. Sugarcane — Tovu, tou, to is the common word, except in
the Efate dialects, where porai is found with the meaning of
‘sweet.’ In Fiji vuravura are the shoots of the sugarcane or of
any kind of reed.
40. Mouse —The common word is ruma, with which is found in
Ambrym and Omba kale and vale, the Polynesian fale, fare. The
Sesake kopu is ‘inside,’ in Maori kopu, ‘belly.’ Malo vanua,
Nogogu venua is a ‘dwelling place’; the Baki vonua. [See ‘land,’
No. 13.] Of. Mel. Lang. p. 77.
[lndian rts. are gam, fal, ‘to cover ’; gam, travelling to the
West, produced Lat. dom-us, ‘a house,’ to the East, lum-a, ‘house.’]
41. Road —A representative of the common word sola is found
in the Centre and North of the group. Bua appears to be local
in the Efate district. In Epi and Omba mira, mara or mata, also
in Mota mate-sola, is the ‘eye’ or surface of the ‘path,’ and is the
word common for ‘eye’ or face. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 87.


42. Bow; 43. Arrow —The words for Bow, Arrow and Shoot
cross one another. Fana, used for ‘bow’ in the three Southern
languages, is ‘arrow’ in Tangoa and Lifu, ‘bow and arrow’ in
Nogogu; ‘shoot’ in Pangkumu is pen, Aulua hinea , Maewo vene,
Malo vini. In the Efate dialects fana does not appear, but tali-
faga is ‘bowstring.’ In Aneityum inceen-nefana, ‘the stock or
tree of shooters’ is bow and arrows, nithjan-ne-fana, ‘point of
shooters’ is arrow. Samoan du-fana , ‘bow,’ is of similar construc-
tion, from ‘ au, ‘ tree.’ Some form of vusu is used in the Northern
languages and Malekula for ‘bow’ and is possibly the same as the
wusu, usu, us, tvu, used for ‘arrow’ in Nogogu and Efate. In the
latter language and in Samoa, usu, u is a ‘reed,’ as is also the Ero-
mangan, Fiji, Aniwa and Mele gasau. The Efate tipwa is in
Banks’ Island and in New Guinea (Motu) dipa, a verb ‘to shoot.’
The Tangoa and Malo balca is the bag'e, etc., of Florida and Isabel
in the Solomon Islands. Omba and Arag liwai, lio is the common
word liwo, ‘tooth,’ used in a general sense for ‘spike.’ Cf. Mel.
Bang. p. 61.]
44, Spear —The word sare, found in Mota, Arag, Omba, Santo
and Malekula, is properly ‘pierce.’ As, which is ‘stab’ in Mota>
may explain metas, mataso. Mat may be ‘point.’ Cf. Mel. Lang.
p. 91.
45. Club The Efate mbat is probably the Maori word patu ,
Mota Jcpwaf, and really means ‘knob’; cf. words for ‘head.’ Nguna
tiko is Marina tig‘o. Otherwise there is little agreement.
46. Boat —Some form of vaka, ‘a boat ’ built up with planks, is
very common, except in the South, where canoes are merely
hollowed out logs. Here the words can, gau are those common
for ‘tree.’ The Efate rarua is a local term, but may possibly be
connected with the Fiji rara, ‘a board,’ deck of a canoe. The
Futuna boruku is probably Samoan folau, ‘ship, voyage, Efate
borau, ‘one carried on a ship,’ the New Britain parau, ‘a ship,’
Malay prau. In Efate, ibarau is now applied to any mode of loco-
motion by horse, ship or carriage. The Marina ovo is probably in
mistake for ‘paddle.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 59. The Ambrym bulbul
may be the Mota welewele, ‘a'dug-out.’


47. Paddle —The Aneityum and Tanna hev , vea may be the
common tvose which appears as base, vose, vos, vcho, oho. The Baki
verb helm, ‘to paddle,’ Efate halm explain the Marina lua, Tasiko
velua.
48. Outrigger —An imperfect list shows the word sama very
widely distributed.
49. Basket —The Fiji and Polynesian kato appears as cat,gouta,
cete in Aneityum, Malekula and Malo. The tag of Tangoa and
Arag, the Efate toga , the taga of Mota and Samoa, the Loyalty
Islands teq, is a widely spread word for ‘a woven or plaited basket
or bag.’
50. Food —A common word is sinaca, hinag l a or vinaga. Tangoa
kani-kani, Lifu g l en, is the common verb ‘to eat,’ which may also
be in Tasiko vevana, Bieri va-gana , Aulua va-gan, Kwamera ve-
genien, with causative particle va. In Nguna va-gani is a verb
‘ to make eat,’ ‘ to feed.’
[A Sk. rb. ad (by metathesis to) is ‘ to eat,’ Lat. ed-o ; ta gives
ka, whence many Oceanic words for ‘eat’ (q.v.) and ‘food.’]
51. Father —The common noun is tama , almost without excep-
tion. The vocative, used only in addressing is tata, rarely mama.
Of. Mel. Lang. p. 66.
52. Man —The word ta is very generally used, mostly in com-
position. Malekula haris is ‘person,’ male or female. Of. Mel.
Lang. p. 81.
53. Male —The word denoting male is no doubt mane, usually
combined with ta.
[‘Father, man, male’—all from rt. ta, ‘male’; hence Samoan
ta-ma is either ‘father’ or ‘boy’; the Polynesian ta-ga-ta ( ka-na-ka)
is ‘men’ in general. ‘ Male,’ ‘female’ are often expressed by their
physical peculiarities, as trahman, line 36.]
54. Husband —The Epi hoa, koa, oa is explained by the Maori
ho a, ‘a companion,’ and is applied to both husband and wife. In
origin and use, the Mota soa in ra-suai, Lifu foe, Futuna and Aniwa


wa, ua are the same. The Efate wota is also ‘chief,’ perhaps the
Fiji wati.
[ Atmeh-gan is from ta-ma, by metathesis common in Aneityum.
For soa, ‘companion,’ cf Sk. sama, ‘together.’ Ta-ne is from ta,
(see ‘male’), our mode of address to ‘father’ as ‘the man.’]
55. Child —The common word is natu. Tasiko sisi, Nguna riri/ci,
the Aniwa riki, Mae titi, Maori iti (in ka-ririki, tu-riki, tama-iti )
are adjectives ‘little,’ ta being man, and tama the relationship
between father and child—a word also used for ‘father.’ Cf. Mel.
Lang. p. 63.
56. Mother —There is apparently no common term. The words
tete, tiai, nina, nana, mama, inde are vocatives. Tina, ina, which
are in Solomon Islands and New Guinea, appear in Aneityum,
Tanna, Malo and Santo, and with the Efate hwile, etc., may be
connected with words for ‘ belly, bowels.’ The plural prefix ra
(upon which see Dr. Codrington, Mel. Lang. p. 83), appears in
Aneityum, Tanna, Erakor, and Arag. Weasisi iti is also in Efate.*
Of. Mel. Lang. p. 83.
\Tina, sina are from ‘ belly (q.v.), womb’; cf. Maori tia, ‘abdo-
men,’ Tasmanian tiana, ‘faeces.’ Ve-ve, mo-ma, and the fe-, va- of
the next column, ’are the same as in Lat. ma-ter, ‘the producer’;
the Sk. rt. is bhtl (bhav), ‘to be, to come into being, to exist.’
Matua-wahine is ‘grown woman.’]
57. Woman, Female —The common Oceanic word vavine or fine
is found in the North and in Epi. Tangoa g'arai is Efate goroi.
Pangkumu navseven is Eromanga nasiven. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 98.
58. Wife —This word is frequently the same as that for husband
(see note on 54). In other cases it is the word for ‘woman.’
Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 89.
59. Chief— The words are usually distinct. The Tangoa supe,
Tasiko supwe, is Nguna supwe, a word used in translations for ‘God.’
The same word is in Banks’ Island sukpwe, as the name of a club
* In one of the Efate dialects eri is ‘mother’—Macdonald, “ Oceania,”
p. 126.


or society which has a house in every village. To rise to a high
position in this society requires a great deal of influence and
expense, and, according to native ideas, some supernatural power.
The members of the ‘Sukpwe’ exercise considerable control over
affairs; hence the use of the word as equivalent to ‘ chief.’ In
Maewo, Sukpwe-matm is a being who spoilt things when Tagar,
the legendary maker of various articles was doing them aright.
In Arag andOmba the same opposing nature is ascribed to Sukpwe.*
The Ornba ra-tahiqi is ‘mother,’ in Arag ra-fasiu, is ‘brothers,’
and in Mota tasi is a common word for ‘brother.’ The Efate,
Nguna wota, wot may be connected with the Mota verb wot, ‘to be
prominent.
[Several of these words mean ‘first, before,’ as ariki ( = Sam
ali‘i) and lu -luai.~\
60. Head —The usual word is some form of kpwatu or hatu ,
literally meaning a ‘knob ’ (see No. 45), and the Kwamera kwa is
no doubt the same word ; Weasisi kaba is also ‘knob.’ Cf. Med.
Lang. p. 76.
[Some of these words come from met, ‘ a beginning,’ ‘ top or end’
{cf. the meaning of Hebrew rosh); l ulu may be a corruption from
Sk. kapala, ‘ head,’]
61. Eye —The word mata is seen everywhere. In Aneityum
nesgan-imtan, nesgan is said to be the essence, the most important
part, ie. the pupil. The Weasisi nuqan may be of similar mean-
ing to nesgan.
f I take nesganimtan to be n-sega-ni-mata, ‘ the sheen of the eye’;
;ee Note I.]
62. Ear —In various forms t align is the common word. In the
Northern languages kpwero,horo,pero and allied words are properly
applied to the tip of the ear. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 66.
[The Dr. rt. kel means ‘to hear,’ hence Oceanic tal-iga, ‘ear’; in
Polynesian, poro means ‘to end,’ ‘to be finished.’]
# Codrington, " Religious Beliefs in Melanesia ” —Journ. Anth. Inst.
Yol. x., p. 287, 292.


63. Tooth —The word liwo is found as livo, libu, lowo, ribo,juvo y
jua, elfo, reve. The same has already been noticed in Arag and
Omba as ‘arrow.’ In Efate, Santo, and Fiji pati is also ‘ spike/
Udu and uju of Malo and Santo are udu, ‘nose,’ in New Guinea
(Motu), and may probably be referred to the common gusu, ‘nose.’’
Of. Mel. Lang. p. 94.
64. Nose —The three Southern Languages have different words.
Ousu or qisu is the only word at all common elsewhere. In Fiji,
gusu is ‘mouth’; gusu is in Mota, ‘lip.’ Of. Mel. Lang. p. 85. The
Malo bona is probably ‘his smeller,’ bo being a common word for
‘smell’ and na the suffixed possessive pronoun. Omba gcmbwanogH
is ‘nostril.’
65, Tongue —The Northern languages have mea or, reduplicated,
meme, the others mena. The Baki prefix burn is ‘lump.’ A
similar meaning may attach to other prefixes. The Eromanga lua,
Maewo lue, Aulua le may be compared with Efate and Mota
adverbs lua, lue, ‘out.’ Of. Mel. Lang. p. 94.
66. Belly —There is little agreement in the words for ‘belly,’’
though Malekula tamba, damba, which is probably the Mota word
toJcpwe, is found in three of the Northern languages. The word
tina, ‘bowels’ is however in very general use. The Fiji kete is ‘bag,’
i.e., ‘stomach/ Maori kopu is used in Sesake for ‘inside of house.’
Efate mbwele is perhaps Duke of York Island (New Britain) bala,
Santa Cruz bole. It is worth notice that tina and pwile {i.e., bele)
are also used for ‘mother.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 55.
67. Band —Lima is the usual Oceanic word. In Tanna raga
and Aneityum ikma are probably the extreme forms. The Male-
kula ver,fera, vari, Ambrym vera, are the Mota ta-verai, ‘ the palm
of the hand.’ Eromanga kobe, Marina g'ave, is probably the ‘hand’
stretched out. In Mota g l ave is a kind of crab, Nogogu have
‘wing,’ Efate man kabe, ‘pigeon,’ winged animal. Cf. Mel. Lang.
p. 73.
[‘Finger’ is from Ger .fangen, ‘to seize hold,’ and hand I take
from A.-S. hadd, ‘to hold’; a Sk. rt. gam, gab, is ‘to hold,’ usually


hardened into grabh; we speak of a grasp of the hand ’; the French
say ‘ server la main.’ In Old Assyrian khams-a, kham-iltu is ‘five/
and there khams is the root gam. In Java, limo and gangsal,.
‘five,’ both come from the root gam, just as (Eromanga) no-&o6-en
and (Santo) lima- na, (Marina) g‘av-e, all come from the rt. gam r
gah.\
68. Foot, Leg —Little agreement appears in the words given,
and there is probably some confusion between ‘leg’ and ‘foot/
The Aueityum ethuo, Kwamera esu appears in the Efate dialects
as tuo, tu, tua, which is Lifu cha, as the latter language substitutes
a palatal for a more common dental. ( Cf. father, die, stand, one.)
The Weasisi el'ki may be the Omba g l arug l i, the Malo karu.
Tangoa halo, Marina para, is the Arag kpwalagH, g‘i being in Arag
and Omba a noun terminal. The Lamangkau mhulu suggests
that the Efate, Sesake mwele may be the same as halo. In Livara,
na mweli na rugku is ‘my hand,’ na mweli na tuagku , ‘my foot,’
use which suggests comparison with the Efate, Nguna pwele, etc.,
‘belly,’ and refers to the bulge. The Eromangan nowon is more
exactly ‘calf,’ Aneityum nohwanalek an nethuon, ‘calf of the leg.’
Maewo rogo is Mota raqoi. In the neighbourhood of Epi, various
forms of la are found. In Aneityum and Pangkumu, the word for
‘foot’ is the same as that for ‘bone.’
69. 8100d —All the words may be regarded as forms of the
common root ra, except the Nogogu megavina. Cf. Mel.Lang. p. 58.
[See Note No. 2.]
70. Bone —There is no agreement among the Southern lan-
guages. The Northern have suri. The Efate vatu is ‘stone/'
Sesake vatu ni ta, ‘stone of man.’ In Epi and Malekula, chwuri,.
hur, hoi are forms of the prefix hum (See Tongue). Cf. Mel. Lang.
p. 60.
[The original meaning of fatu is ‘strong,’ ‘firm/ ‘hard’; Sk.
hd-la, ‘strength,’ Pali ha-li, ‘strong/ Malay baligh, ‘mature,’ New
Brit , pat-uan, ‘strong,’ Sam. matua, ‘strong,’ ‘mature.’]


71. Skin —The Fiji kuri is in Santo, Efate, and Epi, and probably
is Yoku kolistan. The vinui of the Northern languages, Mota
viniu, is pin in Duke of York Island. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 90.
72. Flesh —The word visiko is common in the North. The
Erakorysf£, Pangkumu vusiko, Bieri visiko are the same word.
The other words are strange. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 69,
73. Name —The Efate has gisa, Malo and Tangoa cisa, kiza,
Pangkumu cis, Aulua ag l se. The omission of the guttural gives
Ambry m sa, Malo isa, Aneityum it ha, Arag iha, Omba hena,
Lamangkau ia, Fiji yadha. The Maewo and Mota may show isa
reduplicated. The loss of the sibilant gives the Epi kia, Efate
agie. The Baki sia is the Bieri kia by a regular change from k
to s. See words for Moon, Fire, Nose.
74. Good —There is little agreement in the words found. The
Mota wia is in Maewo and Efate. The Epi and Malekula agree
in the use of some form of ho, which is also in the district of
Raluana New Britain. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 72.
[The Sydney aborigines of Australia said hu-jari, ‘good’; Sk. is
bha-dra, Pali pun-no, Lat. bon-us, Malay ha-ik, Maori pa-i.~\
75, Bad —The commonest word is some form of sa. Pangkumu
jij is probably the Banks Island tisi. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 53.
[Sk. rt. words for ‘bad’ are ka (prefix) and kash-ta (adj.); cf.
Aneityumese has (for kas), ‘bad,’ eh-ka, ‘very difficult,’ and Efatese
sa, ‘bad.’]
76. Great —There is a great variety of terms, with little agree-
ment. The Savan lewu is Fiji leva, also found in Santa Cruz levu
and Banks’ Islands luwo. Omba lawua, and Mota liwoa may be
forms of lewu. The Aulua lumho, lira lamapa, is in Efate, Nguna,
laba, lapa, ‘many.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 79.
77. Small —A form of riki, giki is very common. Cf. Mel.
Lang. p. 81.
[Bengali kichhi is ‘small,’ P&li khuddo, Malay kechil.~\
78. Bed —The Efate miel is found also in Malekula. The Omba,
Arag, and Maewo memea is explained by Mota mea, ‘red earth,’


reduplicated. The Malo dai-ca is ‘blood,’ dai with adjective ter-
mination, ca. The same word is in Bald jie-ki , a kind of purple.
Eromanga navilara is from vila , ‘lightning.’ Aneityum cap is
‘fire,’ but there is also tanana, formed like memea from tan , ‘ red
earth.’ Tanna ervarev is the ‘ red glow of sunset,’ which as ravi-
ravi, afiafi is a common word in Oceania for ‘evening.’ Cf. Mel.
Lang. p. 87. [See rts. ma, me, ha, ra, and ravi, in Note No. I.]
79. White—Vuti or vusi is the common word, which is also in
Malagasy and Malay Archipelago. With prefix ma, this is Omba
ma-vuti, Malekula me-vus, embusa, Epi mi-woivo, mi-uiu; Efate tare
is properly ‘clean, pure,’ Omba ma-sara, ‘clean.’ Malo lulu is
Torres Island lul, ‘white,’ Mota ‘fair.’ Santo vohe is Pangkumu
voqhoq , ‘ clean,’ Mota tcoke, ‘an albino.’ The Maewo sigara,
Samoa sinasina, is from a root meaning ‘shine,’ in Fiji, siqa ‘sun,’
sigasigau, ‘white,’ Sesake ma-sina, ‘moon.’ Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 97.
[Sk. valaksha, ‘white,’ Dr. vel, Slavonic veli, Hungarian vilag,
‘light’; another rt. is pu (ba), ‘shine,’ q.v.~\
80. Slack —The word maefo, seen in Arag, Santo, and Malekula,
is very widely spread, and is also in Malagasy and Malay. In
Efate, Sesake, maeto is ‘angry.’ The Fiji loa is in Nguna. Malo
urica is ‘ skin colour ’ {uri ‘ skin,’ ca the adjective termination).
This suggests the Polynesian uri as ‘skin,’ but skins are not black
in Polynesia. Cf po-uri, ‘dark.’ Aneityum apig is also used for
‘night,’ as is the Mota silsilig‘a for ‘dark.’ Mele hele-hele is ‘dirty,’
kele, ‘earth.’ Maewo oso-oso is o-o, ‘cloud,’in Nogogu; soso, ‘dirt,’
in Fiji. Cf. Mel. Lang. p. 57.
[‘Black’ is often ‘burnt’ (cf. the name Ham); hence ma-eta ,
l uli, <fec. may come from rts. ma, ka; see Note 1; Sk. kala, ‘black.’]
81. Holy —The word tapu, which is also Polynesian properly,
means ‘prohibited, set apart,’ and is found in Aneityum, Eromanga,
Efate, Malo, and Tangoa, and also in the Arag sa-pu with adjec-
tive termination. The Pangkumu ukon may be Malo ducu , Santo
ruku, Maewo rogorogo, Mota ro'go , and the meaning is ‘sacred.’
82. See —There is no doubt a great variety of terms for ‘see,’
and all may not have exactly the same meaning. An example


from Pangkumu may be given in illustration. Coro is ‘to open
the eyes and look for’ (Nguna leogoro ); bunsi (Nguna, etc punusi,
Florida of Solomon Is. buguti) is ‘to look at,’ eg. a ship, a picture;
nunuri , ‘to stare, gaze at,’ as in reading a book. The Mota is ilo
nurnur, ‘to look carefully.’ Rag‘arag‘, ‘to be present at’ and there-
, fore ‘see’, as a dance, a person’s house. The word kite, which is
Maori, is seen in Aneityum ecet, Tanna at a, eru , Tangoa kite,
Arag g‘ita, Maewo ete, Aniwa citi, Mae kute. Marina kilt is the
common word for ‘ know.’
[The Aneityumese alum., ‘to look at,’ and ecet, ‘to see,’ ucni,
‘to burn,’ show that the rts. in this column are the same as in alo,
kan, ma of Notes 1 and 61 t'qq.v.); see also ‘know,’ No. 85.]
83. Hfar —The word rogo is very widely distributed in Oceania,
and in its simplest form means ‘ to feel a sensation,’ as pain or a
noise. When meaning ‘to hear,’ it often takes a suffixed transitive
termination, as in Ambrym rog-ta, Omba rorog-tagi, Mota rogo-tag,
Samoa logo-na. The Aneityum ahgei, Tanna areqi, Eromanga
rigi, Lifu dege, are all forms of rogo. In the Weasisi ate-telig, telig
is the word common for ‘ear,’ and ate, no doubt, means ‘to turn’;
in Mota ate is ‘to turn to,’ ate-nagoi, ‘ to turn the face to.’
[See ‘ear.’ Malay is dangar, ‘to hear,’ cognate to logo, rogod\
84. Speak, Say, Tell —lt is by no means certain that all the
words here given are exactly synonymous. The Fiji vosa is seen
in Tasiwo, Efate, etc., and in Futuna and Aniwa visa, fasa, Lifu
■whadha, and Ambrym fie. Vosa is also in Malo the word for ‘know.’
We have vet in Mota, Maewo, Santo, Malo, and Epi, in Makura
mbetog, and Tanna ani is Lifu dni, ‘to say,’ Malo somisin Pang-
kumu sur, but is there only used in compounds, as sori-menemen
‘speak kindly,’ sur-papagis, ‘speak angrily,’etc. Mai and Fiji
muna is Samoan muna , ‘to grumble.’
[Some of these words have an extraordinary resemblance to
Sk. vad, ‘speak,’ Latin fat-ns. Cf. also Malay bhdsa, Pali hhasa,
‘speech,’ Dr. pesu, ‘to speak,’ Sk, bhdsh, ‘to speak.’]


85. Know —A representative of the Fiji kila, Mota g‘ilala, is
seen in Maewo g‘ig‘ilea, Ambrym kelea, Bieri ki'i, Eromanga kili.
The Aulua lise-mbosa is ‘see-speak,’ Tangoa rogo-bosa, * hear-speak.’
The ataeoi Efate, etc., is in Mele taea, and in Lifu ate , and is also
in South Cape (New Guinea) ata , and Ponape (Caroline Islands)
aja. Arag ilo, Omba iloilo is ‘ see ’in Mota, Efate, etc.
[Cf. ‘ See ’; cognate is ‘ know cf. Lat. vid-eo, Gr. oid-a.~\
86. Barter, Bay, Sell —The common Oceanic word is voli. This
is seen in Epi and the Northern languages of the New Hebrides.
There is an interesting correspondence of idiom in the word used
in the Southern languages and Polynesia. In Aneityum and in
Tanna, aua and vahai are causative prefixes, the same as faka,fa l a
in Futuna, Aniwa and Samoa. The second part of the compound
is the ordinary word in use for ‘ eye,’ nimtan, namri, mat a, but
used as a verb. Hence aua-nimtam, faka-mat a, etc., mean ‘to cause
any one to eye.’ The same idiom is found in New Britain (Ralu-
ana district) wa-mat, ‘to sell, offer for sale,’ In the Duke of York
Island mata is ‘ price,’ in Florida (Solomon Islands) mate. In
Efate, Nguna, Sesake, the first part of the compound is also the
causative. Nguna tovi is ‘distribute,’ Futuna tufa, Aniwa tufioa,
‘ give out,’ Samoan tufa.
[Some of these words mean ‘to exchange’; cf. Tukiok we-keleif\
87. Eat —All the dialects have some form of kani or kai. Pang-
kumu hani is restricted to the eating of cooked food, roi is ‘to eat
raw food.’ Ambrym drog is perhaps the same as roi. [See ‘food.’]
88. Drink —The common word is muni in various forms, and
often with the transitive suflßx gi. Inu is also found.
[Rt. ma, mi, ‘water,’ q.v. Cf. Lat, bi-bo, Gr. pi-no. Oceanic
inu (for mi-nu ) perhaps gives niu, ‘cocoanut,’ by metathesis.]
89. Dig —All the words found are forms of kili, except Futuna
vere, which is Fiji were, ‘a garden,’ were-dka, ‘to garden,’ dig up
weeds, etc.
90. Bury —The Polynesian tanu, with transitive suffix, is seen
in Tanna, Eromanga, Efate, and Malo. The original meaning is


‘to cover with earth,’with Mota tanu, ‘to cover’; cf tano, ‘earth.’
In Tanna and Eromanga, the word is probably of recent introduc-
tion, as the heathen custom was to bury in the sea. The Fiji
bulu-ta, from bulubulu, ‘grave,’ may be compared with Baki buhl,
‘ pit,’ bulu-si-inaro , ‘ pit of dead, grave.’ Lifu kelemi may be an
extreme form of tanumi, or be from kele, ‘ earth,’ with transitive
suffix.
91. Weep —The only departure from the common taqi are in
Lifu and Tanna. Kai, gcai, gei, which are local in the Efate
district, are also used for the buzzing of a fly, mosquito, etc. The
same use is found in Pangkumu keke, ‘to buzz,’ ke, ‘to shout,’ gceir,
‘to scream,’ Malo gar a, ‘to scream.’
[The root idea is ‘shrill, sharp, keen’; see rts. gar, ka in Note
1 ; cf. the Irish ‘ keen-ing.]
92. Fear —There are variations from the common Oceanic
mataku in Tanna, Nogogu, Fiji, and Lifu.
93. Life —The word mauri is common, with a few exceptions.
[The rt. is ma, ‘to live, to breathe’; cf Sk. bhd (bhav), ‘to be,
to come into existence’; Pali pa-no, ‘ life, vitality, a creature,’
Sam. ma-nava, ‘ breathe.’]
94. Die —Only one word mate, varying in form to mar, mas,
and mech.
[The root is ma, ‘ fade away,’ as in Gr. ma-r-aino. The old
Assyrian is ma-atu, ‘todie,’ Hebrew ma-vetk, ‘death,’ Australian
ba-lun, ‘dead,’ Keltic bas, ‘death.’ The Aryans add r, as Sk. mri
(mar), ‘to die,’ Lat. mor-s .]
95. Sleep —The Central and Northern tongues have maturu,
which is Lifu mekole. There is no agreement among the Southern
languages.
96. Stand —The usual word is tu, in most cases joined to a word
meaning ‘ upright,’ as in Sesake ndu-leana, Efate tu-leg, Epi tu-
mau,ju-moli, su-malu.
[‘ Stand, Stay, Sit ’ are allied ideas; tu is Sk. s-thd, Lat. s-to.~\


97. Stay —The word toko does not appear in Tanna and Ero-
manga, but is present in the Aneityum ateuc , ‘to sit.’
98. Sit —This word is usually the same as that for ‘stay,’ often
with the word for ‘ground ’ added, as in tok-e-tan, jo-a-tavo , toko-
san, etc. The Malekula sagcer, sagcali, Tangoa sakele, mean ‘to
sit on something high,’ Mota sage. Ambalok non means ‘to sit
on something low.’ Sake is a very common directive, meaning
‘upward; to ascend.’
99. Go—Vano and va in various forms are widely distributed.
The notion is probably that of motion only. Pangkumu jo is Lifu
tro in tro-tha, where tha denotes motion from the speaker.
100. Come —The word mai is probably never a verb, but rather
an adverb ‘hither.’ It is commonly used with verbs of motion, as
in Lifu tro-mi, Malekula and Maewo, vani-mai, vano-mai, etc.
[‘ Go,’ ‘ Come ’ are allied ; cf. Dr. po, ‘ to go,’ vd, ‘ to come,’ Gr.
ba-o, ha-ino ,’ ‘I go,’ Lat. va-do. J
Numerals.
These require little notice and many are fully discussed in Dr.
Codrington’s “Melanesian Languages.” There are three methods
of numeration in use, 1. Pure quinary.—“No word for ten is in
use, except such a one as shows five to be the number really in
view.”* 2. Imperfect decimal.—« There is a word for ten; after
five is reached there is no further mention of the five.”f 3.
Decimal.—“ Each number is expressed by a different word,”*
The vigesimal system, which among the languages here shown is
only found in Lifu, has no representatives in the New Hebrides.
Tabulated according to numeral systems, the New Hebrides
Languages appear as follows :
1. Quinary : Distinct words from one to five ; the remaining
numbers expressed by addition. Examples : —Aneityum, Tanna,
Eromanga, In Tanna, ten is ‘five-five,’ in Eromanga ‘ two-fives.’
2. Imperfect Decimal : (a) Distinct words from one to five;
six, seven, eight, and nine are expressed by one, two, three, four,
* Oodrington, Melanesian Languages, p. 222. f Ibid p. 223. J Ibid p. 228*
K— July 5,1893.


with a prefix; ten is‘two-fives.’ Examples: —Epi, Efate, Sesake,
Paama, Nguna, Makura. ( b ) The same formation, but a distinct
word for ten. Examples: —Ambrym, Malekula, Espiritu Santo
(Eralado, Tangoa, Marina).
[There the -ul, -hul, -vul is the Polynesian fulu; see ‘ ten.’]
3. Decimal : Distinct words for each number. Examples: —
Malo, Espiritu Santo (Nogogu), Omba, Arag, Mae wo, Fiji, and all
the Polynesian dialects.
The numerals are generally used with a prefix, which is separated
from the root in the vocabulary by a hyphen.
101. One —The words seem to be divided among three principal
forms, tasi , sikai, and tuwa. In the New Hebrides tasi seems only
to be found in Paama, Epi, Lifu, and perhaps the Southern Lan-
guages. The commonest New Hebrides word is a form of sikai,
which is also in the Solomon Islands. The Arag tuwa , Maewo;
Mota tuwale, tewa, is Fiji ndua.
[ln ta-si and si-ka-i, the original root is ka, Sk. eka, ‘ one.’]
102 104. Two, Three, Four —These are rua, tolu, and vati, in
various forms. The chief variations are the Lifu kdni for tolu,
and the Lifu eke, and the Polynesian fa (va), for vati.
[For lua , tolu (t‘lu) cf. Sk. dva (Lat. duo) and tri.]
105. Five —Lima in various forms is found everywhere, and is
the common word for ‘hand.’ Tanna kari-lum and the Eromangan
suk-rim are ‘one hand.’
[lt has been shown (see note on the word ‘hand’), that the old
root-word gab, gam, ‘to lay hold of’ {cf. Eng. finger, Ger. fangen),
is the source of lima, ‘ hand.’ The nearest approach to this root
are the Aneityumese ikm-an for kim-an and the Epi jim-o. The
Irish lam, ‘the hand,’ and the Greek e-lab-on, ‘ I took hold of,’
are from the same root.]
106 - 109. Six, Seven, Eight, Nine —Where these numbers are
distinct, there is an agreement in the use of the words ono,fitu,
walu, siwo, or some form of them. When formed by prefix, a form


of la is commonly seen. In the Tangoa linarave, linarabi, Una is
the word for ‘hand.’
[The Aneityumese for ‘ six ’ is (n)ikman um elid et ethi, which
means ‘ his-hand and added is one,’ for the Oceanic numerals of
the second hand are got hy addition ; the Motu ‘eight,’ ta-ura-
hani is ‘ a two-fours.’ The prefix la in some words is for lima, ‘the
(first) hand.’]
110. Ten —The separate word for ‘ten’ is in all cases a form of
sagavalu. In Mele it is nofuru, Samoan se-fulu.
[The Oceanic fulu is ‘all,’sc. the fingers; Sk. pi-par-mi, ‘I fill’;
the Pali puro, Malay punnuh, Efate bura, all mean ‘ full’; New
Brit, para, vuru, ‘all’; New Guinea (one dialect) mura, ‘all.’
The Maori has poro, ‘to end or be finished,’ with which cf. Pali
puro, ‘full.’ The Malay has also bulah, ‘complete.’ The prefixes
are sa, ‘ one,’ nga (ngo, go, ko), the article ; so that sa-nga-fulu
means ‘once-the-whole,’sc. fingers. The Ebudan lua-lima is ‘two
hands,’ and kari-lum-kari-lum is ‘one-hand-one-hand.’]
Pronouns:
In the Vocabulary three forms of pronoun are given, separated
by semi-colons. Of these the first is the full form, the second is
the possessive suffixed to nouns, the third is the shortened form
used with verbs. Any form which I have not found to be now
in use, is marked ...; when it does not exist it is marked f.
1. Personal Pronouns: These show a general use of personal
and demonstrative prefixes, i, ki, ni, ke, etc. The root-forms seem
to be the following ;
Sing, 1. au, nau Plur. 1 (inclusive) kita, ita
2. ko, o 1 (exclusive) ma, mi
3. ia, e 2. mui, mu, mi
3. ra, la
The dual forms may mostly be referred to the plural roots, with
the numeral ‘two’ suffixed. In the same way, three or a few persons
are often denoted by a suffixed numeral. In Aulua (Malekula)
and in the Polynesian dialects, however, the suffixed ntil, ton used


in the plural are the numeral tolu, ‘three,’ used indefinitely of
any number more than two.
2, Possessive Pronouns : In the singular, these are all forms
of ku, ma, na , and are suffixed to nouns denoting relationship or
parts of a whole. The dual and plural forms do not appear to be
distinct from those used as personal pronouns, but are in most
cases abbreviated.
3. Verbal Pronouns : These are usually shortened forms of
the personal pronouns, and are sometimes combined with the verbal
particles. (See Introduction). In the third person, the word must
often be regarded as a particle rather than a pronoun, especially in
the consonantal forms m, t, k, etc.
Plural.
The methods of forming the plural are various. They may be-
tabulated as follows :
1. By prefix ra, ro, o, o : —Malo, Santo, Futuna, Aniwa, Lifu.
vei, i :—Malo, Fiji, Lifu.
2. By adjective following : —Commonly.
3. By plural pronoun following ; —Epi and Malekula.
4. By noun preceding : —Eromanga.
b By lengthened vowel: —Samoa and Maori.

39. lai * or Uvea —Communicated by Rev. S. Ella, Sydney.
40. Mare —Communicated by Rev. S. M. Creagh, Sydney.
*[The native name of this island is lai (not Tai as on page 109). The
following account of the manner in which brown Polynesians came to
settle on this island is worth preserving ; it is communicated by the Rev.
S. Ella; —On the island of Uvea (properly lai), in the Loyalty group,
some castaways, both from Tonga and Wallis’ Island, have long been
settled; one party, Uveans (Wallis Is.), occupying the northern end of
the island, to which they gave the name of Uvea, and the other on the
southern extremity, which they call Tonga. The original inhabitants
(laians) occupy the central portion. The correct name of the island is
lai, but navigators, from first having had intercourse with the immi-
grants at the northern end, have misnamed the island from the intro-
duced name of that district. The description given by some of the natives
of the Union Group in a measure accounts for the manner in which these
waifs get driven away to distant islands. They were accustomed to move
from island to island, long distances apart, in times of scarcity of food
or other emergencies ; and the night time, when the sea is calmer and
the wind lighter, was generally selected for voyaging. They steered by
the stars ; but if the night became cloudy, or a strong wind arose, they
would simply lower their sails, entreat the protection of their gods, and
then quietly resign themselves to drift whither sea and wind might bear
them.
These laians were the original occupants of their island, but whence
they came or when they settled there, I never could ascertain. They
are Papuans, not negritoes, and resemble the peoples on the coast of New
Guinea.
As on lai, so in the New Hebrides; immigrants have been drifted
thither from Eastern Polynesia. For instance, some forty years ago,
missionaries from Samoa discovered a tribe of Samoans occupying a dis-
trict on the island of Efate (Sandwich Is.), with whom easy intercourse
was held in their own language. The account of their emigration was to
this effect: —ln one of the sanguinary conflicts which toot place in Samoa
before Christianity was introduced into that group, a large canoe party
effected their escape from their conquered district, and fled to seek refuge
in Tonga. Owing to adverse winds they missed that group, and were
carried to the New Hebrides, and made the island of Efate. Here, after
several conflcts with the natives, they were enabled to establish them-
selves. Many years afterwards they were visited by the John Williams,
missionary ship, and some elected to return to their former home. The
islands of Aniwa and Futuna, in the New Hebrides, are peopled by
natives of Tonga and Futuna proper, westwards from Samoa, and also by
emigrants from Tanna. Islands at the north of the New Hebrides also
are inhabited by immigrants probably from the Eastern Pacific.]
