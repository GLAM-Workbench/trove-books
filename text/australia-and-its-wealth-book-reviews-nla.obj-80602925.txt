We have often of late amused ourselves with imagining one of
our quiet, plodding great-great-grandfathers, of the prosperous
times of George the Second, falling asleep some hundred years
ago, like the beauty in the fairy tale, and awaking, refreshed
with his long slumber, some morning in the year 1852. How
overwhelming would be his astonishment at the many unheard-
unthought-of objects which on every hand would claim his
notice! Passing over the surprise which the altered appearance
of the house, the furniture,?above all, the many domestic
appliances, unknown a century ago,?how would the very news-
paper of the present day astound him! These huge sheets, three
times the size of the London Journal or the Daily Advertiser ,
over which perchance he had fallen asleep?those giant pages!
What can they contain? There is the report of the Money
Market, Consols, Long Annuities, Bank Stock, these are
familiar enough; but ? Steam-boat Companies, what are they?
< Railway Shares,? what are they? ?Mining Shares ;??this is
more intelligible, for our great-great-grandfathers were not proof
against the seductions of ?mining property.? And, then, the
? Anglo-Californian,? the ? Agua Fria,? the ? Burra Burra,? the
? Cobre Copper Mine.? the ? South Australian,? where are these
strangely-named mines ?to what countries dci they belong ? But
these closely printed shipping advertisements, filling
column after column in front of the large papei ? Steam to
Bombay,? ? Steam to Calcutta ? ?Calcutta ! that small factoiy;
scarcely thought of until Colonel Clive went over, and yet a
dozen advertisements of steam vessels, and ? line of packets
thither? And, ?Direct to California,? ?Steam to California,?
that ultima thule of Spanish America, scarcely known, even
by name! But what is this, strange as it must seem, to the
two columns and a half of advertisements, all pointing to that
unknown region, Australia? * For Sidney direct,? ?for Adelaide
direct,? ? for Melbourne, Geelong, Port Philip, Hobart Town,?


and still Australia, Australia, meeting the eye in each. Aus-
tralia ! what country can this be ? The Hudson Bay Company
had lately sent home wondrous stories how far their enterprising
hunters had penetrated into the American wilderness; and Lord
Anson had, within the last few years, * put a girdle round the
earth but Australia, ?where can it be ? He turns to the map
of the world, not 4 the map of the world, with the latest dis-
coveries,?published by John Senex, in the year 1744, with its wide
wastes of ocean in the south, and 4 terra incognita? inscribed on
regions where now are populous cities, ?nay, where steam and
the rail find a place; no, not to that well-worn old map, for it is
useless now, but to Wyld?s. Truly, if he has slumbered, the
spirit of discovery has not. Look at those countless cities,
stretching westward, westward, into the American wilderness,
beyond the boundary of the Mississippi! Look at the clusters of
islands studding the South Pacific! Look at that fifth continent,
that new found world in the far south, our very antipodes. This
is Australia, and thither are thousands flocking, for Australia
could yield a home to the surplus population of all Europe, and
still present wide tracts of fertile land crying aloud for tillers of
her fields, and reapers of her abundant harvests!
A singular land is Australia; fertile, healthful, and, in many
parts, beautiful; but still, as though in right of its antipodal
position, looking very much like the world turned upside down
to the European visitant. How different are its indigenous pro-
ductions, animal and vegetable ; how strange its kangaroo, its
ornithorhyncus, and that paradox of Horace, its black swan!
Its gum-tree forests, too, with 4 the foliage so thin and pendulous,
* that when the sun is over head, one rides through the bush almost
4 as utterly unsheltered as if there had been no trees;? contrasted
with those which were a kind of myrtle, near two hundred feet
high, and twenty or thirty in girth, and cast so deep a shadow at
noontide, that 4 it was literally the nemorum noctem of the poet.?
But what are those to 4 the absolute inversion of the seasons in
these Austral portions of the globe ?? As our pleasant traveller
Colonel Mundy remarks, 4 brimful of home associations, how
4 strange is it to find May-day, the festival of young Flora, falling
4 in autumn, and to see Jack-in-the-Green dancing about, clothed
4 in the sere and yellow leaf. Guy Faux looks terribly out of
4 season, and out of countenance, toiling through the streets (as
4 1 saw him doing on the sth of November, 1848) in a terrific
4 sirocco of hot wind and dust, with the thermometer at 100 in
4 the shade. But, above all, Christmas! Sitting in a thorough
4 draft, clad in a Holland blouse, you may see men and boys
4 dragging from the neighbouring bush piles of green stuff, (oak


? branches in full leaf and acorn, and a handsome shrub with a
? pink flower and a pale green leaf, the ? Christmas? of Aus-
? tralia,) for the decoration of churches and dwellings, stopping
?every fifty yards to wipe their perspiring brows.? This is
whimsical enough; but it really'appears as though a revised
edition of the poets, ancient as well as modern, will be needed
for Australia, since,
? How completely does its antipodal position falsify their images
to the born Australian. Thomson knew nothing about the seasons,
and Shakspere is no longer the poet of nature. What does he
mean by?
? The sweet South,
That breathes upon a bank of violets,
Stealing and giving odours.?
The south wind brings sleet, and hail, and chilly hurricanes, ?blight-
ing and blasting every blossom it touches! What does Horace mean
by his rabiem nods? ?tis a libel on our soft Australian northern breezes.
? Keen aquilon ?is not keen, whatever Herbert may say or sing. As
to the east wind, so much abused in English prose, if not verse, here
it is the balmy breath of the Pacific, ?the sweet sea-breeze, for whose
daily advent during the summer, the Sydneyite watches and prays
with all the fervour that inspired the ? aura venV of Cephalus. The
veteran Spenser must have been dozing when he wrote of old January
quaking with cold, for the Australian bard sings,?
? When hot December?s sultry breeze,
Scarce stirs a leaf on yonder trees
And if December be hot, January is hotter still.? ?Our Antipodes,
vol. iii. p. 31, 32.
The climate of New South Wales, and of Western and
Southern Australia as well, is, however, very fine. There are
few cloudy days, and none of that uncertainty of weather which
so greatly diminishes the pleasures of an English summer. To
use the words of our lively traveller, ?A fine day is a matter of
course; sunshine is the rule, clouds the exceptionand, strangely
too, no one appears to fear the sun, even at midsummer. Masons
and bricklayers, exposed to its full blaze for eight or ten hours a
day, seem to suffer little inconvenience. The drought, and the
consequent dry, parching air, are the greatest drawbacks; but
?still, it is a glorious climate; glorious in its visible beauty,
? glorious in its freedom from lethal disorders; priceless in respect
ï¿½to this latter feature, in the eyes of those who have known what
<it is to serve in countries where death multiform rides on the
? wind, lurks in forest or swamp, or riots in the crowded city.?
The work from whence the above extracts have been taken, is by
Colonel Mundy, an officer who had already seen some service,


both in the East Indies and in Canada, and who, as ?Deputy-
Adjutant-General in the Australian colonies,? became a re-
sident for five years in Sydney, during which time he made
various excursions into the interior of New South Wales, as well
as to the adjacent colonies of New Zealand, Van Diemen?s
Land, and Victoria, together with a visit, just before his return,
to the newly-discovered gold-diggings at Bathurst. ? Wholly
unconnected with, and independent of, the colonies and com-
munities he strives to delineate,? his work, on this very account,
has a value which few other works on the same subject possess;
while, as presenting a very graphic series of pictures of a land
toward which the hopes and expectations of so many thousands
are now tending, it deserves the attention both of those who are
going and of those who stay. We shall accompany Colonel Mundy
in his pleasant visits to these rising colonies, supplying or correct-
ing their statistics from the recently published ? Twelfth Report of
the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioqers.?
In June, 1846, Colonel Mundy entered ?one of the noblest
harbours in the world, Port Jackson,? and the anchor was dropped
just beside the spot where, in 1788, the first governor of New
South Wales pitched the tents of the first British plantation in
New Holland. Very different w T as the view that met the eyes
of the new comer, not quite sixty years after. Long lines of
well-built streets, one, George-street, extending two miles and a
half in length; the endless succession of well-supplied and well-
lighted shops; the handsome dwelling-houses, letting, in the
more ?fashionable? quarters, at one and two hundred a year;
and the beautiful villas in the outskirts, surrounded by their
pleasure-grounds and gardens, where the natives of the tropical
regions, together with those of more temperate climates, grow in
unparalleled luxuriance, formed a pleasant scene for the eyes of
the stranger to rest upon. The Australian cedar is profusely
used in the fittings of the Sydney dwellings. ?lt has all the
beauty, in colour and figure, of the Spanish mahogany, but in
solidity and closeness of grain the Australian cedar is greatly
inferior.? The police appear tolerably active, the population, on
the whole, quiet and decorous; and, with greater attention to
sanitary laws, Sydney bids fair to become a city worthy of the
mighty country to which she belongs. The inhabitants, gene-
rally, seem very prosperous. ? I have visited no part of the
?world,? says our author, ? where there appears so much of uni-
versal competence, so much equality of means, if such be possible.
There must be few persons in New South Whiles spending
1000/. a year; and there must be equally few who cannot afford
a sufficiency of food, clothing, bread, meat, and firing, for
NO. xxxr. R


themselves and families, every?day of the year.? The shopkeepers
in Sydney largely participate in this prosperity; most of them
reside in handsome houses, and many keep carriages.
In 1850-51, Colonel Mundy visited Van Diemen?s Land,
and the colony of Port Philip, now named Victoria. He was
much struck with the fine situation of Hobart Town, and its
noble harbour.
< The land in which the port is framed is three times higher than
that of Port Jackson, the soil better, the timber finer, and the grand
hack-ground to the town, afforded by Mount Wellington?cloud-
capped in summer, snow-capped in winter, ?close in its rear, gives
the palm of picturesque beauty, beyond dispute, to Hobart Town,
and its harbour, over its sister port and city. The land tints disap-
pointed me entirely,?nothing but browns and yellows; no verdure,
everything burnt up. . . . Some of the suburbs are very pretty, the
style of architecture of the villas, their shady seclusion, and the trim-
ness of their approaches and pleasure-grounds, far surpassing those
of the New-South-Wales capital. . . . The extraordinary luxuriance
of the common red geranium, at this season, makes every spot look
gay; at the distance of miles, the sight is attracted and dazzled by
wide patches of scarlet dotted over the landscape. The hedges of
sweetbrier, both in the town gardens and country enclosures, covered
with its delicate rose, absolutely monopolize the air ?with its peculiar
perfume; the closely-clipped mint-borders, supplying the place of box,
sometimes, however, overpower the sweetbrier, and every other scent
in the gardens. Every kind of English flower and fruit appears to
benefit by transportation to Van Dieman?s Land. Well-remembered
shrubs and plants, to which the heat of Australia is fatal, thrive in
the utmost luxuriance under this more southern climate. The old
original fuschia gracilis attains here an extraordinary growth. Edging
the beds of a garden near where I lived, there were hundreds of yards
of fuschia in bloom. . . . Here I renewed my acquaintance with the
walnut, and filbert, the horse-chesnuts, the lime-tree, with its bee-
beloved blossom, and the dear old hawthorn of my native land.? ?
Our Antipodes , vol. iii. p. 152-4.
All the landscapes in the neighbourhood are very beautiful, ?
? much more European than Australian in their character;? and
the view from an eminence, ?looking over villas, and gardens,
and wooded undulations, down upon the bright waters of the
wide and hill-encircled harbour,? reminded our author of ? a peep?
from a campagne near Lausanne, over the village of Ouchi, upon
the broad expanse of ? clear, placid Leman.? The great draw-
back, however, on all this natural beauty, is the character of the
inhabitants; the population of the island, centesimally divided,
ranging under the following divisions:? ? Free immigrants and
born in the colony, 46 per cent.; convict, and emerged into


freedom, 51 per cent.; military and aborigines, 3 per cent,?
Among the gentlemen
4 Who left their country for their country?s good,?
Colonel Mundy had the pleasure of seeing the very unheroic Mr.
Smith O?Brien, who was enjoying himself with his ticket of leave
in a very pretty cottage, and far better off than hundreds of
worthy Englishmen, whose only crime is their poverty.
The chief town in the colony of Victoria, Melbourne, falls far
behind Sydney and Hobart Town, both in situation and ap-
pearance. It is?
* A well laid-out, ugly town, containing about 20,000 inhabitants.
The adjacent country, visible from the highest look-out, is but poorly
sprinkled with trees, and is at present herbless to a degree that I
never saw elsewhere, even in New South Wales. The town is but
the outlet for the splendid back country. . . . There is about Mel-
bourne an air of progress and prosperity, apparent to the least ob-
servant stranger, ?an air of bustle and business during the working
hours of the day, and of solid comfort and easy competence, when the
labours of the day are over. The middle and the poorer classes are
so well off, indeed, that they have no necessity for extreme exertion.?
Ovr Antipodes, vol. iii. p. 280.
But whatever may be the comparative prosperity of the towns,
in a new country like Australia, it is the country that offers the
chief sources of abundant wealth, and for this
? The term squatter, inelegant as it may appear, is an official term
in this colony. But it is applied to a different class from that to
which it belongs in America, whence it is borrowed. The squatter of
America is generally a small farmer or labouring man, with as much
capital as he can carry in an old stocking, who, wandering beyond the
limits of the district surveyed by Government, and consequently
open to sale, has sat down, or squatted, on wild land, as the buffalo
or the moose might do, with as great a right, and greater, to its oc-
cupancy, and no more liable to distraint for rent than his quadruped
neighbour on the prairie. As the frontier of the state extends, and
the surveyor approaches his ? farm,? the squatter either removes to
? fresh diggins,? or, taking advantage of the right of pre-emption, pur-
chases, for the fixed price of a dollar and a quarter an acre, as much
of his original squattage as he may need or can afford to make his own.
I have lodged with an American thus situated near the head-waters
of the Mississippi. His hut, built of substantial logs, cut from the
* oak-opening,? or grove, on the edge of which he was located, looked
over a wide expanse of rolling prairie as far as the eye could range,
dotted only with occasional clumps of timber.
? His herds, therefore, however far dispersed, were still within his
ken, and needed no further care than that of himself and sons. How
different from the forest pastures of Australia! He was but twenty -
r 2


two miles from a navigable lake, communicating with the St. Law-
rence, and the same distance from his market, a small frontier town.
. . . Such are the squatters of the far west, and such were some of
the original squatters of this colony.?
But in Australia, at present,
? For the purposes of squatting, the waste lands (a term very impro-
perly and imprudently given to the splendid territorial inheritance held
by the crown, as trustee for the public) are divided into three classes :d
the settled, the intermediate, and the unsettled districts. In the settled,
the lease is enjoyable for one year only; in the intermediate, for eight
years; in the unsettled, or ultra-frontier lands, for fourteen yeais.
The rent is lOf. per annum for a ?run? capable of carrying 4000
sheep, or 640 head of cattle or horses. The runs are open to
purchase during the lease, except by the lessee. On the expiration of
a lease, it is competent for Government to put up all or any part of the
land for sale, the lessee having the right of pre-emption at its fair
value, which shall never be less than 1/. per acre. The assessment on
stock is 3 \cl. for horses, 1 for cattle, \d. for sheep per head. .. ?
The English reader must understand that the lessees of crown lands,
the squatters, are debarred by law from cultivating any part of their
runs, except for the consumption of their families and establishments.
Immense tracts, therefore, must remain untenanted by the plough,
and continue to be primeval deserts.??Yoh i. p. 277-79.
Although it seems difficult to understand why agriculture on a
large scale should be thus prohibited, the advantages to the
Australian colonies from the consequent extension of what our
author calls ?the pastoral interests,? have been great. ?lhe
?honour of originating the Australian wool trade is to Mr.
? John Macarthur,? who, going to England about 1803, displayed
samples of wool grown by himself in New South Wales, to some
brokers, and ? who, foreseeing the advantages to be derived from
? so important a branch of commerce, obtained for him a special
? grant of land, and a number of assigned servants.? Thus was
laid the foundation of what bids fair to become the staple of the
colony, the Australian wool trade.
The English reader, accustomed to the limited farming of his
native land, must feel astounded at the gigantic scale of the farm-
ing establishments here, especially of the sheep-owners. Ihe pro-
prietor of Coombing,?an elegant country seat, with a fine back-
ground of hills, weeded to their summit, ?Mr. Icely, has an estate
consisting of 50,000 acres, ? with hundreds of thousands of acres
? of pasture rented from the crown, 25,000 sheep, 3000 head of
?cattle, and some 300 horses;? while ?there are about 45 miles
?of substantial three-railed fencing on the property !? This im-
mense establishment is, however, outdone by that of Mr. Clark,
who was originally a butcher at Sydney.


?ln Yan Diemen?s Land, he has already purchased 50,000 acres,
part from the crown, and part from private .persons. This season he
informed me he had sheared, in New South Wales, 90,000, and in
Van Diemen?s Land, 40,000 sheep, and had sent to England this year
1500 bales of wool, which at 20/. a bale, gives 30,000/. .... In the
shearing season he is compelled to collect at his head stations, about
fifty or sixty roving, roaring, rowdy blades?wild hands when idle,
but good at a ? clip.? On these occasions he takes care to be present
himself.??Vol. iii. p. 262-64.
The fine quality of the Australian wool may be judged from
the statement, that Mr. Clark had sent home ï¿½ a fleece weighing
? 27 lbs., the growth of as many months, from one sheep, the staple
?of which was 21 inches long.? The proprietor of ?Salisbury
Court,? ?how English, indeed, how old English, is this name, ?
? a true grazier grandee of New South Wales,? also employs about
a hundred pair of hands, pays in wages and rations not less than
3000/., and was in 1851 assessed for 90,000 sheep. Although, as
may be fairly supposed, there are not many Australian settlers
possessing such more than patriarchal wealth in flocks and herds,
still, the general amount of sheep at the ? stations,? as they are
called, judging from advertisements, seem to range from 6000 to
15,000. ? Renting the sheep, with or without the pastures, is
? growing into a common practice, especially in this colony, Vic-
? toria. The lessee pays so much per annum for 1000 sheep (50/.
?to 80/. say). He gets the wool, and the increase of the flocks ;
? and, at the termination of the lease, he delivers back the station
? with the stock, equal in condition, age, and numbers.? At pre-
sent the price of a good sheep-station, with the stock upon it,
including the run, and the premises, appears to be about 10s.
a-head. Sheep, however, have been sold as low as Is. 6d. a head,
but Colonel Mundy considers the standard minimum value now
to be 4s. or ss. It is in this district that sheep-tarming appears
to be carried on with the greatest success. The natives are rarely
troublesome; indeed, in some cases they have been employed as
shepherds for four or five years past, and at one station have
had charge of 6000 sheep. ? The native dog has been nearly
? extirpated by the liberal use of strychnine, and instead of the
?old practice of yarding the sheep at night, they are now
? encamped round the hut of the stockman. A grand saving in
? wages is thus made; for one man, or an old couple, can take
? charge of one or two thousand sheep.? In another portion of
his work, Colonel Mundy tells us that the habit of engaging
married couples for ? the bush,? as shepherds, or herd-keepers, is
growing rapidly into use, for even children are found of service
in carrying rations to the men in charge of the flocks. The
wages in 1851 were high; 15/. to 25/. for shepherds, stockmen,


and draymen, while watchmen and hut-keepers,?offices which
might well be filled by men too old for severe labour, ?
obtained 15/. per annum. The usual ration is, 10 lbs. meat,
lOlbs. bread, tea, and fib. sugar, per week. Daring the
busy season a handsome addition is made to their wages; lodg-
ing is always gratis, and where milk is plentiful a supply is
furnished to them.
The shepherds of Australia, it may well be supposed, are not
?Arcadian? either in their tastes or habits. ? The shepherds tend
* their flocks to their pastures by day, and bring them home at
? night. The hut-keeper cooks for the men, receives the sheep at
? night, and is answerable for them until the next morning.? The
shepherd, after he has led out his fleecy charge, sits lazily enough
in the shade, not of a ?spreading beech,? but of a gum-tree,
enjoying his pipe,?that is, if he be able to obtain its unclassical
concomitant of tobacco, ?but more generally amusing himself
with playing on the Jew?s harp or accordion. The sale, indeed,
of both these substitutes for music, Colonel Mundy tells us, is
immense??five hundred accordions, and fifty gross of Jew?s
? harps, being considered small investments by one vessel. A
? shepherd has been known to walk two hundred miles from a
* distant station of the interior to purchase one of them at the
? nearest township.? This ? piping? life of the shepherd is, how-
ever, contemned by the cattle-keeper, who, mounted on a spirited
horse, rides for many miles through the bush for the purpose of
collecting the herds. This employment, which has somewhat of
the excitement of the chase, is a very favourite one, not only
with the men, but actually with their masters.
? You know the stockman by his chin-strapped, cabbage-tree hat,
his bearded and embrowned visage, his keen, quiet eye. The symbol
of his peculiar trade is the sheep-whip?a thick but tapering thong
of twelve or fourteen feet, weighing, perhaps, a couple of pounds,
affixed to a handle of a foot and a half at most. At the end of this cruel
lash is a ? cracker,? generally made of a twisted piece of silk handker-
chief. The wilderness echoes for miles with the cracks of this terrible
scourge, which are fully as loud as the report of a gun. ... I have
seen a pewter quart pot all but cut in two by one flank of the sheep-
whip.??Vol. i. p. 315.
Much attention is paid to cattle, and also to horses, many of
which are sent to India, and bring a good price. As there is in
Australia ?no artificial, or stored-up food for winter, or bad
seasons, as in Europe,? and as drought often tries the settler,
there are now ?boiling-down establishments? in most of the pas-
toral districts, where sheep, and sometimes even cattle, are
killed, and the head and fleshy portions being thrown away, the
remainder is chopped in pieces and thrown into large iron vats.

capable of containing from sixteen to twenty-four oxen, or three
times the amount of sheep. In these the fat is boiled out,
skimmed olf into buckets, and poured thence into casks, which are
shipped for England. In 1850 no less than 743,000 sheep and
45,000 cattle were thus sacrificed, producing 160,000 cwt. of
tallow. Alas! that animal food, so great a luxury to thousands
of our countrymen, should have been thus comparatively wasted!
We may mention, ere passing on, that in South Australia, olive
oil is beginning to form an article of trade, and that very suc-
cessful attempts at cultivating the vine have been made in various
parts; indeed, there seems little doubt but that in a few years
Australia, together with her other produce, will supply us with a
very excellent dinner-wine.
Perhaps the most striking proof of the importance of the
Australian wool-trade, as well as of the growing prosperity of the
colony, will be found in the following statistical notes taken
from the Report of the ? Colonial Land and Emigration Com-
missions for 1852.?
?ln 1841 the value of the exports of wool amounted to
517,537/.
? In 1850 it amounted to 1,614,241/.?
Tallow was not exported until 1843, and then between 9000/,
and 10,000/. worth was sent; but, in 1849, this export had risen
to 249,932/., and in 1850 to 300,721.
? The whole number of sheep within the colony in 1849 was
12,102,540.
?ln 1850 the number amounted to 13,059,324.?
Of this number seven millions belonged to Sydney district, and
the remainder to Port Philip.
The number of cattle in 1850 was, in Sydney, rather above
1,500,000; in Port Philip not quite 400,000. From the same
Report we extract the following, which affords a striking picture
of the rapid increase of the colony both in population and in
wealth.
Before quitting this part of our subject we may quote Colonel
Mundy?s intelligent remarks respecting the prospects of the
emigrant agriculturist, or sheep-owner. ? From all I have read
? and observed, the mishaps of the majority of emigrants are
? clearly traceable to the idleness, ignorance, or imprudence of
? the sufferers. Let no one, therefore, embark heedlessly. The
? bush, believe me, is no rose-bush, ?or, if it be, it has its thorns,


* its cares, its fluctuations, its reverses; still, with due care, the
4 majority may fairly expect, if not large fortunes, still a certain
* competence/
Hitherto we have surveyed only the surface of this mighty
continent, but Australia has treasures also hidden deep in the
earth. It was not until 1843, that the mineral wealth of New
South Wales was discovered. As in the case of the gold-mines,
so in respect to the earlier found copper, no one suspected their
existence, except a German geologist named Menge, who per-
sisted that the hills of South Australia were metalliferous, but
whose opinion was treated, not only with incredulity, but with
ridicule. Accident at length verified the geologist?s assertion.
In 1842, the youngest son of Captainï¿½agot, whilst gathering wild
flowers, discovered some pieces of grey slate, strongly tinged with
the green carbonate of copper, and attracted probably by the
brilliancy of its colour, the boy brought one of the pieces home.
Soon after, Mr. Dutton, a neighbouring resident and sheep-
owner, having ascended a little hill, to obtain a view of one of
his distant flocks, was struck with the beauty of what seemed to
be a patch of bright green moss, just at his horse?s feet. He dis-
mounted, but, on closer view, found that it was copper-ore.
Being on intimate terms with Captain Bagot, Mr. Dutton com-
municated his discovery, and then found that his friend?s son, on
a spot hard by, had found a similar piece of ore. Mr. Dutton,
from whose interesting work, South Australia and its Mines,
we have taken the foregoing account, ?together with his friend,
now applied to Government for the purchase of the land?no re-
serves being made in South Australia with regard to minerals?
and at the fixed price of 1/. per acre they purchased eighty,
within which the precious ore was found. Some Cornish miners,
who had fortunately just arrived, were hired, and the Kapunda
mine opened, and its produce during only a part of the first year
amounted to tons of fine copper, which were sold in Eng-
land for 6225/. But other 4 out-croppings,? though less exten-
sive than on the original land, were soon after discovered hard
by. A keen competition was therefore commenced, and a
hundred acres, put up to auction by Government, were pur-
chased, after a sharp contest on the part of Captain Bagot and
our author, at the large price of 2210/. In his table of the average
produce of the various copper-mines in South America, and in Eng-
land and Ireland, Mr. Dutton proves that those of South Australia
hold the highest place. Since the date of Mr. Dutton?s work
(1846) mining operations have been widely extended, the
Burra-Burra mines now taking the lead; and the importance of
this new branch of commerce may be estimated, when we find


in the Report of the Colonial Land and Emigration Commis-
sioners, that while from?] the vicinity of the above-mentioned
mines, 8676 cwt. of copper was shipped in 1849, in 1850 the
shipments rose to 44,594. In addition to this, a small quantity
of lead was also sent.
But interesting and important as these statements might be,
the gold discovery has thrown them wholly into the background,
?indeed, with some people, the whole Australian continent seems
to be considered as worthy of notice only on account of the precious
metal which is drained from her rivers or dug from her mines.
Although the district in which gold was first found has been long
occupied by sheep-stations, or by small settlers, and the gold-bear-
ing earth has been actually tilled, and the gold-bearing stream
used for domestic purposes, still the presence of gold was not dis-
covered until about fifteen months since. The probability that
some portion of the regions of New South Wales were auriferous,
was, however, pointed out by the Rev. Mr. Clark, a resident, as
early as 1841,* and, at the same time. Sir Roderic Murchison, in
Europe, was led to the same conclusion, from a comparison of the
gold-bearing rocks of the Ural Mountains which he had explored
with those of the Eastern Cordillera of Australia. In 1844 ?we
quote from his own note, appended to Colonel Mundy?s work?
* he published, in the fourteenth volume of the Journal of the
? Royal Geographical Society, a comparison between the two
? mountain ranges, and in 1846 recommended the Cornish miners
? who wanted employment to emigrate to New South Wales, and
? there search for gold. In 1848, having received specimens of
c gold from two colonists, he wrote to Earl Grey, referring to the
? former comparison with the Ural mountains, but the minister
e declined to interfere.? After ? the accidental opening of the
golden gravel in California,? Sir Roderic publicly broached on
various occasions the subject of the distribution of gold over the
surface of the globe-; his last and concluding views being put
forth in the article, * Siberia and California,? in the Quarterly
Review, September, 1850. These views, however, as we have
seen, attracted no notice, until, in the early part of last year, Mr.
Hargreaves, a gentleman who had spent nearly two years in
California, returned to New South Wales, and struck by the
* The following remarks of Mr. Clark, in a letter addressed to the Sydney
Morning Herald, 24th May, 1851, are very curious and important:? ? If we look at
* the globe, we shall find that in the longitude of about 149ï¿½ or 150ï¿½ east, extends
* the middle of the meridian chain of Australia, parallel by similar chains, having
? similar axes, in South and in West Australia. Exactly ninety degrees from this
* main Australian chain, occurs the auriferous Ural in 60ï¿½ east; and exactly ninety
* degrees from the same chain occurs the north and south auriferous mountains of
4 California, in 120ï¿½ west. The fourth quadrantal meridian falls along the Atlantic
4 between Brazil and Africa, both auriferous regions.?


similarity of its geological formation and external characteristics,
he determined carefully to examine into it. ? After riding about
? three hundred miles, so as to intersect the country at numerous
* points, and spending two or three months in the prosecution of
{ his object, he discovered gold, and established a company of
4 working miners, at a point of the Summer-hill Creek,? a spot
now known far and wide by its appropriate name, Ophir.
The general character and appearance of the gold district is
well described by Mr. Shilling in his lecture, and from it the
following extract is taken :
? The Australian cordillera run in a line with the coast, and at an
average distance of less than one hundred miles from the shore. Gold
has been found on both sides of these cordilleras, and chiefly in the
smaller streams, and bends of the rivers; but the basin of the Murray
may be said to form the Australian gold field. . . . The very outline
of these hills and mountains, almost without exception rounded, would
make it probable that their surface irregularities have been caused by
detritus, so as to give this peculiar characteristic to the scenery.
Imagine a number of enormous hay-cocks, from 500 to 1500 feet
high, packed as close together as impenetrable substances of such a
shape could be crammed, their steep slopes, covered to the summit
with the thin evergreen?or, rather, ever-brown, bush of Australia,
and you will have a very fair idea of the general appearance of the
gold districts. . . . The locality named Ophir, by Mr. Hargreaves, is
a deep ravine through which flows the Summer-hill Creek from the
lofty Canollus, between 4000 and 5000 feet high, on one side it is
bounded by rocks of quartz, and schist, in some places almost per-
pendicular.?
Colonel Mundy, whose sketches give additional interest to his
work, has afforded us a very picturesque view of Summer-hill
Creek, and also of the Ophir mines. The next spot where gold
was discovered was on the Turon River, from whence it was stated
that small portions had been taken years before; indeed Colonel
Mundy tells us that so far back as 1823, a convict of an ironed
gang, working on the roads near Bathurst, was flogged for having
in his possession a lump of rough gold, which the officer naturally
enough imagined must have been the product of watches or
trinkets, stolen and melted down. Sofala is the name given to
this station; it is situated in the valley that forms the bed of
that Pactolus of Australia, the Turon. These ?diggings,? Colonel
Mundy also visited.
ï¿½ As we topped the last of a series of small hills, which I thought
interminable, ray companion suddenly said, ? Stop, and listen.? I
pulled up my horse, and heard, as I imagined, the rushing of a mighty
cataract. ?lt is the cradles,? said he. And so it was, ?the grating


of the gravel or rubble, on the metal sifter of five hundred rockers!
I shall not easily forget the impression made on me by this singular
acoustic effect. Looking down into that wild mountain glen, it was
almost incredible that this ceaseless crash could be produced by human
beings, not one of whom was visible. Presently, as we descended upon
the creek, tents, huts, and every other kind of temporary tabernacle
were descried dotting the slopes and levels. . . . The camps are never
entirely deserted, for one of every company remains at the hut, cook-
ing, washing, and keeping guard in the absence of his mates. I saw
no women, except a few ? gins ? (native blacks), at the mines,?this is
one of the most odious peculiarities of the gold-digging population.??
Our Antipodes, vol. iii. p. 373.
Near the Wallabi Rocks, the scene is very beautiful.
? As I despaired of preserving the shadow of an impression of it by
effect of pencil, so do I feel my pen equally powerless; for a first-rate
colourist, who had passed a life in the close study of nature, could
have produced but a faint image of the swelling sea of mountain-
forest lying before and below us: hill beyond hill, as far as sight could
range, and the devious course of the invisible Turon, distinctly
traced by a motionless wreath of smoke from the bivouacs, sleeping
on the mists of the river, and carrying the eye of the spectator along
until it rested on the face of the Wallabi rocks, just illumined by the
morning sun, which threw over it a veil of golden gauze. The land-
scape was truly lovely,?an epithet rarely to be applied to gold-
mining regions.??vol. iii. p. 384.
But amid the new excitement and general good fortune, at
that early period?August, 1851, of the gold diggers, Colonel
Mundy bears testimony to the injurious influence of this dream.
He found no merriment among them, no cheerfulness.
* I found it no easy task to get into conversation with them,?
he says. ? Some appeared sullen from disappointment; few communi-
cative on the subject of their gains, and all imbued with the spirit of
independence and equality natural in a community where all were living
and labouring on the same terms. The miners, I observed, looked
haggard and weather-worn about the face; but I fancy this jaded look
proceeded rather from intense mental excitement, than from bodily
hardship. More than one started when I asked them if they did not
dream of gold at night; and admitted, with apparent shame, that not
only did gold form the main subject of many a troubled night-mare,
but that, in spite of excessive fatigue, involuntary thoughts on the
same theme robbed them of the rest absolutely necessary to recruit
their strength for the morrow?s labour.? ?vol. iii. p. 352.
At the time when Colonel Mundy left, the gold mines in
Victoria had not been discovered. Mr. Shilling only describes
them from report; but from his statement it appears that these
mines are richer than the earlier found ones. Buningong was

the first discovered: it is about forty miles from Geelong, and
is on the edge of an open forest, in the midst of a beautiful agri-
cultural country. Mount Alexander is more north, and there as
is the case in New South Wales, it seems that the richest yield of
gold is obtained from a stratum of blue clay, found at a depth of
from two to nine feet. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, ac-
curately to ascertain the amount of gold obtained from the
Australian mines. The account up to December last, according
to the Report of the ? Colonial Land and Emigration Commis-
sioners,? gives 464,668/. 15s. as the value of the gold shipped
from Sydney to England, while the rough estimate of gold raised
in Victoria between August Ist and December 6th, 1851, is thus
given:?
When we contemplate statements like the foregoing, we are
less disposed to be astonished at, however we may lament, the
extravagant dreams, which these unexpected gold discoveries
have led so many to indulge in. Above a million of money
value, sent from Australia in less than half a year, and all in
the form of gold,?bright, precious gold. No wonder that the
eager, the excitable, all those who would c make haste to be
rich,? should be ready to bid farewell to friends and country, and
set off for this new El Dorado. But be it remembered that
the Australian wool-trade alone, amid the dearth of labourers,
yielded in 1850, a result of a million and a half, and that the
wool and tallow together, amounted to more than two million!
As to the profits of gold-digging to the miners themselves,
this seems to be a question involved in great difficulties. Colonel
Mundy, who visited them during the first excitement, and who
takes a more favourable view than Mr. Shilling, bears testimony
to the exaggerated stories even then current. The many mar-
vellous tales of the earnings of the miners which found their way
into the papers, were, he remarks, unfounded; and their effect
was to unsettle the minds of credulous hearers and readers, who,
believing that Aladdin?s lamp was only waiting for them to rub it,
gave up steady employment for gold hunting, and thereby too


often abandoned solid substance for a vain shadow. It is im-
possible to form a correct idea of the earnings at Ophir. ? Ten
shillings a day was pretty generally named as the average,? but
this he considers too low. But what is 3/. per week, as the
remuneration for the wear and tear, bodily and mental, of gold
digging? That great bodily labour is demanded?great, we
mean, to the middle and higher classes, and those unaccustomed
to active employment, we have the testimony of Mr. Shilling,
a practical man, who expressly states, that although ? nothing
? perhaps to navvies, and strong men, it is insurmountable by the
? sedentary and weak.? His estimate of the average remunera-
tion is lower than Colonel Mundy?s, although ?we can only sur-
? mise their gains from the accounts of the diggers themselves.
? Now there have been numerous failures at all the diggings,?
? even at Mount Alexander. The average earnings of the first
? 400 at Ophir, appear to have been about 10s. a day, but their
? success was most unequal. Mr. Forbes gives it as his opinion
? that where one gets 20/. or 30/., fifty earn 10s. a day, and
c forty-nine scarcely their rations. Later still, a newspaper cor-
? respondent estimates the average earnings at 21. per week, and
? says no one would set it above 3/.; few rated the average
? earnings at the Turon above 1/. a week.? In other parts, scores
were not earning even their rations. At Mount Alexander, some
estimate it to have been atone time as high as 3/. a day per man,
but the Commissioner, at the same time puts it at from 15s. to
30s. Indeed, as Mr. Shilling truly remarks, ?
? Isolated facts, accounts of individual success, create undue impres-
sions; people are apt to forget the oblivion that attends failure, in
reading the glowing accounts of one suddenly enriched Com-
paring all the accounts, it seems probable, that at a time when the
mail and weekly escort were bringing down between 5000 and 6000
ounces weekly, the number engaged in mining operations approached
at least 25,000.? ?
Now, let us take the weekly supply of gold at its maximum of
6000 ounces, and the miners at only 24,000, and we shall divide
but a quarter of an ounce of gold weekly among them, ?that is
rather more than 165., allowing for the highest price which has
been given for gold at Sydney, 31. ss. 3d., ?for six days hard
labour, where the cost of mere living,?that is, broiled mutton,
damper, and tea, is at least 15s. a week. We have therefore
little doubt that these gold diggings after all are veritable lot-
teries ; a few enormous prizes, like the 30,000/. so temptingly
displayed in large capitals at the head of the old lottery bills,
and represented in this case by Dr. Kerr?s enormous ? Hundred


Weight,? and the more apocryphal ? Nugget,? said to have
weighed 1300 ounces?set over against the thousand losers,
concerning whose unfortunate reverses nobody ever heard.
We may remark here, that ?
<As by far the largest supply of gold has been procured from the
banks and beds of rivers flowing through accumulated masses of debris,
either torn from the mountain side by some convulsion of nature, or
brought down by the floods of past ages, even although a hundred
weight has been found in the matrix, at one spot, it would be assum-
ing more than we have any foundation for doing, to say that gold may
be found anywhere, concentrated in large quantities, since every cir-
cumstance rather tends to prove that it has existed but rarely in
masses, or at any rate, that these have been so broken up in the
course of ages, and disseminated amongst the debris of the mountains,
that it is now almost hopeless to search for matrix gold.?*
And thus we find that no second huge masses of gold have been
found; but even the most sanguine advocates of gold digging
are compelled to content themselves with reports of the dis-
covery of far smaller pieces, or a plentiful yield of gold dust.
Mr. Shilling gives numerous instances of the great uncer-
tainty of success. The best ? claim? on the Turon, sold for 900/.,
and the purchaser, during two days? trial, got 160/. towards the
purchase-money. Another ?claim? sold for 700/., but although
seven pounds were found one day, and eight pounds the next,
it did not eventually repay the buyer. While one party of
miners gained 1500/. in less than five weeks, many others
obtained scarcely a bare subsistence; and yet, he says, ?to see
ï¿½ them toiling at their miserable task, delving away like madmen,
? carrying huge bags of soil to be washed, you w'ould fancy?such
ï¿½ w T as the infatuation even of the wretched losers?that they were
ï¿½ making their fortunes, and almost breaking their necks to make
ï¿½it soon.? Mr. Shilling?s final opinion indeed is, ? that it is very
? questionable whether the gross yield of the mines has as yet
< equalled the expense incurred in consequence of their dis-
< covery;? an opinion which we are well aware will be keenly
controverted by some, but which has certainly strong statistical
arguments to support it.
Among our contemporaries, this ? dream of gold? has awakened
many speculations; while the daily press teems with theories
and suggestions as to what is to be done with the mass of sur-
plus gold, which will ere long, as they believe, flow in upon us.
The Daily News, in a leader, some time since, suggested the great
impulse which would be given to ? art manufacture,? if ornaments
of ? precious glittering gold? should find a place in our drawing-

rooms, instead of alabaster vases, and ormolu clocks and cande-
labra. There is, however, little probability of this wholesale
employment of gold; but should its supply greatly increase, we
think it would scarcely be unlikely that silver might take its
place as the most valuable. While gold has been discovered in
so many new regions, the supply of silver has scarcely increased
beyond the regular demand, and we can imagine many stranger
things than that the second precious metal might eventually be-
come the first. Among some of the nations of antiquity a
species of fine brass was, we know, more highly prized for
ornaments than gold itself; and the almost priceless value of
the Corinthian metal is familiar to every reader. Now, let silver
become scarce in proportion as gold becomes plentiful, and the
personal ornaments and the more costly plate will be made of
the paler metal. When last year we contemplated that gorgeous
and beautiful display of 4 vessels of gold and silver? in the Great
Exhibition, we were forcibly struck with the actual superiority,
in delicate beauty, of the silver plate. The chaste richness of
the polished surface contrasting with, and throwing out the
delicate pearly whiteness of the frosted portions; and the pure
e no colour,? of the dead silver, so admirably adapted to give
effect to the minutest touches, impressed us most forcibly, as we
believe it did more competent judges, with the great superiority
of silver.
These remarks, however, are but in parenthesis,?for the
probability of this excessive supply of gold is, indeed, a very re-
mote contingency. Neither the produce of the Californian mines
nor of the Australian have, up to the present time, much lowered
the price of gold; and even should they continue to yield their
precious stores in an abundance sufficient to meet the expecta-
tions of the most sanguine, we must bear in mind that gold has
attractions for every nation, and that from the east, and west, and
farthest north, thousands will press to the gold fields. The latest
news from California has told us, that a continual stream of
population was setting in from China towards that region of gold;
and advices from Sydney inform us how the American diggers
from California are entering her port by hundreds, doubtless
soon to be followed by the Chinese, who, timid and plodding as
they appear, possess great perseverance and industry; and, as
we are informed both by Dr. Bowring, and Mr. White, ?who as
the agent for free labour in the West Indies, had ample oppor-
tunities for forming his opinion?possess also a spirit of com-
bination, which, under certain conditions, render them even
formidable.
To determine what is to be the effect upon prices of a con-


siderable addition to the stock of precious metals now existing
in the world, is matter of extreme difficulty. In this case, the
lights of the past are dim, obscure, and deceptive. We know,
indeed, in the gross, that the discovery and opening out of the
gold and silver mines of Mexico and Peru, during the early part
of the sixteenth century, did at length, after a series of years,
greatly lower the value of these metals, and caused a slow and
gradual rise of prices, which hardly ceased even in the eighteenth;
but how much was actually due to the additional coin in circula-
tion, and how much to other economic causes, it is hard to say.
To fix, with anything like certainty, the value of the money of
Henry VII. and Henry VIH. seems impossible. It is well
known that the coinage was then debased to a considerable
extent; but there exist no means for ascertaining, with any
certainty, whether the debased coin passed generally at its
nominal or its real value, or at some rate between a nominal and
a real value. If we take as a criterion the rental of the kingdom,
as ascertained about that time, we must lean to the conclusion
that a rise in prices had taken place in consequence of the
debasement of the current money, of which the subsequent rise
caused by the real depreciation of the precious metals themselves
towards the end of Henry?s reign, was only a sort of continuation.
Taking, however, the value of money in the fifteenth century at
as high a rate as can by possibility be admitted, it is still clear
that the depreciated value of money at the present day cannot
be attributed solely to any addition, made since, to the stock
of gold and silver existing in the world. To account for it, we
must refer to the various modes of economising the use of coin,
which have been invented during the interval, ?to the use of
bills of exchange, bank notes, goldsmiths? receipts, government
securities, and cheques upon banks, ?by all of which the uses
of metallic coins have been much narrowed, and their value
depreciated.
It has been estimated, by persons who have taken pains to put
together such vague evidence as exists with regard to this point,
that the stock of gold and silver now existing in the world in
the shape of money is about 400,000,000/. sterling, of which
more than half is silver. This is probably under the mark.
There seems reason to believe, that the money, as well as the
population of China and its dependencies, where a silver currency
has existed from time immemorial, is underrated, whilst that of
Europe and other portions of the Asiatic continent is not over-
rated. Hence, to produce any sensible effect upon this mass,
the addition in the shape of actual coin must be very great; and
if this addition be of gold coin, there exist causes to neutralise


that effect. In calculating the effect of an addition to the stock
of gold in circulation, we must always consider that, save and
except in England, silver is the practical standard. Hence, in
those countries where paper money is little used, and sound
principles of currency have prevailed, gold bears a premium. , or
agio. Persons who w T ant it in preference to silver, are obliged
to pay this premium in order to obtain it. Thus, therefore, the
first effect of an addition to the gold money of the world will
only be to destroy this agio. The next effect will be, to alter
the relative value of silver and gold, and send the former out of
circulation, by making it pass (as money) for less than it is worth,
as compared with the gold coins. Neither of these phenomena
have, however, yet occurred; although the agio has been, we
believe, affected somewhat.
It has been usual with persons who are inclined to speculate
sanguinely and rashly upon the probable effects of the additions
to our stock of gold now making in California and Australia, to
assume some annual quantity as added, and then reason upon it
as if this was all that the question involved. This is very hasty
logic, and is inadmissible by any person who calmly considers all
the modern bearings of this curious question. In the first place,
it must always be considered, that no sort of parallel can be
drawn between the effect of the influx of gold and silver during
the sixteenth century, and that of a similar influx now. At that
time, coinage was used in effecting all payments, great and
small. The modes of economising the use of money by means
of bills, notes, and cheques for large transfers, were unknown.
Plence, as the gold and silver flowed in from Spanish America,
and was dispersed over Europe, it was immediately coined, with
the exception of such portion as was applied to the arts and the
purposes of luxury, in the shape of plate, gold and silver lace,
chains, gilded ornaments, and other similar appliances. Nor
must it be deemed that this, even at the commencement of the
sixteenth century, was at all inconsiderable. Those conversant
with the statutes of the Plantagenets and Tudors, (which cannot
deceive us), know how widely spread the use of gold and silver
lace was, at that time, in England, as well as of articles of plate,
notwithstanding the great value of the precious metals up to that
era. As the metals depreciated, this general appetite for plate
increased, and went on until the civil wars, under the Stuarts,
dislocated the whole ancient framework of civil society in Eng-
land, relieved the landlords from their feudal burthens, and
threw them upon industry, and gradually sapped the indepen-
dence which, after the destruction of feudal villeinage, the in-
dustrious classes of this country enjoyed. Of the existence of this

general ease and competence, there cannot be any doubt Wbat
says the old song ? an excellent, because a simple witness, ?
? We took not such delight,
In cups of silver fine;
None under strain of knight
In plate drank beer and wine.
JSow, each mechanical man.
Hath a cupboard of plate for show,
Which was a rare thing then,
When this old cap was new.?
This quaint ballad was certainly written prior to 1660, pro-
bably much sooner than that. It is a true portrait of the mode of
English life in this particular about that period.
Thus, then, whatever additions may now be making to the
quantities of the precious metals, as we have intimated, we must
always take into account that large portions will be consumed
by the luxurious in all nations. Mr. Jacob and others who have
gone into this question, have estimated the quantity of gold and
silver employed in the service of luxury and the arts, in the
shape of gold and silver plate, watches, ornaments, mountings,
and gilding, as being nearly equal to that employed as current
money. Without putting too much stress on data so vague as
those upon which these conclusions are founded, it is yet very
certain that large deductions must be made under this head \
and these must increase should any considerable depreciation of
the metals, in course of time, be brought about.
There are, in any event, however, sufficient reasons for con-
cluding, that great delay must take place before the phenomena
of depreciation really become apparent and palpable. In the
first place, it must be recollected that, at present, in various
countries a large portion of the circulating medium consists of
paper, for which, in case of an extraordinary supply, the precious
metals must, in all probability, be gradually substituted. This
is the case in England at this moment. The Australian do-
minions are saturated also with a base paper cunency, now
almost destitute of credit. This is also the case with Russia,
where the paper ruble , in point of value, bears the same propor-
tion to the silver ruble that four shillings do to a sovereign. In the
United States, there still exists a huge circulation of base paper,
always at an open discount, varying from clay to day, the fluctua-
tions of which have caused mischief unspeakable in that other-
wise prosperous country; and in Sweden, a depreciated papei
currency has been pushed to an extent absolutely ludicrous.
These monstrosities it is now probable time may correct. In
England and the United States, the paper currency in circulation
exists merely for the profit of bankers, and not for the convent-


ence of the public, which, in point of fact, it often exposes, in
both countries, to great danger. When a mass of paper-money,
convertible into gold or silver on demand, exists, depending alto-
gether upon some inadequate reserves of coin and bullion in the
vaults of a bank, great danger must, from the fluctuations of
commerce, periodically ensue. This we saw exemplified here as
lately as in 1847; and in the United States, in 1836, scenes
even of a worse description than those witnessed in England in
1847 occurred. If, then, there is to exist, in either of these
countries, a government composed of men deserving the name of
statesmen, we may anticipate coming ameliorations of these false
and dangerous systems of fictitious currency. In the American
States, the people are spontaneously bringing this about bv the
substitution of a circulation of gold"eagles in lieu of discredited
paper. In England, where the management of the floating paper
is infinitely better than in the North American Republic, the
value of the paper circulation is fully maintained. But this
circulation, being in exchangeable value at par with gold, per-
forms no function for the ?public which a metallic money would
not accomplish equally well; whilst, on certain occasions, such
as those of 1847, 1839, and 1825, it exposes the public to perils
indescribable.
Unless, therefore, it is to be a maxim with British states-
men, that the private emoluments of bankers are to be pre-
ferred to the public safety, the time appears to be approaching
when a further extension of the metallic basis of our national
currency ought to be gradually brought about, by calling in
and cancelling all bank notes for sums below ten pounds, and
putting a gold coinage in the place of these notes. To this no
really wise banker ought to object. It might, in some degree,
dimmish that profit which he derives from his fictitious circula-
tion ; but, whilst it did this, it would remunerate him, by render-
ing his operations in the aggregate much more secure. If we
review the ruin inflicted upon all connected with banks by the
monetary crashes of 1825-6, 1839, and 1847, we shall at once
come to the conclusion, that had these catastrophes been miti-
gated or prevented, as they would have been by the prior with-
drawal of all notes for sums under ten pounds, their body would
have been largely benefited. To suppose, as some have done,
that such an alteration as this involves any infraction of rio-hts, is
perfectly preposterous. Men unquestionably have a right to
exercise the calling of a banker, if they deem it their interest
so to do. I hat is to say, capitalists have a right to make an
interest of their monied capitals, by temporary loans on certain
descriptions of floating security. But surely the right to lend
s 2


money does not include the right to lend a fictitious money, or
to make a profit bv substituting one sort of paper security for
another sort. This sort of banking must be governed by public
convenience ; and if the public safety require its diminution, it
may be diminished without the slightest infraction of individual
rights. That, both in England and in the United American
States, such a diminution would be a vast national benefit, does
not, in our opinion, admit of a moment?s doubt.
Quitting this portion of the question, there remains for consi-
deration another obstacle to the production of any depreciating
effect upon the currency of Europe to arise from the additions
now making to the precious metals, and more especially from the
influx of gold. All the habits of the classes now dealing in money
in European countries, (and to Europe the metals mostly find
their first way,) are opposed to this depreciation. It must
always be borne in mind that, to depreciate a circulating me-
dium, the fresh accessions of precious metal must first take the
shape of coins, and be circulated from hand to hand, supported
also by an increase of the smaller and meaner coins. Thus to
depreciate, for instance, the money of Great Britain, we should
require a large addition of sovereigns in circulation, supported
by an adequate and commensurate addition to the silver and
copper coinage, and upon this might be founded an increase of
paper securities. But the individual dealer in money does not
reason in this way. He looks only at immediate interest, imme-
diate safety, and immediate convenience. He is aware, too, if
he understands the laws which govern the article in which he
deals, that any depreciation of this sort, brought about in one
country, cannot possibly continue unless it also be brought
about simultaneously in all the countries with which the first has
any intercourse, direct or indirect. In short, he knows that a
depreciation of money, by an addition of coined precious metal,
must be slow and gradual, and extend everywhere. Hence
dealers in money never contemplate this as individuals; nor
does such a supposition influence their actions. If, for instance,
a merchant importing gold bullion lodges it with the Bank of
England as a part of his account with that establishment, the
directors do not send it to the Mint to be coined, and with those
coins pay any cheques which the merchant may draw upon them.
This would not suit their purpose. They let the bullion lie in
their vaults and pay the merchant?s cheques by means of their
own notes, waiting some opportunity profitably to part with bul-
lion so paid in. Hence that bullion is never coined. It, in due
time, passes into the hands of some other merchant who has
occasion to export it, and to obtain it he exchanges bills for it,


paying the Bank the discount. Thus, therefore, although gold
and silver bullion in the hands of bankers may help to foster
certain speculations, and to render floating capital more plen-
tiful, they do not tend in the least to depreciate the circulating
money of the country. They are not coined and put into the
hands of retail dealers in the last degree. But unless this be
done, though they may make floating capital more easy, no de-
preciation of actual currency takes place; the two things being
as distinct as it is possible for any two things to be.
Taking all these considerations into account, our general con-
clusion is, that the immediate effects apprehended from such
accessions to our stocks of gold and silver as are now taking place,
are exaggerated, and by some very highly 7. These additions
have now been going on for some years, and yet the effect
produced upon the money of the world is so minute as to be
hardly appreciable. The obstacles which we have described
stand in the way of the depreciation apprehended; and thus far
they have prevented it. Our opinion is that these apprehen-
sions may continue to exist for a length of time, without being
accompanied or followed by the consequences apprehended. It
is probable that a large mass of the proceeds of California and
Australia will, instead of being coined in Europe, find its way
to remote parts of the globe, to China, to India, and other semi-
civilized Asiatic countries, and there be used to administer to
luxury rather than to increase the circulating money of these
countries. Some such conclusion as this w 7 as evidently arrived
at, by the committee which was appointed by the French assembly
to inquire into the causes of a temporary alteration in the value
of silver which then took place; and their general view is pro-
bably the correct one. Since the period of their e Assignats' and
?Mandats,? and the enormous mischiefs caused by the fluctu-
ations and discredit of these instruments, the French philoso-
phers have keenly investigated all the phenomena of circulating
money, and their conclusions as to all matters of this nature are
generally to be relied upon.
Such is the view which our experience, as far as it has yet
gone, seems to confirm ; and in that view we are inclined, for the
present, to rest.
A more important point, however, than the gold, is the ques-
tion ?how shall a sufficient number of hands be obtained, and
swiftly enough, for the exigencies of this most important colony?
It may seem at first sight strange, that while the tide of emigra-
tion has of late years been setting in so strongly toward the
West, the great advantages of Australia should have been com-
paratively neglected. In 1850, only 15,938 persons having gone


thither. Even last year 21,532 was the whole amount of emi-
grants to New South Wales, while British North America received
42,605, and the United States 267,357. But the reason of
this, as the Colonial Land Emigration Commissioners?from
whose report the foregoing statement is taken?truly remark, is,
the shortness and consequent cheapness of the voyage to America,
the expense of transmission to Australia being six times as great.
It has therefore been found necessary for the government to
proffer large assistance to persons emigrating thither, and various
benevolent persons have formed societies for the same praise-
worthy purpose. Unfortunately, in too many instances a due
selection of emigrants has not been made, and the idle, the care-
less, the unpersevering, have been sent to a land, where, although
plenty awaits the industrious, the Scriptural rule is most strongly
enforced, ?lf any will not work, neither should he eat.? ? The
* persons most out of employment here,? says the ? Report of the
Labour Office, Victoria, July 10,1851,? ?are those who never ought
?to have come. Farming and mining are the staple employments,
? and these are not overdone; but care must be taken by philan-
* thropic individuals, only to send such as can labour hard for their
? living. Bush work is no child?s play, and masters who have to
* work hard for their own living desire that their workmen should
?be able to endure hard work also. Women, too, who know
c nothing of house work, and the duties of a family, are very unfit
* to be sent here.?
But although workers are emphatically required, there seems
to be much work which might be done by men and women far
advanced in years beyond the government standard. Sheep-
keeping and sheep-shearing, might be undertaken by com-
paratively aged men, if already accustomed to that species of
employment; while the easy duties of the hut-keeper, could be
fulfilled by equally aged women; and thus the more laborious
pursuits of farming or of domestic life be left to the younger
men and women. We are gratified to find that attention has
been pointed to this feature of the Australian ? bush? life; for it
will go far to encourage what seems to us a desideratum in
colonization, especially on a large scale ?-family emigration.
So emphatically is it the law of nature, that the human race
should be classed in families, we cannot but trace the failure
of many an otherwise well-conducted scheme to the neglect
of this great rule. Surely while the bold heart and the strong
arm of youth are requisite, the cooler judgment, the lengthened
experience of mature years are not without their value ; while
with how much more cheerfulness will the severer labours of the


colonist be undertaken, when he feels that although far distant
from his native land, his family,?wife, children, father, mother,
brethren, are still around him. It is on this account that Mrs.
Chisholm?s plan of family colonization is so deserving of ap-
proval; and its superior advantages seem to have induced the
conductors of that large scheme of emigration from the High-
lands and Islands of Scotland, to adopt a similar plan. Indeed,
as Colonel Phipps truly remarks in his letter to Sir C. Tre-
velyan, ? it really seems that what are usually considered the pro-
? hibitory clogs to emigration, the old and the very young, would
ï¿½ now be most useful as forming anchors, by which a family would
? be held to a rural home, with plenty of space and plenty of
?food.? . _ . '
Meanwhile emigration to the antipodes is increasing. During
the first quarter of the present year 7085 took their passage to
Australia, while in April 4173 followed; and we doubt not
when the reports of the two succeeding months appear, we shall
find that a still larger number have sailed. But while thousands
are thus quitting our shores, what have we as Congregationalists
been doing for the hundreds of our own people who have left,
or are about to leave us? The church of England is active,
openlv active; the church of Rome is, alas! most perseveringly
and insidiously active; but have we, whose fathers sent the
Mayflower across the then almost unknown Atlantic, with her
precious freight of bold, true-hearted Christian men, ?have we
chartered a single vessel in which brethren bound to a far more
distant coast could find congenial society, and join together
from Sabbath to Sabbath in their old accustomed worship?
Surely somewhat ought to be done; surely those principles
which our fathers bequeathed to their children as a goodly
heritage, are worthy transmission to this yet more newly found
world; surely, looking with blameless exultation on those noble
states founded by our pilgrim fathers two hundred and thirty
years ago, we ought to arouse ourselves to the work now, and
send forth our brethren with aid, and counsels, and heartiest
prayers, to found, perchance, another Hew England on the
shores of the far Pacific.
We had written thus far, when we saw in the Times of July 7,
the most recent reports relative to the gold discoveries, contained
in the despatches sent by Mr. Latrobe, Lieutenant-Governor of
Victoria. From these it appears that the diggings are still very
productive, and ?the gold fever,? as might be expected, more
violent than ever. The total amount of gold shipped for England
down to the Bth of January last, was 362,975 ounces, and Mr.


Latrobe declares, that he ?can contemplate no limits to the dis-
coveries. 5 * This may appear a very attractive prospect; but
what shall we say to the almost utter disorganization of society
which has been its purchase-price ? ? Clerks, public servants,
gaolers, constables,, resigning their situations ; 5 the post-master
apprehending a total interruption of his important functions;
? the superintendent of the penal stockade, 5 announcing the re-
signation of his constabulary ; even the surgeon of the lunatic
asylum, ? more needed now than ever, 5 is his emphatic remark,
fearing lest the attendants would throw up their situations; and,
meanwhile, rent advancing 50 per cent., clothes, and articles of
domestic use 100 per cent., meat selling at four times the usual
price, and bread risen from s d. to Is. B d, the loaf! Truly the
? curse of gold 5 is beginning to work. Would that the thousands
now pouring in upon these shores may take the lesson so vividly
placed before their eyes, and labour for the slower but certain
gains of pasturage, agriculture, or traffic, rather than the preca-
rious, the lottery-like rewards of the ? gold diggings. 5
A strangely fascinating power has this dream of gold. All
ages have testified to its resistless influence; and all ages, too,
have borne witness to the delusive nature of its rewards. But
again and again must the lesson be taught, and yet again and
again will successive generations, at the risk of life itself, seek
for what is, after all, not wealth itself, but its mere arbitrary
representative. What is so unproductive as gold? From the
period it is dug from the mine, or drained from the river-bed, it
undergoes, unlike the inferior metals, a constant process of de-
terioration. Look at lead and tin, ?manufactured in countless
ways, their value is wonderfuMy increased; look at iron,?iron,
the cheapest of metals! and yet who shall calculate its eventual
? Iron supplies the road along which our merchandise
must travel, the vessels that bring our colonial produce to our
shores, and the engines, and the looms, and the thousand forms
of ingenious machinery which turn the raw material, worth the
fraction of a farthing a pound, into fabrics worth many guineas;
nay, the metal itself, wrought into steel, becomes literally
?worth its weight in gold; 5 while ?the precious metal 5 passes
* This, it may perhaps be suggested, remains to be proved. Certain is it that
gold mines have never hitherto been found equally productive with those of the
inferior metals. Throughout Europe there are copper and iron mines that have
been worked for centuries, and still yield well. Cornwall, more than two
thousand years ago, was visited by the Phoenicians for lead and tin, and lead and
tin are still found there. But what has become of the gold mines of antiquity??
of the middle ages? Even those discovered in America, how greatly diminished
is their yield. At this moment, what ancient gold mine is there still being worked?
The chief supply of gold for Europe is now actually drawn from the mines in the
Ural mountains, undiscovered twenty years ago.


from hand to hand, losing its brightness, diminishing in weight,
the mere symbol of that productive labour which is wealth in
reality.
And thus it is that the united testimony of history and travel
proves, that an abundance of the precious metals is quite com-
patible with great national destitution. The half-clad, meanly
fed Hindoo, wears bracelets and bangles; and half-starved
women, toiling in ill-cultivated fields, look gay with their gold
earrings and nose-jewels. In Bombay alone, we have been
told, on good authority, that the gold and silver ornaments
worn by the natives there are most probably worth jive million
pounds ! And yet, save among a few enterprising Parsees, where
is the native w T ealth ? Thus, our fathers came to talk of India as a
land of untold wealth ; and so it was, but not to the inhabitants,
wearers indeed of costly jewellery, but living on a pittance of rice,
and earning three farthings a day, but to the enterprising European,
who repaired to the land where gold, and gems, and labour were
alike cheap; and bringing back the produce of that land to
Europe, where gold, and gems, and labour were far dearer, pro-
fited by the exchange.
Thus, if we look at the history of the world, we shall find that
the gold producing countries have never been the wealthiest or
the mightiest. Tyre, that ( queen among the nations,? did not own
the mines of Ophir, she only bartered her manufactures for their
produce; imperial Rome conquered gold regions indeed, but
never obtained wealth by gold finding. And then, approaching
modern times, how emphatic is the example of Spain. During
the earlier period of the middle ages, the Christian kingdoms of
Spain held high standing among thtfnations of Europe. Castile,
Leon, Arragon, more wealthy, more civilized; far in advance of
their northern neighbours were they, and they possessed, too,
proud political rights. But the discovery of Peru completed what
the expulsion of the Moors had only begun ; and, before the close
of the sixteenth century, Spain found, in her declining prosperity,
her lowered political standing, her actual poverty, ? the curse of
gold.? And the people that confronted Spain so boldly, and
became so powerful, so wealthy, what was their land ? mere
wastes, actually reclaimed from the sea, yielding nought save
to the most careful cultivation; and yet Holland, during the
seventeenth century, stood proudly among the nations, wealthier,
far wealthier than Spain with her gold mines, wealthy through
agriculture and commerce alone. We might point to England,
too; wealthy by her manufactures, her commerce, her iron
mines, far more valuable than gold; to America, rising steadily
in prosperity, long before California and its golden dream were


heard of, ?indeed, the history of every prosperous community
bears witness to the fact, remarked by a late writer in this Review,
(No. XXIX. p. 109), ?that the acquiring the material means of
? enjoyment without vigorous exertion, seems contrary to the
? economical laws of the universe.? Indeed, persevering labour,
whether in the field, the factory, or the counting-house, is the
only legitimate road to wealth.
Would that the multitudes that are each day pressing toward
our ports might be warned in time, and awaken from that de-
lusive dream of ? gold, gold, nothing but gold,? and turn their
attention rather to the boundless capabilities of the land of their
adoption ; ?to the soil, that will yield them ? thirty, sixty, and a
hundred fold;? to the flocks, whose increase has been, and will
yet be, almost incalculable; to the trade which the wool,
and the various agricultural produce will ere long open up to
them?to all those rich and varied resources of a land which, in
the emphatic language of Scripture, has been truly described as
* a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
? pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey; a land where
? thou shall eat bread without scarceness. Thou shalt not lack
? anything in it.?
