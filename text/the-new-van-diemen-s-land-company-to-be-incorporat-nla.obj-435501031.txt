and it is in contemplation to leave the nomination of such,
as far as practicable, in the hands of the Patrons of the
Company.
In. submitting to you the programme of the various pro-
posed operations of this Company, the aid of your counsel
and opinion upon the important subjects to which it refers
is respectfully invited; and, as an essential element in the
success of the project is an influential and distinguished sup-
port, I am desired to express a hope that its philanthropic
character will ensure the addition of your name to the list of
Patrons, on whom no responsibility will rest.
I have the honour to remain,
Your most obedient servant,
JAMES BURT, Hon. Sec.

Abolition of The announcement made during* the last Session of Parliament that Government had decided upon the

Transpor- immediate abolition of transportation to Van Diemen’s Land, would in ordinary times have been looked upon as
an important concession to the urgent representations of the Colonists; but, measured in relation to its influence on
the ultimate destination of thousands of the persons now seeking a home in Australia, the removal of the penal
establishment from Yan Diemen’s Land is the inauguration of an era of social and political advancement to the
Colony.
Description Yan Diemen’s Land, the u granary of Australia,” has a surface about equal to that of Ireland, and is
of Colony, situated within a few hours sail of Melbourne. The climate, however, is not only more congenial to European
constitutions, but its geographical position, and its ever-flowing* rivers and streams, render it free from the
“droughts and scorching heats” to which other parts of Australia are subjected. While the natural fertility
of the soil, the valuable timber and minerals with which it abounds, present unquestionable opportunities for the
successful employment of labour and capital in their adaptation to the requirements of civilisation.
Objects and The New Yan Diemen’s Land Company is formed for the purpose of purchasing, leasing, clearing, and
Operations, dealing in Land ; manufacturing potash ; collecting bark; sawing and preparing timber; and of producino-
Corn, Provisions,, Tallow, and Wool, for sale and exportation; and of ultimately locating permanently on their
Territory the emigrants to be sent out by this Company.
The usual powers will be taken to enable the Company, when desirable, to open and work mines of Coal, or
other Minerals; to quarry for Stone, Lime, and Clay; to make Bricks and Tiles, and to build Docks, Wharves,
Warehouses, and Dwellings.
Company’s The Company’s proposed Territory is situated in the fertile Yalley of the river Huon, about fifty miles from
Territory. Hobart Town, the capital of the Colony, and comprises an area of fifteen square miles of virgin land, having a
frontage upwards of three miles in depth on that well known river, which is navigable by vessels of laro*e
burthen.
“ The soil of the whole Huon Yalley,” says Strzelecki, “ is derived from the disintegration of greenstone,
trachyte, and greywacke. It produces the most beautiful and valuable timber in the island, the trees exceeding
200 feet in height, and sometimes measuring in circumference 36 feet. Crops of wheat and potatoes succeid
surprisingly.” —Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land, p. 486.
The Property in question, however, in addition to its natural fertility, is near the richest Coal-fields of the
Colony; and presents such facilities for water carriage, that vessels of considerable tonnage may at all seasons
approach the Company’s wharf. Thus combining, not only every possible requisite for the successful development
of their operations, but enabling the Company to command a regular and expeditious access to the best markets
in the world for the sale of their produce.
The cost of acquiring this Territory, and of conveying there 500 emigrants, will not exceed £15,000,
including a right of pre-emption to about 100,000 acres of pasture land, well adapted for, and capable of grazing
30,000 Sheep, and other Stock.
Labour. To secure by an abundant and continuous supply of labour the extraordinary? - advantages which will arise
from the Company’s operations, it is proposed to offer absolute free passages with provisions and medical atten-
dance to Mechanics, Agricultural Labourers, and Shepherds proceeding to the Colony, under engagements to
remain fixed periods in the Company’s service.
During the period of these engagements, which will be for five 3'ears, the Company’s Emigrants will
he provided with dwellings and rations, and will be paid £2O. a year money wages ; and at the termination of
their engagements the Company will convey to them 40 acres of freehold land ; consisting of 16 acres of
cleared, and 24 acres of uncleared land.
Special contracts will be entered into with mechanics; with families in which there are children capable of
labour; and with parties desirous of engaging for a longer period of service than five years. To the two last
classes the grants of f reehold land will be greater, in reference to the number of children, or the length of
service.
Results. The average profits which will result from the Company’s operations are shewn in the following calculations,
which have been compiled from official documents,* and other impartial sources.
The expense of clearing and thoroughly grubbing the land—ready for the plough—varies from five to fifteen
pounds per acre, according to the quantity of timber on the ground.
Timber. Sir William Denison, upon a rough computation, estimates the quantity of timber in a heavily wooded
district in Yan Diemen’s Land at from 600 to 1000 tons per acre.
But, for the purposes of these calculations, the quantity will be estimated at only 500 tons of 50 cubic feet
each, per acre.
Of this timber, which, on the banks of the Huon, consists principally of she-oak, white-gum, and wattle trees,
one-fifth at least, or on an average 100 tons, will be choice wood suitable for building* purposes. The remainder,
consisting of 400 tons of refuse timber, such as top, lop, stumps, and scrub, will be burnt and converted into potash.
The 100 tons of choice timber will realise in Hobart Town about £2 per ton; which, after deducting 15s a
ton for expense of sawing, preparing, and conveying to market, leaves a net profit of £125 an acre upon building
timber.
The demand for Timber in the Australian ports, and in California is daily increasing in urgency. Mr.
Westgarth, in his last Report to the Chamber of Commerce of Melbourne, especially mentions that great incon-
venience is experienced in that city from the scarcity of timber.
* See Papers laid before Parliament relative to Crown Lands in the Australian Colonies , Part 11., pages 169, 173, 176, 177, 180, and
193. Clowes : London, 1851.


From the experiments made by Dr. Motherwell, it appears that the woods of Van Diemen’s Land, especially"
the she-oak and the white gum, yield a very large quantity of potash, as compared with the elm and the maple,
the most productive woods of the American forests. These latter produce 3*9 parts of pure potassa to 1000
parts of wood; whereas the she-oak and white gum of Van Diemen’s Land produce 5 parts of potassa to 1000
parts of wood.

The yield of net potash from the refuse timber and scrub on each acre, will according* to this analysis, exceed
1 ton, value in Hobart Town £lB ; which, alter deducting* £3 a ton for manufacture and carriage, will leave
a net profit of £l5 an acre from the potash extracted.
The total net profit, therefore , which will he derived from timber and potash alone , will amount to £l4O per
acre.
There is no data by which the quantity of bark per acre can be ascertained. But it is sufficiently consider-
able to form a staple export from the Colony. Value from £7 to £8 a ton.
From the published Returns of the number of acres of land under cultivation in Van Diemen’s Land, it
appears that the probable yield of the crops in the Company’s district will represent the upwards of following
averages: —Wheat, 22 bushels; Barley, 16 bushels; Oats, 25 bushels; Peas, 21 bushels; Tares, 12 bushels;
Potatoes, 4| tons; and turnips, nearly 6 tons. Being, in the aggregate, the most favourable of the returns in
the tables referred to.
But it should be observed that the averages given of the cereal crops are extremely low; and that, with
careful husbandry, under ordinary circumstances, the average of wheat alone may be raised to upwards of
thirty bushels per acre.
The cost of ploughing, sowing, hoeing, reaping, and carting home of crops will be from £1 10s to £2 10s per
acre ; seed for cereals varies from two to four bushels per acre, according to the nature of the soil. For potatoes
the usual weight of seed runs from 7 to 8 cwt. per acre.
Sheep farming returns may be divided into two parts : Ist, the yield of wool, which is from 2 to 2| lbs.
per fleece, worth from Is to Is 6d a pound; 2nd, the increase in the number and value of the flocks, which,
after making a very* large allowance for death and casualties of all kinds, proceeds at the rate of 75 per cent per
annum. Assuming, therefore, a minimum cost of 10s per sheep, the gross annual profit on this branch of the
Company’s operations would amount to £475 upon every flock of 1000 sheep, viz. £lOO for fleeces at 2 lbs.
each, at Is per pound, and £375 for increase in the number and value of the flocks.
The highest estimate of the cost per annum of managing a Sheep Station, and bringing the wool to market,
will not exceed £l4O 10s for every flock of 1000 sheep; including pasture land, wages, repairing fences, &c.
&c. Thus showing that every flock of 1000 sheep will leave a net profit of £334 10s.

The Company, however, have assumed that the wages to be paid by them and the greater outlay for
rations, &c. consequent upon the advanced price of provisions, will represent an increase of about £5O. a year in
the expenses upon a flock of 1000 sheep, over Sir Wm. Denison’s estimate, which was drawn up in 1850.
Hence the cost per thousand has been estimated at £l4O 10s, instead of £9O 9s 6d.
