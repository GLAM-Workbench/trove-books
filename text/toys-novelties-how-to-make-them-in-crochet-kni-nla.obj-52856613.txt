th% animal look shapely. Sew on the ears
with markings in black wool. Sew on the
eyes, which have been previously marked
with a half-circle for pupil, using black
water-colour paint. Make eyebrow mark-
ings in black wool. Work the mouth with
red wool, Mark the waistcoat in black

of previous round. Turn with 2 chain.
3rd round: Repeat last round, except
the last 5 stitches, which work in double-
crochet, for Teddy’s chin.
4th round: Same as 3rd round.
sth round: Now begin to decrease, by
working 1 treble into every second stitch,
and 1 double-crochet into every double-
crochet to narrow the opening. Break off
wool, but do not close the hole, till later,
when stuffed.
The Ears
Join wool to the 4th treble of the
widest round, and work 4 trebles into
one stitch, finishing off with a slip-stitch
to shape the ear. Work 6 slip-stitches
across the top and make the other one
the same and fasten off.
The Arms

by turning up the ends of the legs for
the first two rounds and catching up with
a stitch of the sewing needle in the
centre.
The Swing
Make a chain of 200 stitches.
To Make Up
Stuff the body not too tightly with the
cotton wool. Sew the edges together top
and bottom. Do the same with the other
parts, and darn the hole in the back of
the head neatly. Join on the head at
the part where the double crochet comes,
and wind the wool a few times round to
stiffen the neck. Sew on the arms and
legs, and with a few black" wool stitches I

A BABY BUNTING RATTLE
Here is a pleasing novelty calculated
to make any baby gurgle with delight.
It entails no difficulty in the making, and
the materials are as surprisingly inexpen-
sive as the finished result is charmingly
attractive.
Materials.—A “Thumbs-up” celluloid
doll sJin. high. A small quantity Teazle
wool in white, and also in pale blue.
(Quite small quantities will be sufficient
—left overs). A pair No. 10 knitting
needles.
Begin by casting on 21 sts. with white
wool. Work in garter st. for 6 rows.
On the next row knit 2 sts. into the
7th st. from both ends of the needle.
Repeat this increase on alternate rows—
always in the 7th st. from both ends of
the needle, till there are 31 sts. on the
needle.
Work 3 rows without alteration, then
increase again in the same way. Repeat
these 4 rows once more, then againr’work
3 rows without alteration. The little blue
vest is now begun.
Work straight, but with the 7 centre
sts. in blue as far as the arms. In work-
ing in the two colours, twist them round
each other when changing colours to
avoid looseness. -
When the arms are reached, divide for
the back and the fronts and add the
sleeve sts.
On the first row knit 7 sts. then cast
on 8 sts. Work across these sts. for 8.
rows, then place these sts. on a pin. Join
the wool to the next st., cast on 8 sts. to
the st. needle, then knit across 21 sts.
and cast on 8 sts. at the end —making
37 sts, in all.
Work across these sts. for 8 rows, still
knitting the 7 centre stitches in blue
wool. Cut wool.
Join the wool to the next stitch, cast
on 8 sts., and then work across all sts.
for 8 rows.
Sew up 10 sts. of the sleeve and
shoulder of the back to the same number
of sts. of each front.
Pass the remaining sts. to one needle—
-27 sts. Work all across in blue wool.
On the next row knit 2 sts.. into every
6th st. all across, then work the next
row straight. Repeat the 2 rows 3 times
more, then cast off rather loosely.
The Bonnet
With white wool cast on 28 sts. Work
in garter st. for a depth of 1| ins.
11
HOME BUDGET LACY CROCHET AND KNITTING BOOK. 1/0.


On the next row knit together every
3rd and 4th sts., then work one row
straight.. On next row decrease by knit-
ting together every 2nd and 3rd sts., then
work one row straight. On the next
row knit 2 sts. together all across. Draw
the remaining sts. up on a piece of wool,
and sew up the back of the bonnet as
far as the first decrease.
The Ears
With white wool cast on 9 sts. Work
1 in. straight, then decrease at the begin-
ning and end of the needle alternately, on
alternate rows till all sts. are worked off.
Work 2 ears in blue and 2 in white.
A white and blue ear are sewn together
to form one ear.
The Tail
Cast on 6 sts. with blue wool. Work
a depth of half an inch, then decrease at
both ends of the needle on alternate rows
till all sts. are worked off.
Now brush up all pieces well with the
teazle brush, make a hole in the back of
the doll, and pass in a few peas to form
the rattle.
Sew up the under arm scams, pass the
doll inside the suit, and sew up the back
seam. Draw up the neck and sew .firmly.
Slip the bonnet on the head, and draw
to fit the neck, then, sew firmly.
Sew on the tail, fold the ears, and
sew to the head.
White 'buttons on the vest are just
French knots in white wool.

LARGE TEDDY BEAR
We have been asked to publish directions
for making a really large Bear. They are
very expensive indeed to buy, and are as
easy to knit at home as an ordinary jumper

Teddy be preferred, several others are
illustrated in this issue. Of if this Teddy
is knitted on finer needles with finer wool
the size of the toy will be smaller
accordingly.

wool, 1J ozs. of light fawn wool, one pair
of bone knitting needles size 8, two large
pearl buttons for eyes, black wool for
marking face and claws, 1J yards of
ribbon for neck, and 2 yards of un-
bleached calico.

To Make Up
Brush up all the parts (except the
soles and inside of hands) well with a
wire brush. Cut out all the parts in
strong calico lining, allowing |in. for the
making up and tack well all round the
edges and across the limbs, leaving all
the tacking threads in white after the
animal is stuffed. When making up sew
all the knitted parts together with wool,
then whip the calico over with strong
cotton. Join the body up the front, sew
the side of the head to the head-piece.
Sew the nose together and along the
throat. Sew up the forelegs, then sew to
the body, place the seam 5 ins. from the
shoulder seam. Join up the hind legs
and sew on the soles. Cut a piece of
cardboard the same shape and place this
in each foot. This keeps the soles flat
when stuffed. Sew in the legs, placing
the seam 9 ins. from the seam in front
of the body. Stuff well with kapok
down, flock or anything light suitable for
stuffing. Sew up the opening at the back
that was left for the stuffing. Take out
all the tacking threads. Sew on tb*


ears, mark the nose, mouth and claws
with black wool, sew in the eyes. To
make these get two large pearl buttons,
marking the pupils with black Indian ink.
Paint all round them with red water-
colour paint, when perfectly dry paint
over with clear varnish or glue. Smooth
the animal down with a wire brush and
tie the ribbon round his neck. Stiffen
outer edges of ears with wire.
If an upright model is desired, knit in
exactly the same way, but place the
seams of the legs 6 ins. from the seam
in front of the body. This makes a
model 39 ins. high.

REINS FOR CHILDREN
These reins are quickly and easily
knitted, and afford a great deal of amuse'
ment to children, besides being capital
exercise. Procure 3 ozs. of crimson
double Berlin wool, 2 knitting needles,
No. 10, two i yard lengths of strong box-
cord, a piece of wadding, a piece of
crimson twill, 4 small fancy bells, and a
few needlefuls of gold-coloured filoselle.
For the piece that crosses the cheat, cast
on 24 stitches: knit forwards and back-
wards all plain knitting, slipping the first
stitch in every row to make a firm edge,
for 66 rows, and cast off. On this
embroider five large stars with the gold-
coloured filoselle, one star in the centre,
and two on each side; the bells also are
arranged here, one bell above and one
below the star in the centre, and one to
the right and one to the left. For the
armholes, join the pieces of cord in
circles, cover them with wadding, making
rings about 2 inches in thickness, and
bind over neatly with the twill. Cast on
12 stitches, knit a sufficient length to
cover the foundation, and cast off. Knit
another length in the same way, and sew
the knitting upon the padded rings.
Next sew on the front piece, the cast-on
stitches to one ring, and the cast-off
stitches to the other. For the reins cast
on 8 stitches, and knit a length of 2j
yards or 3 yards, and cast off. Sew each
end of this to the back of the armholes,
and the reins are complete.

NOVELTY EASTER EGGS
Humpty-Dumpty will be a lovable
companion on Easter morning, and
the soldier man and the chocolate
egg in novel egg cup will be favour-
ites with the kiddies.
So many comical effects can be got
with a few paints and scraps of paper
and material that every mother should
try her hand at home-decorating the
household eggs this year. And if there


COMIC
SUPPERS
Useful, too, and easily
made larger.
Materials Required :
Two ounces of fawn
4-ply wool, one pair of
steel knitting needles,
size 13, four black
shoe buttons for eyes.
These slippers are
worked in alternate
rows of loops and purl.
The loops are made
thus: Insert the needle,
wind wool twice round
the right needle and
forefinger of left hand.
Now round the needle
only, and slip off in
the usual way. These
instructions make a
pair of size 5 slippers.
To Make
Cast on 12 stitches.
Ist row: Knit. 2nd
row: Work 12 loops.
aren’t any children in your house to
chuckle ecstatically over your handiwork,
could you think of a nicer gift for your
local orphanage than a dozen eggs that
will both delight and nourish the little
inmates ?
Choose the largest and palest-tinted
eggs you can. Boil them hard and let
them get quite cold before you start
painting them. Showcard colours are
excellent for decoration, but ordinary
water colours can be used quite success-
fully, provided they are not mixed with
too much water.
A child old enough to know his nursery
rhymes will be captivated by Humpty
Dumpty sitting on his wall. He’s much
easier to make than he looks.
For the wall use a small square or
round tin, about the circumference of an
egg-cup, so that the egg will fit into it.
Cover the tin with a slightly over-lapping
strip of doll's-house paper. This is ready
printed with a red-brick design.
Paint the egg with the recognised
Humpty Dumpty featuies—small eyes
under well-arched brows, a small nose,
immensely wide mouth, set in a smirk,
and a double chin.
To give Humpty the appearance of
sitting on the wall (actually, of course,
he reposes in it), draw on white paper a
replica of his lower, hidden portion, with
outstretched arms, two short straddling
legs, and the cravat made famous in
"Alice Through the Looking Glass.” You
can copy your drawing from the photo-1
graph on this page in bright colours, cut!
it out and paste it to the wall. !
Aunt Sally reposes very elegantly in
an egg-cup, but being a modest, old-
fashioned lady with a horror of legs, she
hides her supports entirely under a volu-
minous skirt of white tissue paper. Her

Join the slipper up at the back, and
sew on to the sole. Cut the top of each
loop and brush out with a wire brush.
With a bone crochet hook work a d.c.
round the top of slipper, as this makes
the edges firmer. Sew on the ears. Work
ruff is a strip of orange-coloured tissue
paper pleated into the rim of the cup
and held in place by—herself. Her
sash—or should it be her neck band?—is
a bit of orange ribbon, and her chef-like
hat is of white material sewn together
and decorated with tiny orange pompoms.
Mr. Smug, whom you see, is a very
easy gentleman to contrive. (You in-
crease the fun a lot by giving each egg
a descriptive name.) Put an egg in an
egg-cup and on the part showing above
the cup (the widest part of the egg)
paint features in a few bold strokes of
brown paint.
To make Mr. Smug’s hat, cut a circle
from a postcard and inside this cut a
smaller circle making a ring, which will
fit over the top quarter of the egg. Paint j
the cardboard ring and the top of the |
egg, which forms the crown, black, and
the gentleman has very presentable head-
gear. Between the egg and cup slip a i
strip of white paper, a little smaller in |
circumference than the cup, so that the j
ends will stick up in front like the points
of a collar, and over this knot a bit of j
narrow ribbon for Mr. Smug’s tie. He’ll,
be a great success at the breakfast table, 1

BABY’S EASTER CHIC
Although the little one is too young
for a chocolate or toy-filled egg at
Easter, there is no reason why he or
she should be missed out altogether
when the Easter gifts are dis-
tributed.
Less than half an ounce of fluffy yellow
Shetland floss or the little more expen-
sive rabbit wool, a quarter of a yard of
deep yellow ribbon, about three-eighths
of an inch wide, two black boot buttons,
and a little bell will make the sweetest
little Easter chick imaginable. You will
also need a piece of thin wire about 6
inches long, and a needleful of deep
yellow silk.
First of all get some clean white card-
board and cut out two circles, three
inches in diameter. In the centre of each
cut out a hole three-quarters of an inch
in diameter.
Wind some of the wool into a small
enough ball to pass through the hole
easily.
Put the end of the wool between the
two pieces of card, held one on top of
the other, and hold in place with the
finger and thumb.
Now start to wind the wool over and
over the circles of card, keeping it even
and gradually covering it. When the
small ball is finished, then wind a smaller
ball of wool and continue covering the
card in the same way.
At last the hole in the centre of the
card will be almost filled up, then you
must thread the wool into a small darning

needle - and continue winding over the
card until the needle will no longer pass
through the centre.
Hold the wool-covered card firmly in
the centre, and with a sharp pair of
scissors begin to cut through the wool
between the two circles of cardboard..
Cut only a few threads, then get a
thin piece of white string and pass down
between the pieces of card. Hold this in
place and continue cutting the loops at
the edges of the cardboard.
As a few stitches are cut, pass the
string down between them, so that when
they are all severed the string is ready
to tie round the middle of the woolly
ball.
Pull the ends of string firmly and
tightly, and secure with a tight knot,
then remove the pieces of card.
You will then find that you have a
fluffy woolly ball.
Fashioning the Chick
The next thing to do is to get another
small length of string, and, catching to-
gether a bunch of the fluffy ends of the
ball, secure sufficient to form the head
of the chick. You will find that you will
probably have to neaten off the ends of
the head to make it the right shape.
Make a loop of the yellow ribbon,
about half an inch, and sew into the wool
for a head. Do the same with a longer
piece of ribbon for the tail. The eyes
arc the two small black buttons. The
iect arc made from cardboard painted
yellow, and the legs are joined well up
in the middle of the ball. Baby’s Easter
chick is now complete.

To Make Up the Camel
Sew up the two pieces of sides together,
beginning at the hindquarters. Sew in
the underbody, leaving an opening of two
inches at the back for stuffing. Turn the
-work and stuff well and firmly with kapok,
“beginning at the head and neck. Stuff
-the body very firmly. Sew up the open-
ing; sew on the ears and tail. Sew in
|he two jet beads for eyes. Mark the
nose and mouth with black wool. For
the harness, in crochet make a chain of
red wool and arrange over the head,
Stitching it in position with yellow wool.
To make up the black boy sew the two
pieces together, leaving an opening at
the side for stuffing. Stuff lightly with
kapok; sew up the opening, mark the eyes
with white wool and work the pupils
with fine black wool. Mark the mouth
with red wool. Make a stitch in the
centre of face of about half an inch for
nose, and draw the thread tight. Sew on
to the camel. Stitch the reins to his
hands. Sew on the cap.
CHINAMAN HUSSIF
You can make him from an ordinary
baby doll—without hair, and standing
about 7 ins. high—if you can’t get a
Chinese one. It is a simple matter to
paint in the slanting Oriental eyebrows.
Any scrap of silk or ribbon will make
the wee knickers. His “petticoats” con-
sist of four strips of white flannel 6 ins.
by 4 ins.—forming a double apron back
and front, attached at the waist
The little man illustrated has a robe
of peacock blue trimmed with scarlet and'
gold. You will need 3 yard of corded,
silk ribbon 4J ins. wide, about a yard of I
narrow gold ribbon, and 3 yard of slightly:
narrower scarlet ribbon. The sash is
made from the latter, and the little
“dicky” by placing a strip of the gold
flat over red ribbon, and sewing on red
buttons.
His Skirts
The sides of the skirt are not seamed,
but the front is turned up to form a
4-inch pocket on the right side; the edge
is faced with the gold ribbon and secured
by a small button and loop. The little
patch in the corner is for ornament only
and could easily be omitted. The cor-
responding pocket on the back half of
the skirt is on the inside.
The upstanding collar is made by wind-
ing the gold ribbon twice round the
neck, and fastening securely at the back,
the ends forming the loop by which to
hang up the doll.
A scrap of black velvet makes the cap,
which should be as close fitting as pos-
sible. The crowning touch is the pigtail,
made from a plaited skein of black floss
silk.
Now slip cards of darning silk, a
thimble and a wee pair of scissors, into
the various pockets, a good supply of
needles, pins and safety-pins into his
petticoats, and he is finished.

THE POWDER BOX DOLL
Milady likes her little dash of powder,
it is true, but she will also like the
delightful little -doll, here illustrated, to
cover the powder box as it rests on her
dressing table.
The construction of the doll is a simple
matter.
The china heads are obtainable in most
chain stores, and the wire frame is made
by forming the wires in the manner
shown.
Ordinary number 4 copper wire is used,
and a hundred feet costs but a few pence.
Make the frame so that the china head
is above the top of the box a distance of
about 4$ inches.
The rest of the job is simply a matter
of working silk ribbon around and around
to form the dress. The finished object is
placed over the powder box, hiding it
from view, yet making it accessible at all
times.

A CHIC DIVAN DOLL OF PAPER
This quaint but beautiful lady will lean languidly against bright cushions—in 'a
dashing red and black costume she dams to be Spanish.
Here’s a fascinating present
for the bachelor girl who has
risen to a flatlet of her own
and a divan bed., She’ll love
one of these delightful dolls
to sit in state amongst the
cushions, and as the gay lady
is only made of paper, you
can easily make it for her
without “breaking the bank."
What You Will Require
You will require two folds
of crepe paper, one in black. 1
and one in an attrac-
tive colour to tone jBB
or contrast with the
divan furnishings ; WH
a short length
pliable thick wire;
half a yard of gold W .
tinsel ribbon ; and
a doll’s head. The
latter can be bought
very cheaply at any *
stores selling fancy 1
goods, or you can
make it yourself by
covering cotton
wool with pink silk,
painting in the
“face” with a few
strokes of oil colour,
and using black em- .
broidery silk for the
hair. /SH
/MW
How to Make
Begin with the body, which is com-
posed of plaited crepe paper. Slide the
black crepe paper 10 inches out of its
paper cover, and cut off, then do the
same twice with the other chosen colour.
Fold the resulting long lOin. wide
coloured strips in half, lengthways, then
34th row; K. 2 tog., purl until 2
remain, p. 2 into next stitch, p. 2 into
last stitch.
35th row: Cast on 2, knit until 2
remain, k. 2 tog.
36th row; Purl.
37th row: Cast off 3, knit to end.
38th row: K. 2 tog., purl to end.
39th row: As 25th row.
40th row: As 24th row. Cast off.
Make the other half in same way, but
purling all the knit rows and knitting
all the purl rows to reverse knitting.
To Make Up
Press on wrong side under damp cloth
with hot iron. Place pieces together and
sew, leaving straight edge free, work d.c.
round opening. Stuff head with wadding,
and with black wool mark eyes in French
knots. Line cosy with sateen. Brush all
over with a wire brush.


in half again, and again once more; but
before .folding the black strip in the
same way, hide a piece of wire in the
centre. Then plait these two thick
coloured strips and the black one in the
ordinary way. This makes the body,
which should be about 12ins. long, the
wire giving it rigidity.
The doll’s arms and legs are plaited
likewise, but from sin. instead of lOin.
Strips, and no wire is necessary. The
arms should measure Sins, long, and the
legs 16ins. Sew in position with cotton.
Sew the doll’s head on to the body,
then make a ruffle from a length of
coloured crepe paper edged with the
black and tie it round the neck with the
tinsel ribbon.
The Skirt
A wide and flaring coloured skirt ruffle,
edged with black, is tied round the
middle of the doll to hide the leg-joins.
Little ruffles for the wrists and ankles,
and a cardboard Spanish comb covered
with naper, are the finishing touches.
BLACK SAMBO
Black Sambo would make glad any
little-boy heart and is the greatest fun
to make.

BRUSH BAG FOR
DRESSING TABLE
Here is a little lady to hang on your
dressing-table to hold your hair or clothes
brush. The opening to slip the brush
through is at the back of the skirt. The
doll is quite easy to make, for the skirt
is just a bag to hold the brushes with
a round base to it.
Sawdust or bran is the most suitable
stuffing, for it is not “bulgey,” and you
will not need very much for this little
doll.
When you have made the stuffed body
and arms and sewn them on to the head
(if you have only bought a head without
shoulders and body) gather and sew on
the skirt to which you have already sewn
in the round or oval base.
Be sure to leave a large enough placket
opening down the seam of the skirt at
the back. Then just finish dressing the
doll with bodice, ruff, muff, and hat —
and loops at the back by which to hang
her up.
Such a dainty touch to your dressing-
table —and brushes lying on your table
never look tidy, do they ?
NOVEL WORK BAG
What could be a daintier or more use-
ful present to the girl who is engaged ?
She always seems to have little flimsy
bits of fabrics around her, and then she
always loses her scissors or needles, etc.
It is so simple that it hardly needs ex-
plaining. Cut a piece of flowered
material the shape shown in the diagram.
Turn down half an inch at the top, and
run a draw - thread through. In the
centre of the dress cut slots, and in these
thread a ribbon. This is undone when
the work is put away, and when tied
again keeps it from falling out. The


HOME BUDGET
Every Woman's friend, 6d. per month
When perfect elegance of attire is desired,
use Home Budget Patterns.
■loping sides are left undone, and form
the opening to the bag.
Use two strips of flesh - coloured
material; sew together, leaving one end
open. Then stuff and fasten on to dress.
The features and hair are done in coloured
silks.
The feet are made in the same way
as the head, with a band of black to make
the shoes; then they are fastened
securely into the hem of the dress.
The hat, choker, muff (cotton holder i,
thimble-case, and hem are carried out in
swansdown.
The dress is made in a pale pink
flowered with blue forget-me-nots. It is
lined with a pretty blue, which peeps
through at the opening. The swansdown
and ribbon trimmings are also in blue.
SEWING TIDY
Hide that untidy bundle of darning
under an attractive crinoline of
Ribbons.
How often one is “ caught ” darning
stockings in the drawing-room ! Here is
a little lady who will help you to conceal
them, for her ample petticoats are destined
to cover your work-basket when not in
use.
The plain front of her dress is made in
four flaps, which, when raised, reveal
needles, pins, and safety-pins, as shown
in ihe small diagram.
S’-.e is very easy to make, the only
materials required being a wire lampshade
frame, a doll's hrad, two shades of
ribbon, wide and narrow, and a little
flannel. Carried out in green and black,
she would look sweet. I
WOOLLEN GOLLIWOGS
SOMETHING FOR LITTLE GIRLS
TO MAKE ON WET DAYS
Wouldn’t you like to make one' of
these jolly little golliwog dolls ? And you
can, too. Quite easily ! All you need is
some wool or string and a piece of card-
board.
Wind the wool over and over the
cardboard as you sec in the picture.
When you have made it qm>e nice and
thick, cut along one end. You can see
here how it is done. The cut end comes
at the bottom of your doll. Bind the
other end, a little from the end, to form
the head.
Then take several strands of wool at
each side to form the arms; cut these
shorter than the rest and bind them at
the ends.
Now all that remains to do is to bind
the legs as you see in the picture and
to put a few stitches for eyes, mouth,
etc., and, if you like, a few buttons down
the front of your golliwog !
It would be the greatest fun to make
a whole family of these golliwogs—all
of different colours—from the scraps
mother has left over from her knitting.
You could then give them to your special
friends.
USEFUL PIERROT
Pierrot would delight any woman with
a tidy soul because his trousers are
really two handy pockets for holding
any oddments she pleases—needles and
cottons, darning wools, dusters, bediooro
slippers, toiled handkerchiefs—oh, a
hundred and one things. And he’s very
decorative, too.


His Colour Scheme
His costume can be black and white
or gaily-coloured, according to the taste
of his owner-to-be, and he's just as easy
as possible to make.
The original Pierrot illustrated is car-
ried out in black and white cambric,
and his head is a ping-pong ball with
features and skull cap marked in with
Indian ink. If you are making a more
elaborate job, ysu can buy beautiful
ready-made heads which would be very
suitable.
First of all, make a body of rags or
wadding—or anything else you like—
measuring 3$ inches long by S inches in
circumference, and attach the ping-pong
ball or head to this with strong stitches.
Make a good job of this, as it will have
to hold considerable weight.
As Pierrot’s trousers are to be his
pockets, their sijse depends on the use
to which he is to be put. For dusters
and hankies each leg should be a straight
tube 10 inches deep and 24 inches round.
Join up each leg seam about half-way
from the bottom, leaving the upper half
open for a placket. Neaten these open
side* carefully. Gather the bottoms of
the trousers, leaving a i inch frill; then
gather the tops and join to the body,
arranging them so that the pocket open-
ices come at each side.
The Little Shirt
Next make two sleeves in proportion
to the site of the body and attach them.
Now, a little straight shirt left unstitched
for about 1 inch below the shoulders to
allow the sleeves to come through.
Gather up the little shirt round the
neck and finish with a stiff frill of muslin.
Finally, decorate with black pompoms
made from darning wool, add a ribbon
to the back of his neck to hang him up
by, and Pierrot is ready.
OLD WORLD LADY MAKES
ATTRACTIVE DOOR STOP
A really useful present consists of a
“door-stop.” Who hasn’t experienced
the annoyance of a door that obstinately
refuses to stay open ? And its recipient
will be truly grateful.
For this you will need an ordinary
bottle, some sand with which to weight
it, a length of taffeta ribbon and some
metallic lace; lastly, one of those fas-
cinating doll’s heads complete with
poudre wig and a pair of arms.
A small stick glued into the inside of
the doll's neck and then wedged firmly
into the neck of the bottle, previously
filled with sand, leaves your figure all
ready for dressing.
Leave sufficient of your ribbon to make
the tiny bodice, then, joining up the
remainder run a gathering thread-along
the top and, after slipping it over the
“lady’s” head, pull it in tightly and
finish off at the bottom of the neck of
the bottle, which constitutes the waist of
the figure.
Next comes the bodice. Make a square
with the remaining piece of ribbon and
fold in half diagonally, placing one point
in the centre of the back and bringing
the other two over the shoulders and
fastening them in front.
Lastly, with your lace, make a looped-
up pannier on each hip, finishing this
off under the crossed-over ends of the
bodice.
TWO IDEAS FOR GIFTS
A “cosy" set for the teapot and egg-
cup would be appreciated by the wife
who likes her breakfast in bed.
You will require half a yard of
molleton in any bright colour, half a yard
Jap. silk for lining, one yard of wadding
for padding.
Leader silk, in yellow, and two yellow
chicken appliques—one large and one
small—which you can buy from most
fancy shops for about 6d. each.
Cut two “dome” shapes the right site
for a small teapot, and one straight strip,
about three inches vide and as long as
the curved edge of the dome. From the
silk, cut three similar shapes, but allow-
ing an extra half-inch all round for turn-
ings ; from the wadding, three pieces a
I quarter of an inch smaller all round than
the molleton.
I Buttonhole round all the edges of the
molleton pieces, straight strip and all,
with the embroidery thread. Tack the
chicken applique in place on one of the
dome-shaped pieces, and buttonhole it
down all round.
Place the padding on the wrong side
of the molleton pieces and over these
the linings. Turn in the bottom edges
of the latter just beneath the button-
holing and slip-stitch.
Now oversew the two dome pieces to
the straight strip with yellow embroidery
thread, taking up the top of the button-
holing instead of the material. Add a
fancy bead to the top. The egg-cosy is
made in the same way.

A PAPER COW
Here is a simple method of making a very effective paper
cow. Come on, you grown-up girls and boys, make her for
your little brother or sister !
Trace the different parts of the cow on to a piece of thin
white cardboard. To do this, place the cardboard under the
page and trace carefully through with a sharp pencil. This will
trace a thin groove on to the cardboard, which can be easily
followed with a pencil.
Then cut out the body and other parts with scissors and the
cow is ready to be put together. The hind legs (Fig. 8) are
fitted to the body by cutting slot F in legs and also slot P
in body and fitting them together. The front legs (Fig. 9)
are done in the same manner. The ears (Fig, 10) are inserted
in the slit E and the horns (Fig. 11) in the slit D. Fig. 6
represents the finished animal. If she is painted, she will look
more lifelike still.

A LOVEBIRD HOLDER
A holder for the hot-milk jug handle
is an acceptable gift which can be made
so cheaply. The original was made from
a scrap of jade-green satin ribbon, but
the Blue Bird of Happiness would be
equally effective.
Copy the design of the bird, making it]
the required site, on a piece of tracing
paper (folding the paper exactly down
the centre), lay over a sheet of white
paper and trace through the reverse of
the bird. J
Lay your tracing on the right side of
the material with a sheet of carbon paper,
face downwards, between, and trace the
lines again with a sharp pencil.
Cut out with about three-eighth inch
turnings.
Cut a piece of lining the same size.
Trace through the outline only of the
bird, omitting the tail, on a piece of
chamois leather or cloth, for interlining,
and cut out just inside the line.
Embroider the wings and tail of the
bird, fold to the wrong side, and stitch
round the head.
Lay the interlining on- the wrong side
of the lining piece, turn in the edges of
the lining and tack down. Oversew round
the head. -Slip on the cover, turn in the
edges of the satin, and slip-stitch to the
lining.
Stuff the head with cotton-wool, catch-
ing the lining together on the inside.
Work the beak and eyes in bright
yellow silk. Outline the eyes with fine
black silk and make a black French knot
in the centre of each.
Finally, blanket-stitch round the sides
and tail with matching silk.
TOY CUSHIONS
It's amusing, and quite easy, to make
cushions in the shape of toys. For in-
stance, a cottage can be evolved from a
big oblong pillow of hessian, with red
casement cloth for the roof sewn over
the top, and with a little red sausage for
a chimney firmly fixed on. Scraps of
check gingham appliqued on the front
will suggest windows, and a door and
shutters of green must be added. Cut-
out fragments of brilliant flower-patterned
cretonne, appliqued on as shown in the
sketch, will make a garden round the
little dwelling.
Another attractive .cushion of blue linen,
might be adorned with a conventional
"landscape" design in applique work.
Daisy-sprigged chintz will form a
meadow, yellow linen, cornfields, and 1
dark-green felt or flannel, will suggest a
group of trees. Clouds might be cut out
of white linen.
A circular pillow of scarlet cotton,
would look gay if trimmed with a couple
of appliqued black ducklings, the pillow
edge being bound with black braid.
Home Budget Soft Toy Patterns me
excellent to use for cutting animal shapes
to applique on to cushions, curtains, etc.
BUTTONS FOR PILLOW
CASES
Although a great many people have
adopted the pillow case with a wide under-
flap which disposes of the necessity for
buttons, there are still a large number
who prefer to use a buttoned case. And
how those buttons do suffer at the hands
of the mangier !
The Home Budget solves this difficulty
by sewing the buttons to the actual pillow
and making buttonholes on each side of
the open ends of the case. The buttons
are sewn on with a fairly loose shank
to take the double layer of buttonholes


MOCASSINS FOR BABY
Materials.—3 balls Leader Crochet
Silk, a No. 16 crochet hook.
Sice.—The tiny shoes measure 4j ins.
along the sole, and are just right for a
toddler’s first bedroom slippers.
This is the simplest slipper of all to
make. Any sice can be made by
incteasing to the width required to fold
up the sides of the foot as desired then

SPORTS SOCKS
You can wear silk stockings to the
tennis club if you have a pair of
these short socks to pul! over them
while you are playing.
Materials. —Of Patons and Baldwins’
soft knitting wool, 4 oc. in white, 1 oc.
each in red, green, and blue (or any
other colours you prefer, of course), a
set of No. 14 steel needles.
Sice.—The directions given are for a
sock sice 9 inches.
For larger sices simply knit the extra
length required before shaping the toe.
Tension. —Ten sts. to 1 inch.
Commence at the edge of the turnover
top by casting on 90 sts. in red wool.
Work in a rib of k. 2, p. 1, working
into the backs of the sts. on the first row
till there are 7 rounds in red; then work
2 rounds in white, 4 rounds in green, 2
rounds in white, 2 rounds in blue, and 2
rounds in white.
Now work 2 rounds in st.-st. in white
wool.
Now work the 2 colour pattern all
round, following the diagram.
After completing the pattern work 2
rounds in white in st.-st., then change
to the ribbing again and work 2 rounds
in white. 2 rounds in blue, 2 rounds in
white. 4 rounds in green, 2 rounds in
white, and 7 rounds in red.


Turn the work inside out, then proceed
in st.-st., keeping the knit side outside,
and using white wool.
On--the first round make a seam st.
for the back of the leg by first knitting
then purling a st. .into the last st. of
the round.
Keep the purl st. to the bottom of the
heel. Continue quite straight for a depth
of 2 in., then shape for the ankle.

then k. to the last 4 sts. of the round,
k. 2 tog. through the backs of the loops,
k. 1. p. 1.
Knit 3 rounds without alteration, then
repeat the four rounds till 5 decreasings
are made on each side of the seam st.
Now work a depth of 2 in. without
shaping, then divide for the heel.
Knit the first 20 sts. of the round on
to one needle, then slip the last 21 sts.
of the round to the same needle. These
41 sts., with the purl st. in the centre,
are for the heel.
Divide the remaining sts. on the two
needles and leave these for the instep.
Continue backwards and forwards across
the heel sts., keeping the purl st. —and
always slipping the first st. of every row,
knitwise on a purl row, and purlwise on
a knit row —till 39 more rows have been
worked.
Now turn the heel.

round to the beginning of the third
needle, and here k. 1, k. 2 tog., through
the back loops, then finish the needle.
Continue decreasing in this way on
each alternate round till only 20 sts.
remain on each of the fi.rst and third
needle. .
Continue on the remainder sts. without
alteration for a depth of 5j ins. from the
aide of the heel where the sts. were
picked up.
This is for a 9-inch foot.

NOVEL STOCKING BAG
AND RING
Soiled stockings have a dreadful habit
of accumulating at a rapid rate, and in
nine cases out of ter. are dumped from
one place to another, for very rarely is
a place provided for them where they
can be stowed away until washday.
On reference to the illustrations you
will note two ways of solving the problem,
which are both easily made, and add to
the attractiveness of any girl’s room if
made in colours to match her colour
scheme.
Ring Type Stocking Hanger, as illus-
trated in Fig. 1. —Of course, you need
not have your stocking hanger exactly
the same size, etc., as the one illustrated,
but the following list and measurements
will probably be helpful to you. One
ordinary fancy work ring 10 ins. in dia-
meter, yards pale blue ribbon 3J ins.
wide, a small spray of flowers similar to
those used in hat trimming.
Commence by wind ng the ribbon
tightly around and round the ring until
you come to where you began, which will
be the top of the hanger. Now wind
a couple of times over the end making
a good join, and insert a few good, strong
stitches to prevent it from coming undone.
Make a loop of the ribbon to act as
a hanger and fin:sh off firmly. Now
arrange your spray over the join as
shown. The flowers used represent butter-
cups with green leaves and harmonise
with the pale blue ribbon used.
Then to take the round look away from
the hanger place a bud slightly to the
side as shown, but not in the middle.
One thing which is worth remembering
when putting finishing touches to any
gift : do not place little ornamentations
evenly or at equal distances apart. You
will find if placed a little out of align-1
ment will make it ever so much more
attractive. So on your Stocking Hanger
do not place your bud on the side ex-
Figure 1
actly half way between the top and bot
tom, for if you do it will look odd ano
you will probably feel like placing one
on the other side to match, which would
not be effective. Try this out for your'
self, and I think you will agree that by
placing ornamentations a little unevenly
your gifts will be more pleasing.

is a yard of material 28 in. wide, a wooden
coat hanger, and a couple of flower
ornaments.
First fold the length in half, sewing up
both sides in a French seam. Now for
the entrance to the bag ; Cut a slit in
the centre from the top about 4 in. down,
turn the edges in neatly and hem. With
a small running stitch gather the two top
pieces together, then slip in the coat
hanger, drawing the material up to its
size. Next gather the material in below
the coat hanger, thus securing the coat
hanger in position.
The bag is now completed, so take each
corner and attach it a little further up
the side of the bag as shown, covering
the stitches with a flower. Add a posie
to the centre of the hanger and your
stocking bag is completed.
You will find by using a coat hanger
instead of the ordinary tape which
gathers up the bag, makes it much easier
to insert soiled articles.
For Stitching or Textile Paint
in outline or chain stitch or painted in
with textile paint. The work is quick and
effective, and will delight the small user.
Designs such as the bold doglet are
suitable for tracing on to articles for
kiddies’ use. The design can be stitched
Children love animal designs on clothing or furnishings. The simplest
little garment attains new interest when trimmed by hand with
designs such as Bunnies or the Doglet. It is so easy to do this work
with the aid of the Home Budget Toy and Novelty Book. If other
animal designs are preferred the Patterns of Soft Toys may be used
as a guide. Older children love'to embroider animals on hand linen, etc.,
for gifts It is an interesting occupation for them as well as the
beginning of the industrious and thrifty
habit of doing needlework for themselves.
Home Budget Patterns are perfect in every'detail.
BUNNIES FOR BABY’S BIB
And other articles, too. Place a sheet of carbon on the material with the print on top of that. Pin or use weights to keep
steady, then trace the outline with a hard, sharp pencil Work in Mem stitch, with satin stitch for the eyes and nose.

TOYS FROM MATCH
BOXES
Children prefer quantity to quality any
day, and they arc more pleased with a
multitude of small toys, over which they
can exclaim one by' one, than with one
or two big presents.
This is very lucky when pennies are
scarce, as fascinating little playthings ate
easily made at home for next to nothing.
It’s amazing what can be turned out with
a collection of empty match-boxes, a few
corks, old beads, and bits of silver paper.
The puzzle shown is very easy to make,
and will give lots of amusement. You
will need, for it, the lid of a cardboard
box of moderate size, one match-box and
two marbles.
Seccotine .the drawer of the match-box
into the lid, and let it dry hard. Then
with a penknife cut away a piece from
one side of the box, large enough to
admit a marble easily. Seccotine the box
to the centre of the cardboard lid and
complete the puzzle with two marbles.
The game is to manipulate the puzzle,
so as to get both marbles into the hole
in the match-box at once—not so easy
as it looks.


A MINIATURE DRESSING-TABLE
Match-boxes can.be turned into excel-
lent dolls’-house furniture for little girls.
The elegant wee dressing-table shown is
only one sample of the pieces that may
be made with a little ingenuity.
The dressing-table takes no less than
five match-boxes to make, as well as
sundry other trifles. Seccotine four of the
boxes together, in pairs, to form the chest
of drawers part, fitting each drawer with
a paper-fastener handle. Mount the
bottom drawer of each part on four legs
composed of beads, to give extra height
and dignity.
The back of the dressing-table is put
.together by the sets of drawers being
seccotined to a match-box lid placed
upright between thpm. Part of a postcard
is cut to fit the top of the drawers and
the space between, and form the table
part, while the remainder of the card
forms the mirror, and is supported by
the upper part of the upright match-box
lid. The glass of the mirror is a piece
of silver paper, smoothed by being
pressed firmly with the handle of a spoon,
and pasted in the centre of the white
card frame.
A MATCH-BOX EXPRESS
Toys on wheels are always a safe choice
for small boys, and illustration shows the
match-box express and a realistic motor-
van made from similar humble materials.
The construction of the engine can be
easily followed from the illustration. Cut
a cork in half for the funnel and the
other half (reversed) for the whistle.
Both engine and trucks (the latter are
simply match-box drawers) have axles for
the wheels, made of used matches sec-
cotined across the bottoms of the boxes.
The wheels I modestly consider rather
a triumph—tin pot-menders from a two-
penny card for the engine and first truck,
while the cork washers accompanying
them make wheels for the remaining truck
and the motor-van. The wheels are
prevented from working off the axles by
a blob of sealing wax dropped on the
end of each match, after the pot-mender
wheels are in position. ' The couplings
are long paper-fasteners.
The van has a tilt made from a piece

little steering wheel is half a match with
a wee circle of thin cardboard fixed to
its top.

rows, decreasing by leaving off one stitch
at a time, until there is one treble left.
This makes a lozenge shaped portion.
Join the six pieces together by over-

up the seam and press. Finish with tiny
bows of ribbon in front of the ankle.
Work another bootee in the same

FOR THE LITTLE ONES
TO MAKE
The Christmas atmosphere is apt to
make the little nursery-folk rather ob-
streperous ! They are so excited, with
the anticipation of presents and parties
and all the other good things that come
with Santa Claus, that they really cannot
contain themselves. They rampage about
the house and often hinder matcr-
familias, who is, of course, busier than
ever just now.
A small child gets much pleasure from
the task of making Christmas presents,
and in this way two birds are killed with
one stone: nimble little fingers are kept
happily busy, and the grown-ups are left
free to make their own Christmas pre-
parations without perpetual interruptions
from small folk who are too excited to
be “quiet and good.”
A small person of six or seven can
make really charming little presents, the
only materials needed being some crepe
paper, a pair of scissors, and a pot of
paste and brush, and a few empty cigar
boxes, toffee tins, cigarette tins and some
cardboard.
Simple, But Effective
The crepe. paper is available in rolls,
and is decorated with all sorts of designs.
Some are seasonable and Christmasy,
others include birds, flowers, and con-
ventional designs. It is quite an easy task
for the child, first to cover the box or
tin by pasting on plain coloured crepe
paper and then to adorn it with little
cut-out pictures taken from the decorated
crepe and pasted on just where fancy
indicates. Tins thus ornamented do nicely
for bedside biscuit boxes.
A very simple but effective little gift
consists of a small wooden candlestick
decorated with crepe paper cut and fluted
to form petals, from the centre of which
emerges a candle gaily decorated with
gummed ribbon pasted on to it in a
striped pattern.

loid doll, cut in halves below the waist-
line. Use wools of any color you prefer
to match your cups and saucers.
For the bodice, in crochet, do sufficient
chain to fit the body of the doll very
tightly. Then double crochet for sufficient
rows to cover the body and tuck under
the cut edge. The shoulder straps are
two rows of chain the required length.
For the skirt cast on 73 stitches, and
knit 1 row into back of every stitch.
Mext row: * Knit 1, slip 1, knit together,
epeat from * to end of row, finishing
■vith knit 1. Continue this for six inches
ir more according to the depth of the
eapot. Then cast off. Do four of these
>ieces, and join together, leaving room
or spout and handle to slip through.
For the apron cast on 36 stitches, and
io feather and fan stitch for about 4J
aches. For feather -and fan stitch do
me row plain, then begin the pattern
>y purling two together twice; then ♦
aake 1, knit 1, four times; purl two
ogether four times *; repeat from * to
‘ to end of row, which should end by:
, mrling two together twice. Next row,

The ear-pieces are separate, being made \
jf cotton —6 chain, decreasing to 1.
The slippers are made by crocheting
7 chain, decreasing to 1, and are attached
to the skirt. Commence the bag with
4 chain, join into a ring, and increase

stitches wide, and long enough for the
length to go round. Sew sides of strip
over ring and join ends together. Knit

tinue to work 1 treble over 1 treble until
it is long enough.
To finish off, miss every alternate stitch
and break off. Then run a draw thread
in the remaining stitch.
For the bells make 12 chain into the
ring, then 12 d.c. Next row work 2
d.c. into each d.c. of first row, making
24 stitches altogether. Continue on these
24 stitches until 10 rows are worked.
Work a picot edge (i.e., 3 chain into
every d.c.) in blue. Make 5 bells alto-
gether. Run a draw thread at the top
and insert a folly bell in each. Sew one
on top of stem and the other four in
pairs about 2 inches apart.
KOALA OR NATIVE BEAR
Though the Kangaroo is our national
animal, it enjoys less popularity now than
the Koala or Native Bear. The children
love to watch them climbing the tall gum
trees, but they prefer to hold their fluffy
bodies in their arms. This crochet Koala,
although not the real thing, will bring
hours of happiness to the little ones.
Materials. —l oss. mid-brown 4 - ply
wool, crochet hook No. 11, kapok for
stuffing, 2 eyes, small pieces of black
oilcloth or suede from which to make
the nose and claws, a wire brush.

To Make Up
Pin out each piece and press. Brush
up all the parts well with a wire brush
(the cars need to be very fluffy). Cut
10 cardboard buttons 1$ inches across.
From the oilcloth cut an oval piece for
the nose about 1J inches long by 1 inch
wide, and two straight pieces for the fore
paws about J inches long, with 5 points
at the end. The pieces for the hind legs
are cut similarly only about 1 inch long.
Sew up leg seams; stuff legs firmly,
then insert at top of each a cardboard
button, pierced in centre with a paper
fastener. Place in position and sew on
strongly with head of fastener to inside.
Sew up arm seams, sewing in daws at
tha same time, with the points sticking
out. Stuff these firmly and sew 2 card-
board buttons at top as described for legs.
Sew up body seams. Place legs in


INEXPENSIVE GIFTS
QUAINT TOYS THAT COST NOTHING
The Fijian Lady is made from nigger
brown or tan stockings, in either silk or
wool. Wash the stockings and iron them,
then cut them down the seam at the
back of the leg, and cut out two shapes—
a head, body, two arms and two legs.
Tack them together right side facing, and
stitch round, leaving the top of the head
open.
Turn the material right side out, fill
it with cotton wool, any scraps of wool
stocking cut up small will do, push the
filling down the arms and legs with the
aid of a pencil, and when it will hold no
more, sew up the hole in the doll's head.
Twist two or three strands of wool or
silk round the neck, wrists, and ankles,
draw it tight, and tie it securely. This
helps to make the doll a better shape.
position on body, then insert a card-
board button inside body where legs are
to be attached, pass prongs extending
from top of legs through centre of button
inside, then press prongs open. Fix arms
in the same way as legs, then stuff body
firmly and place a cardboard button at
neck. Sew centre piece to sides of head,
leaving a space at top open for stuffing.
Sew up neck and place a button inside
head. Pass the prongs of neck button
through head button, press prongs open,
then stuff head firmly and sew up open-
ing. Sew on ears. Fix eyes and nose
into position and mark the mouth with
black wool. Sew one foot flat on the
bottom of each hind leg with the points
sticking out. Smooth the animal down
with the wire brush.
The eyes are made from two large linen
buttons, the pupils are drawn in black
ink, the nose and mouth are worked in
red silk or wool.
The hair is made of short lengths of
coarse black wool, doubled to make loops,
and are drawn through with a.crochet
hook. Pull the two ends of wool through
(the same as for rug making), knotting
tire wool firmly in place. Do this right
over the head, making it look very bushy.
For the skirt, take some brightly
colored raffia, twice the length required
for the skirt, tie it tightly round the
doll’s waist, allowing the same length of
raffia above the waist as below it, tie it
very tightly in place, then allow the
upper half of the raffia to fall over the
waist line, thus making a very full skirt.
Obtain some bright colored beads and
place a string round the neck, one bracelet
round each wrist, and round the ankles.
Sew several round the waist over the
and the Fijian Lady is complete.
The Aboriginal Mammy is made up
in the same way, only - black stockings
are used instead of brown. Clothe her
with a few colored pieces of material
from ycur scrap bag, add earrings, made
from just a few gold or colored beads.
Her hair is made of darning stitches,
but each stitch is left in a loop instead
of being drawn tight ; this looks like
short, curly hair. Wrap a piece of colored
material round the head, and knot it in
front.
These dainty gifts can be made from
lengths of left-over wool or silk. It is
not the value of the gift, and every girl
who can sew, crochet or knit can make
gifts that are attractive and useful as well
as individual.
There is the gift for the knitter who
is always grumbling that her stitches
come off the needle. This" gift is made
from scraps of wool or silk, two thimbles,
a scrap of elastic, and a quarter of a
yard of ribbon.
Commence with three chain, joint.
Ist row: Crochet two into each stitch.
2nd row: Two into every second stitch.
3rd row: Two into evlry stitch, which
gives you eighteen stitches.
Crochet round and round for nine rows,
then once around with another color ;
then, with the first color, two into each
stitch, and it looks like a little helmet.
Make twq of these; stretch the elastic,
and sew to the ribbon ; join to each
helmet, insert a thimble in each, and your
little gift is made. You can decorate
them as you wish. If you like put a
pair of knitting needles in the thimbles.
To make the hat you will require one
reel of silk at 4d.
Commence with three chain, join.
2nd row: Two stitched into each.
3rd row: Two into every second stitch.
4th row: Two into every stitch:
continue without increasing for nine rows;
crochet one row of contrasting color, then
two into each stitch; next row, two into
every fourth stitch; then ten rows, which
makes the brim.
For the underneath, crochet a perfectly
flat) round to match, join, and cut two
pieces of flannel for the needles. Insert
between hat and underneath rim, and put
a dainty bow to tie it with. A little row
of rosebuds makes it very dainty.


ATTRACTIVE MOTIFS
FOR TRACING
These quaint drawings are so easy to
trace and embroider or paint. The
children love to blend colours and see
what realistic effects they can obtain.
All you have to do is to trace the
design on the article by means of carbon
paper and a sharp pencil. Then paint
in bright colours, or work the design in
brightly coloured cottons. They arc suit-
able for feeders, table cloths, book co vrs
or play aprons.
The fish would make an attractive finish
to your bathing costume ; in this way your
last season costume can be made to look
quite fresh again. The country children
who have no bathing costumes can trace
and work the fish at the end of a guest
towel, or a table runner.
Work little Miss Muffit or Peter the
Pup on baby’s feeder.
The Christmas tree can be traced on
to cardboard and coloured, and then cut
out and used to mark the place where
anyone will sit at meal-time on Christmas
Day.
Another very novel idea is to make
your own Christmas cards. Cut out smal
oblongs of white drawing paper and pain!
a design at one end. (Of course it will
be much smaller than the original.)
Write your Christmas greetings on the
rest of the card.

Peter the Pup
