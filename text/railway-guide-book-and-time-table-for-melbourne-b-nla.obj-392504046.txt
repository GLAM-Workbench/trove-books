Australian inland waters offers every inducement. There is too
much variety for the scene to become monotonous. The
change from cliff and bluff to wide river flats extending far
back through their marginal belt of noble timber, with an
occasional flock of emus feeding tranquilly thereon ; the weird
effects of light and shade caused by the play of the electric light,
as by night the steamer sweeps round bends, almost brushing the
illumined foliage ; the excitement of a snake race, as the swim-
ming reptile endeavours to avoid the stroke of the paddle ; the
trip by buggy from Overland Corner to Renmark, where, in three
hours you cut across to a point which takes the boat (following the
sinuosities of the river) the whole day and far into the night to
reach ; the sight of the Darling river at its junction with the

PREFACE.
■ is claimed for this publication that it contains compre-
hensive and useful information for travellers upon the
Overland Line between Melbourne and Adelaide, presented
in a more legible form than the limited space available in
other Guides permits of.
The importance of this main trunk line as connecting
more colonies than any other line does should be sufficient
warrant for publishing a separate Guide Book for it. If
the public think so, and that the present effort to supply
the want is sufficiently meritorious to deserve support, the
publication will be continued and improved.
The Compiler is indebted to several gentlemen (Officers
of the Victorian Railway Department and others) for
assistance rendered in the preparation and revision of the
following pages, and he will be glad to receive suggestions
or additions to make future editions of the work more
perfect.
CHRISTOPHER CRISP.
Express Office, Bacchus Marsh


Inquiry Office at Spencer Street Station,
For the convenience of the Travelling Public an
Inquiry Office has been established at the Spencer
Street Station. It is situated on the Main plat-
form, immediately opposite the Boohing Office, and
Passengers requiring information on railway matters
are advised to apply to the Officer in charge.
The office is provided with all Intercolonial
Railway Time Tables, Postal Guides, Directories,
Maps, and Coach and Steamship information ; and
is connected by telephone through the Central
Telephone Exchange with Subscribers in all parts
of the city and suburbs.
Passengers intending to visit any of the adjoin-
ing colonies for the first time, and wishing to
obtain information as to fares, train time, changing
stations, luggage, &c., may obtain all such informa-
tion at the Inquiry Office.

from Messrs. Cobb & Co. at the following fares st class, sin* e,
48s. ; return, 755. ; available for a month. They do not issue
2nd class tickets. . .
Travelling by way of Serviceton, passengers would icquue to


leave Spencer Street either at 6.50 a.tn., reaching Serviceton at
10.8 p.rn. and stopping there overnight; or leave Spencer Street
at 6.50 p.m., reaching Serviceton at 10.5 a.m.; or by the 4.40
p.m. Express train, reaching Serviceton at 3.15 a.m. Arriving at
Serviceton by either of these trains, passengers would go on by the
12.50 p.m. mid-day train as far as Wolseley, arriving thereat 1.12
p.m. ; change trains, and leave by the 3.22 p.m. train for Isarra-
coorte, reach that station at 5.56 p.m., change trains, leave Narra-
coorte at 6.15 p.m., and arrive at Mt. Gambler at 9.35 p.m.
From this it will be seen that, if the passenger be a gentleman or
lady unencumbered with much luggage, and not afraid to face a
50-mile coach journey, the route via Casterton is far preferable, as
it entails fewer changes of trains, and less waiting about at inter-
mediate stations.

not be recognised, and the holder of an unstamped ticket will be obliged

the tickets are not available to break journey (except in the case of
tickets issued for very long journeys, such as from Beechworth to
Portland, or from Echuca to Bairnsdale. when passengers are allowed to
break their journey, either going or returning, for three days at
Melbourne); and in addition, before starting on the return journey from
the seaside, it is necessary to take the I’eturn half of the ticket to
the ticket clerk in order that it may be stamped with the date the return
journey is commenced, otherwise it wall be treated as informal at the
first checking station, and the holder of it will be obliged to pu chase
a fresh ticket to continue the journey. All the necessary information
is printed on the back of the tickets, so there should be no excuse for
anyone not knowing the conditions, but frequently the conditions are
not read.

in number, are allowed to travel first-class on payment of second-class
fares, upon production of a certificate signed by their manager and coun-

features of interest which usually distinguish the approaches to
a large metropolis, albeit picturesqueness cannot be claimed for
the Footscray landscape, yet the vastness of the expanse of
dwellings, with the large Yarraville Sugar Refinery, the long-
range of buildings of the New Zealand Grain and Wool Co.,
and the massive flour mill of Messrs. Brunton & Sons, together
with the bustle of the immense railway yard, with its numerous
sidings, sheds, and trains in all stages of preparedness for work,
presents a picture of commercial activity and prosperity very
cheering to persons of a practical turn of mind, especially to
those who remember that, while loveliness of scenery is admir-
able it is often but a poor support to a great city. Travellers
on the new Direct Line to Ballarat via Bacchus Marsh, Ballan,
&c., leave the Sandhurst Line at Braybrook Junction, where
the factories of Messrs. Wright & Edwards and of the Braybrook
Implement Co. are noticeable. The only railway work of note
before reaching this spot is the iron bridge over the Saltwater
river. This was erected in 1857, by Mr. G. C. Darbyshire, C.E.,
then Chief Engineer of Railway Construction, and although this
bridge, with several others, was criticised by the superficial
observers of those times as being needlessly elaborate and
expensive for the duty it had to do, the fact that it has cost but
little for repairs, and is practically indestructible is a reply to
such shortsighted economists. The Saltwater river bridge
was constructed in the year 1857, and forms part of the
main line from Melbourne to Sandhurst. It is situated about
two miles and a quarter from Melbourne, and carries a
double line of railway over the Saltwater river. The
bridge is built of wrought iron, resting upon abutments
of bluestone, and consists of one opening of 200 feet ; the
length of the main girders being 216 feet. In consequence
of the unreliable nature of the ground, which consists of
mud of unknown depth, it was found necessary to drive


a considerable number of piles to sustain tbe abutments
and wing walls. The heads of the piles are embedded
in concrete, and the masonry footings built thereon. The
total depth of footings, including concrete below the
surface of the ground, is about eighteen feet. The external
faces of the abutments and wing Avails are quarry faced,
with draught margins; the caps, coping, &c., being medium
axe-dressed. The main girders (three in number) are
constructed of wrought iron, and are of the box girder
pattern, with cellular top flanges. The rails are laid
upon the longitudinal bearers, which, Avith intermediate
planking, are supported upon transverse wrought iron
girders 3ft. 6in. centre to centre. The total height of
the rails above the usual water level is about 25 feet.
After passing the Braybrook Junction the scenery is flat,
atony, treeless, and uninteresting. Lithofracteur factories and
bluestone quarries flank the line, and at Deerpark a hill of low
elevation, called Mount Derrimut, is to be seen to the south of
the line. This was famous several years ago as the home of the
celebrated shorthorn herd of Messrs. Morton Bi'others & Leach.
It derives its present name from being (or haA'ing been) a depot
for deer belonging to the Melbourne Hunt Club. The Sunbury
ranges to the north afford a pleasing prospect, but the character
of the country immediately adjacent to the line continues to be
of the same uninteresting character until Melton is reached. It
may be mentioned, hoAvever, that Mt. Atkinson, near Rockbank
station, Avas the scene in the early days of the murder by the
blacks of a settler and his shepherd, and that Hume and Hovell
crossed to the sea coast about this spot in 1825.
Melton township is situated about tAA’o miles north of Melton
station, and is a picturesque hamlet Avith a remarkably pure
atmosphere, equable climate, and many advantages which
attracted settlement to it in the early days when railways had
not spread the population far and wide and given a choice of
location not governed as in those days, by proximity to Melbourne.
Melton is the headquarters of a large Shire ; has tAvo handsome
stone churches, and should become a place of residence competing
with many similar localites within the-same distance of Mel-
bourne, but one drawback to its progress is the absence of any
public Avatei’ supply. A Aveir has recently been placed in the
Toolern creek, and there is also a reservoir fed by that creek,
but a water tower and pumping plant are required to enable a
reticulation scheme to be carried out.


About two miles from Melton one of the most elegant, vet
massive, and instructive engineering works in the whole world
is to be found, namely, the iron viaduct over the Werribee river
and gorge. The great majority of passengers by train pass over
this bridge without noticing its existence, nevertheless it is 1230
feet long (nearly a quarter of a mile), and consists of 15 spans
of lattice girder iron work standing on similarly constructed
piers which are bolted to solid bluestone masonry bases, each
of which is an enormous work in itself, both above and below
ground, being bedded on immense thickness of cement concrete
carried down to great depths, in some cases 25 feet, and there
resting on a bed of greasy and very dense lignite. This
structure was carried out by Mr. John Robb, contractor, at a
cost of about £ISO,GUO. The iron work was all imported from
England, each piece being accurately fitted for putting together
when landed on the site it was to occupy.
The Werribee Viaduct was constructed in the year
1884, and it is situated at about 24| miles from Mel-
bourne, and two miles from Melton. It carries the rail-
way over the Werribee river and valley. The viaduct is
built of wrought iron resting upon bases of bluestone and
cement concrete, and consists of thirteen openings of 60
feet each; there are fifteen piers of 30 feet each; giving
a total length of girders equal to 1,230 feet. In conse-
quence of the very unreliable nature of the ground in
the river valley (which consists of alternating beds of
sand, gravel, clay, and lignite) it was found necessary to
carry the cement concrete foundations of seven of the
piers down to a considerable depth, but with these
exceptions a solid bluestone or sandstone foundation was
found for the piers at a few feet from the surface. The
bluestone used in the bases of the piers and in the
abutments is rock faced on all exposed surfaces, with all
beds and joints rough axed in through courses. The
wrought iron portions of the piers are securely bolted
down to the bluestone bases, and are built up of two
channel-iron bars, with plate-iron and diagonal bar con-
nections ; the legs so built are framed and braced in
stories of 25 feet in height generally ; the outer legs
having a batter of 1 in 8; each storey, when constructed,
becoming the- foundation upon which the next storey is
erected. The high piers are formed of three such
stories, giving a height of 80 feet above the stonework,


and a spread of 42 feet at the bottom. The tops
of the wrought iron legs are securely connected, trans-
versely, hy means of rolled-joist beams, Avhich form the
beds upon which the girders rest. The girders are con-
structed of drought-iron, and are of lattice pattern; non-
continuous, with expansion joints at every alternate pier.
On these girders are riveted transverse rolled-joists to
which the 5-inch redgum decking is bolted. ' A light
lattice pattern handrailing is constructed along each side
of the viaduct. At the present time only one line is
laid along the viaduct, but sufficient width is provided
for a second line. The total height of the rails above
the usual water level of the Werribee river is about 125
feet. The Moorabool viaduct on the Geelong line is about the
game length, and 100 feet high. The girders are of the con-
struction called Warren girders, each 130 feet long, resting on
solid bluestone pillars.
Timber country of a medium grazing character accompanies the
line up to Parwan station, the range to the northward still being
a pleasing feature in the prospect in that direction. The land on
both sides of the line from Melton to Parwan belongs to Messrs.
Staughton, sons of the late Simon Staughton, Esq., one of the ablest
of the old pioneers of the colony, and a man much in advance of
his time, as many of his compeers were. It should be noted to
the credit of Mr. S. T. Staughton, M.L.A., that he made a present
to the Government of a large portion of his land, although he
derived no personal benefit from the construction of the line.
Aftei passing Parwan the line descends to the Bacchus Marsh
valley, the most picturesque spot, with its adjacent high lands
further on, to be met with on the whole journey until the
Adelaide hills are reached. Passengers get brief glimpses of
fertile flats of the English meadow character, with beautifully
wooded arid variously shaped hills and ranges still to the north-
ern d, and pleasing indications of town settlement dotted over the
middle distance, for the line is one mile south of the town.
1 iiis is one of the oldest settlements in Victoria, having been
entered Gy white men with sheep in 1836. Its name is derived
lioni one, ot the earliest settlers, Captain W. H. Bacchus, born
in 1782, and formerly a Captain of the 18th Light
Dragoons, subsequently Captain of the Second Surrey
Militia, a member of an old English family called Bauhus or
Baccus, which lias been traced back to the Battle of Boioughbridge
in 1322. Early in 1838 this gentleman and his son (the former


died in 1849 and the latter in 1887, both aged 67 years) came
to the east or Melbourne end of the valley with sheep from
Tasmania, and camped at the Pyreete creek. The land to the
west, up as far as Mt. Blackwood, was then occupied by Mr.
Kenneth S. Clarke, manager for the Great Lake Company of Van
Dieman’s Land. This gentleman left Georgetown Heads, Tasmania,
in the schooner Hetty on 24th March, 1836, with 600 sheep and
other stock. Mr. Clarke started on 29th November, 1836, for the
valley since known as Bacchus Marsh, and at the beginning of
1838 moved on to the hills called by him and since known as the
Pentland Hills, where he had already formed outstations. Mt.
Blackwood at that time was called Clarke’s Big Hill. Mr. Clarke
gave up the country about the valley to Captain Bacchus and son,
on the understanding that they did not occupy any country which
ho claimed on the Pentland Hills. Mr. Bacchus, jun., took up
his quarters at the hut vacated by Clarke on the Lerderderg (or
Lardedairk, as it was then called by the natives.) The name
“ Bacchus’s Marsh,” as all old colonists called it, arose from Mr.
Clarke giving it that name in 1838 when informing his employers
of the arrangement he had made with Captain Bacchus, and that
name was adopted by travellers and others, also subsequently by
the Government. The locality seems to have been known even in
those early days as good country, for Messrs. Whyte, also from
Tasmania, took up a portion of Clarke’s run, and had to be bought
out for £IOO, They took up country on the Wannon, to which
they had been directed by Mr. Bacchus, jun., who had seen it
when travelling overland to Adelaide with cattle. A desperate
attack was made upon them by the blacks, who could not be
driven off until thirty or forty had been killed.
The first survey of Bacchus Marsh was commenced about the
end of 1839, by Mr. W. W. Darke, who was instructed by the
Sydney Government to mark off a number of allotments for
retired officers of the army and navy who had land orders from the
Home Government which were taken as cash. Mr. Darke named
the parishes, selecting wholly native names. The following is an
extract from one of these old Crown Grants :—3oth Nov., 1842.
Parish of Korkuperrimul, County of Bourke. Acres 101. Grant
to Alexander M‘Crae, entered as No. 387, folio 110, Register No.
1, of Port Philip Land Purchases, in the Surveyor General’s
Office, Sydney, 30th December, 1842. Enrolled in the Supreme
Court of N. S. W., for the District of Port Philip, in Land
Purchases Book A., page 33, 22nd February, 1843. Under Regu-
lations of sth December, 1840, Alexander M'Crae purchased 101


acres for £1 per acre. Allowed £97 as balance of £2OO authorised
for him as a late Captain in 11. M. 84th Regiment of Foot of
upwards of twenty years service, under regulations of Ist August,
1838. Sir George Gipps, Governor.” The above land is now
readily saleable at £9O per acre.
The progress of Bacchus Marsh since those days has been slow,
but steady, and it now possesses a town water supply, also gas
works, very enterprisingly established and admirably carried out
by Messrs. John Coates & Co. The buildings are mostly of brick
or stone, and the town has, therefore, a substantial appearance,
aided by the comparative narrowness of the main street and the
compactness of the centre of business there. The Church of
England building (both outside and inside) is one of the hand-
somest specimens of Early English Gothic architecture to be found
anywhere, and the existence around it of an ancient churchyard
(very rare in Victoria) adds one of the many English-village
characteristics at once noticed by visitors. Here the grave of
Captain Bacchus (the donor of the Church lands) is to be seen,
the tombstone bearing the following inscription : —“Sacred to the
memory of Captain William Henry Bacchus, who died February
26, 1849. Aged 67 years.” The church is built of local freestone
of an ironstone character, with Waurn Ponds freestone facings, as
the architect, the late Mr. Alfred Wyatt, objected to the local
freestone, which, however, has been used in the local post-office
with admirable effect. The other churches in the town are the
Roman Catholic, built of brick, and the largest in the district.
Adjoining it is a handsome brick presbytery recently erected for
two resident priests. A Convent boarding 1 and day school, also of
brick, has been purchased for the Sisters of St. Josephs, and is
situated on rising ground near the Church of England. The
Presbyterian congregation is one of the oldest established in the
colony, and now possesses a handsome and exceedingly substantial
bluestone church with freestone facings, erected immediately
opposite the Church of England. The Baptists have a brick church
near the State school (also of brick) which latter property has been
improved by the addition of a head teacher’s residence. The
Wesleyans have just erected a neat little wooden building. These
four denominations all enjoy the services of resident clergymen,
and the Salvation Army also maintain one or two officers and
rent barracks. The post-office before mentioned is embellished by
a tower in w’hich Mr. S. T. Staughton, M.L.A. for West
Bourke, has generously placed a striking clock. The Shire offices
and Mechanics’ Institute form a large building of brick ; and there


is also a Friendly Societies’ hall, the property of the Free Gardeners.
To the north of the town the Coimadai lime works and
surrounding farming population maintain a small post town, with
an excellent hotel kept by Mr. W. Bennett. This is a locality
having many attractions for tourists, and the Coimadai Mineral
Springs have a very high reputation. Further north the road to
Gisborne via Bullengarook is extremely picturesque, and the
whole country in this direction, including the Lerderderg and
Goodman’s Creek valleys, has scenery equal to many much better
known localities to the east and south of Melbourne. The
solitudes of spurs of the Dividing range are easily reached in this
neighbourhood.
The Pentland Hills to the westward have been famed for
many years as highly picturesque and fertile, their more humid
climate giving them an advantage over the lowlands. The town-
ship is called Myrniong (formerly Blow’s flat) and possesses two
good hotels (well suited for families wishing to stay in a rural
locality not overrun by tourists) also a Mechanics’ Institute, two
churches, and an agricultural show ground. To the north the
beautiful scenery and elevated outlook from Mt. Blackwood are
within easy distance. Also, further northward still, the mountain
goldfield settlement of Blackwood, with valuable mineral springs
and scenery of a Blue Mountain character is well worth visiting.
Near the Bacchus Marsh railway station the showyards of the
Bacchus Marsh Agricultural Society are situated, the handsome
grand stand denoting its character. This Society has been one of
the most remarkable successes in the colony, a fact verv largely
due to the unremitting attention given to its welfare by its
President, Mr. Thomas Cain, J.P., who has held that position
uninterruptedly since the re-organisation of the Society in 1885,
its origin on this spot dating from the early 50’s.
“ Maddingley Park,” adjoining the station, is so called from
the fact that the Government laid off a township of that name on
this bank of the river in 1853, but it never made any progress,
and the opening of the railway has not as yet effected much
improvement, but no doubt this portion of the district will
advance more rapidly than other places less favourably situated in
respect to the station. The Park was coveted in the 60’s by
the 42nd clause marauders of those days, and was rescued as a
public recreation ground by the exertions of Or. George Dickie,
J.P., assisted by the then member for Grant, the late George
Cunningham, Esq. For several years the area was let on grazing
lease, and when the Railway Department took a large slice off it


for the station not much bad been done to improve it, but since
then, under the able Curatorship ot Mr. John Johnstone, and the
affectionate supervision of the Trustees (Messrs. W. Grant, G.
Dickie, T. G. Pearce, T. Anderson, and E. G. Jones) a very
marked improvement has been effected by tree planting, garden
formation, the erection of a fountain (presented by Mr. A. D.
Hodgson, of Melbourne, a native of Bacchus Marsh) and an
Aquarium. A lake has been formed, a drinking fountain erected,
an oval fenced off, swings erected, and many minor improvements
effected, to say nothing of those contemplated, which make this
Park, small in area though it is, quite a model one for all country
towns and a rebuke to many wealthier districts which have
effected far less with vastly greater resources at their back, for
this Park is entirely supported by voluntary contributions aided
by an annual Shire vote and usual share of the Government
subsidy.
The best scenery between Melbourne and Ballarat begins to
present itself shortly after leaving Bacchus Marsh station.
Bowsley station, which has been provided for the convenience of
settlers mostly resident several miles to the south and south-west
of it, restores the line to the level it lost after leaving Parwan,
and from this point the ascent of the Dividing Range which inter-
venes between Melbourne and Ballarat commences. As far
back as 1840 this route between those two towns was
selected for a road by the Sydney surveyors. Superficial
observers, noticing the railway line doubling upon itself on the hill
to the westward above Rowsley station jump to the conclusion,
in which they have been aided by people who should be better
informed, that this horseshoe bend, put in to accommodate Bacchus
Marsh, has materially injured the line for through traffic in respect
to lengthening it, increasing the gradients, and adding danger-
ous curves. Such is not the case. The natural features of the
country necessitated a rise of 800 feet in 80 chains, no matter
what route was adopted, and all surveys made to cover the distance
between Bacchus Marsh and Ballan failed to find any point of
ascent other than the one now adopted, namely, at the foot of the
racecourse hill running out at the Parwan creek where crossed by
what is locally known as Collie’s bridge. Had the line been con-
structed from Parwan station to that point so as to avoid Bacchus
Marsh it would have formed the other half of the ellipse which the
present line forms, and the ascending grade through the long
cutting which usually requires the employment of two engines to take
heavy trains up would have been attacked at exactly the same level,


and at a greater cost for expensive bridge works rrter the Parwan.
The line might have been twenty chains shorter, but otherwise
would have presented the same features as at present in all haulage
and safety aspects, but passengers would not have had the oppor-
tunity of indulging in hasty criticism of the propriety of construct-
ing the line where it is which the nearness of the low and high
level lines now affords them. If the line had been carried further
southward in the forest it would not have earned the Bacchus
Marsh and Pentland Hills traffic, and from all the thickly populated
area to the north up to Bullengarook, which would have had to
be accommodated by a branch line at considerable expense for con-
struction and for annual working. The following detailed infor-
mation respecting the two routes above referred to should
silence the ill-informed objectors to the present line :
The line as constructed between Parwan station and the Dog’
Trap Reservoir is about 24 chains longer than the route surveyed
via " Ryan s Corner (near Parwan station) and Collie’s bridge
(close to the Dog Trap Reservoir) between the same points.
The two lines re-join at the road about midway between the
crossing of the Parwan creek and the Dog Trap (dully on the
Ryan's Corner route ; and therefore the long gradient of 1 in4B
from the Parwan creek on towards Gordons must have been the
same upon either line. On the Ryan’s Corner route the gradi-
ents would have been comparatively easy between Parwan
station and the crossing of the Parwan creek, where the steep
ascending gradient of 1 in 48 commences, which is common to
both routes. Ihe length of ascending gradient of lin 48 upon
that portion of the Ryan s Corner route between Parwan station
and the Dog Trap Reservoir would have been about 110 chains
in length, against 240 chains of 1 in 48, and 27 chains of 1 in
30 ascending, and 90 chains of 1 in 49 and 45 chains of 1 in 50
descending gradient upon the line as constructed between the
same points. If the line had been constructed via Ryan’s
corner it would have been necessary, in order to accommodate
Bacchus Marsh, to construct in addition a branch line to that
place. And a viaduct would have been required over the
Parwan creek of similar construction to that over the Werribee.
The length of this would have been about 300 feet, and the
height about 120 feet. This detour of four miles has its exact
parallel on the old Geelong route to Ballarat, solely to touch
Geelong, and not on account of engineering difficulties. The
through trains used to run two miles into Geelong and two
miles back again in order to resume the main line journey.


No one ever noticed this, and therefore never complained of it,
hut it was a thoroughly useless encumbrance on the through
traffic, which is not the case on the Bacchus Marsh route, for
the detour, although so noticeable, was quite unavoidable on
account of the natui-al configui-ation of the countrv. A similar
bend of about six miles occurs between Mitcham and Belair on
the Adelaide end of the overland route. Those places are
about two miles distant from each other as the crow flies, but
are eight miles apart by railway line, the cause being that
Mitcham is 241 feet above sea level and Belair I,tX)B feet above
the sea.
The extensive panoramic view spread out to the east and north
as the train curves round the racecourse hill and embankment
forming an amphitheatre of most noble proportions elevated from
100 to 200 feet above the plains is one typically Australian in all
essential features, and when seen under favourable atmospheric
conditions it is one of the loveliest to be met with on anv railway
journey in any i>art of the world. The play of sunshine and cloud
and the aerial effects generally, with the township in the distance
afford a picture of great beauty for its vastness of scope and
variety of future. In the immediate foreground the racecourse
and giand stand of the local Racing Club will be noticed.
From Kowsley station for a distance of about eight miles in
the direction of Ballan the earthworks are exceedingly heavy ;
the embankments contain a little over a million cubic yards, and
the cuttings between the same about half-a-million cubic yards.
The f< •rmation for portion of this distance is, however, wide
enough for a double line of rails. The highest bank—that over
the Dogtrap Gully—is about 105 feet, and the deepest cutting
is about 56 feet. The width of the embankment over the Dog-
trap gully is about 38 feet at the top, and 380 feet at the
bottom in the widest part.
Greystones, a handsome two-storey building of bluestone,
with beautiful grounds surrounding it, is situated to the south-
west of the bend in the line, and is the residence of Mo'esworth
R. Greene, Esq., J.P., a well-known pioneer in Victoria, New
South Wales, South Australia, and Queensland. He was one
of the first settlers who imported shorthorn cattle.
Very valuable clay deposits for making sanitary pipes
and the best delf ware are being opened up near the
Dogtrap reservoir, a siding being put in for taking away
the raw material to he manufactured near Footscrav.
A costly engineering work which passengers have not time to


appreciate is passed shortly before the train enters the long cutting,
and it is the construction of the enormous railway embankment
here in such a way as to act as a dam for the storm waters (some-
times phenomenally heavy) which gather in the gorge known as
the Dogtrap gully. To have provided waterway for these would
have necessitated the construction of a costly bridge (owing to the
height at which the line crosses this spot) or of extremely massive
stone bridges or culverts of low elevation to carry the heavy weight
of earthwork forming the embankment. Consequently a reser-
voir of very large dimensions has been constructed by building the
railway embankment in the most substantial form employed when
forming reservoirs, and the water face has been thickly lined with
puddled clay, upon which several hundred yards of bluestone
metal have been spread to counteract any possible waterwash.
Provision has been made by water pipes laid in specially prepared
trenches under the embankment to carry off the water stored in
this reservoir (which can accumulate to a depth of 50 feet if the
rainfall is copious enough) for use elsewhere, either at the Bacchus
Marsh station, or for sale for irrigation purposes. In any case the
method of construction adopted here had the balance of advantages
in its favour, including that of absorbing the material taken out of
the cuttings, which was a matter the railway engineers had to
consider, although it so happened that the contractors for this
portion of the line (Messrs. Horace Bastings & Co.) adopted the
plan of building this large bank out of material obtained for the
most part from private property not included in the line of route.
These embankments and cuttings are the heaviest for their mile-
age in Australia, and it is extremely creditable to the contractors
that they completed their work seven months before actual
contract time. Credit in connection with this truly formid-
able section between Howsley and Ingliston station should
also be given to the field surveyor, Mr. Leo Cussen, B A.,
now practising as a barrister ; to Mr. G, C. Darbyshire,
0.E., who has had great responsibility in connection with the
matter for over thirty years, and to Mr. W. C. Billings, the
Department’s Engineer of construction while the contract was pro-
ceeding. The public are always too ready to censure their public
servants, but persons competent to judge of the difficulties that
had to be surmounted, and of the problems that had to be dealt
with in constructing this trunk line are emphatic in their praise
of the successful designing and completion of this interesting
section of railway construction.
The Dogtrap Gully Reservoir embankment was constructed


in the year 1889, and is situated about 37 miles frot
Melbourne. In order to convert the Dogtrap gully into
reservoir for railway and other purposes the embankment
about 105 feet high, was strengthened by having the slop
on the water side flattened to 3 to 1, and rendered water
tight by a layer of clay puddle three feet thick, which i
protected from the action of the water by a layer of broke]
stones nine inches thick. The embankment is about 3i
feet wide at the top, and 380 feet wide at the bottom a
the deepest part of the gully, and contains 238,000 cubi
yards of earthwork in addition to 7,840 cubic yards o
clay puddle and 1,800 cubic yards of broken stone. Ai
outlet pipe 12 inches in diameter, furnished with outlet wel
and valve, is carried under the embankment, securely beddec
in cement concrete, and a bywash for the overflow is pro
yided by cutting through the undisturbed original rod
formation near the end of the embankment, over whicl
bywash the railway is carried by a light timber bridge o
four openings each fifteen feet. The depth of water °whei
the reservoir is full to the level of the bywash is 50 feet.
The ascending journey to Ingliston is marked by glimpse;
(chiefly on the northern side of the line) of beautiful scenery inclu
ding rugged hills of all shapes and angles, with intervening dells o
cultivated or densely timbered country, the homesteads on tin
Pentland Hills forming a cheering background. The pollarded
trees near Ingliston are worthy of notice as an excellent examph
of the good effects obtained by this mode of treatment.
Ingliston estate and homestead near the station of tha
name is so named after its founder, the late Peter Inglis
Esq., who lies buried in a private cemetery there. Hi;
eldest son, John Ord Inglis, Esq., who now owns tin
property is known all over the colonies as the owner o:
the famous racehorse Malua, and as a popular racing mar
as well as a particularly able amateur rider. It is wortht
of notice in this connection that the Ballan Shire Counci
possesses the unique honour among such bodies of havin<
as two of its Crs. two owners of Melbourne Cup winners
as both Mr. Inglis and Mr. Donald Wallace hold seats ii
the Council.
Dalian marks a change in elevation and climate, appreciated bi
travellers as one for the better in summer, but disliked in wintei
for its comparative bleakness. The town is well commanded
the line, and is seen to have considerable scenic merit, with Mt


Stemlitz catching the eye in the immediate background, and Mt*
Blackwood more eastward. The elevated position of the town*
and its cheerful Australian aspect, with its street gum trees, give
it a pleasing appearance likely to be improved as the population
becomes larger. This town is also one of the oldest in Victoria,
but having^been comparatively isolated from Melbourne on the
one hand,'and overshadowed as an inland town by Ballarat, has
not made such rapid strides as it is likely to do now that the
Direct Line draws support to it from the Ballarat side and gives it
command of Melbourne markets. The Ballan mineral springs, a
few miles to the north of the town, are extremely valuable in all
qualities looked for in the best mineral waters. This town is the
head quarters of the Ballan Shire, and has recently been provided
with a splendid water supply in conjunction with the Railway
Department. There is a flourishing Agricultural Society ; with
showyards close to the line. A local paper, the Ballan Times ,
has recently been started. Further particulars will be found on a
separate page.
Beyond Ballan splendid potato land is met with, especially
about the Black hill, Gordon, the altitude of which and its fertility
render it a noteworthy landmark.
The first glinipsu of ruining is caught away to the left ot the
line on the Egerton side of the Gordon station ; and also in the
same direction at Warremheip, but it is not until Ballaiat itself is
reached that the fact of it being a gold field capital becomes
apparent, and then not so markedly as at Sandhurst. The scarred
landscape away at the Black hill and in the Redan direction,
with a few poppet heads visible, give Ballarat the characteristics
expected to be found there, and the bold features of Mt. Warren-
heip, also of the slopes of Sturt street, and its division practically
intotwo streets by the central open space stamp the city with an
individuality very attractive to visitors. No doubt that central
space has been a sore vexation in many business and municipal
respects, but it has been turned to the best account, as a site for
statues and for trees. As years roll on, and Ballarat inci eases in
wealth and population, this unusual feature in cities will be more
highly prized, and treated more in a continental manner, but on
similar lines of development to those at present adopted, with
more of the landscape gardening element added. It is curious to
notice how completely the two sides of Sturt street are separated,
and vet how equally they have progressed, notwithstanding the
wide intervening space. There is probably no other instance in
the colony of a main street of a city being so divided in fact


though united in name and with the two sides equal in value ;
business frontages. It is evident, however, that Lydiard stree
from the railway station downwards, is the Collins street .
Ballarat, and its comparative narrowness has had something to c
with this, as well as its being the highway to the station—wind
by the way, is at present dingy by daylight and positively dismi
and dangerously ill-lit at night. A great improvement is near]
completed in having the passenger platform shifted to the city-sit
of the station, thus obviating the necessity of crossing the line i
a. level crossing at imminent risk from trains coming into an
leaving the station. However the Ballarat people and membei
could have put up with this state of affairs, and the very unpn
possessing appearance of the station generally, for so long a tinu
altogether passes comprehension.
The expansiveness of Ballarat is noticeable not oidy in ij
>Sturt street esplanade but in the extraordinary erections whic
many of the shopkeepers build (or used to do, for the practice ha
lately been stopped by the Police) far out on the footpaths, thu
out-distancing a similar “ rag fair” tendency to catch the wa)
faring eye noticeable in many of the business streets of the suburb
of Melbourne. In fact Ballarat has a strong likeness to thos
suburbs. If Ballarat prides itself upon one thing more thananothe
it is upon its “ garden city” reputation for its streets, lake, am
gardens, with the statuary in the last-named. The trees are most!'
gums, and have the merit of not unduly littering the sidewalks, &c,
with falling leaves, and are probably useful as sanitary purifiers, bu
they are somewhat sombre, and perhaps not long lived. It is i
difficult thing to get perfection in street planting, and Ballarat ii
entitled to credit for having attempted the task on a large scale
with what success experts and Father Time must decide. Th(
lake and gardens we consider less attractive than they shouk
be, considering their value to Ballarat as earning visitors’ monei
and as a local beauty spot, also remembering the large resource:
of Ballarat to maintain them. The banks of the lake are dis
figured by unsightly private boat houses; there is not a gooc
fountain in any part of the Gardens, and nothing has been done tc
relieve the lake of its “ swamp” appearance by planting an islanc
or two in its limited yet monotonous expanse, nor have all the
reeds been cut down. If there were no funds for these improve-
Ballarat might stand excused, but with a population ofaf
least bO,OOO to draw upon to support these gardens, and a large
Government grant, together with liberal donations of statuary
from private citizens, these gardens are not nearly so creditable to


be citizens of the two Ballarats as they have been flattered into
elieving they are. The Fernery is good and extensive. The
Flight from Pompeii” and “ Modesty” are high-class and unique
;atuaiy worthy of a pilgrimage to the gardens to see them.
The following is extracted from a Guide Book issued by the
Proprietors of Craig’s Royal Hotel -.—The “ Garden City” of
Tctoria stands 1,437 ft. above sea level, and is the centre of a vast
gricultural and gold-mining district. It is made up of three
mnicipalities—The City' of Ballarat, Town of Ballarat Bast, and
loro ugh of Sebastopol, and numbers a population of about 40,000,
he City covers an area of 4 h square miles, and contains over 50
dies of made streets. Anthony Trollope, who has seen nearly all
le world, has of brave cities praised this one of Ballarat in the
blowing terms :—“ Ballarat is certainly a most remarkable town,
u struck me with more surprise than any other city in Australia,
n point of architectural excellence and general civilized city comfort
is certainly the metiopolis of the Australian goldfields.” An
.merican visitor, a member of the Senate of the United States,
le Honorable D. S. Hastings, spoke of Ballarat as—“ The most
irprising inland city, considering its age, he had ever seen, and he
links there is no other inland city in the world, of its age, com-
irable to it for size, extent, population, and the solidity and mag-
iticence of its public buildings and general improvements.” Mr.
’ennedy, too, of the “Twa hours at hame” company, who has
avelled all over the world, says of Ballarat, “ It is the bonniest
ty of all the colonies.” Thus do its visitors regard this great
onument of auriferous wealth and human enteiprise. Ihe town
‘ Ballarat East has an area of 6f. square miles, and 32 miles of
reets have been made therein. The principal points of interest
, the visitor are, in the first place, the gold mines, access to which
usually courteously allowed to visitors. Lake \V endouree,
xmt one mile west of the Post office, is reached by omnibus and
am car. The lake is nearly four miles in circumference, and has
3on its waters a large fleet of boats, yachts, and half a dozen
earners. It is well-stocked with English peich, tiout, caip, and
her fish, available to the angler in the season. The Botanical
ardens are situated on the western shores of the lake. The City
all is open to the public, and a very good view of Ballarat can
; had from the tower. The Charitable Institutions, Woollen
Tils, School of Mines, Mechanics’ Institute, two Free Libraries,
id the Phoenix and Union Foundries, are all worth visiting,
he Ballarat Fine Art Public Gallery containing some really good
ctures, is well worth visiting. It is the first gallery of tlie kind


ever opened in a country town in Australasia—probably in any
Britisli Colony—such galleries having hitherto been confined to
the capitals of colonies. The Water Commission’s Reservoirs are
easily reached within an hour from Ballarat, and are among the
most complete in the southern hemisphere. They are four in
number, and have a storage capacity of 620,000,000 galls. The
environs of Ballarat present many points of interest. The site of
the Eureka Stockade—a spot hallowed by painful memories of the
early digging days, is to be found in Ballarat East, while in the
old cemetery the visitor may view with mournful interest the
graves where almost side by side sleep the soldiers and the diggers
who fell on the Eureka during the historic struggle of 1854. A
stone memorial has been erected on the site of the Stockade, in
commemoration of that event. The Government donated four
64-pounders, which are mounted at the four angles of the monu-
ment. Buninyong, the site of the first gold discovery in Victoria
is seven miles from Ballarat, and is reached by a good and very
picturesque road. Mount Buninyong is 2,448 feet above sea level,
and on its eastern slope there is a very remarkable volcanic crater
of immense size and shape. The Mount is easy of ascent, and
from its summit, reached in about an hour from the village, a grand
view of the western portion of Victoria is obtained. Mt. Warren-
heip, also close to the village of that name, is 2,463 ft. above sea
level. Lake Burrumbeet is on the Ararat line of railway, thir-
teen miles from Ballarat, and within five minutes walk of the
village railway station. It is over twenty miles in circumference
and is well stocked with good fish. Cod 401 b. in weight have been
taken from its waters. Lake Learmonth, which washes one of the
most picturesque villages in Australia, is fourteen miles from
Ballarat and has a water area of 1,200 acres. Creswick, eleven
miles on the Maryborough line of railway, is an important mining
centre worth an afternoon’s visit. At Lai Lai, thirteen miles
distant from Ballarat, by rail, the iron mines and works, and the
brown coal mines are well worthy of inspection, and the visitor
should certainly view the Lai Lai and Moorabool waterfalls in the
immediate vicinity. Capital trout and perch fishing is to be had
within easy walk of Lai Lai station. Ballarat City stands over a
vast net-work of miles of mining drives. Fathoms below the
Royal Hotel, years ago the miners excavated golden washdirt and
trucked it along the drives to Bath’s shaft, then at the intersection
of Sturt and Lydiard streets. The history of Ballarat is a strange
and eventful one. Less than thirty years ago it was a camping
ground for the aborigines, to-day it is by far the largest and most


mportant inland city in Australia. Craig’s Royal Hotel is one of
he oldest and most notable landmarks of Ballarat. Its history
ates from, and is intimately associated with the very earliest
liases of tented goldfields life, of the days gone by. With Ballarat
t has risen, and, as of old, so now, represents the aboriginal inter-
iretation of the word “ Ballarat”—“ a resting place” a home for
hose whose wanderings may lead them to the “ Golden City of the
South.”
Full particulars respecting Ballarat trains can be obtained
i Kessell’s Monthly Guide. An excellent Guide Book for
lallarat has also been published by Messrs. F. W. Niven
; Co., with a beautiful photograph of the “ Flight from
’ompeii” group of statuary. This picture is alone worth
tie Is. charged for the book. For a full account of Ballarat
se Mr. Withers’ history, which is the standard work on
he subject.
Not till Ballarat has been left behind, and the train with gather-
rig speed is rushing out into the open country which lies to the north-
west, does the traveller realise that he has commenced the over-
land journey to another colony. Unfortunately for lovers of the
picturesque the greater portion of the distance between Ballarat
and Murtoa (both in going to and returning from Adelaide by
Express) is traversed either after nightfall or before dawn.
In summer time a glimpse of the Ballarat city suburbs, through
a portion of which the Maryborough line may be seen trending
away to the right, is obtainable. A mile or so further on and the
Scarsdale junction is passed ; then away through a rich agricultural
district, open plains, with hills in the distance ; the landscape
dotted with homesteads, and newly harvested crops, which are
faintly visible in the gloaming.
Thirteen miles out and Burrumbeet Station is slowly passed as
the staff exchange is effected ; and if it be clear moonlight a good
view of the Lake itself is to be had—a sombre waste of waters
gathered in a vast depression in the undulating country ; its shores
at the northern end bare and treeless, its broad expanse unflecked
by any sail of boat; a weird scene by night and an uninviting one
at any time.
Before thirty miles have been covered the plains are exchanged
for timber. Beaufort, the next stopping place, is a little mining
town, pleasantly situated at (he foot of some ranges, with a good
farming area in the immediate vicinity.
If the night journey interferes .with the travellei's’ prospect of
the country, it yet allows him some compensation by affording


him both at this and the two next stations a view of the inhabi-
tants of the town, as they have a fashion of “ doing the block’ r
every evening on arrival of the Melbourne Express ; the “ block”
being the station platform.
In live minutes the starting bell rings, and the train, panting
up a heavy incline, reaches the summit of the range. A rapid run
through a wild bit of forest follows, and the descent to Middle
creek brings us to a complete transformation in the scenery. Some
of the most beautiful park-like country in Victoria is now traversed.
At Buangor, the great Dividing Range, which has hitherto
bounded the distant view to the north, comes closely into the
line. Mt. Buangor is passed as nearly as is Mt. Macedon by the
Sandhurst line ; while at a comparative!}' short distance Mt. Cole
and other well known peaks may be discerned.
At 9.30 the Express runs into Ararat. The importance of the
station is apparent from its size, and this is not due solely to the
extent of the town, but because the railway to Hamilton and
Portland branches off here. The junction with the Avoca and
Maryborough line being likewise effected. There are few more
prettily situated towns than Ararat, though to obtain a proper
appreciation one must leave the station and pass up the slope of
the hill which forms its site until vantage ground is attained for a
delightful panoramic view. Flanked at either approach by the
castellated buildings of the Lunatic Asylum, and the turreted
masonry of the jail, both of which edifices are erected upon adjacent
hills, Ararat presents quite a continental appearance, and differs
most noticeably from the general run of inland towns.
The line now crosses a spur of the “ Divide” which, bearing
away to the left, becomes a marked feature in the landscape.
Suddenly, among the timber, signs of cultivation appear, and
immediately the train is speeding through the famous vineyards of
“ Great Western.”
Stawell, the third halting place from Ballarat, is essentially a
mining town. Poppet-h eads, sludge heaps, and other tokens of the
industry are visible in all directions. The town itself is much
larger than Ararat, and is somewhat similarly situated on the side
of a hill, from the summit of which an extensive view is com-
manded. If it were daylight the traveller would here catch his
first glimpse of the “ Grampians,” in which the long spur of the
“ Black Range to the south unexpectedly terminates, and beyond—-
stretching away towards the west, and cutting the sky with as
much distinctness as if chiselled—tower the glorious mountains,
ridge above ridge; bold, abrupt, precipitous : sufficiently near to


show the magical effects of the play of light and shade upon
granite peak and timbered ravine ; and sufficiently remote to do
justice to their colossal proportions.
The stone for the front of Parliament House, Melbourne, was
brought from the Grampians; a tramway connecting the quarries
with the main line at Stawell.
Thirteen miles further to the north-west the Wiinmera river,
which gives its name to an immense tract of country, is crossed.
The peculiarity of this stream is that, instead of pursuing its
course to the sea, it gathers in several tributaries, turns due north
at Horsham (being again crossed by the railway line near Dim-
boola) and finally loses itself in Lakes Hindmarsh and Albacutya
in a feeble endeavour to reach the Murray.
After passing Glenorcby the outlook becomes tame and
monotonous. A level, timbered tract stretches on to Lubeck,
where the cockspur line to the wheat growing district of
Rupanyup branches off. Then gradually the timber becomes
lighter ; open plains, dotted with clumps of buloke, become
frequent; and by the time Murtoa is reached the arid region
of the Wimmera is fairly entered on.
Unlike the older towns, this new stopping place of the
Express has a new look. Many of these settlements have only
sprung into being within the last ten or fifteen years, their
birth and progress being due to the bursting up of the
squatting estates, and subsequent settlement of the people on
land which, up to that time, had only been regarded as fit for
sheep grazing purposes.
Until the opening of the Warracknabeal railway, which
junctions with the main line at this point, Murtoa was the
centre upon which a huge grain traffic converged. Now, the
extension northward, and the Rupanyup line to the east, have
considerably interfered with its business prosperity.
Leaving Murtoa the main route bears down eighteen miles
to the south-west, to accommodate Horsham, the principal town
in the Wimmera ; and then turns almost due north to Dimboola
to regain the lost ground. Horsham thus becomes the apex of a
triangle, the base line of which, had the railway continued its
direct course, would have been fourteen miles shorter than the
two sides of the triangle which the track now follows. This
deviation is somewhat of the same nature as the old route from
Melbourne to Ballarat via Geelong, now happily nothing more
than a recollection. Little did the unwary traveller suspect that,
on every journey to and from the metropolis, or vice versa, he


was being mulcted in a sum of ss. 6d. for extra mileage, besides
losing half-an-hour of valuable time. And now that these dis-
abilities are removed, in the best possible manner, at the instance,
chiefly, of Bacchus Marsh residents and of present and recent
Parliamentary representatives of the district, he evinces no
adequate appreciation of the boon conferred.
Horsham possesses some tine buildings, both public and
private, but is unfortunate in being situated on a level plain, with
nothing to relieve the eye but the fringe of timber which skirts
the Wimmera river to the south of the town.
As the train heads away again northwards the course of
the river can be discerned by this marginal forest, while away to
the west, on a clear day, Mt. Arapiles and Mitre Rock are plainly
visit de.
At Dimboola the traveller makes his first acquaintance with
the great Mallee country —a belt of the “Malice” scrub coming
close to the Wimmera at this point. A pretty, comfortable-
looking town is Dimboola, pleasantly situated on a site which
rises gently from the river. Magnificent gums are scattered
about on the flats, and the Wimmera, which here has expanded
to a considerable stream, affords scope for the efforts of a rowing
club, and thus adds variety to the otherwise limited pleasures of
a coun'ry town.
Settlement is going on vapidly to the north of Dimboola;
all the Mallee for twenty-five miles to Lake Hindmarsh, and
eastwards to Warracknabeal, being in process of rapid conversion
from a lone wilderness to a settled and prosperous farming
community.
One of the most important of the projected railway lines due
north will take its departure from Dimboola—a line which, if
continued, will ultimately reach Mildura and tap the Darling
trade. From a statesman’s point of view this extension will
partake of the character of a national trunk line, as feeders from,
the South Australian boundary, from fifty to sixty miles distant,
can be brought in at intervals, and thus the reticulation of the
whole of this vast territory be accomplished. It should be
obvious to our legislators that the line claiming first attention
in the Mallee country is one which skirts the Victorian border,
in order to commercially annex territory naturally belonging to
Victoria, but temporarily called South Australian—a term which
should never stop the enterprise of railway constructors or
managers, especially in these days of approaching Federation
of Australasia.


On the overland journey between Melbourne and Adelaide
the middle part of the route both going and returning' is
traversed in the “ wee sma’ hours ayant the twal.” At Dim-
boola the Adelaide and Melbourne trains meet, and the punctu-
ality of the arrival of both is surprising; but on the extensive
plains which form so great a feature in this line lost time is
easily made up.
Nhill, a thriving new town which, ten years ago, was almost
unknown, is passed about 2 o clock in the morning, and
Serviceton is reached at a time when the first streaks of dawn
should appear, but do not, for the Melbourne time of the
travel lei s watch is ahead of the sun, and if he be intending to
sojourn in South Australia he will do well to put back the hands
of his watch 25 minutes, and take Adelaide reckoning from the
border of her territory. It is worth getting up early°or sitting-
up late to inspect the magnificent station and appointments at
Serviceton, situated on the boundary of the two colonies.
Nothing but sentiment could have justified the expense of such
buildings. However, as it bears the name of so eminent a
Statesman as that of the Hon. James Service, one of the
best of our public men, Victorians should not grumble, but
fervently desire such an increase in the prosperity of the
locality as shall at least lessen the existing incongruity
between the railway station and its surroundings.
Shortly after passing into South Australia the narrow
guage line of Mt. Gambier branches off Southwards towards
the Coast, and very soon the Great Desert is entered on. As
the morning gathers strength one of the most desolate scenes
imaginable opens up to view. Long undulations of sandy
country, rising at intervals into sand dunes, dotted with clumps
of mallee, and grassed with spinifex, affords a monotonous and
cheerless prospect ; yet for 90 miles there is hardly any
variation in the character of the country; sand hills and scrub;
one unbroken scene of loneliness ; intensified by the occasional
glimpse of the stone barracks erected at intervals along the
line as residences for the repairers, who thus dwell together in
little colonies.
Uninviting and hopeless as this Desert tract appears, it
absolute steiility is by no means assured. Water has been
discovered by sinking, and Mr. J E. Brown, late Conservator of
Forests for Sou'h Australia, has, by planting an experimental area
with forest and other trees, shewn how reclamation can be
hastened. These trees, though the rainfall is virtually nil, are, by


means of cultivation, and incessant stirring of the soil, showing
such thriving growth as to verify the projector’s most sanguine
anticipations,
Serviceton, whereat the train arrives in the early morning
(1 30 under existing arrangements) is just on the hither side of
the Great Desert—The Ninety Mile tract of limestone rock
whose excoriated sun-scorched and waterworn face affords scarce
sustenance for a goat. The rabbits live, however, and increase
and multiply, skipping about the scrub with its few- poor flowers
in hundreds and thousands. There is not much hope in tin's
wilderness unless it come into use as a wine-producing country.
Experiments have shown that tilled patches on its skirls have
yielded grapes of excellent quality Human life is very dreary
all across its hot barren breadths now. Only the daily train
comes to the station master. A roar, a whistle, a brief halt, and
ho is alone again as any Hermit in the rock cavern of Nitria.
At Coonalpyn a tongue of fertile land protrudes from the river,
and reaches far into the desert. It is well grassed, or covered
with salt and cotton bush, and will grow shadowy trees. But
soon again the scrub closes in, and there is little to delight the eye
until the long continued whistle announces the approach to the
Murray Bridge. Thence forward everything changes. All
memories of the dreary desert vanish in presence of the excellent
breakfast always provided at the bridge, which is indeed the best
railway refreshment station in all Australia.
When the other bank of the Murray is gained green fields and
cultivated paddocks are entered The rich red soil showing in
long fallows or clean furrows, similar in colour to that of many of
the volcanic hills of Victoria. But the crops are low, and the
grass is thin and wiry, for very little rain falls here.
Nairne, the next considerable township, is a very old-fashioned
place. An old inn, with old trees all about it, and quaint
cottages with gardens on the near hill sides. Such a village as
one finds at times in the first settled counties of New South
Wales, but seldom if ever in Victoria.
From Nairne. the road rises fast till the Mt. Barker Junction
is reached high up on the hills, and thence onward for many a
mile it is altogether a mountain journey. Sometimes the train
rides near 2,000 feet aloft and then on every hand are the ferns
and rich and shining foliage found on most of our Australian
coastal heights.
In a little while the smoke of Adelaide is seen far below ; and
beyond, scarce distinguishable, the waters of Gulf St. Vincent.


Down on the sides and in the gorges of the mountains now are
many patches of garden and orchard tillage, and busy folks garner-
ing vegetables and fruit and flowers. Germans, chieflv, these
mountain labourers; strong-backed women and sturdy girls
labouring with hoe and spade, while the men work with the
horse cart or the plough. And where the soil is not so rich there
are grass paddocks in which are seen many of the fragile fair
Australian flowers—the dainty bine hell, and the many orchids
with pale scentless blossoms, and tall fluty stems. And making
lines of beauty down all the water courses are the self-sown arum
lilies. It is a very fair approach to a bright and beautiful city,
and if it be in the spring time the plain to vyhich the traveller
presently descends will be found well clothed with grass and
growing grain.
Then, at length, come the olive hills—the first and most
characteristic feature of Adelaide. Then the tiny Torrens
trickling along in its deep bed. A glimpse of the gardens, and
the many plantations which bower in the city on every side, and
in a few seconds the train runs into the station set fairlv in the
heart of the cleanest and brightest and best managed Burgh of
broad Australia.
The following remarks respecting the line give some interest-
ing information Beyond Ballarat the cultivated country, the
lake at Burrumbeet and the ranges to and beyond Ararat present
many scenic attractions. Ararat, with its jail, lunatic asylum,
hospital, Ac., is a noticeable town, and tin vineyards passed
through half way to Stawell are most interesting ; and then the
great wheat growing plains of the Wimmera, through which the
rails pass, land one at the prosperous town of Horsham. Then
Dimboola, in its “arrested development,” and, a long distance
further on, the prosperous township of Nhill is reached The line
is laid through lightly timbered, and prettily dotted undulating
country, with fair friable soil and partly cultivated paddocks to
Serviceton, blessed with a rainfall averaging more than that of the
whole colony. Serviceton is another case of arrested development,
being Tom Tiddler’s terriioiy, and will remain so till the bigwigs
of the Privy Council decide the ownership, they being in no
hurry. Serviceton will be no great township during our gener-
ation. Serviceton has a large refreshment room, dining room and
kitchen, built jointly by Victoria and South Australia. The
rooms present a fine front, but the public accommodation is
limited in this expensive brick building. One of the parties to


the contract growled at the cost during its progress ; then followed
a decided railway construction economy, and the storey for sitting
rooms and I ted rooms for (he travelling public, also for the caterer
and staff, was altogether wiped off the plan. The Railway staffs
appertaining to Adelaide and Melbourne constitute the population
chiefly, supplemented by a double set of Custom House officials,
&c. The town contains three or four weatherboard boarding
houses; a couple of stores, one of which has a wine license.
Travellers sending letter or telegram to Mrs. Graham, Railway
Refreshment Rooms, Serviceton. stating number and requirements
can obtain good beds in Government buildings formerly the
Guv eminent Refreshment rooms, and in the new room sumptuous
fare on Murray cod, perch, Ac., can be obtained in the really
elegant dining room. From Serviceton to Boidertown is some
dozen miles, and then some scores of miles of dense and scrubby
scrub, till the Murray bridge station is discovered, and the inward
man can be fairly satisfied ; the table is liberally furnished, time
ample, place roomy. Thence towaids the clean, pretty and pious
city of Adelaide, through some romantic country villages, farm-
steads and cottages ; then “ old ruins in a young country,” deserted
cottages, and the remains of copper furnaces along the line, cross-
ing oeep gullies over unfenced or bare bridges seemingly strong
enough to bear a perambulator only, and then twisting most
unexpectedly into a tunnel, of which there are ten before reaching
the metropolis—ten tunnels in sixty miles.
A gentleman who has frequently tiavelled from Melbourne
to Adelaioe gives the following interesting description of the
journey : —From Ballarat to Murray Brii Ige I have always
travelled in darkness. The first break of dawn, as you look out
of your wind nv from your bed, shows you the Mallee country —a
dead level, chocolate or red soil, and thick Mallee scrub. Then
you dress, and crowd out on the small platforms of the sleeping
car, to see the Murray and the Railway bridge. The Murray
here is wide and slow in stream, with swamps and lagoons along
the banks, filled by the overflow of the river when in flood. The
Murray Bridge breakfast, with its frequent supply of perch, cod,
ami game, has often been written about. After breakfast the line
passes through some Mallee country of a different character from
that met with on the east side of the river; it is here undulating
with granite cropping out. Soon we come upon patches of
cultivation—a portion of that South Australian country which
yields such low wheat averages. Here also are deserted farms,
worked out, and the Mallee again thickly springing up, re-taking


possession of the land. We pass on now into light pasture land
(one sheep to the acre) with pretty rounded hills and deep ravines.
Ne:ir Here also are some abandoned or worked out mines, copper
(I think). The chimney stacks ami old rusty boilers, with the
mullock heaps still marking the shafts. Soon the line enters the
Mount Lofty ranges. There are many very picturesque spots,
and we get glimpses of pretty villas and gardens, which the
Adelaide people have built for summer retreats. On Mt. Lofty
is the South Australian Governor’s mountain house, the equivalent
of our Government cottage at Macedon, but it cannot be seen from
the line. At a station on the range we get the Adelaide morning
papers, and see our own names as passengers ; this information
has been wired from Spencer Street. The descent into Adelaide is
really beautiful. The train winds through the hills, threads
frequent tunnels, and you catch glimpses of lovely views. Every-
one looks eagerly to see that light bridge, standing in mid-air,
looking barely strong enough to carry a light buggy, that spans
one of the mountain ravines. It seems scarcely possible that it
can safely carry our heavy train. After this we see the rich
green plains of Adelaide right under us, with the sea beyond. It
quite gt\ es the effect of a pocket edition of the Lombardy Plains,
seen from a spur of the Alps. This impression is strengthened as
you enter Adelaide, where the bright coloured stone of the
buildings, the spires and Town Hall tower (which do very well
for campaniles) together with the olive groves, the mountains, and
the sea, increase the likeness that the city and its surroundings
bear to Northern Italy.
ADELAIDE TO SERYICETON.
This Railway commences at Adelaide and runs through
South Australian territory, as far as Serviceton, a distance
of 19d miles 74'; chains. It is a single line through-
out, and is the same guage as the Victorian Railways, viz.,
5 feet 8 inches. At about a mile from Adelaide the Holdfast
Bay Private Railway joins it, and the Glenelg Railway
Company s line is crossed on the level about 3 miles from
Adelaide. At about 31 j miles from the South Australian
capital we arrive at the Mount Barker Junction, from which
a branch line runs to Milang and Victor Harbour, the former
being miles, and the latter 81 miles from Adelaide. At
about 191| miles from Adelaide the township of Wolseley is
reached, from whence a connection is made with the South-


Eastern system of tlio South Australian railways, all of which
are constructed on a guage of 3 feet 6 inches.
Starting from Adelaide the Overland Railway lino to
Melbourne traverses the Adelaide plains with easy gradients,
and reaches the township of Mitcham in about 5} miles, where
the ascent to the Mount Lofty Range commences. The
gradient on this portion of the line is 1 in 50, and the curves
are as sharp as 10 chains, or 660 feet radius, as far as
Blackwood; there is then a break in the grade for about 2|
miles where the line traverses a spur connecting the front and
back hills, and from this point ascends with a gradient of
1 in 45 to the lowest saddle in the Mount Lofty range, viz..
Mount Lofty railway station, the rail level of which is 171L40
feet above the sea, or a rise of about 1,372 feet in about 12
miles. The only works of importance on this section are the
iron viaducts at 8} miles and 8 tunnels. The viaducts are
two in number, and cross two deep ravines, the height from the
bottom of the creek to the rail level in No. 1 viaduct is 106
feet, while Lie height of No. 2is 78 feet. The piers or trestles
are constructed of wrought iron, each pier having 4 legs,
divided vertically into spaces of 30 feet where the diagonal
and horizontal bracing is fixed. The legs stand on and are
bolted to piers of cement concrete built on the rock. These
piers support girders, upon which the bridge flooring and rails
are carried. In No. 1 viaduct there are 12 spans of 30 feet,
and in No. 2 viaduct 9 spans, and both the viaducts are set out
on a curve of 10| chains radius on a gradient of 1 in 82. The
girders are of the ordinary plate description and are not
continuous. They carry cross girders upon which buckle
plates are rivetted, supporting the ballast, sleepers, and rails.
The curves over the viaducts and for some distance at each end
of them are double guard railed, and between the guard rails
there is an iron plate 8 inches wide x j inches thick secured
to the sleepers, and designed to carry wheels of the engines
and carriages safely around the curve in the event of a derail-
ment. The tunnels are of the usual type, lined throughout
with bricks set in cement.
Starting again at the summit level at Mount Lofty station,
the line descends on a grade of 1 in 4’> to Ambleside, 27} miles
from Adelaide At 21£ mi es Aldgate !• 1 1 inis re vch d, nd at
23 miles Bridgewater station. The important w'orks on this
section consist of a bridge over Cox’s creek, about 23 miles
from Adelaide. This bridge.is a latticed girder bridge having


foui’ spans, two of 68 feet, and two of 70 feet. The level of the
rails above the bed of the creek is 51| feet. This bridge is
built of cast iron columns, 3 feet external diameter, two to each
pier, spaced 12 feet centre to centre, and ivell braced. They
rest on masonry piers varying from 4to 7 feet in height. The
abutments and walls are built of masonry, with stone
dressings. The flooring of the bridge consists of buckle plates
to carry the ballast, and steel guard rails are used to prevent
derailment, extending from end to end of the bridge where
they are united in a point.
The Onkaparinga river bridge is 26 miles 62 chains from
Adelaide, and is similar to the last in construction, with the
exception that the girders are plate girders, two spans of 48
feet, and one of 50 feet, and in this case the girders are spaced
12 feet 3 inch centres to enable the line to be carried by cross
girders and buckle plates. The columns are carried down to
a secure foundation and bedded in cement concrete. The
abutments and wings are of masonry, with ashlar dressings.
There is only one tunnel on this length between the 24th and
25th mile.
From the Ambleside station the lino rises to a second
summit at Mt. Barker Junction, 31} miles from Adelaide,
having an elevation of 1,425 feet above the level of the sea.
The ruling gradient on this portion of the line is 1 in 50, and
the minimum radius of the curves is 15 chains or 990 ft. radius.
The line then descends with a gradient of 1 in 45 to
Callington, where it crosses the Bremer river at 45 miles
50 chains from Adelaide. The level of the rails at the Bremer
river is 397 feet above the level of the sea. At 48j miles from
Adelaide a third but smaller summit is reached by a srrade of
1 in 25, the level of summit being about 640 feet above the
sea ; from which point the line falls steadily to the Murray
river, on a grade of 1 in 50 with twelve chain curves, at
60 miles 40 chains, and 140| feet above the level of the sea.
The principal works on this section are the Nairn e creek
bridges at 36 miles 31 chains, and 37 miles 53 chains : the
Scott’s creek bridge at 40| miles ; the Paringa creek bridge at
44 miles 64 chains ; the Bremer river bridge at 45 miles 48
chains ; the Rocky Gully bridges at 56 miles 34 chains, and
57 miles 30 chains ; and the Murray bridge at 60 miles 40
chains from Adelaide. The two bridges over the Nairne creek
are of a plate girder type of 40 and 60 feet spans respectively.
The 60 feet span bridge is built on a grade of 1 in 45, and a


curve of 14 chains radius, the angle of skew being 45 degrees.
The rails are carried on the top of the girders, in ballast on a
timber deck. The girders are 7 feet apart and 6 feet deep,
and are carried by cement concrete abutments and wing walls.
The 40 feet girders at 37 miles 57 chains are of the same class.
The Scott s creek bridge has four spans of iron lattice girders,
two of 77 and 80 feet respectively, carried by cast iron
columns, 3 feet external diameter, set in pairs 18 feet apart
on masonry piers well braced together. The heads of the
columns are connected together by a box girder, upon which
the main girders rest; they are 8 feet deep, spaced 8 feet
apart centre to centre, having a buckle plate floor carrying the
ballast. The girder beams are trough-shaped, connected
together by double open lattice bars inclined at an angle of 45
degrees. The abutments and wing walls are of masonry, with
ashlar dressings ; steel angle guard rails are carried across
the bridge, and brought together at a point at each end to
prevent derailment. The Paringa creek bridge, 52 feet span;
the Bremer river bridge, 60 feet span; and the Rocky gully
bridges, 46 and 62 feet spans respectively, are similar in
construction to the Nairne creek bridges.
The bridge over the Murray river was originally designed
as a road bridge, subsequently altered to carry the present
Railway line, it consists of two parts, one spanning the river
proper, the other being in reality a viaduct across the swamp..
The main spans over the river are five in ntimber, each 120
feet, carrying a single line of railway, with a roadway on each
side for vehicles, and cantilever footpaths outside the girders-
The upper boom of the main girders is trough-shaped ; the
lower boom consists of links and pins on the “ Warren s”
principle. The girders are about 9 feet 6 inches deep, 24 feet
apart, and connected together at the top by arched iron
latticed stays. The superstructure is supported on piers or
cast iron columns 7 feet external diameter, sunk in pairs
through the bed of the river to a rock foundation, met with
about 90 feet below the level of the water. The columns are
24 feet apart, and are strongly braced together from bottom to
top. That portion of the bridge crossing the swamp consists
of twenty-three spans of 60 feet, on a gradient of 1 in 200;
seventeen of the spans are straight, while the other six at the
Melbourne end are laid on a curve of 660 feet radius ; these
girders are continuous in sets of three. They are of the 14
truss design, vertical struts, and inclined ties ; the top and


bottom booms are both trough-shaped, and the web is double.
The cross girders on these and on the river spans are plate
girders, spaced 8 feet apart and secured to the lower boom, and
carry buckle plates which support the roadway and ballast.
The permanent way is laid across the river spans upon
longitudinal timbers, 20 inch by 9 inch, which also carries a
steel guard rail, but upon the viaduct it is laid on cross
sleepers, which rest on rolled longitudinal joists connecting the
cross girders. The superstructure of the viaduct across the
swamp is carried on cast iron columns 3 feet 6 inches diameter,
spaced about 24 feet apart, and like the columns of the river
spans are filled with concrete in cement. They are sunk to
depths varying from 50 to 60 feet beneath the swamp level.
The abutments at each end are of masonry, with ashlar
dressings.
This bridge being unusually long, viz., 1,980 feet, it was
considered desirable that it should be electrically signalled,
and the signal boxes are therefore connected by wires for
that purpose.
The total weight of wrought iron in this bridge is' 1,934
tons, and of cast iron 2,191 tons, and the cost was £12",U00.
The iron work of the river spans was made in South Wales,
at the Crumlin viaduct works, while that of the viaduct was
built by Hawkes, Crawshay & Co., of Gateshead, Newcastle
upon Tyne.
Leaving Adelaide by express train for Melbourne you
traverse a portion of the Adelaide plains immediately under
the hills, which are reached at Mitcham (the first station)
about miles from town. The line then ascends the Mt,
Lofty range hy continuous curves and tunnels until black-
wood is reached at a distance of about 12 miles. The rise
to Belair, the next station, is easier ; and the train is now
on a saddle which connects the hills fronting the plains with
the Mount Lofty range itself. After running about 11
miles the railway contours the range with a gradient of I
in 45, with sharp curves until the Mount Lofty Station
(19| miles) is reached at an elevation of 1,711 feet above
the sea.
The view' from the train in ascending or descending the
Mount Lofty incline is very Hue, and on a clear day the
traveller can see the coast line on the West side of St.
V incent’s Gulf, while the city of Adel dde is seen to advant-


age from the varying heights and different views obtained
as the train winds round the spurs of the hills. The
Mount Lofty ranges afford very desirable points upon which
residences have been erected for use during the heat of the
summer months ; the difference in temperature between the
city and the higher points on the range in proximity to
the railway line being about 10 degrees Fahrenheit. The land
adjoining the railway line is not much cultivated, but
nearly all the gullies are laid out for fruit, flower, and
vegetable gardens. English fruits, including the Chestnut
and Walnut, grow well, and the gardens are quite famous
for the large quantities of strawberries which they produce,
especially those at Belair.
After crossing the main range the train descends rapidly
with a grade of 1 in 45 to Aldgate miles fiom town,)
and thence rises slightly to Bridgewater station, 23| miles;
it then descends again rapidly to Ambleside (27|- miles),
where the level is 1.141 above the sea, or a descent of 570
feet from the summit in about eight miles. From Ambleside
the line rises with easy grades to Balhannah, 28| miles;
it then rises rapidly to a second summit at a distance of
31 f miles from Adelaide. A rapid descent thence com-
mences to Nairne, 34| miles. The country traversed
between Mt. Lofty and Nairne is under cultivation, the land
in this district being exceptionally good. The Oak bank
racecourse is near Balhanna, where the Onkaparinka annual
races are held about Easter.
From the Mount Barker junction, which is 31 \ miles
from Adelaide, a railway line runs through the town of
Mount Barker to Strathalbyn, and thence to Victor Harbour
and Go >lwa, near the .Murray mouth; while there is also
a branch line from near Strathalbyn to Milang, situated on
the shore of Lake Alexandrina, through which the Murray
river flows to the sea. The distance to Victor Harbour
from the junction being about 50 miles, and to Milang
about 32| miles.
The line on leaving Nairne still descends very rapidly
to the Bremer river at Callington, 45£ miles from town, at
•a level of 397 feet above the sea, or a fall of a little over
1,000 feet in 14| miles.
After crossing the Murray river the railway deflects
southwards and reaches Tailem Bend (so called from a bond
jn the Murray) in 75| miles from town. It then enters


the country known as the Ninety Mile Desert, in which
are the following stations, viz., Cooke’s Plains, miles ;
Coonalpyn, 114-J miles, where there is an artesian well
which supplies the locomotives ; Tintinara, 131 f miles ;
laide. ° This is one of the old South Eastern townships,
around which are several good sheep and cattle stations.
From Bordertown the line runs over fairly level country to
Wolseley, 119! miles from Adelaide, which is the junction
of the narrow gauge 3ft. Gin. system of the South K jst ern
district of South Australia. A communication is thus attordect
for travellers to go to Kingston via JNarracoorte and to Mt.
Gambier, „
From Wolseley the overland railway runs to the present
South Australian border, which is reached at 194 miles <3
chains from Adelaide, and continues to Serviceton, over dis-
puted territory, where the Victorian Railway authorities take
charge of the trains.
Serviceton is 196 miles from Adelaide.
The country on this section is very undulating, with very
little timber upon it, and is chiefly used for pastoral purposes,
for which it is admirably adapted.
In the neighbourhood of Scott’s creek, or about 40, miles
from Adelaide, there are several copper mines, some of which
have been worked with more or less success for many years.
The line rises from Callington over the range until a third
summit is reached at 48] miles, and at a level of 640 feet
above the sea, and falls thence steadily to the river Murray
bridge, at 601 miles, and at a level of 14Of feet above the
Between Callington and Murray Bridge the country is
chiefly scrub, although there arc some large farms under
cultivation. . . , e „
The Murray Bridge Station is the stopping place for the
express trains in the up and down journeys for refreshments,
and the rooms at the station have established an excellent
reputation for the manner in which the wants of tne traveller
are catered for. In fact it is one of the best refreshment
rooms on the railways in the colonies. Ihere are nine tunnels
on this line on the first 25 miles from Adelaide, and their ota
length is 1 mile 7 chains; the longest tunnel being 1,188 feet,
and the shortest 237 feet long. . , ,
■ The line is fenced throughout, excepting the portion through


the Desert, which will shortly he fenced in also. The fencing con-
sists of T iron standards fixed in cast-iron spear pointed sockets,
driven into the ground at intervals of 10 feet, carrying 6 wires.
It is 3ft. Tin. high and each panel is strengthened with patent
steel droppers, secured to the wires, which are all No. 6 gauge.
Cast-iron straining posts are erected every 300 yards.
The embankments on this line are 18 feet wide at formation
level and the cuttings 16 feet 6 inch. The ballast is of broken
stone and gravel when obtainable, 9 inches thick (3,000 cubic
yards a mile) under the sleepers on the hilly portion, and 6
inches (2,280 cubic yards a mile) on the level portion. The
rails are of steel, Vignoles pattern, 6libs, to the yard, with
Sandberg’s deep fish plates, which successfully prevent creeping
of the rails on inclines. The sleepers are of redgum and jarrah
jarrah 9 feet long, 9 inches wide and 4-| inches thick, spread
2 feet 8 inches centres except at the joints, where they are 2 feet
3 inch centres. There are about 2,014 sleepers laid to each mile
,of line.
The way, works, and buildings cost as under :—Adelaide
to Nairne, £17,067 per mile; Nairne to Victorian Border. £5,291
per mile. Hulling stock cost—Adelaide to Nairne, £1,222 per
mile; Nairne to Victorian Border, £947 per mile. Machinery and
Plant—Adelaide to Nairne, £638 per mile; Nairne to Victorian
Border, £236 per mile.
The total cost, including land and all expenses—Adelaide to
Nairne, £18,827 per mile; Nairne to Victorian Border, £0,474
per mile.
1 he country called the Desert is covered with scrub, and is
undulating, being interspersed with sand hills. It was used for
many years, and is now to some extent, as a run for sheep,
having been let at a low annual rental to stock holders for the
purpose of enabling them to move their sheep from the far North
during seasons of drought. It is not well watered, and until
the artesian well was sunk at Tintinnara the trains carried
the water required by the locomotives. Fortunately the bore
turned out successful, and there is now an ample supply. It is
eight inches diameter, and between 200 ft. and 300 ft, deep.
The traffic on this line is worked on the electric block system, and
all the stations are signalled and interlocked.
I here are running on this line the best sleeping cars in the
colonies. There are six of them in stock, and they were imported
on the recommendation of Mr. H. C. Mais from America. They
are of the kind known as the “ Mann Boudoir Car,” and have the


sleeping berths arranged across the car instead of longitudinally,
as in the Pullman car. These cars are mounted on bogie trucks,
having six wheels each, made of paper and tyred with sreel, the
object being to lessen the noise. The floors are double, and the
space between filled with cork shavings for the same reason.
The cars are fitted in Spanish mahogany and stamped buffalo
hide leather, and are supplied with every convenience They cost
about £4,000 each, fitted up and running, and are 60 feet long,
carrying twenty passengers.
The engines used on the steep inclines on the South Australian
side are of American and of English design. The American
passenger engine is of the Baldwin 6-coupled wheel type, 5 feet
diameter, with a double bogie in front. Cylinders, 19 inches
diameter, and 24 inch stroke. An 8 wheeled tender, carrying
2,200 gallons of water, weight of engine with water, about 39
tons, and have a rigid wheel base of 7ft. lOin. These engines are
used for passenger service. For the goods service the American
Baldwin consolidating pattern is used, having cylinders 20 inches
diameter by 24 inch stroke; 8 coupled wheels 48|- inch diameter
with a front bogie truck. Tiie tender is 8-wheeled, and carries
2,400 gallons of water. The weight of the engine in working
order is 45J,- tons, and the tender, with water, 24 tons.
The English engines are 6-wheels coupled, 4ft. diameter, with
double bogie in front, outside cylinders 18in. diameter by 24in.
stroke, with 6-wheel tenders. These are used for goods service.
The English passenger engines are 4-wheels coupled, sft. diameter,
with double bogie in front. These engines ran well and make
quick time with the express across the Desert, frequently running
60 mdes an hour.
The ordinary Ist class carriages are roomy vehicles carried on
bogies. The cars are 36 to 40 feet long, weigh about 17 tons,
and carry 48 passengers in six compartments. The 2nd class
carriages are similar, but weigh 15 tons, and seat 60 passengers.
The Westinghouse automatic air brake is in use on all ex ept
the waggon stock running on this line.
The whole of the surveys, contracts for construction, and
carrying out of the work, was under the control of Mr. H. C.
Mais, M. Inst. C.E., who recently resigned the position of En-
gineer-in-Chief, amidst general regret and many indications of
esteem. The whole of the railways in South Australia, except
about fifty miles, were carried out under his supervision.

In the flower garden propagate plants by layer-

stocks, mignonette, larkspur, &c. W’ater ca-
mellias, rhododendrons, azaleas, and such like
plants. Regulate climbing plants. Remove all
decayed leaves and flower-stems. About the end
of the month plant for early blooming a few
tulips, hyacinths, anemones, ranunculi, and
narcissi. Plant early potatoes. Plant out cab-
bage and cauliflower plants. Transplant celery
and leeks into trenches. Sow turnips, lettuce,
spinach, cabbage, and cauliflower. Dig in all
failing crops as they become unprofitable, and
get vacant ground ready for autumn cropping.
There is a critical moment for all things.

AUCKLAND, FROM THE WHARF.
d&ft UCKLAND, the capital of the New Zea-
land province of the same name, is finely
situated on the southern shore of the Waitemata
Harbour, which is formed by an inlet of the
Hauraki Gulf. It was founded in 1840 by
Governor Hobson, and became a burg in 1851.
It was the seat of the Government till 1865.
The city has a fine appearance, especially from
the harbour. A wharf of considerable length
has been constructed opposite the centre of the
city, and affords excellent accommodation for the
gradually increasing traffic.
St. Kilda.
St. Kilda, the pier and esplanade of which are
shown in one of our engravings, is a fashionable
watering-place and suburb of Melbourne. It is
about three-and-a-half miles south of Melbourne,
on the east shores of Hobson’s Bay. The espla-
nade along the sea beach is superior to any other
south of the line.
Out Shopping.
She walked into the dry goods store
With stately step and proud;
She turned the frills and laces o'er ,
And pushed aside the crowd.
She asked to see some rich brocade.
Mohairs and grenadines ;
She looked at silk of every shade.
And then at velveteens ;
She sampled jackets blue and red—
She tried on nine or ten —
And then she tossed her head and said
She “guessed she 'd call again."
Laughter made Profitable.
;_: The Wonderful Physician.
■m?.- : : _ -g£_. NE morning at daybreak a father came
jfj - into his son’s bed-chamber, and told
'Z him that a wonderful stranger was to be
seen. “ You are sick,” said he, “ and fond of
*r great shows. Here are no quack doctors
now, nor keeping of beds. A remarkable
being is announced all over the town, who not
only heals the sick, but makes the very grass
grow ; and, what is more, he is to rise out of the
sea.”
The boy, though he was a lazy fellow, and
did not like to be waked, jumped up at hearing
of such an extraordinary exhibition, and hastened
with his father to the door of the house, which
stood upon the sea-shore.
“ There,” said the father, pointing to the sun,
which at that moment sprung out of the ocean
like a golden world —“there, foolish boy, you
who get me so many expenses with your lazy
diseases, and yourself into so many troubles, be-
hold at last a remedy, cheap, certain, and de-
lightful. Behold at last a physician, who has
only to look in your face every morning at this
same hour, and you will be surely well."
“ Laugh and grow fat ” is an old adage ; and
Sterne tells us that every time a man laughs he
adds something to his life.
An eccentric philosopher of the last century
used to say, that he liked not only to laugh
himself, but to see laughter and hear laughter.
“ Laughter, sir, laughter is good for health; it
is a provocative to the appetite, and a friend to
digestion. Dr. Sydenham, sir, said the arrival
of a Merry Andrew in a town was more beneficial
to the health of the inhabitants than twenty asses
loaded with medicine.”
Mr. Potts used to say he never saw the
Tailor Riding to Brentford without feeling
better for a week afterwards.

Finish planting all sort of trees, choosing calm,
dull weather. Dig the flower beds neatly, add-
ing a little well-rotted manure if needed. Finish
the pruning of roses, &c. This is the best month
for planting all sorts of fruit trees. Begin the
pruning of fruit trees, taking first those which
have lost their foliage. Make small sowings of
early carrots, lettuce, radish, broccoli, cabbage,
and cauliflower. Make good sowings of peas,
broad beans, and leeks. The planting of rhubarb,
asparagus, &c., should now be finislied.
There is no day without sorrow.

St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney.
<&T. ANDREW’S Cathedral in Sydney had
// its foundation first laid on the ist of July,
1819, but has been pulled down and re-erected
three times. It is a handsome building, as will
be seen from our engraving, and belongs to the
Gothic of the fourteenth century. It stands in
George Street, which is two miles long, and which
forms the chief business street of Sydney.
The Exact Truth.
A party of English visitors were being shown
round a famous Scotch abbey, and one who
pretended to be the wit of the company said
to the guide, “ Now, old fellow, we don't want
any cock-and-bull stories about this old place.
Tell us what you are sure is true the exact
truth, you know.”
“Ay, sir,"quietly replied the guide, and walked
on in silence.
He led the party through the abbey, and then,
turning at the gate, said, “Ye’ve seen the auld
abbey.”
“ Yes,” said the Englishman, “ but can’t you
tell us by whom it was built, or anything about
it?”
“ The exact truth is,” returned the Scot,
“ that’s the auld abbey. I canna swear to ony
mair aboot it,” and he left them.
Where Warren Fell.
S YANKEE gentleman, escorting a British
friend around to view the different objects
of attraction in the vicinity of Boston, brought
him to Bunker’s Hill. They stood looking at the
splendid shaft, when the Yankee said, “ This is
the place where Warren fell.”
“ Ah ! ” replied the Englishman, evidently not
posted up in local historical matters, “ did it hurt
him much ? ”
The native looked at him with the expression
of fourteen fourths of Julys in his countenance —
“ Hurt him !’’ said he, “ he was killed, sir.”
“Ah ! he was, eh?” said the stranger, still
eyeing the monument, and computing its height
in his own mind, layer by layer; “ well, I should
think he would have been, to fall so far.”
Getting on in the World.
The first steps on the ladder of life are always
a little difficult for a man who has to make his
own way quite unaided up it. But then aid so
soon comes to him in the ordinary course of
things, if his footing is firm and his eye steady,
so that he d >es not tumble down in the mud dis-
gracefully at first starting. There is a natural
instinct among the better class of people to pro-
tect and aid the young. A bold honest lad wins
friendship and love without effort.

JULY]

Gardening for July.
Astronomical Notes.
There is not much to be done in the flower
garden this month. Attend to the neatness of
walks, borders, &c. Plant early potatoes. Sow
parsnips. Sow broad beans. Make plantations
of rhubarb and sea-kale. Sow peas. Do not
sow them in a plot by themselves, as experience
has taught that two rows, at a good distance
apart, will yield as much as three together, not
to speak of the seed saved. Sow the principal
crops of onions, radishes, spinach, &c.
Mercury, in the constellations Gemini and
Cancer, is in perihelion on the 2nd, in conjunc-
tion with the Moon on the 6th, in superior con-
junction with the Sun on the 7th.
Venus, in the constellations Taurus and Gemini,
is in conjunction with the Moon on the 4th.
Mars, in the constellation Cancer, is in con-
junction with the Moon on the 7th.
Jupiter passes the meridian of Melbourne at
4 43 a.m. on the Ist.


MAN who was very sad once heard two
boys laughing. He asked them, “ What
makes you so happy? ” “ Happy? ” said the elder.
“ Why, I makes Jim glad, and gets glad myself. 1 ’
“ I SAY. Pat, do you know what time the boat
sails?” ‘How do you know my name is Pat ?”
“ Oh, I guessed it." “ Then you can guess what
time the noat sails.”
“What is the first thing to be done in case
of fire ?” asked the professor. “ Sue the insurance
company,’’promptly answered the boy at the foot
of the class, whose father had been burned out
once or twice.
“Do you snore, Abel Adams?” inquired a
Yankee of his friend. “No, Seth Jefferson, I
do never snore.” “How do you know, Abel?”
“ Because t’other day I laid awake the whole

Voltaire was at
table one day when
the company were
conversing on the an-
tiquity of the world.
His opinion being
asked, he remarked
that “ the world was
like an old coquette
who disguised her
age.”
The Roman general
Metellus was once
asked by a young cen-
turion, what enterprise
he had then in hand.
And that the wise
Roman might free himself from such impertinent
questions from others, he told him,“ If he thought
his shirt was privy to any of his designs, he would
pluck it off and burn it.”
A Parisian, accompanied by his servant, who
was a Gascon, went to spend some days in the
country with a friend. On the morning of his
return, as he was on the point of departing, he
asked his servant if he had packed his portman-
teau. The servant replied that he had. “ But,”
said the master, “ have you put in everything
that belongs to us?” “Oh yes, sir,” said the
servant, "at least."
A Norman, who had stolen a horse at Rouen,
went to sell him at Falaise. The purchaser
having agreed about the price, suspected that the
animal had been stolen, and said to the seller,
“ Will you warrant him everywhere ? ” “ Every-
where,” said the Norman, “ except at Rouen ;
and I would further advise you to steer clear of
that town.”
M. dk Bautr6, being in the antechamber of

A person who had
some dangerous ene-

capable of attempting

he should leave the country. The answer he
obtained was, " Donline, stes securus ; ” a reply
which led him to believe he might safely remain
at home. Some days afterwards his enemies set
fire to his house, and it was with difficulty that
he escaped with his life. Then, recollecting the

The Last Word,
t® SHOULD like to know, said Mr.
Rambo, testily, when the conversation
had begun to wax warm, “ why it is that a
woman always wants to have the last word.”
“ She doesn’t," replied Mrs. Rambo. “ It’s a
slander.”
“My dear, it certainly is the truth. You
know you always ”
“Absalom, you know better. I don’t."
“ I am sure ”
“ No, you 're not. It isn’t so.”
“ Why, my dear, can’t you see ”
“ No, I don’t! And I think—boo-hoo—you
are—are just as—as mean as you can be.”
“ Well, dear, I ’ll take it back. You don’t
always want the last word,”
“Of course I don’t. I don’t see what you
wanted to say so for.”
“ Well, I won’t say it any more.”
“ Because you know it isn’t true ”
“ As well as I do.”
“I ”
“ You want it yourself: 1

“ You may be right, my dear,” said Mr.
Rambo, putting on his hat and going out.
“ I know I’m right,” rejoined Mrs. Rambo,

ALBURY.
Albury is one of the important and thriving
towns of New South Wales, on the confines of
that colony and Victoria. It is situated 531 feet
above the sea level on the right bank of the river
Murray. Its foundation dates from Novem-
ber 17, 1824, when Hume and Hovell encamped
on its site under a tree. During the season the
Murray is navigable to here by steamers.
The Spelling Lesson.
“Mother, the schoolmiss made fun of me
’cause I couldn’t spell ‘maid’ right.” “How
did you spell it, Johnny?" “ M-a-d-e.” “Of
course that is wrong.” “Yes; but I was spellin’
‘ old made ’-—a girl made a long while ago,”
An Unwise Father.
A man is anxious for the welfare of his family,
and willing to work hard for it. What steps
does he take to compass so worthy an end ?
Thinking, in a crude and narrow way, that
money and happiness are convertible terms, he
proceeds to absorb himself, body and soul, in
the pursuit of money. Now, undoubtedly, a
growing family needs money, but it also needs
much else that no money can buy ; yet of all
this he thinks not. He cannot give them his
time, his thought, his judgment, his influence,
for they are all drained away in his single
pursuit. It is, perhaps, needless to say that a
family’s best welfare cannot be thus attained.
The aim is good, but the method is insufficient.
He has missed the road, and cannot reach the
goal.
Quoth he, " You are my life, dear girl,
Consent my wife to be."
“ I cannot, George,” she quick returned;
“ The law forbids, you see."
“ The law forbids!" he gasped, “ Yes, George,"
She playfully replied,
“ If you should take ‘your life,' of course
You 'd be a suicide ! ”

ABSENCE. -H)
When the maid who pos-

Was content at my mansion
to stay
Rapid time was in haste to depart,
And the moments fled laughing away.
But now, since I see her not near,
And to seek her is not in my power,
Every day is as long as a year,
Every moment as slow as an hour.
A REBUKE.
Whilst in my absence, sir, you rail.
Your labour of its end must fail;
For who will then attend?
But when you praise me to my face,
1 own I feel the sad disgrace
Of being called your friend.
“You Should Marry.”
Sir, you are prudent, good, and wise,
I own, and thank you from my heart,
And much approve r» hat you advise
But let me think, before I start.
For folks well able to discern,
Who know what ’tis to take a wife.
Say, ’tis a cause of such concern
A man should think on't—all his life.

Permitted, unreproved, to gaze,
My favour’d rival idly strays :

Ne’er sees him shine but he adores.

As the passion 'twas meant to display.

Why ask so oft with fond alarms,
If constant I remain?
And o’er my heart how long thy charm*
Will hold their wonted reign ?
No more such questions let me hear,
Since I can ne’er reply,
I do not know, my Sylvia dear,
The day when I shall die.
Let this plain truth those ingrates strike
Who still, though bless’d, new blessings crave ;
That we may all have what we like,
Simply by liking what we have.

DECEMBER]
The end makes all equal.
[lB9l
Gardening for December.
Take up bulbs that have flowered and died off,
and store them in dry sand. Plant out dahlias
for blooming in autumn. Bud roses and fruit
trees. Hoe and earth up potatoes. Thin out and
weed onions, carrots, and parsnips. Store ma-
tured onion bulbs before they are spoiled for
keeping by the sun. Sow in the shade cabbage,
cauliflower, savoys, and Brussels sprouts. Make
small sowings of peas, kidney beans, turnips,
and spinach. Plant out early celery in trenches.

examined the negative. “ The expression is too

“All I wanted was a portrait to send to my

Friendly Criticism,
“ I never come late to a
friend’s dinner,” says Boileau,
“ for I have observed that
when a company is waiting
for a man they make use of
that time to load him with
abuse.”

courting.

A Wedding
Incident.
town hall; sydnev.
The time-hon-
oured custom of throwing an old shoe after the
bride and bridegroom had an unfortunate result
at a recent negro wedding in North Carolina.
Just as the happy pair were departing in a
waggon, an enthusiastic friend, owning a very
large foot, flung his shoe at them with such
unfortunately good aim as to knock the bride
senseless on the floor. The bridegroom jumped
out, punished the unlucky thrower by a sound
thrashing, restored his wife to consciousness, and
then resumed the wedding tour.
About to Marry.
There are two rules which it would be safe to
follow in all but a few exceptional cases : first,
for a woman to refuse marriage with any man
who is objected to by her male relatives, pro-
vided they are reasonably well acquainted with
the object of supposed affection ; and secondly, for
a man to refrain from offering his hand in mar-
riage to a woman who is not approved by his sister,
or, if he has none, by his judicious lady friends.

Investing in Knowledge.
fF a man empties his purse into his head, no
man Gan take it away from him. An in-
vestment in knowledge always pays the best
interest.
An old Dutch tavern-keeper, who had his third
wife, thus expressed his views on matrimony :
“ Veil, you see, de first time I married for love,
dat vos goot ; then I married for beauty, dat vos
goot, too, about as de first ; dis time I married
for money, and dis is petter as poth.”
The Town Hall: Sydney.
The Town Hall of Sydney, situated in George
Street, is a fine building, though some critics
object to it as being a little too florid. It is of
great size, with a tower 200 feet high, and is
deservedly regarded with pride by all residents
in the flourishing capital of New South Wales.
A Remarkable
Tradition.
It is related
of Lady Dillon,
daughter of the
Duchess of Tyr-
connel, that on
the death of her
lord she inhabit-
ed Laughlin
Castle, in Ire-
land, a princely
edifice, which,
with the sur-
rounding estate,
was assigned her
as her jointure,
on condition of
her residing in
the castle. She
fell in love with
an Englishman,
who could not
be kept from re-
tiring to his own
country. She determined neither to lose her lover
nor her jointure, and having ordered a banquet in
the garden, fired the castle, and feasted by the
light of the blazing pile ; and after supper, while
the towers were burning, she set off for England
with her lover.
I'll tell you a plan for gaining wealth
Better than banking trade or leases :
Take a bank note and fold it up.
And then you willfind your money increases.
This wonderful plan , without danger or loss,
Keeps your cash in your own hands, where
nothing can trouble it,
And every time that you fold it across,
It’s as plain as the light of,day that you double it.
Human nature will not flourish any more than
a potato, if it be planted for too long a series of
generations in the same worn-out soil.


fT is related of one of the French kings
that on being told the people made
free with his character in their
songs, he answered, “It would be very
hard if they were not allowed to sing for
their money."
Alphonso, King of Naples and Sicily, so
celebrated in history for his clemency,
was once asked why he was so favourable
to all men, even to those most notoriously
wicked? ‘ ‘Because,” answered he, “good
men are won by justice, the bad by
clemency.” When
some of his Minis-
ters complained to
him on another oc-
casion of his lenity,
which they were
pleased to say was
more than became
a prince, “ What,
then,” exclaimed
he, “would you
have lions and
tigers to reign over
us ? Know you not
that cruelty is the
attribute of wild
beasts clemency
that of man!”
One day, at Pots-
dam, Frederick the
Great heard from
his cabinet a con-
siderable tumult in
the street; he called
an officer, and told
him to go and as-
certain the cause.
UNREST.
certain the cause. The officer went, and
came back to tell his majesty that a very
scurrilous placard against his majesty was
fixed on the wall, but that it was placed
so high that a great crowd pressed forward,
and were pushing each other to read it.
“ But the guards,” he added, “ will soon
come and disperse them.” “DO nothing
of the kind,” replied the king; “fix the
placard lower down, that they may read
it at their ease.”
The last words of Charles V. of France,
surnamed “The Wise,” are memorable for
the noble moral for kings which they con-
tain—and, indeed, they are applicable to
all, as every man has the power to do good
or evil. “I have aimed at justice,” said
he to those around him ; “ but what king
can be certain that he has always followed
it? Perhaps I have done much evil of
which lam ignorant. Frenchmen, who now
hear me, I address myself to the Supreme
Being and to you. I find that kings are
happy but in this that they have the
power of doing good " This distinguished
monarch reigned in France from 1365 till
1380. He was the son of John “ the Good,”
who died in captivity in England,
Soft words break no bones.
AMIABLE KINGS.
An honest man's the noblest work of God. — Pope.
All day upon the garden bright
The sun shines strong ,
But in my heart there is no light ,
Nor any song.
Voices of merry life go by
A down the street ,
But I am weary of the cry,
And drift of feet.
With all dear things that ought to please
The hours are blest,
And yet my soul is ill at ease ,
And cannot rest.
Strange spirit , leave me not too long ,
Nor stint to give ;
For if my soul have no sweet song
It cannot live. American Author.
The Emperor Sigismund was reproached
for rewarding instead of destroying his
enemies, as by that means he gave them
an opportunity to injure him. “ What,”
said the noble-minded monarch, “ do not I
destroy my enemies when I make them
my friends ? ”
Louis XIV. was told that Lord Stair was
one of the best bred men in Europe. “ I
shall soon put that to the test," said the
king; and, asking Lord Stair to take an
airing with him, as soon as the door of the
i coach was opened,
he bade him pass,
and go in. The
other bowed and
obeyed. The king
said, “ The world’s
in the right in the
character it gives;
another person
would have
troubled me with
ceremony.”
When his Minis-
ter presented a cat-
alogue of his at-
tendants to Alfonso,
King of Castile, to
mark the names of
such as he deemed
superfluous and
burdensome to the
prince, reserving
some who might
be useful and ne-
cessary, the king,
on examining the
ring generous and
list, made the following generous and
witty answer: “Some of them I must re-
tain, because I cannot do without them;
and the rest I must keep, because they
cannot do without me.”
George 111., in his walks about his farms,
was often alone, and; many pleasant little
incidents occurred on meeting with rustics,
to whom he was sometimes unknown.
One day he had to pass through a narrow
hedge-gate, on which sat a young clown,
who showed no readiness in inoving.
“ Who are you, boy?" said the King. I
be a pig-boy,” answered he. “Where do
you come from? Who do you work for
here?” “I be from the low country ; out
of work at present.” “Don’t they want
lads here?” said the King. “I doan’t
know,” rejoined the boy; “all belongs
hereabouts to Oeorgy." “Pray,” said his
majesty, “who is Georgy ?” “He be the
king, and lives at the Castle, but he
does no good for me.” His Majesty im-
mediately gave orders at his farm hard
by to have the boy employed; and when
he saw him he told him to be a steady
lad, and “Oeorgy” might do some good
for him.

A person having an even number of counters
in one hand, and an odd number in the other, one
may by an easy process tell in which hand the
even numbers are. Let the person multiply the
number in his right hand by an odd number, and
the number in his left hand by an even, and let
him then tell you, if the sum of the products
together be odd or even. If it be even, the even
number is in the right hand ; and if it be odd,
the even number is in the left hand.
The puzzle consists in sliding the cubes from
square to square, without lifting or removing
them from the box, until they are placed in their
right order. It is easy enough to move the
squares up to 12 ; but to get the last three into
order is often a puzzle indeed. The Fifteen

AUSTRALIAN
‘UJUTDAL |? ROVIDENT SOCIETY
ESTABLISHED 1819.
IS the only Australian Life Assurance Society which DIVIDES
PROFITS AMONGST ITS POLICY HOLDERS Every
Year. The amount so divided for the one year, 1889, exceeded
Four Bundled and Twenty-Six Thousand Pounds.
It is the OLDEST, LARGEST, and WEALTHIEST Life Office
in Australia, and its Bonus Returns to Policy Holders
ARE NOT APPROACHED by any kindred Institution.
It holds STRONGER RESERVES than any other Australian
Office, and ITS INVESTED FUNDS now amount to
NINE MILLIONS STERLING.
Its Policies are FREE from all HARASSING RESTRICTIONS.
No other Office can offer Life Insurance at so low a net COSt,
or keep a Policy in force (should the Premiums be unpaid)
for so long a period by application of the surrender value.
The growing popularity of the Society in V ictoria is evidenced
by the following figures, showing the business done last year at
the Melbourne Office :
Proposals received — 5,212. Declined, deferred, or not com-
pleted—l,236. Policies issued, 3,947, assuring £1,109,850.

FAILING HEALTH RESTORED
CHEST COMPLAINTS.
No diseases are more frequent, few mon
dangerous, than affections of the respirator)
organs. The first symptoms of them maj
always be alleviated by I lolloway’s renowned
Pills. They quickly remedy any local con-
gestions, moderate the hurried breathing, and
enable the lungs to do their office with ease
and regularity. These Pills cleanse the blood
from all impurities, and fortify the sysien
against consumption, asthma, and similai
complaints.
Stomach, liver, Kidneys and Bowels
These organs are frequently getting out o
order, and require some suitable medicine t<
regulate them. Holloway’s Pills effect thi
object with wonderful certainty. They dc
not distress the system, or weaken the frame;
they thoroughly invigorate the digestive
organs, and stimulate the kidneys to perform
their functions efficiently, acting upon the
bowels without griping. Again, taken an
hour before dinner, they cannot be equalled
as a “Dinner Pill,” as they entirely prevent
acidity and flatulency.
DROPSICAL SWELLINGS.
Whoever is afflicted with these complaints,
should at once have recourse to Holloway’s
Pills. They act most energetically on the
exhalant and absorbent systems, purify the
blood, and impart a vigour which age or
other causes may have temporarily taken
away. They excite the kidneys to increased
activity, and promote watery discharges.
Lisoi'd rs Ptouliar to Women.
There is no medicine equal to Holloway’s
Pills for correcting the ailments incidental to
females. They may be taken with safety for
any irregularity of the system. They remove
all cause of maladies and so restore, by their
grand purifying properties, females of all ages
to robust lualth.
INDIGESTION, BILE AND SICK
HEADACHES.
No organ in the human body is so liable
to disorder and serious disease as the liver.
Holloway’s Pills regulate every erring func-
tion, give strength to every enfeebled organ,
speedily remove all causes of indigestion,
bile and sick headaches, and thus effect a
permanent cure.
Holloway’s Pills arc the best remedy known in
the world for the following diseases: —
Ague Female Irregu- Scrofula or
Asthma larities King’s Evil
Bilious Com- Fevers of all Sore Throats
plaints kinds Stoneand Gravel
Blotches on the Fits Secondary
Skm Gout Symptoms
Bowel Com- Headache Tic-L)uuloureux
plaints. Indigestion Tumours
Colics Inflammation Ulcers
Constipation of Jaundice Venereal Affec-
the Bowels j Liver Com- tions
Consumption j plaints Worms of all
Debility I Lumbago kinds
Dropsy 1 Files Weakness from
Dysentery ! Rheumatism whatever
Erysipelas Retention of cause, &c., &c.
I Urine
The Pills and Ointment are Manufactured
only at
78 New Oxford St.(late 633 Oxford St.) London;
And are sold by all Vendors of Medicines
throughout the Civilized World ; with direc-
tions for use in almost every language.
Purchasers should look to the Label
on the Boxes and Pots. If the address is not
533, Oxford Street, London, they are spurious.


NEVER USED IN VAGI.
Diseases of the Skin.
Universal approbation has been awarded
to this famous Ointment for its efficiency in
removing diseases of the skin. For scrofula,
Scurvy, scald heads, and all eruptions of the
skin, no remedy can equal it. To soldiers,
sailors, miners, and travellers in foreign lands,
it is invaluable.
Sores, Wounds, Bad Breasts,
Ulcerated Legs.
In this class of maladies, an improvement
vapidly follows the first dressing with the
Ointment.
It must not only be applied to the wound
or sore, but be briskly rubbed in around the
diseased, swollen or painful parts. The effect
of the Ointment is increased by fomenting with
warm water before the Ointment is rubbed
in ; but the surface of sores, when healing,
should never be cleansed with sponge or any-
thing else.
Rhenmatisn., fiout, Stiff Joints.
Every one suffering from these painful
affections should use this Ointment, as it has
relieved thousands from torture, after every
other means had been fruitless. The Ointment
should he well rubbed into the skin at least
twice a day, after it has been fomented with
warm salt and water and dried. The pain
gradually abates, and a cure soon follows.
GLANDTJLAE SWELLINGS, BEONCHITIS,
SOEE THEOAT, AND QUINSEY.
To combat these diseases with success,
penetrating remedies are necessary. Such
are Holloway’s Ointment and Pills. W hen
rubbed on the skin, the former penetrates to
the glands, and removes any obstruction or
impurity which maybe impeding their healthy
action. This Ointment acts on the very
mainspring of life, for through the glands pass
all reparative matters; in all the above class of
cases, the Ointment and Pills, used conjointly,
will act so searchingly, and certa nly, as to
effect cures in the most deplorable cases.
ASTHMA, SHORTNESS OF BREATH.
In these complaints the Ointment should
be well rubbed upon the chest and between
the shoulders, in order to make it penetrate
to the lungs and air passages, and thus effect
a permanent cure.
Both the Ointment and Pills should be used in
the foil cnving cases
Bad Legs Corns (Soft) Rheumatism
Bud Breasts Cancers Scalds
Burns Contracted and Sore Nipples
Bunions Stiff Joints Sore Throats
Bite of Mosche- Elephantiasis Skin Diseases

(Cjnlinued from ihc Second page of Cover.)
Murray ; and the divergence to the quiet sleepy town of Went-
worth ; all these, and much more of interest, await the notice of
the tourist. And then the ultimo thule, Mildura itself ! What
a contrast from the leagues of solitude on either hand ! Instead of
the lone station ; the occasional hut on the river bank ; here, on
a sudden, is a hive of industry! Civilization in the wilderness;
ship building on the river margin ; foundries and machinery
shops, pumping engines and saw mills, are all on the frontage.
And as the steep bank is ascended, and the town opens up before
the view, a feeling of bewilderment takes possession of the
observer. Two years ago Mildura virtually was not; now, in the
town and settlement, are gathered about 2,500 souls. “ All sorts
and conditions of men” are here. No, not all sorts, for the drones
have no vocation in an irrigation colony. But as a gathering of
conditions and nationalities Mildura presents a spectacle altogether
unique. And what a glorious work is here being developed !
With a water right undoubtedly the most liberal in the world,
with all the American expeiience of the Chaffey Brothers at their
service, the pioneers of this river side territory are rolling back
the dismal Mallec scrub, and substituting for it cheerful orchards
and trim cottages. What was “No man’s Land” of barren rabbit-
infested sand, is now a country of water channels and verdure, —
a centre on which the steps of the enterprising are converging ; a
territory which, when its 250,000 acres are allotted, as they will
be in the near future, will take the premier position as a truly
Australian Province, depending for sustenance neither upon the
old-time and present day wool industry, admirable enough, but
not population-sustaining ; nor upon the exciting but ephemeral
gold-seeking; but ever-advancing and thriving in supplying the
inexhaustible demand for all the highest priced and most univers-
ally used products of the soil. A city and horticultural region
aided by all the climatic advantages that could possibly be desired,
and rendered independent by its water supply of the scanty rain-
fall which is so serious a drawback to Australian development
throughout the continent.
Intending passengers to Mildura should first make inquiries
at the offices of Messrs Chaffey Brothers, Limited, Swanston
street, near the Town Hall, Melbourne ; or King William street,
Adelaide ; as the steamers sometimes cease running in the summer
months. Steamers leave Morgan every Friday night, arriving at
Mildura during the afternoon of the following Monday. The
return journey is commenced in the forenoon of each Tuesday,
Morgan being reached in time for the Adelaide train on Thursday
morning.
