A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE SANTOL TUBERCULOSIS
SANATORIUM SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT
IN 1918 UP TO 1926
The Santol Tuberculosis Sanatorium is an
institution for the treatment of all forms of tuber-
culosis especially of the pulmonary type, operated
and maintained by the Philippine Islands Antituber-
culosis Society.
Its present capacity is 200 beds.
Brief description of the Sanatorium site. —The
Sanatorium is built on a fairly wide plateau of about
six hectares, surrounded by an extensive valley
covered with rice paddies, a good number of mango
and tamarind trees and bamboo groves. It com-
mands from its southwestern side a pretty view of
the City of Manila, of Cavite and Mariveles Moun-
tains. From its northeastern side a magnificent
panorama of the Sierra Madre mountains and the
districts of Santolan, San Juan del Monte, Man-
daloyon, and Fort McKinley is viewed.
The site is comprised within the municipality of
Caloocan, Province of Rizal, just outside of the
northeastern boundary of the City of Manila.


A second-class provincial road southward from
its gate connects the Sanatorium with the City of
Manila. This road passes through the suburbs of
Santol and Santa Mesa Heights.
A third-class road going westward from the gate
connects also the Sanatorium with the City of Ma-
nila through the thickly populated suburb of Ma-
nila, known as Balik-balik.
Climate. —Despite the lack of enough shade trees
and the stony foundation of its soil, the climate of
the Sanatorium is, as a rule, cooler than that of
Manila the whole year throughout. A fresh and
invigorating breeze is felt almost at all hours.
During the rainy season, water is drained within
a short time and no dampness is experienced no
matter how long the season lasts.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SANATORIUM BY YEARS
1918. —The Sanatorium was officially inaugurated
on December 14 of 1918. At that time the institu-
tion consisted of 21 cottages with an accommodation
for 40 patients. Two of the cottages were of strong
materials.
Besides these cottages there were other buildings
of strong materials erected, such as the office of
the Medical Director, the storeroom, the dormitory
for female nurses, etc.


The Cottages and Pavilions are surrounded by gardens and lawns for the
patients’ amusement
The Infirmary


The institution was provided with electric light,
and water was, at that time, supplied by an exten-
sion of the city water main.
No patients, however, were as yet admitted as
final arrangements for the operation of the institu-
tion were still underway, until the closing of said
year.
1919. —The first patient of the institution was
admitted for treatment on January 2, 1919,
The personnel of the institution consisted of one
medical superintendent who, at that time, acted as
Director, chief nurse, pharmacist, pathologist, chief
cook, together with the assistance of two nurses
and five helpers. Later in the year and in view of
the rapid increase in the number of patients, the
staff of the Sanatorium was increased by one
physician and four nurses.
Old Building. —By such name is the first pavilion
for charity patients known now-a-days and, it
was built in the month of July of 1919, through
a financial aid of 1*17,000 donated to this Society
by the Municipal Board of the City of Manila. This
pavilion was completed and opened for patients in
the month of September of the same year.
The pavilion had a capacity of 40 beds. Its equip-
ment costing f*1,700 was purchased at the expense
of the Society.


Zobel Building. —A double-room cottage of mixed
materials and iron roof costing 1*1,700 was donated
by Mr. Enrique Zobel. The Zobel Cottage is one
of the most attractive and comfortable cottages of
the Sanatorium.
With these additional constructions, the bed ca-
pacity of the Sanatorium was increased to a total
of 72 beds.
Another improvement during the year was the
installation of an electric bell call system connecting
the cottages with the main office. With this sys-
tem the patients were able to be promptly attended
to by the personnel (physicians, nurses, and help-
ers) at any time.
1920. —The medical and , nursing staff remained
the same as in the previous years.
New Building. —On October Ist, 1920, a pavilion
of strong material known as the “New Building”
was completed and opened to patients. The capac-
ity of this pavilion was of 50 beds. This building
was erected with the allotment of 1*50,000 granted
as special aid by the Insular Government through
the office of the Public Welfare Board. The expense
of the equipment for this pavilion amounting to
I*lo,ooo was defrayed by the Society.
1921-1922. —Except for the wire fencing of the
Sanatorium no other permanent improvements were
made during this period. Projects for further de-

The Lobby of the Ofelia Building
A group of patients and employees of the Sanatorium


velopments were, however, in process of study and
consideration by the Society until the close of the
year of 1922.
1923. —The year 1923 is classed as the “banner
year” in the history of the Sanatorium, for it was
during this time that improvements of a more per-
manent character were introduced in the institu-
tion. In fact, the total cost of the improvements
done during the year and detailed in the following
paragraphs amounted to 1*45,750.
Main kitchen. —This building which is the first
reinforced concrete structure erected in the Sana-
torium was put in commission early in the year.
In size, it was twice that of the old kitchen. It
was equipped with all the conveniences and installa-
tions necessary in a modern sanitary kitchen. The
whole building is flyproof.
Artesian well. —Soon after the construction of the
kitchen, and at its rear part, an artesian well was
drilled to a depth of 549 feet below the surface of
the ground. This well when tested yielded a clean,
potable water at the rate of fifty gallons per minute.
The bacteriological examination made of this water
by the Bureau of Science showed it to be free from
any dangerous pollution. The Bureau of Public
Works with the cooperation of the Department of
Public Works of the City of Manila handled the
work of drilling the well.


Dormitory for female nurses. —This is situated in
one of the best sites of the Sanatorium and is one
of the prettiest buildings of the institution. It is
of strong materials and of the bungalow type.
Other improvements consisted in the installation
of a temporary wire fence around the grounds of
the institution and the installation of a local tele-
phone system.
192U. —1n the early part of this year, the artesian
well was provided with an automatic pump and
pressure tank which was imported from the United
States. The whole outfit was installed by the
Bureau of Public Works. The artesian well was
then put in operation and a good supply of
clean and abundant water was obtained for drink-
ing purpose and other household necessities of the
Sanatorium. Water hydrants both for the main-
tenance of the parks and grounds and for fire pro-
tection service were installed around the parks of
the Sanatorium.
The staff of the Sanatorium was increased this
year with the appointment of a matron for the
Female Nurses’ Home, one seamstress, and several
helpers.
Aloha Building. —This name is given to a pavilion
of strong materials with capacity for six beds. The
pavilion was so named as a token of appreciation of
the Society to the Hawaiian Sugar Planters’ Asso-


ciation and the Filipino laborers in Hawaii who
have shared in financing its construction. With
this additional pavilion the total bed capacity of the
Sanatorium was increased to a total of 78 beds.
Doctors’ quarters. —When the construction of the
Aloha Building was well under way, the erection
of a bungalow for doctors’ quarters was also started.
This new building indirectly increased the bed ca-
pacity of the Sanatorium as the cottage occupied by
the doctors was thus made available for patients.
Ofelia Building and Infirmary. —By the middle
part of the year and, in view of the fact that nearly
all the original nipa cottages were badly in need
of repair, it became necessary to construct another
large building where the charity patients could be
comfortably quartered. Plans and specifications
were prepared, the amount of 1*35,000 was ap-
propriated and, on December 15th of the same year,
the building was completed and officially inau-
gurated, and named the “Ofelia Building’’ in com-
memoration of the first Charity Princess Ofelia I.
The building consists of two pavilions connected by
a central main portion, has four wards of 12 beds
each, totaling a bed accommodation for 48 patients.
As an annex to this pavilion, was built the Infir-
mary composed of two separate wards of six beds
each.


Incinerator. —lt was also in this year that a mo-
dern and sanitary incinerator for the disposal of
garbage, rubbish, and sputum was constructed.
This was actually a long and much wanted improve-
ment of the Sanatorium. Its construction was done
under the supervision of the Sanitary Engineer of
the Philippine Health Service.
Parks and grounds. —Driveways and paths were
opened. Parking and gardening work was carried
out. Considerable leveling and filling work was
done with the result that both patients and visitors
now enjoy the beautiful, attractive, and gay ap-
pearance of the gardens, with its fountains, shrubs,
flowers, and many parks. In fact, the Sanatorium
is now the most attractive place of the neighbor-
hood. This improvement alone cost the Society the
amount of 1*3,000.
1925—Additional wing to New Building. —An
additional wing to one of the pavilions (New
Building) was constructed during this year thus in-
creasing the total bed capacity of said pavilion from
50 to 70 beds.
Food. —The general service for patients, especially
the food, has been improved as far as the current
appropriation permitted.
Gas. —The gas system including a complete range
was installed in the main kitchen and in the diet


kitchen, pharmacy and the laboratory replacing the
old coal and oil stoves.
Managing Director’s quarters. —Construction of a
bungalow for the residence of the Managing Di-
rector and his family was begun and was well under
way at the close of the year.
Ynchausti Cottage. —A large double-room cottage
of strong material was erected and completed in the
same year. This cottage was named after Excmo.
Senor Don Rafael Ynchausti, the donor of the
amount of I*l,Boo with which the building was
erected. This building is at present the largest
individual cottage in the institution. It has two
spacious bed rooms and is provided with a flush
toilet and shower bath. It has a fairly wide porch
looking towards the main ground of the Sanatorium,
thus commanding a nice view of same.
Laundry shop. —Another building which was con-
structed this year was the Laundry Shop. Its ma-
chinery consisting of one boiler, one sterilizer, a
washer, a wringer, and one ironer was installed in
September and, by December, the shop was ready for
use. The whole machinery is operated by electrical
motors. The steam is used for heating, washing,
and sterilizing.
Ice and refrigerating plant. —An ice and refriger-
ating plant of a quarter ton capacity was installed


and put in operation at the close of the year 1925.
This is also operated by electric motor.
Dishwashing machine. —A Crescent Sanitary
Dishwashing Machine operated by electric motor
was also installed and operated by the end of the
year. Dishes, silver, food trays, and pails are
washed and sterilized in this machine every day.
With the above modern up-to-date improvements,
the service of the Sanatorium was increased in ef-
ficiency not only from the standpoint of the service
rendered the patients but also from the economical
point of view.
1926. —0ne of the most important improvements
of the year was the beginning of the construction
of the much needed sewerage system. The work
is already completed inside the Sanatorium. The
work will be continued outside the area of the In-
stitution,
Local telephone central. —A new local telephone
central and the installation of new branch tele-
phones in the New Building, Main Kitchen, Old
Building, and the Director’s quarters was accom-
plished this year.
Another improvement of the year was the in-
crease in the nursing and administrative force.
The nurses in the institution now total 20. Helpers
were also increased.

A comfortable room in one of the cottages


Occupational Therapy Department. —The latest
improvement of the year was the establishment of
the Occupational Therapy Department for charity
patients only. This department is under the im-
mediate charge and supervision of one of the resi-
dent physicians who is responsible to the Director
for its management. The benefits of Occupational
Therapy in the treatment of tuberculosis is univer-
sally recognized and was introduced in the Sana-
torium as a part of the general treatment. This
department dedicates itself to the following occupa-
tions: Basketry, lamp shade, making embroidery,
cross stitching, and crochet.
The finished articles are considered property of
the Sanatorium and are offered for sale to the public
after proper disinfection has been made of same.

Night medical service. —A night duty physician
is always in attendance from 4 o’clock in the af-
ternoon to 7in the morning of the next day. His
duty is to attend to all emergency calls from the
patients.
Amusements. —This is a feature of the Sanato-
rium life which is an important one particularly to
those patients needing confinement for a good num-
ber of months. Wholesome amusements such as
billiards, chest games, checkers, and such cards
games as are permitted by law may be had by the
patients.
Cine. —Motion picture performances are usually
given through the courtesy of the Y. M. C. A. and
other charitable institutions.
Christmas festivities, band concerts, and sere-
nades. —Christmas season is celebrated with a mu-
sical and literary program staged in the open air
by patients and employees. Occasionally, a brass
band is hired to serenade in the grounds of the
Sanatorium.
Spiritual attention to patients. —Spiritual atten-
tion is rendered by ministers of both the Catholic
and the Protestant denominations whenever the pa-
tients request for them. Patients may, at any time,
call for spiritual help by simply applying to the
nurse on duty at the department they are confined
in.


Disposal of sputum. —This is one of the most im-
portant features of the Sanatorium, and is subject
to a careful and close supervision. Patients upon
admission are provided with a sputum cup which
has been thoroughly cleansed and disinfected and
contains a solution of five per cent of creolin. This
sputum cup is replaced twice in 24 hours, once at
4 o’clock in the morning and again at 1 o’clock in
the afternoon, or oftener if necessary. The sputum
is brought to the incinerator and is deposited in a
metal box containing boiling water. This water is
maintained in a boiling condition at all times using
as fuel in the furnace of the incinerator, the garbage
and rubbish that are subject to burning. The spu-
tum thus treated is dried by evaporization. Spit-
toons with creoline solution are placed in corners,
halls, galleries, and offices for the use of the patients.
“Don’t Spit” placards and notices warning against
the bad habit of spitting on the floor and on the
ground are conspicuously displayed.
Experimental work. —The Sanatorium offers un-
usual opportunities for the trial of all antituber-
culosis remedies that are known to science. At
present there are several of these remedies being
tested. Among them is Sanocrysin which is being
tested on a selected group of patients with encourag-
ing results. It is hoped that in the future, the Sa-
natorium will be better equipped and its staff so

IMPORTANT
Advice to patients residing in the provinces and
wishing to secure admission to the Free Department
of the Sanatorium. —Patients living outside of Ma-
nila, specially in distant provinces and desiring ad-
mission to the Sanatorium, should , before coming
to Manila, write to the Executive Secretary of the
Philippine Islands Antituberculosis Society, P. O.
Box 281, Manila, for the purpose of first ascertain-
ing whether or not there is a vacant bed available
for them in the Sanatorium. Failure in observing
this precaution may lead to regretful disappoint-
ments, for patients can not be admitted if an
unoccupied bed is not available. To avoid this dis-
agreeable and quite deplorable predicament for both
the patient and the office of the Secretary, patients
are advised to first ascertain from the office of the
Executive Secretary of the Society (P. O. Box 281,
Manila, P. I.) whether or not there is a vacant bed
available for them before making their trip to Ma-
nila. The office of the Secretary will be only too
glad to give the desired information promptly.
