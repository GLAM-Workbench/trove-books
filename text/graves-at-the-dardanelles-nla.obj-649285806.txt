Graves at the Dardanelles
The call went forth ; we freely gave
Our bravest and our best,
And tried to hide the pain that lay
Within each woman’s breast.
We shed no tear at parting,
We would not give them pain ;
Although we felt by land or sea
We might not meet again.
We knew our boys would never shrink
From shrapnel, shot or shell;
That they would fight like heroes —
And thus they fought, and fell.
Some lie within the trenches,
Battles raging overhead ;
They will not wake till Gabriel calls
“ Ye graves, give up your dead.”
Some, on the bosom of the earth,
By earth uncovered lie ;
Their uniform their winding-sheet,
Their canopy the sky.
Some sleep beneath the lonely pines,
Secure from human tread ;
The night winds wailing through the boughs
A dirge for the Hero dead.
Do they dream in their quiet slumber
That the battle has been won ?
That Australians helped to conquer
The Moslem and the Hun ?
That the Battle of the Dardanelles
Will live on History’s page,
And the fame of our gallant boys
Shall pass from age to age ?
Pray for our boys whose memory
Shall live for many a day ;
And for the hearts that broke
When our troopships sailed away f
