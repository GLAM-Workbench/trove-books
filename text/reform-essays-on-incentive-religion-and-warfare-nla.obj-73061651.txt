INCENTIVE THE BASIS OF REFORM.
By ?Incentive? or motive is meant that
?which determines the choice, moving
the will of man, and inciting him to
action. In order to anive at a correct
appreciation of what constitutes In-
centive, and how it operates, it appears
necessary to regard it carefully from
three points ? 1 st, from a physiological
and psychological point; 2nd, from a
political and social point; and 3rd, from
a religious and philosophical point of
view.
PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL.
As regards the first of these?the
physiological and psychological aspect ?
it is necessary to deal with the material
organisation in body and brain, the
natural and acquired tastes, and the
mental influences ; and in this depart
ment of the inquiry it may truly be said
that Incentive represents the great
motor of human action. Discover the
nature of a man?s motives, work upon
them, and you may influence his actions.
Estimate correctly the leading charac-
teristics of a nation or community, and
play upon them, and you may influence
its history. Eor nations or communities,
as such, have their peculiar traits,
representing the policy of their ruling
heads, which policy may or may not
correspond to the motives governing the
individual members of such communities,
either in relation to each other, or as a
phase of their motives in common, as
towards other communities. Whether
it be in the individual or .in the com-
munity, the greatest difficulty met with
rests in discovering the particular ruling
incentives of the hour, for they are
almost as varied as passing circumstances
and the phases of mind that have to deal
with them. An incentive originating,
for instance, under a certain combination
of circumstances which may lead to a
given course of action at one time, would
be entirely changed and lead to a differ-
ent course of action under a different
combination of circumstances. Never-
theless, it is obvious that in each indivi-
dual there are dominating incentives
corresponding to the leading features of
the organisation, or to natural or ac-
quired tastes. It is well demonstrated,
for instance, that a skilled phrenologist,
by carefully exploring a head and the
relative development of the brain ergans,
can arrive at a correct opinion of the
character of a man, and as to what are
the leading mental incentives in his
every-day actions ?just as it may be
demonstrated that a man who is habi-
tually drinking spirits or smoking to-
bacco or opium will, if deprived sud-
denly of those articles, feel the want of
them. If incentive represents, then, the
great motor of human action, and if the
quality or direction of the incentive can
be demonstrated to partake of, or be
chiefly dependent upon, the organic con-
dition, the necessity of attaining good
organic condition or development is very
strongly indicated as the true basis of
all reforms. A man may be born into
the world with the brain organs of a
murderer or a thief. Every one is bom
with more or less imperfect organisation;
and in proportion as the brain or phy-
sical condition at birth is more or less
imperfect, so does the man labor under
greater or lesser difficulty in correcting,
or, so to speak, in reconstructing him-


self, and making himself useful through- of life, supply, growth, union, affinity
out life. Ascertain the quality of the
machine, and its action will be known ;
or, know the nature of the action, and
the quality of the machine will be ascer-
tained. Make the machinery perfect,
its action will be perfect. If the action
be imperfect in any particular, the true
remedy is to correct the construction in
that particular. So, likewise, is it with
man. Ihe first step in reform is for
each one to examine carefully his own
individual actions or aspirations, and,
where these are found faulty, a desire or
aspiration for correction will attract
new incentive, which will lead to im-
proved action and a remedied organisa-
tion. The machinery of the human
system and the machinery of a national
system, like the mechanical machinery
of man, are dependent chiefly on the
quality and relative proportions of the
materials of which they are primarily
constructed ; but, they are very unlike
mechanical machinery in the fact that
they are constantly reconstructing them-
selves w ithin the term of their natural
labors, and instead of suffering from
the friction of healthful use, they are
strengthened and improved thereby.
The first condition towards obtaining
ideal human perfection is in having
suitable progenitors ; the second is in
suitable influences during the period of
gestation ; the third follows as a natural
consequence of a conformity with the
first and second conditions, in the yield
of a good natural development or organi-
sation at birth ; and the fourth condition
applying to growth, reconstruction or
correction and development during life,
consists of judicious mental and physical
exercise, as well as nourishment.
Mental nourishment, in a divine mag-
netic influx drawn by pure aspiration ;
and bodily nourishment in the judicious
use of food and air. ? Exercise ? in
this aspect represents the principle of
decay, want, aspiration or prayer, and
?nourishment 1 ' represents the principle
or development. If there was no decay
and death, there could be no life or pro-
gression. The tiny grain of wheat must
decay, and sprout, and grow, before the
increase is attained in the luxuriant ear
full of healthy, living grain. Besides
what is called ? birth ? and ? death,?*
man has in another sense many lives and
many deaths. As Shakspeare puts it :
? From day to day we live, we live?
and then, from day to day we die, we
die, and thereby hangs a tale.? There
is the ? daily death,? from exercise and
wear, and there is the ?daily life?
flowing out of that, which is made up of
nourishment; hence it can be demon-
strated that the body is completely re-
newed in less than every seven years.
The exeicise and nourishment of the
man of to-day, then, may be said to.
shape and fashion and build up the man
of to-morrow, and herein is shown the
necessity of our exertions and tastes
being directed by pure incentive. As to
the conditions indicated as essential to
the attainment of favorable organisation
at birth, it is painful to contemplate
what ignorance prevails, and what im-
mense injury must be sustained by the
human race, in consequence of this
ignorance being perpetuated under pre-
vailing false notions of modesty ; but
apait from this aspect, it is strange to
observe what ideas are entertained as to
individual responsibility. If you come
across a born genius, you will probably
find him inclined to think that his great-
ness of mind is due in some way to his
own individual exertions at improve-
ment. The great majority of us, how-
ever, are very imperfect, and can lay no
claim to genius, and this is perhaps
why we are so inclined to excuse our
imperfections by the plea that ? we are
not responsible for our own existence,
nor for the condition of organisation in
which we entered this life ; and that,
had we been born perfect, we would be
perfect. ? * No w, in passing, some may hold


that it is not very clear as to our being ably expect to reap in the next life as
irresponsible for the condition in which
we come into our mortal bodies. If
there be any truth in the incarnation
theory that mind exists in more than
one bodily form, and enters that form
or combination which it ?wants? by
a law of natural attraction or affinity?
or, as the development theory recognises
it, it progresses by a law of ? aspira-
tion ? through more and more perfect
bodily forms?then it may be hard to
say that ? we are irresponsible for the
condition in which we entered this
life,? for these theories lead to the con-
clusion that matter is expressive of the
condition of mind. It certainly seems
that incentive or aspiration is the great
governing principle in nature, and that
we are now what we have in the past
wished ourselves to be, and that we
shall become in the future that which
we now aspire to be. True it is that
by nature we have, with some rare ex-
ceptions, no recollection of a pre-
existent state, and this law very for-
cibly teaches us the advantage of bury-
ing the accumulated rubbish of the dead
past. At the same time we have left,
in present organisation, all that the
experiences of the past have taught us
to be worth retaining, to help us to cope
the more effectually with the exigencies
of the present. What we are is a
living monument of all that we have
been, indicating at a glance, or in one
word, as it were, all that has gme
before, without encumbering our atten-
tion with voluminous or embairassing
details. We are what in accounts would
be called the ? net balance brought
forward to account current.? Whether
it be acknowledged or not, that we owe
any responsibility for the condition in
which we entered upon this life, it
must be conceded that we are respon-
sible for our own present improvement
in this life?that we are largely respon-
sible for the organic condition of our
progeny, and that we may very reason-
we sow in this life, for nature?s laws
repeat themselves from lower to higher
forms. If a man gives his whole mind
to the acquisition and hoarding of
wealth, he becomes a raiser, and his
brain organ, known as ?acquisitiveness,?
grows by reason of its exercise, while
the other brain organs, through corres-
ponding neglect or disuse, become
dwarfed He makes himself a miser,
A wrong direction being given to in-
centive in him, he stamps the miser
character upon himself. It is held by
Spiritualists that the miser, at death,
will awaken in spirit life precisely the
character he enacted with so much
earnestness in this material life; but
that he will, in time, become painfully
conscious that his material accumula-
tions do noi constitute ? treasure in
heaven,? and that his great pursuit in
earth life had been a mistake ; where-
upon he will adopt a new incentive and
follow a new course of action, under
which his mind will conform in growth
and development to the direction of
its new use or exercise. If this line of
reasoning holds good so liar as the
future is related to the present, why
should it not hold good so far as the
present is related to the past? And
why may we not, in reasoning by the
logic of deduction, hold that we are
responsible for what we have been and
what we now are, while we hold that
we are responsible for what we will be ?
To confine ourselves, however, strictly
to the observed facts of the present, a
careful review of the physiological and
psychological aspect of the subject
before us, leads inevitably to the con-
clusion that the direction and quality of
development in man depends entirely
upon the direction of his present phy-
sical and mental exertuns, and that
Incentive governs those exertions.
Hence that the purity of personal in-
centive is the true and natural means
by which perfection, whether individual


or general, may be attained.
POLITICALLY AND SOCIALLY,
In this department of the inquiry
? Incentive? or ? Motive? is more
familiarly known as ? Self Interest,?
and nearly all accepted authorities on
the Science of Politics hold it as an
axiom that the interests of the indivi-
dual are the interests of the common-
wealth. Adam Smith, in bis ? Wealth
of Nations,? expresses himself thus :
? The effort of every man to better his
condition is so powerful a principle that
it alone, and without any assistance, is
capable of carrying society to wealth
and prosperity.? Bastiat, in his ? Lec-
tures on Political Economy,? says that
? A gain to each is a gain to all.? Of
course it is only reasonable to allow a
considerable margin for interpretation
where a writer makes an effort to give
expression to a wide principle within
the limits of a short sentence ; but while
authorities use only slightly different
language for expressing this ?self-
interest ? axiom in, it is most clear
they all mean by ? self-interests ? those
leading ?incentives? or ?motives?
which govern the general course of
action in each person, for it is evident
that each one acts on what he assumes
to be his own interests whether he
judges wisely or not. From the present
standpoint of writing, it would appear
that political writers have drifted into
two great errors in their treatment of
? self-interest ? or ? incentive.? First,
they assume that there is no incentive
to action other than that of a universal
desire to make money, and second, they
assume that so long as people indivi-
dually make money, the Commonwealth
must necessarily be advantaged. Yet
it is evident a man may labor under the
incentive of making money for the sup-
port of his family, and in order to do so,
he may adulterate and falsify the wares
he sells ; or a man under more honest
incentive may depend for support on the
profits of a philanthropic enterprise that
may prove unremunerative. Now, the
first of these may become rich, but may
impoverish and demoralise a country,
while the second may remain poor, but
may enrich and ennoble acommunity. Mr
David Syrae has recently published an
instructive little book entitled ? Out-
lines of an Industrial Science,? in which
political science writers are taken to
task on this point. He shows, by one
of the instances recited, that whereas
by the production of good faithful
articles in times past, England
made a reputation for her manufactures
at fair prices, which largely benefited
her ; yet, that of late, under the incen-
tive of greed, her productions have been
lowered in quality, and although at
reduced prices larger profits have been
made and a large number have become
suddenly rich, such a course will even-
tually lead to a loss of her markets, as
good articles will be manufactured for
themselves by her former customers
abroad. [Parenthetically, and by way
of illustration of this process alluded to
by Mr Syme, the good tweeds of Vic-
toria, as compared with English shoddy,
may be noted.] It may be advanced,
however, that such examples only go to
prove the general application of the
axiom contended for by writers on
political science, especially as it is put
by Mr Newman in his ?Principles of
Political Economy,? for he presents it
in the following woids :?? The laws of
the market which individual interests
generate, are precisely those which tend
best to the universal benefit.? For it
may be said that ?although in the case
cited by Mr Syme, some individuals
may have suddenly enriched themselves,
by spoiling the markets?it would have
been alike advantageous to more indivi-
duals and to England generally, had
quality and prices been kept up, and
the reputation of the English manufac-
tures been preserved. It may also be
very reasonably advanced that England
must necessarily lose some of her distant


markets, as Australia for instance will not, monopoly is ; and that monopoly
establish many manufactures of her own
as she progresses, for there are natural
and inevitable causes, altogether discon-
nected from the demoralising influences
of selling manufactures of inferior
qualities, which will bring about such
results. As a mere matter of dry
political science, the proposition that
? the wealth of individuals makes the
wealth of nations,? no doubt contains
much truth. Yet it surely will not be
contended that there is no better ? in-
centive ? to individual action, other
than that of acquiring individual wealth,
nor will it be contended that a nation
may reach pre- eminent greatness without
necessarily being constituted of money-
giubbing people. It can hardly be
supposed these political economists
desired that their so-called axiom of
? self-interest ? should be regarded in so
restricted a sense as their language would
lead us to conclude, and some people
would prefer to think they intended it
to be inferred that it is only when a
proper direction is given to ?incentive?
or ? self interest ? the Commonwealth
necessarily benefits. Nevertheless the
assurance with which the principle of
individual effort at money-making is
held up by received authorities as the
main ingredient of national greatness,
unquestionably justifies Mr Syme?s
challenge as to its correctness as a funda-
mental truth when given without quali-
fication ; and it is perhaps well that it
is so dealt with by him. John Stuart
Mill, in his ? Principles of Political
Economy,? in allusion to ? competi-
tion,? agrees with Socialist writers in
their conception of the form which
industrial operations tend to assume in
the advance of improvement; hut while
he shares their opinion that the time is
ripe for commencing the ti ansformation
from individual 10 associated labor, he
dissents from what he calls ? their
declamations against competition.? He
says that P wherever competition is
in all its forms is the taxation of the
industrious for the support of indolence.?
That ? with the exception of competi-
tion among laborers, all other competi-
tion is for the benefit of the laborers by
cheapening the articles they consume.?
He then proceeds to say that ?it is the
common error of Socialists to overlook
the natural indolence of habit, to persist
indefinitely in a course once chosen.
Let them,? remarks he, ?once attain
any state of existence which they con-
sider tolerable, and the danger to be
apprehended is that they will thence-
forth stagnate; will not exert them-
selves to improve, and by letting their
faculties rust, will lose even the energy
required to preserve them from deterior-
ation.? He remarks finally that ? com-
petition may not be the best conceivable
stimulus, but it, is at present a neces-
sary one, and that no one can foresee the
time when it will not be indispensable
to progress.? It would be foreign to
the present text to stay to consider as
to whether it would be most advan-
tageous to have a complete system of
Communism in which all would be
required to work and to share alike, and
in which therefore neither competition
nor monopoly would be possible.
Whether the present system of every
one for himself with a perfect freedom of
competition, under which the man with
the largest means (if not the fittest sur-
viving) practically secures a monopoly;
or whether the times we live in demand
a go-between system?such as appears
to meet the approval of Mr Mill?in
which co-operative associations should
be established as a step in advance of
individual effort, and towards the attain-
ment of a complete Communism. Per-
haps nO intelligent observer will deny
that under a system of individual com-
petition wonderful progress has been
attained by the introduction of scientific
appliances and machinery, and by dis-
covery. If a man now wants to make


money, he must go a step in advance of appear, however, that money-making
his neighbors?and as political econo- competition is credited with too inuch
mists hold that money-making is the
height of everybody?s ambition, that
perhaps accounts sufficiently for the
helter skelter race in which everyone
seems to be engaged in our time. What
other writers style as self interest,
and what is dealt with here as incen-
tive, Mr Mill treats as a money-making
?competition;? and it is worthy of
careful consideration whether his con-
clusion as to competition being a
? necessary stimulus, indispensable to
progress,? is a correct one. Granted
that under such a system, a necessity is
forced upon all those who do not inherit
riches, to work very hard by brains and
hands in order to compete with suffi-
cient success to make a living, and that
the energies thus exerted have a twofold
beneficial inf uence ; first on the indi-
vidual, and second on the Common-
wealth. Concede all this, and the
natural conclusion then would be that,
if competition is so good in its tendency,
it is the duty of the State to make all
men and women ?competitors? by attach-
ing all property at death, except such
as might be necessaiy for the support
and education of infant progeny ; for, by
thus doing away with the class who
inherit riches and forcing them to join
the ranks of those who inherit labor,
the State might bring about an equality
of all people in one class as ?competi-
tors.? With a fair start of this kind in
the race of life, ? competition ? would
then harmonise better in its results
with the natural law of the ? survival of
the fittest!? Mr Mill does not deny
that ? there are inconveniences in com-
petition, or that the moral objections
urged against it by Socialists, as a
source of jealousy and hostility among
those engaged in the same occupations,
are altogether groundless.? Neverthe-
less he firmly holds that ? if competition
has its evils, it prevents greater evils.?
Prom the present stand-point it would
compel ition is credited with too inuch
of the advancement which has been
attained?and it may well be asked
whether it is not probable (considering
the facilities of acquiring and dissemin-
ating knowledge which have been
afforded by the Press), a condition
of advancement quite equal, if not
superior to that attained, would have
been reached under a purer incentive,
and without that extraordinary money-
making competition which is so strongly
upheld by political economists. It is
urged by writers that if the law of
? competition ? was removed, and the
necessities of labor reduced, the natural
tendencies in man to avoid labor would
soon render him indolent. To establish
this theory, reference is made by those
writers to the habits and customs of
semi-barbarous people. Mr Brassey,
for instance, says that ? the Hindoo
workman knows no other want than
his daily portion of rice. The torrid
climate,? remarks he, ? renders water-
tight habitations and ample clothing
unnecessary. The laboier therefore
desists from work so soon as he has
provided the necessaries of the day.
Higher wages would add nothing to
his comfort; it only serves to diminish
his ordinary industry.? Air Wallace,
too, in speaking of the sago tree as
food for the inhabitants of the Malay
Archipelago, reckons that one tiee
will produce food sufficient for one
man tor a whole year, while two men
will prepare it in five days, and two
women in five days more can bake
the whole produce into cakes ready
tor use. ?The effect of this cheap-
ness,? remarks Mr Wallace, ?is very
prejudicial to the inhabitants of the
sago countries,? and ? these people are
never so well off as in parts where
rice is cultivated.? Now this is all
very natural with savages, but it is
submitted that it is hardly fair to
apply it to the hard-working English-


man. Some call this preference for it certainly has not done away with the
action ? Energy? - ?but it must be
remembered that it is culture which
produces those strong good qualities,
the mere exercise of which yields a
pleasure which in itself constitutes
that ? incentive ? to action which some
call ? energy.? There is, thus, that
distinguishing quality of mind in the
Anglo-Saxon under which, be he
necessitated to earn money for his
support or not, he will, as a rule, be
constantly employing himself in works
of general utility, for in these he
realises considerable happiness; and it
would be hard for anyone to prove
that those who have been prompted to
exertion under no higher incentive than
that of personal aggrandisement, have
been nearly so successful in the field of
invention or in any other work of
general improvement as those who have
labored under a higher incentive and
with whom mere money-making has
been altogether a subservient consider-
ation. When we consider the extreme
conditions which obtain in Great
Britain, for instance, under the present
competition system, we cannot help
saying, ?surely this is not the most
desirable system ?? There, the rich
minority monopolize neatly ail the land
and wealth, and at the same time
inherit as a consequence an exemption
from labor ?while the large majority on
the other hand inherit only poverty and
labor. The latter have not any land, and
they are obliged to labor on through
life, under the greatest disadvantages,
working much longer hours for sus-
tenance than is beneficial or should be
required of them, while they are
exposed to innumerable vices and to
oppressions, from which the savage
slate is free. As civilisation advances,
the number of man?s wants increase,
so that, with all our labor-saving
appliances, and with all the boasted
advantages claimed for the present
system of money-making competition,
monopoly of land and wealth, which
according to Mr Mill ?is the taxation
of the industrious for the support of
indolence and Mr Mill even is forced
to say that?? hitherto it is question-
able if all the mechanical inventions yet
made have lightened the day?s toil of
any human being.? Politically and
socially considered, we are led to the
conclusion that the weal of a country
is best estimated by the happiness of
the great majority, and not by the
wealth of any class. It is not the
mere competition to attain personal
wealth which can be expected to
contribute so much to the success of
either the individual or the Common-
wealth, but it is the exercise of a
purer and higher incentive of doing
good. Of making ourselves physically
and psychologically better, of culti-
vating and improving the society we
live in, the nationality to which we
belong, the world of which we are
denizens, and even the universe of
which we are so infinitesimally small
a part. If a man have a craving
incentive to make money he will grow
rich perhaps, and if a community be
urged on, under a strong incentive
to make money, it will no doubt
become wealthy. Both the man and
the community in growing rich may
develop industries and become pros-
perous, but if the incentive to make
money be not made subservient to some
higher and purer incentive, neither
individually nor as a community can
they grow truly happy and great. True
happiness and greatness can only be
attained by the exercise and develop-
ment of the best faculties of our being,
and when the desdre for personal gain
becomes the dominant or governing
incentive, instead of being a subser-
vient one, there is called into exercise
and development mostly those faculties
which are designed to assist, rather
than to lead us. Hence we too often


find that an active, industrious life, if he be a Philosopher, will act in such
devoted only to personal aggrandise-
ment, leads to the accumulation of
means that may, or may not, after-
wards be wasted by others, to the
neglect of present opportunities, ending
generally in regret and disappointment,
instead of leading to that inward
satisfaction which can alone be realised
by the accomplishment of some endur-
ing work or the attainment of a sub-
stantial public good. In short, the
direction of the incentive determines
whether the goal to be reached be one
of happiness or otherwise; and it is
only by directing individual incentive
to the attainment of a high standard of
public good, that a people may expect
to reach a high condition of general
happiness. True national greatness
depends primarily, therefore, upon the
character of the incentives by which
the every-day actions of the people are
governed, and as those incentives are
chiefly the resultants of the operation
of our reasoning powers and religious
scruples, we are led to the considera-
tion next of the third and final depart-
ment of the subject in its
RELIGIOUS AND PHILOSOPHICAL PHASES.
This brings us face to face with the
very groundwork of all sciences and
religions, for the great fundamental
Incentive, or chief aim of existence?
whether considered from a physiological,
political, social, or religious point?
obviously is the attainment of the
greatest measure of happiness, present
and future. The Materialist, if he be
a Philosopher, will only do that which
will contribute to his temporal happi-
ness. He will do right and be charit-
able and virtuous, if he thinks that
will contribute to present happiness.
If he does not think so, be will only
do right so far as he is compelled to,
by the fear of the penalties of law or
society. 'With religious scruples and a
belief in a future state, the Religionist,
a way as to contribute the greatest
good to the greatest number, if by so
doing he thinks he will achieve the
greatest amount of present or future
happiness. If all people were Philo-
sophers, and if all acted consistently
with their opinions, the inference
would be that the Religionists would
be the best members of society. There
are other elements which enter into
the religious and philosophical phases
of Incentive, however, which must be
weighed. Established religious beliefs
ingrained into infant minds (however
absurd they may be) exert a wide
influence on our manhood, whether
those beliefs be acknowledged or not
by the Materialists and Advanced
Religionists of our time?and the conse-
quence is, that religion and philosophy
are constantly at variance in matters of
every day life. Resides this, there are
other side influences which largely
control the Incentives or motives of
every-day actions such as :
Ist.?The desire to gratify vitiated tastes
and animal passions, for the attainment of
transient enjoyment.
2nd.?The desire to be well thought of by
others.
3rd.?The desire to attain positions of
greater power.
4th.?Sadden impulse, impression or
possession without the exercise of mature
individual reason.
sth. ?The pains and penalties of doing that
which may be thought right or wrong.
6th.? Habit of thought?the peculiarities of
the individual physical and mental condition?
and the influences of the society and circum-
stances by which we may be surrounded.
All persons, Religionists or Materialists,
whether they claim to be Philosophers
or not, will find that their Incentives to
action are rendered more or less incon-
sistent with their mature convictions by
the presence of these side influences;
for, they are continually iu conflict
with, and they neutralize the deduc-
tions of their sober philosophy. It is
not correct then to assume with poii-


tical writers that the sole incentive to freed from superstition, and suited to
action, in civilised life, is that of Indi-
vidual Aggrandisement; for, if a man be
a Religionist, his motives of acquiring
wealth will be governed by his religious
scruples modified more or less by the
conflicting influences just enumerated ;
while, if a man be a Materialist, his
motives of acquiring wealth will be
governed by his desire for present
enjoyment only, modified too by those
conflicting influences, peculiar to all of
us, which have just been named. It
would be incorrect also to say that the
prevailing Incentive which instigates
the action of civilised governments is
solely one for the attainment of national
wealth, for it is undoubtedly the aim of
truly representative governments to
frame such laws as will conduce to the
moral, physical, and intellectual benefit
and happiness of the masses. It would
be more correct, then, to say that, at
the present time, civilised communities
are built up, and progress, under what
may be called a mixed individual incen-
tive?in which, the self-interests of the
individual, while urging him to the
attainment of wealth, position and
power, as means supposed to lead to the
realisation of happiness, are governed
more or less by his mental and physical
peculiarities and tastes, by his religious
scruples, and by the restraints of society
and of public and private opinion.
While all aspire, therefore, to see an
improved condition of National Happi-
ness, let them remember that this grand
end can only be attained by purifying,
improving and ennobling the Individual
Incentive. The secret, hidden motive
which governs the every-day action of
each man and woman must be improved?
and it would be hard to prescribe a
more self-evident means of accomplish-
ing this, than by educating the people,
affording them facilities for the cultiva-
the requirements of the times. A religion
based on the Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of man, whose philosophy
will familiarize the mind with that
noble Incentive of attaining individual
happiness through individual exertion
to promote the general welfare. A
religion which will teach that the
attainment of physical and psychological
excellence depends on the purity of
Individual Incentive under which
will be exercised and so strengthened
all the better qualities of manhood. If
there be any branches of legitimate and
practical religious instruction more im-
portant than others, and yet more
neglected, they are those which would
enable a people from logical data to form
correct notions as to what constitutes
real happiness and greatness, and what
are the best means of attaining these.
What have the established churches
done in the field of practical religion ?
Have they exerted a becoming influence
in securing the general education of the
masses ? Have they busied themselves
in efforts to equalise the disastrous and
appalling extremes between the exces-
sive wealth and indulgences of the few
rich, and the crying wants and oppres-
sions of the numerous poor ?the idle
condition of the large tracts of land
belonging to a few rich in different
parts of the world while there are so
many of God?s poor whose life might
be made happy if they had sufficient to
cultivate for sustenance ? Have the
churches exerted themselves to secure
wider representation of the masses in
the affairs of government, the most
legitimate means after education by
which their grievances are redressed ?
Have they exercised any efforts
to secure an International Court of
Appeal, for the peaceful adjustment of
all differences between nations, whereby
tion of the land and the establishment large standing armaments may be
of useful industries, and of giving them rendered unnecessary, and under
a philosophical or Scientific Religion, which wars between nations may


become impossible ? Instead of preach-
ing peace, they have been industrious
in fomenting wars. They consecrate
the banners of men who are paid to go
forth to kill?and they look on com-
placently while the blood of legions
of poor men is being poured out like
water in those wars. Wars in which
the poor allow themselves to be used as
tools for the furtherance mostly of the
selfish ends of a few rich men (who,wise
in their generation) themselves abstain
from those fights, the cost of which is
collected chiefly from the selfsame
poorer classes from which their armies
are recruited. Apart from these grave
errors of omission and commission, have
the Christian churches preached an
easy, free, and open religion? No.
While they uphold the record that
after the crucifixion ? the veil of the
temple was rent in twain from the top
to the bottom,? these churches have
reared up a far greater obstacle to
communion between God and man than
was ever known to the Jews, in preach-
ing closed revelation. And if those
charges made by Jesus against the
Priests of his time, of ? holding to the
traditions of men ? and of ? imposing
burthens grievous to be born ? were
well grounded then, they are now
(under the light of his pure precepts)
far more applicable against those who
in our time, with such a withering
doctrine as that of closed revelation upon
their lips, profess to inculcate his teach-
ings. From a Philosophical aspect, the
implanting of higher aspirations and a
purer Incentive in individuals,
appears to be of the very first import-
ance for securing man?s temporal and
spiritual greatness and happiness. And
what can be better calculated to induce
higher aspiration than teaching spiritual
communion between God and man ?
It is indeed the A-B-C of religion?
the true basis on which to erect all
scientific theories for temporal and
spiritual advancement; for, if the
mind be exercised purely it becomes
pure ; and, as mind is the great lever by
which the World is moved, so will it be
well moved if mind be well developed
by pure exercise. The mind of man, it
must be remembered, works not alone,
for by every pulsation, as it were, it
draws ocean currents, extending
throughout all space, within its influ-
ence for shapement and configuration J
hence, matter is moved by mind and
things assume such shapes as mind
wills. Incentive, then, or the motive
which moves the will, is the most
natural basis of lieligion and of pro-
gression, for it is observed to control all
departments of nature, although it is
known by different names in its varied
relations. It is the property of attrac-
tion and repulsion, and it is known to
us more familiarly by such words as
want, affinity, love and aspiration. If
we had no incentive to nourish and pro-
tect our bodies in the feelings of hunger
or want, when food was necessary, or of
the avoidance of pain for injury, how
long would we continue to feed and care
for our bodies ? If there were no
pleasurable feelings experienced in the
performance of duty, and if no painful
experiences followed the commission of
such acts as violated conscience, how
long would we continue to battle
against evil, and strive after good ?
If we felt no ? wants,? we would have
no ? aspirations,? and we would not
get invention, nor could we attain any
improvement or advancement. It is a
necessity of nature to live with wants?
and we must therefore continue to
have wants here and hereafter?and
the Incentive which the pleasures
before us present, in contrast with
others which we have experienced
constitutes in great measure the dis-
tinction between so-called happiness and
misery, pleasure and pain, sin and
righteousness, ignorance and education j
for these after all, for the most part,
are relative terms expressive of higher


or lower phases of the same law. A
humorous French writer, in alluding
to the pursuit of happiness, says that: ?
? In order to succeed you must prefer clouds
to sunshine, rain to fair weather, grief to
joy. You must possess nothing, and yet find
yourself too rich, take all that is done as well
done, all that is said as well said, believe
nothing and yet know everything. Dream
while you are living, live in your dreams.
After all, when you feel really happy, have
patience, and time will surely destroy the
illusion.*?
This Frenchman?s ideas, you see, are at
variance with that dictum of political
science writers which holds that
? happiness is necessarily attained with
wealth,? for he says ? happiness is
found with poverty,? and after all
there is good reason to believe that
happiness resides more in what is
called the heart than in what is
called the purse. In conclusion, the
great lesson which forces itself upon the
mind after regarding the subject from
different stand-points is that, however
hard it may be to make our actions
conform consistently with conscientious
beliefs, founded upon mature reflection,
we should strive to labor under Pure
Incentive in all things at all times.
Assuredly those who steer their frail
vessels over the billows of this life,
keeping their eyes steadfastly on their
purity of motive, however prolonged
their voyage may be made by side
currents and adverse winds, they will,
in the end, reach the haven to which
they aspire, although it be when they
reach it, they may there preconceive
some still more distant, better haven
they knew not of before. And thus,
beckoned onwards, they may continue
to aspire and to progress, to greater
and still greater perfection and happi-
ness throughout time.


SCIENTIFIC RELIGION.
The religious systems of the world are
being carefully examined by the light
of reason ?and this work of examina-
tion being entered upon by persons who
have first striven hard to relieve their
own minds of pre-eonceived religious
and sectarian prejudices, is likely to be
well done, and result beneficially to
mankind. The greater intelligence of
the age, and the knowledge which has
been gained by a careful examination of
the processes of nature, have resulted in
the accumulation of an amount of evi-
dence, which justifies the belief that
natural laws and the properties with
which matter is endowed are unalterable.
This belief has led to more extended
and enobling conceptions as to the nature
of that God who, in His all-wisdom,
established those laws, which, by their
perfection, require no alteration ?and
it has led to a growing conviction that
the supernatural elements in reli-
gions, for which are claimed a blind
belief or faith, have no part with nature
or with the God of nature. The religion
of a people should represent correctly
its intellectual condition and moral
worth?and it will be for that people
who, by its culture, is demonstrated the
wisest, to purge religion of its imperfec-
tions, and present it purified to the
world for the greater spiritual and
physical development of its inhabitants.
So far as Christendom is concerned,
instead of accepting unchallenged a
supernatural religion based upon
mythical dogmas of original sin and
sacrificial laws?which it requires but
little perception to discern, originated in
the darkened minds of men living under
inferior conceptions of nature and of
God?s designs?scripture is being tested
by the revelations of God in nature,
and the result is, that from a Super-
natural we are going to a Natural Reli-
gion?and, with a still closer observance
of God?s laws in nature and a pure
desire for truth, we shall attain a
Scientific Religion. Tes, sectarianism
will be checked in its spread, and
religion will be elevated to a science
and, as there is an art in teaching, so
may the more distinguished and useful
of the priests, in time, be called artists,
for they will be engaged in the God-like
work of promoting the spiritual and
physical development of the multitude
according to the tenets of scientific in-
duction. When ignorance prevailed, so
that people were incompetent to teach
or be taught the present scope of
spiritual lessons, they got material
signs, emblems and ceremonial forms
of worship from their priests, and they
subscribed belief to what they them-
selves could not understand. The time
now is, however, when God will be re-
cognised as a spirit to be worshipped
neither in ? this mountain nor in Jeru-
salem,? neither in this particular Church
nor in that particular form?but, as a
spirit, ? in spirit and in truth,? accord-
ing to the individual wants. As shown
in John, 6th chap.: It is not the bread
and the wine, nor the body nor the
flesh and blood, but ? It is the spirit
? that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth
? nothingand, as clearly explained
by Jesus at the time, it was ? the


? words? that he spoke unto them
that were ? spirit and life.? The
material forms were, and are, only in-
tended to lead up to the spiritual mind
requirements ; and the words ascribed
to Jesus demonstrate that it is a fitting
ministration to the immortal mind,
which is of chief importance in man?s
existence; and any ministrations or
religious dogmas which the mind
realises to be impossible and untrue,
cannot be held to be fit or useful ad-
ministrations to that mind or soul. By
accepting the Old and New Testaments
as their Bible, ? Christians? acknow-
ledge that religion is, or should be, pro-
gressive, according to the spiritual condi-
tion of the people?for, while under the
Mosaic dispensation, an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth, was preached,
Jesus gave the ?new commandment?
that ye love one another and return
good for evil. These were in direct op-
position to each other, as religious
teachings, yet each represented the re-
ligion ot its time. Jesus recognised the
necessity of advanced religious teach-
ings, hence he denounced religious
forms, customs and beliefs which were
no longer useful, and which of necessity
stood in the way of spiritual develop-
ment. He not only corrected their ideas
as to prayer, by pointing out what its
true direction and character was, as
already quoted, but he denounced the
strict Church Sabbatarian ideas of
the time, by his teaching that the
Sabbath was made for man and not
man for the Sabbath ?while, on another
occasion by an undying symbol, he
illustiated most beautifully the advance
of mind, when he remarked: ??Say
? not ye : There are yet four months,
? and then cometh harvest ? Behold, I
11 say unto you; Lift up your eyes
? and look on the fields, for they are
? white already to harvest.? By which
words he indicated that those who had
connected themselves with his mission,
should be aware that men?s minds were
ripening to receive those higher religious
teachings which he felt it to be his
mission to implant. Reformer, and
God-honoring as was the great and holy
man Jesus, if his Chroniclers are strictly
correct (which, by the way, they are not
likely to be), it would appear that even
his mind was not altogether free from
the religious prejudices of his time. Any
short-comings on his part in this direc-
tion, however, there is great cause to
believe, were vastly increased by his
historians and the religion writers who
followed him. Men like Paul, who had
not the advantage of close personal
acquaintance with him while in the
flesh ?men, who, perhaps, like Paul,
were the persecutors of Jesus or his
followers, while they were teaching, but
who afrerwards became ? converted?
yet with minds more or less clogged by
the established beliefs of the day, while
they acknowledged Jesus, they in reality
taught their own doctrines in his name.
Doctrines which were little short of a
compromise of prevailing errors, or an
admixture of Jesus? purer teachings with
the Mosaic system of original sin and
sacrificial redemption, which enter so
largely into the New Testament.
Doctrines which are even now preached
as ?Christianity? with a most withering
effect upon those purer teachings of
Jesus, to be found more faithfully
recorded in the gospels. After all, pre-
cisely the same difficulties stand in the
way of religion reformers in our time
which stood in the way of Jesus, and
those who, like him, essayed to teach
advanced truths; for they have even
now an almost unsurmountable task in
first freeing their own minds from pre-
vailing superstitious beliefs, and that
false reverence forthe so-called ?word of
God? which they have imbibed with
their mother?s milk, and which, accord-
ingly, have entered into them as part
and parcel of their own being. No
doubt the book is highly inspired in
parts, and contains much good in


furnishing a valuable history of religion
and of people and the true principles of
religion which should be perpetuated.
There is no desire to lose any good
presented through it, but there is a desire
to render it a better and more useful
Bible than it is, and there should be no
great difficulty experienced in the
undertaking. According to church
history, about the middle of the second
century after Christ, the canon of the
four gospels was closed, and at that
time there was no difference of opinion
in the churches about them. These
constituted the New Testament in them-
selves, at that time, and they began to
be regarded as a collection complete in
itself, and the exclusive source of in-
formation to which the church appealed,
although even these were anonymous
writings. If with such an excellent
New Testament in use so long, a hand-
ful of fallible Church dignitaries, in
the fourth century after Christ, con-
stituted a proper tribunal or authority
to make up a New Testament, such as
we now have it, by adding a number of
M S.S. (also mostly anonymous) simply
on the exercise of the discrimination of
a majority of their number, as to
whether ?irrespective of authorship
? those writings were of such a char-
? acter as would entitle them to be
? placed in the canon alongside of the
gospels? surely it is competent, at
this time, for a like tribunal to say what
shall be called the New Testament, or
what ? the word of God,? and thus to
give us a better bible ? There is
nothing which attaches more disgrace
to the people of these times than the
fact that their religion is behind their
scientific research, behind their know-
ledge of natural law, behind the scope
of their legislative enactments, and
behind their fashionable, social and
moral restraints even ; and, while in all
concerns of life they suffer themselves
to be guided by the exercise of reason
and reflection, through indifference to
their eternal happiness by not searching
out truth for themselves, they blindly
accept the preaching of doctrines which
will stand no such test. If a change is
t� be made, and if supernatural religions
are to be superseded by a natural reli-
gion, fitted to administer to the intelli-
gence of the age and to better promote
the spiritual and physical development
of the people, but little assistance may
be expected from the ministers of reli-
gion themselves in bringing about such
a change, until the present version of
the Bible is improved. This improve-
ment might possibly be brought about
by those who are understood to be at
present engaged, in the mother country,
in revising the Bible. Or, if it be
impracticable, from the nature of their
commission, to have it done by them,
then other competent men might be
appointed to effect the required ex-
cisions before the revised work goes to
press. Or, possibly, private enterprise will
step in and supply the want. It is well
ascertained, and there can be no advan-
tage gained by suppressing the fact,
that the whole superstructure of our so
called ? Christianity? is untenable, for
the simple reason that the foundation on
which it is erected is false. At the
same time, there does not appear to be
any just reason why a purer Christianity
should be based, as our present Chris-
tianity defectively is, upon the Mosaic
account of the Creation, the Mosaic
system of original tin, and that natural
outcome of it, the sacrificial law. It
may be easily believed that God did not
make the world in six days?that he
did not rest on the seventh day?that
the first man on our planet was not so
perfect as Adam is represented to have
been before ?the fall? ?that the earth
was not so fruitful ?that the first
woman was not made from a rib of
the first man ?that the Devil, in the
shape of a speaking serpent, did not
tempt Eve?that the Lord did not walk
as a materialised man in the garden


u in the cool of the day??that the
whole human race are not sinners
doomed to everlasting torments in hell
fire because of Mr and Mrs Adam?s
supposed eating of fruit? and that the
sacrifice of bullocks or goats, or its
equivalent, ? the blood of the lamb,?
has no power whatever literally to take
away or wash out our ? sins? or short-
comings, On the other hand, it is only
rational to suppose that if we degrade
our minds with evil thoughts and
purposes, and our physical conditions by
abuses, no repentance can momentarily
constitute us pure and perfect beings.
The most that can be said of ? repent-
ance? is, that it marks, in some cases, a
time when, by disgust at the past, a
feeling of repulsion is experienced
towards wrong-doing, and a desire is
aroused for purer life, leading the
repentant into a new course, by travel-
ling in which, under higher aspirations,
he is lead to better actions, so that in
time ? bad? is outgrown in him and
replaced by better. This idea is ex-
pressed by Jeremiah, in the second
chapter, where these words will be
found : ? Thine own wickedness shall
? correct thee, and thy backslidings
? shall reprove thee.? Apart, however,
from the untenable nature of the super-
structure of the religion which is so un-
worthily presented under the name of
? Christianity,? the rewards and penal-
ties of the system are out of all
character. Thus for
PENALTIES,
Ist. We have it, that for no fault of
his, man is subjected to everlasting hell
torments. The injustice of inflicting
such a penalty on the guiltless is so
obvious that it tends to throw discredit
on the religion that propounds it, and it
turns people from the church doors.
If regarded as a penalty of everlasting
duration towards the guilty even, there
is no corrective influence shown in it,
so that even in this light it presents
only a cruel and purposeless penalty?
vindictive and meaningless.
2nd. We have it, that whether man
leads a good or bad life?whether he
moves within surroundings of ignorance,
crime and wretchedness or not?if he
does not take protection under the
sacrificial law he is doomed. Accord-
ingly, a man who has led a long life
of wickedness, if he seeks protection
under the sacrificial law at the moment
of death he is saved and made pure;
while the man who leads a good, ex-
emplary and useful life, and happens
to be cut off suddenly without time for
such special appeal is doomed ! There
is obviously exhibited in this apportion-
ment a total absence of reason and
justice, and the natural inference is,
that such a system, if believed in,
would induce most people to live bad
lives, in the hope that by escaping
sudden death they might avail them-
selves of the last moment of their lives
in an appeal for forgiveness?a grasp-
ing of a prize not honestly won! So
much for the penalties of the system.
Now, of what consist the
EEWAEDS.
In contradistinction to the penalties of
this system, the reward of the saved
represented as: An eternal singing of
psalms and waving of palms is
utterly insufficient! Yet, this is what is
triumphantly flourished as the reward
of the righteous. Surely, this falls very
far short of furnishing an adequate
incentive to well-doing, especially to
those who don?t care about the singing
of psalms or the waving of palms?
Indeed, one would almost be led to the
conviction, by the ordinary process of
thought, that if there be no other
amusement provided for the good who
don?t care for such things, they will be
very miserable by reason of having no
congenial occupation !
Many who have not given thought-
ful consideration to the super-
structure of their religious faith,


may think it cruel to have their
minds disturbed from the preconceived
and very convenient belief that, at any
time, they may lay their accumulated
burdens of wrong-doings upon the
shoulders of Jesus and thus be at once
relieved, and rendered as light and
innocent as any infant stranger to
wrongs. Let us meet this case with a
simile: There is a man sleeping in a
boat, which is, unconsciously to him,
rushing down a stream towards the
edge of a cataract which will presently
engulph him. If that man be suddenly
awakened by the friendly intervention
of an onlooker, he will, at first thought,
feel annoyed at being disturbed, but on
realizing the danger of his position, his
feelings of vexation will be turned to
those of heartfelt gratitude for the
timely warning through which his life
was saved. So with him who sleeps in
faith! Depend upon it, there is no
substantial advantage to be gained by
perpetuating the double delusion of
original sin, and of redemption and
pardon through the ? blood of the
lamb??and the sooner the multitude
are given to understand that they
may expect to ? reap as they sow,?
the sooner may they be expected to
be religion workers and not merely
professors of religion. It will not
suffice to raise the objection that this
is an attempt to deny Jesus, or the
efficacy of his teachings as a great
High Priest, for the same who said:?
?It is the spirit that quickeneth,?
also said, ? the words that I speak
unto you they are spirit and they are
lifeand these present teachings, it
is maintained, are infinitely more in
consonance with the spirit of his
words, or of true Christianity and
the laws of nature, than are those
teachings which are presented as
Christianity by the churches of the
day. If religion is to continue to
exercise a wide and good influence,
with the increasing intelligence of the
times, it will be necessary to expunge
from the Bible all unreasonable, un-
truthful and immoral passages?the
account of creation, and the fall and
its consequences, as well as the sys-
tem of redemption- -and any passages
which may be calculated to perpetuate
the mythical superstitions and errors of
past times, By careful excision, the
Bible, it is held, may be greatly
reduced in size and increased in usetul-
nes8 ?and in its new form it should
be presented on its merits, not as the
veritable ? word of God,? but as the
writings of men like ourselves, more
or less inspired. There will be plenty
left to teach of the social, moral and
religious errors of the past to enable
us to avoid them in the present and
future ; and, the wise sayings of noble
men, the spiritual counsels of good
men, and the virtuous achievements of
Godly men and women, may remain
with advantage as lamps in the path
of present and coming generations.
Above all, the pure fundamental prin-
cipals of the Old and New Testaments
and of all religions?the fatherhood
of God and the brotherhood of man,
and of spiritual communion ?will be
left to us in their grand sublimity,
even as they are revealed in the book
of nature. By the bounteous love
of God, the wants of all his creatures
are carefully provided for. Throughout
all time He has been the hearer and
answerer of prayer ?and as, in the past,
the spiritual necessities of the people
were answered by inspiration, even so
now may their growing spiritual wants
be supplied in like manner, and under
the operation of the same unalterable
natural laws. It is no part of the duty
of any one to lay down the details of
dogmatic religious beliefs to be blindly
received by others, and, as it were, to
say to the waves of advancing thought:
? Thus far shalt thou go and no
further.? Nevertheless, it is sincerely
held to be an obvious duty to point out


and expose those defects in the founda-
tions upon which prevailing religious
dogmas are erected, for which are
claimed a blind belief from others,
especially when those defects are
demonstrated to be fatal to the stability
of the religion built upon them and
deterrent to the advancement of man-
kind. It is a duty to expose such
defects, and it is equally a duty at
same time to indicate the true funda-
mental principles upon which religions
have been and may continue to be based,
with a view to greater advancement.
When Jesus was asked as to what he
considered the fundamental principles
of religion?or, in other words, ? which
is the great commandment in the law?'?
His answer very properly was: Thou
shalt love the Lord with all thy mind.
That, said he, is the first and great
commandment?and the second like to it
is: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as
thyself ?On these twocommandments,?
said he, ? hang all the law and the
prophets.? Here, then, are the true
piinciples of religion in a nutshell :
Love the Lord and do unto others
as you would wish them to do to
you. If in addition to observing
these injunctions, we act wisely on the
experiences of the past?and, when
difficulties beset us, appeal to the Father
as a trusting child would to a loving
parent for advice (remembering that
there is an ever open channel of inspir-
ation by which we may ? be taught of
God? and be enabled to meet the emer-
gencies of any hour) we may realize a
living religion which shall bring us confi-
dence and hope.
With a love of God and of
his fellow-man at heart, aud a sincere
desire to learn the truth, and with a
channel of Divine Communion open,
through which he may appeal to the
fountain of all truth, each one cannot
fail to obtain a religion that will supply
all that he may be able to utilize. The
religion of the day, to be natural and
useful, must be based upon the revela-
tions of the day, for they ever accord
with the aspirations or warns of the
people of the time?but, revelation
must be used to be useful. By teaching
a closed revelation, the Church has
placed itself between the spiritual wants
aud supplies of the people. It has
stood between man and God?and has
proved itself by so doing a cumbrous
barrier to mau?s progression. But the
way is opened to progress, when it is
demonstrated that the laws of revelation
are not only now available, as ever, for
use, but that the nature of those laws
are becoming well ascertained, aud their
mode of operation well demonstrated,
so that, ere long, man will have a
scientific religion, based upon those
laws. No one can prove that there
never has been revelation, and no one
can prove that revelation is closed?
while, from personal experience, there
are a great number, at the present time,
who have received conclusive proof of
open revelation. If people, instead of
trusting to tradition, would repose
more confidence on the efficacy of in-
dividual appeal to the Bather?as did
Jesus and the Prophets of old?that
figurative Babel of religious dissentions
which disfigures our Planet might soon
be removed, truth seekers might get
inspirations suited to their require-
ments, religion be purified, and all
people elevated accordingly. As no
doubt some will be iuclined here to in-
terpose the inquiry : ? What is the sub-
stance of the belief??? it will only be
fair, perhaps?without wishing to lay
down rules for their guidance?to
answer this inquiry. Ihe beliefs then
may concisely be given as follows:
It is believed : That God is all-wise,
and everywhere present but invisible,
except as expressed through the lav* s of
nature and the unalterable properties of
matter ? That man is a creature of God,
having a material body in the flesh, and
an invisible mind (or soul) ?Ihat


man?s body is given him as a vehicle or
instrument through which to develnpe
or educate his invisible mind, at the
same time that he cultivates the material
world in which he resides ? That so
long as his material tastes are not
vitiated they are essential to the general
scheme of development as well as to
the care and protection of the body?
also, that when conscience is untram-
melled by superstitious and false teach-
ings, it constitutes a true monitor where-
with to discern right from wrong, and
should enable him so to live as to keep
under subjection his material tastes,
rendering them subservient to reason
and the higher and more enoblii g
impulses or aspirations of his being?
That man?s nature is such that while
connected by the material body with
the material things of the world his
sympathies are attracted to it; yet,
that though his spiritual nature, his in-
visible mind (or soul) should, by reason
of high and pure aspiration for what is
good and unselfish be attractive of
Divine inspiration, so that he may be
guided by the still small voice within
and, from a wider observation of causes
and effects than can be gained by the
mere exercise of the material senses or
reasoning on deductions based upon only
a partial knowledge of existing causes
?That being finite, however, man?s
powers of receiving revelations are
limited, so that he cannot compass the
infinite, but simply receive ? supplies ?
corresponding with his ?wants??
That as the healthful exercise of the
body renders it strong, and phrenology
demonstrates that certain faculties of
the brain may be developed by usage and
dwarfed by neglect, man?s obvious duty
is to study the pure and healthful de-
velopment of his body and brain, as
these are the material instruments
through which his invisible mind may
work out a more or less useful existence
while in the flesh?That man?s direc-
tion of development depends on his
desires?That ?want? is a phase of
?attraction,? and ?dislike? of ?re-
pulsion,? so that the laws of attraction
and repulsion govern not only the
movements of heavenly bodies, but even
the most subtle and invisible of spiritual
things, and the highest aspirations of our
being; and that earnest desire is there-
fore simply another name for prayer, and
the character of man?s affinities or at-
tractions correspond to the direction of
his wants? That ? Heaven ? represents
that state of ecstatic happiness which
can alone be realized by a pure mind,
conscious of having been useful; while
? Hell? represents the burning remorse
of a mind conscious of having done
wrong, and of having neglected golden
opportunities of doing good? That in
the future state after death of the body,
we awaken in spirit life with all the
blemishes and the prejudices of our
earth life fresh on our minds (being more
conscious than ever of all matters in our
past career); and than the pain orph asure
of our minds is g reatly intensified ? 1 hat
the condition of mind after death accords
exactly with how it was used in life,
and that the mind then is to each the
unerring ?doomsday book? presenting
a summary of all thoughts and actions
during life? That we are in life sur-
rounded by a cloud of invisible wit-
nesses, who, in each thought and action
of our life, can observe the immediate
effects upon our eternal minds, and that
if good they are anxious to help us?
That the position of the mind in its
spiritual body after death of the material
body, depends on its condition, as by its
attractions it will necessarily gravitate
to that particular sphere which will be
most in affinity with its condition;
and that whether in or out of the
body, the road to greater happiness is
alw r ays open and may be reached by the
doing of greater good. Some persons
may be disposed to say :?? What is
the good of religion, and wherefore
trouble about our beliefs as t� the


future, seeing that where a Future
State is admitted, it is conceded that
the condition then depends upon the
present life ? As the present is all
that has to be dealt with, ? a good moral
system? ?say these people ?? will meet
all requirements, and religion may be
dispensed with altogether !? It is be-
lieved, however, that pure religion
should go further than morality?for,
while the latter treats simply ot matters
affecting outward appearances, and the
social relations between people, the
former aims at enohling and purifying
the secret motives and concerns of the
individual inner life, which is believed
to be the only safe foundation upon
which to base a perfect social system,
and to secure general advancement and
happiness. The difference between
morality and pure religion is as wide
as the difference between a strictly cere-
monial and a spiritual religion. r l he
professed aim of course of all worldly
governments and of moral systems is to
promote happiness. So long as indi-
viduals continue to labor under the pre-
vailing error that happiness can only be
attained by the acquisition of personal
riches, power or distinction, morality
may flourish comparatively, and there
may be a great appearance of happiness,
while, in reality, the rich may be
growing richer and the poor poorer, and
this tendency to extreme conditions
may be prejudicial to general happiness.
On the other hand, under a pure reli-
gion, there will be inculcated in indi-
viduals the conviction that true and
lasting happiness can only be attained
by obedience to the Divine Will, which
demands the cultivation of personal
excellency from purity of motive with
action and effort towards the general
good, and the advancement of mankind
as a family in common, and not as a
nation of princes and beggars. The
piovince of true religion, then, is to
raise the aspirations of the people ?to
get them to see that the pursuit of
worldly gain (except in so far as to
minister to the necessities of themselves
or others) is a delusion which does not
tend to the realisation of true happi-
ness? and to elevate their desires for
personal and general purity and useful-
ness, as the only true means by which
real happiness may be attained. It is
not enough to assert that prevailing re-
ligions are defective. Their defects
should be openly shown?and in pre-
senting a natural religion, it. may not
only be shown that such a religion is
well calculated to meet the require-
ments of the times and thus be bene-
ficial, but it may also be shown that it
is a Scientific Eeligion, inasmuch as it
will be based upon a knowledge of
natural laws, the operation of which
can be demonstrated. This is precisely
the position taken?and while it is held
that, to meet present requirements, the
principles of a pure religion are expressed
in the words: ? Love the Lord, and do
unto ojthers as you would wish them to
do to you,? man naturally wants some
evidence of that future state of which
all religions teach. He wants some
present proof that communion is prac-
ticable between mind in the material
and mind in the spiritual condition?
and, he wants something to show that,
by such communion, it is ascertained
there will be a condition of happiness
or misery after death, according to the
manner in which his earth-life is spent.
There is much evidence on these points
?but, it is passing strange that pro-
fessing Christians, whose whole faith
rests upon biblical spiritual revelation,
are most unaccountably the greatest
sceptics of these Divine truths. They
believe in the revelations of the past,
but they cannot understand why revela-
tions suited to our own times and our
present requirements should be obtained
at the present. Their belief rests chiefly
on a blind faith, in what has been
forced upon their minds in early life, of
the written testimony of obscure men,


in obscure times, and under obscure
conditions?while there is any quantity
of good modern literature and well-
authenticated testimony belonging to
our own time establishing the actuality
of spiritual communion and a state of
existence after death, which they will
turn a deaf ear to and even sneer at
?without first examining. Testimony of
a character, which, if bearing on any
other subject, would be everywhere re-
ceived as overwhelming and conclusive
evidence and proof. Let the better
class of spiritualistic literature of the
day be examined into in an impartial
?way, and sceptics will be astonished to
find the clear and convincing nature of
present testimony, and how much of
Divine Revelation we have in our time.
The most conclusive evidences, however,
are not based upon the written testi-
mony ot other men. They reach far
away and beyond that?for, the laws by
which inspiration is obtained are now
pretty clearly understood, so that the
advanced searcher for truth, disdaining
to proselytise, says to the inquirer:?
? If you would believe, comply with
such and such conditions of natural law
and obtain for yourself the revelations
which you seek. Ask not of me, for
that will not be evidence to you.?
This is what occurs every day?and it
looks very much like a verification of
the words in Jeremiah, 31st chap.:?
? I will put my law in their hearts ;
and I will be their God, and they shall
be my people; and they shall teach no
more every man his brother, saying:
Know the Lord; for they shall all
know me.? For our own part, we have
received evidences which appear to be
incontestible. Evidences, not based on
the testimony of others, but based on
natural phenomena realised through our
own organization. Full particulars of
these, and much other information re-
lating to this subject, which would be
too lengthy to furnish in this place, may
be found in the book entitled ? 1 Advance
Thought,? published by Trubner and
Co., of London, and which may be had of
Mr. Geo. Robertson, Melbourne, or
through any bookseller. Some people
who have not carefully examined into
spiritual phenomena, hold it to be im-
possible for any one to obtain informa-
tion further than the individual material
senses can take cognizance of in the
ordinary manner, or by the process of
reasoning?but, it can be demonstrated
that this is not the case. A very trifling
incident may be here cited to illustrate
one phase of this strange power. In
the course of penning these lines, and
while considering how best to illustrate
the meaning of inspiration, we were im-
pressed to stop for a moment in order
that we might get assistance on this point.
Accordingly we did so when, by
mental dictation we were told that in a
certain chapter of a certain book of the
Old Testament a certain passage would
be found, A closed bible was at our
side, and on referring to the part indi-
cated the passage recited was there
found. Row, we had no knowledge in
ourselves of where those words were,
and therefore could not have told, by
recollection or through our ordinary
senses, what part those words were to
be found in, especially with a closed
bible. This trifling incident is only
mentioned to illustrate that in spiritual
impression a power of revelation is
afforded beyond that which the ordinary
material senses or reasoning can unfold
?and if others will devote attention to
these matters no doubt they may obtain
results equally convincing to themselves.
That persons may be influenced by the
minds of others in the body by means
of invisible magnetic currents, is demon-
strated in electro-biology?for, by the
making of certain magnetic passes a
current may be established between
??positive? and ?negative? persons in
the body, by which the positive mind
may control the brain and other
material organization of the negative


subject, just as under more or loss un-
derstood conditions people arc controlled
by unseen intelligences. Hence, much
of the inspiration, revelation, prophecy,
and other spiritual phenomena recorded
in scripture, which, under an ignorant
belief, are attributed to ?supernatural?
power, may now be reconciled with
natural laws, the knowledge of the
existence of which will yet elevate re-
ligion to a science. Instead of religion
being eclipsed by scientific investigation,
the searching inquiries of spiritualists
will?we believe?by reason of estab-
lishing a knowledge of revelation upon
ascertained natural laws, purify religion,
and raise it to its proper position as tho
mother of sciences. Religion should be
in advance of scientific demonstrations,
otherwise where are its revelations?
where its prophecies?its cures?and,
where those high and good teachings
which, through spiritual insight, should
transcend the ordinary powers of human
legislation and government, and be in
advance of ordinary human teachings ?
There is no desire here to favor continual
intercourse with spirits upon trivial
matters which we have no right to
Concern them with?but, there can be
no harm in cherishing kindly feelings
towards trusty departed friends, espe-
cially as by such feelings we attract
those to us who are ever ready to help
us in emergency. Man?s highest aspi-
rations, notwithstanding this, should
ever be directed to the ? one,? only,
living, and true God, our Father, who
ever cares for and provides amply for
the meanest of his creatures. God has
permitted spiritual communion in times
past, as he does in times present under
his immutable laws in nature ?and
there can be no doubt that the more
thoughtful and advanced spiritualists,
by their patient examination of those
laws, have done great service in purify-
ing religion, and purging it of error and
Superstition, They have most effec-
tually demonstrated that inspiration is
now received?and by so doing they
have, in effect, told the Churches (who
claim to be the interpreters of a past
revelation and the preachers of a closed
revelation) what a certain philosopher
told a king: If they will do good
service they must not stand between the
light and man. By their proofs of
spiritual intercourse these spiritualists
have arrested, we believe, large
crowds of intelligent people called
materialists who had been driven from
the churches through their logical con-
clusions that: ?If there is no inspira-
tion in the present, as taught by the
churches, there was not any in the past
?that there could be no such thing as
a spiritual state ?and that existence
after death was a mere superstitious
belief.? Such minds can only be got at
by reason and proof, and these tho
spiritualists supply them with. Tho
true spiritualist who seeks to conform,
in all things, to the will of God, and
who experiences spiritual communion
at times with uuseen intelligence
almost as clearly as oral communion
with his brethren in the flesh, as many
now do, enjoys a happiness of mind
which no fear of death nor hell can
dispel. His mind is. undisturbed by
any misgivings as to the future, for tho
future, by foretaste, is realised by him
to a certain extent even in the present.
And, we cannot here resist giving ex-
pression to the opinion that, had
preachers of the established religions
and scientists been moved in a spirit
of humility under the same influences
as spiritualists, to discover the nature
of spiritual laws, the work of regenera-
tion might have been facilitated. Tho
two former, however, as a class (with-
out offence be it said) are too wise to
learn! They are, par excellence, the
teachers of mankind by virtue of their
acquaintance with printed literature.
Jesus once said: ?It is hard for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.?
It may now be said: It is hard for men


of letters to so frame their minds as to
receive revelation without a ruinous in-
termixture with preconceived deduc-
tions from book lore. Jesus is also
represented to have said: ?I thank
thee, 0 ! Father, Lord of heaven and
earth, because thou hast hid these
things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes.? It
will be for the ? babes? of this world,
so to speak, or forthosewhose minds'have
not been warped by erroneous teachings,
to accept all that is found on reflection
to be wise and elevating in past revela-
tion and in science, and by fervent
desire for the general good and for
truth, to draw from God, by inspiration,
such a knowledge of bis spiritual laws
as to elevate the religions of our time to
a religion of science, and the mother of
sciences, and thus help to purge the
world of prevailing error and super-
stition.
Melbourne, Feb. 15th, 1877.


WARFARE.
PRINCIPLES INVOLVED,
Most persons are disposed to regard
warfare as a necessary evil. Should
such a view stand the test of reason, it
would only remain to find out
how far this evil may be overcome,
in order to reduce its disastrous
effects on humanity to a n : ini-
mum. Fortunately, there are powerful
reasons which may be advanced to
show that war is not necessary amongst
civilized nations. It should be regarded,
indeed, like other evils?such as disease
and poverty?as the outcome of mis-
government, of ignorance and of indol-
ence ; and, to be done away with, it
only requires the exercise of such intel-
ligence, moral restraint, and reasonable
effort as civilized nations are quite
competent to devote to it at the present
time. Instead of suffering and bemoan-
ing over its effects, it simply requires
an intelligent determination to conquer
and do away with the causes. Great
pestilences and disasters, which, but a
few years since, were regarded as special
visitations or judgments, are now pre-
sented by the observance of common-
place sanatory laws and other simple
precautions, which scientific research
has demonstrated to be required for their
avoidance. The lightning, which, erst-
while, would rend buildings and destroy
their inmates, is now, by the simple
provision of an iron rod, guided harm-
lessly to the ground; and this fluid,
which, superstitiously, the Gods alone,
in vengeance, were supposed to wield,
is now everywhere produced artificially,
and is every day used to serve man?s
behests and to convey his thoughts in
peace and silence to the uttermost
parts of the world. That system of
deadly physical conflict called warfare
may very properly be regarded as
belonging to primitive times, or to the
lowest condition of intellect in man.
The infantile days of the human family
that period when the reasoning
faculties in man being undeveloped, he
was unable by reason and culture to
wrest from nature that which he felt he
wanted, so that he was obliged to
resort to physical force. Surely this
period has been outlived long since by
the more civilized nations of the world,
and, if so, why is war continued?
Cannot the nations of Europe for in-
stance, one and all, follow the ordinary
occupations of industry, and live peace-
fully alongside of each other, like the
inhabitants of any ordinary town ?
Can they not respect each other?s rights
and property without maintaining large
armaments, or, as it were, each carrying
his revolver and bowie knife ready to
spring at the throat of a supposed
adversary on the slightest signs of
provocation ? In all well-regulated
communities, it is not considered right
for civilians to carry firearms, or to
take the law in their own hands.
There are laws, and disinterested judges
in properly organised courts, to admin-
ister them, and those having grievances
are expected to appeal to and use
these, in order that discord and
tumult may be guarded against
while private wrongs are redressed
dispassionately and fairly. Wars


between nations frequently arise from i
much the same causes as animosi-
ties and contentions do between indi- '
viduals. That is, they arise from the
want of properly understanding the
motives by which each is actuated, and
from not properly construing each
other?s actions. In short, it is not from
that dishonesty or unworthiness of
motive which each is too apt to attri-
bute to the other, but from a sheer mis-
understanding of each other, arising
from a want of a sufficiently clear and
open expression to each of their inten-
tions, and from the absence of that
repose of confidence in the honour of the
other, which each expects to recive
for itself. Once distrust your neighbour
you arm to protect yourself. Once
armed to protect yourself, the chances
are that on the slightest appearance of
aggression you bring into action your
available means of defence, and with
the ? first shot? open war is begun and
all chances of peace are at an end,
until all physical energy on the one side
or other is exhausted. There is too
much selfishness and distrust amongst
civilized nations towards each other ?
and this leads them to vie with each
Other in keeping up such immense stand-
ing armies, which are not only bad in
themselves by ruinously over-taxing the
industrial resources of countries and de-
moralizing the inhabitants, but bad in
leading (by their simple presence) to
warfare, which otherwise might be pre-
vented. It is morally certain that war
between civilized nations may readily
be done away with by a simple exten-
sion of Government beyond present
limits. All Iqws and Governments have
the same basis, although their applica-
tion may be extended to meet wider
requirements. The Father gives the
law, and administers it among his own
children. He prevents them from
carrying or using weapons, and insists
upon being himself appealed to as the
bead of the family for the settlement of
any differences between tbe members.
Nations adopting the family system,
have their courts of appeal, and insist
that all differences between their sub-
jects be adjudicated upon by those
Courts. If this were not so in families
and in nations, there would necessarily
arise serious discords, with perpetual
appeal to physical force ?just, as at the
present time, wars are waged between
nations simply because they have not
any recognised Court of Appeal to deal
with differences between them in a
reasonable and legitimate manner.
Ak International Court.
To bring about a cessation of warfare
between neighboring civilized nations it
is only necessary that a conference of
representatives of these nations should
be held, at which the organisation of an
International Court may be agreed upon,
at which the honour and interests of
each nation may be equitably repre-
sented. Each nation would bo required,
in the first place, by this International
Court, to disband its standing army, re-
taining only such force (by way of
police) as might be deemed necessary to
uphold the power and authority ot its
own Courts of Justice and preserve in-
ternal order, while it would be required
to submit any difference between itself
and any other nation to this Inter-
national Court for settlement. Instead
of each nation having to enforce its own
rights with its own army, there would
then be q strong standing army under the
control of the International Court which
would protect it fr >m any injustice*
Each nation joining in this union for
mutual offence and defence would be
required to contribute to the support of
the international army according to its
population, or according to its import-
ance, viewed from some other stand-
point to be fixed upon, and a part of the
contingency furnished by each nation
might be quartered with some other
nation of the Union, and be subjected
to shifting periodically, in order to bring


about a fraternal feeling amongst
different nationalities and prevent the
possibility of any nation in the Union
attempting to assert itself independently
of the Union, as it might be led to do,
if it had a large contingency of its own
at home. Any colony, or dependency
of any nation in the Union that would
contribute its quota to the International
armament, should receive the same pro-
tection as its parent nation. It might
be competent for the International
Court to consider and deal with any
country that might be shown by a large
majority of its people, obtained by
plebiscitum, to suffer from want of
proper government; also to determine
whether such people should be annexed
to some other people with whom its
sympathies or interests would seem
more closely to conform. Instead of
France and Germany impoverishing
themselves by increasing their arma-
ments to a ruinous extent for another
struggle for territory so soon as the least
pretext is offered for war, why may not
the question of boundaries be settled in
an honorable and rational way, by such
an International Court as is here sug-
gested, in peaceful times ? If Hungary,
Denmark, Greece, Italy or Turkey have
their grievances to be settled, why not
settle them too by a legitimatelv organ-
ised court in peaceful times?a court
whoso decisions, supported by such an
overwhelming moral and physical force,
would be respected and would be final ?
In all its proceedings, this court should
be actuated solely by a desire for the
general good and the advancement of
mankind, and not simply to further the
interests of any particular part nor yet
the whole of the Union, as against
nations not included within it. Suppose
England, France, Prussia, Austria,
Italy, and any other nation, whose terri-
tory is adjacent, and who may stand on
much the same level of civilization,
were to unite and organise an Interna-
tional Court with a powerful armament
between them, instead of, as at present
(separated and distrustful of each other,
with each its own armament), would it
not be infinitely better for all of them ?
The very establishment of such an
Union would (by its example, if not by
its power) insure justice and peace to
the whole world, and its cost need not
be a tithe of that which, under the
present system, only perpetuates strife
and warfare between nations. There
should not be any difficulty in bringing
about such an Union. True, there may
be, at any time, some two or more of
these nations engaged in warfare, or
involved in serious diplomatic corres-
pondence as to the adjustment of their
relations, and, of course, at such a time,
it might be difficult to gain their co-
operation in organizing the Union; but,
at any other time, and under ordinary
circumstances, it is difficult to believe
that any one of the nations alluded to
would hesitate to give its cordial assist-
ance in wortk. It may be advanced
that there is no necessity for anticipating
warfare until differences arise, and
that these may be settled by courts of
arbitration or conferences (as in the
difficulty with the U. S. of America, or
the adjustment of the Russian demands
on Turkey), or by diplomatic correspon-
dence. Such courts and conferences, it
is held, do not meet the difficulties
fully. They do not remove the neces-
sity of ruinous outlay in preparations
for warfare, such as was. undertaken by
England during the progress of the
Russo-Turkey war. They do not
prevent wars in all cases, and besides
the ruinous cost and the evil effects of
maintaining so many standing armies
in peaceful times, distrust and ill-feeling
between nationalties would still continue
'to be engendered, in the absence of an
established International tribunal. To
wait until differences arise after such a
fashion, indeed, is to wait for the most
unpropitious season for their settlement,
by reason of the irritation felt, the


points of honor raised, and the interests s
at stake on both sides. Natural impro- I
vidence, however, leads people to put 1
off reforms until they are almost thrust r
(by the necessities of the hour) upon t
them, so that the chief difficulty, at this <
stage, consists in overcoming that in- <
difference to reform which is engendered 1
during peace, in order to secure that i
spirit of action (in <
ministrations styling themselves ?Con- 1
servative?) which induces the husband- i
man to sow in season if he would wish
to reap in season. There are other ?
difficulties, also, which will require to
be surmounted ?such, for instance, as
the personal interests that are at stake
in each nation in the money that is made
in the supply of the army and navy,
and in the incomes derived by the hold-
ing of commissions?both of which
interests can always wield a large
amount of political influence. In view
of the cost of a large International Army,
and the evils arising out of the indolence
of habit of a soldier?s life, a part of the
time of each man that is not required
for drill, might be devoted to profitable
occupations. For instance, soldiers
might be occupied in making their own
uniforms, cultivating and preparing their
own food, and making themselves other-
wise useful, so as to contribute to the
cost of their own maintenance. The
drones of society?the beggars, idlers
and drunkards?should be drafted into
the International army, and made sub-
ject to healthful military discipline;
and, for active service (if war did occur)
it might be seriously considered whether
criminals could not be largely employed
in the van of advancing armies, or
offered good bounty for ?forlorn hopes!?
There will naturally be some differ-
ence of opinion as to the best modes
of organising the International Court
should be exercised by it, and as to
how best to organise and maintain an
International army; but, there can be
no difference of opinion, either as to
the expediency of such an undertaking,
or as to the practicability of carrying it
out to a successful issue. There are
the principles of Government, the
methods of giving effect to those prin-
ciples, and the advantages to be gained
thereby, already all well understood,
and it simply requires a general desire
to avoid warfare on the one hand, and,
on the other hand, amongst the people
of Europe, a united demand for an
International Court, and there need be
no more war, and no more wholesale
waste of national resources, such as has
been going on there.
EXTENT AND COST OE EUROPEAN
ARMAMENTS.
It is disgraceful to Europe to think
that a Continent like it (from which the
benign influences of a high civilization
have radiated to all parts of the world),
with a total population of about 321
millions, should now expend over 145
millions sterling annually on armaments,
keeping millions of men in arms
whilst on a peace footing, and having
1,600 war vessels, with reserves of more
or less trained men to enable its
nations to bring about 11 millions of
men into action on short notice. Strong,
however, as this indictment is against
European nations collectively, a much
stronger charge can be brought against
England, inasmuch, as with a popula-
tion of about millions, she is ex-
pending yearly nearly 27 millions
sterling upon her army and navy (with-
out reference to India or to special
votes, such as the 5 millions obtained
during the Eusso-Turkey war for emer-
gency purposes). There is not any
nation in the world which expends, in
(whether it should be constituted of ratio to population, anything like the
representatives from the Governments same amount on armament; yet there
of the day, or of permanently appointed is not any country, probably, which,
judges), as to what precise functions by nature, is so well situated for defence,


her territory being separated from other
countries by the sea. Russia is the
only nation that expends more. Her
war estimate for 1876 (a year of
peace) was 29 millions. Her estimated
revenue from all sources was 81J
millions, so that over one-third was
swallowed up for war purposes. She
has an immense territory, but her
people, for the greater part, are in a
most primitive state of civilization. In
proportion to population, however,
Russia does not expend anything like
half the sum that England does. Ger-
many, with over 42| millions in popu-
lation, expends 211 millions sterling.
France, with nearly 37 millions, now
expends about 19| millions sterling, or
more than double what she expended
45 years ago. Austria, with upwards
of 38� millions, expends 11 millions
sterling ; while Italy, with 27 millions,
expends 10� millions sterling. England
has been unassailed for nearly 300 years;
and, as her chief objects in keeping up
such large and expensive armaments
obviously are to protect her mercantile
shipping and to preserve the ? balance
of power? amongst other nations, it is
manifestly a most sacred duty her
Government owes to the world, and
especially to her own people (who
have to ?pay the piper?), to interest
itself in organizing an International
Court for the adjustment of all differ-
ences that may arise between nations, in
a peaceful and rational manner.
MONOPOLY IN LAND ?ENGLAND AND
AUSTEALIA.
Indeed, England is rapidly approach-
ing a period in her history when she
will require the guidance of statesmen
who can appreciate the necessity
that exists for wholesale reforms, and
the inauguration of large economy in
directions in which it has hitherto
been much neglected. First, her
statesmen are bound to take an active
prominent part in the inauguration of
nations as is here indicated and,
second, they are bound to take steps
for the apportionment of her territory
amongst a larger number of her
subjects. Touch the manufactures of
England, and what becomes of her
boasted greatness ? Could she follow
the example of France and, without
her manufactures and mines, Phcenix-
like, arise to new and more vigorous
life out of the ashes of such a dissolu-
tion as fair France was visited by
in the Franco - Prussian war ?
Yet, it is inevitable that the
manufacturers of England must lose
their customers abroad, so soon as
those customers find themselves in a
position to profitably manufacture for
themselves the raw productions pertain-
ing to their own climes. The over-
production and reduction of wages
questions, which have recently caused
so much uneasiness amongst manufac-
turers and misery amongst operatives
in England, are unmistakable evidences
of the beginning of greater troubles
that must soon be legislated for, The
law of primogeniture must be repealed.
Anyone who will study English statis-
tics will recognise this. For instance,
out of a total population, in 1876, of
33,450,000 souls, it appears, from offi-
cial returns, that 321,386 persons
owned over 71,267,474 acres out of
77,513,600 acres, the total area of
Great Britan, Ireland and Wales. And,
as this number includes all owners of
over one acre in extent, the fact becomes
apparent that, small as is this number of
land-owners, the great majority of them
are small holders, whilst nearly the
whole domain is under the ownership of
a very few men indeed. In fact, by
authenticated returns furnished in the
English Doomsday Book, it appears that
710 individuals own more than a fourth
of the soil of England and Wales?and,
as for Scotland, considerably more than
one fourth of the whole land is in the
such a peace system amongst European possession of 21 persons. These large


English landowners possess immediately,
or in reversion, one seventh of the
entire rental of the kingdom, and the
territorial and political influence which
they wield is enormous, and this
gigantic monopoly of wealth, land and
political power, can only be broken down
by the most united and determined
demand on the part of the people
generally who are injured by it.
Amongst the large holders are the
Duke of Norfolk with 40,176 acres, the
Duke of Northumberland with 186,397
acres, and the Dukes of Cleveland and
Devonshire and twelve others with each
100.000 and upwards. Precisely similar
efforts have been and are now being,
made, by the wealthy in British colonies,
to secure a monopoly of the land. In
Victoria, for instance, according to the
most recent official returns furnished in
the Government Statist?s ?Year Book? for
1877-?B, the total area of this colony is
estimated at 56,446,720 acres. To
arrive at what is available for occupa-
tion, however, it is necessary to deduct
30,208,752 acres (which are classified
as mountain ranges, lakes, lagoons,
mallee scrub, towns and roads, also as
forest, town, mining and pastoral re-
serves), so that there are left 26,237,968
acres, as the area actually available. Of
this area, there were 18,206,165 acres
already alienated, and only 12,002,587
acres remaining open for selection at the
end of 1877. The total number of
?holdings? was 45,448. Of these,
there were 12,408 holders (of from Ito
49 acres each) having between them
only 239,850 acres, while there were
204 holders (of 10,001 to upwards of
40.000 each) who had between them no
less than 4,177,685 acres, or more than
one-sixth of the entire accessible lands
of the colony?and, 2,960 other holders
(of from 501 to 10,000 acres each),
having between them another one-
sixth part of the colony. Against these
large holders in this colony, the com-
plaint is not simply that they have
monopolized the lands (although that
would be bad enough), but, that they
monopolize the best and most fertile
portions- -and further (and worse still),
that the means by which they have
acquired these lands have been to a large
extent fraudulent and unjust. These
squatters, it must be remembered, first
became rich on the cheaply acquired
proceeds of runs which, through political
influence, they obtained almost free
(from a Government which raised a
large proportion of its revenue from
working miners, who were charged 30s.
per month for the privilege of occupying
under license for mining purposes 12 by
12 feet of land, unfit for depasturage
besides having to pay an export duty of
2s. 6d. per ounce upon their gold produc-
tion), Having become rich in this
manner, they set themselves to mani-
pulating the Duffy Land Act of 1862
(which was ? to provide homes for the
people?) in such a way, that 1| millions
of acres of the best lands were parted
with before the fraud was arrested.
Since then they have manipulated other
Acts of Parliament (which were also
designed to secure lona fide cultivators)
and have added largely to their estates
by a system of collusion with dummy
selectors, defrauding the country. In
addition to these malpractices, they have
further attempted to defraud the country
by the unauthorised fencing-in of sur-
veyed roads, rendering it almost impos-
sible in some districts for travellers to
make their way about. In the shire of
Hampden, it has been shown (by data
specially collected by a reporter of the
Melbourne Age newspaper) that out of
1 million acres of the best lands in the
colony 878,000 acres are in the hands of
about 40 squatters, and that about
50,000 acres in this shire alone have?
through the encroachments of these men
?been thrown out of tillage. The total
area held by squatters, in runs, under
pastoral licenses (in addition to pur-
chased lands alreaded noted), according


to the ? Year Book,? was in the year
1877, no less than 20,854,615 acres.
There were then 801 runs?and the
rent received was �138,475, or a
fraction over l�d, per acre. From
special inquiry, it is found that this
large area of 20 millions of acres
includes the 12 millions shown as still
available for selection, and is further
made up out of the 23 millions which
are classified as mountain ranges, mallee
scrub, etc., etc. Furthermore, as there are
over 3 millions of acres accounted for in
the total returns of ? holdings,? short
of the area known to be actually
alienated, it is obvious that a large
share of this too may be put down to
deficient returns of the actual area held
by squatters. So that, between lands
known to be owned by them, those under
pastoral licenses, those pillaged in roads,
and the large area short accounted for,
it will be seen to what gigantic pro-
portions monopoly of land has been
carried even in a new colony like that
of Victoria. It will also be recognised
what a pressing duty devolved upon our
Legislature recently in adopting a pro-
gressive Land Tax upon these large
estates. This measure has given great
umbrage to the wealthy minority?and,
viewed with the fact that their pastoral
licenses will all expire in 1880, and that
they will then be charged an increased
rate of rent, it is no wonder the Legis-
lative Council (ever conspicuous for its
leaning towards the squatters) is par-
ticularly anxious, at this juncture, to
have a power of veto over all legislation
emanating from the more popular As-
sembly which may be designed for the
general good instead of for the special
enrichment of the squatters. In Mr
Browning?s book upon Great Britain,
published in 1834, at page 278 occur
the following passages:?
?The bane of the country is not a defi-
ciency of national income to support the
population, but the inequality in the distribu-
tion of that income. The amount of property
annually produced in Great Britain ia
moderately estimated at �310,000.000 sterl-
ing;, averaging about �93 19s to every
family of five persons; an ample sufficiency
for comfortable subsistence. Yet, so immo-
derately unequal is the Hjstribution of pro-
perty, that while about 80,000 families or
one-fortieth of the population enjoy upwards
of eight-fortieths of the income or �63,000,000
sterling. The agricultural portion, numbering
about 800,000 families, or ten-fortieths of the
population, scarcely obtain three-fortieths of
the property raised, or �20,000,000 sterling.
This not only explains the cause of the
wretchedness of the many and the vicious
prodigality of the few, but also the mys-
terious, apparently irreconcilable but indu-
bitable fact of the rapid progress of national
wealth concomitant with an increasing number
of parochial dependents. * * * That it
is evident that this increase of property has
been and must continue to be produced by
the operative classes, or by that portion of
the people which creates an excess of com-
modities over iis consumption.?
Nothing could be more self-evident than
the monstrous evils which follow as a
natural result upon the monopoly in
land in England. For instance, in the
census returns of England and Wales
alone (in 1871) the total population was
22,791,578 souls, while the number of
paupers (in 1877) in these places was
estimated as 749,812, or nearly one-
third of their entire population. The
system under which the poor are as-
sisted is as faulty as the system under
which so much poverty is brought about
?for, it appears that of �12,948,174
(the sum raised by poor rates during
1876), more than one-third of that sum
was expended for other purposes than
the relief of the poor! The way in
which some of the large holdings have
been acquired is explained by Joseph
Fisher, F. E.H.S., in his allusions to the
Commonages, in his little book,
?History of Land-holdings in England,?
published 1876. At page 79 he says:
?The lords of the manor, with a landlord
Parliament, asserted their claims to the Com-
monages, and these lands, belonging to the
people, were gradually enclosed and became
the possession of indviduals. The enclosing
of Commonages began in the reign of Queen
Anne, and was continued in the reigns of all


the sovereigns of the House of Hanover, The ?and send paupers and soldiers to new
first enclosure Act was passed in 1709; in
the following 30 years the average number of
enclosing Acts was about 3 each year. In
the following 50 years there were nearly 40
each year; and in the 40 years of the 19th
century it was nearly 50 enclosing Acts per
annum. There were 4,307,883 acres, or
about l-lSth part of the entire area of Great
Britain and Ireland, enclosed under 3954
Acts passed between the reigns of Queen
Anne and William 4th. Had these lands
been allotted in small farms, they might have
been made the means of support of from
500,000 to 1,000,000 families, and they would
have afforded employment and sustenance to
all the poor, and thus rendered compulsory
taxation under the Poor-law system un-
necessary. But, the landlords seized on them
and made the tenantry pay the poor rate, The
British poor law is a slur upon a boasted
civilisation. The unequal distribution of
land and of wealth leads to great riches and
great poverty. * * * This evil has in-
tensified in magnitude, and a permanent
army of paupers numbering from 829,281 to
upwards of 1,000,000 has to be provided for at
a cost of about �8,000,000 a year, and this
amount is paid not by landlords but by
tenants, in addition to the various charities
founded by benevolent persons.?
It is worthy of consideration whether
all such old Acts, purporting to confer
titles of the public estate to individuals,
without ? valuable consideration,? may
not be repealed by the Legislature of to-
day. It has only been the deplorable
ignorance of the agricultural tenantry
which has so long sheltered these owners
from their just responsibilities. "What
the people of Great Britain require is
free, compulsory and secular education,
wider representation, and honest em-
ployment. If they had the two former,
they would soon show ?where the shoe
pinches? in a quiet and legitimate way
?and, if the latter cannot be provided
at home, those who monopolise the land
should join those who are interested in
opening up new markets for their manu-
factures, in order to liberally encourage
emigration by means of assisted loans or
otherwise to Africa, South America and
other sparsedly peopled countries Let
ships of war be converted into transports
countries where they may benefit them-
selves, and at the same time contribute
to the importance ot the mother country
by pioneering and settling new lands
and opening up new markets for English
merchandise, and practical good may
result. According to the latest estimate
of Behm and Wagner, the population of
the globe is 1,423,917,000, and the area
of land surface 54,640,300 square miles,
which gives an average density of about
28 to the square mile, or about 22
acres per head. The population of the
United Kingdom per square mile is 265
people?and according to Dr. Parr, who
has given attention to the subject of
proximity of population and its effects
on the death rate, it is demonstrated
that?
? Where we stand on an average 400 feet
off from each other, we live on an average 50
years; where we are 300 feet off, we live -40
years; where we come within 60 feet of each
other, we live but 30 years; and where we
are but 20 feet off, we live but 25 years.
Some centres, such as Liverpool, have
63,823 human beings to a square mile, or
about 12 feet by 12 feet to each person, and
such density is demonstrated to be most fatal
to life, especially if the sanitary provisions
are defective.?
EVILS OF STANDING ARMIES.
It should be born in mind :
Ist. That a country having a large
proportion of its population under arms
loses their labor towards the develop-
ment of its natural resources.
2nd. That the soldiers and sailors do
not only (a) not contribute to the
development of natural resources and to
the revenue of their country, but (b)
they are a charge upon the producing
powers, and on the cost of government?
which, therefore, of necessity, has to be
borne in undue proportion by the in-
dustrial classes.
3rd. That the soldier?s life is one
which (a) induces idleness of habit.
(b) The bearing of arms as a profession,
for a livelihood, is an inhuman and
degrading occupation when properly


estimated?and (c) it is demoralising and
calculated to lead to mental degeneracy
in the finer qualities of the mind.
4th. That the mere fact of each
nation keeping up a standing army (a)
often leads to conflicts which otherwise
would be avoided?and (b) the cost of
maintaining standing armies is a ruin-
ous drain on the resources of countries,
(c), as are also the costs of conflicts, the
munitions of war, and the incidental
expenses connected with warfare.
sth. That the recruiting system (a)
draws a class of men of the best physical
development away from industrial oc-
cupations to be destroyed in war? (b)
this not only leaves to industry the
least fitted to follow it, but it occasions
a disproportion of the sexes?and (c)
does injury to the physical development
of the species by a loss of suitable
progenitors. The losses in war, too,
(d) leave mothers and children unpro-
vided for, homes desolated, hospitals
filled with good men crippled, property
destroyed, and commercial and industrial
pursuits paralyzed and half-ruined in
many cases.
CAUSES OP WARFARE.
If we want people to do hotter we must
begin by teaching them to know better.
Education is the first essential step
towards substantial reform?and there
can be no doubt but that, when educa-
tion is more general, and people come
to know how wars are brought about,
the masses who have to contribute the
soldiers to do the fighting, and who have
to pay, moreover, the largest share of
the cost of war, perhaps, will set their
faces more firmly against any attempt on
the part of their rulers to embroil their
country in war. Some of the influences
at work to bring about wars may be
catalogued thus:?
Ist. The religious and national pre-
judices and dislikes, and the suspicious
misgivings as to the motives by which
other countries are actuated?all arising
from ignorance, and the want of a better
knowledge of each other, and the want
of repose of such a confidence in each
other as each expects for itself.
2nd. The policy of Dynasties, the
ambition of men in power, the desire
for increase of territory, and the systems
by which the co-operative assistance
and sympathies of the masses are
secured, to carry out the designs of the
few who govern. The system adopted
in those countries where the voice of the
people is supposed to have a certain
weight with the government, is to
work up the lowest passions of the
people through newspapers and speeches,
under plausible, designing, and false
appeals to their manhood, their patriot-
ism and their courage. The real and
true issue (weighed in sober reasoning)
is not presented honestly with all the
appalling, inevitable consequences which
follow warfare. These are altogether
ignored or kept in the background. For,
it is morally certain that, were they
properly appreciated, such Governments
would receive scant support to their war
schemes from moderately intelligent
people. Under autocratic governments
(with ignorant subjects) the system
adopted for arousing the masses into
war enthusiasm is by appeals to their
religion and nationality. The Church
and Crown (working together) com-
pletely hoodwink the populace into any
enormities, in the way of warfare, that
may be desired.
3rd. The personal interests of large
bond-holders and persons interested in
the supply of the materials of warfare
under contract or otherwise?and the
specious devices, through unsuspected
channels, by which these interested
men work upon those, who, being
connected with the Government, hold
the power of making war ?and it may
be difficult even for a Disraeli, in a
war like that between Russia and
Turkey, to distinguish how far the
national interests (in the nation?s atti-
tude towards the belligerents) may be


compromised by the influence which
English holders of Turkey bonds may
wield.
4th. Diplomatic blunders of speech
or of correspondence between nations,
or between two or more men who may
be supposed to represent them. Also,
the violation of treaties, and of under-
takings between nations.
sth. Referring more particularly to
internal warfare or rebellion, the chief
causes may be stated to be:?The
systematic neglect on the part of
Governments to provide education, and
representative legislation for the masses.
The masses being deprived of their
lands, and being afforded insufficient
means of subsistence?the masses being
denied the liberty of expressing their
grievances?being exposed to the C' n
sequences of needless wars, in which
they are compelled first to fight and
afterwards to pay the cost of?over-
taxation to support costly Governments,
sham pomp, a worthless nobility and
priestcraft, police and soldiery, and
benevolent and other institutions, which
in a prosperous condition of masses
enjoying true liberiy would not be
required. In short, neglectful or despotic
class government, and the various forms
of taxation, oppression and neglect of
the masses, by which such forms of
Government are invariably sustained in
power until they bring, by reason of
their corruption, their own dissolution.
COST AND USELESSNESS OF WARS.
"When the wars of recent date, such
as the Crimean war (with over a million
of men sacrificed in it) ?the Franco-
Prussian war (with its cost to France of
�371,515,280 sterling, besides the fear-
ful number of slain on both sides) ?
and the Russo-Turkey war (with its
long list of murdered men and wasted
pounds) are considered, it must surely
be admitted that it is high time civi-
lized nations adopted the best available
means to stop such appalling carnage
and waste of resources? The St.
Petersburg Gazette publishes the fol-
lowing summary of the cost of the
great wars of the last 25 years :
? The Crimean war cost the lives of 750,000
men ; the Italian war (1859), 45,000 ; the
Schleswig-Holstein war, 3,000 ; the Prusso-
Austrian war (1866), 45,000 ; the Mexican
expedition, 65.000; the Franco-Prussian war,
215,000 ; the Turco-Rnssian war, 600,000 ?
total, 1,748,000; or, with the 800,000 men
killed in the American war, 2,548,000. This
number does not include deaths from typhus,
cholera, and other diseases inseparable from
war. As regards the cost in money, the
Crimean war cost the countries engaged
�340,000,000; the Italian, �60,000,000; the
American, �1,480,000,000 ; the Schleswig-
Holstein, �7,000,000 ; the Prusso-Austrian,
�66,000,000; the Mexican expedition,
�40,000,000 ; the Franco - Prussian,
�500,000,000; the Turco - Russian,
�250,000,000 Total, �2,743,000,000.?
Mr John Bright, in a recent address,
on this subject, quoted Lord Russell,
who said:?
? He doubted whether there had been any
war during the last 100 years that might not
have been avoided without any sacrifice of
the interests or honor of England, by those
reasonable coneessions which we are con-
stantly making am-mgst each other as indi-
viduals, and which would be in no degree
injurious or dishonorable if made between
nations.? * * * ? The American war,?
remarked Mr Bright, ?cost England nearly
�100,000,000. It is now generally condemned
for its folly and wickedness, and it left
feelings of anger and bitterness which are
only now slowly passing away. * * *
The war with France cost about a thousand
millions, yet almost every one now condemns
it too, as it might also have been avoided."
THE DUTV OF GOVERNMENTS
Notwithstanding that the causes of
rebellions, and wars between nations,
are so well understood, it is disgraceful
that the wealthy governing classes
should, by their sordid selfishness, con-
tinue to deprive an overwhelming
majority of mankind of so large a share
of that happiness which a beneficent
Creator has rendered it possible to attain
upon this beautiful Planet. It is de-
plorable to see powerful Governments
like that of Russia and Germany, for
instance, wasting with such criminal
prodigality, their beat resources upoa


senseless armaments for the avowed
purpose of preventing war, whilst simul-
taneously they are courting war in their
midst?for, their own dominions are
being crowded with Nihilists and
Socialists, who have been stirred to
rebellion by these extravagances. Good
thinking men, who, with proper con-
sideration shown to them, would make
the most valuable of citizens, but who,
by bad, tyrannical government, are
first oppressed, and then are held guilty
of treason, punishable by death, banish-
ment or imprisonment, if they dare to
express the grievances and wants im-
posed upon them, and ask for their
redress. Such Governments not only
ruin their own subjects, but they are
disturbers of the peace of adjacent
nations and the world generally. For,
while Russia and Germany are so armed,
France and Austria and other countries
are forced, in self-defence, to incur a
like prodigal expenditure for armament.
England, in fact, is little better, so far
as the relations between the wealthy
governing classes and her numerous poor
are concerned. For, notwithstanding
the boasted liberality of her aristocracy,
they wax fat at the expense of the great
majority, as statistics indubitably prove
??and until even-handed justice is done
for the masses by greater legislative con-
sideration, with better provision for their
sustenance?and until their own land
can be used and enjoyed by them, our
nation has nothing to boast of in this
respect?and if she enjoys an immunity
from rebellion, it is not because her
people are not allowed to express their
grievances but because they lack intelli-
gence and legislative representation.
The wants of the poor find no such
adequate expression as their importance
and urgency demand in her legislature -
and herein lies a sacred duty which
should at once be discharged. Large
mining and manufacturing proprietaries
have ample means of commanding atten-
tion and securing, by legislation or
otherwise, any rights they should enjoy
?but, the poor laborers. What of
them ? Well?it is true there is, in
extreme cases, the dry crust of charity
voted to them to keep them alive?but
never have they been placed in circum-
stances which will enable them to
provide honorably and independently
for themselves.
In conclusion, most persons have un-
thinkingly espoused the common notion
that wars between nations cannot be
avoided?and that any effort in that direc-
tion is Utopian. It is simply disastrous
that any such absurd and unfounded con-
clusion should so long intrude itself
upon an advanced civilization?and all
that is required to explode it is a proper
ventilation of such means as are here
suggested by which any differences
between nations may be settled in a
Court. As the most efficacious mode of
avoiding disease is to observe, in health,
those conditions which conserve a con-
tinuance of vigor?so, the most effectual
mode of .avoiding Rebellion is to adopt
economy in government, and give
the masses a chance of living
by honest industry ; and the best
mode of avoiding Wars between nations
is to establish, dining peace, a
National Federal Tribunal by which
any differences arising may be peace-
fully adjusted. People should be
brought to know, not only that ignor-
ance is the cause of all so-called ?? sin,?
but that there is no force so potent as
that of mind. The abolition of warfare,
like other great reforms, may be attained
by the people agitating for it, and
through the instrumentality of leading
politicians and literary men?men, who
are in a position to educate public
opinion and give effect to that opinion
by legislation. Indeed, the day is not
distant when the governing classes in
Europe will be made aware of their
duty to humanity and must perform it;
and when, prophetically speaking:
Swords will be beaten into plough
shares and spears into pruning hooks,
and when?? nation shall not lift up
sword against nation, neither shall they
learn war any more.?
