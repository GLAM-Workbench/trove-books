Red Cross Cookery Book.
PREFACE.
F all the organisations that have helped to
Ip make this fearful war less destructive,
the work of the Red Cross and St. John
Ambulance Associations stands foremost. These
Associations have spent, and are spending freely,
that precious lives may he saved. The calls
upon them are tremendous ; and, if they econo-
mise, it must be at the expense of the sick and
wounded—the heroes to whom we owe our
present safety.
In order to help the Red Cross and aug-
ment its funds this little book has been printed,
and may its success be the means of alleviating
pain and suffering.

Glaze over with white of egg, and bake in a quick oven. Chop
some oysters small with a sharp knife. Put loz. butter in a

HOW TO KEEP COMPRESSED YEAST.
Press it down firmly in an earthenware jar. Sprinkle a
little cold water on it if it is dry and crumbly. Place this
jar in another vessel containing water, and cover it with a
damp cloth, the ends of which are allowed to touch the water.
Store in a cold place.— l

BREAD.—I.
(For three 21b. Loaves).
Three to four cups water (warm) or water and milk, two
level tablespoons Compressed Yeast, 10 cups flour, 1 tablespoon
salt, 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix the yeast and sugar well with

dissolve the salt in it, then add yeast. The water should be
lukewarm. Mix the dough and leave it covered in a warm
place; when it rises—in about an hour or so—knead it again
and leave it covered up as before. When it has risen a second
time, mould the loaves and put them in tins, cover them and
leave them again to prove before the fire. When they come
up nicely (say in another hour) bake in the oven.—
