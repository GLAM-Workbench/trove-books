Introduction .
Owing to the immense area of tlie lands in Western Australia
there has been great difficulty in the past for selectors, without any
previous knowledge, to get definite information to enable them to
locate themselves upon land suitable for the purposes for which it
may be required. It is, therefore, considered necessary that some
reliable information should be placed in a concise form, to assist
intending selectors in choosing localities in which they would be
suited. Although this small work is not as comprehensive as it
might be, it is to be hoped that it will meet a long-recognised
want.
The South-Western Division of Western Australia is
estimated to contain 67,000 square miles, and comprises the most
temperate climate of Western Australia. In the immediate South-
West, which is heavily timbered, it is well watered and capable of
supporting a large population. It is for the most part undulating
country, with the exception of the Darling Range and a few others.
There are no extensive mountain ranges in this Division, The
numerous rivers which run into the sea are chiefly very short and,
generally speaking, drain the country within a hundred miles of
the coast. The climate is exceptionally good, and the rainfall
%
varies from 19 inches in the Northern and 15 inches in the Eastern,
to 43 and 32 inches, respectively, in the South-Western and
Southern portions of the Division.
Most of the European grains, fruits, and vegetables can be
cultivated and brought to a high state of perfection. The soil in
parts is sandy, but even this sand, with such a bountiful rainfall,
is highly productive. There is a large extent of light friable soil,
suitable for all kinds of crops.


LANDS TAPPED BY THE GREAT SOUTHERN
RAILWAY.
A large number of persons arriving in the Colony land at Albany,
the Southern port of the South-West Division. Within a few minutes??
walk of the jetty at this town may be found the office of the Govern-
ment Land Agent, who is supplied with plans of every part of the
adjacent country and copies of the Land Laws, which are dis-
tributed to intending selectors free of cost. Requisite information
as to the class of lands and the mode of obtaining the same may be
obtained from him, and he has instructions to see that persons
seeking vacant Crown Lands suitable for settlement are actually
taken out to the locality at the expense of the Government. Albany
is the starting point of the Great Southern Railway, and is a means
of access to many hundreds of thousands of acres of first-class
land. Travelling Northward along the line the country for about
40 miles is very well adapted for the growth of fruit and vege-
tables, but not so well for cereals. After this distance, the land
is eminently suited for the growth of cereals and all kinds of fruits.
About 60 miles from Albany, we come to the Tenterden Agri-
cultural Area, where a fairly large area of land has been surveyed
into lots. This is one of the many areas which have been sub-
divided, and, in the majority of cases fairly well settled on�
Descriptions of the whole of the surveyed agricultural areas in the
Colony are to be found in another part of the pamphlet. Of the
lands available along this line, only a very small portion is sub-
divided into agricultural areas, and the balance is all open for
selection before survey, but it will, from time to time, be sub-
divided as settlement progresses.
Midway between Albany and Beverley is Katanning, a rising
town, surrounded with first class agricultural land. Close to this
Townsite is an area which has been surveyed into lots, and nearly
all selected; but there is also, in this locality, a large area of good
land awaiting settlement which has not yet been surveyed, but is
open to free selection. Residing in this town is a Government
Land Agent, who has an extensive knowledge of the whole of the
lands along the Great Southern Railway, and who has been
instructed to point out to intending selectors the vacant land. The
lands about here are eminently suited for agricultural and fruit-
growing purposes.
The great majority of the lands along this line are timbered
with white gum, York gum, jam, and sheaoak, and would cost from


40s. to 60s. per acre to clear. The rainfall is fairly good, being
from 17 to 19 inches. There is a large amount of settlement, and
good object lessons may be obtained from a visit to the farms and
orchards of several selectors who have located themselves in
different places, notably near Katanning.
Towards Beverley the character of the country changes some-
what, and the timber consists more of jam. The soil is well adapted
to the growth of cereals, and the other portions of the South-
Western Division are especially adapted for fruit-culture. Eighteen
miles by the Eastern Railway from Beverley, we reach the town of
York, in which a Government Land Agent is also located, who will
give intending selectors any information they require. From this
town a railway will shortly be in course of construction to a
flourishing agricultural centre called Greenhills, where may be
seen a great many prosperous homesteads, showing the adaptability
of the soil for the growth of cereals and fruit.
Continuing down the Eastern Railway, one- passes through a
hilly country which is especially adapted for fruit-growing, and in
some cases it has been subdivided into blocks of from 15 to 20
acres, which are being sold as suburban lots. A great number of
them are being utilised for the purpose of growing vines and
fruits.
Tilgarn Railway. ?North am is situated some 78 miles from
Perth along the Eastern Railway, and is the town from which the
line extends to the Coolgardie Goldfields. Here, also, there is a
Government Land Agent, who will show intending selectors, and
if necessary point out on the ground the land which may be
vacant and suitable for their purpose, and also see that they have
an opportunity of examining the farms around that centre. To
the North-East of Northam there is, in the locality of Goomalling,
a large area of land open to selection, which is timbered with
salmon gum and gimlet wood, and the land is especially adapted
for the growth of cereals. The soil is fairly heavy red loam, and
is capable of extensive cultivation. It is proposed to construct a
Railway Line from Northam to this centre. At the present time
the examination and classification of these lands is being made,
and there is no doubt that in a very short time nearly the whole
of this area will be selected and cultivated. Eastward from
Northam, on both sides of the Coolgardie Railway line, there are
extensive tracts of this forest country; the only drawback is that
as one gets farther East the rainfall is not so great, the average


being 13 or 14 inches. However, this is in some degree com-
pensated for by the quality of the soil and the closeness of the
market, and experience has proved that the rainfall is ample for
successful cultivation. The demand for all sorts of produce from
the extensive goldfields around Coolgardie is very great and, of
course, ever increasing.
There are several surveyed agricultural areas along this route,
notably Meckering, upon which a large number of selectors are
located who are doing good work upon the land.
Midland Railway. ?From the Midland Junction, situated
about 10 miles from the capital along the Eastern Railway, there
is the Midland Railway Co.?s line, which has been built on the
Land Grant system, running North and almost parallel to the
coast till it reaches Geraldton, a seaport about 260 miles North of
Perth,. Although the Company holds large areas along this line,
there is a great extent of country still remaining in the hands of
the Government, a great portion of which is well adapted for corn
growing and fruit culture.
SOUTH-WESTERN RAILWAY TAPPED BY MAIN LINES
OF ROAD CONNECTING WITH THE VARIOUS
RAILWAY STATIONS.
To selectors wishing to engage in the cultivation of fruit,
potatoes, and other root crops, and to those who incline to dairying,
or mixed farming in connection with a dairy, the districts con-
nected with the capital by this railway and its feeders offer
exceptional advantages. From Perth, in a Southerly direction, this
railway passes through freehold lands for about 22 miles; at this
point it reaches the Serpentine Agricultural Area. This area,
though inferior to the country met with further on, is worthy of
the selector?s notice, on account of its convenience of access.
The next point of importance is the Coolup Agricultural Area,
adjoining the township of Pinjarrah, on the South. Here, on both
sides of the Murray River, there is a large extent of fair agricul-
tural land. Adjoining this, on the South, is the Harvey Agri-
cultural Area, which contains a large extent of excellent land for
agriculture and the growth of root crops. Next comes the Uduc
Agricultural Area, of an exactly similar description. Between
the last three mentioned agricultural areas and the coast, there is


a large tract of unalienated land, containing very rich flats and
swamps suitable for the growth of potatoes; while on their East
side they are flanked by the coast range, covered with splendid
jarrah timber and intersected by numerous creeks, having strips
of good land along their banks.
Continuing South from the Uduc Area, the railway passes
through freehold land to the thriving seaport town of Bunbury.
About 15 miles from Bunbury it is joined by the railway line from
the Collie Coalfield, in course of construction. At the head of this
branch line splendid timber is found, with much good soil in
patches through the forest. From Bunbury the railway runs in-
land, passing through freehold land for about 12 miles, when it
touches the Boyanup Agricultural Area, the site of the junction of
the Donnybrook and Vasse railways. This area contains a fair
proportion of good agricultural land. Proceeding inland to a
point about 26 miles from Bunbury, the railway reaches Donny-
brook, the present terminus. From this point the Preston Agri-
cultural Area stretches East and South. This Area contains much
good grazing land, also suitable for the growth of fruit and cereals.
This may be considered the edge of an immense area of alternating
splendid forests and good soils, extending to the coast on the South
and Eastward to the Great Southern Railway.
This fine extent of country will be opened up for about 30
miles by the Donnybrook-Bridgetown Railway, which passes with-
in a short distance of much fine land, notably the Tanjanerup
Agricultural Area, which consists of splendid grazing country;
much of it suitable for fruit-growing and other cultivation. From
Boyanup, a branch line runs through the Boyanup Agricultural
Area and on to the seaport town of Busselton. From this point
South-East along the coast there is a large extent of fair grazing
country, with considerable patches of the best class of soils for
potato cultivation, and also much of it suitable for the growth of
cereals and fruit. The country described above has a rainfall
varying from 30 to 45 inches per annum. The cost of clearing the
land varies from �2 to �5 per acre, though in many cases this cost
can be reduced to a few shillings per acre.
Where the settler ringbarks the country a year or two in.
advance of clearing, the aid of fire renders this a cheap and profit-
able method of bringing the land under cultivation, for immediately
after ringbarking its value for grazing purposes becomes largely
increased.


Tlie yield of potatoes on tlie suitable soils is from five to ten
tons per acre; of wheat, from 15 to 30 bushels per acre; of hay,
from Ito 2 tons per acre. The value of orchards in full bearing
being up to �lOO per acre per annum. The forest lands will
yield from o to 2o loads of marketable timber per acre.
In conclusion, there is not the slightest doubt that the lands of
TV estern Australia will prove a good sound investment to the
selector, taking into consideration the quality and great variety of
the soils ; generally speaking, the abundant rainfall; the easy means
of reaching the market by railways and roads, and the demand
foi kinds of produce, which is ever increasing, owing to the
settlement of population on the extensive goldfields of the Colony,
which aie being rapidly developed. All these advantages are open
not only to the man of capital, but, owing to the advances made by
the Agricultural Bank for proposed improvements to men of small
means, brings the possibility of a modest competence to any man
w ho is prepared to devote his time, capital, and energies to calling
forth the resources of the land.
To fuithei enable selectors to choose a suitable locality, they
may obtain other and fuller information, plans, Ac., free of cost,
at the Head Office of the Bands and Surveys Department, in the
Post Office Buildings, St. George?s Lane, Perth, opposite the
Anglican Cathedral, or from the Offices of the various Government
Land Agents at Albany, Katanning, York, Yortham, Vasse, Bun-
bury, and Geraldton, who have been instructed to see that selectors
are actually taken on to the land which is open for selection.


Descriptive Notes on the Surveyed Agri-
cultural Areas in the Colony.
AGEICULTUEAL AEEAS ALONG THE GEEAT SOUTHEEN
RAILWAY.
The agricultural areas here referred to are along the route of
the Great Southern Railway, which connects Albany (King George?s
Sound) with Beverley (the terminus of the Eastern Railway).
Lying, as they do, along the route of a splendid line of railway,
between the capital of the Colony and Albany, the port of call for
the' great ocean liners, with land admirably adapted for the growth
of cereals, and in many places of fruit and vegetables, these areas
possess many inducements to settlement.
Beverley Agricultural Area.
This area, which by rail is 103 miles from Perth, and 238
miles from Albany, and is also within five miles of the rising town
of Beverley, was gazetted open for selection in September, 1893.
It contains 36,000 kcres, and adjoins the Great Southern Railway,
also fronting on the Dale River, The timber on this country
consists mainly of York gum and jam, and it is estimated that the
average cost of clearing would be from 30s. to 60s. per acre. The
soil is well adapted for the growth of cereals, and fruit also thrives
on such country, all of, which will repay selection and cultivation.
Here, as in the Meckering? Area, a man should select a square mile
of land for the purposes of the mixed. farming for which it is
especially suited. -
Moorumbine Agricultural Area.-
This area was gazetted open for selection in July, 1893. It
possesses the advantage of having the Great Southern Railway
running directly through the middle of it, and adjoins the Brookton
siding, at Seabrook townsite, which, by rail, is about 223 miles from
Albany, 20 miles from Beverley, and 118 miles from Perth. The
land is much the same as that in the Beverley Area, and the
remarks which apply to one apply to both. It is certain that
these areas will be largely availed of for cereal growing and fruit
culture.


Narrogin Agricultural Area.
The Narrogin Agricultural Area was opened for selection in
January, 1893. It contains 25,000 acres, of which 12,782 acres are
surveyed into 42 blocks. This is also a good corn-growing area,
and it directly adjoins the Great Southern Railway, and is distant
only two miles from the Narrogin Railway station, which is about
64 miles from Beverley, 179 miles from Albany, and 162 miles
from Perth.
Wickepin Agricultural Area.
. The Wickepin Agricultural Area, which is about 10 miles
from the Great Southern Railway, was opened for selection in
March, 1893. It contains 97,000 acres, of which 37,195 are sur-
veyed and cut up into 222 lots. This is regarded as an especially
good area, much of the land being of an excellent description, and
well suited for the growth of both cereals and fruit. The timber
is chiefly York gum and jam, and the country would cost about
30s. to 60s. an acre to clear. Excellent roads lead from the railway
to the area, which is served by the Caballing siding, which is
situated, by rail, about 55 miles from Beverley, 188 miles from
Albany, and 153 miles from Perth. Good water has been obtained
by sinking at shallow depths in this area.
Wagin Agricultural Area.
This area was thrown open for selection in November, 1892,
and contains 26,000 acres, of which 16,421 acres are surveyed.
Only a limited portion is rich enough for the growth of cereals, but
much of the land is suitable for fruit culture. As the area is
situated on the Great Southern Railway, adjoining Wagin Lake
townsite, the position of which is herein described, and as there is
already considerable settlement in the vicinity, no doubt there will
immediately be inquiry for land in this area. Puntaping townsite
is situated within this area, consisting of 44 suburban lots, averag-
ing from 4 to 13 acres each.
Darkan Agricultural Area,
This area was opened for selection in April, 1894, It contains
62,000 acres, of which 12,131 acres have been surveyed into 52 lots.
This area is distant from the Great Southern Railway about 30
miles, and may be said to be situated between Wagin on the East,
and Bunbury on the West. There are good roads leading through
the area, and on to Wagin Railway station, which is 94 miles from
Beverley, 149 miles from Albany, and 192 from Perth. This


area contains a fair quantity of rich soil, and has a splendid rain-
fall. A branch of the Hillman River runs through it. The land
would cost about �4 an acre to clear, and is well adapted for fruit
and cereals.
KAT ANNIN G AGRICULTURAL AREA.
This is one of the largest and best agricultural areas in the
Colony, and settlers located thereon have already achieved a con-
siderable measure of success. It was opened for selection in
January, 1892, and contains 100,000 acres, of which 40,997 are
surveyed into 282 blocks. Situated between Beverley and Albany,
by rail about 127 miles from the former, and 116 miles from the
latter place, and 225 miles from Perth, close to the central
station and chief stopping place on the Great Southern Railway,
and a flourishing settlement thrown open by the W.A. Land
Company, this fine area was bound to attract settlement; this it
has already done in a marked degree. The suitability of this portion
of the Colony for cereals is largely demonstrated by the establish-
ment of a first-class roller-flour mill at the townsite of Katanning,
by Messrs. F. and 0. Piesse. The land costs from 30s. to 60s. an
acre to clear, and water is obtainable, especially after clearing.
The Great Southern Railway runs right through the area. Besides
a net-work of roads running for the most part parallel and at right
angles, three townsites are laid out along the line within the area,
Woodanilling, Moojebing, and Pinwernying, and for the encourage-
ment of village settlement 394 town and suburban lots of from
three-quarters of an acre to 18 acres have been surveyed. Ho doubt
this is one of the best areas yet declared in the Colony, and the
settlement already taking place is encouraging. The peculiar suit-
ability of this land for fruit culture is brought prominently before
the notice of the public by the splendid orchards which have been
planted close to Katanning townsite by Messrs. P. and C. Piesse and
the W.A. Land Company. At this town a fully equipped Land
Office is established, at which intending selectors may receive
every information free, and if necessary the Government Land
Agent will see they are taken out to vacant land suitable for their
requirements.
Ewltamartup Agricultural Area.
The Ewlyamartup area was gazetted as open for selection in
March, 1893. It adjoins the Great Southern Railway in the
vicinity of Broome Hill, which is an important settlement since
taken over by the Government, situate by rail 139 miles from


Beverley, 104 miles from Albany, and 237 miles from Perth. It
contains 46,000 acres, of which 39,258 acres are surveyed and laid
ont in 108 blocks ready for selection. The timber on this country
is chiefly York and white gum. The land is in parts very good,
and suitable for corn-growing. It would cost, on the average,
about 30s. to 60s. an acre to clear, and there are good roads
intersecting it, giving easy access to the railway line. The area is
not particularly well watered, but doubtless clearing would largely
increase the supply, as in the cases of other areas.
Tenteeden Agricultural Area.
The Tenter den Agricultural Area along the Great Southern
Railway is, by rail, 50 miles from Albany, and 291 miles from
Perth. It was opened for selection in November, 1892, and con-
tains 30,000 acres, of which 10,750 are surveyed into 68 blocks.
The land is chiefly timbered with white gum, and is of the same
average quality as that of the other areas along the Great Southern
Railway, much of it being suitable for corn-growing, and more of
it for fruit culture. A special feature in favour of this area is the
large rainfall, which increases as a Southerly direction is taken.
This area has also been laid out and mapped with a view to village
settlements, 55 town lots and 57 suburban lots having been
% �
surveyed and thrown open. Speaking once more in general terms
of the areas along the Great Southern Railway, they are essentially
corn-growing areas, and are easily and comparatively economically
cleared, whilst in many places the vine and fruit of all kinds will
flourish abundantly. They are nearly all easily approached by the
railway, which is well equipped by stations, sidings, and rolling
stock, and which runs a daily service.
AREAS ADJACENT TO THE SOUTH-WESTERN AND BRANCH
RAILWAYS.
In dealing with the areas along or adjacent to the South-
Western Railway and its extension to Donnybrook, a totally
different class of land is found to that �f the areas along the Great
<
Southern Railway. Whilst the latter areas are especially suitable
for cereals and fruit culture, the former includes land that is more
adapted for fruit and vegetable growing, and for dairy farming
In some places the country is heavily timbered, costing a con-
siderable sum to clear; but against this must be placed the fact


that much smaller areas are sufficient for a selector, the land being
capable of ?intense culture.? It is also, for the most part, well
watered, whilst the rainfall is regular and considerable. The
highest hopes are, indeed, entertained in regard to these areas, and
much thriving settlement is looked for in the South-Western
?districts. There are nine areas in this locality, comprising 283,618
ucres.
Jandakot Area.
The Jandakot Agricultural Area, which is situated about
twelve miles to the South-East of Perth, and ten miles East from
Fremantle, was open for selection in August, 1890. It comprises
36,000 acres of land, and though a good proportion comprised in
it is of a light sandy nature, yet there is a fair area of good
swampy land and alluvial banks surrounding these swamps; and
these swamps, when once drained, are capable of producing good
?crops of potatoes and garden produce. The land is, however,
somewhat expensive to clear, and some of it would cost quite �lO
an acre in this respect, but on the other hand the productiveness
of the soil, and the consequently small area required, compared
with what is required, say, at Meckering, would compensate for
this fact, whilst there is absolutely no water difficulty, water
being, if anything, too abundant. Portions of this area have
*
a limestone formation, which renders them of especial value.
There is a site for a sewage farm upon the Western side of this
area, and a reserve for a townsite in its South-Eastern corner. It
is approached from Perth by Nicholson Road, which is now being
macadamised, and from Fremantle by the Forrest Road, which
traverses the area, striking the Perth-Bunbury Road at the 14-mile
post. This latter road has lately been cleared about half its width
from end to end. On the Eastern side of the area, and about three
miles from the nearest portion, runs the South-Western Railway
from Perth to Bunbury. An undoubted drawback to the area has
been the comparative lack of good roads leading to or from it, or
serving as feeders to the railway, but works now in progress will,
io a great extent, do away with this objection. Its contiguity to
the Perth and Fremantle markets, and the richness of much of
the land, are still, however, great elements of attraction. The
present settlement is well distributed over the area. There are
.several farms and holdings in a highly improved condition.
. Serpentine Agricultural Area.
This area was opened for selection in April, 1894, and com-
prises 13,980 acres, the whole of which is surveyed into 85 blocks.


This area contained originally a fair quantity of fertile land, a
good proportion of which has now been selected; but, though a
considerable proportion of what is left may be either of light sandy
description or, in other parts, somewhat swampy, there yet re-
mains a good deal of land open for selection that is well suited for
horticulture and fruit growing. It possesses the advantage,
moreover, of being situated along the South-Western Railway, a
distance of only 34 miles from the Perth market.
A townsite has been laid out here, including 112 town and
12 suburban lots.
Coolup Agricultural Area.
This is the Northern portion of what was at first gazetted as
the Harvey Area; it contains 50,000 acres. 217 lots have been
surveyed, including an area of 30,005 acres. It was declared open
for selection in September, 1893. This area is situated alongside
the South-Western Railway, its Northern portion being within two
miles of the Pinjarra Station, which is 54 miles from Perth, and
62 miles from Bunbury. Much of the land in this area is suitable
for the growth of fruit, vegetables, and cereals. The clearing here
would cost about �6 per acre. There is a heavy and regular rain-
fall in this locality.
Harvey Agricultural Area.
The Harvey Area was thrown open for selection in January,
1893; this comprises an area of 43,000 acres. Of this amount
19,803 acres have been surveved into 155 blocks. This area is
' t/
situated about 40 miles from Bunbury, and 76 miles from Perth.
The South-Western Railway runs through its whole length. The
cost of clearing and preparing the soil is somewhat heavy, and a
proportion of it would require draining before it could be brought
under cultivation. The area is situated between Bunbury and
Pinjarra, and will yet be the home of a thriving rural community.
The land here, which is eminently suitable for the growth of fruit
and vegetables, will be greatly improved by a system of drainage,
which has been demonstrated by surveys to be perfectly feasible,
and ere long will be taken in hand by the Government. In this
area the townsites of Drakesbrook and Cookernup have been laid
out, including 129 town and 145 suburban lots.
Uduc Agricultural Area,
This area comprises 12,000 acres, and was thrown open for
selection in August, 1894. Of the total area gazetted 8,415 acres
have been surveyed into 54 lots. It is situate about five miles


South-West from Cookernup townsite on the South-Western Hail-
way, and is about 80 miles from Perth. This land joins l the
Harvey Area. The blocks here could be worked under practically
the same conditions as those described for the Harvey Area. A
large portion in the centre of this area had been taken up before
the land was subdivided. It is probable that much of the vacant
land will very shortly be applied for by settlers who are desirous
of increasing their holdings.
Collie Agricultural Area.
This area, situate about eight miles from Bunbury, is com-
paratively small, but none the less valuable. The whole of the
land within it has now been taken up. It comprises 7,150 acres,
which is surveyed into 61 lots. This area was open for selection
in February, 1892. It is served by both the South-Western
Railway and the extension of the line to Busselton and Donny-
brook. The land here, which is well watered and suitable for the
growth of fruit and vegetables, is about 25 miles from the Collie
River Coalfield.
Boyanup Agricultural Area.
The Boyanup Agricultural Area, about twelve miles from
Bunbury, was thrown open for selection in June, 1892. It contains
40,843 acres, whole of which is surveyed into 284 blocks. It
is served by the line between Bunbury and Donnybrook, which
connects with the South-Western Railway. This area contains
much land well adapted for cereal, fruit, and vegetable growing,
and dairying. The Bunbury-Busselton Railway also runs through
this area.
Preston Agricultural Area.
This area was open for selection in August, 1894, and contains
51,645 acres, the whole of which is surveyed into 228 blocks.
This area is situated about 25 miles from Bunbury, adjacent to
the main road from there to Bridgetown. It is bounded on the
North by the Preston River, which supplies a constant running
stream of fresh water. It includes large tracts of good alluvial
soil, the clearing in places being very heavy. The average cost of
clearing is about �6 per acre. The Donnybrook-Bridgetown
Railway runs through this area. These facilities should lead to
the speedy development of this land, which is specially adapted for
potatoes and other root crops, fruit culture, and dairying; also for
pig breeding. It is well watered by various brooks, and the
rainfall is large and regular.


Tweed Agricultural Area
A
This area was open for selection in March, 1893, and contains
29,000 acres, of which 16,882 are surveyed into 92 blocks. The
area is situated near Bridgetown, which is 10 miles distant along
a good road, and will be the terminus of this branch of the South-
Western Railway when the Donnybrook-Bridgetown Railway,
which is being constructed, is finished. It will be interesting to
learn, in regard to this area, which contains some of the finest
agricultural and fruit-growing land in the Colony, that some of it
was specially selected by the late Mr. Anthony Hordern, originator
of the Great Southern Railway Scheme, as a site for his projected
agricultural college and experimental farms. The land having
been abandoned by his executors, was surveyed and sub-divided
by the Government, and thrown open for selection. The clearing
in many places will be rather heavy, costing probably �6 per acre;
but some of the land is good. There is here splendid alluvial soil,
and a heavy rainfall, whilst the river Blackwood, which contains
large permanent pools of fresh water, runs through the area. This
area is distant from Perth about 175 miles.
AGRICULTURAL AREAS ADJACENT TO THE EASTERN AND
YILGARN RAILWAYS.
Caljie Agricultural Area.
The Caljie area was opened for selection in December, 1892,
and contains 12,500 acres. It is situated about 65 miles from
Perth, and adjoins the Meckering Agricultural Area, and its South-
West corner is only about five miles from the important town of
York, on the Eastern Railway. A settler would require a much
larger area here ?1,000 acres and over ?as most of the land is of
a light sandy and loamy nature. The country is chiefly timbered
with salmon and white gum, and jam; only a small portion of it is
adapted for the growth of cereals. Out of the total area, 11,826
acres are surveyed into 37 blocks. The cost of clearing here
would be about 30s. to 50s. per acre.
Meckering Agricultural Area.
This was the first area to be surveyed and declared open for
selection. It is situated on the Yilgarn Railway Line, about 89
miles from Perth, and about 20 miles to the Eastward of the
flourishing town of Yortham, where an important agricultural
community is located. This area contains 80,760; acres, of which


32,267 acres are already surveyed into 209 blocks suitable for
settlement. Tbe blocks average about 160 acres in extent, and the
land is in many places adapted for the growth of cereals, being
what is known as York gum, salmon gum, and jam country, and
the soil is a light sandy loam, with stiff clay below. It may be
stated that the land would cost on the average about �4 per acre
to clear, although the cost of late has been very much reduced
owing to improved methods of dealing with clearing.
In regard to the extent which would here be amply sufficient
for a settler in the district, a square mile, or 640 acres, is sug-
gested, though, in some places, he could do well with much less.
Of this he might crop, say, 100 acres, plant a few acres as orchard
and garden, reserving the balance for his stock, as in this area an
agriculturist, in order to be successful, must go in for ? mixed
farming,? and must keep some stock if only for the purpose of
manuring the land. In the Meckering Area, although water on
the surface is somewhat scarce, it has frequently been found at a
depth of about 20 feet, and of good quality. The clearing of the
land also increases the supply. Excellent grain, vegetables, and
fruit have been grown by many of the settlers on this area, and
exhibited in Perth. Its contiguity to ISTortham, and the fact that
it is on the highway to the Yilgarn and Coolgardie goldfields,
where there is already a large permanent mining population, are
great encouragements to settlement. Now the prospects of these
goldfields are assured, there will soon be- an immensely increased
number of consumers to be provided for, and it should be possible
to largely supply the wants of the miners with the products of the
Meckering Agricultural Area. Settlement is rapidly increasing-
in the area rendering further surveys necessary.
Tammin Agricultural Area.
This area was gazetted open for selection in September, 1894.
It is situate about 50 miles East of Northam and 117 miles from
Perth, and is intersected by the Northam-Yilgarn railway. It
contains 45,000 acres, of which 3,290 acres have been surveyed into
19 blocks. The country is similar to that in the Bainding Area,
with the same timber as there described. The cost of clearing
would be about �4 per acre. The remarks re clearing in the
Meckering Area apply to this area also. The average rainfall is
14 inches. The soil is capable of producing cereals and fruit.
The only drawback is the limited rainfall. If the settlement now'
proceeding proves that this is sufficient, a large demand will spring


up for land in these districts, on account of the immense require-
ments of the Goldfields to the Eastward.
Since the above was written the demand predicted has set
in, and further surveys are being undertaken.
Doodlakine Agricultural Area.
This area was opened for selection in December, 1894, and
contains 40,000 acres. It is situated about 76 miles from Northam,
- V
and 142 miles from Perth, and adjoins the Northam-Tilgam
railway line. The country is chiefly timbered with salmon gum,
gimlet wood, jam, and here and there mallee and scrub. The soil
is, generally speaking, a light sandy loam, with clay below to a
good depth. Of the total area, 9,765 acres are surveyed into 51
lots, ranging from 160 to 250 acres. The average rainfall on this
area is 13 inches. The cost of clearing here would be about the
same as Meckering Area. A large amount of selection is now
going on in this area.
Bainding Agricultural Area.
This area is situate about 90 miles East of Northam, and 166
miles from Perth; it is along the Yilgarn Railway line. It was
only thrown open for selection in December, 1894. The total area
is 65,000 acres, of which 8,416 are already surveyed into 35 lots,
two of which, containing 350 acres, have been reserved.
This may be described as heavily timbered forest country,,
much of the soil being of a rich, loamy nature, to a good depth,
salmon gum, gimlet wood, and morrell trees being very plentiful.
No surface water is to be found; provision in this way must be
made by dams and tanks until extensive clearing is done, when it is
thought wells may be sunk with success.
It has been found by experience that the cost of clearing lands
timbered by salmon gum, morrell, and gimlet wood is considerably
reduced, owing to the inflammable nature of those timbers. Prom
20s. to 40s. per acre may be taken as the cost of clearing such land.
AGRICULTURAL AREAS ALONG THE MIDLAND RAILWAY.
Koojan Agricultural Area.
This area, which is situate about 100 miles North of Perth,
was opened for selection in November, 1894, and contains 14,000
acres, of which 9,209 acres have been surveyed into 62 blocks.


The Midland Railway line rnns along the Eastern boundary
of this area. A branch of the Moore River rnns through the
Western portion of this area. A large number of selections took
place in this vicinity just previous to the area being gazetted. It
is therefore probable that much land here will be taken up by
persons desirous of increasing their holdings, as well as other new
selectors. This land is suitable for corn growing and fruit culture.
The cost of clearing would be about 40s. to 50s. per acre.
Dalaeoo Agricultural Area.
This area, which is situate North of and adjoining the Koojan
Area was opened for selection in November, 1894. It contains
9,000 acres, of which 3,685 acres are surveyed into 23 blocks. It
adjoins the Western side of the Midland Railway line. A townsite
(Moora) has been laid out in this area, consisting of 89 town and
62 suburban lots. The land here is somewhat similar to that in
the Koojan Area. The average annual rainfall is about 20 inches.
A branch of the Moore River runs through the area; there are also
some small swamps suitable for gardening purposes.
AGRICULTURAL AREAS ADJACENT TO THE GERALDTON-
NORTHAMPTON RAILWAY.
Appertarra Agricultural Area.
This area was thrown open for selection in April, 1894, and
comprises 6,560 acres, the whole of which has been surveyed into
43 Tots. The area is situate close to Northampton townsite,
adjoining the West boundary of same, and extending North there-
from. The land here is of a light loamy nature, and should prove
suitable for the growth of cereals and fruit. The cost of clearing
would be about 40s. per acre, as the land is not heavily timbered.
As there is a revival in the mining industry at Northampton,
selection in this area is anticipated at an early date. The
Northampton- Geraldton Railway passes through the Southern
portion of this area.
Nonga Agricultural Area.
This area contains 11,311 acres, and was thrown open for
selection in September, 1893. It has been entirely sub-divided into


74 blocks. 4 here is a fair amount of good soil in this area, which
has a frontage on the Bowes River and Nokanena Brook. The
proximity of this area to the Northampton-Geraldton Railway line
should lead to its early settlement. The cost of clearing here
would be about 60s. per acre.
AGRICULTURAL AREA ALONG THE GERALDTON-MURCHISON
RAILWAY.
A! ullewa Agricultural Area.
This area contains 12,000 acres, and was thrown open for
selection in August, 1894. Of the total area gazetted, 6,104 acres
have been surveyed into 54 lots. A townsite has been laid out
heie, comprising 93 town and suburban lots. This area is situate
near Mullewa, about 65 miles from Geraldton, on the Geraldton-
v-'Ue Railway line. The land here should soon be in demand,
and though the rainfall in some seasons is somewhat uncertain and
-scanty it is considered suitable for the growth of cereals. The
cost of clearing would be about �3 per acre.
