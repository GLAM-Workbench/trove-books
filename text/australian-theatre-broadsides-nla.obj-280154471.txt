PLEASE LISTEN TO MISS PHYLLIS GREEN!!
Miss Phyllis M. Green —a charmingly pretty young lady—residing at 34 Bay
Street, Glebe, Sydney, forwards the following interesting and unsolicited letter to the
Dr. Williams’ Medicine Company, Sydney :
“ Dear Sirs—Some twelve months ago I suffered
very much with pains in my head and chest. I was
attended constantly by a very clever doctor., I took
his medicine until I was tired of it, and tried
several other supposed remedies, but I gradually
got worse. I could not eat. I became so weak
and pale that if I tried to sweep the floor I would
have to sit down several times before'l could finish.
It was a troub’e for me to do anything. If I walked
upstairs, I would have to sit down when I got to
the top. I had not the least color in my face or
body ; people used to say I was going into a decline.
Mother advised me to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People. She said I was very pale, and
they might do me good; so I bought some, and two
or three doses improved me wonderfully. In all I
took four boxes, [and I am now a different [girl
altogether. I have such a nice; rosy complexion,
and am strong and healthy, and can do any work
easily. The people who know me ask what I took
to make such a wonderful change in me, and I tell
them ‘Dr. William’s Pink Pills.’ I will always
sound their praise. lam a really good advertise-
ment for your pills, both in town and country, for I went up the country for a change
for nine weeks, but I came back worse. Since April, when I started to take Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills, I have never been a day ill, and now I am the picture of health,
thanks to your pills. I feel it my duty to write and thank you. I will always
remember you for saving my life.—Yours very sincerely, PHYLLIS M. GREEN.’
Dr. Williams’ HnkPills also curs Indigestion,
Summer Headaches, Kidney Troubles, lung 1 and Chest Complaints, Con-
sumption, Crave!, Weak Heart, Sciatica, General Debility, Nervous

It is calculated that the aggregat

United Kingdom is about £300,000,000.
Du Maurier was a thorough worshipper
of beauty, as one can see from “ Trilby.”
The splendid specimens of womanhood
he used to sketch in Punch also show
this. He was no admirer of delicacy, but
loved to see well-developed frames. His
ohief models were his wife and daughters.
Uncle Silas (in art gallery) : “ Giminy
crockets, Maria, but them artists is old
fellers ! ” Aunt Maria : “ How do you
kuow ? ” Uncle Silas : “ Why, look at
that air picter. It’s signed ‘ Jones, ’97.’”
“This is an insult,” declared the
prisoner in the police court. “ What do
you mean, sir,” roared the magistrate.
“ I’m a professional cyclist, holding
several long-distance records, your honor,
and here I’m charged with scorching at
the rate of eight miles an hour.’
A calculator has summed up that Eu-
rope has expended £5,200,000,000 during
the past twenty-five years for the osten-
sible pui’pose of maintaining peace- He
has also examined the account of the
money that has been expended in great
wars for the same period, and has dis-
covered that the sum total is far exceeded
by that which has been expended in the
cause of peace.
“ Knocked into a cocked hat ” is
symbolical of the ease with which this
article, especially when old, assumes
almost any shape.
Teacher—“ Where do the Arabs live t "
Boy —“In the desert.” Teacher—“ What
do they call those pious men who flee to
the desert ? ” Boy—“ Deserters.”
Scribbler —“ Y es, I have written a large
number of poems, but I do not propose
having them published until after my
death.” Chorus of friends (raising their
glasses) “ Here’s long life to you,
Scribbler.”
Her Mother—“ Edith, don’t you think
you are getting too old to play with little
boys?” Edith (aged seven) —“No,
mamma; the older I get the better I like
them.”
“ Do you hear that whininj? in the next
room ? ” “ Yes ; who is it ? ” “ That’s
the football rusher who got off those
manly utterances at the end of the game ;
his wife is rubbing his lame shoulder.”
A man recently drank a pint of yeast
in mistake for buttermilk. lie rose three
hours earlier than usual next morning.
He —“Just think of it. They say
man descended from a monkey.” She—
“jA come down, indeed.”
At the Party. —Mr. Boresley (amateur
hypnotist) —“Now, Miss Spicer, I want
you for a moment to concentrate your
mind upon absolutely nothing.” Miss
Spicer —“Would it make much difference
if I concentrated it upon you, Mr.
Boresley ? ”
Waiting for change is a terrible nuisance, bn
with the conveniences at ANTHONY HOR-
DERN’S this unpleasantness immediately
disappears.
Encouragement. —Her Papa —“Has
my daughter given you any encourage-
ment, sir 1 ” Mr. Loveday—“Well —er
—yes. She said you were an awfully
generous parent.”
Boy or Girl ? —Wife (reading a letter
from a distant friend) —“ How strange
Elfrida doesn’t say whether her baby is
a boy or girl. Bat she states it’s already
beginning, to talk.” Husband —“Oh,
well, ihat decides it; it’s a girl, of course.”
Culture is dangerous when it roaches
the point of taking a woman’s mind off
the thing she has in the oven.
Lost Child (to policeman)—“ Please,
sir, have you seen a man without a little
boy? ’Cause if you Lave, Ps that litil
boy.”
Fishmonger (to thrifty housewife)
“ Fish is dear, mum. Hit’s a-gettin’ werry
scarce in consekence o’ these ’ere aque-
riums.”
An impecunious Irishman said he liked
being asked out to dinner because it was
flattering and nourishing.
A country clergyman recently officiated
for a brother clergyman. Being anxious
to know what impression he had made
be asked the clerk : “Was my discourse
too long?” “No; but it was long
enough,” “ I am glad of that; for to
tell you the truth, the other day, as I
was getting this sermon ready, my dog
destroyed four or five pages, and, clerk,
that made it much shorter.” “ Oh, sir,”
said the clerk, “ could you let our vicar
have a pup o’ that ’ere dog ? ”
Reserved. —Lawyer—“ I must know
the whole truth before I can successfully
defend you. Have you told me every-
thing?” Prisoner—“ Except where I
hid the money. I want that for myself.”
The poet enters timidly. “ Here are
a few verses, Mr. Editor,” he says defer-
entially. The barbarian, without 1 '-* 1 iug
up, says, “Please throw the'- <he
basket, yourself—l haven’t i. . j-isfc

Truthful Tommy. —Mr. Cumso —“ This
is a very bad report to bring me from
school, Tommy.” Tommy—“ I know,
papa ; but you said if Pd bring you a
good report you’d give me half-a-crown,
and I wanted to save your money.”
Family friend: “I congratulate you,
my dear sir, on the marriage of your
daughter. I see you are gradually getting

branch : “ Off my hands—yes ; but the

Medical men and scientists just now are
concerning themselves much about the health
of women and growing girls, and there cannot
be any doubt a vast amount of good has been
done in awakening a general interest in the
subject. The great truth has been forced ea
all concerned, that our race cannot progress
unless our women folks are sound, healthy and
strong. All writers agree that most of the
reform required for women lies in the question
of dress, and of all articles of attire required
the Corset is believed to be the most important.
Many medical men are of the opinion that
the Corset either builds up or interferes wuth
the health of women. Science has come direct
to the relief of women on this essential of dress,
the outcome of which is the French P.D.
Corset
These Corsets are a scientific perfection,
1 hey not only give an elegant shape to the form
by holding it well together, but, being so flexible,
they conform to every movement of the figure,
thus giving support and the truest sense of
comfort and ease. By wearing a French P.D.
Corset a lady no longer feels cramped within or
without, the free circulation of the blood is not
impeded nor the figure distorted.
