INTRODUCTION
In presenting this book to the ex-members of the 27th
Battalion and to the general public, the compilers have in
view the production of a history which will inscribe upon the
scroll of fame the splendid and self-sacrificing part played
by the members of the Battalion in the great world-war of
1914-1918. Every unit that left Australia helped to im-
mortalize Australia’s fair name, and the deeds of her sons
must inevitably be recorded in any published history of the
War. The object of the book is to give prominence to the
life and action of the Battalion from its inception until its
disbandment, and while at times other units must necessarily
be referred to, it will be merely to assist in the portrayal of
the Battalion’s engagements.
Space has been reserved in the front of the book for
the insertion of a photograph and particulars of service of a
member of the Battalion. It is felt that where this provision
is availed of the book will have an added value and signifi-
cance to those personally interested in the member.
It is a matter of especial interest to record that the book
is published by the 27th Battalion Club, the details of publi-
cation being left to a History Sub-Committee. The narration
of the history from the inception of the Battalion in 1915 to
August, 1916, is by Lieut.-Colonel Dollman, and is continued
from that date by Sgt. Skinner. With the exception of one
or two minor details, the work of printing the book has been
done entirely by ex-members of the Battalion.

FOREWORDS
I.
Nothing could be more praiseworthy than the efforts which are
being made to record the achievements of units of the Australian
Imperial Force. That Force established the foundations upon which
Australia’s national character is building. The detailed histories of
its units are something more than recountals of stirring incidents.
They possess a spirit of incalculable value. That spirit is the very
soul of the traditions which for all time will stir the hearts of Austra-
lians to patriotism and unselfishness.
I am extremely glad, therefore, to usher forth by this brief fore-
word the history of the 27th Battalion. Australia is proud of the
27th Battalion, and because that Battalion nobly served the Empire
and Australia the State from whence it was drawn may be justifiably
gratified.
There are many points in the history of the 27th that incite more
than a passing interest. Raised in March, 1515, it sailed for Egypt
at the end of May of that year as one of the four splendid Battalions
of the 7th Infantry Brigade. In Egypt, all too quickly from the
point of view of time for preparation, it became part of the 2nd Aus-
tralian Division. I say all too quickly advisedly. There is unfor-
tunately a prevalent notion that an assembly of men can with little
or no training be safely thrown into battle. To a nation relying
upon its citizens for its military protection this is a fatal misconcep-
tion. It is true, lam prepared to assert, that the Australian citizen
can be more quickly trained than any other personnel with which I
am acquainted. But the very fact argues a need for the utmost
husbanding of such personnel, and one sure way of husbanding such
valuable resources is by ensuring their training to a fixed standard
before employing them in battle.
But that is a digression. Whilst in Egypt the 27th Battalion
made full use of time and facilities for training. In consequence
when it arrived in Gallipoli in September, 1915, it was able to give a
good account of itself. At Gallipoli it quickly became saturated with
the indomitable spirit which Australia had established there. And
with Australian steadfastness it remained at Gallipoli until the evacua-
tion.
In March, 1916, the 27th Battalion was transferred to France, and
had the proud distinction of being one of the first Australian units


to confront the might of Germany. From that time until the ter-
mination of hostilities the 27th was to the fore in all encounters of
importance, and its number was registered in German intelligence
diaries as one of Australia’s invincible battalions.
It is vrell that we should proudly remember the achievements of
our soldiers. But more than remembrance is required of us. Their
devotion to duty and their sacrifices call urgently to us for action.
We must complete the task which they began. I hope that this
little history will ever be a reminder of our responsibilities. It was
the co-operative spirit of the 27th Battalion which made it uncon-
querable in battle. To achieve its aims and to maintain that spirit
its members shrank from no sacrifice. In shouldering our future
responsibilities, sacrifice, both individual and national, will be demand-
ed of us. But the sacrifices of peace are small compared with those
demanded by war. With the example which this history, and so
many other records, place before us, can Australia fail to achieve
greatness cr fall short in a high standard of national character? I
think not.

You have asked me to write some sort of an Introduction to the
“History of the 27th Battalion,” which you are having published. As
I know from personal contact and knowledge what the “27th” was,
and what it did, that is from the time I took command of the Brigade;
and whatever may have happened before that time, I can confidently
say that from, then on the “27th” never failed me.
To a Brigadier who had a Brigade composed of men of four dif-
ferent States, it is difficult to specially praise the men of one of these,
and, further, it can’t be done! When all is said, it will be agreed
that there is little difference in the men of the several States. All
were just splendid, some Divisions, some Brigades, and some Batta-
lions had better opportunities than others, and therefore better re-
cords, but as far as the quality of the officers, non-commissioned
officers and men was concerned, there was little difference.
As regards the “27th” particularly, it has a record second to none
in the A.1.F., and, of course, that is in my humble opinion, better
than that of any other Battalion in any other Force engaged in
the Great Adventure. While I write, my mind rushes from
one great incident to another; I think of Malt Trench, that wonder-
ful bomb fight of the “27th.” LAGNICOURT, where you held up
the counter-attack. BULLECOURT, where you held the exposed
flank for fourteen days. MENIN ROAD, BROODSEINDE


RIDGE, PASSCHENBAELE, VILLERS BRETONNEUX, THE
GREAT ADVANCE! That determined rush at BIACHES, MONT
ST. QUENTIN RIDGE, BEAUREVOIR, and many minor stunts,
and I cannot, think of one of these occasions where the “Good old
27th” did not cover itself with glory.
It is a splendid thing to publish this book. It is only just and
right and proper it should be done. It is just to the members of
the Battalion and to your State that their great achievement should
be recorded and become more than mere tradition. It is right and
proper that those who come after should know what these hardy
fighting men of the past have done, and how much they owe to their
patriotism, bravery, and stubbornness. It is right and proper that
the example of these men should be retained before the youth of
future generations for their emulation. It is right and proper that
the fame and glory of these achievements should be held by future
generations as a proud heritage, inspiring them to a similar spirit of
patriotism and splendid self-sacrifice for Liberty, Home, and Country.
Your book -will do this! I can imagine Paterfamilias, late Private
in the “Gallant 27th,” on being asked, “What did you do in the Great
War, Daddy?” blushing modestly as he says “Hand me down THE
BOOK, Mum,” and thrilling with pride as he expounds its pages to
his wondering offspring. Every man of the “27th” can be proud of
this book, because it is a faithful record of a gallant Battalion. A
magnificent, brave, hard-fighting, and hard-living Battalion. For
those who have lost dear ones the book will be a source of con-
solation. It will give them pride in the achievements of their lost
ones, which will, lam sure, temper their sorrow. It will help them
to realise the great part their dear ones took in the great struggle for
“the liberty of the world,” “the preservation of the nationality of
Australia,” and “the sanctity of their homes. . . .” Those who
died won all these great essentials to our happiness by their sacrifice,
and when we consider conquered BELGIUM and FRANCE as we
saw them, and knowing the manner of the enemy as we knew it,
we must surely agree that the sacrifice was worth while. For all
the above reasons I am glad indeed that this book is to be published.
I commend it not only to the late members of the Battalion, but to
the public generally, who should be equally proud with yourselves
of the record of the Battalion. I wish it every success!

CHAPTER I.
ORGANIZATION AND EMBARKATION.
It was in February, 1915, that the Australian Government
offered the Imperial Authorities two further Infantry
Brigades, the Fifth and Sixth, and the offer was accepted.
The Sixth Brigade included the 24th Battalion, which was to
be raised in South and Western Australia, with Headquarters
from South Australia. On March 16th, Lieutenant-Colonel
Dollman, V.D., was appointed to command, and at once
organized A and B Companies from the troops at that time
encamped at Ascot Park, then the main training camp
in South Australia, the formation of C and D Companies being
entrusted to Major Wisdom, in Western Australia. Before
organization was completed, however, the offer and accept-
ance of another Brigade caused a change in allotment, the 24th
Battalion being raised by Victoria and the troops allotted to
that unit in South and Western Australia were diverted to
the 7th Brigade, the South Australians forming the nucleus
for the 27th Battalion and the West Australians for the 28th
Battalion. The constitution of the new Brigade was as
follows:
25th Battalion, Queensland.
26th Battalion, 2 Companies, Queensland.
2 Companies, Tasmania.
27th Battalion, South Australia.
28th Battalion, Western Australia.
No time was lost in completing the full Battalion from
the men at Ascot Park, and on April Ist the unit marched to
the site of the now historic Mitcham Camp, which site was
retained until the cessation of hostilities as the main training
area for the Australian Imperial Forces in South Australia.


The inconveniences and discomforts of those early days
of camp life were in marked contrast to the advantages and
recreative opportunities of later times, to say nothing of the
lack of hygienic and sanitary precautions, the provision of
which, at a later date, made the Camp at Mitcham a model
for the Commonwealth. Despite the dust of the first few
weeks and the mud of later days, very great pride was taken
in the Battalion quarters. All ranks were accommodated in
the old-fashioned and now discarded “bell” tents, and set
themselves with cheerfulness and thoroughness to make
themselves as cosy as possible. The necessary physical and
disciplinary training was carried out with all celerity, and it
was not long before the unit was sufficiently trained for
embarkation. In equipping the troops, much difficulty was
experienced owing to shortage of supplies, and when, shortly
before embarkation, the requisite quantities were available,
the Quartermaster’s branch was kept busy, early and late,
receiving and issuing clothing, arms, and equipment.
It is encouraging to record that many of the business
men of Adelaide were very liberal with gifts of goods and
luxuries for the troops. Besides gifts for the comfort of the
men collectively and individually, many articles for the use
of the Battalion generally were received. Among other
presentations were a typewriter from Messrs. Colton, Palmer
and Preston, and a large clock from Mr. H. Heylen (himself
an old soldier). This clock, as all the old members of the
Battalion will recollect, travelled with the unit until July,
1916, when it was packed, with other regimental impedimenta,
and sent across to England. It was set up in each of our train-
ing camps, and recorded Regimental time on Gallipoli, and
later in France.
The newly-formed Cheer Up Society in Adelaide, founded
to give cheer to local and visiting soldiers, made the comfort
of the men in camp their particular care, and were responsible
for countless acts of kindness and forethought which went
far to relieve the monotony and tedium of life under canvas.
Early in the month of May, the Battalion and other allotted
troops in camp were invited by the Society to a luncheon in
the Jubilee Exhibition Building, Adelaide, and they marched
to the city via Unley through gaily decorated streets lined
with cheering and enthusiastic crowds. A very fine display
was made at the Unley City Hall. When the troops arrived
at the Jubilee Exhibition Building they were at once seated

at bountifully supplied and decorated tables, where, to the
accompaniment of fervent patriotic addresses the good things
of life were freely partaken of, and the men showed their
appreciation in the most striking manner. This day lives in
the memory of the original Battalion survivors, and was a
striking and fitting encouragement for them on the eve of
their embarkation.
A matter worthy of mention occurred at a farewell
gathering about this time, when Lieut.-Col. Dollman, speak-
ing on behalf of the Battalion, made some comparison between
the men of the first contingent and those then preparing for
embarkation. In effect he said: “The memorable landing on
Gallipoli has been made, the first casualty lists have been
published, and the men of the 27th fully recognized that the
task before them is a ‘dinkum soldiers’ job.’ ” The term stuck.
The 27th Battalion became the “Dinkums,” and the expression
spread first to the Brigade, then to the Division, and later to
the whole Australian Army. After the evacuation of Galli-
poli General Birdwood sent for the C. 0., and was much inter-
ested in learning how the term had originated.
It was early ascertained that a great number of the men
allotted to the Battalion were from the suburban City of
Unley, and in recognition of this fact the 27th was adopted
as “Unley’s Own.” The then Mayor (Mr. T. E. Yelland)
and a number of enthusiastic citizens organized a splendid
farewell gathering, which was held in the City Hall on May
12th. His Excellency the Governor (Sir Henry Galway)
attended, and after the Mayor and others had given fervent
addresses, His Excellency, with an inspiring address, pre-
sented a pair of binoculars to Colonel Dollman on behalf of
the citizens. Miss Dollman then made presentations to each
of the Unley boys in the Battalion, and response on their
behalf was made by the Commanding Officer. Sir Henry
Galway visited the Battalion in camp at Mitcham, and
reviewed the men on parade, after which, on behalf of Mrs.
A. G. Miller, he presented a beautiful flag to the unit. His
Excellency afterwards lunched with the officers.
So the time sped away till orders were received to embark.
The early morning of May 31st found the Battalion in the
bustle of preparation for their first real move as an organized
unit. The principal stores and equipment had already been
taken on board, and when final inspections were over the
troops were entrained from Mitcham on two special trains.


Upon arrival at the Outer Harbor, where the troopship
Geelong, officially registered as A 2, was lying, a very great
crowd of friends was found already assembled to bid the lads
“Good-bye.” Very little time was lost in embarking the
battalion. The regimental band was mustered on the upper
deck, and, until the transport sailed, enlivened the proceedings
with a fine programme of music. Amid the greatest enthu-
siasm from soldiers and civilians alike the transport slowly
swung out from the wharf, while fluttering ribbons and waving
flags evidenced the deep sentiment of affection which charac-
terized the parting. And so they sailed, these men of the
Twenty-Seventh Battalion, bound overseas to take their part
in the mighty conflict between nations, leaving behind sor-
rowing but brave hearts to bear the suspense of separation,
and to pray for the safe return of their dear ones. Slowly the
troopship leaves the wharf, the long streaming ribbons grow
taut and snap, the band plays farewell music, to those on
board the cheering grows faint, the groups of watching figures
on the wharf merge into one another, and the home-land fades
from sight.
The great majority of the men were unused to sea life, and
found troopship conditions uncomfortable in the extreme, but
with a ready will and buoyant spirit soon set themselves to
overcome the monotony of the voyage. A certain amount of
physical exercise was possible, and regular instructional
parades were held, sports and concert committees worked
hard with excellent results, and after leaving Western Aus-
tralia, where other troops were embarked, everybody had
settled down to the novel surroundings. As usual with troop-
ship sailings, our course and destination were unknown, but
it was generally surmised that our destination was Egypt en
route to Gallipoli.
From Western Australia our course lay direct to Suez,
and for a few days our ship was buffeted and tossed under the
influence of monsoons, but as we neared the equatorial waters
better conditions prevailed, and life on board passed smoothly
enough.
We all remember how our troopship wallowed and rolled
on the slightest provocation, and having in memory now the
better conditions of transports on which we afterwards sailed,
it is but natural that we think the fare and accommodation on
the “Geelong” was very poor in comparison.


An incident which occasioned much sorrow on board
was the passing away of our comrade W. A. Graham, of Ham-
ley Bridge, who died on board and was buried at sea. He was
the first of our lads to answer the roll call for the “Other
World,” and his death was deeply mourned. On the night
following his death, at about ten o’clock, the officers assembled
in the stern of the ship, and in the absence of a Protestant
Chaplain, Colonel Dollman read the burial service, and the
body was committed to the deep. Then in the impressive
stillness of the starlit night, the silence deepened by the fact
that the monotonous throbbing of the engines had ceased, the
body was gently and tenderly given to the waves. A minute’s
solemn silence, and then “full steam ahead,” and we left our
“soldier pal” to his rest.
When passing Aden, at the entrance to the Red Sea, news
was received by wireless of a native rising against the garrison
there, and although the possibility of our landing was dis-
cussed, our services were not requisitioned. A day or two
later, in the early morning, wireless calls reached us from a
vessel in distress. A dusty haze from the African shore made
visibility difficult, but soon after daylight we sighted a
British-Indian ship aground upon one of the many islands
which abound thereabouts. The “Geelong” stopped, and the
stranded ship put off a boat, and some of her officers came
on board. Our captain undertook to stand by and afford what
relief he could, but the arrival of a collier and almost simul-
taneously a wireless message from Aden that a rescue ship
had been dispatched, enabled us to continue our voyage
towards Suez, leaving the collier to stand guard. Suez was
sighted on July 5, and the next morning instructions reached
us to disembark and proceed by train to Cairo. While lying
at the wharf we saw the troopship “Ballarat” leave for Aus-
tralia with the first batch of wounded men from Gallipoli.


CHAPTER II.
IN EGYPT.
We travelled from Suez to Heliopolis in three special
trains, the last one arriving in the early hours of the morning.
Our first camp was on the outskirts of the city, and was known
as the Aerodrome Camp. Here the 27th was attached tem-
porarily to the Sth Brigade, the other battalions of the 7th
Brigade having been isolated on account of an outbreak of
measles while on the voyage. Our accommodation was very
comfortable, the sleeping quarters being airy tents, and dining
and recreation huts being provided. Plenty of shower baths
were available, and as an issue of tropical clothing was made,
the troops very soon adapted themselves to the new conditions.
Reveille was at 4 o’clock daily, and training was carried on
till 8 o’clock, and after breakfast theoretical training occupied
the time between 10 o’clock and noon. At four in the afternoon
training recommenced and continued until seven. Limited
evening leave was given, and each week-end a liberal propor-
tion were given freedom on the Saturday and Sunday
afternoons.
About a fortnight after our arrival we moved camp to
Abbasia and joined the other units of the brigade. A detailed
programme of work was carried out, including trench digging,
night marches, and attack and defence practices.
Among the duties which fell to the lot of the battalion was
that of garrisoning the Kasr-el-Nil Barracks at Cairo and
supplying a town picquet and several guards. This work was
very well done and gained commendation from the Imperial
authorities.
Several instructional courses were held for the benefit
of officers and non-commissioned officers. These, together with
the hearty and enthusiastic interest shown by the rank and
file in the various branches of training, soon brought the
battalion to a high state of efficiency.


After a period of two months in Egypt, instructions were
received to prepare for embarkation for Gallipoli, and
immediate steps were taken to completely overhaul all equip-
ment, and make good any deficiencies.
On the night of September 3, 1915, we boarded trains for
Alexandria, and next morning embarked on the Cunard liner
“Ivernia” in company with the 28th Battalion. This was our
first experience of voyaging in submarine-infested waters, and
stringent precautions were taken for the safety of all on
board. Lifebelts were worn day and night, submarine guards
mounted and no lights permitted after dark. We reached
Lemnos on September 9, and anchored in Mudros Harbour
until the 12th, on which day the whole of the 7th Brigade was
transhipped to smaller vessels and made ready for the landing
on Gallipoli.


CHAPTER III.
ON GALLIPOLI.
We left Lemnos between 5 and 6 o’clock in the evening
of September 12, 1915, and watched the daylight fade away,
with mixed feelings, because we knew that before the sun rose
again we would be on the shores of that peninsula where so
many of our brave compatriots had fought and fallen. Night
fell, and presently booming over the darkened sea came the
sound of gunfire. To many of us the sound of guns firing in
anger was new, and when we saw the dull flashes on the
horizon and the sweeping rays of a'searchlight from a battle-
ship, we realised that our goal was near at hand. Soon the
rattle of musketry could be heard and the dim outlines of the
shore became visible. Dropping anchor, we waited until a
barge towed by a tug came silently alongside. Into the barge
about half our troops were packed, and we pushed off. As we
drew nearer to the shore the sound of rifle bullets striking the
water about us added to the realism, and the sound of shell-
fire grew louder. About midway between the ship and shore
our barge parted company with the tug, and we drifted help-
lessly until the fussy tug picked us up again, and eventually
deposited us at the few piles and planks which comprised the
landing place. Here a guide awaited us, and we were told
to get the battalion together as soon as possible and march
along the shore to a bivouac ground to be pointed out. This it
was necessary to do during darkness, as most of the beach
was in full view of the enemy trenches during the day. We
trudged along, for the most part in sand, until, to our infinite
relief, we turned into a place known as Taylor’s Hollow, where
a New Zealand battery had its quarters. There was little of
darkness left when our men, tired and weary, threw themselves
down, but nevertheless at earliest dawn some of them were
afoot reconnoitring their new surroundings. Having reported
to General Godley, who was in command of the New Zealand
and Australian Division to which unit our brigade had been


attached, our C.O. received instructions to visit the trenches
held by the New Zealand Mounted Rifle Brigade and a New
Zealand Infantry Brigade. This Col. Dollman and several
of the company officers of the battalion did during the after-
noon, and, later, instructions were received to move the bat-
talion up during the night and take over the trenches from the
New Zealand troops on which was called Cheshire Ridge.
During that night, the 13th of September, we slowly and
silently took over and commenced our garrison duty on Gal-
lipoli. Our trench, which was poorly constructed having
been established by the New Zealand troops, who were weak-
ened both in numbers and physique ov/ing to continuous and
arduous service ran along the top of a ridge and was distant
from the enemy about eighty to four hundred yards. The ridge
was high, and afforded a splendid view of Suvla Bay, the Salt
Lake, and Anafarta, also the “W” Hills position, and we could
see enemy troops out of range of our own fire. Our immediate
enemy concern was a position held in what once had been a
farm, but was now battered beyond all recognition.. Enemy
trenches, however, had been made and strengthened, and
offered a continuous menace to our lines. It was soon recog-
nised that our trenches could be much improved, and we
constructed splendid forward fire positions, which gave better
and more effective command over the enemy. In this regard
the men under Major Slane, Captains Chalmers, Blacket, Dey,
and Malpas, and, later, Major Cunningham, did excellent
work. It was in carrying out some constructional work that
Captain j. W. Blacket was wounded. This officer had been
adjutant of the Battalion until our arrival at Lemnos, when,
as Major Padman was found medically unfit to proceed,
Captain Blacket was appointed to command C Company,
Lieut. Pearce being appointed adjutant.
It was found desirable to send nightly patrols between
our own and the Turkish lines, and on one of these Lieut.
Pearce, who was sent out as leader, was badly bombed and
two or three men with him were killed or wounded. Quite a
number of bodies, both of friend and foe, were lying on No
Man’s Land, and many of these were buried at night by the
chaplain (Captain W. J. Stevens). At the time of our first
arrival on Gallipoli, the summer weather conditions still pre-
vailed, and by reason of shortage of water, the prevalence of
flies, and the number of unburied dead, the amount of sickness
(principally enteric, para typhoid, and jaundice) was very
great. The water and supplies for the use of the men in the


trenches were conveyed per medium of mules, under the
control of an Indian corps. These animals were well cared for
and proved most reliable and trusty in their work, although
they possessed the amiable trait of kicking at unexpected
times and without provocation, as several of our men will
readily testify. Our “dump” was at the foot of the hill below
the lines, and Captain Uffindell, with his efficient staff, kept the
supplies at high-water mark. There were times, however,
when the water-barges failed, and our ration of water for all
purposes was but a thimbleful. Occasionally it was found
possible to allow a platoon at a time as far as the beach for a
bathe, where the diggers sported in the waves, in spite of
the shrapnel Johnny Turk sent after them. At times, especially
after rain, the steep road from the beach was impassable even
for mules, and on such occasions parties had to be sent from
the men in the reserve to act as beasts of burden and bring
our supplies to the firing line.
To reach the lines held by our Battalion from the beach it
was necessary to traverse the Chalak Dere, a deep gully which
in places was exposed to the full view of the enemy, and work-
ing parties were usually fired upon, principally by machine
guns. Our lines were well within bombing range, and a lot of
casualties resulted from this cause, while some very narrow
escapes were experienced. A very great amount of ingenuity
was displayed in making shelters, and the provision of suitable
winter quarters was proceeding when “our relief” arrived on
November 12. We marched out by platoons at intervals, and
although badly shot at on the way to the beach, suffered no
casualties. While on duty at Cheshire Ridge we had several
visits from Generals Sir lan Hamilton, Sir W. R. Birdwood,
Sir C. B. B. White, Sir A. Godley, and other distinguished
officers, who complimented the Battalion highly upon the
excellent work accomplished.
Our next post was on a place known as Wellington
Plateau, in support to Russell’s Top and Walker’s Ridge, in
which position we assisted the garrison and provided strong
mining fatigue. Here our position was on a narrow ledge
(called by our regimental officers Chamois Ledge) overlooking
a deep gully, along the sides of which shelters had been cut
for the transport mules while off duty. Our men were set to
terrace the slope and to make shelters in the solid earth of the
hill. Owing to the absence of timber or revetting material the
task was heartbreaking, but nevertheless was well carried out,


and several adequate shelters constructed, the principal diffi-
culty experienced being to overcome the reluctance of the men
to sleep in them.
It was while we were holding this position that Lord
Kitchener visited Gallipoli, and his tour of inspection took him
through our Battalion lines. During November a very trying
snow blizzard was experienced, which caused a lot of sickness
among all Australian units.
Our next move was to a gully known as Happy Valley,
and from this position we supplied beach fatigues and working
parties for some days. Then came definite news of the intention
to evacuate the Peninsula, and we supplied the men necessary
to transport vast quantities of stores as well as troops to
waiting troopships, which came silently out of the distance
each night after darkness had set in. We removed our
quarters to the beach camp and could see, from day to day,
the garrison grow less in numbers. On Dec. 12 word came
that it was our turn to leave, and the 27th Battalion, with the
26th and 28th, embarked on barges that night.
Even at the time we write, it is difficult to understand
how our troops could so completely disengage themselves
without the knowledge of the enemy. For some weeks, it is
true, there had been periods of silence during which no rifle
fire came from our lines, and the enemy doubtless thought
nothing of the silence which ensued upon the departure of
the troops until accident or design revealed the emptiness of
our trenches.
The vessel that bore us away was the “Osmania,” and
our feelings may easily be imagined as she slowly gained way
and left behind the shore of Gallipoli. Relief at our personal
safety, regret at the failure of the enterprise, and deep-seated
sorrow that so many brave and gallant comrades had fallen
by the way, and that we were leaving their graves in our
enemy’s hand. With hats off we stood while the dim and
distant shore slowly receded from sight, and in a few hours a
new day dawned as we made our way into Mudros Harbour
once more, and made ready to land. This was accomplished
by midday, and we marched to a camp site known as Sarpi,
were we rested for the night.
The casualties sustained by the Battalion on Gallipoli
were not heavy if those caused through sickness are excepted,


but naturally the death of those smitten thus early was felt
more keenly than later, when the more heavy toll fell upon us.
Captain J. W. Biaeket was the first officer wounded in action,
and of other ranks the first wounded was Private A. J. Potter,
and the first to die of wounds, Sergeant R. R. Poyntz.
The death of Stretcher-bearers Cairns and Caseldine, who
were both killed while assisting a wounded comrade, was
particularly regrettable, both these fine lads having won a
high reputation for soldierly qualities. The last casualty before
leaving the Peninsula was probably that of Sergeant Rofe, who
was hit by a shell fragment, which he carefully preserved as a
souvenir.. The total casualties sustained on the Peninsula
were: Killed, 10; wounded, 65; evacuated sick, 587.

CHAPTER IV.
EGYPT ONCE MORE.
It was rather a strange experience to be once more under
canvas in battalion formation, and to have a full night’s rest
without interruption. We missed the incessant crack of the
Turkish machine guns that had been a feature of every night
on the Peninsula, and on the morning of Dec. 14 we woke
to a beautiful day, with water and rations in abundance.
About midday on Dec. 16 we marched to No. 2 Camp,
overlooking the entrance to the harbour, and here the whole
of the 7th Brigade was eventually quartered. The country-
side was strewn with stones, which made any military move-
ment off the roads a very difficult matter, and it was necessary
for us to clear not only our sleeping quarters, but also an area
large enough for battalion parades.
The Christmas of 1915 was spent in our new quarters,
and as an excellent British army canteen was nearby, the
usual liquid adjuncts for a festive season were obtained and
enjoyed. The ration issue included Christmas pudding in tins,
and every man had an adequate supply of this Christmas
“luxury,” for such it seemed after the privation experienced
on the Peninsula.
On Christmas Eve much excitement was created by the
distribution of billycans sent by the good folk at home. These
typical Australian utensils were filled with gifts of value and
utility. No two were alike. Surely no children ever searched
their stockings, after the visit of Santa Claus, with greater
delight than did the boys examine the contents of their billy-
cans. It was a glorious thought on the part of the home folks,
and brought from Australia a very dear intimation of kindly
love. During the Christmas period each battalion in turn
supplied the programme for a campfire concert, and as much
leave as possible was granted to enable the troops to visit the


towns and villages on the island. These explorations, which
were of great interest to the troops, to whom the sights and
customs of the natives had not yet become irksome, inciden-
tally meant a much increased and lucrative business for the
local inhabitants. A few miles from the camp was a hot spring,
and here the natives had arranged “hot baths,” which, although
primitive in character, were nevertheless well patronised.
On the Bth of January, 1916, the 27th Battalion, together
with the 23rd and 24th Battalions, embarked on the transport
“Minnewaska,” and after an anxious but uneventful voyage,
arrived at Alexandria two days later. The troops were at once
entrained for Tel-el-Kebir, where they arrived about midnight,
and found many members of the Battalion who had been
evacuated from Gallipoli through sickness and wounds, wait-
ing to rejoin their unit.
The plains of Tel-el-Kebir made a splendid camping
ground. A fine canal ran parallel with the front of the camp,
and along its banks some excellent plantations and gardens
were flourishing, while the railway from Suez to Cairo also
crossed our front, the railway station being in the township
about a mile distant. The desert on our side of the canal was
studded with many-coloured pebbles, which made the ground
solid and suitable for marching, but on the other side of the
canal beyond the irrigation belt, there were great moving
sandhills most wearisome to tramp over.
The locality was of historic interest from the fact that
just beyond our lines were the original earthworks thrown up
by Arabi Pasha’s force in 1882, when Sir Garnet Wolseley
inflicted so decisive a defeat upon the rebels. We found many
interesting war trophies and mementos of this historic battle-
field, and the troops never tired of wandering over the old
defensive works and in fancy fighting the battle of Tel-el-
Kebir as they imagined it was fought thirty-four years earlier.
Very limited leave was possible here, and soon the whole of
the Australian forces were concentrated, and their camping
ground made a noble show. Training was vigorously carried
out in preparation for expected operations against a threatened
Turkish invasion of Egypt.
On the 3rd of February the Battalion entrained once more
and proceeded to Ismalia, where the Suez Canal was crossed
by pontoon bridges. Here we took up a new position on the
Asiatic shore, on the exact spot where the Turks had made


their ill-fated dash on the canal in 1915. Defensive positions
were at once commenced, both at the canal and in the desert
about ten miles inland. The Camel Corps was much in evidence
in the making of a road, and a desert railway was laid down.
Most of our time was taken up in digging and fortifying
trenches and supplying outposts, but as much training as
possible was carried out. On the sth of March we re-crossed
the canal and marched to Moascar, where preparations were
commenced for our move to France. We occupied the lines
of a New Zealand unit which had taken over the duties we
had held on the other side of the canal. We were inspected by
General Birdwood, who gave us much valuable advice as to
the new conditions we would experience in France.


CHAPTER V.
EARLY DAYS IN FRANCE.
On March 14th we entrained for Alexandria, being part of
the first Australian force to leave for Europe. Our brigade
was given pride of place, and v/e embarked on the troopship
“Northland” on March 15th for Marseilles. The voyage was a
smooth one, although the presence of enemy submarines made
it necessary that very great precaution should be taken, but
despite many alarms we safely reached port. It was with
mingled feelings on the morning of March 21 that we watched
the shores of France drawing close, and as the vessel slowly
made its way to the wharfside our band mustered on deck
and lustily played the “Marseillaise,” to the evident delight of
the waiting population. As the first Australian troops to arrive
en route to the battle line a wonderful reception was accorded
to the different battalions of our brigade, and the utmost
enthusiasm demonstrated the deep-seated sense of apprecia-
tion which the French nation held for the men from Greater
Britain.
Everything was at once got ready for disembarkation, but
no one was allowed ashore, and during the afternoon instruc-
tions arrived that we would leave Marseilles by train at one
o’clock the next morning. Just before midnight therefore we
left the ship and marched through the streets to the railway
station, the band performing wonderfully well. The whole
of the 26th Battalion and half of the 27th Battalion, with the
7th Field Ambulance, numbering in all about 1,500 men, were
accommodated in one train, which consisted of fifty coaches
drawn by very powerful engines. The work of entrainment
was slow, but eventually we pulled out of the station bound
for the north. The south of France was just wakening from
its winter sleep, and the crisp air of an early spring was very
invigorating after our recent sojourn in the sweltering heat
of Egypt. The trees were just clothing themselves in their
new season’s raiment, and hedges and fields were sparkling


with brilliant points of dew. The villages and towns, clean,
tidy, and picturesque, were visions of delight to our eyes after
the squalid native villages of Lemnos and Egypt, while the
wide smooth roads, stretching like ribbons across the green
landscape, were pictures of municipal perfection.
The railway ran along the Rhone Valley, and the endless
change of panoramic beauty called forth expressions of appre-
ciation from even the most unimpressionable Diggers. The
inhabitants of the various towns through which we passed
were wildly enthusiastic, and at almost every stop hospitality
was offered and accepted. Rations, principally tinned meat
and biscuits, were carried in bulk on the train, and a daily issue
was made by the quarter-master.
The flag of the 27th Battalion, which had a map of Aus-
tralia as its central design, was displayed as we passed through
the towns, and evoked great interest among the French people.
At one of the wayside stations where our train was halted a
number of our men were walking up and down the platform
by way of exercise, when an aged peasant threw his arms
round the neck of one of them and kissed him heartily on both
cheeks. The young Australian flushed in dismay, not being
familiar with this French method of greeting, but his dismay
was not such as to prevent his glancing at some bonnie French
girls nearby, as though inviting them to follow the lead so
nobly given by their aged compatriot.
During the rail journey a few of the men found it hard
to restrain their enthusiasm, and some adventurous spirits
even essayed to ride on the tops of the railway coaches, as
they had been wont to do in Egypt. Despite several warnings
this was persisted in, until one unfortunate lad of the 7th Field
Ambulance met his death through the train suddenly plunging
into a tunnel. This sad occurrence had the effect of restraining
the boys from riding in such an unorthodox manner, but not
being used to such cramped conditions of travel as were neces-
sitated by the coaches provided, they relieved the congestion
by riding upon the steps and even the couplings of the train.
It is on record that one man, who lingered rather too long at
a wayside station, missed the troop train. When his predica-
ment was understood by the railway officials they took steps
to entertain him, and later placed him on the Paris express,
on which he travelled in luxury and comfort, passing our slow
moving train, and was later left at a large city station, where
he waited in delightful unconcern until our train steamed in,


when he rejoined his envious comrades and regaled them with
the story of his journey, in the telling of which he let his fancy
have loose rein.
It was interesting to note the changes in the landscape
as we got further north, and on the third night of our journey
we ran into a severe snowstorm. We had left behind the
genial south, with its opening spring, and found instead a
whitened north where bitter cold and winter still held sway.
Snow had covered everything, and we felt the change of tem-
perature very keenly.
Just before midday on March 24 we disentrained at a
small village called Thiennes, and after unloading our baggage
marched through snow to Morbecque, about five miles distant,
and were accommodated in huts lately occupied by British
troops. The weather was bitterly cold, and we were glad
when next day we moved out of the huts and were billeted
among the surrounding population. Billeting in France was
for lodging only, for which the inhabitant or owner of the
premises received an allowance per head for the troops accom-
modated. For the most part barns and sheds were secured,
while each company established its kitchen in some central
position. A feature of the French farms was a pond or midden
into which all house and other refuse was thrown, and these
were periodically emptied to manure the surrounding fields.
To Australians this appeared a most unhealthy and insanitary
procedure, but the French folk appear to take no harm. A
story is told that two members of the 27th Battalion were
returning to their billets after an evening spent in the village,
when one of them, walking too close to the edge of a midden,
managed to fall in. His companion viewed the incident with
composure for a few minutes, and then gravely plunged in
to the rescue. Both men waded to safety, and, somewhat chas-
tened by the incident, proceeded to their quarters, where their
appearance and the unsavoury odour resulting from their im-
mersion, called forth much uncomplimentary comment from
their mates. Eventually they were compelled to disrobe out-
side, and leave their clothing in the fresh air to sweeten. They
applied for a fresh issue next day.
We found the French people very anxious to do every-
thing possible for our comfort, and our men did their part in
honouring and respecting the home life of their hosts. The
French children in particular were great favourites with the
troops, who taught them to speak the Digger tongue and sing


the Diggers’ songs. The attempts of the Australians to make
themselves understood were oftentimes very droll, but their
ready wit carried them through the most intricate commercial
transactions with the business people and villagers.
We daily saw British regiments passing through on their
way to the front, and the sound of gunfire was practically
continuous, while at night time the horizon was lighted with
the glare of rockets and flares.
On April 4th the whole of the 7th Brigade marched for-
ward, the 27th Battalion leading the column. Our first night’s
halt was at Outerstein, and the next at Erquinghem, where our
Battalion headquarters were in an old chateau, with oak
beams bearing the date 1616 supporting the roof, while the
moat and drawbridge were still in good order.


CHAPTER VI.
IN THE TRENCHES AT ARMENTIERES.
Brigade headquarters were established in the Rue Marie,
Armentieres, and the morning after our arrival the Battalion
Commanding Officer and and company commanders went into
the front line. The position was then held by a battalion of
Northumberland Fusiliers, and our instructions were to relieve
them on the night of April 7th. Our officers made a careful
inspection of the position, the Commanding Officer remaining
while the rest returned to the Battalion. The trenches, which
were really breastworks of sand bags, were in a bad state of
repair. The country being low-lying, it was impossible to dig
trenches except for drainage purposes, while the traffic was
over “duck boards,’’ man}? of which were broken. The troops
in occupation stated that for the most part there was little
enemy activity except for artillery fire.
The brigade front consisted of about a mile, and was
divided into two sectors, each to be held by a battalion, the
27th and 25th alternately holding the left and the 28th and
26th the right, while in turn the battalions not in line acted
as supports or reserves. The railway line from Armentieres to
Lille ran through the position, and several ruined farms and
other buildings were in the area. The Battalion headquarters
were in an orchard, and had been furnished with useful articles
retrieved from the nearby buildings.
On the night of April 7th, the 27th and 28th Battalions
quietly marched into the line, and by midnight the takeover
had been completed, and for the first time in the history of the
war Australian troops were in the front line of the European
theatre. The arrival of our troops and the attitude adopted by
them soon altered the demeanour of the opposing Germans,
and a notice was received by means of a rifle grenade fired
into the lines of the 28th Battalion at a point where the trenches
were only about thirty yards apart. The notice read, in effect:
“Welcome, you brave Australian heroes, soon your blood will


stain the fields of France. You will find the German dog can
bite. Witness Verdun.”
Our time was fully occupied, as all troops not actually on
observation during the daytime were busily engaged in
strengthening support lines, repairing trenches, and making
wire entanglements, which were placed in position at night.
Rations and engineering material came up at night, and were
dumped on the road near the place where the trenches were
first entered, and had to be carried in the darkness along slimy
slippery duckboards to where they were needed in the lines.
Many of our boys will recall those nightly pilgrimages along
Wine Avenue, Cowgate Avenue, Paradise Alley, or Leith
Walk.
Later, when the New Zealanders arrived, they took over
part of the line on our left, and a consequent alteration of the
sector boundaries necessitated the creation of a new battalion
headquarters, which were located on a newly dug sap, which
was called Unley Road.
One of the unfortunate features of the campaign in France
at this stage was the shortage of shells and the difficulties
which our supporting artillery suffered in consequence. Very
often our lines had to submit to heavy bombardments without
retaliation, and the gunners chafed under the restraint thus
imposed upon them.
While on Gallipoli we had seen something of the work of
the air service, and in consequence aeroplanes had ceased to
be a novelty to us, but in France the number and efficiency
of this branch of the service was wonderfully increased.
Members of the Battalion will doubtless remember the
afternoon when, just as company commanders were meeting
the C.O. for the daily conference to determine the night’s
activities, a battery commenced ranging on the enemy’s posi-
tion with an aeroplane “spotting” for it. The enemy was firing
every available anti-aircraft gun in an endeavour to drive the
airmen off, but the plane continued its operations until a
shrapnel shell appeared to make a direct hit, when immediately
the plane began its downward course. Nearly every man of
the Battalion watched as she dived, steadied, and dived again,
until, when near the ground, she turned completely over, lying
right across our communication trench. Willing helpers were
soon on the scene and it was found that the pilot was killed,
but the observer only shaken and stunned, and after a rest and
some attention he was able to make his way back to the aero-
c


drome. No sooner had the plane settled than the Germans
commenced a heavy fire about the place of its fall, and
although quite a number of the men of the Battalion were
clustered there, no casualties followed. Later the enemy
managed to set the plane on fire, but the engine and essential
parts were safely salvaged by our men.
The tour of duty for each Battalion was from five to
twelve days in the front line trenches, and similar periods in
support or reserve. Reliefs were made at night-time and the
taking over period usually lasted from about ten o’clock till
midnight. The troops marching out took over the billets
vacated by those marching in, and were able for a few days at
least to have a comparative rest.
Soon after our arrival in France we had learned about the
raids which were made from time to time by the British troops
upon the German line, and which were sometimes imitated
by the enemy. Our men were keen to try a raid, and two
parties, one from the 27th and 25th and one from the 26th
and 28th were selected and told off to prepare for the under-
taking. The point to be raided was carefully selected, atten-
tion being given to the line of approach, condition and strength
of enemy wire, and whether the selected point was dominated
by an enemy salient from which machine guns could operate.
These points having been decided, an aeroplane photo-
graph was taken over the enemy lines showing the form of the
hostile trenches. A place was then selected in rear of our
billeting area where a “copy” of the enemy position was made.
Trenches were dug and wire erected as much as possible in
resemblance to the place selected for the raid. Here the “teams”
practised until they knew every turn and angle, and each man
knew his exact task. Special bombers, bayonet men, scouts,
intelligence men and guards v/ere appointed' and soon their
work was done with precision and effect, and there only
remained the fixing of the date and the arranging of the artil-
lery programme.
Weather conditions were carefully watched, and at last
the programme and timetable was ready for our first brigade
raid. The 27th and 28th Battalions were at the time occupying
the front line, and we waited with anxiety and interest the
coming of the hour that had been fixed for the opening “cere-
mony.” Minutes slowly passed, and a few moments before
midnight we took up positions where we could best see the
“fireworks.” Suddenly, on time to the second, our guns began


to speak. Crash went the trench mortars, and overhead the
shells shrieked. A few seconds later, the enemy started his
retaliation. Shells began to rain on our front line, our support
line, and along our communication trenches. Then our artil-
lery lifted, the signal that our men were in the enemy lines.
Twelve minutes later they were on their way back, passing
through the German barrage. Then the fire died away. A
spiteful 18-pounder spoke a few times more, the enemy guns
grew quiet, and presently came the telephone message from
brigade headquarters, “Raid successful, one minor casualty.”
We found Armentieres a very interesting town, and were
able to purchase many comforts to make the army rations
more palatable. There were nice tearooms, and many army
canteens and institutes, which all helped to deaden for a time
memories of the discomforts and disabilities of the front line.
A local dyeworks had been taken over and converted into
baths and laundry, and the delight that the hot baths and clean
clothing gave to all ranks can easily be understood.
Although the town and neighbourhood were frequently
under enemy shellfire, the inhabitants appeared indifferent,
and in the surrounding fields agricultural operations were not
allowed to be interfered with. All the townspeople carried
gas masks in readiness for any hostile gas action, and even the
school children carried them in an extra satchel. Several
alarms were given, and the spectacle of troops and civilians
alike wearing the hideous masks, gave the impression that
beings from another planet had suddenly populated the earth.
On June 7, 1916, these trenches were handed over to the
sth Brigade, our Battalion taking up quarters in huts at
La Rolanderie, near Erquinghem, where the troops were used
in the construction and strengthening of the Bois Grenier line
of defence. La Rolanderie was a big farm house with a wide
moat surrounding it. On one afternoon teams selected from
two of the companies were playing a football match in truly
Australian fashion, when suddenly a shell fell and burst in the
middle of the field. A glance upwards showed that a British
aeroplane had been fired at by a German anti-aircraft gun, and
the shell failing to burst in the air, had fallen on our football
grounds to burst on impact. About half a minute later the
game was resumed, and soon the ball was gaily floating on
the slimy surface of the moat. A few moments’ hesitation and
a cheer betokened the fact that one of the bystanders was
stripping for an icy plunge. The ball was recovered and the
game lost and won.


CHAPTER VII.
MESSINES.
A few days later Battalion Commanders were called to
confer with the Brigade Staff, and on June 17 the Battalion
moved out and made its way across the frontier into Belgium,
where a halt was made at a battered township that had fallen
to the enemy in his first rush in 1914. This was Neuve Eglise,
and nearby was a camping ground known as Kortypip, where
huts were provided for all ranks. The night before our arrival
the 25th and 26th Battalions had gone into the front line, and
as a welcome the enemy had released a wide-spreading cloud
of gas, which caused many casualties and penetrated far behind
the lines. Nearly all of the vegetation was scorched and
shrivelled as a result, and the wind continuing favourable for
further similar discharges, all gas masks were worn at the
“alert.” During our first night Zeppelins were distinctly heard
and faintly seen passing over for a raid on the coast of
England.
For about ten days our troops were vigorously exercised,
particularly in bomb throwing, and the officers and non-
commissioned officers were given opportunities of visiting the
front line in order to familiarise themselves with it in readiness
for our “turn.” All the roads leading to the trenches were trav-
ersed both by day and night and the features of the position
studied. A raiding party was told off under the lead of Captain
Julge, and its members were kept busy preparing themselves
for their task.
Leave to visit England was now granted to a proportion
of the men, and every few days fresh drafts were despatched
to “Blighty” for a ten days’ holiday. Those returning to duty
after “Blighty” leave were loud in their expressions of appre-
ciation of the kindness and hospitality shown to them while
away.

THE BASILICA OF ALBERT AFTER 15 MONTHS OF BOMBARDMENT.


We had become accustomed to see, to the north of us, a
number of enemy observation balloons, which fact prevented
certain hidden artillery batteries from firing without disclosing
their position. Some of these guns were most cunningly hidden
in canvas houses which were deceptive even to the passerby. A
peaceful looking rustic cottage would suddenly collapse while
a terrific discharge from a big gun would send a shell hurtling
towards the enemy lines and then the house would reappear,
and look as innocent as ever. The presence of the enemy’s
balloons made the battery commander very cautious about
opening fire, and it was with great delight that on a Monday
afternoon we saw an aeroplane suddenly appear at a great
height above the balloons. With a terrific dive the airman was
soon hovering over the German “sausages,” and with phos-
phorous bombs exploded three out of the four, the fourth
managing to reach the gound safely, while the enemy anti-
aircraft guns drove our aeroplane off. From this on, however,
the Boche was very careful about sending his balloons up, and
our batteries took full advantage of the opportunity.
On June 26th, the 27th Battalion was detailed to take
over the line from the 25th, and on the night of that day we
marched in. The trenches were in a very bad condition and
were quite unmade on a portion of the front occupied. The
main communication trench was known as Medicine Hat
Trail, and as the enemy occupied much higher ground in the
vicinity of Messines, hostile gunfire was frequently directed
along this trench, for a portion of which persons passing were
in full view of the enemy. A big bend in the trench line made
enfilade fire easy on the part of the Germans. The enemy
occupying a very commanding position, methodically shelled
any portion of the trenches where repairs were attempted. At
night the part of the front line which had not been made was
held by small advanced parties while endeavours were made
to build up a trench. The two lines of trenches were very close
together, and the enemy made great use of minnenwerfer
bombs, which were fitted with a powerful high explosive and
did shocking damage to our trenches. There were many very
sad casualties here, the effect of the bombs being particularly
destructive, and “D” Company had a very bad time.
While in the line our raiding party made a very successful
sortie into the enemy trench. The party consisted of men
drawn from the 27th and 25th'Battalions, with Captain Julge
in command. For a few days prior to the date fixed for the


raid our artillery had concentrated on the enemy wire, particu-
larly about the selected point of entry. Patrols reported that
the wire had been effectively cut, and machine gun fire was
directed on the breaches thus made to prevent any repairs
being effected. The raid opened with an intense concentrated
bombardment, under cover of which our troops left the
trenches and advanced as far as possible towards their objec-
tive. Then the artillery barrage lifted to a point behind the
lines, and the raiders entered the trenches, did all possible
damage, secured prisoners and were on their way back before
the enemy could organise any counter-attack. The only
casualty incurred was that Lance-Corporal Davies, who was
killed after the party had returned to our lines.
Late in June we received instructions to instal gas cylinders
in our front trenches in readiness to launch a gas attack with
the first favourable wind. The cylinders had to be carried up,
and carrying parties had an anxious time, as the enemy kept
up a continuous gunfire over the whole of our area. However,
the task was safely carried out, ana on the next night a favour-
able wind blowing towards the enemy, gave us the chance of
using gas for the first time. A heavy bombardment started the
performance, and then gas mixed with smoke was discharged
right along the line. The enemy evidently feared that an
attack in force would follow', and opened up a fierce artillery
retaliation, but beyond a few raids at various points no attack
was launched. Evidence from aircraft next day was to the
effect that our gas attack had caused a lot of casualties.
Our term in the trenches was to end at midnight on July
4, and from early morning the enemy gave us a lot of attention,
evidently in reprisal for our gas clouds of the night before.
During our tour of duty great improvements had been made
in the condition of the trenches, despite the fact that our
work had been greatly impeded by enemy action. “A” Com-
pany, under Captain J. W. Blacket, had held the right
of our position during the whole time, and “D”
Company, under Captain Chalmers, was on the left with
“B” Company (Captain Dey) and “C” Company (Major
Cunningham) in support and reserve. At about 11 a.m. on
July 4 Captain Blacket, with Lieut. W. W. Hosking, had
returned to his company headquarters after inspecting his line,
and the two officers stood in conversation with Lieut. H.
Walker, w'hen a heavy high explosive shell burst alongside,
killing both Captain Blacket and Lieut. Hosking and seriously


wounding Lieut. Walker, besides causing numerous other
casualties. As Lieut. John had been wounded previously,
“A” Company thus lost all its officers. The enemy
bombarded this quarter severely all day, and the parapet or
breastwork was completely blown down, which fact made it
very difficult to attend to or evacuate the wounded or even
to recover the dead bodies of the two officers, which lay
exposed to the full view of the Germans. Despite the hazardous
nature of the task, Captain Brownell, the regimental medical
officer, assisted by Corporal Dickenson, did their utmost for
the wounded, who eventually were carried to the casualty
clearing station.
Coming so soon before our relief, this event saddened all
ranks, and arrangements were made for a burial that night
after our relief had arrived.
When darkness fell there was a misty rain falling, and the
pitch black darkness was accentuated by the flares and rockets
that soared from the enemy lines, while overhead spat the
vicious machine-gun bullets, seeking for victims behind the
lines. At intervals shells burst along the front, and also along
the known roadways, while on our left towards Ypres inces-
sant gunfire told of a struggle there.
It was nearly one o’clock when the 25th Battalion had
completed taking over, and during the whole evening the rain
had continued, and by that time was pouring down in torrents,
while every ditch and trench was a roaring flood. Then sud-
denly the rain ceased, clouds passed away, and a bright sky
was over all, the troops of the Battalion had marched out in
teeming rain bound for the comparative comfort of Kortypip
camp, but the Battalion staff and close comrades of the
deceased officers, accompanied by the chaplain, set off to pay
a last tribute of respect and esteem to the remains of those
recently fallen.
The burial ground was at La Petit Douve Farm, and the
way thither was swept by machine-gun fire. The “klip” of
passing bullets, the fitful glare of trench lights, and the sodden
condition of the ground made the journey an anxious one, and
the padre (Senior Chaplain Crookston) once slipped nearly
out of sight in a deep ditch. Soon we reached the cemetery,
and reverently stood while the padre recited the service over
the bodies of our comrades, and there we left them to their
peaceful slumber, while our hearts went out in sympathy to


those near and dear to the many brave, faithful men who had
fallen, and whose graves lie on so many fields far from their
native land.
Although we were quartered in and about the township
of Neuve Eglise, any spare time or leave was spent in the
neighbouring town of Baileul, which was much more populous
and of greater interest. It was also a big air service centre and
had a very fine hospital, which received the casualties from
this part of the line.
There was considerable interest among the members of
the Battalion at the news which had reached us concerning the
advance being made by the British and French Armies on
the Somme, and newspaper reports and sketches were eagerly
scanned, while rumours were freely circulated that we were to
make a “push” and attack Messines. These rumours were
coloured with stories of new batteries arriving and railways
being pushed forward, and one circumstance which appeared
to confirm the suggestion was the receipt of instructions to
survey and report upon all roads leading towards the front, as
to their condition for the use of wheeled traffic. We lived in a
whirl of contradictory reports, until suddenly British troops
appeared and took over the line, and we heard that the First
Australian Division had already gone south. Then our orders
came, and every bit of surplus baggage and equipment was
packed up and sent away, to eventually find a resting place at
the kit store in Horseferry Road, London.


CHAPTER VIII.
OFF TO THE SOMME.
On July 8 we moved out on the first stage of our journey
towards the big push on the Somme, and marched as far as
Steenwerck, where the battalion was billeted over a wide area.
The next day being Sunday, we rested, and, “wonder of
wonders,” had no fatigues to supply, but at 8 a.m. on the 10th
we got on the move once more, and passed through LeVerrier,
Outerstein, and Merris, and found quarters between the vil-
lages of Strazelle and Fletre. The farms and homesteads
were far apart, and the unit was split into fragments before
the members were all accommodated. Our march next day
took us through Hazebrouck, which was a city of considerable
size, and very close to Morbecque, the first village in which
we had been billeted. Our next halt was at Renescure, where
very comfortable quarters were secured. At noon next day we
marched to Mizernes and entrained at dusk for Saleux, which
town we reached about 5 o’clock next morning. As soon as
possible we halted for a roadside breakfast, and then marched
along roads between fine growing crops of wheat, while the
fields were a perfect blaze of red, white, and blue from the
poppies, daisies, and cornflowers, which grow in profusion
everywhere. Late in the afternoon we passed some British
regiments on their way back after participating in the hard
fighting of the Somme attack. They were laden with trophies
from the battlefield, and gave us a jaunty greeting as they
passed. We reached Bertangles that evening and went into
rather uncomfortable billets. We stayed here for the next
few days and did some hard training, particularly in tactical
exercises. There was a big aerodrome nearby, and we were all
interested in the movements of the “flying men,” who were
practising low flying and shooting at ground targets as they
swept over them. Some of our men managed to get as far as
Amiens, some with leave, and others without.


While we were located at Bertangles, arrangments were
made for the Battalion Commanders to accompany the Divi-
sional Commanders to a point near the front line, from which
the extent and importance of the British advance could be
estimated; a wet, misty day made visibility bad, but still a
reasonable idea of what had been accomplished since July 1
was obtained.
On July 20 we marched from Bertangles via Villers,
Bocage, and Rubempre to Toutencourt, where we occupied
huts abutting on a sunken road about half a mile from the
centre of the town. From here the Brigade Commander and
staff, with Battalion Commanders, were taken into the front
line, where the Ist Australian Division was taking part in the
offensive against Pozieres. Soon after their return to Touten-
court an order was received instructing the Battalion to move
out within twenty minutes, and the round up of stragglers in
order to carry out the instruction will be long remembered.
Despite the short notice received the unit marched out to the
minute, leaving camp at 8.30 p.m. The move was via Harpon-
ville to Warloy-Baillon, and it was late that night before
quarters were allotted and the men settled down. Next day
was Sunday, and at a church parade held General Birdwood
attended and afterwards addressed the troops, making special
reference to the work that was ahead of us. Warloy was a very
pretty little town, untouched by shell fire, and the lanes,
with overgrowing hedges and quaint little cottages nestling in
perfect forests of greenery, were extremely picturesque. Dur-
ing the next three days we went in for a lot of training, special
attention being given to rapid firing and bayonet fighting
under specially allotted instructors, while short tactical exer-
cises based on the latest field training experience were carried
cut across the nearby fields.
On the evening of July 26 the Battalion marched once
more, and bivouacked at the brickfields on the outskirts of
Albert. Everybody will remember this town, with its badly
shell-torn streets, and the big church with the spire on the
summit of which was the statue of the Madonna leaning over
at right angles from the perpendicular.
Next morning the Battalion and Brigade staffs went for-
ward into the front line, which was then held by Australians
of the Ist and 2nd Divisions, and had a good opportunity of
viewing the situation. It was, however, only a hurried visit,
and battalions moved out the same evening to Tara Hill, and


the 27th were bivouacked in and about trenches which had been
occupied by the British just prior to the big advance on July
1. In fact, we were alongside the tremendous crater which was
the result of the mining explosion which heralded the advance
on that epoch-making day. The old German trenches were
just in front of us, and the road to Pozieres alongside us.
Early next morning, July 28, Battalion and Company
Commanders met the Brigadier, and were told that that even-
ing an attack was to be made on the heights above Pozieres,
with the tramline trench which ran through the town as a
“jumping-off” place, The line was held by a battalion of the
6th Brigade, and our advance was to be against what were
known as 0.G.l and 0.G.2 German trenches. The attack was
to be made by the 25th, 26th, and 28th Battalions, with the
27th Battalion in support. Our C.O, protested that we should
take part in the attack, but the brigade order was that the
battalions named were in that order of march formation, and
no special selection had been made. One company of the
27th Battalion was detailed as support to each of the attacking
battalions, and the others held in reserve. All the officers of
the troops detailed then made a tour of the line to reconnoitre
the position in readiness for the attack, and that same evening
when the 25th, 25th, and 28th Battalions had marched through
our lines, we formed up and followed them to a position at
Laßoiselle. the route running through the famous Sausage
Valley. The attack commenced as soon as it was dark, a
short preliminary artillery bombardment opening the engage-
ment. Unfortunately, the artillery preparation was insufficient,
and the advancing troops found the wire entanglements prac-
tically intact, while the front was swept by machine gun fire
of so intense a nature that, while heroic attempts were made
to force a way through, the troops were withdrawn after suffer-
ing severe casualties. A very heavy enemy fire over the whole
of our lines continued throughout the operation, and our
Battalion suffered, though but slightly as compared with the
three Battalions which had made the attack. As soon as news
of the withdrawal reached our headquarters the Battalion
withdrew from the trenches we were occupying to make room
for the troops who had been more actively engaged, and
returned to the old British trenches in which we had been
quartered the previous day. Later the 25th, 26th, and 28th
went back to Tara Hill, and the 27th once more resumed
occupation of Laßoiselle.


There was a great amount of interest to be found in these
old German trenches, which had been made into very snug and
secure quarters by the previous tenants. Very deep shelters
had been provided, and many comforts such as wooden linings,
sleeping berths, electric light, etc., were installed. The Ger-
mans had evidently worked very hard in establishing them-
selves, and the permanent character of many of their works
was an evidence that they did not expect to be driven out of
their line. A British salvage company was busy collecting and
sorting heaps of useful material left by the enemy, and our
boys got many souvenirs from a salvage dump in our lines.

CHAPTER IX.
POZIERES.
Following the failure of July 28/29 our Divisional
Commander issued instructions for our Brigade to make
another attack, and careful preparations were made to ensure
that the artillery fire was effective on the enemy’s wire entan-
glements, continuous bursts of fire being maintained by day
and night, and machine guns being trained on all points to
prevent repair work being carried out. An assembly trench
was dug about midway across No Man’s Land, the work
being carried out by fatigue parties from the various bat-
talions, assisted by a pioneer unit. Naturally a number of
casualties were sustained by the working parties, but the work
was nevertheless completed. A conference of Commanding
Officers was called to fix the date and time of attack, and the
suggestion of Colonel Dollman that August 4th should be
selected was adopted, that being the anniversary of Great
Britain’s entry into the War. Details were discussed and
subsequently conveyed to Company Commanders, who passed
them on to their men.
As the time approached for this, our first actual attack on
the Germans, every member of the Battalion felt an elation
and a perfect confidence in the result. A recent instruction
had laid it down that only a limited number of officers should
accompany the troops in attack, and the allotment on this
occasion was as follows: Battalion Headquarters, Lt.-Colonel
Dollman and Lieut. Freiderichs; “A” Company, Capt. Devon-
shire, Lieuts. Whyborn and Ridge; “B” Company, Capt. Dey
and Lieuts. Campbell and Boorn; “C” Company, Major Cun-
ningham and Lieut. Durden; “D” Company, Lieuts. P. Julge,
Selth and Clyde; Machine Guns, Lieut. Rowe; Bombers,
Lieut. Pearce. Headquarters of the 27th and 25th Battalions
were fixed in the same shelter in the front line trench, and
though in the opening phases of the attack telephonic con-
nection was maintained with Brigade and neighbouring


troops, the severe enemy bombardment which followed the
advance of our troops completely broke down this method of
communication, and reliance had to be placed on the “runners,”
who on this occasion, as well as on so many others, proved
themselves both fearless and reliable.
The detailed Brigade Orders for the operation were as
follows:
27th Battalion.
SECRET. COPY No. 7.
7th AUSTRALIAN INFANTRY BRIGADE.
ORDER No. 30.
4th August, 1916.

All information has already been communicated to officers com-
manding units. The sth Brigade is attacking on our right, and the
6th Brigade on our left, and the 12th Australian Infantry Brigade
(less one Battalion) is in Divisional Reserve,
2. The attack by this Brigade will take place at zero time on the
night of the 4/sth August Watches will be synchronised with Bri-
gade Signal Office at 4 p.m.
Zero time will be communicated verbally to Os/C. Units, or by
D.R.

26th Bn. 2nd Objective—R 35 c 0 9 to R 34 d 6 8 exclusive.
The portion of 0.G.2. between R 35 c \\ and R 35 c 7 4 being
nearly obliterated will be occupied by strong patrols with Lewis
guns. Shell craters will be strengthened and connected up.
Note.—There is a new German trench dug about 100 yards N.E.
of windmill.
4. Instructions regarding assembly of troops is shown in
Appendix “A.”
5. Assault. The hostile trenches to be assaulted will be sub-
jected to a bombardment by Heavy Artillery from 5 to 6 p.m., fol-
lowed by normal barrage.
Silent Period. Then will follow a period of silence of 15 minutes,
with no artillery bombardment. During this silent period troops will
not move, and they must keep as hidden as possible.


At 0015 an intense barrage of the first objective will commence,
and will last three minutes. At the same time the first wave will leave
the forward line and move up as close as it can under the barrage;
the second wave will follow at about 50 yards distance. The third
wave will move up in line over the open to the forward line (new
trench), and the fourth wave will follow at about 50 yards distance
and with the third wave will occupy the new trench.
First Lift. At 0018 the intense barrage will lift to 0.G.2., and the
first and second waves will rush the first objective and secure it. The
third wave will follow, cross the first objective, ana move up as close
under the barrage as it can. The fourth will follow at 50 yards
distance, and lie down under the parapet of 0.G.1. (on our side).
Second Lift. At 0028 the barrage will lift 50 yards from 0.G.2;
the third wave, followed by the fourth, will follow the barrage as close
as they can, and will rush and secure 0.G.2.
Third Lift. At 0030 the barrage will lift another 50 yards.
Immediately following the fourth wave the parties of Engineers
and Pioneers for the construction of strong points and communica-
tion trenches, will move up to the sites of these positions, and com-
mence work.
Fourth Lift. At 0032 the barrage will lift a third 50 yards. This
will be the final barrage.
Carrying parties should now be arriving with their loads, which
will be dumped in the captured trenches as arranged by Commanders
previously. These parties will be available to assist back wounded
men and to escort prisoners.
Patrols. Patrolling will be carried out during intervals in the
barrage fire. Patrols v/ill be sent out by sth Brigade to R 35 d 5 2;
by 7th Brigade to R 35 d 0 6 and trenches at R 35 a 4 2 and 5 2;
by the 6th Brigade to R 34 b 4 4.
Action after assault. Immediately each objective is occupied and
the resistance of the enemy has been overcome, the troops allotted to
that objective will commence;
1— To secure position against counter-attack, by putting Lewis
guns out in front in the case of the 0.G.2. line.
2 Consolidation of both lines—principally 0.G.2.
3 Mopping up or nettoyage of trenches, dugout and communica-
tion trenches. Special parties v/ill be told off for this pur-
pose. Blocks to be constructed in trenches leading towards
enemy, with wire netting roof to throw off enemy’s bombs.
Mopping up parties will be the 2nd and 4th waves.
4 Infantry to cut passages through parapet of 0.G.1 and 2 to
facilitate entrance from back.
Hostile Counter Attack. In case of hostile counter-attack, the
existing S.O.S. Signal of three red rockets will be used, and in addi-
tion Red Verey Lights v/ill be fired in quick succession, in groups of
three, along the front the enemy is attacking, v/hereupon the Artillery
tvill maintain a barrage 150 yards in front of 0.G.2.
In addition to the above, “Lights long green” will be carried (4
Per platoon) and will be used occasionally to indicate the position of
our troops to our Artillery. Green Lights are Not S.O.S. Signals.
7. Smoke Mortars and their action. Smoke Mortars have been
emplaced at X 5 a 8 5, R 34 c 1J 6, 6 7 and 8 5. They will as far as
the wind allows place a smoke barrage on the two flanks of the
attack. Smoke will be used on the front of the Division on our left.


8. Machine Guns. O.C. 7th Machine Gun Coy. will place one
section in position already selected at X 10 d to bring indirect fire
to bear on ground in rear of objectives. He will not bring fire to
bear within 200 yards of 0.G.2. He will detail 2 sections to move as
in Appendix A, and follow assaulting waves, and take up positions in
strong points in 0.G.1. Remaining section will be in reserve at a
selected position in X 10 d. Lewis guns will accompany their Units.
9. Stokes Mortars. Four Stokes Mortars, with detachments and
carrying parties, will move as in Appendix “A,” and will take up a
position in forward trench near S.E. of strong point at R 34 d 9 0;
two of these mortars will be at the disposal of O.C. 27th Battalion,
when required to assist in blocking or bombing down south eastwards
from 0.G.1. or 0.G.2., and 2 Stokes guns and detachments will be at
disposal of 26th Battalion. Remaining 4 Stokes mortars and detach-
ments will be in reserve at X 10 d.
10. Two Coys. 23th Battalion and 4 Lewis guns will move as laid
down in Appendix “A,” and will garrison tramline trench after the
attacking parties have left it, with Lewis guns and some men in our
present new line and strong point 90. Two Coys. 23th Battalion will
occupy the line of strong points from X 10 d central to X 10 c central.
Headquarters 28th Battalion to be at X 11 a 3 1 to be vacated by 18th
Battalion by 2 p.m. to-day.
O.C. 27th Battalion will detail two liaison Officers, one for duty
with the sth Brigade and one for duty with the Bth Brigade. These
Officers should report to Brigade Headquarters at 4 p.m. on the day
of attack. They will be accompanied by four runners each.
11. Parties of Engineers and Pioneers are being detailed by
C.R.E.:
(a) To make strong points in the neighbourhood of the following
positions: Point 74 R 35 c 7-J 4
Point 48 R 35 c 4 8
Point 26 R 35 c 2 6
Note.—Battalions will assist Engineers with working parties, and
these parties should be told off beforehand for those strong
points.
(b) To open communication trench in X 5 a, R 35 c, R 34 d, from
present forward line to 0.G.1. and to re-open existing com-
munication trenches from 0.G.1. to 0.G.2. A special party
to construct trench back from the windmill to R 35 c 7 4.
12. O.C. Brigade Signal Section will draw a supply of pigeons
and will have them issued to Battalions by 2 p.m. Battalion Com-
manders will arrange to send up pigeons to forward lines when cap-
tured before daylight.
The organization of runners should be kept up to the strength
laid down in D.H.Q. circular on the subject.
Each Battalion will light flares at the following fixed hours:
6 a.m., 11 a.m., 5 p.m., 6 p.m.
Each Coy., or portion of a Coy., in 0.G.2. will light flares at the
above hours in addition to the Battalion Signals.
13. Attention is directed to the instructions which have been
issued regarding communication with aeroplanes. Green flares in
groups of three lit one after another (in a trench) are to be used by
all Brigades during daylight.
The signalling panels should be taken and used for the purpose
laid down.


The tin discs ordered to be carried by each man are to be tied
on the back when it is desired to show the position to our artillery
behind or to our aeroplanes.
14. Carrying Parties. Os.C. 25th, 26th and 27th Bns. will detail
4 men per platoon to act as carrying parties. These will form a sth
wave and follow closely the 4th wave, and will be under the Officers
commanding the two Coys, of each Battalion in the last two waves.
These parties should be equally distributed between these two Coys.,
and will carry extra sandbags, tools, wire, picks, S.A.A., bombs,
flares, rockets, etc., to 0.G.1., where two dumps per Battalion will
be formed. The positions for these dumps should be selected before-
hand and notified to all concerned. These carrying parties should be
organized with a proportion of N.C.O.’s under an officer, if available,
who will be responsible afterwards for keeping these new forward
dumps supplied from the present Battalion dumps. The ample supply
of Engineers’ stores to the special parties for blocking purposes at
each flank of each Battalion attacked must receive attention.
Two Coys, of the 46th Battalion have been at the disposal of the
G.O.C. 7th Inf. Brigade for carrying ammunition, material, etc., and
will be accommodated in Howitzer Avenue at X 10 b, and will be
used for keeping Battalion dumps supplied. Battalions themselves
will be responsible for keeping their forward dumps in 0.G.1. full.
O.C. Trench Mortar Bty. will apply to the two Coys, of 28th
Battalion in Tramway trench for parties to assist him in maintaining
his supply of ammunition when he goes forward.
14 (a). Medical arrangements for the evacuation of the wounded,
and administrative details are shown in Appendix “B.”
15. Dumps. Advanced Divisional dump is at Chalkpit, X 10 c
3 5; 7th Brigade dump is at X 11 a 1 2; sth Brigade dumps at X 16 a
4 4 and X 10 d 8 9; and 6th Brigade dumps at X 10 c 3 5 and
X 4 a 4 9.
A small reserve of water is maintained at Chalkpit.
16. Prisoners. All prisoners captured will be sent under a
mimimum escort to the Brigade dump, where they will be taken over
by a special party of one officer and 12 men to be detailed by O.C.
28th Battalion.
The Corps Cage for prisoners of war is at point W 28 b 8| 5, just
east of Albert. Prisoners will be sent to Corps Cage under orders of
G.0.C., 7th Infantry Brigade.
17. Brigade headquarters will be at Xlod2jo, and an advanced
report centre will be established at Reserve Battalion Headquarters,
X 11 a 3 1, where all reports should be sent.
18. It should be impressed upon all officers and men that:—
(a) It is extremely important not to take anything into action that
might be of value to the enemy. Secret orders should, therefore, not
go beyond Battalion Headquarters.
(b) All officers should be acquainted with the routes to the
trenches.
(c) All grounds gained must be held, and the word “retire”
is not to be used.

APPENDIX “A.”
ASSEMBLY.
Before attack commences following troops will be distributed
in trenches:—
New front line trench and T heads—first and second waves of the
attack.
On the right two Coys. 27th Battalion from Bapaume Road to
Strong Point R 34 d 9 0 inclusive.
In centre two Coys. 25th Battalion from left of 27th Battalion
to R S 4 d 5 4.
On the left two Coys. 26th Battalion from left of 25th Battalion
to R 34 d 2 3 exclusive.
(a) The 26th Battalion will move via the Bapaume Road, the La
Boiselle, Contalmaiscn Road, First Aid Trench, and Centre Way.
Two batteries of the Machine Gun Coy. will march in rear of the
26th Battalion, an interval of ten minutes being observed after
entering communication trenches. At a further interval of six
minutes one company of the 2Sth Battalion will follow the two bat-
teries of the Machine Gun Coy. The march will be so regulated
that the various units of this group pass the point X 4 d 1 7 at the
times shown in Table A.l.
(b) The 27ih Battalion will move via Sausage Valley, Sunken
Road, Copse Avenue, and Emu Avenue. The 27th Battalion will be
followed, an interval of five minutes being observed after entering
the communication trenches, by the Trench Mortar Batter;/, which
at a further interval of five minutes will be followed by one company
of the 2Sth Battalion. The march will be regulated so that the various
units of this group pass the point X 5 c 3 4 at the time shown in Table
A. 2.
(c) C.O. 26th Battalion will issue such instructions to the units
of group A.l as will ensure that there is no congestion or delay at the
entrance to communication trenches. There after the officers com-
manding attached units will be responsible for maintaining proper
touch and interval.
The same course will be adopted by C.O. 27th Battalion and
units of group A. 2. The interval between platoons will be 2i minutes.
(d) Headquarters 28th Battalion will be established at the Bri-
gade report centre by 0,400, care being taken not to interfere with
brigade signal arrangements. Two companys of the 28th Battalion
will reach and occupy trenches running east and west in X 10 d.
(e) C.O. 26th Battalion will place traffic control posts to turn
off between the hours 03-03 and zero any traffic in a direction opposite
to that of the column at the following trench junctions—X 9d7 7,
X 4 d 3 2, X 4 d 0 9.
Similar posts will be established by C.O. 27th Battalion at
X 11 a 4 8, X 5 c 3 4, X 5 c 2 7. Traffic outwards will be permitted
between the latter two points during the intervals between the arrival
of units at the last. C.O. 25th Battalion will establish control posts
to regulate traffic from tramway to the front trench.
(f) Battalion carrying parties of the 26th and 27th Battalions
will pick up engineering material at the engineer dump, X 15 central,


en route. Grenades, etc., will be picked up by 26th Battalion at
Chalk Pit dump and by 27th Battalion at the Brigade dump.
(g) No circumstances are to be permitted to prevent the arrival
of units at their zero time positions on time. Casualties in the com-
munication trenches will be evacuated down side trenches or where
this is impossible over open ground.

The Battalion moved oft on the tick of time, and the story
of the events can best be told in the official narrative supplied
at the conclusion of the action:—
Headquarters, 27th Battalion,
August Bth, 1916.
7th INFANTRY BRIGADE.
Operations August 4- 6, 1916.
In accordance with instructions, the 27th Battalion moved off
from La Boiselle for the position of assembly on the afternoon of
August 4th, the first platoon moving at about 5.30 p.m. An artillery
bombardment from our guns between the hours of 5 and 6 p.m.
resulted in a fairly heavy enemy retalliation, and all communication
trenches were shelled. The Battalion arrangements were for B and
A Companies, moving in that order, to occupy the “jumping off”
trenches in front of tramline, and form the first and second waves of
the assault with 0.G.l as their objective. D and C Companies were
to form up as third and fourth waves in tramline trench with special
carrying parties as a fifth wave. Arrangements were made with
G.O.C. sth Brigade to allow A and B Companies to use portion of
sth Brigade front line trench to permit them more easily to reach
assembly trenches.
Companies moved so that they would be correctly composed of
right and left half companies respectively, i.e., 8,6, 7,5, 4,2, 3, 1
platoons; of these 6,5, 2, 1 formed the first wave and 8,7, 4, 3 the
second wave. These were formed up in assembly trench. The third
and fourth waves were composed of 16, 14, 15, 13, 12, 10, 11, 9 platoons
with 14, 13, 10, 9 as third wave, and 16, 15, 12, 11 as fourth wave. The
fifth wave was composed of sixteen men from each company, carrying
tools and material.
The Battalion moved off in good time to reach assembly positions
and B Company was early in place, but the 26th Battalion had blocked
the sap leading from the tramline to assembly, and so prevented two
companies of the 25th Battalion from reaching their positions. The
27th Battalion was thus held up for some time. “A” Company even-
tually reached the position by moving over the front about 9 o’clock.
D Company then moved along the tramline trench, but C Company
was still in communication trench when zero time arrived.
. A and B Companies advanced and assaulted 0.G.1, both waves
easily reaching the objective. C and D Companies followed as far as
0.G.1. Some of the troops appear to have lost direction, an easily
explainable situation when it is realized that the Company was
crowded in a communication trench at right angles from the front
um when the advance commenced. I find that some men got
"Uxed with 25th and 26th Battalions on the left and 18th Battalion
°n the right.


PLAN OF POZIERES OPERATION


A, B, and D Companies soon completed the capture of 0.G.1,
and worked hard at consolidation throughout the night. Captain
Devonshire, the senior officer on this line, reported that about 4 a.m.
on the sth the enemy launched a counter-attack against 0.G.l from
two points R35b3i.l and R35b.8.3 simultaneously. The party on the
left in places gained bombing distance and damaged a Vickers
machine gun, but were repulsed by fire from machine guns, Lewis
gun, trench mortar, and rifle. The method adopted by the enemy
was to advance under a barrage of hand grenades. The enemy party
on the right did not make such good use of the partial darkness, and
were observed getting over the Parados into 0.G.2, and from there
they advanced along the C.T. R35b.7i.3 and across shellholes on
either side. They were checked and repulsed before they got within
90 yards of our position on O.G. 1 by Vickers, Lewis, and rifle fire.
The casualties to the enemy in this attack are estimated to be over
100, including two officers. The rest of the attacking force, about
60, surrendered. Patrols were then sent out to 0.G.2 and the wind-
mill, causing a few more casualties to the enemy. 0.G.2 was then
occupied. A Company of the 28th Battalion was sent to assist the
garrison. Lewis gun positions were selected in advance of 0.G.2,
and patrols examined the country in front, but no further enemy force
was discovered.
During the day, from about 7.30 a.m., the trenches 0.G.l and
0.G.2 were heavily shelled, an enfilade fire from the direction of
Thiepval was thrown across old No Man’s Land and the trenches
were shelled from the direction of Corsilette. This made the work of
consolidation very difficult.
It is of interest to note that the rapidity of movement of our
first and second waves from jumping off place to 0.G.l not only
avoided the enemy retalliation barrage, which was put down very
promptly, but also allowed our troops to reach the enemy trench
before it could be manned. Germans were intercepted coming up
from dugouts, some of them carrying machine guns. Our intense
bombardment had given some warning, but the speed of our advance
effectively countered them. Wire entanglements had been com-
pletely destroyed and much of the trench had been obliterated.
It can be said that the assault was practically unopposed, but
any delay in moving forward would have given time for the enemy
to have established a strong trench garrison. In the case of all dug-
outs guards were posted, and whenever resistance was offered bombs
were used to overcome the enemy. One dugout was set on fire and
e 'ght men surrendered from it.
It can be deduced that during the bombardment it is the custom
of the enemy to evacuate the trenches for the protective dugouts and
to take machine guns to safe cover, leaving only sentries and ob-
servers on duty.
It was noticed that the enemy carries two bayonets and a trench
r ‘fle, but no bayonets were found fixed on enemy rifles. Some short
carbines were found in 0.G.2.
Our estimated number of prisoners is 109.


Estimated casualties caused by our assaulting parties, 27th and
28th Battalions, is 350.
There did not appear to be many casualties from our artillery in
enemy lines.
During the afternoon of August sth instructions were received to
hand over 0.G.l and 0.G.2 to 48th Battalion, and to occupy 5.P.90
with Lewis gun and a small garrison, with remainder of Battalion in
tramline trench. The enemy shelled this area very heavily during the
following night.
Lack of sufficient communication trenches made it impossible for
all troops to be in position in time.
There was a distinct tendency for troops in third and fourth
waves to lose both direction and touch. There was a very prompt
retaliation to our intense fire. Smoke clouds used by neighbouring
troops did not appear to effect our immediate front.

COMING OUT FROM THE SOMME


CHAPTER X.
RESTING.
When the Battalion was relieved we were moved back to
Tara Hill, and next day took up our quarters in Albert, resting
here for one day, after which we marched back to Warloy,
where we were bivouacked in an orchard.
On August 9th a muster parade of the 7th Brigade was
held, when the G.O.C. inspected his command and read con-
gratulatory references to the exploits of the brigade in the
Pozieres Ridge success. An intimation was also given that
His Majesty King George the Fifth would next day pay us a
visit as he passed through on his way to Albert. Rain fell
during the morning, but the weather improved gradually, and
by the time His Majesty was due a glorious sunshine bright-
ened everything about the picturesque village. Early in the
afternoon the units composing the Brigade lined both sides
of the main thoroughfare, and waited with their “usual
patience” the arrival of Royalty. The parade was typically
Australian. Our recent participation in the push at Pozieres
had the usual battle effect on clothing and equipment. Short-
ages in every known article had occurred, the regimental
quarter-master was out of supplies, and it can readily be
imagined that the parade appearance was not “spick and span.”
Brigade, battalion, and company officers used every known
ruse and stratagem to improve the appearance of the parade,
•and one expedient resorted to was the placing of men with torn
clothing in the rear ranks. Safety-pins were in great demand,
and needles and thread were more or less deftly used to
enhance the general effect.
The place allotted to our Battalion was approximately
the centre of the village, and while waiting for the King’s
arrival many amusing incidents beguiled the tedium. One
be recounted. A very business-like old lady who ap-
peared to be the principal laundress of the village, halted her


vehicle, which was a barrow with long handles, outside a
chemist’s shop near one of our waiting lines, and while the
busy dame was delivering some of her handiwork a mischief-
making Digger tied the wheel of the barrow to the framework.
When the old lady attempted to resume her journey she
found some difficulty in making “the wheel go round.” After
a few attempts she desisted, bewildered, and the original joker
most gravely discovered the cause of the trouble, rectified it,,
and with a chivalry worthy of France itself, bowed her on
her way.
At last the waiting Battalions were called to attention,
the Royal party came into sight and passed between two
cheering lines of curious but enthusiastic Australians. Just as
His Majesty was passing the flank of our Battalion a member
of the 26th greeted him with a hearty shout of “Buck up,
George,” and the heartiness of this greeting and the evident
favour it found among those nearby, caused the King much
amusement.
On August 11th we were early astir and marched from
Warloy-Baillon at 5.30. These early morning excursions were
not very keenly appreciated by “the boys,” but once afoot they
were enthusiastic enough, and as in our unit we had busy
explorers who in our earlier march over the same route had
found out the alluring spots in the different villages, their
stories stirred up the ambitions of the more retiring members,
and they looked forward with eager anticipation to another
visit. We passed through Contay, all ranks contentedly sing-
ing the popular airs of “Landlord, have you any fine wine?”,
“If I were a nice young girl and, wanted to marry,” and other
most edifying ballads suitable only for route marches. We
halted for breakfast, and then resumed the march which ended
in La Vicogne, where we bivouacked in an orchard and
received a big batch of reinforcements. The next day we
moved on once more, and marched through miles of ripening
corn, till we reached the little village of Fieftes on a tributary
of the River Nieure.
During our stay here Colonel Dollman handed the
command of the Battalion over to Major Slane, and left, on
medical advice, for a prolonged rest owing to an injured knee.
The Battalion was refitted and reorganised, and training
was carried out for several days, and on August i6th marched
to Montrelet. On the 20th we left for another trip to the


front line, and billeted in Rebempre that night. From here we
marched to Vadencourt and camped in a wood about half a
mile from the village. Next morning all packs were sent to
Warloy to await our return from the front line, and our Bat-
talion marched on to Albert, and camped once more on the
old brickfields on the high ground west of the town. At 5.30
next morning we undertook the fatigue duty in connection
with a light railway, and then moved forward and again
occupied the trenches at La Boiselle. The weather conditions
were now bringing a good deal of discomfort. Continuous
rain, combined with persistent shell fire, kept the trenches in
a very unsatisfactory condition, and as many of the enemy
dead had been hastily buried hereabouts under trenches and
even in some of the parapets, the stench became at times
almost unbearable.
On August 27th the Battalion took over the front line
from the igth Battalion under cold and wet condi-
tions. The trenches were knee-deep in mud. At
10 o’clock the enemy made a bombing raid upon one
of our listening posts forward of what was known as
Peg Trench, and caused two serious casualties. All ranks
worked hard to improve the condition of the trenches,
but consistent rain made the task a heart-breaking job. On
the night August 29-30, intercompany relief was made, and
the work of improvement was carried on, everybody working
knee-deep in mud and water. During our occupation of the
position determined efforts were being made on our left to
capture Mouquet Farm, and the enemy kept up a consistent
shelling of our support and reserve lines, thereby hampering
operations considerably. On September Ist we had a burst of
sunshine, and it heralded the appearance of the Ist Battalion
of Canadians, who took over the line from us, and when
the relief had been completed we marched back very slowly
to Albert with a large percentage of cramped and frozen
feet. Fairly comfortable billets were allotted in Albert,
and after a restful night and decent hot meals we were ready
for the march back to Warloy, where we arrived during the
afternoon and found good accommodation awaiting us. On
September 3rd we moved on to Harponville, and while there
were paraded for General Birdwood, who made a presentation
of medals. Our next halt was at Amplier, and from here we
marched to Athieule, and were entrained for Godewaersvelde.
From this town we marched to Reninghelst, arriving there at
dawn on September 6th. Two days later we moved on to


Steenvoorde, and settled down to regular training once again,
special attention being given to tactical exercises in defence
and assault. In addition, special efforts were made to organise
battalion sports, and teams were selected to try conclusions
with other units. Of the many branches of sport which claimed
attention, none could command more interest and attention
than good old Australian football, and the 27th had many a
tussle with their good friends of the 28th. In the keenness of
the contests players and onlookers alike forgot for the moment
the solemn and serious side of the soldiers’ life, while they
cheered and encouraged their side to victory. On September
16th the 27th held a big sports programme, and visitors came
to criticise and admire from all the units of the Brigade.
During a tactical scheme which was being practised by
the Battalion on September 27th an incident of interest
occurred. The troops had reached their objective and were
arranging to signal the fact to accompanying aeroplanes when
an enemy “Taube” suddenly appeared. Our planes at once
left their part in the exercise uncompleted while they sped
after the intruder and drove hkn back to his lines On re-
turning to camp, the Battalion filled in its spare time with a
football match against the 28th, and was beaten, but a few
days later won the return game.
On the night of October 5-6 the Battalion moved out
and entrained for Ypres, and relieved the 19th Australian
Battalion, the sector taken over being due south of Zillebeke,
and covering the trench system of Hill 60 and Mount Sorrell.
This was our first visit to this part of the long battle line.
The associations connected with the world-famous city of
Ypres both before and during the war, gave us an interest in
our new surroundings, and revived feelings of admiration for
the gallant defenders of what was but a pile of ruins, and lit
afresh in our hearts the fire of resentment against the enemy
for their work of destruction. Close to our left lay Sanc-
tuary Wood, with its few remaining stumps, mute symbols of
war’s devastation. During our occupancy of the lines we
found things reasonably quiet, due doubtless to the wipter
conditions, which were now becoming more severe. The
troops worked hard in the repair and reconstruction of the
trenches, and energetic patrols moved about No Man’s Land
each night. On October 12th and 15th raids were undertaken
by parties from the Brigade, the first resulting in the capture
of prisoners and the acquirement of much valuable informa-


tion, and the second proving unsuccessful, as the wire had
not been cut sufficiently to permit of our entrance to the
enemy's lines. After our turn in the front line we moved
back into billets in the barracks of Ypres, which proved to be
very comfortable. Here we stayed until October 16th, and
took every opportunity of viewing the ruins of the historic
city, which was aptly described as “A City of the Dead.”
Ypres was a fortified town with a pre-war population of nearly
eighteen thousand, and was famous the world over for its
beautiful and ornate buildings, notably the Cloth Hall and the
Cathedral. Strong ramparts, 75 feet in width, guard
the approaches to the town, and these offered excellent facili-
ties for the quartering of reserve troops during the winter
months. On October 16th the 2nd Australian Division was
relieved by the 21st English Division, our Battalion handing
over to the 10th Northumberland Fusiliers. We were then
entrained to a point near the Ypres - Poperinghe Road, and
marched to St. Lawrence Camp, where we occupied wooden
huts until the 19th, when we left under wintry conditions for
Steenvoorde, passing through Poperinghe and Abeele, and
reaching camp at about 1 a.m. On the 21st we arrived at
Buysscheure, and next day moved to Mouile, where we had
comfortable billets for the next two days, after which we
entrained from Arques and reached Yaucourt-Bussus in the
early morning. On October 27th we started off at dawn, cold
and wet, and passing through Ailly we reached a point on the
Amiens Road and boarded motor lorries, which conveyed us
to Dernancourt, where we were billeted.


CHAPTER XI.
BACK TO THE SOMME.
Thus we made our second entry into the famous Somme
sector. The increment value of the recent Somme offensive
was that the British advance, extending approximately from
the north of the Ancre River and connecting with the French
at Peror.ne, had been most successfully carried to an average
depth of three miles.
Wretched weather conditions prevailed, the result of
heavy rains and the approach of winter months, which in this
year were almost unprecedented in their intensity. The whole
of the Somme area was one huge quagmire. Identification of
tracks, and even second-class roads, became extremely diffi-
cult, so the state of a freshly-dug front trench or position can
easily be imagined.
The enemy’s and the allies’ diverging centres, on this par-
ticular army front, were Bapaume and Albert respectively, a
slight advantage to the enemy.
At this critical stage of the offensive it became extremely
difficult even to the optimist, to grasp the actual value of our
recent successes. It became evident that we had re-entered
the field, as an actor in a new play, the success of which de-
pended entirely upon the effectiveness of the final act, all the
success of the recent advance depending entirely upon the
strength of the line to be definitely sited and consolidated, for
defensive purposes, throughout the oncoming winter. A much
shorter line became necessary and a series of minor operations
were essential to attain it. The infantry alone truly under-
stand the real meaning of “minor operations.” Meanwhile
the enemy strove hard to defer the definite conformation of
our front line system, but fortunately his efforts proved inef-
fective, though most interesting.


On October 29th, a party from “A” and “B” Companies
was detached from the Battalion, and under the command of
Bieut. Whyborn proceeded to Longueval, to assist the artil-
lery in carrying shells to the batteries in the vicinity of Flers
village. The remainder of the Battalion left Dernancourt on
November 2nd, and marched to Montauban Gamp, which was
situated on the Northern side of the Montauban-Mametz road,
in a veritable mud-hole.
Early in the morning of November 3rd, our C. 0., Colonel
Slane, accompanied by other 7th Brigade officers, reconnoi-
tered the sector shortly to be taken over by the Brigade, and
at 11 a.m. the Battalion, under the command of Major F. R.
Jeffrey, moved forward to Switch Trench, near High Wood,
and remained there until evening, when they again moved for-
ward and relieved the 53rd Battalion in the front line, “C” and
“D” Companies, under the command of Captain J. D. Elder
and Captain E. A. Warren, took over the right and left of our
front line respective!}’', and portions of “A” and “B” Com-
panies, under the command of Captain W. P. Devonshire,
D. 5.0., and Captain J. S. Malpas, the support and reserve
lines, the remainder of “A” and “B” Companies being still at-
tached to the artillery.
At 2 p.m. on the 4th orders were received that an attack
would be carried cut by the 7th Brigade on November sth at
9.10 a.m., the objective being Bayonet Trench, The Maze, and
Gird Trench, the object of which -was to shorten our line, en-
hance the value of our forward observation of the main Albert
Bapaume road, and incidentally deprive the enemy of his front
line observation posts. From right to left of the Brigade front
the attacking units were the 27th, 25th, and 28th Battalions.
On the right flank of the 27th Battalion the 6th Brigade, whilst
remaining in their trenches, were to bring a covering fire to
hear upon the enemy during our advance and incidentally
protect our flank.
During the night of the 4th/sth, the detached portions of
“A” and “B” Companies rejoined the Battalion from fatigue
duties, unfortunately receiving very little rest prior to the
battle and no opportunity whatever to view the sector and the
nature of the ground over which they had to advance. The
trenches were in a deplorable condition—the sides falling in
from time to time—and the earth became churned up prac-


ticaliy knee deep. The ground to be crossed was ploughed
up by shell fire, the extra large shell-holes being half-filled
with water. The enemy’s line was very strongly held, his
machine gun posts being splendidly sited, particularly on our
left flank, where a position conventionally termed “The Maze”
afforded a most commanding field of fire.
Collective intelligence reported that Bayonet Trench, on
our immediate sector, was being held by the 2nd Battalion of
the 3rd Guards Reserve Division (Prussian Guards), who pos-
sessed a splendid reputation as first-class assault troops.
Unfortunately complications arose in connection with the
approach movements of the 25th Battalion, which had not
reached the assembly positions by daylight, with the result
that the central attacking battalion was composed of men
from the 26th, 27th, and 28th Battalions. “B” Company of
the 27th Battalion, upon reporting to Colonel Walker, C.O, of
the 25th Battalion, shortly before 8 a.m., received orders to
attack and clean up the Maze.
At 9.10 a.m on Sunday, November sth, 1916, our boys, tired
but determined to test the fighting qualities of the enemy,
made their advance under the very lightest of artillery bar-
rages, meeting immediately with a withering fire from the
enemy strong points. As the advance took place during day-
light, the enemy gunners and snipers were able to use their
weapons with deadly effect, the close range adding to their
advantage. Large gaps were cut in the lines of advancing
troops, who, however, would not be denied, and gallantly rush-
ing forward, small parties were able to reach “Bayonet
Trench” and “The Maze.”
Lieut. W. Dickens, with “B” Company, entered the
enemy trench at the Maze, and fought the occupants to a
standstill. Included in this party were several 26th Battalion
troops, whose magnificent efforts proved of invaluable assist-
ance to our boys.
Meanwhile, on the right flank the enemy were successful
in bombing our parties out of the trench. The absence of a
reserve company left our flank exposed, and retirement to our
original position became inevitable, “C” Company’s Lewis
gunners performing heroic work in covering the movement.
By their coolness and splendid gunnery the casualties were

minimised. The sniping qualities of the enemy proved, in
some instances, fearful, many of the boys being so effectively
covered as to necessitate their remaining in shell-holes until
nightfall. On the left, the party of “B” Company, with two
Lewis guns, one of which was out of action, held grimly to the
captured trench, breaking up every determined effort of thet
enemy to retake the position, bombing with enemy ammuni-
tion as well as their own. Many daring and heroic deeds were
performed by this gallant party during the twenty-seven hours
it held the position, the work of Privates Royals and Prosser
being particularly worthy of mention. Private Prosser, with
a Lewis gun, stopped many rushes of the enemy, and Private
Royals made several trips to our rear lines to secure bombs t
When darkness set in many of the boys, some of whom were
slightly wounded, made their way back to our lines, and de-
spite the consistency of enemy machine gun fire, the work of
rescuing our wounded was carried on until dawn. The next
morning our casualties were found to be extremely heavy,'
only three company officers remaining.
During the morning advanced parties of the 17th Bat-
talion arrived, and at 10.30 p.m. our relief was effected. The
battalion moved back to Montauban Camp, where hot meals
and a well-earned rest awaited them.
During the battle our lads captured 25 prisoners, and our
roll call revealed the following casualties.. Officers—Killed,
5; v/ounded, 5. Other Ranks—Killed, 72; wounded, 136;
missing, 75. Total killed, 77; wounded, 141; missing, 75.
The killed included the following officers;—'Captain;
Warren, Lieutenants Sommerville, Olifent, Measday, Why-
born; and Lieutenants Guthrie and Rees subsequently died
,of wounds.
A medical inspection revealed the fact that 90 per cent,
of the men were suffering from cramp and trench feet, the
worst cases being evacuated to hospital.
From November 7th to the 14th we remained at Montau-
ban, carrying out fatigue work near Longueval.
The advance of the British on the Ancre, left of our sec-
tor, was making steady and successful progress, and on No-
vember 15th, after being issued with gum-boots and woollen


clothing, we marched to Longueval, resting in the vicinity of
Carlton Camp.
About 7,30 p.m., we relieved the 26th Battalion in the
front line, in approximately the same dispositions as prior to
the Flers battle.
On November 17th a much improved trench system was
decided upon, and we dug a shorter trench connection with’
the 28th Battalion on our left, later relieving the same Bat-',
talion by moving laterally into their position, in accordance
with a similar movement by the 24th Battalion on our right.
We were favoured in this venture, for almost immediately
following the completion of the new trench the snow began
to fall, completely hiding it from the view of the enemy.
A thaw set in during the evening of November 18th,
and the trenches gave way in places, many of the boys losing
their gum-boots in endeavours to extricate themselves from
the heavy mud.
No further advance was attempted, and that night we!
were relieved by the 17th Battalion.
This relief is usually referred to, by those who took part,
as the “retreat from Flers,” it being the most trying timej
ever experienced by the Battalion in similar operations.
The long march of over seven miles to Fricourt Camp,
through showers of rain and slush, the main roads connect- 1
ing Longueval, Montauban, and Fricourt being ankle deep
in mud, was one that will ever be remembered.
During the relief Lieutenants Forwood and Campbell
were seriously wounded and subsequently died.
At Fricourt camp, which consisted of hutments, hot meals
and blankets were issued to the men as they arrived. A good
sleep worked wonders with the men, and in a short time aIL
tanks looked fit again.


CHAPTER XII.
SOMME REST.
Leaving Fricourt at 9 a.m., November 21st, we marched
to Buire-sur-Ancrc, arriving at 1.30 p.m. Very frosty wea-i
ther followed the recent heavy rains, and the swamps in the
vicinity of Buire being frozen, the boys spent most of their
spare time skating. Amiens is situated about 14 miles S.W.
of Buire, and leave being available, many of the boys visited,
the famous town.
Very little of importance happened during our stay at
Buire, the main event being the burning of one of the 26th
Battalion’s billets in the main street. It was most amusing to
watch the Aussie Fire Brigade pumping water into the flames
v/hile their comrades at the rear of the billet were piling on
more wood to keep themselves warm.
On November 29 a party of one officer and 100 other
ranks, under the command of Capt. Bice, left the Battalion
and proceeded to the Meaulte sawmills, and were employed in
loading war material for the forward areas. The fatigue work
proved very trying, the weather conditions being very cold,
and many of the boys were evacuated to hospital with pneu-
monia. The party remained detached for nearly a month,
rejoining the Battalion December 24th. On November 30th we
left Buire and entrained near the Edgehill casualty clearing
station for Vignacourt, from which place we marched to St.
Vast-en-Chaussee, about six miles N.E. of Amiens. Here we
found fairly comfortable billets, but unfortunately our baths
were situated at Vignacourt.
Systematic universal training was carried on here as well
as the weather conditions would allow. Many great military
schemes were blessed and their projectors consigned to a much
warmer sphere, when, between the buffeting of the hands and
stamping of the feet, the boys endeavoured to memorise the
many different methods of attacking the enemy, who maybe

were suffering equal discomfort in learning to reciprocate.
However, better weather conditions favoured our schemes on
December 13th and 14th, when we practised a brigade in at-
tack. On the 17th a football match was played against our old
friends the 28th Battalion, and we won by 13 points.
On December 18th we marched to Vignacourt, and en-
trained for Buire-sur-Ancre, arriving at 1 p.m. the next day,
when the Battalion was inspected by General Legge, after
which we once more played the 28t’n Battalion, this time
being defeated.
On December 22nd we left Buire and marched via Becor-
dal to Fricourt Camp, being billeted in fairly comfortable
: - : Nissen huts, the next day receiving a boon in the shape of
Christmas parcels.
On the 24th we marched to Montauban, or, some might
say, we waded there. The mud had greatly increased since
our last occupation, and the camp was now a huge quagmire;
one step off the duck boards meant a re-appearance with the
next heavy rain. On Christmas Day, 1916, the Battalion car-
ried out fatigue duties in the forward areas, our Christmas
dinner consisting of tea “straight,” bully, and biscuits, while
at the Montauban camp the Battalion Band strafed Battalion
Headquarters with a few Christmas carols.
On December 28, B, C, and D Companies, under the com-
mand of Capt. Julge, M.C., left Montauban for D camp near
Bernafay Wood, where they supplied fatigue parties for cable
laying, A Coy. supplying a guard at Divisional. Headquarters,
Montauban. A number of the boys succeeded in keeping up
the usual New Year’s celebrations, despite the long and weary
trip to Albert to secure the necessary table decorations.
Although the intensely cold weather continued the re-
cently captured and devastated area was rapidly cleared, and
reserve camp soon sprang into existence, the Nissen huts
proving a boon to the units moving to and from the front line.
At night the transport lines situated on the slopes of the gully
between Bazentin-le-Grand and Montauban were easily found
by those in search of them, for, regulations notwithstanding,
and in complete defiance of the enemy, huge fires glowed from
end to end of the gully.

CHAPTER XIII.
GUEUDECOURT AND DELVILLE WOOD
AND LE SARS.
On January Bth, 1917, the Battalion relieved the 18th Bat-
talion in supports (Needle Trench) in the Gueudecourt sector,
the next day moving into the front line (Rose Trench) and
forward posts to relieve the 19th Battalion, our sector imme-
diately facing Le Transloy, which was held by the enemy.
B, C, and D Companies took over the front line, with A Coy.
in immediate support. No advance was attempted, but many
improvements were effected, especially in strengthening and
linking up the forward posts. Sgt. McCann carried out some
splendid patrol work, for which he was highly commended by
the Brigadier.
Quite a salvage campaign was commenced in the support
lines, all the old rifles and web equipment being conveyed to
a dump in rear. No visitor to the area, whether officer or other
rank, was allowed to return without carrying salvage of some
description; this stringent rule, as well as causing some amuse-
ment, brought a commendation from HQs.
On the night of January 12th we were relieved by the
28th Battalion, and after moving back to Delville Wood we
supplied further fatigue parties to continue the re-construction
of the Brigade front line system and dugouts in rear.
The nightly scene at Delville Wood was one never to be
forgotten. The Australian Comforts Fund, together with the
various soup kitchens, were always busy providing stimulants,
hot cocoa, coffee, and soup, to those moving to and fro between
the lines. What a value was placed on that small tin of cocoa,
the few biscuits, and, last but not least, the issue cigarette!
The whole area was one huge network of duck-board
tracks, broken here and there by direct hits by enemy shells.


These gaps were a source of annoyance to parties engaged,
during the night, in carrying material to the front line and
forward areas. Sometimes the leader of a party would dis-
cover the break in time to escape a none too complimentary
remark from those in rear, but more often his word of warning
would be mingled with a spluttering of mud from a shell
hole, and upon regaining the duck walk he would find himself
moving with another party following in rear of his own.
On January 15th we were relieved by the sth Brigade,
and marching to Montauban quarries entrained for Meaulte,
from which place we marched to Dernancourt and billeted
there for the night. The following day we moved to Buire-
sur-Ancre. Our boys were now quite accustomed to this quiet
little village, and it was pleasing to note the great eagerness
with which the inhabitants of these villages of the Ancre Val-
ley looked forward to the divisional reliefs.
From January 16th to the 28th the time was spent in
training in all methods of tactical warfare, practising also the
French methods of assault. During that period our companies
were reorganised, and the 7th Brigade moved to Mametz,
where we arrived at 12.30 p.m. on the 29th, the 27th Battalion
billeting in huts near Mametz Wood. On January 31st the
C. 0., with a percentage of officers and specialists, reconnoitred
the front line areas shortly to be taken over by the 7th Bri-
gade, and on February 2nd the 27th Battalion marched into
the line and relieved the 13th Battalion Royal Scots, in the
Le Sars sector, the Battalion being disposed as follows: Bat-
talion Headquarters, 26th Avenue; A and B Companies (front
line), Scotland trench; C Company (supports), Flers trench;
D Company (reserve), 26th Avenue.
The attitude in general on the Fourth Army front still
remained of an aggressive nature, despite the adverse weather
conditions, the main intention being to effect a line conforming
to the main Arras-Bapaume-Peronne road, the right flank, in
the vicinity of Gueudecourt, being already established.
Early morning mists considerably hampered the work of
ground and aerial observers, and the enemy artillery was par-
ticularly active, shelling our support and reserve areas the
whole time.
On February 6th we were relieved by the 25th Battalion,
Battalion Headquarters, with C and D Companies, moved to


Villa Camp, situated on the western side of the Contalmaison-
Martinpuich road, and A and B Coys, moved to Gun-pits road.
During our stay in this sector the Battalion Intelligence
Officer, Lieut. Maughan, was severely wounded, and on the
night of our relief one man was killed and four wounded. On
February 10th we marched to Scot’s Redoubt North Camp,
and took over from the 20th Battalion, which on the previous
night had had the misfortune to lose five men killed and sev-
eral severely wounded as a result of an enemy air raid, Scot’s
Redoubt was situated on the western side of the Contalmaison-
Fricourt road, midway between the villages.
From February 10th to the 14th drill and tactical work
was carried on, also tuition in bombing was received at a
bombing school nearby. On February 14th we marched to the
line and relieved the 22nd Battalion, constituting left Bat-
talion, right Brigade sector. A and B Coys, took over the for-
ward posts immediately facing the famous Butte-de-Warlen-
court, with C and D Coys, in supports and reserve.
The Butte, at this time practically in No Man’s Land,
afforded an excellent aiming point for the enemy’s and our
artillery, and the ground surrounding it was a series of deep
shell holes almost full of water. Owing to our intended ad-
vance very little was done in consolidation. On February
16th C and D Coys, relieved A and B Coys, in the line. The
artillery on both sides was extremely active during our occu-
pation, but fortunately no serious casualties resulted. On the
night of the 18th we were relieved by the 25th Battalion, and
moved back to Sussex Camp, situated east of Scot’s Redoubt,
moving four days later to Fricourt Camp, where we billeted in
huts, the condition of which was greatly improved by our
fatigue parties.
Consequent upon the recent successful advance of the
British north of the Ancre, the enemy were reported to be
evacuating Gallwitz Trench and Warlencourt village, posi-
tions immediately opposite Scotland Trench, now being held
by the 6th Brigade.


CHAPTER XIV.
WARLENCOURT.
On the night of February 26th-27th we successfully re-
lieved the 24th Battalion, which had taken possession of the
recently evacuated line. The Battalion was disposed as fol-
lows : Battalion Headquarters, Le Sars; A and B Coys, (front
line), Warlencourt; C Coy. (supports), Galiwitz Trench; D
Coy. (reserves), Scotland Trench.
Immediately after taking over, our reconnaissance patrol
reported the enemy in strength and in occupation of Malt
Trench, the report being confirmed by the patrols of the Sth
Brigade on our immediate right. The increment value of the
harassing of the enemy by the Australian and British troops
on the Somme front from November, 1916, to the present
period, now became clear, and although the extent of the
enemy’s evacuation could not be definitely discovered, he was
reported to be holding the Grevillers Line and Malt Trench
with specially selected troops, and his retirement through
Bapaume would be covered by their rearguard actions.
On the night of 27th-28th, Capt. Gould, O.C. of B Coy.,
was wounded by shellfire, and later an attempt was made to
enter Malt Trench. A party of 50 men from A and B Coys.,
under the command of Lieut. W. L. Davies, advanced to the
junction of Loupart road and Loos cut, where it was split into
two, one party under Sgt. Lockwood to advance along Loupart
road and the other, under Lieut. Davies, along Loos cut. Both
parties, however, met with a stout resistance, and the attempt
was abandoned. During the following day a party of 65 men
uf C Coy., led by Lieut. L. V. Parkes, made another attempt
to enter Malt Trench, but owing to the failure of our artillery
to cut the wire, and the fierce machine gun fire, the attempt
Was again abandoned, our casualties being three killed and
twenty wounded. It now became necessary for a much wider
Plan of attack, and on March 1 we received orders to partici-


PLAN OF WARLENCOURT OPERATION MARCH 2ND 1917.


pate in a combined attack by the sth and 7th Brigades. On
our left flank the 26th Battalion was to attack Malt Trench
frontally from the intersection of Malt and Gamp trenches to
the Loupart road, D Coy., 27th Batt., under the command of
Capt. Julge to enter Malt Trench at Loupart and bomb along
to connect with the 17th Battalion on the right, zero hour
being 2.30 a.m. on March 2nd, 1917.
The Battle.
At 3 a.m. our barrage was put down upon the objective,
lifting beyond it seven minutes later. Our boys then attacked
in great style, gaining the first 130 yards in quick time. Lieut.
Botten, whilst most courageously leading his men, was killed,
and Captain Julge severely wounded.
The enemy now partially succeeded in flanking the move-
ments of our troops on the left of D Company, who were
forced to return to Loupart road for more bombs.
All available men in Warlencourt were organised and sent
forward by Capt Devonshire to retrieve the situation. After
connection with the right of the 26th Battalion had become
established the party under Lieuts. Davies and Lampard
moved along Malt Trench to the right to assist in the connec-
tion with the sth Brigade. Meanwhile Lieuts. Caldwell and
Lucas were killed by a shell in Loupart road.
A thick mist had now settled over the position, and the
party moving along the trench garrisoned the strong points
as they were captured, and after some heroic and splendid
bombing by Cpl. Duggan and his party, connection with the
sth Brigade was eventually established. Owing to the mist
bombs were exchanged between the connecting parties, but
Cpl. Duggan becoming suspicious, gallantly moved forward to
investigate, and thereby prevented unnecessary casualties.
Under cover of the mist a trench 500 yards long and 6 feet
deep was dug unseen by the enemy, who were in occupation of
the Grevillers line. During the engagement 22 prisoners were
captured and about 60 of the enemy killed, our casualties being
3 officers and 22 other ranks killed, 1 officer and 95 other
ranks wounded.
As in the previous Somme battles, our men fought and
behaved splendidly, and despite the intensely cold weather and
the difficult nature of the ground they had to traverse, the
stretcher bearers toiled hard to effect the immediate relief of
the wounded.


On March 4th we were relieved by the 25th Battalion,
and moving back became support battalion, being disposed as
follows: Battalion Headquarters, Le Sars; C and D Com-
panies, Scotland Trench; A and B Companies, Flers (support).
Two days later we were again relieved by the 25th Bat-
talion, and became reserve battalion, with Battalion Head-
quarters at 26th Avenue, C and D Companies, 26th Avenue,
A and B Companies, Gunpit Road.
On March 7th the enemy heavily shelled A and B Com-
panies’ position, killing two men and wounding four. The
following day we relieved the 26th Battalion at Le Sars, again
constituting support battalion, and disposed as on the pre-
vious occasion, with the exception of D Coy., which occupied
positions in Aqueduct road.
On the night of March 10th we were relieved by the 17th
Battalion, and marched back to Becourt camp, situated a mile
and a half east of Albert. From the 11th to the 18th the Bat-
talion was engaged in re-organising its companies and train-
ing in mobile warfare. While thus occupied a report reached
us that the enemy had evacuated the Grevillers Line, and was
retiring through Bapaume. A few days later we received the
official report of the fall of Bapaume, and the Australians’
advance 1,000 yards east of the town.
On March 19th we left Becourt at 12.30 p.m., marching
via La Boiselle, Pozieres, and Le Sars to Le Coupe-Gueule,
and arriving at 10.30 p.m., bivouacked in tents for the night.
All main roads leading to Bapaume were packed with moving
guns and material, urgently needed to follow closely upon the
heels of the retreating enemy.
On the main Albert-Bapaume road, close to La Coupe
Gueule, the enemy had left a huge crater, thereby impeding
our advance. At 2 p.m. on the 20th the Battalion, less D
Coy., which had been attached to the engineers for road
repairs, again moved forward, marching through Bapaume at
3 p.m. The town was partially in ruins, and still burning as
we passed through en route to Beugnatre, a ruined village
N.N.E. of Bapaume. Working parties were busily engaged
in clearing the main streets of Bapaume of all debris likely to
impede the traffic. The town hall still remained, but a few
days later it was entirely demolished by a clock-timed mine
left by the enemy, a number of troops being buried in the
ruins.

CHAPTER XV.
LAGNICOURT.
Upon reaching Beugnatre we found few of the buildings
intact, and we bivcuacked, for a few hours of rest, in the ruins
and outskirts of the village, while three officers reconnoitred
forward and some of the boys forming stretcher-bearing
parties helped to bring the wounded back to Beugnatre. At 7
a.m. on Monday, March 21st, we moved to Vaulx-Vraucourt,
about two miles distant.
Vaulx was being heavily shelled at intervals, but the Bat-
talion rested in the vicinity, and at nightfall relieved the 26th
Battalion in the front line, N.E. of the village, A, B, and C
Companies relieving B, C, and D Coys, of the 26th Battalion,
while Battalion Headquarters occupied a position near the
Crucifix in the sunken portion of the Vaulx-Beugny road. We
were now holding a line about 1,000 yards S.W. of Lagnicourt
and Noreuil.
Vaulx village, although partially in ruins and subjected
to heavy shell fire, afforded sufficient protection for our com-
pany’s cookers, who were billeted there.
On the next day the enemy’s artillery and aircraft was
very active, one man being killed and one officer and five other
ranks wounded. During the afternoon a distinguished enemy
airman, Prince Charles of Prussia, whilst attempting a recon-
naissance of our rear lines, was engaged and brought down by
our aircraft. After landing safely and close to our lines, he
attempted to reach the enemy’s trench, with the result that
he was severely wounded and died some days later. His
unique plane, richly painted sky blue and vividly ornamented
with a skull and cross bones, was salvaged practically intact
hy the Air Force.
On March 23rd one of our B. Coy’s posts completely sur-
prised some of the enemy, killing three and wounding several


others, our casualties being one killed and five wounded. A
projected attack by the 7th Brigade upon Lagnicourt and
Noreuil, to take place on the 23rd, was postponed. During
the night Sgt. Teesdale (scout sergeant) was accidentally
shot whilst returning from patrol work. Well known and much
esteemed throughout the whole brigade, his death was keenly
felt by all.
On the 24th, during the relief of A Coy. by C Coy. in the
front line, nine men were wounded by shrapnel. The follow-
ing day the 25th Battalion on our left took over the left post
of B Coy., which company then relieved C Coy. in the forward
posts. During the day final orders were received for the 7th
Brigade attack upon Lagnicourt, zero hour being 5 a.m. on
March 26, 1917. The following is a brief outline of the 7th
Brigade attack: The advanced guard of the 7th Brigade to
attack Lagnicourt and establish a line approximately 300 yards
beyond the northern and eastern edge of the village. The
left brigade of the sth Australian Division, in conforming to
the movement by an attack east of Morchies and Beaumetz
would protect the right flank, and the 7th English Division,
holding the line west of Noreuil to St. Ledger, the left flank.
The 7th Brigade order of attack was, the 26th JBattalion plus
two companies of the 28th Battalion, to attack and consolidate
beyond Lagnicourt, the 27th Battalion to attack the sunken
road leading from Noreuil to Lagnicourt, and the 25th Bat-
talion to remain stationary pending an advance by the 7th
English Division on Longatte. The two remaining companies
of the 28th Battalion in reserve at Vaulx.
The Battle.
At 5.15 a.m. on March 26, 1917, A and C Coys., 27th Bat-
talion, following a perfectly timed artillery barrage, attacked
in two waves, the first being led by Lieuts. Davies and Dur-
din, and the second by Lieuts. Ward and Burton, reading from
left to right of the movement. Our objective was reached and
captured at 5.40 a.m., the prisoners being immediately sent
back. A windmill, or ruins of such, was included in our objec-
tive, this being the second captured by the 27th Battalion, the
first one being at Pozieres, August 4, 1916. Upon reaching
the objective Lieut. Davies realised that during the advance
his left flank had closed in, so, moving along the road to
Noreuil he established a post on higher ground. The enemy
by this time had realised that no advance had been attempted

DIRECTION OF ATTACKS SHOWN BY ARROWS


left of the 27th Battalion, and immediately began a reconnais-
sance of our left flank, with the result that a series of attacks
were launched against our posts. Thanks to the speedy and
collective liaison between those in command, and the in-
dividual bravery of the boys of A and C Coys., all attempts
made by the enemy to attack the rear of our movement were
completely repulsed until a defensive connection became estab-
lished with B Coy., which had cleverly kept in touch and
refuged the left flank. Capt. Bice, O.C. A Coy., called for
artillery support to deal with the enemy rushes, which prin-
cipally came from the partially sunken road leading in Noreuil,
and shortly after receiving same the enemy’s attacks ceased.
Capt. Frederiecks, with C Coy., on the right, still held to
his objective, as did the 26th Battalion, which had captured
Lagnicourt and successfully consolidated. The splendid con-
duct of Sgt. Adair, Cpl. Biggs, and Ptes. Stone, Pridham, and
Oakley, of our Battalion, was worthy of great praise, each
volunteering to carry out the most hazardous of duties
throughout the battle.
Our new line was subjected to very heavy shelling
throughout the remainder of the day, especially in the vicinity
of Lagnicourt Windmill, but despite the numerous casualties
the boys held their positions splendidly until relieved the
same night by the 20th Battalion. Upon the completion of our
relief we moved back to rest in the vicinity of Vaulx-Vrau-
court. Our casualties during the engagement were 11 killed
and 29 wounded.
On March 27th, in accordance with the relief of the 7th
Brigade by the sth and 13th Brigades, the 27th Brigade left
Vraucourt and marched via Bapaume, Le Sars, and Martin-
puich to Bever camp, Bazentin, a long and trying march of
fourteen miles, reaching the camp at 8 p.m. The next day we
left Bazentin at 11 a.m. and marched to Scot’s Redoubt South,
and camped in very comfortable huts. A bathing parade and
a general clean up was greatly appreciated, and as a result of
the series of training and recreational exercises generally in-
dulged in, the boys soon began to look fit and well again.
March, 1917, was really a very unlucky month for the Bat-
talion. There was a considerable depletion in strength of per-
sonnel, the month’s casualties being 45 killed, 170 wounded,
and 95 sick to hospital.


On March 30th a very unfortunate incident occurred.
Whilst a course of practice in bombing was being carried out,
Cpl. Henley was killed and Lieut. Parkes wounded.
During our divisional rest at Scot’s Redoubt most of the
spare time was spent in Albert, where some very good shows
were given by the various Australian concert parties. April
11th found us still at Scot’s Redoubt, and despite the bitterly
cold weather, the boys continued football.
The Battalion team again met and defeated the 28th Bat-
talion. Probably this was the most unique game of football
ever contested. The ground was situated amidst the heavy
system of entrenchments that constituted the German front
line prior to the great Somme offensive of July, 1916. The
famous La Boisselle crater, the blowing up of which was the
signal for the advance, was about 1,100 yards away. Practi-
cally surrounded by trenches, the ground was frozen and
strewn with pieces of barbed wire and fragments of shells.
Sheltering from the cold wind, the spectators viewed the game
from the trenches, their heads just visible above the ground.
A few plucky volunteers held the goal posts in position during
the game.
F


CHAPTER XVI.
BULLECOURT.
On April 11, 1917, the strength of the Battalion was increased
by the arrival of 140 reinforcements and details. The following
day many conflicting reports reached us concerning the recent
attack on the Hindenburg Line in the neighbourhood of
Bullecourt by the 4th Australian Division. On April 13th we
received orders that the 2nd Division would relieve the 4th
Division in the left sector of the corps front during the 12th,
13th, and 14th of April; the 7th Brigade to relieve the 13th
and 14th Brigades in the Beugnatre area on the 14th.
At 9 a.m., April 14th, the 27th Battalion left Scot’s Re-
doubt south and marched via Pozieres and Bapaume to Favreuil
where we camped principally in tents. The following night
“A” and “B” Coys., with Lieut. Hunter in command, pro-
ceeded to Noreuil and together with the 7th Coy. of A.
Engineers put out a line of wire in advance of our front posts,
east of the village.
From the 16th to the 18th working parties of the Battalion
were engaged in repairing roadways between Favreuil and
Vaulx and carrying material to the front line.
On April 19th orders were received that the 7th Brigade
would relieve the sth and 6th Brigades in the Divisional front
on the night of 19th/20th of April.
About 8 o’clock the same night the 27th Battalion, less 5
officers and 33 per cent, of specialists, left Favreuil and
marched via Vaulx to Noreuil and relieved the 20th Battalion
in the line north-east of the village and immediately facing the
village of Riencourt-le Cagnicourt and the famous Hinden-
burg Line.
Consequent upon the recent attack upon the Hindenburg
Line by the 4th Division and the tremendous counter attack


by the enemy on Noreuil and Lagnicourt which, after partially
succeeding, was completely repulsed and all lost ground re-
gained, we found our Divisional front strongly held by the
sth and 6th Brigades.
In relieving the 20th Battalion the 27th took over the
central Battalion sector, with the 28th Battalion on the right,
relieving the 19th Battalion, and the 25th Battalion on the
left relieving the 22nd and 24th Battalions, leaving the 26th
Battalion in reserve at Noreuil.
On the 27th’s sector “B” and “D” Coys, were the right
and left companies, with “A” and “C” Companies in supports
and reserve. The front line was the “cutting” on the heavy
railway line running from Queant to Ecoust St. Mein, with a
series of forward posts in the sunken road between Bullecourt
and Queant.
We found many of the enemy’s dead between our front
and support lines and several of our own 4th Division whom
we reverently buried during the night. The success attained
by the enemy artillery against the tanks assisting the 4th
Australian Division’s attack on the Hindenburg Line was
plainly evident; two still remained derelict in our lines; one
forward of the railway line left of “D” Company and the other
on the high ground forward of our support line. The latter
was consistently shelled by the enemy who rightly suspected
it of being an observation post. It will be of interest to those
who occupied the support line to know that the tank, together
with the trenches in the vicinity, was practically obliterated
by the tremendously heavy artillery barrage that preceeded
the enemy offensive of March 21st, 1918.
In view of the intended attack upon the Hindenburg Line
by the 2nd Australian Division, very daring attempts were
made to destroy the heavy belts of wire entanglements protec-
ting the enemy trench and strong posts.
The method adopted was to place long tubes, called
“Bangalore Torpedoes.” filled with very high explosive, under
the series of entanglements selected and discharge them by
the aid of time fuses.
With the exception of April 21st when six men were
wounded, the front line received very little shelling, most of it
being confined to our support lines and battery positions in
rear of Noreuil.


During the afternoon of April 25th a machine gun posi-
tion in the vicinity of our Battalion Headquarters received a
direct hit from a 5.9 shell which caused many casualties. The
wounded were deftly dealt with by our R.M.0., Capt.
Brownell. A few days later the occupants of this post
avenged their comrades by bringing down an enemy plane
between our front and support lines, the pilot of which was
seriously wounded and received attention at the 27th Aid Post.
On the 28th quite a stir was caused in the trenches by
the voting in connection with the Australian general elections.
During the night A and C Coys, were relieved by B and D
Coys, in the right and left line positions. Preparations were
being speedily arranged for an attack on the Hindenburg Line,
and a new 27th Battalion Aid Post was constructed in the
Ncreuil-Bullecourt sunken road.
On the night of April 30 we received orders that on the
night preceding the attack, the 7th Brigade would be relieved
in the line by the sth and 6th Brigades, the 27th Battalion to
remain and hold the present right sector of the front, together
with a new series of strong posts, which were to be dug on
the same night, to protect the right flank of the attack, the
26th Battalion to hold the left sector, both units to come under
the temporary command of the G.O.C. the 6th Brigade.
On May 1 the 27th Battalion Headquarters moved for-
ward to A Coy.’s Headquarters, in the sunken road N.E. of
Noreuil. On the 2nd, final orders were issued for the attack.
The sth and 6th Brigades were the right and left attacking
brigades cn the 2nd Divisional front. On the left of the 6th
Brigade a simultaneous attack was to be made upon Bulle-
court by the 62nd English Division, 'fhree objectives were
laid down, extending on the 2nd Divisional front, beyond
Riencourt-le-Cagnicourt.
Owung to the magnitude of the attack and to the fact that
no advance was intended to the right of the 2nd Divisional
sector, the Ist Australian Infantry Brigade was attached to
the 2nd Division during the operation, two battalions being
disposed in the Morchies-Vaulx line and two battalions in the
Beugny-Ytres line.
The zero hour was afterwards given for 3.30 a.m. on May
3rd, 1917.


At dawn on the morning of the 3rd the attack opened,
and following our magnificent artillery and machine gun bar-
rage, the sth and 6th Brigades attacked the famous Hinden-
burg Line. Enemy S.O.S. signals were sent up along the
whole line, and a prompt artillery action followed, the bulk of
the shelling falling heavily upon our front and support lines.
The 6th Brigade appeared to be making successful pro-
gress, success being fired from the first trench of the Hinden-
burg Line, but it soon became evident that the sth Brigade,
and the right of the 62nd English Division, were held up, and
as a result the enemy artillery concentrated upon the 27th’s
advanced posts and the railway cutting, inflicting many casual-
ties, meanwhile the enemy made several determined counter-
attacks against those of the sth Brigade, who occupied the
Hindenburg Line, but fortunately with no better result than
to inflict heavy casualties among their own numbers.
The 62nd English Division made another assault upon
Bullecourt, and our reserve battalions (25th and 28th) also
advanced. After sharp fighting the first objective on the left
divisional sector was captured, and incidentally the left flank
of the 6th Brigade was safeguarded. Our casualties on the
divisional front were extremely heavy, the bulk of them being
carried back to the 27th Battalion Aid Post in the Noreuil-
Bullecourt road, which was soon lined with stretchers contain-
ing wounded, many of whom received additional wounds dur-
ing the heavy shelling of the road by the enemy. The courage
and unselfishness of Capt. Brownell and the A.M.C. in dealing
with casualties in our previous battles were always a byword
throughout the Battalion, but the magnificent work done on
this occasion was certainly without parallel. Regardless of
extremely heavy shell fire and assisted by Cpl. Chambers and
Ptes. Plumphreys and Pearce, Capt. Brownell attended to
some 1,600 cases during the first twenty-four hours. During
the night of the 3rd the road was subjected to gas shelling
by the enemy, and gas masks had to be rapidly adjusted on
all helpless cases. All day and night the stretcher-bearers
worked unceasingly in their efforts to evacuate the wounded,
their tracks being consistently shelled by the enemy, and
many bearers were killed and a greater number wounded.
Capt. Brownell collected all the food possible, and enlisted the
aid of some 6th Brigade cooks to prepare hot drinks, etc., for
the wounded. For the magnificent part played by him during
the operation, Capt. Brownell was deservedly awarded the


D. 5.0., and the news of his promotion to major was greeted
with satisfaction by all ranks.
Throughout the night a re-adjustment of the line resulted
in the 27th Battalion retaining its front line and series of pro-
tective posts, dug on the night of the 2nd-3rd (again under the
command of the G.O.C. the 7th Brigade. On our left the 28th
Battalion held the newly captured trenches (0.G.l and 0.G.2)
linking up with the 6th Brigade, which, together with our 25th
Battalion, was relieved the same night by three battalions of
the Ist Brigade. On the morning of the sth the relief of the sth
Brigade by the 3rd Brigade, released the 28th Battalion from
the line, thus leaving the 27th as the only representative of the
7th Brigade in the divisional front line. During the afternoon
a shell burst close to our Battalion Headquarters, causing
eight slight casualties.
On the nights of the sth-6th and 6th-7th, after 18 days’
continuous front line duty, we were relieved by the 25th Bat-
talion, and moved to the Lagnicourt-Noreuil line of nucleus
posts, the very position from which the series of counter-
attacks were launched by the enemy against us during the
battle of Lagnicourt.
The following night a working party of 150 men from A
and C Coys., under the command of Lieut. Davies, dug a new
fire trench in front of our previous front line position west of
Queant, two men being wounded during the work. On the
night of Bth-9th of May the 7th Brigade was relieved by the
14th Brigade. The 27th Battalion, on being relieved by the
54th Battalion, marched to a tented camp on the north side
of the Bapaume-Beugnatre road, close to Bapaume. The next
day we marched into Bapaume and entrained, on the light
railway, for Bazentin, where we detrained and marched to
Scot’s Redoubt South, and were all comfortably billeted in
Nissen huts by 5 p.m.
After a good rest and clean up the boys showed few signs
of their recent long and trying front line experiences, during
v/hich time they had tried conclusions with the very cream of
the German Army. It was always amusing to listen to the
opinions exchanged between the boys as to the merits of the
enemy, but on this occasion they were unanimous in their un-
stinted praise of the famous 3rd Guards Division and the
fight they put up against us.


Captured enemy intelligence detailed the tremendous suc-
cesses attained by these famous troops on the Eastern front,
and incidentally contained a magnificent tribute to the audaci-
ous and forceful fighting qualities of the Australians whose
characteristics in general were most amusingly described by
the German higher command. The following is a translation
of an address delivered by the German Emperor to the 3rd
Guard Infantry Division, which opposed the Ist Anzac Corps
in the Bullecourt Sector, between May sth and 17th, 1917,
losing in its repeated and unsuccessful counter-attacks 250
prisoners and many hundreds killed and wounded.
I welcome the individual troops of the 3rd Guard Infantry Divi-
sion to the Western theatre of the War.
The 3rd Guard Infantry Division has, to my great delight, in
keeping with her formation and origin, accomplished splendid deeds
in the course of the war. The severe fighting in the Carpathians, the
pre-winter campaigns and the winter campaigns themselves form a
sequence of glorious pages in the history of the different regiments,
I have not seen the Fusiliers since the Doeberitz days of spring,
1914. But what you have learnt in the long years of peace you have
now, to my greatest satisfaction, carried out in the field against the
enemy under all sorts of conditions. And for those deeds, I, your old
Brigade Commander and All-Highest War Lord, give you special
recognition. By my orders you have been transferred from the East
to the West, you military “Cockchafers,” so that you can show the
enemy that military springtime has indeed commenced for him.
The Lehr Infantry Regiment I greet to-day for the first time in
its present establishment. Originally a battalion, reflecting to a certain
extent the image of my entire army, it has always had the honour to
protect the King and his family and to be in daily personal contact
with him. It is the link between the Guard and the entire Prussian
Army. In accordance with its eminently military origin, the regiment
has fought magnificently, and I congratulate it.
And you, Kolobergers! We have met—“ Out East”—but now I
have brought you here. Your bravery, which you displayed so bril-
liantly, will never be forgotten. You have writ the lav/ to the enemy
in words of iron, and it will be a long while before he forgets you,
Pomeranians. The Battle of Siemkowice will ever be honourable and
illustrious in the history of your regiment, just as the battles of the
Carpathians and of the Zwinin will always be connected with the
history of the “Cockchafers” Regiment.
The remaining arms of the Division—the cavalry and the artil-
lery, especially the artillery—have assisted the infantry in all their
fighting and have rendered them the assistance they need, and that
I expect of them in this type of warfare.


Thus the whole Division in all its splendid constitution and with
its excellent reputation, has now been summoned here to co-operate
in the great, task of defeating our enemies. You will meet here a foe
who fights differently—l;e is tougher, more obstinate, skilful, and
intelligent. He is defending every inch of the country, and we hold
him in deep respect for that. His resistance is desperate. But it must
be broken. He has made his bed and must now lie on it, and you will
help me force him to do it.
Let us hope that the appearance of the 3rd Guard Division will
ere long make him realise the type of soldier he has to deal with, and
may God who has stood by each one of you in many a dark hour,
lead us on to Victory and to the Peace we all desire.
I need your help for that.
Training was commenced on the 11th, and the following
day our Battalion football team again met and defeated the
2Sth Battalion.
During the visit of King Albert of Belgium to the Fifth
Army, a royal guard of honor was supplied by the 7th Bri-
gade, which consisted of two subalterns and 25 other ranks
from each battalion, under the command of Capt. P. G. Bice,
27th Battalion. The guard was mounted in the Place-Faid-
kerbe, in the famous town of Albert. To the strains of the
Belgian National Anthem, played by the 7th Brigade Band,
the famous King of the Belgians inspected the guard. In
conversation with Capt. Bice he expressed great pleasure in
being afforded the opportunity of inspecting his first Austra-
lian guard, and was most eulogistic when commenting upon
the physique and bearing of the men who had been so recently
relieved from the trenches.
The same day we received orders that the 2nd Australian
Division, less artillery, would move to the Senlis area on the
17th and 18th of May.


CHAPTER XVII.
BACK TO CIVILIZATION.
On May 18th the 7th Brigade marched from Scot’s Re-
doubt to Senlis, N.W. of Albert, all units being billeted at
Scnlis, with the exception of the 26th Battalion, which was
disposed at Bouzincourt. Whilst training in all methods of
warfare was carried on, spare time was devoted principally to
cricket and special training in connection with the Brigade
sports, the boys all training hard for the right to represent
their particular Battalion in the Brigade programme.
The clean sportsmanship displayed, throughout these
eventful meetings was only equalled by the splendid comrade-
ship and unity that characterized the same men when engaged
in the sterner duties of war, and these sterling qualities were
responsible in a large measure for the brilliant achievements
of the Brigade throughout the many intricate and tedious
operations in which it participated.
Bomb throwing, rifle grenade firing, and platoon drill
were always among the most interesting of the sports events,
but keen rivalry was displayed by the various Battalion
cookers for cleanliness, etc.
Although over 14 miles from Amiens, leave was granted
to a percentage of men daily to visit that town, a special
“leave train” running from Albert for the purpose. Many of
the men, however, preferred to motor lorry as a means of
transport, even at the risk of having weary miles to walk when
the lorries failed them. During this time a peculiar epidemic,
afterwards designated “trench fever,” became prevalent
throughout the Battalion; a large number of men having to be
evacuated to hospital or observation camp. For reasons never
fully explained to us we experienced a very unwelcome
change in vegetable diet, nettles being substituted for cabbage.
The only feasible explanations throughout the Battalion were


that the R.Q.M. was keeping a reserve stock of cabbages for
the coming May 31st anniversary, or that it was a stimulant
for the cross country runners in the Brigade sports.
May 31st—the anniversary of the Battalion’s departure
from Australia—was most cordially celebrated by the boys.
The officers held a dinner at Battalion Headquarters, and
the N.C.O.’s did likewise in the Sergeants’ Mess. The few
remaining “Dinkums” gathered together in the village
estaminets as though by common instinct. Here, over drinks
ranging from “whizz bangs” to champagne, reminiscences
were exchanged and the principal events from the very for-
mation of the unit in turn recalled and discussed.
The trip on the old “Geelong” is so vividly described as
to make us feel thirsty from the salt air. More drinks follow
the descriptions of life on Gallipoli, and the long route
marches across the sands of Egypt; harrowing recollections
that would melt the heart of even the most ardent prohibi-
tionist.
Christmas Day, 1915, is humorously recalled, also the
strange disappearance of the rum that must have been so
much overprdof as to cause it to jump clean out of the jar.
Then follow the reminiscences of battles so largely
responsible for the depletion of the ranks, and there is a
slight moisture in the eye and a catch in the voice when old
identities such as good old “Ben,” “Freddie,” “Lizzie,” “Alf,”
and numerous others are referred to. The tributes of these old
campaigners to their departed comrades are genuine, and
would cheer the hearts of sorrowing relatives were they but
privileged to hear.
The hours roll on during which a few modern ditties are
sung and much amusement is derived from watching the
wonderful comradeship so characteristic of these rough
diamonds. Each one suffering a little from “vertigo,” would
be politely conveyed to his billet and put to bed, carefully or
roughly, according to the number of Germans he thought he
could see.
On June 2nd the Brigade sports were commenced, and
practically the whole Brigade group was present, each event
being followed with keen interest.


The 27th carried off a fair number of prizes for events
which included stretcher bearing, rifle grenade firing, and
bayonet fighting.
Among the decoration gazetted that day for the Bulle-
court operations, were the following Battalion officers:—
Major H. P. Brownell, D. 5.0.; Capt. W. S.
M.C.; Lieut. K. R. Crewes, M.C.
The Brigade sports were continued on June 4th, when most
of the transport and horse events were decided, and on the 6th
our Battalion football team played the 28th Battalion in
accordance with the sports programme, and after an exciting
game the 28th Battalion won.
On June 9th we marched to Ribemont to try conclusions
at football with our formidable South Australian rivals, the
10th Battalion, which laid claim to 62 consecutive victories.
Our team was conveyed to the scene of action in “G.S.”
waggons. The football ground was situated on the high
ground immediately west of the village and overlooking the
beautifully-timbered valley of the Ancre.
Contrary to all expectations we won a clean and well-
contested game, and so checked their long run of success.
Immediately following the match our team was entertained
by the 10th Battalion, and we marched back to Senlis. It is
not recorded v/hether the waggon in which the team returned
travelled via the road or the trenches and shellholes, but it
was discovered next day that the players had sustained more
bruises as a result of the ride than they did during the match.
On June 14th the Battalion was engaged in a tactical
scheme which included the capture of Mesnil, and a most
interesting day was concluded by a swim in the Ancre River
close to Aveluy.
On June 14th we received orders, in connection with the
relief of the sth Australian Division (then in reserve to the
IV. Corps) by the 2nd Australian Division, for the 7th
Brigade to relieve the Bth Brigade at Bapaume on January
16th. Leaving Senlis early on the 16th we marched to
Varennes where we entrained at 11 a.m. for Bapaume, from
which place we marched to a tented camp situated near the
brickfield, close to the south side of the main Bapaume-
Cambrai road, and about a kilometre distant from Bapaume.


On June 19th a severe storm partially washed away some
of our tents. Training now began in real earnest, and tactical
schemes were carried out, including several night operations.
On June 23rd, in connection with the defensive role of the
Division in reserve the 7th Brigade occupied the 3rd Corps’
line extending from Beugny-Ytres, the 27th Battalion, acting
as reserve battalion, was disposed west of Fremicourt.
On July 3rd an amusing incident happened during the
march past our camp of the 3rd English Division, which
included several Scotch regiments.. A few of the saucy
Seventh (7th Brigade), accorded the “Jocks” a vociferous
welcome in their rough and ready style, which, however, did
not meet with the approval of the column’s leader, who forth-
with dispatched a message to our H.Q.s to the effect that he
much preferred the dignified military salute.
While the boys were busily training in open warfare, the
Pioneers were engaged in making crosses for the graves of
our comrades who fell in the Somme area, and a large cross,
which was afterwards erected to the memory of officers,
N .C.O.’s, and men of the 27th Battalion, at Flers.
Thanks to the untiring efforts of our splendid women
folk in Australia we possessed a sports outfit that was the
envy of the whole Division, and many a dull moment was
brightened by a friendly game of cricket and football.
On July 7th, the Battalion was inspected by the G.O.C.
the 7th Brigade (Brigadier-General Wisdom), the transport
being very highly commended. During the afternoon we
played a cricket match against the 26th Battalion, and thanks
to some high scoring which included 123 by Lieut. C. E.
Pellew, the 27th won quite easily.
For the next few days training consisted of a series of
tactical schemes which were carried out in the vicinity of
Villers au Flos, Haplincourt, and Ligny Thilloy. These
operations were of immense value to officers and specialists.
On Sunday, July 15, a beautiful summer day, the
Battalion marched from Bapaume to the sacred spot at Flers
to erect a cross and pay a last tribute to the memory of our
gallant comrades who fell there on November sth, 1916.
The memorial service was attended by the Brigadier of
the 7th Brigade and the G.O.C. 2nd Division, and was very
impressive.


The battlefield, covered with long grass, intermingled
with patches of blood-red poppies and blue cornflowers, pre-
sented a scene far different from that which greeted that bleak
November morn, but despite Nature’s beautiful transforma-
tion, the boys present that day lived over again their
experiences throughout the battle. How many silent prayers
were offered that each and all might prove worthy to carry
on the high principles for which those brave men died?
During the service a tiny lark arose nearby and with a beauti-
ful flow of song seemingly strove to silence the ever-reminding
rumble of artillery fire, away to the east.
The impressive notes of the Last Post had long died
away before the boys dispersed in various directions, some
wandered away privately as though to commune once more in
the sacred presence of those particular chums they missed so
much. Here and there a few simple poppies were culled and
tenderly placed away to eventually find a resting place in the
home of that gallant soldier whose simple grave they had once
adorned. The boys eventually returned to Bapaume wonder-
fully conscious of having discharged a noble duty. During
the day Capt. Ross reported to the Battalion from the 7th
Field Ambulance, for duty in relief of our R.M.0., Major H.
P. Brownell, D. 5.0., who departed next day for Australia.
Much esteemed throughout the Battalion, Major Brownell
was always affectionately referred to as the “Doc.,” and his
departure v/as regretted by all ranks.
On the 19th we carried out a long route march, passing
through the villages of Le Transluy, Rocquigny, Villers au
Flos, and Bancourt before returning to camp.
On the night of the 20th-21st we carried out a tactical
scheme, which was most interesting. This tactical scheme
will be best remembered by the attack carried out at dawn;
the fact of our having to assemble in the darkness for the
attack made the scheme most realistic. On the afternoon of
July 24th our Battalion cricket team played a match against a
representative team from 2nd Divisional Headquarters, and
amid great excitement the 27th won by one run.
On July 27th we received orders that the 7th Brigade
would move by train to the Rennescure area on the 28th inst,
and immediate preparations were made for our move to the
North.


CHAPTER XVIII.
THE DAWN OF PASSCHENDAELE.
POLYGON WOOD.
At 4 p.m. on July 28th, 1917, we marched from Bapaume
to Ivliraumont (River Ancre) where we entrained, less “D”
Coy., for Cassel at 10 p.m.
After a wearisome all night ride on the French military
express we arrived at Cassel at 9.30 a.m.
The horrors of war may be forgotten; but these train
journeys will ever be remembered. The rates of speed actually
attained are not recorded, but from our experience we should
divide them into three speeds—fast, slow, and dead slow, the
respective mileage rates being 4 miles per hour, 2 miles per
hour, and one mile per-haps!
Upon our arrival at Cassel it was raining, as is usual in
that part, and we marched about 6 miles to a tented camp at
Rennescure. Battalion headquarters with “A,” “B,” and “D”
Coys, camped south of the Arques-Cassel road and close to
the Rennescure road; “C” Coy. camped at a farm north
of the Cassel main road and close to Abbaye de Woestine.
“D” Coy. rejoined the Battalion about 4 a.m. on the 30th.
During- the following afternoon a Battalion parade was held,
in battle order, which most suited the temperament of the
boys after a long march.
A collective report of the first night’s reconnaissance of
their new surroundings completely satisfied ail ranks and we
settled down to make the best of our stay in the area. Appar-
ently our recent active training in the Bapaume was not to be
wasted, as the next day found us route marching.
From August Ist to the 4th very wet weather prevailed
and only a little indoor training could be carried out, while a


percentage of leave was given to visit St. Omer, a fair-sized
town about 6 miles due west of our camp. Moving pictures
were shown nightly at the Y.M.C.A. hut at the Abbaye de
Woestine and a night’s outing was always concluded with a
chipped potato supper at the camp. On August 9th the
Battalion covered about 13 miles route marching to Zuytpeene
and Noordpenne, returning via Le Nieppe to camp.
Two days later a most interesting route march was taken
in the vicinity of and partly through the Forest de Clairmarais
which is situated a mile and a half N.W. of the Camp. In the
interior of this forest, which is beautifully timbered, rise two
hills which form a kind of saddle, and picturesque tracks lead
in all directions connecting up with the surrounding villages.
The forest covers an approximate area of 2 square miles.
Several tactical schemes were carried out by the 7th Brigade
during our stay in the Rennescure area.
On the 13th another route march was taken, in full
marching order, the route being Lenieppe, Clairmarais,
Arques, and Fort Rouge, and before returning to camp the
boys indulged in a swim in the lakes near Arques.
On August 23rd, the 2nd Division, less artillery and
train, marched past the Corps Commander (General Sir
William Birdwood). This took place along the towpath on
the S.W. bank of the Canal de Neuf Fosse, the saluting point
being between the Wardrecques and Campagne bridges.
On August 29th the 2nd Division was inspected by Field
Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief of the British
Forces in France and Belgium, close to the Arquesaire road
at a point S.W. of Campagne. The troops looked well,
arrayed in battle order but wearing felt hats, and the presenta-
tion of arms with fixed bayonets at the sounding of the
general salute by a whole division of infantrymen was a sight
never to be forgotten. At the conclusion of the inspection a
representative Battalion of each Brigade marched past the
Field Marshal.
During our stay at Rennescure the enemy made several
air raids over St. Omer, the huge bombing planes invariably
passing over our camp en route, and on Sunday night,
September 2nd an attempt was made to bomb the Hazebrouck-
St. Omer railway near Rennescure, two large bombs being
dropped near the S.E. edge of the village, but fortunately no
casualties resulted.


On the afternoon of September 11 the 7th Brigade carried
out an offensive scheme which proved almost an exact
facsimile of the Brigade’s action at Polygon Wood on Sep-
tember 20th, 1917. This proved to be the last of our tactical
training at Rennescure, for that same night we received orders
that the Brigade would move to the Steenvoorde area on the
12th. Fortunately the potatoe raiders had become acquainted
with the news and provision was made for a last supper in the
area.
At 8 a.m. on September 12th we left Rennescure and
marched via Staple, Hondeghem, and St. Sylvestre-Cappel to
Steenvoorde, arriving at the camp previously occupied by the
Battalion in October, 1916, at 3.30 p.m. The camp was
situated about three quarters of a mile due north of Steen-
voorde. We had very little time in which to visit our old
haunts at Steenvoorde, for we left again the following morning
at 8.15 for the Halifax area and marching via Abeele, Rening-
helst, and Ouderdom camped at Montreal Camp. The next
day a percentage of Battalion officers and N.C.O.’s proceeded
to a spot near Ouderdom to study a ground model of the
enemy positions shortly to be attacked by the 2nd Australian
Division in conjunction with the Ist Anzac Corps. It was a
cleverly constructed miniature battlefield, showing the exact
position of almost every enemy strong point from a field gun
emplacement to a fortified shell hole, and planks were
arranged, suspended above the model to facilitate a correct
and careful study of every detail. The Intelligence personnel
of each unit were also given a lantern lecture in connection
with the forthcoming offensive. Slides showing all the enemy
concentration centres from which counter attacks were likely
to be delivered were carefully dealt with, also the identification
of enemy troops holding the line and in immediate reserve.
There is no doubt that the complete success which followed
the battle of September 20th was due in a large measure to
these splendid facilities given to the troops at such an oppor-
tune moment.
In connection with the relief of the 47th British Division
by the 2nd Australian Division, the 6th Brigade relieved the
141st Infantry Brigade, then holding the left front line sector,
on the 16th and 18th of September, the 7th Brigade moving to
the vicinity of Ypres.
At 1 p.m. on the 17th the 27th Battalion, moving under
orders of the 6th Brigade, marched via Kruisstraat and Lille


Gate to the Ypres ramparts, east of the town. During the
day final orders were received for the attack by the ist Anzac
Corps, which comprised the ist, 2nd, 4th, and sth Australian
Divisions. On the Corps’ front the attack was to be carried
out by the Ist Division on the right, and the 2nd Division on
the left, the 4th and sth Divisions remaining in Corps reserve.
Subsequently the 2nd Division was to attack on a two Brigade
front, the 7th Brigade on the right and the sth Brigade on
the left, with the 6th Brigade in reserve. Three objectives were
laid down, in the red, blue, and green lines, which were to be
attacked in leap-frog fashion and captured by the 25th, 27th,
and 28th Battalions in the order written. To facilitate rapid
identification of our troops in their respective objectives a red,
blue, and green diamond was painted on the rear of their steel
helmets. The 26th, as reserve Battalion, was to move and
closely support the 28th Battalion in their attack upon the
final objective. The 27th’s objective, blue line, included a line
of strong points the chief of which were the Albert and Iron
Cross redoubts. Zero hour was fixed for 5.40 a.m., 20/9/17.
At 10.30 p.m. on the 19th the 27th Battalion left the Ypres
ramparts and marched to its assembly position on the
Westhoek Ridge. The jumping-off tapes had been previously
laid by Lieut. Jury and a party of men who afterwards acted
as guides to their respective positions on the tapes. During
the assembly which was reported correct at 3.50 a.m., Capt.
Elder, M.C. was slightly wounded, but resumed duty prior to
the attack. Punctually at 5.40 a.m. our brilliant artillery and
machine gun barrage opened, and with fixed bayonets the 25th,
closely followed by the 27th, closed up behind the barrage and
moved with it to the first objective. The enemy had barely
realized that our barrage had passed beyond them when they
were face to face with our infantry, and only from isolated
pill boxes did they offer much resistance. It was not until
10 minutes later that the enemy artillery began to answer
numerous S.O.S. signals, their barrage falling upon Westhoek
Ridge about 100 yards on the forward slope and on the old
front line, but by this time the 25th and 27th Battalions were
well ahead and clear of it.
At about 6.25 a.m. the numerous success signals indicated
the capture of, and commencement of consolidation at the first
objective, which was successfully carried out under the
protection of our artillery barrage and wonderful work by the
Lewis gunners of the 25th and 27th Battalions.
Q


The first batch of prisoners were identified as belonging
to the 56th R.I.R. and immediate interrogation revealed the
possibility of a strong counter attack from the direction of the
high ground near Albania Woods, the special counter attack
Divisions being stationed at Moorslede and Waterdamhoek
from which villages they were to be conveyed to the main
North and South road on Passchendaele ridge and from there
would launch their attack according to the strength of our
new positions.
At zero plus 80 (7 a.m.), the 27th, passing through, the
25th Battalion closed up to our barrage and moved with it
to attack the Blue Line which was captured about 7.30 a.m.
Our boys were behaving splendidly but in several instances
courted danger from our own barrage in their eagerness to
come to grips with the enemy. Connection was soon estab-
lished with the 12th Battalion on the right and the 18th Bat-
talion on the left.
A reconnaisance of the line found Major Devonshire,
D.S.O. in charge of a splendidly sited position and consolida-
tion in progress, meanwhile every precaution was taken against
the expected counter attack.
About 9.53 a.m. the 28th Battalion passed through the
27th Battalion to attack the final objective (Green Line),
which was captured shortly after 10 a.m.
During the afternoon the enemy commenced to concen-
trate for a counter attack in Albania Woods, and Jabber House
on the Zonnebeke road, but prompt artillery action, together
with machine gun and rifle fire, completely frustrated both
attempts, further efforts between 6 and 8 p.m. sharing the
same fate. From then until midnight hostile planes were very
active and fearing a further advance by our troops, dropped
large flares which illuminated the whole sector for several
minutes at a time.
Towards noon, the next day, we received orders that
the 7th Brigade would be relieved by the 6th Brigade, and
Officers and specialists of the 23rd Battalion arrived to recon-
noitre the sector.
On the night of 21st-22nd the relief took place and we
marched back to Montreal camp. The following day we
moved, via Ouderdom and Reninghelst, to the Wippenhoek


PLAN or OPERATION SEPTEMBER 20 T H 1917


area and camped in tents between Poperinghe and Rening-
helst.
During the afternoon of the 25th the details from the
Divisional reinforcement camp joined the Battalion. The
next day a reorganisation of companies took place followed
by an inspection by Company commanders.
Our casualties during the recent operation were now re-
ported :
Killed.—Officers, nil; Other ranks, 33.
Wounded.—Officers, 5; Other ranks, 142.
Died of Wounds. —Other ranks, 5.
Missing.—-Other ranks, 5.
Fritz still continued making night bombing raids over
this area and the main roads approaching Ypres, and on the
night of the 28th casualties resulted from enemy bombing,
in the 28th Battalion camp, 1 officer being killed and 3 officers
wounded. During the day our R.M.O. (Capt. M. Ross) was
relieved by Capt. K. Burnard.
The 4th and sth Divisions had continued to advance, the
front line now including the greater part of Zonnebeke on the
left, and advanced 200 yards N.E. of Polygon Wood on the
right.
On the 29th we received orders that the 7th Brigade would
relieve the 9th Brigade, then holding the line, on the night of
lst-2nd October. The next morning the 27th Brigade, less a
percentage of officers and specialists to be left out of the line,
marched, via Reninghelst and Dickebusch, to Pioneer Camp,
under the command of Major F. R. Chalmers, meanwhile those
left out of the line proceeded to the reinforcement camp near
Caestre.
Preliminary instructions had been received that the 2nd
and sth Armies would advance their front at a time to be given,
later.


CHAPTER XIX.
PASSCHENDAELE—NEARER TO THE RIDGE.
ZONNEBEKE—BROODSEINDE.
On the night of October 1, 1917, the 27th Batt, under the
command of Major F. R. Chalmers, marched through Ypres to
Westhoek ridge, and although no shell fire was experienced,
an interval of fifty paces between companies was maintained
whilst moving to our positions.
Battalion Headquarters was established at Kit and Kat,
“A” and “B” Companies dug in on Westhoek Ridge, “C”
Company dug in on Anzac Ridge, temporarily in support of
the 26th Battalion, and “D” Company took up a position on
Bellevarde Ridge.
On the 3rd our positions were consistently shelled, and
amongst the wounded were the following:—Major K. A. R.
Friederiechs, who resumed duty, and Lieuts. Brownell and
Riggs. Lieut. Brownell subsequently died.
Orders had now been received that the Ist Anzac Corps
would again advance its front in conjunction with the X Corps
on the right, and the 2nd Anzac Corps on the left. The Ist
and 2nd Australian Divisions would again constitute the right
and left attacking troops on the Ist Corps front. The right
and left attacking Brigades of the 2nd Divisional front were
the 6th and 7th Brigades, the 11th Brigade, 3rd Australian
Division (2nd Anzac Corps) being on the left flank of the 7th
Brigade. The attack was to be carried out leap-frog fashion,
the 25th Battalion to capture the first objective (Red Line),
and the 26th Battalion, with the 27th in close support, the
second objective (Blue Line), the 28th Battalion as Brigade
reserve. Zero hour—6 a.m., 4/10/17.
At 5 a.m., October 4th, the 27th Battalion reached its
first position of assembly near Sans Souci, its formation being


Companies in Line, in file, as follows, reading from right to
left:—
A Coy., under the command of Lieut. Lampard; B Coy.,
under the command of Capt. Gould; C Coy., under the com-
mand of Major Friederiechs; D Coy., under the command of
Lieut. Horwood.
At 6 a.m. our artillery and machine gun barrage opened, its
intensity being further increased by the hurricane activity of
two trench mortars, which practically smothered several hos-
tile machine gun posts.
The 25th Battalion immediately moved forward to attack
the red line, to find the enemy formed up forward of his trench,
ready to participate in an attack upon our lines from Polygon
Wood to Zonnebeke, but after a little demonstration with the
bayonet, which, together with our barrage, completely dis-
organised them, they commenced to surrender freely. Most
of the prisoners identified belonged to the 212th R.I.R. (Re-
serve Infantry Regiment), which was one of the units detailed
for their attack. Fortunately our attack just preceded that of
the enemy and thus saved us unnecessary casualties.
The 26th Battalion moved close behind the 25th, mean-
while the 27th commenced to move forward at Zero to support
them in their attack on the Blue Line. Upon reaching Anzac
Ridge, the 27th waited until 7.10 a.m., when they again moved
forward, in lines of sections in file, to a position in rear of the
Ist objective.
The ground being comparatively soft, the Companies
soon dug themselves in, west of Desmond Trench, and about
250 yards west of Moulin Farm, our right flank being 50 yards
north of Zonnebeke—Broodseinde road, with Battalion Head-
quarters close to the road behind a “Pill Box.”
The 25th were now consolidating the Red Line; the 26th
had moved to the attack upon the Blue Line, and having re-
organised and moved with our protective barrage, encountered
little resistance until reaching the North and South road near
Broodseinde. Here, their movement was held up by machine
gun fire and considerable sniping from Daisy Wood.
Capt. Herbert immediately gave orders to dig in mean-
while despatching a message to the rear for reinforcements,
to enable him to continue to the Blue Line.


PLAN OF OPERATION OCTOBER 4TH-10 T H 1917


Major F. R. Chalmers, 27th Battalion, receiving this mes-
sage, immediately despatched “A” and “B” Companies under
the command of Lieut. Lampard and Capt. Gould respectively,
to assist the 26th Battalion, and at 8.55 a.m. he received a
message from Capt. Gould reporting the capture of the Blue
Line, with “A” Company in touch with the 21st Battalion
on the Broodseinde—Moorslede road, on the right, and “B”
Company with the 26th Battalion on the left.
Immediately following the capture of the Blue Line the
27th Battalion commenced to dig a communication trench be-
tween the objectives.
Early in the afternoon the 26th Battalion, with “A” and
“B” Companies of the 27th, reported the front line situation
to be satisfactory, and although several s.o.s. signals were
sent up by the troops on both flanks, no counter attack
materialized.
Between 5.30 and 6.30 p.m. the enemy began to concen-
trate on Daisy Wood, but were effectively dispersed by our
machine gun and rifle fire. At 1 a.m., on the sth, Major Chal-
mers received instructions to v/ithdraw “A” Company to its
original position near Moulin Farm, leaving “B” Company to
extend to its right and connect with the 21st Battalion. “B”
Company was also withdrawn later in the day, leaving “A”
and “B” Companies’ machine gunners to assist the 26th Bat-
talion in holding the line.
On the night of the sth-6th, the 7th Brigade was relieved
by a portion of the sth Brigade; the 27th Battalion being
relieved by the 17th and 1 Company of the 19th Battalions,
withdrew to a position about a thousand yards S.W. of Zonne-
beke Church, where they dug in.
The 3rd Australian Division was now being relieved by
the 66th English Division, and, consequent upon the readjust-
ment of the Divisional boundary, which led to the 7th Brigade
taking over a portion of the line held by the 199th Infantry
Brigade, the 27th Battalion relieved the 2/6th Manchester
Regiment in the front line at 10 p.m. on the 6th.
The following night the sth Brigade relieved the 7th
Brigade, and the 27th Battalion, upon being relieved by the
17th Battalion, was withdrawn to Railway Wood, and the
following day was spent in reorganising and resting.


At 3 a.m., on October 9th, the 27th Battalion moved for-
ward to Anzac Ridge as reserve Battalion to the sth and 6th
Brigades, and about noon the same day again moved forward
and occupied the old Red Line, meanwhile coming under the
temporary command of the sth and 6th Brigades, the Battalion
being situated in Docile Trench, near De Knoet Farm.
During the day these positions were heavily shelled, and
we sustained many casualties. Capt. Gould and Lieuts. Jury
and Organ were killed and Lieut Coulter severely wounded.
The following day, October 10th, the 7th Brigade was re-
lieved by the 45th and 49th Battalions, and the 27th Battalion
was withdrawn to Gordon Camp, near Ypres, arriving there at
8.30 a.m. Hot meals were issued and the boys settled down to
a well earned rest before embussing for Steenvoorde at 7 p.m.
Reaching Steenvoorde three hours later the Battalion
occupied the same billets as those of the previous month, upon
our arrival from Rennescure. The following day a muster
parade was held, followed by the boys receiving their special
Xmas pay. On October 16th we received the unfortunate
news of the death of Lieut. R. B. Coulter.
Systematic training was now being carried on, and on
the 20th 2/Lieut. Hollaway and 70 other ranks rejoined the
Battalion. The following day, Sunday, the 7th Brigade Church
Parade, held on the 27th Battalion parade ground, was attended
by General Sir William Birdwood, who afterwards presented
medals to various members of the Brigade.
On the 22nd the Battalion was inspected by General
Paton, and acting Brigadier General Collet, the inspection be-
ing followed by a special inspection of platoons by Lieut.
Colonel Slane, for the purpose of selecting the winner of the
£2O prize, which had been recently offered for the best platoon
in the Battalion, and which was finally won by “D” Company.
Later in the day Lieut. Colonel Slane proceeded to Flete, to
take command of the 2nd Divisional Reinforcement Camp,
and Major Chalmers being on English leave, Major Devon-
shire took over the temporary command of the Battalion.
On the 24th the Battalion team played another football
match against the 28th Battalion, and after a most exciting
match, won by five points.


Orders had now been received that the 2nd Australian
Division would relieve the sth Australian Division, then hold-
ing the right Division sector of the Corps front, between the
26th and 28th of October.
We left Steenvoorde early on October 26th and journeyed,
in ’buses, to Cafe Beige and camped under trench shelters in
the Swan Area. A percentage of officers immediately recon-
noitred forward.
The next day the 7th Brigade were to relieve the 15th
Brigade, and the 27th Battalion left the Swan Area at noon,
and marching by way of Warrington Track, Birr Cross Roads,
and Helles Track, to Albert Redoubt, relieved the 59th Bat-
talion as right Support Battalion.
The Ist Corps had now crowned the Passchendaele ridge,
and the role of the 2nd Australian Division was primarily a
defensive one, although prepared at any minute to advance
its front to conform with any forward movement of the 2nd
Corps further north, where an advance on Passchendaele vil-
lage was expected.
The 2nd Division now held a front of approximately 2,000
yards, the left flank of which connected with the right flank
of the Ist Australian Division in the vicinity of Daisy Wood,
about 400 yards east of the main Passchendaele—Becelaere
road, the right flank connecting with the left flank of the
King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at a point near Noor-
demhoek, about 100 yards east of the above mentioned North
and South road. The front was held by the 7th Brigade, the
sth and 6th Brigades being in Supports and Reserve. The
28th and 26th Battalions were right and left line Battalions,
and the 27th and 25th were right and left support Battalions.
The 27th Battalion Headquarters, together with “D” Com-
pany, was in the vicinity of Albert Redoubt, and “A,” “B,”'
and “C” Companies were disposed near Albania Wood, north
of Polygon Wood.
The duck board and corduroy tracks leading to and from
the Westhoek and Bellevarde ridges were consistently shelled
by the enemy with shrapnel and gas shells and everything
reeked of mustard and other deadly gasses. Albert Redoubt,
being one of the series of strong points which comprised the
2nd objective taken by the 27th Battalion on the morning of
September 20th proved interesting to those who took part in


the operation. Half right to the rear was a “Pill Box,” “Dead
Mule” dugout, with several dead mules close to the entrance.
This “Pill Box” became quite famous in after days, many
humorous articles being written about it by various scribes
throughout the Australian Units. Occupied at that time by
our Headquarter’s Signals it seemed to bear a charmed exis-
tence, for although heavy shells burst at every point around
it, none actually hit it Thanks to the dead mules its position
could be easily located even on the blackest of nights.
During the night parties of “D” Company assisted the
Engineers in the Swan Area, and the forward Companies,
together with other work, carried rations to the 28th Battalion
in the front line. A few casualties were caused by enemy
gas shelling, and the boys wore their gas helmets for several
hours. During the night Major Chalmers rejoined the Bat-
talion from English leave.
On the night of November 30th a party of 150 men under
the command of Capt. Hosking successfully dug 400 yards of
communication trench from the front line Battalion Head-
quarters to the front line.
October 31st the enemy continued shelling our support
and reserve areas, many gas shells falling in supports, causing
about 9 casualties from gas, the boys being rendered partially
blind for about 24 hours. During the night we relieved the
28th Battalion in the front line, “A” and “C” Companies occu-
pied the front line with “B” Company in supports, and “D”
Company in reserve in rear of Battalion Headquarters.
About two hours after the relief a patrol of 15 other ranks,
under Lieut. Roddick, made a reconnaissance of No Man’s
Land in the vicinity of Celtic and Justice Woods but met with
no opposition and no enemy patrols. During the following day
our support line was shelled and 4 men of “B” Company were
wounded.
Holding practically the highest point on the Divisional
front, our ground observation left nothing to be desired and
very little movement could be made by the enemy during day-
light. Naturally the enemy strove hard to neutralize our
advantage by consistently and heavily shelling the ridge, but
once there and in touch with our artillery, the risk was worth
while.


The most staple of the enemy front line system was about
800 yards distant from our front line and included a series
of strong points near a position conveniently known as Mili-
tary Road, judging by the rapidity of movement exercised
by the enemy troops in the vicinity, the attention paid it by our
artillery was not in vain. It had long become evident that the
Australians had seriously upset at least one of the conventions
that had been allowed to drift into warfare on the Western
Front, for without doubt, of all the troops engaged, they were
the most instrumental in proving to the enemy that the terri-
tory between the front line trenches and themselves had been
wrongly named, and that instead of being “No Man’s Land,”
should have been “Anyman’s Land.” Our prowling methods
and daring patrol work were the subjects of comment by the
enemy higher command in almost every piece of captured
intelligence. The nature of the ground forward of our lines
made the night patrolling very thrilling even to the most
experienced scout.
A little can be gathered from the movement of our patrol
on the night of November Ist, when Lieut. Lapthorne, M.C.,
and 17 other ranks, accompanied by an officer of the 20th
Battalion who was reconnoitering our sector prior to our
relief, left our lines about 10.15 p.m. and were moving along
the edge of the road dividing the Celtic and Justice Woods
when they observed an enemy patrol advancing towards our
lines from the western edge of Justice Wood. The patrol was
moving- in sections in single file with a screen of scouts 30
yards ahead. To avoid envelopement our patrol moved back
about 100 and waited for the enemy to approach to
within 50 yards. They then opened fire with a machine gun
and rifles, the enemy immediately scattering in all directions,
making principally for the cover of Justice Wood. Immedi-
ately after, red flares were fired from the rear of Justice Wood,
with the result that a barrage of shells was put down in the
vicinity cf our patrol. A standing patrol was afterwards
established at the spot where the enemy was first observed,
but upon being withdrawn shortly before dawn reported no
further signs of the enemy.
On the night of the 2nd we were relieved by the 20th
Battalion, and moving back by way of Warrington Track and
Shrapnel Corner were comfortably billeted in huts near Bel-
gian Chateau by midnight.


From November sth to the Bth the majority of the Bat-
talion was engaged in assisting the Canadian Light Tramway
Company, near Ypres.
On the 9th, consequent upon the relief of the 7th Brigad'e
by the 147th Infantry Brigade, the 27th Battalion marched to
Ouderdom from which place we embussed for Steenvoorde
Area. Arriving at Steenvoorde at 2 p.m. we marched through
the town to a camp about 2 miles distant, N.W. of Steen-
voorde and Sth. of Winnizeele. During the next two days
it rained practically the whole time, and the boys rested.
On the 12th the Battalion was engaged principally in
reorganising and cleaning up.
On the 16th the 7th Brigade moved to the Berthen Area
and the 27th Battalion, marching via Godewaersvelde, arrived
at Berthen at noon. We left again the next day at noon and
marching via St. Jans-Cappel, Bailleul and Ravelsburg, ar-
rived in the Neuve-Eglise area at 2.30 p.m., the 27th being bil-
leted in the village.


CHAPTER XX.
NEUVE-EGLISE—ROMARIN.
November 18th, Capt. R. J. Burnard, the Battalion R.M.O.
returned to the 7th Field Ambulance being relieved by Capt.
C. H. Matheson, and 44 reinforcements arrived during the day.
Consequent upon the splendid advance made by the 2nd
Army (under General Plumer), on June 17th, 1917, when the
salient between Mount Sorrell and the S.E. edge of Ploeg-
steert Wood was straightened out, and which included the
capture of Messines ridge and 7,000 prisoners, the village of
Neuve-Eglise received very little attention from enemy long
range artillery, although several hostile air raids were made
over the camping areas in its near vicinity. A few civilians
still remained in parts of the village and catered for the needs
of the troops with eggs, potatoes, and coffee. Those of the
boys who were with the Battalion here in 1916 visited the
old spots of interest. Systematic and recreational training
was commenced, plenty of time being devoted to football and
several interesting matches were arranged.
On the 24th the Battalion team completely overwhelmed
the 7th Brigade machine gunners who were not able to score
a point, but unfortunately we were not so fortunate when
meeting our old opponents, the 28th Battalion, two days later,
who won a finely contested game by 3 points. On the 28th the
Battalion team avenged this reverse by easily defeating the
26th Battalion. On December Ist we played and defeated the
44th Battalion at Kortepyp camp.
A Brigade “raiding camp” had now been established on
the main Wulvergem road, near Neuve-Eglise, which was
called Emu Camp, and on December 2nd, Capt. S. Wiltshire
and Lieuts. Horwood, Julge, and McCann, with 50 other ranks
reported there for training as selected raiders of the 27th Bat-
talion.
These raiders were carefully trained in all methods and
purposes connected with raids, the chief of which no doubt is


the rapid identification of units and the correct construction
of his line organisation, together with other cumulative and
most valuable knowledge that finally reveal the intention of
the enemy in the main.
Very few, even of the most experienced raiders, had pre-
viously grasped and understood the real value of their mag-
nificent work, and how very contributive it was to Intelli-
gence in general. All that seemed to concern them was that
they had captured a few prisoners and a few maps and other
papers.
On December sth and Bth football matches were played
against the 7th Brigade machine gun section and Bri-
gade Headquarters, both being won by the 27th with a con-
siderable margin of points. On the 6th the 27th Battalion held
an interesting Series of sports, which resulted in D Coy. cap-
turing the lion’s share of the prizes.
A very unfortunate incident happened during the after-
noon of the 12th, when ten hostile bombing and fighting planes
wore observed flying over Neuve-Eglise and the surrounding
camps. Despite all efforts of our anti-aircraft and machine
gunners to keep them off they dropped several bombs, which
inflicted serious casualties in the neighbouring camps.
Later in the day we received orders that the 2nd Aus-
tralian Division would relieve the 3rd Australian Division in
the right divisional sector of the corps front (Ploegsteert
area), on the 14th, 15th, and 16th of December, the sth, 7th,
and 6th Brigades to relieve the 9th, 10th, and 11th Brigades
respectively.
On the 13th an officer and 90 other ranks assisted the
Canadian Light Training Coy. at Dranoute Railway Siding.
On the 14th, the last day to be spent at Neuve Eglise, a foot-
ball match was arranged between officers and other ranks, and
although the officers won by three goals, it has always been
an open question whether the result was due to bad play on
the part of the other ranks or to their having been paid that
day. However, it proved the most amusing game played at
Neuve-Eglise.
The front line sector to be taken over by the Battalion
had been well reconnoitred, and at 2.30 p.m. on the 15th the
Battalion left Neuve-Eglise and marched by way of Leinster
and quarry roads to Red Lodge, situated at the foot of Hill
<63, where hot tea was issued. At 4.15 p.m. we again moved


forward via Hyde Park Corner, Mud Lane, Look Slippy Lane,
and St. Yves and Ultimo Avenues, and relieved the 39th
Battalion. B and D Companies occupied the right and left
front line, with A and C Coys, in supports and reserve.
Our front line consisted of a line of nine posts and num-
bered from right to left (1 to 9) and covered a front of 1,000
yards. From No. 1 post, situated near the sugar refinery, to
No. 5 post, the line conformed in shape to the River Lys for a
distance of about 700 yards, and was about 80 yards from its
bank, and from No. 5 to No. 9 post receded N.W. to a point
near the Warneton-Armentieres railway.
The defenders of these posts will long remember the at-
tention paid to them by the enemy trench mortars, which
were conventionally named Lizzie, Mary Ann, Jane-Susan-
Poliy-Agnes-Matilda, and Dot, to facilitate liaison between the
front line and our artillery, which, being already acquainted
with the co-ordinates of their positions, dealt with them
according to their conduct. Two very conspicuous points in
the enemy’s defence system were the Spinning Mill and the
concrete tower at Warneton, the latter being frequently used
as an observation post. It stood in defiance of our extremely
heavy shelling for a considerable time before being demol-
ished. Owing to the enemy’s line being astride the river, our
patrols were out every night, but it was quite evident that
Fritz v/as busy at work making himself comfortable for the
winter months, and relied upon his trench mortar activity to
keep our patrolling down, for we were able to patrol right up
to his wire without meeting his patrols.
During the occupation, our artillery was much more
active than that of the enemy, the bulk of his shelling taking
place at night, and being confined to our support line near
Iron Gate and battery positions in rear, gas shells of large
calibre being used.
From Battalion Headquarters, St. Yves, to our foremost
front line post was a mile and a half direct, and the line and
Headquarters was connected by a long communication trench,
part of which was called St. Yves Avenue and the remainder
Ultimo Avenue. During our next tour of duty in the sector
the disadvantages and danger of such a long and continuous
trench was considerably obviated by our digging a series of
subsidiary trenches left and right of the main trench.
On the night of December 20th the enemy fired about a
dozen gas projectiles of the minnenwerfer type in the vicinity


of Nos. 8 and 9 posts, and the occupants had to use their gas
helmets. On the 23rd our “digger boss,” General Birdwood,
paid us a visit in the line, and personally wished the boys the
compliments of the season.
On Christmas Eve we were relieved by the 25th Battalion,
and marching out by way of Ploegsteert we reached Romarin
camp about midnight, and after enjoying a hot meal settled
aown to a good rest. A few civilians still remained in Romarin,
which is situated actually on the frontier of France and
Belgium.
On December 25th we certainly fared a little better than
on Christmas Day, 1916, so far as dinner was concerned, but
owing to the tremendous amount of work necessary to create
an effective defensive system in view of the expected offensive
of the enemy, very little time could be spared, even to troops
just relieved from the line. However, the boys made the best
of things, and cheerfully accepted the inevitable, and after the
distribution of our Christmas parcels from Australia, they
made merry, snow fights being one of their chief engagements
until 3 p.m., when a large working party of five officers and
275 other ranks, under the command of Capt. Bice, left
Romarin and proceeded, by means of the light railway, to the
forward area. Upon reporting to the 7th Field Engineers they
were split up into sections of wiring, digging, and trucking
parties. The wiring party was engaged in putting out 500
yards of double-apron wire in front of the support line, and
had almost completed the task when the position was heavily
shelled by the enemy, four men being killed and three
wounded. Quite a gloom was cast over the Battalion, for it
was most unfortunate that after spending nine days recently
in the front line without casualties, we should have this num-
ber killed and wounded whilst carrying out a few hours’
work in the same area.
The digging parties were engaged in digging and clear-
ing out trenches, and the trucking parties between Rasine
dump and the railhead. The following night the same number
of men, this time under the command of Capt. Elder, M.C.,
carried out work of a similar nature, which was fortunately
completed without casualties. During the next four nights
our boys worked hard in the forward area, evoking high praise
from the 7th Field Engineers. On the night of the 29th another
man was killed and one wounded.

CHAPTER XXI.
WARNETON—RED LODGE.
The dawn of the New Year, 1918, found us still at Romarin,
with the boys in fairly good spirits. Paris leave was now
available, and a percentage of the boys were representing
the Battalion on what was usually referred to as the “Paris
Front.” Upon their return to the Battalion they were always
“given the floor” when relating their many amusing experi-
ences on that particular sector, and so in turn each of the
eager listeners took his departure to the gay city armed with
letters of introduction and hotel addresses handed down by
his chums.
The few days’ leave from the nerve-racking front line
areas proved a wonderful restorative, coming as it did when
the strain upon some men’s nerves almost reached breaking
point. However, it was not long before our operations on the
Paris front began to wane instead of increase.
The Americans made a surprise attack from the rear,
which resulted in their 6th Month Division successfully dig-
ging in and their establishment of a defensive system that
lasted until the end of the war.
On January 2nd the 27th Battalion proceeded to the
Ploegsteert area to relieve the 25th Battalion in the front-
line positions vacated by us on December 24th, 1917. We
entrained, in two parties, on the light railway at Romarin
Siding, and detrained at Rasine Dump, from whence the com-
panies moved by way of St. Yves and Ultimo Avenues to the
front line. B and A Companies took over the right and left
line positions, with D Coy. in supports, Battalion Headquar-
ters at St. Yves, and C Coy. in reserve at Prowse Point.
In the line, hard work was necessary to complete the re-
organisation of the defensive system, which, as a whole, was


now fairly staple and substantially strong as far in rear as
Hyde Park Corner, some 4,000 yards behind the line.
Although it was not expected that an enemy assault
would be delivered in strength directly against this sector, it
became necessary to re-site most of our rear line system, and
many concrete nucleus machine gun posts were made upon
the most commanding features affording the best line of fire.
One of the strongest and best remembered by our boys was
situated near the end of St. Yves Avenue in the subsidiary
line leading to the right Brigade sector, and others were es-
tablished North of St. Yves and Prowse Point, from which
the valley of the Douve could be swept by machine gun fire.
The construction and defence of these rear line posts fell to
the reserve Brigade of the Divisional sector, in this instance
the 6th Brigade.
Weather conditions became much colder, the ground, al-
ready covered with snow, began to freeze hard, and it became
necessary to relieve our front posts every twenty-four hours.
The increase in enemy aerial activity was fully reciprocated
by our Air Force, which was now reaping the benefit of its
re-organisation, and proving as effective in protecting our rear
lines against enemy aerial reconnoissance as our trenches were
against attacks on terra firma.
On the night of January 3, “D” Company relieved “A”
Company in the front line. Scouts reconnoitred the left line
Company’s front, and came in contact with an enemy patrol,
which they dispersed with the aid of Mills’ bombs. The
enemy’s wire entanglements were found to be strong every-
where, with the exception of a point near the railway line,
which was a protection in itself.
The next day our artillery was called upon to deal with
the increased activity of enemy trench mortars, and our scouts
while reconnoitring No Man’s Land had several bombs
directed against them, fortunately without casualties. On the
night of the 6th “B” Company, right line Company, was re-
lieved by “C” Company.
On January 8 our artillery was extremely active, heavily
shelling a number of targets, which included the Warneton
Tower, and the Doll’s House near Deulemont, on our right
Brigade sector. During the night the increased enemy trench
mortar activity resulted in the death of three of our men
who were acting as liaison patrol to the Battalion on our


PLAN SHOWING FRONT LINES REST AREAS 1916,1917&1918.


right flank. It was quite apparent that all three were killed
by the concussion of the one projectile.
The following day the action of our 4.5 guns practically
demolished Wicart Farm. During the night we were re-
lieved by the 25th Battalion, and moving back to Red Lodge,
camped on the South-West slopes of Hill 63.
On the night of the 10th we supplied a working party of
three officers and 100 other ranks on the defensive system in
the vicinity of La Truie Farm and Au Chasseur Cabaret in
the support lines. Working parties of various strengths were
engaged in the immediate forward area until the night of
January 12/13, when, in connection with the relief of the 7th
Brigade by the 6th Brigade, the 27th was relieved of its works
programme by the 23rd Battalion.
The 7th Brigade was now reserve Brigade, and the 26th
and 27th Battalions relieved the 23rd and 21st Battalions’
garrison in the nucleus posts East of Hyde Park Corner, the
Headquarters and surplus of each Battalion being disposed at
Canteen Corner and Red Lodge respectively. The disposition
of the 27th Battalion garrison was as follows:
“A” Company .. Ist Line .. Nos. 1,2, 3 Posts.
“B” Company .. 2nd Line .. Nos. 4,5, 6 Posts.
“C” Company .. 3rd Line .. Nos. 7,8, 9 Posts.
On January 14 a thaw set in, with the resulting muddy
conditions, and to ensure immunity from “trench feet’’ com-
pulsory parades were held, at which the feet were inspected
by the medical officer, Capt. Matheson.
Enemy long range guns intermittently shelled the vicin-
ity of Red Lodge, but no damage resulted. The work of
strengthening the nucleus posts, wiring and revetting, and
deepening the trenches was carried on as rapidly as weather
conditions would permit, the heavy rains considerably ham-
pering progress, especially of wiring in front of the positions
astride the River Douve. A complete platoon of “A” Com-
pany reported to the raiding camp near Neuve-Eglise for
special training.
On January 22 Major F. R. Chalmers, C. 0., and Capt.
R. D. Southon, Adjutant, proceeded on English leave, and
Major P. C. Raper took over the temporary command of the
Battalion. Before leaving, Major Chalmers expressed to all


ranks his appreciation of the magnificent manner in which
they had carried out their duties in the forward area, and in-
formed them that during the next month they were likely to
go into a rest area for a lengthy spell, during which time
Brigade and Divisional Sports would be held.
The next day notification of Major Chalmers’ promotion
to the rank of Lieut.-Colonel in charge of the Battalion
reached us, and was received with widespread satisfaction.
From January 23 to the 26th the weather remained fine,
and work in the defensive zone was continued. Although
fate decreed that the Australian Divisions, so largely respon-
sible for the establishment of this defence, should not actually
garrison and defend it against the German onrush during the
Lys battle, excellent testimonies as to its efficiency were
afterwards conveyed to us by collective intelligence, and
proved by the tremendous casualties sustained by the enemy
in the taking of Messines and Hill 63 on April ic 1918.
On January 27, the 7th Brigade was relieved by the nth
Brigade (3rd Australian Division), the nucleus garrisons sup-
plied bjr the 26th and 27th Battalions being relieved by the
34th Battalion. The remainder of the 27th Battalion,
was relieved by the 40th Battalion, and leaving Red
Lodge at noon, marched via Neuve-Eglise and
Dranoutre to Locre, where the nucleus garrison rejoined it,
immediately after its relief. During the whole of that tour
of duty in the forward area, under most trying conditions, not
one man was evacuated with trench feet, a fact which re-
flected great credit upon the stamina of the boys, the constant
attention paid to the condition of their feet, and the issue of
dry socks. The health of all ranks, although severely tested
by the long hours of fatigue duties under wretched conditions,
was excellent, and all felt happy at the prospect of a spell in
a rest area. During the following day, which was spent at
Locre, the Battalion team played a football match against the
48th Battalion, and won by 17 points.


CHAPTER XXII.
PLEASANT MEMORIES—BELLEBRUNE—
CREMAREST.
On January 29, 1918, the 7th Brigade was relieved in the
Locre Area by the 2nd Brigade, and commenced to move to
the Henneveux Sub-Area. Only the necessary portion of the
transport, such as cookers, water carts, and mess carts, jour-
neyed by train, the remainder moving by road, via Bailleul,
Strazeele, Hazebrouck, Rennescure, Lombres and Escoevilles.
The mention of these towns and villages will no doubt
recall to those who made the journey the beautiful scenery
and country through which they passed, and the fine spring-
weather which added to the pleasure of the trip.
The 27th Battalion, less the above-mentioned transport,
marched from Locre to De Kennebak Siding, and entrained
there at 1.18 p.m. for Lottinghan, where they arrived at 5.40
p.m. After detraining we were issued with hot coffee, which
was much more appreciated than were the reports of the
guides who met us at the station with news of the long march
before us. As soon as was possible, we commenced the march
to Cremarest and Bellebrune, where we arrived at 1.30 a.m.
on January 30. Despite their weary march, many were astir
quite early to enjoy the lovely spring morning and to explore
their new surroundings. The disposition of the 7th Brigade
group covered an area of about 24 miles, and principally as
a refresher to memory the names of villages and the units
disposed therein are chronicled:—
Alingtun—7th Brigade Headquarters and 17th A.A.S.C.
Surques-Escoevilles—2sth Battalion.


Henneveux—26th Battalion.
Bellebrune—27th Battalion.
Cremarest—27th Battalion.
Le Wast—2Bth Battalion.
Brimembert—7th Machine Gun Company and 7th Field
Ambulance.
Colembert—7th Field Company Engineers.
The 27th was disposed over a fairly large area—Battalion
Headquarters and “A” Company were in the vicinity of Belle-
brune and the main Boulogne-St. Omer Road, and “B,” “C,”
and “D” Companies at Cremarest, two miles further South.
Bellebrune is a very old and quiet little village situated
one kilometre South of the Boulogne-St. Omer Road, and
possesses a very old Church, the accommodation of which is
only taxed when the whole of the inhabitants and their nu-
merous relatives attend.
Cremarest, further South, is rather prettily situated,
boasting a few more inhabitants than Bellebrune. The Bat-
talion parade ground was situated on the Eastern side of the
main road between the villages. A percentage of leave was
given daily to Boulogne, about fourteen kilometres distant,
motor lorries being used for the conveyance of troops. . Train-
ing, of course, was carried on, full advantage being taken of
the surrounding country, which was admirably suited for
specialist training.
Having extensively explored the neighboring villages, the
boys began to turn towards the coast and Desvres, S.E. of
Cremarest. The presence of a W.A.A.C. camp at Wimereux
no doubt had something to do with the long walks taken in
that direction every week-end, and the advent of our troops
was not pleasing to the Portuguese troops billeted there-
abouts.
On February 9 a Battalion inspection was held on the
parade ground, and on the 12th the Battalion Sports were
held near the Chateau at Bellebrune, the honors being shared
by each Company.
On February 27 the Battalion was inspected by Lieut.-
Colonel Chalmers, recently returned from leave, and in the


afternoon our Battalion football team met, and defeated by
one point, the 28th Battalion. The following day a tactical
scheme, open warfare, was carried out in the Forest De Bou-
logne, West of Bellebrune.
On March 4 we received orders that the 2nd Australian
Division would move to the Australian Corps Area between
the 2nd and the 10th of March, the 7th Brigade to relieve the
gth Brigade in the Kortepyp Area on March 8. Having to
leave Bellebrune at 2 a.m. on the Bth, some of the boys re-
tired to rest early on the previous night, but others kept the
civilians busy until a late hour, supplying them with hot
coffee, etc. At 2 a.m. on the Bth, Battalion Headquarters and
“A” Company, preceded by the Band, left Bellebrune for
Desvres, the remaining Companies joining the column at Cre-
marest. Shortly after 4 a.m. the inhabitants of Desvres were
awakened by a last supreme effort of the Band, as we march-
ed through the village, and a few greetings, complimentary
and otherwise, were hurled at us as we made our way to the
railway station.
Entraining at 6.45 a.m., and passing through St. Omer
and Hazebrouck, we arrived at Steenwerck at 12.30 p.m. .We
then marched to No. 1 Camp, Kortepyp, and billeted in huts
vacated by the 35th Battalion, “D” Company being detained
at Steenwerck to unload the train, reporting later. The fol-
lowing day “A” Company, under the command of Lieuts.
Julge and Sells, reported to Red Lodge as a working party.
During our stay in reserve, working parties, averaging
six officers and 200 other ranks, were supplied for the for-
ward areas, and on the 10th one of the parties sustained se-
rious casualties from enemy shellfire, three being killed and
nine wounded.


CHAPTER XXIII.
KORTEPYP—FRELINGHIEN.
Our reserve areas were now extensively reconnoitred, the
positions immediately West of Frelinghien being the most
important to us. March 13, Lieuts. Gatley and Reid and 69
other ranks were selected as raiders of the 27th Battalion.
The enemy long range guns now commenced to shell
Nieppe, Steenwerck, and Bailleul, several casualties being
reported from the 2nd Divisional Pioneer Camp at Nieppe.
In connection with the relief of the sth Brigade in the
right sub-area, by the 7th Brigade, the 27th Battalion en-
trained at the Connaught Siding on the night of the 20th/2ist
for the front line, where they relieved the 17th Battalion,
two Companies occupying the front line and two Companies
the support line, inter Company reliefs being effected.
On March 23 definite news of the opening of the enemy’s
spring offensive was conveyed to those to whom such infor-
mation was most essential. As the Intelligence Staff had
correctly anticipated, the attack was launched on the morning
of March 21, failing heaviest in the neighborhood of the Ba-
paume-Cambrai Road and further South beyond the Fles-
quieres salient to St. Quentin, the salient itself not being
directly attacked. It was far from pleasing to the mind to
think that we were holding a line where enemy shelling was
so slight as to be easily tabulated, while our old line at Bulle-
court and Lagnicourt, which had cost so many lives to es-
tablish, had crumbled away.
The enemy immediately opposed to us showed no actual
signs of an offensive character, but our ground and aerial
observers, particularly the reconnoissance planes, carefully
watched his rear lines for any signs of hostile developments.
During the 28th and 2gth our casualties were four killed.


On the 30th and 31st there was a marked increase in
enemy aerial and artillery activity on our sector, presumably
owing to the extension of the enemy’s attack to the North
of Arras. One hostile single-seater plane was brought down
by our guns, near Warnave Lodge.
News had now reached us that on March 26 Marshal
Foch had been appointed to take over the supreme command
of the French and British Forces on the Western Front, and
that the French were gradually relieving the British troops,
and also the enemy pressure on the right of our Fifth Army.
On April 1 orders were received that in accordance with
the relief of the 2nd Australian Division by the 25th and 19th
English Divisions, the 7th Brigade would be relieved by the
74th and 75th Infantry Brigades, and on the night of the
2nd/srd of April the 27th Battalion was relieved from the
right line Battalion sector by the 3rd Worcesters.
The relieving troops showed many signs of their recent
hard fighting East of Bapaume, and our troops, at every op-
portunity, expressed their hearty approval of the work done
in that area during the first phase of the heavy German of-
fensive, and the writer has reason to know that the splendid
reception and encouragement given by our men was keenly
appreciated and valued by the recipients. Much criticism has
been levelled at the sth and part of the 3rd Armies for the
part they took in the face of that offensive, but only those
who were present and actually took part in the fighting, can
fully realise the magnitude of the operation. .After being re-
lieved, we moved back to No. 1 Camp, Kortepyp, and on
arrival there received a boon in the shape of a bath and change
of clothes.
At 1.30 p.m. the Battalion embussed on the Neuve-Eglise
Road for Fletre, and arrived at our camp N.E. of that village
two hours later. Soon after reaching the camp, orders were
received that the 2nd Australian Division was being trans-
ferred from the 2nd to the 4th Army, which was being wholly
re-constructed with a view to the complete relief of the sth
Army, then constituting the right flank of the British front.
This news put fresh vim into the boys, who were eager to
follow in the wake of our other Divisions already drawn into
the fight, a magnificent piece of work having been carried out
by the 4th Division, in filling a dangerous gap between the
IV. and I. Corps in the neighborhood of Hebuterne, North
of Albert.


On April 5 we were astir very early, and left the Fletre
Area at 1.30 a.m., reaching Codewaersvelde after an unplea-
sant march in the rain. Here we entrained at 4.30
a.m., and after a full day’s journey, reached St.
Roch-Amiens at 5.30 p.m. We then marched to Al-
lonville and billeted in the village. News came to hand that
during the previous morning the enemy had taken Vaire
Wood and Hamel, and had gained ground further South, in
the vicinity of Hangard, also that another attack was in pro-
gress from the Somme to the upper reaches of the Ancre,
and in consequence we were detailed to remain in readiness
if called upon.
The next day, April 6, the 2nd Australian Division re-
lieved the 35th English Division, which was holding the
Somme crossings and incidentally protecting the right flank
of the 3rd Australian Division. The 2nd Australian Division
was now defending the flank section of the Corps front from
Daours to Vaux-Sur-Somme, the role of the 27th Battalion
being to take over the sector extending from Aubigny to
Hamelet and Corbie inclusive, from the 18th and 17th Lan-
cashire Fusiliers.


CHAPTER XXIV.
THE “DIAMONDS” AGAIN ON THE SOMME—
CORBIE—BUIRE-SUR-ANCRE.
On April 6, at 9.30 a.m., the Battalion left Allonville for
Corbie, and en route through Daours, halted for the mid-day
meal in the partially sunken road North of that village.
Eventually reaching Corbie at 4 p.m., we were billeted in the
Northern edge of the village. Throughout the village there
were, everywhere, signs of the hurried evacuation of the ter-
rified civilians. Half-finished meals remained on the tables,
and in some instances valuable clothing was left in the ward-
robes, etc. It reflects great credit upon the conduct of the
troops that their commanders, without hesitation, should
billet them in a recently evacuated village, and later reports
by the French Mission in charge of evacuated areas state
that the inhabitants, on their return to Corbie, were surprised
and thankful to find their property in such splendid condition
after thousands of troops had occupied the village from time
to time.
The enemy intermittently shelled the Eastern edge
of the village and the Somme Canal and River
crossings, but fortunately no casualties resulted. Shortly
after oiar arrival we received orders in connection
with the relief of the 4th Australian Division in the left sec-
tor of the Corps front, by the 2nd Australian Division, the
7th Brigade having to relieve the 13th Brigade on the night
of the 7th/Bth of April.
Leaving Corbie at noon on the 7th, we marched, via
Franvillers, to Baizieux, and bivouacked in an orchard on the
Western edge of the village, where hot meals were prepared.
The enemy was shelling the village and the main road to
Warloy. A percentage of officers and other ranks was dis-
patched to the Divisional Reserve at Molliens-Au-Bois, and
the remainder of the Battalion moved forward at dusk for


the front line, where we relieved parts of the 50th and 52nd
Battalions, “D” and “B” Companies taking over the right and
left front line, with “C” and “A” Companies in supports and
reserve, Battalion Headquarters being at the Quarry.
The following morning the boys solemnly surveyed their
old rest area of 1916, which, although hard to realise, was now
their front line, on the edge of which was the remains of
the Edgehill Dressing Station, that had sheltered so many
wounded during the battles of Pozieres and Flers. Many
who had not previously done so now realised the magnitude
of the great enemy offensive, which, although defeated
in its main objects, completely overshadowed any of-
fensive attempted on this front up to that time. However,
it was most gratifying to know that Buire, although in ruins,
was still in our lines.
During the day small parties of the enemy were observed
moving about in the immediate vicinity of his front line.
Our snipers, taking advantage of every opportunity, accounted
for quite a number, and subsequent extracts from captured
enemy intelligence contained warnings to front line troops in
respect to their losses from our sniping. At the junction be-
tween “D” and “B” Companies’ posts, our line formed an
acute angle, a fact which called for the adoption of precau-
tionary methods during the reconnoissance of No Man’s Land.
Despite the wet weather and mud, the troops soon made
themselves fairly comfortable.
The whole of the Brigade support area was subjected to
heavy shelling, especially in the vicinity of the Quarry. The
nature of the shelling pointed to an increase of enemy artil-
lery, but although extensive movement was observed in his
rear lines, the enemy made no direct concentration for an at-
tack, which, however, was expected from the direction of
Albert.
He had made several attempts to advance and capture
the heights in the vicinity of Bouzincourt and Senlis.
During the night of the Bth a patrol of five other ranks,
under the command of Lieut. L. V. Parkes, while effecting
a reconnoissance of No Man’s Land, encountered an enemy
machine gun post, from which an intense fire was directed
against them. Lieut. Parkes was severely wounded, but with
the help of one of the patrol managed to regain our lines, the
remaining three being reported as missing. One of these men


(Pte. Brown) returned to our lines the following night,
wounded in three places by machine gun fire, he having re-
mained in a shell-hole in No Man’s Land for 24 hours.
On the night of April 10, we were relieved by the 25th
Battalion, and moved back into reserve. Battalion Head-
quarters, together with “B,” “C,” and “D” Companies, were
disposed at St. Laurence Farm, and “A” Company at Bresle.
From intelligence reports received, hopes were enter-
tained that the whole of the Australian Divisions would at
last become welded together into one pure Australian Corps,
allowance having been made for that object when the four
Divisions already in the Somme Area were attached to the
new 4th Army (under General Rawlinson) on April 8.
The force of the enemy’s attack upon the Somme sector
had apparently spent itself entirely, but local attacks in the
vicinity of Aveluy on the Ancre, and Hangard, South of
Villers-Bretonneaux, pointed to another desperate effort to
reach Amiens; a movement that would give the necessary el-
bow room to his troops crowded between the Avre and Ancre,
and also protect his exposed flank at Montdidier and further
S.E., the danger of which grew more acute as the junction
of the French and British front became more staple.
By reason of its close proximity to Amiens, and the ad-
vantage of observation from its high position, Villers-Breton-
neux became the real key position to the famous city, and all
eyes were turned in that direction. Disturbing news began
to arrive from the North, where, on April g, the enemy launch-
ed an attack on the left of the Ist Army front in the vain
attempt to keep his initial offensive mobile. At Bois Grenier
and Fleurbaix heavy fighting took place, and at night the fall
of Estaires became inevitable.
To fully exploit the successes of the first day’s fighting,
the enemy attacked the right of the 2nd Army the following
morning and drove in the front posts between Armentieres
and Messines, recently held by the 2nd Australian Division.
Further successes at Messines, Neuve-Eglise, and East of
Mont-Kemmel resulted in the inevitable withdrawal of the
Allied troops from the Passchendaele Ridge. Thus for the
second time since March 21, the enemy completely nullified
the successes which had cost the Australians many casualties
to attain.


Leaving St. Laurence Farm at 8 p.m. on April 16, we
moved into the front line and relieved the 25th Battalion in
our previously occupied positions, “D” and “A” Companies
taking over the right and left front line, with “B” and “C”
Companies in supports and reserves. Here Capt. Bice, with
parties from supports and reserves, commenced the most not-
able of all salvage work carried out by the Battalion, it
having been ascertained that valuable material still remained
in the partially ruined Edgehill Dressing Station. This sal-
vage work was daring in the extreme, and reflected great
credit upon ail ranks concerned, for the coolness displayed
and promptitude exercised throughout.
The salvage material, which consisted of iron bedsteads,
sheets, socks, shorts, etc., and a piano, was carried over a
hill, which could not be traversed in daylight, to a Quarry
situated about 1,200 yards in rear of the front line. .The
piano, together with other material, was afterwards convey-
ed under shellfire from the Quarry to Brigade Headquarters
by our G.S. waggons.
Our artillery support was steadily increasing, and from
time to time an annihilating fire was brought to bear upon
all likely concentration areas from which an enemy attack
could be launched, two particularly destructive shoots taking
place during the early morning of the 21st, when daylight
disclosed the fact that the remnant of Ville-Sur-Ancre Church
tower was missing, and the ruins of Dernancourt and Mor-
lancourt were burning.
On the night of the 18th a party of signallers, whilst run-
ning out wires to the front line, sustained several casualties.
The same night four of the enemy lost direction, and walking
into one of our posts, were taken prisoners, and incidentally
saved a projected raid.
On the 21st a gloom was cast over the Battalion by the
death of “C” Company’s Commander, Major K. H. Friede-
recks, who was killed by a shell in the support area. A strict
disciplinarian, he possessed the qualities that befit a Com-
manding Officer, and during his association with the Battalion
carried out his duties with confidence.
On the night of April 22/23, a re-adjustment of the line
resulted in the relief of our right line Company by the 10th
Brigade, whose left flank then connected with the right of
our left line Company. This left the 27th disposed with one


Company in the front line and three in supports and re-
serves, but the following night the 26th Battalion relieved
our left line Company, which took up a position in supports.
On the 26th/27th the 2nd Divisional Northern boundary
was extended, and the 27th became the support Battalion.
Our cookers remained on the Albert main road, with the
Companies disposed in trenches on both sides, and Battalion
Headquarters North of Ribemont, 500 yards South of the
Albert road.
On the night of the 30th April and Ist of May the 7th
Brigade was relieved in the Albert Area by the 55th Infantry
Brigade, and the 27th Battalion, being relieved by the 7th
Queen’s Regiment, marched to Bavelincourt and billeted in
the village. Upon the relief of the 2nd Division, it became
the right Corps reserve of the 4th Army.
On May 1 the greater part of “A” Company proceeded
to the Amiens Area by motor lorries, and camped at St.
Acheul, from which place parties were supplied for picquet
duties in Amiens, which had been temporarily evacuated by
the civil population and was “out of bounds” to all troops
except those whose duties necessitated their being there.
The same day the 7th Brigade commenced to move to the
Camon-Rivery Area. The 27th marched via Behencourt to
Pont-Noyelles, and arriving at 3 p.m., billeted there for the
night and resumed the march to Rivery at 1.40 p.m. the next
day. While passing through Querrieu, the enemy demon-
strated that he could still reach us by dropping a few shells
from his long range guns quite near to our column, but for-
tunately no casualties resulted.
Reaching Rivery we billeted in the Hospice St, Victor,
a spacious hospital which had been evacuated by the civilians.
Amiens was being subjected to long range shelling and night
air raids by the enemy, which caused fires to break out from
time to time in the Southern portion of the city. Training
was carried on throughout the Companies, “A” Company re-
joining the Battalion on the 4th.
On May 8 a percentage of officers, representing units of
the 7th Brigade, were conveyed to Merricourt by motor lorry,
and from there made a reconnaissance of the 3rd Australian
Divisional sector.

CHAPTER XXV.
MORLANCOURT.
On May n, 1918, in connection with the relief of the 3rd
by the end Division, the 27th Battalion left Rivery at 10
a.m. and marched by way of the main Albert road to the
La-Houssoye switch system of trenches. .Battalion Head-
quarters was established at the head of the gully between
Bonnay and La-Koussoye with the Companies disposed in a
general line left and right. The 7th Brigade was reserve Bri-
gade, the 6th Brigade having relieved the 10th Brigade in
the left Brigade sector on the night of May 9/10, and the
sth relieved the gth Brigade in the right Brigade sector on
the night of the ioth/nth.
There are few more picturesque spots than the N.W.
banks of the River Ancre, from which many miles of scenery
is visible. Away to the South lay Villers-Bretonneux, which
had recently been literally torn from the grasp of the enemy
by one British and the 13th and 15th Australian Brigades.
Flushed with his recent successes in the North, the enemy
using four complete Divisions, made his last bid for Amiens
on the morning of April 23. His tanks opened the way for
the Infantry South of Villers-Bretonneux, and had almost
reached their objective at Cachy before being stopped by our
heavier tanks. Villers-Bretonneux fell into his hands, but his
further advance was held up by the Bth English Division on
the Eastern edge of the Bois de Aquenne, West of the village.
The enemy had gained practically everything necessary for
the capture of Amiens, which could be rendered untenable by
shellfire, but before his great success could be fully exploited,
a brilliant counter-attack launched at 10 p.m. the same night,
by a Brigade of the 18th Division, and the 13th and 15th
Australian Infantry Brigades, saved the town.
At the foot of the gully towards Bonnay our concealed
batteries, together with the heavier gun positioned in the


Wood close to Battalion Headquarters, continually shelled
the enemy lines, and the retaliation that usually marked their
successful shooting made our position a very unenviable one,
and unfortunately two men of “A” Company were killed the
following day. Despite the enemy shelling, opportunity was
made during the brief rests to indulge in a swim in the Ancre
River, about 1,000 yards distant, where hot baths were also
established.
On May 18 we received orders that the 27th and 28th
Battalions were to move forward as supports to the 6th Bri-
gade during its attack on Ville-Sur-Ancre.
At 10 p.m. the following night, the 27th Battalion, under
the command of Major P. C. Raper, who assumed command
owing to the indisposition of Lieut.-Colonel F. R. Chalmers,
moved forward and relieved the 22nd Battalion in the sup-
port area, immediately North of Ribemont, Battalion Head-
quarters being established about 200 yards from the football
ground on which the 27th Battalion and the 10th Battalion
had played twelve months previously.
At 2 a.m., on May 20, the 6th Brigade launched an at-
tack on Ville-Sur-Ancre, the sth Brigade at the same time
advancing its left flank to conform with the movement. The
operation was a complete success, and casualties were exceed-
ingly light considering the capture of 200 prisoners, which
included three Officers and numerous machine guns.
That same night the 7th Brigade relieved the 6th Bri-
gade, the 27th Battalion relieving the 23rd and part of the
21st Battalion, in the left line sector. “C” and “B” Companies
took over the right and left line positions, with “A” Company
in support, and “D” Company in reserve. Battalion Head-
quarters took over the 23rd Battalion Headquarters for the
night, but a new Headquarters was established on the West-
ern edge of Buire, in a more advanced position, the following
day.
During the next two days several prisoners were dis-
covered hiding in cellars in the ruins of Ville-Sur-Ancre, which,
together with Buire, was subjected to heavy gas shelling by
the enemy. On the night of May 26/27, the 27th Battalion
was relieved by the 26th Battalion, and moved back to Ribe-
mont as reserve Battalion.
About noon on the 27th the enemy aircraft became very
active, and following some fine work by our planes, an enemy


plane, piloted by Hermann Wolfe, a noted enemy airman,
was brought down in flames close to Ribemont; the pilot, who
had been killed by a machine gun bullet, and the observer,
killed by the fall, were buried during the day.
On the night of May 31 and June 1, the 7th Brigade was
relieved by the 6th Brigade, and the 27th Battalion, on being
relieved by the 24th Battalion, moved back to its previously
occupied position between Bonney and La Houssoye, where
Lieut.-Colonel Chalmers resumed command of the Battalion.
During the relief enemy planes were heavily bombing the rear
areas, and unfortunately succeeded in inflicting about fifty
casualties in the 28th joattalion.
A general topic among the troops at this time was the
appointment of our old “digger boss,” General Bird wood, to
command the sth Army, General Monash succeeding him as
Corps Commander.
During the following days, the right Brigade sector held
by the sth Brigade was extensively reconnoitred by officers
and specialists, and the 7th Brigade relieved the sth Brigade
on the night of June 5/6, the 27th Battalion relieving part of
the 20th Battalion and one Company of the 18th Battalion
right of the sector; the 28th Battalion, relieving part of the
19th Battalion and one Company of the 20th Battalion, took
over the left line sector. Our front line on the 7th Brigade
sector, which was astride the Bray-Corbie road, offered no
advantage in front line observation; although splendid obser-
vation could be obtained of the enemy lines South-East of
the Somme, very little could be seen directly opposite, in the
direction of Bray and Malard Wood. When the 2nd Division
effected the relief of the 3rd Division, this defect and the
need for improvement of the line between Sailly-Laurette and
Morlancourt was fully explained to the Commanding Officers
of units, and information was given verbally that the 7th
Brigade would carry out the projected improvement. Al-
though absolute secrecy was enjoined among the C.O.’s of
units, such was hardly necessary, for the tactical training of
the men enabled them to realise the necessity for an im-
provement of their position, and before the attempt to amend
the line was made, its likelihood and purpose was fully ap-
parent to all.
On the night of June 6/7, the 27th Battalion moved
laterally to its right, and the 28th Battalion to its left, to

allow the 25th Battalion to take up a position as central
Battalion.
On June 9 we received instructions that the attack by
the 7th Brigade would be carried out on June 10, zero hour
being 9.45 p.m. In conjunction with the attack, the 13th Bri-
gade (4th Division) was to push forward its left flank to
conform with the right of the 7th Brigade movement, and
the 6th Brigade, on the left flank, was to carry out two raids.
The attack was to be delivered by three Battalions, the 27th
(“A” Battalion) on the right, the 25th (“B” Battalion) in the
centre, and the 28th (“C” Battalion) on the left. The for-
mation of the attack to be in two waves, three Companies in
the first wave, in normal formation, and one Company in the
second; the first wave to jump off from the front line trench,
and the other from the support line. The 26th Battalion was
immediate support Battalion, and the 18th battalion was in
reserve to the 7th Brigade. During the hours of darkness on
the night preceding the attack, the assembly trenches were
widened and deepened, and stores, ammunition, and extra
water were carried forward.
On the night of June 9/10, “B” Company moved up and
occupied a central line position between “A” and “D” Com-
panies, which were holding the right and left line of the 27th
Battalion sector respectively, and “C” Company moved up
into a newly dug support trench.
Movement was kept down as much as possible during the
day between our front and support lines, and the nature of
the enemy’s shelling revealed that they had no suspicion of
cur preparations for the attack. Our Trench Mortar Bat-
teries carried out some valuable work, especially the “six-inch
Newton’s,” which cut large gaps in the enemy’s wire en-
tanglements and drove the personnel of the enemy’s forward
posts to take shelter in their main trench. From the front
line practically nothing could be seen of our intended objec-
tives, and during the afternoon of June 10 the Company Com-
manders, who were to participate in the attack, made a careful
reconnaissance of the position from the 27th Battalion obser-
vation post in the Clermont trench.
The 27th Battalion order of attack was as follows:—“A”
Company, under the command of Capt. Wiltshire, right at-
tacking company; “B” Company, under Capt. Beddome,
centre; and “D” Company, under Lieut. J. Blacket, left at-


tacking Company; with “C” Company, under Capt. Elder,
M.C., in supports. Much more interest was attached to this
operation than, perhaps, was realised by the participants.
The fixing of zero hour at g. 45 p.m. was a departure from
the usual, and although severely criticised, was certainly a
wise proposition, in view of the few hours of darkness avail-
able to effect a complete consolidation, which would be almost
impossible during daylight, owing to our objective being on
the forward slope of a hill and in full view of the enemy.
During the evening, Lieut.-Col. Chalmers established his ad-
vanced Headquarters, the approach to which was known as
the “Mad Mile,” in the gully immediately in rear of the
“jumping off” line. Evidently our extra movement, towards
dusk, had been noticed by the enemy and interpreted as pre-
parations for a “relief,” for just prior to the opening of the
attack an enemy plane attempted a close reconnaissance of
our rear lines, which were subsequently subjected to heav3 r
shelling. Capt. Beddome was wounded in the “jumping off”
trench, and the command of “B” Company was taken over by
Capt. Burton.
Punctually at 9.45 p.m., our artillery and machine gun
barrage, splendidly supported by the medium and light trench
mortar batteries, came down upon the enemy, and the attack-
ing troops moved forward to within 70 yards of the barrage,
which, on the 27th Battalion’s sector, particularly on that of
“A” Company, opened most erratically, several rounds from
the 18-pounders and 4.5 howitzers falling short on the
“jumping off” line, causing a number of casualties. This
was soon obviated by the general advance of the boys to the
enemy wire and trench on the brow of the hill. Although
the rate of fire was perfect, our barrage moved forward too
quickly from the enemy’s trench, where our boys met with
a stubborn resistance, necessitating the free and effective use
of the bayonet. Our ultimate objective was reached shortly
after 10 p.m. During the advance, Lieut. J. Blacket was
killed, and the command of “D” Company was taken over by
Lieut. Matters. Lieut. Wood was also mortally wounded.
Contact with our flanks was maintained throughout the
attack, and upon reaching our objective, its consolidation was
rapidly carried out. During the few remaining hours of dark-
ness a well-sited and commanding position was established,
which reflected great credit upon all those concerned.


Immediately following the attack, the enemy shelling fell
heavily upon the new support trench, particularly near the
cemetery and the gully to the west, where the Battalion Aid
Post was situated. Throughout the night our stretcher-
bearers braved the shelling, in their untiring efforts to relieve
the suffering of the wounded, and many lives were saved by
their bravery and promptitude.
Although our forward communication was severed
several times, the observers kept Battalion Headquarters well
informed as to the progress of the operation on the whole
Brigade front, thus curtailing the use of runners to a large
extent. The counter-battery work by our artillery was most
instrumental in keeping down the enemy heavy shelling until
our consolidation was perfected.
Shortly after midnight the 27th Battalion was disposed,
with the three Companies that carried out the attack, in the
new line—each having consolidated a position mutually sup-
porting the other—and “C” Company in the first old German
trench, with one platoon of the 26th Battalion in close support
in the old front line; thus we were well prepared for any
counter-attacks.
Among the courageous and unselfish deeds for which
decorations were awarded, the most admired throughout the
Battalion was that of Pte. B. Butler, D.C.M. Rapidly gaining
the enemy’s first trench, he made his way, singlehanded, along
the communication trench leading to the ultimate objective,
accounting for seventeen of the enemy before clearing the
trench. The indomitable spirit and daring displayed by all
ranks throughout the fight make it hard to individualise, but
the names of Sergeant Young and Private Butler are worthy
of mention.
The circumstances surrounding the death of Lieut. J.
Blacket helped considerably to create a feeling of disgust and
contempt towards the enemy. Known to all as “Joe,” Lieut.
Blacket was an officer who held the complete confidence of
his men. Fighting every inch of the way with his Company,
he observed the arrogance of a captured German officer, and
fearing that his conduct would not be tolerated by the men,
and might lead to his death, Lieut. Blacket ordered him to be
taken to the rear as prisoner. He had hardly given the order,
however, when the German produced a revolver and fired
point blank at Lieut. Blacket, killing him instantly.


PLAN OF MORLANCOURT OPERATION JUNE 10TH 1918


The number of enemy killed on the Battalion sector was
130, and two officers and 87 other ranks were captured.
Among the trophies captured were 10 machine guns and two
Minenwerfers. Our casualties during the operation were one
dfficer and eight other ranks killed, and two officers and 72
other ranks wounded. Lieut. Wood subsequently died of his
wounds, and together with Lieut. J. Blacket and other com-
rades, was buried in Franvillers Cemetery.
At daybreak the following morning, a large party of the
enemy were observed in the gully running towards Sailly-
Laurette, and the machine gunners on the right of “A” Com-
pany effectively dispersed them, causing many casualties.
Gradually the enemy began to locate our new line, and his
field artillery began to shell our posts. On numerous occa-
sions our artillery support was requisitioned to silence the
batteries firing point blank from Malard Wood, but although
our heavy batteries kept the shelling down to some extent,
our troops were subjected to a nerve-racking and consistent
shelling throughout the day and night.
On the night of June 12, the 7th Battalion took over
about 600 yards of the 6th Brigade sector, the 28th, 25th, and
27th Battalions moving laterally to the left for a distance of
200 yards.
Despite the numerous concentrated efforts by the enemy
artillery to drive our front line back across the hill, we held
resolutely to our position for four days following the attack,
when the 7th Brigade was relieved by the Bth Brigade, on
the night of June 14/15. The 27th Battalion was relieved by
the 32nd Battalion, and marched back to the Fran sector, oc-
cupying practically the same position, in the gully north-west
of Bonnay, as that held prior to relieving the 20th Battalion,
but it was not until the early hours of June 15 that the Bat-
talion settled down to a much-needed sleep.
In connection with the relief of the 15th Brigade by the
7th Brigade, we left the Fran sector at 1.45 p.m., moved by
way of Pont-Noyelles and the Querrieu-Allonville road, to
the Allonville area, and took over from the 57th Battalion in
the Bois de Mai, about 2,000 yards north-east of Allonville.
We bivouacked in the wood, under tents and trench shelters.


The 2nd Division was now Corps Reserve, and during the
next ten days carried on a series of defensive training, spend-
ing the spare time at cricket and other sport.
Several times we were visited at night by hostile planes,
vainly searching for our Reserve Tank parks, but although
there was a huge ammunition dump nearby, no bombs were
dropped near enough to cause any undue alarm. Several
showery days were experienced, and we had occasion to re-
build our rude bivouacs, but that was a trifling matter, and
nothing seriously concerned the boys now they had secured
a brief rest prior to making the acquaintance of the enemy
in the famous Villers-Bretonneux area.


CHAPTER XXVI.
VILLERS-BRETONNEUX.
On June 26, 1918, in connection with the relief of the
3rd Division (which was holding the right Divisional sector
of the Australian Corps front) by the 2nd Division, the 7th
Brigade relieved the 10th Brigade in the reserve area.
Leaving Allonville at 7 a.m., the 27th Battalion marched
due south, and crossing the Somme River near Lamotte, re-
lieved the 38th Battalion at Blangy-Tronville. “A” and “B”
Companies were disposed in the embankment on the Aubigny-
Tronville road, about 800 yards distant from the last-named
village; “C” and “D” Companies astride the Amiens-Villers-
Bretonneux road, near the White Chateau; and Battalion
Headquarters at Blangy-Tronville. The officers and special-
ists detailed to remain out of the line on this occasion march-
ed to the Divisional nucleus camp, situated about 1,500 yards
north of Lamotte.
On the night of June 27/28, the 7th Brigade relieved the
nth Brigade in the right Brigade sub-sector; the 26th Bat-
talion taking over the right line sector from the 41st Bat-
talion, the 25th Battalion the left line from the 44th Battalion.
The 28th Battalion relieved the 43rd Battalion in the right
support line, and the 27th Battalion the 42nd Battalion in
the left support line. The 27th Battalion Headquarters was
at the White Chateau, and one Company was disposed in
Villers-Bretonneux temporarily under the command of the
C.O. of the 25th Battalion.
To facilitate a complete understanding of the vicissitudes
of the Battalion in this famous area, it is necessary to deal
in part with almost the whole Australian Corps sector. The
Corps, which now included the whole of the Australian Di-
visions, with the exception of the Ist, which was attached to
the French troops in the vicinity of Meteren and Merris, con-


stituted the extreme right flank of the 4th Army, and inci-
dentally of the British Army, the connection at the right being
with the 31st French Corps.
The 2nd Australian Division held the right Divisional
sector of the Australian Corps front, the 7th Brigade the right
Brigade sub-sector, with the 26th Battalion in line connecting
with the French at the International Post near Monument
Wood. Collective Intelligence revealed heavy concentration
of enemy reserve troops between th Somme River and Mont-
didier, and as the general line of the Australian Corps from
the Somme to Hangard offered a tempting bait for another
drive by the enemy upon Amiens, Villers-Bretonneux remain-
ed a position of vital importance, and was therefore garrisoned
accordingly.
Hopes were entertained that the new Corps Commander
would authorise his right Divisional front to debouch from
the edge of the village, and thus minimise the consistent
shelling on the part of the enemy. However, news came to
hand that preparations were being made for an attack upon
Hamel, further north.
On July 2, instructions were received that the attack
would be carried out by the 6th, 4th, nth, and 15th Brigades,
reading from right to left of the line—the 25th Battalion, with
one Company of the 27th Battalion, to assist the 6th Brigade
movement. The object of the operation was to capture Hamel
village and the Vaire and Hamel Woods, situated upon the
fairly high spur running from the main Villers-Bretonneux
plateau to Bouzincourt on the south bank of the Somme and
south of Sailly-le-Sec. One distinct advantage of the opera-
tion was that it robbed the enemy of his front line observation
over the gully west of Sailly-le-Sec. This gully was known
among the boys as Nanny-Goat Gully, by reason of the goat
which used to feed there despite the enemy shelling, but it
may be better remembered by members of the Battalion as
rear Battalion Headquarters during the Morlancourt opera-
tions.
At this time the 33rd American Division was training in
rear of the 4th Army, and a percentage of its officers and
specialists were attached to the Australian Corps for front line
experience. A strong friendship sprang up between the
American and Australian reserve troops in the vicinity of
Blangy-Tronville and Amiens, and excitement ran high in the

2 7 TH BATTALION COOKERS, NEAR CLERY-SUR-SOMME, SEPTEMBER, 1918.


American camps when it became known that 1,000 of their
troops had been attached to the Australian Corps for the
forthcoming battle, and when later news reached them that
zero hour had been fixed for 3.10 a.m., July 4.
Shortly after 2.30 a.m. on July 4, the 27th Battalion
“stood to” in readiness to assist in the battle if called upon,
but fortunately the operation, which, without doubt, had been
splendidly organised, met with complete success, and resulted
in the capture of about 1,500 prisoners, many machine guns,
and other war material.
On the night of July 5/6, the 27th Battalion relieved the
25th Battalion in the left line sector, and the 26th Battalion,
holding the right line, were relieved the following night.
“D” and “A” Companies took over the right and left line
positions. The following night, during the relief of the 6th
Brigade, in the left sub-sector, by the sth Brigade, a re-
adjustment of the inter-Brigade boundary was effected, which
resulted in the 18th Battalion taking over that portion of the
27th Battalion sector left of the Villers-Bretonneux main road,
the 27th Battalion moving laterally to its right took over
portion of the 28th Battalion sector on the night of July 7/8.
The 27th Battalion Headquarters was situated on the northern
side of the main Villers-Bretonneux road, about 250 yards
west of the railway bridge on the western edge of the village.
Consequent upon the recent success at Hamel, the Corps
front line receded in a south-westerly direction at an angle
of 45 degrees, and the enemy field artillery pumped high ve-
locity and gas shells into the south-eastern edge of Villers-
Bretonneux at an alarming rate. However, the demand from
the Corps Commander to debouch from the edge of the village
and conform to the line in general was welcomed by General
Rosenthal, who, in carrying out the operation openly, gave
scope to the style of warfare that suits the temperament of
the Australian Infantryman, and what he jocularly refers to
as “peaceful penetration.” Armed with rifle, bayonet, and
Mills’ bombs, with the inner armour of self-initiative and con-
fidence, he reaches his objective by what has been described
by the German Higher Command as sheer audacity.
At 10 a.m., July 8, the 27th Battalion advanced its line
in the manner described above, and further exploited the
success attained by taking another tiench the same night.
Some idea of the surprise effected by the movement can be


gained from the fact that not one casualty was incurred during
the advance. For this splendid piece of work, Lieut. J.
Colman, who led the movement, was awarded the M.C., and
received the unstinted praise of the Brigadier. The following
is a copy of the 7th Brigade report upon the operation: —
7th AUSTRALIAN INFANTRY BRIGADE.
Headquarters,
Bth July, 1918.
Headquarters,
2nd Australian Division.
REPORT ON MINOR OPERATION, JULY 8, 1918.
At 10 a.m. to-day the 27th Battalion sent out a strong patrol
under Lieut. W. R. G. Colman, 27th Battalion. This party entered
the enemy's trench at C.sS.b.g.i. and moved in a north-easterly direc-
tion. At the same time a second patrol left our block at P.3i.b.3.g.
and moved in a south-westerly direction.
The first party surprised an enemy post, capturing 13 prisoners
(265 R.1.R.), 1 heavy M.G., ar.d killing 6 Germans. This length of
trench was captured by 10.40 a.m., and then occupied by a Company
of 27th Battalion. A block was established at P.2i.b.05.35.
At 12.16 p.m. to-day the same two parties under Lieut. Colman,
entered the enemy’s trench south of the road at and
worked along the trench in a south-westerly direction. This part of
the trench was cleared very quickly. Four prisoners (97 1.R.) were
captured, and 1 L.M.G. The enemy trench running from the road
at P.31.C.05.95., to 0.36.d.8.4., to 0.36.d.5.4., was then occupied with-
out opposition, and the newly captured trenches in 0-36. d. occupied
with one Company of 27th Battalion.
A post was established along the northern side of the railway
at 0.36^.25.30.
Enemy Infantry showed no fight and there was no hostile artillery
or machine gun fire. Late in the afternoon the enemy started sniping
at a distance of 1,000 yards.
The trenches captured were in fair condition, and though very
shallow in parts, still serve a very good continuous line with a good
field of fire.
The whole operation was carried out with exceptional skill, daring
and promptness, and reflected the greatest credit on all who took
part.
There were no casualties on our side.
Man. A. Wisdon,
Brig. General,
Commanding 7th Australian Infantry Brigade.


For several days the enemy’s outpost line, opposing the
2nd Divisional front, was continually attacked in this manner
and captured practically in open daylight, and with such ease
that the German Higher Command found it necessary to
severely admonish its line Divisions. Ideal weather conditions
considerably augmented the unprecedented value of our grand
observation from the edge of Villers-Bretonneux, and although
a very unhealthy position, the “Doll’s House,” the last house
standing on the eastern edge of the village, afforded splendid
visibility over the enemy’s forward lines and the villages of
Bayonvillers and Wiencourt-l’Equipee, in the vicinity of which
two heavy guns were observed in action against the French,
further south in the Moreuil sector. Liaison was established
with our long-range artillery observers, and the gun near
Bayonvillers was fired upon, but was successfully withdrawn
before our guns could record a hit. The gun firing from the
vicinity of Wiencourt was better camouflaged by the heavy
trees lining the Wiencourt-Marcelcave road, only the end of
the barrel being visible when firing. On a clear day the
enemy hospitals near Rosieres and Caix were plainly visible
through the telescopes.
The principal observation posts of the enemy were the
water tower near Marcelcave, a house situated on the western
edge of Warfuse-Abancourt, and the church tower at Bayon-
villers.
On the night of July 12/13, the 27th Battalion was re-
lieved by the 25th Battalion, and became left support Bat-
talion, being disposed in the vicinity of the White Chateau,
where Battalion Headquarters was situated.
Abbe Wood, close to the White Chateau, and the main
Amiens road, was receiving much more shelling than during
our last tour of duty there, and many hundreds of gas shells
fell in the vicinity of the “Clock Face,” a position in the centre
of the Wood where four different roads crossed each other,
and where a guide was fixed to ensure correct direction.
The 7th Brigade’s aggressive tour of duty for July was
.concluded with a brilliant little operation which was carried
out by the 25th and 26th Battalions on the night of July 17.
Prior to the battle, “B” Company of the 27th Battalion was
attached temporarily to the 25th Battalion. Notable strong
points included in the 26th Battalion’s objective were the


mound in the vicinity of the road-crossing on the heavy
Amiens-Peronne railway, and Monument Wood.
At 9.45 p.m., July 17, the attack opened, and following
some spirited bayonet fighting the attacking Battalions
reached their objective, capturing about 150 prisoners and
several machine and anti-tank guns.
Despite determined counter-attacks by the enemy, the
new line was firmly held, and numerous casualties were sus-
tained by the enemy in the vicinity of Monument Wood, near
which our advanced posts were subjected to heavy shelling
the following day.
At dusk on the 18th, the 27th Battalion Headquarters
moved forward to the western edge of Villers-Bretonneux, the
enemy having shown signs of launching a counter-attack in
force at nightfall, which, however, did not materialise beyond
a little extra shelling of our front line positions.
On the night of July 19/20, the 7th Brigade was relieved
in the right line sub-sector by the 6th Brigade, and became
reserve Brigade. The 27th Battalion, upon being relieved by
the 21st Battalion, relieved the 24th Battalion in the Aubigny
system, Battalion Headquarters again taking up quarters at
the White Chateau.
At this time tremendous excitement prevailed among the
French and French-Colonial troops bivouacked in the southern
edge of Abbe Wood. With the enthusiasm so characteristic
of their race, they eagerly conveyed the latest news from the
French front to our boys, who were equally satisfied with the
news and ready to congratulate them upon their success in
the Rheims sector. The enemy had launched a great attack
upon the French front on July 15, and during the following
two days had enveloped Rheims, crossed the River Marne,
and created a huge salient at Chateau-Thierry, one end of
which at Chezy-en-Orxois was only 3g miles, as the crow flies,
from Paris.
At the very moment that the enemy strove to exploit his
successes by making another thrust south-west, between
Montidier and Soissons, that Napoleon of modern warfare,
Marshal Foch, made a counter thrust on the western side of


the Chateau-Thierry salient, from the Marne to Soissons, using
his French and American reserves to such effect as to capture
many thousands of prisoners and nearly 200 guns, and cause
the enemy’s retirement from the salient.
This, however, defeated the last attempt of an offensive
character undertaken by the German Army, and incidentally
gave the preliminary signal for the Allies to perfect the par-
tially projected offensive that was to overshadow that made
by the enemy in March, 1918.
On July 25, the 27th Battalion was relieved by the 26th
Battalion, and moved back to the Blangy trench system,
situated west of Blangy Wood and south of the Amiens-St.
Quentin main road. The Battalion was disposed upon fairly
high ground, viewed from which, the Somme valley from
Amiens to Corbie, presented a panoramic glory. About 1,000
yards east of the camp on the northern edge of Blangy Wood
stood a pretty French villa, known as Red Lodge, which was
being used as a French Headquarters. From the vicinity of
the Wood several batteries of the famous little French 75’s
continually harassed the enemy south-east of Cachy.
The boys spent their spare time at cricket and swimming
in the Somme, and several spent pleasant hours in conversa-
tion with the French Artillerymen bivouacked near by.
On July 29, the 27th Battalion was conveyed by motor
lorries to the vicinity of the Tank Park, north-west of Amiens,
where they practised the latest methods of Tank and Infantry
co-operation. On July 31, the 27th Battalion relieved the 26th
Battalion in the Aubigny system, with Battalion Head-
quarters disposed at the White Chateau.

CHAPTER XXVII.
AUGUST 8, 1918—THE LAST QUARTER.
The Allied Command had now decided to launch the
initial phase of the great offensive from the Fourth Army
front, and in consequence a depletion of actual front line
personnel began to take place, resulting in the relief of the
sth Brigade, which left the 6th Brigade in possession of the
2nd Division front.
By August 5 the activity in rear of our lines had increased
tenfold, many Tanks, heavy guns, and thousands of rounds
of ammunition were brought forward and dumped in readiness
for the final act. Many amusing and conflicting rumours
were abroad, although secrecy was maintained as to the actual
participants in the advance. The popular rumour that the
great attack would be opened on the memorable August 4
suffered a rather disappointing death, and the arrival of the
Canadian Corps, which commenced the relief of the 4th Di-
vision, considerably enhanced the value of the rumour that the
Canadians and Americans would launch the attack. All doubts
were set at rest when we received instructions covering the
action to be taken by the 7th Brigade, and these, together
with a few details covering the Australian Corps front, will
enable the reader to follow the general advance more closely.
The Corps front, extending from the River Somme
(northern flank) to the Amiens-Peronne railway (southern
flank), was approximately 7,000 yards wide at the “jumping
off” line. Owing to the southern Corps boundary running in
a south-easterly direction, the width of the front became
greater as the advance progressed, but this was to be obviated
by an increase in the Corps personnel when it reached a line
from which the Fourth Army would cc-operate directly with
the Third Army on its left.


The attacking Divisions of the Australian Corps front in
the first phase of the advance, reading from left to right, were
the 2nd and 3rd Divisions each attacking with two Brigades,
and from right to left the 7th, sth, gth, and nth Brigades
were the foremost troops in the initial assault. The depth of
the advance in the first phase was an average of 3,600 yards,
the objective being the “Green Line,” which from south to
north extended from the main road on the north-eastern edge
of Marcelcave to the eastern edge of Lamotte-en-Santerre,
thence to the south bank of the Somme west of Cerisy-Gailly.
Four hours after the opening of the first phase of the
advance, the sth and 4th Divisions were to pass through the
2nd and 3rd Divisions respectively and capture the Red and
Blue Lines, the ultimate objective extending, in the south,
from the south-west to the eastern edge of Harbonnieres,
along the old Amiens defence line to the banks of the Somme,
north of Merricourt-sur-Somme and east of the prominent
Chipilly Spur. On the right flank of the Australian Corps the
Canadian Corps was to co-operate with the attack, the 3rd
Corps doing likewise on the left flank.
The attacking Battalions on the 7th Brigade front were
the 26th Battalion right, 28th Battalion centre, and 27th Bat-
talion left, the 25th Battalion being in support. On the right
flank of the 7th Brigade, the 26th Battalion connected with
the 19th Battalion of the 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade, and
on the left, the 27th Battalion connected with the igth Bat-
talion, sth Australian Infantry Brigade; thus the 7th Brigade
was flanked by two units bearing the same number.
The 27th Battalion order of battle was “C” and “D” right
and left line Companies attacking in two waves, with “B” and
“A’’ Companies in support and reserve, under artillery forma-
tion.
“C” Company of the 2nd Tank Battalion co-operated with
the 7th Brigade, No. 12 section with three Tanks being at-
tached to the 27th Battalion, each Tank having a Battalion
observer attached as a scout and guide.
Tapes were laid by the Battalion observers between the
Infantry and Tank start lines. The role of the Tanks, after
opening the way for the Infantry to the Green Line, was to
patrol beyond the objective until its consolidation was well in
hand, then to withdraw to the rear, dump their loads of sup-


plies at selected spots, and under cover await developments
of the second phase of the advance.
From 9.30 p.m. to midnight, August 7, our low-flying
aeroplanes flew continually above the front lines forward of
Villers-Bretonneux for the purpose of drowning the noise
made by the Tanks in reaching their assembly positions, and
again for one hour prior to zero hour, which had been fixed
for 4.20 a.m., August 8.
Two hours and a half after zero hour, a contact plane
flew above the Green Line, and by means of sounding a suc-
cession of A’s on the Klaxon horn and firing white flares,
called to the Infantry to fire trench flares to enable the aerial
observer to map the position of the new line for immediate
despatch to Corps Headquarters. The planes co-operating in
the movement carried special markings which conveyed to the
Infantry their particular duties, the contact planes having
rectangular panels on both lower planes, and those working
with Tanks black bands on the middle of the right side of the
tail.
Five Field Artillery Brigades covered the advance of the
7th Brigade, providing a creeping barrage of high explosive,
which, starting 200 yards in advance of the Artillery start line,
was closely followed by the Tanks and Infantry until the
Green Line was reached; the barrage then became stationary
on a line some 400 yards in advance of the troops, protecting
them during the consolidation of the objective, while some of
the guns searched further forward to the limit of their ranges
Two-thirds of the heavy artillery was engaged in counter-
battery work from zero onwards, with all available guns
shelling trench systems and strong points, and particular care
was exercised to keep the heavy shelling 600 yards forward
of the light creeping barrage.
The consolidation of the Green Line was to be hurried
on until the order to discontinue was received from Brigade
Headquarters, and immediately following the advance of the
15th Brigade (right attacking Brigade of the sth Division)
through the 27th Battalion in the second phase, the defence
of the sub-sector was to be organised in depth, troops to be
re-organised in companies and platoons, and the 28th Bat-
talion to retire to a support position, there to await eventu-
alities.


The 27th Battalion Headquarters at zero hour was situat-
ed about 1,000 yards east of Villers-Bretonneux, and after the
advance about 1,300 yards in rear of the Green Line.
On August 6, Lieut. Matters (Acting Intelligence Officer)
and two observers reconnoitred the assembly and “jumping
off” positions. The same officer was afterwards wounded by
shell fire at the White Chateau, his duties being taken over
by Lieut. Colman, M.C. During the day the Battalion sup-
plied a carrying party of 40 men to the Trench Mortar Bat-
tery forward of Villers-Bretonneux.
At 12.30 a.m., August 8, the 27th Battalion commenced
to move, via the northern and eastern edge of Villers-
Bretonneux, to its assembly position, which was reached at
3.30 a.m. The front line was being held by a thin screen'of
6th Brigade troops, which were withdrawn to a reserve area
upon the arrival of the attacking troops. During the night, a
group of Tanks loaded with stores, and attached to the sth
Division, were burnt out as a result of enemy shelling.
Shortly after 3.30 a.m., the enemy began to shell the position
occupied by the 26th and 27th Battalions, causing about 15
casualties, but a prompt counter-battery action by our artillery
caused the shelling to ease down. It was rather cold waiting
for the word to go, and to make conditions more uncomfort-
able a ground mist arose and prevented visibility beyond a few
yards.
Until quite recently the enemy had completely dominated
the whole battle front, and the troops were tired of carrying
out what appeared to them to be futile attempts to stem the
tide of enemy success, yet the morale in general of that long
line of anxious men was of the highest order. Although the
majority were but vaguely aware of the intentions of the
attack, in the main, they instinctively felt, that it was really
the beginning of the end, and ever remindful of the past four
years of waiting, the determination to exercise every ounce
of fighting strength was the crowning factor in the mind of
each individual. Despite the feverish activity in rear of the
line, and the continual drone of our planes overhead, the time
seemed to pass all too slowly, but the never-to-be-forgotten
moment arrived, and immediately following a mighty flash
and roar, a tornado of shells, hurled from thousands of guns,
signalled the challenge of the 4th British Army to the 2nd
German Army, on the dawn of what the great Ludendorff
has openly declared to be the day of Germany’s doom.


PLAN OF AUGUST 8 T H 1918 OPERATION


At the word “go,” the boys, with a confidence as great
as the movement itself, advanced forward into the veil of mist
which was soon further intensified by the drifting smoke and
powder from our advancing barrage. Although the main di-
rection was lost for a while, and the Units began to overlap
each other, sound judgment and initiative were displayed by
senior officers and men, and the general line of advance was
kept intact.
In the great onrush, support Companies became front line
troops and all Units composite, but all worked amicably to-
gether, hugging our barrage, and in many instances having
to wait for its transfer from one line to another, meanwhile
keeping up a clever and effective co-operation with our sup-
porting Tanks. Those of our boys whose advance was tem-
porarily delayed by their attentiveness in putting “paid” to
the “account rendered” by a few extra courageous enemy
gunners, soon regained their direction in general, from the
flight of our shells.
Every yard of captured ground was carefully “mopped
up,” and within a short time large groups of astonished
prisoners were being escorted back to our rear lines, where
many hundreds, of all ranks, testified to the overwhelming
surprise effected by cur attack.
While some of our vanguard passed through the first
main trench system of the enemy without opposition, others
met with stubborn resistance, which needed all the daring and
courage that have qualified men for the highest of all awards,
for bravery. Such bravery cannot be better illustrated than
by the snlendid conduct of Sgt. Grant, of “B” Company, 27th
Battalion. A majority of his Company was held up by a
machine gun post; with wonderful judgment he completely
outflanked the enemy and captured the position, two officers,
47 men, and two machine guns. The value of his action could
not possibly be over-estimated, and he was strongly recom-
mended for the V.C. Unfortunately, this brave fellow was
killed in action near Grandcourt on October 3, a few hours
before the notification reached the Battalion that, for his brave
action on August 8, he had been awarded the D.C.M.
Shortly after 6.30 a.m., the objective of the first phase
was reported finally captured, many of our boys having to


CONTINUED PLAN OF AUGUST 8TH 1918 OPERATION


wait until the barrage lifted before being able to commence
its consolidation. It was a great advance, the enemy artillery
retaliation being rather intense for a while, their light field
guns firing a few rounds point blank at the boys, who im-
mediately rushed the position and captured almost every bat-
tery and its personnel intact.
About 7 a.m., the mist began to rise and disappear almost
as quickly as it had appeared before the attack, and the sight
that met the eye was almost indescribable—great Tanks were
moving slowly here and there, carrying out their respective
duties, planes droned immediately overhead feverishly trying
to locate the line in general. Immediately in rear another
great avalanche, consisting of the Infantry of the sth Division,
with cavalry, Tanks, and guns, were concentrating, ready to
pass through the vanguard of the 2nd Division and carry out
the second phase of the grand assault. During that three
hours of mist those responsible were certainly anxious as to
the results of the first phase, for with such a curtain prevent-
ing direct visibility, many incidents could happen to retard
our intentions in the main, but the brilliant efforts by our
Air Service and the dearth of the enemy’s artillery action
quickly conveyed to the Higher Command the fact that suc-
cess was assured.
It is doubtful whether less experienced troops could have
reached the objective, so deep within the enemy lines, with
practically only the controlling fire of our artillery to guide
them, and had the men sought cover from the point blank
action of the enemy’s field guns, instead of rushing their po-
sitions, fearful casualties would inevitably have resulted
among the great mass of troops concentrated in the rear area.
At 8.20 a.m., the 15th Brigade passed through our line,
accompanied by Tanks, including most of those which had
rendered such splendid work during the first phase. Many
of our boys were extremely eager to follow up the attack,
and the temptation to swell the ranks of the attacking Brigade
was indeed great. The Cavalry passed through about 9 a.m.,
and shortly after, the passing of several large batches of
prisoners told, only too plainly, of the success of the second
phase.
About 5 p.m., several two-wheeled vehicles were detached
from that great mass of moving transport, and suddenly a
familiar smell revealed the presence of the Battalion’s cooks,
and within a short time the boys, realising they were hungry,


settled down to a much-appreciated hot meal. It is reported
that the extra hungry endeavoured to bribe the cooks with
all kinds of souvenirs captured in the fray. Towards nightfall
the success of the great attack was assured, the only disap-
pointing incident in the whole operation occurring on the
extreme left flank of the Corps, which had to be refuged back
to conform with the general line of the Third Corps, which
had experienced great difficulty in clearing the Chipilly Spur
immediately north of the Somme.
The enemy, while remaining in possession of the most
prominent feature surrounding Chipilly, was naturally able
to bring an enfilade fire to bear on the Corps’ left flank, but
most of the enemy’s artillery action was drawn from our
troops by the repeated but unsuccessful attempts of the right
Brigade of the 3rd Corps during the night to clear up the
situation. The uncertainty of our future movements did not
seriously interfere with the intention of the troops to get a
few hours’ sleep, which worked wonders with all ranks, and
but for a desultory shelling by enemy long-range guns, a
comparatively restful night was passed.
One of the surprises of the operation was the compara-
tively small number of casualties—five other ranks killed, and
one officer and 42 other ranks wounded. Chief amongst the
27th Battalion captures were: —9 77-m.m. guns, 1 wireless
plant, 25 machine guns, 2 officers and 200 other ranks
prisoners.


CHAPTER XXVIII.
EXPLOITING SUCCESSES.
Early on the morning of August 9, 1918, the 27th Bat-
talion, still disposed in the vicinity of the first objective taken
the previous day, received orders that the 7th Brigade would
participate in a further advance, to be made by the Australian
Corps, the same day. Following upon the brilliant successes
of the previous day, the Army Commander had decided to
continue the advance, and with combined movement by the
Australian and Canadian Corps, sought to sever the rather
important railway connection between Chaulne and Roye.
The advance on the Australian Corps front was to have
been made by the Ist Division, which had been withdrawn
from the north, but owing to the long march from Amiens,
the troops were not able to arrive in time, and to ensure cor-
rect co-operation with the Canadians, the 15th and Bth Bri-
gades were directed to carry out the first phase of the attack
during the forenoon, the villages of Vauvillers and Framer-
ville being the principal objectives of the respective Brigades.
The second phase was to be carried out by the Ist and
2nd Divisions, which were to pass through the 15th and Bth
Brigade fronts respectively at 4.30 p.m. the same day. The
7th and sth were the right and left attacking Brigades of the
2nd Division, the 2nd Brigade being on the right flank of the
7th Brigade, which attacked with two Battalions, the 25th on
the right and the 27th Battalion on the left, both on a two
Company front, with one Company in support and one in
reserve.
The objective of the 27th Battalion was a series of sunken
roads south-east of Framerville, very strongly held by enemy
machine guns. The Battalion left the vicinity of the Green
Line and marched to a position south-east of Bayonvillers,
where meals were issued before continuing the march to the


assembly area. The Battalion rested on the north-west edge
of Harbonnieres, and following a meeting of Unit Command-
ers, to whom instructions governing the attack were given
verbally, Lieut.-Col. Chalmers held a meeting of Company
Commanders, and the Battalion order of attack was finalised.
“B” and “A” were the right and left attacking Companies,
with “C” and “D” following in close support.
Shortly before zero hour, 4.30 p.m., the movement of the
troops attracted the attention of a squad of hostile planes,
which swept down and fired their machine guns at the troops,
who immediately sought cover in the old Amiens defence line,
and although no casualties resulted, it became quite evident
that the enemy artillery were warned of the impending attack.
The Infantry was to be preceded by Tanks, without the usual
artillery barrage, the artillery fire being directed against spe-
cially selected targets. This meant that any loose artillery
action bv the enemy batteries would be concentrated upon
our Tanks.
At 4.30 p.m. the attack commenced, and for the first 1,000
yards fairly good progress was made. An enemy 4.2 howitzer
was captured on the north-west side of the Framerville-
Vauvillers main road, and we sustained our first series of
casualties from the enemy 77’s, which were concentrating
with telling effect upon our advancing Tanks. To avert un-
necessary casualties, “A” and “B” Companies’ Commanders
moved as far forward of the Tanks as possible, and swiftly
made for the main objective, from which an intense machine
gun fire was being maintained.
Driving the enemy gunners from the partially sunken
road east of Vauvillers, “B” Company forced the retiring
enemy to the small copse and high ground immediately west
of the Framerville-Lihons main road, and filled a gap caused
by the efforts of the 25'ch Battalion to keep in touch with the
2nd Brigade, which had moved further to the right. “A”
Company on the left, immediately upon reaching the eastern
ridge of Framerville, met with considerable artillery and ma-
chine gun fire, and “C” and “D” Companies were drawn into
the actual front line, where, following some brilliant tactics,
touch with the sth Brigade, which had moved too far to the
left, was maintained. The bulk of the enemy resistance came
from the gully immediately south of Rainecourt, and Lieut.*
Col. Chalmers immediately drew his Headquarters personnel


forward and defended a vital position in the front line, mean-
while keeping his flanks extended until the closing up of the
flank Units allowed of the withdrawal of our support Com-
panies, and incidentally a shortening of the Battalion sector;
“D” Company moving to the left of “A” Company, and “C”
Company to a support position. Although considerably ham-
pered by direct and concentrated artillery fire, those of the
Tanks remaining in action continued to assist the Infantry
wherever possible. In so doing their casualties would cer-
tainly have been greater, but for the splendid work of our
Lewis Gunners and foremost Infantry, who kept the retiring
enemy machine gunners consistently on the run until the
objective was reached.
The operation, although a small one compared with that
of the previous day, was beset with difficulties from its very
inception, and failure might have resulted but for the rapid
action, launched at a most opportune moment, by all four
Companies, which at 5.20 p.m. had captured the objectives
on a front of 3,000 yards instead of the 1,000 originally in-
tended.
In addition to the previously mentioned 4.2 Howitzer,
about 14 machine guns and a vast amount of war material
were captured by the 27th Battalion. The prisoners taken on
the whole Brigade front were three officers and 7g other
ranks, the enemy casualties being estimated at 250. One of
the most notable captures was the many motor lorries and
transport waggons lined up on the main road, rendered tem-
porarily useless by a section of our armoured cars during its
exploitation on the previous day.
Preparations were made to deal with any counter-attacks
by the enemy during the night, the 26th Battalion taking up
a support position east of Vauvillers, the 28th Battalion being
in reserve about 3,000 yards in rear.
At 8 a.m. the following morning, August 10, the Ist Di-
vision, on the right flank of the 7th Brigade, was to carry
out an attack which necessitated a further advance by the
right of the 25th Battalion. This advanoe was carried out
for a distance of 500 yards in the face of a heavy machine
gun fire. Considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping
touch with the Ist Division movement, but a good line was
eventually consolidated, further advance being deemed inad-
visable during daylight.


PLAN OF OPERATIONS COVERING AUGUST 9 T H, 10 T H & 11TH 1918
POSITION OF 4 2 HOWITZER CAPTURED BY , 27TH BATTALION


The 27th Battalion’s casualties for the operation were
nine other ranks killed, five officers and 67 other ranks
wounded.
Shortly after 10 p.m. orders were received that the 7th
Brigade would carry out another attack at dawn the following
morning, in conjunction with the 3rd Brigade, operating on
the right flank, and the sth Brigade on the left. The 26th
and 28th were the right and left attacking Battalions of the
7th Brigade, and were to pass through the front line held
by the 25th and 27th Battalions respectively, which Battalions
would then become the right and left supports. Zero hour
was fixed for 4 a.m., but the 26th and 28th Battalions were
not to advance until 4.15 a.m., owing to the “jumping off”
line of the sth Brigade being 750 yards in rear of that of the
7th Brigade.
The attacking Battalions were in position an hour before
and supported by a very good barrage by two Brigades
of artillery, the attack was successfully carried out. The
bulk of the enemy machine gun and artillery fire was on the
28th Battalion sector, the total casualties of the two Bat-
talions being one officer killed and four wounded, nine other
ranks killed and 94 wounded.
Two officers and 67 other ranks of the enemy were taken
prisoners, and 18 machine guns were captured.
After the new line had been consolidated, the 25th and
27th Battalions were re-organised in depth, Headquarters and
“B” Company of the 27th Battalion being disposed in the
vicinity of the Mill on the western side of the Framerville-
Vauvillers road, and “A,” “C,” and “D” Companies east of
Framerville. The same night the sth and 7th Brigades were
relieved by the 6th Brigade; the 27th Battalion, on being re-
lieved soon after dusk by the 21st Battalion, bivouacked in
the vicinity of the Crucifix, about 1,000 yards north-west of
Harbonnieres. During the relief enemy bombing planes were
very active, and two casualties were sutained while marching
to the reserve area.
Our cookers arrived next morning and hot meals were
supplied. Enemy long-range guns shelled the neighbouring
villages, but fortunately we sustained no casualties.
On August 12 four men were sent to Corps Headquar-
ters, as representatives of the 27th Battalion, on a parade


of Australians who had taken part in the recent operations,
to be inspected by His Majesty the King, who was visiting
the 4th Army Front.
During August 13 and 14, the troops were able to avail
themselves of a good bath.
The news that Lieut. F. E. Degenhardt had died of
wounds on August 11 was received at this time.
The Ist and 3rd Australian Divisions had now been re-
lieved, and the 2nd Division held its front with the 6th Bri-
gade, which had on its right flank the 4th Division, and its
left flank the 17th English Division.
At dawn on August 16, the Australian Corps carried out
a further advance in conjunction with the Canadian Corps, the
6th Brigade advancing the right flank of the 2nd Division
front in conjunction with the advance of the 4th Division.
The 17 th English Division held the line, no advance being
intended on its front. The 7th Brigade, in accordance with
orders, was prepared at fifteen minutes’ notice, but the opera-
tion being successful, its services were not required, and the
boys settled down to await the expected relief of the 2nd
Division.
Consequent upon the relief of the 2nd Division by the
32nd English Division between August 17 and 19, the 7th Bri-
gade was relieved in the reserve area by the 96th Infantry
Brigade. On August 17 the 27th was relieved by the 16th
Lancashire Fusiliers, and embussed at 11 p.m. on the Bayon-
villers-Harbonnieres road, 300 yards east of the first-named
village, for the Bussy area. Debussing on the Amiens-
Vecquemont road, the battalion marched about a kilometre to
the village of Bussy-les-Daours, reaching there at 3.30 a.m. on
August 18.
After a well-earned rest, the troops were kept engaged in
cleaning up and replenishing their equipment from the huge
hospital dump, near the railway line, due south of the village.
It was ideal weather, and many spent a pleasant time
swimming in the L’Hallve River, a tributary flowing close to
the camp, on its way to the Somme River. Congratulatory
messages reached the battalion in connection with the recent


advance, including one from the officer commanding the 2nd
Tank Battalion, thanking the 27th Battalion for the splendid
assistance rendered to its observers and scouts in guiding his
tanks into action. This eulogistic reference to the magnifi-
cent co-operation between the Australian Infantry and the
Tank Corps was most sincere, and conveyed heartfelt thanks
to the infantry, which, having previously experienced the ter-
rible consequences following the failure of the tanks in action,
had most courageously given it, what we were pleased to
term, a “dinkum go,” thus enabling those responsible for the
reconstruction of the Tank Corps to prove the value and capa-
bilities of the tank as a weapon of war if used and supported
in the correct manner.
On August 21 the 27th Battalion was inspected by
Brigadier General Wisdom, who had resumed command of the
7th Brigade after commanding the “Liaison Force,” a force
specially selected by the Corps Commander as a cover division,
but disbanded after being in existence for about a week. The
return of General Wisdom was appreciated by the personnel
of the 7th Brigade, who had been keenly disappointed at his
removal.
Following a series of glowing tributes to the brigade,
which he invariably referred to as “The Saucy Seventh,”
General Wisdom made an appeal to the men to exercise every
ounce of their fighting strength during our next venture to
keep the enemy on the run.
On August 23 a very interesting series of swimming
events were contested in the river, close to the camp, and were
much enjoyed and appreciated by all ranks.

CHAPTER XXIX.
BIACHES.
The 2nd Division relieved the ist Division in the sector
immediately south of the Somme on the night of August
26/27, 1918, the sth and 6th Brigades taking over the front
and support lines respectively, the 7th Brigade moving up
as reserve Brigade on the following day.
During the morning of August 27 Lieut. S. S. Woods,
M.C., with a party of N.C.O.’s, left Bussy as an advanced
party and proceeded via Hamel to the Morcourt area, to take
over from the igth Battalion. Having to cover a distance of
over 14 miles, the party separated and made use of the motor
lorries going in their direction. Passing beyond Hamel to
Cerisy, the nature of the fighting on the left flank of the recent
corps’ advance could be easily followed, proving wonderfully
interesting to those who had participated in the fighting on
the right flank. The party took over from the igth, the bulk
of which battalion moved farther forward. At 7.15 p.m. the
27th Battalion embussed near Vecquemcnt, and debussing on
the Proyart-Morcourt road at n p.m. was guided to the camp
by the advanced party and comfortably bivouacked by mid-
night. The next day the boys had an opportunity of inspect-
ing their new surroundings. The camp was situated on the
high ground, about 2,000 yards north of the Amiens-St.
Quentin road, and about the same distance west of Proyart.
Positioned between the limbs of two tall trees, close to
Battalion Headquarters, was an enemy observation post,
which had been an object of attention to the battalion obser-
vers during the battalion’s tour of duty on the Morlancourt
Spur. About 800 yards forward of the companies’ camp was
the old Amiens defence line, the ultimate objective of the 4th
Division on August 8.
During the evening of August 28, the 27th Battalion re-
lieved the 17th Battalion in the gully south of Froissy Beacon,


and bivouacked on the slopes of the high ground east of the
Chuignolles-Bray road. Crossing the western slopes of the
Chuignes gully we passed many enemy dead and other signs
of the hard fighting experienced by the ist Division during its
capture on August 23.
Owing to the rapidity of the advance, it is essential to
detail the conformation of the corps’ front in order to keep a
ray of light directly centred upon the actual happenings of the
27th Battalion’s sector.
During the past few days the corps front had been con-
siderably shortened; its right flank, extending beyond Lihons,
having been taken over by the 36th French Corps, the re-
disposition of the Australian Corps enabled General Monash
to rest the ist and 4th Divisions. On the night of August
28 the corps’ front was being held by four divisions, which,
reading from right to left, were the 32nd English, and the sth,
2nd, and 3rd Australian Divisions; holding the sectors imme-
diately north and south of the Somme River were the 3rd and
2nd Divisions respectively.
At 2 a.m., August 29, we received instructions that the
2nd Division would advance its line to the Somme River.
This instruction created no surprise, as the reconnaissance
patrols had reported the retirement of the enemy from his out-
post lines. The main object of the advance was to hug the
enemy’s rearguard so closely as to enable the capture and
command of the main bridge crossings of the river. From
Clery-sur-Somme to Peronne the line of the Somme runs gene-
rally south-east, and from Peronne a direct turn due south.
On the 2nd Division front the 7th and sth Brigades were the
right and left attacking brigades. On the right of the 7th
Brigade, the Bth Brigade, following the capture of Assevillers
on the night of the 28th, would continue to advance and con-
form to the advance of the 2nd Division to the river.
The 26th, 28th, and 27th were respectively the right,
centre, and left attacking battalions of the 7th Brigade, with
the 25th Battalion in reserve, the 19th Battalion being on the
left flank of the 27th Battalion. Zero hour was fixed for 7.30
a.m., August 29, at which time the 7th Brigade was to pass
through the general line captured by the 6th Brigade during
the previous night.
Owing to the rapidity and depth of the advance, the 16th
Royal Horse Artillery Brigade covered the advance of the


26th Battalion, and the 298th Royal Field Artillery Brigade
that of the 28th and 27th Battalions, touch being kept with
each brigade by means of liaison officers attached to each of
the advancing battalions.
Included in the 27th Battalion’s objective was the village
of Biaches, and in that of the 28th Battalion the heavy bridge
crossing of the Amiens-Peronne railway, which was known
to be intact prior to the advance. Although our advance dur-
ing August 27 and 28 had set the enemy on the run to the
river, he continued to fight cleverly, aided by the splendid
work of his machine gunners, and completely ignoring the
tempting offers thrown out by our front line unit commander
to put up a standing fight, he kept the line of retirement
general throughout.
The latest identification of enemy organisation revealed
the fact that the 41st Division, one of the very latest drawn in
by the enemy to check the corps’ advance, was holding the
objectives on our immediate Brigade sector, with the 18th,
148th, and 152nd Infantry Regiments, which were expected to
put up a stout opposition from the high ground overlooking
the river and canal.
The distance covered in the approach march and the
attack on Biaches was the greatest ever undertaken by the
27th Battalion in one individual operation, some g,ooo yards
having to be covered prior to passing through the 6th Bri-
gade, and another 5,500 yards to the village.
To facilitate freedom of movement and to husband the
strength of the troops, the machine guns, etc., were sent for-
ward by road via Cappy to a position about 2,000 yards west
of Herbecourt, where they were picked up by the boys who
moved across country south of the Cappy-Herbecourt road,
this being the only halt during the whole advance.
From this assembly position it had been arranged that the
Battalion should move off in its correct order of attack, which
was “A” Company on the right, “C” Company centre, and
“D” Company left, with “B” Company in close support, but
“A” Company, in moving to the assembly position proceeded
too far south, and “B” Company took up its position as right
attacking Company, although “A” Company was in readiness
From the alacrity with which the troops moved into posi-
tion one could hardly credit that they had already covered a


distance of 6,500 yards and had yet another 8,000 yards to
cover and a village to capture before calling a halt.
Moving astride the Cappy-Biaches road we passed
through Herbecourt and the forward posts of the 6th Brigade
wdthout incident, but when about 1,200 yards east of Herbe-
court, met with direct shelling from the enemy batteries across
the river west of Peronne, and from Mont St. Quentin. A
raking machine gun fire was experienced from the Sword and
Canal Woods and the high ground overlooking Biaches, but
upon the rapid approach of the companies the enemy gunners
retired down the slopes to the village, from which they con-
tinued their fire, and partially held up our central company,
whose commander (Capt. Wiltshire) was killed on the high
ground overlooking the village. Capt. Bice, with “B” Com-
pany, rapidly grasping the seriousness of the situation, and
realising the impracticability of a frontal attack, began to
move forward, taking advantage of all available cover with the
intention of flanking the village. Moving cautiously along
the road and slopes of the re-entrant south of Biaches, they
came under the direct fire of the enemy machine guns, which
were effectively holding up the advance of the 28th Battalion.
Consequent upon the success of “B” Company, “C” and “D”
Companies were able to move down into the village and the
enemy on the right of “B” Company, retired to La Maisson-
nette, where they were again successful in checking the ad-
vance of the 28th Battalion, until a rapid flanking movement
by the 26th Battalion on the extreme right resulted in the
retirement of the enemy across the river. This rapid move-
ment by the 26th Battalion resulted in the capture of 15 pri-
soners.
During the action' of “B” Company of the 27th Battalion
Captain Bice was severely wounded, but carried on until the
success of his movement was assured before handing over
command to Lieut. Rollins.
The village of Biaches was captured at g. 30 a.m., and
advanced posts were immediately established along the river
bank, the approaches to which were continually sniped by
enemy gunners secreted in the ruins of Radegonde, “C” Com-
pany’s posts in the vicinity of the Church ruins receiving
particular attention.
Our flank battalions reported all objectives gained, and a
reconnaissance of the brigade front revealed a well-sited posi-


PLAN OF BIACHES OPERATION AUGUST 29 TH 1918


tion, with a commanding view of Peronne and Mont St. Quen-
tion from the high ground north-west of Biaches.
Our casualties during the operation were:—One officer
killed and 2 wounded; 9 other ranks killed and 43 wounded.
The estimated number of enemy killed was 40, 3 prisoners
and 3 machine guns being captured. The small number of
prisoners taken on the whole brigade sector, i.e., 1 officer and
46 other ranks, reflected great credit upon the masterful man-
ner'in which the enemy carried out the rearguard action, the
co-operation between infantry and artillery being almost per-
fect; their destruction of the bridge crossing was in most
instances complete.
Immediately following the capture of Biaches, Battalion
Headquarters was established near Grand Wood, and an ob-
servation post overlooking the whole battalion sector close by.
About 1 p.m. the village was subjected to heavy shelling
from enemy batteries north-east of Peronne.
The general line of the S.omme had yet to be turned im-
mediately north of the river and Biaches, and much specula-
tion was rife among unit commanders as to which division
would carry out the movement, but it soon became apparent
that the 2nd Division was to be so honoured. The plan
definitely decided upon was to deliberately attack the veri-
table fortress of Mont St. Quentin, which, situated about a
mile north of Peronne, formed an admirable key position to
the town and the pocket, created by the bend of the river, to
the west of it.
A more daring and audacious attack has never been at-
tempted in the history of the war, but the “seemingly impos-
sible” often succeeds.
The 2nd Prussian Guards Division had been selected to
hold the promontory at all costs, and if the troops laughed at
the thought of our attempting to cross the river and seek their
acquaintance in such a short space of time, one can readily
forgive them, for standing on the hill overlooking the ground
devoid of cover across which the advance had to be made, the
position appeared well nigh impregnable.
The following day (August 30) the sth Brigade crossed
the river at Feuilliers, and passing through the front of the


3rd Division found the village of Clery-sur-Somme partially
occupied, but after some skilful fighting was able to establish
itself in the trench system in the vicinity of Feuillaucourt.
At 5 a.m., August 31, the sth Brigade launched an attack
upon Mont St. Quentin, the progress of which was reported
to Headquarters from the 27th Battalion observation post.
About 7 a.m. troops of the sth Brigade were observed moving
through the cemetery and ruins of Mont St. Quentin, and
many prisoners could be seen on their way to the rear of our
lines. Throughout the day the splendid efforts of the sth
Brigade carried the line across the hill, but the reserve troops
of the 2nd Prussian Guards were drawn into action, and
launched several counter-attacks. These troops, advancing
in three waves, were literally mown down by the fearfully
accurate fire poured into them by the Lewis gunners.
The flanks of the sth Brigade were dangerously ex-
posed, and the line was withdrawn to a series of trenches on
the western slopes of the hill. The Prussian Guards con-
tinued to counter-attack, and on one occasion succeeded in
establishing them selves upon the slopes under cover of a
smoke screen, but another determined attack by the sth Bri-
gade, in which the bayonet was applied with deadly effect,
drove them back to the summit, leaving many prisoners be-
hind.
The 6th Brigade had by this time commenced to cross
the river to move up in support to the sth Brigade, and shortly
after midday the left flank of the sth Division extended to its
left and released the 7th Brigade, which was due to cross the
river during the afternoon. The 27th Battalion commenced
to move at 2.30 p.m., Battalion Headquarters moving across
the high country and the companies along the lower bank of
the river. The main crossing was effected at Ommiecourt-le-
Clery, under extremely heavy shell fire, which was inflicting
ever-increasing casualties among the Engineers, who worked
unceasingly to effect a passage for the Infantry. Their valu-
able work can only be described as bridge making extra-
ordinary, for at intervals of a minute heavy shells burst in
close proximity, and whenever the bridge was directly hit the
Engineers had to rush forward and repair the damage without
delay. Successfully crossing the river, the 27th Battalion


bivouacked in the trench system, about 500 yards south-east
of Clery-sur-Somme.
Moving along the railway line we passed troops of the
14th Brigade, which had crossed the river to move forward
and take up a line position on the right of the 6th Brigade,
which was taking over from the sth Brigade.
Soon after reaching our position the cookers were brought
up, and within a short time we were enjoying a hot meal, be-
fore settling down to gain as much rest as possible, pending a
further advance of the 7th Brigade.
At dawn on September 1 the 6th Brigade attacked the
summit of Mont St. Quentin, the 14th Brigade co-operating
on the right with a simultaneous attack upon St. Denis and
Peronne. Although the right of the 14th Brigade succeeded
in reaching the western edge of Peronne, very little progress
could be made immediately south of Mont St. Quentin, where
the enemy machine guns and the extensive wire entangle-
ments considerably hampered the advance to St. Denis. The
6th Brigade successfully advanced through the ruins of Mont
St. Quentin and the position reached by the sth Brigade on
the previous day, and established a line near the wood, mean-
while protecting its right flank, which was partially exposed,
owing to the difficulty experienced by the 14th Brigade in
reaching St. Denis. The advance between Peronne and Mont
St. Quentin continued to progress throughout the morning,
and many prisoners passed by the 27th Battalion Headquar-
ters. During the afternoon the enemy began to heavily shell
our position with their 5.9 guns, one of the shells destroying
a team of horses attached to an artillery limber close to the
embankment.
A report then reached us that the nth Brigade’s advance
north of the Canal du Nord was progressing satisfactorily.


CHAPTER XXX.
AIZECOURT-LE HAUT—MONT ST. QUENTIN
RIDGE.
On the morning of September i, 1918, it was intended that
the 7th Brigade should pass through the 6th Brigade and ex-
ploit the capture of Mont St. Quentin and Feuillaucourt, by
advancing on to the Aizecourt-Mont St. Quentin Ridge on
September 3, and during the afternoon a percentage of officers
and specialists of the 27th Battalion attempted a reconnais-
sance of the scene of operations. Unfortunately a close view
of the position was impossible owing to the 6th Brigade not
having advanced a sufficient distance, and the reconnaissance
was postponed until the following morning, when it was ex-
pected that the situation would be cleared up.
In the meantime our higher command had decided that
the advance should take place at dawn the following morning.
This action was undoubtedly a wise one, as the numerous
intelligence reports showed that the enemy was preparing to
retire towards the Hindenburg Line. The advance also would
materially assist the 14th and 15th Brigades in the final cap-
ture of St. Denis and Peronne.
Zero hour for the attack was fixed for 5.30 a.m., Septem-
ber 2. The 14th Brigade was to co-operate with an attack
on the right, and the 229th Brigade (74th English Division)
on the left. The objective of the 7th Brigade was a defensive
flank from the immediate south-eastern edge of Mont St.
Quentin, along Koros Valley to a point on the Aizecourt-St.
Denis road, along the trench system on the north-western side
of the road to Aizecourt-Le Haut.
The brigade was to attack with three battalions, the 26th
Battalion on the right, the 25th Battalion centre, the 27th


Battalion on the left, and the 28th Battalion in close support,
1,000 yards in rear of the advancing battalion. The advance
was supported by six brigades of Horse and Field Artillery,
which were firing upon selected targets, with our heavy artil-
lery co-operating with the barrage, which remained on the
artillery start line for 10 minutes prior to advancing at the rate
of 100 yards every five minutes.
The headquarters of the attacking battalions, moving
close behind the infantry, were to be established immediately
following the capture of the objective.
On the night of September 1/2 the 27th Battalion moved
across the Canal du Nord, and took up its allotted position in
readiness for the attack. The 27th Battalion’s order of at-
tack was as follows:—“C” Company, under the command of
Lieut. W. S. Coombe, on the right; “A” Company, under Mjr.
P. E. Julge, M.C., in the centre; and “D” Company, under
Lieut. R. Arthur, on the left; “B” Company, under Capt. W. S.
Hosking, M.C., in support. The three attacking companies
took up a position along the road in Feuillaucourt, “B” Com-
pany in Oder Trench and Battalion Headquarters in Gottlieb
Trench. All companies were in position shortly before 5.25
a.m.
At zero hour, “C,” “A,” and “D” Companies made a dash
for Tortelle Trench. The numerous enemy S.O.S. signals
were promptly answered by an extremely heavy artillery bar-
rage of high explosives, which, together with the heavy wire
entanglements protecting Pleyna and Tortelle trenches, con-
siderably hampered our advancing troops, with the result that
they were soon outpaced by the artillery barrage. “B” Com-
pany, of the 27th Battalion, whose duty was to incline their
advance to the north-east and capture Haut-Allaines, met with
an intense machine gun fire immediately upon reaching the
high ground south-west of the village. Contrary to expecta-
tions, the village of Allaines, which is separated from Haut-
Allaines only by the River Tortelle, was still occupied by
enemy machine gunners, who began to harass the left flank
of “D” Company, all of whose officers became casualties.
Sticking resolutely to their tasks, the N.C.O.’s continued to
cautiously make their way forward, gallantly supported by
the men, who were using every available means of cover from
the increasing volume of machine gun fire, and after some
brilliant sniping made their way to the eastern edge of Haut-
Allaines.


PLAN OF OPERATIONS SEPTEMBER 2ND 1919
DIRECTION OFF ATTACK SHOWN BY ARROWS


It soon became apparent that the enemy S.O.S. barrage
had fallen very heavily on the “jumping off’’ positions of the
229th English Brigade, and prevented their immediate ad-
vance, for great numbers of the enemy were observed along
the canal bank and the lock north of Haut-Allaines. Thus
our left flank was becoming dangerously exposed. Meanwhile
on our right flank the 25th Battalion was experiencing con-
siderable difficulty in advancing over Hill 115, east of Mont
St. Quentin, from which position the enemy gunners began to
pour an enfilade fire into “A” and “C” Companies of the 27th
Battalion. Capt. W. S. Hosking, M.C., quickly grasping the
seriousness of the situation, brought “B” Company up to sup-
port “A” and “C” Companies. Realising that an effective
machine gun fire was being maintained from Brunn Trench
immediately in front, Capt. Hosking led a frontal attack, and
captured it, also several machine guns and about 60 prisoners.
This advance rendered valuable aid to those men of “D”
Company, who were striving to silence the machine guns
north-east of Haut-Allaines. About 7 a.m. Capt. Hosking,
with Lieut. Rollins and about 28 other ranks, began to ad-
vance from the gully to the higher ground and the Hepa
Alley trench system running on to the Aizecourt Ridge. The
scattered enemy parties north-east of Haut-Allaines, about
600 in all, retreated in front of our party to the higher ground
near Aizecourt village. From that vicinity a battery of 77’s
began to pour shells into our advancing troops, which, how-
ever, continued their advance to the trench system, beyond
which a halt was called by Captain Hosking to enable him to
ascertain his exact position in relation to that of the attacking
flank units. Hastily dispatching runners to the rear Head-
quarters for reinforcements and ammunition, and Lieut. Rol-
lins to the right to get in touch with the 25th Battalion, Cap-
tain Hosking began to make preparations to deal with an im-
mediate counter-attack, as the enemy had ceased to retire, and
were concentrating with that object. To refuge his left flank
and also hoodwink the enemy as to the actual fighting strength
of the party, he sent. Sgt. Eldridge and a machine gun crew
to a prominent position on the left, which afforded a splendid
field of fire, and also observation over the gully and ap-
proaches to Haut-Allaines and the Canal du Nord. Despite
the intense machine gun fire directed against them, they
pluckilv dashed forward and reached the position without
casualties.


By this time Battalion Headquarters had reached the par-
tially sunken road, 400 yards forward of Brunn Trench, and
observers were sent our right and left to effect touch with
the flanks.
Connection with the 25th Battalion was established, and
several parties of the 27th Battalion were sent forward under
the command of Lieut. Rollins, who, failing to get in touch
with the 25th Battalion, had been dispatched by Capt. Hosk-
ing to Battalion Headquarters; a platoon of the 28th Batta-
lion was also sent forward to assist in holding the new posi-
tion. The Sussex Regiment was sent forward to assist the
7th Brigade to refuge its left flank, and two companies
reached the sunken road about 9 a.m., and were dispatched
to the left to fill the gap between the left flank of the 27th
Battalion and the Canal. The Sussex Headquarters and re-
maining two companies arrived later, and took up a position
in Brunn Trench. The 27th Battalion Headquarters was
withdrawn to the same trench, leaving a few men in the
sunken road under Lieuts. Davies and Fergusson to effect
a support line.
A collective reconnaissance of the brigade front revealed
the 27th Battalion holding the apex of a “V” shaped salient,
the defensive flanks of which were facing north-east for a dis-
tance of about 2,000 yards and south-east a distance of 3,000
yards, with every machine gun position thoroughly sited.
The value of our advance was fully revealed during the
afternoon, when the remainder of Peronne and St. Denis were
captured, our advanced position rendering it futile for the
enemy to continue to hold on.
Adequate preparations were made to deal with counter-
attacks during the night. At dusk a party of three men were
observed moving towards our lines carrying a white flag.
Two of them appeared to be officers and the other an N.C.O.
Recognising the white flag, our men made their positions
known, and beckoned to the party to come in, but they imme-
diately turned and fled; our men fired upon them, killing the
N.C.0., but the officers managed to reach their lines. Almost
at once an intense artillery barrage was directed upon our
position, and our men were withdrawn to Hepa Alley trench
system.
During the night the enemy’s artillery fire eased down
considerably, much to the relief of the 229th English Brigade


on our left, for they had sustained numerous casualties
throughout the afternoon. Early the following morning new
enemy posts were observed in advance of the main trench on
the edge of Aizecourt, one of which was considered to be
hampering our connection with the 25th Battalion and in dan-
gerous proximity to our own line. A raiding party was
organised to effect its capture, but our supply of bombs was
insufficient, and the project was abandoned. The next morn-
ing the post was vacated, the enemy having retired to the
main trench.
Time was now available in which to view the disposition
of the brigade front collectively and gain some idea of the
value of our recent success.
Along the high ground extending from Mont St. Quentin
to Aizecourt were numerous machine gun positions, each
having an unbroken field of fire devoid of cover for attacking
troops for about 200 yards. The hundreds of rounds of
freshly expended ammunition gave evidence of the fearful
volume of fire that had been directed against our advancing
troops by machine gunners, in spite of our artillery barrage
which had passed over the positions.
Included in the numerous dumps of bombs, ammunition,
and other trophies captured on the brigade front, were 84
machine guns, exclusive of several that had been captured in-
tact and had been used against the enemy.
In many instances the gun crews were found dead, killed
principally by bullet and bayonet, gruesome but splendid evi-
dence of the initiative, tenacity, and grim determination with
which our boys had approached the veritable death traps.
These facts, together with other identifications as the results
of interrogation of prisoners, revealed that the enemy had held
the position with twice the normal complement of machine
guns, and looking from the newly captured position it was
indeed hard to believe that advancing infantry could escape
annihilation.
Brigadier General Wisdom, himself a tried and brilliant
tactician, was considerably impressed by the skilful rifle fire
and movement exercised by the attacking troops, and con-
sidered the fight to be one of the most brilliant achievements
of the 7th Brigade.
The tact and caution with which Capt. W. S. Hosking
and his handful of men advanced to the farthest position of


the salient without a previous reconnaissance was equalled only
by the splendid manner in which the leaders of the 25th and
26th Battalions refuged the right flank as the advance pro-
gressed, thus rendering valuable assistance to the 14th Bri-
gade in its advance on St. Denis and Peronne. Following
upon a successful crossing of the Somme by the 15th Brigade
on September 2, the town of Peronne was definitely captured
and cleared of the enemy, and the village of St. Denis, with
the sugar refinery and brickworks, from which the enemy had
offered a stout resistance, was finally captured.
The general cessation of enemy artillery fire spoke of a
withdrawal of his guns, and only an intermittent shelling of
our rear areas by long range guns took place during the night.
The morale of the men was splendid considering the hard
fight and trying circumstances experienced during the pre-
vious month. The splendid condition of the troops was no
doubt due to the expeditious manner in which the commis-
sariat followed the advancing army, enabling hot meals and
rations to be supplied regularly. During the morning of
September 4 the renewed activity by the 32nd English Divi-
sion south of Peronne resulted in the enemy’s withdrawal
from Flamicourt, and incidentally the loss of his only re-
maining hold of the line of Somme.
Our lost comrades were reverently buried, and temporary
crosses erected to mark their graves until better ones could
be prepared.
On the night of September 4/5, the Bth Brigade on the
right, and the 231st Infantry Brigade (74th English Division)
on the left, by extending their boundaries laterally to the left
and right respectively, effected the relief of the 2nd Division,
which was due for a well-deserved rest. The 27th Battalion
was relieved by the 10th King’s Shropshire Light Infantry,
and moved back a distance of about seven miles to the vicinity
of Mereaucourt Wood, camping in the high ground about 250
yards west of the Herbecourt-Feuillieres main road, about
1,000 yards south-east of the last-named village. Guides met
the companies and conveyed them to their various positions,
and following a hot meal the boys settled down to a well-
earned sleep. Upon the completion of the relief Lieut.-Col.
Chalmers resumed command of the battalion, and instructions
were received that the brigade would continue its march to
the Cappy area the following day.


CHAPTER XXXI.
A REST BY THE SOMME, NEAR CAPPY.
During the forenoon of September 5, 1918, the burning
dumps and villages to the east told of the commencement of
the enemy’s retreat to the Hindenburg Line, under close pres-
sure by the vanguard of the 4th Army.
Somewhat refreshed by the few hours’ sleep, the battalion
commenced its march to the Cappy area at 2.30 p.m. Moving
west across country to the Somme River, we marched along
the road close to the river, and passed through the village of
Eclusier to a camp situated in the embankment, about 800
yards north-west of the village. It was an ideal spot, and the
boys appeared satisfied with their surroundings and the pros-
pects of a few days’ rest. Here, crosses were prepared, and
as completed were conveyed to the forward area and re-
verently erected over the graves of our fallen comrades.
The river held a great attraction for the men, and helped
to while away the hours of leisure. The scarcity of boats
was quickly overcome, and in a short time several rude but
most ingeniously constructed craft were to be seen plying their
way up and down the river. Fishing expeditions were or-
ganised, and resulted in a change of diet, which was much ap-
preciated by all.
On September 9 a “Henley on the Somme” was held, and
a large crowd thoroughly enjoyed the lengthy programme of
swimming and diving events, open to all units of the 7th
Brigade. For about an hour each afternoon the Battalion
Band gave selections on the towpath of the river, close to
Battalion Headquarters, and far from the madding crowd the
familiar ring of Australian hats designated the position, for
the day, of the Battalion money exchange.
Preparations were made for brigade and divisional sports,
each battalion being represented by a sports officer.
L


Some very interesting programmes were carried out by
the 7th Brigade Concert Party, known as the Blue Diamonds,
and also by the 3rd Divisional Concert Party, in the village of
Susanne, situated about 1,500 yards distant, on the northern
banks of the river.
The 7th Brigade sports were to be held on September
12, but owing to rain during the forenoon the programme
could not commence until 2 p.m., and concluded on the follow-
ing day, during which time the familiar figure of William
Hughes, the Australian Prime Minister, was seen at various
times throughout the camps of the 2nd Division.
September 16 was observed as a holiday by all units of
the division, on account of the divisional sports which were
held on the high ground south of Eclusier. The Divisional
Commander (Mjr.-Gen. C. Rosenthal) and the various briga-
diers attended, and an extensive programme, embracing every
branch of sport and amusement, was carried out.
Betting on the main events was conducted through a pro-
perly organised totalisator, erected on the spot, and despite
the recent visit of the Australian Premier, no undue taxation
was involved in its administration. Following upon the
keenly contested running and jumping events, in which the
27th Battalion was well represented, the horse events were
most interesting, and much fun resulted from the efforts made
to induce our grand old war warrior, “The Donk,” to jump
the hurdles. Altogether a very interesting day was spent,
and the time passed all too quickly.
' On September 19 a route march was carried out to the
vicinity of Faucaucourt, on the main Amiens-St. Quentin road.
A halt was called at Arcy Wood to allow of an inspection by
the troops of the famous 15-inch gun and position captured
by the Ist Australian Brigade during the Battle of Chuignies.
At 9 p.m. the following night a special gas drill and de-
monstration was carried out, in which it was assumed that the
battalion had to reach an assembly position in a gassed area.
The training of specialists was considerably increased, the
Lewis Gun Section being reorganised, and N.C.Os. from each
company were given a course of map reading and topography.
The bulk of the training had been carried out under the
supervision of company commanders, but on September 23 a
tactical scheme was carried out by the battalion in the vicinity


of Dompierre, about two miles south-east of our camp, at the
conclusion of which the battalion assembled near the village
and marched back to the camp, headed by the band. At this
time much interest was evinced in the projected return to
Australia, on special leave, of the first quota of 1914 men, who
were to assemble at Bray prior to their departure.
Glowing reports continued to reach us from the forward
areas, where the Australian Corps, although a trifle weary,
were following hard upon the heels of the retreating enemy.
On September 10, the 3rd and sth Divisions were relieved by
the 4th and Ist Divisions, which had previously enjoyed a
complete rest by the Somme River.
Camped in this comparatively quiet spot, it was hard
to realise that barely a month previously the surrounding
country was being held by the enemy, and almost every day
souvenirs secreted in some secluded spot and forgotten by the
enemy in their hurried retreat, were unearthed.
On September 26 we received instructions that the 2nd
Division would move forward to the Peronne and Mesnil area
on the night of September 27/28, the 7th Brigade to relieve
the nth Brigade in the Peronne area, and so our pleasant
sojourn by the famous Somme River was concluded.


CHAPTER XXXII.
THE BEGINNING OF THE END.
On September 27, 1918, advanced parties were sent for-
ward, and the Battalion Band, together with men about to
proceed on leave, were sent to La Chapellette, near Peronne.
The 27th Battalion left its camp at 6.30 p.m. and marched via
Herbecourt, Biaches, and St. Denis to Courcelles, and took
over the camp occupied by the 43rd Battalion.
It was a long march, and camp was not reached until the
early hours of the following morning, but after a few hours’
rest preparations were made for another move forward. Dur-
ing the afternoon Col. Chalmers held a meeting of battalion
officers, and maps were distributed covering the future move-
ments of the battalion.
At 7 p.m. we marched via Buire-Courcelles and Tincourt
to a hutted camp, situated on the western side of the gully,
about 1,000 yards north of the last-named village. While
marching through Tincourt several hostile planes were very
active, bombing the horse lines in the vicinity of Buire Wood.
Many American reserves were billetted in the vicinity of our
camp, and one of their bands rendered jazz selections, con-
cluding with their international favourite “Over There,” which
was many times encored by the “wags” of the battalion, who
would have kept them going all night had it not been for the
barrage put down upon them by their mates, who preferred a
rest to the latest jazz music. Many wounded passed through
to the rear hospitals, principally members of the 27th Ame-
rican Division which had attacked the previous day in order
to retrieve the unsatisfactory disposition of its front, and "to
enable it to conform, with better advantage, to the projected
attack on the Hindenburg Line, which had been arranged to
take place on September 29. Unfortunately the operation had
met with complete failure; some of the men reached their


allotted objectives, but were taken prisoners, and the enemy
still retained hold of part of the Hindenburg outpost line.
Although General Monash continued to command the
corps’ front, no Australians were actually in the line, but they
were in immediate readiness to co-operate in the second phase
of the attack on the Hindenburg Line.
Thanks to the brilliant fighting by the ist and 4th Aus-
tralian Divisions on September 18, practically the whole of the
famous Hindenburg outpost line had been captured, and the
manner in which the operation was carried out acted as a
stimulant to the troops destined to perform the even more im-
portant task of driving the enemy from the Hindenburg main
line. This was now the enemy’s main defence line, and only
by holding it could he hope to stem the rapid advance of the
Allies throughout the approaching winter months.
The fight for the Hindenburg outpost line by the ist and
4th Divisions proved to be their last fight in the war, for they
were relieved on September 23 by the Americans and the IX.
Corps.
Before passing on to the attack on the Hindenburg Line,
a brief description of the American and Australian Corps
front, commanded by General Monash, and the organisation
of the troops within its boundaries, will enable the reader bet-
ter to follow the work of our particular battalion.
The 2nd American Corps was holding the corps’ front
line with two divisions, the 30th Division on the right and
the 27th Division on the left, the sth and 3rd Australian Divi-
sions were in immediate support to the 30th and 27th Ameri-
can Divisions respectively, with the 2nd Australian Division
as corps’ reserve.
Consequent upon the recent series of successful opera-
tions the Allied command had decided to attack the Hinden-
burg Line, and to ensure every possible chance of success, a
general and hostile movement was to take place on a front of
about 25 miles.
The 4th Army, operating on the extreme right of the Bri-
tish Line, was to strike against the most vital spot with three
corps, on a front extending from Selency to Vendhuille, near
Le Catelet. The ist French Army was to co-operate on the
right flank of the 4th Army, and the 3rd Army on the left
flank. The American and Australian Corps was to operate


in the centre of the 4th Army movement with the IX. and 111.
Corps on the right and left flanks respectively.
The 30th and 27th American Divisions were the right and
left attacking units on the corps’ front, and were to carry out
the first phase of the attack by capturing the “Green Line,”
which ran north and south on the eastern edge of Le Catelet
and Nauroy. The second phase was to be carried out by the
'sth and 3rd Australian Divisions, which were to pass through
the 30th and 27th American Divisions and capture the “Red
Line,” the second objective, which ran east of Beaurevoir and
Wienccurt and the western edge of Ramicourt.
Included in the first phase of the battle was the capture
of the reserve trench system of the Hindenburg Line, and in
the second chase the enemy’s last line of defence, known as
the Masnieres-Beaurevoir line, and farther south as the
Beaurevoir-Fonsomme line.
On the whole of the 4th Army front the Hindenburg Line
presented a seemingly impassable barrier, particularly in the
vicinity of Bellenglise, Bellicourt, Bony, and Vendhuille. Tak-
ing nearly two years to construct, its strength was continually
augmented by every defensive resource as they became known
to the science of military engineering.
Deep dugouts, concrete field and machine-gun emplace-
ments, signal stations, observation posts, and a whole network
of light trench railways were only a few resources that helped
to gull its defenders into thinking it impregnable.
The Cambrai-St. Quentin Canal, immediately in rear of
the main line, offered absolute protection from our shell fire
and aerial bombing to the support and reserve troops, which
naturally had to be maintained, divisions in strength, to effect
a defence of such a gigantic trench system, once the outpost
became lost to them.
From the south of Bellicourt to a point west of Le Catelet
the canal passes through huge cuttings and a subterranean
tunnel, which is ventilated by numerous air shafts.
Comparing this trench system with that which consti-
tuted the enemy’s first line on the Somme, west of Albert,
during the early months of 1916, a close student of trench
defence could hardly credit a military genius like Hindenburg
with the projection of such ridiculously intricate trench works


in view of the comparative ease with which the first line of
the Somme was overcome. From the early phases of the
conflict the German method of trench construction had led the
way, evoking in many instances the unstinted praise of their
enemies; but first and foremost in every evolutionary stage
seemed the one great idea of escaping, wherever possible, from
the very sound of shell fire by crawling far into the bowels
of the earth. Strange to say, this proved a dangerous canker
that gradually undermined the morale of their troops and
overshadowed most of their defensive enterprises.
On the other hand, the advancement by the Allies in en-
trenchment was the result of direct experience and force of
circumstance, governed by the factor of keeping their troops
familiar with, as well as comparatively safe from, enemy shell
fire.
A preliminary bombardment of the Hindenburg Line was
commenced on the night of September 26, more to demoralise
the enemy front line troops than in the hope of demolishing
the huge belts of wire entanglements.
The 27th Battalion was astir very early on the morning
of September 29, and at 6 a.m. the tremendous rumble of
artillery fire told of the opening of the great attack. From
midday the battalion came under orders to move forward at
two hours’ notice. Our Battalion Headquarters was kept
well informed from the report centres, and the early informa-
tion revealed unprecedented successes in practically the whole
army front. Excitement ran high among the American Re-
serve troops, but the many doubts that naturally followed the
decision cf the Higher Command to carry the initial phase of
an attack upon such an intricate defensive zone with inex-
perienced troops were about to be rendered groundless.
At g a.m. Bellenglise, Bellicourt, and Bony were reported
to be in the Allies’ hands, and we all expected an early move-
ment to follow in wake of the Australian Division in the
second phase of the attack.
Then came news from our line divisions that the Ameri-
cans were held up in front of them. It appeared that the
27th American Division, upon reaching the sunken portion of
the canal, had passed over in many places without “mopping
up,” with the result that the enemy gunners, secreted in the
tunnel until the vanguard of the attack had passed over, had
reappeared, and brought a withering fire to bear upon their


rear, and in places upon the advancing Australian divisions,
which were then faced with the task of capturing the first
instead of the second objective.
Fortunately the IX. Corps on the right had met with
amazing success, which caused the enemy’s reserve troops to
remain at bay instead of launching an immediate counter-
attack.
Many Americans were reported to have penetrated to Le
Catelet and Gouy, where they were surrounded and taken
prisoners. During the following day (September 30) the sth
and 3rd Australian Divisions fought hard to retrieve the situa-
tion. Owing to the isolated positions of some of the Ameri-
cans, no artillery could be used, but they were relieved by
sheer bayonet fighting and bombing. It soon became evident
that the 2nd Australian Division would relieve the line troops
and continue the advance from the line reached on October 1.
At 10.30 a.m. the 27th Battalion left the camp near Tin-
court and marched via Hamel, Marquaix, and Roisel to the
Templeux le Guerard area, and bivouacked about 300 yards
south of the railway line, about 1,000 yards south-west of
Hargicourt.
North from the high ground beyond Roisel, Villers Falcon
and the heavy railway were being heavily shelled by enemy .
long-range guns.
On the right of the road, at the foot of the gully near
Haut Wood, we passed a Tank Section, the personnel of which
were hurriedly effecting repairs.
Keeping to the main road we passed through Templeux
le Guerard, and continued on along the main road to Hargi-
court, halting near the quarry on the south side of the road,
about 1,000 yards west of the last-named village, eventually
moving to the position before mentioned, south of the railway
line.
At 8.30 p.m. the same night the 7th Brigade moved for-
ward as left support brigade of the 2nd Division, which was
now the only Australian Division in the line. Only the Mas-
nieres-Beaurevoir line of trenches now barred the way to a
second demonstration of open warfare, the nature of which
was generally expected to be comparatively easy, for a close
study of the prisoners captured during the previous month’s
fighting revealed their morale to be very low.


In that great fight at Mont St. Quentin the enemy lost
the key to Peronne and the almost invaluable line of the
Somme, and in as many days as it had taken them years to
construct, they lost the most gigantic of all modern trench
works, which incidentally shattered the nucleus of their
organisation. During the afternoon of October 2, the various
Unit Commanders attended a meeting at the 7th Brigade
Headquarters, and great was their pride and satisfaction when
they were verbally informed that the capture of the enemy’s
last line, on our particular front, was to be carried out by
the 2nd Division.
At 8.30 p.m., Brigade orders, covering the intended ope-
ration, were received. This battle proved to be the last in
which the 27th Battalion participated under the jurisdiction
of its own Brigade, and incidentally its Commanding Officer,
Lieut.-Col. F. R. Chalmers. The battle is well known to those
who participated as the battle of Grandcourt, but Beaurevoir
is the official name.
The 2nd Australian Division was to carry out the attack
on the morning of October 3, zero hour being 6.5 a.m. The
sth and 7th were the right and left attacking Brigades re-
spectively.
The 32nd and 50th English Divisions, constituting the
right and left flanks of the 2nd Division, were to attack at
the same time, the 6th Inniskilling Regiment (151st Brigade)
being on the immediate left of the 7th Brigade, and inciden-
tally the 27th Battalion.
Although attacking on a two battalion front, all four bat-
talions of the 7th Brigade were directly engaged in the battle.
The 25th and 27th were the right and left Battalions car-
rying out the initial assault, being supported by the 26th and
28th Battalions. Included in the role of the 27th Battalion
was the formation of a defensive flank from Grandcourt to
the vicinity of Lormisset Farm.
Upon the completion of the first phase of the battle, the
26th Battalion was to pass through the 25th Battalion and
capture part of the Masnieres-Beaurevoir trench system, and
the 28th Battalion, passing through the 27th Battalion, was
to take over and consolidate the trench, thus forming a de-
fensive flank to the 26th Battalion, which was to consolidate
a line extending from the northern edge of Beaurevoir, in a
north-westerly direction, to Guisancourt Farm.


The attack was supported by Field and Heavy Artillery,
the barrage remaining on the start line until zero plus five
minutes, following which a creeping barrage was maintained
until the Lormisset to Beaurevoir road was reached; the bar-
rage was then concentrated on all suspected strong points,
machine gun posts, etc.
The 7th Brigade was to be supported in the attack by
eight tanks of the Bth Tank Battalion; five tanks to support
the attack of the 25th Battalion, and three that of the 27th
Battalion.
During the afternoon and evening of October 2, the 27th
Battalion was re-organised into three companies, “A” Com-
pany being dissolved in order to strengthen the remaining
companies, “C” and “B” were then selected as right and left
attacking companies, under the command of Lieut. C. E. Pel-
lew and Capt. Beddome respectively; “D” Company, under
Capt. W. S. Hosking, M.C., being in support.
The companies arrived at the “jumping off” position about
5.15 a.m., October 3, without casualties. At zero hour a light
mist prevailed, and dawn was just breaking when our barrage
was put down in front of the boys, who attacked six minutes
later when the barrage commenced to move forward. Despite
the unusual direction of advance, “C” and “B” Companies
moved swiftly towards their objective, capturing three ma-
chine guns and 150 of the enemy, belonging principally to the
187th, 46th, and the 58th Infantry Regiments. Several pri-
soners of the nth Company of Pioneers were quickly requi-
sitioned by our intelligence staff for the purpose of searching
dug-outs and all likely traps set by the enemy. The enemy’s
S.O.S. signals, which took the form of red flares, were prompt-
ly answered; his barrage, fortunately comparatively light,
falling in the vicinity of our “jumping off” line.
At the commencement of the attack, Lieut.-Col. Chalmers,
D. 5.0., with Battalion Headquarters moving in two parties,
advanced and took up a forward Headquarters position on the
high ground immediately in rear of the “jumping off” line,
from which site the progress of the attack could be followed.
Very little resistance was encountered until the almost
dry Torrens Canal was reached, where a large number of
prisoners were taken.


PLAN OF OPERATIONS, OCTOBER 3RD 1918.
DIRECTION OF ATTACK SHOWN BY ARROWS


The 27th Battalion was to form a defensive flank on the
left of the 7th Brigade movement, and “D” Company moved
up from the support position in the Torrens Canal, to streng-
then the line companies. Following some extremely hard
fighting, the English Brigade on the left succeeded in reaching
their objective, consequently our flank was no longer endan-
gered, and two companies were immediately moved to the
right flank. Here a counter-attack was imminent, owing to
the sth Brigade being partially held up on the high ground
near Beaurevoir windmill, where their attack finally spent
itself, and where a fairly good line was afterwards consoli-
dated. The counter-attack, however, did not materialise.
Except for an intense machine gun fire from isolated posi-
tions and the series of trenches constituting our objectives,
the enemy offered very little resistance. The prisoners cap-
tured were of a physically good type, but their morale was
poor, the majority openly expressing satisfaction at being
captured, some appearing dazed and stupefied for hours after
their capture.
Immediately following the capture of our objective, the
26th and 28th Battalions, with several tanks, moved forward
to the ultimate objective.
About 5 p.m., an enemy plane, flying very low above the
gully immediately in rear of advanced Battalion Headquarters,
dropped a number of ordinary trench bombs, commonly
known as “potato mashers,” but no damage was done. Three
hours later enemy planes commenced to heavily bomb the rear
areas between Nauroy and Bellicourt, the casualties being
surprisingly few considering the number of bombs dropped
throughout the night.
Shortly after 6 p.m., instructions were received that the
7th Brigade would be relieved that night by the 7th British
Infantry Brigade; the 27th Battalion upon being relieved was
to move back to the same trench system that it occupied prior
to the battle. About midnight the gth Devonshire Regiment,
under the command of Col. Storey, commenced to take over
the brigade front. The 27th Battalion was completely re-
lieved, without further casualties, at 4.30 a.m., October 4.
Soon after daybreak a hot breakfast was issued from the
cookers positioned in the gully known as Riqueval Ravine,
east of Bellicourt. The position was a far from enviable one,
for the cooks reported several narrow escapes from the enemy
bombing planes in search of our heavy battery positions


nearby. During the morning a continuous stream of guns
and material moved to more advanced positions, and the ex-
tensive movement of American troops, west of Bellicourt, sug-
gested the relief, within a few days, of the 2nd Division.
Then came instructions that the 2nd Division would ex-
ploit its successes of the previous day by an attack upon
Montbrehain. It was essential that the enemy should be kept
on the run, for every success gained on the left of the 4th
Army front would materially assist the 3rd Army further
north, in its envelopment of Cambrai.
The 27th Battalion was placed at the disposal of the 6th
Brigade to assist in the operation if necessary, the Brigade’s
strength being further augmented by the 18th Battalion and
the 2nd Pioneer Battalion, which prior to the attack relieved
the 139th British Infantry Brigade on the right of the 6th
Brigade front. Simultaneously with the attack by the 6th
Brigade, the left flank of the British Corps on the right was
to push out strong fighting patrols, under an artillery bar-
rage, to occupy Mannequin Hill, a dominating feature, im-
mediately south of Montbrehain. From here the majority of
the latter village could be swept by machine gun fire. .On
the left of the 6th Brigade’s movement, the 25th English
Division was to carry an attack beyond Beaurevoir and
Ponchax.
During the night of October 4/5, the 27th Battalion left
its position near Nauroy and moved across the main Estrees
road and took over the 24th Battalion Headquarters, in the
Beaurevoir-Fonsomme line of trenches close to the north-east
edge of Estrees. The companies, moving further forward, re-
lieved the 24th Battalion front line companies near the Quarry
in Le Motte Valley, about 250 yards south-east of the Estrees-
Bavai main road. Our communication with the 6th Brigade
and its attacking Units’ Headquarters was soon established,
and we waited patiently in the cold morning mist for what
eventually proved to be our last operation in the great War.
As a result of our recent attacks having taken place at
dawn, the enemy, fearful of another attack, shelled our
trenches a short while before and after dawn, and on this oc-
casion a few shells were placed very close to our position.
A series of messages reported everything in readiness for
the attack, which opened at 6.5 a.m., October 5, with a fairly
well-directed artillery barrage. At 6.20 a.m., the 6th Brigade


AREA OF LAST OPERATION BY 6 T H BRIGADE & 2ND DIY.


reported everything going well, but unfortunately the move-
ment of the English patrols on the right failed, with the result
that the enemy was able to bring a withering enfilade fire
upon the 2nd Pioneer Battalion. This battalion, however,
held the flank splendidly throughout the day in the face of an
intense artillery and machine gun fire, and without doubt
saved the remainder of the 6th Brigade from attack from the
south.
The 6th Brigade got held up on the northern edge of
Montbrehain, and Lieut. W. Read, M.M., with “D” Company
of the 27th Battalion, was ordered forward to assist in clearing
up the situation. Reaching the western edge of the village,
Lieut. Read halted his men, and with Lieut. Clough, an In-
telligence Officer from the 6th Brigade, and Cpl. Burgess,
from “D” Company of the 27th Battalion, made his way cau-
tiously through the uncaptured portion of the village to as-
certain the exact position of the enemy. Following some
clever and very dangerous work, they succeeded in establish-
ing and garrisoning with troops of the 6th Brigade a sub-
stantial line of posts beyond the village. For this and other
valuable work during the day, Lieut. Read was highly recom-
mended and received the Military Cross, and Cpl. Burgess
was awarded the Military Medal.
The 25th English Division on the left failed in its first
attempt, but during the evening re-attacked and quickly
reached its ultimate objectives.
During the afternoon the action of the artillery supporting
the 6th Brigade’s attack was splendid. For some time quite
an artillery duel took place between the enemy and our bat-
teries, especially in the vicinity of Joncourt, where our guns
kept firing until the enemy batteries were almost completely
silenced.
While supporting the 6th Brigade we were afforded an
opportunity of studying the southern portion of the enemy’s
last completed defence line. Although a double trench system,
well sited and protected by a double series of wire entangle-
ments, it did not compare with the main Hindenburg or its
outpost line. Between the series of deep dug-outs, concrete
machine gun posts the depth of the trench, which was an
average of 8 feet, were built in the parapet, the interior of the
structure affording shell-proof living quarters for the gun
team. Iron platforms were let into the face of the concrete


from which the machine guns were manipulated. During the
operation of October 3, one of our whippet tankf proceeding
along the Estrees road, had turned aside into the trench and
practically smothered one of these posts, the condition of
which was evidence that the tank must have been travelling
at top speed. Unfortunately, the tank failed to extricate itself
from the deep trench, and with its flag flying at an angle
which conveyed to the Infantry that it was out of action, it
was abandoned by its crew.
During the evening of October 5, a successful attack was
made by the English troops upon Beaurevoir, following which
the cessation of enemy shelling spoke of a hurried withdrawal
of his artillery, and many troops were observed moving to
the rear.
When the advanced parties of the American Infantry ar-
rived to reconnoitre the area, they were humorously advised
to put on their running shoes, for the enemy was again re-
tiring.
That night, October 5/6, the 2nd Division, less the artil-
lery, was relieved by the 30th American Division, the 6th
Brigade, together with attached Units of the 2nd Division,
being relieved by the 118th American Infantry Regiment and
the 114th American Machine Gun Battalion.
This relief marked the close of the 27th Battalion’s fight-
ing days, and incidentally that of the 2nd Division, which,
throughout its long service of fighting and garrisoning the
front line sectors in France and Belgium, had become well
known to the German Intelligence Staff as a first-class assault
division, its personnel often being referred to by enemy units
as the “Diamond Devils.” Contented with our suc-
cesses, very few in the Battalion suspected the recent opera-
tion to be the last we should see of the fighting, although the
feeling was general that the end of the great conflict could
not be far distant.


CHAPTER XXXIII.
THE SILVER LINING.
The 27th Battalion, upon being relieved, moved back by
way of Estrees, Nauroy, Bellicourt, and the Black Road, to
the position near Hargicourt occupied on September 1, the
transport and Q.M. stores having arrived from their camp
south-west of Bellicourt. After the long and trying march,
we were gratified to find trench shelters and tents already
erected, and soon sank down for a few hours’ sleep.
During the morning of October 6, the enemy shelled Har-
gicourt and the heavy railway in the vicinity of our camp
with a long range gun, and the 27th Battalion sustained its
last casualty of the War, directly from enemy enterprise, No.
6229, Pte. Sorrenson, of “C” Company, being seriously
wounded, as the result of which he died the following day.
Many American troops passed through the area on the
way to the line, and banter was good-naturedly passed be-
tween them and our boys who were scattered abroad explor-
ing the whole area.
At 1 a.m. on October 7, instructions were received that
the 2nd Division would move the same day, by train and
march route, to the Yzeux Area, north-west of Amiens, Di-
visional Headquarters to move to Belloy, the sth Brigade to
Vignacourt, the 7th Brigade to St. Owen, and the 6th Brigade
to Yzeux. We were astir very early, and after breakfasting
and clearing camp, left at 8.45 a.m. for the entraining station,
Roisel, using principally the dry weather tracks on the north-
ern side of the Roisel road.
While waiting to entrain the troops lighted small fires
among the ruins of the station buildings, around which they
gathered and discussed their experiences during the recent ope-
rations. Suddenly a loud explosion was heard, and the members.
M


of one little group were thrown in all directions. It trans-
pired that one of them had, presumably without knowing the
nature of its contents, thrown a packet of high explosive upon
the fire. Fortunately only two men were injured, Ptes. Bright
and Condon being removed to the Casualty Clearing Station.
Although due to entrain at 10.10 a.m., we did not leave
until 3.30 p.m., and after a weary journey reached St. Roch,
near Amiens, at 11.15 p.m. Immediately after detraining
guides from our advanced billeting party met us, and we com-
menced a long march of about 15 miles, via Longpre, St. Vast
en Chaussee, and Vignacourt, to our allotted area at Ber-
teaucourt.
The dawn of October 8 broke as we silently wended our
way through Vignacourt, and halting on the side of the road
beyond the village for a last rest prior to reaching Berteau-
court, we discussed the possibilities of the advance that was
to be made that morning by the American troops by whom
we had been recently relieved, many of the boys lamenting
that we were not to follow the enemy into the open country
and the practically intact villages. Reaching Berteaucourt,
the Companies, with the help of guides, were settled in their
respective quarters just in time to escape a heavy rain storm.
During the afternoon our transport section arrived, having
made the journey by road-
Berteaucourt-les-Dames is another of those quaint and
sleepy little French villages, wherein the inhabitants of the
present epoch will sit at eventide, throughout the future years,
.and strive again to picture the light-hearted, buoyant-spirited,
.and slouch-hatted men that used to roam its streets. Situated
<on the southern banks of the small Nievre River, which enters
the Somme at I‘Etoile, west of Flexicourt, it first became
known to the earlier personnel of the Battalion during their
Divisional rest at Fieffes and Montrelet, following the
strenuous days at Pozieres in August, 1916; our later asso-
ciations being brought about by those who, in turn, were left
out of the line to form a nucleus garrison during the Somme
fighting early in 1918. This garrison was always humorously
referred to as the “Dud Camp.”
On October 10, training, both military and sporting, was
commenced. The promise of another interesting sports pro-


gramme, made possible by a further gift of £SO from the
League of Loyal Women of Australia, put the troops in good
spirits, and evoked hearty thanks to those workers at home
who did so much to brighten and improve the conditions of
the men.
Satisfaction was felt throughout the Battalion at the news
that Sgt. R. H. Grant, who was unfortunately killed in action
on October 3, after having been strongly recommended for
the Victoria Cross for gallantry during the advance of August
8, had been awarded the D.C.M.
Leave was granted to Abbeville, but lorries were not
available for the conveyance of troops for several days, fol-
lowing which a majority of the boys took advantage of the
trip.
On October 16, the Battalion football team again tried
conclusions with their old opponents, the 28th Battalion, and
won a most exciting game by nine points.
On October 19, 26, and 30, our football team met and
easily defeated teams representing respectively the 2nd Divi-
sional Pioneers, 2nd Machine Gun Company, and the 7th
Brigade Headquarters. On October 30, our soccer team, play-
ing against the 2nd Divisional Pioneers, was defeated by the
only three goals scored.
Moving pictures were screened nightly in the village hall,
which had been conventionally named “The Blue Diamond
Hall’’ after the 7th Brigade Concert Party, which occasionally
gave concerts there, and at times very interesting lectures
on military subjects were given by specialists from Corps and
Army Headquarters.
During the latter days of October, our training became
more interesting, a rifle range being established south of
Pernois, and special courses being given in signalling, map
reading and topography, by specialists of the Battalion.
On November 2, a most impressive Requiem Mass was
held in the Amiens Cathedral in honour of those killed on
the battlefield of the Somme. A guard of honour, band, and
buglers were supplied by Australian Units billetted in the
area. In a congratulatory message thanking all the Austra-


lians concerned, the Bishop of Amiens said that nothing could
have been finer than the guard of honour, or more impressive
than the rendering by the band of Chopin’s “Funeral March,”
and the sounding of the “Last Post” by the buglers.
The same day the Battalion carried out a very interesting
sports programme. Weather conditions were becoming much
colder, and on November 4, a route march to Vignacourt and
Halloy-les-Pernois was carried out.
During our rest at Berteaucourt, the movements of the
Allied Armies were continually reported to Battalion Head-
quarters, and a huge map showing the general disposition of
the Allied front lines was kept up-to-date by Sgt. Skinner,
and positioned outside Battalion Headquarters.
On November 7 we received instructions that the Aus-
tralian Corps was to move up to the forward area, and this
news met with the approval of the boys, who were restless
and tired of inactivity. The enemy was then rapidly retreat-
ing before the Allied Forces, and on the front from which
we were recently relieved, the line had been advanced beyond
the general line of Guise and Landrecies. At the urgent re-
quest of its Army Commanders, Germany was seeking an
Armistice, the terms of which, however distasteful, would
have to be signed within a short time, if their retreat was
to escape utter rout and general disorder.
On the morning of November 11, we carried out a route
march to Vignacourt, Bethencourt, and St. Owen, and en
route through St. Ledger, the ringing of the church bells and
tremendous enthusiasm displayed by the civilians conveyed
to us the news that the Armistice had been signed, and that
the great World War had practically ended. With the Bat-
talion Band playing “The Marseillaise,” we marched into
Berteaucourt, heartily cheered by the civilians.
The great news was received by the boys with mingled
feelings. From the early days of 1916, when they helped to
take up the great fight in real earnest from that solid line
effected by their brilliant “Contemptible Army,” one and all,
throughout the days of success and adversity, had sworn to
celebrate the final victory, if such were theirs, in the wildest
of fashions. Now the actual moment had arrived there was


a solemnity, born of grim memories. In war-stricken cities
thousands of civilians were carried away almost to the verge
of insanity ~y the joyous news, while others were mercifully
able to dull the pain and grief of their loss. “Over there”
were thousands of men and boys who counted the cost. They
could not easily forget those particular chums w'th whom they
had fought side by side, and whose blood lined that long and
hazardous trail that finally led to victory. Their thoughts on
that eventful day were those expressed by Arthur Noyes in
“The Victorious Dead”:—
Peace? I recall an acre of the dead
Marked with the only sign on earth that saves;
The wings of death were hurrying overhead,
The loose earth shook on those unquiet graves.
For the deep gun pits, with quick stabs of flame,
Made their own thunders of the sun-lit air;
Yet, as I read the crosses, name by name,
Rank after rank, it seemed that peace was there.
Sunlight and peace—a peace too deep for thought,
The peace of tides that underlie our strife,
The peace with which the moving heavens are fraught,
The peace that is our everlasting life.
The loose earth shook. The very hills were stirred.
The silence of the dead was all I heard.


CHAPTER XXXIV.
FAREWELL TO THE SOMME.
THE ADVANCE TO THE RHINE.
During the next few days the excitement following the
signing of the Armistice gradually passed away and the boys
became eager to know as much as was possible of our future
movements.
Corps Headquarters and the ist and 4th Divisions had
already commenced to concentrate in the Le-Cateau Area
when the glad news was received. November 16 we received
instructions that the advance to the Rhine of the Allied Forces
would commence November 17. The British Forces detailed
for the advance were organised into two Armies, the 2nd and
4th, each consisting of four Corps and sixteen Divisions.
The 4th Army was to consist of the 2nd Cavalry Division,
the 4th, 6th, gth, and the Australian Corps, each of four Di-
visions, the 3rd Division constituting the reserve Division of
the Australian Corps.
The approximate line reached at the signing of the Armis-
tice, and from which the 4th Army would commence its ad-
vance to the Belgian-German frontier, was the general line,
reading from south to north, a point on the French-Belgian
frontier east of Eppe-Sauvage to Grandrieu, Cousolre, and
Solre to Givry.
The advance was to be carried out in three stages, the
first stage from the above line to the general line of Franchi-
mont, Mettet, Chatelet, and Jumet, to be commenced Novem-
ber 17 and concluded the following day.
The second stage, from the line reached on November 18
to the general line of Deyfeldt, Salmcheteau, Regne, Villers-
St. Gertrude, and Ocquier, to commence November 21 and
conclude November 24.


The third stage, from the line reached on November 24
to the Belgian-German frontier, from the vicinity of Deyfeldt
in the south to Francheville in the north, to commence on
November 27 and conclude on December 2; the frontier was
not to be crossed until the receipt of further orders.
The advance of the 4th Army, the leading Corps of which
were the 9th on the right and the 6th on the left, was covered
by the 2nd Cavalry Division, each of the leading Corps to
move on a two Division front, each Division on a separate
road. The 4th Division on the right and the Ist Division on
the left were the two leading Divisions of the Australian
Corps .which was to concentrate in the Le-Cateau Area prior
to advance.
The enemy were to be clear of the three above-mentioned
zones on the date preceding our advance into each, and any
enemy troops encountered on the march were to be made
prisoners. All precautions against surprise were to be taken
during the advance.
Each Battalion was to be accompanied by its band, and
colours carried where available. Included in the instructions
governing the march was an order to Unit Commanders that
the comfort of the troops was to be the first consideration, an
order which was jocularly quoted by the men on every occa-
sion during the long march.
On November 20 we received instructions that the 2nd
Division (less artillery) would move to the Fresnoy Area, the
sth and 6th Brigades to entrain at Vignacourt on November
21 and 22 respectively, and the 7th Brigade at Hangest-sur-
Somme on November 23, the detraining station being Busigny,
about six miles south-west of Le-Cateau.
. On the morning of November 21, the 27th Battalion car-
ried out a route march, in drill order, and en route through
Vignacourt passed several Units of the sth Brigade, preparing
to move off to the railway station, in full marching order and
carrying blankets. Many remarks, complimentary and other-
wise, were made by these troops, under the impression that
we were marching to entrain, and had been granted the all
too rare privilege of travelling light, whereas they were fully
laden.
At 6 a.m. on November 23, a very cold and frosty morn-
ing, a loading party of “A” and “C” Companies, under the


command of Capt. Burton, left Berteaucourt for Hangest-sur-
Somme. The remainder of the Battalion left at 7 p.m., and
marching via St. Owen, Bethencourt, and Flexicourt, arrived
at Hangest-sur-Somme at 11.30 p.m., where hot cocoa was
issued prior to entraining. The loading of the train which
was to convey the 27th Battalion was completed about 2.30
a.m. Leaving Hangest-sur-Somme at 3 a.m., November 24,
we proceeded oy way of the main Cambrai line to Bertry, from
which station we marched to Busigny owing to an accident
on the line between the villages.
Very little could be seen from the train for some consider-
able time after daybreak, owing to the mist. We passed
Happlincourt and Brie about 8.30 a.m. moving very slowly,
and Peronne, Tincourt, and Roisel about two hours later. Be-
yond Epehy, which was reached at 11.50 a.m., we passed
through what had been the right sector of the 3rd Army front
during the recent Allied advance. Gouzeaucourt had suffered
heavily from shell fire during the great offensive by the enemy
in March, igiß.
Passing Villers-Plouich we crossed the front line of the
3rd Army prior to the enemy’s great attack, and everywhere
evidence still remained of the great struggle during the first
stages of the fighting, especially in the gully South-East of
Ribecourt, where many machine-gun posts had been practi-
cally shattered by the tremendous artillery action which pre-
ceded the attack.
The heavy railway bridge crossing the Crambrai-St.
Quentin Canal, which in this region is called the Canal de
L’Escaut, had been completely demolished, and the huge woo-
den structure which served in its stead was a credit to the
engineers.
From the railway bridge practically the whole of Mar-
going was visible, and it appeared to have suffered less artil-
lery fire than had Gouzeaucourt. We then passed on to the
south-eastern edge of Cambrai, which town was visible some
time before we reached its outskirts. Stopping for a while
south of the Le Cateau Road, between Cambrai and Awoingt,
we continued our journey to Caudry, where we stopped for
several hours, and finally reached Bertry about midnight.
After detraining and receiving a hot drink of cocoa we


marched via Maretz to Busigny, which was reached at 3.30
a.m., November 25, and were billeted in the vicinity of the
village. At 10 a.m. instructions were received to resume our
move forward on foot the following day, our destination being
Mazinghein, South-East of Le Gateau. The civilian popula-
tion of Busigny and neighbouring villages, although happy at
being liberated, were becoming alarmed at the scarcity of
food, but their needs were attended to by our Commissariat
column. Many gave thrilling details of their experiences
during the German occupation and their initial advance in
1914. A large number of youths had been taken from Busigny
to Peronne and made to dig trenches in rear of the advancing
German Army. They also spoke of the telling effect of our
aerial bombing of Busigny Railway Station during the pre-
vious October.
The following morning we marched by way of La-Haie-
Menneresse, St. Souplet, and L’Arbre-de-Guise to Mazinghein,
reaching our destination about 11 a.m. The roads, although
muddy, were in fairly good condition considering the large
amount of traffic over them.
Most of the defence positions, hastily dug by the retreat-
ing enemy rearguard, were found near the main routes,
machine-gun and light field artillery positions being a few
hundred yards distant from the roads, upon which the bulk
of cur shell fire had been directed.
In the village square at St. Souplet, south of Le Gateau,
quite a large number of enemy guns of all calibres were
grouped together, presumably captured during the victorious
advance of the 3rd Army. Between L’Arbre-de-Guise and
Mazinghein we passed several parties of tired, but apparently
happy, refugees, returning to their homes.
Upon reaching Mazinghein, which is situated upon fairly
high ground, we billeted in houses lining the main street.
These houses had suffered to a certain extent from shell fire,
as also had the church, which had received direct hits in
several places. During the afternoon the loading party, left
behind at Hangest-sur-Somme, rejoined the Battalion.
Later in the evening we received orders to continue our
march the following day, our destination being the Fayt-Car-
tignies area. It rained very heavily during the night, making
the roads wretched for traffic.


At 9 a.m. the following day we marched via Catillon, the
southern and eastern edge of Du-Toaillon Wood, and Favril
to Le Grand Fayt, arriving there at 3 p.m. Catillon is a clean
and compact village, situated near the main road.
The main bridge crossing the Sambre Canal, although
considerably damaged, was still fit for traffic. We halted
close to Favril for dinner, resuming our march at 1 p.m. The
road from Favril to Le Grand Fayt was in very bad condition,
and the junction of the La Basse Maroilles-Priches and the
Landrecies-Le Grand Fayt main roads had been blown up to
impede the advance of our artillery.
Upon reaching Le Grand Fayt the Battalion was billeted
in South-East portion of the village, Brigade and the various
Battalion Headquarters being situated near the centre of the
village.


CHAPTER XXXV.
LE-GRAND-FAYT—MONT-SUR-MARCHIENNE AND
CHARLEROI.
Le-Grand-Fayt was a small but old village, and its church,
intact except for a few holes in the roof, apparently due to
shrapnel, bore the dates 1680 and 1723. Some owls had taken
shelter in the roof of the church, and their calls at night
echoed very strangely, to the alarm of the guard in the rail-
way station nearby, from whom tales, exaggerated with each
telling, spread, and earned for the church the reputation of
being haunted.
Ticking noises, such as might emanate from a clock mine,
were alleged to have been heard, and a certain amount of
uneasiness was caused when, on a new guard taking over, the
old guard passed on this information, and expressed the hope
that the mine would not explode before the new guard’s tour
of duty was over.
It soon transpired that we were to rest in this area for
several days before undertaking a series of marches across the
Belgian frontier to Charleroi, and the inhabitants of Le-Grand-
Fayt tried in every way to make the troops comfortable. On
the Le-Petit-Fayt Road was a fairly large cemetery, contain-
ing graves of French, English, and German soldiers killed on
various dates from 1914 to igiß. Many of the villagers told
stories of bitter treatment by the Germans during their occu-
pation, unwarrantable punishment being dealt out to those
unfortunate enough to incur the displeasure of the German
officials.
A Battalion parade ground was selected east of the
church, between the Le-Petit-Fayt Road and the Petite-Helpe
River, but training comprised principally route marching. On
November 29 a muster parade was held, and the principles


upon which the Australian Forces were to be repatriated were
explained to the Battalion. A little information was also given
regarding our march to Charleroi.
On December i, 1918, His Majesty King George IV.,
accompanied by the Prince of Wales and General Rawlinson
and Staff of the 4th Army, visited the Australian Corps area.
The troops of the 2nd Division were paraded in a field close
to the northern side of the Marbaix-Maroilles main road, mid-
way between the villages, where they were inspected by His
Majesty en route from Avesnes to Maroilles.
On December 4, a wet and miserable day, we played ano-
ther football match against the 28th Battalion, who won a
fairly interesting game. Three days later another game was
played between “A” and “B” Companies of the 27th Batta-
lion, “B” Company winning.
Although of little interest to the reader in general, the
story of our rest at Le-Grand-Fayt would be incomplete from
the Battalion’s point of view without a reference to the tre-
mendous enthusiasm displayed by the troops in connection
with the discovery by the authorities of a new kind of bianco
for improving the appearance of our equipment, or, as the
troops declared, for transforming new equipment into old.
We were ordered to paint our equipment with a paste
made of clay and water, hang it out to dry and harden, then
with a brush remove the surplus mud. Many an hour was
spent in vain efforts to maintain a universal colour throughout
the whole set of equipment. One could not help thinking of
the times in the early days of the Somme fighting of 1916,
when after practically wading through such mud, every speck
of it had to be carefully removed at the earliest opportunity
following our relief from the trenches. Now we had to care-
fully mix and paint our equipment with the old Somme
curse!!
Route marching continued to be the principal training
indulged in, from which it was generally surmised that some
long marches still lay ahead of us.
On December 13 Lieutenant-Colonel F. R. Chalmers,
D. 5.0., returning from English leave, was appointed Acting
G.O.C. the 7th Brigade, Major P. C. Raper taking over the
temporary command of the Battalion.


On December 15 we received orders that the 7th Brigade
would move by march route to the Marcinelle area, the march
to commence on December 17 and conclude on December 20.
The destination of the 27th Battalion was Mont-sur-
Marchienne, to which place Captain R. D. Southon, M.C.,
Lieutenant W. R. C. Coleman, M.C., Lieutenant C. J. Rollins,
M.C., and Corporal J. C. Nettel had proceeded on December
8 to arrange for the billeting of the Battalion.
The recent rains, together with the constant stream of
traffic moving towards the forward areas, left the roads in a
wretched condition for marching, but this troubled us very
little, as all were anxious to move into fresh surroundings.
The Battalion was astir very early on December 17, when
the weather conditions, heavy showers at intervals, gave every
promise of an extremely wet march, waterproof sheets being
ordered to be carried in a handy position ready for use if
required.
Our destination the first day was Beaufort, a compact
little village situated about five miles due south of Maubeuge.
Headed by the band and standard bearers carrying the Aus-
tralian and Regimental flags, the Battalion left Le-Grand-Fayt
shortly after 8 a.m., and reached Cartignies half an hour later,
the G.O.Cs. of the Brigade and Division watching the Brigade
column march past.
Immediately after crossing the Petite-Helpe River by the
Dompierre Road, we halted for the first rest at 9 a.m. A
second halt was made south of the village of Dompierre, and
the third near St. Aubin, where the cookers were drawn into
a field and lunch was issued to the troops. Resuming our
march at 12 noon, we passed through Dourlers and Eclaibes
to Beaufort, arriving at 2.30 p.m.
While resting south of Eclaibes we were met by guides
from the billeting party, who, immediately upon reaching
Beaufort, guided the companies to their respective billets.
The accommodation consisted chiefly of barns, but plenty
of straw was available for beds. The people were very hos-
pitable, and wherever possible made the officers and men very
comfortable.


The Battalion Medical Officer (Captain C. J. Davis), tem-
porarily attached during the absence on leave of Captain Ma-
theson, was taken ill during the evening, and Captain D. A. A.
Davis reported to the Battalion from the 7th Field Ambulance
the following morning.
The Headquarters personnel were billeted in the music
hall, but very few felt inclined to indulge in dancing after
their long march, although the whole Battalion marched well
during each stage of the day’s journey.
The following morning at g. 15 a.m. we resumed our
march to Cousolre, passing through the villages of Damousies,
Obrechies, Quievelon, and Aibes en route.
Our billets at Beaufort were vacated at 8.45 a.m. in time
for the Battalion to arrive at the Brigade starting point, the
cross roads in the small village of Ropsies, immediately east
of Beaufort, at 9.15 a.m. It was raining hard when the
march commenced, and continued to do so practically the
whole of the way.
The Battalion rested at Obrechies, again at a point south
of Quievelon, and from the third halt, which was near the
railway crossing the main Cousolre Road, continued on until
reaching its destination at 1 p.m. No halt was made for
lunch owing to the rain, but a hot drink was issued immedi-
ately following our arrival, and fires were lighted in the billets
to enable the men to dry their clothes as much as possible.
The British front line at the cessation of hostilities ran close
to the village, and was part of the general line from which the
4th Army commenced its advance to the Rhine.
The Battalion was billeted in the town hall and several
empty houses, principally in the north-eastern portion of the
village.
We resumed the march the following morning in bright
sunshine, our destination for the day being Thuin, passing
through the villages of Bousignies and Leers-et-Fosteau en
route.
The Battalion, starting from the cross roads immediately
east of Cousolre at 8.10 a.m., marched to the Brigade starting
point west of Bousignies, where a halt was called prior to


joining the Brigade column at 9.28 a.m. When crossing the
French and Belgian frontier an unusually severe wind and
rain storm was encountered, which lasted for about half an
hour, after which the rain ceased and fine weather prevailed
for the remainder of the day. The usual rests of ten minutes
during each hour were taken, but the halt for an hour for
lunch was abandoned, as the boys were very wet. Thuin was
reached at 1 p.m., and our billets, situated about a mile be-
yond the town, half an hour later.
Although the town was fairly large, the Battalion had
unfortunately been allotted a billeting area which offered very
few facilities for comfort, but all ranks accepted the situation
philosophically, realising that the next day’s march would
bring them to their ultimate destination. The “Gendarmerie”
accommodated two companies and the band; the other two
companies were accommodated in the hay lofts at a farm.
The nearer the troops approached to Charleroi, the
greater became the number of their inquiries of the villagers
as to the size of, and general conditions existing in, the famous
Belgian town. Such encouraging descriptions were given,
that had anything occurred to necessitate the Battalion’s de-
tention at Thuin for more than one day, it is probable that
many of the boys would have been tempted to finish the
journey unofficially.
It was raining steadily when at 8.45 a.m. on December 20,
the Battalion commenced the last stage of the march to
Mont-sur-Marchienne, the route being via Gozee and Bomeree
railway crossing. Capt. Southon, as guide, met the Battalion
near the railway crossing, and passing over the steep hill be-
yond the railway, laughingly described as “the last ridge,”
our destination was in sight. We marched through the Rue
de Charleroi about noon, to the tune of “The Boys of the
Dardanelles,” and the many civilians lining the route tendered
us a vociferous welcome.
The rapidity with which the troops were settled in their
respective billets reflected great credit upon the complete and
thorough manner in which Capt. Southon and his advance
party had carried out their duties. The prize of 150 francs,
promised to the company marching the best throughout the


four days’ journey, was won by “D” Company, “C” Company
being considered a very close second.
After disposing of their equipment, exploration of the
new surroundings was indulged in, the troops being welcomed
in every direction, many windows displaying notices bearing
the words: “Welcome Our Brave Liberators.” The hospi-
tality was universal; civilians of all classes applied for the
privilege of billeting the troops, in some cases the best bed-
rooms being placed at the disposal of the men.
Advantage was taken of the free tram ride into Char-
leroi, about two miles distant, where the large shopping centre
and picture palaces were visited with interest. The scattering
of troops throughout Mont-sur-Marchienne entailed con-
siderable extra work on the N.C.O.’s, who were responsible
for warning the men for the various duties they were re-
quired to perform.
While here, the A.I.F. Educational scheme was put into
operation so far as the 27th Battalion was concerned. Edu-
cational classes were held under the supervision of Lieut.
W. L. Davis, M.C., who was appointed Educational Officer.
French, Book-keeping, and other subjects were taught, and
later, arrangements were made whereby men were given the
privilege of attending factories and workshops in the vicinity
for a few hours each day, to enable them to get in touch again
with the various trades which had formed their pre-war oc-
cupations. Only the training necessary for troops quartered
in such a densely populated area was carried out, all time
possible being given to the men to refresh their memories
and fit themselves for civil occupations.
The chief leave centre was Brussels, about 60 miles due
north of Charleroi, where a rest camp was established for the
purpose of providing meals and a bed for those who cared
to report there. Of the many interesting spots visited by the
troops, Waterloo and Dinant are best remembered. The
battlefield of Waterloo, where the famous battle was fought
on June 18, 1815, is situated on the Charleroi-Brussels road,
some 12 miles south of the last-named town. A large number
of troops visited the battleground, where the guides pointed
out the positions occupied by the troops engaged in that
battle. Dinant, having a pre-war population of 7,490, is


prettily situated on the east banks of the River Meuse.
During the great German onrush of 1914, the town was crip-
pled by the invaders, and a great number of civilians were
numerically slaughtered by machine gun fire.
Although leave was difficult to obtain, a few of the troops
visited Cologne, and returned contented with having seen the
famous Rhine River.
On December 24, 1918, H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, then
attached to the Australian Corps, presented medals won by
the troops of the 7th Brigade throughout the recent fighting.
The Brigade was paraded on the 27th Battalion parade ground
and witnessed the presentation, following which the troops
marched past the Prince in column of route. Cpl. L. L. Buck-
ley, Lance-Cpl. J. H. Davey, and Ptes. H. L. Montgomery,
A. J. Hunt, C. L. Normington, and H. H. Carter were the
members of the 27th Battalion decorated on this occasion.
Christmas Day was most pleasantly spent; the Company
Officers provided an excellent dinner for their men, who also
received the usual Christmas boxes from the Australian Com-
forts Fund. Among the expressions of good wishes for the
festive season received by the Battalion was one from our ex-
Corps Commander, General Birdwood.
On December 31, the Battalion was paraded for the pur-
pose of being photographed by the Official Photographer, who,
however, did not arrive to time, and the parade was dismissed.
The Companies and a group of the Battalion Officers were
photographed after his arrival some hours later.


CHAPTER XXXVI.
BACK TO AUSTRALIA.
The dawn of the New Year 1919 found the 27th Battalion
still at Mont-sur-Marchienne, enjoying all the comforts that
could be desired, and eagerly discussing the projected de-
parture of the first draft to leave the Battalion for return to
Australia.
An added interest was attached to training by the offer
of a Cup, to be given by the Officers of the 27th Battalion,
to the best platoon.
Recreational training consisted chiefly of football under
Australian rules, every effort being made, by those interested
in the 27th Battalion team, to arrange matches with teams
holding practically unbeaten records throughout their services
in France and Belgium. On January 3, our Battalion team
met a representative team of the 48th Battalion, and won a
keenly contested game by 4 goals. Despite our long run of
brilliant football successes against the various Units compris-
ing the 2nd Australian Division, it had long been held, and
was generally accepted throughout the Battalion, that the 24th
Battalion team was the champion of the Division. However,
in a contest held on the afternoon of January 10, the 27th
Battalion team defeated the 24th Battalion quite easily, the
scores reading:
24th Battalion— 3 goals 4 behinds.
27th Battalion—n goals 6 behinds.
On January 10, the following Officers left the Battalion
en route for Australia:—Capts. Schramm and Newell, Lieuts.
Read, Crewes, Arthur, Nordin, Summerfield, and Bertram.
In the New Year’s Honours Despatch, the following
members of the Battalion were listed as recipients of the Bel-
gian Croix de Guerre:—Lieut. A. M. Moore, Sgt. H. Oldfield,
Ptes. J. Maly and R. G. Traegar.


On January u, the final competition for the Platoon Cup
resulted in a splendid win by No. G Platoon, “B” Company ;
with “D” Company second, and “A” and “C” Companies third
and fourth. Lieut.-Col. P. Currie, D. 5.0., of the 28th Bat-
talion, acted as sole judge throughout the competition.
At 1 p.m., January 15, the first draft to leave for Aus-
tralia, one officer and 126 men, were paraded at Battalion
Headquarters, where they were addressed by A/Brigadier
Lieut.-Col. F. R. Chalmers, D. 5.0., who in a very effective
speech wished each and all “Bon Voyage.”
On January 17, 1919, Lieut.-Col. Chalmers, D. 5.0., re-
sumed the command of the Battalion.
On January 20, a Brigade parade and presentation of
medals was carried out in the square at Marcinelle, Lieut.
A. M. Moore and Pte. R. G. Traeger receiving the Belgian
Croix de Guerre.
Two days later a representative team of the 7th Brigade
played a football match against a team from the 6th Brigade,
the final scores, following a very interesting game, being:—
6th Brigade— 3 goals 4 behinds.
7th Brigade—7 goals 8 behinds.
Consequent upon the return to Australia of men in the
Motor Transport and other special branches of the service,
members of the Battalion, not eligible for return for some
time, were detached to fill the vacancies thus occasioned.
This, and the departure of our own drafts towards the first
quotas, depleted the strength of the Battalion, and incidentally
the whole Division.
Evidences of the strong friendships which had been
formed between the Belgian civilians and the troops were
shown when many of the boys, loathe to leave their friends,
decided to forego their priority and allow others to return
in their stead. The departure of the troops from Charleroi
signalled a general holiday for many of the civilians who
flocked to the station in hundreds to bid farewell to the boys
whose friendship they valued so much. Thoughtful to the
last, they prepared sandwiches and comforts to carry
the boys over the long journey to the coast.
On January 25, Major W. S. Hosking, M.C., Lieut. A,
M. Moore, Croix de Guerre, and 45 other ranks left the Bat-
talion en route for Australia.


On February 2, following a special request by Lieut.-Col.
Chalmers, Sgt. H. M. Skinner, accompanied by Pte. R. Bar-
rington, the Battalion Official Photographer, left Mont-sur-
Marchienne for the purpose of photographing the scattered
graves of members of the Battalion who had fallen on the
various battlefields of France and Belgium. Despite the dif-
ficulties encountered throughout the trip, many photographs
were obtained, and copies were subsequently forwarded to the
next-of-kin or near relations of the deceased soldiers.
The remainder of the time spent at Mont-sur-Marchienne
passed all too quickly, every day being made most interesting
by some particular event, either in connection with visits to
the surrounding towns and villages, or the various sports
meetings held throughout the Corps area.
Troops continued to leave the Battalion from time to
time for return to Australia, until the Battalion personnel be-
came very small in number, and following a minor re-organi-
sation of the 7th Brigade on February 3, the 7th Trench
Mortar Battery and the 27th and 28th Battalions became one
Battalion under the command of Lieut.-Col. F. R. Chalmers,
D.S.O. The Brigade was again re-organised on March 14,
when the sth, 6th, and 7th Brigades were amalgamated into
one Brigade group and placed under the command of the
G.O.C. the sth Brigade.
The 7th Brigade then became one Battalion under the
command of Lieut.-Col. W. E. Davis, M.C., and was known
as the 7th A.I. Brigade Battalion.
On April 9, Lieut.-Col. F. R. Chalmers, D. 5.0., left the
Battalion for England, en route to Australia. Prior to his
departure he gave a message to all ranks, in which he ex-
pressed great appreciation of the loyalty shown to him by
Officers, N.C.O.’s, and men, during his command. Following
eulogistic references to the fighting qualities, morale, disci-
pline, and chivalry that characterised the Battalion’s services
abroad, he concluded with the hope that his previously happy
association with his men would continue in the future, when
all had returned safely to Australia and their civilian state.
On May 14, a ceremonial parade of the Australian Corps
was held near Chatelet, and following the inspection by the
Corps Commander, General Hobbs, a march past with fixed
bayonets was carried out, the General taking the salute.
Several thousands of civilians assembled fo witness this last
parade of the Australians in Belgium.


On May 20, 1919, the final draft of the “Blue and Brown
Diamonds,” attached to No. 55 Quota, left Charleroi for
England, en route to Australia. Capt. R. Southon, M.C., to-
gether with Sgts. T. Whelan, M.S.M., H. M. Skinner, M.M.,
F. Wilton, and T. R. Bampton, constituted the Battalion
cadre to convey records to England. Capt. Southon, how-
ever, was detained at Charleroi for further duty, but rejoined
the draft at Havre in time to accompany it to England on
May 28. Upon reaching the camp at Sutton-Veny, the
cadres attached to the quota were immediately dispatched to
London.
On June 4, 1919, Capt. Southon and Sgt. Whelan finally
handed over to the Australian Records Section, London, the
27th Battalion’s Records, the compilation of which was per-
formed, in a large measure, during their long services as
Adjutant and Orderly Room Sergeant.




APPENDICES


TRIBUTES
FROM THE COMMANDING OFFICERS.
LIEUT.-COL. W. DOLLMAN, V.D.
As the first Commanding Officer of the 27th Battalion, A.1.F., I
venture to express my appreciation of the honour such an appointment
conferred upon me. My recollection of those early days of 1915,
when I was first posted .to command a unit, to be brought into being,
is very keen to-day. I had to recommend the appointment of all
officers, post them to their various duties, select the non-commissioned
officers and specialists, and mould the unit from enthusiastic recruits
into a disciplined body fit for active service. The task was interest-
ing, though arduous, but the general good feeling amongst all ranks
and the high spirit which animated everybody smoothed out many
difficulties, and despite occasional problems hard of solution, we left
Adelaide well equipped and set our faces to a task new to nearly
all of us. How that task was performed this History serves to
show, but of my personal feelings as Commanding Officer of the Unit
from its mobilisation until I left it in August, 1916, I desire to make
brief reference. The Battalion trained hard and effectively in Egypt,
and its work on Gallipoli was distinguished by thoroughness and initia-
tive. The splendid work accomplished in making our trench line an
effective defence and the remarkable cleanliness and satisfactory sani-
tation gained the approval of all visiting staffs. The valuable service
rendered by the Unit in the early days of the evacuation period gained
a special commendation from Gen. Sir A. Godley, at that time our
Divisional Commander. The work in Egypt in the early part of
1916 was hard and exacting, and the news of our sailing orders for
France came as a welcome surprise. Very few days elapsed between
our arrival in the North of France and our first occupation of the
trenches facing “Fritz,” and the work and service of all ranks in this
new phase of their military service was in the highest degree satis-
factory. Our subsequent service in the Messines sector gave us new
experiences, and the later march to the Somme and our participation
in the big advance proved conclusively the strength and value of the
27th Battalion.
I found and made many friends among all ranks, and I esteem at
a high value my association with the Unit, and in all sincerity I record
my humble opinion that the 27th Battalion was second to no other
unit in the British Imperial Forces.


LIEUT.-COL. J. C. F. SLANE, D. S.O., V.D.
To those lads who did the deeds that are recorded in this little
book do I dedicate these few words of appreciation.
What better knowledge of men could one require than that which
comes through living and suffering with them through years of war,
and such war as it has never before been the lot of man to experience?
Now, to know on intimate terms, such men as those makers of
History who provided the material for this book is more than a
privilege; it is an honour of the highest order and an honour which
I prize above all others.
It is with some shame that I recall my feelings of the night of
September 10, 1915, the night of our landing at Gallipoli; feelings of
doubt and uneasiness because of the very short and inadequate period
of training which our lads had undergone. The first few days in the
line at Cheshire Ridge dispelled ail those doubts and filled me with a
confidence which was fully justified by the subsequent behaviour of
the “Diggers” of the Twenty Seventh.
It soon became evident to me that the soldierly qualities and high
courage of cur lads more than compensated for any lack of training,
and when, a few months later, they charged at Pczieres and carried
the highest position on the Somme Battlefields, they proved, not only
to me, but to all the world, that no finer soldiers were to be found
in Europe.
During my tenure of command from Pozieres until after Pass-
chendaele my admiration for the “Digger” developed until it became
a reverence, and, whatever faults he has, the “Digger” will always
remain to me the personification of chivalry and valour.
I shall never record a statue of Mars as true art unless it wears
an Australian hat and a blue and brown diamond!
I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks to all who served
with me for their loyalty and unwavering support, and to congratulate
them on our long succession of victories without a single failure.
To those of us who have remained behind in Gallipoli, France, and
Belgium, awaiting the last “Reveille,” do I pay my deepest tribute
of respect; may their memory never fade. They include many of my
dearest friends, and to their bereaved ones do I extend my heartfelt
sympathy. In conclusion, let me join with Colonels Dollman and
Chalmers in taking off our hats to those “who fought with us upon
Saint Crispin’s Day.”


LIEUT.-COL. F. R. CHALMERS, C.M.G., D.S.O.
My association with the “Boys” of the 27th Battalion, A.1.F., ex-
tending from May, 1915, until April, 1919, will ever remain the most
pleasant of my life. In connection with this fitting record of their
achievements on the battlefields of France and Belgium I am grasping
the opportunity to pay a tribute to their splendid work and sterling
qualities “Over There.” It has been my privilege to rub shoulders
with men who were endov/ed with the finest principles of manhood,
many of whom, alas, I shall never meet again. I feel that I can
never thank them sufficiently for their loyalty and good fellowship
during the whole time I was privileged to command them.
Throughout the evolutionary phases of the Great War, from the
eyeopening days of GALLIPOLI, the First SOMME Offensive, the
trying and bitter experiences of the winter of 1916-1917. The dark
days immediately following the German advance, 1918, until the vic-
torious advance of the Allies, August, 1918, I was spared to share
with them the fortune and misfortune that have been their lot, and I
know they can fight uphill as well as down. The battles of
PQZIERES, FLEES, WARLENCOURT, LAGNICOURT, BUL-
LECOURT, POLYGON WOOD, ZONNEBEKE, BROODSEINDE
RIDGE, MORLANCOURT, VILLERS BRETONNEUX. WAR-
FUSSEE, ABANCOURT, FRAMER VIL.LE, BIACHES, HAUT
ALLAINES, MONT ST. QUENTIN, GRANDCOURT, MONT-
BREHAIN, the stepping-stones of the Battalion’s fame, are all
worthy of tribute from a far abler pen than mine, to the gallantry and
heroism displayed by all who took part in them.
Off the field the “Boys” proved themselves clean in sport, whilst
their chivalry commanded the everlasting respect of the women and
children of France and Belgium.
All my life I shall look back with pride to the days when they
were my comrades-in-arms, and whilst enjoying the peace which they
in their unselfish sacrifice, did so much to establish, they will ever
remain to me friends and comrades-in-arms.
