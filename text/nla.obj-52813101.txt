Macquarie river. Sullivan had been
down to Sydney and got married to a
pretty girl from the immigrant ship,
“Red Rover.” When the happy
couple, on their way home, arrived at
the roadside inn abovementioned, the
wattle trees around were all in full
bloom, and the happy young bride
was heard to gush forth her admira-
tion in the words, 1 ‘ What beautiful
orange blossoms ! ” One can under-
stand how teamsters would afterwards
“take off” the,young woman by saying,
“ We’ll camp to-night at the * orange
blossoms’ 1 ” and such like ; how the
landlord of the bush pub would tell
his little yarn to the bushmen congre-
gated round bis bar ; and how those .
peculiar processes in the history of a
name at last reduced and settled upon
what was destined to one day.be an
important city in the west, the cogno-
men of Orange.
From Orange I went on with the
team to Molong, theses to Buckumbar
station, some 15 miles from Welling-
ton. Here we had three weeks’ stay
to rest the bullocks. We then yoked
and travelled to Giong, and camped.,
at a Government yard, where there
was good grass.
Every morning the driver, Joe
H , who was a fair tyrant, used
to make mo walk bare-footed through
the frosty grass to obtain water, a
mile away, for the men.
We next went back to Bathurst,
and thence into the Wallerawang dis-
trict to the Middle river, where Joe’s
mate, who owned the other team, had
a bit of a farm. Joe had seven bul-
locks altogether.
The bullock-punchers had different
methods of arranging the teams in
those days to what we have now.
For instance, Joe drove one in the
shafts, harnessed like a horse, in-
cluding winkers, and the other six in
three pairs, whilst the near side
leader also wore winkers.
Whilst we were camped at the
mate’s place there came one night a
very heavy fall of snow. Next morn-
ing Joe sent me out to find the bul-
locks. After a long search I came
across the cattle in a gully about two
n-.'los from the samp. Worse luck
for Joe, I found six of the seven dead.
The owner cursed his luck when I
got back to camp and broke the newe
to him. We then went out together
for the surviving member of, the
team, who was nearly done for. Bat
with a few days’ careful feeding and
attention we managed to pull him
round. .
Leaving the cart and harness at.
his mate’s farm, Joe packed the rest
of his belongings on the other bullock,
the last remnant of his valuable team,
and we set out again for Bathurst,
which we reached iu due course.
The “City of the Plains” then pos-
sessed only two pubs. I also remem-
ber that there was a stockade of con-
victs there, looked after by a number
of English soldiers.
We camped near the cemetery for
about a week Alas! Joe came home
from the town one day and acquainted
me with the sad news that he could
not keep me any longer, and that I
would have to look out for myself.
This was in the year 1836. I was
then 10 years of age
But notwithstanding my youthful
years, and the hard knocks I had
experienced along with Bullooky Joe,
Sydney could not allure me home
again. No; I turned round again,
and set out for the Lachlan river.
And when I tell you of my subsequent
experiences out there, including my
life amongst the wild Macks, and,
later on, my close connections with
the famous bushrangers, you will be
patting me down for a second “De
Rougemont;” but I can assure you
that the narrative of my early days
needs no padding—no drawing upon
the imagination—no departure from
fact—to make it good reading.
(To be continued.)
[all bights besbrved.J
spending a holiday at the country
home at Campbelltown, I essayed my
first task of travelling into the interior.
How I managed to at last reach the
uncle’s place would make a long story;
but bullock teams and the backs of
coaches contributed material assis-
tance. In due course the letter was
handed tremblingly to the stern-
looking uncle, and,.much to my relief,
the forgery was not detected.
A jweet rural life followed.- I
found that the country was the place
for me! .
The assigned servants—the Go-
vernment men—were frequently sent
on trips to the Menangle river, three
miles distant, to draw water for the
bouse. The method- of conveyance
was a slide, with an old bullock yoked
to the shafts, just as we now yoke up
the horses. It was my delight to ac-
company the men on those trips; to
learn the ways of the bush; to listen
to their tales.
All went along swimmingly, and in
time I had almost learned to forget
whether the old people in Sydney
were any longer worrying themselves
as to my whereabouts.
But the day of reckoning came at
last, for one evening, on returning to
the house after a week’s camp away
in the back paddocks, I found, to my
horror, that my uncle had been down
to Sydney, and was surprised to learn
from his sister (my mother) that, after
all, his model nephew was but a de-
lusion and a snare.
My uncle got a chain and padlocks,
securely fastened me to a post, and
whaled me with a greenhide till 1 was
past crying.
For two days and nights I remained
in bondage, and was subject to a
criminal’s tucker.
On the third day, at the solicita-
tions of my aunt, I was sot free again;
and then my uncle lost no time in
getting me sent home again to
Sydney, where I was received like the
prodigal son.
I was then 9 years of age. I went
back to school again, and filled in the
superfluous time —away from the
school discipline—at getting into
git-atex mischief than ever.
For six or seven months I had been
back in the old haunts, and was
continually planning out desperate
deeds that my boyish recklessness
suggested. An orphan boy, assigned
to us as a servant, at last persuaded
me to run away this time along
with him. We decided to try and
get over the Blue Mountains to
Bathurst. In the stillness of the
night we made up imr little swags,
sneaked out the window, and made a
s-art on foot.
We walked as far as the Lapstone
Mountain, above Penrith. Chain
gangs were then making the roadway
over the mountains. There we picked
up with some bullock teams, and they
ag reed to give us a lift, in return for
which we had to graft like little
niggers.. It took us three days to
cross the mountains.
Near BUckheath a five-horse dray
overtook us, and here my mate turned
dog on bis pal by persuading the
driver of the cart to take biro. So I
was left behind with the bullock
team. But I afterwards ascertained
that the other boy, when going down
the Mount Victoria pass towards
Hartley Vale, was collared by the
Hartley police, and sent back to
Sydney. Only that the team I was
with turned to the right on reaching
the foot of the pass, I would have been
discovered, too. However, a more
extensive absence from the paternal
roof was in store for me.
I went on with the bullock team to
Bathurst, then through Blackman’s
Swamp, now called Orange. ’
I smile when I think of the
modern Orange, lately a strong
claimant to the Federal Capital, and
the place as I saw it then. There was
only a bit of a low, weatherboard,
roadside inn aud a blacksmith's shop
That was all.
How that nucleus of a town at the
foot of the Canobl-a come to be called
Orange, is not generally known. 1
may say I bad a letter from a recent
Mayor of Orange, soliciting my ex-
planation of the name. I have never
seen it published, and perhaps no one
knows nut myself. I will. tell you.
Its origin arose from a romantic little
episode. One of the teams I was with
belonged to a man named Paddy
Sullivan, a little squatter near the
Early Colonial Days
The Biography of a Reliable
Old Native,
. JOHN McGUIRE.
A graphic ani interesting epitome of
the stirring times of long ago, replete
with sensational incidents and thrill-
ing episodes.
Written by W. H. Pinkstone,
After many interviews and
fireside chats.
1.
I was born in Kent-streot, Sydney,
on 28th April, 1826. My mother was
also a native —a Hawkeebury native.
She was born at Richmond in 1806.
My father was a native of Dublin,
and came out to the colonies in 1818.
I had two brothers and three sisters,
but the only members of the family
now left are myself and the eldest
•brother, who is at present living out
On the Bland, and is 84 years of age.
At 6* years of age I was sent to
school in Sydney, The school was of
the Catholic denomination, situated
in Castlereagh-streot, and run by a
teacher named Cosgrove.
Sydney, in those days, was a big
contrast to the Sydney of to-day.
I might say that my earliest recol-
lections carry me back to the time
when George-street was a succession
of wooden houses on wheels ; when
the George-street markets wore bits
of bark shops. Circular Quay was
then known as King’s wharf. Many
a time, whilst passing the old Hyde
Park Barracks, 1 heard the cries of
the poor convicts as they were being
flogged. The soldiers used to prac-
tice at a target down at Woolloomoo-
loo Bay.
When I was about seven years old
I was one day poking about the bush,
and happened iu got feeding my
boyish curiosity by watching one of
the soldiers digging up a movable
target. The man, who, it appears,
was rather intoxicated at the time,
brought his spade down upon my
foot, cutting it nearly off. Some of
the other soldiers carried me home,
and it was fourteen weeks before I
could walk again, during which time
the clumsy man with the spade had
to endure a like period of confinement
in the “-black hole” by way of
punishment.
Another unfortunate episode strong-
ly impressed upon my memory was a
childish experiment I made with some
ammunition. Making a gun out of a
bullock’s bone, I rammed it with
powder, and proceeded to fire it off.
The wonder is that I ever lived to tell
the tale. Up I went! For three
months there was no more mischief
that I could see my way into; and I
believe 1 should have been blind for
life but for the admirable cure of a
fond and faithful hlackfellow who, by
a peculiar process of doctoring (by
the use of his tongue), at last restored
me to the.blessings of light.
1 used to live near Father Tberry
(the well known priest who died some
fifteen or twenty years ago). He
was then the only Catholic priest in
the colony. One day, for some more
of my mischief, which consisted this
time of offending Father Therry’s
housekeeper, the reverend gentleman
administered to me, in addition to
some spiritual advice on the error of
my ways, a horse-whipping, the sever-
ity of which increased my reverence
for him for many a long day.
During my school days there was
an uncle of mine living at Campbell-
town. To reach Campbelltown now,
with all the modern railway conveni-
ences, is no trouble. But there were
no railways in those days. The top-
notch method of travelling then was
by means of four-horse coaches; and
Campbelltown was considered a long
way “up the country.” Well, I
wanted to get to this “ out-back ”
place, but the home folk were not in-
clined to indulge -me in my desire.
But I was not to be bilked out of the
trip, so 1 got an older schoolboy to
write ts my uncle a letter purparting
to come from my mother ; and, armed
with this missive of explanation as to


2.
Resuming from Bathurst on foot, I
pedded as far as King’s Plains (now
called Blayney), 21 miles from
Bathurst.
Blayney is now an important station
on the Western line —the link of the
connecting line with the Southern
trank. But there was only one pub
when I first came across the place, in
1836, A man named Doyle was the
licensee. There was also a mill,
which I believe is there still. It was
worked then by a man named
Lambert.
Here 1 got in with a team, and
went on with it through Carooar.
Carcoar consisted of one wayside
inn (kept by an old man named
George Stammers), one blacksmith
shop, and a small store.
We travelled on till we came to the
Lachlan, at a place called Merri-
gunowrie (a native name signifying
that it had been a camp for the native
dogs).
Merrigunowrie was a station owned
1»y a Mr. das. Grant. I believe a son
of the original owner is there at
present.
We proceeded down the river,
reaching Mundabong, now called
Forbes, and camped where now stands
the police station of that rising town.
Mr, Geo. Rankin, of Bathurst, owned
the site of the future town as a dairy,
rented from him by one Dick Nigh-
ton. It was along with this dairy-
man that I reached the place, for it
was with his team I journeyed over
from King’s Plains. Nighton had been
to Sydney with a load of cheese.
After working a month on the dairy
I was sent, along with a stockman
named Jim Leech and a black boy, to
a station 10 miles away, called Curra-
wobbuddy, owned by a squatter
named Thos. Morris.
The three of us were camped on a
lonely part of this large run for about
a mouth, when Leech left us to go to
Sydney.
We waited several weeks, and there
was still no sign of Leech’s return, so,
along with the black boy from the
station, I joined the wild blacks.
I soon got into the ways of the
piccaninnies, and found lots of fun
joining in their little sports and pas-
times We used to make spears out
of kangaroo grass and shields out of
gum bark, and have our juvenile
fights.
For three years I lived with the
blacks, and during that time never
saw a white person. Along with them
I lived on ’possum, bandicoot, snake,
“ goana,” grubs, etc. We never
stayed more than two or three days
in the one camp (excepting in wet
weather), but would keep shifting, if
only half-a-mile away. When the
weather was good, a few bushes
served as a shelter for the night;
when rain came, a strip of bark was
all the cover we looked for.
During th ise wild years amongst
the natives I witnessed many corro-
borees. Sometimes 200 and 300 took
part at once. The piccaninnies used
to copy the old ’uns , and that is how
I learnt the dance and war exercise
which I have several times since given
for the amusement of the public.
A lot that 1 could tell you about
the blacks and their habits would
hardly come within the bounds of
decency to publish. I prefer to hurry
on to tke more exciting times in my
life—the bushranging days.
My experience with the blacks,
however, was not confined to the
three years about which I have just
related. Indeed, that was but a small
beginning. But, in passing, I might
tell you of a great fight which took
place near Wagga, about the year
1861. I was living out on the Lach-
lan at the time, and was the owner
of a piece of country on the river.
A tribe from near Forbes, having
made up their minds to import some
more “ gins” into the camp, journeyed
over to the Murrumbidgee, and had a
great battle with a tribe which hap-
pened to be camped about seven miles
from Wagga, at a place now known
as “ The Sandhill,” latterly owned by
the late Mr. Duan.
Seven of the ’Bidgee blacks were
slaughtered, and their "better-halves”
taken into captivity by the visiting
warriors, who brought them home to
the Lachlan.
I was present at the return to
camp. Each man, in accordance with
the custom on such an occasion, had,
on the point of a stick, some portion
of the bodies of the killed “ Sand-
hillers.” One would have, say, a
hand, another a piece of a thigh, and
so on.
On pitching camp at night, on the
journey back, each man would take a
mouthful of the junk he carried, eat
it, and then, with a piece ?of fat, rub
himself all over. This, it was be-
lieved, made them strong.
But I have been departing from the
chronological order of my story. To
return ;
After three years with the blacks,
on hearing that some white men had
come to Currawobbudy and set up a
dairy, I bade adieu to that kind of
living, and got a position as cowboy
on the old place.
I used to go by the title of “Jacky.”
My real name was known to no one
out there for years afterwards.
The owner of the dairy was called
Sheehan. He rented the place from
the owner, Morris,
By this time I was 15 years old,
and had accumulated some worldly
belongings, in the shape of a few
cattle, given to me by the stockmen
for taking care of their weaners.
Getting a present of that sort now and
then,l at last was able to muster 20
head that I could call my own. Money
I had never handled. My actual work
on the dairy went in return for my
tucker and clothes.
One day Mr. Morris came along
collecting fat cattle to send to Sydney,
and 1 arranged te accompany him.
Swopping for a mare, I soon found
myself droving his lot to Sydney.
We proceeded via Mount Macquarie,
down the back road through Hartley,
and over the Emu Plains once more.
Reaching Sydney, we got rid of
the cattle, and once more I turned up
at the old home in Woolloomooloo,
and once more the prodigal boy was
received into the bosom of the family.
For a while I kept the whole family
amused with the tales of my youthful
adventures away on the other side of
the mountains.
During the live or six years I had
been away Sydney had altered wonder-
fully. I returned to And that the
primitive shops and dwellings of
George-street were being drawn away
into ths back streets to- mako room
for more substantial edifices; and
other important improvements were
taking place.
But after a week or two spent at
home, I yielded ones more to the
yearnings for the bush life, and went
back to the same station, where some
eventful things happened.
But before I chronicle those
exciting events, I will give you a
description of old Sydney—the first
scene of Australian colonisation —at
the time of my earliest recollections,
which go back to over seventy years
ago.
A fence ran across from Ultimo to
a toll-bar gate standing near where
is now the great Redfern railway
terminus. The area within the fence
was koown as the ‘‘town’’side, and
all beyond, “the country.”
Only old hands like myself can
realise what I feel now when I take a
run to the city of the big smoke and
ramble round the old scenes. There
is one old pub there yet which I can
never pass by without a drink, for
the sake of “ Auld Lang Syne.” It
still bears its ancient name, “The
Square and Compass.” Only recently
I bad a drink in the old bar. The
stone building is somewhat altered,
but the main portion is the same as
when I knew it over three score
years ago.
My recollections of old Sydney go
back to 1830, a long while to look
back in a man’s life.
Where the great Redfern railway
now stands there was then a dense
scrub. In the cemetery opposite,
recently removed to allow of an
extension of ths railway yards, only a
few bodies had by then been buried.
The main cemetery was down George-
street, where the Town Hall and the
Cathedral now stand.
I remember when the work of the
old Poor House was commenced.
Nearly everyone remembers that old
building which stood just down from
the railway station.
Opposite, on the corner of George
and Pitt streets (they were called
roads —not streets—then) was a toll-
bar, Here we had to pay a Id to go
on foot. The charge for a horse or
horse and vehicle 1 forget.
From the toll-bar a fence ran
across Ultimo to the harbour. On the
other side farms and fences blocked
ingress to the town, and I believe the
only road in was through the toll-bar
gate.
Inside the fence, as I said, was
known as the “ town ” side, and all
beyond that dividing line was alluded
to as “ the country.” Suburbs, of
course, were not thought of in those
days.
There were a few farmers close to
the town, but the land was not too
good for cultivation, being too sandy.
There were a few vegetable gardens
about.
The low part of what is now George-
street West (then an unnamed road
leading to the country) was a swamp,
known as Black Wattle Swamp.
Near this swamp was a slaughter-
ing house, where the cattle .were
butchered for town use. I have
actually seen cattle in the yards there
for fourteen days before being
slaughtered, A young schoolmate of
mine came to an untimely end there
by falling amongst the cattle and
being trampled.
Cooper’s distillery was the only
other building near by. When I was
last along that way (in about ’95), I
noticed the old building being used
for a flour mill.
Coming back to town, and passing
through the toll-bar, there were no
buildings until we got to the Hay-
market —thus called, because it was
there that sales of hay took place.
The open space of ground used to
present a busy scene, for the farmers
from Penri h, Campbelltown, Wind-
sor, Parramatta, and all round would
bring in their produce, and back up
the carts to sell the contents, which
would consist of, say, hay, straw,
wheat, maize, barley, &c. But the
principal product was hay.
That place, with its extensive
modern buildings, is now known as
Paddy’s Markets or Belmore
Markets.
On the south-east side of the open
space mentioned was a pound yard,
kept by an old Irishman named Andy
Burns, who also was the owner of a
one-story pub known as “ The Sign 1
of the Black Swin ” Here the !
bullock-punchers and the horse -[
travellers used to put up,
A few doers away stood the “ Wool
Pack Inn,” another resort for the
drivers of the teams; and a little
further away was “ The Square and
Compass,” another great house for
teamsters, then kept by one Ben
Stevenson. As I said before, I never
pass the old “ Square and Compass ”
now without having a drink. I had
a look in there not long ago; and may
be I’ll enjoy another glass or two in
the ancient bar yet ere I follow the
“ ancient boon companions that are
gone.”
Leaving the building mentioned,
there was a bit of a gap for a while
up to the top of Brickfield Hill, so
called because there were several
brick-kilns established in that part of
the town.
The first place of note we came to
next was an hotel kept by one Talbot,
on top of the hill. This ancient relic
has since been replaced by lofty
establishments of another nature, but
in my early days it was the rendez-
vous for the squatter, and was the
booking-office for the mail coaches for
Campbelltown, Bathurst, and other
country places.
There was also a two-storey stone
pub on the hill, kept by Aikenhead,
a big Scotchman, who afterwards
married the widow of a man named
Noble, killed by Vickers and Burdett,
who were subsequently hanged at
Darlinghurst.
Between Aikenhead’s hotel and the
road now called Park-street, there
was, on the left-hand side of the
main road, the cemetery, then open
for burial.
On the same side, close to the
cemetery, was the Central Police
Court, a very small place then.
At the rear of the court, and next
to the George-street markets—recently
replaced by the largest buildings in
the city, the Queen Victoria Mar-
kets were the ancient methods of
punishment, called the stocks. Uany
a time I have seen men and women
in the stocks, paying the penalty
for drunkenness. Some prisoners
might be seejn with o»s foot secured
between the boards, others with both,
according to Ithe gravity of the offence
or the number of appearances hefore
Hie Majesty Is officials. There they
would have to sit, in full view of the
public, to bo jeered and scoffed at, an
occasional wig tantalisingly asking a
prisoner would he come and have a
drink! On Monday mornings there
was usually a numerous array of men
and women " in.”
The stocks remained in the place
mentioned for eight or ten years, to
my knowledge, and were then re-
moved to the corner of York and
Druitt streets, opposite the Bird in
Hand hotel.
The pillory—a method of punish-
ment not now much used in any part
of the world—was also within the vi-
cinity of the old police court, and I
remember seeing a woman undergoing
the punishment of the pillory for a
notorious crime.
At the corner of George and Market
streets was a butcher’s shop, kept by
one Charles Smith. He was the
owner of several racehorses, including
the mare called Lady Kurdiva, on
which Johnny Higgerson, afterwards
a jockey of fame, bad his first mount,
out on the sandy course now called
Handwick. I saw the race myself, and
remember Higgerson being flogged
and jostled by the famous English
rider, Jack Dann.
To return to my description of
Qeorge-street:
The next hotel met with was the
Royal. It was the leading hotel in
Sydney then, and a lot of the old
hands still stay there when on a visit
to the city. It is one of the substan-
tial relics still left of old Sydney.
At the rear of the Royal was the
only theatre in the colony then—the
Victoria.
The next place of note was the post-
office, then a bit of a weather-board
building.
Just above the post-office was a,
spring, the source of a creek called
the Tanks, which coursed down be-
tween Pitt and George streets. It
emptied into the sea at King’s wharf.,
now called Circular Quay. This
creek afforded the first fresh water
available for the town.
Leaving the post-office, we next
meet with the ocldiers’ barracks,
within whose walls were stationed the.
military ; and next to it the gaol,
covering two acres of ground, sur-
rounded by a high stone wall.
I’ll never forget one morning, when
I was about seven years old—the year
1833. I noticed a crowd gathering on
the rocks at the rear of the gaol, anu
I proceeded to satisfy my curiosit’
That was my first view of an execi
tion. Gaining the top of the rocks,
was in time to see two men standing
on the scaffold with the noose round
their necks. Then, suddenly, they
were swung into eternity. I ascer-
tained, from the cries of shame and
the exclamations of the disgusted
populace, that one of the poor
wretches had only stolen a sheep.
Perhaps he was poor and hungry.
At any rate, hanging was the extreme
penalty for such an offence. Tht
other victim had been up for black-
face robbery, better known at
“ masked burglary.”
(To bo continued.)


went together to the garden, and the
prisoner dug up the spoil for them,
whereupon the gacler and the turn-
key pounced upon him and lugged
him back to gaol. In due course be
was brought up at the King-street
police court, found guilty, and had to
pay the extreme penalty of his crime
—execution.
Some years afterwards Samuel
T y got a fall off a building then
in course of erection for King’s Col-
lege, and as a result of the fall he
was paralysed. For many years he
was wheeled around Sydney in a
chair, till he died, an old man At
the time of his death be was reputed
to be worth half a million l in ready
cash, in addition to his city property
and stations up country.
Opposite our friend Samuel’s was
the residence of the great Dr. Bland,
who afterwards gained a seat in the
first Parliament.
There were no other buildings
of importance till King-street was
reached.
At the corner of the street stood an
hotel which they called the “ Three
Legs of Man.”
About fifty yards round the King-
street corner was a small shop kept
by Anthony Hordern, grandfather
and great grandfather respectively of
the now famous firm, whose buildings
cover a big area of the Haymarket.
I used to be sent to the little shop
for groceries, and lagged behind many
a time larking with the young
Anthony of over seventy years of age.
The firstnamed A.H. afterwards
shifted to a larger establishment, the
situation of which I cannot recall
now. /
Turning back into Fitt-street, and
nearly opposite the hotel' with the
funny name, was a stationery shop
kept by a man named Bill N h,
who had been “sent out” for some-
thing.
Men were transported for such
small offences in those times that it
was not always a great offence to be a
convict. Many of our most respected
citizens of to-day are the descendants
of convicts. More power to them I
it would be the height of oaddishness
to reproach them. on that score. At
the seme time I lesi some reluctance
at giving the full names of men who
were known to be transported.
The wife of B.N. followed hint to
Australia, and subsequently succeeded
in getting Bill assigned to her as a
servant, when the stationery business
mentioned was opened in her name.
He afterwards accumulated great
wealth by dealing and gambling.
The goldfields broke out in ’5l, and
in ’53, Bill, who was a large gold-
buyer, was sentenced to twelve
months in Parramatta gaol for cheat-
ing a man out of bis weight.
Toogood’s hotel was the next place
of note in Pitt-street. There is, 1
understand, a bank there now. When
I first knew Toogood he was a cook
for the English bishop, Bishop
Broughton, On Potts’ Point Boad;
and before entering the hotel he kept
a refreshment r jom at the corner of
Oastlereagh and King-streets, near
Cosgrove's school.
At the corner of Market-street was
Green's hotel, known as the Orioketers’
Arms. I believe it is there still, and
bears the same name.
' Further along was a big willow
tree, behind which some years after-
wards was built the School of Arts.
Further along still was an hotel
kept by my. godfather, Bill Hill. He
was a brother to the well known
George Hill, afterwards Mayor of
Sydney.
At the corner of Bathurst and Pitt
streets was the Edinburgh Oastla
hotel—there still. It was afterwards
kept by a man named Tilarno, whom
I knew out on the Uerrigunowrie
station, on the Lachlan.
Pitt-street finished at the old pound
yard alluded to previously.
I have thus traversed down George-
street, and up Pitt-street Mighty
changes have taken place in those
thoroughfares since then.
Next, starting from the pound-yard,
where Paddy’s Markets now stand,
and making along Castlereagh-street,
towards King’s wharf, the first hotel
met with was the “Red Cow,” kept
by an uncle of mine, named Ruben
Annum. There are lots of Annums
about still. His daughter married
Edward Flood, afterwards a member
of Parliament.
Ruben Annum had a great orchard,
out at Cook’s river. His hotel, which
was situated at the corner of Castle-
reagh and Bathurst streets, was .built
back from the road, and subsequently
four shops were erected along the
front. These shops were called
“Louisa Terrace” (called after his
youngest daughter), which stands
there still.
On the opposite corner was a noted
butcher named Tom Wall, famous as
a cattle buyer.
At the corner of Park-street was
the Barley Mow Hotel, kept by
Widow McLeod.
Further down, on the opposite side,
was a pub, kept by a man named
Wyatt. His back yard ran out on to
the old racecourse—now Hyde Park.
This man afterwards built the Victoria
Theatre in Pitt-street.
Cosgrove’s school was the next
place of importance in the street.
The lane of offices next to the
Great Australia Hotel running down
between Gastlereagh and Pitt-streets
was, in those times, known as Brawn
place, a noted bad quarter.
There was nothing of much note in
Elizabeth-street. An hotel at the
corner of King-street was kept by
Dick Driver, father of the barrister.
The elder Driver was a great cricketer.
The Court-house stood in the same
place as to-day. ••
As 1 said before, Hyde Park was
then a racecourse. The military held
weekly reviews and practices there.
Flint guns were used.
The discovery of a bullet in St.
James’ church made h sensation, it
being considered that the bullot came,
from one of the muskets, and wise in>.
tended for an officer.
At the top end of Market-street was
a cricket ground, where the civilians
and soldiers used to do battle. I re-
member a great player named Mount
Clarkson—a very tall man. He kept
an hotel at the corner of Park and
Elizabeth-atreets, now Hyde Park
hotel.
On the park opposite Market-street
were the rope works.
The great horse-owner and racing
man, Charlie Roberts, also lived is
Elizabeth- ctreot.
, At the corner of Phillip and Hun-
ter-streets stood the Governor Burke
hotel—gone now.
In the park opposite Mount Clark-
son’s hotel the waterworks were after-
wards established, Watercarts backed
in there. No carts were run through
the streets, as in the luxurious modem
days; neither was there gas or sewer-
age.

Old Sydney.
In the'Easter of ’33 I remember a
terrible hurricane sweeping over
Sydney. The guard-house was blown
down, and many other places were
wrecked. The rain followed in a
deluge Nothing like it has been ex-
perienced since. There was no
sewerage system in operation, and
George and Pitt streets were one river.
All the cellars, of course, got filled.
Thousands of pounds of sugar and;
rice were destroyed, and the harbour
waters were nearly turned into treacle
with the inflow of black sugar (the
white stuff was never seen in those
days!). The destruction of property
and the loss of goods was tremendous.
During the storm three large boats
in the harbour got away from their
moorings, and were dashed to pieces.
For weeks afterwards we boys spent
our spare time searching along the
beaches for planks from the wrecks,
from which to get the copper and
make a few shillings by the sale of
same.
Some six months afterwards occurred
another exciting episode, when the
Jane Anne, lying at King’s wharf,
was blown up, through the careless-
ness of the steward going below deck
with a lighted candle, which ignited
some gunpowder. The vessel went to
atoms, and the side was blown out of
a yellow-painted hotel which stood on
the shore.
Having commenced a description of
Sydney in the thirties, and traced
George-street from the toll-bar gate,
near where Redfern station now
stands, right down to King’s wharf
(now Circular Quay). I will now
return towards that starting point via
the parallel thoroughfare, Fitt-street.
As I said before, there was a creek
between George and Pitt streets,
known as the Tanks, which got its
origin from a spring, up above the
post-office, and emptied into the water
at King’s wharf.
Leaving the wharf, and crossing
Bridge-street into Bligh-street, the
first item of note was a 4- foot stone 1
wall bounding one side of that street,
with gaps here and there, and stone
steps leading down to the ■ tanks.
Water being a luxury in those days,
the women used to bring their tubs
down to the Tanks and wash out the
clothes.
On the corner of Bligh and Hunter
streets, where now stands the “ S.M.
Herald ” office, was a little park.
Coming into Pitt-street, the first
place of note was the residence of
Samuel T y, who came to the
colony a convict. His back yard ran
down to the Tanks. He was then a
dealer, in which business he laid the
foundation of his subsequent great
wealth.
In the household of this man was a
trusted servant, who at last became
aware of the repository of his master’s
wealth. I am. not sure if Sydney
could boast of any banks in those
days and if it could, it is question-
able whether a man would have con-
sidered bis money safer in such an
institution than in his own home. At
any rate, the rich man I speak of
kept his hoard in some secret recep-
tacle in his Pitt-street residence, and
the trusted servant, discovering same,
got away with three or four hundred
golden guineas, which he placed in a
tea-kettle, and buried in the garden,
down near the bank of the creek. A
few of the coins, however, he made
into buttons by covering them with
doth. I suppose when the man
wanted to break a sovereign he would
cut oft a button! However, th 4 button
business at last led to the discovery of
the thief, for through the worn cover-
ing of one bis master, observing the
shining metal, got suspicious, and,
following up the clue, had the old
servant arrested.
' Whilst the accused occupied a
cell in the old gaol in lower George-
street, awaiting his trial, the turnkey
got very intimate with him. Pre-
tending to be his friend, he promised,
it the prisoner would disclose the
whereabouts of the stolen money, he
would plan an escape for him. Even
the gaoler himself made overtures,
and the old man, feeling that every-
thing was 0.K., consented to the ar-
rangement. So, one night the three

Old Sydney.
One morning, when I was about 6
years old, I was going across from
Woolloomooloo to King-street when
I met a man running across the brow
of Hyde Park. He seemed very ex-
cited, and was coming as bard as he
could run. He stopped near me and
said, “ Boy, don’t tell anyone you
have seen me.” He then hid in a
drain pipe. When I reached the top
of the hill I met two mounted police,
galloping in the direction of the
fugitive, who, it appears, had cracked
the skull of a warder in the back yard
of the police court, and effected his
escape. The police asked me did I
see a man running along. 1 said,
“No.” They never recaptured the
fellow. Behind where the hospital
now stands, in a creek running
through the domain, I afterwards
made the gruesome discovery of a
skeleton.
On another occasion, when proceed-
ing, along with some other boys,
down to Wooloomooloo Bay for a
bathe, observing a horrible smell, we
started an investigation which led to
the discovery in the creek of the de-
composed body of a man, afterwards
identified as Shannon, a shoemaker,
who had sold out his little business
for £2OO, intending to go for a trip
home. He was murdered for bis
money. Two men and a woman were
arrested on suspicion, tried, and ac-
quitted. They were arrested again,
and once more .tried and acquitted.
Ten years afterwards a man in the
Macquarie-street hospital confessed,
on his deathbed, to being concerned
in the deed, and simultaneously a
man on board a ship then going to
England, also confessed to the crime,
and was afterwards brought back to
Sydney, tried, and hanged.
Another sensational item I remem-
ber. I saw the coffins of the seven
men who were hanged in Sydney for
the murder of the blacks upon the
Monaro.
In Macquarie-street the first build-
ing next to the domain was the coun-
cil chambers, which, somewhat im-
proved, are now used as Parliament
House,
Next to it was, and is, the hospital.
What is now the mint was, in those
days, the soldiers’ hospital.
Next was Hyde Park barracks, the
depot for all convicts arriving in the
colony. The earliest superintendent
1 can remember was named Tim
Lane.
Some funny yarns used to be told
about Tim Lane, in connection with
the arrival of new batches of prison-
ers. The men would be lined up
before him for review.
“ Where did you come from ?” Tim
would say to each.
One would reply, “ From Cork 1”
“ Did you know me there ?”
“ I did.”
What was I ? ”
“A butter taster!”
The thought of being alluded to
as a “ butter taster ” would rile Tim,
and the man would get all kind of
threats.
The next man that came. from
Cork and remembered Tim there,
would be a bit more fly. “ And what
was I in Cork ? ” would be the query.
“ Shure, a butter merchant, Bor! ”
This man would have a' com-
paratively good time of it 1 ,
Tim had a beautiful daughter,
who used to go out and teach music.
One day she happened to go without
permission. On her return the
impetuous father, in his anger,
branded the girl. It broke her heart.
She went immediately to her room,
and never showed out alive.
The under-superintendent was
another “ Tim”—Tim Driscoll.
I remember St. Mary’s Cathedral
being erected in College-street.
In the little park near St. Mary’s,
1 once found the murdered body of a
blackfellow—one of the Broken Bay
tribe.
Where now stands the public
school in College-street was a little
round house, the residence of a man
named Brown, whose son, a mate of
mine, was apprenticed to the only
foundry in Sydney—Dawson’s—near
the bottom of George-street.
From that round-house to the corner
of Oxford-street was a vegetable
garden. The land is now occupied by
the Museum, King’s School, and a
row of doctors.
At the foot of William-street,
where now stands a blind asylum,
was a bridge over a creek. A wall of
the bridge is there still.
On one side of the street up to the
Domain was a brick wall, which
continued on the other side of the
street right up to Oxford-stieet, at the
corner of which an old woman, called
Mrs. Sims, lived. She was called
“The Witch.”
Near the bridge mentioned, where
I remember the road being formed, 1
have seen the men—the convicts—
drawing the hand-carts, whilst the
blood oozed out through their shirts
from the outs inflicted by the lashes
dealt out to them in the morning.
I remember also meeting an unfor-
tunate fellow being marched away
(in irons) to the flogging cells with
the blood dripping off him. He had
been engaged on the Darlinghurst
quarry, which was then a stockade,
and, in order to try and effect his
escape, had hidden in a drain. When
the roll was called for the men to go
back to the stockade, this man was
missed, whereupon a search was in-
stituted. The angry guards were
baffled, and the man might have
effected his escape if a comrade had
not put him away. When told that
the fugitive was secreted in a drain,
the soldiers went along the drain,
prodding through the cracks with
their bayonets. The poor wretch
stood a lot of prods, till his agonies at
last called-forth a groan, thus locating
his whereabouts. He was dragged
out and given fifty lashes on top of
his sores.
On another occasion a convict,
working near the stockade, tried to
escape by running into the bush, but
he was shot dead by one of the guards.
When shooting snipe along the
creek which ran through William-
street I discovered another murdered
body. This time it was a woman—a
very respectable looking woman, too.
She was never identified.
From the stockade down to the
water was a bush. There was only
one house, belonging to the Riley
estate, afterwards occupied by Bishop
Folding. I lived for a time in
Woolloomooloe, where, in the days I
speak of, there were only a iew
houses within an area of a ile and a
half; now it is one seething mass of
buildings.
Included in the area mentioned
were the residences of Colonel Snod-
grass (once Lieutenant-Governor),
Commissary Laidley, and Major Mit-
chell (the great explorer).
Going down the Potts Point Road
were the residences of Sheriff
McQuade (who afterwards shot him-
self), Captain Perry, and Tom Barker.
The residence of McClay, the
Chief-Secretary, stood on the brink of
Rushcutter’s Bay.
Leaving the point to come back to
William-street, the first house was
that of Mr. Potts, after whom the
point got its name. Next to .him,
Colonel. Shad ford, then the great
police magistrate; Colonel Wilson,
who used to have a bodyguard of
constables when driving about town;
next Major Grose, whose house was
afterwards occupied by Sir Henry
Farkes; then the old Chief-Justice,
Dowling.
We had no such luxuries as matches
in those days—had to use tinder and
flint. One morning, having no tinder,
I was sent to the house of a neigh-
bour named Allen, where two bull-
dogs got me down and worried me.
1 bear the marks of their fangs yet.
This episode took place in 1834,
In a hollow basin up at Surry Hills
£ remember a couple of men being
hanged on jibbets. The jibbets, like
the rest of the inhuman devices for
punishment, are now cast aside.
Before finishing the. description of
old Sydney, as far as the streets and
buildings are concerned, I might add
that there was an hotel in Kent-street
known as the ‘‘ Blue Beil,” kept by
my father at the time, and it was the
scene of my birth,' on 28th April,
1826.
And now 1 might mention some of
the prominent men of my early days,
in addition to those' already named in
connection . with scenes described
during the course of this narrative.
Dr, Lang—one of the best known
men in the history of the colony—l
knew personally. He was the most,
humane and benevolent man, in my
opinion, that ever came out. He had
a small kirk on Church Hill, nearly
opposite Petty’s hotel.
/The first parliamentary election
took place in ’43.
Mr. (afterwards Sir) Daniel Cooper’
was one of the most prominent men
of the day. He owned a flour mill
and a brewery, and was a kind-
hearted fellow. A committee was
formed by him to assist the poor
people. Anyo ie going- to his mill
with an order from the committee
could get for the sum of 2/1, a quarter
hundred of flour and a bottle of yeast.
This was a great help to the poor.
When Sir Daniel contested a seat
in the first election a four-horse
coach was engaged to drive round
town. It carried six young Aus-
tralians holding cornstalks in their
hands. One sat in front, holding a
spear, with a 41b loaf on the end,
symbolical of the benevolence of Sir
Daniel.
Sir Daniel afterwards built a big
mansion at Paddington, and when he
went to England the first time-
on which trip he was accorded his
knighthood, my father, Christopher
McGuire, was left in charge of the
residence.
I have cause to particularly remem-
ber that mansion, for it was here that
the death of my father took place,
whilst the wealthy Daniel was aivay
in England. Yes, one morning the
neighbours, noticing that the house
remained closed for some hours, and
thinking something may have gone
amiss, forced an entrance, and found
my father lying dead upon a sofa. An
inquiry being held, his death was
attributed to an apoplectic fit.
D’Arcy Wentworth, another member
of Parliament whose name is recorded
in history, 1 remember very well. He
had an estate out Ultimo way.
I remember hearing at the King-
street court a funny little passage-al-
arms between Mr. Wentworth and
another solicitor, named Williams,
who was a very little man.
Mr. Wentworth: “ I could put you
in my pocket, Mr. Williams 1”
Mr. Williams : “ Well, if you did,
you would have more law in your
pocket than you have in your head!”
There used to be a ball alley in
York-street. It had a 20-foot brick
wall, with two wings and a brick floor.
Handball was a favourite pastime in
those days. The ball alley came to a
sensational end, the wall falling. Two
lads were playing at the tim-. One
of them, a son of Walker, who -kept a
pub in Market-street, had his leg and
arm and back injured, and was a
cripple for life ; the other was killed.
The fall of the wall was attributed to
the foundation being weakened by a
very heavy rainfall. It was never re-
built.
(To be continued.)

Old Sydney.
Opposite the scene of that episode,
the famous Larry Foley, the fighting
man, alter wards kept an hotel. 1 am
not sure, but I think it was called the
Lyceum.
A great sporting friend of Foley’s
was Alex Long, whose father kept an
hotel in Market-street, down towards
the wharf. ,
And a great sport was the elder
Long a backer of horses and
boxing. Young Alex took after him,'
and was a conspicuous supporter of
Foley in his boxing bouts.
A riot took place in Sydney in the
forties. The sailors combined with
“cabbage-tree” mob and gave the
police a bad time of it.
The “ Cabbage-tree ” mob was the
cognomen for the larrikins, and their
distinguished dress was a Crimean,
shirt, moleskin trousers, and cabbage-
tree bat.
How the riot came about was this:
The parties mentioned had had several
brushes of a small nature, and dur-
ing one of them a sailor from H.M.S.
Sovereign, whilst on shore leave, was
killed in King-street by a foot police-
man.
On the day of the funeral, there
happened to be two man o’ war boats
in the harbour, on one of which was
a native apprentice, who made it up
with the sailors to combine with the
“Cabbage-tree” mob to give the
police a doing.
When the funeral was over the
combined mob turned their attention,
for a start, upon the No. 3 lock-up.
The police turned tail and fied, and
the mob broke open the lookup, bring-
out two prisoners from - the cells.
They had a mock trial of their own,
sentencing one to an hour in a cook
shop close by, to have a good feed,
and sending the other to a neighbour-
ing hotel to have a drink.
Next day they went to the women’s
lock-up, at the back of the old
soldiers’ barracks, shouting and yel-
ling, and generally making things
pretty lively. They soon cleared 1 the
police, aud a -.Toma'-i priaoiuat was
taken from her cell and liberated.
Then the mob proceeded along
George-street to the Central police
court, where the police from all parts
bad congregated in fear. The attempt
to get the police out of this was a
difficult one, for an iron wall sur-
rounded the building. In the mean-
while word had beeu sent to the mill*
tary barracks, and Captain O’Connell
was ordered to bring out the soldiers
to quell the rioters. The military
were marched on to the scene. Hun-
dreds of people had congregated in
addition to the rioters. The captain
called upon the crowd to disperse.
They hesitated, and the rioters only
added to the trouble. The captain
then called out to the women and
children to disperse, for he was about
to read the Riot Act. Those in-
clined for peace were given a fair
chance to get away; theif the order
came, “fix bayonets and charge!”
In double-quick time the military
charged, and the streets were soon
cleared. A few were knocked down
and hurt, but qene killed.
That night everything was quiet.
Next morning twelve of . the sailors
marched up George-street again, and
in front of the Central the police
made a sudden dash, and collared the
lot. The civil court could not deal
with the culprits, but they were taken
back to the ships and severely dealt
with.
No more riots took place lor years,
when, strange to say, the Sovereign,
coming to port once more, the sailors
and their old confederates, the
“ Cabbage-tree ” mob, were pitted
against each other,
I remember a great sensation at the
Belmore hotel, Haymarket, where
four soldiers refused to leave at shut-
up time, which resulted in a row, in
which the licensee killed one of the
soldiers, for which he was tried and
sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
1 knew Major Mitchell, the great
explorer, and had many a yarn with
him. 1 saw him starting out on his
first expedition in *33, and watched
his preparations with keen, boyish
interest. Included in the party were
ten or twelve “ lifers,” picked by the
Major from the Hyde Park convicts,
who, if they behaved themselves
creditably in the difficult undertaking,
were to be rewarded with their eman-
cipation. I knew Charles Hammond,
one of the party, very well.
The Major got his necessary para-
phernalia loaded on to bullock drays,
taking spare bullocks, and picking up
spare ones along the road for killing
purposes. He went through Bathurst,
Blackman’s Swamp, Wellington,
Dubbo, and down the unexplored
Bogan.
I have seen the tracks of Mitchell’s
party right down rfhe Bogan, past
where the town of Nyngan is now,
aud down as low as Emenah, com.
monly called the “ Murdering Stump,”
where Lee and Holder, from Bathurst,
bad their men killed by the blacks
when they went down to take up the
station. All but one of the men got
killed, and the escapee had a spear
run clean through him.
The wheel tracks of Mitchell’s
waggons were visible for many years;
and so were the blazed marks on the
trees. The track was known as “ the
explorers’ blazed tree line.”
I saw Mitchell on his return. All
the party came back. The men got
their freedom, and in addition, grants
of land from the Crown.
One of the party, John Strayhorn,
after a lapse of years, returned and
took up a block of land as a station
from the country the party bad ex.
plored. Mr. Strayhorn was there in
’7B, I know; and if he is not there
now, there may be some young Stray-
horns in possession.
One afternoon, as I was going
across the old racecourse in Sydney
(now Hyde Park), I noticed a police-
man driving a cart with a man’s foot
sticking out the back. Going up to
it, I asked the trooper what was the
matter, and he told me he bad
Donohoe, the bushranger, on board,
who had been shot dead. His body
was being taken to the Macquarie-
street hospital. On making inquiries
I found that Donohoe and his two
mates, Webber and Walmsley, had
had a fight with the police a few miles
out from Sydney. Donohoe stopped
a bullet; the other two got away.
They were arrested shortly afterwards,
v*hac-Walmelcy tarn«d Queen’s evi-
dence. Webber was hanged, and
Walmsley was made a foot policeman,
remaining in the force for some years.
Originally, of course, the three were
convicts. They had escaped from the
stockade, and had reigned on the
highway for a year or so, sticking up
squatters between Sydney and Goul-
burn.
I will now give an account of Dr.
Wardell, He was a magistrate, and
was considered a very severe man.
Two convicts, Jenkins and another,
whose name I forget, making their
escape fram the stockade, took to the
bush, and, not forgetting a severe
flogging they had suffered at the
orders of this magistrate, they decided
to have their revenge. Procuring an
old soldier’s musket, they went to Dr.
Wardell’s estate, some few miles out
on the Parramatta-road, and there
waited in ambush near the house.
When the doctor showed out, and the
opportunity was good, they shot him
dead. The occurrence caused a great
sensation. The men were afterwards
caught, tried, and hanged in the eld
George-street gaol.
A short time afterwards the hang-
ing of the first Australian native born
white took place. The name of the
victim was Joe Smith, a fine, able-
bodied fellow. 1 knewjhim well, and
was present in the King-street court
when the sentence was passed. His
mother was there, and the poor old
woman went into paroxysm? of grief.
In a drunken quarrel, it appears,
Smith had killed a man namod Bed-
hall (supposed to have been subse-
quently seen carrying two buckets of
water, and without a head; which was
the cause of frightening a lot of young
people). Smith, to baffle detection,
had out the,dead man’s head off with
a razor, and concealed the body and
head in two different places. But
having been seen with the man over-
night, he was arrested on suspicion,
whereupon he confessed to the crime.
In l-901there was a discovery of a
cavity at Lady Macquarie’s Chair,
which recalled to my mind a proposal
in the early days to found a fort there.
The work was started, but the idea
was abandoned, and I think the cavity
discovered must have been a part of
the excavations made at the time.
They built, instead, the fort battery
at the point between Circular Quay
and Farm Gove.
As I said before, the soldiers used
to practice from the shore of Wool-
loomooloo Bay, at a target out on the
water ; and I remember on one occa-
sion a man from Potts’ house,
when pulling in a boat from Potts’
Point across to Macquarie Point whilst
practice was on, received a bullet
wound in the arm.
Near where we used to bathe down
by the Old Fig-tree the parsons
carried on the baptismal ceremonies,
in sight of a large congregation of
spectators. I remember a practical
joker was nearly killed. He proposed
to swim round and pull the parson
into the water, but a stoce thrown by
someone on the bank struck the young
chap ou the forehead, suddenly ending
the joke, and nearly ending the joker
at the same time.
Most readers have heard something
about the “ Fisher’s Ghost ” episode.
There was a novel published about it.
I cannot say I have read it myself,
but I can give a good version of the
affair, for my mother and her sister
assisted in unravelling-the mystery.
The murder of Fisher took place about
eight years before I was born—about
the year 1818. My account of it,
therefore, is from information gleaned
from my mother.
My mother and my aunt (after,
wards Mrs. David Annum) were aged
respectively 12 and 10 at the time.
They were living with their father,
John Masterson, who was a black-
smith and farmer just out from Gamp-
belltown, on the road to Menangle,
and near the Sugarloaf hill.
I may say that my grandfather
Masterson was “ sent out ” here in
the historic year 1798, the year of the
Irish rebellion, for making pikes for
use in the rebellion. He was newly
married at the time, and his wife fol-
lowed him.
Fisher owned the adjoining farm.
He suddenly disappeared, and the bit
of land was in possession of another
man, who reported that Fisher had
sold him the farm, and had quietly
left for England, that for private
rasaons he bad kept dark his contem-
plated trip.
This story the neighbours began to
view with suspicion, for Fisher had
been an amiable, 'agreeable fellow,
and one not likely to suddenly and
mysteriously disappear like that.
TTo be continued.)

Fisher's Ghost (continued).
Id those days a fustian jacket and
trousers, oalf-skin waistcoat, check
shirt, and cabbage-tree hat were con-
sidered good dress. Only the wealthy
wore coats (“ swallow-tails”), but the
calf-skin waistcoat was common, and
was always considered necessary to a
neat attire. Fisher had a notably
nice waistcoat—a pretty spotted calf-
skin, which was generally admired ;
and some time after Fisher had gone,-
my mother and her stater one day
noticed this waistcoat worn by Fisher’s
successor to the farm, and recognised
it at once, which confirmed their sus-
picions that their old friend must
have met with foul play.
Just about the same time (so the
story goes) another of the neighbours,
whilst walking over a creek crossing
near Fisher’s old farm, saw Fisher—
or what he thought was Fisher-
sitting on the bridge railing.
He called out to him, “ Hullo,
Fisher, I thought you had gone to
England! ”
To his amazement, the supposed
Fisher suddenly glided away to a
waterhole and disappeared.
This timid man ran into Gamp-
belltown, and told his yarn to the
police.
Two constables came out, with a
black-fellow, who dived into the
waterbole and discovered the body,
six months after the disappearance.
The new owner of the farm was ar-
rested on suspicion, but he doggedly
maintained his innocence.
At his trial at the old King-street
court in Sydney my mother and her
sister gave evidence, identifying the
spotted waistcoat as Fisher’s pro-
perty, after which the prisoner made
a full confession. He had been
working for Fisher as a servant for
two or three years, and suddenly got
the idea of murdering his master and
claiming the farm as his own. He
“ did for ” him one night, dragging
the body to the waterhole and weight-
ing it with stones to keep it sunk.
He got his deserts on the gallows
in the George-street gaol.
My grandmother met with an un-
timely death in the same district in
’B5, at the farm of my uncle, David
Annam, a burning tree failing upon
her. She had with her a servant and
a baby of my aunt's. The hood was
cut off the baby’s head, but it was
not otherwise injured. A very narrow
escape for the baby I
First Overland Trip to. Victoria.
I will now tell you the experience of
my brother in an overland trip to
Victoria in ’36.
Melbourne was but a very small
place then—only a few houses.
My brother was engaged in a party
arranged by young Peter Snodgrass,
son of Colonel Snodgrass, and of
whom I bad something to say before.
The party, numbering ten, started
from Sydney with a dray and a dozen
horses, with the intention of making
a station somewhere in Victoria.
In those days there were no land
laws, and a man could squat down
anywhere. That accounts for the
origin of the term ‘‘ squatter.”
Mear Goulburn the party took
possession of some 800 head of cattle,
which Snodgrass had previously pur-
chased, and the adventurous journey
was continued.
There were only about twenty
houses in Goulburn.
Just about the same time Faithful,
of Goulburn, had sent a party over-
land to Melbourne with cattle, and
these two parties were actually the
very first to attempt the hazardous
undertaking. All but one of the
Goulburn lot were eventually killed
by the blacks, as I will relate.
Snodgrass’s party came through
where Yass now stands. It could
only boast of one pub and two. or
three houses then. No other towns
intervened until Wagga was reached,
where there was only one pub, on the
banks of the river.
They continued via where German-
ton now stands, reaching Albury,
which consisted then of a shanty, kept
by a man named Jack Brown.
The Murray was crossed at the old
fall, below where Captain Hovell and
Hume, the first to make the river,
left their marks on a tree—there yet.
The route then was through the
Chiltern and Wangaratta of to-day.
In front of them at this stage was
Faithful’s party, only one day ahead.
Now and then a man would ride from
camp to camp to ascertain how each
was faring.
While Snodgrass was spelling his
herd at Wangaratta, Faithful’s party
were camped at Glenrowan, at the
creek, where the Kelly’s gang of
bushrangers were afterwards shot.
It was at Glenrowan that the plucky
overlanders first met with trouble
from the blacks, who suddenly ap-
peared round the hill and surprised
Faithful’s party.
The men had arms, of course, but
were taken too much by surprise to
make any defence, and erery man in
camp was killed—speared or butchered
with stone tomahawks. The only
survivor was a man who had been
away watching the herd. He was re-
turning to camp when he discovered the
attack by the blacks, who also noticed
him. He fled, with the blacks in
pursuit. Unfortunately, he was on
foot. It was ten miles to the other
camp, on the river at Wangaratta;
and for that camp the man ran. He
was a good runner, and managed to
keep beyond range of the spears,
, Snodgrass’s camp was just on the
other side of the river at Wangaratta,
and it was near dusk when the fugi-
tive, with the blacks close behind him,
reached the river. He was challenged
by two of Snodgrass’s party on the
other side, who, armed with rifles,
wqre on sentry duty, .watching the
river. On answering in'the white
language, be was recognised at once
as one of Faithful’s party. Almost
simultaneously the two sentries ob-
served the blacks coming in haste to-
wards the river. As they reached the
bank, a couple of shots from the rifles
rang out, and the pursuers turned and
dispersed.
When the "escapee told what had
happened a consternation was caused
in Snodgrass’s camp, and all prepara-
tions were made tojstart for Glenrowan
at daylight next morning.
On arrival at the fatal spot it was
found that every man had been
hacked and cut to pieces with the stone
tomahawks. It was a frightful pic-
ture. Some of the horses and a
number of the cattle were also lying
dead. The dray and harness were
destroyed, as was also the flour and
sugar, for the blacks knew not the
value of these commodities in those
days.
Snodgrass’s party buried the dead
bodies of the men, gathered up the
remnants of the camp, lumped in the
cattle with their own herd, and pro-
ceeded on their expedition, the sur-
vivor accompanying them.
They went through what is now
Bens 11a, crossed the Broken river,
and travelled on till the Goulburn
Valley was reached. It did not bear
a name them, but now the Goulburn
Valley has the reputation of being the
richest land in Australia.
Here Snodgrass’s party halted, and
founded a station. (The distance on
to Melbourne, I think, was 60 miles,)
Mr. William. Faithful was then in
Melbourne, having gone round .from
Sydney by boat. His man went on
to Melbourne, and reported the sad
and sudden end to which his party
had come. '
I did not see nor hear anything of
my brother for thirty years after-
wards. We concluded he had been
killed by the blacks. But one day, to
my surprise, I got a letter from him.
This was in ’69, and he wrote from
the Goulburn river. I was out on
the Lachlan at the time, and made
up my mind to go over and see this
long-lost brother. Another brother
accompanied me. We found the
resurrected member of the family
mining on the Goulburn river. He
was the owner of a rich claim called
“ The Morning - Star Beef.” It
appears he had put in twenty years
on Mr. Snodgrass’s station, then
married and settled down upon a bit
of land of his own. He had also
been travelling backwards and for-
wards to Melbourne, carrying, with
teams.
This brother, who had the honor of
being in the first overland party, and
bad gone through some adventurous
experiences during his life, was, after
all, fated to meet a sudden end. He
was accidently shot dead at Germanton
in about the year ’B4, It was at a
shooting gallery of mine that the
accident took place. He happened to
cross the target when a well-known
jockey, Billy Bingwood, was shooting.
The bullet hit my brother in the eye,
penetrating his head, and killing him
instantly. He left one son. and one
daughter. The son is at present a
tinsmith at Narrandera, and the
daughter is living in Junee, Mrs.
Hurley.
Out to the Lachlan Again.
At the age of 15 years I once more
set out from Sydney to make my way
back to the Lachlan river. This was
in ’39,. and again I was on foot,
I passed where now is Prospect,
the waterworks from which the great
city of Sydney draws its supply; after
which, on the left-hand side of the
road to Penrith, I struck a pub kept
by one John Dean (better known as
Lumpy Dean),
Rope’s Creek—now called St. Marys
—was a one-pub place. Tbe inn was
afterwards in the hands of James
Landers.
Penrith had a dozen houses scat-
tered here and there. There was only
one hotel, kept by a man named
Perry. On the bank of the Nepean
river was a brick pub, of which one
Wilson was the landlord. This was
just by the punt., The punt crossed
where the great boat-races were sub-
sequently held.
The Emu Plains, commencing im-
mediately on fcthe other side of the
river, was a great place for cattle
buying; and butchers used to visit
there by the score.
Toby Ryan, afterwards a member
of Parliament, was a great cattle-
buyer. He afterwards built a beauti-
ful mansion beside the river. I also
remember Charlie York and a man
named Sullivan as great buyers. (A
few years after tbe trip through that
I am at present relating, 1 had tbe
pleasure of selling cattle to the three
mentioned.) v
I continued my tramp, and was soon
ascending the Lapstone Mountain.
On the top of the hill was tbe old
Pilgrim hotel, in connection with
which there is an episode I might
relate. One day there was a team of
five horses standing outside the hotel.
It belonged to Bobby Townsman, who
had stations at Mudgee and on the
Richmond; and on board the dray
was a load of wool, coming down
from the Mudgee station. The driver,
who had gone in for a refresher, had
remained in the bar. Now, if there
was anything which that driver liked
better than a glass of beer, it was an
unlimited number of glasses. At
any rate, he soon forgot all about the
team. Left to themselves, they made
a start on their own accord. Un-
heeded, they proceeded down the
mountain. The brakes had been left
on, of course, and were screwed up
sufficiently to steady the load. The
team plodded along, evidently at the
usual beat, and managed to negotiate
about half the descent, when they
came to a terrible grief. The scene
of the wreck was a deep gully, on
making round which the faithful old
horses had ventured too near the
edge. The bank slipped, and over
went the heavy load, pulling the
horses with it. It was a horrible
■mash. Every horse was killed, and
the dray completely wrecked. For a
long while afterwards the remains of
the horses could be seen hanging in
the trees. The driver of the team was
prosecuted for his neglect, and had to
serve three years’ imprisonment.
Near the Wentworth Falls (then
called the Blue Mountain Falls), now
a great pleasure resort, was a wayside
inn called the Weatherboard,
The next place I came .to was
Blaokheatb, at which is the famous
gorge known as Govett’s Leap. It is
only a few years, I understand, since
a track was cut down the leap. No
tourist goes along that way now with-
out paying a visit to this grand sight.
Blackheath, when I went along that
way, was a stockade for the convicts
(in charge of Colonel Bull, recently
demised) who were forming the road
over the mountain. Onb of the over-
seers, a man named Williams, was
brutally killed by a man who was
doing three years in irons. Williams,
it appears, had been, always torment-
ing tbe young fellow, who, driven to
desperation, resolved at last to “ do
lor ” Williams. He waited his oppor-
tunity. The chance soon came.
Whilst Williams was stooping down,
explaining to the convict what to do,
marking out the excavation, the latter
dug the pick into the overseer's skull,
killing him instantly. The, young
murderer gave himself up, and on the
gallows paid tbe penalty of his re-
venge. The spot where the murder
took place was on the eide of a steep
bill, which has ever since been known
as “ Williams’ Pinch;”
At the bridge near the top of Mount
Victoria there was another fatality,
the result of a quarrel. One Wiliiam
(Joliet, his wife, and a man named
Jaggers, had been travelling together.
Jaggers tried to get hold of Collet,
who ran away, whereupon he caught
the woman, killed her, and threw the
body under the bridge. The reason
for the dispute was never known.
Jaggers was hanged. ,■
Nothing further of any note oc-
curred till I got past Bathurst, to a
place called Summerhill, between
Bathurst and Orange, and about a
mile from the Lucknow diggings of
to-day. I was staying at a wayside,
inn, about two miles from the home-
stead of Captain Rane’s station,
known as Frederick’s Valley. Whilst
I was staying at this hotel, where I
had a job looking after milking cows,
a terrible murder was perpetrated at
Gyong, at an hotel I had passed six
miles back. The hotel was kept by
a man named Lock. One night, when
Lock was away, and there was no one
in the hotel but Mrs. Lock, an old
lame fellow they called Scotch Jack,
and the grpom and cook, seven men
came along and stuck the place up.
One man went into the kitchen and
bailed up the groom and cook; two
went in at the back door ; two in at
the side, tap-room door; and two at
the front door. Mrs. Lock was be-
hind the counter. They asked for
Lock, saying, “We want to shoot
him.” The frightened woman turned
to rush to her room, whereupon one
of the men put a bullet through her
head, blowing her bead nearly off.
The men immediately dispersed.
Over sixty years have now passed, and
the affair still remains a mystery.
Considering that seven men were con-
cerned in the murder, they must have ■.
stuck loyally to each other' for the
secret to be maintained.
An episode also occurred at the
hotel where I was working. A chap
named Capertee Dick was drinking
at the hotel, when in came an old
fellow, Joe Munns, who challenged
Dick about drinking the most rum,
for 10/. The money was put in the
publican’s hands, and the conditions
were that whoever fell down first was
to be the loser. The two men drank
away till Capertee Dick fell. The
drinks had been paid for as they were
got. McCabe, the landlord, thereupon
paid over the pound to Munns, who
walked away. McCabe then picked
Dick up, and dragged him into the
back bedroom, commonly called the
“ deadhouse,” and laid him on an old
straw bed. In the evening, after tea,
a few of us were sitting out at the
back of the hotel, trying to get a bit
of cool air, for the day had been very
warm. Amongst us was a little chap
called “ Billy the Magpie,” afterwards
a brother-in-law to Ben. Hall, the
bushranger. Billy was a great singer,
and had been obliging the company.
Between the songs and choruses we
could hear the heavy breathing of
Capertee Dick, in his drunken
sleep. As someone remarked, Dick
was driving the pigs- At about 10
o’clock little Billy, who lived a mile
away, 1 eft for home, when McCabe
said, “ Let’s see hew Dick is ! ” I
went into the room with him. McCabe
gied to wake Dick. No response,
e shook him, and rolled him, over.
“ I believe he’s dead! ” he exclaimed.
He told me to go and get a looking-
glass, which I did, McCabe held the
glass to Dick’s lips, and looked
eagerly at the glass. There was .not
the faintest mark of dew on it.
He therefore pronounced Dick dead.
A man was sent to Bathurst to re-
port the matter to the police. It was
right in the middle of summer, and
when I tell you it was seven days
before the coroner came along, you
can guess what a picnic we had. The
inquest and the cutting of the man up
for medical examination was too
gruesome to describe. I was called
in to hold the basin, while the doctor
| performed the postmortem. The
smell was too strong for ns. I laid
the basin down, and went out, but
was brought in again with a hand-
kerchief over my mouth. The verdic
was, “ Died from suffocation, cans."
unknown.” 8o ended the fooiislr_
wager as to who could drink the moa'
liquor.
(To be continued.)


7
The Great Flood.
Shortly afterwards 1 made tracks
over to the Lachlan.
I struck the Oarrawobbudy station,
below Forbes (where I had been be-
fore), and stayed a month.
One day Tom. Jones, the stockman,
when out after cattle to kill, found an
old man lying on the ground nearly
dead, at a spot known as Gunning
Gap, seven miles from Forbes. Tom.
galloped away to a waterhole, and
.brought the poor old chap some water
in a billy. We took the cattle to an
out part of the station, where a man
named Miller was camped in a hut,
and Miller and Jones went back for
the man. They got him up in front
of Jones, on the horse, but hadn’t
gone half a mile when the old fellow
died. On arrival at the hut, as I was
helping the body down off the horse,
the face of the dead man, with the
eyes wide open, bobbed into my own,
and nearly turned me queer. The
next day we cut some strips of bark,
lashed the. body between them, with
the aid of some greenhide, and buried
him on a sandhill.
Strange to say, twelve months after-
wards I was destined to sleep for
three nights on that grave whilst some
terrible floods were on. The Lachlan
was 30 miles wide, and this spot
formed an island amidst the vast sea
of water.
I had some exciting personal ex-
periences. It was in the year ’4l or
’42—l am not quite certain which.
I was at the time working for old Joe
Woodcock, who had a dairy. Twelve
months previously the river had run
for the first time—or the first time
known to the settlers. On that oc-
casion there had been a big rise, and
the water had got to the top of the
bank.
The big flood came down in the
month of November, and it came as
a surprise. For a week or two before
the sun had been shining beautifully,
and we had not the slightest idea of
what was in store. The first intima-
tion of the river’s little game was the
roaring noise as a wall cf water came
down.
In no time it was over ths bankc,
and we had to say good-bye to the
Carrowobbudy huts and make for
higher ground. Gathering up our
bedding and victuals and cooking
utensils, we made for the sandhill
before mentioned.
Our party consisted of three
men, one woman, myself, and
another boy. The man and
wife made a camp on a twin sandhill
close by ; the rest of us pitched our
bunks just over the old man’s grave.
Soon the waters got all round us,
and by dusk tho two hills wore out off
from each other, and made into two
islands. The watir was within 60
feet.
The other boy Joe Roahthorn, long
since dead, was heir to the Oarro-
wobbudy station. He and I were of
the same age—ls years., We were
both strong young chaps, and good
swimmers, and as we lay on that
dismal grave all the dark night, with
the roar of the torrents all around us
and the whack of the logs as they
bumped against the trees, we made
up our minds that, provided we were
not overwhelmed by the waters in the*
meantime, we would try and swim to
the Boogobbajil homestead, situated
on a hill five miles from our camp, and
about throe below Forbes. It was
the property of George Rankin, who
Was then living in Bathurst; and it
was being looked after by Mr. James
Twoddle and a stockman named John
Birmingham.
When the morning broke we found
the waters had got to within 20 feet
of us, and another two feet of rise
would mean the submerging of our
camp. Sticking to our determination
to swim to the place, we stripped off
everything, not even keeping our hats
on, for the habit amongst the natives
in those days was to wear our hair
down to the shoulders, and the hair
was as good as a hat.
We left the camp at sunrise, with
parting injunctions from the men and
shouts of “ Good luck!” from the man
and woman on the other island. They
had little fear for our safety, knowing
us to be like the proverbial duck in
the water.
We found it tough swimming up
against the current. Tacking about,
we, used to swim from tree to tree,
and we never struck Dottom once after
leaving the sand hill. The depth of
water must have ranged from tea to
twenty feet, but in places only the
tops of trees were discernible. Our
greatest dangers were the logs and
snags, from which we had a few nar-
row escapes. All day we battled.
By about 4 o’clock wo found we
had only accomplished a mile. _ Here
we were baffled by the strong current
of the Old Man Creek, It was a
matter of impossibility to cross, as we
were nearly exhausted. Finally we
abandoned the undertaking, and
struck out for the camp again.
It was no effort to get back. We
only had to float—the current did the
propelling. I can tell you, the corn
beef and damper went high after our
day’s fast and hard swimming, and
we slept that night as if we were
safely and comfortably ensconsed in a
feather bed.
Next morning I got one of the
men to help me cut a bark canoe, and
in it I left the camp on my own ac-
count to try and reach Bundaburra
station, which belonged to Mr. James
Collet, who also owned' Willong
station. , My eldest brother was work-
ing on Bundaburra. Mr. Josiah
Strickland was in charge.
It a gum canoe, cut from one
of the trees on the sandhill. I had
one paddle ; and, thus equipped, I
once more left our island.
By this time I could not tell where
the river was. I afterwards ascer-
tained that the water was thirty miles
wide.
I had not gone far on my journey
when I met Joe Miller, also in a
canoe. We both pulled up against a
tree to find out the news from each.
He was making down the river to a
new station he had taken up shortly
before that, called Guerin. With him
in the canoe were two black boys,
Joe told me that the folk were all
right at Bundaburra, but they were
camped on a very low sandhill, and if
the water rose another three feet they
would be washed off. 1 knew where
the sandhill was, and made for it.
Miller, I afterwards heard, reached
his station safely.
It took me h*]f a day . to paddle
five miles from our camp to fiunda-
burra sandhill. I found the party
still all right. They comprised my
brother, Mr. and Mrs. Strickland and
a child, and an African nigger.
- I remained ’with this party, and
when the waters had subsided suffi-
ciently we went to the Bundaburra
houses and huts. There 1 stayed for
a week, after which I walked to the t
station belonging to Mr. James Good-
win, who offered me a job. So I did
not trouble Woodcock’s dairy any
longer.
By degrees we got to know all the
news concerning the flood. From
Cowra down to the mouth of the river
there were only forty people all told,
including three women, and nine out
of the number were drowned, I knew
two of them. One of the unfortun-
ates was a stockman named Edward
Enock, who was driving fat cattle
bound for Bathurst when the flood
overtook him. Ho was a great
swimmer, too, hut a log rolled him
over. No doubt, he was stunned, or
he would not have got drowned.
On the opposite side of the river
was Mr. Jas. Twoddle, who after-
wards kept the Bridge hotel in Forbes.
He and a stockman called ‘ Little
Watty had some exciting experiences
with the flood. They also w>re out
with cattle. Within a mile of Tom
and Bill station (owned by Mr. D.
Campbell, afterwards purchased by
a rich Scotchman named Hamilton)
they came to a deep creek. They
had been driving along a ridge. In
trying to cross this creek, Watty and
his horse got washed away, and both
were drowned. Mr. Twoddle*also got
washed off his horse. He grabbed
at the flap of the saddle, which gave
way, and he had to strike out. He
swam to a tree, divested himself of
every stitch of clothing, so as to have
no incumbrance, and swam to the
ridge. He walked along the Tom
and Bill ridges till he came to the
Molyander ridges, six miles out from
the river, and made along this line in
the direction of Kangaroobie station,
then owned by Dr. Palmer, a Police
Magistrate of Bathurst. Within a
mile of the station he came to the hut
of a man named Dowd, who fixed him
up with flood and clothing. Twoddle
had been walking naked in the broil-
ing sun for four days, with nothing
to eat. He was blistered all over,
and was a wreck, as could be im-
agined. He stayed at Dowd’s till the
waters had subsided, by which time
he had a good rest. He then went
over to Mr. Sloan’s, 12 miles below
Cowra. I saw Mr. Twoddle hundreds
of times since.
The body of poor Watty was after-
wards found and buried on the Tom
and Bill ridge, at the corner of the
creek and the river. I .believe his
grave may be seen there to-day.
When the flood was properly gone,
I went out with Mr. Goodwin’s men
to gather weaners. For three days
we were at the game, and the mos-
quitoes were terrible. They were as
big as blow flies! We had to cover
our heads and out holes for our eyes
and mouths. A lot of weaners were
lost by the watery visitation, but we
managed to muster up about 150.
The remains of cattle and sheep were
hanging in the^trees.
Sheep were, very scarce in those
days. Mr. Grant, of Merringunowrie,
had a thousand—all washed away
and drowned.
Below this place, at a station called
Bindow, a big stack of hay was also
lost in the current.
When we got all the weaners to-
gether, we started for Mortrey, some
eight miles from where Grenfell now
stands.
Charlie the Convict.
A sensation occurred while 1 was at
Carrowobbudy station, which I nearly
overlooked. I will therefore go back
on my chronological order of events.
Time, about 1841! You will remember
the “ sticking up ” of Lock’s hotel.
One of the two men bailed up in the
kitchen on that occasion was a young
fellow named Charlie (commonly
alluded to as Lock’s Charlie). He
was an assigned servant, due for his
ticket of leave. I knew him well,
having made his acquaintance when I
was working at McCabe’s, six miles
distant, during which time I often
paid a visit to Lock’s. Charlie had
been transported from England for
some offence, for which he had to
serve for seven years as a Government
man, and he had been assigned to the
Gyong hotelkeeper. He was a very
decent young chap, and was liked by
everyone who knew him. Lock
thought a great lot of him.
In accordance with the custom
Charlie, for good conduct, was to get
ticket-o’-leave at the expiration of
four years; but, unfortunately, near
the approach of that happy freedom,
the young fellow and his master had
a row, which changed the course of
events for Charlie.
The row occurred one morning
about 12 months after the sticking-up.
Lock, in his anger, and unknown to
Charlie, sent immediately into Bath-
urst for the police; and about dusk
that evening a constable, known as
the Capertee Flogger, from Bathurst,
arrived at the hotel, and stopped for
the night. Next morning Charlie re-
ceived a terrible surprise when he was
handed over to “ The Flogger.” He
had not the faintest suspicion that the
presence of that official had specially
concerned him.
Poor Charlie went to his doom
quietly enough. He was broken-
hearted at the thoughts of what was
in store for him. He had never been
flogged before. And not only was ho
to get the lash, but he would have to
remain in bondage for another three
years to complete his full term of
seven years. To hand-cuff the prisoner
was considered unnecessary, and the
two journeyed on quietly towards
Bathurst. When they got within
two miles of Bathurst, between Evan’s
plains and the town, “ The Flogger”
proposed a smoko prior to going in.
The two sat down together on a log
beside the road (there were no cleared
roads in those days). The policeman,
not suspecting any danger from quiet
Charlie, carelessly laid his horse-pistol
down on the log. This was a tempta-
tion, and as Charlie smoked away,
thinking over the hardship of bis lot,
he made up his mind to use the oppor-
tunity to try and effect his escape.
All of a sudden Charlie made a grab
at the pistol. There was a struggle,
a report, and the “ bobby” lay dead.
Charlie made off through the bush.
That night he stole from a paddock
of Mr. John Livingstone’s (a small
squatter at Emu, Swamp, five miles'
from Gyong) a valuable racehorse
called Lean Jack—a well known
animal, for it bad appeared more than
once on the Bathurst course. He had
also sneaked a saddle and bridle from
the stable.
Charlie had plenty of friends round
about, so he was not hard pushed for
a bed; neither did he have any
trouble in obtaining a pistol.
He made back towards Lock’s pub,
and, doubling round the back way,
came up to the blacksmith shop at
the rear. There he found the black-
smith, and ordered him to shoe Lean
Jack.
In the meantime, of course, the
news of the murder had spread far
and wide. It was known at Look’s
hotel on the same evening, for word
had come up by the mail coach.
Whilst the horse was being shod,
Charlie saw three or four police ride
up to the hotel, and he stood over
the smith threatening to shoot him in
case of any treachery on his part.
When the shoes were all on, the
young outlaw paid the man, and,
getting into the saddle, galloped past
the front of the hotel, calling out to
the police, “ Here’s. Look’s Charlie,
it you can catch him !”
The police were in the bar, having
a drink. They rushed out, mounted
their horses, and followed in pursuit.
But the racehorse was too fleet of
foot. Charlie, too, was a great
rider.
He then made over to the Molong
district. There he was making a
call on a man who knew him, but as
he rode up towards the hut the owner
fired upon him. Charlie wheeled
Lean Jack round, and galloped away.
He had a bullet wound in the arm.
He next turned back for the Lach-
lan, and went down the river to a
station called Woolamundry. The
police got on his trail. Charlie saw
them approaching, and slipped out
the back. There was no chance of
getting away, so he secreted himself
behind a sheet of bark.
He heard the police call out to the
hut keeper, “ Are there any strange-rs
ho-?’’
“ Yes, a man has just gone out the
back.”
The officers rushed round, and had
little difficulty in finding the fugitive,
Charlie quietly gave himself up,
without causing any trouble, although
he was armed with two loaded horse-
pistols.
The police took more care of the
young convict this time. They lost .
no time in getting the “darbies” on
to his wrists, and securing him be-
yond possibility of any danger.
That night the party stayed at the
hut. Next morning the prisoner was
placed on Lean Jack, and was led up
the river towards Bathurst.
On their way they calfed at my hut
on Larrowobbudy station for a meal.
lat once recognised the prisoner. It
was 80 miles to Lock’s hotel, but I
■ had heard all about the murder of the
policeman. Naturally, I felt sorry
for the young fellow.
They all had a good feed of my
damper and corned beef, washed
down by some billy tea. Charlie'
complained of his arm being very
painful, He had been carrying the
wound for about a fortnight. The
bullet was in the fleshy part' of his
left arm, between . the elbow and the
shoulder. I washed out the wound,
which was a nasty one, and was be-
ginning to fester.
The trio then moved on, and subse-
quently reached Bathurst, where the
trial came on, and the death sentence
was passed for the murder of the
Capertee Flogger.
In due course the execution took
place in the Bathurst gaol. When
Charlie was asked on the scaffold if
he had anything to say, he made a
speech in which he blamed Lock, the
hotelkeeper, for all his trouble. At
the same time he cautioned all young
men against leading a bad life. “ Sea
what it has brought to me! ” he said.
The bolt was then drawn, and poor
Charlie met his fate.

Trouble Among the Blacks,
In my boyhood days I spent three
years amongst the wild blanks of the
Lachlan river, without seeing a white
person during the whole of that
period j so that I had almost become
one of themselves, I therefore had
an opportunity of picking up their
language, and acquiring a knowledge
of their customs.
I always got on very well with the
blacks till I was about 15 years old,
when an unfortunate incident oc-
curred, after which I lived in fear of
their revenge for a few years.
At the time I speak of—about sixty-
five years ago—l was on the Carra-
wobbudy station, cheese-making for
old Joe Woodcock. The station house
(or hut) was situated right on the
bank of the Lachlan, and on the other
side of the river was a camp of
six or seven gins and about forty
blackfellows. One of the gins, known
as Big Maria, who was the most
naturalised of the lot, used to come to
the hut to work and wash for Mrs.
Woodcock. She would never stay
over night, but would leave for her
camp at sundown. Sometimes the
other gins would come over for some
cheese-milk.
One day they called, and had a
drink, then clustered round the large
kitchen fire, beside which Mrs. Wood-
cock was sitting and doing some sew-
ing. The missus told them to clear
out. They could not understand that,
so she called me in to shift them. I
asked them, in their own language,
to get away back to their camp.
They still took no nbtice, but con-
tinued to sit by the fire. This annoyed
me, and, in my anger, I picked up a
fire shovel, filled it with ashes, and
scattered them over the naked bodies
of the wild gins. With yells of pain
they ran out, crossing to the other
side of the river. They' did not go
straight to their camp, but waited on
the bank—for what reason 1 did not
dream But I afterwards found out.
It appears they put the blame of my
cruet action'o i-to Big Maria. Maria,
they reckoned, was the cause of them
getting cleared out of the hut. And
so they were going to revenge them-
selves upon that innocent mortal.
Now every gin, in those days, car-
iod with her a stick for a weapon.
These sticks were seven or eight feet
long, of hard substance, such as myall,
sharpened at the point with the stone
tomahawk, and the point hardened in
the fire. Even Maria, who was to a
slight degree civilized, would never
come to our hut without her stick.
At sundown Maria left for the
camp, as usual. But no sooner had
she crossed the river than the rest of
the gins tackled her with their sticks.
They gave her a terrible beating.
She ran for the camp, and told her
blackfellow (husband) all about it.
His name was Beadie, a strapping
6-foot fellow of about 50 years, of
whom most of the male members of
the camp stood in awe.
Beadie proceeded to defend his gin,
whereupon the blackfellows belonging
to the rest of the gins took up the
row, and a big fight ensued. On the
side of Beadie were ranged bis two
brothers, Old Tinker and Jimmy
Field. The three men fared badly.
Beadie was killed with a spear. The
other two were left for dead, having
been battered on the heads with boon-
dies ; but they recovered.
These particulars I did not know
until next morning. I was riding by
the camp, in search of cattle, when I
noticed, on a sandhill, half a mile
away, the blackfellows congregated.
I turned into the camp to enquire the
cause. There I came across old
Tinker lying wounded. He ex-
plained everything. It was lucky for
me that I did not go over to the sand-
hill, as it happened. There they were
burying Beadie. The old black ad-
vised me to clear away, as I was the
cause of all the row, and they intended
to spear mo if they could.
I can tell you, I felt a bit scared
over this news, and lost no time in
getting back to the but. It was ad-
visable for me to get arms to protect
myself. With that object I rode
away to another station called Jimma.
long, owned by old William Cummins,
afterwards a member of Farliament-
There.l effected an exchange of a cow
for a gun—a flint-lock, single barrel.
I might say I did not know what
money was in those days—all my
transactions were on the exchange
principle. But I was rather unfor-
tunate with this gun. I had only had
it a day or two when young Joe
Rosthorn (the lad'l previously men-
tioned, who attempted, along with
me, the great swim when the Lachlan
was aflood) thought he would have a
pot at some crows. The gun was al-
ready loaded in case of emergency
with the blacks, Joe bad never fired
a shot before. Neither had I, for that
matter. I did not mind the other
chap trying his hand, but I was sorry
afterwards. Joe aimed, he pulled the
trigger ; the gun kicked ; he dropped
it; the crow flew away ; and my
gun lay on the ground broken into
two pieces !
Gun or no gun, I did not like the
environments of Oarrawobbudy after
old Tinker’s timely warning, so 1
made tracks.
* • * '*
About twelve months afterwards I
was on a station called Mortery,
on the Lachlan. And I was still very
scared about the blacks. I knew they
had me set. Word had been passed
round concerning the Carrawobbndy
affair. Old Joe, my hutkeeper, was
in the same boat as myself. He had
some narrow escapes, and carried on
his hand an ugly nullah-nullah
wound.
Old Joe had a gin called Mary
Anne, and was always dreading an
attack by the blacks in order to take
away his gin.. „
One evening a mob of about twenty
came along, and pitched their camp
a couple of hundred yards from the
hut. We thought it was U.P. that
time. Darkness came; still no trouble.
They were evidently waiting for a
night attack. - Old Joe resorted ' to
cunning strategy. There was a pro-
lific supply of pumpkins in the hut.
He got a large one, scooped it out,
cut three holes in the shell to repre-
sent two eyes and a mouth, put a
light inside it, and, sneaking over,
placed the affair on a stump about
fifty yards from where the blacks were
squatting around their fire. Ho got
buck to the hut unobserved; and
when the morning broke there was
not a black to be seen. They had
evidently caught a sight of Joe’s in-
genious invention and cleared. If
thrro was anything the blacks dreaded
it was the “ buggeen ” (the devil—the
only spirit they believed in); and I
doubt not that the camp was hastily
broken up that night at sight of our
“ buggeen.”
Shortly afterwards I left Mortery,
and went away to a station called
Wfaeogo, which I afterwards owned
myself. It was then in the
hands of a Tipperary man, named
John Walsh, who died years ago. It
was a large place, measuring 10 miles
by 7.
Three blacks came fo the house one
day. Ammgst them was old Tinker,
who had been nearly killed in the
Oarrawobbudy row. One of the other
two was Simon, a vicious fellow, who
had just murdered a white man, I
did nut relish their presence by any
means. There was something td be
done on another part of the run, so 1
made this an excuse to get away for
that night, at any rate. Taking a
black boy named Faddy with me, we
left the house. The inmates were
Mr. and Mrs. Walsh, three children,
and a man and a boy.
Our camp that night was pitched
about eight miles from the homestead.
We had turned our horses out, and
were proceeding to boil the quart pot
(there were, no pint pots in those
days), when up came the trio of black-
fellows.
Well, this about dumbfounded me.
They were after my scalp, for certain,
I thought. If not, then it was a re-
markably strange coincidence that
they should strike my camp, seeing
that I had left the but in order to be
on the safe side.
There was no getting Way, so I
boldly put on a good front by way of
bluff. I asked, in their own lan-
guage, where they were making to,
and ascertained that Lake Cowal was
their destination. And where were
they going to camp that night ? They
were going to camp with us! Great
Heavens, hero was a pretty go! I
got into a bit of a lather, I can tell
you, for everything pointed to the
probabilities of my being “ boondied ”
before another sunrise. Civility and
kindness might divert their object,
So I set to and played that part. I
got them round our fire, shared our
tucker, and gave them tea out of the
quart pots. This they relished, and
looked pleased with, after which I
whacked round all the tobacco I had,
to keep them chewihg, then sang
native songs, till at last the three
were fast asleep. To have stolen
away while they slept was more than
I dared try,' One great advantage I
had bad, they could not discuss any-
thing in the shape of killing me with-
out my hearing and thorougly under-
standing it.
Next morning, to my great joy and
relief, they went quietly along their
way.
In time the blacks forgot all about
the Carrawobbudy episode, but I had
almost despaired of ever getting into
their good graces again. However,
over three score years have since
passed away, and I have not yet
knocked under to the nullah nullah or
the spear.
The burial ceremony of -the blacks
is a peculiar custom. Immediately a
blackfellow dies, and before he hat
time to get cold and stiff, they force
his body into a sitting posture, with
both hands resting on his cheeks.
The bands are bound into that posi-
tion, and cords are passed round the
body to lash it into the posture re-
quired. Qis ’possum rug is then
rolled round him, and tied up. The
cords used to be made out of the
kurrajong bark, which the gins would
chew and plait. In fact, the gins
were quite experts at making lots of
things out of this bark.
When these preparations are com-
plete, two sticks are brought into use,
with which to make a sort of hand-
barrow. Across them the body is
placed, and carried to the nearest
sandhill. If a sandhill be not handy,
a soft piece of ground is looked for.
Then a grave is dug, to a depth of
say 18 inches by 3 feet square. Some-
times a hole is made circular. A
wooden shovel is used for digging
purposes.
The departed member of the tribe
is then placed in the hole, in his squat-
ting posture. All round, to a radius
of about 20 feet, the ground is loos-
ened, and the soil thrown over the
grave till there is a mound about two
feet above his head. The heap is
gradually sloped off. Sticks and dead
wood are then gathered up and placed
on top to prevent the native dogs from
getting at the carcase and dragging it
out.
When that part of the ceremony is
disposed of, three or four trees in the
vicinity are selected. The bark is
stripped off* to a length of about four
feet, and as wide as the trees will
allow, and on the bare parts of the
tree marks are made to correspond
with the marks on the dead man’s
’possum rug or cloak—for I might
say that each man’s rug is peculiarly
marked in order to signify its respec-
tive ownership.
Some fifteen or sixteen years ago I
discovered such a mrrked tree in
Junee. The marks on that tree are
still visible, and may be seen by any
eurious enquirer. The tree is situated
in Mr. J, Fasslow’s paddock, and I
would only be too glad to point it out
to anyone. If a search were made, it
would doubtless reveal the bones of
some buried black.
As a rule the blacks do not tarry
in a camp one moment longer tbau
they can possibly help after a death
has taken place. The gins never at-
tend the burial, but make all prepara-
tions for departure ; so that when the
men return from the funeral all is
about ready for an exodus.
Another peculiar custom in connec-
tion with a death is that a black,
fellow’s gin jobs her head with a sharp
instrument till the blood flows. She
then gets either white mud or pipe
clay, and daubs her face and hair
with it, also her body, down to her
waist, and her arms. This is their
mourning. The blacks whiten; the
whites blacken 1 The gins keep up
this mourning apparel for about
twelve months, which means.that it is
necessary to keep applying fresh
daubs now and then' as the old stuff
shakes off.
The gin also, before leaving the
camp, fires a bush, and drags it all
around, for the purpose of keeping
away the “ buggeen ” (the devil). It
is then twelve months before she can I
come anywhere near that camp again.
And if she, or any relative of the de-
ceased, cornea along after that period,
it is necessary to again drag a lighted
bush around.
Different customs apply to different
tribes, but the above relates to those
amongst whom I have gained my ex*
perience, namely, those along the'
Murray, Murrumbidgee, Lachlan,
Bogan, Macquarie, and fiarwon.
Another peculiar custom amongst
the aboriginals is the “ making ” of
the young men. A black was not a
properly-constituted “ young man ”
until he had gone through the cere-
mony. I will now describe that
ceremony. It was carried out on a
big scale from time to time, when all
the young men of the tribe were ' got
together and those from neighbouring
tribes also invited.
When all would be in readiness
there would be a great corroboree for
a start. The candidates would then
be singled out and taken away by a
couple of the old men from each tribe .
into a scrubby part of the bush. No
gins were allowed in this company,
and, as I said, only a few of the old
men.
A camp would be pitched for three
or four days. Here a circle, about *0
feet in diameter, would be dug. The
candidates would be placed in the
centre, and blindfolded.
One of the oldest blacks would then
come along, with a kangaroo bone,
ground fine, and a stone tomahawk.
Each candidate would be instructed
to open his mouth. The old master
of tbd ceremony would place the bone
against one of the centre teeth of the
upper jaw, and, striking the punch
with the. other implement, would
break off the tooth.
When all were served in this way,
the other old men would come along, .
and place round the foreheads of the
candidates a band, and another round
their waist. Pieces of bandicoot skin
—all previously prepared—are then
suspended from this belt to hide their
nakedness. The blindfolds are then
removed, but the ceremony is not
completed till each has a piece of
kangaroo bone placed through his
nose, to be left there. Up to thirty-
five years ago it was a rare thing to
see a blackfellow without the missing
tooth.
A return is then made towards the
old camp, but the “ young men” are
not allowed to go within 200 or 300
yards of the gins. The gins, in the
meantime, had prepared a separate
camp for them. And after the cere-
mony it was against the rules to see a
gin for another twelve months —though
the rules were frequently broken.
Another operation was to cut three
scars ou each arm, near the shoulder,
with a piece of broken quartz ; and,
whilst the cuts were ope isd and bleed-
ing, sand would. be rubbed in. In
time these cuts would form into lumps,
and such lumps were regarded as
beauty spots. The same was done on
the chest and back of the shoulder.
The more lumps > a blackfellow could
show, the more handsome he was con
sidexed by the gins.
(To be continued.)

Among the Blacks,
The marriage laws were very
eimple. Immediately a female child
was born, a blackfellow was picked
out as its future husband | and when
the child reached the age of 12 or 13
it was handed over to the chosen one.
The “bride” had no option but to
accept; to refuse meant death.
Most “ elderly ” blacks had two or
three gins, but never a young man.
If a blackfellow wanted a “divorce,”
he would simply give his gin away.
If a child under six months old
died, it was the custom for the mother
to carry the dead body with her for
twelve months. Rather a gruesome
custom! It was wrapt up in a
’possum cloak, put in a uet, and
carried over her shoulder. When
coming into camp the gin would hang
the concern on a tree close by. I had
often had a whiff, and had to clear
out!
This is not very dainty reading.
Indeed, it would not do to describe in
print lots of the customs of the abori-
gines. They are a degraded, filthy
race.
Some remarks on what the blacks
live on will perhaps be more pala-
table ! They are fond of all sorts of
game and vermin. Emus are re-
garded as a special luxury. So much
so that the old blacks play on the
superstition of the young fellows in
order to monopolise the emus for
themselves. They tell the young ’uns
that the flesh of these birds would
make them grey. Consequently the
latter would not touch them for, the
world.
The young blacks don’t mind catch-
ing the emus and handing them over
to the old warriors. The way the
birds are caught is this: Early in the
morning—the time the emus come out
to feed—three or four huntsmen go
out; and when they sight the game
in the distance, they cut a bush each,
which they carry in the left hand,
with a spear in the right hand, and a
couple of boomerangs in the belt.
They walk along the plain with the
bush in front of them, till they get
within a hundred yards of the emus.
Tha pace is then slackened, and they
approach so slowly that the movement
is hardly perceptible. The emus think
it a growing bush. They are de-
ceived when, within a few yards, the
bush suddenly drops and the spears
are hurled. The boomerangs are also
brought into use. The legs of the
captured game are then corded to-
gether, a long stick is procured, and
the huntsmen carry the birds between
them with the poll on their shoulders.
The kangaroos are captured in a
similar manner.
■ Catching swans was a different pro-
cess. If they found a swan on a lake
three or four men would conceal them-
selves at one end, whilst others would
sneak round to the opposite end and
make a noise. The swans would fiy
low down towards the concealed
blacks, when a shower of boomerangs
would fetch four or five out of the
mob. There was no superstition at-
tached to the swans; all ate them!
Eor cockatoos there was another
system again, . These birds, as a rule,
roost at night on the trees along a
creek. Trees are picked out, up
which some of the blacks climb. Other
members of the party start a mile up
or i down the creek and drive the
cockatoos along from tree to tree;
and as they alight in the beforemen-
tioned trees the concealed blacks belt
them down, 1 have seen as many as
fifty cockatoos brought back to the
camp at once.
For fishing, a net is used. The
mesh is made up from the inside of
the kurrajong bark, aud is attached
to a bent stick. The gins take part
in the fishing. Some handle the nets,
whilst others go round aud hunt the
fish out from amongst the logs and
snags. The nets are dragged along
the bottom, and the fish scooped out
on to the bank. At Gunning Gap
lagoon, near Forbes, I have seen
enough fish caught in this way to fill
a dray.
The blacks do not trouble about
scaling the fish when cooking ttiem.
They are simply buried holus-bolus
into the hot ashes. The same applies
to small birds. To cook a large bird,
a kangaroo, or, say, a bullock’s head
—which, by the bye, is one of their
luxuries—a hole is dug, and a fire
placed in ii, with stones, which be-
come red hot. The fire is scooped out,
the stones put back, and the game
thrown in. Rushes and grasses and
leaves are placed on top to prevent
being dirtied, and the ashes are thrown
over the lot.
Snakes are included in the black’s
list of dainties. As soon as a snake
is killed, his head is instantly chopped
off, before he can get a chance td bite
himself. For this reason a black will-
net eat a snake killed by a white.
The reptile is rolled up, skin and all,
and covered up in the red hot coals to
cook.
Getting honey is an interesting pro-
cess. The native Lee is as small as
the common fly. In summer time the
blacks walk along the edge of water-
holes, in search of the bees. They
find one sipping the water. Getting
a mouthful of water, they squirt over
him. This prevents the bee from
flying away. They coax it to crawl
on to a stick, then carry it away.
Procuring some eagle-hawk’s down,
and some pipe clay and a yam, they
set to work. With the aid of the
pipe clay a portion of the down is
worked up thin, like a pin. This
primitive pin is poked into the yam,
and the sticky stuff in the yam is used
as an adherent. Tne fluffy down is
then attached to the bee. When the
bee is dry enough to rise, it flies
away, and the blackfellow follows it
till the tree is found where the nest is
located. The portion of the tree
where the honey is, is then felled, and
with the aid of a coolamon (a bark
hollow vessel to hold water) the honey
is carried to the camp. The native
honey lies all loose, not, like the
English hive, all in cells. The wax
is in small balls, like marbles, and is
eaten by the blacks. Water is added
to the savoury dish, and the members
of the camp sit round and all dip from
the one receptacle.
Before the summer is over the
blacks gather enough gum from the
myall tree's to last them through the
winter. The gum is gathered into
kangaroo-skin bags, taken to the
camp, placed in a large coolamon, and
stirred and worked up till it is of the
consistency of thick hominy. It is
rolled - up into cue lump, and carried
from camp to camp.
For bread the blacks use the seed
of the kangaroo grass, which is
gathered in large quantities, ground
between flat stones, and baked in hot
coals.
They are very fond of grubs.
Grubs are equal to the roe of a fish.
They are quick at locating the ground
grub, which they draw from his hole
by means of a hooked stick. It is
roasted on the coals. *
They are also fond of the ’possum,
and do some great climbing to get
him. A hole big enough for the big
toe to get a grip in, cut with a stone
tomahawk, is the only assistance they
need to climb the largest tree. The
tree grub is located by means of the
sawdust he leaves behind when grub-
bing his way into the wood. This
grub is eaten alive.
Some of the larger kind of insects,
such as moths, are eaten the same
way, after pulling the wings off.
None of the marsupials are skinned
for cooking. The hair is roasted off.
If a rug or cloth or bag be wanted,
they skin.
There is never much difficulty about
making a fire, wet or fine weather.
A stick is obtained, and split. One
edge is trimmed until it is feathery.
Some dry grass is got from under a
log. The feathery stick is rubbed
till smoke rises; then some quick
rubs bring off a fine, lighted dust,
which ignites the dry grass. Many a
time I have made a fire that way my-
self ; and I would only be too pleased
to give any curious enquirer an ex-
hibition of the simple little process.
A black-tracker can distinguish the
difference between the footprints of a
blackfellow and gin. The former
turns his toes out, and leaves an im-
pression to correspond with the ball
of his foot; the gin is fiat-footed, and
turns her toes inwards
If a black gets sick, or gets hurt
by, say, a fall from a tree, he bleeds
himself in order to extract the bad
blood. Eucalyptus leaves are then
placed oyer the cut, and it is bandaged
up. He is generally all right in a
few days.
For internal pains they treat one-
another by sucking the bloed through
I the skin nearest the locality of the
pain. A piece of superstition is
sometimes worked in this way. 'lhe
man who is doing ihe doctoring slips
a pebble into his mouth, and, spitting
it out in front of the sick man,
persuades him it is drawn from his
body. This device is sometimes
successful—a kind of faithhealing 1
I may mention that several aborigi-
nals were subject to small pox. In
the early days several that I knew
were very much marked.
In dry weather, when water is
scarce, the oldest man in the tribe,
who generally carries with him a
piece of crystalised stone,' carefully
wrapped up, sneaks off and hides the
stone on the edge of a dry water hole,
He imagines that will bring rain.
The water is generally carried by
means of kangaroo-rat skin. The.
head and legs are cut off. Then it is
peeled off, leaving an opening at the
head. The tail end and legs are tied
up tightly. They stuff it full of grass
till it dries. When dry, they put a
little stick at top and bottom to keep
it in position.
Should a blackfellow go mad, he is
taken away from the camp and his
head knocked in with a nullah
nullah,
A blind man is left to himself,
with a supply of food. When it runs
out there is nothing but to starve to
death.
Early Station Life.
In the early thirties I was on Mr.
Walsh’s Wheogo station, on the
Lachlan. (I afterwards married Mr.
Walsh’s daughter). The cattle had
got away from the stockman. Mr.
Walsh handed over to me the job of
mustering, and off I went in the diffi-
cult search. Going on to the top of
Wheogo mountain, I got an extended
view of the plains. The only other.
landmark about was Porter’s Mount,
on a run owned by Mr. Rodd, and
afterwards by Mr. Gibson. Miles
away, on the myall plains, I got sight
of the missing stock. Returning to
the hut, I made preparations for a
trip after them. A big damper was
baked, and a supply of corn-junk
boiled, and, with the addition of some
tea and sugar to the swag, I set out
on horseback next morning, accom-
panied by a big kangaroo dog to
keep off the dingoes. Planting my
supplies in a tree on the edge of our
run, I brought the herd back in the
course of two or three trips. It was
during those travels that I came
across a human skeleton, whether of a
black or white I could not tell. As I
afterwards learnt, the difference be-
tween the two skulls is a joint in the
crown af the head. Subsequently I
got others to accompany me to the
scene of the find, and we came to the
conclusion the bones were those of a
hutkeeper named Paddy Larkins,
who had gone amissing from Gracka-
bol station a couple of years before.'
Another of the long list of early hands
who perished in the bush! Whilst
engaged in these mustering opera-
tions I used to make my camp under
the mountain, with a few bushes
around my head. I would have to
boil the pot before dark, so as to get
the fire out before the wild blacks
could discern the 'smoke and blaze.
The native dogs would scare me some-
what. They would come round in
hundreds, but my faithful old dog
kept guard over me. It is a dismal
experience, camped out in the wild
bush, with native dogs howling andi
wild blacks straying about!
Oft to Sydney Once More.
Not long afterwards we gathered a
hundred bead of fat cattle and set off
for Sydney. We passed through Oar-
coar apd Bathurst, Piper’s Flat and
Wallerawang, turning off near Hart-
ley to the back road under Mount
York ; and in due course I was once
more back in my old haunts in the
town of Sydney.
One occurrence on the trip down I
might mention. Near Mount York
lived a farmer named Patrick Hop-
kins, whose son James used to keep
the Union Club hotel in Junee, and
later became hotelkeeper at W&gg*.
On the road by Mr. Hopkins’s a dead
beast had been left by some drovers,
who were only two days ahead of us.
It was a pleura Deast, and Mr. Hop-
kins came out to burn it in order that
bis own cattle might not catch the
complaint. During the operation a
spark from a burning leaf fell on the
old gentleman’s arm, and in a few
days he was dead. I once heard
James Hopkins telling in his own bar
an account of his father’s death, and
you may guess he was rather surprised
when I chipped in and confirmed the
tale, adding that I was present at the
occurrence.
I will not say much this time about
Sydney as I saw it on that trip,
which was about the year ’4O or ’4l.
I put up at the old Square and Com-
pass.
One other item I might mention
was a visit to the hotel in Castlereagh-.
street kept by old Mr. Aaron. It w«s
a great inn for the country people.
Joseph Aaron, a son of the proprietor,
who has a station near Wellington,
was recently introduced to the Duke
of York. When the Duke visited
these 'shores as a boy his staff en-
joyed a visit to the Wellington station.
When I was first married I held my
wedding at the White Horse Hotel at
Bathurst, which was then kept by
young Joe Aaron.
I only stayed a fortnight in Sydney.
Exploring the Bland.
Shortly after my return to the
Lachlan, I remember an exploring
party set out in search of new country
to squat upon. The party consisted
of young Stewart, a nephew of
General Stewart, once a Lieutenant-
Governor, who afterwards built a
beautiful mansion at Mount Pleasant;
Willie Gardiner, a Scotchman; Jim
Graham, a big burly man, who owned,
at the time, Morangorell station, now
the property of the McGregors; and a
blackfellow named Jacky Nerang.
They started out through where
now is Barmedman, then the furthest
place known, and which was a station,
taken up by Mr. John Cartwright, a
son of Rev. Cartwright, formerly of
Goulburn.
They went on by the present
Wyalong, and ran the Humbug Creek
down to where Merringreen station
is now. Leaving the creek, they
struck across to Rankin’s Springs,
afterwards so-called.
Between there and Hay they got
short of water, and had to shoot one
of the horses and drink its blood.
The salty blood was not too good for
them. Then another horse had to
go, and so on, until the four horses
were shot. .Next the tucker became
exhausted, and the party were in a
sad plight.
By this time they were endeavouring
to make back to civilization once
more. At last Stewart caved in and
dropped. He could not travel a foot
further. The other three pushed on,
but a few hours later Gardiner also
threw up the sponge. Graham, the
fat man, held out a little longer, and
down be went. The black was the
toughest member of the quad, and he
pushed on. He knew the Humbug
Creek was not far off. At length he
reached it, and, after quenching his
parched throat, he set out with a
supply of water to the rescue of the
others. He found Graham, and re-
vived him, and the two went back for
Gardiner, whom they also found.
There was still some water left, and
they made all haste to try aud get to
Stewart. They found the place where
they had left hhn, but Stewart was
gone, nor could they trace him.
Nothing was ever heard of poor
Stewart afterwards, but ten or twelve
years later bones were discovered
which were thought to be his.
The sorry-looking trio got back to
their homes all right. Gardiner, died
some years afterwards—l think it was
'66' Graham sold out and went home
to the old lands; and the blackfellow’s
death I also remember. There are
residents still on the Bland who could
confirm this story.
(To be continued.)

Some Ugly Customers.
I’ll never forget a big fight I once
had whilst all alone in a hut on a
station near Forbes. Coming across
the plain towards my hut I spied a
wild looking black. He was fully
equipped—spear, waddy, boomerang,
tomahawk, and shield—and was a
strapping big fellow of about fire-and-
twonty years, a formidable-looking
•pponent if he was after an encounter
with me, as I was only a stripling at
the time.
As he approached I barred up my
door. He came straight for the hut,
and gave the door a belt with hid
tomahawk.
“Hullo, what do you want?”,l
called out from the inside, in his own
language.
The answer came that be wanted
bread. I told him I had none.
He reckoned I was only gammon.
I assured him I had none, and,
furthermore told him if he did not go
away, I’d shoot him. With that I
poked through one of the portholes an
old. soldier’s musket that had been
loaded for about twelve months. As
I did so, the black suddenly brought
his tomahawk down on the barrel and
nicked it. Fortunately for me, he got
away just as suddenly.
I saw the same black afterwards at
Parkes, in the year ’64, and the influ-
ences of civilization had made great
improvements in him. I reminded
him of the episode at the hut, and he
replied, “ \es, me ’member it, but me
wild beggar then 1 ”
On the same station a few months
afterwards the stockman and I were
killing a fat bullock when up came a
great big blackfellow, known as
Tommy Gowal, after whom Lake
Cowal was called.
Tommy always had a number- of
dogs. The aboriginal, as a rule, is
very fond of dogs, and he would
sooner have you hit him than hurt his
dog.
Well, as I said, Tommy was at the
killing-yard with all his'dogs, and you
may guess they were a bit of a nui-
sance. I kicked one of the crew,
whereupon Tommy’s wrath rose, and
I can tell you I had to do some fast
laps round the yard with him after
me, brandishing his nullah nullah. A
stockman —a big fellow named Torkie
—bluffed the black by threatening to
kill him with an axe; and only for
Yorkie, I’d have been a gone coon
that time. As an additional induce-
ment to cool him down we gave
Tommy the paunch and head of the
bullock, and he went quietly away to
his camp,
But Tommy was a terrible fellow.
He was always having a row some-
where, and had already killed two or
three whites. Both black and whites
stood in. awe of him. One day the
blacks tackled him in numbers, and
ended the outlaw. He got so many
spears into him that he could not fall
to the ground the spears propped
him up, 1 witnessed the fight myself.
We tried in vain to save Tommy, but
perhaps it is as well we failed, for
after his death the atmosphere smelt a
bit safer.
Another trip to Sydney.
I was still on Mr. Walsh’s Wheogo
station, on the Lachlan, when (in the
year ’49) I had another trip to Sydney
with cattle. It was a trip characterised
by misfortunes.
In the first place, whilst we were
gathering up the cattle, an incident
took place which was doubtless an
omen of bad luck for our trip. Three
of us were engaged in the mustering
operations—old Mr. Walsh, myself,
and a stockman named Dave Baton.
We had to camp one night in a hut
on the edge of an adjoining station,
Grackabol, owned by Mr. Gibson.'
The three of us slept in a row, with
the saddles for pillows. The old man
was in the middle. On rising in the
morning we found a big brown snake
coiled up right under the saddle on
which the old man had had his bead.
During the night his reptileship must
have crawled over Baton or me in
order to take up the position he did.
How we all escaped a bite is a mys-
tery.
■ Well, we got the cattle home. There
were about 800 bead altogether. The
country was beginning to look dry.
In fact, there was every appearance
of a drought coming on. We decided
to get rid of 50 out of the mob. .Pick,
ing out that number, Mr. Walsh and
I set out to drove them to Sydney.
Nothing eventful happened till we
got to Mount York, near Hartley, at
the foot of the Blue Mountains. Here
our bad' luck commenced. We were
camped at the hut of a settler named
Scott, giving the stock a day’s rest ere
facing the climb over the mountains,
which were reported to be very scarce
of feed.
The old man (Ur. Walsh) was sit-
ting in the kitcnen talking to the
settler’s wife, when there came a great
crash of thunder and a flash of light-
ning. The latter must have affected
the old man, for he took sick immedi-
ately afterwards and continued bad
all night. In the morning he did not
look at all well. However, he would
persist in going on with the stock.
We started off. After doing about
7 miles we reached the Blackbeath
hotel, then kept by George Bloods-
worth. As we were passing the old
convict stockade a little further on, I
noticed the old man reeling in his
saddle, as if he would fall, so I raced
up to him. He said he was very bad,
and he kept looking back towards the
pub. I suggested taking him back,
and he consented.
After -seeing that he was put to
bed, and arranging for his care and
also for that of the horse, I started
back for the cattle to take them on
alone.
Further on I fell in with a footman
named Bill Daw, a well-known second-
rate fighting man, who afterwards
fought a big battle with “ The
Stranger” on the Turon diggings, and
was beaten.; 1 engaged Daw to help
me with my mob as far as the Emu
Plains, where I paid him off.
I tried to sell to the butchers at the
Plains, but the best offer I could get
was 10/- per head. This will give an
idea of the price of the cattle at that
particular time.
Not caring to do business at the
price, and in the hopes of doing better
in Sydney, I pushed on. To make a
long s‘ory short, I at last had them
boiled down at Hinchie’s boiling-
down establishment near. Campbell-
town, cl os >to Sydney. They averaged
only 8/1 per head.
I went into town, and stayed a
fortnight, putting up this time at
Aitkenhead’s Eum Inn, on the top
of Brickfield Hill, an old rendezvous
about which I had something to say
in an early part of my narrative.'
Once more making back for the
Lachlan, I found, when I got as far
as Blackhealth, that the old man was
still at Bloodworth’s Inn. And he
was worse. He could neither speak
nor walk. He was paralysed. The
bill against me was £l4. Paid up
the reckoning, and engaged a horse
and cart and a man to drive the
patient to Bathurst. We stopped
there a day or two, at Joe Aaron’s
White Horse hotel. A brother-in-
law of mine named John Bird (re-
siding on the Lachlan, and married
to my sister), who bad also been on a
trip to Sydney, there overtook us on
his return, and in bis dray the old man
was made as comfortable as possible
and carted back to Wheogo. For
months he could not walk. But he
never got properly right, and died
about eight years afterwards.
A Terrible Drought.
In September of ’49 we began to
feel the effects of the dry weather,
and had to prepare for a drought.
There was no water to be got between
the Lachlan and the Mutrumbidge,
and both those rivers were a succes-
sion of wa’erboles. Everyone had
to leave the stations and pitch camp
on the rivers, or on the creeks near
the rivers. All the Bland was aband-
oned. Lake Cowal was as dry as a
floor. We used to ride forty miles
out from the river to rescue cattle
from hanging about the creeks.. For
six or seven days they would be with-
out a drink : then, when they came
into water, they would drink that
much that they would flop down and
couldn’t rise again. .
We bad to keep a team of bullocks
to pull the fallen beasts out of the
holes. I did nothing else but go up
and down the creeks looking after
them. Some would have to be stuck
with a knife to put them out of their
misery. On one occasion I had a
long search after a beast that I could
hear bellowing, but could not see.
At last I came across it. There was
only his mouth risible; the rest of it
was buried in the bog.
In a small hole in Owen Greek, on
the road to Grenfell, I counted thirty
head of cattle and two horses. Out
of the lot a horse, a bull, and a cow
were my own property.
The drought did not break till
April ’5l. It had not rained for 12
months. Before it set in I had 400
cattle of my own ; and Mr. Walsh had
800; after the break-up I could only
muster 500 between us.
Mr. Hamilton, a rich Scotchman
on another station, and whom I men-
tioned before, only recovered 600 out
of 2,000.
Amongst the stations abandoned on
the Bland were—Chisholm’s, “ Gro-
gan”; Caldwell’s, “Moonbucca”;
McGregor’s, “ Morangorell” ; White’s,
“ Curraburrima ’’; John Cartwright’s
(afterwards Fred. Chisholm’s); Cart-
wright’s new station at Barmodman ;
and Gibson’s Bland station.
Down on the Billabong, close to
Lake Cowall, there were four stations
whose four huts were built in the ad-
jacent four corners, within balf-a-mile
of each other, for purposes of pro-
tection from the blacks. These were
likewise deserted. The owners were
Stonestreet (John Highland in
charge), William Atkins (T. Godfrey
in charge), John Hodd (John Bird in
charge), and John Trott (self in
charge), Mr. Trott was afterwards
an alderman in Parramatta, I believe,
but lam not sure if the great cric-
keter is a son of the Mr. Trott men-
tioned.
Strange to say, two big pigs left
behind on the Billabong by the
Atkins were found six months after-
wards, still alive.
Amongst others deserted were The
Wheogo, where I was. We removed
to the Pinnacle, within twenty miles
of Forbes, then owned by Thomas
Hull, We only lasted a month there,
when the water ran out, and we re-
moved to Mr. Hamilton’s Boyd
station, 10 miles from the Lachlan.
There we remained till the break-
up of the drought.
Good Seasons and Gold Fever.
We had a run of good seasons after
the drought, but a lot of the squatters
never financially recovered from its
effects.
The gold diggings broke out in ’5l.
I think it was in the month of May
that the great rush took place to the
Ophir field, near Orange. I was still
on Whoogo. Pretty well everyone
got the fever. I took a run over to
Ophir to have a look. It was a great
sight to see the miners for miles along
the creek.
The system of winning the gold in
those early days was mostly by
scraping the rocks and crevices and
cradling. There was no proper system
of digging. It was all fossicking.
The miners each had to pay aii 1 a
month license fee to the Government.
In order to collect the fees, commis-
sioners were appointed. These com-
missioners, accompanied by the police,
would travel up and down the creek
to see that each man had his license.
If any persisted in working without
the necessary license he was locked
up.
They didn’t all pay up the license!
Not a little bit 1 It was amusing to
see the men dodging the commis-
sioners. As the officials would come
along, word would be passed on, and
the unlicensed individuals would re-
tire into the bush till the coast was
clear again. The signal was “To-
ho ”! From man to man it would
pass along the creek, at the rats of 10
miles in 5 minutes.
Romance —Elopement !
Tbe gold fever did not get a proper
hold of me. I had a lot of stock at
home, on the Wheogo, and they were
worth looking after, seeing that their
value, had suddenly risen from 15/-
to £l6. Moreover there was a little
romance back on the station which
had for me a magnetic attraction
stronger than the gold dust and
yellow boys.
Shortly afterwards I fell out with
the old place—fell out with tbe second
Mrs. Walsh. I did so purposely
(for a blind), and took up my quarters
on the adjoining run, Mr. Hull’s
Pinnacle Station. From there I
used to secretly visit Wheogo. I was
courting the eldest step-daughter. A
distant relative came into the swim,
and used to arrange matters for me.
How to manage the marriage was
the next question. Gathering up
some of my stock, I took them over to
Bathurst, and made a handsome deal.
I then bought the necessary wedding
wardrobe for both my affianced and
myself. Beturning to the Pinnacle, I
get a spare horse, and a black boy to
lead it. We made for Wheogo, and
near the house I camped that night,
in a pine scrub. I’ll never forget
that night. We were nearly eaten
with mosquitoes. My distant relative
joined me in the scrub, and we put
our heads together to concoct plans
for an elopement. Later on he re*,
turned from the house, and reported
all was in readiness for an exit on the.
following morning.
At daybreak the young lady
i'oined me, and we got away safely.
left the black boy at the Pinnacle.
We lovers rode 60 miles that day,
and were accommodated for the night
at Bindo, a station then owned by a
mutual friend. Next day we reached
Garcoar, another 50 odd miles, and,
on the third day. Bathurst. We
were married by Dean Grant, and the
wedding breakfast was spread at
Aaron’s hotel.
There was a great to-do over
the affair. Before the honeymoon
was over, the stepmother, who bad set
out on a search immediately she had
missed the daughter, managed to find
us, and there was a big scene, which I
will not attempt to describe.
It was six months ere the storm
blew over. In the meantime I had
still been living at the Pinnacle,
But afterwards things came out all
right again. I took my bride back to
Wheogo. Mr. Walsh restored me to
the management of the station, and,
as the books say, we lived happily
afterwards.
(To be continued.)


11
The Old Squatting Days.
“ Six months after I was married
I bought from my brother-in-law,
John Bird/ a station on the Billabong,
below Farkes, 10 miles from Forbes.
In area it was about 5 miles by 7.
It would doubtless, interest readers
to learn—if they are not already
aware of it—the conditions under
which such a tract of land was /ao.
quired in those days. Well, my
brother-in-law had taken it up under
lease from the Grown. His term of
lease was 15 years. He had occupied
it only 12 months when it was trans-
ferred to me. I had only to pay £lO
per year, plus an assessment of three
pence per head on cattle, which also
went into the public revenue. We
did not bother about fencing. The
four boundary corners were marked
out by a commissioner. If the stock
intermingled, no one much cared—at
mustering time we could sort them
out again.
I only stuck to my station for a
year, then sold out to Mr. P. Strick-
land, of Bundaburra—stock and
lease—for £l,lOO.
My reason for selling was this:
Adjoining Wheogo there was some
land available which I had an idea I-
could get. 1 bought 300 head of
cattle' from Bill Toungman, a stock-
man on Mortery. Bill, by the bye,
was the father of a celebrated fat girl
3 feet high, and 14 stone weight, and
12 years old, who was publicly ex-
hibited in Australia, and died on her
passage to the old country, where
she was being taken for exhibition.
But before I could carry out my
plans as to the new station, I found it
necessary to go to Sydney. • The rail-
way only reached as far as Parramatta.
It might also be added that third-
class carriages were included in the
trains. These carriages consisted of
open trucks.
We stopped in Sydney 12 months
altogether, half, of which time I was
under the care of Dr. Gwynne, of
Parramatta.
The few years between this time
and the bushranging days were com-
paratively uneventful. For a while I
had a butchering business in the
main-street at Batburst. Then took
up the Sandy Greek station, adjoining
Wheogo.
Now I am coming to the bushrang-
ing era, and my exciting experiences
during those troublesome times in
the history of the colony.
Bushranging.
The bushranging days commenced
in the year 1860. I was then the
proprietor of Sandy Creek station,'
lying between the Lachlan and the
Bland, and adjoining the well-known
Wheogo station, then held by the
widow of my father-in-law, Mr. John
Walsh. The nearest town to me was
Forbes, 80 miles. Lambing Flat
(now Young) was 50 miles away.
Other towns which have sprung up in
the neighbourhood since are Grenfell,
18 miles distant ; Marsden, 20; and
Barmedman, 40.
Readers will readily understand
that I ought to know a bit about the
bushrangers, when I say that I was in
the unfortunate position of having
been arrested on suspicion of being
concerned in the celebrated Eugowra
escort robbery, on the highway be-
tween Forbes and Orange, which I
will fully describe later on, together
with the particulars of my arrest (in
1862) and my experiences whilst lying
imprisoned in various gaols during the
nine months which elapsed ere 1 was
able to at last prove my innocence.
Most of the information which 1 will
give was gleaned from the bush-
rangers themselves. I personally
knew the following notorious men:
Frank Gardiner, Johnny Davis, John
Gilbert, “ Black Pat ” (Connors),
Johnny McGuiness, Johnny O’Meally,
Ben. Hall (who was married to my
wife’s sister, and had a station adjoin-
ing me), Daniel O , John Bow,
Alexander Fordyce, Harry Manns,
Johnny Vane, Jack Bourke, Jimmy
Dunleavy, Patsey Daley, and “ Old
Jim ” (the laat-named’s proper cogno-
men I did not know, but he bad done
altogether about 45 years in prison,
the last time of his arrest being at
Wallacetown, between Junee and
Wagga, by young trooper Batty and
trooper Geo. Nicholls), 1 also knew
Johnny Dunn, as a boy, on a station
near Binalong, when he was breaking-
in ponies for Dr. Harris, but I never
actually came across him after he
11 took to the road,” though 1 will be
able to tell about his exploits.
The men who were concerned in the
Eugowra. escort business were Hall,
O’Meally, C—; ,' Manns, Bow, and
Fordyce. I was arrested, with four
other innocent men,'whom I will name
when I come to the proper description
of the episode. Much of my informa-
tion was gathered whilst a fellow-
prisoner with the culprits themselves.
The first man I will attempt to deal
with is Frank Gardiner, whose proper
name was Frank Christie. He
carried several aliases, such as
“ Darkie,” “ Clarke,” and “ Dawsee,”
but was best known amongst his bush-
ranging companions as “ The Darkie.”
Gardiner is described as the
“ Father of Bushranging” and .the
“ King of the Boad.” His name at
the time he was “ out ” was a terror
to travellers. He was probably the
greatest highwayman that the colony
ever produced, and was responsible
for leading a lot of young men astray,
amongst them my own brother-in-
law, Ben Hall, who afterwards step-
ped into the shoes of his tutor and led
a reckless gang.
I first knew Gardiner in ’57, when
he was a ticket-o’-leave man about
the Weddin Mountains, where he used
to be “ duffing ” fat cattle and taking
them to the Snowy diggings.
In those days each ticket-o’-leave
man had to reside in the particular
district stipulated on hjb ticket, and to
produce it any time when called upon
by the police or magistrates. Furtner-
more, he bad to report himself to the
officials once every three months,
otherwise he was liable to be looked
up. Persistent breaches of this rule
meant that the offender would be
sent to gaol to complete his original
sentence.
Frank Gardiner (for that is the
name by which 1 always addressed
him) belonged to the Carcoar district.
His usual haunts on the 'Weddin
Mountains (where, by the bye, the
elder O’Meally had a station), were
certainly out of his district.
The Carcoar police had a good idea
that Gardiner was a constant breaker
of the ticket-o’-leave regulations, but,
‘‘The Darkie” was too slippery a
customer fja the troopers to oatoh
“out-o’-bounds,” However, suspi-
cions as to bis cattle-duffing and horse-
stealing proclivities at length led to a
determined effort on-the part of the
police to arrest him, of which I will
tell you in due time.
As to Gardiner’s early history, from
what 1 heard from his own lips, and
from what I have been able to ascer-
tain, it is this: He was a native of
the Goulburn district, being born at
Boro Greek, in 1830. Evidently from
a lad he was a wild ’un. When not
more than 20, after serving as a bar-
man in the Goulburn hotel, he went
over to the Victorian side, where, so
he told me, he got into several scrapes
over horses and cattle, and had to do
a short time in the Fentridge stockade.
I understand he did not do his full
time there, but escaped.
He came back to his old haunts,
about the head of the Fish River, and,
though wanted on the Victorian side,
managed to keep his freedom for a
few years, although he stuck to the
old game of duffing. During this
time he mostly lived with a man
named Bill Fogg.
He came to grief again in'’s4, the
particulars of which were told to me
by Gardiner himself. He had
“ lifted ” a horse from somewhere out
on the Fish river, and took him into
Yass to sell in the public saleyards.
Now, as it happened, the horse be-
longed to the chief constable at Yass,
who, recognising his old steed in the
yards, quietly waited by till the sale
took place, then arrested Gardiner,
who was afterwards tried in Goulburn
and sentenced to seven years on
Cockatoo Island.
A short time after he was put on
the island he tried to make his es-
cape. He attempted to swim to the
shore, but the sentry heard him splash
into the water, and gave the alarm,
A boat was lowered,- and Gardiner
was brought hack to terra firma—and
“ terra cella.”
The extra punishment for his at-
tempted escape quietened him down
a lot; and from that out he behaved
in such an exemplary manner that he
was granted his ticket after serving
little more than half the time. He
was, as I explained before, sent to the
Carcoar district.
1 On the first occasion that the young
“ Cockatoo man ” bad to report him-
self to the Carcoar officials he inquired
if a man named Fogg (bis old com-
panion) was still living at the Fish
river, and he was answered in the
affirmative, but told that he could not
visit Fogg; to do so would mean going
out of '■ his district,” and thus offend-
ing against the laws. However, he
soon started offending, and went so
far as to open a butcher shop in
partnership with Fogg on Spring
Creek, near Lambing Flat. But the
“ duffing ” of cattle for slaughtering
purposes made the. country too hot
for him, and he had to retreat once
more into the recesses of the bush.
, The police got an idea he was living'
at Fogg’s farm, and Sergeant Middle-
ton and Trooper Hosie, from Tuena,
went there in search of him. They
rode up to the front of the house, and
Fogg came out.
“Is Gardiner heref” asked the
Sergeant. “ I am here ! ” called out
Gardiner himself from a skillion room
at the back, “ but I’ll be d—— if you
will take me.”
With that the troopers dismounted,
hung their horses up, and both went
into the front room. ■
No one was in the room, but,
through a curtain which did duty as
a door between it and the adjoining
room, came a salute from Gardiner’s
revolver. The bullet did not, how-
ever, take -effect.
Middleton at once fired at the cur-
tain, then rushed for the room, but a
second bullet from Gardiner hit the
Sergeant in the mouth, staggering,
but not disabling, him.
Gardiner theh came out. Neither
man had a loaded cartridge left. They
closed, and fought like two tigers,
Gardiner using the butt end of his
revolver, and Middleton his hammer-
headed whip.
As to Trooper Hosie (according to
the evidence afterwards given at
Carcoar, when Fogg was acquitted on
a charge against him in connection
with the affray), he was supposed to
have been knocked unconscious with
a bullet from Gardiner in - an early
stage of the fight. The official evi-
dence represented that he recovered,'
and that with his assistance, Gardiner
■was scoured and handcuffed, Fogg
urging Gardiner to surrender; that
Middleton left the prisoner in Hosie’s
charge whilst he rode to Bigga for
medical attendance for his ugly wound,
and to send back assistance; that'
Hosie, after the Sergeant left, got
Fogg to procure a horse on which to
take Gardiner along; and that on the
road two armed men released
Gardiner.
It was early on the following morn-
ing that I happened to be making
over to Wheogo to see about some-
thing, when, on a pine ridge near the
house, I came across a man standing
behind a tree, I at once recognised
him as Frank Gardiner.
“ Hullo, Frank!” says I. “ What’s
up ? ” for I noticed he was terribly out
and hacked about the face.
“ Ob, I have had a terrible fight,”
was his reply, “ and I am pretty well
done for. I shot Middleton at Fogg’s
yesterday.”
To make a long story short, I may
say he then proceeded to tell me about
the affair. His version did not tally
altogether with the above. Indeed, I
would not care to put into print all he
told me.
He had ridden over during the
night—a distance of 70 miles—and
the horse which carried him was then
feeding in a little paddock not far
away.
I went on to the house and told the
Walsh family all about the affray. It
created a consternation. • We had
never been altogether pleased to see
Gardiner round our way, for he was a
wild, reckless beggar, and that be
would bring trouble some day was
only in accordance with the general
prediction of the settlers. Now that
he had bad a set-to with the police,
and they had tasted his powder, he
was a more dangerous customer than
ever. It was likely, at any rate, that
he would not stop at taking human
life.
I hurried back to my own place
(Sandy Creek station, adjoining
Wheogo), then on to Ben. Hall, whose
place also adjoined me. (To those
who have not followed up my narra-
tive I might say that Ben. and I
married two sisters, the daughters of
Mr. John Walsh, ef Wheogo, then
deceased.)
Whatever Ben’s after-career was,
he could certainly not be charged, at
that particular juncture, with being
partial to the presence of Oardiner in
the neighbourhood. Indeed, he joined
me in wishing “The Darkle” far
away.
Next morning three mounted police
from Obwra, accompanied by a black*
tracker, came up to my house, and
asked what 1 knew concerning the
whereabouts, of Gardiner. They bad
called at Ben. Hall’s en route, and
Ben. sent them on to me, 1 gave all
the information I possibly could, and,
furthermore, accompanied them over
to the little paddock in which Gardiner
had put his horse. The horse—a roan
animal—was still there, but Gardiner
was not to be seen.
The police retreated into ambush to
watch the horse, in the expectation, of
catching Gardiner by that means.
They stuck to their' watch till night-
fall, but no sign of Gardiner.
After dark Ben. and I went over to
where the police were camped, taking
them some tucker.
Next morning the horse was gone.
Gardiner must have got him away
under cover of the darkness.
From that out no traces of the
hunted man could be found, and we
all thought he must have got clean
away out of the country altogether.
“£l7O Reward I”
This was the heading which ap-
peared to nu advertisement in the
“Police Gazette” of January, 1862,
which read as follows :
“ One hundred and seventy pounds
reward. Attacking and wounding the
patrol with firearms, Bathurst district.
On the 16th July last Sergeant
Middleton and Trooper Hosie, of
Western patrol, were attacked and
severely wounded, at the Fish Biver,
by Francis Clark, alias Jones, alias
Christie, a ticket-o’-leave holder, ille-
gally at large from his district; native
of Goulburn, New South Wales; 31
years of age, 6ft B£in high, a laborer,
dark, sallow complexion, black hair,
brown eyes, small raised scar in left
eyebrow, small scar on right chin,

round scar on left elbow joint, two
slight scars on back of left thumb,
short fingor nails, round scar on cap
of right knee, hairy legs ; wounded in
the above affray on left temple by
pistol-ball or whip. He was captured,
and afterwards released by two armed
men of the following description:—
John Peisley, a ticket-o’-leave holder,
illegally at large from his district, a
native of Bathurst, New South Wales,
laborer, about 28 years of age, about
sft lOin high, stout and well-made

toned up the front, large gold chain,
cabbage-tree hat, and duck coat ;
sometimes wears a dark wig, and
always carries a brace of revolvers.
He was in Sydney seme weeks ago,
in company, it is supposed, with
Zahan, alias Herring, of the Aber-
crombie. The other man is about 28
years of age, and about 6ft 6in high,
light hair and whiskers, and small
light moustache, sallow complexion.
A reward of £2O is offered for
Gardiner’s apprehension, and £5O
will be paid by the Government to
any person who may, within six
months from the present date, give
such information as shall lead to the
apprehension and conviction of the
said John Peisley, and £6O will be
paid for the apprehension and convic-
tion of each of the other offenders.”
* * * *
Six months after the affair with the
police T walked into the Wbeogo
kitchen one morning, when, to my
surprise, there was Gardiner, eoolly
standing with his back to the fire.
“Hullo, Frank!” says I. “You
back again I”
I felt a bit queerish, I can tell you,
not knowing but what he might send
a bullet through me for putting him
away to the police after the last time
we met. However, he exhibited no
animosity towards me; on the other
hand, he spoke up in a very friendly
sort of way, and u reply to my ques-
; tions told me what he had been doing
' with himself in the meantime.
(To be continued.)

Gardiner as a Parson.
It appears Gardiner had seen the
pi lice on his track tbe day before he
was hiding in the Wheogo scrub,
and made off, Beturning after dark,
he managed to sneak his horse from
the paddock without disturbing the
officials, and quietly got away. He
then rode iff to Adelaide, where he
led a quiet life, travelling about in
the disguise of a minister of the
Gospel—a role which, to my mind,
would not have been difficult for him,
for he was a man of good education
and address and gentlemanly appear-
ance generally.
However, the wild fever attacked
hi™ once more. He got sick of the
quietude of the “Holy City,” and
decided to return to his old district
to allay his thirst for adventure and
excitement.
On the road between Lambing Flat
and Forbes there then followed a
string of highway episodes which I
will relate in due course.
“The Three Jacks.”
The next man to turn out on the
roads was Johnny Davis. What led
to his choice of an evil course was
this.
Young O’Meally, whom I will tell
you of when his turn comes, stole a
horse from me, and gave it to Davis
to take to Cowra to sell. He sold it.
But I had offered a reward for the
horse, and that subsequently led to
the arrest of Davis, who was commit-
ted for trial at Bathurst. The trial
duly came off, but the jury could not
agree. The case was put back for
another session, accused being granted
bail. But, instead of appearing when
called upon, Davis had taken to the
bush. He was joined by two men—
Jack Connors (known as “Black
Pat ” ) and Johnny McGuinness.
“ Tbe Three Jacks ! ” the trio were
known by. After a run of about six
months, they were broken up in a
successful attack by Inspector Sander-
son (later a Superintendent at
Bathurst) and Pat Lyons, at the
Burrangung Creek, on the road be-
tween Grenfell and tbe Flat (Young).
The police had come along by
coach, and when nearing a shanty on
the roadside they noticed tbe three •
men leave the building and run across I
the creek.
The police went in pursuit and fired
a couple of shots without effect.
Davis turned and stood his ground,
and returned the fire, but his two
mates deserted him.
After several shots had been ex-
changed, tbe ringleader was secured.
He had three bullet wounds in the
legs, and Lyons bad one finger blown
off.
The prisoner was taken to Goul-
burn, and there tried, found guilty,
and sentenced to death. The sentence
was commuted to “life imprisonment.”
He did three years in irons, but on
account of his health failing, and be-
ing a cripple (from the bullet wounds)
things were afterwards made some-
what easier for him. I think he
obtained his freedom after twelve
years ; but what ultimately became of
him I have never been able to ascer-
tain.
As to the other two, they separated.
McGuinnes made for Lake Cowal,
where be was shot dead by a black-
fellow named pilot, for which service
to the country Pilot was given the
position of a black-tracker for Her
Majesty’s Government,
The exact future of “ Black Pat ”
was always an uncertainty, but an
episode which I will give later on
to my mind throws some light upon
the question.
But this I do know—that Gardiner
afterwards came across “ Black Fat,”
and upbraided him for his treachery
in deserting Davis when the three
were attacked by the police.
“ You are a nice bushranger ! ”
aays the “King of the Hoad” to.
“Pat ” “ Where are your firearms?”
“ In my swag,” says “ Pat.”
“ And that is a nice place for
a bushranger to carry his firearms !
What would you do if the police came
upon you ? ” '
To this the trembling “ Pat ” could
make no reply.
“For two pins I’d shoot you!”
aays Gardiner. And I believe he
would have cone so only that the
conversation took place within gun-
shot distance from Jamieson’s house.
However, Gardiner made “ Black
Pat” strip off his clothing, with the
exception of bis shirt, boots, and hat,
and told him to go.
“ And if ever I drop across you
again, I’ll shoot you, you cowardly
dog to go and desert your mates.”
The unhappy “ Pat” was in a
dilemma as he shuffled off. But not
long afterwards be came across a boy
on horseback—a boy whom he knew,
and one who was inclined to be a wild
’un himself. The lad went home and
sneaked a coat and trousers of bis
father’s, and returned with the bundle
for “ Pat’s” benefit.
No sooner had “ Pal” restored him-
self to decency once more than he
collared the horse from the boy and
galloped off. And after that “ Pat”
became quite an unknown quantity
altogether.
The boy, I might say, took to the
roads himself, tor which he afterwards
did ten years, but I will not disclose
his name, for he subsequently became
a peaceful citizen in a country town
not a long way distant from Junee.
Months afterwards I happened one
day, whilst riding into Forbes, to
notice a lot of crows in the bush, not
far from the road, so I turned off my
track to satisfy my curiosity. To my
horror I found the dead body of a
man. It was perfectly naked, and
very much decomposed—beyond iden-
tification. I noticed a bullet wound
through the side of the body,
I went on to Forbes, which was
only seven miles from the spot, and
reported the matter to'the police, who
came out and buried the body just
where they found it, without much
ceremony or any other bother as to an
inquest either.
My impression is that the body was
none other than that of “ Black Fat,”
and that he was shot by Gardiner.
Everything seemed to point to the
conclusion that “ Pal” once more
crossed the path of the “ King of the
Bead,” and that the latter had no
compunction in carrying out his
former threat to shoot him dead.
Ben Hall.
Having introdvcnd Frank Gar-
diner, and disposed of “The Three
Jacks,” the next man I will turn my
attention to is Ben. Hall
It was owing to the influence of
Gardiner that Ben. “ took to the
road.”
The various accounts of this notori*
ous bushranger have all been more or
less unreliable. But none knew him
better than I. He was my nearest
neighbour. Our two stations ad-
joined, only a mile separating our
domiciles. Furthermore, he was my
brother-in-law, and, as an interested
party, I watched his career from the
time he “ went wrong” till his tragic
and awful death at the hands of the
police, when they poured a countless
number of bullets into his body at a
spot on the Billabong, 10 miles from
Forbes, in the month of May, 1865.
But, in introducing Ben. Hall, I
might go back somewhat and deal
with his father and family.
. Old Ben. Hall came out to Aus-
tralia, and settled in the Murrurundi
district, where young Ben, first saw
the light of day in the year ’37.
In about ’46 the old man got into
trouble for horsestealing. He was
committed for trial; and whilst out
on bail, he absconded, and came over
to the Lachlan Levels, under the
assumed name of Jack Binding.
Then he obtained a situation on the
Uar station, owned by George Ean-,
kin, of Bathurst. His job was to
look after heifers.
He jogged along the even tenor of
his way for about 12 months, when,
one afternoon, up rode two troopers,
I forget their names now, but one of
the two was mostly known by the
name of “ Pretty Boy,” on account of
his face being very much pock-
marked. They hobbled their horses
out, and awaited “Jack’s” evening
return to the hut.
On coming home, and finding.the
troopers there, Jack got his young
stock into the yards, then brought
the officers up to the but, gave them
their supper, and made them welcome
for the night, not, suspecting that their
mission was a search for Ben Hall.
Next morning they had their break-
fast, the troopers got their horses
ready, and “Jack” himself had let
the slip panels down, and was about
to attend to his usual routine.
“ Well, good morn in?, lads!” says
“ Jack,” as he was about to climb into
bis saddle; ‘‘l’ll have to be getting
away with my heifers.”
“ Wait a bit,” says “ Pretty Boy,”
at the same time drawing a horse-
pistol and levelling it at “Jack’s”
head. “ Tou cannot go, Ben Hall;
wo want you.”
“ Oh, you are making some mistake
this time,” says “ Jack,” with a laugh,
trying to come the bluff. “ My name’s
Jack Binding.”
“ Well, Jack Binding or Ban Hall
—its all the same; we’ll take you
anyway, and chance the mistake.”
And so they slipped the “ darbies ”
on his wrist, ordered 1 im up on his
own horse, and escorted him away to
Bathurst, from whence he was taken
back to Murrurundi for trial on the
old charge.
In the meantime, however, old
Ben’s prosecutor had died, and the
principal witness, who was a relative,
having made himself scarce, “ acci-
dentally for the occasion,” Ben
managed luckily to obtain his
freedom. '
He rejoined his family, who still
occupied the old farm on the Page
river (in the Murrurundi district),
and afterwards sold out and started
(accompanied by the family) back for
the Lachlan.
The family consisted of himself and
wife, and five children, in the follow-
ing order:—Ben, Ned, Billy, Polly
(afterwards married to Bill Wright,
“ The Magpie ”), and Kate. The
girls were fine-looking.
The old man managed to regain bis
former situation at Uar, and the
family took up their abode at the hut
before mentioned.
Toung Ben took a situation as
stockman for Mr. Hamilton, at Boyd
station, about twelve miles from
Wheogo, and about twelve miles
from where Forbes now stands. He
was a great hand amongst stock, and
a splendid rider.
There was a noted outlaw of a horse
on Boyd called “ Slasher,” which the
young stockman undertook to break
in, but whilst mounting him one
morning “ Slasher ” let out a “ lasher,”
and poor Ben’s leg and the hoof met,
resulting in a bad “smasher” for the
former.
There was not a doctor nearer than
Carcoar, 100 miles away, but a young
chap named Tom Higgins, on Bunda-
burra, who had a reputation as an
amateur bush surgeon, was got over,
and he set the fracture, making a good
job of it, too. In nine or ten weeks
Ben was able to get about on crutches,
and after that he was soon as lively
as ever.
He then got a billet, stockkeeping
at Omah station, which belonged to a
great racing man in Sydney named
Tate.
I shall never forget a shaking up I
afterwards got myself from a horse.
It was about the year ’6l. A mining
reef at the Pinnacle was then being
worked, and yours truly had an in-
terest in the concern. The town of
Forbes bad opened, and I used to
proceed thither to obtain any sup-
plies necessary for the mine, Ben
mostly accompanied me on those trips.
And it was on one of the return
journeys that my accident happened.
There were three of us in the party on
this occasion. We stayed rather late
in town, aud it was fairly dark by the
time we got on to the road. And
what must wo do but get racing.
I was riding a young horse which bad
not been properly mouthed, and he
ran me into the head of a tree, killing
himself, and nearly doing ditto for
me. My jaw was smashed, and my
mouth split nearly to one ear.
It appears I lay there all night,
unconscious. The mates could do
nothing for me, so they rode on to
John Green’s pub, at Uar’ to get a
cart. When I regained conscious-
ness, it was 10 o’clock next morning,
and I was being carted into Forbes.
There a doctor patched me up as well
as he could| but the marks 1 carry
yet.
But to return to the Halls:
As to old Ben, he had left the dis-
trict five or six years before, going
back once more to the Murrurundi,
and taking with him all the family
barring Ben and Bill and the married
daughter Polly. I will say no more
about the old man till later on, when
I propose to give my version of whom
the characters were in that interesting
bnshranging fiction and drama, Bolfe
Bolder wood’s "Bobbery Under Arms.”
There are various opinions as to the
real personalities of “ Starlight,” the
two “ Marstons,” and old “ Ben Mar-
ston,” and I propose to show that
“ Starlight ” was none other than
Gardiner, that “ Ben Marston ” was
old Ben Hall, that the two young
fellows were young Ben and another,
and to explain the various characters
in the book.
Bill Hall uever turned out on the
road, though he remained in the dis-
trict whilst his notorious brother went
through all his exciting experiences ;
in fact, he lived in Ben’s house until
it was burnt down by the police.
Then he got a claim on the Pinnacle
reefs, and afterwards removed to
Forbes, where, I believe, he now re-
sides, making his living as a wood-
carter.
I do not wish to invest young Ben.
with a halo of virtue, but until his
reckless career began there was pro-
bably not a man in the district whom
we thought more of. True, he had
always done a bit of duffing. But,
for the matter of that, we all duffed,
with very few exceptions. It was not
considered such a great crime—simply
a matter of business. The man who
could muster and secure unbranded
calves was considered a fool if he did
not stick his own brand on. Speak-
ing for myself, others managed to get
a lot of my stuck that wa; —and I re-
turned the compliment. Some gained
more than they lost; others were out
of pocket by the business. It was a
case of the survival of the fittest.
Undoubtedly I was among the lucky
lot. Sometimes I made as many as
fifty head at a time !
Some years after his father left the
district, Ben. got a billet as stockman ;
and, falling in love with Mr. Walsh’s
second daughter, Bridget (I had mar-
ried the eldest myself), they were
soon united. This was in ’5B. Shortly
afterwards he took up the Cubbine
Bin station, adjoining me. The
young couple jogged along very
happily for a few years, till a sneak
of a fellow named Jim Taylor, a
married man himself, who bad a
piace about 25 miles from Ben’s, near
the Humbug Greek, came along, and
“ upset the happy home.”
He was a pretended friend of
Ben’s, but, as the after events showed,
his visits were more on account of -
Ben’s wife, who was a fine-looking
woman.
I had suspected his little.game my-
self, and had dropped hints to Ben,
who cautioned his wife, in very
threatening language, what would
happen if ever he discovered anything
between her and Taylor.
Later on Ben actually came across
some of Taylor’s letters, and there
was such a row that the latter kept at
a civil distance.
But that was not for long. Tbe
rascal watched his opportunity,
lhat opportunity came when Ben and
I and most of the stockmen went
away for several days to gather wild
horses.
Our rations getting short before
the job was finished, I rode home
to procure more, and it was on reach-
ing my home that my wife informed
me that she had missed her sister,
and believed that Taylor and she had
eloped. ,
Together we went over to Ben’s
house and searched the place. The
side saddle was gone, and everything
seemed to confirm tbe opinion ex-
pressed by my wife and only too
strongly suspected by myself.
There had been two children, but
the first had died. The remaining
child (a boy) was two years old.
She bad taken him with her. I rode
back to the camp and broke the news
to Ben, who was cut up terribly, for
he had been fond of his wife, and his
little boy was the sunshine of his
home.
For three or four days Ben. raced
about, but could not get a clue as to
the direction taken by the pair. He
abandoned the search in despair* And
from that out his lifef was a reckless
one. Often be told me he would give
the world to come across Taylor, and
put a bullet through his wicked car-
case, .
(To be continued.)

More of Ben Hall.
As a matter of fact up till this time
Ben did not know what it was to use
a firearm. I witnessed his first essay
at pulling a trigger. It was a revol-
ver that he had picked up on the road
one day when wo were out riding to-
gether—a six-chambered weapon that
had evidently fallen from someone’s
belt. Getting a supply of ammunition,
Ben used to pass away his lonely
moments at home practising at a tar-
get. He soon lost interest in his
station, and started roaming about,
so that I often used to miss him for
days together.
From one of his absent fits he at
last returned with some young woman
whom he had brought home from
Lambing Flat; but she only remained
a week, when she cleared off with
someone else.
Things got from bad to worse, till
Frank Gardiner, the bushranger came,
along. He capped the lot. How,
under “ The King of the Boad’a ”
influence, Ben started on his notorious
career, I will proceed to tell.
It was in the early month of April,
1862, that Ben and his stockman,
Jack Toungman (a brother of the fat
girl who died on her passage home to
England), were riding together in the
bush when they came out On the
Binnacle road. They had not pro-
ceeded far along the road when Frank
Gardiner came galloping up, and rode
along with them. About half a mile
further on they came up with a dray,
which was being driven by a man
named Ferguson; and Gardiner,
drawing a revolver, ordered the driver
to stop. At the same time he ordered
Ben Hall and Youngman to stay there
on their horses.
Ferguson recognised Gardiner, and
was very prompt to obey his orders.
“You have some gin on the dray,
haven’t you ?” asked Gardiner.
•‘Yes,” was Ferguson’s reply.
“ Then take out the case and trans-
fer the bottles into a bag.”
Ferguson did so, packing the bottles
up in.straw, and handing the bag up
to Gardiner, who bade the lads adieu
and turned into the bush.
Ben and Youngman, who were
en route for Boyd station, took another
direction through the bush towards
Boyd.
Now, only two hundred yards ahead
of this dray was another dray, its
driver being accompanied by the
owner of both turnouts—Bill Bacon.
They had observed the affair at the
rear, and pulled up, guessing it was
Gardiner on the job. This guess was
confirmed when Ferguson afterwards
caught up and explained to his boss
exactly what had happened.
The two drays continued on their
journey to Forbes.
About a fortnight later Ben and I
attended a two-days’ race meeting at
Forbes.
On the first day Ben had entered a
chestnut mare called Lucy, which ran
second in one event, ridden by young
“Yoe.” He did not start her in the
second day’s programme, but was
himself riding the mare about the
course as a saddle hack. After din-
ner, to my surprise, I saw Ben riding
past the booth with a constable on
either side, so I rode over and en-
quired of him what was the matter.
“ Blessed if I know!” says Ben.
I directed my enquiries to the
police, but they could give no satis-
faction, and suggested that I should
go and see Sir Frederick Pottinger.
I knew Sir Frederick well. He
used to stay at Sandy Creek whenever
he was making round my 'way. On
finding him I learned that the charge
against Ben was a serious one, and
that Ben could tell me all about it
himself if I liked to go to the lock-up
in the evening.
This I did; and Ben told me all
about the dray episode, and how
Gardiner had ordered him and Young-
man to stop by the dray.
Next day he was brought up before
Captain Brown, J.P., on a charge of
being in company with the bush-
ranger, Gardiner; and he was com-
mitted for trial at the Orange quarter
sessions next month.
I went over to Orange to hear the
trial, and to assist Ben all I could. I
got Mr. Edward Lee, a barrister,
whom I had formerly known at
Bathurst, to defend him.
In the evidence the owner swore
that from his distance of 20G yards
he recognised Hall at the stuck-up
dray, but the driver gave contradictory
evidence. He swore that Ben was
not one of the men. (The other wit-
ness, the driver of the other dray, had
disappeared.)
Mr. Lee made a powerful address
to the jury, and Ben was given the
benefit of the doubt, and acquitted.
In desisting Ben in his trouble, I
did so believing him to be innocent
of any crime. It cost me a tidy sum ;
and, moreover was a bad day for me,
for I left the impression with the
police that I had tampered with wit-
nesses.
This getting into bad odour with
the police led to my own arrest, on
suspicion, later on.
In the meantime Youngman had
been arrested, but he was committed
fer the sessions following Ben’s. I
went bondsman for Youngman, along
with a squatter named Peter Murray,
for £4O each, but whilst Youngman
was out on bail he absconded, and,
strange to say, was never got after-
wards.
On the night,of Ben’s trial he and
I and Youngman started to rids back
home, a distance of about 100 miln.
A few miles out of Orange, we were
overtaken by the prosecutor (Bacon)
and the driver (Ferguson), on horse-
back, they, too, having ridden down
from Forbes for the case.
That night the five of us stayed at
a wayside inn, end continued the
journey together on the following
UJPi^ug.
When we got within a few miles
of Forbes Bacon and Ferguson said
they would have to leave their horses
outside the town. The fact of the
matter was they had stolen the use
of them to ride to Orange.
We three went on, and stayed in
Forbes until 10 that night. It was
another 80 miles en to my place,
which we reached at 2 in the morning.
Daniel C s, a young brother
to Mrs. Feeley, who then owned the
Pinnacle, and tbe man who afterwards
turned Queen’s evidence in the
Eugowra escort robbery, happened to
be staying the night at my place, but
when he woke up and found that Ben |
had got out of bis trouble he said,!
“ I must go and let tbe Darkie j
(Gardiner) know.” O s knew I
where to find him. He was only a
couple ef miles away, in the Wheogo
Mountcins.
Ben and h : s stockman then left for
their place, and I turned into my
bunk.
During next day Gardiner call'd
on Ben, and expressed regret that
Ben had got into trouble through
him. “If 1 had only thought it would
have come to that,” said Gardiner,
“ I’d have told you to clear off.”
“ Oh, well,” says Ban, “ it’s done
with now, and can’t be helped; but
the next time they take me, they'll
have something to take me for! ”
Eugowra Escort Robbery.
From that out Ben and Gardiner
were often together ; end at last Ben
took to the road himself, his first
business being in the famous Eugowra
gold escort robbery (a month after
bis trial at Orange), when £14,000
worth of gold and bank notes were
captured by the following band of
men :—Gardiner, Hall, 0 s, Gil-
bert, O’Meally, Bow, Foidyee, and
Manns.
As to Bow, Fordyie, and Manns,
nothing had been previously heard of
them in this line; but I might say
something about O’Meally and Gil-
bert, by way of introduction.
Botb these young men at this time
kept a shanty at the point of the
Weddin Mountain, on the road from
Lambing Flat fo. Forbes, 20 miles
from the former, and 45 from the
latter. Gardiner used frequently to
hang out there.
O'Meally was born and reared
there, and I bad known him since he
was a baby. He was now about 21
—tall, smart, and a splendid horse-
man.
' Gilbert was a smarter man still,
and could use his fists well, as I knew
to my sorrow, for we had had a big
encounter over at the Flat, and I got
the worst of it. He was a handsome
young chap, with a clean, feminine
face—no sign of whiskers—and wore
his hair long. Frequently, after he
took to the roads, he used to visit the
towns disguised as a girl, riding side-
saddle.
These two were supposed to have
been with Gardiner on his very first
sticking-up episode, when, between
Wombat and Young, Osborne and
Ewart were bailed up, for which
Gardiner was subsequently tried and
sentenced to 32 years. The other two
had been shot.
Now for a detailed account of the
great Eugowra escort robbery, on the
road between Forbes and Orange, on
Sunday, June 15, 1862.
The gang was led by the notorious
Frank Gardiner, who afterwards got
away, but was taken, two years later,
in Queensland, where he had settled
in business under the name of Frank
Christie. The escort robbery could
not be proved agamst him, but the
sentence of 82 years was given him
for other charges.
The following innocent men were
arrested on suspicion of having taken
part at Eugowra:—Old O’Meally,
rather of the bushranger; John
Brown, of Wheogo (married to my
wife’s sister, Miss Kate Walsh);
John Da'ay; Mick Bums; another
whose name I cannot now recall; and
myself.
I put in nine months in the logs at
Forbes end in the Bathurst and
Darlinghurst gaols, awaiting my trial.
It was a long while for a man to be
incarcerated prior to proving his inno-
cence..
During most of the term I was
fellow-prisoner with those of the eight
men who bad oesn caught; and, get-
ting, es I did, my information direct
from the culprits themselves whilst
we were together in prison, readers
ought to have a guarantee that it is
of a reliable sort—a test which many
of the accounts I have read concerning
the bushrangers of the West will not
now bear.
The gold escort used to run regularly
from Forbes to Sydpey once or twice
a week—l am not sure which. The
railway in those days only reached
the Nepean at Penrith, and there the
iron boxes of gold were changed from
the coach to the train. Sometimes
there was a much as £30,000 worth
on board. It was a big temptation!
It was with Gardiner that the idea
of taking the er art originated, and it
took a for. night to prepare for the
attack.
For some montbs before Gilbert
and O’MerUy were his constant com-
panions, and they bed been talking
about it together. Tney were getting
full of the p'.tty bailing-up busi-
ness, and wanted to make one grand
haul »*id then quit the country.
Three were considered not enough
to take such a big contract on, so they
ccabout for assistance. That was
not hard to get. Gardiner reckoned
on Ben Hall as a certainty to join in;
and, on being approached, Ben readily
consented.
Bow and Fordyce were next en-
veiglcd. The chances of sudden
riches as presented through “The
Darkie’a” spectacles were too alluring
to resist. Bow was a stock-keeper
for John Nolan, of the Yellow Water
Holes station, near the Weddin
Mountains. Fordyce was a stock-
keeper for Patrick Walsh, on Butran-
gong creek, the other side of the
range.
Neither Hall, Bow, nor Fordyce
bad been out “ on the road” before.
These six men arranged to meet
together on a certain time and date
in Wentworth Gully—an immense
gorge in the Weddin Mountains, The
meeting came off, with all present,
and a general discussion ensued.
Gardiner was chief spokesman, of
course. Hall chipped in with a sug-
gestion that a splendid place for
sticking up the escort was a spot
about two miles from the Eugowra
sreek, where the road went up a
gully, and suddenly turned at the
head of a little creek, with convenient
rocks adjacent, and so on. This was
unanimously selected as the scene of
attack.
Hall knew the place well, and had
a good knowledge of the surrounding
country, so he was appointed pilot.
He was also deputed to go into
Forbes and inquire particulars as to
the escort. The meeting then split
up.
Hall ascertained that the escort
was to leave Forbes on the Sunday,
at noon. Word was then passed
round for another assemblage of the
band on the Friday before. True to
promise, the whole six turned up on
that day, meeting this time in a dense
scrub on the Wheogo Mountains
about two miles from my house.
After a bit of talk-over, they rode
off towards the Pinnacle, and that
night pitched camp on the mountain,
near Mrs. Feeley’s pub.
A young fellow named Charters
(a brother of the landlady), living at
the hotel, was reckoned upon as a
likely bird to join in the swim, and a
couple of the men went over to see
him, with the result that early next
morning ho joined the adventurous
crew.
The seven men started together for
Forbes. They pitched camp just out-
side the town, on a bend of the river.
Hall and Charters were sent in to
purchase the necessary equipments.
They returned with six double-barrel-
led muzzle-loading guns (breach-load-
ers were very scarce in those days)
and moulds tor making bullets; also
sundry other things, including black
crape for masks, and red mufflers to
tie round the heads as a further dis-
guise.
The same two than went to Jack
Healey’s, on the other side of the
town, where lived a young man of
nineteen years, named Harry Manns,
whose assistance bad also been antici-
pated.
Harry threw in his lot, and in
Healey’s kitchen they set to work and
moulded a big supply of. bullets for
the shot guns.
It was between 1 and 2 o’clock that
Charters and Hall, accompanied by
the latest recruits, once more joined
the rest of the party, which at once
set out for the Eugowra rocks.
On the way they called at the house
of another married sister of Charters
to replenish the tucker bags.
With sundry things still to fix up,
it was noon before they arrived at
their destination, when ell agreed
that Ben could hardly have chosen for
them a more advantageous point for.
an attack. A huge reck just at the
turn of the road afforded an excellent
concealment for the gang, and from
Mount Cooimbla, just by, they could
get a clear look out for two or three
miles along the road towards Forbes.
Gardiner proceeded to plan cut the
places for the men, and give full in*
struotions how to act when the time
came.
They took the horses over a small
spur—out of sight of any casual
travellers that might come along—
and made them secure; then took up
positions on the look.out.
The coach was not expected till
about 6 o’clock. An hour before this
two. bullock teams hove in sight,
coming along frem the Orange side.
Leaving a couple of men to watch for
the coach, Gardiner and the rest went
down to the rooks, and rushed oat
when the bullock-punchers got near,
and gave them orders to bail up.
It was an awkward predicament to ‘
suddenly find themselves confronted
with masked highwaymen and double-
barrels pointing at their heads, and a
look of very humble obedience imme-
diately overspread the countenance of
each traveller.
“We have a little bit of a job on
here,” says Gardiner ;• “ and if you
are wise men, you’ll do just exactly
as I tell you 1”
(To bo continued.)


14
Needless to say, the drivers did so.
They drew their teams across, so as
to completely block the road by the
big rook, and then lay flat on the
ground behind soma of the rocks.
Any movement on their part was on
pain of death. Soon a whistle came
from the hillside— a warning that the
coach was coming. The sentries hur-
ried down to their comrades, and all
took up their positions behind the
big rock, not more than ten yards
from the road.
In the coach were Tack Fagan (the
driver), a well-known ‘ man on the
roads in those days ; Sergeant Con-
dell, iu charge of the escort; and
constables Moran and Haviland. I
knew them all.
As the four horses tugged the valu-
able cargo up the rise, the occupants
of the seats little thought of what was
in store- Tust as Tack was about to
pull up and, I suppose, call out to
i the adjectival bullockies to come out
and turn their tearr.s a bit, the eight
men jumped from behind their am-
bush and sent a volley of bullets into
the coach. The suddenness of it simply
paralysed the occupants, who—every
man of them—jumped off and made
full retreat for the hush on the
opposite side.
The “ hofficers ’’ did not even wait
to return the fire, and in less time
almost than it takes to tell they were
at a very safe distance.
The gang immediately turned their
attention to the horses, which had
taken flight and started to bolt.
However, after doing about 60 yards
straight up the gully, the coach cap-
sized, and the horses were secured.
Two were kept for packhorses, and on
to these no time was lost in getting
the valuable' contents from the vehicle.
It must have taken nearly half an
hour for this operation, but there was
no interruption whatever. The police
had mads for Clements’ station, a
couple of miles away, which was then
managed by Campbell—the man who
afterwards shot O’Meally.
The saddle horses were then rushed
down from the hillside and mounted,
and the party hurried away through
the bush, much to the relief pi the
two scared bullock drivers, who now
found that they could rise in safety.
By this time darkness had pretty
well set in.
The gang did not draw rein for ten
miles, when a previously-chosen quiet
nook was reached on the river, oppo-
site the house of another sister of
Charters. Whilst the young man
went out to get a stock of provisions
for an extended trip the mail bags
were opened and any superfluous
cargo dispensed with, and the lot re-
packed on to one horse, for the other
had knocked up with his quick run.
When Charters returned they
started off again, crossing the river.
That night they rode away to the
Wheogo Mountains.
Next morning Charters went oVer
to Mrs. Brown’s, and borrowed a set
of grocer’s scales, on which the gold
was weighed and whacked out, each
man getting 221bs weight of the pre-
cious metal, in addition to which
£4,000 in bank-notes were distributed
between them.
Here a row occurred over the old
man Fordyce. Gardiner was nearly
insisting on®him getting none of the
prize, reckoning the old fellow had
turned coward. It appears he had
not discharged his gun. Fordyce re-
plied that it would not go off. The
fact was, the old chap was a bit more
tender-hearted than the rest. But, in
any case, so they told me, they did not
intend to take life. It was in order
to frighten the police that the volley
was fired. Some fired into the air;
others aimed at unoccupied portions
of the coach. Nevertheless, both
Condell and Moran were wounded,
though not seriously, and it was said
that the driver had his hat knocked
off with a bullet.
After the encounter with the gang
the occupants of the coach arrived at
Mr. Clements’ station. The wounded
police were, attended to, and made
comfortable for the night, and Mr.
Clements set out on horseback for
Forbes, 20 miles distant, to report the
affair to the police.
The arrival of the news created a
tremendous sensation in the town.
Sir Frederick Fottinger at once got
together a big party of police and
two black trackers, called “ Billy
Dargon” and “Jimmy the dealer.”
(The former was one of the men who
afterwards shot Ben Hall.) They
were accompanied by a number of
civilians,
Eugowra Creek was reached at day*
light, and the tracks of the gang were
picked up up at the overturned coach
and followed to the spot on the Lach-
lan, 10 miles away, where the mail
bags had been opened.
The remnants were gathered to-
gether, and some of the party were
told off to take-them on to Orange.
Two of the horses were recovered,
the coach was righted, and the bags
and empty gold boxes were in due
course taken on.
Strange to relate, Trooper Havi-
land, the only member of the three
police to escape injury when Gardiner
and Co. poured their bullets into the
coach on the Sunday, was accidently
shot dead shortly after the escort left
Orange to proceed on its journey.
But, to return to the chase :
Sir Frederick and party crossed the
river, and ran the trail over the edge
of the Crawlin plain and into the
scrub again. Near the Finnacle,
about 20 miles from the river camp,
the tracks scattered, indicating that
the men had separated in order to
baffle pursuit. Then the police lost
sight of the trail altogether.
The voice of Gardiner had been
recognised by the escort men, and it
was reckoned that he would lead the
gang to his haunts on the Weddin
Mountains.
The pursuers were then split into
two parties. Inspector Sanderson,
one of the bravest and best men ever
in the force, was given charge of one
divison. With him went the tracker,
Billy Dargon.
Sanderson had his suspicions, and
made straight for Ben Hall’s house,
which he reached about 10 or 11 on
Tuesday morning. Bill Hall and his
wife lived at Ben’s house. ■
Now it happened that Charters
was, at the time, inside the house.
He had been sent down from the top
of the Wheogo Mountains, two miles
away, where the gang had camped ,to
get a pair of saddle bags for Gardi-
ner to carry away his gold in.
Charters heard the dogs bark, and
espied the police coming. He slipped
out, mounted his horse, and made
away for the mountains at full gallop.
He left the house between himself
and the police, but the latter sighted
him, and, looking, as it did, rather
suspicious, they started in pursuit. I
witnessed part of the chase .as they
passed my house.
Charters had a lead of a few hun-
dred yards, and was mounted on a
splendid animal. However, the police
kept him in sight till the foot of the
mountain was reached. In the mean-
time, from the lookout, the gang got
a sight of Charters coming at a
gallop, with the police hard behind
him, and they made hasty prepara-
tions for a departure as soon as
Charters could get up to them.
Of the eight men, three had left
for their homes that morning, via.,
Gilbert, Manns, and the old man,
Fordyce.
Every member had on his own
horse his share of the bank notes,
but some of the shares of the gold had
been lumped and placed on the pack-
horse.
Fordyce had left his lot of gold
behind, having arranged with Gardi-
ner to meet him afterwards in Terrible
Hollow and get his whack.
O’Meally also had his gold with
Gardiner’s on the pack-horse.
It appears that both O’Meally and
Fordyce lived not far from Terrible
Hollow, at the Weddin Mountains,
and for the three to afterwards meet
in that secluded spot seemed to» pre-
sent no difficulty. But, unfortunately,
as I will explain, the pack-horse had
to be abandoned in the pursuit.
The men left in the camp as the
police raced up were Gardiner, Hall,
Bow, O’Meally, and Jacky Walsh (my
young brother-in-law), aged 18, and
commonly called “The Warrigal,” on
account of his wildness. He was
Gardiner's “bush telegraph,” and
had been associated with the leader j
for about three months. j
When Charters got within speaking
distance, he shouted out, 41 Here comes
the police, boys'! ”
Great excitement ensued. Gardi-
ner* grabbed the pack-horse by the
rein, and mounted his own steed. The
rest followed suit; and away they all
sped down the mountain, whilst the
police were scrambling up the other
side.
Hall made off by himself to the
left through some hills at the back of
Wheogo station, planted his gold in
the hills, and went home. The rest
kept together for a while, crossing
the head of “ Terrible Hollow.”
The police, on reaching the top of
the mountains, saw tbe remains of the
camp and the three forked sticks and
scales on which the gold had been
weighed out. (I afterwards picked
up a few penny-weights of gold there
myself.) No sight of the gang could
be got, but the trails were picked up
and followed without difficulty.
Bow and O’Meally were on the best
mounts, and had a lead.
When they got a sight of the police
hard behind they decided to split up.
Bow turned to the right, in the
direction of his own hut at the
Yellow Water Holes (Nolan’s);
O’Meally turned for a point on the
Weddin Mountains, towards his own
place. Charters kept him company.
This left Gardiner and tbe Warrigal
in the rear.
The pack horse was knocking up,
and the police were gaining. At
length barely half a mile separated
them. Gardiner was hanging on to
the old coach horse with the valuable
booty aboard, and little Jacky was
belting him along Dehind. At last
they were getting sore pressed, and
there was no alternative but to let the
pack-horse go. With a curse “ The
Darkie” dropped his prize, and he
and the youngster dug spurs into
their mounts to save their own skin.
It appears the pack-horse was
caught by the police. This was some-
thing in Sanderson’s cap. On the
pack were 1,300 ounces of gold. Some
of the police stayed with the pack-
horse ; the rest kept up the pursuit.
They were still gaining, so Gardiner
and the Warrigal separated.
Gardiner made for Wentworth
Gully ; the Warrigal for Basin Gully,
to the left. The police turned their
attention to the latter.
At last the lad got into a bit of a
plight. He had ridden into the
pocket of a creek. The police were
not far away. He could hear the
hoof-beats. To turn back would bare
meant capture, and there was nothing
for it but to face the creek. He was
mounted on a splendid little 15-hand
bay pony called “ Little John ” (I
afterwards owned the animal myself) :
and, ramming the spurs in, he raced
at the obstacle, and got over safely.
The jump was afterwards measured—
it was fully 20 feet. At any rate,'
none of Her Majesty’s officials would
face it. They had to go back a
quarter of a mile to renew the chase.
In the ipeantime Jacky was lost sight
of in the scrub, and got clean away.
The trail of Bow was picked up,
and it was followed to Nolan’s. There,
in the afternoon, they found Bow at
his usual work on the station. That
disarmed any suspicion they may have
entertained that he was one of the
men they had been pursuing.
As a matter of fact, none had been
recognised. Tbe police had never got _
close enough to do so. Bow had hid- *
den his revolver and his share of the
plunder in a log near Wentworth
Gully whilst the chase was on.
Several questions were asked him, and
answered with apparent satisfaction.
The police next went to old
O’Meally’s pub. There they found
young Jack O’Meally and Charters
knocking about the pub in an ordinary-
looking sort of way. They were left
without displaying any cause for sus-
picion.
They then went back to Forbes,
having fared better than Sir Frederick,
who had done no good at all with bis
division, whilst Sanderson had made
a big haul in recovering so much of
the gold.
The officials pottered about the
country for several days; and the
first man arrested was—MYSELF!
(To be continued.)


15
Eugowra Escort Robbery.
When Inspector Saunderson re-
tained to Forbes with the paokhorse
and the 1300 ounces of gold. Sir
Frederick Fottinger, along with the
Inspector and seven or eight troopers
and a black tracker, set oat for my
locality.
At Whooge station, then owned by
widow Walsh, resided Mrs. John
Brown (nee Kate Walsh) and her
husband.
Now, it was generally known that
Mrs. Brown and Frank Gardiner were
carrying on a secret game together, so
to the domicile of this fair creature the
police paid a visit. Brown himself was
away.
After patting some questions to the
woman, which were persistently
evaded, Sir Frederick instituted a
search through the house, as the re.
suit of which they discovered a piece
of gold, over an ounce in weight.
Questioned as to where she got the
nugget, Mrs, Brown replied,
“McGuire gave it to mo.”
“ And where did McGuire get it ? ”
asked Sir Frederick.
“From the Pinnacle reef.”
; Sir Frederick then came over to my
place (Sandy Greek ). I was engaged,
when he arrived, killing a beast down
in the yard, Sir Frederick showed me
the gold, saying, “ McGuire, I have a
nugget of gold here. Did you ever
see it before?”
“ No, ’’was my reply, after looking
carefully at it “ I have never seen it
before.”
“Did you not get it out of your
reel at the Pinnacle ? ”
“ No, Sir Frederick. If you are any
judge of gold, you will see that it is
not reef gold, but alluvial, and water
worn ”
“Then you know nothing about
it?"
“No”
Sir Frederick then got on to the
subject of the escort robbery.
“ Now, you know a lot about this
affair,” be said ; “ and I want you to
tell me all about it. If you do, 1 won’t
interfere with yon.”
“ I know nothing whatever about it,
Sir Frederick."
That was a fact. I certainly- knew
that there had been a robbery. Indeed,
the whole country was aware of that.
But who were the individuals of the
gang who stuck up the coach I did
not then know. Sir Frederick said if
I did not tell him, he would arrest me
—that he had enough against me to
hang me.”
■“ Hanging be d to you,”
says I, getting indignant; “ Do you
want me to swear a lie ? ”
With this, Sir Frederick turned to
the men and ordered them to put the
handcuffs on me.
At my request I was first allowed
to go inside my house and get a wash,
for the blood of the beast that I had
been killing was all over my bands.
Two of the.men were then sent cff
to Brown’s. If Brown had returned
they were to arrest him.
Shortly afterwards Brown came
over in custody, and we two, were
handcuffed to each other.
A similar mission was made to Ben
Hall’s house, where Ben and Charters
were secured. They were in turn
brought over to my house, paired as
Brown and I were.
1 bad been arrested about 4 o’clock,
and it was 6 by the time we four
prisoners were together. The police
decided to stay for the night, so my
wife proceeded to get supper for the
crowd. It was the first time I was
forced in this way to be deprived of
one hand at a meal, but we got
through it.
After the indignation of being hand-
cuffed had worn off me, I was able to
joke about it, for I reckoned it would
all come out alright as far as I was
concerned. The subsequent portion
of my narrative will prove, however,
that I was a long way out of my
calculations. ,
When bed-time came round Hall,
Charters, Brown, and I were all
handcuffed together, and had to doss
in our clothes on a rough shake-down,
whilst Sir Fredrick took possession of
the sofa in the same room, in order to
be handy. Some of the men took it
in turn to do sentry duty around the
bouse, whilst the rest slept out in the
kitchen.
In the morning we were roused up
and paired off again, and some of the
troopers were sent away to Brown’s
and Hall’s to get horses for Ben and
Brown and Charters, my saddle horse
being run up from the paddock for
me.
After breakfast Sir Frederick gave
orders to start for Forbes, but before
we left I insisted on an order being
' left with my wife to defray the cost of
boarding and lodging the crowd, which
Sir Frederick duly complied with,
handing a voucher over for £l/17/.
It was a bit of a break-up parting
from my wife and two youngsters, but
I assured the better-half that I would
be home in a day or two; that all
would come out all right, as I had no
concern whatever with the robbery.
Each of us was now handcuffed
singly, and bidden to mount our
horses. Our hands were then strapped
to the pummel of the saddle, and with
a trooper each holding our reins the
procession moved off, Sir Frederick
giving orders that should anyone ap-
pear on the road suspected of having
intentions to rescue us, each trooper
was to shoot his man dead.
I turned to the Sergeant and ques-
tioned his legal right to do such a
thing, adding that it was not likely
any attempt would be made to rescue
us.
It was SO miles to Forbes, which we
reached, without anything eventful
en route, at 3 o’clock in the afternoon,
after being seven hours in the saddle,
without anything to eat meanwhile.
Forbes waa then at its zenith. There
must have been about 80,000 people
on the field. Tou can guess the ex-
citement there was created on the
arrival of four prisoners, supposed to
be the escort robbers, led by troopers,
with guards in front and behind.
People were rushing from al< direc-
tions to see us. “ Hullo, Mao! ” I
could hear from all sides, for I was
very well known in the district.
A tremendous crowd had gathered
up by the time we had pulled up at
the lookup, and we were hastily
hustled inside.
The lookup—otherwise known as
II the logs ” —was built of pine logs,
strapped together with iron bars and
bolts. We could see out through the
cracks. The four of us were the
sole occupants of the room, and sen-
tries were placed all round the out-
side.
Next morning we weie brought up
at the court—a one-roomed weather-
board place—before Oaptain Brown,
the Commissioner, and charged, on
suspicion, of being implicated in the
escort robbery.
Sir Frederick Fottinger asked for
seven days’ remand to produce evi-
dence, which waa duty granted, and
back we went to the logs.
During these seven days others
were arrested—Old O’Meally (father
of the bushranger), Jack Dacey, Mick
Burns, and a man whose proper name I
I cannot now recall, but who waa j
nicknamed “ Boots,” on account of |
his babit of wearing long Wellingtons
outside his trousers.
I often noticed Hall and Charters
whispering together apart from the
rest of the prisoners; and I began
to suspect that they knew something
about the robbery.
“They havn’t found anything on
us, and they can do nothing to us,”
I heard Hall mumble once ; and on
another occasion he whispered, “ I
planted mine where they are not
likely to find it.”
With the exception of Ha u , Char-
ters, and myself, the other prisoners
were let go, one by one, ere our
second appearance before the court.
When the remaining trio again
came up we had two solicitors acting
for us, my wife having arranged for
same. They were Mr. Redmond
(then an M.P.) and Mr. T. L. James,
both of Forbes. (The latter after-
wards broke his neck in a fall from
his horse at Biualong in the latter
end of the seventies.)
Once more a remand! Our solicitors
tried hard to get bail, but they were
refused.
A few days afterwards wo noticed
Sir Frederick in conversation with
James Newland, a brother-in-law to
Charters. (It was to Newland’s
house that Charters went the night
of the robbery to get food supplies
whilst the gang were engaged cutting
open the mail bags.) Sir Frederick
then came and took Charters away.
On his return Charters told us he
was going to get bail. We thought
it strange that he could get bail
whilst we could not. Speaking lor
myself, my wife had arranged for two
very ample sucurities. On the same
day Charters was let go.
I watched Ben’s countenance, and
noticed that he looked a bit upset
when Charters got his freedom.
Ben and I were now left alone to-
gether, and next morning he confided
to me a full account of the robbery
and the names of the men who took
part. They were—himself, Gardiner,
young O’Meally, Gilbert, Charters,
Bow, Fordyce, and—the only man
I vu not then acquainted with— /
Harry Manns.
This was, I declare, the first time
I really knew who the culprita were,
although, aa I said before, I had my
auapioiona aa to aome of the gang, at
any rate.
I remonstrated with Ben, as there
had been no occasion for him to take
that game on, but he said he had
been run on to it by Gardiner.
The following advertisement ap-
peared in the “ Police Gazette

ted to the Government that on the

CHARLES COWPER.
Colonial Secretary’s Office,
Sydney, 17th June, 1862;
At our third hearing Charters did
not appear. Ben and I were re-
manded for another seven days, and
bail was again refused. But later on
in the day Ben was let out, on his
own recognizances. I was thus left
alone. The only reason 1 could as -
sign for this was that the officials
guessed 1 knew all about the affair
by this, and that they wanted to
pump me for information.
Next afternoon Johnny O’Meally
was put in with me.
“ Hullo! ” says I, when the bolts
were once more locked, “ what have
you been doing ? ”
“ I’m d—i— if I know! ” 'says
O’Meally.
I then told him that Ben had let me
into the secret of the escort robbery.
“ Oh, well,” says O’Meally, “I don’t
care. They can’t prove anything
against me.”
He in his turn gave me his account
of the affair, which was simply a
corroboration of what I had heard
from Hall.
In due course O’Meally and I were
before the court. It waa my fourth
appearance. Another remand 1 No
one tried to bail O’Meally out, but
my friends were still battling strongly
for me, offering as much as £l,OOO.
After we were put back in the cells
a plain clothes constable, whose name
has lately gone out of my recollection,
took me out to a stable and asked me
to sit down and have a yarn. He
produced a bottle of brandy, and
offered me a drink, which I gladly
accepted, for it was the first I had
seen since my incarceration. I polished
off a stiff nobler, by way of pre-
liminaries, and then the confab com.
menced.
“ dome, McGuire,” says he, “ tell
me all about this affair, and you will
get your liberty, and a good re-
ward besides. You are very foolish
if you don’t tell what you know.”
I admitted that I had heard all
about it, but pointed out that it would
be no use, as it was only hearsay.
Moreover, T did not want to be mixed
up in the case in any way.
A few more nips, and he could not
get anything out of me; so once more
I rejoined O’Meally, who wanted to
know what was on. I told him what
the game was.
It was getting monotonous.
Then II had a visit from a young
man I had known for some years
Kearin Cummings, a J.P. He also
took me away for a yarn. I could see
bis idea was to get information on
behalf of the police, but he got along
no better than the plain clothes con-
stable.
Henceforth, I began to find that I
was getting well looked after in the
logs. There was always plenty of
brandy and tobacco. A kind of
sweetener!
(To be Continued).

Eugowra Escort Robbery.
And now I will let you into a
secret that O’Meally divulged to me
whilst we were, beguiling the lonely
hours together, concerning a capture
and a rescue at the Broken Dam.
It appears that Harry Manns and
Johnny Gilbert, two of the Eugowra
escort robbers, were making away to
Victoria, taking with them their share
of the £14,000 of the gold and notes.
They were accompanied by Gilbert’s
brother Charlie.
Sir Fredrick Fottinger had been
shadowing these men on suspicion,
and had been working through the
same parts, accompanied by Detective
Lyons and Trooper Mitchell.
Lyons was the man who, as I said
before, took part in the big fight
with “ The Three Jacks”—Davis,
McQuinness, and “ Black Pat ” —and
had one finger blown off; and
Mitchell was the son of the great
explorer.
Manns and the two Gilberts had
passed a few miles beyond Little
George’s, at the Broken Dam, when
they fell in with Lyons.
Lyons, it appears, was a little way
ahead of the other police; but he
managed to string out an off-hand
sort of conversation till the others
caught up to him.
When they came up Sir Fredrick
remarked to Johnny Gilbert, “That’s
a fine horse you are riding.”
“ Yes,” says Gilbert.
“ Do you own him ? ” asked Sir
Frederick.
“ Yes,” was the reply.
Have you a receipt for him P”
“Oh, yes,” says Gilbert; “I have
it on me.” And, standing up in the
stirrups as if to get the receipt from
his pocket, he dug spurs into his
horse and shot away like a bird.
The police then seized upon Manns
and Charlie Gilbert, and took them
over to the Broken Dam house.
On Manns they found 100 ounces
of gold and over £400 in notes,
which they at once reckoned as part of
the escort booty.
Nothing was found on Charles
Gilbert.
In the meantime Johnny Gilbert
was luakiug all speed to the W«ddin
Mountains, 60 or 70 miles away, to
get assistance for a rescue.
During the night he reached
O’Meally’s pub, and enlisted the
old man and Fordyce, and another
man ; and, getting a fresh horse for
himself, the four, without delay,
started, as hard as they could lick, for
the Broken Dam. By sunrise they
had taken up a position on the road,
within a mile or two of the house at
which the police had stopped for the
night. The horses had been planted,
and, as the police' were seen to come
along with their prisoners, the daring
four put crape over their faces as a
disguise, get their shooting-pieces
ready, and waited in ambush.
When the police came up the four
men rushed out and presented their
revolvers, crying, “ Bail up! ”
Sir Fredrick, who had the gold
strapped on his horse, rammed spurs
in and got away. Lyons, who had
the notes, tried to do likewise, but a
bullet from one of the revolvers hit his
borse, which fell ; and whilst two of
the party secured Mitchell, who was
leading the prisoners, the others got
hold of Lyons.
After securing the firearms from
the police Lyons was made to hand
over the notes and unlock the hand-
cuffs from the prisoners, and in less
time than it takes to tell the rescuers
and rescued were making away at
full gallop.
That is the story of the rescue as
told to me by one of the party.
But to return once more to our dis-
mal cell:
Without anything sensational inter-
vening we kept going backwards and
forwards to the police court regularly,
once a week, till I had put in fourteen
appearances. Fourteen times before
the court in fourteen weeks!
The Forbes and Bathurst news-
papers began to shake the authorities
up for it, and to cry “ Shame! ” So
we were removed to Bathurst, 105
miles away, and placed in the gaol
there.
We travelled by coach. It was in
the beginning of September, 1862.
The first day we got as far as Toogong,
and spent that night at a pub kept
by an old schoolmate of mine, who,
sub rosa, gave an eye to oar per-
sonal comforts. Next day. we had
dinner in the Orange gaol. It was
32 ’miles from Orange to Bathurst;
and when within three miles of the
latter our coach turned over. The
troopers, who were on the top of the
coach, were thrown off, but we two
prisoners, who were inside and hand-
cuffed together, were pinned there,
and could not get out. Had the
horses been wild, the probability is
that we should hare been dragged to
pieces. But no one was hurt, for-
tunately, and soon we were once more
on the go. On arrival at Bathurst
we were placed in the lookup for the
sight; and next morning, on being
brought before the court, we were
remanded to gaol.
On the morning of our second ap-
pearance, as we came out of our cells
into the gaol yard, we were sur-
prised to see amongst the “ boarders ”
no less personages than Bow and
Fordyce, two of the escort robbers.
In placing the handcuffs on ' us
prior to our removal to the court a
constable clinched the “ darby ”
through the loose skin of my wrist,
which , treatment 1 resented very
forcibly to the Sergeant, who was
standing by; and that official threa-
tened his subordinate that if ever he
did the like again he would be re-
ported. The handcuff was taken off
again and adjusted properly, but it
left an ugly wound behind, the mark
of which remains to this day
Bow and Fordyce were taken to
court in irons, and the case was held
with close doors.
A survey of those present as we
entered was a bit of a surprise.
Amongst them, seated at the table,
was Dan Charters (one of the gang
who stuck up the coach) and a man
named Tom Matthews, alias Tom
Richards. I guessed then that Bow,
Fordyce, and O’Meally stood a poor
show from Charters, whose position
in the case could be taken in at a
glance. As for’ myself, of course, I
knew there was nothing against me,
provided the truth was spoken.
However, the man Matthews upset
my apple-cart, as 1 will explain.
On the bench were Dr. .Palmer (the
police magistrate) and - Messrs.
Hawkins and Clements, Js.P.
Proceedings opened with some
strong remarks to Sir Frederick
Pottinger Irom the P.M., who ob-
jected to men being brought before
him in irons.
Sir Frederick said the two prisoners
were brought from Forbes in irons.
“Well, why weren’t they struck off
in the gaol yard ? ” queried the P.M.,
who ordered the same to be done
there and then.
This done, the case was opened. '
Sir Frederick Pottinger gave his
evidence as to the arrest.
The next witness was Charters,
who said he had taken part in the
sticking-up of the escort coach, but
stated that he had been forced into
the business. He swore to Bow and
Fordyce being members of the gang
on that occasion, but that O’Meally
was not present. He stated that he
was not aware I was connected with
it.in anyway;,but, unfortunately for
me, he did not swear that I was not.
The witness Matthews, however, swore
that I had been talking to him about
it on the Sunday afternoon of the
robbery, and that I made use of the
words, “ The boys are at it now.”
O’Meally, on bis own recognisance
pf £lOO, was released ; Bow, Fordyce,
and I were remanded.
After another seven days we three
were again brought up, and this time
committed to take' our trial at the
next circuit court at Bathurst, or any
other place that might be appointed.
One morning, as we came into the
gaol yard, I noticed Bow and Fordyce,
after casting their eyes around, look
significantly at one another, and 1
asked what was up.
“ There’s another one of the gang
collared,” whispered Fordyce.
“ Who ? ” I asked in return, as 1
ran my eye over a strange prisoner,
a man I had never seen before.
“ Manns,” was the reply.
So this was Manns, the only one
out of the eight who bailed up the
coach whom I was not acquainted
with. He had come, it appears, from
Wombat, near The Flat (Young).
1 advised Bow and Fordyce to keep
away from the newcomer, if they
would be .wise- There was a man
in the yard whom I suspected to be a
detective. I communicated this idea
to the other two, but they were not
quite so sanguine about it as I, al-
though they were careful to run no
risks with him. His name was
Charlie Lord. That my surmise was
correct was proved by the fact that,
after all my trouble was at last over,
1 met him in Bathurst, and he ad-
mitted such.
Experiences in Bathurst Goal.
My experience in the Bathurst
Gaol would fill many pages, but I will
content myself with relating only one
or two incidents.
For instance, I happened to occupy
the adjoining cell to an aboriginal
known as “ Black Jack,” who was
sentenced to death for rape.
The hanging took place in the gaol.
On the -morning of his execution,
when I awoke, I could hear the
doomed man moving about in his cell,
and I sang out to him, “ Well, what
do you think of it this morning,
Jacky ? ”
“ Not much,” was his cheerful reply;
“ it will soon be over now ! ”
Shortly afterwards I heard the
bolts of Jacky’s cell drawn and the
sheriff and hangman enter. The
latter was known as “Bobby the
Pig.’’ I could hear the sheriff
formally demanding the body of the
prisoner, and the irons being struck
off. They marched down the cor-
ridor, and the footsteps grew fainter
and fainter as Jacky walked to his
doom. Then to my cell came the
echo of the fatal bolt as it was shot,
and I realised that another “ State
murder ” was completed, and that this
poor, half-civilized human being was
on his road to eternity.
I also remember, amongst other
bushrangers arrested, the appearance
in the gaol-yard of Fred Lowrie, who
looked” very much knocked about.
His face bore marks, and his head
was tied up. It appears he had had
a terrible fight with some civilians at
Campbell’s river racecourse, on the
other side of Bathurst. He was
secured by the civilians, and banded
over to the police.
Lowrie and six others afterwards
broke gaol by digging a hole through
the brick wall of the yard.
A publican near by saw the escape,
and reported the matter. Five were
caught, but Lowrie and a man named
Hart got away. The latter was re-
taken at Goulburn, three months
afterwards, but Lowrie still kept at
large. He got a companion, named
Cummins, at Walla, on the Fish river.
Trooper Stephens (afterwards an in-
spector) succeeded in arresting both.
Lowrie, who was badly wounded in
the encounter, died whilst being
escorted to Goulburn in a cart.
Another man, nicknamed “ Pug,”
who was doing six months in Bath-
urst gaol whilst I was there, escaped,
and was never retaken. 1 afterwards
recognised him in a crowd ih the
Darlinghurst court-house.
Taken to Sydney for Trial.
Our trial was not destined to come
off at Bathurst Circuit Court, for a
special commission was appointed to
hear it in Sydney (in February, 1863),
and at the same time deal with the
bushranging cases from all parts of
the colony.
It was in January, 1863, that the
bushrangiug prisoners were taken
fy-om Bathurst gaol to Sydney. There
were ten of us altogether, as fallows :
Bow, Fordyce, Manns, and myself, in
connection with the gold escort
robbery ; Aliok Ross, Bill Ross, and
Connors, for sticking-up a pub at
Pepper’s creek, near Campbell’s rirer;
George Williams, for sticking-up the
Gowra to Carcoar mail, and taking
£1,600 in money; Jack Heally, for
bailing-up a hawker on the Weddin
Mountain; and Harry Fassy, for a
sticking-up case on the top of Mount
Victoria.
I might here give an account of
Williams’s affair, as related to me by
the prisoner himself.
Williams was quite a young man,
and had been in the country three or
four months when he got the notion
of making a big haul. It was near a
wayside inn known as the “ Sheet of
Bark,” on the Oowra to Carcoar road,
that he stuck up the mail. He had
blackened his face with burnt char,
coal, and was armed with one revolver.
There were six passengers on the
coach. He presented his revolver at
the driver, and told him to pull up.
The driver obeyed, and was then
told to hand over the mail-bags.
Williams opened the bags, and
succeeded in obtaining the amount
mentioned, namely £l5OO.
He then mounted his horse and
galloped oS into the bush, in the
Cowra direction, but when he got out
of sight he wheeled for Carooar.
Within four miles of the town he
washed his face in the Mudoram
Creek, and planted £l,OOO of the
money in a hollow log, and the re*
volver along with it. He then
hurried into Carcoar and put up at
the first hotel he came to. He told'
the publican he had been stuck up on
the road by a masked man and rob--
bed.
Just after he had got his horse into
the stable the coach pulled up iu ,
the yard, and the driver and passen- ‘
gers started to tell the publican about
their having been stuck up.
“ Why, there’s a man here who
was also stuck up on the same road,’
remarked the publican.
Just then Williams came round,
and the publican called him up. ’
The driver asked Williams for the
description of the man.
“ Oh, a chap something after my
own build,” says Williams, with his
face blackened.
Now the driver chanced to notice a
black ring round Williams’s neck,
and he passed a wink on to the pub-
lican, and, waiting till he got a chance,
whispered for him to send for the
police. The police came, arrested
Williams, and took him to the court-
house.
Strange to say, Williams was not
searched. On being remanded to the
lock-up no one bothered searching
him, probably because the officials
thought that that act had been per-
formed ere he went to the court-
house. .Williams therefore found
himself in his cell, with £5OO worth
of money on his person. There was
a boarded floor to the cell, and, draw-
ing up one of the boards, he planted
his booty underneath.
Next day he was again before the
court, and was remanded for a week.
After this the lockup-keeper set to
work to “ pump ” him'. He used to
bring Williams out into the front
room, bid him make himself comfor-
table, and treat him to grog.
The name of the lockup-keeper was
Fox, and he was as cunning as a fox.
He offered to procure for Williams
the best counsel to be got in the ,
colony if be would give him half the
booty. But it was not till Fox had
played this game several times that
Williams at last let him into the
secret that he had the £5OO concealed
in his cell. The pair thereupon went
into the cell, and Fox got possessien
of the valuable plant.
“ Now, tell me where the rest is,"
says Fox, “ and I will guarantee to
get you out.”
Williams gave him particulars of
the exact locality.
The sly Fox, with many assurances
to the prisoner that everything would
come out all right, went and reported
the matter to the police, who, with
the - assistance of a black-tracker,
found the hollow log and the £lOOO
and the revolver.
These were brought up in evidence
against Williams, who was committed
to take his trial.
Immediately after the committal,
Fox again had the prisoner out into
his front room, thinking to get more
out of him. Williams was quick to
notice, on this occasion, that the front
door was not bolted. He drew out
and knocked Fox down, escaped
through the door, and made tracks up
a steep hill close by, towards Mount
Macquarie. But a bullock-driver met
him coming up the hill, and, seeing
the police in pursuit, tripped up the
fugitive, and he was secured and
taken back to the lock-up.
Williams was then shifted to the
Bathurst gaol, and it was within the
grim walls there that -he told me his
story as related.

17
Ewgowra Escort Robbery.
On the morning before our depar-
ture for Sydney we got orders to
prepare for the trip. All was then
bustle and excitement amongst the
ten prisoners—washing up our tog-
gery, &o. At 4 o’clock in the after-
noon we were ordered into the cor-
ridors to get leg-ironed. Now, I
wanted particularly to take with me
a pair of pants I bad washed that
morning ; but they were not yet dry,
so I slipped them over the ones I was
wearing, and in I went to get my irons
on. When the irons were on and
securely rivited I had to hobble into
my cell. We all had single cells. 1
sat down on my blankets to contem.
plate. It was the first time I had
thus been hobbled up.
By this time the wet from the out-
side layer of trousers was penetrating
the others, and I wanted badly to
shift them. But how to do so was a
puzzle. After experimenting for a
while, I at last struck the idea, and
in less than ten minutes I had both
.pairs off. I will not weary readers
with the description of the process—
they can work the puzzle out for
themselves.
It was rather uncomfortable that
night. My poor legs ached with the
weight of the irons, and every time
I moved at all the chains would rattle
and wake me.
At 6 next morning we were called,
and I worked my two pairs of pams
on again. After breakfast we were
handcuffed in pairs, and at 8 o’clock
were marched out through the gaol
gate, where a great crowd had con-
gregated to see us.
A four-horse coach was in waiting,
surrounded by sixteen troopers. We
ten prisoners were huddled inside.
The driver was “ Long Jim,” a
man I had known for years. On the
box also were two police sub.-inspec-
tors, Sanderson and Orridge. Two
troopers eat either on the back or on
the top of the coach (I "forget which
now), and three guards rode in front,
three behind, and three on each side.
Thus escorted, the coach moved off.
I could hear my name frequently
called out amongst the crowd, for I
was a well known man in Bathurst.
We did 40 miles that day, stopping
for the night at Hartley, where the
ten of us were placed in one large
cell. Our handcuffs were taken off,
but the irons were left on.
We had not been in our cell twenty
minutes when in came a Church of
England minister. Save us from the
sort of clergyman he was 1 There is
something of the milk of human kind-
ness in the face of most ministers of
the gospel, but this man wore a re-
pulsive look, whilst a sabre cut across
his face added to the hardness of his
expression.
He commenced speaking very
roughly to us, saying we were a lot
of scoundrels and rascals to put the
country 1 to such expense, and that we
deserved punishment.
Aleck Boss, the greatest bully of
the crowd, resented these remarks.
He turned on his reverence with a
sharp and sudden question..
“ Have you come here to preach the
gospel to us ? ” he asked.
“Yes,” was tho reply from the man
of cloth,
“ Well, why not fulfil your mission
instead of abusing men in our unfor-
. tunate position ? The sooner your
legs take you out of this, the better,”
he added, rather menacingly.
“ Oh! ” says the parson, as he
turned and made off, amidst the
laughter and derision of the rest.
And that’s the last we saw of him.
That night Aleck Boss tried the
bars of the window fur a means of
escape, but was not successful.
There was the usual crowd next
morning to see us start away again
on the coach.
I was handcuffed to Williams, and
Aleck Boss was paired with Bill
Connors. As the latter two were :
at deadly enmity, there was nothing
but growling from them all the way.
We lumbered up Mount Victoria,
and at King’s stable end, on' the
Penrith side of the mountains, we met
a body of Sydney police, who had
ridden up to relieve the Bathurst
troopers —the twelve guards.
• The Sydney men were very
“ Gussie ’’-looking, *go‘. up more for
show than good use, evidently. They
wore white gloves, rode with white
reins, and looked brand new.
There was a lot of formality,
saluting, and one thing and another,
and after a delay of ten minutes or so
we got going again.
The two sub-inspectors continued
with us, also the two footmen who sat
on the coach.
Eighteen miles from Penrith, we
pulled up at a pub, and Bill Buss, the
landlord, was allowed to treat us to a
beer each. He also presented me
with a half-a pound of tobacco. For-
tunately, we always managed to have
our smokes. That was managed even
in the Bathurst gaol, for friends out-
side used to throw plugs over the
wall for us.
Arrived at Penrith, a tremendous
crowd assembled to see Us.
Again we were placed in one large
cell for the night.
Aleck Boss once more made des-
perate efforts to escape. He managed
to loosen the bars of a window, but
we persuaded him he would only get
shut up if he got out. We knew
there were sentries under the window.
Indeed, large fires were kept going
all night to afford a light in case of
an attempted escape, and the reflection
illumined our cells,
Penrith was then tho railway
terminus, having been opened only a
few years.
Next morning we were placed on a
special train, and taken to Sydney,
running right through without stop-
ping.
On reaching Bedfern there were
thousands and thousands of people
there, waiting to catch a sight of the
desperadoes, and a hundred police
were told off to keep the mob back.
Very few saw us. The prison van,
“Black Maria,”was drawn up, and
we were hustled in. '■
Inside the van were twelve eells.
A prisoner was locked up in each,
whilst a policeman paced up and
down the middle, and others sat out-
side.
At Darlinghurst I could hear the
crowd yelling, but we were driven
straight into the yard, so that no one
saw us.
During the trip down from Bedfern
station it struck me that I had a knife
in my pocket, and as I knew same
would not be allowed in gaol, I
dropped it into the street, through
the grating underfoot, which was the
only ventilation to tho dark van.
Coming down in the train from
Penrith the policeman who sat along-
side ef me was rather a good sort of a
chap He let me into a few points
about smuggling items into the cell.
For instance I did not want to part
with my smoking outfit, if it were
possible at all to avoid doing so.
Having with me two loaves of
bread, he explained how I could run
my knife under the crust, and leave
a cavity. This I did, and concealed
therein my pipe and some tobacco
and a flint and steel. A few small
pieces of tobacco I planted in the
lining of my coat, and a large piece I
kept in my hand, ready to transfer to
my mouth when the proper time
came. I retained half a plug in my
pocket purposely as a blind, antici-
pating that when the official searched
me be would come to the conclusion
that I was soft and simple, and would
not therefore suspect me of any plot
for concealing these precious luxu-
ries.
On dismounting from “ Black
Maria ” we were marched in our irons
down a flight of steps to the Gover-
nor’s office, which was underground.
There our names and descriptions were
taken as we were handed over to his
care. By another flight of steps we
were marched up to the visiting room,
where all the prisoners were searched.
This business was performed by a
turnkey named Carroll. (He was
afterwards shot by the Clarkes near
Braidwood.)
, “ May I keep the two loaves, sir ? ”
I asked Carroll.
“ sTes,” says ho, handing the two
loaves back to me, after he had broken
the two apart to satisfy himself I had
nothing there in secreted. I felt re-
leived. He had not discovered my
little plant.
Our irons were struck off, and
Carroll led the way to the bath-
house.
Passing through a yard, I recog-
nised, among the prisoners, several
men I had formerly known on the
Lachlan.
At the bath-house we had the choice
of a hot or cold plunge or a cold
shower, and an old prisoner was told
off to attend on us.
As I got under my shower I drew
my plug of tobacco from my mouth
and laid it on the edge of the bath,
picking it up again when finished,
and not dreaming that this man was
going to put me away. But he did,
for when I was returning Carroll
stopped me, asking what I had con-
cealed in my mouth.
“ Tobacco," says I, drawing the
plug from my mouth.
- “ Oh, well,” says he, “as you speak
up so plainly you can keep it. I
thought,” he added with a grin, “it
might be a kit of tools for breaking
away with!”
We were then marched off to our
cells. I was put in along with Bow
and Fotdyce.
At noon we were marched off into
the corridor for dinner, and I sat
down to my first dinner in Darling-
hurst. There were thirty of us seated
around a long table—all committed
men.
We had to wait nearly three
weeks for our trial before the special
commission.
In the meantime 1 had sent word
to my Sydney relatives to arrange for
the defence of Bow, Fordyce, and
myself ; and they secured the services
of Mr. (afterwards Sir) James Martin
(subsequently Attorney-General) and
Mr. Isaacs (subsequently Solicitor-
General).
Mr. Forbes was the instructing
solicitor, and he used to visit us in
our cell.
Manns did not bother about a de-
fending counsel, for he contemplated
trying to prove an alibi.
The escort men were dealt with in
a different court from the bushranging
prisoners, but I will briefly relate
their fate prior to opening up our own
cases. 1
The two Boss brothers and Bill
Connors, for sticking up a publican
at Pepper’s Creek, near Bathurst, were
sentenced to death.
I remember Aleck Boss coming and
speaking to us through the rails, and
telling us what their penalty was.
He was crying like a child ; and, as
he moved off, he bade us good bye.
This is how Aleck, the bully of the
ten prisoners from Bathurst, broke
up; the other two walked to their
cells without a word.
Connors’ sentence was afterwards
altered to “ life," it being proved that
he had not fired a shot; but the two
brothers were in due course hanged.
Aleck had, near the last, pretended
madness, but it didu’t act. He had
to face the inevitable doom.
George Williams, the young man
who stuck up the Cowra-Carcoar mail,
and got away with £1,500, was sen-
tenced to ten years’ penal servitude.
Jack Heally got a similar sentence
for his affair with the hawker on the
Weddin Mountains.
Harry Passy, for his highway
business at Mount Victoria, was let
off with eight years.
None of these six men have I ever
seen or heard of since.
We four escort men put in our
appearance on the 3rd February,
1863, before Mr. Justice Wise.
The Attorney-General was Mr,
Hargreaves, instructed by Mr. W.
Butler, who afterwards attained the
Attorney-Generalship.
When the oases were called, Manns
applied for a postponement of his, in
order that he might have an oppor-
tunity of producing certain evidence.
The Attorney-General made strong
objections, but his. Honor acceeded to
the request.
Bow, Fordyoe, and myself were
then charged with that we did, on
the 15th June, 1862, at Eugowra,
assault, with arms —to wit, guns,
pistols, • and revolvers —and pat in
fear and peril of their lives, one
James Oondell, one Andrew Moran,
one William Haviland and one John
Fagan ; and did steal from their pos-
session four boxes, the property of
the Queen, ten bags, containing
2,719 ounces of gold and £3,700 in
notes, the property of the Sydney
Commercial Banking Company ; and
certain rifles and cloaks, the property
of the Queen, and sundry chattels, the
propetry. of the aforesaid James
Oondell, William Haviland, and John
Fagan; and that we did, im-
mediately before such robbery,
feloniously wound James Cohdell.
A second count in the indictment
charged us with wounding at the
same time of the robbery; and a third
count charged us with wounding
immediately after the robbery.
Plea, not guilty.
The court was crammed with
spectators, and there were crowds
outside, an exciting interest ’ being
taken in the trial.
Whilst 1 was boing taken through
the tunnel from the gaol to the court-
house one of the guards jobbed me
twice in the neck, saying, “ You will
be hanged, you scoundrel, for shoot-
ing the police.”
On reaching the court I reported
the affair, and henceforth I was
treated well while going to an fro. $
As the jury were called I objected
to every man who looked like a big
business man, leaving on all who
looked like publicans. In all, 1
challenged eighteen, and the Grown
Prosecutor eight.
The first to give evidence was Sir
Frederick Pottinger. It was princi-
pally as to the arrest.
Inspector Sanderson followed,
telling about the recovery of 1,300
ounces of gold, after the exciting
pursuit of the gang from the top of
the Whoogo Mountains.
Constable Moran and Sergeant
Oondell, two of the police who were
on the coach when it was stuck, up
(the other, Haviland, was accidentally
killed next day), gave a version of the
attack by the bushrangers.
John Fagan, the coach-driver, gave
corroborative evidence, and produced
his hat with a bullet hole in it.
(Fagan is now a well-to-do squatter
near Oarcoar, and I believe he still
keeps that hat, and shows it as a
memento of the old days.)
But the evidence on which most
interest centred was that of Dan
Charters, who had turned approver,*.
It does not tally with my version of
things, but I will leave my readers
to pass their own judgdment
upon it.
(To be continued.)


18.
The Bushrangers.
BEFORE THE SPECIAL
COMMISSION.
I am not undertaking to now re-
produce Dan Charters’ evidence from
memory, after a lapse of so many
years, but will extract same from a
publication by Mr. 0. White, the
depositions in the trial being therein
produced.
It will be seen by the evidence that
Charters would not give the proper
names of the men he reckoned he
knew only by the names of “ Charlie ”
nd “ Billy.” They were, redpec-
'ly, Ben Hall and Johnny
jally. The “ Harry ’’ was Harry
.anns, whom witness swore to as
one of the gang.
Having entered the witness box
and been sworn to speak “ the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth,” Charters proceeded to tell bis
story as follows :
1 lived at Humbug Creek, on the
other side of the Lachlan. In the
beginning of June last I was within
25 miles of Forbes. It was on the
15th of June. 1 know the prisoners.
Ss.’S- John Bow and Fordyoe on the
12th June. They were within a
quarter of a mile of Mrs. Fheely’s
station, called the Pinnacle. 1 was
driving some horses. I met Frank
Qafdiner, John Gilbert and the two
prisoners, Bow and Fordyoe. Gardi-
ner is a bushranger in that part of the
country. They were coming towards
me. Gardiner rode up to me, about
fifteen yards in advance of the others.
He asked me where I was going to,
and I said to my sister’s. He then
said a he wanted me to go with him
for a few days. 1 said I could not,
for if seen with him 1 should be
thought as bad as him. He said I
must go, as he wanted me to show
him the road to some place that he
did not name. Gardiner was armed.
He had a double-barreled gun slung
to his horse, and two revolvers on his
person. Gilbert was armed, and
1 Fordyoo was also arsaod. When I
declined going with him Gardiner put
his hand ou his revolver, and said,
“ I’ve some for you, and you must
go.” I then went with him. We
went towards John Green’s place.
When we came there Gardiner sent
Gilbert for some oats.' Next morn,
ing (Friday) Gardiner said we had
to go in the direction of Forbes, and
camp there. Afterwards we went on
within a mile and a half of the police
camp at Forbes. I was driving four
horses to my sister’s when Gardiner
met me. We camped again. Gilbert
went into Forbes. I heard Gardi-
ner tell him to fetch six double-
barreled guns, some rations, an
American tomahawk, some blacking,
some comforters, and some caps;
also a flask of powder. The men
were at this time camped at a fire,
lying down, Gilbert returned about
• 1 or 2 in the morning. He had three
other men with him. One of them,
“ Charley,” I had some knowledge
of; One was called “Harry,” and
tho other “ Billy.” I saw Harry in
‘the police office, Sydney, since.
Gardiner said shortly afterwards that
no man’s name was to be mentioned,
but it did not matter about him.
When the men came they had six
guns and other articles which were
seat J for. They had some rations
also, and we consumed part of them.
Heard Gilbert say he had great
trouble in getting the guns and the
axe, as there was only one store
where he could get them. One of the
guns, with a rifle barrel and nice
carved stock, Gardiner chose for him-
self, On the Saturday morning
Gardiner said, “ Go on to the Eugowra
mountain.” As we reached the river
near Boberts’ station I saw
a gentleman on the other side
of the river whom I knew
to be Mr. Rutherton. I was not
armed. I was mounted, and led a
-horse. We cantered across a piece
of ground towards the river, and in
doing so Gilbert lost his revolver. He
wanted to return to look for it, but
Gardiner would not let him, saying
there was no time to lose. Gilbert
cut down the fence, at Roberts’s, and
we went on towards Eugowra.
Gardiner rode mostly behind the
others. I asked him where we were
going and he said he’d tell me by and
bye. We camped on Saturday night
between -Eugowra and Campbell’s.
On the Sunday Gardiner rose early,
and ordered the arms to be loaded. I
asked him what he was going to do,
and he said we’d see; that if he was
lucky, he meant that day to stick up
tho escort. (The witness here identi-
fied the prisoner Manns as one of the
men concerned). I saw Gardiner
load the pieces. - He put seven or
eight revolver balls in each gun barrel.
We had for breakfast lobsters and
sardines that were brought by Gilbert.
The blacking was used in disguising
the faces on Sunday morning. Only
two were blackened. Gardiner said
the blacking was no good, and would
not do. We crossed the creek, and
went on to the Eugowra mountains.
When within half a-mile Gardiner
looked at the rations and said there
would not be enough to bring us back.
He asked me where we could get a
supply, and I told him there was a
shanty at the crossing place at
Eugowra, where some might be got.
Harry was then sent on there, and
returned with some gin, Old Tom, a
large, loaf and a bone of meat. We
went to the mountain. We tied our
horses up, by the direction of Gardi-
ner. We each had a gun. Then we
went to the large rooks oVer-looking
the road. We remained a short time.
Gardiner went down the road, stepped
the distance, returned, and said,
“ That will do.” At about 3 o’clock
some one said it would be a lark to
get the escort horses to ’ take them
back. It was then suggested that
someone should go back and look to
the horses we had left tied up. I
proposed to go back, and after Gar-
diner studied for a while, he said,
“ Very well, you go ; you’re
frightened of your life, and you’re
the best to go.” I said I had never
done anything of the kind, and did
not like firing on men who had never
done me any harm. I then, went
away, leaving seven men at the rocks,
of whom Fordyoe and Bow were two.
Fordyce' was under the influence of
drink. Two or three times Gardiner
said if he did not wake up and look
sharp he’d only out his ret ions
short. I went and found the horses
all right. While away I heard firing
—several discharges. The men re-
turned with some gold boxes, some
rifles, and a cloak. The gold was
placed on horses. Gardiner made
tho remark that it was a very narrow
escape. I saw the cloak. I noticed
that it had a bullet hole in the cape.
This is the same cloak. I have not
seen it till to-day since. I saw it at
the rocks when the men came back.
Gardiner said, " Get ready and make
for where we camped last night.”
We came on a piece of clear
ground, about a mile and
a half near the creek, when
Gardiner said, “ We’ll stop. Open
these gold boxes, and lighten the loads
of the horses.” The boxes were
opened with a a tomahawk. We all
had a hand in the opening. I saw
the gold bags and the money‘taken
out of the boxes. We left the boxes
there, and we burnt some of the red
comforters we had used in disguise
in the attack. We packed the gold
afresh on one of the escort horses and
on Gardiner’s own horse. We then
went on. We travelled towards the
Lachlan road. This was in the dark.
We came on the road close by the
creek. We went about 300 yards
along the road, then turned off and
came on it again. We again turned
off, and we did not get on the road
afterwards till we came to Clements’
station, when we came to the fence. I
made for the slip-panel, and we
crossed the river. After that we
camped on the bank and made a
small fire at the foot of a gum tree.
Here the mail letters were opened. I
forgot to say that the guns were re-
loaded when we reached where the
gold boxes were opened. Fordyce’s
gun was found to be loaded, but the
caps were off. Gardiner swore at
him, and said, “ You were afraid to
fire, but I’ll stop your rations.”
This was near Eugowra, where the
gold boxes were opened. 1 think
each man reloaded his own gun. We
camped only a short time there. It
was about nine miles from the place
where we opened the boxes to where
we camped that night. The place
where we opened the boxes was 2
miles from the scene of the attack.
We crossed the river about 12 at
night. We did not stay more than 2
hours. The registered letters were
opened by the light of the fire. I
heard Gilbert say, “ Here’s £6,” as
he put some notes in his pockets
We had some refreshments here—
part of what Harry bad brought
when going to tho rock. After leav-
ing this we went over to Newall’s,
where Harry got some cans-of oysters
and sardines, two loaves of bread,
and some gin. We left the large
box at the foot of the gum tree. On
leaving, Gardiner said, “Go as crooked
as you can, so as to bother the
trackers.” We went on till we saw
some drays, when we turned off and
came to the gate of Mr. Suttor’s
station. Wo went through and travel-
led about half-a-mile, till we
saw another small fire. We again
turned off. The pack horses were
going two and two. I was leading
the former hors*. We went on by
direction of Gardiner till we came
within a few miles of Forbes, when
daylight arrived. Gardiner said,
“ Make for the Wheogo Mountain.”
We went on past Wheogo house, and
reached the top of the mountain,
where we camped about 2 p.m. on
the Monday. This place was 60
miles from the place where the
robbery was done. After camping
Gardiner went down to some rocks
and brought back a pair of scales,
some weights, and some grog. We
remained there for that evening. On
Tuesday night it rained. We rigged
a tent with a blanket. We weighed
the gold, rigging up three sticks to
hold the scales. I assisted, along
with the others. As Gardiner weighed
the gold, he put it on a newspaper on
a sheepskin. He also counted the
notes. I heard him say there were
£3,561 in notes. He weighed the gold
off in lots, and said there was about
221bs weight for each man. Each
man’s share was put up in lota.
Gardiner shared out the gold and
notes. We gave Harry and the other
strange men their share. They
packed it up, and strapped it on a
police cloak or lining. Gardiner said
to Gilbert, “ You had better go down
to McGuire’s.and tell him to send me
some rations enough for two or
three days.” (It was Brown’s he
went to.) I allude to prisoner at the
bar. McGuire lived close to the
place where we were camped. I did
not see McGuire on the occasion, nor
had I seen him since I joined with
Gardiner. Gilbert went away in the
direction of Hall’s. Gilbert was
absent for about two hours. He re-
turned with some rations in a large
dish, and he had a tin can with some
tea. We bad something to eat there.
I saw tea taken out of the can
at the camp. After we had some-
thing to eat the three strange men—
Harry, Billy, and Charlie—packed up
their gold in a police cloak or in the
lining. They got on their horses and
went away. They took their guns
with them. Harry said be was going
to the Lachlan . to look after some
bullocks he had left there. I did not
see Harry again until I saw him on
Tuesday at tho Central Police Court.
We remained at tho camp until the
Wednesday morning, Gardiner and
I did not leave the mountain. Bow,
Fordyce, and Gilbert went after horses
on Wednesday, and brought them
up. On Thursday we got ready to
start. Gardiner said he wished he
had another pair of saddle bags, and
asked Gilbert to go and see if McGuire
had some. (It was to Hall’s, not to
my place, that Charters, not Gilbert,
went.) Hall had told them previously
that they could get them. It was
from there that the police galloped
after Charters to the mountain. He
went away, but returned very shortly
afterwards, in a fright, saying that
as he came near McGuire’s (Hall’s)
he saw a lot of police coming from the
direction of Hall’s (McGuire’s). After
that we all got ready. We could hear
the hoof beats of the, police horses
coming up the mountains. We left
the bottles and several other things;
we had no time to shift them. We
were then five in number—myself,
Gardiner, Gilbert, Fordyce, and Bow.
We travelled through some thick
scrub. Gardiner had got off his horse
to take a drink of spirits and water,
when I heard the police horses behind
us. Gardiner was with me. I looked
back and saw what I thought was a
blaokfellow on a white horse. He
.wasabout 400 yards, behind me. I
could just see him through the scrub.
I pointed him out to Gardiner. He
said, “ Oh, , here they are! ” I
then cantered away. Gardiner called
to me .and told me not to go away
that way. Gilbert went in one direc-
tion, Fordyoe in another. Gardiner
was prodding his pack horse with the
end of his gun to urge him along. At
last, finding he could not get him
along, he left him. This was in a
very scrubby place close to the Wed-
din mountains. Gardiner galloped
after me and said, ■ “ Pull up.” He
said he had lost the gold, and it was
a bad job. He asked me to go back,
as they might miss the pack horse.
We turned, and looking through the
scrub, saw three men, on foot, catch-
the horse. Gardiner then said,
“ We’ll get on to Nowlan’a at Wed-
din mountain.” I went to Nowlan’s.
There were several persons there.
Amongst others were Johnny Walsh
and Nolan and his son. Shortly after
I was there Nowlan said the escort
had been robbed. Bow and Fordyoe
came in. I asked Nowlan for some
cations, and said they were for a
friend. I told Bow and Fordyce
where Gardiner was secreted, and
they went to him. Afterwards they
came up. I saw my horse going to-
wards the water, and I went and got
him and bade Gardiner, “ Good-bye.”
He called me back and said, “ Here’s
£5O. It’s all I can give you now.
We’ve lost the gold, and made such
a bad job of it.” Bow lived at
Nowlan’a. When I left Nowlan’s I
went homewards. I had known Bow
for about two years. Gardiner did
not go in with me to Nowlan’s. They
were at meals when I went in. I did
not see Bow after 1 left Nowlan’s
until I came into Forbes. I only saw
the guns loaded twice. My gun was
only loaded once. It was never dis-
charged. It was loaded on the Sun-
day morning. I did not remember '
all my evidence when I was first
examined at Bathurst. I gave my
evidence at first, and subsequently
added what I had forgotten. Ido not
remember the date when I first gave
evidence. 1 think it was in Septem-
last. I signed my name to the deposi-
tions 1 gave respecting this (Use. L had
seen Gardiner playing cards at
McGuire’s (Charter’s) place before
this.
In cross-examination by Mr. Martin,
Charters said : 1 have been in the
colony about 18 years, aud have lived
at Burrowa, where I have a station,
with 800 head of cattle, half of them
being my own and half my sister’s.
I have some land—cannot say how
much—but do not hold a license from
the Grown for my station. There has
been no increase in the stock on the
station since it belonged to me. I
became acquainted with Bow and
Fordyoe when 1 first took up the
station, and I have known them ever
since. It is about 13 years since I
first knew Gardiner. I have known
him to bo a bushranger for about 18
months. Have only' known him to
speak to for about six months. About
six months before this affair, I first
spoke to him, at McGuire’s, when he
was introduced to me as Frank
Gardiner, and he asked me to have a
glass of grog with him. I did so.
Stayed about an hour, and left him
with McGuire. The next time I saw
him it was in another place. He .had
been out sticking-up eyeryone he
came across on the road. His mate
came to the house first, with his
horse, and the police were after him.
Gardiner came in at the back of the
house, and the police sergeant saw
him. There were some police horses
there, and pointing to one of them,
and presenting a revolver, he said to
me, “ Bring me that horse. You
had better bring it quick.” I brought
the horse, and he rode off. I saw
him at Wheogo, and went up to the
house to ask him for a drink.
Gardiner saw some people there, and
rode away. Nothing passed between
us on that occasion. I saw him
several times afterwards, principally
at McGuire’s. I was pressed into this
escort affair. . I declined to go, but
he said he would make me. He
made me. That was on Thursday
afternoon. I remained with him
until the Sunday, at 3 o’clock, when
the robbery was committed. At that
time wo had travelled about 40 miles.
On the Friday night we camped
within a. mile and a half from _ the
police camp at Forbes, I could' not

The Bushrangers.
BEFORE THE SPECIAL COM-
MISSION.
The examination of Charters oc-
cupied a very long time, and bis evi-
dence was listened to with the greatest
pesible interest by all parties in
court.
The next witness called was a man
named Thomas Eiohards (alias
Matthews), a cordial manufacturer,
living at forbes. He was called chiefly
to prove my connection with the other
prisoners.
However, the fact that I was set at
liberty at the conclusion of the trial is
sufficient to prove that his evidence
was not taken for granted. He had
contradicted himself in several in-
stances.
Now this man, giving evidence
against me, proved how ungrateful he
was, as on several occasions I had
given him food and money for his
poor wife and children, who were
nigh starving.
He used to be often with the
“ Darkie ” (Gardiner). They used to
do a little cattle duffing together, at
Lambing Elat and Fish Giver.
Mr. Martin’s address to the jury in
in defence of the prisoners whs a very
vigorous one. His first contention
was that the prosecution had failed to
prove that a true wound had been in-
flicted upon any of the persons com-
prising the escort.
His Honor interposed, and? said if
that were the case he should recall
Sergeant Gondell.
Mr. Martin strongly protested against
or the Crown re-opening the case for
the prosecution, which had been closed
on the previous day.
But the judge ordered Condell to be
called.
That witness was not to be found
just then, however, and business was
suspended while messengers were
sent out in search of him.
After waiting some time, and
Condell not appearing, the Judge said
he had found in his notes (hat Condell
had sworn that a bullet had entered
one side and come out the other, and
that the wound had bled; and that
evidence he must send to a jury as
proof that a true wound had been in-
flicted.
Then Mr. Martin resumed, making
a point of the re-opening of the case
for the Crown in the manner described,
and seeking to work upon the sym-
pathies of the jury. Upon Charters,
the approver, he was very severe,
ridiculing the idea that he had been
pressed against his well into Gar-
diner’s service, and denouncing him
as a cowardly accomplice, giving evi-
dence in the hope of obtaining a
reward. Pointing out contradictory
passages in Charters’ evidence, he
passed on to show that his statements
had not been corroborated, except by
another accomplice, Bichards. He
urged that it was therefore not to be
believed.
This address was followed by one
in reply by the Attorney-General,
and by the Judge’s summing up, and
then the jury retired to consider their
verdict. '
But there was some difficulty in the
way, and the twelve “good men and
true ” could not agree. Hours passed
away, and the anxious prisoners were
kept in-suspense until next morning,
when the jury, who had been locked
up* all night (having told the judge
at midnight that they could not
arrive at a verdict), were called into
court.
“ Gentlemen of the jury,” said the
Associate, “ have you agreed upon
your verdict ? ”
“No,” said the foreman; “and there
is no possibility of our agreeing.”
Previous to discharging the jury,
the Judge sent a message to the Chief
Justice, asking what to do.
His Honor then discharged the
jury, and the prisoners were taken
back to the gaol, there to remain until
the authorities were prepared to
again place them on their trial.
Meanwhile the witnesses were kept
in Sydney, hundreds of miles from
home, while the numerous friends of
the prisoners who had gone thither
to hear the trial also prepared them-
selves for a lengthy stay.
But after a lapse of a fortnight we
were put on our trial again.
The same evidence was gone
through.
At this trial we had only one
barrister, Mr. Isaacs.
The four of us were arraigned.
Manns and myself were both unde-
fended, but Mr. Isaacs came to me in
the dock and said that he would not
see tie thrown over, but would plead
for mo. And so he did, very hard.
The Attorney-General opened the
case at great length, and after stating
what evidence would be adduced, said
that he believed the jury would come
to the conclusion he had come to, that
in a case of this kind the uncor-
roborated evidence of Charters might
be taken, as he had undoubtedly been
with the prisoners under compulsion
(he was never compelled), having
been compelled by Gardiner to act as
guide.
Detective Lyons, after detailing
ths particulars of the arrest of Manns,
stated that Manns said to him, “ I
suppose you wonder where I got the
gold . and money f ” “ Yes,” replied
Lyons, “ I asked you that when I
arrested you.” Manns then said,
“Well, wait till my mates come up,
and they’ll soon let you know.”
Shortly after the rescue was effected,
and Lyons’ horse bolted with the
money and his revolvers, and neither
horse nor property were afterwards
seen by the police.
Then Charters was again put into
the box, and repeated his story,
varying very little ‘from that told by
him on his first trial, but giving
several additional details, and enter-
ing more into particulars concerning
the route taken by the robbers in
their flight from the scene of the
robbery.
Cross-examined by Mr. Isaacs he
said : I have not any expectation of
being pardoned if the prisoners are
convicted. I swear I know nothing
about it. 1 1 do not believe I shall be
pardoned. I swear I do not know
whether I shall be tried or not on
this charge. I do not know what
the law is. I do not expect to be
set free if the result of this trial is a
conviction. I may be kept until
others are caught. I do not know
if at any time I shall be set free in
consequence of the prisoners. I ex-
pected to be tried for this offence first.
I swear that no official has said to me
that it would be better for me if I
gave evidence on this trial. It has
not been suggested to me that if I did
not give evidence, Ben Hall might,
and that then I should be implicated.
I have cot bean at liberty since I
first gave evideuue as to this robbery.
I have been in custody ever since,
and for the most part confined to the
Sydney lockup. I have heard that
it is usual for a pardon to be given
to the party who gives evidence lead-
ing to conviction. I saw it announced
in the proclamation that a pardon
would be given to an accomplice. I
don’t know whether it was put up
by the Government or by a private
party as a joke. Have not any be-
lief about it, but suppose it was a
Government notice. I solemnly
swear I cannot say whether I saw
the placard before or after my appre-
hension. During the whole time I
was with Gardiner I never tried to
make my escape. Have never seen
Gilbert since the Thursday I parted
with Gardiner, I expect I shall be
kept in confinement, whether I am
tried or not.
Mr. Isaacs having resumed his
seat, the Chief Justice proceeded to
question Charters, who, in reply to
the questions put, said: 1 was
examined on oath at Bathurst, and I
have been twice examined in this
court. I was born in the North of
Ireland, and am 25 years of age. I was
a baby when I arrived.' I first lived
in Sydney. At seven or eight years
of age I went to the country. I have
lived in the Bathurst and Burrowa
districts. My father is dead about
two years, my mother is alive. I
have four sisters, one at the Pinnacle,
one at my mother’s, one at the
Lachlan Biver, and one near Bathurst.'
Have bean a stock-owner all my life.
Have looked after my sister’s cattle,
and my own. My sister’s station is a
large, one. I suppose she has in all
about 2,000 head of cattle. I have
600 head of my own, if they were all
collected. I can read and write.
Cannot write well, I have been to
school. Went to school in Sydney
when I was a little boy. Can say
my prayers, and do My them I have
often attended a place of worship. I
frequently do. When the weather
was fine I used often to go to my
sister’s, and go to church with her.
I firmly believe in the existence of
a God. I believe in a future state of
reward and punishment.
The Chief Justice: What on earth,
then, could induce you to associate
yourself with Gardiner J
Mr. Isaacs: I beg respectfully to
suggest to your Honor that the wit-
ness has already answered that ques-
tion. He has stated that he was com-
pelled by Gardiner to accompany
him.
The Chief Justice: Have you
any objection to make to the question?
If so, what is it f
Mr. Isaacs: il admit that your
Honor has a right to put the question,
but I submit that the question has
been put already by myself, and that
it has been answered by the prisoner.
The Chief Justice: And I wish to
put the same question, and have the
answer again. Is there any objection
to that ?
After some remarks from Mr. Isaacs,
his Honor said be should not press
further, though he felt he would
be justified in doing so.
On, Thursday at the opening of the
Court, Mr. Isaacs addressed the jury
on behalf of the prisoners—Bow,
Fordyce, and myself.
At the conclusion of the learned
counsel's address the court adjourned
for a tittle time, and his Honor then
proceeded to sum up.
Having minutely sifted the evidence,
he told the jury they would, of course,
give the prisoner the benefit of any
donbt that existed, but he thought
that the meaning of this phrase was
at times misunderstood. There was a
difference between what was implied
as a doubt in civil cases to criminal
cases. In civil cases, on whichever
side the evidence preponderated, to
that side they must give their verdict.
If the doubt between two parties tremb.
led in the balance, then a jury would
retire to scrutinise it minutely. But,
still, if this scale turned ever so
lightly, they fonnd in favor of the pre-
ponderating evidence. Not so, how-
ever, in criminal cases. In these, if
there was any preponderance against
the prisoners, they would at once find
a verdict of guilty. If, however, the
evidence, or the belief in the evidence,
should tremble in the balance, they
would not pursue the inquiry further.
They would not give it more scrutiny,
but acquit the prisoners. He did not
agree that their verdict should be
affected by the result that might
ensue. If the evidence was clear
against the prisoners, whether a
minor or a capital, the duty of the
jury was Dl* : n. But he agreed that
where death might follow, it would
induce a mere careful consideration
and a more minute weighing of the
evidence. All considerations of
mercy, humanity, or kindness were,
however, against the province of the
jury. With these observations, he
would leave the case in their hands.
The jury retired at a quarter be.
fore 8 o’clock. At a quarter to 10
the Chief Justice returned. Great
excitement prevailed about the doors,
and on the court being opened great
eagerness was exhibited in securing
places to hear the finale of the trial.
The jury being again brought into
court, the foreman said that they had
agreed upon a verdict of guilty, on
the first count, against Alexander
Fordyce, John Bow, and Henry
Manns, and of not guilty for myself,
I was therefore removed from the
dock, in custody, the governor of the
gaol stating, in answer to the Chief
Justice, that there was another charge
agaiust me—an execution for bail for
Youngman, who, by the bye, was
never retaken.
The three prisoners, who had been
found guilty, were asked if they had
anything te say why sentence should
not be passed upon them
Alexander Fordyce said he was not
guilty of wounding at the time of the
robbery.
Henry Manns said he had nothing
to say, only he was not guilty of the
charge.
John Bow said the jury had found
a verdict of guilty against an inno-
cent man.
His Honor then, addressing the pri-
soners, Manns, Bow, and Fordyce,
said: “It is my painful duty to pass
upon you sentence of death. Henry
Manns, though sorry to add to your
distress, I must say that it is imposs-
ible to avoid remarking that you are,
by document before the Court, self-
convicted of perjury. During the
time of your trial the case has been
most clearly proved against you. No
man can doubt that you are guilty.
You have almost intimated a desire to
plead guilty, and that for the purpose
of securing the escape of Bow and
Fordyce, by asserting that they were
not present at the robbery, and
having two others arraigned in their
place, apparently in order to cast dis-
credit upon the testimony of the pre-
sent informer (Charters), and having
some kind of revenge on him. But of
what value would yonr oath hare been
when it was known that you stated on
oath that if time were given, you could
prove, by the evidence of your father,
and three members of your family,
that you were not the person present
at the robbery, nor the person on
whom the gold was found. They have
not come forward. They would not
perjure themselves, and now, at a
last resource, you freely admit that yon
are guilty. The jury were quite en-
titled to believe the testimony on
which you were all throe convicted;
and I am informed that the general
belief in the country is that the testi-
mony is true. I believe it to be true.
There is this wickedness clearly proved
against Manns, that he designed by
perjury to declare Bow and Fordyce
innocent. And as to the crime itself
you must know that no Government
on earth, having regard to the security
and peace of the country, to the livsa
and property of .its unoffending sub-
jects, could extend towards it anything
like what is falsely called, mercy. 1
agree in the opinion that there is more
mercy due to the community, to the
helpless and unoffending, than to
those who stand convicted of crime.
It is too much the habit to lavish pity
on criminals, in forgetfulness of the
outrages of which they hare been the
authors. Some consideration is due
to the police, who expose their lives in
the discharge of their duty to the inter-
est of the community ; in security
of the produce from the goldfields,
where there are some ruffians, no
doubt, but also many hardworking,
honest, industrious men, having wives
and children - dependent on them.
See to what a state of things this
lawlessness has reduced us! Here is
a proprietor of cattle who joined a
band of ruffians to rob, to wound the
innocent, to kill them unless merciful
Providence had prevented.* There is
a nest of ruffians about the Weddin
Mountains, and there seems to be
scarcely one abont that place who is
not willing to join robbers in their
crime. Is it not a crime demanding
repression by all means at the hands
of the Government? For the com-
mittal of this crime seven or eight
men banded together. It was long
meditated. You came unawares at
your fellowmin. and shot at them.
If they had been dogs, they couid not
have been shot at with more cold-
bloodedness and cruelty. Some of
them were shot down by men banded
together for lawless purposes. No
man can doubt that you deserve the
punishment the law affixes to such an
offence. It is not for me to say the
law will take its course, but I cannot
conceive on what ground the Judge
could say that such a sentence should
not take its course. If mercy is to be
shown in such case the law ought to
be altered. There would be an end
of all .society. It would then bo
simply the rule of force. The
strongest would take from another
whatever he chose. I believe the
punishment to be just. Men do dread
death; but they cannot expect im-
punity. There is a common impres-
sion than an accomplice will not be
believed. This day the world will see
that the evidence of an accompliee,
if it hangs together as a true story,
will be believed by a jury of honest
men who boldly do their duty. It is
not merely the danger of the people,
but the character of the community
in the eyes of the world is at stake.
The scenes that occur in this colouj
would be shocking to read of in any
country. I believe that in oases of
this kind of- deliberately-planned
robberies, with cruelty and attempts
at bloodshed, the only penalty men
are likely to fear at all is death. If
the Legislature does not think so, the
Legislature must alter the law, but I
have only to carry the law out as it
is. I can feel for you as men, but if
the taking of your lives should render
the country more secure from such
deeds of violence, the cause of hu-
manity will be promoted by your
extinction. Here was a reckless,
bloody, murderous onslaught upon
innocent men. While deeply feeling
for you, I feel the interests of society
are paramount, and must be defended.
The sentence of the court is that you
be each of you taken hence to the
place from whence you came, and
thence, at a day appointed by the
Executive Government, to the place
of execution, there to be each of you
hanged by the neck till you are dead.
And may the Lord have mercy on
your souls. • •
