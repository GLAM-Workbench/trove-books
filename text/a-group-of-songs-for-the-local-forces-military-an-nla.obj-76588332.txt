INTRODUCTORY POEM
DEFENSIVE WAR.
Defensive war is just! Let righteous wrath
m
Form into holy purpose, to withstand
The will of any hostile Tyrant-power,
Which dares to threaten, with invading hordes.
Our homes and liberties, our towns and fields!
But then such purpose should be only held.
When fair hope, for resistance, doth appear
To give good prospect of a bright success;
And warlike skill is here of course required.
So military leaders must be found.
And it is well to have such aid on hand.
Beady for what may come; but men, well-trained.
By discipline, and in the tactic movements.
Are needed to oppose an enemy;
Knowledge of arms, alike of small and great.
Practice in steady marching, hardihood
Of frame, as is obtained by temperance.
And exercise in the athletic courses;
Such are the right material for service.
So as to lay foundation, true and solid.
For perfect masterdom of Soldier-Art.
Our young communities have been forewarned.
And now are roused up to this duty plain.
Let all who have an influence in each State,
Strive to maintain, in full efficiency.
A Local Force, as nucleus of defence.
And rallying centre for a rise en masse !


SONG OF THE AUSTRALIAN VOLUNTEERS
Armed for defence of all held dear.
Loved friends, sweet homes, and fields.
We proudly form, in duty?s sphere.
Our Country?s living shields !
Chorus ?Guarding our Australian Land,
Ranks closed up and steady.
If foes come, we ?ll line the strand.
With our rifles ready.
Aggressive war is not our claim.
Nor fighting purpose shown.
Unless invading foes should aim
To rob us of our home /
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
Ay, let them come, across the wave.
We?ll meet them on the shore !
Our soil will yield the foes a grave,
A deep death-trench ?no more.
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
Trained by firm discipline and drill.
We?ll boldly take the field.
Led on by officers of skill.
Powers of command to wield;
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
Our mounted comrades on the flanks;
Artillery, central key.
To open way for charging ranks.
Who?ll force the foe to flee.
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
No power shall take from us our right!
We form of Britain part;
Our Empire grand ! where freedom?s light
Cheers every loyal heart.
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
Allegiance, to the Parent State,
Is due, and such we own;
May God still bless, with favor great.
Our England?s Queen and Throne !
Chor us ?Guar ling, &c.

SONG.
FOR AN AUSTRALIAN IRON-CLAD GUARD-SHIP.
Like mastiff, at a mansion-gate.
Crouched form, but watchful eyes.
Our floating fortress, in war-state.
At harbor-mouth now lies;
Chorus ?Guarding our Australian shore.
When war-clouds are looming,
And impends the battle-roar.
Hostile cannon booming.
When from the watch on distant height.
By wire-tongue swiftly sent.
The message comes, ? The foe in sight,'
WeTl rise at war?s portent!
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
*Up steam ! ? Our ship leaves mooring-ground.
Sea-room to gain for fight;
The crew, at * call to quarters? sound.
Stand firm in well trained might;
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
Our guns are ready for the foe.
And decks for action clear;
Our hearts with warlike spirit glow.
And hope that knows no fear;
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.
Old England?s Flag we proudly fly !
Australian Ensigns wave;
WeTl conquer, or will bravely die.
Our land from foe to save.
Chorus ?Guarding, &c.


SONG.
ARTILLERY, MILITARY AND NAVAL, OF THE LOCAL
FORCES OF AUSTRALIA.
' Guns to the front! 5 When conies the hour
Of war, with issues dread.
Swayed by the might of cannon's power.
Which is by science led.
? Guns to the front! ? In turret low.
Of guard-ship at her post,
Guns that revolve to meet the foe.
Who dares approach our Coast.
* Guns to the front ! 9 In battery placed.
Fort built with warlike skill;
By Courtesy?s salutes oft graced.
But ready for war?s will.
* Guns to the front! ? When need shall come.
Well-horsed they will appear;
Our gunners brave will fight for home.
Country, and all friends dear.
Our guns and gunners to the front!
On land. Supports will be
Eeady to share the conflict-brunt;
Both Foot and Cavalry.
On guns and gunners we rely.
At sea in naval fight.
But if a foe close quarters try.
Our crews will show their might.
Trained to the use of rifled arms.
And cutlass, weapon famed.
Our sailors prove in war?s alarms.
Their spirit is not tamed.
f Guns in reserve ! ? The Great Duke said.
Who won at Waterloo;
Wellington had a soldier?s head.
And knew what guns could do.
Guns of that day were not like ours.
Nor range so far and true;
Artillery now has giant-powers.
Growing in science view.
r Guns to the front! ? Whene?er our land
Is threatened with war-storm;
At patriot-duty?s stern command,
All Arms defence will form.

SONG.
THE CAVALRY OF THE LOCAL MILITARY FORCES OF
AUSTRALIA.
THE FIRST SUCCESS. ?A ROMANCE.
To horse, to horse ! The trumpets sound !
We muster at roll-call;
Our steeds impatient paw the ground.
When into rank we fall.
Our column moves at break of day.
To meet invading foe.
Landed at unprotected bay.
As scouts have let us know.
One troop, advancing, spread in line.
To skirmish at the front;
Main body follow to combine.
For sudden conflict brunt.
On reconnoitring service bent.
Caution is duly shown;
To gain a view, vedettes are sent.
That all the ground be known.
A carbine shot ! * Close up, four deep ! 9
The foes are just a-head;
Our squadron through their ranks shall sweep.
By our brave Captain led ;
* Draw swords ! And charge them on the flank/
f Re-form, and charge again ! 9
We onward dash, in close firm rank.
Though bullets come like rain;
The hostile vanguard were broke through.
By fierce and swift attack;
Confusion to a rout soon grew;
Our troopers at their back.
So glory to our Noble Horse,
Let verse their fame express !
And future annals of our Force,
Shall tell of ? First Success ! 5


SONG- OF A BATTLE.
A ROMANCE.
Shoulder to shoulder, steady in line.
With step measured true by bugle?s time;
Rifle or sabre in grasp of hand,
We march for defence of our Home Land !
Light troops at the front, to form the van.
Thus ever the rule in warfare plan;
As skirmishers out in order spread.
They cover the ground with cautious tread.
Field artillery move to the height.
That commands the plain away at right;
Supports of dragoons, the guns to guard.
And against surprise keep watch and ward.
Our van pushes on; the rifles? crack.
In the distance, tells of foes driven back.
To their lines entrenched, where they will wait.
For the issue stern of battle-fate.
Hark, the loud booming of cannon now !
Our guns are at work on yon hill-brow.
And their fire will tell when range is known;
Quick-march! Soon the day will be our own.
Our column deploys in battle-line;
In volleys the rifles now combine;
Then over the trench with ringing cheer!
And a glorious charge brings victory clear;
For the foe retreat, the day is won.
But the close pursuit has now begun;
Horse artillery follow at speed.
And cavalry with reserves at need.
Our Chief proudly eyes the battle-field !
Through he mourns their fate, whose blood has sealed
A oevotion grand which knew no pause.
Till they laid down life for Country?s Cause.
