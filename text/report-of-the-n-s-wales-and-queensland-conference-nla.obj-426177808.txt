•7jf% TIE New South Wales and Queensland Conference of 1890
having appointed a Committee to draw up a statement of
1 what had been done by this Conference in regard to Tonga
—which statement was to be presented to the General Confer-
ence, —this Committee met and adopted the following Report ;
The General Conference of 1888 having appointed the Rev.
George Brown as its Special Commissioner to Tonga, the New
Wales and Queensland Conference of 1889, anxious to further
the objects which the General Conference had in view, did
nothing more than act upon the recommendations which the-
Special Commissioner, on his return to Sydney, made to it. It
accordingly appointed the Rev. C. E. James to Nukualofa, to
supply the vacancy occasioned by the Rev. J. E. Moulton’s
leaving Tonga ; it continued the Rev. E. E. Crosby at Vavau,
and elected the Rev. George Brown, Chairman of the District—
whilst Mr. Moulton was appointed to one of the Sydney Circuits.
When the Special Commissioner, after another visit to Tonga,
returned and presented his Report to the New South Wales and
Queensland Conference of 1890, the Conference again loyally
acted upon the recommendations of the Special Commissioner.
The Rev. C. E. James having requested to be allowed to return
to the Colony owing to the impaired health of his wife, and
having stated that he would himself bear the expenses of his
going to and returning from Tonga, the Conference complied
with his request as recommended by the Special Commissioner,
and appointed him to a Circuit in New South Wales. To pre-
vent the Tongatabu Circuit being left vacant, it removed the
Rev. J. A Bowring from a colonial Circuit at the end of his first
year, and appointed him to Nukualofa. It also removed the
Rev. E. E. Crosby to Haabai, placing the Vavau Circuit under
his care ; and it again elected the Rev. George Brown Chairman
of the District.


The Conference further heartily endorsed the recommenda-
tions of the Special Commissioner relative to the maintenance
and strengthening of our Church in Tonga, and the desirability
of taking some action to secure the return of the exiles and the
removal of the religious disabilities to which our people are still
subject, and likewise passed resolutions with regard to the defi-
ciency due to the Rev. E. E. Crosby and the claims of the Rev.
J. E. Moulton, which will come before the General Conference in
the ordinary course of business.

AUSTRALASIAN
Wesleyan Missionary Society.
The Minutes of Meetings of the Board of Missions for the
years 1888 and 1889 having -been laid before the Annual
Conferences of 1889 and 1890, it is deemed unnecessary to
present them now in detail. The General Secretary, however,
will supply information respecting any resolution that may be
called for, and will read the minutes of the two meetings that
have been held since the Annual Conferences closed.
Review of Missions.
The General Conference of 1888 having directed “the Board
of Missions to review the work in the older Mission fields under
its care, and to consider new Mission fields which present them-
selves, in order to economize men and means in the former
Missions and make a larger expenditure in newer fields,” this
Board at different times has taken this subject into serious
consideration.
With the information supplied, however, as to the activity
and proselytising efforts of the numerous Roman Catholic pi iosts
who are seeking to establish a footing in different paits of I iji,
the Board is not prepared at present to recommend a reduction in
the number of European Missionaries in Fiji.
The work in Samoa still requires the services of 2 Mission-
aries, the number already stationed there.
In the New Britain District there have been only two
Missionaries on the ground during the year; and should inter-
ference with our agents and their work unhappily occur, it may
be wise policy not to increase the number of European Mission-
aries stationed in New Britain, but rather to enter vigorously
upon Mission work in the various groups of islands forming pai t
of the British possessions of New Guinea.
It is probable a slight saving might be effected if the Home
Missionary Society in each Colony was to have transferred to it
the Chinese work within its bounds—a small fixed grant in au
being' annually made for a specified term by the General
Missionary Society. Should this be done, a better supervision of
the Chinese agents and their work might be secured. The Board,
however, whilst inviting attention to the suggestion, refrains
from making any recommendation respecting it. A '~

The Proposed Mission to the Eastern end of British New
Guinea and the Adjacent Islands.
Information relative to this proposal, and the action taken
by the Board, is contained in the Progress Report, a copy of
which is supplied. {See page ccv.) This new enterprise is com-
mended to the favourable consideration of the General Conference.

Returned Missionaries in Colonial Work. —The amount
paid for Children’s Allowances has been :
In 1887 £502 16 0
In 1888 538 10 0
In 1889 ... ~. 495 10 0
Income.
The receipts from the Colonial auxiliaries for the year 1889
up to 31st March, 1890 (the date named by the last General
Conference), have been as follows :
From New South Wales ... £lO7l 11 1
~ Queensland ... ... 66 13 10
„ Victoria ... ... 1384 1 6
~ Tasmania ... ... 133 0 0
~ South Australia ... 250 0 0
~ New Zealand ... ... 482 15 6
The travelling expenses, &c., of the Deputation
amounted to £7O 9s. 6d.
Since this is only a little more than one-half of the income
usually received for the year, it would be highly unsatisfactory
to make up the balance-sheet from these figures. From the Ist
of April up to the 28th instant the additional receipts have
been :
From New South Wales, £769 15 9—Total, £lB4l 6 10
~. Queensland
~ Victoria ... . ■ £2OO 0 o—Total, £1584 1 6
„ Tasmania
„ South Australia...
~ New Zealand ... £37 10 2—Total, £520 5 8
The amounts received at present from Queensland, Tasmania,
and South Australia are very small. Further remittances are
expected from these colonies, and also from New South Wales
and Victoria. ,
The working of the Society would be greatly benefitted it the
receipts from the Auxiliaries were forwarded to the Mission
Office at an earlier date.
Legacies.
The following Legacies have been received :
A Friend to Missions—the late Rev. G. Stannard... £2OO 0 0
From the late Mrs. Yates, Sydney £174 17 10


From the late Mrs. Hurst-Caldwell, Goulburn ... £lOOO 0 0
From the late Mr. J. C. Williams, Bathurst ... £9l 1 9
From the late Mrs. Horton, Somercotes ... ... £lOO 0 0
By the terms of the will, Mrs. Hurst-Caldwell's legacy is to be
invested, and the annual interest paid to the current account of
the Society.
Three more instalments have been paid on account of the
legacy of the late Miss Black, of Kiama, making the total amount
received to date, £550 4s.
Returned Missionaries and Deputations.
During the year 1887 the Rev. B. Danks was set apart for
Deputation work in Victoria and Tasmania, and the following
year received an appointment to a Circuit in Victoria.
The Rev. J. D. Jory, from Fiji, after resting for a year, was
received by the New Zealand Conference" of 1889, and appointed
to a Circuit.
The Rev. W. E. Bromilow, from Fiji,' was received by the
Victoria and Tasmania Conference of 1889, and appointed to a
Circuit.
The Rev. I. Rooney, from Duke of York, returned to the
Colonies in October, 1888, and after spending a year in Deputa-
tion work in New Zealand, Victoria, and South Australia was
received by the South Australia Conference of 1890, and
appointed to a Circuit.
The grant of £l5O has been paid witli each of these mini-
sters, for the settlement of another married minister in the
Colony to which they have removed.
The Rev S. J. Gibson, from Fiji, has been received by the
New Zealand Conference of 1890 and appointed to a Circuit.
During the past year, the Revs. Thos. Williams, George
Daniel and J. H. Royce have assisted in Deputation work in
Victoria. The Rev. J. H. Royce was the Missionary Deputation in
Tasmania. The Rev. David Tonga and his wife have attended
Missionary Meetings in New South Wales.
New Missionaries.
In 1888, the Rev. W. Slade, of New Zealand, and in 1889
the Rev. W. A. Burns, of New South Wales, were appointed to
Fiji. The New South Wales Conference of 1890 lias also ap-
pointed the Rev. Thomas J. Wallis, of New Zealand, to Fiji.
Vacancies.
The station at Rotuma is still without a resident Euiopean
Missionary.
The important station of Port Hunter, Duke of York
Circuit, is also vacant.


It is feared that the Rev. R. H, Rickard, of Raluana, New
Britain, will be compelled to return during the year, owing to the
serious illness of his wife.
Publication op Missionary Intelligence.
The Board regrets that in consequence of very few letters
detailing the operations of the Agents of the Society having been
forwarded to the Mission Office, it has been impracticable to carry
out the resolution of a previous General Conference, which
directed the Board “ to take steps to issue a paper of Missionary
intelligence quarterly, or, if deemed advisable, monthly.” Pub-
licity has been given to all the Missionary information supplied.
It would doubtless be highly advantageous were the General
Conference to pass a resolution requiring each Missionary to
forward to the General Secretary a quarterly report of all the
stations in his Circuit that he visited, together with such in-
formation as would be interesting to the entire Connexion.
The General Secretary.
The General Conference of 1888 having appointed the Rev.
George Brown as its Special Commissioner to Tonga, the Board
and the Society have been deprived for lengthened periods of the
services and advocacy of Missions by the General Secretary. It
is hoped Mr. Brown will be able very shortly to resume his
usual duties. During his absence, the Rev. J. B. Waterhouse
has attended to the business of the Mission Office.
The Lay General Treasurer.
George Crawshaw, Esq., having resigned his office as one of
the General Treasurers, the New South Wales and Queensland
Conference has appointed Samuel E. Lees, Esq., M.L.A., as
General Treasurer. This provisional appointment is recom-
mended to the General Conference for confirmation.
Resolutions of the New South Wales and Qup.enland
Conference affecting Missions.
These will come before the General Conference in the
proper order of business.
