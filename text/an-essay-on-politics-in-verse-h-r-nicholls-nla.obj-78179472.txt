AN ESSAY ON POLITICS
Pi quis nunc queer at, Quo res hose pertinet ? llluc :
Dwm vilant stulti vitia, in contraries currunt.
Dunces succeed and dunces ever will,.
So long as brass can serve instead of skill;
So long as meetings roar in reason?s spite,
And vote that white is black or black is white ;
So long as moderation gives offence,
And strongest words are thought the strongest sense ;
So long as lungs, not brains, are made the test,
And he who talks the loudest talks the best.
Time was when brave men risked their lives or ears,
To shame bad monarchs and expose bad peers;
Bared ? the vile heart that lurks beneath a star,?
And showed the world what things its great ones are.
Who does not honor those who dared so speak,
And made the strong bow down before the weak 1
Who would not rather be the poet scorned,
Than be a knave by titled knaves adorned 1
Who would not rather bear a brief disgrace,
Than yield to all things with compliant face 1
Yet he, e?en here, who speaks the truth he sees,
Nor ? crooks the pregnant hinges? of his knees
To those who hold the power for the day,
And, cursing tyrants, wield a tyrant?s sway,
Is made the butt of every boisterous fool,
And braggart patriot of the newest school.
Thus crowds become the despots in their turn,
And long for faggots, if they cannot burn ;
Seek racks and thumbscrews of a newer make,
For those who still hold out for conscience sake ;
Hiss, roar, and rave, as bigots did of old,
Fearful of danger, if the truth bo told;
Till those alone are saved from all that's bad,
Who lie like fury and assert like mad.


Fools make the rogues ; and, following out the rule,
The rogue takes pains to cultivate the fool,
Till, fools and rogues combined, a dreadful band,
In one vast flood, spread over all the land.
But here let us be truthful as we can,
And say the rogue oft starts an honest man ;
He does not fall quite in a single day,
But just declines as fools prepare the way;
And falling, rises till he gains the grade,
When public life becomes a paying trade.
Hatched into life by some new local heat,
He takes the chair, perchance, when diggers meet
To air their wrongs about a license-fee,
And say their say concerning powers that be.
Or coming after stormy days had passed,
And ? vagabonds? had got some rights at last,
He joins the cry for some fresh right or wrong,
And partly follows, partly guides the throng.
At first he mounts the stump with modest air,
As wond?ring how the devil he got there,
But growing bolder every rule defies,
Til] one small truth begets a thousand lies;
But whether partly truth, or falsehood quite,
He says what?s wished for, and so says what?s right.
Pleased with his boldness, all the mob admires
The man who gives such strength to its desires,
Likes his rough style and cheers his reckless force,
And dubs him ? honest? who is only coarse.
As time rolls on, and politics invite,
Our local hero tries a higher flight;
Girds at law-makers, criticises laws,
Blackguards ? gold-lace,? ? midst thunders of applause,
Upholds ?the people?s? claims with all his voice,
And in return becomes ?the people?s? choice.
What happens then, alas! we all can tell,
Who?ve watched the tide of license swiftly swell,
Seen freedom ?broaden down? so very fast
That it becomes a stagnant pool at last;
Which brings not health and strength, but dire disease,
And noxious creatures only are at ease;
While rogue and dunce float gaily on the flood,
Or, smiling, wallow in congenial mud.
From one learn most. Though differing in place,
The same result is dear to all the race;
All keenly strive in different degrees
To say, not what is true, but what will please.


Whether some workman, just come out from home,
Big with the wrongs which helped to make him roam,
Roars to an Eastern Market crowd once more,
As he in Chartist Halls was wont to roar,
With ?slaves? and ?serfs,? a very stale rehash
Of all the agitator?s clap-trap trash :
Or whether those who led in days gone by,
Now follow meekly to a party cry,
Belie their words, forget their own advice,
And make their virtue of a public vice:
We still come back to where we first set out,
For how to please is all they care about.
Yet some there are amongst the noisy throng
Who know, or ought to know, the right from wrong;
Who once held back from flattering the crowd,
Who knew the truth, and oft the truth avowed ;
Who scorned applause, who dared the dunce?s scorn
And only dealt with rogues to make them mourn ;
Urged on by pride, or blinded by their spite,
Or warmed to work in some ignoble fight,
Now lead the van, devise new tricks of State,
With some new dodge for every new debate;
And daring all things for a crowd?s applause,
They teach the reckless to defy the laws.
So rogues who grin, and dunces who admire,
Pleased with the chance that lets them both aspire,
Mount the high stump, and flood the laud with speech,
Of lie compounded half, and half of screech.
Thus men are taught to harbor discontent,
And look for wrong where wrong was never meant;
Each distant land?s set far above our own,
Which want and crime and misery bears alone ;
Each fault is dwelt on, every vice displayed,
To form the patriot?s dirty stock-in-trade ;
Lay-sermon preachers go upon this lay,
To save their fame by taking ours away ; -
Ransack newspapers for each dire offence,
And add to want of logic, want of sense.
To California, or Idaho,
Shocked at our Sundays, all the Virtues go,
From vile Victoria beat a quick retreat,
To cluster sweetly round Judge Lynch?s seat ?
Integrity in trade shines brightly forth
Where South and West are taxed to feed the North ;
Where Wood-Screw companies the votes control,
And Congressmen have each a log to roll;


Where clay by da)? this truth is more contest,
The public men are surely not the best.
O vilifiers of our land and fame,
Who teach that truth and lying are the same,
Whose only care is to make out a case,
In spite of time, of circumstance, and place ;
Go learn, if learn you can, how vile your art,
And blush to think you play so mean a part.
We?ve faults : who has not ? there are crime and care
But is it true that all is bright elsewhere 1
Is all so happy, all so wise and good,
Where slavery?s crime is scarce atoned by blood 1
Where civil discord stalks the land again,
And nature?s gifts seem almost given in vain 1
Where patriots, half horse, half alligator, ? tear
Each other in the slime,? and ? guess that air
Old British lion ? is a beast too slow
For those high-pressure morals which they know 1
But stumpers here, not Yankeeland alone,
Admire and hold superior to their own,
Sometimes, discursive, other climes they seek,
And find examples fresh for each fresh week.
Now Belgium leads, now France is in the van,
Now Spain?s the place, and now perhaps Japan ;
To serve their purpose any land will do,
France, Spain, or Belgium, or Timbuctoo ;
For if we?re slaves, as some declare we be,
Then Afric?s sons are freest ot the free.
0 dunces, friends, companions of my youth,
Who join with rogues to boo-hoo down the truth,
How wondrous is the part you, destined, play,
In all that?s done, in all we do to-day !
In great and little, busy you are seen,
Now smash a state, now mould a crinoline,
Now ?joe? a bell-topper, and now rejoice,
To give in France a despot all your voice ;
Set up next day what you pulled down before,
And kiss the rod though yet your backs are sore.
Helped by the rogues, what limit to your power '(
What thing so foolish but will have its hour t
Now falsely weak, and now more falsely strong,
Ne?er wholly right, yet often wholly wrong,
Turning with times and changing with the breeze,
And pleased with none who does not live to please.


Enough is said. Let fools and rogues conspire
To vote that black is white, and truth a liar;
That all our mighty legacies of thought
Must here neglected lie and pass for nought;
We know your triumph must be brief, if great,
Since rogues fall out and dunces yield to fate.
All the strong words, the dreadful threats, the roar
Of many voices for the ? one cheer more,?
For rogue or brother dunce, or both in one,
Will leave the question where it was begun.
Oh ! could we hope that in the days to come
The dirty tools of faction would be dumb ;
Could we but trust that party rage would cease,
That those who live to learn might live in peace ;
That ? learned? members would not seek a vote,
By making all the precedents they quote;
That love for law, for action calm and wise,
Would stifle in their source the public lies ;
Then might we say the dunces rule no more,
And dunces gone, the trade of rogues is o?er.
But since the crowd is taught that wrong and right
Are merely questions of each party?s might,
That none should speak who will not speak to please,
And politicians sink by swift degrees,
Lower and lower yet we shall descend,
Till one vile, selfish scramble prove the end.
? Set in all lights by many minds,? we might
Hope that our laws would at the last be right;
That if we did go wrong, it would not be
For want of care, but want of skill to see;
? Not swift nor slow to change,? but calm and true,
Do well the things we find it well to do.
But here, where leaders scheme, and faction?s made
The hungry member?s only paying trade;
Where Ministers condemn the press, yet buy
The dirtiest scribblers to abuse and lie ;
Swell with conceit, as did the fabled frog,
And still in ? bristles? go the entire hog;
Law-making has become a faction fight,
Where little?s done for truth, and much for spite.
?Tis hard, no doubt, ?midst jarring parties? roar,
To yield just what is right and yield no more ;
To balance nicely the affairs of state,
Nor move too soon, nor yet too tardy wait.
And this a Minister may fairly plead,
If found to err in word or fail in deed.


But granting this, yet still we must confess
That failure?s oft more noble than success ;
Since those who fail because they will not bend
To flatter follies which might serve their end,
At last will gain, and in no distant da^s,
The good man?s gratitude and wise man's praise.
But those who taint our public life, and show
To what a height absurdity can go ;
Till the crowd thinks that rules should not restrain,
And all the past cries out to us in vain;
Hire the rogue, by flattery win the dunce,
And yielding all things, gain them both at once ;
Must bear the judgment, given soon or late,
Which will pronounce ?These men betrayed the State,
For partisans, e?en when they most succeed,
Grow hungry by the food on which they feed ;
Till those who give at last exhaust their store,
And rogues rebel, whilst dunces praise no more.
Then Clio writes: ?? These were the men who had
The means of good and turned them to the bad,
Concealed the truths they knew, and meekly bowed
To every folly of a foolish crowd ;
Perverted all the sense that Nature gave,
To please the dunce and justify the knave.
Too late they saw their error, and too late,
Sought to avert their ignominious fate ;
For, having shewn the way to laws evade,
And having helped the reckless in their trade,
Taught scorn of form, of safeguards greater scorn,
They cleared the way for follies then unborn,
For rogues who batten on each public vice,
And meet the times by lying at half price.
So left at last by knaves they helped to rear,
Sneered at by those whom they first taught to sneer,
Despised or hated, laughed at or abused,
They perished by the very means they used.?
Yet, let us hope, returning sense at last
Will make the future different to the past;
That in this land our public life may be
Strong without rage, and, without license, free ;
That none shall fear to speak the things he knows,
And meet in fair discussion all his foes ;
Secure ? the people? will demand fair-play,
And hear from each all he may have to say.
So, when the eyes which saw this nation?s birth
Shall gaze no more upon the scenes of earth ;


When those strong arms which did so much of old,
Which cleared the land and wrung from earth the gold,
Shall cease to work : when quite familiar grown,
Our children?s children call the land their own ;
Of us departed, grateful, they will say,
(Though wise men err and good men go astray),
? They knew those truths which make a people great,
The upright public-life, the calm debate;
For fools they?d pity, scorn for public liars,
For rogues who sold and rogues who were the buyers;
Through many a tangled maze of right and wrong,
They clove their way in truthful effort strong;
Though differing much and often far astray,
They scorned deceit and hunted vice away ;
Exposed the rogues, and made e?en dunces see,
That being noisy is not being free.??
