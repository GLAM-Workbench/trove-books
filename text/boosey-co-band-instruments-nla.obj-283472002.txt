The Weak Point in many other
makes is the strong point in the
“N.V.A.”
No. A 6b. Bb CORNET.
(“Contesting Model”).
As illustrated above is famed throughout the con-
testing world. Perfect intonation, beauty of design,
fine craftsmanship, and dependability are represented
to the highest degree in this, as in all models pro-
duced by us. The majority of the Brass Bands
favour this model on account of its brilliant and
weighty tone.
PLAYED BY EVERY PLAYER OF NOTE!
The
“N.V.A.” CORNET
A FRICTIONLESS ACTION!
Patent No. 193729.
This is where the “NEW VALVE ACTION” scores
over all others. The valves are lighter, smoother,
and more silent of action than any yet made. The
valves can be removed and replaced just as easily
as the old fixed guide pin action. Although the new
action has features which are similar to the old
tripod, it possesses more advantages, with none of
the objections. For instance, springs and crossbar
are easily inserted or replaced and cannot be put in
wrongly.
The valve or pump, instead of resting on an open
coiled spring, is suspended from a closed one, with
the result that the spring, instead of buckling and
rubbing against parts of the instrument and causing
noise and friction, is automatically straight, because
it is always being pulled; in addition, the swivel
mounting at each end enables the valve to move
straight up and down naturally without rubbing
against its guides, as it always does with the open
coiled spring as usually mounted. It is the only
action of its type, silky smooth, silent, and depend-
able.

Class A, No. 91, EEb Bass, Imperial Model, four Com-

The Imperial EEb Bass is the finest Contesting Model that has
ever been made, and was introduced by BOOSEY & CO. to meet
the demand for an Eb instrument with the depth and fullness of
tone of the BBb Monster. The bore of the valves is identical
with that of the BBb Monster, the bell and the other tubing being
proportionately increased. The instrument, as made with four
Compensating Pistons, has a chromatic compass downwards
greater than that of the BBb Monster with three valves.
It has been adopted by most of the leading Contesting Bands,
including Besses o’ th’ Barn, Black Dyke, Foden’s Works, Win-
gate’s, Hebden Bridge, Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade,
Collingwood Citizens, Prahran, Coburg, Brunswick, Ballarat City
and many others. It has also been adopted by Beecham’s Opera
Company, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Grenadier
Guards, Scots Guards, Irish Guards, Life Guards, Royal Horse
Guards, Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Royal Marines, Royal
Garrison Artillery, Royal Military School of Music, etc., etc.

‘Sotone’
FRENCH HORNS
“Sotone” French Horn, No. 40.
Pitched in Ab. “Orchestral” Model.
For many years attempts have
been made to combine the ex-
cellent points of the old Raoux
model hand Horns with the
facilities afforded by the best
modern valves, but with dis-
appointing results. Examination
of a very fine genuine Raoux
Horn, the history of which is
known, and the application of
their new “Silbron” Valves, en-
abled Boosey & Co. to produce a
Valve Horn of such excellence
that they recommend it to all
players with the greatest con-
fidence.
No. 40—French Horn, “Orchestral Model,”
in F, 3 “Solbron” valves, with thumb
rest. ,
The slides of this Horn are adjusted to take an A [s
crook in their home positions, and have therefore
to be drawn for the F or other low crooks, or re-
placed by longer valve slides.
No. 41—French Horn, “Military Model,”
in F, 3 “Solbron” valves, with thumb
rest and a protecting shield over the
exposed portions of the bell tubing.
The slides of this Horn are adjusted for the F crook
when In their home positions, as in military band
music the higher crooks are not required.
IMPERIALPHONES
No player in a Dance Band is up-to-date without an Imperial
Phone. The tone blends beautifully, and is also invaluable
for recording work, as the bell can be adjusted to meet any
requirements.

TROMBONES
After long and exhaustive experiments Messrs. BOOSEY & CO. have produced a Bb
Tenor Trombone which they confidently claim to be the finest Trombone yet produced.
The Ab in the natural position (the third) is a perfect note, with fine quality. The tone
quality of the instrument is rich and brilliant, especially in the upper register. Difficult
passages are made easy on this Instrument.

THE ARTIST’S TROMBONE
No. 42A. Built in two weights, for general band use. Also recommended for concert use.
A PERFECT Ab IN THE THIRD POSITION!
Well and truly termed “The Ace of all Trombones,” this model has achieved such
world-wide popularity that we feel it hardly necessary to reiterate our claim of absolute
superiority over obvious imitations of either recent date or, for that matter, any other
period. With the Artist’s Model, the beautiful and distinctive trombone tone is retained
in all its richness and colour; whilst by an exclusive method of manufacture the Ab in
the third position is always in tune and easy of production. Soloists will appreciate this
achievement, which plays no small part in the continued success of this truly all-British
Trombone.

This Clarionet has the following distinctive features in addition to the Barret Action
on top joint and the extra C# key: the middle tenon passes beyond the C—G hole to enable
the Ct —G# hole to be placed in the best position for intonation and freedom. The hole
speaking the forked F is carried lower down the instrument than usual, and the hole
being further assisted by a vent key, is available also for the lew Bb; and both these
notes, the Bb and F, therefore speak as well with the forked fingering as with the cross
key. To preserve an easy and natural position for the finger, the forked F hole is covered
by a padded cup to which a finger-plate is attached. In addition to the usual long Bl]
shake on the top joint, there is a long Bb shake. The Gtf or Ab key on the top joint
crosses the At; key, and is so arranged that it can be taken either with the Ist or 2nd
finger. The Clarionet is fitted with four rollers.

The B. & H. “32” MODEL E[j ALTO
SAXOPHONE is your best investment
because it offers you precisely what you
are seeking to-day. This is a master-
piece of British Sax-craft distinctly
new, of the highest attainable quality, at
an unprecedented price; and, mark you,
embodied in this instrument are many
unique and attractive features which
will appeal to the most critical player.
Illustration depicts finished product
Short Key Action for rapid execution.
PARAMOUNT FEATURES:
Beaded and Drawn Sockets, producing the most perfect pad seating which
mechanical genius can devise. Wear of pads is reduced. The
shoulders are acute internally; consequently the bore is even and
every note dead true to pitch.
(Perfect Conical Bore. The joint of the crook or mouthpiece and the
body is tapered to maintain a true conical bore, giving uninterrupted
tone passage and thereby' permitting even scaling throughout the
entire registers.
.Keywork. Keys are made by an exclusive process, devised and developed
in our tool-room, which eradicates brazing of small parts together,
which process always destroys the temper of keys made by the
hand-forged method.
Point Screws and Counterparts. Point or key pivot screws work on steel
inserts and not on the comparatively soft brass tubes. By this
simple method a perfect thrust of point screw into counterpart is
maintained. Looseness of action is thereby eliminated.
Spring Beds. New “roller type’’ hardened steel Inserts, giving faster
spring action than when fitted with a flat steel or brass bed plate.
Eel I, Bow and Crook are “expanded” from a single piece of metal by
the hydraulic process, and are jointless. This process eliminates
the Inaccuracies of the bench worker and guarantees an exact replica
of the master model, which is cast steel. No other European manu-
facturer has, as yet, given such a guarantee.
The Body is produced on similar lines.
Assembling accurately made parts is executed by the finest craftsmen in
the profession, whose sole task is to produce a beautiful and care-
fully adjusted instrument.
British in its entirety. Springs, pads, silver-plating, engraving, and case
are produced in our works; hence the low price. No intermediary
profits or import duty to pay.

MODERN
REPAIR DEPARTMENT
Good instruments are frequently spoiled or inadequately repaired. The more valuable the instrument the
more complicated is the mechanism. To overcome all these difficulties Allan’s have been fortunate in
obtaining the services of Mr. Vic. Petterd, who has exceptional all-round experience in the various sections
of Brass Band, Orchestral and Percussion instrument reconstruction, and is also an excellent player, which
enables instruments to be returned in perfect playing order.
