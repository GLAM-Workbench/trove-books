HYMN 71—
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died.
My richest gain I count but loss.
And pour contempt on all my pride.
See! from His head. His hands. His feet.
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet.
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?
Forbid it. Lord, that I should boast.
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them to His blood.
Were the whole realm of nature mine.
That were an offering far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine.
Demands my soul, my life, my all.
Amen.

HYMN 17-
Let us with a gladsome mind All things living He doth feed;
Praise the Lord, for He is kind: His full hand supplies their need:
For His mercies aye endure. For His mercies aye endure.
Ever faithful, ever sure. Ever faithful, ever sure.
Let us sound His name abroad, He His chosen race did bless
For of gods He is the God: In the wasteful wilderness:
For His mercies aye endure. For His mercies aye endure.
Ever faithful, ever sure. Ever faithful, ever sure.
He, with all-commanding might, He hath with a piteous eye
Filled the new-made world with light: Looked upon our misery:
For His mercies aye endure. For His mercies aye endure.
Ever faithful, ever sure. Ever faithful, ever sure.
Let us then with gladsome mind
Praise the Lord, for He is kind:
For His mercies aye endure.
Ever faithful, ever sure. Amen.

HYMN 438
Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run ;
His kingdom stretch from shore to shore.
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.
For Him shall endless prayer be made.
And praises throng to crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.
Blessings abound where’er He reigns:
The prisoner leaps to lose his Chains,
The weary find eternal rest.
And all the sons of want are blest.
Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King,
Angels descend with songs again.
And earth repeat the long “Amen.”
Amen.
Benediction

heritage in the Gospel, she would send ten thousand fresh
messengers to the farthest bounds of earth to proclaim,
btj word and example, this glorious Gospel to the
millions still in the thraldom of heathen darkness and
superstition.” —Dr, John G. Paton.
