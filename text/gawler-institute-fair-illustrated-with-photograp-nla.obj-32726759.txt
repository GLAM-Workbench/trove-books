GAWLEE INSTITUTE
MONSTER FAIR.
Tbk grand Fair day ia over. The event so long
sad bo anxiously looked forward to by ladies
gay and bachelors simple is now a thing of
the past. The mummers have played out their
play and the dancers have done. A wave of
the in agio wand by Wizard Taylor, and the
Gawler Fair exists but in the pleasant memories
it has created. It remains for us to faithfully
chronicle, for the benefit of those who (unfor-
tunate wights) were unable to participate in the
pleasant festivities, the entire success of one of
the most ambitious programmes ever put before
the public?by without doubt the most indefa-
tigable committee that the Gawler Institute
has ever appointed to manage its affairs; and
in this we are anxious to render justice to every
one connected with the proceedings and give
honor unto those to whom honor is duo. The idea
of celebrating the eighth anniversary of the
Gawler Institute with a grandFair,which should
include a bazaar presided over by ladies, and
also, as far as possible, some of the attributes of
similar gatherings in the Home Land, originated
k> .is


we believe, witb Mr. Eoborts, who has always
been active in supporting local entertainments.
The good seed thus sown fell on congenial soil.
It was at once seen that the thing was feas-
ible and it was determined by those who were in
power that it should be done. Preliminary
meetings were held, at which it was determined
to invito the co-operation of the ladies; and
the way our gentle friends responded
to the call is not only a lasting credit to them-
selves, but an honor to the town in which they
live. How, in spite of the short time allotted
to them, they have performed their task, is best
shown by the fact that, in one afternoon, at
nine stalls, there was nearly four hundred
pounds taken in hard cash, without the estab-
lishments of the bewitching proprietors
looking so very much the worse for it;
and when the new building shall rear its head
in our midst, there is not a lady in this portion
of the land, gentle or simple, bat can point
with honest pride and say X did it. Kever, we
believe, was assistance so generally given as
upon this festive occasion. In another column
will be found a very lively account of the pro-
cession, &c., by a ? Visitor,? who must certainly
have made good use of his time, ns ho appears,
like the celebrated Sir Charles Coldstream, to
have done everything, but who nevertheless is
guilty of awful levity, as he approaches, with a
wont of veneration fearful to contemplate, the
mysterious dwelling of that shadowy, yet at
the same time rather .substantial potentate.
Bosh, the son of Ki-Bosh. Alas! that we
should live in on age of sceptics, but wo must
admit with tender sorrow that others, besides
our scribbling visitor, have shown a great want
of respect towards this extraordinary man; and
we'ask, could any ordinary mortal have stood
the confinement and heat for twelve hours of
that temporary abode, from which ho dis-


yj 1 ? 3g

tributed amongst the people of Gawler the
pearls of his wisdom, and cunningly extracted
from them their sixpences ? Our Visitor evi-
dently revels in the procession ; and we cannot
but feel proud of the way in which this part of
the business was conducted by Mr. Clement,
who has a peculiar talent for this kind of dis-
play. It is not the first time Mr. Clement
has shown the people of South Australia the
way to bring in orderly subjection a mixed
mass of riders, drivers, and toddlers, and form
them into quite an imposing sight; and the
turn at the top of Murray-strect was certainly
a feature worth noticing. Early in the morn-
ing the Corporation and the officers and commit-
tee of the Institute proceeded to the railway
station for the purpose of receiving His Excel-
lency, who arrived by a special train about ten
o?clock. A few words of welcome by His Wor-
ship the Mayor was all the formality observed.
His Excellency being then conducted to a car-
riage drawn by a pair of greys, provided by the
committee?the Mayor and Mr. Jos. Mold,
the President of the Institute, accom-
panying him. In a second carriage (W. Duf-
field?s. Esq.) came the Ministry, and these were
followed by almost every kind of conveyanco
down to Shanks's pony. The appearance of
the town is so well described by our friend the
? Visitor? as to need little remark from us in
this place. Suffice it to say, Gawler never
looked so jolly green.
On arrival at the ground on which the Fair
was to bo held, wo found a large crowd already
assembled, waiting for the business of the day
to begin. His Excellency having entered the
Fancy Bazaar, was, for some reason best known
to the Committee, marched to the extreme end
of the building, quite out of both sight and
hearing of most of the ladies, who were busy
at their stalls. A rope having been placed
" "ift


across ?we presume to prevent his running
away?a few remarks, supposed to be of a com-
plimentary nature, wore delivered by Mr. Mold
to Sir Dominick Daly, who made, of course, a
suitable reply, and declared the Fair open; and,
according to the programme, at this special
time the fun was to commence.
We shall now proceed to notice in due order
the stalls and the names of the fair occupants,
and those who assisted in stocking them;
only here it may be well to say that it was the
constantly expressed opinion of those who are
wise in such matters, that the display, taken
as a whole, was quite equal, if not superior, to
any exhibition of a similar kind which has yet
taken place in the colony. Wo are aware that
this is big talk ; but facts are stubborn things,
and cash taken is a wonderfully substantial
supporter of this statement; bnt whilst our
esteemed Governor is extricating himself from
the coil by which he is surrounded, let us take
a peep ai>?
No. 1 Stall?Radiant with fair faces, and
presided over by the daughter of our new
Treasurer, who was very active throughout the
day. (Indeed, we heard a remark made to the
effect that some �f the ladies must have thought
the hon. gentleman had the key of the till with
him.) We need scarcely say that Miss Louisa
Duffield?s stall was a very elegant one, and
that, assisted by her sister, and other ladies
whose names we have not the pleasure of
knowing, she managed a very large business
with admirable tact and great success.
No. 2 Stall?Occupied and furnished by Mrs.
F. F. Turner, who was in her turn assisted by
Miss Duschane and the Misses Gamaeu, was
very handsomely stocked and most energeti-
cally managed?Mrs. Turner exerting herself
in a way beyond all praise until a very lato
hour in the evening?thus securing a large re-
turn.


5
No. 3 Stall?Proprietors, Mesdames Mitchell,
Nott, and Crawford. Here again was a mag-
nificent display of fancy work, plentifully mixed
with goods of a more practically useful kind.
The above ladies, together with Miss Nott,
were also indefatigable in their exertions
throughout the day?the very graceful way in
which they managed to entice the money from
the pockets of their customers being quite
? ? refreshing. Wo are given to understand that
Mrs. Buchan, Mrs. E. J. Turner, and Mrs.
Canon Coombs, wore also contributors to
this establishment.
No. 4 Stall?Mrs. E. Potheringham, Mrs. A.
Fotheringham, Mrs. Munro, and Mrs. Peacock,
were the fascinating quartette whose special
business it was to look after the interest of
Stall No. 4. The name of Potheringham is an
honored one in Institute affairs, and our
readers may be sure that upon this occasion it
shone with additional lustre.
No. 5 Stall?Mrs. James Martin and Mrs.
Barnet were the official heads of this lavishly
supplied establishment?these ladies having
been most ably supported both on and before
the day by Mrs. Percival, Mrs. Eoberts and the
Misses Gill; and so large was their stock of
goods that they were compelled to open a
branch establishment for toys, where Miss Gill,
with unwearying energy, managed to secure a
considerable amount of business.
At No. C Stall, Hiss Harrison and Mrs.
Bailey tempted the v isitors with a large and
most beautiful selection of fancy work. A
magnificent leather fiame (Mrs. Bailey being
the fair artiste) attracted throughout the day
considerable attention. These ladies depended
mainly on their own exertions, and were second
to none in energetically conducting their busi-
ness?of course successfully.
At No. 7 stall we found another glorious
a~ "HR


display, under the special protection of Mes-
dames Gray, Ferguson, and Young, assisted
by a whole bevy of blushing beauty, who
doubtless played great havoc with the hearts
and pockets of many travellers in search of
fate; be that as it may, the returns of the estab-
lishment show a highly satisfactory resnlt.
No. 8 might with propriety be termed the
home of the Fatherland, for hero had the
daughters of the Teuton pitched their tents,
and pitched them to some purpose too, as the
Gawler Institute will have sundry weighty
reasons to remember for some time to come.
The names of the ladies who managed this
stall, are Mrs. Korff, Mrs. Schwan, Mrs.
Wachsmuth, and Mrs. Muller; the wool work
of the latter calling forth general admiration;
here also Miss Korff, Miss Gregson, and Miss
Wachsmuth lent their valuable aid. We can-
not but think this German stall a most inter-
esting feature in the Bazaar.
Last, though not least wo come to No. 9,
and here did many bewitching young ladies
distribute in a most impartial way, (for a con-
sideration) their smiles, and their beauti-
ful articles upon all intending purchasers.
The stall under the very excellent proprietor-
ship of Miss Lewis, and Mrs. H. E. Bright,
assisted by Mrs. Edward Bright, and the
Misses Williams, did throughout the day a very
thriving trade; attached to the regular busi-
ness was a travelling lucky bag, and according
to the very charming young lady, who superin-
tended the affair, you had only to pay one
shilling, to put your hand in the lucky bag,
and you must draw a prize every time. And
ah! we thought who shall be the fortunate
drawer of the greatest prize of all.
Such thoughts as these, however, were quickly
dispelled by gazing on the dark and doleful-
looking corner near this merry spot. Surely


here is the Cave of Mystery, cried we. Bat no.
Upon hearing the sound, as of a report of a
gun, we inquired and found that one of six or
more unhappy bachelors, who were hiding in
this dreary-looking place, had. in a fit of despair,
shot himself with a ginger beer bottle. A
sigh of sympathy from a fair young bosom
close at hand showed that at least ono felt for
his unlucky end. What became of the rest we
don?t know; but rumour reports that strange
forms are at times seen hovering over the par-
ticular portion of the Bazaar once known as
the Bachelor?s abode.
Hanged on the other side of the building
could be seen the ladies? refreshment tables, at
which Mrs. Pett, Mrs. Engelbrecht, and Mrs.
Frankel, dispensed the good things of this
world to all who chose to come and but ?Mr.
Englebrocht doing yeoman's service in the
same good cause. Then came our old friend
Dr. Nott, who through a long day of labour
was untiring in his witty endeavours to make
people believe they could get a fortune for a
shilling. And next again to him was the loud-
sounding gong and the proprietor of the Dwarf,
who made the moat of his small property,
whilst the shouts of laughter from inside the
Cave told how well satisfied were the visitors
to this abbreviated specimen of humanity, they
in his own words exclaiming, ? May his shadow
never grow less; and ho is the son of a burnt
father, who wishes otherwise.?
The Nathan Family performed in the Bijou
Theatre to admiring and crowded audiences,
though complaints were made as to the diffi-
culty in seeing the stage?a difficulty not easily
got over in a temporary affair of this kind;
however, the favoured few who did manage to
elbow their way to the front evidently very
much enjoyed the performance.
The large dancing booth for a time was also


a favourite resort of those who pride themselves
in their performances on the light fantastic
toe. The German games of Bird Target and
Blind Man?s Buff, nnder the very able superin-
tendance of Mr. Sohwan, were productive of
great amusement.
We must not forget the Post Office, where
Mrs. Peacock, Miss Qregson, and others, dis-
tributed letters to all who applied and paid
the postage. It would ho tedious to enumerate
all the particular sights to be seen or games
to bo played. We can only say that the thou-
sands who were on the ground appeared quite
satisfied with the fun on hand. We think it
only right that the names of those gentlemen
who have borne the heat and burthen of the
great festival should be made known to the
public. We therefore publish them, that they
may have the credit so well earned.

Wo ask, could any sixteen other gentlemen
bo found who would, if they could, sacrifice so
much of their time, both by night and day, as
these have done ? As we have remarked, the
immense sum of money taken on the day is a
sufficient proof as to the energy and talent that
must have been brought into play to secure it.
Of course there were some slight grounds of
complaint, but of so trifling a nature as scarcely
to require comment; and we have no hesitation


in declaring that altogether the Committee
carried out the programme with a fidelity
worthy of all honor. We must not forget to
mention that, at the special request of the
committee, Mr. Townsend and Mr. Tidemann
sold by auction a large amount of goods in the
evening from the stalls, adding thereby greatly
to the receipts. His Worship the Mayor of
Adelaide worked throughout the day with a
zeal that astonished not a few. Wherever the
laugh was loudest or the coin most plentiful
there would our friend bo found in the midst.
As night came on the place was lighted up
with lamps, the effect being very good. Once
more did the gong sound, and a voice cry,
? Positively the last chance of seeing the Won-
derful Dwarf.? Once more, in response to the
invitation, did crowds flock into the Cave of
Mystery, to come out therefrom more mystified
than ever. And in spite of the fact that hun-
dreds had gone to witness the clever perform-
ances of Burton? Circus, crowds of eager
pleasure seekers still thronged the Bazaar,
giving to the whole scene a most animated
appearance. This state of things continued
till about ten o?clock, when quietly and orderly
as they came, so departed the many visitors
from other parts, every one exclaiming, as they
went their several ways, ? Well, they do know
how to manage things in Qawler';? all looking
forward to the time when our spirited town
shall again provide innocent amusements, not
only for themselves, but for all who know how
to enjoy a bit of harmless fun. We are very
glad that the likenesses of the Committee have
been taken. In the uncertain future many
may be scattered abroad, and find their homes
in other (we hope) pleasant places. On the
graves of some, flowers may blossom and grass
grow green. It will be pleasant then, in


looking at our Institute, to remember and call
to mind the faces of those who strove so hard
and hoped so fervently for its success.
On tho list of the ladies who assisted
at No. S Stall, we omitted to mention the
Misses Lewis, daughters of Dr. Lewis, who
contributed largely to the success of the Stall.

PAST II
BY A VISITOR TO O A W I. B E.
Ip there ever was a go-ahead little spot of
earth on the Globe?s surface, Gawler may lay
claim to the distinction, so ?mentally ejacu-
lated? (whatever that may mean) a visitor
from Adelaide on occasion of the lato Institu-
tutional fete. When the writer of this article
paid his first visit to the place it was not in
existence. The writer is not a native of the
Erne rail Isle, but claims a share of all privi-
leges enjoyed by his fellow-countrymen from
that part of the kingdom, including that of
perpetrating bulls. When be next beheld the
town it consisted of three cottages ?very
humble ones they were?and not a human
habitation had been erected between them
and North Adelaide. Since that period he has
witnessed several social gatherings and occa-
sions of intellectual recreation in Gawler (most
of them originated by the Institute Committee,)
which have thrown big brother Adelaide con-
siderably into the shade. The fete of Tuesday,
the 7th November, however, eclipsed nil pre-
ceding doings.
7 ? : lis


The first matter of astonishment to the
hundreds who were simultaneously discharged
from the severs 1 joints of lengthy centipede-
like excursion trains, was the transcendantly
verdant condition of the township?a fact the
more remarkable, as Adelaide people have never
been in the habit of considering greeness an
attribute of Gawler or of its inhabitants. Some
individuals were inclined to think they had
mistaken their way and entered a pine forest,
whereinto, by fairy agency or otherwise, build-
ings had been introduced; others remarked
that appearances favored the idea of a success-
ful invasion of Gawler by the adjacent bush,
which had effectually secured its captive by
bunchy trammels, from which there was no
escape for street or building. These were the
speculations of imaginative people; but mortals
of a more literal temperament were equally at
fault. The calculating faculty actually bows
beneath the attempt to determine the tonnage
of boughs exhibited in Gawler that day; but,
whatever may have been the amount, it was
amply sufficient to prove the inomitable in-
dustry of the people: while the,disposal of the
foliage into triumphal arches, pillars, festoons,
and other devices, unequivocally testified to
their taste and skill. It appears that many
flowers had been industriously interwoven
among tho verdant masses, hut these were not
discernible on the morning of the Pair. Bid
the too ardent rays of the sun cause them to
wither? Perhaps so. At all events they were
irreclaimahly gone?little does it matter
whither.
And then the flags! It would have been
strange, indeed, if the people of Gawler had
flagged in the matter of flags. Talk of "Talk
on the Flags,? indeed. Why, the youngsters
of Gawler will talk of the .flags for the next
half centnry. Never surely on any former oc-


casion were so many banners collected within
so mall a space. Every possible piece of bant-
ing. from every possible locality was airing
itself in one or other of all possible places.
Flags of more nations of the earth, ancient
and modern, than ever existed, flaunted to the
breeze.
And then the mottoes! English, Latin,
German, Norman French, and lots of others,
which were Greek to many visitors, arrested
attention at every step. The admirable
Crichton, if he had chanced that day to have
been resusticated in this hemisphere, would
have enjoyed an intellectual treat. A peculiar
motto, which was conspicuous in the grand
pavilion, appeared to intimate that one ?Sans
Gauler??probably an old and beneficent settler
in the township?made a ?point? of providing
?fruit? for the company on festive occasions.
From this announcement the assemblage
turned their eyes to the tables, whereon were
placed oranges, strawberries, cherries, ginger-
bread nuts, and other horticultural produc-
tions, andsmiled benignantly, the smiles being
evidently produced in part by a feeling of
gratitude towards Sana Gauler, whoever he
may be.
Then the Bazaar and the lady vendors, by
whom no price, however large was refused;
the Dancing Booth; the Bijou Theatre, with
Nathans of both sexes as performers; the Cave
of Mystery, wherein a deminutive giant or a
gigantic dwarf, or something of that sort, col-
lected people together for a few instants and
then dismissed them, with some such Oriental
fiat as ? ?Tis very hot 1 begone!! ? The Round-
about, where the only person who really " got
on? was the proprietor; and ? Aunt Sally,?
at which diversion all the sallies of the
throwers put money into the pocket of Aunty's
owner; these, and the Lottery and the Auction,


and fifty other modes of diversion, are they
not written in the book of Gawler ??and were
they not respectively enjoyed by hundreds of
cheerful Australians, young, old, and middle
aged ?
Then the self-invented modes of enjoyment.
The groups of dozens and half-dozens of holi-
day makers, seated in recesses formerly exca-
vated by the current in the banks of the South
Para, discussing chicken and bottled beer
wherever a yard-breadth of shade justified such
a proceeding; the battallions of little girls who
augmented the already liberal display of ban
ners by an exhibition of pocket handkerchiefs
attached to parasols; and more solitary juniors
in knickerbockers, who patiently stood by pools
of water in the bed of the river, some of them
of the dimensions of a washhand basin, and
others larger, seeking to inveigle millers
thumbs and sticklebacks on to bent pins, fish
bones, and, in some instances, real hooks.
Tfien the procession, and the volunteers, and
the grandees. His Excellency the Governor,
Members of the Council, and of the House of As-
sembly, His Worship the Mayor of Gawler, too,
who throughout the day exerted himself to
make the amusements affective. Strange to
say, although His Worship was very conspi-
cuous, and is generally known, it was several
times asserted in his presence, and almost
within his hearing, ?That is not the Mayor!??
a fresh proof of this, that often what one hears
on such occasions, even on the spot, is not to
be implicitly relied on.
Then the three Bands of music, and per-
formances on the Bagpipes by a real live
Highlander in national costume; and the
Illumination in the evening; and the crowded
Circus of Mr. Burton, whose talents are only
exceeded by his liberality. With all these
things,-and fifty similar ones, which must

l�4�.' t ir�'' 1.


remain uncnumcrated, what wonder if "all
went merry as a marriage bell ?? And crowds
of belles their were too, evidently neither una-
dapted for, nor indisposed to marriage; for
who has witnessed a Monster Fair, whereat
the Fair were not monstrously predominant ?
No allusion to crinoline is intended.
Then there was no accident on the Kailwa - ?,
a singularity of itself sufficient to render thr
day ever memorable, nor any other accident
that tho visitor heard of. Nor did any dissen-
tion, or fight, or scuffle occur during the pro-
ceeding, the only mill connected with them
having been that of Mr. Duffield on the bank
of the South Para.
The day?s festivities were wisely devised,
pleasantly and energetically carried out to a
successful issue, and were therefore worthy of
Gawler. No doubt the sentiment with which
all visitors left the place, was?Prosperity to
Gawler and its Institute.
PICTORIAL ILLUSTRATIONS.
The Photographs which illustrate the foregoing
memoir were taken on the occasion by Mr.
Joshua Finch, Photographer, of Gawler; No.
X, representing a noble arch of large dimen-
sions, erected by Messrs. Clement, Roediger,
and Schwan, opposite the business premises of
Mr. Roediger and Mr. A. J. Woodman. On the


Arch was displayed, in a colossal scale, the
music or notes of ? The Song of Australia,?
supported by the mottoes, " Willkommen in
Gawler,? and ? Te Eevidere Spero.?
The loading band halted at this point to
play the air, the words of which, it will be
remembered, aro a prize production of tlio
Gawler Institute in 1801, which awarded to the
composer (Mrs. Carlcton) a premium of ton
guineas. No. 2of the Photographs represents
an arch erected opposite his premises by Mr.
Mold, the President of the Institute having,
the words, " Success to the Institute,? worked
upon it in flowers of varied hues. Illustration
No. 3 represents the handsome and substantial
Arch erected under the direction of Mr. Malcolm
at the Victoria Mills of Messrs. W. Duffield &
Co., and which was illuminated in the evening
in a most picturesque manner with Chinese
ornamental lanterns.
Besides the three arches described, others,
which the artist had not an opportunity of
sketching, were erected on the South Bridge,
the entrance into Gawler Proper, and opposite
the South Australia Bank and the Institute.
The group of figures represents the members
of the industrious Committee of Management,
whose names are recorded on page 8 j and while
attempting to do justice to these gentlemen,
one can hardly omit wishing that tho equally
zealous ladies, who proved to so great an
extent the help and ornament of the occasion,
had allowed the artist a similar opportunity of
adding grace and interest to the present sketch
of the Gawler Fancy Fair of November, 1365.
