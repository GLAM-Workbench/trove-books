ll. ?South Australia.
Some discoveries have been made by whalers in the western part
of South Australia, which add to the information respecting that
region communicated in Mr. Eyre?s reports and journals. The
extent and value of the new information will perhaps be most
correctly indicated by reprinting here : ?lst. A report drawn up
by the editor of the ? Southern Australian,? from the verbal com-
munications of Richard Harris, one of the whalers?2nd. A re-
port, drawn up by Mr. Smith, resident magistrate at Port
Lincoln, from the verbal communications of George Cummings,
Harris?s companion?3rd. Some remarks, by the editor of the
e Southern Australian,? upon the seeming discrepancies of the two
statements. East of Adelaide an instructive excursion has been
made by Governor Gawler across the Murray, and as far as
the valley of the Glenelg, connecting the labours of Mr. Tyers
with the observations in the Adelaide district.
I.?Statement of Richard Harris.
? We have received, from rather an unexpected quarter, a valuable
and interesting contribution to the geography of the country to the west-
ward of Port Lincoln.
? We have just conversed with a person named Richard Harris, now
in the employment of the Surveyor-General, who, in the end of August
last, along with his mate, George Cummings, performed the arduous
journey by land from a whaling station at Fowler?s Bay to Port
Lincoln.
? Calculating the distance at 200 miles, and that they would get sup-
plied at Peters? Islands and at Streaky Bay, where there were whaling
stations, they took with them ten days? provisions. At Peters? Island
they got a chart of the coast, w'hich was of the greatest service. On
arriving at Anxious Bay they got tired of keeping to the coast, where
they had difficulty in getting water, and hoping also to shorten their
way, they struck off at the salt lagoon, called by Mr. Eyre Lake New-
land, and held a due E. course into the interior. This course they kept
for two days, over sand-hills and a scrubby country, when they came to
a high conical hill, with good grass on it and good soil. They found
also at intervals granite rocks, near which they always found water.
When at the coast they thought this mountain very near, but found it to
be two days? journey, or about 50 miles. It is probably Mount Wedge
of Mr. Eyre, but at a greater distance than he placed it, judging by the
eye. They now found the country to the E. and S. of the finest de-
scription. They encamped near a stream of considerable size, which
ran to. the S.W. From the hill they saw the bluff near Waldegrave
Isles, and, being afraid that they would lose themselves if they went
farther into the interior, they determined to travel again by the coast,
and cross over to Port Lincoln from Coffin?s Bay. On descending, they
came to a plain which extended in-breadth as far as the eye could reach.
This plain was covered with such rich green grass that, as Harris ex-


pressed it, he almost imagined himself in a fine grazing farm" in
England. The sward was very close, and the grass was half up his
leg. The soil is a dark loam. They were sure they had come near a
station, having never been in this colony before,* and they constantly
broke out into expressions of delight with the scenery. They travelled
through this vast plain for two days, and found the country equally
good all the time, but there are very few trees. They also found a great
many pools or lagoons of fresh water, which were large, deep, and
apparently permanent. They were constantly in the expectation of
killing ducks in the pools, but were unsuccessful. They succeeded,
however, in killing a large brown kangaroo, which was exceedingly
agreeable, as their provisions had just failed them. This they roasted,
and it served them the rest of the way. At the end of two days they
came to a belt of scrub with grassy spots here and there, which conti-
nued to the sea-shore. They journeyed from sunrise till sunset, with
two hours? rest, in a straight line, taking their course from the sun, so
that they must have walked 25 miles per day. The fine plain they
mention is, therefore, about 50 miles in length, and the breadth un-
known.
? They saw only seven natives, two of them, stout made men, they
met before they came to Mount Wedge, who kindly showed them a
water hole.
? Mount Wedge is placed by Mr. Eyre in lat. 33� 30' S., and long.
134� E., but from Harris?s statement we should say it is farther to
the N.W.
? We have looked at Flinders? chart to ascertain if there is any an-
chorage between Waldegrave?s Isles and the shore, but find he had made
no soundings. We perceive, however, a sounding of 10 fathoms close
to the S. end of the large island. If there was safe anchorage, with
such a good country in the neighbourhood, it would be an admirable
place for a settlement.
? It is remarkable that after all the explorations that have been made,
and all that has been said about Port Lincoln, so little in reality is
known of the large district westward of it. Southward of the Gawler
Range discovered by Mr. Eyre, and bounded by the ocean and the line
of country on Spencer?s Gulf, there is a compact district of a triangular
form, nearly equilateral, measuring 160 miles each side, or about 13,000
square miles in extent, which has never been penetrated except by these
adventurous whalers.
?We sincerely trust that the opening now almost providentially made,
may lead to the most cheering and important results.?
2.?Statement of George Cummings.
? The new discovery to the westward of Port Lincoln.
? Gentlemen, ?Previous to reading Richard Harris?s account of his
journey from Fowler?s Bay to Coffin?s Bay I had heard from his fellow-
traveller, George Cummings, a verbal statement, which differs in some
few particulars from that of Harris.
* The three whaling stations mentioned above were occupied by parties from Hobart
Town, from which our travellers had last come.


? From Harris?s account it would seem that they never left the coast
till they reached Anxious Bay. The fact is, according to Cummings,
that, from the sand-hills at the N. side of Streaky Bay, they saw an
apparently open country running from the E. end of the Bay. Arriving
there, they left Mr. Eyre?s track, which was distinctly marked, and took
a south-easterly course, which brought them to Mount Cooper (Mr.
Eyre?s course having been S.W. to a spring marked on his chart, and
then S.E. till he reached LakeNewland*). This was a distance of about
50 miles, and Cummings describes it as an open grassy country, though
they did not see any water. At Mount Cooper they fell in with several
small streams, from which they filled their water-kegs, and proceeded
on to Lake Newland, where they again fell in with Mr. Eyre?s tracks.
There they met with four natives, two of whom ran away, and the other
two showed them a spring of fresh water, which is probably the one
laid down by Mr. Eyre near Lake Newland. From hence they conti-
nued along the coast for two days over sand-hill and scrub, but, on
arriving at the S.E, point of Anxious Bay, they took an easterly course
into the interior, which brought them, in two days more, to the mount
which Harris calls a conical hill, and which Cummings describes as re-
sembling a wedge; one end, towards the S.E., being a high bluff, and
gradually falling in the opposite direction. The country they passed
oyer from Anxious Bay to Mount Wedge was a fine open country, with
high grass and well-watered, and it was here they found the pool of
which Harris speaks. This country answers Harris?s description, ex-
cept that, instead of wandering in this vast plain two days, it occupied
them three, when they encamped at the junction of three or four streams
which take their rise on the S.W. side of the Mount. At the base of
Mount Wedge Cummings says they saw pines of a large size. Leaving
the Mount, they took a direct southerly course, which brought them to
Point Drummond, where they joined the Governor Gawler, and sailed in
her to Port Lincoln. From Mount Wedge till tvithin a few miles of the
coast near Point Drummond, they found the country undulating, grassy,
and well watered, lightly timbered with she-oak. If you look at Mr.
Eyre?s chart, you will see that a due easterly course from Lake Newland
would not reach Mount Wedge, which makes it probable that Cummings?s
account is the correct one. But he quite agrees with Harris as to the
kind of country they saw; and he says he frequently expressed to his
fellow-traveller his surprise that such a beautiful country was unoccu-
pied. In all directions round Mount Wedge, the country had the same
appearance of open grassy land lightly timbered. Mr. Eyre places
Mount Wedge in 33� 30' S., and 135� 20', not 134� E.; but Cummings,
on examining the chart here, thinks it is in 33� 40' S., and 135� 30' E.
However Cummings and Harris may differ in details, they agree in the
main, that they discerned an excellent country of great extent, grassy,
and well watered; and this, I trust, will be the means of inducing the
Government to send a party to explore, and make charts of, a country
doubtlessly good, very little known, and very much required. Indeed,
if his Excellency intends (as I am informed he does) to visit Port
Lincoln, he will have an excellent, opportunity of judging for himself,
* To prevent misunderstanding, we beg to correct a trifling error here, Mr. Eyre
arrived at Lake Newland from the opposite, direction to that here stated.

important portion of our beautiful province.

3.?Remarks of the Editor of the c Southern
Australian.?
? Mr. Smith notices discrepancies between the statements of the two
parties; but a little explanation from us may, perhaps, go far to put
matters to right. We found Harris to be rather a silent man, and he
spoke principally in answer to our questions, and, as we only examined
him upon the subject of the good country and as to his route after he
left Lake Newland, we did not ascertain the fact of his having struck
into the interior from Streaky Bay, and of his visit to Mount Cooper, so
that here Cummings?s statement is additional?not different. The same
may be said of the rest of Cummings's statement, and it is, therefore, a
valuable addition to that of Harris. Mr. Smith states, in his letter,
that an easterly course from Lake Newland will not strike Mount Wedge.
On referring to the large map, taken from Mr. Eyre?s original tracings,
we find this to be a mistake, as the Lake and the Mount are nearly in the
same latitude ; and if the departure was taken from a spot near the S.E.
end of the Lake, the travellers, by holding a due E. course, would strike
the very centre of the Mount. We find that by a typographical error
Mount Wedge was, by our account, placed in long. 134�, in place of
135�, the meridian line of which last passes over it. We should also
have said that Mount Wedge is farther to the in place of
north-wort, than Mr. Eyre placed it ; but Mr. Smith and Cummings
must be wrong in placing it so far to the E. as 135� 20 / or 30', as a
* direct southerly course 5 from these points would have taken a tra-
veller much nearer Sleaford- Bay that Point Drummond. We had
almost forgot to mention that the apparent discrepancy of Mount Wedge
being called conical by one, and like a wedge by the other, is easily re-
conciled, because it might have been conical on one side and like a
wedge on another. It may or may not be wedge-like, but we under-
stand it was named after a Mr. Wedge, of Van Diemen?s Land.?
