Auguft 29, 1771.
The Country called, in the Maps, New Zeland , has been dis-
covered by the Endeavour to be two I Hands, together as large
as Great-Britain ; Thefe IHands, named Aehy-nomawee and
1 ' ovy-poennammoo, are inhabited by a brave and generous race,
who are deftitute of Corn , Fowls , and all Quadrupeds except
Dogs .
Thefe Circumftances being mentioned lately in a Company
of men of liberal fentiments, it was obferved that it feemed
incumbent on fuch a Country as This, to communicate to all
others the Conveniencies of Life which we enjoy.
Dr. Franklin, whofe life has ever been directed to pro-
_ �
mote the true Interefts of Society, faid, ? He would with
? all his heart fubfcribe to a voyage intended to communicate
?in general , thofe benefits which we enjoy to Countries
c< deftitute of them, in the remote parts of the Globe.?
This propofition being warmly adopted by the reft of the
Company, Mr. Dalrymple, then prefent, was induced to
offer to undertake the command on fuch an Expedition.
On mature reflexion, this Scheme appears the mofh ho-
nourable to the National Character of any which can be con-
ceived, as it is grounded on the nobleft principle of benevo-
lence ; Good Intentions are often fruftrated by letting them
remain indigefted ; on this consideration, Mr. Dalrymple was
induced to put the out-lines on paper, which are now pub-
lished, that by an early communication, there may be a better
B 2 opportunity


opportunity of collecting all the hints which can conduce to
execute effectually the benevolent purpofe of the Expedition,
in cafe it fhould meet with general approbation.
On this fcheme being fhewn to Dr. Franklin, he com-
municated his fentiments, by way of Introduction, to the
following effect.
? Britain is faid to have produced originally nothing but
? Sloes . What vaff advantages have been communicated
? to her by the Fruits, Seeds, Roots, Herbage* Animals,
? and Arts of other Countries! We are by their means
fcC become a wealthy and a mighty Nation, abounding in all
? good Things. Does not fome Duty hence arife from us
? towards other Countries till remaining in our former
? State ?
? Britain is now the firff Maritime Power in the world.
? Her Ships are innumerable, capable by their Form, Size,
? and Strength, of failing all Seas, Her Seamen are equally
? bold, fkilful, and hardy ; dextrous in exploring the re-
? moteft regions, and ready to engage in Voyages to un-
? known Countries, tho? attended with the greateft dangers.
? The Inhabitants of thofe Countries, our Fellow-Men, have
? Canoes only ; not knowing Iron, they cannot build Ships ;
? They have little Aftronomy, and no knowledge of the
? Compafs to guide them ; they cannot therefore come to
? us, or obtain any of our advantages. From thefe circum-
? fiances, does not fome duty feem to arife from us to them ?
? Does not Providence, by thefe diftinguifhing Favours,
? feem to call on us, to do fomething ourfelves for the
? common Interefts of Humanity ?
? Thofe who think it their Duty to afk Bread and other
? Bleffings daily from Heaven, fhould they not think it
? equally a duty to communicate of thofe bleffmgs when
? they


? they have received them ; and Ihow their Gratitude to
? their Great Benefactor, by the only means in their power,
? promoting the happinefs of his other Children ?
? Ceres is faid to have made a Journey thro? many Coun-
? tries, to teach the ufe of Corn, and the art of railing it.
? For this fmgle benefit, the grateful Nations deified her.
? How much more may Englilhmen deferve fuch Honour,
? by communicating the knowledge and ufe, not of Corn
? only, but of all the other enjoyments Earth can produce,
? and which they are now in poffeffion of. Communiter bona
? prof under e , Deum eft .
? Many Voyages have been undertaken with views of
? profit or of plunder, or to gratify refentment ; to procure
? feme advantage to oufelves, or do fome mifehief to
? others : but a voyage is now propofed, to vifit a diftant
? people on the other fide the Globe ; not to cheat them,
? not to rob them, not to feize their lands, or enflave their
? perfons; but merely to do them good, and enable them
? as far as in our power lies, to live as comfortably as
? ourfelves.
? It feems a laudable wilh, that all the Nations of the
? Earth were connected by a knowledge of each other, and
? a mutual exchange of benefits ; but a Commercial Na-
? tion particularly fhould wilh for a general Civilization of
? Mankind, fince Trade is always carried on to much greater
? extent with people who have the Arts and Conveniencies
?of Life, than it can be with naked Savages. We may
? therefore hope, in this undertaking, to be of fome fervice
? to our Country, as well as to thofe poor people, who,
? however diftant from us, are in truth related to us, and
u whofe Interefts do, in fome degree, concern every one
? who can fay, Homo fum> &c?

It is propofed that the following twenty perfons fhall be
Truflees, and every perfon who fhall afterwards fubfcribe 100 L
fhall become a Truflee on paying in the Subfcription.
Every Truflee fhall have a Book of the following form for
inferting the Subfcriptions, viz.


In the firft Column, to be inferted the time of Subfcription ;
in the fecond, the Subfcrlber to fign his or her name, and
the fum fubfcribed in the proper column, and in the laft,
the Truftee to fign his or her name, or the initial letters there-
of, when the money subfcribed is received.
That it (ball be in the option of the Subfcriber to pay the
money into the hands of the Truftee, in whofe book the
fubscription is entered at the time of Subfcription, or only to
enter the Name and Subfcription.
That when the fum neceffary for the equipment is fub-
fcribed, proper Committees be appointed, and the particular
plan and regulations fettled, and the Subfcribers be then
called upon for their Subfcriptions ; at which time, if they
do not approve of the meafures then taken, they may be at
liberty to withdraw their Subfcription, provided they do it
forthwith before any expences are incurred.
That no Capital difburfements be made till a fufficient
Sum be received for the expences of the out-fet.
As this is not a Commercial Voyage, no pecuniary return is
to be expected ; but if any fum fhould remain after this
Voyage is finifhed, or any profits arife from it, that fuch
Sums fhall remain for the future profecution of the fame
plan, which is fo extenfive, that proper objedls can never be
wanting.
Such Perfons as are inclined to promote this Undertaking , and
willing to be Truftees, are detired to communicate their fenhments
by the Penny-Poji to Mr. Dalrymple> Soho-Square.
