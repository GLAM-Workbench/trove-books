MISS FJLORA PINK.
Ryle & Co., Printers, 2 & 3, Monmouth
Court, Bloomsbury.
Tune.— A man’s a man for a’ that.
ISS Flora Pink, at me she’d wink.
She’d blush, then smile, and a’ that.
Her face was sweet, she’d pretty feet,
With a pretty hand, and a* that,
And a’ that, and a
A turn-up nose, ano a that:
She always said she was a maid,
But she’d a baby once for a’ that.
She bonnets press’d, was nicely dress’d
In a polka cloak, and a’ that,
She wore a Tell just like a sail,
And a bustle large, and a’ that,
And a’ that, and a’ that.
Her nice kid gloves, and a’ that.
She drank nought but T, but then do you see,
It had a rummy smell for a’ that.
She could not eat the common meat.
But ducks and geese, and a’ that,
’Cos it wandt genteel to make a meal,
But I found her out for a’ that.
And a’ that, and a’ that.
She could do her whack for a’ that,
For she eat one day, juit for a stay,
A tub of wilks for a’ that.
THE
Irish Transport
IN the county of Limerick, near the town o
Ram shorn,
My own native country wherein I was born,
But to some foreign country I was sent for a slave,
Since in my own country I could not behave.
It’s not those long travels that is a trouble to my
mind,
Nor yet those foreign islands where I am close
confined,
But if we are on ship board and my Polly with me,
Bound down in strong irons I should think myself
free.
She used to faint at the sight of pamt,
But her cheeks were red and a’ that.
Her locks fell slack in ringlets black,
But (hey warn’t her own for a’ that.
And a’ that, and a’ that.
Yet she wasn’t gay for a’ that.
To balls she’d go if not too low.
And dance in tights for a’ that,
Oft times have I wonder’d how young women love
young men,
And oft times have I wonder’d how young me'n
love them,
Since a woman has been my ruin and my sad
downfall,
Which has caused me to lie between lime and stone
walls.
She served out tracts and pious facts
For Sunday-schools, and a’ that,
But after prayers she’d go do«n stairs.
And sing comic songs and a’ that,
And a’ that, and a’ that,
Oh, how she’d change and a’ that,
To servant gals, and cookeys* pals.
She fortunes told and a’ that.
God bless my old father that lies in cold clay,
Likewise my dear old mother that is living uufcs
this day,
But the time is approaching when I shall be set
free.
Then I ’ll go straight home to Ireland my Polly fgt
to see.
e day, alas, it came to pass,
I found her out and a’ that,
She got ten years, so it appears.
For bigamy, and a’ that,
And a’ that, and a that.
Though »he went wrong for a’ that,
IreaUv think Miss Flora Pink,
Was a nice young girl for a’ that*
My Polly lives in Limerick town, a girl that I love
dear,
And when I get ray liberty with her I’M make my
fare,
And when I gain my liberty with my Polly I’ll
remain.
I will bid adieu to Vandieman's Land, likewise the
raging main.
