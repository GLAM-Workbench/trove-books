Explanation of the Calendar.
Sun’s Rising and Setting.—These numbers show mean time when sun’s centre,
elevated by refraction, appears above horizon, the eye being on a level with that plane.
Moon’s Rising and Setting.—The same as for the sun, only that the moon is
more depressed by parallax than elevated by refraction. When the mark occurs,
it shows that the moon will only rise or set that day. Thus, on the sth of January,
the moon will only set at Melbourne. This arises from the lunar day being longer
than the solar. The moon,' it will be seen, rises on the 4th at nh. 34m. in the evening;
on the next night she will not rise till 12b. Bm., which is eight minutes after the
commencement of the 6th.
Phases of the Moon. —The times are here given to the nearest minute when the
moon is respectively o°, 90 °, 180°, and 270° of longitude from the sun. Apogee is the
time of her greatest distance from the earth, Perigee of her nearest approach.
Sun’s Declination.—These quantities show the angular distance of the sun from
the equator, measured on a meridian. They are given for apparent noon, or the
instant of the sun’s transit over the meridian of Melbourne, and are very useful for
determining the latitude by meridian altitudes, for which purpose they will serve,
without reduction, sufficiently near for most nautical purposes for the whole of the
Australian coast. Thus, suppose on the Ist of January the altitude of the sun’s
lower limb at meridian transit had been observed to be 73° 22', the height of the eye
being 18 feet above the sea, and the instrument having an index correction of +4',
the computation will stand thus :
Observed altitude lower limb .. .. .. .. 73° 22' o"
Index error .. .. .. .. .. •• + 4°
Dip .. .. .. .. •• •• •• 4 11

True zenith distance .. .. .. ■ .. .. 16 22 6
Sun’s declination .. .. • • • • • • 523 058
Latitude .. .. .. • • • ■ • • • • 539 23 4
The proper way of applying the declination may be easily inferred from the circum-
stance that the sun is vertical on the meridian of that place whose latitude is equal to
the declination. As the sun was observed to be 16° 22' 6" north of the zenith, the place
must be situated so much to the south of where the sun was vertical; if the sun had
been to the south of the zenith, the latitude would have been 6° 38' 52" S. If the
above observation be made on the meridian of Melbourne {l45 0 E. of Greenwich;,
the latitude thus obtained will be quite correct; for any other meridian the declina-
tion would require a correction which might be easily obtained by interpolation, thus,
as 360° : diff. of long. : : diff. of declination in 24 hours : the correction required. But
the maximum error of latitude caused by the neglect of this correction will be less
than two miles, and will be generally much smaller between the limits of Cape
Lemvin and New Zealand.
The Sun’s Semi-diameter is used to reduce an observation of his limb to his centre.
Equation of Time. —This is the difference between true solar and mean solar
time ; it is used to find the latter from an observation of the sun. Thus, suppose on


the ist of January a sun-dial or any other solar observation gave the time 2h. 36m.,
to get the mean time (which is that shown by a well-regulated common clock or
watch) we add 3m. 50s. which makes the mean time ah. 39m. 50s. If the observation
had been made at noon we should have added 3m. 475., the same as in the column,
but for any other time than apparent noon we ought to apply a correction which may
be found by interpolation. For common purposes, however, the equation at nearest
noon will be sufficiently exact.
The Right Ascension of the Mean Sun is the angular distance in time of
the mean or fictitious sun from the first point of Aries at mean noon. It is the side-
real time at mean noon, or that which should be shown by a sidereal clock when the
mean time clock points to 12 at noon. It is used to find the mean time when the
sidereal time is known. Thus, suppose the right ascension of Sirius to be 6h. 39m. 225.,
when therefore it passes the meridian the sidereal time will be 6h. 39m. 225.; by sub-
tracting from this the sidereal time at the previous noon, we shall have the interval of
sidereal time that has elapsed since the preceding noon, which, by means of the sub-
sidiary table given for the conversion of sidereal time into mean solar time, may be
easily reduced into an interval of mean time, as in the following example : —Suppose
that on the xst of January an altitude of Sirius had been observed which showed that
the star was 3 hours to the east of the meridian, the sidereal time would therefore be
3b. 39m. 225.: subtracting from this iBh. 43m. 75., we get Bh. 56m. 15s. for the sidereal
interval since noon; subtracting from this im. 28s. we have Bh. 54m. 475. for the mean
time of the observation. By means of the table of Semi-diurnal Arcs, the times of
rising and setting of the heavenly bodies may be found in a similar manner. If the
right ascension of the true sun is required, it may be found by applying the equation
of time to the right ascension of the mean sun. Thus on the ist of January the right
ascension of the mean sun is iBh. 43m. 75., and that of the true sun is iBh. 46m. 545.
The Moon’s Age is the interval elapsed at mean noon since the last new moon ;
it is given in days and decimal parts of a day.
Moon’s Meridian Passage. —This is the mean astronomical time at which the
moon’s centre passes the meridian, or due north of Melbourne. It is very useful for
finding the time of high water. The symbol (5 > near the time of new moon, shows
that the moon will not pass the meridian that day, the astronomical day beginning at
noon, twelve hours after the commencement of the civil day.
High Water at Williamstown. —The time of this table is civil mean time. It
has been calculated for Gellibrand’s Point, on the assumption that the change tide
takes place at 211. 31m., as deduced by Captain Cox, R.N., the late Admiralty Sur-
veyor, from a discussion of the tide-gauge papers for the year iB6O. When the
mark ... occurs there will be only one tide that day. Thus, on the 9th of January
there will be only a morning’s tide. The times here computed may be taken as the
average ones when high water may be expected ; the tides at Port Philip, however,
are so influenced by winds and other causes that the actual times of high water will
sometimes differ from the calculated ones by more than three hours. The supple-
mentary table for the outports has been taken from the Government Gazette, June
22, 1858.
Duration of Twilight. —This table shows the time taken by the sun to move
from 18 0 below the horizon to sunrise, and to the same distance after sunset, when his
rays cease to illuminate the sky.

At Midsummer,
the days at Beechworth are about eight minutes, at Sandhurst six
ine four, and at Ballarat two minutes shorter than at Melbourne ; at
minutes, Castlemaine four, and at Ballarat two minutes shorter than at Melbourne; at
Geelong, two minutes longer. About March and September the days will be nearly
the same length throughout the colony, and in June the former places will have the
days so much longer.
Polarity Acquired by Position. —lt may not be generally known
that iron vessels, built on stocks pointing nearly north and south, become
highly magnetic, and are in fact mariners’ compasses on a large scale.
This effect is due to the vibration of the plates, which is necessarily
produced by hammering the iron when in this position. A common
poker, treated in the same way, will readily become a magnet. This
curious fact was recently illustrated by the British ship of war North-
umberland. Having been built with her head pointing 1 north, her compass
showed great deviation. By docking her. however, with her bows pointing
south for some time it was found that this effect was greatly reduced, and
it may be in time wholly neutralised.

The right
ascension of the
mean sun is the sidereal time at mean noon.
Astronomical Notices of the Planets.
The sun is in the constellation Leotill the 16th, when he enters Virgo; his distance
from the earth at noon of the ist is 92,308,540 miles. He crosses the equator at
roh. Bm. on the morning of the 23rd, when the Australian spring commences. Mer-
cury will be very favourably situated for observation during this month in the early
evenings. He will be near the bright star Spica on the 19th ; this will serve as a guide
for finding him, which is not generally an easy matter, as the following anecdote will
show, Copernicus lived till he was seventy years of age, yet just before his death
he told a friend that, although he had looked out for M ercury on innumerable occa-
sions, yet he had never succeeded in seeing him. \ enus, Mars, Saturn are also

nh. 15m. p.m. The moon will be near Venus and Mars on the Bth, Saturn on the
gth, and Jupiter on the 22nd. Venus will be in conjunction with Mars on the even-
jng’of the 6th, when the two planets will be separated by a space little larger than
the moon’s diameter. She will be also in conjunction with Saturn on the 26th. These
conjunctions will be an excellent guide for finding the planets, as Venus is so easily
found on account of her great brilliancy.

The tides are so much influenced by the prevailing winds that only an
approximate time of high water at full and change can be arrived at,
which, with observations made at the undermentioned points, are as
follows;
High water at full and change.
TIDAL SIGNALS.
Point Lonsdale.
The following tidal signals are exhibited daily at Point Lonsdale flagstaff
between sunrise and sunset, and the signal-keeper has instructions, if he
sees ships approaching the Heads and running into danger, to warn them
by means of Marryatt’s signals. Strangers therefore should watch these
signals.
Flood-tide Signals.-—A blue flag will be hoisted half-mast high when the
tide begins to flow in the middle of the entrance between Point Lonsdale
and Point Nepean; it will be kept flying all the first quarter of the flood tide.
The second quarter, a blue flag at the mast-head.
The third quarter, a red flag half-mast high.
The last quarter, a red flag at the mast-head.
Ebb-tide Signals. —During ebb tide the signals are as follows, viz.:—
The first quarter, a blue flag half-mast high, with a ball underneath.
The second quarter, a blue flag at the mast-head, with a ball under-
neath.
The third quarter, a red flag half-mast high, with a ball underneath.
The last quarter, a red flag at the mast-head, with a ball underneath.
Irregularity of Tides. —By attention to these signals the true state of
the tide, which cannot always be ascertained by the usual process of
finding the time of high-water, will be known, the strength and duration
of the tide being so much influenced by the wind and weather.

River Yarra.
The height of water in the Yarra is now shown by a self-acting tide-
gauge, erected on the outer red dolphin at the entrance of the river.
To assist persons on board vessels at a distance in ascertaining the
height of water shown by the self-acting tide-gauge, six projecting arms
are fixed on its south side, the upper edge of each arm coinciding with the
lower part of each figure on the face of the tide-gauge, which commences
with the ten-feet mark.
N.B.—The top of the indicator, as it is moved up or down by the tide,
shows on the face of the gauge the height of water over the shoalest part
of the fairway.
Geelong.
The following tidal signals are exhibited on board the Geelong lightship,
to indicate the depth of water on the bar: —

Variation of the Compass at Sea.
The variation of the compass at sea, especially on board iron ships, is one
of the greatest difficulties against which the experienced mariner has to
contend, and not a few disastrous wrecks may be traced to this cause.
Consequent also upon the larger quantity of iron used in wooden ships,
and the character of the freights carried, the deviations on board such
vessels are frequently of a serious character. The attention of scientific
men has for a long time been directed to the devising of some plan whereby
these variations might be detected, and the evil results so frequently
arising from them be avoided. A comparatively simple plan of ascertaining
the error, or amount of variation and deviation combined, was devised
and put in practice some time since. It consists in taking an ordinary
compass-card, and erecting upon its centre, and perpendicular to its plane,
a fine copper wire. At the time of the sun’s meridian passage, as indicated
by the noon observation for latitude, the direction of the shadow cast by
the wire on the compass-card is noted. The angle contained between this
direction and that of the north and south line of the card will give the
local attraction and variation combined. Small errors and many disadvan-
tages are, however, found to attend this plan, owing to the uncertainty of
obtaining the exact meridian altitude when the sun is partially obscured.
To obviate this a most ingenious instrument has been invented by Mr.
W. M. Lowick, the present chief officer of the Titaua, and who for some
time hold a commission in the royal navy. The instrument consists of
a compass-dial, needle, hour-circle, and latitude-arc. The hour-circle
revolves, and is capable of being adjusted to the latitude, thus forming an
ordinary sun-dial for any latitude, which may be used whenever a shadow
from the sun can be obtained. All that is required to ascertain the error
of compass by this beautifully simple instrument is the latitude and

apparent time at ship. We have seen a model of this instrument, which
has been carefully tested at the Sydney Observatory. We understand it
has been registered in New South Wales, and that Mr. Lowick intends to
introduce it to the notice of the Admiralty. The model may now be
inspected onboard the Titaua. Mr. George R. Smalley, F.R.A.S., Govern-
ment astronomer for New South Wales, thus writes relative to this instru-
ment:—“Mr. W. M. Lowick having requested my opinion of an instrument,
constructed by him, for the purpose of finding the deviation of a ship’s
compass caused by local attractions, I beg to state that I have carefully
examined the model submitted for my inspection, and I have much
pleasure in expressing myself well pleased and satisfied with the method
and performance of the instrument. To a degree of accuracy amply
sufficient for the purpose intended is united that first essential, simplicity
of construction and operation, so that its use may be readily acquired by
any intelligent person, and I shall be very happy to hear of its being
adopted when the more difficult and elaborate methods are not or cannot
be employed.’ ’ — The Argus.
The Laws of Storms.
Prof. W. F. Thoms lectured recently in New York upon the laws of
storms. He stated that hurricanes were caused by a portion of the
atmosphere becoming violently heated and acquiring a circular motion
around a centre whereat the air is stationary. Around this focus the air
rushes with great violence. The wind is most furious near the focus, and
there also the shifts of wind are the most rapid. Toward the circumfer-
ence it has less force and the shifts are also longer. Hurricanes most
occur on the northern limits of the north-east trade wind, to the eastward
of the meridian of the West India Islands, and also at the south-east trade
wind, to the eastward of the meridian of the island of Mauritius. At the
change of the monsoons, in May and October, hurricanes occur in the Bay
of Bengal and vicinity. In the China seas hurricanes are called typhoons,
and are produced by the same cause. Hurricanes in north latitude
occur in August and September, and, travelling westward to the West
Indies, take a north-east course, parallel with the Gulf Stream, along the
United States coast. Their diameters vary from 100 to 200 miles, and their
usual progress is about 17 miles per hour. The wind blows in a circle
from riSht to left round the centre. The changes being most rapid near
this centre, it is desirable of all things to avoid it. This can be ascertained
from the direction in which the wind is blowing at the time, and points out
on which side of the storm circle the ship is. If a ship, therefore, is to the
eastward of the West Indies, by heading north she will get out of its
range, or by heaving to and heading southerly, in the direction of the
centre, the wind as it veers from right to left will draw aft, and the ship
will luff up and bow the sea safely. Heaving to on the opposite tack will
insure the ship’s destruction. Hurricanes in southern latitudes occur
usually in the months of February and March. Their diameter is from
150 to 300 miles, and they move from 12 to 30 miles an hour. Dif-
ferently from northern hurricanes, the wind blows in a circle from left to
right; consequently the rule for finding the centre, or focus, in a southern
latitude, is to turn directly away from the wind, and the right hand will
point to the centre. The rule is to heave the ship to on the starboard tack,
with her head toward the focus, and supposing the wind easterly, the
right hand will point to the focus bearing north. She would then be on the
southern verge of the storm of the circle, and, as the wind veers to the
southward, she will luff up and bow the sea. Being in a northern latitude,
the hurricanes of the Bay of Bengal and China Sea revolve in a left direc-
tion, as in the neighbourhood of the West Indies,

Instructions for Saving Drowning Persons by
Swimming to their Relief.
1. When you approach a person drowning in the water, assure him with
a loud and firm voice that he is safe.
2. Before jumping in to save him, divest yourself as far and as quickly
as possible of all clothes, tear them off if necessary; but if there is not time,
loose at all events the foot of your drawers if they are tied, as, if you do
not do so, they will fill with water and drag you.
3. On swimming to a person in the sea, if he be struggling, do not seize
him then, but keep off for a few seconds till he gets quiet, for it is sheer
madness to take hold of a man when he is struggling in the water.
4. Then get close to him and take fast hold of the hair of his head, turn
him as quickly as possible on his back, give him a sudden pull, and this will
cause him to float; then throw yourself on your back also and swim for the
shore, both hands having hold of his hair, you on your back and he also
on his, and of course his back to your stomach. In this way you will get
sooner and safer ashore than by any other means, and you can easily thus
swim with two or three persons ; the writer has often, as an experiment,
done it with four, and gone with them forty or fifty yards in the sea.
One great advantage of this method is thatit enables you to keep your head
up, and also to hold the person’s head up you are trying to save. It is of
primary importance that you take fast hold of the hair, and throw both the
person and yourself on your backs. You can, in this manner, float
nearly as long as you please, or until a boat or other help can be obtained.
5. There is no such thing as a death -grasp, at least it must be
unusual, for we have seen,many persons drowned and have never witnessed
it. As soon as a drowning man begins to get feeble and to lose his recol-
lection, he gradually slackens his hold until he quits it altogether. No
apprehension need therefore be felt on that head.
6. After a person has sunk to the bottom, if the water be smooth, the
exact position where the body lies may be known by the air bubbles which
will occasionally rise to the surface, allowance being of course made for
the motion of the water if in a. tide-way or stream, which will have carried
the bubbles out of a perpendicular course in rising to the surface. A body
may often be regained from the bottom before too late for recovery by
diving for it in the direction indicated by these bubbles.
7. On rescuing a person by diving to the bottom, the hair of the head
should be seized by one hand only, and the other used in conjunction with
the feet in raising yourself and the drowning person to the surface.
8. If in the sea, it may be a great error to try to get to land. If there
be a strong “ outsetting ” tide and you are swimming either by yourself
or having hold of a person who cannot swim, then get on your back and
float till help comes.
9. These instructions apply alike to all circumstances, whether in the
roughest sea or smooth water.
Directions for Restoring the Apparently Drowned.
Send immediately for medical assistance, blankets and dry clothing, but
proceed to treat the patient instantly on the spot, in the open air.
The points to be aimed at are, first and immediately, the Restoration
of Breathing and the Prevention of any further Diminution of the
Warmth of the Body ; and, secondly, after breathing is restored, the
Promotion of Warmth and Circulation.
The efforts to restore breathing, and to prevent any further diminution
of the warmth of the body, must be commenced immediately and
energetically, and must be persevered in for several hours, or until a
medical man has pronounced that life is extinct. Efforts to promo

warmth and circulation must be deferred until
been restored.
TO RESTORE BREATHING.
TO CLEAR THE THROAT.
1. Place the patient on the floor or ground,
with his face downwards, and one of his arms
under the forehead, in which position all fluids
will escape by the mouth, and the tongue itself
will fall forward, leaving the entrance into the
windpipe free. Assist this operation by wiping
and cleansing the mouth.
2. —lf satisfactory breathing commences, adopt
the treatment described below to promote warmth
and natural breathing. If there be only slight
breathing, or no breathing, or if it fail, then—
TO EXCITE BREATHING —
3. —Turn the patient well and instantly on the
side, and—
4. —Excite the nostrils with snuff, hartshorn, or
smelling salts, or tickle the throat with a feather,
&c., if they are at hand. Rub the chest and face
warm, and dash cold water on it.
5. —lf there be no success, lose not a moment,
but instantly
TO IMITATE BREATHING—
6. —Replace the patient on the face, raising and
supporting the chest well on a folded coat or
other article of dress.
7. —Turn the body very gently on the side and
a little beyond, and then briskly on the face,
back again; repeating these measures deliberately,
efficiently, and perseveringly, about fifteen times
in the minute, or once every four seconds, occa-
sionally varying the side.
[By placing the patient on the chest, the weight
of the body forces the air out; when turned
on the side, this pressure is removed, and
air enters the chest.]
8. —On each occasion that the body is replaced on
the face, make uniform but efficient pressure,
with brisk movement, on the back, between and
below the shoulder-blades or bones on each side,
removing the pressure immediately before turning
the body on the side.
[The first measure increases the expiration, the
second commences inspiration.]
*** The result is —respiration or natural
breathing, and if not too late—Life.
CAUTIONS.
1. Be particularly careful to prevent persons
crowding round the body.
2. —Avoid all rough usage and turning the body
on the back.
3.—Under no circumstances hold the body up
by the feet.
natural breathing has
TO PREVENT FUR-
THER DIMINUTION
OF WARMTH.
N.B.—These efforts
must be made very
cautiously, and must
not be such as to pro-
mote warmth and cir-
culation rapidly; for if
circulation is induced
before breathing has
been restored, the life
of the patient will be
endangered. No other
effect therefore should
be sought from them,
than the prevention
of evaporation, and
its result, the diminu-
tion of the warmth of
the body.
1. —Expose the face,
neck, and chest, ex-
cept in severe weather.
2. —Dry the face,
neck, and chest, as
soon as possible, with
anything at hand; and
then dry the hands
and feel.
3. —As soon as
blanket or other cover-
ing can be obtained,
strip the body ; but
if no covering can
be immediately pro-
cured, take dry cloth-
ing from the by-
standers, dry and re-
elothe the body, taking
care not to interfere
with the efforts to
restore breathing.
CAUTIONS.
1. Do not roll the
body on casks.
2. Do not rub the body
with salt or spirits.
3. Do not inject
tobacco-smoke orin-
fusion of tobacco.
4. Do not place pa-
tient in warm bath.
N.B.—The Directions are printed in parallel Columns to avoid confusion,
and to insure that the efforts to obtain both objects shall be carried on al
the same time.

Bewaee op Benzine.— From the facility with which it removes grease-spots
from fabrics this product has come to be regarded almost as a household
indispensable. But few persons, however, realise the explosive character of
benzine, or the dangers attending the careless handling of the liquid. Being one
of the most volatile and inflammable products resulted from the distillation of
petroleum, it vaporises with great rapidity, so that the contents of a four-ounce
vial, if overturned, would reader the air of a moderate-sized room highly ex-
plosive. The greatest care should be exercised in handling this liquid in
proximity to fire, and it is important to remember that the vapour escaping from
an uncorked bottle will cause a flame to leap over a space of several feet.

pith and cut up the inside before mixing; then add one ounce of whole ginger to
every ten pounds of melon, which must be well bruised and placed in a muslin
bag, and boiled with the melon until flavoured to taste ; the whole to be boiled
five hours, and kept well stirred. This jam is strongly recommended to the
useful housewife, as being a cheap and wholesome substitute for butter, and
more suitable than butter for children’s use.
Mosquito Bites. —The following preparation reduces the pain and swelling:—•
Extract of drachm ; glycerine, J oz.; water, 31 ozs.
Chilblains. —Dissolve 8 grains of crystallised caustic in 1 oz. of rose or
distilled water; apply with a brush or feather, and allow to dry on. This will
turn the skin black, but the chilblain will speedily disappear. Keep the mixture
in the dark, and do not apply to a broken chilblain. To broken chilblains apply
this ointment:—Sweet oil, I pint; Venice turpentine, 3 ozs.; hog’s lard, |lb.;
beeswax, 3 ozs. Spread on a thin rag and apply. It is also good for chapped
hands, &c.

EDUCATION.
The information furnished in the sixth report of the Board of Education, dating up to
March, 1868, is general
y of a very satis
factory character. Comparing
867 with the
Litigation.—ln 1867 there were 310 causes entered for trial in the Supreme and
Circuit Courts (including one for assessment of damages). The total damages claimed
was £154,931, and the total awarded ,£27,379. The criminal cases tried before the
Supreme Court numbered 414, of which 305 were charges of felony and 109 mis-
demeanours. Before Courts of General Sessions there were 407 cases tried, and 263
convictions obtained. There were 14,433 cases tried in fifty County Courts, the aggre-
gate amount sued for being £276,372, the amount recovered £105,346. Courts of
Mines were held in thirty-three places ; 203 suits were heard, the aggregate value of
demand being £50,096. Courts of Petty Sessions were held at 173 places, at which
there were heard 2470 cases of indictable offences, and 1082 persons were com-
mitted for trial. In the summary jurisdiction of these courts 39,865 cases of offences
were heard, the convictions being 25,379. Of civil cases there were 27.693 dealt with,
the aggregate of demand being/194,633, and the amount awarded being £108,350.
Intestate Estates.—There were 258 intestate estates in 1867. The amount
received by the Curator was £5266 18s. Bd.; the amount paid, £2361 3s. 4d.
Insolvencies.—The following is a comparative return for the last five years :
The information furnished in the sixth report of the Board of Education, dating tip to
March, 1868, is generally of a very satisfactory character. Comparing 1867 with the
previous year, an increase is shown of 47 schools, 5760 children on rolls, and 4x27 in
average attendance. The returns for March, 1868, give 77,388 children on rolls, and
58,333 in average attendance, an increase over 1867 of 5619 enrolls and 4802 in
average attendance. The number of schools at same date was 772, comprising 819
separate departments—viz., 30 boys, 32 girls, 27 infants, and 730 mixed.
Estimating that 17,243 children were attending private schools at 31st March, it
appears that out of a population of 664,570 there were 119,149 children attending
schools, being 17 ’93 per cent., or one out of 5 '5B of population ; but taking the actual
returns for 1867 the percentage would be i 6 -28, or one out of 6'i4. At March 31st
of this year 100,085 children between the school ages of 5 and 15 were attending
school, being 6x'32 per cent., or nearly 2 out of 3 of the whole number of the popula-
tion between these ages ; but the actual returns for 1867 show the percentage for that
year to be 55 ’6B, or 5 out of 9. The actual attendance of each child on the roll
equalled 132 school days, while in Canada the average attendance does not exceed 96
days, and in England 129 days. In Ireland the average attendance is per cent,
of total number attending school; in Victoria, 48'68 per cent.
INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.
The object aimed at by the Government in the maintenance of these institutions is
to give the neglected children of the colony such a moral and industrial training as
will fit them to become useful members of society. Number of children received
during 1867, 508; discharged on license, 292; remaining at end of year, 1634. In
addition to above, at end of 1866 there were 142 children on board the training-ship ;
38 were received* and 38 discharged during 1867. Deaths —in 1865, 11 per cent.;
1866, about 9 per cent.; 1867, a little over 3 per cent. Of the children admitted in
1867, 56 per cent, were under 8 years of age ; 34 per cent, under 6 years ; 16 per cent,
under 4 years; nearly 5 per cent, under 2 years; and 18 were infants under 1 year.
Sixty-six were licensed to employers in 1867. Of those admitted during year, 260
were members of Church of England, 160 Roman Catholic, 39 Presbyterian, 20
Wesleyan, 2 Independent, and 5 unknown. 1058 of the children could read, 991
write, and 894 cypher. The estimated value of their labour during the year is set
down as £4730. The annual maintenance of the children cost £25 15s. xod. per
head at Prince’s Bridge, £26 ss. at Sunbury, and £2l 15s. at Geelong.
Wages and salaries cost £ 10,987 ; necessaries and maintenance, £28,221.
*As shown by insolvents’ schedules. Note.—This return does not include trans-
actions in Geelong District Insolvent Court prior to 1864.

These calculations are supposed not to be absolutely correct, as there is little doubt
that a much larger quantity of gold is raised in the colony than is recorded in the
returns.
In 1867 there were 470 steam-engines employed in alluvial and 532 in quartz
mining, of an aggregate horse-power respectively of 9863 and 9955 tons ; number of
stamp heads, 5529 ; the total value of the machinery being £2,079,195 ; the estimated
value for each district being—Ballarat, £713,775 ; Beechworth, £246,607 ; Sandhurst,
£421,150; Maryborough, £'211,500; Castlemaine, £254,805; Ararat, £110,558: Gipps
Land, £120,800.
In 1867, 2381 auriferous quartz reefs had been opened, and 868J£ square miles of
auriferous ground worked more or less.

Principal Towns in Victoria.


JANIjARY, so called from the Roman Deity, Janus. In his temple he was
represented with two and sometimes with four faces, the latter very seldom.
The two faces were in opposite directions: one withered and wrinkled, indicating the
past; the other youthful, bold, and animated, representing the future. By some he
was identified with Noah ; by others, one of the Roman kings who was deified after
his death. January has not always been the first month of the year. The Athenians
began their year in June ; the Macedonians in September; the Romans in March,
and afterwards in January; the Persians on the nth of August; the Mexicans on
23rd February ; the Mahomraedans in July. In February 24, 1582, Pope Gregory
introduced the New Calendar—called New Style—and ordered that January should
be the first month of the year. The Protestant countries of Europe clung to the old
system of computation until 1700, when it was generally adopted on the continent.
King James in Scotland, in a.d. 1600, proclaimed the alteration of New Year’s Day
throughout his realm, but did not enforce the change in England when he succeeded
to its throne ; and it was not until 1752 that the “old style” gave place to the new,
and changed the new year from March 25 to January 1.
February derives its name from Februo, “ I purify,” because in this month the
Romans offered sacrifices for the purification of their tribes. The Saxons called this
month “ Sol-monath" or “pancake month,” because in it cakes were offered to the sun,
and “ Sol ” or “ Soul ” meant “ food ” or cakes.
March is so called from Martins , the name given to this month by Romulus, the
founder of the Roman Empire, in honour of his reputed father, Mars, the God of War.
April is so called from Aperio , to open or set forth, because of the general
opening or awakening of nature after its long winter 'sleep. The Saxons called it
Osier, or Easter-monath , because at that period they celebrated a great festival in
honour of the goddess Eostre, or Ostara, probably the same as the Astarte of the
Greeks.
May is believed to have derived its name from Mata, the daughter of Atlas and
Pleione, and the mother of Mercury. After death she with her sisters formed the
celestial constellations of Hyades and Pleiades, in the latter of which Mata was the
most brilliant. The Saxons termed this month “ Tnmilke, because in that monath
they began to milke their kine three times m the day."
June probably derives its name from the goddess Juno, queen of the ancient
heathen Pantheon, in whose honour Ovid says a festival was celebrated on the Ist of
this month. It was kept by all the women, and was called Matronaha or Matraha.
As Juno was the special protector of the female sex. so June was regarded as the most
favourable period for marrying. Our Saxon ancestors gave to June the name of
“ Weyde-monath , because their beasts did then weyd in the meddowes,” that is to
say, go to feed there.
July, so called in honour of Julius Csesar, who was born in this month, and who
during his consulate reformed the calendar, which was three months in advance of the
real time. He added 90 days to that year, making it 445 days, and adapted the year
for the future to the sun’s course. The Saxon name for July was Hen-monath or
Hay-nwnath, “because therein they usually mowed or made their hay harvest;” or,
as some antiquarians say, Hen-monath means, foliage month, a title very appropriate
to July in Europe.
August, so called in honour of the Emperor Augustus. Its ancient name among
the Romans was Sextilis , “the sixth,” reckoning from March, which was then the
first month of the year. Augustus rectified some errors of the calendar, and it was
decreed that as he was first admitted to the consulate, and thrice entered the city of
Rome in triumph in the month Sextilis, and as that month had been a most fortunate
one for the empire, it should be called Augustus ; hence our August. The Augustan
era commenced B.C. 27. _
September, named from sepiem, “seven”—this'being the seventh month m the
Roman calendar —and imber, “ rain.”
October, from octo, “.eight”—being the eighth month according to the Roman
calendar—and imber, “rain.” Its name was frequently changed by them. Domitian
gave it his name, but it lasted no longer than his life. It was called Faustinas \yy
Antoninus Pius, in honour of his wife Faustinus. It was named Invictus, one of the
titles of Commodus, and in honour of him. The Saxons gave October the name of
“ Winter-fylleth or the winter full moon. It was also called by them “ Teotha-
7nonath,” or the tenth month. _ _
November, so called from novent, “nine”—being the ninth month in the Roman
calendar. Our Saxon ancestors gave to it the name of “ Blot-monath,” the blood-
month, for at this season they were accustomed to sacrifice many animals to their
gods, and also killed many as a provision for the winter.
December — decern, “ ten”—being the tenth month in the Roman calendar.
