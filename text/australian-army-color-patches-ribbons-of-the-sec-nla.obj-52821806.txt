History of
COLOR PATCHES
of
AUSTRALIAN ARMY
COLOR patches of the Australian Mili-
tary Forces had their origin in the
1914-18 war in colored flags staked in
unit lines to make units easier to And in
big camps.
A simple system of shapes and colors
was adopted and was so helpful that
soldiers were ordered to wear miniatures
of their unit flags on each sleeve, just be-
low their shoulders, to make them readily
identifiable with their units.
In the case of an infantryman the shape
of his patch signified his division. If his
patch was divided horizontally the lower
color was that of his brigade and the upper
his battalion. If divided vertically, the
rearmost color was his brigade and the
foremost his battalion.
With modifications this system persists
today, the modifications being due to the
greater number of shapes and more intri-
cate patterns that were necessary to
identify the greater number of units in
Australia’s army in the 1939-45 war.
Color patches of the original expedition-
ary force of the 1939-45 war—6, 7, 8 and 9
Divisions—followed those of the first four
divisions of the expeditionary force of the
1914-18 war—l, 2,3, 4 and 5 Divisions which
had been adopted for the Militia divisions
between the wars. To distinguish the
1939-45 A.I.F. force it wore its unit colors
on a grey background of the divisional
shape.
But because early in the 1939-45 war
divisions were reduced from four infantry
brigades to three, and brigades from four
infantry battalions to three each, the last
war sequence of battalions within brigades
and divisions was lost. This added to the
difficulties of patch reading.
When Japan entered the 1939-45 war
many soldiers of the Militia volunteered
for service anywhere in the world, they
“went A.1.F.” and became entitled to wear
grey surrounds to their patches, although
still members of militia units.
Thus duplication of many patches of 1
and 6 Divisions, 2 and 7 Divisions, 3 and
8 Divisions, and 4 and 9 Divisions, resulted.
To distinguish itself, 9 Division changed
its divisional shape from the circle of 4
Division to a T.
The other divisions overseas, 6, 7 and 8,
did not change their shapes, but many
members of 8 Division divided their color
patch with a vertical grey bar and called
the result the “Broken Eighth.” The grey
frame of this shape is shown on Page 29.
Formation of the Armored Divisions
called for new patches, and the colors
originally adopted were those of the Light
Horse of the 1914-18 war.
Most soldiers in the Second A.I.F. wore
two patches. The top was a miniature of a
former unit with which they served either
in 1914-18, or in the 1939-45 war in the
Middle East or Malaya, and the larger and
lower patch was their latest unit.
A 1945 ruling allowed soldiers who did
not see service in the Middle East or
Malaya, and had been transferred' from
their original units, to wear miniatures of
their former units.
By the beginning of 1945 color patches
of the 1939-45 war had become so
numerous and complex that the Army
began their simplification. All the new
patches issued so far are included in this
book, most of them on Page 26. The
effect of the simplification was to reduce
the number of patches by many hundreds.
This does not mean that the color
patches worn for the greater part of the
1939-45 war will disappear. They can all
be worn in miniature if 2nd A.I.F. soldiers
continue to serve in the Militia forces.
Throughout this book it must be remembered that the grey surround
is worn only by members of the 2nd A.I.F.
