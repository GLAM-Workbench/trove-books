The First Chapter of Revelations.
THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF QUEENSLAND.,
J. BAILEY BROWN.
" FACTS ARE STUBBORN THINGS."
THIS Colony is in the thirty-second year from its birth, has a population
of 420,000, a debt of �B3,ooo,ooo?thirty-tliree milllions?making a
liability per capita of �BO for every man, woman, and child ; or, taking
the adult males at one-fifth, of �4OO each ! This is a pretty good
beginning for a young colony. Had the money been well and profitably
invested we should have had a population of at least a million of
contented people fully employed, producing most of the articles required
for our own consumption as well as a large surplus for export. As it
is, we are reducing our working capital by importing articles of
consumption from our neighbouring colonies, and have a discontented
population partially employed, many claiming to be idle, applying for
government assistance. Now for our financial position. Our debt is
composed of �28,000,000 funded, �5,000,000 unfunded, together
�38,000,000. Against this, we have assets, which, taken at their
marketable value and cost price, would amount to about �12,500,000,
equal to seven shillings and sixpence (7/6) in the pound. In addition,
we have " Deferred Assets " ?land and water ?on which it would be
impossible to place a value, as this will depend on the use which is
made of them. Judging from the antecedents of our different Govern-
ments, the value of our land assets would be small. The four hundred
millions (400,000,000) ?acres rough and smooth ?might be estimated


all round at a shilling an acre, or �20,000,000 would about make the
estate worth twenty shillings in the pound with time. The water
asset, on which the Government does not place any value, would not
figure anything if the Insolvent Estate ot Queensland were to be wound
up. (See balance sheet attached).
The Government Financial Statements laid before the public are
so framed that to the ordinary mind they do not convey any information
of practical utility, but, on the contrary, tend to mystify and conceal
the truth, so that if this had been the original intention it conld not
have been more successful. For any practical purpose it is worse than
useless, and leaves the taxpayer and the parties from whom assistance
will be required in a hopeless fog as to the true position.
In examining the Financial position of the colony, it must
be borne in mind, that the system on which the Government
has been conducted is rotten in principle, and is the chief cause of
the present congestion, fjom which nothing short of the most drastic
treatment can relieve it, to be followed by a thoroughly radical financial
reform to save it from a worse position in the future. It must be
treated in the same manner as a business estate in Insolvency,
premising that no cheese-paring, tinkering, or half measures can
succeed.
The complete control exercised by the Government over all public
works and virtually irresponsible control of the public funds has des-
troyed the spirit of self-reliance so necessary in a new country based on
democracy when the people are supreme and supposed to govern
themselves. The necessity of securing Government influence and
the funds requisite to carry out all public works has resulted in thorough
political demoralisation, so that instead of trusting to private enterprise
everybody falls back on the Government to assist them in every under-
taking?public or private ?and take their turn at milking the Govern-
ment cow ; while the latter, to maintain their positions, undertake to
find money for everything, whether they have funds applicable to the
purpose or not, hence the misappropriation of loan aud other funds
raised for specific objects, while the ? Guardians of the public purse ?
each having his own axe to grind are quiescent or in other words
conniving at the iniquity.
On making an analysis of the Financial statements presented to
the colony by the late Government and since adopted by the present
Coalition Ministry, the first thing that attracts attention is the exact
agreement between the amount of the authorised loans and the puplie
debt so called which both amount to �28,105,684. This exact agreement
would at once attract the notice of an auditor in examining the balance
sheet ?of an estate in Insolvency and excite his suspicion. Let us
apply the same test to the Goverment accounts and see how they will
bear examination.
Taking the amount of the authorised loans ?excepting the amount
placed on the market in 1889 of �2,204,784, which included �709,900,


balance of the Ten Million Loan of 1884, the gross proceeds of which
are stated at �2,215,587, we have a gross amount sold of �25 840 950'

How is it none of our Legislators have ever noticed these descrepancies ?
These will possibly admit of an explanation by the Auditor-
General, but are, at least, an evidence of the loose manner in which
the Government accounts are kept. The amount of the 6 per cent loan
maturing in July 1, 1891 (this year) is �1,170,000, to redeem which it
will be necessary to float a B�% loan of about �1,280,000, which, at: ;
about the same rate as last loan?which is highly improbable would -
show a saving of about �25,500 per annum. The last of the 6% loan?-
�765,600?wi1l mature in 1895, not this year, as stated by Sir Thomas
Mcllwraith, alter that the first ol the 4% loans will mature in 1913
One of the errors in making the Loan Estimates has been?in ,
regulating the expenditure on the gross amount of the loan instead of the *
probable net amount , leaving the balance?composed of the discount and
charges (about 15%) ?to be made up by a future loan, deficit beino- with-
drawn in the meantime from the fund in hand. ?
If a thorough report were furnished of the management of this,-
fund it would form a curiosity of financial legerdemain. Large balances,
which ought to have been drawing interest, have been allowed to
remain idle, or used for bolstering up local banks; and when deposited
on interest-bearing accounts, we look in vain for any amount arising
rom this souice being placed to the credit ol the loan account to which,
it properly belongs. In the absence of any explanation we can only
suppose that it is included under ? Miscellaneous Services,? as ?Other
Receipts,? and applied as ordinary revenue and spent accordingly.
This item is estimated in the present Ways and Means at �150,000.
If the amount lost to the colony from the mismanagement of the
balance of the Loan Fund in hand could be ascertained it would astonish
people, and, in an ordinary estate, would form the ground for a serious
against the authors. As a case in point, it was stated during the last
Griffith Government that there were �2,000.000 laying idle in London
at a period when the rate for money was only 1%. This being in the


Bank of England would not be drawing any interset. Money at the
same period in the colony was worth from 2 or 3to 6% on deposit.
Is there not an independent member in the House who will move
;a return of the interest received on this fund, particularising amoun
in hand periodically, and showing how desposed of, giving at the same
time the rates of money in London and the colony at such periods .
Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, the present Treasurer, at the eleventh
hour, promises a reform in treatment of the Loan Fund, keeping a
separate account of the expenditure under this head also the fulfilme t
in future of obtaining the sanction of the House according to law. He
admits that ?we have expended a very large amount of loan hi y
without authority,? and further ? on that a Loan Bill will require
to be brought in at a very early stage.? This has not been done. This
is a clear admission of a breach of trust. How would this be treated m
the case of a treasurer of a public company, or a private firm . is
there no law to reach a public servant? Vn{orinn&te\y, ihe? has
been a new clause sanctioned by the House in the Au i o ~ '
which authorises the expenditure of any sum from the Loan Fund in
hand to make up any deficit which may be required to complete any
authorised expenditure for any contract in course o comp e ion
overriding the authority of the House. Mr. Nelson tried m vain to
limit the amount to 10 or 15%, but a subservient House sanctioned the
amendment. So much for our representatives. It will be hard, if not
impossible, to float a loan at present, or for some time t0
meet the deficit irrespective of future requirements. To show what a
farce the present sanction of Parliament-so strongly insisted on for
expenditure of public money?is, one specimen may suffice. In 18��,
there was a sum of �50,000 included in the Loan .
Bores. Up to the end of 1889 there had been spent �206,0001 without
any sanction of the House as far as can be traced. The question
naturally arises, by what sanction, and from what fund . Although i
two or three cases the result was satisfactory, in t � ma J y
bores were failures. A small charge was made for the use of the
water, but no credit appears in the account. If this is a specime
the result to be expected it ought to satisfy the Public with regard to
the proposal to establish ? Water Trusts.? A further gum of �50,000
was voted in 1889. How much has been spent m this irregular way
since, it would be hard to tell. It has been since stated that �6OO or
�7OO has been received for water supplied, while the annual cost
superintending the bores is �5,000. The water is not available for
irrigation. The local parties for whose benefit these weie sunk will
neither pay a rate equal to the interest on the money invested or even
take them over at cost price. A strange comment this on trusting to
the honor of the public! _ m ,. . .
The first item in our liabilities is Railways. This is 8
vortex which has swallowed nearly two-thirds of our Loan Liabhlity?
N.B.?Mr. J. B. Henderson?s last report ie out of print and unattainable.


117 OPPU? b 7 , tht l " 7, �blic " Debt Account being, up to 1889,
�17,266,162 out of a total loan account of �28,105,684. The whole of
this has been expended, and at present the amount to the debit of this
aecount is little short of �20,000,000. Twenty millions, with the
lesult that the net return is stated at 19s. iOd.? nineteen and,
tenpence per cent, per annum, which is rather amusing. But taking
into account that the salaries paid out of the Loan Fund amount to
properly belongs to the Railway account, the proba-
bility is that the Railway investment does not pay 15 per cent, per
annum. This expenditure is a standing disgrace to the colony, and
a reckless and criminal waste of public money, saddling the over-
burdened taxpayers with a yearly deficit of more than half a million!
it is notorious that these railways were largely built for political and
party purposes. No doubt many of these lines which are now, as
Mr. Donaldson terms, suckers, will eventually become feeders, but
before this takes place it will be necescary to complete the main
ines and open up the country by a comprehensive system of irriga-
tion and water conservation, which should have preceded the railways,
otherwise many of the raihvays will remain for many years dead
capital, and an incubus on the industry of the colony. In addition
to the reckless investment, the gross mismanagement to be expected
from Government control has aggravated the evil.
. We now come to tlie Civil Service?another blot on our financial
mismanagement, and part of the traditional policy on which our
Government is run. This service has been looked upon from time
immemoiial for providing for the ?' sisters and cousins and aunts "
of members of the Government and " The House," and has been
commenced 011 a magnificent scale out of all proportion to the
requirements of the colony. Sir Thomas M'llwraith admits " that
the Civil Service of the colony is to a considerable extent over-manned."
Then how account for the sympathy felt for the Civil servants and the
disinclination to apply the pruning knife thoroughly to the " noble
army of martyrs," as they are looked on ? Mr. Donaldson says "it
would be heartless and cruel to turn men adrift who would find it
difficult to make their own living." Does he see the irony of this
admission tEither these men were not competent to earn their own
living, or the Government service has so demoralised them as to
t unfifc for an y other employment. Mr. Macrossan says
that there were several old men in the service who, if dismissed,
would have to fall back on Dunwich. Whose fault is this ? Their
-own improvident habits, for which the taxpayer is to suffer, thus
constituting them " public pensioners ." Was this ever contemplated,
or provided for ? The fact is, the Civil servants have been placed in
a -Ti P osl^lon through in being made " (Government proteges," and
will have to be reduced to their proper level by being made' to do a
air day s work for a fair day's pay. This day's work has been tacitly
agreed 011 as eight hours, and they should be taught to provide for


their own future like other employees, and must he prepared to share
in the same contingencies as others. Everybody will sympathise
with them if they suffer from the inevitable necessity arising out of our
extravagant and. wasteful expenditure, of which they have had more
than their share.
The money advanced to corporate bodies and divisional boards
under the name of ? endowments ? ?which would mean gifts, more
correctly speaking, loans ?is estimated by Mr. Donaldson at about
�2,000,000 (two millions) ; but where the money came from, or the
terms on which advanced, there is not any special account.
The balance stated as in the Treasury by Sir Thomas MTI wraith is
�2,886,000, while Mr. Donaldson accounts for only �2,042,500 in
London and local banks. The former says, in his financial statement,
? After providing for the full expenditure of �1,800,000 generally,
from the loan, ; but which includes �1,140,000 for railway works, there
will be left still for railwav works to finish under the present contracts
an amount of �814,670.? At the end of the session, ? Loan Balances
available ? were stated �3,350,000. Which of these statements is
correct ? In addition, he (Sir Thomas MTI wraith) states that there
are plans ready to be laid before the House for parliamentary sanction
of 5054 miles ?estimated cost without land resumption, �2,206,000' ?
and 1203f partly surveyed; which at about the same rate would cost
five or six millions ; together, about �7,500,000 ?seven millions and
a half ! Our ideas of spending money are truly grand, encouraged,
no doubt, by the success (?) of Sir Samuel Griffith?s ten million loan!
Sir Thomas says ? the demands for railways come in ?not one word
with regard to irrigation !
It is scarcely necessary to enter into the proposal of Sir Thomas
Mill wraith to meet the anticipated deficit on the current year, while
the retrenchment is, like that in the Civil Service, ? fact, any-
thing to mention,? ?what Mr. Donaldson styles and
tinkering.
Here we have a large estate with ample assets, and unexampled
future prospects, with a mortgage on it of �28,000,000 ?twenty-eight
millions ?and a deficit of about five millions more to be provided for
at an early date. Shipwrecked by the ignorance and worse of its
managers, who do not appear to have yet realised their position, and
who have not the ability or moral courage to apply the only remedy,
but have wasted the greater part of the late session in mutual recrimi-
nations and undignified personalities, each trying to shift their
responsibilities from their own shoulders and impute their present
position,- to a great extent, to the late floods, badness of trade, &c.,
and when retrenchment is proposed in a branch of the public service
which will admit of it, indulge in a lot of sentimental gush over
the slaughter of the innocents, which would be all very well if they
were dealing with their own funds, instead of acting as the trustees
of the owners of the estate and the mortgagees. To arrive at a proper


estimate of the position we must sink sentiment and boldly face the
difficulties necessary to carry out a radical reform. We must adopt
the same plan with the public estate as we would with any other
estate in a difficulty.
The first thing necessary is to make out an intelligible balance-sheet
stating the liabilities and assets, and see how far we can carry out
retrenchment, and make the most of our assets and power of taxation.
LOAN FUND.? Sir Thomas M'llwraith has promised in future a
separate account of this fund. How far his promise will be kept
remains to be seen. Unless it is full, clear and intelligible to the
ordinary taxpayer without requiring explanation it will be worse than
useless. He has promised that an amount will be included in the
next loan to cover the amount already spent without authority.
Whether he calculates that the country will, on the fulfilment of this
promise, condone past irregularities, it is hard to say. This is to be
doubted. This being satisfactorily arranged, we should then start
de novo with any new loan, and a separate account should be periodi-
cally laid before the country, of receipts and expenditure on this
acconnt. The same plan should be adopted with regard to the Con-
solidated Revenue ?which is a misnomer, causing confusion?showing
amounts received under the difierent headings and how expended,
a separate account of all sums being kept, of all sums already
advanced as loans to public bodies, from which returns are expected,
distinguishing the terms on which such advances have been made'.
This should form a separate account under the head of advances."
The fund arising from revenue should be only liable for the ordinary-
expenses of (xovernment unless raised for special purposes authorised
by Parliament.
The two first things to be considered in adjusting an insolvent
estate, is to'it-certain the value of the assets, and how far they are
available. In making any calculation as to the former, it is necessary
to bear in mind that the public accounts as laid before the country
have been really more than a year in arrears ; so that the accounts
for the expenditure to the end of the financial year ending June 30th
are only laid before the House in July following. This is to be altered
m future, by the Auditors Amendment Act. In the meantime, any
statement in a balance-sheet must be to a great extent based on' con-
jecture ; still, it will answer the present purpose sufficiently well.
As to the question of retrenchment, the data are more reliable.
Hithei to, the idea of a sinleinq fund does not appear to have entered
into the mind of any person, owing to the facility with which loans-
have been raised. These were looked to supply every extravagant
expenditure, and meet all maturing loans. When the magnitude of
the next loan is stated, and the purposes for which it is it- will
suggest a spirit of inquiry which may be rather an unpleasant dose
to swallow, but may be the means of setting up a more healthy tone
in our colonial management.
o


Row for retrenchment. This can only be accomplished by cutting'
down our Government expenditure in the same way that our trading
?community has been obliged to do, either by reducing their working
staff, or their salaries, or both. Ro doubt it is very unpleasant,
whatever alternative may be adopted; but necessity has no law, nor
is there any reason why the public servants should be exempt from
the general rule. The overburdened taxpayer must be considered
first. The Civil Service comes first on the list for retrenchment, and
is a difficult and delicate one to handle. It is very hard to be obliged
to decapitate your own protege or those of your friends, particularly
as they have been brought up to look on themselves as a privileged
?class, entitled to special consideration, and quite different from the
shopman or clerk who have had hard work and small pay. Few
people thing of these when they are suddenly cast adrift and have
never had a chance of laying by for a rainy day. The greater number
of these have no place to fall back on but the cheap boarding-house;
while many of the former have had the option of providing something
for the future ; and among the junior members many have comfort-
able homes to receive them. There are different ways of dealing
with the difficulty : one, by making them work the regulation time of
eight hours a day, which would reduce the number employed one-
fourth ; another, by removing the surplus number acknowledged to
?exist, and re-adjusting the salaries of the remainder. It will be a
difficult question, but the public will expect it. How much may be
saved from this source it is hard to estimate ?say from �lOO,OOO to
�200,000 a-year, which should be a pei*manent saving:
The next retrenchment that can be made will be by stopping all
advances from revenue for all works from which a return may be
expected. Let a special loan be included in the loan account, or
negotiated in the open market, as in other colonies, which would be
preferable, as the conditions would be more likely to be fulfilled.
This reduction is being carried out with regard to loans to corpora-
tions and divisional boards. These, however hard in some cases,
must be taught to stand on their own merits. In case of harbours
and rivers, a proper scale of dues should be fixed to pay a return on
the amount already expended, and these also placed on their own
bottoms. At present the outlay has been, as stated, about �2,000,000
?two millions. Sir T. M'llwraith merely says there is no return
from this source.
Row as it is not necessary to wind up the colonial estate, let us see
what prospect there is of working it out to a successful result, on its
merits, with the means at our disposal. Fortunately, the liabilities,
with the exception of a small amount maturing in 1895, are spread
over a period of eleven years, as follows, the largest amount com-
mencing in 25 years :


Amount required to leave estate intact and meet
loan of �1,170,950, maturing in 1891, about ... �5,000,000
Loan maturing in 1895 ... ... ... ... �750,000

Do. 1924 �13,000,000
Stated in round numbers, to simplify matters ... �27,000,000
We have thus breathing time before the maturity of any heavy
engagements.
In dealing with our Land Asset, a complete revision of our policy
will have to be initiated from a practical point of view, ignoring all
? wild cat ? theories and Utopian ideas, keeping in view the develop-
ment of the productions for which the soil and climate are suitable,
so as to give employment to the greatest number, and create an export
trade and a large home demand, besides attracting capital. In the
case of this colony, ? population should he looked on as our great source of
wealth.? All efforts to check this with a view to retain a monopoly
for the present occupiers should be resisted.
To realise the value of our land, the first step should be to inau-
gurate a comprehensive and complete system of irrigation and water con-
servation. This would at once give an increased value to our Land
Asset, and render a large quantity saleable which is now valueless,
and should, if properly worked, become in time a large source of
income, as well as forming a sinking fund towards the payment of
our loan liability. It has been the opinion of some high authorities
that irrigation should have preceded our railway system, or at least
have gone hand-in-hand with it, but the error has been already com-
mitted, and it should now be the ? first ? of our Government to
repair it at once, and that thoroughly, not by the shilly-shally expe-
dient of ? Artesian bores,? or the establishment of ?water trusts,?
which latter have proved a failure in the colony of Victoria, and
which might be abused for political purposes, as our railway system
has unfortunately been, but by the adoption of a comprehensive Irri-
gation Bill, based on that of the State of Colorado in America,
whereby the water of the State has been declared the property of the people ,
to be utilised for their benefit. Nothing short of this will satisfy the people
of this colony. ?
After the fiasco committed by the Governments of this colony
with regard to our railways, the people will be averse to trust any
Government with funds for the purpose of carrying out a system of
irrigation even if a loan could be floated, which is more than doubt-
ful in our present financial position, when, as Mr. Macrossan says, .
?our borrowing powers have come to an end.? Still, for such a profitable
investment, and with such good security as the Government would be

on thg same plan as the Grovernment accounts the whole commercial
community would be hopelessly insolvent. So would this colony if
not enabled to indefinitely postpone the payment of their engagements.
There may be a limit to this, however.


SUMMARY.
The foregoing balance-sheet shows the nearest possible approxima-
tion to the present financial position of the colony, in round numbers,
leaving out fractions for the purpose of simplifying and making the
statement more intelligible.
The only addition to the assets which requires explanation is
? the deferred assets ? ?land and water. These are hypothecated to
the national creditors. If properly developed?and the value will entirely
depend on the use made of them ?? taken together, they are ample to
pay the interest on the whole debt and provide a sinking fund to pay
off the principal before maturity.? admit of pi oof.
r
Among the many parties who have brought forward proposals for
the settlement of the land not one has suggested where the requisite
funds are to come from, and by whom to be worked. No one in their
senses would leave it in the hands of the Government; besides, they
have not any funds, present or prospective, for the purpose. Its
acquisition requires deep consideration. Any revenue derived from land
forms part of our revenue proper, and cannot be legally diverted to any
other purpose. The people are prepared to back up a more liberal land
policy, and instead of locking it up, to open it up.
Before any reform can be carried out, it is first of all necessary
that each party should realise and act up to their responsibilities. In
the foregoing remarks the Executive have had their responsibilities and
shortcomings fully and clearly stated ; it only now remains to state
those of the others, who are as much, if not more to blame?the
general body of taxpayers and working men ; the former for their
general apathy and tacit acquiescence, the latter for not bringing their
influence to bear on the polls, instead of wasting their energies in
useless strikes, in which success would be more diastrous than defeat.
? Financial Reform ? should be the test and war-cry in the future,
and the sooner it assumes a tangible form the better. The last
financial expedient of our Colonial Treasurer of holding Colonial
debentures in hand to the extent of a million, authorised by the House,
is only a repetition of Mr. Micawber?s plan of settling with his credi-
tors by issuing I 0 U?s, carried out on a larger scale.
If Sir Thomas MTlwraith could have played ? a free hand,?
the probability is that our Land question and financial position would
have been better ; ? but he had been blocked by men who had personal
interests to serve, and been hampered by others who did not understand
the first principles of finance.

J. BAILEY BROWN,


in a position to oiler, there should not be any di ficulty in attracting
the necessary capital from outsiders. This was the opinion of the
late Mr. William Westgarth. The sale of land in any quantity as a
source of revenue will puzzle cleverer men than Mr. Tozer; and the
difficulty of getting it settled by the right sort of people is a question
involving outlay, and where or how the fund for this purpose can be
raised is a ? hickory nut ? which will puzzle even Sir Thomas
M?ll wraith to crack. The land policy of our different Governments is
a disgrace to our public men. The prospects of the present genera-
tion have been sacrificed for the benefit of posterity, which is sugges-
tive of the memorable question of Sir Boyle Roach in the Irish Par-
liament, ? What has posterity done for us ? ? A large quantity of
the best laud in the colony has been locked up for a whole generation
on long leases to squatters, and to satisfy Mr. Dutton?s Georgian craze,
backed up by Sir S. W. Griffith embodied in the Land Act of 1884,
which is a ? conundrum ? ?hard to understand.
The immediate object of this pamphlet is to place before the
public the financial position of the colony in a clear and intelligible
form, with a practical suggestion or two on the revenue question, first
stating that the makeshift proposals proposed to meet the anticipated
deficit of the current year appear inadequate, and additional taxation
will be requisite sooner or later.
The first one which presents itself is an Income Tax. The prin-
cipal objection of the Government to tackle this question, which has
been advocated by several members of the House, is its inquisitorial
nature, and tendency to demoralise the proposed taxpayer; but if a
similar tax which is free from these objections can be substituted
there does not appear any reason why it should not be adopted.
It is simply a tax on expenditure instead of income. This could be
so easily ascertained that there would not be the same temptation or
facility for evading it, as will be evident on a little consideration. It
should be a graduated tax commencing at say �l5O or �2OO a-year,
from a rate of 1 % or 2 % to be increased gradually to a maximum of
say ??per cent. A tax like this ought to bring in a large amount,
and be easily and cheaply collected, and is at least worthy of careful
consideration, if not of early adoption. Also a small tax on the value
of land on the principle authorised by the late Valuation Act.
