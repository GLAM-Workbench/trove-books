PATENT FIXING-BRICKS,
WITH WOOD KEYS-
This invention, so perfectly simple and practical, affords the best and
most secure means of fixing- every description of Joiners? Work, Iron
Work, or Fittings that can require to be firmly attached to stone or
brick-work.
A First-class Certificate was awarded for the invention, by the
Commissioners of the Victorian Exhibition of 1861. It is now adopted
in all Government buildings in the Colony, and by the leading private
Architects in Melbourne : and is pronounced by all Professional men,
practical Builders, and experienced workmen who have examined into
its merits, as a great improvement, every way, upon the old and
unsatisfactory systems of fixing. It is strongly recommended on the
score of economy, as well as for stability, security, and good work?
the use of grounds being entirely superseded for skirtings, and generally
for architraves. Less labor is required in fixing, and the making good
of damages and breaches consequent upon the plugging system avoided.
Nos. 1 and 2, with flush keys, are used for Jamb-
linings, Window-linings, Door Frames, Anglo
Staffs, and all vertical work.
Nos. 5 and 6, with projecting keys, are used for
Skirtings and other horizontal work?also for
Bracketing of large Cornices.
Nos. 1 and
also afford a secure fixing fbr
Verandah roofs, without danger to the wall, as
with bond timber.

IMPROVED
ANTI-CORROSION PAINT,
FOR
PAINTING AND PRESERVING ALL KINDS OF
EXTERNAL WOOD, IRON, PLASTER,
STUCCO, AND BRICK-WORK
The superiority of the above article over every other description
of Paint, for the preservation of Outbuildings, &c., has been
evinced by the extraordinarily increased demand which the
Manufacturers have of late had for it. Two coats of the Anti-
Corrosion will render Wood or Iron Work, however exposed,
impervious to the weather. It is an effectual remedy for pre-
venting the leakage of Walls of a porous quality, and will be
found one of the cheapest and best preparations ever used for
Verandahs, Sashes of all kinds, Tiles to represent SI tes, and
Gutters, as it equally resists the effects of heat and moisture.
It can be confidently recommended as the best possible covering
for Stucco, Plaster, and Brick-work; Gates, Iron Palisading
and Hurdles; Wood Fences, Carts, and other Agricultural
implements.
It is considerably cheaper than common Paint, and will
last four times as long. The Colour most frequently used pre-
sents the appearance of fine Portland Stone ; but Lead, Slate,
Yellow, Green, Red, and other Colours may be used.

Mr. C. Mayes is prepared to take out quantities, and to compile
Estimates of every description of engineering or architectural works,
in any part of Australia, on commission or otherwise.
Mr. M. was engaged as a Contractors? Engineer by Messrs. Nowell
and Hattersley, on the Huddersfield and Manchester, and the New-
castle and Berwick Railways, and by Messrs. Tredwell and Sons, on
the Churnet Valley Branch of the N. Staffordshire Railway, from
1846 to 1850,
In 1855-56, Mr. M. was engaged by Captain Clark, R.E., under the
immediate superintendence of Mr. G. C. Darbyshire, District Surveyor,
of Williamstown, in surveying and levelling that portion of the
M., M. A. and M. R. Ry. Co.?s proposed line of Railway between
Ballan and Castlemaine.
Mr. M. subsequently took up the Government Levels near Rochester,
laid out the trial line of Railway between Rochester and Echuca, and
made a detailed survey of several miles of the River Murray, at
Echuca, for the proposed Terminus.
Mr. M. has been engaged on the Victorian Railways, and in the
Engineer-in-Chief?s office, for seven years, up to August last, as a
Railway Engineer and Architect, and has had great experience in
taking out quantities, from both finished and unfinished drawings
and specifications, and in Estimating for the Station and other
Railway works throughout the Victorian Railways.

PREFACE.
The success which has attended the publication of the first
Buildkrs? Price Book in Australia, has induced me to
publish the present work, which has been carefully revised,
enlarged, and improved, trusting that an increasing demand
for the work will meet the reduction in the price.
The following is a copy of a letter received from the
Secretary of the Victorian Builders? and Contractors?
Association, soon after the publication of the Victorian
Contractors? and Builders? Price Book :
Melbourne, 9th November, 1859,
Sir, ?At a numerously attended meeting of the Victorian Builder*?
and Contractors? Association, the merits of your Price-hook were
freely discussed, and the following resolution was passed unanimously?
? That the Secretary of this Association communicate with Mr.
Mayes respecting his Price-hook ; that they believe it to he well
adapted to the requirements of this colony, where labour varies so
much, and that they will endeavour to make it a standard work, for
the guidance of the Association.?
I am, Sir, yours truly,
GEO. CLUTTEN, Hon. Secretary.
C. Mayes, Esq., Civil Engineer and Architect.
The following is also a copy of a letter received from the
Secretary of the South Australian Association of Architects,
Engineers, and Surveyors :
Adelaide, June 22nd, 1860.
C. Mates, Esq.,
Sir, ?The following report was unanimously adopted by the
General Meeting of the Association.
Signed, W. G. Harris, Secretary.
?To the President and Members of the South Australian Association of
Architects, Engineers, and Surveyors.
? Sir and Gentlemen, ?In conformity with a resolution passed at
the last General Meeting, we have examined the details of the
? Victorian Contractors? and Builders? Price Book,? and consider the
system upon which it is based exceedingly good, and such as fits it
for adoption in this or any other Colony. We further consider that the
book exhibits throughout very much care and industrial research, and
is highly creditable to the compiler.
Signed, GEO. E. HAMILTON, C.E.
EDMUND W. WRIGHT, Architect.
E. A. HAMILTON, Architect.


The Australian Press were unanimous in their praise of
the work, which is now well known throughout the Aus-
tralian Colonies. The following is from Tasmania :
?We have received a copy of the ?Victorian Contractors? and
Builders? Price-book,? containing a universal and permanent price-list
?for labour only ,? &c., by C. Mayes, Civil Engineer and Architect.
Although compiled for the use of Victorian Builders, the greater
portion of the contents are obviously of value to the contractors of this
colony ; several builders here have purchased the booh, and speak highly of
it. The design of the work is to facilitate the preparation of esti-
mates, &c.?? Launceston Examiner.
Previous to the publication of the Victorian Con-
tractors? and Builders? Price Book, the use of Builder?s
Constants (or the time required to perform a certain quantity
of work) was but little known. Peter Nicholson has shown,
by Constants, how it is possible to value ?labour only?
at any rate of wages, and has proved this system to be the
only correct basis from which to value all kinds of
Artificer?s Work.
Gwilt, in his second edition of the ? Encyclopaedia
of Architecture,? published in 1851, under ?measuring
and estimating? (chap. 3, sec. 2347), says: ?? Mr, Peter
Nicholson, a gentleman to whom the architect as well as
the practical man are more indebted than to any other
author on this subject, is the only person who has attempted
to promulgate a system founded on the scientific basis to
which we have just alluded; and we have much pleasure in
here alluding to the value of his labours and of placing
before the reader the extent to which he carried it, regretting
much that he did not farther pursue an investigation which
we have carried to a greater extent, though not now so
complete as we could have wished.? Gwilt then gives about
eight pages octavo of items in carpentry and joinery, with
the Constants (or time required to do the work indicated by
each item) in days and decimals. Similar Constants are
given in the ? Student?s Guide to measuring Artificers?
Work, by Edward Dobson, 1852?53 and in a ? Builder?s
Price Book, by David Smith, of Belfast, Ireland.? The
whole of these works give the Constants in days and
decimals, cast out, generally, to the thousandths of a day.
The working day varies in Great Britain from 9 hours
in winter, to 10 in summer; and in Australia, since the adop-


of the 8 hours? system by some of the Trades Unions, from
8 hours to 10 hours ; the day therefore cannot be taken as a
standard because the term is ambiguous. <
In Cresy?s ? Encyclopaedia of Civil Engineering, Constants
are given in hours and decimals for French engineering
work, by French workmen, calculated to French measures
and weights; and on this account are but of little use to
British or Australian Builders. Seeing that the term day
is ambiguous, and therefore likely to lead to mistakes and
disputes, I made the hour the unit or standard in the
?Victorian C. and B. Price-Book;? there was also a
difficulty in the adoption of decimals which are not generally
understood; and even by those well acquainted with decimals
it is not so easy to multiply hours and decimals by shillings
and pence, or feet and inches, I therefore gave the Constants
in hours and 1 %ths, knowing such a division was likely to be
well understood. (See the face or dial of any British or Colo-
nial watch or clock.) _ _ ,
There is another great advantage in. this system: such
Constants represent the cost of the Item at one shilling
per hour, the hours representing shillings, and the
pence, so that anyone who can square dimensions can readily
calculate the price for ? labour only? at any rate of wages per
hour, by simply multiplying the wages per hour by the
Constant, or price given, precisely in the same manner that
they would ascertain the area of the face of a stone, piece of.
board, painting?, or glazing, &c., by multiplying the length
and breadth together in feet and 12ths, and in the generality
of cases this will be very simple, because if the wages to be
paid are 6d. per hour for the Excavator or Labourer, &c.,
you have only to take one-half; if 9d., three-fourths; if
10|d., deduct one-eighth ; if Is. l|d., add one-eighth; if
Is. 3d., add one-fourth; if Is. 4d., add one-third (&c., &c.)
to the prices given for ?Labour only.? To any one
accustomed to square dimensions, this will appear so simple
as scarcely to be worth reading; but there are, nevertheless,
both Builders and Clerks of Works, who say they do not
understand the principle upon which prices are calculated in
the ? Vic. C. &B. Price-Book.? These parties have been
so accustomed to the ordinary Price Books, that they will not
take the trouble to estimate for themselves, but would rather
jump at a price, or conclude that because some one else ha>


taken similar work at a certain price, they will not be far
wrong if they do the same ; and jet every Colonial Builder
or Contractor knows, that, (although there may be, to a
certain extent, fixed prices in London,) or any of the principal
owns of Great Britain, there are scarcely two places in
Australia where the same prices would apply, or where a
Melbourne price could be safely used in Melbourne for even
six months.
To facilitate the practice of calculating by the hour instead
n I ave g?iven Tables showing the rate per
hour for different rates per day of both 8 hours and 10 hours.
n reference to these Tables, it will be perceived that an
increase of Is. per day of 8 hours gives 1 |d., or |s. per hour;
and for a day of 10 hours, l|d. (nearly), or l-10s. per hour.
the column for ? Labour only? is headed
�lis. it is also to be understood as at Is. per hour ?
and wherever the Labourer is mentioned with the Artizan?
as ncklayer and Labourer,? &c., their joint wages is to be
understood, which, in London, is about Is. per hour for
Masters Prices the prices I have given in such cases
wi f theiefore be about the same as London prices.
? i LL Materials.? ? e ? Smiths?Work,? ? Composition En-
richments, ? Graining? and ? Writing,? are given complete
at the current rates mentioned at the end of these trades,
which are, therefore, to be used in the same way as the
prices given in the London Price Books, but as the wages
per hour is given at which they are calculated, prices at
any other rates may be calculated, although not so readily
as from the Constants. In calculating the price of ? All
.terials, where the Constants or price at Is. per hour is
given, it is absolutely necessary that you should know the
wages per hour you will have to pay, and, also, the quality
� or i d� ne ) and whether the men you employ
are ikely to be above, or below the average, or whether
eir labour is likely to be affected by bad weather; all
ese considerations, with others arising from local peculi-
anties, &c., will be taken into account by the Practical
-dudder, and, with the exception of the two first, may be
im, uded in the item of profit, which will, therefore, vary
rom 5 to 100 per cent., 5 per cent, being a better profit on
ome jobs than 100 per cent, on others.


Quality of W^ork. ?In estimating work from Speci-
fications, to arrive at correct prices, it is also necessary to
know the parties you have to deal with. Specifications
are not always written by practical men, hence you meet
with such oddities ? as the beds and joints (of bluestone-
block, in course or ashlar), to be fine axe dressed ,? when it
means that they are simply to be taken out of winding by
very rough axe-dressing, which costs about as many pence,
as the fine axing would cost shillings, per super, foot.
Many other such inconsistencies might be pointed out in
Specifications for very important works, which generally
aim at a better class of work than is intended to be paid
for ; hence, as a rule, Specifications are not strictly carried
out even in spirit, and very rarely, if ever, to the letter.
Cartage is often a very important Item in arriving at
prices for ? All Materials, ? and for this reason I have not
only given the average weight of building materials, but
also Constants for arriving at the cost per ton, &c., from the
actual cost per hour of the horse, dray, and driver. If one
driver can attend two drays (as is sometimes done in carting
bricks, &c.), only half his wages per hour must be reckoned.
If the distance is over 10 miles, the current market rates
per ton should be taken as a check or guide. If you
employ vour own teams, or pay by the day, or hour, the
quality of the horses will be an important consideration.
There is as much difference in horses as in men, and
happily the trades union doctrine, of ? all workmen being
equal,'? does not extend to horses, or their drivers either.
Sand and Water, although of little value on the spot, some-
times prove very costly when delivered on the work. I
have heard of clean creek, or sharp sand, being carted 50
miles, at a cost of �9 per ton. In such cases it might be
cheaper to wash pit sand, or even ordinary loam, if either
could be procured, with water, within a mile or two.
Materials. ?In the London Price Books a column is set
apart for ?All Materials,? but (except in the instances
before mentioned), I have kept the cost of the Materials
only? distinct from ? Labour only. This is more necessary
in Australia, where both labour and materials are liable to
greater fluctuations than elsewhere. # .
Building Stone.? Contractors are sometimes deceived in


the difference in the cost of working the same class of
stone. It is well-known that all building stones harden
for an indefinite period after quarrying. In ? Masons?
work,? in this book, the Constants are for stone that has
been quarried not more than a month. The most remark-
able case of stone-hardening I have met with, was a Bulleen
sill, or step, which, when quarried, could have been dressed
at the same price as Bath, Caen, or Bacchus Marsh stone,
but after lying in a mason s yard, in town, for three years,
it cost four times as much to work as the last named stones,
and had to be axe-dressed, being as hard as the hardest
bluestone. Although Milestone, or basalt, is found through-
out Australia, it varies considerably (in colour, grain, texture,
and size of blocks), in different quarries ; some samples will
not spall well, and cost double the usual price for hammer-
dressing, and, generally, bluestone that is not good for
Masonry, is most easily broken, and makes the best metal,
or ballast.
If a very correct estimate, or an ordinary estimate,
wherein a large quantity of one description of material is
required, the cost of such material fin the nearest market)
should be ascertained immediately previous to the estimate
being made. I need scarcely remark that the largest items
(in amount) should be most correctly ascertained, as upon
their accuracy the correctness of the estimate mainly
depends.
Estimating {in Australia, particularly ), if properly done,
is a very intricate and tedious process, and in tendering,
few will give the time required, and this is mainly the
reason why Tenders are sent in by competent Builders,
varying from 20 to 50 per cent., even when the
same bills of quantities are adopted. The recklessness
with which some Contractors tender, is likewise partly
owing to the small chance they have of getting work at a
fair price ; they generally trust to ? something turning up?
in their favour during the execution of the work to make up
for low prices.
Tendering. ?In estimating for a Tender, it depends
materially whether you pay by the day or by the piece.
Workmen will often do work from 20 to 30 per cent, cheaper
by the piece than by the day, so that if you intend to re-let


the work to the different trades you might safely take the
Constants, or the prices given at Is. per hour, even for first
class work; and for second class work, some of the trades might
be taken at 9d. or lOd. per hour for the Artizans? wages,
with the Labourers? in proportion.? See Victorian Govern-
ment Prize Essay on Manufactures, p. 9.
Rules for Measurement. ?ln Australia, where Architects
and Builders hail not only from all parts of Great Britain,
but also from America, Germany, Italy, &c., Standard
Rules for the measurement of Artificers? work would tend in
a great measure to prevent misunderstanding, disputes, and
law suits, I nave endeavoured to bring this subject before
the ? Contractors? and Builders? Association? of Melbourne,
but could not get them to meet, or otherwise take sufficient
interest in the subject. The Rules to be found in this book
are few and simple, and have been approved of by several
Builders in Melbourne as likely to be adopted. The
Victorian Railway and Public Works Departments, try by
their specifications to enforce a peculiar kind of nett
measurement, which cannot be carried out to the letter, and
it is still an open question as to the spirit or meaning to be
attached to nett measurement. In Carpentry it is nett
measurement to allow for scarfing, framing, Ac., because
the extra timber required is actually used, but unless the
Quantities-Surveyor knows what lengths of timber can be
procured, the allowance is only guesswork.
Circular work. ?The rules given in the London Price
books for estimating the cost of circular work in Carpentry
and Joinery are never adopted in Australia, for in modern
workshops machinery is so mixed with hand labour as
materially to reduce the cost of circular-work. The system
of measuring circular-work as square work, in areas gives
an addition of 211 per cent, to the nett measure (and in
solid work would give a far larger proportion), but where
is the Joiner, Glazier, or Painter, who would submit to a
deduction of 21| per cent, from the square measurement
of a circular-headed window.

Building Materials in Classes 4 and 5*
Building Stones.
Granites from Beechworth, samples of grey granite, 6 in. cubes
(good building stones). Samples 12 in. x 12 in. x 6 in of bluish
grey, apparently of Ist class quality.
Sample ft, x 2 ft. x 2 ft. cream coloured, and apparently very
durable.?lst class certificate was awarded for the above Granites.
Sandhurst , grey granite, sample about 10 in. x 7 in. x 4 in. large
grained quartz and felspar with but little mica. A good sample of
this inferior description of granite.
Mt. Alexander. ?Similar to last samples, but with a larger proportion
of black mica ; 3rd class.-
Mr. Knight?s collection of granites (3 in. cubes), from Mt. Eliza,
Mt. Martha, the Plenty Ranges, Mt. Blackwood, Refuge Cove, &c.
Generally good, some samples inferior from the presence of sulphuret
of iron, a large proportion of mica, or both these defects combined.
Sandstones. ?Twofold Bay sample, 5 in. x 6 in. x 8 in, fine grained
dark drab, with slightly mafked iron veins; 3rd class.
Castlemaine sandstone, sample 12 in. cube, highly micaceous;?also
Sandhurst sandstone of similar description, both inferior.
Flagstones. ?The best sample from Specimen Gully, Castlemaine,
was about 10 ft. x 4 ft. x 3 ins. thick, but of an inferior description.
The samples from Sandhurst, Ballaarat, &c., were likewise inferior
and too small for market flagging.
Slates. ?The best sample was from Beechworth, the samples from
Castlemaine, Sandhurst, &c., were inferior, and were probably
procured from too near the surface.

the items for cartage only will be about half those stated.
Example.? lf the charge for horse dray and driver is Is 6d per
hour, item three will be from 2s to 3s.
Cuttings and Embankments.? ln equalising the contents of
cuttings and embankments for roads, railways, &c., it is not usual
to make any allowance for the increased bulk of loose material,
except in increasing the height of the embankments for settlement,
the extent of which will depend upon the material, rock settling
down the least, and wet clay the most; but if the embankments
are comparatively free from clay they will measure at least 10 per
cent more than the cuttings they were taken from, even after
subsiding or consolidating. As a rule it is considered favourable
to the contractor to pay him for embankments, if he has taken the
work by the cubic yard.
Measurement of Earthwork.
In the measurement of cuttings and embankments with slopes
the common system of average heights gives less and the common
system of average areas gives more than the true contents ; the
proper system is by the prismoidalformula from which the annexed
table for the calculation of earthwork is calculated, but even in this
case the cross section is presumed to be perfectly level, the slopes
to be quite true, and the change from chain to chain regular and
gradual, otherwise the measurement is incorrect.
To show the necessity of correctly ascertaining the cubical
contents of earthwork where the contractor tenders for a lump
sum, I have taken the following from McNeil?s Earthwork
Tables, which are calculated from the prismoidal formula ; ?
? In calculating the contents of embankments and cuttings in a
section, the true content of which is 332,390 cu. yds., by the
common method of mean heights is only 310,652 cu. yds., thus
making 21,738 cu. yds. less than the true content; by the com-
mon method of mean areas the error in excess will be 43,487 cubic
yards.?


Prismoidal Formula. ?Average area equal to 4 times the mid-
dle area added to the sum of the end areas and divided by 6. By
using the following constants instead of dividing the sum of the
areas by 6, multiply them by the constant required for the length
in chains.
Sum of areas in feet multiplied by 0-2037=cu. yds. in 1 chain.
Ditto 0 - 4074=cu. yds. in 1 chain.
Ditto 0.6111= do. in do.
Ditto 0 - 8148= do. in 2 chains.
Ditto 1-2222= do. in 3 do.
Ditto l - 6296= do, in 4 do.
Ditto 2 0370= do. in 5 do.
Ditto 2-4444= do. in 6 do.
Cross Sections of cuttings and embankments, and all irregu-
lar sided figures may be reduced to one triangle by the 34th Prop,
of the first book of Euclid, which can be practically carried out
with a parallel ruler in about one-fourth the usual time occupied
by the common method.

Cost equal to wages of borer and labourer per hour, jj rg & 12 tiis

Add from 25 to 50 per cent, to the above, if through hard gravel
or soft rock.
Ditto 100 per cent, if through compact sandstone or hard shale.
Reckon 3 to 4 times the amount if through basalt or bluestone,
and 5 or 6 times if through granite.
The above prices down to 200 feet are for a bore-hole not ex-
ceeding 4 inches, to be made truly vertical by using boring rods
1 inch square, so that pipes may be inserted if required. If pipes
are used they should be of wrought iron, except for very deep
holes, when cast iron pipes are required, being thicker and more
easily driven.

From 40 to 70 feet deep add one-half to Ist 4 items.
From 70 to 100 feet deep add three-fourths to ditto.
N.B. ?In the third and fourth items take the least time for the
largest, and the greatest time for the smallest wells, on account of
the difficulty of working and blasting rock in confined areas, for
the same reason steel gads are often used in both sinking and
driving.
Dry Steining.?lf steining is required, reckon for every 100
bricks laid dry, from Oh. lOtw. to ih. Otw. (according to depth)
multiplied by wages of bricklayer and labourer per hour. If
rings of brickwork set in cement are required in lieu of wooden
or iron curbs, reckon such portions at the rate of brick in
cement in tanks qs hereafter stated.
Cost oe Tanks. ?ln estimating from the foregoing table the
cost of lining tanks with brickwork, reckon bricklayer and
labourer hour, also J bushel lime and 1 bushel of sand for
each 100 bricks required. If brick in cement reckon bricklayer
and labourer 1J hour, also f bushel of cement and f bushel of
sand per 100 bricks required, as given in Table.

In measuring four-sided square heaps of bluestone or other
metal with slopes of 1 to 1 the common method is erroneous, but
only to the extent of l-3rd of a cubic yard less than the true con-
tent in a heap 3 feet high, irrespective of the area covered by
the heap, the error affecting the corners only.

Example.?lf the Labourer or Navvy is paid 9d. per hour, the
cost of puddle should be 6h. Otw. x os. 9d. = 4s. 6d., to which must
be added profit from 10 to 20 percent. ? , , . ,
Clay puddle, when properly prepared, should be similar to Dncic
earth ready for moulding, when at least 7 hours should be
reckoned, but the above calculation is more in accordance with the
general practice of puddling in large or small works, and is there-
fore not waterproof unless laid at least one foot thick.
The use of concrete or heton (concrete made with cement in-
stead of lime) would form an excellent substitute for thin layers
of puddle.

from the above Table


One rod of Brickwork contains
272 feet super, of 1| brick or 13j inches in thickness.
Or 11J cubic yards or 306 cubic feet.
Bricks ?4,356 best bricks in mortar laid four courses to the foot.
Or 4,536 ditto ditto laid four courses to 11| inches.
Or 5,004 ditto laid dry, bricks 8f x 4| x 2|.
In house building reckon 4,300 or 4,500, the extra number given
are saved in flues and wall plates, &c.
Mortar?36 bush, of sharp sand and 36 bush, of cement or lime.
Or 2 loads of sharp sand and 7J barrels Roman cement.
Or 48 bushels of sharp sand and 6 barrels Portland cement.
Bond? 7l lbs. iron hoop No. 16, at 272 lineal feet per rod.
Brickwork when built contains about as many cubic feet of
cement or roche lime mortar as it took bushels of sand and
cement or roche lime to make the mortar used.
Weight.? The bricks made near Melbourne weigh from 6� to
7 lbs. each, or at least 3 tons per 1,000, say 13*- tons per rod, the
mortar weighing about 3 tons at 24 cubic feet per ton. The rod
of brickwork may therefore be considered to weigh from 16 to
17 tons ; or about 30 cwt. per cubic yard.

The Strongest Brickwork ia made with Patent Pressed
bricks and pure cement, each brick being pressed down to produce
as thin joints as possible, in the same manner that two pieces of
wood are glued together; such work is also practically waterproof,
and is, therefore, best adapted for tanks, cisterns, &c.

Patent Fixing Bricks. ?These bricks are made with a dove-
tail groove, into which is inserted a dove-tailed fillet or key, and
are intended as a substitute for wood-bricks, plugs, and grounds
for which they are admirably adapted, and are likely to come into
general use when their advantages are more generally known.
Messrs. Anderson, Sharp, and Wright, Carron Timber Yard,
Melbourne, are the Agents for the Patentee.


In Measuring Brickwork all flues are to be measured as solid
work below the roof, but above the roof (for ? labour only?) the
girt is taken by the thickness of brickwork round flue, and this
multiplied by the height, including projections which are girted.
Piers, pilasters, quoins, &c., are also girted, for ?labour only,? and
the spaces occupied by timbers built in are not deducted from
quantity of brickwork.
The shortest method of reducing cubic feet to the standard
thickness of 1-t brick, is to deduct one-ninth, or multiply by 8 and
divide by 9.
To reduce 1 brick to brick walls, deduct one-third from the
given area.
In measuring height of walls, the wall-plate is included for
setting or allowed for separately.
Doorways and other openings are to be deducted.
?Labour only? is understood to include the erection of necessary
scaffolding, centering, &c., but not providing it.
? Lime (or cement) and mortar? includes scaffolding, centering,
moulds, templates, and all materials except bricks.
? All materials? includes ? lime and mortar? and bricks, and in
this case the best method is to take the work at nett measurement
per cubic yard, and allow for circular work, projections, &c., in
the price.
Brick walls should be classified together according to their
thickness to admit of a more equitable estimate being made than
by the common method.
Although brickwork is generally let by the rod of 306 cubic
feet, it will be found more convenient to use the cubic yard,
or what would be better still, the super, yard, according to thick-
ness of wall, arch, abutment, culvert, &c., the measurement and
price being more easily ascertained by this than by any other
method.

Hollow Brickwork.? Walls are sometimes built hollow with
ordinary bricks, and a considerable saving of material may in
this way be effected in the construction of 9, 11, 12, and 14 inch
walls, but there is no saving in the amount of labour.
Hollow Bricks are imported, and have been made by machinery
in the colony; They are dearer than ordinary solid bricks, but may
be used to great advantage in the construction of roofs, floors,
walls over girders, and in any other situation where lightness of
construction is required . ? See Weale?s ? Rudimentary Treatise on

Sawing by Machinery on a large scale would not cost more

mand for sawn stone in Melbourne sawing by manual labour has
been proved to be the cheapest.
Polishing Marble by machinery has also been tried in Mel-
bourne, but has likewise failed from the very limited demand.
Polished marble slabs are imported in great variety, and sold in
Melbourne at a cheap rate. See p. 30.
The Adelaide marble is coarse, and not fit for polishing.
Machine Dressed Building Stone for Ashlar. ?At the last
Victorian Exhibition, samples of bluestone and freestone were
exhibited, dressed by machinery, similar to the ordinary axe
dressed stone ; the grooves or strokes made by the cutters were
slightly curved, instead of the straight hand-made strokes, but this
difference does not materially affect the appearance of the work ;
the merely nominal cost in dressing large quantities of stone would
be of great advantage in large works, and this Machine, lately
exhibited in Melbourne, will probably not be inferior in importance
to Appleton?s stone breaking machine, which is coming into general
use throughout Australia.

For every 10 feet in height above 40 feet add one-third
the above rates.
All Soft Stones, as Barley, Barrabool Hills, and Bacchus
Marsh stone, or imported Bath stone, are worth about 50 per cent,
more than the above, on account of their liability to break, chip,
or get otherwise damaged in hoisting and setting.
N.B.?The above rates are given to meet the cost of small quan-
tities of work ; but under favourable circumstances, as in a large
building, with a gantry and proper travelling crane, the cost would
probably not exceed one-half.
Extra Large Stones.?lf the stones for cornice exceed 20
cubic feet each, add one-fifth extra to the dressing, on account of
the difficulty in handling or turning the stone while being worked;
but if most of the stones in the building, viaduct, &c., are of a
large size, and the tackle is sufficient to move them easily, it will
be found cheaper to dress, hoist, and set large than small stones,
because the beds and joints, and the time required for hoisting and
setting, are less in proportion to the cubic contents of the former
as compared with the latter.


In Estimating the cost of Cubed Stone or Ashlar at per cubic
foot first consider the average size of the stones required and the
cost of such stones at the quarry, with the cartage per cube foot,
from the quarry to the work. Take next the number of super-
ficial feet of face-work in one stone, then the number of feet,
super., of dressed beds and joints to the same stone, and value the
same from the time required to do such work, multiplied by. the
wages of the Stonemason, add the time required to set the stone,
multiplied by the wages of Mason and Labourer per hour, and you
cannot fail to arrive at a correct estimate of the net cost of any
description of cubed stone or ashlar, to which add profit according
to the total cost of the work and the time required to finish it.
The different portions of masonry should also be classed as
follows, if estimating at per cubic foot :
One-face work, as ashlaring, or common face work, base courses,
plinths, friezes, &c.
Two-face work, as quoins, imposts, architraves, parapets, &c.
Three-face work, as copings, strings, cornices, pilasters, &c.
Four or more face work, as newels and caps to ditto, blocks to
cornices, chimney caps, &c. By such means this defective system
may be pruned of much of its uncertainty; the proper, because
the most correct, method being to estimate the rough stone at per
cubic foot, and the labour in dressing at per foot super.
In measuring work an allowance for waste, of one-sixth for all
bevelled stones in square and skew arches, and one-tenth in com-
mon squared stone, must be made in reckoning the cost of stone at
quarry and cartage to work.
Tooled margins, if round rock, or quarry face, which is not
measured, to be taken by the foot super,, at double their width.
Raised work to be measured as flat work, the margins being
taken as sunk work.
Proportionate cost of sunk and circular work.

Victorian Building Stones.
The only really durable building stones of Victoria are the
bluestone (basalt) and granite. The first of these is objectionable,
not only on account of its colour, but also on account of the great
cost of dressing or working. Our granite, although not objection-
able in appearance when dressed, cost in dressing from to 3 times
as much as bluestone; or from 3 to 6 times as much as Point
Ventenet (Tasmanian) sandstone ; or from 6 to 12 times as
much as Bacchus Marsh, Barley, Barrabool Hills, Castlemaine,
Kyneton and Sandhurst freestones, all of which cost about the
same to work as (English) Bath and (French) Caen stone, but
are inferior in durability to even the two last, and these, again,
are the least durable of the best English building stones.
The Government of Victoria, in 1855, offered a premium of
�l,OOO for the discovery in Victoria of a first-class building stone,
and although several samples of freestones (both siliceous and cal-
careous) were offered, nothing better than Bacchus Marsh and
Barley (siliceous) freestones have been discovered in Victoria.
We might reasonably regret that some of the principal public
buildings of Melbourne (the Treasury, Houses of Parliament, &c.)
are built of Bacchus Marsh and Barley stone, and that we
possessed no better stone for our future buildings, were it not
for ' the fact that these and the many other fine buildings of
Victoria may at any time be rendered as durable as though
they were built of Carrara marble by the simple application of?
?Ransome?s Patent Solutions for preserving stone , bricks,
cement, stucco, Sfc., by which the softest and most friable stone,
&c., can be rendered impervious and imperishable ,? at the almost
nominal cost (for the solution) of 3d. per superficial yard, which
is less than the cost of common paint, to which it is infinitely
superior, inasmuch as it has to be applied to the stone, &c., ? once
and for ever," whereas common paint requires to be renewed almost
annually, and is no better than the French silicates.
For further information on this very important invention I beg
to refer to the Patentee?s advertisement, among the English adver-
tisements in this work, and also to the ? Engineer's Pocket Books
for 1858 and 1859.?

SAWING.
In estimating the cost per lineal foot of deal scantlings sawn to order
from the foregoing tables, add |d. per super, foot for machine, and Id. for
hand or pit sawing.
In Machine Sawing, the measurement is the nett area of each saw cut
only, except the baulk is adzed or rough sided, when an additional cut is
charged for the waste or outside cut; but in Hand or Pit Sawing the
measurement is reckoned by the 100 feet super., 1 inch thick, thus: a
scantling 9x3, machine sawn from a baulk, would be reckoned as one
foot super, per foot run, but in hand or pit sawing it would be 9x3 =
27 ins. = 21 super, feet.
. For the price of machine sawing, per 100 feet super., see page 35.
Hardwood is worth one-fourth more than deal for sawing.

The first series of experiments were made at the Sydney Mint
by the Commissioner of Railways in August, 1858.
The second series of experiments are taken from ? Barlow on
the Strength of Timber and Iron,? and show the mean of three
experiments on each description of timber, the samples being
selected from Woolwich Dockyards.
The following Table is calculated from formulae given by
Barlow, viz. W = in which W represents the breaking
weight in lbs, of a piece of timber, A being its breadth, D its
depth, L its length or bearing, and S the tabular strength of each
square inch in sectional area ; the value of S for different kinds
of timber is given in the above table, where we find red pine to
be 1,341. The result of the above formulae may also be stated in
cwts,, thus W = HSB ~ = 4 A D2 and lastly J = AD2 the
result given in the following table, from which may be ascertained
the strength of any scantling, of timber, by multiplying the
result, given in the following table, by the proportions stated in
the fourth column of the above table, which I have cast out for this
purpose.
Example? One-fourth of the breaking weight of a piece of red
pine 14 inches deep by 12 inches in width, with a clear bearing of
20 feet, is shown by the following table to be 117.6 cwt,, this
multiplied by 1.36 will be 159.9 cwt., equal to one-fourth of the
breaking weight of striugy-bark, the weight being applied in the
centre of a beam or �? of the breaking weight if distributed
the beam, as in a girder for a floor, shop-window, &c.

Example.
Required the strength of a piece of timber 20 feet clear bearing, and 14
Inches deep by 12 inches wide.
Opposite the scantling 14 by 12 will he found 2352-0 cwt. Divide this
by 20 feet and the result will be 117 - 6 cwt.
The comparative strength of various scantlings may also be seen at a glance.
Also the comparative strength of a piece of timber laid flatwise, and
another of the same dimensions on edge.
The above Table is founded on experiments made by Barlow, author of the
celebrated work on the ? Strength of Timber and Iron.?

Strength of Timber. ? On page 45 I have given the result of
the only reliable experiments hitherto tried upon the strength
and elasticity of some of the Australian hardwoods, the
pieces tried were well seasoned picked specimens, 1? inches
square, supported at each end with a clear bearing of 4 feet, the
weight being applied in the centre, and with the following
results : . ~

The above experiments were made with the view of comparing
the results obtained by Professor Barlow, at Woolwich Dock-
yards, as given on page 45, and were similarly conducted in
every essential particular. , .
N B j n using the table showing the strength of Baltic red pint,
the ieiigth of the bearers should not exceed 24 times their depth.
In choosing trees for sawn timber, posts, slabs, &c., avoid those
with dead branches, which are often an indication of decay when
the tree otherwise appears sound ; small or young trees are also
to be avoided (see sawn sided sleepers, p. 50). The best wood is
always found in full-grown trees, upon dry soils or slopes
In Splitting Iron Bark the slabs, posts, &c., are split parallel
with the rings, and generally thin out towards the top, but m
Stringy Bark the slabs are generally split in radiating linos irom
the centre outwards, and in this manner have been split feet
wide by 5 feet long.

Railway Sleepers.
The best sleepers are those made from seasoned blue or red
gum, iron bark, black wood or box. The trees should be barked
and allowed to die before they are felled, by which means they
become partly seasoned ; the season for falling Australian timber
is from March to September, when the sap falls ; it should then
be split or sawn and stacked in the shade in such a manner that it
may be well ventilated ; but with every precaution, the ends will
open more or less ; this may be partly staid by bolting them,
which process is now generally resorted to. It would be worse
than useless to tar unseasoned timber which would only hasten its
decay by preventing the sap evaporating ; the cost of unseasoned
sleepers may be obtained from the following constants :
Cost of Sleepers.
Not less than 9 ft. x 10 in. x 5 in. each
Labour only, equal to constant, multiplied by average s. &d.
wages per hour of men employed. hour.
1 9
Example. ?lf the average wages paid to woodmen, bullock team
and driver, and sawyers, is equal to Is. 2d. per hour; then the nett
cost at the pit will be ls#2d. x Is 9d = 2s. o|d., to which must be
added cartage from pit, restacking, and profit upon the whole.
The cartage generally adds considerably to the price, the sleepers
weighing from 2| to 3 cwt. each.
Sawn Sided are far superior to the half round sleepers, because
very young timber is always inferior to that which has arrived
at maturity, and always contains a large proportion of heart and
white or outside, which is never sound; and although sufficient of
the white is adzed away to bed the chair, the remainder soon
rots, thereby destroying the sleeper and loosening the ballast
surrounding it.
Bolting (or riveting) Sleepers.
Per sleeper.
Labour only, equal to wages of Borer or Riveter per g&d at

superficial inches in sectional area.
In all superficial work such as floors, ceilings, partitions, walls,
&c., for ? Labour and Nails,? or ? Labour only,? take the full
dimensions, including well-holes, chimney breasts, doorways,
windows, &c., which are not to be] deducted, except the opening
exceeds 36 superficial feet, when one-half the area only is allowed,
but if the price for nett measurement is required, then the per
centage of the areas deducted, to the whole work, must be added to
the price.
King and queen posts should be taken full size without deduc-
tion for waist in cubing.

Rules for Measurement.
Circular work of every description in Joinery to be charged as
follows, viz, ;
. Mat sweep, not more than | inch rise per foot, or curves of
circles not less than 3 feet diameter, once and half the price of
straight work.
Quick sweep, or more than � inch rise per 12 inch chord, twice
the price of similar straight work.
Elliptical, the same, according to sharpness of the curves.
The above proportions apply to the shape on the plan, or to the
elevation only. If they occur on both plan and elevation as cir-
cular circular, they must be reckoned twice or three times the
price of circular on plan only, e. g, if flat sweep on both plan and
elevation, the proportion would be 1J x 2 = 3 times the price of
straight work. If quick sweep on both plan and elevation the
proportion would be 2 x 3 = 6 times the price of similar straight
work. If flat sweep on plan, and quick in elevation, 41 times. If
quick sweep on plan, and flat in elevation, 4 times.
Circular sashes, frames, shutters, &c., to be measured square
and circular heads to doors, &c., to be measured square above
the springing, which gives an addition of 21J per cent, on the nett
measurement, exclusive of the extra charge determined by the
previous Rules.
Ch cular, plain glued in thicknesses , for all degrees of curvature
take twice the price of similar straight solid work ; and if circular
circular, from 3 to 4 times, according to sharpness of curves.
Cornices. In measuring cornices the mouldings do not include
the splay or weathering, which is to be taken as boarding
wrought, &c., as the case may be.
The Cost of Labour for Joinery or Cabinet work on the Aus-
tralian woods, Cedar, Huon Pine, &c., is about the same as
Mahogany, or double the cost of similar labour to deal; but the
labour to Red Gum, Blackwood, and knotty Huon Pine costs about
the same as the labour to Rosewood, or 2i times the cost of similar
work to deal.
In Carpentry, where the surfaces are not wrought, the extra
labour required in hardwood seldom exceeds 25 per cent, more
than the labour on similar deal scantlings.

Seyssel asphalte is made from a natural calcareous bitumen,
found at Seyssel, near Pyrimont, department of I?Aix ; and ac-
cording to Claridge?s specification of his Patent, obtained in Nov.
1837, ? contains 90 parts of carbonate of lime to about 10 parts of
bitumen this is improved by the addition of tar or pitch by the
Patentee. The calcareous asphalte rock of Val de Travers, in
the Canton of Neufchatel, in Normandy, contains 20 per cent! of
bitumen. Bitumen, naturally combined with calcareous earth,
forms a compact slightly elastic substance which is as durable as
granite, but no artificial mixture of coal tar and calcareous earth
carbonate of lime, or chalk, has ever been produced at all ap-
proaching the natural asphaltes in durability. This is partly due to
the difficulty of imitating the natural combination in mixing, but
chiefly to the fact of the natural bitumen, being a kind of mineral
tar, which will sustain 170� of heat without injury, whereas
asphalte made from coal (vegetable.) tar, becomes soft at 1150 0 f
heat, and is, therefore, clearly not suitable to the climate of Vic-
toria, where the Colonial asphalte, as it is called, always becomes
softened by the heat of summer, and is easily spread and broken
up. See article Bitumen in the supplement to ?Dr. lire?s
Dictionary.?
In the Great Exhibition of all Nations, held in London,
in 1851, the ?Limmer Asphalte Stone? (from the dis-
trict of Yelber, near Hanover, in Germany) obtained the
Prize medal, although opposed by the Seyssel and Val de
Travers asphaltes.

In Measuring Plastering, a variety of opinions exist, all of
them tending more or less to misunderstanding, and consequent
litigation. The least objectionable method is to take the net
measurement at a price calculated to meet the cost of work under
consideration, including all extras; and this is the system recom-
mended by the Melbourne Association of Plasterers.

CARVING AND CASTING.
Stone Carving, which is generally fixed at a considerable
height above the observer, does not require that degree of finish
or delicacy of outline required in wood carving, which is generally
fixed much nearer to the eye. In all ornamental work the time
required to model or carve a given Piece depends materially upon
the degree of finish, or minutiae , aimed at. In both stone and wood
carving I have reduced the time, or constants, for arriving at an
estimate, because the system of tendering now generally adopted
Will not admit of a superior class of work at current rates of
wages.
Exampt.es of Estimating. ?Required, the cost of a Corinthian
capital for a nine inch column in Point Yenteriet Stone ; Carvers?
and Stone Cutters?s wages, each at Is. 6d. per hour
Material, cubic feet at 3s. 6d. (as per page 20), .�0 5 3

To which must be added profit as required.
It will be seen by the above Example that the whole of the
minor expenses do not exceed 8 per cent., therefore, as a rule, it
would be sufficiently near to add 8 per cent, to the profit required
on the cost of carving.
Wood Carving. ?Required the cost of a similar capital in
cedar. Turners? and Carvers? wages, each Is. 4d. per hour

% �4 8 8
To which must be added the cost of fixing, and profit upon the
whole.
Plaster Castings.? The cost of a similar capital in plaster of
Paris, or Keene?s marble cement, would be about �4,
Composition Castings. ?The cost of a similar capital in com-
position (cast in carved wooden moulds), would be 705,, com
plete as per page 81.
Colour. ?The lighter the colour of the ornament, or enrich-
ment, the more readily is any defect observed. For this reason
a Corinthian capital which might be passable if carved in cedar
or blackwood, would look coarser in Huon or Clear Pine, and
would be scarcely, if at all, passable in Plaster of Paris, or equally
white composition.

Sashes and Frames should be measured as plain surfaces, in-
cluding the glass and the exposed part of frames, with linings,
&c., which should be girted ; but if the squares exceed 3 super.
feet, then it is better to take the sash bars by the lineal yard.
In Measuring Painting, allow for all edges, sinkings,- or girths.
In iron railing, and other open work, it is usual to take the two
sides as flat work, and ornamental or small works twice for each
Anti-Corrosion Paint, Ridley?s {improved), for painting and
preserving all kinds of materials to which common paint is applied,
for which it is a cheap and superior substitute. Messrs. Sprigg,
Addison, and Co., are the agents for Victoria. See Advertisement

The above sheets are generally 7 ft. x 3 ft. If laid plain, with
3 inch side laps and inch end laps, add one-sixth to the above
weight per square.
If Corrugated and laid, add one-fourth to the area, which will
allow for corrugations and laps ; one corrugation for side, and 4|
inches for end laps.
For Roofing, No. 13, 14, and 15 are the best gauges ; any gauge
less than No. 13 would he too slight for permanent roofs.
Temporary Erections. ?Zinc is the cheapest metal for roofs,
&c., because the manufacturers allow one half the price for old
zinc, ?See pamphlet of Vielle Montague Co.

Mem.? -If sheet or plumbic zinc contains any iron in its com-
position, it will not resist the action of the air, and is no better than
damaged or inferior galvanized iron.
It is also essential that it should be perfectly malleable, or it will
crack with too sudden changes of temperature; care must also be
taken to allow for contraction and expansion, which may he
effectually guarded against, if properly laid. The best test of its
malleability, is to double the corners backwards and forwards,
which ought not to crack it.
Good Plumbic Zinc forms an excellent cheap substitute for lead
or copper in the lining of tanks, cisterns, urinals, gutters, or for
covering ridges, hips, flats, &c., but costs about double for laying
at per cwt., or about one-half at per square.
Price of Zinc ?On account of the extra labour in rolling thin
sheets, there is a difference of about �4 per ton in the wholesale
price of No. 18 and No, 9 gauges.
There are two kinds of zinc imported here, viz., the Yielle
Montagne Co.?s and the London-made zinc, the first always of
the best description, and can he depended upon; but the latter
is not only inferior in ductility and durability to the first, but the
gauge is, also, sometimes wrongly stamped, and the same sheet
will vary occasionally in thickness.
Zinc Gutters Pipes &c., No. 9 gauge per lin.foot, are about the
same price as those of the best galvanized iron, No. 26 gauge,
as given in page 93.
The Labour to Zinc and galvanized iron are about the same.
See Labour to galvanized iron, page 105.

Girders, with the addition of the cost of caulking, which is about
equal to riveting The sides of the plates should not butt as in
girders, but should lap, and be double riveted, by which means
much labour is saved, and the joints effectually caulked ; this is
almost impossible when tbe plates butt, even if the edges are shot
or planed.

Wrought iron is now extensively used in the construction of
girders and breastsummers, to support walls over shop fronts,
heavily loaded floors of mills, stores, &c., and is superseding
wooden and cast iron girders. Cast iron is liable to crack from
sudden shocks, or from the sudden application of cold water while
in a heated state, and in case of fire is little better than wood.
The following table for wrought iron girders is for such spans
as are most in use without the intervention of columns. To
support walls and heavy machinery, the box girder will be found
the best, but for loaded floors, the plate girder offers many advan-
tages ; ?

top and bottom plates 4 inch, the thickness of the vertical plates
for the 10 feet girders � inch, and the 15 and 20 feet girders,

In plate iron girders, not only the sectional areas must be cor-
rect, but also the perfect arrangement of the joints must be
attended to.
All joints should butt close together, covered with proper
jointing strips, and no two joints should occur in the same place.
In punching tire plates and angle irons, the sectional areas should
be diminished only to the extent necessary for rivets of the proper
size; and plates, &c., imperfectly punched/' should be rejected.
The rivets should be of Lowmoor

Schedule B. ?Part 1.
Rules for determining the classes and rates to which buildings are
to he deemed to belong.
Classes of Buildings. ?For the purposes of this Act , all buildings
are to he deemed to belong to one of the following three classes, viz.:
First Class. ?lf a building be built originally as a dwelling-
house, or for an office, or suites or sets of chambers or offices, or
be occupied, or intended to be occupied as such, then it is to be
deemed to belong to the first or dwelling-house class.
Second Class.?lf a building be built originally as a warehouse,
store-house, granary, brewery, distillery, manufactory, work-shop,
or public stable, or be occupied, or intended to be occupied as
such, or for a similar purpose, then it is to be deemed to belong to
the second or warehouse class.
Third Class.? lf a building be built originally as a church, or
other place of public worship, college, hall, hospital, theatre, or
other place of public amusement, or for the assemblage of persons
in large numbers, whether for public worship, business, instruction,
debate, diversion, or resort, then it is to be deemed to belong to
the third or public building class.
Alteration of Class. And if any room be used at any time for
the public or general congregation of persons, then the building
containing such rooms is to be deemed a building of the third or
public building class.
Or if a building originally built, or subsequently altered, so as
to bring it within any one class, be subsequently converted into,
or used, as a building of another class, then it is to be deemed to
belong to such other class ; or if a building be used partly as a
dwe'ling-house and partly for any purpose which would bring it
within the second or warehouse class, then it is to be deemed to
belong to the said second or warehouse class.
The height of every building is t* be ascertained by measuring
from the surface of the lowest floor of the building up to the top
of the wall plate for receiving the roof.
And the area of every building is to be determined by the
number of squares contained in the surface of any floor, which
shall contain the greatest number of squares, at or above the
principal entrance to such building, including in such surface the
area of all the external walls, and such portions of the party-
walls as belong to such building, but excluding from such surface
the area of any attached building or office, area, balcony, or open
portico.
And the capacity or cubical contents of any building of the second
class is to be ascertained by measuring within the walls at the
surface of the floor, at the principal entrance to such building,
and from the surface of the lowest floor to the top of the wall
plate for receiving the roof.
Number of Stories. ?If the space in height between the top of
the footings and the level of the lowest floor exceed five feet, then
such space is to be considered to contain the lowest or first story,
and in that case the top of the footing is to be considered the level
of the lowest floor.

greater thickness,
Schedule C.?Part 2.
Construction of external walls.
Every external wall must be built of bricks or stone, or of bricks
and stone together, laid in mortar or cement in such manner as to
produce solid work, and must hold its full thickness through on.
Recesses may be formed, so that the back thereof be of the thick-

least, except ceiling joists which may go through the wall, provided
a sufficient corbel be formed at the line of the party and external
walls. And the frames of doors and windows must be fixed
in reveals, at a distance from the external face of the wall of four
inches, at the least. And the tiers of door-cases to warehouses
must be fixed in the opening left in such walls, at a distance from
the external face of the wall of two inches, at the least. But no
timber must be laid into any external wall in such manner as to
render the part of the wall above it, wholely, or in great part,
dependent upon the wood for support, or so that any such wood
might not be withdrawn without endangering the safety of the
superincumbent structure, except in the case of breastsummers ;
and with regard to the external walls of buildings of the second
or warehouse class, which may be built of iron standards and
plates, and securely covered with sheet iron or zinc, such external
walls may be built abutting on to other external or party walls of
brick or stone, but must not be built within ten feet of any wooden
building.
Height and thickness of parapets. ?If an external wall adjoin a
gutter, then such external wall must be carried up, and remain
one foot, at the least, above the highest {Tart of such gutter. And
the thickness of such parapet must be, at the least, in every wall
of the first rate of the first and second class, thirteen inches thick;
and in every other external wall eight and a half inches thick.
Breastsummers. ?lf a breastsummer have a bearing at one end
upon a party wall, then it must be laid upon a template or corbel
of stone, or wood, or iron, which template or corbel must be
tailed through such wall, at least two-thirds of the thickness
thereof; and the end of such breastsummer must not be fixed into,
and must not have its bearing solely upon such party-wall, but
must be supported by a sufficient pier, built of brick or stone, or
by an iron column, or iron or timber story posts, fixed on a solid
foundation. And if any such breastsummer have its bearing at
each end upon a party-wall, then it must be supported by, at
least, two sufficient piers built of brick or stone, or by iron
columns, or by iron or timber story posts, fixed on solid founda-
tions, and standing within, and clear of, the party-walls. Or any
such breastsummer may bear upon constructed returns, in the
direction of the length of the breastsummer, of four inches, at the
least, coursed and bonded with the substance of the party or
external walls; and such constructed returns must be increased
one inch, at the least, for every six feet in length that the breast-
summer may be otherwise unsupported; and the ends of every
such breastsummer must not be fixed at a less distance than four
a half inches from the centre line of the party-wall, nor less than
nine inches from the face of an external wall. And if the height


ot the underside of any breastsummer, laid from party-wall to
party-wall, to carry any external wall, exceed fifteen feet from
the surface of the public foot-pavement in front of the building,
then there must he constructed returns in the direction of the
length of the breastsummer, from the inside of each party-wall, of
eight and a half inches, at the least, and, at the least, of the full
thickness of such breastsummer ; and every such return must be
increased one inch, at the least, for every foot, or part of a foot,
the breastsummer may be in height from the surface of the public
foot pavement, more than sixteen feet, whether the breastsummer
be otherwise supported or not.
Materials to he used in repairs.? lt any wall or enclosure be not
built of the materials required by this Act for external walls, or
other external enclosures, then every part of such wall, or other
external enclosures (except the enclosure of roofs, and the flats,
gutters, dormers, turrets, lantern-lights, and other erections
thereon), may be at all times thereafter repaired, with materials
of the same sort as those of which such external wall or enclosure
has been already built.
Materials to be used in re-huilding. ?But if any such external
wall or enclosure be at any time hereafter taken down or otherwise
demolished for the height of one story, or for a space equal to
one-fourth of the whole surface of such external wall, then every
part thereof, not built in the manner and of the several materials,
by this Bye-Law directed for external walls, must be taken down;
and the same must be re-built in such manner and of such
materials, for and in all respects as by this Bye-Law directed for
external walls hereafter to be built, according to the class and rate
of the building to which such external wall or enclosure shall
belong.
External wall used as a party-wall.? And with regard to external
walls to be used as party-walls to any building adjoining thereto
(except an attached building or office as Is hereinbefore described):
If the external wall of any building have not such footings, or be
not of such heights and thicknesses, or be not built in such man-
ner and of such materials as are herein directed for party-walls of
buildings of the highest rate to which such wall shall adjoin, then
such external wall must not be used as a party-wall for any such
building; but there must be a distinct external wall, built, as
herein described for external walls, of the rate to which it shall
belong.
But if such external wall to any building already built be, at the
least, thirteen inches in thickness in every part, and be of sound
and proper materials and in good condition, then such wall may be
used as a party-wall; but if the house, of which such wall forms a
part, be re-built within five years from the time at which the wall
shall have been so first used as a party-wall, then such wall must
become subject to the provisions of this Bye-Law, in respect of
party-walls, according to the class and rate to which the said wall
did first belong.


Schedule C.? Part 3.
Division of buildings by party-walls.
If it be intended to divide any building into two or more distinct
parts, then every wall for that purpose must be built as a party-
wall in the manner, and of the materials, and of the several
heights and thicknesses for party-walls of the highest rate of
building, to which such party-wall shall belong or adjoin,
as prescribed in reference to the thickness of party-walls in
Schedule B.
And if any building already built, or which shall be hereafter
built, be converted, used, or occupied, as two or more separate
buildings, each having a separate entrance or stair-case, such con-
version, use, or occupation, not having been made prior to this Bye-
Law coming into operation; then every such building shall be
deemed to be two or more separate houses, and such separate
houses must be divided from each other by a party-wall, built in
the manner and of the materials required for party-walls, for the
class and rate to which the largest of the buildings so divided shall
belong
Site 'of party-walls.? lf the buildings be of equal rate, then such
party-walls must be built on the line of the junction of such
buildings, one-half on the ground of the owner of one of such
buildings, and one-half on the ground of the owner of the other of
such buildings. , , ? * .
If such buildings be of different rates, then such wall must be
built on the line of junction thereof, as follows ; ?that is to say,
one-half of the thickness of the wall required for the building of
the lower rate, on the ground of each of the adjoining owners ; and
the whole of the additional thickness of the wall required for the
building of the higher rate, on the ground of the owner of such
building of the higher rate, . ,
And if such building of the lower rate be thereafter enlarged or
altered, so as to become a building of a higher rate, then the owner
of such first mentioned building of the higher rate, for the time
being, shall be entitled to receive from the owner of such building
of the lower rate such sum of money as shall be sufficient com-
pensation for the ground occupied by that portion of the party-
wall. which, according to the rate of the building enlarged, ought
to have been built by its owner on his own ground, as well as
the value of so much of the wall itself, as may be more
than the owner of such building of the lower rate had already paid
for ?
Construction and materials.? Every party-wall must be built
of sound bricks or stone, or of such bricks and stone together,
laid in mortar or cement, in such manner as to produce solid

beams, breastsummers, girders,trimming joists, and the ends ot par-
tition heads and sills, and the bearing ends of the mam timbers of
a roof, and wood-bricks, may be laid into the substance ot a party-
wall; but no such beam, breastsummer, girder, joist, partition, head


or sill nor any part of a roof being wood, nor any wood-bricks must
be laid or placed within two inches of the centre of any party-wall;
and norther woodwork of any kind must be laid into, placed upon,
or be run or driven into any part of the substance of any party-wall.
But if the ends of timbers be carried on iron shoes or stone
corbels then such iron shoes or stone corbels must be built into the
wall, at the least, one-half of the thickness of such wall.
And the top of every party-wall must be finished with one
course of sound hard bricks, set on edge with good mortar or

ciently?water-proof and fire-proof covering.
Heiaht of party-walls above roof. ?If a party-wall adjoin to any
roof then such party-wall must be carried up and remain one foot
six inches, at the least, above the part where the party-wall and
roof kdjoin, measured at a right angle with the back of the rafters
And if any party-wall, in any building of the first class, adjoin a
gutter, then such party-wall must be carried up, and remain two
feet at the least, above the highest part of any such gutter.
And if any party-wall in any building of the second class adjoin
a gutter then such party-wall must be carried up and remain
three feet, at the least, above the highest part of any such gutter.
If there be fixed, within five feet of a party-wall upon the flat or
roof of a building, any turret, dormer, lantern light, or other erec-
tion of combustible materials, then every such party-wall must be
carried up next to every such turret, dormer lantern light, or
other erection, and must extend one foot six inches higher and one
foot six inches wider, than any such erection on each side thereof.
Openings in party -walls. -With regard to any dwelling-houses
wMch when united, shall be, and continue to be, in the same
occupation, then Upon its being declared by the Surveyor, that, in
his opinion, the stability of any or either of such dwelling-houses
will not be endangered by making such openings, they may be

only with the consent and authority of the Surveyor, first had and
obtained, and so that such recesses be arched over, and so that the
hnek of anv such recess be not nearer than seven inches to the
pentre of the party-wall in the first or lowest storey, nor nearer
than four inches to the centre of the party-wall in any other story
and so that the stability and sufficiency of such party-wall be not
iniuriously affected thereby ; if any chases be required for the
insertion of ends of walls, of piers, of chimney jambs, of withes of
flues of metal pipes, or of iron story posts; then every chase for
such purpose, must not be left or be cut nearer than lour
inches, P at the least, to the centre of a party-wall, nor within a dis-
