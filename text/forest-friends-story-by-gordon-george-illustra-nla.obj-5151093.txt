FOREST FRIENDS
DURING the sunny Easter holidays,
John, his sister Susan and their friends Jill
and Peter, were out hiking in the woods.
As they walked, twigs and dry leaves

crackled so loudly that rabbits scurried to
their burrows in the side of a hill.
As the sun was high in the sky, it was
about mid-day when the children reached
the spot they liked best of all. It was a
shady glade where a spring bubbled up
through the rocks worn smooth by trick-
ing water for many hundreds of years.


They took off their haversacks and, after
a refreshing drink from the spring, sat
down to eat the tasty lunches their
mothers had prepared for them.
When lunch was over, they decided to
rest for awhile, because they had walked
a long way and even John, who was ten
years of age and the eldest of the party,
was glad to rest his legs.
They were so still and quiet that the
quaint bush sounds, which people miss
when they make too much noise, began
to reach their ears.
The buzzing of bees seemed to get
louder and louder. Summer was nearing
its end, and so the bees were busy making
honey and storing it up for the winter in
the hollow trunk of a tree.
One bee in particular seemed extra busy,
and Susan, who had been watching him
for some time, called him Bobby Bee.
Birds came nearer and the children were
thrilled to see the lovely colours of their
feathers. Just then, one bird flew quite
close to them. He was not like the other


birds because he had no bright plumage,
but nature, as usual, was kind to this bird
in another way. Before long, the bird
lifted his head and sang most beautifully.
The children had heard his song many
times before, but had never, until then,
seen the bird that sang so sweetly.


It was so pleasant and peaceful resting
there, that nearly two hours slipped by
before Susan suggested packing up for
the tramp homewards. When they rose,
Jill pointed to a small army of ants which
were carrying crumbs away to their home
underneath the ground. She said, "Look


at little Anthony Ant trying to carry a
piece of crust three times his size/'
Anthony was struggling so gamely that
Jill helped him along with his heavy load.
The ants were working as if they had
not a moment to lose, and the children
wondered how so many of them could
work in one little home and were curious
to know what it looked like down there
in the ground.
John led the way as they started for
home, all singing merrily as they went.
After travelling for nearly a mile, John
made a signal to be quiet. They grouped
together at a big bend in the creek and
John told them that he had seen something
move in the branches of a large tree.
All four fixed their eyes on the tree and
did not have long to wait before they saw
a frisky squirrel which they quickly recog-
nized as their old friend Sammy. He had
special markings on his back and the
children had seen him near the creek
several times before.


Sammy Squirrel, carrying a large nut,
scampered half-way down the tree and
hopped into the hollow branch which was
his home. He was gathering nuts while
they were plentiful, so that he could have
something to eat in the wet winter months
when food was scarce.

These children loved the birds and ani-
mals in the woods; they were their forest
friends.
By now, the sun had disappeared behind
some dark clouds that had blown up, so
Jill suggested making haste for home,
which was nearly a mile away.


They were almost out of the woods when
it started to rain, but fortunately they
knew where there was a cave to shelter in.
"Anthony Ant and his pals knew this
rain was coming" said Peter, and the
other children all agreed that the ap-
proaching rain was the reason for the
frantic rush at "Antville."
The shower did not last long, so the boys
and girls ran home as quickly as they
could, and they only just got home when
a loud clap of thunder seemed to give the
signal for the heavy rain which pelted
down all night long.
Sitting by a cosy fire, John and Susan
told their parents all about the interesting
day which they had spent in the woods. At
Jill's and Peter's home, a similar scene
was taking place.
Parents and children all agreed that
people can learn many valuable lessons
from our forest friends.
The lesson of thrift was taught that day
by Bobby Bee, Anthony Ant and Sammy
Squirrel. They saved for their future


needs, and that is something everyone
should learn to do.
Saving money in your School Bank will
help you to buy the things you want very
much. It is fun saving for a bicycle, a
camera, a stamp album, a tennis racket,
a football, a watch, a tent, a camping out-
fit, favourite books and many other things
you would like to have. You will be sur-
prised how deposits in your School Bank
book will add up to a considerable sum if
you save something, however little, every
week. There is this about it, too when
your parents know you are saving hard for
something, it will encourage them to help
you.
Needless don't forget the lesson
by our forest friends that it pays to save
for security too.
Remember also, that The Savings Bank
of South Australia is your very own Bank.
THE END
