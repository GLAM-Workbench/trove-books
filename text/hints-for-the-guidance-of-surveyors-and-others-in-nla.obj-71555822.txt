NOTE.
These hints for guidance in collecting Minerais, &c., are
not intended for those who are engaged in mine surveying or
the like. It is presumed that their previous training lias
made them acquainted with the manner in which such kind
of work should be done.
Instructions relative to the mode in which Mining Maps
should be constructed, and the observations which the Mining
or Geological Surveyor should make when engaged in survey-
ing minerai tracts, are purposely omitted.
This little pamphlet is designed solely for the use of
those who h�ve not heretofore had their attention directed to
the subjects of which it treats.




HINTS
FOR THE
GUIDANCE OF SURVEYORS AND OTHERS IN COLLECTING
SPECIMENS OF ROCKS, &o.
Eyery person who travels in the country lias the opportunity of
making observations, which, properly recorded, cannot fail to be
instructive and useful. The discovery of a rock, such as granit�,
or gneiss, or clay-slate, in a locality where it was not previously
known to occur, though at the first view apparently insignificant,
might lead to the advancement of the material interests of the
country. It is safe to say that not one accurately recorded ob-
servation of the oharacter of the rocks of the country would be
valueless, and, when viewed in connection with other facts, could
not fail to lead to useful results.
It is d�sirable that each surveyor should procure a good ]
sketch-map of the district within which he labors, on a scale of
half an inch to one mile, and keep it solely for the purpose of
recording on it the boundaries of the several rock formations, the
position and direction of veins and dykes, the places where fossils
occur, the localities of volcanic hills and crateriform lakes, the
sites of limestone quarries, &c., &c., &c.
On his return from a journey, he can fill in on such a map
from his note-book, without much trouble, ail that he lias observed
relative to the direction and the culminating points of ranges, the
boundaries of granit�s and porphyries, the occurrence of veins and
Prospecting
map.


dykes, and the like. Every road that is made discloses some new
feature in tlie geology of the country, and every flood causes
changes which, if noted at the right time, add to our knowledge
of the physical geography of our country. The filling of a
swamp that for years lias heen but a mud-hole, or the over-
flowing of a lake, shows what may h�ve heen the condition of the
surface in past finies, and enables one to account for alt�rations of
level and the occurrence of alluviums and drift in many places
which, but for such information, would be matters of conjecture
merely.
In travelling over the batsaltic plains of the south-western
district, or the level tertiaries of the north-western part of the
colony, one cornes suddenly om patches occupied by pal�ozoic
rocks or granit�. As regardas the former, the surveyor should
note and record in his book thei strike and the dip of the rocks.
Great care is necessary in deterrmining these, and several outcrops
of the rock should be looked att. The strike is the direction of
the basset edges of the strata iin relation to the true or magnetic
meridian, and the dip is the aingle which strata forai with the
plane of the horizon. Assum�ng that a outting were made at
right-angles to the strike, the sltrike and the dip would be shown
as in this diagram :
a?a, c?c, e?e, repfesent the strike.. a?h, c?d, e?f, represent the dip.
In places where a cutting is miade obliquely to the strike, or on
the line of the strike, more tham usual care is necessary in deter-
mining the angle of dip.

In this table, only those numbers are given which are likely to be found of use in practice
and that chiefly to the nearest whole number, omitting fractions.?
The following table, extracted from Beete Juke?s Student?s
Manual of Geology, will be useful to the surveyor. It shows
the diff�rent modes of stating the dip :
An examination of such rocks should be made in order to
ascertain whether or not they contain fossils (even obscure mark-
ings are important) or minerais soattered through the mass such
as pyrites, or intercalated in the planes of bedding as sulphate of
lime, or on the faces of the joints as carbonate of copper, or as an
efflorescence on the surface of long-exposed faces as alum.
In like manner a search should be made for dykes and veins.
The former in the upper silurian rocks are usually wide and well
marked. The width and the direction of them should be recorded,
and it should be noted whether or not they h�ve disturbed the
strata, and whether or not they contain minerais. Blocks broken
out of the middle of the dyke should be looked at very carefully,
as many minerais of the felspar family may probably occur in


. �
them. If ve�ns of quartz are seen, they should be described, and
portions of them, including pi�ces of both walls, should be col-
lected for examination.
If a water-course intersect the formation, observe and note
its direction, and whether or not the banks or slopes are steeper
on one side than the other.
Where an isolated piece of pal�ozoic country is found as
above described, it might be well to make a note of the kind of
timber growing on ,it.
Horizontal strata, or strata, with a slight dip, may be of any
�ge in this colony from the naiesozoic to the tertiary, and the
observer should delineate on hia prospecting map the boundaries
of these rocks, note the charactter and composition of the strata,
and whether thick or thin beddesd ; and ail quarries, and the stuff
thrown out of wells and excavattions, should be searched for fossils
and minerais.
The tertiaries met with in the interior will be probably the
usual auriferous tertiaries, but here and there occur lacustrine
deposits of limestone, with braclkish and fresh-water shells. The
sites of ail these should be maiiked on the prospecting map, and
specimens should be gathered.
The observer should mafcie sketch-sections of such strata
when he has time at his disposai!.
Such as the following will Ibe instructive :
x x Pal�ozoic rocks. a a Limesitone, with shells. ? c c Yolcanic rock.
In any place where wells h�ve been sunk in old swamps or
in the beds of dry lakes, verti?al sections should be obtained if
practicable, and in such places a search should be made for fossil
leaves and bones. In some of (the swamps near Mount Greenock
fossil bones of great value to the pal�ontologist h�ve been found ;


and in many other parts of the colony the same features are pre-
sented.
In an ancient swamp near Smeaton, fossil leaves, fossil fruits,
and the stems and branches of trees, are found enclosed in hardened
mud ; and in the leads at Haddon, splendid examples of a now
extinct v�g�tation h�ve been obtained.
The granit�s should be examined with equal care, and, if ?
practicable, specimens taken from the heart of a block should be
brought away. If elvans or veins of quartz intersect them, the
direction of them should be noted ; and if any patches be seen
diff�rent in appearance from the g�n�ral mass, portions of them
should be broken out for examination. The appearance, size, and
character of the tors, and whether or not they pr�sent themselves
on ail sides or on only one side of the hill, should be also recorded;
and if on one side only, then it should be stated to what point of
the compass that side faces.
If the v�g�tation of any granitic tract be peculiar, the ob-
server should give information respecting it.
The areas occupied by porphyries and trap rocks should be
delineated on the prospecting map ; and if in any part they are
seen to abut on sedimentary rocks, a sketch-section should be
made at the point of junction.
In the basaltic and volcanic rocks, and in the tracts occupied
by them, there are many things to note. In basaltic quarries are
found zeolites and other minerais of great value to the mineralo-
gist, and in the volcanic rocks in some places specimens of rare
occurrence. It is proper to note on the map even the smallest
patch of basait or volcanic rock ; and ail c�nes, crateriform hills,
and lakes should be sketched, and the sites shown on the pro-
specting map. That side of a crateriform hill where the wall is
broken, and where there would be an ontlet for water if the crater
were full to overflowing, should be described, and the point of the
compass to which it faces recorded both on the map and in the
note-book. If any springs occur on the sides of such hills, the
temp�rature of the water should be ascertained ; and wherever
minerai springs are found, some of the water should be collected
for examination.
Granit�s.
Basai ts and
volcanic
rocks.


In the volcanic tracts are found caves, with bone-brecoia.
When opportunity serves, these should be explored, and specimens
of the bones and minerais brought away for examination. The
rather rare minerai, struvite, has been found in such caves in
Victoria.
In collecting fossil bones, it is often very difficult to preserve
them even for a short time. They are usually friable, and when
removed from the bed in which they occur are liable to destruc-
tion. If the specimens be dipped in thin warm glue, and allowed
to dry, they can be moved generally with safety, but sometimes
ail the care that can be bestowed on them is ineffectual for their
pr�servation. As they occur at Bacohus Marsh and in the ter-
tiaries of Gippsland, they can be packed safely in cotton-wool or
dry grass.
In basaltic quarries, there rmay be seen in some places dykes
altogether diff�rent in appearanc? from the mass of rock which
they traverse. The direction of such dykes should be marked
on the map, and specimens shoulid be collected. Many highly
interesting dykes, presenting lomg hexagonal prisms of small
diaraeter lying horizontally and packed closely together, and
resembling indurated volcanic muid, are found in the quarries
near Gisborne.
Where the basaltic rocks forim cliffs on the coast, there the
observer may look on the beach for agates and jaspera ; and in the
clefts of the rock for vivianite and other minerais.
In such localities, the basaltic rocks do not always pr�sent the
same structure. For instance, neiar Cape Schanck and in other
parts of the colony the upper layier of basait is nearly black in
color and in structure columnar, and the lower stratum is dark-
red or brown, and in rude, roughi layers. Ail such peculiarities
should be described in the note-bocok, and the place marked on the
map.
Between layers of the older amd new basait, a search should
be made for mud shales, which usmally contain fragments of fossil
wood, fossil fruits, and the impressions of leaves. An instructive
section of this kind is seen on the western byewash of the Malms-
bury R�servoir. In ail cases whiere beds of gravel or mud are
found lying between layers of baisait, a sketch-section should be
made, and the locality marked on (the prospecting map.


In travelling over an area where the rocks appear to be much
older than tertiaries, but less inclined than the well-marked silu-
rian rocks, the beds of the creeks intersecting such an area, and
ail cliffs and projecting masses of rock, should be searched for
coal. If a seam is found outcropping, it may perhaps be very
thin. The observer should carefully note its thickness, and the
character of the rocks above and below it, because a seam as seen
at the outcrop, though perhaps only twelve or eighteen inches in
thickness, may really be a valuable bed, four, six, or eight feet
thick. The slipping away of the under part, if it be soft, and the
pressure of the rock mass above, may cause a seam to be very thin
at the point where it is seen, and thus mislead, if its exact situation
in relation to the other beds be not described. Ail such places
should be searched also for fossils, the importance of which in
leading to just conclusions as to the character of a coal-field cannot
be over-estimated.
Veins of antimony occur in the upper silurian rocks in many
places. It is easy to pass by blocks of the oxyd of this minerai
without detecting their character. The oxyd of antimony in color
and appearance strongly resembles a yellowish or brown mudstone.
Its greater weight and its hardness, however, distinguish it from
other minerai substances likely to occur with it. A very thick
vein, composed of the sulphide and oxyd of antimony, occurs near
Dunolly in rocks supposed to be lower silurian.
In granitic tracts, there will be found garnets, some of the
rarer forais of mica and felspar, and perhaps crystals of oxyd of
tin. If the latter minerai is found in the bed of any creek, every
opportunity should be taken to examine the granit� at the sources
of the creek and at the heads of its tributaires in order to find the
vein, the source of the stream-tin. The discovery of a vein of tin
ore might open up to the miner a rich district. In ail parts where
the granit� is d�compos�! in situ (and in granit� drift, or in
places where the granit� has been washed down and re-deposited),
a search should be made for minerais.
Stains on rocks, if bright-green or blue, and any minerai re-
sembling iron pyrites, but much softer when touche! with the
knife, should lead the observer to suspect the presence of some ore


of copper, and he should collect speoimens for examination. It is
true that some species of pyrites, such as pyrrhotine and lolingite,
resemble the suiphides of copper, but any bright yellowish minerai
that is similar to iron pyrites, but softcr, should be collected for
�xamination.
The appearance of galena is so well kuown, that nothing need
be said liere respecting it, except to suggest that wherever it is
found speoimens should be sent to Melbourne for analysis.
If the surveyor?s duties lead him to the coast, he may h�ve
the opportunity of collecting marine shells. As a rule only
living shells should be taken, and they should be preserved in
sp�rits,
Shells from the inland lakes and land shells, whether living
or dead, should be collected. The dead shells should be packed
in cotton-wool and put in a box, and the living shells preserved in
spirits.
In passing over the pal�ozoic ranges, chips of black basait,
stone axes, and spear heads are often seen. These should be col-
lected.
When a very large nugget is found, there is usually a great
deal of excitement, and a not unreasouable haste on the part of
the finders to h�ve it beaten up and weighed or melted, and con-
sequently no cast of it is taken. The largest nugget in the world,
?The Welcome Stranger,? is now represented only by a sketch.
No cast or fac-simil� was made of it, but, because of its interesting
character, some spurioua models, purporting to be fac-simil�s, are,
it is believed, now in some mus�ums. Such spurious models are
likely to tnislead ; and in order that, in future, the surveyors may
secure accurate models, which are of great importance in a scien-
tific point of view, the following instructions h�ve been prepared
for their guidance :
Form a band of putty on the nugget (a a, f�g. 1) about one
inch high and a quarter of an inch thick round a portion (I) which
lias no underlying projections which would prevent the s�para-
tion of the plaster when dry from the object. The portion (1)
inside the band of putty must now be well oiled, and, having


mixed a sufficient quantity of plaster-of-paris to the consistency of
cream, pour it gradually on the oiled portion until it rises to the
level of the putty band. Allow it to set for ten or fifteen minutes,
then take it off carefully, by inserting the point of a blunt knife
under it. Pare the edges, and make one or more small holes or
d�pr�ssions in the pared edges about one quarter of an inch deep
(see fig. 3, which shows a section of a small portion of two adja-
cent edges). Fig. 1 represents a nugget, the mould for which
consists of flve pi�ces. The dotted lines on the face of the nugget
show the boundaries of each of these pi�ces, with the exception,
of course, of those portions which, being on the distant side of the
object, cannot be seen without turning it. Referring, then, to
fig. 1, it will be seen that the portion of the edge of mould 1 from
ato h forms one side of mould 2, the remaining boundary being
made, as before, by a putty band, mould 1 being put in its place
on the nugget. Proceed as before, oiling the space to be covered
by mould 2, also the edge of mould 1, and afterwards pour in the
plaster-of-paris. When this second casting is set, separate as
before, and it will be perceived a small projection (see fig. 3) bas
been cast on the edge in contact with a b, by the plaster filling
the small hole left in that edge. This being done in ail the edges,
will enable the moulds to be kept firmly together without danger
of shifting. Now pare the remaining edges of mould 2, and, after
making holes where necessary, put it in its place on the nugget,
and proceed as before to mark out with putty, oiling the space and
edges, and cast mould 3, and as many more as may be required.
The last mould will require no band of putty, as it will be sur-
rounded on ail sides by the edges of the other moulds. When ail
the moulds are completed, mark the outside edges for convenience
of joining (see fig. 2), and make a hole about one and a half inch
in diameter in one of them for pouring in the plaster. The mould
must be tied together with strong twine before filling it with the
liquid plaster, having previously oiled it thoroughly. It must also
not be forgotten that the edges of ail the moulds must be well
oiled when casting the moulds that join them, else they cannot be
separated. The number and size of the moulds will d�pend upon
the form of the nugget, but a little practice will soon enable the
operator to d�termine the proper outline for each mould. The
best plaster should be used if practieable ; and the same piece of


Fig. 1.?Nugget, with bamd of putty for mould 1 laid on.
The dotted lines mark (he borandary of the remaining moulds,
which are also shown as complerte, but separated from the nugget.
Fig. 2.?Moulds fixed and tied together, ready for making a cast of the nugget.
putty can be used for the bands throughout, by kneading it fre-
quently in the hand.
If a cast cannot be taken, accurate drawings should be made
of the nugget in several positions, and ali its peculiarities should
be noted. If it exhibits casts of quartz crystals, models of these
may be taken in gutta percha. The exact weight when found,
the melting loss, and flneness of the gold, should be obtained from
the assayer.
In collecting water for analysis, the following instructions
should be observed :
The water should be collected in thoroughly clean glass


bottles, with glass stoppers (which can be obtained at the Office of
Mines), and as soon as the stopper is put in, the bottle should be
sealed up with sealing-wax.
So as to procure it as pure as possible, it should be taken
from that portion of the mine or spring where the flow is greatest,
and at the point (if in a mine) where �t flows into a drive or stope,
but never from the pumps or well.
Immediately upon collection the- color and clearness should
be noted, and the temp�rature.
It should be observed whether ;any gas is disengaged from
the water, and the odour and taste shiould be noted. The depth
at which the water was obtained, the character of the rock from
whence the water flows, whether the supply is constant or not, and
whether it is affected by rains, and tire date of collection, should
be given.
The following instructions are intended to guide surveyors
and others in taking observations of the temp�rature of the air and
water underground :
The thermometer should be examined to see that it is quite
free from dust or damp wheu it is placed in position.
Whilst making the observation tho breath should be held, and
the observer should be very careful that his eye is as near the
level of the top of the mercury as possible, for if the eye be too
high the reading wili be too low, and vice versa.
The readings must be made from the scale on the left side of
the instrument, marked Fahrt. Should the mercury, however,
stand between two Unes of degrees on the Fahrenheit side, and
directly on one of the Unes of the centigrade, an additional note to
that effect should be made.
The readings should be taken as quickly as possible, and the
reader must be careful not to alter the temp�rature of the bulb by
approaching his candie or himself too closely toit.
The date of each observation must be recorded, and the hour
of the surface observations.
In case any particular reading may appear to be inaccurate,
it will be well to make a second or even a third observation. The
dates, &c., to be noted.


Any pecular circumstances that may h�ve existed during an
observation should be made a note of, so that if there was not time
or opportunity to make a check observation due allowance may be
made.
1. An observation should be made of the temp�rature of the
air on the surface in the shade.
2. As soon as possible after the first observation, another
should be made in the shaft at 60 feet in depth, and subsequently
at each successive 60 feet to the bottom of the shaft.
3. Should there be any workings in the vicinity of the place
where the instrument is fixed, pr�cautions should be taken to pre-
vent the heated air engendered by the workmen or blasting op�ra-
tions having any effect on it.
4. If there are any old drill-holes near the spot where it is
decided to take an observation, they should, if dry, be taken ad-
vantage of to place the thermometer in. A paper stopper should
be f�rmly placed in the moutli of the hole, if there is sufficient
clear height above the instrument to permit of it.
5. The depth in feet and inches should be recorded with each
reading, and the distance in a level from the nearest shaft.
6. The direction of the draught, whether up or down the
shaft, and approximately its speed, should be noted.
7. A description of the kind of rock in which the shaft or
drive may be sunk or driven should be noted, and its underlie.
1. In ail places where the temp�rature of the water is ob-
served, the temp�rature of the air in the shade should also be
obtained.
2. If the water percolates up through the dehris which may
be lying on the bottom of a level, the d�bris should be cleared
from the spot where the water wells up, so that the water may
flow direct from the rock on the instrument.
3. The temp�rature of the water in the shade at the surface
near the shaft should be observed. Water that has been raised
from the mine is best, if it has been undisturbed sufficiently long
to give a fairly accurate reading.
4. The temp�rature of the water at the shallowest level (not
less than forty feet in depth) in which it flows should be taken on


The same day as the surface water, and subsequently it should
be obtained at each successive level beneatb.
5. If there are any old drill-holes near the spot where it is
decided to take an observation, they should, if yielding a flow of
water, be taken advantage of to place the thermometer in.
6. The depth in feet and inches should be recorded with
each reading, and the distance in a level from the nearest shaft.
7. The approximate quantity of water flowing at the time of
the observation should be recorded, land whether the flow is con-
stant or affected by rains on the surfiace.
8. A description of the kind off rock from which the water
flows should be noted and recorded, aand its underlie.

Opportunity should be taken to interest the miners in the
work of collecting specimens. They will always willingly collect
for examination the heavier stuflf left in the sluice-boxes, and the
last handful in the dish when they ?pan off,? and in these a
search should be made for gem stones. Diamonds are known to
ocour in the Ovens district ; and one or two h�ve been found in
the neighborhood of Sandhurst. More certain knowledge respect-
ing their mode of occurrence is d�sirable, and with care on the
part of the observer it can be obtained. Small but fine sapphires
h�ve been brought from the Tubba Rubba Creek, in the county
of Mornington ; in a creek near Berwick there occur (besides
sapphires) rubies, topazes, and zircons ; near the Elue Mountains
(Trentham), zircons and sapphires ; at Mount Blackwood, Maldon,
and Talbot, fine topazes and amethysts ; and in the basin of the
River Yarra, the onyx, good agates, and cornelians.
It is hoped enough has been said to show the importance of
collecting specimens, when that can be done without interf�rence
with the duties which devolve on a surveyor. It is not intended,
nor indeed would it bo d�sirable, that surveyors should give
much of their time to this work. These hints for their guidance
are given in order that more attention may be devoted to the work
of collecting, and that proper care may be taken when they find a
minerai in recording ail the facts connected with its mode of
occurrence, the exact spot whence it was taken, whether it occurs
in quantity, and how the locality is situated as regards water and
the like.
The cost of the carriage of specimens will be defrayed by the
Mining department, and the discoverer will be informed of the
character of them.
