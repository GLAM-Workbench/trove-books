PUBLISHERS’ NOTE.
N presenting this brochure of the Clarence River to the public, we would like to give them some idea
JlKKll °f the nature °f work upon which we have been engaged, the time and trouble involved in its
II fU compilation, and the obtaining and arranging of the views; and also as to the costliness of the work.
With the advice of those who take an interest and a pride in the Clarence, we decided that we would
bring out a work which would not only show the beauties of this noble River, but would also give
Australia at large a knowledge of the wonderful and varied resources of this part of the colony; and
would at the same time be a source of pride to ourselves, the printers and engravers, and to the Clarence people.
With this end in view, arrangements were made with the best printers and engravers in Sydney—Messrs. Batson and
Co., Ltd., and Mr. E. R. Morris.
Then, for the past couple of months, Mr. Stevenson, Grafton’s well-known photographer, has been from one
end of the river to the other taking views, which include a bird’s-eye view of Grafton, the streets and public buildings
of North and South Grafton, the parks and gardens, pretty spots on the River, some Grafton homes, charming views
of the Upper Clarence the Lower Clarence, including special pages of Ulmarra and Maclean, Palmer’s Island, and
Yamba Heads; and, in addition, special pages of the Sugar, Farming, Dairying, Timber, and Mining Industries.
All these views had then to be tastefully arranged and forwarded to Sydney, so that blocks could be produced
by the photo-zinco process.
Then with regard to the literary work: Mr. J. A. Mclntyre, whose descriptive articles of North Queensland
scenery, Kosciusko, and the Limestone Caves of this colony under the pen name of “ Killeevy,” were pronounced by
competent judges to be the finest and most complete which have yet appeared, has been engaged in going over the
Clarence, collating material on the early history, its progress, its pleasure resorts, and its beauty spots. All this has
been written up in “ Killeevy’s ” best style.


Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Mclntyre have done their work, the cost of which to them of printing and engraving
alone, without including their own time and trouble and incidental expenses, was over £l2O. They feel saisfied the
work is well done, as far as human power could have it so. It is not intended to be a Guide Book; the brochure is
simply issued to show the beauties and the importance of the Clarence. Wherefore we make no apology. We give
to the Clarence people a work which should be issued at a considerably higher figure for the sum of is. 6d., and we
hope our efforts will be appreciated. THE PUBLISHERS

PREFATORY NOTE.
f •11 LST gazing enraptured from Wilson’s Hill, the first evening of my arrival in Grafton, on
II the beautiful River below, the thought occurred to me as I watched the changing effects of
light and shade on the mirror-like surface of the water, the fluctuations of colour and
beauty of outline of banks and hill, and the charm and the wealth of foliage, the darker and
more sombre colours brightened up with the vivid green of cane fields and pasture lands, with the blue hills in the
distance, and soft cloud shadows flitting by —the thought, 1 say, entered my mind : Do the Clarence River people
really know and appreciate the charms of their noble River, or have they been too modest to extol its beauties?
Why, then, has not the Clarence been placed upon the Tourists’ Route, and its lovely landscape views brought more
prominently before the Australian public.
That the beauties and resources of the Clarence are but vaguely known, I had evidence myself, on returning
here a few days ago. “ Where are you going ?’’said a friend. “I’m going to the Clarence,” I replied. “Where’s
that? are you coming back to-night ?” Now, this is humiliating, but it is nevertheless a fact. And the same thing
applies to a communitv as to an individual: If you do not assert yourselves and make yourselves known, you will
remain incognito.
Subsequent peregrinations confirmed and intensified the impressions first formed, and not alone showed me
that the Clarence people possessed a magnificent River, but that Nature has been most beneficent to this part of the
colony, giving her great areas of rich arable land and extensive pasturages, and forests of the finest cedar, and pine,
and yellow-wood, and other timbers; and that far away and back into the lapse of centuries —back, perhaps, into the
cryptic dimness of antiquity—geology has been gradually turning the forests beneath into coal measures which in the
verv near future will be turned to account in the Clarence district.


I have, therefore, carefully gathered a bouquet of observations, cuiled from the choicest sources, and garnished
them with quotations from some of our best English and Australian poets —poor Henry Kendall chiefly, for it was by
the river banks and amongst the lovely scenes on the Clarence that he imbibed the inspiration which called forth the
Poetic Muse.
For the information on the resources of the district, I am greatly indebted to Mr. G. H. Varley, and to Mr.
A. Gray, for notes of the late Mr. Bawden’s records of the early history. I have carefully avoided giving personal
character sketches, except of the district members, for even if it were not injudicious to do so. my whole space will be
taken up with description, and information, and views. We have refrained also from putting in photos, with the
exception of the gentlemen named, and those of the writer and artist, the latter being included because custom says
they must go in; and our modesty has been overruled, for, unlike Plazo-toro, we must bow to Fashion.
However, I trust that the accompanying pages will be read, that the people will be pleased, and that the
Clarence River will benefit thereby.

A ROMANCE OF HISTORY.
early history of settlement on the Clarence
is unfortunately wrapped up in the mists and
(IPIN)'P shadows of the past. No accurate record has
i^olllgcjpi b een kept; but nevertheless there are still
; amongst us to-day men who loomed large on
the history of those troublous times, who though
now standing upon the Shores of Time, have a vivid recollec-
tion of the events which led up to the discovery and settlement
of the Clarence Some, alas, of those who figured in the
history of the past have gone over the Great Divide, and
some, such as poor old Lardner, now hover on the borders of
the Shadowland, and may pass away even while this scrap of
history is being written.
Differences of opinion will exist as to some of the events
of the pre-historic days. All that I can do is simply to get
the most reliable information available, have this confirmed as
far as possible by living authorities, and then present it to the
public, not as an authentic record, but to show the rising
generation what their forefathers had to go through, and on
the part of the old people themselves to touch the chord of
memory, so that scenes perhaps long forgotten may be recalled
and talked over.
This brief retrospect will also serve to indicate, by com-
parison, the great progress which the Clarence has made in a
decade.
THE DISCOVERY OF THE CLARENCE.
The discovery of the Clarence River is said to be due to
a man named Craig, who made his escape from Moreton Bay
Penal Settlement, in about the year 1827. For seven years
he resided with the blacks, but in 1834 or 1835 he tell in with
some Government stockmen from Port Macquarie; to these
he communicated the whereabouts of three Government bul-
locks, and for his knowledge was awarded a conditional pardon.
He first told the authorities of the existence of the “ Big
River,” and in consequence of his information the revenue
cutter “ Prince George ” was despatched to make enquiries.
The cutter only travelled as far as the Heads, and seeing a
long line of foam with no apparent break across the entrance,
turned back to Sydney again.
RICH FORESTS OF CEDAR.
Craig, after receiving his pardon, told of the existence of
the river to several persons in Sydney, notably Mr. Francis
Girard and Mr. Thomas Small. Each of these gentlemen,
after some hesitation and persuaded by Craig’s glowing account
of the cedar on the banks of the river, determined to despatch
a vessel to verify the story. The “ Susan,” owned by Mr.
Small, was first to arrive, and safely negotiating the bar, pro-
ceeded as far as what is now known as Maclean, and the party
disembarked.
Ultimately the Small family removed to Woodford Island.
Mr. Girard’s schooner “Taree” arrived on the river some
time subsequent to the “Susan,” and her destination was
Tynedale. The arrival of the “Susan” is given-as in the
year 1837, and from this period mud be dated the settlement
of the Clarence.

A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest.”— Montgomery.


PICTURESQUE CLARENCE.
The Noblest Waterway in Australia.
nN his sojourn over the Australia’s the writer has
happened upon some beautiful and sublime
river scenery ; has bathed ill the icy waters of
the Snowy River, on Kosciusko’s rugged
heights, and steamed up and down the pictu-
resque Hawkesbury, fished in the Murray and
Murrumbidgee’s snaggy and narrow streams, scanned the
waters of Victoria’s Upper Yarra, sought out the charm-
ing nooks in the romantic Derwent and Tamar in the
“tight little island,” watched the festive alligators peer-
ing from the mangrove-lined banks of Northern Queens-
land streams, and beheld the sun setting on the enchanting
Johnstone. All have their special beauties but, as a waterway,
the ( larence eclipses them all.
Sometimes, when enthusiasts wax eloquent over the beau-
ties of land or sea scape they are prone to exaggeration, and
when one sees them he is apt to be disappointed. Well, this
is not the case in regard to the Clarence River, which far
exceeds all that has been said about it It has not been praised
half enough. Of course the Clarence people, like the Sydneyites
with regard to their “ beautiful harbour,” will meet you with
the interrogation: “what do you think of our river ? ” But,
after listening to the encomiums on its majestic beauty, they
stop there ; little or no attempt is made to have it brought
within the track of the tourists.
It was, therefore, with no little surprise I gazed on the
b.oad stream, with its green mossy banks and bright hued
foliage, its handsome villas and cottages reposing on its banks,
the pretty town of Maclean the long stretch of placid water at
Ulmarra, the first glimpses of Grafton as you approach at
evening, with Elizabeth Island and Alipou Creek on your left
and Susan Island in front, with hundreds of beautiful tints and
demi-tints from foliage and pasture lands and sylvan glades,
and as the poet has put it:
“ Its patches rich shaded with fern as it grew,
And mantled the hills with its Tyrian hue.”
How Wordsworth, too, would have revelled in the scene had
he accompanied the writer to the top of Wilson s Hill when the
sun was sinking to rest. His own words would, doubtless, have
recurred to him :
“ And now on every side the surface breaks,
Into blue spots and slowly lengthening streaks,
Here plots of sparkling water tremble bright
With thousand thousand points of light.”
It was truly a sight to be remembered, and yet it is repeated
almost every evening.
As the golden orb of light was preparing to depart behind
the hills its ambient rays shot across the calm surface of the
broad stream which a second before presented the appearance
of a lake of quicksilver, and was now overspread with a purple
glow, the snow-white clouds were also tinged with gold at the
same time reflecting in the window of the villas along the
banks, the foliage, too, bathed in ruby splendor, seemed to bend
trembling down as it were to kiss the slumbering and peaceful
stream. The green patches of cultivation on Carr’s Island
stood out like opalite gems relieved by the white farm houses
rising out of the fo’iage, not the sombre shade of green usually
seen, but that “glad bright green” of which Chaucer speaks.
Then behind this, the long blue line of the New England
Ranges formed a background. To the left, South Grafton,
the valley or river flat stretched out in one wide wave
of green pasturage. To the right of us, the river could be




traced for miles with farm houses and valleys covered with the
golden corn. In front, the city, which completed a picture
it would indeed be difficult to excel.
And this was only one aspect, for as soon as the great Sun-
god gave his parting salute, we saw the river again under the
mellow effects of twilight.
And, again, at night*
“ When evening's dusky car,
Crowned with her dewy star,
Steals o’er the fading sky in shadowy flight.”
the scene is a peaceful one. Then the lights dance upon the
river, the ferry boat “ Una,” crowded with passengers, plies
across the stream. The song of oarsmen out for an evening’s
spin, steals upon the ear, and for the nonce one might easily
imagine himself in beautiful Venice.
But before going any further let me give you a brief
description of
THE QUEEN CITY OF THE NORTH.
To begin with Grafton, that is north and south, has the
finest growth of trees in streets and gardens, public and private,
than that possessed by any other town in Australia. The
reason of this is not far to seek. The town has been built on
the rich alluvial river flats, thousands of acres being taken up
in this wise, by buildings alone which, although the trees pro-
vide refreshing shade, is somewhat of a pity, for the town
might have been built further up the river out of flood reach,
and the thousands of acres mentioned would have been utilised
for farms and thus add to the wealth of the place. However,
be that as it may, the visitor reaps the advantage of this want
of foresight, for the streets and houses are fairly embowered in
foliage, Victoria Street especially being a veritable avenue, and
in October and November especially, when the jacaranda, or to
give the proper botanical name (th e jacaranda mimoscefolia ) is in
full bloom, the purple clusters alternating and mingling with
the various shades of green of the camphor laurels, silky oaks,
cedars, palm trees, the bunya-bunyas, Moreton Bay Figs and
several other beautiful shade trees, give the town a bright and
glorious appearance.
THE STREETS AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
Commencing with Howard’s Crown Hotel, one of the
best hotels in Grafton, and proceeding down Prince-street, you
have the Town Hall and the Examiner Office on your
with the School of Arts on the corner. Then come the Banks
of New South Wales and A J.S., occupying corners. Further
down, too, is the Commercial Bank. Ad these are very fine
structures, our illustrations of which are presentation pictures
by the respective bank managers, Mr. E. Elworthy (AJ.S),
Mr. E. C. Lewington (N.S.W), and Mr. E. T Blaxland
(Commercial). Then, on the opposite side of the street is
Mrs. B. Duggan’s Lion Hotel and The Grip newspaper office.
Illustration shows Schaeffer’s extensive business premises.
Continuing down the street, you come to F. Dean’s, who is
keeping pace with the progress of the town by building new
premises. Then further down is Gerard & Co’s great new
stores, and a little further on Fisher Park, besides which in
the main street is a double row of bunyas.
The cross streets, too, are graced with some very fine
structures, illustrations of which are given, but it is from the
prolific growth of the tree and plant and flower that these
streets derive their chief beauty. I have certainly never seen
anything finer. Sturt-street, of Ballarat, has double rows of
trees in the centre of the street, with seats underneath, but
they do not afford anything like the shade of the Grafton trees.
As in Ballarat, so it is here in regard to the private gardens.
Nearly every house has a garden in front or back; in fact, it
is a chain of unconnected gardens.
A RAMBLE AROUND
Sometimes I drove, and sometimes I strolled around, and
the fact just mentioned is borne out on every side.
Proceed up Victoria-street ; even the public buildings are
almost lost in foliage. Further up a calm and peaceful appear-
ance is given to the ecclesiastical structures. Proceed down




the other end of the street, and you find very handsome resi-
dences, while beautiful glimpses of the river are got at every
Opening. Even the Grafton Hospital is erected in a beautiful
spot, and has very fine gardens and grounds attached
Go where you will, there is a rural charm about Grafton
which is unsurpassed.
In the spring time, when the annual blossoming of
Aaron’s Rod (as Longfellow puts it) comes around, all is a g'ow
of colour in the gardens. The gorse hedges are a blaze of
Persian ye'low, the verandahs of the houses are embroidered
with c’oth of god, yellow Banksias, and other be.utiful
varieties of roses.
As you drive or walk about the air is redolent with the
subtle fragrance of lilac and wallflower, reminding one, indeed,
of the rural homes of England. A little later on an 1 the
orchards are a mass of white blossoms.
THE HUM OF BUSY LIFE IN THE STREETS.
I have endeavoured to show that the prosperity of
the Clarence has brought about competition, and the exi-
gencies of the times require everything up-to-date. In conse-
quence, you see Grafton’s streets graced with well-dressed
people. This fact is noticeable everywhere. At the Public
school I found 700 well and cleanl) dressed and merry-looking
children, with no trace of trouble on their happy faces.
The ladies are fashionably dressed, anti trip along
smi ingly, and although, as St. Evremond says: “Ce n’est pas
etve lien aise que de rive ” (laughing is not always a proof that the
mind is at ease), still I think the smile of the Grafton ladies does
not hde breaking hearts. They are a prosperous and a happy
people, an l as the climate, too, has something to do with this,
you will find the girls here able :o hold their own in good looks
with any part of the colony.
On Saturday nights the streets are thronged, the shops
are well lighted, and thus you see in the establishments of
J. T. ,\lcKittrick, South Grafton, Gerard & Go., F. Dean,
and E Francis crowded with people, making purchases, and
On all sides are signs of activity.
THE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.
As I am dealing with South Grafton under a separate
heading, I will now cpnfine myself to the North side. First
and foremost you have the Hospital, an extensive establish-
ment, beautifully situated on the outskirts of the town, which
is almost enveloped in trees, a necessary adjunct to an insti-
tution of this kind as well as to a town itself, which accounts for
the Grafton people being so healthy looking, the trees taking in
and giving off the oxygen requisite for health. Last year 649
patients were treated— 252 in-patients and 379 out-patients.
There are 22 beds. Mr. G. H. Varley is the Chairman of the
< ommittee, Mr. F. Doberer, Treasurer, and Mr. T. Page,
Secretary. Miss Coughlan is the matron, and has five nurses
assisting her. Most of the patients come from outside the
district.
Her Majesty's District Gaol, a great square pile which can
be seen from any eminence outside the city, is not far from
the hospital. Mr. Jay is the governor. ■
The Benevolent Asylum, which is doing splendid work,
is also adjacent, and is a nice-looking structure and well
appointed. Mr. See is President, and Mr. A. Lipman,
Secretary, of this Institution.
Amongst the institutions none is more important than an
Agricultural Society in a farming district. The C. P. and A.
Society, through the medium of their Annual Exhibition,
which is one of the great events of the year, has done a good
deal in increasing and perfecting the number of products in
the district, and in developing agricultural, pastoral, and
horticultural pursuits, and in en ightening the producers
generally. Mr. A. Eggins is the president and Mr. J. C.
Wilcox secretary. Amongst our illustrations is one of the
Exhibition Buildings.
The Chamber of Commerce, too, is an institution which
does the most useful work, and is a sine qua non in forwarding
the interests of a town. Ihe Grafton Chamber of Commerce
is no exception to the rule, and is a five body As I have
shown, the importance of the Clarence has not been in the
past brought prominently before the people of the colony.


“By the sun-kissed, the beautiful river,
Where I roamed in the glad days of old.” —Marion Miller.


Things have now changed, and the members of this body, as
shown in the recent railway enquiry, are determined that no
stone shall be left unturned to advance the interests of the
district. Mr. G. Pl. Varley is the President, and Mr. T. Page
Vice-President.
An institution which deserves mention is the Water
Brigade, which useful body is in existence in North and South
Grafton, and at times of flood they do splendid work, being a
picked lot, and physically and otherwise reflecting the greatest
credit on the Clarence
fIUNICIPAL HATTERS.
Grafton was incorporated in 1859, the first Mayor being Mr.
J. E. Chapman, and he had with him as Aldermen—Messrs. J.
Ives, K. Payne, S. Avery, and A. Lardner, to the latter of whom I
have made reference in speaking of the past history of Grafton.
Mr. Jas. Page, father of Mr. Thomas Page, was the first Council
Clerk.
Now the Borough of Grafton consists 01 n Aldermen and
Mayor, Mr. Samuel See being recently elected to the chair, in
succession to Mr. D. Beatson. The Aldermen are—Messrs. A.
W. Selmans, J. Carson, T. Shore, T. T. Bawden, C. Page, D
Beatson, P. Kritsch, E. Johnson, H. Maxted, D. M'Farlane, and
A. Eggims, with Mr. W. Small, jun., as Council Clerk. The
value of the rateable property in the borough is ;
number of houses, 900; and 56 miles of streets.
GRAFTON’S NEWSPAPERS.
Newspapers, it cannot be gainsaid, exert a wonderful influence
on a community, and are powerful instruments for the well-being
of a people, and it is a good augury for the prosperity of a town
when it can support four newspapers. The Clarence and
Richmond Examiner , however, is the leading paper, and
circulates extensively over the whole of the Clarence, and even on
the Richmond and other rivers. The quality and size of the
paper are so well known that it is unnecessary to say anything
more, except that the office is the best I have seen in any country
town. But I might mention that Mr. G. H. Varley, the pro-
prietor, is one of the best townsmen I have come across. He
takes the keenest interest in the progress of the Clarence, and a
justifiable pride in its future. This is backed up by a most
extensive knowledge of the resources of the district, and his
evidence at the inquiry into the proposed Grafton-Casino
Railway was the most valuable given. Mr. Varley has succeeded
in the newspaper business, and is on the road to be amongst
Grafton’s wealthiest citizens.
The Grafton Argus, published twice a week, and sold at 2d.
a copy, was established in 1874, and has a good circulation, being
well got up, and smartly edited by its proprietor, Mr. Alex. Grey.
The Grip, the office of which we show in our illustration,
is a very popular and up-to-date paper, and is issued twice a week.
It was established in 1888. Miss S. Penrose is the proprietress,
and the paper is well edited ; it has a wide circulation ; and the
same may be said of the Clarion , whose proprietor, Mr. W. G.
Hawthorne, is one of the most popular men on the river.
EDUCATIONAL AND OTHERWISE.
Grafton is well provided with schools. The Public School,
at North Grafton, has an . attendance of over 700, the South
new school is also largely attended ; and the same may be said
of the Convent schools.
There is a fine School of Arts, or Mechanics’ Institute, as it
is called. The Ven. Archdeacon Moxon, a gentleman of a wide
range of reading, is President; and Mr. H. Harding, who works
hard for the institution, is Treasurer. They have spacious and
comfortable reading rooms, and an extensive library to select
from, with chess and other rooms.
The Debating Club is also a great auxiliary in the matter ot
education, and has a large number of members, who take a
lively interest in the debates and proceedings generally, and the
public also manifest the greatest interest in the affair. Dr
Henry is the President, and Mr. Johnson Secretary.




CRAIG’S STORY VERIFIED.
Craig’s story as to the wealth of timber was found fully
verified, and the success of the two parties on the river created
considerable interest in Sydney, with the result that a party of
gentlemen under the leadership of Captain Percy, chartered
the steamer “ King William,” and visited the river in August,
1839. Included in this party were representatives of the
Mylne family, the Ogilvies, Dr. Dobie, and Grose’s, all names
associated with the early history of the Clarence, and standing
out prominently as pioneers of the district. So impressed
were they with its productiveness that after completing their
arrangements in Sydney each of these families settled m the
district.
Prior to this, in 1836, Mr. Small brought a few head of
cattle to the river, and subsequently Mr. Girard took up an
area of land at Waterview, this being the first land legally
occupied on the river, other than that held under timber
licences.
THE PRESENT SITE OF GRAFTON.
The present site of Grafton was fixed upon as “The
Settlement,” and known by that name for a long period. The
only store was erected on the site of the present Steam Ferry
Hotel, but as knowledge of the river spread other settlers
visited the district, and before many years the settlement was
on a firm basis.
HOW THE RIVER GOT ITS NAME.
The naming of the Clarence is veiled in considerable
doubt. By some it is held that Captain Perry named the
river on the occasion of his visit, while others contend that it
was Captain Rous who gave the river its name. It is more
than probable that the latter version is correct. Governor
Fitzroy gave the name of Grafton to the settlement.
Originally the district was considered a sheep-grazing
country, and Captain Grose selected what is known as Cop-
manhurst, to which, on January Ist, 1840, he brought
The First Mob of 8000 Sheep.
After some years it was found that the district was more
adapted for cattle raising, and to this end the settlers devoted
their attention. The descriptive accounts of the various
stations will give a very fair knowledge of the early settlement
of the district.
A SKETCH IN BLACK AND WHITE.
Different versions are given as to relations existing
between the aboriginals and the white population in the early
settlement of the river. Grim stories are told of desperate
fighting between the whites and their dusky opponents, and if
some of the stories are true the facts do not redound to the
credit of a great many of the early settlers, and form a dark
spot in the history of the Past
Could Get a Dead Black for the Carrying Away.
As far as I could glean very little value was placed upon
the life of an aboriginal, and I was informed that parties were
sometimes formed, and under the pretence that the aboriginals
were guilty of treachery or the robbery of provisions, shot
them for sport.
Men, Women, and Children Shot.
As an instance of how the blacks were summarily dealt
with for what would hardly now be deemed ample justification,
let the following speak for itself: —ln the “ forties, flour was
a very valuable commodity, prices ranging from to /100
per ton, so that in the minds of the whites to steal flour was
considered a very grievous offence; and it is said that the
blacks being taught its uses, were ever on the alert to secure
some of it. A shepherd’s hut had been robbed and it was re-
solved, so the story goes, to teach the blacks a lesson, and a
large party was made up to punish them. They were found
on the banks of the Clarence in great numbers, and during
the night the whites formed a cordon around the camp. At a
given signal at daybreak the camp was rushed, and to the
shame of those concerned, men, women, and children were




shot down indiscriminately. The result was that almost the
whole tribe was exterminated. Ultimately it was found that
the robbery had not been committed by the blacks at all, but
by a hut-keeper.
On another occasion, in a different locality, flour dosed
with arsenic was left in a convenient place for the blacks to
obtain ; this they did and many were poisoned.
Thus the stories run ; as to the truth or otherwise of the
yarns I will not pass an opinion. But if true, then it is to be
hoped that the brutality, and ghastliness, and horror of their
diabolical work came home in after years to those who com-
mitted such deeds.
PAST PARLIAMENTARY REPRESENTATIVES.
Politically the Clarence was first associated with the
district of the Darling Downs, and in 1851 the district returned
its first member to the Legislative Assembly, in conjunction
with the Darling Downs. Mr. Arthur Hodgson was the first
member, then Mr. T H. Hood. Mr. Hood was succeeded by
Clark Irving, who was also elected for the Clarence and Rich-
mond district in 1858, when the old electorate was divided,
and was the first member elected under responsible govern-
ment.
Since that date the Clarence has had among its represen-
tatives the late Sir John Robertson, the late Thomas Bawden
(to whom the district is indebted for leaving a concise history
of its sett ement, and from which these notes are principally
culled), the late Mr. J C. Laycock, and its present member,
the Hon. John See. Of Sir John Robertson a characteristic
incident is told. He was contesting the election at Grafton,
and based his claim to the electors’ votes on his superior skill
over “Jimmy Martin ” in running in a wild bullock, riding a
buckjumper, driving a team of bullocks, and milking a cow.
THOSE WHO GO DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS.
The maritime history of the Clarence dates back to the
year 1849 or 1850, when, it is stated, the “Phoenix” was the first
steamer to occupy a berth at the present I.S.N. wharf. But a
good deal of the early history is vague, and the correctness or
otherwise of this assertion is not definitely settled. We might,
however, here furnish a little glimpse of the past, and could
not do better than give an extract from an article which
appeared in the Australian Star , from the pen of “J. M I C.,”
some time ago :—“The river steamer, the “Sophia Jane,” was
condemned in 1845, and the late Mr. Edye Manning gave the
order to Mr. Chowne, of Pyrmont, to build the “ Phoenix.” in
which the “ Sophia Jane’s ” engines were to be placed. It was
intended to run the new steamer in opposition to the H.R.S.N.
Co.’s boats, in the Hunter River trade. The career of the
Phoenix on the Hunter was a short one, and she was placed in
the Clarence River trade. The Phoenix was afterwards
wrecked, as stated, on the Clarence Bar about 1850, and
Captain Wiseman was empowered to go to Sydney to have a
ship specially built, to be named the “Clarence,” for the Clarence
River trade. The cost of the vessel was For a
short time she ran to the Hunter, but as an enticing offer was
made for her. she was sold to Tasmanian people for
Certain it is, however, that a company was formed in 1865
to establish steam communication between the Clarence River
and the metropolis. This was after the rush of farmers from
the Hunter river and the South Coast, and agriculture be-
coming the chief industry, trade increased by leaps and bounds,
with the result that a company was formed to cope with the
volume of business The Grafton Steamship Co. was there-
fore formed, with the following board of directors : —Messrs.
F. Mitchell (chairman), Clark Irving, Joseph Sharp, and R.
Kirchner.
The “Grafton,” a paddle steamer of 297 tons register, and
548 tons gross, was the first to fly the Company’s flag. The
“Grafton” has since been wrecked. The “Fernella,”
of 200 tons, was the second of the fleet. The trade
increasing, an iron paddle steamer, the “ Urara,” of 350 tons
register, was purchased. She was a ten-knot boat, and one of
the best boats trading to Sydney at the time. She was lost at
the Clarence Heads.
The “ Urara ” was followed by the “ Agnes Irving ” of the

sameregister. Captain H. Creer, then well-known in the service
of the H.R.N.S. H. Conjoined the new company, and was sent
home to get a steamer built to eclipse anything on the Aus-
tralian coast. The “ City of Grafton” was the result. She is a
handsome iron for-and-aft schooner-rigged paddle steamer, of
555 tons register, and 825 tons gross Steamship communica-
tion was opened up on the Richmond and Macleay, but I will
not deal with this at the present juncture. We now come to
the “Kallatina,” the commodore ship of the line, Captain Creer
having been again despatched home to get a ship built which
would be able to compete with anything going. The “ Kalla-
tina ” was built under the orders of Captain Creer,
and a magnificently appointed steamer was the outcome of
his trip. When His Excellency Lord Jersey and suite paid
their vice-regal visit to Grafton they were loud in their praises
of the comforts on board, and the handsome appointments and
furnishings which make her the gem of the north. The dimen-
sions of the steamer are:—Length, between perpendiculars,
179 feet ; beam, moulded, 28 feet; depth of hold from main
deck, 11 feet 6 inches. She has a long full poop extending to
the forward hatch, with a forecastle in which the crew are
housed The saloon, in which there are berths for 40 passen-
gers, is situated amidships. The dining saloon and state
berths are on the main deck, and are beautifully finished in
polished woods, which are set off to advantage with velvet
furnishings All the modern folding lavatories and con-
veniences for passengers are there, and the ship is thoroughly
ventilated. The vessel is installed throughout with electric
light. An awning and promenade deck are fitted over the
’midships' deck-house.
Nipper & See’s Line of Steamers.
This company having, on account of the increased trade
in produce, entered into the steam navigation business, we
find their first vessel was a ketch, named the “ Comet,” which
traded in the sixties to Wollongong and Shoalhaven. They
afterwards purchased the “ Alpha ” for the Macleay and other
rivers. Then they obtained the “Adieu,” the barque “Adelhid,”
and the brig “ Fairy Queen.” The latter vessel conveyed the
first cargo of wheat from Port Pirie to Sydney. This brig
was afterwards wrecked at Timaru Bay. The “ Adelhid ” cap-
sized off Sydney Heads en route from Melbourne to Newcastle,
and all hands were drowned.
Nipper & See commenced business in Sydney in 1865, and
in 1870 opened a branch in Melbourne. They also had
branches or agencies in all parts of the colonies, and to show
the extent of business transacted, we might state that their
operations in Sydney in one year alone amounted to
The partnership of Nipper & See was dissolved in 1884,
and John See & Co.'s line then comprised the steamers “ Aus-
tralian,” “ Helen Nicholl,’' “Rosedale,’ and “ Murray,” and the
barque “Zohrab.” The business of John See & Co. increased,
and embraced lines of steamers from Sydney to the Clarence,
Hastings, Bellinger, Nambucca, Port Macquarie, Woolgoolga,
and Coff’s Harbour. In addition were numerous droghers and
tugs as feeders to the ocean steamers.
The North Coast Steam Navigation Co.
I now come to the point when the amalgamation was
effected between the Clarence, Macleay, and Richmond River
Co. and John See & Co., under the above title The following
steamers are employed by this company : —“ Kallatina,” “ City
of Grafton,” “ Tomki,” “ Macleay,” “ Coraki,” “Burrawong,”
“ Electra,” “Helen Nicoll,” “Rosedale,” “Australian,”
“Wellington,” “ Wyrallah,” besides numerous droghers.
It is certainly a fine sight to see these noble steamers
careering along the placid waters of the Clarence, and
taken in conjunction with the river boats, the waterway
at Grafton presents a most animated appearance. I
forget how many miles of navigable stream there are on the
Clarence, but there are 99 islands ; they have not yet found
the hundredth, I would have made it a hundred, but I do
not believe in imperilling my immortal soul for one island.
There is, therefore, every facility provided for tourists and
others to proceed to the northern rivers, and as we are dealing
with the Clarence from a picturesque standpoint, we can assure
visitors that not only will they find every comfort on board the
North Coast steamers, the officers and assistants attentive

sweep and sway,” and the lawns are covered with the greenest
of mantles.
THE DOMAIN OF SPORT.
The Clarence River Jockey Club is the principal racing
club They give £SOO in prize money at the next annual
meeting. The Hon. T. H. Smith is the president. There are
two or three other Clubs on the Clarence, and there are a
number of Pony Clubs.
Grafton has two splendid rowing clubs, namely, North
Grafton and South Grafton. Each club has its own sheds,
and have splendid fleets.
McLean has also a good rowing club, and it may be men-
tioned that the Clarence has produced some of the best oars-
men in the colony namely, H Searle (alluded to elsewhere),
M. Rush, Elias Laycock, and others. Grafton holds an
annual regatta, in which the leading rowers of the colony
compete, and the river certainly presents a gay appearance on
such occasions.
Cricket is one of the chief amusements of the Clarence,
young and old being very keen on this pastime. There are
numerous clubs, and they can produce a combination here
which can hold its own against most of the metropolitan teams.
There are also a number of football clubs in the season,
ON SUMMER NIGHTS.
On the hot summer nights the Graftonites take the fullest
advantage of their river, and the fine steam ferry “Una” is well
taxed for space, although she holds 500 passengers. But there
is always a delightful breeze on the water, and when the close
atmosphere drives the people out of their houses they can
always take a trip to and fro
MUSIC IN GRAFTON.
The bands in Grafton frequently come out to enliven the
town with their strains. They have two bands, the City and the
Grafton Brass Band, and they come out on to the Boulevards
and other places in the evening and discourse the sweetest of
music which is carried over the water, and floats on the per-
fume-laden air.
There is also a Philharmonic Society, numbering about
ioo members, who give the people a treat at various times
during the year.
THE MATERIAL PROGRESS OF THE CLARENCE.
Those of the old pioneers who are still alive must jub
their eyes as if waking from a dream, when they behold the
vast change which has taken place in such a short period of
their lives. What a transition from that misty past when the
swarthy aborigine had full possession of the river and its lands,
“ a monarch of all he surveyed.” And to what is this change
due? To the beneficence of Nature in the first place. After
Craig, the convict, had discovered that there were rich tracts of
land, and settlement had begun, the discovery brought enter-
prising farmers and graziers up from the Hunter and other
places. The rich forests of cedar were also made use of by
adventurous men, and as a pound, and sometimes two pounds-
a hundred was paid for the cedar, thousands of pounds were in
circulation. Nothing succeeds like success, industrial activity
is stimulated thereby, and new enterprises are engaged in ; the
development of a place which in older lands took centuries to
accomplish, proceeds here with rapid footsteps.
SQUATTING. MINING, & SUGAR= GROWING.
Squattages were taken up, gold was discovered, and mines
developed, and soon the rich lands of the river were put under
cane, and commerce increasing, wealth-making went on apace.
Then as competition increased, the weak went to the wall, and
the strong forged ahead.
The prosperity of a place depends largely upon its public
men, and these are the business men. The possession of
wealth is the criterion by which we judge men of business,
and when this is won by perseverance and energy and indomi-
table pluck, the men who accomplish this exert great influence




over others by their force of character, and in building up their
own prosperity help to build up that of a whole community.
Such a man as J. T. McKittrick, for instance, who has done
all this, and has now one of the most successful and colossal
businesses on the northern rivers His business extends over
a hundred miles radius ; boats carry away his merchandise on
the water, with carriers going out in all directions on the land.
In the same manner there is the enterprising firm of Henry
Gerard & Co, who have a river boat, and in our illustration
we show that from small beginnings great things grow. Any-
one strolling into the Clarence River stores on a Saturday night
would be astounded at the volume of business done, the
crowds of people, and the expedition with which the numerous
assistants get through with their work. I say it is the enter-
prise and business acumen of men such as these who create a
healthy emulation and make a place progress.
THE BUSINESS DONE IN REAL ESTATE.
Another important factor in the progress of a town and
-district is the great business done in real estate When we
see men becoming successful and prosperous such as J. H.
Munro, the firm of Maurice, Beatson & Johnson, W. Small,T. T
Bawden, and W. J. Hawthorne—all auctioneers —we feel that
a district is also prospering, for we know that when a large
number of freeholds are put into their hands to look after, that
there is wealth behind them.
In a community like the Clarence wealth does not consist
of bullion in the banks as would obtain in all settled countries,
but thousands, aye millions of pounds, go into property and
the improvement of property, and is represented by magni-
ficent piles of buildings, in the acquirement and improvement
of farms.
And to keep pace with the high degree of civilization
attained, the smartest men come to the fore ; the people de-
mand the best of everything, the highest perfection in dentis-
try, the highest musical talent, and thus we have Sydney’s
leading music warehouse, establishing a branch in the main
street, where the grand pianos, down to the humble mouth
organ can be obtained. The inimitable Mr. Gooch is in
charge of the branch. Further down, too, is Mr. Henry Jordan’s
musical establishment, replete with all kiuds of musical instru-
ments, pianos, organs, &c.




THE LUNGS OF THE CITY.
RECREATION GROUNDS AND PICNIC RESORTS.
It is said that the surroundings of a people re-act on their
nature and form their characters accordingly. If such be the
case, and in my experience it is so, then the Clarenceites should
be an artistic and a pleasure-loving people—and indeed they
are ; and consequently they have numerous parks and pleasure
resorts
First of all comes Fisher Park, the pride of the Grafton
people. The park, which is most conveniently situated, is
entered by pillar gates of massive proportions, is beautifully
appointed and laid out, and is- most compact. The cricket
oval with a neat white fence, the pavilion and band
rotunda, make this part most attractive, and on Wednesday
and Saturday afternoons in the cricket season, presents a most
animated appearance Then further on is the enclosed portion
devoted to the flowers and landscape gardening, and although
not long in existence, the parterres tapestried with flowers,
the velvet lawns, the caretaker’s pretty residence, all combine
to make this portion a favorite resort.
Then there is Susan Island, one of the favorite resorts.
The ferry boat “Una” goes over every hour bearing crowds of
old and young. For fourpence a week you can go backward
and forward all day long. It is not only delightfully cool over
here in the summer time, but there are hundreds of the most
charming little spots here, for the utilitarian philosopher has
not yet laid his destroying hand on nature’s gifts to a grateful
people who avail themselves very much of this sylvan nook.
Numerous picnic parties assemble on the south side to go
out to the various resorts. In fact, for an inland town I do
not think there is another place in Australia where so much
picnicking is done. The people here love the open air and the
outdoor life, and they have all the means at hand of reaching
the most beautiful spots at a very small outlay.
Bawden Bridge is perhaps the favorite resort, for here is
everything that the heart of the picnicker can desire. Lovely
scenery and delightful and secluded lift e nooks, where sweet-
hearts may get away secure from the ru !e gaze of the heart ess
crowd.
“But the river never minding,
Still is winding, still is winding.”
Then there is Coutts’ Crossing, about nine miles away
on the Armidale Road, which is an ideal place for a picnic—
velvet lawns, great shade trees, and enchanting river scenery.
Chambigne is another delightful place which is visited a
good deal. This is about 14 miles out on the Glen Innes read,
and although a fair distance out, the visitor is well repaid for
his trouble, for here he will find quite an avenue of palms, and
the bangalows are really very beautiful. Indeed, there is no
end to the charms of this place. Here you can not only con-
template the beauties of nature, but can sit and listen to the
song of birds mingled with the murmur of the brook, or hear—
to quote Marion Miller—
“ Far away the lyre bird’s call,
Splash of a distant waterfall.”
Another resort is Glenugie Peak, out Woolgoolga way.
Although it is a task to ascend it, still when you reach the top
you get the finest panorama of the district which it is
possible to obtain. The hill rises out up above the smaller
ridges and we get an uninterrupted view of the surroundings.
“ Hills peep o’er hills,
And Alps o’er Alps arise.”
The Clarence and Glenugie Peaks, I may mention, can be seen
from almost any part of the. Clarence River.
Moleville is still another place of resort.
Elizabeth Island, too, within a stone's throw of the city,
where sports are usually held, is without a doubt (surrounded
as it is by the river) one of the loveliest recreation grounds I
have come across. It almost seems a pity to have erected
pavilions here, and to have large crowds apparently tramping
everything down At least it would seem so, but there is no
need of fear on that score, the growth of tree and flower is so
prolific here that nothing can keep it d.rwn, and bananas wave
their fan-like leaves amongst the bush, while the “ reed beds


“By sports like these are all their cares beguiled,
The sports of children satisfy the child.”— Goldsmith.






and obliging, the catering excellent, and the fares are
very reasonable, being only 30/- saloon single, and £2 10s.
return. I may state that I came down through the Richmond
and Clarence, and after spending six weeks on the Clarence
took steamer to Sydney by the ‘‘City of Grafton.’’ This is
probably the most successful vessel on the rivers. The same
engines and boilers are still used, having never been replaced,
and the steamer has only had one little mishap. Captain
Slater is the skipper, and all the officers were most obliging.
The ‘ City ” has a fine deck promenade.
Mr. T. R Allt is the chairman of Directors, having first
been incorporated with the North Coast shipping in 1862
Messrs. A lit and J See are managing directors, assisted by
Messrs G. Elliott, W. Watt, Samuel Dickenson, and Captain
Lyons; the capital of the Company now being in
150,000 shares of £1 each. Mr. R. Cook, who has been con-
nected with the company from a youth, and consequently has
the interests of the company at heart, besides being a most
capable and enthusiastic worker, is well known by travellers
and traders, and receives high encomiums from them for his
attention to their comforts, and his personal courtesy and
geniality; and he is ably assisted by Mr A. Allen, who for
some years was manager for John See & Co. The Grafton
branch is successfully managed by Mr. S. See.
FISHER PARK AND RECREATION GROUND.




South Grafton.
T course, there is a little friendly rivalry between
the North and South Graftonites. The latter
claim that if it was not for the rich lands and
farmers on their side the North Graftonites
would not be able to live, but they also look for-
1 ward to the time when South Grafton is going to
be the town —meaning, of course, when the railway is extended
from Glen Innes to the Clarence. But there is, in fact, no
division between the North and South. The people, I think,
should simply regard the river as a thoroughfare, indeed as the
main street —occupying the same position as the water does in
Venice for, I can assure readers, the river presents a busy
appearance all day long and well into the night, the ferry boat,
the “ Una” conveying passengers at intervals of ten minutes.
THE STREETS AND BUILDINGS.
The principal thoroughfare on the south side was originally
Wharf Street, but the business has now shifted into Skinner
Street, where Mr. J. T. McKittrick’s magnificent new two-storey
premises just completed, present a grand appearance. This is
certainly a mammoth establishment, but of course I cannot
enter into a description here, suffice it to say, that our illustra-
tion shows the outside of the building and the interior is most
elaborately appointed. The whole place, too, is installed with
electric light and the cash railway system. In fact everything
is up-to-date and in metropolitan style.
THE 01 HER BUILDINGS.
The Post Office and School of Arts, of which illustrations
are given, are good buildings, and South Grafton is rapidly
growing. On the outskirts, private residences are going up
in all directions. The two hotels represented by our illustra-
tions, Mr. Cowan’s and Mrs. Walker’s, do an excellent busi-
ness and are very comfortable places to stay at, and South
Grafton is not going to be behind in fashion for she has one of
the leading tailoring establishments in Mr. Zietsch’s, an illus-
tration of whose fine place we gave in North Grafton sketches.
A Stroll Around.
I have, of course, already mentioned the magnificent view
which can be obtained from Wilson’s Hill, and a stroll around
reveals the fact that the South Side is not lacking in pic-
turesqueness. Two of our illustrations are of Alipou Creek
and one could hardly believe that such enchanting spots existed
so close to the town and yet are so rarely visited. Here, as
Fletcher sings, you have
“ Fountain heads and pathless groves
Places which pale passion loves.”
So close to the town and yet far away from the haunts of men,
there you can sit in “ cool grot ” and listen to the murmur of
the trickling water, and be at peace with all the world.
Old Wharf Street, which I mentioned, is more like an
avenue in a park than a street. There are two rows of beautiful
camphor laurels, so thick and umbrageous that they almost
meet.
The Recreation Grounds here are also well appointed and
from this side nearly all the pleasure resorts are approached.
At the back of the town is the Public School, to the private
portion of which the head teacher has made a beautiful garden.
Further out Mr. J. T. McKittrick has a delightful residence
with a nice garden attached.
Altogether the South Side, even taken as a town itself,
can hold its own with most places.




THE INDUSTRIES OF THE CLARENCE.
Rapid Strides in Dairying.
The Fresh Food and Ice Company.
No other industry on the Clarence shows such rapid and
remarkable progress as that of dairying, nor one which will be
such a potent factor in building up the prosperity of the future.
This was conclusively shown in Mr. Varley s evidence during
the recent inquiry into the merits of the proposed Grafton-
Casino railway.
In going back a few years I find in 1896 tons of
butter were manufactured, and the following year this had
increased to 476 tons ; in 1898 to 649 tons; and last year the
output was 755! tons, which at £93 4s. per ton gives a value
of £70,536, this being an increase of about £20,000 on the pre-
ceding year.
Some More Comparisons.
In 1892 Ulmarra started the first butter factory on the
Clarence with only 40 suppliers, and the output was small.
In 1893 they treated 194,000 gallons and made 64,800 lbs. of
butter. In 1899 there were 150 suppliers, about 5000 cows,
and they made 222 tons of butter, an increase of over £20,000
worth.
The Grafton Dairy Co. was the next to start, and just after
a flood, with very small supply in 1895 they made 55,898 lbs.
of butter; in 1899 it bad increased to 182,302 lbs.
In the district there are 2 central factories, the Fresh
Food and Ice Co. and Ulmarra, 7 co-operative dairies, 14
creameries, and between 35 and 40 private suppliers.
Ulmarra Company has recently erected three creameries,
one each at Cowper, Coldstream, and Swan Creek.
There are co-operative factories at Ulmarra, Grafton,
Southampton, Brushgrove, Palmer’s Island, Southgate, and
Lower Southgate.
The Fresh Food and Ice Co. have creameries at Lawrence,
Whiteman, Coutts’ Crossing, Chatsworth, Lavadia, Copman-
hurst, South Arm, Coldstream, and Swan Creek. About 30
private separators supply them with cream, and about 10
others. Milk and cream supplied the Fresh Food and Ice Co.
come from a radius of over 40 miles to the S.W., 30 miles to
the N.E., 25 miles West, and 35 miles East.
The N.S.W. Fresh Food and Ice Co., Ltd.,
A photo, of whose extensive establishment we give in this Brochure.
Here everything is most interesting and instructive, and
outsiders—and even Grafton people—have little idea of the
magnitude of the work going on. The factory itself goes back
about 120 feet, and is 40 feet high. Most of the cream from 5
co-operative creameries is hauled by an endless chain up the
cream-room at the rate of 80 cans per hour. Everything in
the manipulation is as near automatic as possible. The churn-
room itself is fitted up with 4 of Evenden’s lightning churns
with cold water connections into each When churned, the
butter is run into an iron pot and lifted by means of an IXL
ejector to a receiving tank outside the building. The water
for churning purposes is cooled by a Lawrence cooler at the
rate of 800 gallons per hour. The output of butter is now
about 18 tons per week. The factory is installed throughout
with electric light, which was fitted up at the opening three
years ago. All the Company’s creameries on the Clarence
are fitted up with Pasteurising plants and Alpha separators.
As it may be of interest to our readers to know how the pigs
are fixed up, I will give a brief description of what they are
doing at Musk Valley. Here 8 or 9 pigs are run into a race,
a chain is hitched on to the hind leg of a pig, he is hauled up
by a pulley, two men catch hold of each leg, the slaughterman
pops on the knife, and the pig is run on gambrels to the
scalding trough. The dead pig quickly bleeds, and is then
lowered into the water and hauled out on to a table and then
scraped, hauled up again, run into a furnace for about 20
seconds, run out again and shot into a cooling tank ; hauled
up again, skin scraped off, and finally sent on gambrels to the
cooling-rooms, then put into cloths and sent to the curing

factory; the whole process of putting through a dozen pigs
not taking more than an hour.
Altogether it is astonishing the strides this Company has
made since it was opened by Lord Hampden on the 26th
April, 1896. To show the operations of che Company, and
the good it is doing to the district, I might state that £20,000
of capital has been invested on the river, and about £65,000 is
annually distributed.
Mr. Geo. S. Stening, a young man of exceptional ability
and business acumen, manages the whole affair. Mr Stening
is a colonial, and it is pleasing to see a young Australian
placed at the head of such a big company.
RAMORNIE HEAT WORKS.
The Ramornie Meat Works were originally owned by the
Australian Meat Co., Ltd., and commenced operations in 1864,
being at the present day the oldest works in the colonies. The
making of extract of beef was begun in 1866 (within a few
months of the starting of the Liebig Co.’s Works in South
America). In 1879, Mr. C. G. Tindal, who was the founder and
principal shareholder in the original company, became sole
owner. During the years ’93, ’94, ’95, and ’96 the capacity of
the works was much increased, and electric light added. Up to
180 cattle per diem can now be canned. Nearly 20,000 head of
cattle have been killed in one year. The killing season is usually
confined to the autumn and winter months, when cattle are
cheapest and most plentiful.
Mr. Tindal, I might add, owns a wharf and extensive
premises in London, where he acts as his own agent; his sons,
Mr. C. F. Tindal and Mr. J. T. Tindal, carrying on the manufac-
turing in Australia under his instructions from London, the head
quarters of the business.
Whilst on industries, I must not omit to mention Mr. P.
Kritsch’s great coachbuilding establishment, who keeps up-to-
date and makes everything, from the humble but useful dray to
the elaborate brougham, and at a moderate cost.
WHAT THE LAND PRODUCES.
Some Remarkable Figures.
The real value of land is gauged by the value of its products,,
or, rather, by the amount of money which can be made off a
given area. With regard to the land on the Clarence, the follow-
ing figures speak for themselves.
Beginning with maize, the oldest and chief agricultural
product, I find the export for last year was 540,720 bushels ; this,
with the local consumption, would amount to 700,000 bushels,
which, at an average price of 2s. 9d. per bushel, gives a return of
£82,500. Dairy produce totalled up to £70,536, being an increase
of £20,000 (approximately) on the previous year. Potatoes,
2,100 tons exported, which, with local consumption, would bring
the yield to 3,000 tons ; this, at £2 10s. a ton, would be £ 7,500. In
1898, however, there was a better crop and better price, and this
amount totalled £ 25 000.
Now comes sugar-cane. The C.S.R. Co. last year paid
away £42,500 for cane and wages, which, with other smaller
mills, brings the amount to £50,000, distributed to cane-growers
and wage-earners on the Clarence. The coming season they
expect to pay £60,000. This does not represent the value of the
sugar manufactured, which amounts in itself to nearly £70,000.
Then there is the stock. The Stock Inspector gives the
following returns : —91,000 head of cattle in the district, an
increase of 4,000 on previous year; and it may be as well to
mention that it is calculated 60,000 of them are dairy cattle,,
milking and dry. 17,432 horses, an increase of 952; 11,836
pigs, an increase of 298. About 12,000 cattle were slaughtered,
and 9,000 shipped to Sydney. At £5 per head, this would
represent about £66,755. Ramornie Meat Works output of
tinned meats is valued at about £36,000, and for tallow, hides,
etc., about the same.
The timber industry is estimated to be worth at least
,£40,000; pigs, ,£15,000; poultry and eggs, ,£45,000; vege-
tables, £5,000; fish, ,£5.000 ; horses (324 exported), £2,000;
bark, £4OO ; or a grand total of £421,100.
There are. of course, some smaller industries ; but the above

will suffice to show the development and wealth of the district,
and the giant strides which she has been making, especially in
butter-making, and, as this industry is going to play a big part in
the future prosperity of the Clarence, I will devote a special
chapter to it.

I may mention that Grafton is the headquarters of the Land
and Survey Offices of the coast districts from the Tweed to Port
Macquarie. Mr. Ebsworth is the District Surveyor, and Mr.
A. J Park the Chairman of the Land Board.
OUT AMONGST THE FARMERS.
One of the surest methods of gauging the permanent pros-
perity of a town is to find out, in the first place, if the land is
good, and in the next —although one is a corollary on the other—
if the farmers are prosperous. That the land about Grafton is
good I have sufficiently shown • and even in the town itself, one
hundred yards from the Commercial Bank, and beside the Argtis
office, is a splendid crop of corn, and everywhere you go you will
see paddocks containing magnificent crops of maize on every side,
before getting out of the town proper.
There are some beautiful farms along the river out to
Southgate, a great many Scotchmen being here. All have got
good farms and handsome, well-built homesteads. There is not
the slightest trace of poverty amongst them. All look happy and
contented —no banks to trouble them, except when the banks of
the river overflow. Before the embankment was erected, a farmer
sometimes woke up in the morning and found his farm had
vanished. Another farmer gets up and finds himself in posses-
sion of a neighbour’s, and some of the floods actually carried
away the land, depositing it in another place. It appears to be
fair rich, sand loam. I was thinking I would like to have about
ioo acres for onion-growing.
But, anyhow, despite floods and everything else, the farmers
are rich, and have as sound a town as any place I have been at.
I had a drive all around out to Southgate —out by the Junction and
Carr’s Island, and out by South Grafton. Indeed, there was not
a place I did not visit; and there was an air of prosperity every-
where, and happiness, too, and no mortgages, no hostile tribes, as
in other countries. Here the farmer
“Can eat in safety
Under his own vine what he plants,
And sing the merry song of peace
To all his neighbours.”
MINING ON THE CLARENCE.
So far the Clarence has not proved itself a Bendigo or a
Ballarat in regard to mining, and whether it is going to do so in

the future is a matter of speculation. Up to the present there
has been no deep sinking, 2ro feet being the deepest yet sunk,
so that, so to speak, there has been nothing but surface scratch-
ing. Rich gold, however, has been obtained to that depth, and
has then petered out. But to my mind this country has not
been properly tested. The probability is that by volcanic action
the reefs have been disturbed, and if capital was available, the
reefs could be picked up again, and would, no doubt, be richer.
The number of men employed at present is 74 alluvial,
and 181 on quartz. 3084 oz. of gold have been won for the
year, valued at £15,191. The principal field in the district is
Dalmorton, on the Glen Innes road, where there is a ten-head
crushing plant
About half-a-dozen dredging leases have been taken up,
principally out Mann River way, which part of the country is
shown in our illustration.
There has been a bit of a stir in cinnabar mining, and a
Company called the '• Great Australian Quicksilver Mining Co.”
has been formed to develop this property. They are commencing
with excellent prospects, as the parcel sent down to the School of
Mines, Ballarat, assayed 60 per cent. If this company is successful,
and there appears to be little doubt but that it will be, it will give
an impetus to the development of other minerals, and the gold
mines will be tested at a depth where there is a possibility
of big things being done. Capital is the only thing needed to
unearth the riches of this gold-bearing area.
RAILWAY COnnUNICATION WITH THE CLARENCE.
In dealing with the opening-up of communication by rail
with the Clarence district, one has by necessity to go into dry
facts and figures which are not at all romantic, but in this
brochure we are bringing out not only letterpress, but illustrations,
to show, in the Upper Clarence portion particularly, that the
Grafton-Glen Innes Route
will pass through not only a most picturesque and delightful
country, but will tap extensive areas of the richest pastoral,
agricultural, and mining lands in the Colony when the North
Coast Line is entered upon and completed, which will only be a
matter of a few years at most. By this time the beauties of
Grafton’s noble river and its pleasing resorts will be known and
appreciated, tourists not wishing to come by steamer will avail
themselves of the rail, and I venture to assert that it will be one
of the most popular routes in the Colony, but to
Facts and Figures
to support the contention that the Glen Innes-Grafton proposal is
the shortest and cheapest route to navigable water for the New
England coastal railway, I need only quote the approximate
estimate at the time of writing given by Mr. T. Kennedy,
surveyor.
From Guyra to Coff's Harbour, via Don Dorrigo, 120 miles,
cost £664,500; Guyra to South Grafton, via Don Dorrigo, 171
miles, cost £1,021,500 ; Tenterfield to Lismore, via Casino,
or 1051- miles, ,£1,094,500; Tenterfield to Casino, 86 miles,
£979,000.
Glen Innes to South Grafton, via Mann River, miles,
cost £478,000.
These figures show the average of the respective lines to be
as follows :
Tenterfield to Casino, £11,383 per mile; Tenterfield to
Lismore, £10,399 5 Guyra to South Grafton, £5,973 : Guyra to
Coff’s Harbour, £5,537 ; and Glen Innes to South Grafton,
£5,112 per mile.
Of the above proposals, the Casino-Lismore section
miles) was approved of by the Public Works Committee, whilst
in 1884 a Loan Act providing for a Grafton-Glen Innes line
passed both Houses of Legislature, and received Royal assent in
November of the same year.
In connection with the Don Dorrigo route, I may mention
that a wealthy syndicate has visited this timber country, which,
I might add, is one of the finest I have seen —forests of great
cedar and other timbers, which will not give out for many
years to come. This syndicate is going to start operations in
earnest at the head of Nymboi, and will work round Don Dorrigo


“In every rank, both great and small,
’Tis industry supports us all.”— Gay.


direction. They are going to lay down a tram line to Coff’s
Harbour, and the result should not only add to the wealth of
the Clarence district, but be an important factor in getting the
proposed railway built.
THE GRAETON = CASINO ROUTE.
This portion of the proposed Coast line is 64 miles 20 chains
in length. The survey discloses the fact that the Llarence is
followed six miles from Grafton, Sportsman’s Creek is crossed at
1.6 miles, and at Loxdon Creek the main ascent of the Richmond
Range is made, with a grade of lin 60. Myall Creek is crossed
at miles, the main road at 42 )£ miles, Myrtle Creek at
45miles, Sandy Creek at miles; Deep Creek 7 miles
further on, and at miles from Grafton the South Arm of the
Richmond River is crossed by the line. The curves are for the
most part easy.
Would Open Up Good Dairying Country.
Along the proposed route on either side there are 721,000
acres of land still unalienated. Most of this land is well suited for
dairying.
A great deal of the country is spotted gum and ironbark,
and it has been conclusively proved by results that spotted gum
improves under ringbarking io a far greater degree than othei
timber country. This country when improved will carry one cow
to five acres, but, estimating that 640 acres will be sufficient (and
some say 480 acres will be ample), this will mean that at least
1,000 Families can be Settled There,
and reckoning milk at 3d. a gallon, and with the addition of pigs,
poultry, and eggs as auxiliaries, each family should make nearly
£"6oo per annum.
I do not like making comparisons, but it is sometimes con-
tended that such coastal lines as that of Sydney to Kiama do not
pay. Can anyone wonder ? Look at the difference.
The Kiama line, 7.1 miles in length, cost ;£2,186,673, and
the interest on the capital is ,£73,930, the annual loss being
about ,£30,000.
On the Grafton-Casino route there would not be any exten-
sive resumptions, and the engineers’ estimate of ,£501,000 he
admits can be considerably reduced. It is asserted by local
authorities that the line could be built at £"5,000 per mile. Now,
interest at 3 per cent, on the local estimate would amount to about
,£9,630 ; maintenance would be about .£6,388 ; or an annual cost
of .£16,018. It is estimated there will be an annual revenue
from cream freights, live stock, general merchandise, and timber
of about £"6,ooo. There would be, it is estimated, £"9,000 for
lares per annum; these together would bring in revenue amount-
ing to £(15,283, or a shortage of only £"734 between cost of
construction and maintenance. And, further, if a small royalty
of, say, 4s. per tree were put upon timber along this route, it
would return a revenue of £76,800.
Again, on the Sydney-Kiama line, as on many other lines,
they have only the one side to draw on. On the proposed Casino
route —and I cannot impress this fact too strongly on those whom
it concerns —the line must draw the traffic from about 15 miles
on the north-west side, and to miles on the east side ; there is no
other outlet. As soon as the line is built the Fresh Food and Ice
Company are prepared to plant their creameries at intervals of
10 miles out from and along the line at either side.
Here is another strong point. Land for dairying cannot be
obtained, except at high rates, in other places. It is, therefore,
reasonable to suppose it would be taken up at the Crown rate of
£T per acre. The disposal of the land would in itself
Pay the Cost of Construction.
And, again, look at the value to the State of about 600 or
1,000 families settled upon land from which hitherto little or no
revenue was obtained. Now, if I wrote for a week I could not
say more than I have done.

THE HON. JOHN SEE.
An article cn the Clarence River would be incomplete with-
out a reference to the member for the district, who has faithfully
represented the district since 1880, having been returned ten
times. Born in Huntingdonshire, England, in 1845. Mr. See
came to Australia with his parents in 1853, just about the time
when the gold fever was at an acute stage, but the family engaged
in (arming pursuits Mr. See, however, not content with the vis
inertia of rural pursuits, launched out, even as a young man of
twenty, and entered into partnership with Mr. George Nipper, of
Sydney, as produce merchants. The partnership lasted for
eighteen years, during which period the business expanded until
branches had to be opened in Tasmania, Victoria, and all parts of
New South Wales, including Grafton and other towns on the
Northern rivers. Mr. See having now assumed sole control of
the business through Mr. Nipper retiring, the shipping business
grew so great that the North Coast Steam Navigation Company,
Limited, was floated to undertake this branch, Mr. See being the
chairman of directors. In regard to Mr. See’s Parliamentary
career, he has been three times a Minister of the Crown, namely,
as Postmaster-General in the Bibbs’ short-lived Ministry of 1885,
in 1891 as Colonial Treasurer, again in the Bibbs Ministry, and
now Chief Secretary and Minister for Defence in the Lyne
Administration. As Colonial Treasurer Mr. See filled the
position with conspicious ability, his great business proclivities
and grasp of finance making him a strong man, not only in
his department, but in the Ministry. In character Mr. See
shows cool determination and doggedness in face and figure,
his broad forehead indicating great mental capacity, while
shrewdness is written in every lineament of his features. Possessing
wealth and power, the outcome of his own efforts and ability, Mr.
See has infinite confidence in himself, and feels his power, which
may give rise to the feeling that he is at times almighty and
ambitious in his bearing. But Mr. See is not a man who would
sacrifice everything for ambition, and his entrance into the
political arena has not been self-seeking and egotistic, but having
once put his hand to the plough his motto is “ Onward,’’ and
Mr. See, in his upward career, has never been known to stoop to
anything petty or mean, for his character for uprightness and
strict commercial integrity is undeniable. He is a man of action,
and the same may he said of him in the commercial and political
world as was said of Scott by Byron in a literary sense —“ Not
living upon the resource of past reputation, his foot is always
in the arena, his shield hung always in the lists.”
JOHN M‘FARLANE, M.P.
Mr. John M‘Farlane, Member for the Clarence, was born on
the Hunter, and is a splendid stamp of a native —burly and
brusque, and big-hearted, and with a jovial manner, which wins
over many friends to his side. Although not likely to set the
House on fire with his rhetoric, John M‘Farlane is a practical
man, and has stored up a great amount of useful knowledge,
which will stand to him in his position as member of the Works
Committee. Beside his many admirable social qualities, the
subject of this sketch is a man of integrity and honor, and it
is unnecessary to say more. The Member for the Clarence has
been elected five times, and so far his constituents do i.ot want
to replace him.

The Upper Clarence.
ROBABLY one of the most delightful trips the
tourist can take is up to Copmanhurst. Here the
rail Wm l° ver °f the beautiful, the sublime and the pictu-
jHP resque has everything to satisfy him. If in search
of the grand and the terrible, just before arriving at
Copmanhurst the steamer glides along beneath
overarching precipices, the frowning rocks themselves seem as if
thrown up by some Titanic battle of the gods of old, and fling
their shadows across the silent stream, which anon is bathed in
opalite splendour as the declining sun shoots her rainbow-tinted
rays athwart the rock and stream and foliage.
Then, again, when the red of the light has faded, and the
shadows lengthen and twilight steals o’er the scene, a calm feeling
takes possession of the lover of quiet and subdued effects, and he
can drink in each scene to his heart’s content. The lovely little
islets which Nature has formed, bordered and covered with every
conceivable form of bough and brush and fern, give ample
material for the artist to produce some lovely pictures.
Leaving Copmanhurst, which in itself is a difficult matter, for
the people are so good and hospitable, we again pass through
tb'-'se walls of granite, and are reminded of the lines —
“ Peak over peak, fantastic ever,
The lofty crags deep chasms sever ;
And on its side the cliffs between
Were mazy forests ever seen.”
Take then a turn up the black Orara, which inspired the
poet, Henry Kendall, to dedicate a poem to this tributary of the
Clarence.
Sailing out amongst the creeks and watercourses, the tourist
finds himself unexpectedly in a gorge, and hears the roar of
Gordon Brook Waterfall. Exploring these places, he strikes
some lovely fern-clad dells, —
“ Whose tangled alleys fair invade
The depth of the brown forest shade.”
Glimpses of this scenery we give in our views of the Upper
Clarence, with sketches of the beautiful Gordon Brook and
Yugilbar homesteads and surroundings, which I might mention
will come within the area of the proposed Grafton-Glen Innes
railway route.
NEWBOLD GRANGE.
In describing the station life on the Clarence those who
have visited Newbold Grange, the head station of Mr. W. A. B.
Greaves, J.P., will concede that no place could be more typically
representative of a gentleman’s country residence.
Located on the western bank of the Clarence River, 30
miles from Grafton, amidst scenery of surpassing loveliness, and
replete with every requisite for comfort, not to say luxury and
elegance. Newbold can be said to be an ideal home, and in
contemplating all these accessories to human happiness one’s
mind naturally reverts back to that period in the history of the
Clarence, when the creature comforts of station life were few, and
existence on a station almost unendurable, and besides the dis-
comforts and hardships, one can imagine, too, the utter loneliness
of that bygone life, with no sound to break the stillness of the
summer evening, save the sibilant voice of insects or the crackling.


"And here were forests, ancient as the hills,
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.”— Coleridge.


of leaves and brake as the dusky aboriginal moves around his
camp fire.
What thoughts, indeed, are engendered by musing on the
past! What comparisons suggested of the vast and rapid evolu-
tion from barbaric rudeness to the highest perfection of culture
and art and science ! And the highest degree of home comfort
as can now be seen and realised by a visit to Newbold, and
placing oneself in the hands of the most genial and hospitable of
men, Mr. Percy Clarence, the manager of the station.
It is the history and associations and traditions of these
places which serve to give these homes a distinctive character of
their own. Hallowed by such associations, what romances, if the
mind is in a reflective mood, could be weaved out of the history
and inner life of these homesteads, of the changes which have
taken place, when sometimes the owner himself had only a saddle
for a pillow, and the blue canopy of Heaven overhead.
But to come back to the present.
The Building and Surroundings
I have stated that Newbold Grange as a . country residence
approaches as near perfection as possible. The building is of
pise work, the walls 18 inches thick, and the rooms lofty, so that
the place is delightfully cool in the summer and warm in the
winter time, The outbuildings and appointments are also in
keeping with the homestead.
History and Formation of the Station.
It was in 1839 that Messrs. C. J. and R G. Walker first
brought overland by Craig’s line, in charge of Mr. James
Johnson, 500 shorthorn heifers from Mrs. Reynolds’ noted
Camden herd. In 1854 Newbold was greatly extended by the
purchase and addition of Mr. Briscoe Ray s Cungui Run, with
its valuable stud of horses ; the two being now combined in one
holding. In those early days squatting was carried on under
much harder conditions than are now usually known, for the
Walkers did their own mustering and fencing. Fortunately,
however, they received needed help from the old country, together
with timely relays of shorthorns from their well known War-
wickshire stock, which is the foundation ot the fine herd now
sustained by Mr. Greaves, and improved by frequent pure
strains from other herds in this colony and Victoria.
An incident is worth relating in Mr. Walker’s explora-
tions on the southern side of the river above Grafton, unsuccess-
fully, the country having been all applied for as far as Ramornie.
Next inspected the northern side, where, finding country at the
first falls, he hastened to Mr. Commissioner Oakes’ camp at Port
Macquarie, intending to take up “ Eatonswill,” only, however, to
find that he was too late, Mr. Thos. Mylne having preceded him
by a day ! Foiled, but not disheartened, Mr. Walker applied for
the next highest country above Ramornie, naming it “ Newbold
Grange.” When “The Commissioner,” as that august func-
tionary was universally styled, visited the locality his permission
to occupy was laconically couched : “I hereby authorise you,
Jas. Johnson, Supt. for Mr. Walker, to possess and occupy a
cattle run on the Clarence, the boundaries of the said run to be
mutually agreed upon between you and Mr. Shannon, the
Supt. of Dr. Dobie. (Sd.) Hoakes, Commr. of Crown Lands.”
Could any original title be more charmingly elastic and
primitive than this ? And how delightfully suggestive of future
litigation and costs ! If the ashes of the Garden Palace, amidst
which, fortunately, repose almost, if not quite all, similar
“licenses” and descriptions (records of the Old Crown Lands
Occupation Branch), could speak some, even more vaguely in-
definite than that of Newbold, would amaze and amuse us.
GORDON BROOK.
Gordon Brook was first taken up in 1840 by Captain Crozier,
and included all the country lying between what was then the
Copmanhurst run and Yugilbar. Afterwards it passed into
the hands of Dr. Dobie, and from the latter to Messrs. Bundock
and Barnes, who purchased it in 1853. Afterwards Mr.
Thomas Hawkins Smith joined the partnership, and ultimately
the station passed into his hands, ard he still retains the pro-
prietorship.
Gordon Brook was one of the first stations to boil down
cattle and sheep for their tallow. The station has always been




famous for its stud, and Mr. Smith takes a keen interest in the
breeding of first-class horses and cattle. The Gordon Brook
thoroughbred horses have been noted in their time, and as the
best strains are being added to the stud the station will no doubt
maintain its reputation in the future.
An area of about 120,000 acres are comprised in the station
holding, and the herd is upwards of 7,000 cattle. An interesting
fact in connection with the station is that at one time the poet
Kendall was employed there as a shepherd.
* YUGILBAR.
Yugilbar has always been in the possession of the Ogilvie
family, and was taken up in 1840 by Captain Ogilvie, father of
the late Hon. E. D S. Ogilvie, into whose hands the property
passed at his death Yugilbar was always noted for the large
number of colonial experience hands employed there, and it was
on this station that Hon. T. H. Smith and Mr. C. F. Tindal first
gained an insight into colonial life.
In the early days the Ogilvies were famed for their untiring
industry and enterprise, and throughout the d'strict they were
known as the “ Dukes of Yugilbar.” The late Hon. E. D. S.
Ogilvie at great expense erected a very fine castle upon the
station, commanding a magnificent view, and to-day it is regarded
as one of the sights of the district. Yugilbar Station comprises
nearly 400 square miles, and is capable of carrying 25,000 head
of cattle.
RAMORNIE.
Ramornie Station was one of the earliest runs taken up in
the district, Dr. Dobie first selecting it in 1839. In 1845 he dis-
posed of the property to the Manning family, who, in turn, sold
it to three French gentlemen, and after a brief experience they
sold to Mr. C. G Tindal, to whom it still belongs. The first
meat-preserving business in the colony was established by Mr.
Tindal at Ramornie. The reputation which the product has
obtained has made Ramornie a by-word throughout the world.
The first brood mares brought to the district were imported to
Ramornie, and also a thoroughbred sire—Young Beverley. The
station at one time had a great reputation for the thoroughbreds
it produced. The holding comprises about 120,000 acres, and
carries upwards of 5,000 head of cattle.




From Grafton to Ulmarra.
Rich Lands and Prosperous Farmers.
■ OU will meet with a novel sight about four miles
from Grafton if you proceed by road to Ulmarra.
There is a stream
Choked up with Hyacinths.
Everyone will remember of a similar thing happening to St’
John’s River, Florida, in America, and some anxiety is felt with
regard to the river here, but I do not think there need be any
fear, as it is said that salt water kills the plant, and at times the
water is salty right up to Grafton.
Anyhow, Swan Creek certainly presents a beautiful sight
when the hyacinths, which have choked up the stream for miles,
are in full bloom. It is simply a mass of heliotrope for miles,
and so closely matted together that if a plank was laid on top
you could walk across Mr. Small, senr., says he remembers
when the first couple of plants were brought in a jam pot. Of
course, as I say, from an artistic point of view the hyacinth looks
beautiful, but those who have land on the creeks will probably
not derive much consolation from the poetic point, as disclosed
in the lines :
“ There the proud tulip lights her beacon blaze,
Her clustering curls the hyacinth displays.”
I see the hyacinth in its heliotrope splendour in Alumny
Creek, and I also saw a piece floating up the Clarence. It is
astonishing what enterprising people there are about. The
lantana and sweetbriar were introduced as ornaments in other
parts of the colony, and now they have become frightful pests.
The sparrows and hares and rabbits were brought out in the
same way, and it is a wonder some enterprising individual does
not import some rattlesnakes from America out here.
SOnE OF THE RICHEST LAND IN THE COLONV.
From Swan Creek to Coldstream there are ten miles by five
of as rich land as you could find anywhere. They don’t
know what it is to be short of grass on this area. I had seen it
just prior to being called away to Melbourne in November last,
having previously been driven over it, and truly it was a great
sight to see on all sides paddock upon paddock of rich clover,
with the herds of cattle sleek and fat. Indeed they had to watch
them in case they got “ blown.”
But what a change there was in going across to Victoria. I
never saw such a scene of desolation; there was hardly a blade
of green grass to be seen on either side of the line all the way over
after passing Moss Vale, everything being parched and dried up.
And how the drought-stricken people out West must envy
the people of the Clarence. Out Ulmarra way and on to Cowper
the same state of things obtained, and where there were no
clover fields the land nearer the river was taken up with lucerne
and cane.
At Ulmarra itself, an illustration of which is given, there
seems to be a good deal of business activity. Mr. Retallick,
a picture of whose store is shown, appears to be a live man, and
takes an active interest in everything which has for its object the
advancement of the district.
The butter factory at Ulmarra has the unique honour of


“’Tis often now the pilgrim turns
A faded face towards the seat,
And cools his brow among the ferns,
And runnel dabbling at his feet.”— Kendall.


separating more milk daily than any other factory in the colony.
They have now established creameries at Swan Creek, Cowper,
and Coldstream.
Ulmarra, with her rich district, should shoot ahead fast.
The beautiful long stretch of river at Ulmarra is a sight worth
seeing, with the handsome villas and gardens lining the banks.
Most of the residents around here and on the Southgate side hail
from Scotland. “ Who owns that place ?” I asked, pointing to a
pretty house on the bank. “ Oh, that’s Mac .” “ And that
other one?” “That’s Mac .” In fact they are nearly all
“ Macs,” and all appear to be doing splendidly on the rich lands
of the river. Their houses, surrounded almost by trees, possibly
reminding them of home and their own Bobbie Burns.
“ Where hanging beech and spreading elm,
Shaded by stream sae dear and cool.”
It would, however, be superfluous to dwell upon the
beauteous effect disclosed at every turn along the banks, or to
name the places. A.ll are well-knoivn to the habitues of the
river, but there is such a rural and reposeful look about this part
that I cannot help mentioning it. As the poet puts it,
11 The farmhouse stands upon the hill,
Around the ripening corn ”
And here, indeed, corn and cane and green pasture lands
are lighted up with the jacaranda, now giving place to the
bougainvillea, and imparting a beauteous aspect to everything.
The scene is repeated all along the banks on to Cowper
and Brushgrove.
That which I have said of Ulmarra applies to Cowper; the
rich pasture lands stretch right back to the Coldstream, and my
trip around, skirting the river, through the cane farms for about
10 miles, was most interesting. The land is exceedingly rich,
and will grow almost anything.
A Large Island.
Woodforde Island is about 13 miles long and seven across,
and certainly in that area carries a large agricultural and dairying
population. I was, indeed, surprised in going over this island to
find the people so well off on small areas. There are wealthy
men here on 50 acres of land—men, too, who started on very
little.
There are altogether 99 islands of various dimensions, and
some idea of the extent of arable land may be gauged when I say
that these islands, without exception, are crowded with farms of
from 30 acres up to 200 acres, and by describing one island I
have described the lot.
All, however, have their picturesque features, and one never
tires of them, there is such infinite variety.
The town of Lawrence itself, with its bridge and fairy-like-
looking residences ; Broadwater, opening out into a beautiful
lake, and presenting something of the appearance of the head of
Middle Harbour, Sydney, by reason of its foliaged blending of
greenery; Tynedale Park, on the South Arm, the approach to
Maclean —all, indeed, present enchanting views.
MACLEAN, THE PRETTIEST TOWN IN THE
COLONY.
Picturesque Surroundings.
Until I saw Maclean I had described Bega and Tumut as
being the two prettiest towns in the Colony, and thought there
was nothing to surpass them ; but I do not think that anyone who
has travelled over the Colony will withhold from Maclean the
honour which I have conferred upon it. Of course, when I say
the prettiest town, it must be understood I mean by taking the
surroundings in.
As Viewed from the Hills.
The visitor to Maclean is always required to repair to “the
Lookout.” It was to this point of vantage that Mr. C. T.
Wragge, the famous Meteorologist, was taken, and it is said he
pronounced the view one of the best that he has seen, and as Mr.
Wragge has been through the South Sea Islands and the north of
Queensland —in fact, nearly all over the world —that is saying a
great deal. However, to get a good view of the town itself, one
does not need to go to the Lookout.


“Long red reaches of the cane,
Yellow winding water lane,
Verdant isle and amber sea,
Lash, and murmur back again.” —Shelley


Turn around when half way up, and a glorious view meets
your vision. It is not, as I say, the town itself, but the tout
ensemble. Portion of Maclean is built upon a hill, and portion
lies bosomed at the foot. Handsome residences,. set in pretty
gardens, surmount the eminences. The public buildings, mostly
two-storied and modernly-built, rise up beyond the smaller
edifices, and relieving the commercial aspect of the view of
bricks and mortar, numerous gardens, umbrageous copse, and
green lawns, with patches here and there of the beautiful purple
jacaranda intervene.
This is nice, but the town itself only forms the background
for a charming set of sea pictures, such as the eye delights to
rest upon.
You do not seem to be looking upon a river, but really upon a
succession of lakes Lake Leman, so beautifully described by
Byron, with the dark Jura frowning over it j Lucerne, with the
Swiss Alps, in proximity, are said to be unequalled ; but, while in
the places mentioned you have sublimity and grandeur, here you
have the quiet beauty and the richness of colour, reminding you
of Marion Miller’s poetic lines—
“ In opal seas fair islets lie,
Or drift like Fancy’s visions by.”
The hills immediately in front clothed in their mantle of
dark green, the bush coming right down to the water’s edge, the
lake-like surface of the water itself only moved into ripples by the
aggressive steamboats passing by, the shadow and shine chasing
each other over foliage and stream, leaves an imperishable im-
pression upon the mind of the tourist.
A little still to the right is Green Point, a hill of vivid green,
set like a gem in a beautiful necklet. The new dock is being
constructed below. Looking up the North Arm, the view stretches
out, taking in Warrego and Stingeree Islands Ashby Island,
too, looks very pretty, here and there being patches of cultivation
of various shades of green, the whole of these islands being simply
a network of farms.
On ascending to the Lookout, and gazing up the South Arm
of the river, the scene is surprisingly beautiful. The river itself,
glowing with sunlight effects, is like a silver ribbon winding along,
the dark green brush edging the banks marking the course of
the stream more distinctly, while along the banks on either side
at short distances, the land being so rich, are to be seen farm
upon farm, the cultivation disclosing various hues, the green and
gold of the new and old cane mingling with the alternate dark
and bright patches of lucerne and pasture land. This is, indeed,
the finest landscape view of all, to my mind.
The Maclean Park, of which we give illustrations, is full of
enchanting scenes.
I might mention that the chief resort of the Maclean people
is Broome’s Head, a seaside place, where the residents repair
every year.
In speaking of the South Arm, I must not omit to mention
Shark’s Creek, where it is said the most hospitable people and
the finest girls and boys are grown.
From a Business Standpoint.
A stranger entering the town of Maclean might think the
place somewhat dull. It is astonishing, however, the amount of
business transacted there, and there are some fine stores and
hotels. Our illustrations show portions of the town. Mr. P.
Conlon has very fine premises, and does a splendid business.
The firm of Cameron and Co. (S. Macnaughtan) is associated
with the history of Maclean. The late Mr. Cameron came to the
river, and opened a store at Ulmarra, first in 1859, and in 1862
started business in Maclean, which was then a dense scrub, with
only a few sawyers’ huts about. Mr. Cameron also erected a
hotel alongside the store. Mr. Macnaughtan came from Scotland
to take charge of the Maclean business, and is now the King of
Maclean, so to speak, and has been Mayor of the town. Mr. D.
See is the present Mayor.
From Maclean to the Heads.

aspect of the islands out to the Heads, and now a word about

THE SUGAR INDUSTRY ON THE CLARENCE.
Although dairying has made such remarkable progress on
the Clarence, the sugar industry is still to the fore as the staple
product of the river. It is unnecessary to go into the history of
the sugar-growing on the river, but to show the importance of the
industry in the colony I will give an approximate estimate of the
area under cane, the number of people employed, etc. The area
under cane is between 26,000 acres and 30,000 acres, the number
of farmers who grow the cane about 1,600, and the number of
men employed in cultivating and cutting the cane, in addition to
the farmers, is about 2,500. The capital value of the land under
cane is somewhere near In the manufacture of sugar
the capital actually invested in plant, etc , amounts to about
£lSo,ooo.
The history of sugar-growing on the Clarence has been a
sad one for many who at the start made money by planting, and
then, thinking there were fortunes to be made in the business,
launched out and erected mills themselves. No need to go into
the reason why, but nearly all the small mills are now silent.
The huge chimney stacks, weatherbeaten and crumbling to decay,
now stand like the druidical monuments of old, the “ solemn
silent spectres of byegone days,” or, at least, memorials of tbe
folly or misfortune of their former owners.
Strange to say, most of those who went down were Scotch-
men—good men, who did not deserve such bad luck. However,
those who stuck to the cane-growing industry alone on the Lower
Clarence have prospered, and in my tour around Harwood,
Serpentine, Chatsworth and Palmer’s Island, I was astonished at
the outward appearance of wealth on all sides, of beautiful and
well-built houses, and I know a great many, with their 50 to 100
acres, who now have big bank balances. Our illustrations show
the cane growing and being brought to the Colonial Sugar Co.’s
mill.
And now that I have mentioned the Company I may state
that they commenced operations here in 1869, and for some time
three mills were worked, namely, at Southgate, Chatsworth and
Harwood, but subsequently the directors found it advisable to
concentrate the plant in one factory at Harwood, where operations
are now being carried on with machinery capable of producing
from 400 to 500 tons of sugar per week.
All the cane is purchased from the farmers, the Company
having no plantations of their own on the river. With the
exception of a few farms adjacent to the mill, where the cane is
cut and carted to the carriers by the farmers, the cane is cut by
the Company, who engage and supervise gangs of men for that
purpose. The cane is brought to the mill in punts, each capable
of carrying from 50 to 65 tons.
The manipulation of the cane in the making of the sugar is also
a very interesting process, but want of space precludes my giving
a description.
Frost and a disease called “ gumming ” are the greatest
enemies that the cane growers have to contend against, and the
“ gumming ” can only be combatted by the careful selection of
cane plants, or “ sets ” as they are usually called. The most
favoured plants of the species, least liable to “gumming,” are the
Rappoi, Mauritius Ribbon, Grey Fiji, and Tanna, the last
named being (owing to its immunity from gum) grown almost
exclusively on the lower part of the river.
In the selection of cane the most important consideration
is that of <f sweetness,” many varieties growing heavy and healthy
crops almost valueless by reason of their poor quality. China
cane is now receiving more attention on account of its hardy
character, being almost if not quite frost-proof, but on rank soil
it must be classed among the failures because of its low quality,
although on soil where the crops are light it may be grown with
profit to grower and manufacturer. One of the sweetest varieties,
and one which is therefore largely grown, is Moore’s Purple,
also Light Purple. There are between 5,000 and 6,000
acres grown for the Company, and it is anticipated that there
will be fully 2,000 acres more if the conditions are
propitious. The outlook, therefore, for the sugar-growing
industry in the Clarence is very good.

Rock, wave and wood were mingled there.”— Ruskin.


COFFEE GROWING ON THE CLARENCE.
A couple of miles down from Chatsworth is the coffee
plantation of Mr. Bale, which is so interesting that 1 must at
least say a iittle about it. Mr. Bale has nearly 3,000 trees planted,
the Government having given him land for the purpose. The
plantation looks beautiful just as the berries are ripening, and
Mr. Bale thinks that he can also make coffee-growing profitable,
although he had a lot of dead work at the start.
Mr. Bale makes a very good coffee, for which he gets a ready
sale; and as far as I can see the future of coffee-growing
on the Clarence is very promising.
A short distance down from Mr. Bale’s live the parents of
the late Henry Searle, champion sculler of the world, and it was
on this portion of the river that poor Searle going to school piled
up the muscle and the powers of endurance, which, combined
with expertness, afterwards made him champion of the world.
I never saw a man who could get pace out of a boat like him.
A tew years ago the writer asked Bill Beach what he thought
of Searle as an oarsman. The reply was : “He is the best
oarsman I have ever seen.” A very nice monument has been
erected to the memory of Searle in the Maclean Cemetery. I
don’t think we will see his equal again.
After leaving here we come to Talmer’s Island, where sugar
and the usual other products are grown.
AT THE HEADS.
I have now arrived at the heads, and with the limits of space
fairly exhausted suffice it to say, therefore, that this is the popular
seaside resort of the Clarence people, who come down here from
all parts to recruit themselves,and to get a sniff of the ozone, and
with the arrangements for bathing made a little better, this place
should be availed by even more than it is.
With regard to the Clarence as a port and the “bar” question,
I cannot do better than quote the words of Sir John Coode. In
speaking of the proposed works to make a good harbour of the
Clarence, the eminent engineer says “ These works, if com-
pletely carried out, would, I am confident, result in the tormation
and maintenance of a minimum depth in the entrance of at least
18 feet at low water. With this depth vessels could always enter
and leave with safety, regardless of the state of the sea. The
only times in which they might be delayed would be on the
occasion of exceptionally heavy freshes.”
Yamba has a pretty sound about it, and prettiness is not
lacking. You get here landscape beauty and rugged grandeur
combined, reminding us of Byron’s poetic words —
“ Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild ;
Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields.”
It lends variety, after contemplating the placid waters of the
river, and the lovely and peaceful surroundings, to repair to the
seaside to watch the “ white horses ” careering in—to listen to
torn Ocean’s roar, as the angry waves lash and buffet against the
rock-bound shore, feel the spray in your face as the white foam is
sent flying up, and then falling like a shower of silver back again.
Man feels his own impotency, as does also the writer, the thought
forcing itself upon me that, although I have brought to my aid
all our best known poets, I have been unable to do this noble
river justice.
IMPRESSIONS OF THE CLARENCE PEOPLE.
Vale ! I cannot take leave of my readers without placing
on record a fact which should be known to all the Colony. The
foregoing pages will show that the Clarence River should make a
magnificent route for tourists, and I make bold to state that when
visitors do arrive on the Clarence they will meet with the kindest
of treatment.at the hands of the residents.
