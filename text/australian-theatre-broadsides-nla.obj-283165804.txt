was first noted at Mafia, and 1850. In
1729 the whole of Europe suffered severely.
According to statistics published by the

deaths in London in one Tveek, and in
Vienna sixty thousand persons were af-
fected. In 1737 and 1743 there were
further outbreaks, and the deaths in one
week in London amounted to one thous-
and. In 1775 domestic animals wefe
first attacked by it. In 1782 forty thous-

Wonderful Cure of “ Enlargement of the Liver," “ Weakness of
the Heart” and “Blood Poisoning."
Always Fresh Testimonials Coming in.
Watch the Papers.
Mr. 8. A. PALMER, 7/8/9
“Vitadatio”- Institute,
Bourke Street, Melbourne.
Sir,—Having been completely cured by your wonderful medicine, “VITADATIO,” after very many
years of suffering, I beg to hand you this testimonial, in heartfelt thanks, and for the sake of other sufferers.
The facts of my case are as follow—ln the winter of 1895 I was attacked with severe pains in the region of the
heart, which by the first doctor was pronounced to be “ ENLARGEMENT OF THE LIVER” - later on by
other members of the medical faculty as “WEAKNESS OF THE HEART”; then again, at the Melbourne
General Hospital, they told me I was suffering from “ BLOOD POISONING.” On acouwnt of sudden fits of
giddiness I had to give up my business, that of general contractor, and from that time up to about a month ago
I wag never out of the doctors’ hands. In Melbourne alone I have had 7 (seven) of the very best doctors • also
others in South and West Australia. None of them could cure me, nor, as a matter of fact, give me relief’. “ I
also left the Melbourne General Hospital in the same state as I had mitered it.” When ALMOST DESPAIR-
ING of EVER BEING CURED I was persuaded by Mr. Braddy, of Brunswick-street, North Fitzroy, to give
“VITADATIO” a trial, and I am pleased to state that after having taken only three bottles I felt great relief
and by the time I had finished my fifth bottle the pain had completely left me, and I feel a new man and am
now able to resume my work.
M.V appetite, which had fallen away to almost starvation point, hag now returned, and I can eat three
GOOD MEADS per day and enjoy them.
During my illness I to sleep more than two or three hours of a night on account of pains in
the lungs, and great difflsulty in breathing. lam pleased to inform you this trouble has also left me and I
a , lf r e P soundly. The giddiness has completely left my head. It is now some considerable time since I
left off taking ‘ VITADATIO,” and, as 1 have no return of any of the aforementioned complaints. I am
positive the Cure is permanent. * '
I regard the Cure as simply marvellous, as I can assure you I had no hope of ever being relieved let
alone cured. «...
I shall be pleased to give anyone a personal interview, and tell them all that VITADATIO ” baa done
for me.
Several friends of mine, knowing my case, have given your medicine a trial, and with good results.
I can recommend it with the greatest of confidence to anyone entering a like complaint to my own.
You are at perfect liberty to make what use you like of this testimonial.
With heartfelt thanks,
1 remain, Dear Sir,

' Changed His Mind.
A young man about twenty-three years of age
dressed like a farmer, had his feet on the car
seat in front of him and was reading a novel,
when one of the boys went over to him and ob-
served :
“ I’ve just made a bet of five dollars on you.”
“Onme ? What is it ?”
“ I’ve bet five dollars that you will suicide
within a week. I’ve been watching you very
closely for the last half hour, and all signs in-
dicate melancholy and despondency. Have you
selected any particular line of killing yourself—•
poison, the rope, drowning or hanging ? ”
“Did you actually bet five dollars?” an
xiously asked the young man.
“ I did.”
“ Pay if you lose ? ”
“ I’ll have to.”
“ That’s too bad. 1 wish I could have seen
you last week.”
“ Why last week ? ”
“ Because I then had the ager every day right
along—two cows were sick on my hands—my
girl had gone back on me, and I expected a
windmill man was going to beat me out of four
hundred dollars. I did kinder think of suicide.”
“ But now ? ”
•“All is changed. Cows got well—ager all
gone—gal has set the day for next Wednesday,
and the windmill man is straighter than a board.

He’d Stop Over.
A new story was afloat on Prince Russell
Harrison at the fifth Avenue Hotel last
night, and is credited to W. W. Dudley.
It occurred on the Prince’s recent visit to
Europe, On the way over he told his
fellow passengers that he should not stop
in England at all, but should hurry right
through to Paris. At Liverpool it was
noticed that Russell was preparing his
baggage with an eye to stop in London.
“ Why, Mr. Harrison,” said a fellow
passenger, “ I thought you weren’t going
to stop in England ? ”
“Well,” said the Prince, “It’s this ways

Story of a Diamond Necklace.
A very wealthy man gave to his, wife,
some years since a diamond necklace
which cost him 75,000 dols. in Paris.
Her brother, under peculiar circum-
stances, defaulted. The family was in
unspeakable grief. The great corporation
whose assets he had made way with was
quite willing to compromise the felony if
it could be recouped pecuniarily. Taking
her diamond necklace to a world-renowned
establishment, she asked for how much
it could be duplicated in paste, and was
told that for 2,500 dols. a necklace abso-
lutely a reproduction, absolutely undetect-
able, save by expert tests, could be made
in three months’ time. It was ordered,
paid for, the original was sold, the brother
was saved. Shortly after that, or perhaps
a few years thereafter, this lady, who was
in what our contemporaries call “high
life,” —that is, she was rich, —attended a
charity ball. Sitting in her box, resplendent
in costume, magnificent in decoration, her
necklace so far outshone the jewels of her
friends and neighbors as 'to be included in
a reporXorial description the following day
in the' chief paper of the city.—“ New
York Press.”
